Abstract
When the entire world is eagerly waiting for a safe, eective and widely available COVID-19 vaccine, unprecedented spikes of new cases are evident in numerous countries. To gain a deeper understanding about
the future dynamics of COVID-19, a compartmental mathematical model has been proposed in this paper
incorporating all possible non-pharmaceutical intervention policies. Model parameters have been calibrated
using sophisticated trust-region-reective algorithm and short-term projection results have been illustrated
for Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia and India. Control reproduction numbers (Rc ) have been
calculated in order to get insights about the current epidemic scenario in the above-mentioned countries.
Forecasting results depict that the aforesaid countries are having downward trends in daily COVID-19 cases.
However, it is highly recommended to use ecacious face coverings and maintain strict physical distancing,
as the pandemic is not over in any country. Global sensitivity analysis enlightens the fact that ecacy of
face coverings is the most signicant parameter, which could signicantly control the transmission dynamics
of the novel coronavirus compared to other non-pharmaceutical measures. In addition, reduction in eective
contact rate with isolated patients is also essential in bringing down the epidemic threshold (Rc ) below
unity. All necessary graphical simulations have been performed with the help of Caputo-Fabrizio fractional
derivatives. In addition, optimal control problem for fractional system has been designed and the existence
of unique solution has also been showed by using Picard-Lindelof technique. Finally, the unconditionally
stability of the given fractional numerical technique has been proved.

1. Introduction

2

To date, as there is no world-wide accepted vaccine that can provide full immunity to the human body

3

against COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies are the realistic and eective solutions to

4

control second wave of the pandemic. However, around 40 dierent coronavirus vaccines are experiencing

5

critical clinical trials and nine already in the nal stage of testing on thousands of people. Importantly, a

6

leading vaccine candidate developed by the University of Oxford is already in an advanced stage of testing and

7

it has been found in trials that it can trigger an immune response [1]. Generally, an eective vaccine would

8

take years, if not decades, to develop. As research in this eld is happening at a breakneck speed, scientists

9

believe that an eective vaccine is likely to become widely available by mid-2021. Lack of transparency

10

could be a vital issue in upcoming days and a false sense of security could evolve among general people if

11

the vaccine doesn't work eectively.

12

Mathematical models can always provide considerable insights of the transmission dynamics and complex-

13

ities of any infectious diseases, which eventually help government ocials design overall epidemic planning.

14

Importantly, mathematical analysis always plays a notable role in making vital public health decisions,

15

resource allocation and implementation of social distancing measures and other non-pharmaceutical inter-

16

ventions. From the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, mathematicians and researchers are working

17

relentlessly and have already done tremendous contributions in limiting the spread of the coronavirus in

18

dierent parts of the world [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In an early contribution, Ferguson

19

dierent non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies on COVID-19 mortality by developing an agent-based

20

model. In another study, Ngonghala

21

can signicantly limit the spread of the virus and reduce the COVID-induced mortality in dierent states of

22

the USA in general in the absence of community lockdown measures and stringent social distancing practice.

23

On the other hand, Nabi [5] projected the future dynamics of COVID-19 for various COVID-19 hotspots by

24

proposing a compartmental mathematical model and concluded that early relaxation of lockdown measures

25

and social distancing could bring a second wave in no time. As a matter of reality, inhabitants in several

26

countries compelled to violate containment measures due to prolonged lockdown measures and severe eco-

27

nomic recession [4]. Netherlands having one of the best health care systems in the world, is grappling with

28

continuous spikes in daily cases due to aversion to masks.

In this study, in the absence of a safe, eective and world-wide approved vaccine, a new compartmental

mathematical COVID-19 model has been designed incorporating all possible non-pharmaceutical intervention

31

strategies such as wearing face coverings, social distancing, home or self-quarantine and self or institutional

32

isolation. In addition, the impacts of dierent interventions scenarios have been analysed rigorously. The

has been performed by using real-time data, followed by a projection of the evolution of the disease. Global

36

sensitivity analysis is applied to determine the inuential mechanisms in the model that drive the transmission

37

dynamics of the disease. For fractional simulations, we used the well known non-integer order derivative called

38

Caputo-Fabrizio (CF) fractional derivative. Since last few decades, there are so many epidemic models have

39

been solved by non-integer order derivatives. Recently some applications of non-integer order derivatives in

40

mathematical epidemiology can be seen from [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. There are so many research papers have been

41

come to study the outbreaks of coronavirus, in which some are [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. We

42

performed the optimal control problem in CF derivative sense and provided the existence of unique solution

43

by well-known technique named as Picard-Lindelof technique. We also proved the unconditionally stability

44

of the given fractional numerical technique. We used the numerical data of all ve given countries and

45

perform the all necessary graphical simulations.

46

The entire chapter is organized as follows. Materials and methods are presented in Section 2. Section 3 is

47

solely devoted to asymptotic stability of the proposed model. In section 4, estimation of model parameters

48

and projection results have been discussed using daily COVID-19 data of Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil,

49

Colombia and India. In section 5, to quantify the impact of dierent model mechanisms, LHS-PRCC

50

global sensitivity scheme has been performed. In section 6, numerical and graphical simulations have been

51

illustrated using Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivatives. Later, optimal control problem has been designed

52

in fractional sense in section 7. The chapter ends with some insightful ndings and strategies, which could

53

signicantly control the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Model formulation

A compartmental mathematical has been designed to describe the transmission dynamics of the COVID19 incorporating all possible real-life interactions. Considering dierent infection status, the entire human population (denoted by N (t) at time t) has been stratied into nine mutually-exclusive compartments
of susceptible individuals (S(t)), early-exposed individuals (E1 (t)), pre-symptomatic individuals (E2 (t)),
symptomatically-infectious (I(t)), asymptomatically-infectious or infectious individuals with mild-symptoms

(A(t)), quarantined infectious (Q(t)), hospitalised or isolated individuals (L(t)), recovered individuals (R(t)),
disease-induced death cases (D(t)). Hence,

N (t) = S(t) + E1 (t) + E2 (t) + I(t) + A(t) + Q(t) + L(t) + R(t) + D(t)
56

57
58

The following assumptions have been considered to formulate the above-mentioned model.

• Vital dynamic (birth and natural deaths) has been ignored as the main objective of this study is to
observe the short-term dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic.

• Recovered individuals are immune to the disease which means that they cannot get reinfected. However,

found. Nevertheless, it is important to note this singular nding does not provide generalisability of

62

this phenomenon and hence it is not considered in our study.

et al.

[22], genomic evidence for reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 has been

The ow diagram of the proposed model is illustrated in Figure 1, where susceptible individuals can become
infected by an eective contact with individuals in the pre-symptomatic (E2 (t)), symptomatically-infectious

(I(t)), asymptomatically-infectious (A(t)), quarantined-infectious (Q(t)) and isolated-infectious (L(t)). Effective contact rates are λE2 , λI , λA , λQ , and λL respectively and the expressions are dened in (2). Importantly, the compartment E1 (t) consists of early-infected individuals who are still not infectious, whereas the
individuals in pre-symptomatic cohort E2 (t) have the capability of transmitting coronavirus before the end of
the disease incubation period. A proportion of individuals in newly-exposed compartment (E1 (t)) progress to
pre-symptomatic class (E2 (t)) at a rate κ1 . After the completion of disease mean incubation period, at a rate

ρκ2 , a fraction of individuals who have clear clinical symptoms of COVID-19 progress to I(t) compartment.
Individuals in E2 (t) class who do not have any clear symptoms progress to A(t) class at a rate (1 − ρ)κ2 .
Pre-symptomatic individuals are assumed to be self-quarantined at a rate q . With the help of diagnostic
or surveillance testing approaches, symptomatically-infectious individuals and asymptomatically-infectious
individuals are brought under institutional or home isolation at rates τA and τI respectively. Moreover,
the parameter γI (γA )(γQ )(γL ) represents the recovery rate for individuals in the I(A)(Q)(L) class. Finally,
the disease-induced mortality rate for individuals in the I(Q)(L) compartment is dened by the parameter

δI (δQ )(δL ). Considering all the above-mentioned interactions, the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 can

The formula for control reproduction number has been formulated. Indeed, the insightful epidemic

81

threshold, Rc calculates the average number of new secondary COVID-19 cases generated by a COVID-19

82

positive individual in a population a portion susceptible people are using eective face coverings. Dierent

83

non-pharmaceutical measures are acting as control measures which lead to bring down Rc under unity [25].

84

Hence, we claim the following result followed by a direct consequence of the next generation operator method

85

[25, Theorem 2]. where ρ(·) represents the spectral radius operator. The insightful epidemic threshold, R0

86

calculates the average number of new secondary COVID-19 infections generated by an COVID-19 positive

87

patient in a completely susceptible population. The control of COVID-19 pandemic passes by the application

88

of some control measures which contribute to decrease until R0 less than one [25]. Hence we claim the

89

following result.

90

Theorem 1.

91

follows:

The COVID-19 transmission dynamics is inuenced by the basic reproduction number R0 as

1. If R0 < 1, then a suciently small ow of infected individuals will not generate an outbreak of the

92

COVID-19,i.e the disease-equilibrium E0 is locally asymptotically stable on ω .

93

2. If R0 > 1, then a suciently small ow of infected individuals will generate an outbreak of the COVID-

94

19, and the disease-equilibrium E0 is unstable.

96

Lemma 1.

97

Remark 2.

98

not generate an outbreak of COVID-19, whereas for Rc > 1, epidemic curve reaches a peak by growing

99

exponentially and then decreases to zero as t → ∞.

If Rc < 1, the disease-free equilibrium x0 is locally asymptotically stable and unstable if Rc > 1.
Lemma 1 implies that if Rc < 1, then a suciently small ow of infected individuals will

The better control of the COVID-19 can be established by the fact that the DFE x0 is globally asymp-

100
101

totically stable (GAS). In this context, we claim the following result.

102

Theorem 3.

103

D.

if Rc < 1, then the manifold, W , of disease-free equilibrium points of the model (1) is GAS in

In the absence of use of face coverings, i.e. m = 0, Rc converges to the basic reproduction number,

R0 . Now, we will study the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium whenever the basic reproduction
number is less than one (Rc < 1). For this, we use the following Lyapunov function

L = a1 E1 + a2 E2 + a3 I + a4 A + a5 Q + a6 L.

L̇ ≤ (RE2 + RI + RA + RQ + RL − 1) E2 = (Rc − 1) E2 .
104

From (11), it follows that L̇ < 0 if Rc < 1, and L̇ = 0 if and only if E1 = E2 = I = A = Q = L =

105

0. Therefore, L is a Lyapunov function for system (1). Moreover, the maximal invariant set contained

106

in {(S(t), E1 (t), E2 (t), I(t), A(t), Q(t), L(t), R(t), D(t)) ∈ Ω : L̇ = 0} is the continuum of the disease-free

107

equilibrium (E0 ). Thus, from Lyapunov theory, we deduce that the disease-free equilibrium E0 is GAS if

108

Rc < 1. Hence, it follows, by the LaSalle's Invariance Principal, that the continuum of disease-free equilibria

109

of the model (1) is a stable global attractor in Ω whenever Rc ≤ 1 The previous analysis can be summarize

110

as follows:

111

Theorem 4.

112

4. Model calibration and forecasting

If Rc ≤ 1, then the disease-free equilibrium E0 is globally asymptotically stable on Ω.

113

The model (1) calibration has been performed using a newly developed optimization algorithm based

114

on trust-region-reective (TRR) algorithm, which can be regarded as an evolution of Levenberg-Marquardt

115

algorithm [5]. This robust optimization procedure can be used eectively for solving nonlinear least-squares

116

problems. This algorithm has been implemented using the

117

Optimization Toolbox in MATLAB. Necessary model parameters have been estimated using this optimization

118

technique. Daily infected cases data have been collected from a trusted data repository, which is available

119

online. A 7-day moving average of the daily reported cases has been used for our model calibration due to

120

moderate volatile nature of real data. It has been observed that the number of daily testing in Argentina,

121

Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia and India have been really inconsistent. With an aim to capture the real

122

outbreak scenario, the 7-day moving average has been used in this regard.

coronavirus in the community. Due to unbearable economic crisis, inhabitants of the country have already

127

started violating staying at home and quarantine orders. The country could face a second wave of infection

128

in near future in the absence of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures. The robustness of our model

129

tting performance has been illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 as of November 11, 2020. Moreover, projection

130

results from mid November to early April for daily and cumulative cases in Argentina have been depicted

131

in Figs. 4 and 5. According to our projection results, the daily could reach upto 2450K cases by the end

132

of March 2021, if the current trend holds. Model parameters presented in the Table 2 have been calibrated

133

using observed real data from March 4 to November 11, 2020.

134

As we can see the results from the proposed model responses complement the real data very well. The

135

control reproduction number (Rc ) is estimated to be ∼ 1.37 (95% CI : 1.03 − 1.59) as of November 11 and

136

prior established ndings 1 − 5 for COVID-19 really match well with the estimation [30, 5]. The tally of

137

cumulative infected cases is projected to reach 2450K and country's death toll could mount to 52.6K by the

138

end of March 2021. Table 2 illustrates model calibration results and baseline parameter values.

144

outbreak scenario in Bangladesh is still a puzzle to be solved for the health ocials due to scant COVID-19

145

testing program. The control reproduction number (Rc ) is estimated to be ∼ 1.17 (95% CI : 0.95 − 1.39) as

of November 11 and prior established ndings for this metric go well with the estimation [30, 5]. The tally of

cumulative infected cases is projected to reach 436K around March 31, 2021 and the estimated total death

148

cases could reach 11, 400 by the end of March, 2021. Table 3 illustrates the key features used to calibrate

4.4. Colombia

163

Colombia is one of the hardest-hit countries in Latin America which has already surpassed one million

164

conrmed coronavirus cases. As of November 15, 2020, Colombia has seen 1,198,746 conrmed cases of

165

COVID-19 and the country's death toll climbed to 34,031. Our model tting performance with the historical

166

data is quite outstanding depicted in Figs. 14 and 15. According to our projection results illustrated in Figs

167

16 and 17, the tally of cumulative cases could reach approximately 1730K cases and the number of daily

168

cases could hover around 2000 cases by the end of March 2021. The control reproduction number (Rc ) is

169

estimated to be ∼ 1.19 as of November 11, 2020. According to our analysis, the epidemic threshold (Rc )

170

could be brought under unity by the end of December 2020 by following strict distance maintaining protocol

171

and mass-level usage of ecacious face coverings.

peak. According to our projection results, India could reel under the second wave of infection unless non-

177

pharmaceutical interventions strategies are followed comprehensively. As of November 15, the country's

178

caseload now stands at 8,850,338 and it's death toll has mounted to 130,187. Figs. 18 and 19 illustrate the

179

tting performance of our proposed model for India from late January to mid November. Historical data

180

from January 30 to November 11 have been considered to calibrate the model parameters. As we can see

181

from the gures, model-tting is exceptionally well for the historical observed data. Based on our projection

182

results from Fig. 20, the number of daily cases could be brought under 1000 cases if mass-level ecacious

183

face coverings is strictly maintained. The control reproduction number Rc is estimated to be ∼ 1.41 as of

184

November 11, which complements the prior studied observations [30, 5]. The tally of cumulative infected

185

cases is projected to reach 11259K by the end of March 2021 if current trend continues. In addition, country's

186

death toll could mount to 187K over the period. Tab. 6 illustrates the key features used to calibrate this

187

scenario.

5. Global sensitivity analysis

189

With an aim to quantify the most dominant mechanisms in the proposed model, a renowned global sen-

190

sitivity analysis approach Partial Rank Correlation Coecient (PRCC) method has been carried out. This

191

method can provide considerable insights about the relationship between model responses (state variables)

192

and model parameters (sampled by Latin Hypercube Sampling method) in an outbreak setting [31]. PRCC

193

values are generally bounded between -1 and 1. A monotonic relationship between the model input parame-

194

ters and the model outputs is generally assumed in this method. Apart from qualitative relationship, precise

195

quantitative impact of dierent parameters on model responses can be determined by calculating the PRCC

196

values. Uniform distribution of all model parameters have been considered to generate LHS matrices. A

197

positive PRCC value depicts that the model output can be increased by increasing the respective model input

198

parameter. Similarly, model output can be decreased by forcing down the corresponding input parameter.

199

In addition, a negative PRCC value indicates a negative correlation between the model input and output.

200

When it comes to analyse a complex model, it often get really challenging to control the parameters.

201

In this context, sensitivity analysis can give considerable insights regarding the quantitative relationship

202

between model responses and model input parameters. However, it is really challenging for complex models

203

to determine the qualitative and quantitative relationship with sucient accuracy. As we can see from Figure

204

22, nearly the same qualitative relationship has been found between the number of symptomatic infectious

205

individuals (one of the crucial model responses) and three parameters which are eective contact rate with

206

isolated infected individuals (βL ), ecacy of face coverings (ζ ) and face coverings compliance for our studied

207

ve countries. The public health implications of these ndings are the dynamics of COVID-19 could be

208

controlled by encouraging mass-level usage of ecacious face coverings. In addition, the high signicance of

209

βL indicates that immediate isolation of detected patients is highly required.

Now, we prove the existence of unique solution for the given COVID-19 model in the sense of CaputoFabrizio fractional derivative by the application of xed-point theory. In this concern, the proposed system

G7 (t, L(t)), G8 (t, R(t)), G9 (t, D(t))}. Next we assume that the solution of the non-integer order model are

Therefore, the model involving C-F derivative given in Eq. (13) has a unique set of solution.

6.3. Solution method in Caputo-Fabrizio Operator

Theorem 5.

(24)

The numerical approximation (24) is unconditionally stable if

kG4 (tk+1 , I(tk+1 )) − G4 (tk , I(tk ))k→ 0.
Proof.

Let I(t) be the solution of a dierential equation as shown in (19) under CF non- integer order

derivative operator sense. Then we have to evaluate the norm

For k → ∞, we have

Clearly, the second term of the above inequality approaches zero when k → ∞. Now, if ||G4 (tk+1 , I(tk+1 ))−

G4 (tk , I(tk ))||→ 0 as k → ∞, we educe that the numerical solution is stable.

6.4. Graphical simulations

223

After giving the all necessary theoretical concerns, now we do the graphical simulations via CF fractional

224

derivative. In our paper, we are using the real numerical data of COVID-19 for ve dierent countries named

225

as Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia and India respectively. Here rst we perform the graphs for

226

Argentina COVID-19 cases. To perform numerical simulations, we use parameter values summarize in Table

227

2. In the family of Figure 23, we analysed the plots of S(t), E1 (t), E2 (t), I(t), A(t) and Q(t). We observed

228

that for dierent fractional order values peaks are well dened and when we decrease the fractional order

229

then the peaks sifted towards the later time period. In the group of Figs. 24- 25, rst we show the nature of

230

L(t), R(t), D(t) and then analysed the plots of I(t) versus S(t), A(t), Q(t), L(t) and R(t). In the comparison

231

of given classes with infected individuals, we see that when the infectious I(t) increases then asymptomatic

232

infectious A(t) also increases with same nature. In sub-gs. 24d- 25b, we see that the fractional order does

233

not play any big role because the nature of the classes is nearly same at all dierent fractional order values

234

%. Initial values of given classes for Argentina are S(0) = 45333107, E1 (0) = 10, E2 (0) = 4, I(0) = 2, A(0) =

235

1, Q(0) = 0, L(0) = 0, R(0) = 0 and D(0) = 0. We have used the total population of the country for S(0).

Figure 31: I(t) versus L(t), R(t) for Brazil data
260

To continue the graphical simulations for the above mentioned countries to study the outbreaks of COVID-

261

19, in the family of Figures 32- 34, we exemplied the graphs for COVID-19 cases in Colombia. To perform

262

numerical simulations, we have taken the numerical values summarize in Table 5. In the family of Figure

263

32, we analysed the plots of S(t), E1 (t), E2 (t), I(t), A(t) and Q(t). We observed that the nature of peaks is

264

mostly same as for other above analysed data, for dierent fractional order values peaks are well dened and

265

when we decrease the fractional order then the peaks sifted towards the later time period. In the collection

266

of Figures 33- 34, rst we show the nature of L(t), R(t), D(t) and then analysed the plots of I(t) versus

267

S(t), A(t), Q(t), L(t) and R(t). When we compare the given classes with I(t), we again observed that when

268

the population of infected individuals increases then asymptomatic infectious A(t) also increases with same

269

nature. In sub-gures 33d- 34b, we see that the fractional order does not play any big role because the

270

nature of the classes is nearly same at all dierent fractional order values %. Initial values of given classes

271

for Colombia are S(0) = 50882891, E1 (0) = 10, E2 (0) = 4, I(0) = 2, A(0) = 1, Q(0) = 0, L(0) = 0, R(0) = 0

272

and D(0) = 0. We have used the total population of the country for S(0).

Eventually, we have done the graphical simulations for India which is the second highest populous country

274

and also the second worst-hit country by COVID-19. To study the outbreak of COVID-19 in India, in the

275

family of Figures 35- 37, we exemplied the all necessary graphs of given classes to observe the dynamics of

276

COVID-19. To perform numerical simulations, we took the numerical values from the Table 6. In the family

277

of Figure 35, we analysed the plots of S(t), E1 (t), E2 (t), I(t), A(t) and Q(t). We observed that the nature of

278

peaks is mostly same as for other above analysed data, for dierent fractional order values peaks are well

279

dened and when we decrease the fractional order then the peaks sifted towards the later time period. In

280

the collection of Figures 36- 37, rst we show the nature of L(t), R(t), D(t) and then analysed the plots of

281

I(t) versus S(t), A(t), Q(t), L(t) and R(t). When we compare the given classes with I(t), we again observed

282

that when the population of infected individuals increases then asymptomatic infectious A(t) also increases

283

with same nature. In sub-gures 36d- 37b, we observed that at the dierent fractional order values the

284

nature of the classes is nearly same. Initial values of given classes for India are S(0) = 414001316, E1 (0) =

285

10, E2 (0) = 4, I(0) = 2, A(0) = 1, Q(0) = 0, L(0) = 0, R(0) = 0 and D(0) = 0. We have used the 30% of the

286

total population of India for S(0).

7. Optimal control problem formulation
In this concern, our main aim is to decrease the number of infected individuals with COVID-19 at
the same time decrease the cost J(v) associated with their strategies. For this purpose, we use a control
function v = (v1 , v2 , v3 ), where v1 (t) is for introducing the public education or aware the public with healthcare measures, v2 (t) is the control function for enhancement of the strength of treatment for the infected
individuals, v3 (t) is the control function for the necessary suggestions of health care measures for those who
are in asymptomatic infectious class and yet not admitted in the hospital.

Let us write the Hamiltonian function as follows:

307

H(S1 , E1 , ...R, vi , θ) = I + 12 (k1 v12 + k2 v22 + k2 v23 ) + θ1 [−(1 − v1 )(λI + λA + λQ + λL + λE2 )S] + θ2 [(1 −

8. Conclusions

320

Dierent mathematical paradigms can provide considerable insights and scientic evidences pertinent to

321

any ongoing epidemic dynamics. Based on those valuable information, health ocials and public health

322

experts can set up potential control strategies to battle against any epidemic. From the emergence of the

323

novel coronavirus in China, researchers and scientists are working relentlessly to develop various mathematical

324

modeling approaches to gain a deeper understanding on the progression dynamics of COVID-19 in the world.

325

In addition, in the absence of any safe, eective and widely available COVID-19 vaccine, dierent preventive

326

measures are the most eective tool in combating against the virulent virus. On the basis of robust forecasting

327

results of reliable epidemiological models, government ocials can deploy dierent public health intervention

328

strategies to control the rapid transmission of the virus. In this chapter, a compartmental mathematical has

329

been designed to describe the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 incorporating all possible real-life

330

interactions and eective non-pharmaceutical interventions. Disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of the proposed

331

model is found to be globally asymptotically stable (GAS), whenever control reproduction number (Rc ) less

332

than unity. In addition, advanced forecasting techniques have also been applied for Argentina, Bangladesh,

333

Brazil, Colombia and India to portray the future dynamics of the pandemic in near term. It has been

334

enlightened in our study that mass-level using of highly eective face coverings could be a crucial factor

335

in controlling the spread of coronavirus. Moreover, strict social-distancing measures and comprehensive

336

contact-tracing are also eective strategies in battling against this pandemic. The public health implication

337

of these insightful ndings is government ocials can undertake crucial clinical and public health decisions

338

by analyzing all mathematical results and scientic evidences. Caputo-Fabrizio non-integer order derivative

339

has been applied to solve the proposed mathematical model in fractional sense. We proved the existence

340

of unique solution for the proposed fractional initial value problem. We proved the unconditional stability

341

of the given technique. An important concern of fractional optimal control problem is given to suggest the

342

heath care measures for reducing the transmissibility of COVID-19 infection in the population.
