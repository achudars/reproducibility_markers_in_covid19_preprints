Abstract
Understanding the transmission dynamics and the severity of the novel coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) informs public health interventions, surveillance, and planning. Two important
parameters, the basic reproduction number (R0) and case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19, help
in this understanding process. The objective of this study was to estimate the R0 and CFR of
COVID-19 and assess whether the parameters vary in different regions of the world. We carried
out a systematic review to retrieve the published estimates of the R0 and the CFR in articles from
international databases between 1st January and 31st August 2020. Random-effect models and
Forest plots were implemented to evaluate the mean effect size of the R0 and the CFR.
Furthermore, the R0 and CFR of the studies were quantified based on geographic location, the
tests/thousand population, and the median population age of the countries where studies were
conducted. The I2 statistic and the Cochran's Q test were applied to assess statistical
heterogeneity among the selected studies. Forty-five studies involving R0 and thirty-four studies
involving CFR were included. The pooled estimation of the R0 was 2.69 (95% CI: 2.40, 2.98),
and that of the CFR was 2.67 (2.25, 3.13). The CFR in different regions of the world varied
significantly, from 2.51 (2.12, 2.95) in Asia to 7.11 (6.38, 7.91) in Africa. We observed higher
mean CFR values for the countries with lower tests (3.15 vs. 2.16) and greater median population
age (3.13 vs. 2.27). However, the R0 did not vary significantly in different regions of the world.
An R0 of 2.69 and CFR of 2.67 indicate the severity of the COVID-19. Although R0 and CFR
may vary over time, space, and demographics, we recommend considering these figures in
control and prevention measures.

Introduction

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, in late 2019, there
have been more than 35 million confirmed cases, and 950,000 confirmed deaths have been
reported as of 19 September 2020 [1]. The basic reproduction number (R0), used to measure the
transmission potential of a disease, can be used to inform public health policies. The R0 is defined
as the expected number of cases directly generated by one infected case in a population where all
individuals are susceptible [2,3]. Outbreaks will continue to propagate until this number falls
below 1.0. A timely and accurate assessment of COVID-19's R0 informs COVID is of great
significance for assessing the spread of the virus, predicting future trends, and adjusting a series
of control measures.
Another important factor to inform is the case fatality rate (CFR), which is the proportion
of deaths compared to the total number of people diagnosed with a disease within a defined
population of interest and is typically presented as a percentage [4]. CFR is an indicator of
disease severity and can be used to identify high-risk populations to inform targeted interventions
and the overall public health response [5].
To understand the transmissibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 in populations, there have been
several estimates of R0 and the CFR. Estimates of R0 and CFR have varied in different countries
and different settings [6]. For example, in the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the estimated
median R0 was 2.28 (95% CI: 2.06-2.52) [7]. In Wuhan, during the early phase of the outbreak,
the R0 was estimated as 2.24 (95% CI: 1.96-2.55) [8]. The R0 has also been estimated for several
other countries including Italy, 3.2 (95% CI: 2.9-3.5) [9]; USA, 5.3 (95% CI: 4.35-6.25) [10];
and, Japan, 2.6 (95% CI: 2.4-2.8) [11].

Likewise, estimates of CFRs have varied in different countries and phases of the
pandemic. A study found that at the start of the epidemic, CFR in China was 2%, but on 5 March
2020, it was increased to 3.7%. In South Korea, the same study reported the CFR as 0.6% on 5
March 2020 [12]. In Europe, during March 2020, Italy, Spain, and France had a CFR of 9.26%,
6.16%, and 4.21%, respectively [13]. Given the considerable variation in estimates of both these
parameters, in this current study, our aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis
of the published literature on the COVID-19 outbreak to provide summary statistics of the R0 and
the CFR, which have the best applicability for other countries or regions.

Methods

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2009. We registered the study protocol with the International prospective
register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) (registration number ID: CRD42020182867).
Search strategy
We systematically searched the major databases: LitCovid (a curated COVID-19
database of PubMed), PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from 1
January 2020 to 31 August 2020. We searched articles for “Basic reproduction number (R0)” and
“Case-fatality rate (CFR)” of the COVID-19 patients. For basic reproduction number, the search
terms were: “2019 novel coronavirus and COVID-19” AND “Basic reproduction number”, OR
“Basic reproduction rate” OR “R0”. For the case fatality rate, the search terms were “2019 novel
coronavirus and COVID-19” AND “case fatality rate”, OR “case fatality ratio”, OR “CFR”
according to the indices of the various databases (Supplementary Table S1). We also hand

searched included papers’ reference lists and contacted experts in the field to ensure a
comprehensive review. Records were managed by Mendeley version 1.19.4 software to exclude
duplicates.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Articles were selected if they reported CFR and/or R0 with a confidence interval of the
patients with COVID-19. The inclusion criteria for studies were laboratory-confirmed parents
with COVID-19; reported at sufficient sample size; considered all age-groups; and published in
English and any counties or regions of the world. Studies were excluded if they were: pre-prints;
reviews articles; editorials and case reports; letters to the editor and short communications; and
specific to children or pregnant women. However, we did not exclude some special populations
representative of the general population in a particular setting (e.g., Diamond Princess cruise
ship). The steps of the literature search are illustrated in Fig. 1.
Data screening and extraction
After excluding duplicate papers, two investigators (TA and AA) independently screened
the titles and abstracts using the eligibility criteria and then assessed the rest full-text articles for
eligibility. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with co-authors. A standardized
form was used to extract data from all eligible studies. For each selected articles, the following
information’s were extracted: publication details [title, first author, publication year, journal
name and publisher]; design and population [country, study design, study period, and sample
size]; participants’ characteristics and major findings [number of deaths, case fatality rate, basic
reproduction number, confidence interval, methods applied, standard deviation, and any other
relevant statistics]. Forty five research articles [7,9,20–29,10,30–39,11,40–49,14,50–54,15–19]

for R0 and 34 research articles [13,15,62–71,24,72–81,55,82–85,56–61] for CFR estimation were
selected.
Critical appraisal and publication bias
The critical appraisal of each selected study was assessed by TA and AA independently
using modified Risk of Bias (ROB) operational criteria (Supplementary Table S2 and Table S3)
[86]. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot, and the Egger’s test with P < 0.05 was an
indication of small-study effects.
Statistical analysis
We defined R0 as the expected number of cases directly generated by one infected case in
a population where all individuals are susceptible and CFR as the percentage of COVID-19 cases
that result in death. Background statistics of the COVID-19 patients were recorded through
frequency distribution analysis. A random-effect model was, therefore, used to perform a metaanalysis. The geo-location variations for R0 and geo-location, tests per thousand population, and
population median age variations for CRF were examined using subgroup analysis. The median
values of the frequency distributions were used as cut-off values of the sub-groups.
Heterogeneity was assessed among the selected studies using the Higgin’s & Thompson’s I2
statistic and Cochran's Q test. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata SE version 16.1
(Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA 5.

Results

We identified a total of 490 articles estimating R0. After considering the duplicates,
inclusion, and exclusion criteria, we reviewed these research articles. We searched for titles,

abstracts and keywords, methodology, and references and found 59 articles to investigate further
(Fig. 1). Out of these 59 articles, we found 45 research articles that reported 108 R0 estimates
ranging from 0.27 to 8.21 with related statistics for a meta-analysis (Supplementary Table S4).
Similarly, for the CFR, after considering filtering criteria, only 34 research articles out of 955
articles qualified for quantifying parameter values of CFR (Fig. 1), and these 34 articles provided
158 estimates of CFR ranging from 0.00 to 25.9 for use in the meta-analysis (Supplementary
Table S5). No studies were excluded.
Pooled estimation of the basic reproduction number (R0)
In the random-effects model, the pooled R0 for COVID-19 was estimated as 2.69 (2.40,
2.98), indicating that an infected person with COVID-19 can transmit the infection to on average
three susceptible people (Table 1, and Fig. 2). There was significant heterogeneity between
studies (I2: 99.96) (Table 1).
The outcome of subgroup analysis showed that the R0 value for Africa was 2.40 (0.96,
3.84), for Asia was 2.56 (2.19, 2.94), for ‘Europe’ was 2.70 (2.26, 3.13), for North America was
3.69 (1.46, 5.92), and for South America was 2.32 (2.07, 2.57) (Table 1). However, the test of
regional subgroup differences using the random-effects model confirms that the estimated mean
R0 values are not significantly different across these regions (p= 0.43). The Funnel plot for
assessing publication bias of R0 values computed from the random-effects model is shown in Fig.
3. This Funnel plot is indicating the existence of asymmetry and publication bias. Additionally,
the Egger’s test (P < 0.001) suggested the presence of small-study effects.
Pooled estimation of the Case fatality rate (CFR)
The pooled estimation of the CFR from the random-effects model was 2.67 (2.25, 3.13).
There was significant heterogeneity between studies (I2: 99.95, Q = 315324.53 with p = 0.00)

(Table 2, and Fig. 4). The high value of I2 statistic (99.95%) confirms a high level of betweenstudy heterogeneity.
The outcome of the subgroup analyses stratified by region showed that the CFR for
Africa was 7.11 (6.38, 7.91), for Asia was 2.51 (2.12, 2.95), and for Europe was 2.66 (1.83,
3.64), for North America was 3.40 (2.81, 4.04), and for South America was 2.89 (2.03, 3.89)
(Table 2). We observed higher mean CFR values for the countries with lower tests (3.15 vs.
2.16) and greater median population age (3.13 vs. 2.27). The subgroup difference tests using the
random-effects model are significant (Table 2). This confirms that the estimated mean CFR
values are significantly different across these subgroups. The Funnel plot for CFR values is
shown in Fig. 5. Though the Funnel plot is indicating asymmetry, the Egger test (P= 0.182)
suggested that there was no significant evidence of small-study effects.
However, if we exclude the extreme CFR values (reported in the included articles), the
pooled CFR estimation became 2.63 (2.24, 3.05). Furthermore, if we exclude the cases where
naïve CFR (estimated as the ratio of the deaths to the confirmed cases mentioned in the article) >
4, the pooled CFR estimation became 1.23 (0.97, 1.53).

Discussion

Our estimate of the R0 statistic implies that one infectious person can transmit the
infection to more than two and a half susceptible persons in a naïve population in the absence of
any control measures. However, the R0 did not vary significantly across the continents. Among
these regions, the highest R0 was estimated for ‘North America’ (3.69) and lowest for ‘South
America’ (2.32). We estimated a CFR of above two and a half, and the CFR varied in different
continents (highest 7.11 in Africa, lowest 2.51 in Asia). We further observed lower CFR values

of COVID-19 in the countries where a higher number of samples (per thousand population) were
tested, and higher CFR values where the median age of the national population was higher
(>38.7 years).
Our estimated overall R0 is slightly greater than WHO estimates of 1.4 to 2.5 [87] but
smaller than the results of the other studies, i.e., He et al. and Alimohamadi et al. estimated R0 as
3.15 (95% CI: 2.41‐3.90) and 3.32 (95% CI: 2.81 - 3.82), respectively [88,89]. Our estimation is
similar to the R0 values estimated for the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic (R0= 2–3)
but greater than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (R0 <1) [90]. However,
high R0 values tend to be estimated in the early stages of epidemics and pandemics due to small
sample sizes and incomplete information. Even if the overall R0 value in a population is low, the
likelihood of transmission in some subgroups of that population may still be high as the total
value of R0 in a population is the average of the R0 subtypes of that community.
Our estimated value for CFR is less than the WHO reported estimate of 3.4% [91] but
similar to the estimates of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC)
(2.3%) [92] and He et al. (2.72% with 95% CI:1.29%‐4.16%) [88]. Our estimated CFR is lower
than the CFR values estimated for the other severe coronavirus, severe acute respiratory
syndrome epidemic (9.6%), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (40%) [90], but higher
than that of influenza (0·1%) [93,94]. While multiple studies reported higher estimates of the
case fatality rate than ours, those estimates are typically higher than the actual case fatality rate,
as mild, atypical, and asymptomatic cases may not be identified (contrary to deaths), particularly
in countries where access to testing is limited [95]. For example, before 11 March 2020 in the
USA, sufficient, state-funded testing for all suspected cases was not available [96]. A study with
565 Japanese people who had been evacuated from Wuhan found that the number of infected

people is likely to be about ten times greater than the number of registered cases. The CFR
would then only be about one-tenth of that currently measured [97]. Our included studies may
suffer from bias of these higher numbers of unreported cases, which could increase the pooled
CFR estimation. Thus, we further estimated the CFR excluding the extreme values and the naive
CFR greater than four. These gave us lower CFR values close to one.
In our estimation, the CFR varied among different regions, but the R0 did not vary
significantly. We found lower CFR in the countries with a higher number of sample testing per
thousand population. A higher number of testing allowed detection of more pre-/a-symptomatic
and mild cases, which reduced the rate of fatal outcome [98]. We further found that countries
with higher median age had higher CFR value. Older age has been recognized as one of the most
common risk factors for a severe outcome of COVID-19 [99–101]. A study conducted with
5,484 patients in Italy found the CFR of COVID-19 was 0.43% for people below 70 years and
10.5% for people above 70 years and above [101]. Another study showed that an increase of 1%
population aged 65 years and above increased the risk of death due to COVID-19 by 10% [100].
An estimate of R0 is affected by several factors, including the proportion of the
susceptible population, population density, and awareness among people. Because SARS-COV-2
is a novel virus, we believe the proportion of the susceptible population remains the same across
the world; however, other factors (density and awareness) vary. The density of the population is
lower in European and North American countries compared with Asian counterparts. Thus, our
estimation of the R0 for non-significant variation came as a surprise. However, the early phase of
the pandemic produces incomplete data. Further studies on the R0 are essential to understand
how different lockdown measures, especially face covering, social distancing, and demographic

(population density) and environmental factors (temperature, humidity, UV light), affect the
transmission dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 [102–105].
For developing and populated countries, the R0 value of 2.69 indicates the rapid spread of
the COVID-19, and the CFR value of 2.67 is an indication of a relatively poor outcome of the
treatments. Necessary precautions and strategies such as preventing mass gatherings, restricting
the transportation system, and closing schools and universities should continue to prevent the
outbreak of this disease until a successful vaccine arrived.

Limitations

Some of the included studies were limited in terms of sample size, missing information
on the onset of COVID-19, and data availability. Therefore, the reported findings should be
interpreted cautiously within that context. Furthermore, our study was limited to the articles
published in the English language only. Considering the epicenter of COVID-19, Chinese
literature should be included in future systematic reviews. Another important limitation is the
case detection and testing heterogeneity. Countries' responses varied, and some countries are
facing difficulties in testing enough samples. Further, the quality of the testing samples also
varies in different countries. All these have affected the case detection and thus impacted the R0
and CFR. However, we believe the effects are minimum, and data across the world are still
comparable.

Conclusion

We estimated an R0 of 2.69 (95% CI: 2.40, 2.98) for SARS-CoV-2 and CFR of 2.67
(95% CI: 2.25, 3.13) for COVID-19 based on published literature from January to August 2020.
The analysis by subgroups of regions confirmed a significant CFR variation, but the same was
not found for the R0. Considering the estimated R0 and CFR values for COVID-19,
implementation of the social distancing program and other non-pharmaceutical interventions are
necessary steps to control the epidemic until an effective vaccine reaches to all susceptible
population.
