Abstract:
Background:

High rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been reported among patients with

novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Meanwhile there were controversies among different studies

about CVD burden in COVID-19 patients. Hence, we aimed to study CVD burden among COVID-19

patients, using a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods: We have systematically searched databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library,
Scopus, Web of Science as well as medRxiv pre-print database. Hand searched was also conducted in

descriptive meta-analysis on different CVDs.

Results:

Fifty-six studies entered into meta-analysis for ICU admission and mortality outcome and

198 papers for descriptive outcomes, including 159,698 COVID-19 patients. Results of meta-analysis

indicated that acute cardiac injury, (OR: 13.29, 95% CI 7.35-24.03), hypertension (OR: 2.60, 95% CI

2.11-3.19), heart Failure (OR: 6.72, 95% CI 3.34-13.52), arrhythmia (OR: 2.75, 95% CI 1.43-5.25),

coronary artery disease (OR: 3.78, 95% CI 2.42-5.90), and cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.61, 95% CI

1.89-3.62) were significantly associated with mortality. Arrhythmia (OR: 7.03, 95% CI 2.79-17.69),

acute cardiac injury (OR: 15.58, 95% CI 5.15-47.12), coronary heart disease (OR: 2.61, 95% CI 1.09-

Introduction:
Coronaviruses are enveloped positive sense single stranded RNA viruses which cause respiratory

infections in human and animals (1-3). There were six coronaviruses known to cause infection in

humans (4), including Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), China, 2002 (5) and Middle Eastern

Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Saudi Arabia, 2012 (6, 7). The World Health Organization (WHO)

reported cases of pneumonia with unknown source in Wuhan, China, December 2019 (8). Further

investigations in samples of patients with respiratory infection, who were in contact with a seafood

markets in Wuhan revealed a novel virus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

th

(SARS-CoV-2) (9). On 11

March, 2020 WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a pandemic (10).

It has been estimated that 1.7 billion people (22% world population) have at least one underlying

condition, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which increases the risk of developing severe

disease in case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (11).

There is a mutual relationships between CVD and infections (12, 13), while the viral respiratory

infectious diseases like influenza might increase the risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular

events (13), underlying CVD might increase the risk of mortality among patients with infection (14).

Reports from COVID-19 disease including a large number of patients showed that fatality rate was

10.5% for CVD and 6.0% for hypertension among 72314 cases of COVID-19 (15). Studies indicated

that there is an increased risk of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients due to CVD (16-

18).

Given the increasing number of COVID-19 patients besides from common clinical presentations of

disease, CVD in COVID-19 infected patients are seems to be concerning (16). We aimed to assess the

CVD burden of COVID-19, using a systematic review and meta-analysis method in this study.

Results of meta-analysis indicated that presence of Acute Cardiac Injury (OR: 13.29, 95% CI 7.35-

24.03), Coronary Artery Disease (OR: 3.78 95% CI 2.42-5.90), Arrhythmia (OR: 2.75, 95% CI 1.43-

and

Cardiovascular Disease (OR: 2.61, 95% CI 1.89-3.62) were significantly associated with mortality in

COVID-19 patients (Table 2).

Intensive care unit admission
Pooled prevalence of cardiovascular implications including Acute Cardiac Injury, Arrhythmia, Heart

Failure, Coronary Artery Disease, Hypertension and Cardiovascular Diseases were 33.6%, 33.0%,

20.4%, 20.6%, 43.6% and 25.0% in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU respectively (Table 3).

The meta-analysis on ICU outcome showed that the odds of ICU admission in COVID-19 patients is

significantly associated with Acute Cardiac Injury (OR: 15.58, 95% CI 5.15 - 47.12), Arrhythmia (OR:

7.03, 95% CI 2.79 - 17.69), Coronary Heart Disease (OR: 2.61, 95% CI 1.09 - 6.26), Cardiovascular

Disease (OR: 3.11, 95% CI 1.59 - 6.09) and Hypertension (OR: 1.95, 95% CI 1.41 - 2.68). Heart Failure

was not statistically significantly (OR: 2.44, 95% CI 0.67 - 8.79) associated with ICU admission in

COVID-19 however, the effect size was considerable (Table 4).

Discussion:
The results of this meta-analysis indicated cardiovascular implications including acute cardiac injury,

arrhythmia,

coronary

heart disease,

hypertension and cardiovascular

diseases

were

significantly

associated with COVID-19 patient’s admission to the ICU. Comparing pooled estimate of OR for CVDs

showed odds of ICU admission was significantly higher in acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia than

hypertension, but there was no significant difference between other cardiovascular implications.

Investigations have shown that mortality in patients with acute cardiac injury was significantly higher

than coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, and hypertension.

Comparing estimated frequency of

different cardiovascular complications including acute cardiac injury, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy,

coronary heart disease, heart palpitation, hypertension, myocardial damage, heart failure and other

cardiovascular diseases did not show any significant difference among them.

Acute myocardial injury was significantly associated with both ICU admission and mortality. There

were several etiologies proposed for acute myocardial injury in these patients. The first possible

mechanism is myocardial injury caused by cytokine storm as the results of systematic inflammation

mediated by pathologic T-cells (221-223). Study by Chen

et al.

(25) showed elevated myocardial

injury biomarkers including NT-proBNP, cTnI and hs-CRP were significantly correlated with COVID-19

severity. The second possible explanation is the imbalance between supply and demand caused by

SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 causes activation of renin-angiotensin system and its complications

including hypertension, heart failure, and atherosclerosis (220, 227, 228) as we resulted in our meta-

analysis. These data could also suggest a reason for high prevalence of hypertension in our pooled

estimate. Underlying CVDs like hypertension could higher the risk of infection and developing more

severe symptoms in COVID-19 patients (229). We showed in our meta-analysis that hypertension

was significantly associated with ICU admission and mortality; therefore blood pressure control

could be potentially beneficial to reduce disease burden (230). Using Angiotensin Receptor Blockers

(ARBs) and ACE inhibitors in order to control hypertension have raised question in the era of the

COVID-19 pandemic. Studies suggested

which exaggerates pro-inflammatory condition, predisposing them to

severe conditions and mortality (233).

Arrhythmia was significantly associated with ICU admission and mortality in our meta-analysis. There

are pathophysiological mechanisms suggested for arrhythmia among COVID-19 patients; however,

whether these patients had pre-existing arrhythmia or secondary to COVID-19 remains unknown

(234).

we have discussed earlier myocardial injury has been an important subject in COVID-19 patients. It

has been suggested that myocardial damage can be potentially triggers arrhythmia (236, 237). Third,

pharmacological therapies prescribed for these patients can be potential risk factors for arrhythmia.

reported that some patients have presented with heart palpitations and chest tightness instead of

cough and fever as initial symptoms of COVID-19 (229); so, heart palpitations in outpatients setting

needs to carefully considered as potential symptom of COVID-19.

Heart failure was significantly associated with mortality in our meta-analysis, ranked after acute

cardiac injury. The incidence of heart failure might be as the consequence of myocardial injury or

myocarditis (240), which has been previously discussed. Increasing systemic metabolic demand as

the results of systemic infection could also exacerbate previous stable heart failure (221). Right heart

Cardiomyopathy has been also observed in COVID-19 patients in various forms. Takotsubo syndrome

(TTS) or stress cardiomyopathy, characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction, is triggered

by emotional and physical stresses following to natural disasters (241), like COVID-19 pandemic.

There were number of studies reported TTS in COVID-19 patients (242-246). Mechanism of stress

cardiomyopathy in COVID-19 patients might be due to emotional distress caused by pandemic along

with inflammatory and metabolic distress (244). Inflammatory cardiomyopathy or myocarditis was

Coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients (226) can also cause acute coronary syndrome in these patients.

We have discussed cardiovascular implications among COVID-19 patients. Cardiovascular diseases

have significant role in the outcome of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, careful consideration and

management of cardiovascular disease, from diagnosis to bedside, among COVID-19 patients are

necessary. Results of this study could help policy makers, physicians and healthcare workers in front

line to make evidence-based decisions and reduce the mortality and morbidity of this 21

pandemic.

Limitation of this study was high heterogeneity of studies in population. Compounding effects of

other co-morbidities in ICU admission and mortality was not being considered. It is possible that

other co-morbidities related to respiratory system, renal system and gastrointestinal system affects

patient’s condition. Cardiovascular implications could be pre-existing in patients or either developed

by the infection; so, we could not determine the casual relationship. However, given the burden and

In conclusion, CVD have a significant role in disease severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients.

Hypertension,

acute

cardiac

injury,

coronary

heart

diseases

in

COVID-19

patient

needs

to

be

carefully monitored and managed in case of acute conditions. Other cardiovascular implications,

including arrhythmia and heart failure also need to be considered since they can be fatal. Therefore,

careful

consideration

and

management

of

cardiovascular

disease

among

these

patients

are

necessary. Results of this study could help policy makers, physicians and healthcare workers in front

line to make evidence-based decisions and reduce the mortality and morbidity of this 21

st

century

pandemic.

Conflicts of interests:
