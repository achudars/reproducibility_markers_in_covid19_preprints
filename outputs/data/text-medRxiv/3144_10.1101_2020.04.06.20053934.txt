Abstract
Estimating the percentages of undiagnosed and asymptomatic patients is essential for
controlling the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, and for assessing any strategy for controlling
the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel analysis based on the birth-death
process with recursive full tracing. We estimated the numbers of undiagnosed
symptomatic patients and total infected individuals per diagnosed patient before and
after the declaration of the state of emergency in Hokkaido, Japan. The median of the
estimated number of undiagnosed symptomatic patients per diagnosed patient
decreased from 1.9 to 0.77 after the declaration, and the median of the estimated
number of total infected individuals per diagnosed patient decreased from 4.7 to 2.4.
We will discuss the limitations and possible expansions of the model.

Introduction

1

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spread to the most populated areas of the world
in the first few months of 2020. In Japan, the first case was reported on January 16th,
2020; on March 31st, the number of cases increased to 2122 [1]. In Hokkaido, the
largest prefecture of Japan, the first case was reported on January 28th, 2020 (Fig 1).
The Hokkaido government declared a state of emergency on February 28th and lifted
it on March 19th. The state of emergency was not legally binding, and the government
asked the residents to stay home on the weekends. Until the state of emergency was
lifted, a total of 157 cases were reported. Although the number of diagnosed cases is
declining towards the end of March, the situation remains uncertain.

To effectively control the spread of the infection, we need to know several
parameter values characterizing the infection, such as the basic reproduction number,
R0 , the percentage of asymptomatic patients, and the fatality rate. One of the factors

that complicate the decision making in disease control is the uncertainty in the
percentage of asymptomatic patients. Several lines of evidence indicate that the virus
can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients [2, 3], who may have facilitated the
spread of SARS-CoV-2. To make the disease control strategy successful and less
harmful to the society, the transmissibility of asymptomatic patients and the
percentage of asymptomatic patients should be measured. Another complicating
factor is the uncertainty in the percentages of diagnosed and undiagnosed patients.
Most individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 suffer from mild cold-like symptoms and
recover without any medical intervention. They remain undiagnosed, disturbing how
we monitor the number of total infected individuals. Thus, estimating the percentages
of asymptomatic and undiagnosed patients is a challenging problem to be answered in
epidemiology.
It would be useful if these values could be estimated by the information available in
the early phase of the outbreak. Contact tracing is considered to be one of the
effective measures, and health officials have conducted contact tracing of infected
patients to prevent the spread of the virus infection for outbreaks of new or
reemerging infections [4–9]. If an infected patient is found, health officials try to find
other infected people among those who have come into contact with the infected
patient. If any other infected patients are found, officials will repeat tracing from the
newly found patients; and if not, tracing is stopped. Thus, a “cluster” of infected
patients connected by the route of infection is constructed through the process of
contact tracing. Simultaneously, the dates of onset and diagnosis are obtained for each
diagnosed patient. As a result, contact tracing can provide detailed qualitative and
quantitative information about diagnosed patients from the infectious disease
transmission network of diagnosed and undiagnosed patients. Analyzing this network
with an appropriate model may enable us to estimate the parameter values of the
infection.
One promising model for contact tracing is a stochastic model based on the
birth-death process, which is a formulation of branching processes [10–17], because the
number of cases in the early phase stochastically fluctuates and the widely used
differential-equation-based models are inapplicable. In birth-death processes, a
sequence of infectious events generates a tree whose nodes are infected patients and
edges are infection routes (Fig 2). When a patient recovers (Fig 2, dotted circle), the
corresponding node and its edges are removed from the tree, which is split into two.
The infectious disease transmission network is composed of trees. A connected
component of the network is referred to as “cluster” in this paper. Contact tracing
corresponds to finding a node in the tree and removing nodes connected to the first
node found (Fig 2, gray filled circle). There are various types of contact tracing based
on how to choose nodes to be removed, including backward, forward, or full tracing,
and recursive or one-step tracing [17]. We consider only recursive full tracing, that is,
all nodes directly and indirectly connected to the first found node are removed (Fig 2,
dashed rounded rectangle). We propose an analysis based on the birth-death process
with recursive full tracing that takes advantage of information obtained by contact
tracing to estimate epidemiological parameter values with a small set of data. We
focus on the contact tracing of infected individuals in Hokkaido. The present analysis
uses the distributions of the cluster size and patients’ time from onset to diagnosis,
which are released by the health officials, to estimate the model parameters. Our
approach directly models the stochastic dynamics, which is an inherent property of the
early phase of the outbreak.
This paper is organized as follows. In the Methods section, we summarize the
SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hokkaido and divide it into those before and after the
declaration of the state of emergency. We classify patients into symptomatic and

This paper reports the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hokkaido, Japan [18].
In Hokkaido, all cases had not traveled abroad recently except for three cases, which
include a tourist from Wuhan, China. We concentrate our analysis on the cases whose
onset was prior to the lifting of the state of emergency. We excluded the cases with an
unknown onset and asymptomatic patients from the analysis. If the date of the
diagnosis of a case was not reported, it was assumed to coincide with the date of the
announcement. S1 Table summarizes the case reports released by the Novel
Coronavirus Response Headquarters of the Hokkaido government until April 2nd, 2020.
We represent the patients with nodes and their contacts with edges in a network. If
two patients were in close contact with each other, the corresponding nodes are
connected by an edge. The network consists of distinct connected components, which
we refer to as clusters. Sporadic patients are regarded as size-1 clusters. Fig 3 shows
the clusters with sizes larger than 2 in Hokkaido. There are 76 size-1 clusters and 20
size-2 clusters along with the clusters shown in Fig 3 (S1 Table).

circles represent the patients in dataset 1 and 2, respectively. The numbers in the
circles are the case IDs. Two circles are connected by an edge if these two patients
were in close contact with each other.
All cases were divided into datasets 1 and 2 according to which cluster they belong
to. If the earliest onset of the cases in a cluster was prior to the declaration of the
state of emergency, this cluster was included in dataset 1; if the earliest onset was
between the declaration and the lifting thereof, it was included in dataset 2. Datasets
1 and 2 contain 78 and 30 clusters, respectively. Because the declaration of the state of
emergency might have changed the behavior of residents and health officials in
Hokkaido, we compared the data before the declaration, dataset 1, and the data
between the declaration and the lifting thereof, dataset 2.

The patients included in datasets 1 and 2 were all diagnosed and mostly
symptomatic. However, not all of the individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 were
diagnosed and symptomatic; they can be classified into diagnosed symptomatic,
diagnosed asymptomatic, undiagnosed symptomatic, and undiagnosed asymptomatic
groups. The diagnosed symptomatic group consists of those who developed symptoms
and were diagnosed, or those who were found in contact tracing. All individuals
belonging to this group were covered by our datasets. Although the diagnosed
asymptomatic group was also included in the datasets, we ignored this group because
this group included only two individuals. The undiagnosed symptomatic group is
comprised of individuals who were infected and developed symptoms, but recovered or
died without being diagnosed. This group is not directly observable, and thus its
percentage is one of the parameters we tried to estimate with the model, which takes
this group into account. The undiagnosed asymptomatic group is not directly
observable either. It has been suggested that a percentage of SARS-CoV-2 carriers do
not develop symptoms but can infect others [2, 19]. We did not explicitly incorporate
the asymptomatic group into the model but estimated its percentage.
We modeled the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with a variant of the continuous-time
birth-death process, referred to as the birth-death process with recursive full
tracing [17]. Birth-death processes have been used to model infectious diseases and
population dynamics [10, 11, 16, 17]. Continuous-time birth-death processes consist of a
network whose nodes and edges are continually generated and removed (Fig 2). The
lifetime of a node is a random variable drawn from the exponential distribution with
the scale parameter 1/γ. During its lifetime, a node gives birth to nodes according to
a Poisson point process with the stationary rate β ′ and is connected to these offspring
nodes (Fig 2, green circle). When the lifetime of a node ends, the node and its edges
are removed from the network (Fig 2, dotted circle). For the infection dynamics of
SARS-CoV-2, the nodes and their birth and death can be regarded as symptomatic
patients and their onset of symptoms or infection and recovery from the disease. In
the limit of an infinite number of nodes, the dynamics of the number of nodes of
birth-death processes are approximated by the SIR model. Asymptomatic infected
individuals are not included in this model, and the incubation period is ignored.
The birth-death process with recursive full tracing incorporates the diagnosis and
quarantine of patients in addition to the features of continuous-time birth-death
processes. The time from infection to diagnosis of a node is a random variable drawn
from the exponential distribution with the scale parameter 1/κ. If the diagnosis occurs
earlier than the recovery, the node is removed from the network at the diagnosis,
representing the quarantine of the diagnosed patient (Fig 2, gray filled circle). At the
same time, the nodes in the connected component containing the diagnosed node are
also removed from the network, which corresponds to the contact tracing of the
infected individuals (Fig 2, gray open circles). Infections that are to be caused by
these removed nodes later than the removal are abolished because the diagnosed
individuals are quarantined. The connected component of the diagnosed individuals
corresponds to the clusters in the datasets (Fig 2, dashed rounded rectangle). The
nodes in the connected component are counted among diagnosed symptomatic groups.
The recovery of a node disconnects its neighboring nodes. For example, if the green
node in Fig 2 is diagnosed, the cluster of size 2 but not of size 4 is reported. A node is
not diagnosed if it has been already removed. If a node recovers before it is diagnosed,
this node is counted among undiagnosed symptomatic groups.
The simulation of the model is implemented as follows. Nodes without edges are
generated in the network according to a Poisson point process with the stationary rate
λ = 10−5 (Fig 2, blue circle). The value of λ is inconsequential if it is small enough to
allow for observing the cluster size and time from onset to diagnosis distribution at

where the recovery rate γ and the diagnosis rate κ are positive constants. During
t0i ≤ t ≤ min(tri , tdi ), node i generates new nodes and connects to them according to a
Poission point process with the stationary rate β ′ > 0. At t = tri , if node i is present in
the network, node i and its edges are removed from the network. At t = tdi , if node i is
present in the network, the nodes in the same connected component containing node i
and their edges are removed from the network.
Let us note that β ′ is the rate of infection giving rise to symptomatic patients, not
the rate of infection giving rise to symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. This is
because all nodes in the model are capable of being diagnosed, which is not the case
with asymptomatic individuals. Hence, β, the rate of infection giving rise to any type
of patient is greater than β ′ . For κ = 0, the probability that a node directly infects n
nodes, that is, the probability that a symptomatic patient directly infects n
symptomatic patients, follows

whose expected value is β ′ /γ. Similarly, the basic reproduction number R0 is given by
β/γ. Thus, β must be greater than γ because the number of reported cases is steadily
increasing, that is,
R0 = β/γ > 1.
(4)
Throughout the simulations reported in this paper, γ was fixed to 1/14 [20–22].
We performed the approximate Bayesian computation of the posterior distribution
of κ and β ′ given the average cluster size and the average time from onset to diagnosis.
We drew β ′ from U(0.001, 0.2) and κ from U(0.001, 0.12) and accepted the parameter
sets with which the average cluster size was identical to 126/78 for dataset 1 and
43/30 for dataset 2, and the average time from onset to diagnosis lied within ±1 days
of 9.3 for dataset 1 and 6.6 for dataset 2. The cluster size is defined as the number of
nodes of the cluster. The average time from onset to diagnosis is defined as the
average of tdi − t0i where i runs over the nodes that are diagnosed first in the cluster.
In each run of the simulation, we removed C0 + C clusters of diagnosed
symptomatic patients, of which the first C0 = 100 clusters were discarded to eliminate
the dependence of the results on the initial condition and used the following C = 78
(dataset 1) and C = 30 (dataset 2) clusters as the simulated clusters of patients in
Hokkaido. This procedure is justified by the fact that the average cluster size of
birth-death processes converges to its steady-state value on a timescale of 1/β and
1/γ [11]. This fact also suggests that the properties of clusters in the early phase of
the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 can be described by the steady-state of the model.
The ratio of undiagnosed symptomatic patients to diagnosed symptomatic patients
can be estimated by the number of nodes that recover without being diagnosed in a
period divided by the number of diagnosed nodes that recover in the same period. We
used the period between the removal of the C0 -th cluster and the removal of the
C0 + C-th cluster to calculate the ratio. This period is referred to as the target period
in the following. The ratio of the number of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients

Eq 4, and β > β ′ , the lower bound of the number of all infected individuals that
recover in the target period is estimated by the number of diagnosed and undiagnosed
symptomatic patients that recover in the period multiplied by max(γ, β ′ )/β ′ . The
estimates presented in this paper are rounded to two significant digits.

We performed simulations with randomly generated 100 000 parameter sets and
accepted the parameter sets that replicated the average cluster size and the average
time from onset to diagnosis. We chose these two indices as those that are used to fit
the model parameters for two reasons. First, these can be obtained without using
sophisticated techniques. Second, these two indices enable us to determine the
parameter values of β ′ and κ. Before applying the parameter estimation to datasets 1
and 2, we tested it for the indices obtained from a simulation run with β ′ = 0.1 and
κ = 0.05. The orange crosses, blue triangles, and filled circles in Fig 4A indicate the
parameter sets that replicated the average cluster size, the average time from onset to
diagnosis, and both together, respectively. This figure shows that the filled circles are
concentrated on the intersection of the bands of crosses and triangles. The 95%
credible intervals for β ′ and κ were [0.081, 0.14] and [0.033, 0.081], respectively, which
successfully contain the parameter set that was used in the original simulation.
Figs 4B and 4C present the parameter sets that replicated the average cluster size
and the average time from onset to diagnosis of datasets 1 and 2, respectively. The
95% credible intervals for β ′ and κ were [0.035, 0.062] and [0.012, 0.041] for dataset 1,
and [0.027, 0.092] and [0.028, 0.11] for dataset 2. In dataset 1, the median of the
estimated value of κ, 0.024, was far less than γ, suggesting that most of the
symptomatic patients were not diagnosed before their recovery. The median of the
estimated value of κ in dataset 2, 0.063, implies that a larger percentage of
symptomatic patients were diagnosed in dataset 2.

To examine the number of undiagnosed symptomatic patients, we calculated the
number of nodes that recovered without being diagnosed in the target period. Fig 5A

[1.0, 3.6] (median 1.9) for dataset 1 and [0.34, 2.0] (median 0.77) for dataset 2. The
lower bound of the number of all infected individuals is estimated by the number of
diagnosed and undiagnosed symptomatic patients multiplied by max(γ, β ′ )/β ′
(Fig 5B, D). The 95% credible intervals of the total number of infected individuals per
diagnosed patient were [2.6, 8.6] (median 3.7) for dataset 1 and [1.4, 5.8] (median 2.4)
for dataset 2, the former of which is consistent with a previous estimate, 1/0.14 [23].
These estimates suggest that around half of infected individuals remain asymptomatic,
which is consistent with a previous estimate [19]. The 95% credible intervals of the
total numbers of infected individuals who recovered before the declaration of the state
of emergency and those who recover between the declaration and lifting were
[330, 1100] (median 600) and [61, 250] (median 100), respectively.

Discussion

217

In this paper, we have formulated a model to describe the spreading of infection and
the quarantine of infected individuals, and estimated the number of undiagnosed
symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in Hokkaido. The estimated
percentages of undiagnosed symptomatic and asymptomatic patients coincided with
previous studies [23, 24]. The estimated total number of patients that recovered before
the declaration of a state of emergency was also consistent with a previous study,
which estimated that there were 940 patients in Hokkaido on February 25th [25]. One
of the previous studies approximated the time evolution of the number of infected
individuals with differential equations [23], while another estimated the number of
asymptomatic patients by using RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction) test results of evacuees from Wuhan, China on chartered flights [24]. The
present analysis focuses on the stochastic dynamics of a discrete number of infected
individuals. Thus, the size distribution of clusters, which is a piece of information
available in the early phase of the pandemic but difficult to use in
differential-equation-based models, can be utilized by the model. Although the
methods of the previous reports and ours are completely different, quantitative
agreement between them suggests the effectiveness of these approaches.
There are several reasons we have chosen the cases in Hokkaido as the subject of
this paper. Hokkaido is an island isolated from the other regions of Japan. In other
words, we can assume that a relatively small percentage of the population commutes
between Hokkaido and other parts of the world. This makes Hokkaido an ideal subject
of the investigation. Until March 20th, one day after the lifting of the state of
emergency, 1549 out of 1707 individuals tested with RT-PCR turned out to be
negative for SARS-CoV-2 [26], indicating that extensive contact tracing was
performed. On the other hand, among the 158 cases diagnosed until March 19th in
Hokkaido, only two were asymptomatic. This suggests that in most contact tracing in
Hokkaido, RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were conducted only on symptomatic
patients because of restricted resources. The claim by the local government that test
capability was strengthened after the declaration of the state of emergency [27] is
supported by a larger value of κ in dataset 2 than in dataset 1.
One of the features of the present model is its simplicity. The model has only three
essential parameters. The simplicity of the model allowed us to estimate the number
of asymptomatic and undiagnosed patients without using a large number of parameter
values estimated by previous studies. In the early phase of the spreading of infectious
diseases, this simple model can enable the estimation of the asymptomatic and
undiagnosed patients despite limited data. Our approach can estimate the number of
patients without using costly and time-consuming techniques such as RT-PCR.
Also, its simplicity might allow for an analytical solution. The model is an
extension of the birth-death processes, which has been studied intensively. The
birth-death processes with contact tracing is analytically tractable [10, 11, 16, 17].
Because the model is simple enough, we may be able to obtain the analytical solution
of the cluster size distribution and the expected time from onset to diagnosis. The
analytical solution would enable us to efficiently estimate the parameter values.
The simplicity of the present model allows expansions in several ways. First, we
assumed that β ′ is a fixed value in this paper. This is justified by Fig 3, which shows

that the largest number of individuals infected by an individual, that is, the largest
degree of nodes, is eight, which is rather small. However, β ′ may be heterogeneous.
Heterogeneity in β ′ , which has been suggested for the coronavirus genus [28, 29], may
explain the superspreader phenomenon. Also, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 might be
more accurately modeled with the contact process on scale-free networks [30, 31]. The
value of β ′ might depend on the severity of the patient [23]. Second, the recovery rate
γ may depend on the severity of the patient. Heterogeneity in γ can affect the
estimated number of total infected individuals. Third, the incubation period, which is
ignored in the present paper, might affect the size and structure of clusters [32].
Infectiousness in the incubation period should be included in the model [32]. Fourth,
the stage of symptoms should be introduced into the model. Fig 6 suggests that the
time from onset to diagnosis obeys a unimodal distribution with a peak at around 10
days, although the peak must be at 0 in the present model. Assuming that a mildly
infected state stochastically develops into a severely infected state would explain this
time course. Fifth, recursive full tracing might be unrealistic because some of the
symptomatic patients can be missed in contact tracing. Introducing stochasticity into
contact tracing can enable a more precise modeling of clusters. These extensions
would be useful in monitoring and controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
