Abstract
Background: COVID-19 has been the greatest challenge the world has faced since the second
world war. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of COVID-19 in both space
and time in Malawi.
Methods: The study used publicly available data of COVID-19 cases for the period from 24th
June to 20th August, 2020. Semiparametric spatial temporal models were fitted to the number of
weekly confirmed cases as an outcome data, with time and location as independent variables.
Results: The study found significant main effect of location and time with the two interacting.
The spatial distribution of COVID-19 showed major cities being at greater risk than rural areas.
Over time the COVID-19 risk was increasing then decreasing in most districts with the rural
districts being consistently at lower risk.
Conclusion. Future or present strategies to avert the spread of COVID-19 should target major
cities by limiting international exposure. In addition, the focus should be on time points that had
shown high risk.
Key words: parametric, nonparametric, separable, inseparable, interaction

Introduction
COVID-19 is a corona virus disease (COVID which was first reported in Wuhan, China in 2019.
It is characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) hence also known as SARSCOV -2 (WHO, 2020). Since its onset, COVID-19 has been one of the greatest disease
pandemics of all times. From its discovery in December in China, 19 718 030 people world over
have been confirmed of the disease and over 722 285 people have died as of 9 August 2020
(WHO, 2020). The space trend worldwide has shown the Americas (10 590 929), Europe (3 3
582 911) and South East Asia (2 632 773) being the hardest hit as of 10th August, 2020. Africa
had a slow progression of the disease at the beginning of the disease, earlier 2020, but the
continent had rising cases in the middle of the year, 2020, with 895 696 confirmed cases and 16
713 deaths as of 10th August, 2020. Malawi at this time of the year had recorded 5193 confirmed
cases and 163 deaths (UNICEF Malawi, 2020b). The first three cases of COVID-19 were
recorded on 2nd April, 2020 (UNICEF Malawi, 2020a).
Understanding disease space and time dynamics is important for the epidemiologists as with
space distribution, the hot spot areas are marked for intervention. In addition, possible drivers of
the epidemic in those hot spots are suggested for further scientific investigation. Regarding
temporal distribution, times with high disease risk are also identified which gives crew to
possible causes including, in particular, seasonal changes. A number of studies on spatial
temporal distribution of COVID-19 have been conducted (Chen et al, 2020; Yang et al, 2020;
Gayawan et al, 2020; Martellucci et al, 2020; Adekunle et al, 2020, Arashi et al, 2020; Kumar et
al, 2020; Briz-Redón and Serrano-Aroca, 2020; Diop et al, 2020; Jia et al, 2020; Xie at al, 2020;
Likassa, 2020; Sarfo and Karuppannan, 2020; Daw et al, 2020; Ye and Hu, 2020). The majority
of these though have used the geographical information system (GIS) technology as compared to
statistical modelling using spatial temporal models. A few studies that have used the statistical
approach to spatial temporal analysis to my knowledge are Gayawan et al (2020) who used the
Possion hurdle model to take into account excess zero counts of COVID-19 cases, Briz-Redon
and Serrano Aroca (2020) who used the separable random effects model with structured and
unstructured area and time effects, and Chen et al (2020) who used the inseparable spatial
temporal model. In addition, in Africa, spatial temporal analysis of COVID-19 cases has been
limited (Gawayan et al, 2020; Arashi et al, 2020; Adeneknle et al, 2020) as of 9th August. In
Malawi, at the time of this study, no study on spatial temporal distribution of COVID-19 cases
had been spotted. Only one study that focused on prediction of COVID-19 cases using
mathematical models was seen (Kuunika, 2020). The aim of this study was to determine the
spatial temporal trends of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Malawi while using the spatial
temporal statistical models. The objectives of the study were:
• To establish the estimated or predicted risk trend by geographical location
• To estimate the temporal risk trend of COVID-19 by geographical location.

The article has been organized as follows. First, study methods are described in terms of data
collection and statistical analysis. Thereafter, results and discussion of results are presented.
Finally conclusions and implications regarding the findings of the study are made.
Materials and Methods
Data
The study used the publicly available districts’ COVID-19 confirmed daily cases data for
Malawi which was extracted from the Malawi data portal website
(https://malawi.opendataforafrica.org) after registering with the portal. The total population,
population density, and percentage of people with running water data for each district were also
extracted from the same data portal. The population size for each district was used as the
expected number of people to be infected in each district. Population density and percentage of
people with running water in each district were taken as covariates. Though the cases started to
be recorded on 2nd April, 2020, the extracted data for COVID-19 cases used for spatial temporal
modelling in this study, only covered the period from 24th June to 20th August. This was the case,
considering that COVID-19 daily cases for the districts were only available from 24th June on the
portal. The study period was divided into six weeks as follows: week 1 (24/06/20 – 02/07/20),
week 2 (02/07/20 – 09/07/20), week 3 (09/07/20 – 16/07/20), week 4 (16/07/20 – 23/07/20),
week 5 (23/07/20 – 11/08/20) and week 6 (11/08/20 – 20/08/20). The daily cases were then
aggregated at week level to make week the unit of analysis for time. The Malawi data portal is a
web based data storage system that displays data on main indicators of the country. No any other
permission was required to publish the results of the analysis.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive analysis involved the time series plot of the cumulative confirmed cases and those
who had died of COVID-19 for the whole country from the beginning of the epidemic to the
time this study was conducted, that is, 20th August, 2020. It also involved bivariate correlation of
daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 and their potential covariates, that is, population size,
population density and percentage of people with running water in each district. The potential
covariates would be selected for further multiple variable modelling if their p-values were less
than 0.20. After the descriptive analysis, the multiple variable spatial temporal models were
fitted in R using the Bayesian approach while using the integrated nested laplace approximations
(INLA). INLA estimation of Bayesian hierarchical models is proved to be faster than the use of
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. A spatial temporal model assuming linear trend
of cases over time as proposed by (Bernardinelli et al, 1995) was first fitted. That is, let y ij be
the observed disease cases in region i and at timet , then the observed disease cases have the
Poisson distribution with the data model defined as y it ~ Poisson (eit rit ) , where eit rit is the mean
of disease cases, eit and rit are the expected disease cases and relative risk respectively. The
model of the relative risk is then defined as log(rit ) = η it where η it is the predictor specified as

η it = μ + u i + vi + (φ + ϕ i )t ,

The model with predictor (1) will be denoted by A. In (1), μ is the overall disease relative risk,
u i is the area level unstructured random effect and vi is the area level structured random effect,
and φ is overall time trend and ϕ i is the area specific time trend. The unstructured area level
effects were modelled by the independent normal distribution with zero mean, that is,
u i ~ N (0, σ u2 ) , and the structured random effects were assigned the intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) according to Besag (1991), that is, vi | v j∈Θi ~

The

weakness of model A is the linearity assumption on the effect of time on the relative risk of the
disease. To take a more flexible approach on the effect of time, nonlinear spatial temporal
models were also explored. The predictor,η it for the nonlinear spatial temporal model for the
time effect is specified as follows:

η it = μ + u i + vi + γ t + β t + δ it ,

(2)

and let it be denoted by B. The u i and vi in the model are the area level unstructured and
structured effects respectively as defined in (1), and γ t and β t are the unstructured and
structured temporal effects. The unstructured time effects was modelled by the independent
normal distribution with zero mean, that is, γ t ~ N (0, σ λ2 ) and the structured temporal effects
were assigned the first order random walk prior distribution defined as:

A second order random walk was also explored in case

the data would show a more pronounced linear trend. The second order random walk is defined
as: π ( β | σ β ) ∝

The last term in (2), δ it , represents the

interaction between area and time. Four forms of interaction between space and time are possible
according to Knorr-Held (2000). The first form of interaction assumes interaction between the
unstructured region effect ( u i ) and the unstructured temporal effect ( γ t ) (denote it by model B
1), and in this case the interaction effect is assigned the independent normal distribution, that is,
δ it ~ N (0, σ δ2 ) . The second type of interaction, is the interaction of structured area effect ( vi )
and the unstructured temporal effect ( γ t ) (denote it by model B 2). This form of interaction
assumes conditional intrinsic (CAR) distribution for the areas for each time independently
from all the other times. The third is the interaction between unstructured area effect ( u i ) and
the structured temporal effect ( β t ) (denote this by model B 3). The prior distribution for each
area is assumed to be a second order random walk across time. The last possible space time
interaction is that between area structured effect ( vi ) and the structured time effect ( β j ) (call
it model B 4). In this case, the second order random walk prior that depends on neighboring

areas was assigned for each area. The prior for the variance parameter for the independent
normal distribution (i.i.d) and that for the spatial effect (Besag) was the gamma (1, 0.001).
The prior for the random walk variance was the gamma (1, 0.0005). The intercept was
assigned the default normal, N (0, 0). The model choice was by the deviance information
criteria (DIC) as proposed by Spiegelhalter et al (2002), where a smaller DIC means a better
model in terms of fit and complexity. It is the sum of the measure of model fit, called the
deviance denoted by D and the effective number of parameters denoted by p D . The selected

model was then used to estimate the relative risk, rit .
Results

Figure 1 shows the graph of cumulative confirmed and dead cases of COVID-19 from the
time the first case was reported to 20th August, 2020. There were 5282 confirmed cases and
165 deceased cases as of 20th August, 2020. Generally, there were low total cases of those
who died of COVID-19 as compared to those who were confirmed.

Figure 1: Cumulative cases of confirmed and those who had died of COVID-19 in Malawi
from 24/06/20 to 20/08/20.

The pairwise Spearman correlation between the confirmed cases and the population density (
ρ = −0.065 , p-value = 0.380), revealed lack of correlation. There was also no significant
correlation between confirmed cases and percentage of people with running water in each
district ( ρ = 0.000 , p-value = 0.998). Since the p-values of the correlation coefficients were
more than 0.20, the significance level set to select potential covariates, the two covariates,
population density and proportion of those with running water were dropped when fitting the
spatial temporal models of the weekly confirmed cases of COVID-19.

Table 1 shows the DIC of the fitted spatial temporal models defined in the methods section.
Model B 11 and B 12, had smaller DIC than the rest of the models, and the DIC difference
between the two models was not significant as it was not greater than 3 (Spiegelhalter et al,
2002). The results of the model with RW2, that is, Model B 11 are therefore presented and
discussed. Table 2 presents the variance parameters of the random effects. All model terms
including the interaction effect of location and time, were significant predictors of the risk of
contracting COVID-19 as the estimated variances were significantly greater than zero, since
the confidence intervals excluded zero. Area level spatial effects and the effects of time
modelled by the second order random walk prior (RW2), were highly significant as evidenced
from their bigger variances.

The spatial temporal distribution of overall fitted risk (Figure 2, Figure 3), shows that by
space, Mzimba, Mzuzu and Nkhata Bay in the north; Lilongwe, Lilongwe City and Mchinji in
the center; Blantyre, Mwanza, Zomba and Mangochi in the south; were at increased risk to
being confirmed of COVID-19. Overtime, from Week 1 to Week 6, the risk in Mzimba and
Mzuzu, had been decreasing and the risk in Blantyre was consistently high. Most of the
districts in the rural areas were consistently at low risk of contracting COVID-19 over time.

Figure 4: Evolution of spatial risk of COVID-19 over time (Interaction effect of location and
time on exponential scale).

Figure 4 presents the spatial risk of contracting COVID-19. Spatial risk represents the resdual
risk due to unobserved or unmeasured factors of COVID-19. In general, the spatial risk looks
randomly distributed in week 1, 3, 4 and 5 and non-random in week 2 and 6. Precisely though,
in the first week, the risk was high in the south than in the center and north. In the second
week, the spatial risk was high in the north and a little bit in the center close to the western
border, than in the south. In the third week, the spatial risk was high in Dowa (center) and
south of the lake, that is, Machinga and Mangochi. In the fourth week, the spatial risk was
high in areas surrounding major cities in all the three regions. In the fifth week, the spatial
risk shifted to the south and to one district in the northern region. Most areas in the last week,
had reduced spatial risk to COVID-19, with exception to two central districts.
Discussion

The study looked at a snap shot of spatial temporal distribution of COVID-19 in Malawi by
focusing on the period, 24th June to 20th August, while using the inseparable statistical spatial
temporal model. The use of inseparable model allowed the investigation of the joint or
interaction effect of time and location on COVID-19 cases. The use of non-parametric model
for time effect (RW2) also enabled the capturing of the subtle influences of time on the risk of
contracting COVID-19.
The space distribution of COVID-19 risk in Malawi in the given time period, shows the cities
and the surrounding areas being at increased risk. The explanation to the observed spatial
gradient is a matter of conjecture. One possible factor driving the observed spatial pattern
would be the population size and population density. The cities have higher population
density than the rural and COVID-19 is therefore more likely to spread fast through the

movement and frequent contact between people. Case comparison investigations have found
positive correlation of population density and COVID-19 (Penerliev and Petkov, 2020), where
for example in Italy, Lombardy, the population density is three times higher than in Piedmont
and the incidence rate was also over three times higher than in Piedmont. Evidence of high
population density as a risk of disease transmission has been seen in India where Influenza
transmission rates in India have been found to increase above a population density of 282 people
per square kilometer (African Centre of Strategic Studies, 2020).
The other possible contributor to the observed rural city spatial gradient of COVID-19 risk in
Malawi would be international exposure. In this case, cities have higher international
exposure than the rural through international flights among others, which would mean more
imported cases. Evidence of international exposure as a risk factor of COVID-19 transmission
has been observed in Africa as a whole where countries with high international exposure like
South Africa, Nigeria, Morroco, Egypt, and Algeria have had higher COVID-19 cases than
their counterparts. International exposure as a fuel of COVID-19 transmission has also been
documented in Brazil where it was found that cases increased with increase in international
flights jetting into the country (Pequeno et al, 2020). The ability to testing may be another
catalyst of COVID-19 risk distribution in Malawi where in the urban centers, a large number of
people are tested, hence more are reported to have COVID-19 than in the rural setting. COVID19 testing rate has been confirmed to be positively correlated with virus infection rate (Hamid et
al, 2020).
Regarding the temporal distribution, the disease risk was increasing gently from week 1 to week
4 and increased sharply from week 4 to week 5 when it started to decline in most regions. The
relative sharp increase in risk in week 4 and 5 may be attributed to the effects of post presidential
general election which was held on 23rd June, 2020. The unrestricted political rallies before the
election might have caused a spike in COVID-19 risk thereafter. In addition, the rise in COVID19 cases during this time would be attributed to the decreasing temperatures at this time of the
year as this is the time of cold season. The decline of risk from week 5 to the last week may be
due to the increasing temperatures as this time marks the beginning of hot season. Negative
correlation between COVID-19 cases and temperature has been documented (Pequeno et al,
2020).
The study did not go without weaknesses. The first weakness was that, due to the absence of
population size for each area at each time point, the base population at risk for each area was
assumed to constant across time which was not practically valid. The other weakness was that
the study did not look at future predictions of COVID-19 risk beyond the specified period of the
study to give an idea how the disease would progress thereafter. This would have important
implications particularly on planning activities that had been brought to a halt by COVID-19 like
education and football games. Nonetheless, the study gave an overview of the disease dynamics
in both space and time in the specified time frame so as to identify hot spots in both space and
time for further epidemiological investigations or interventions.

Conclusion
The study found a significant effect of both location and time on COVID-19 risk and the
effect of either of the two depended on the other, that is, interaction. The risk of COVID-19
for major cities was high compared to the rural districts and that over time, the risk for rural
areas remained relatively lower than in cities. The risk of getting COVID-19 in almost all
districts started to decline in the last week which was in August. The implications of the study
are that future interventions to halt the disease transmission in case the disease repeats itself,
should target the major cities like Blantyre, Zomba, Mangochi, Lilongwe and Mzuzu and that
by time, attention should be paid to the month of June and July when it is very cold.
