SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription PCR test results

ABSTRACT

40

Background

41

Performance characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection assays are understudied

42

within contexts of low pre-test probability, including screening asymptomatic persons without

43

epidemiological links to confirmed cases, or asymptomatic surveillance testing. SARS-CoV-2

44

detection without symptoms may represent resolved infection with persistent RNA shedding,

45

presymptomatic or asymptomatic infection, or a false positive test. This study assessed clinical

46

specificity of SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)

47

assays by retesting positive specimens from five pre-test probability groups ranging from high

48

to low with an alternate assay.

49

Materials and Methods

50

A total of 122 rRT-PCR positive specimens collected from unique patients between March and

51

July 2020 were retested using a laboratory-developed nested RT-PCR assay targeting the RNA-

52

dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene followed by Sanger sequencing.

53

Results

54

Significantly less positive results in the lowest pre-test probability group (facilities with

55

institution-wide screening having ≤ 3 positive asymptomatic cases) were reproduced with the

56

nested RdRp gene RT-PCR assay than in all other groups combined (5/32, 15·6% vs 61/90, 68%;

57

p <0·0001), and in each subgroup with higher pre-test probability (individual subgroup range

58

50·0% to 85·0%).

59

Conclusions

60

A higher proportion of false-positive test results are likely with lower pre-test probability.

61

Positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results should be interpreted within the context of patient history,

62

clinical setting, known exposure, and estimated community disease prevalence. Large-scale

63

SARS-CoV-2 screening testing initiatives among low pre-test probability populations should be

64

evaluated thoroughly prior to implementation given the risk of false positives and consequent

65

potential for harm at the individual and population level.

INTRODUCTION

69

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in implementation of large-scale testing practices globally

70

with the aim of early case detection. Prompt testing facilitates timely public health and clinical

71

management, including case identification, contact tracing, and treatment. Widespread

72

laboratory testing has also significantly contributed to knowledge of the epidemiology of the

73

SARS-CoV-2 virus. One such observation is that of positive real-time reverse transcription PCR

74

(rRT-PCR) tests in persons without symptoms. This may be represent resolved infections with

75

persistent viral RNA shedding, active presymptomatic (patients who later develop symptoms)

76

or asymptomatic (patients who never develop symptoms prior to or following testing)

77

infections, or because of false positive laboratory tests.1 The likelihood of a false positive rRT-

78

PCR result increases as pre-test probability of the condition it is designed to detect decreases.

79

Examples of low pre-test probability scenarios include asymptomatic groups with no known

80

exposure to COVID-19 cases, and communities with low prevalence of COVID-19. Further, a

81

positive rRT-PCR result close to the limit of detection (LOD) of an assay has a greater likelihood

82

of being false positive.2

83

False positive results can be attributable to pre-analytical errors (e.g. specimen contamination

84

or aliquoting errors), analytical errors (e.g. quality assurance failures, reagent contamination, or

85

non-specific assay signal detection), or post-analytical errors (e.g. improper interpretation or

86

transcription of results). As outlined by Cohen and Kessel, false positive results can have

87

unintended consequences on the public health response including outbreak identification and

88

modelling, case reporting, and resource allocation.3 Moreover, negative consequences are

89

greatest when disease prevalence is low. Therefore, pre-test probability is important to

90

consider when discriminating between true or false positive rRT-PCR results.

91

The cycle threshold (Ct) value, an indirect measure of viral load, and its application to test

92

interpretation has become an important tool for public health practitioners. Together with

93

available clinical and epidemiological factors, the Ct value can help determine appropriate

94

public health follow-up (e.g., contact tracing and/or outbreak declaration) for asymptomatic

95

patients.4 However, multiple studies have shown that Ct values overlap between symptomatic,

96

presymptomatic, and asymptomatic cases, and that time from initial infection to testing is the

97

most significant determinant of Ct value.5-7 Presymptomatic persons may have comparable viral

98

loads to symptomatic individuals and may be just as likely as symptomatic individuals to infect

99

others due to their unawareness of having the virus, hence their identification has far reaching

100

implications for public health management .8,9

101

Ontario is the most populous province in Canada with approximately 14.7 million residents10.

102

The first case of COVID-19 in the province was identified in a patient who presented to hospital

103

on January 23, 2020.11 The first pandemic wave peaked in April and was characterized by a

104

disproportionate impact on congregate settings including residents in long-term care and

105

retirement homes and for some workplaces.12 During the first wave, policy changes expanded

106

testing to asymptomatic screening programs within long-term care, hospitals, and some

107

workplace settings, irrespective of risk factors or community prevalence. Such widespread

108

testing has brought into focus the interpretation and implications of positive SARS-CoV-2 rRT-

109

PCR results with high Ct values, since many of these settings have both low prevalence and low

110

pre-test probability of infection.

111

This study evaluates the relative burden of false positive testing outcomes when testing

112

persons in low pre-test probability settings, by exploring the likelihood of a reproducible

113

positive test result upon retesting specimens having high rRT-PCR Ct values, stratified by pre-

114

test probability. The findings have the potential to inform testing guidelines for persons with

115

low pre-test probability, such as within low prevalence communities.

116

MATERIALS AND METHODS

117

Public Health Ontario (PHO) Laboratory, the Ontario provincial public health and reference

118

laboratory, conducts approximately 25% of SARS-CoV-2 testing for the province. Specimens are

119

submitted from acute care (e.g., hospitals), community, institutional, and occupational settings,

120

as well as from outbreaks. Specimen data were obtained from the PHO laboratory information

121

system (LIS).

122

A total of 122 specimens from unique patients aged 10 to 99 years (median 53.5 years) who

123

underwent clinical testing between mid-March and July 2020 were included in the analysis. All

124

specimens included were initially positive by rRT-PCR with Ct value ≥ 35 using either (i) a

125

laboratory-developed test (LDT) targeting the envelope (E) gene, or (ii) a commercial assay

126

targeting the E and open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) genes (cobas® SARS-CoV-2, Roche

127

Diagnostics, Germany).13

128

Interpreting results for specimens tested using the LDT E gene rRT-PCR assay was based on

129

prior validation data, which determined a LOD of 192 copies/ml of primary sample (95% CI 16

130

to 2,392 copies/ml of specimen), corresponding to Ct values between 34·8 and 38·7. Based on

131

this data, LDT Ct results ≤38·0 are reported as detected and Ct values ≥40·0 are reported as not

132

detected. Ct values between 38·1 and 39·9 are reported as indeterminate.14 Indeterminate

133

results may be due to low viral target quantity in the clinical specimen approaching the assay

134

LOD, failed automated viral RNA extraction, or, in rare cases, nonspecific reactivity (false signal)

135

in the specimen. When clinically relevant or important to public health management, repeat

136

testing is recommended.

137

Specimens tested with the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR assay were reported as detected or not

138

detected - the manufacturer does not include an indeterminate range. The maximum number

139

of cycles of PCR amplification used in the assay is proprietary and not provided in the kit insert

140

or other available documentation.

141

To be included in the study, specimens had to be collected from persons belonging to one of

142

five groups based on information provided on the PHO laboratory requisition. The groups had

143

differing pre-test probability of COVID-19 infection (based on presence of symptoms, prior

144

laboratory confirmation as a case, and epidemiological links to other positive cases) and a high

145

Ct value of ≥35 on either the LDT or cobas® rRT-PCR assay (E gene target). A Ct value of ≥35 was

146

chosen as a conservative estimate of lack of infectivity based on other studies using different

147

assays reporting that a Ct of >34 indicates an individual is not likely to be infectious at the time

148

of diagnostic testing.7,9,15 Table 1 contains a description of the five categories, ordered from

149

highest pre-test probability setting (Group 1) to lowest pre-test probability setting (Group 5).

150

Groups 1-4 were tested throughout the study period (March - June 2020), whereas Group 5 was

151

tested beyond the peak of the first pandemic wave (May - July 2020).

152

The study dataset was produced by manually reviewing a line list of positive specimens of

153

appropriate Ct values available at the PHO Laboratory, Toronto location, which met inclusion

154

criteria. Group 1, with highest pre-test probability, consisted of high Ct positive specimens from

155

persons with a previous positive result with a lower Ct value (Ct <30). Group 5, which consisted

156

of asymptomatic positives in facilities that underwent whole facility screening with three or

157

fewer positive cases identified, was considered the category with lowest pre-test probability of

158

infection (based on both asymptomatic status and being least likely to be exposed to a case).

159

None of the facilities in Group 5 were in outbreak at the time screening was commenced, which

160

was confirmed by review of the provincial public health information system for the reporting

161

and surveillance of diseases. Group 5 was thus chosen as the reference group when conducting

162

statistical analysis.

163

Specimens included in this study were retested with a LDT end-point nested RT-PCR assay

164

targeting the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, followed by Sanger sequencing of

165

amplicons with expected size of 192 base pairs. This assay was adapted from a previously

166

published Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nested PCR, altered such

167

that the relevant primer bases match SARS-CoV-2: an outer primer and newly designed inner

168

primers were used for both amplification and sequencing.16 Primers used are presented in

169

Table 2. The LOD determined during validation was similar to that of the E gene rRT-PCR, at 256

170

copies/ml of primary specimen (95% CI 37.92 to 1733 copies/ml).

171

The proportion of specimens detected by the RdRp gene nested PCR assay as well as the

172

median and range of Ct values were determined overall and for each of the five categories.

173

Statistical significance for median Ct value comparison was calculated using Wilcoxon rank-sum

174

test. Statistical significance for categorical results was calculated using Fisher’s exact test with

175

Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons. Results were considered significant

176

at a level of 0·05. All analyses were conducted using SAS Enterprise Guide 8.3.17

177

The PHO Ethics Review Board determined that this project is exempt from research ethics

178

committee review, as it describes analyses that were completed at PHO Laboratory as part of

179

routine clinical respiratory testing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario

180

and are therefore considered public health practice, not research.

181

RESULTS

182

Table 3 describes the results of the specimens overall and by group. After retesting using the

183

RdRp gene nested PCR assay with Sanger sequencing, results varied according to pre-test

184

probability. Overall, 66/122 (54·1%) specimens had RdRp gene detected. There was a significant

185

difference (p<0·01) in the E gene Ct values among specimens that were reproducible in the

186

RdRp gene nested RT-PCR (median Ct 36·2, range 35·0 to 40·6) compared to those that could

187

not be confirmed (median Ct 37·5, range 35·2-39·8).

188

A similar high proportion of specimens from Groups 1 (18/23; 78·3%) and 2 (17/20; 85·0%),

189

both high pre-test probability groups, had reproducible positive results using the RdRp gene

190

nested PCR assay. However, a significantly lower proportion of positive results in the lowest

191

pre-test probability group (Group 5) were reproducible with RdRp gene nested PCR with Sanger

192

sequencing than in all other groups combined (5/32, 15·6% vs 61/90, 68%; p <0·0001), and in

193

each subgroup.

DISCUSSION

195

This study was conducted to ascertain impact of different pre-test probability patient categories

196

on ability to reproduce positive rRT-PCR results of high Ct value (Ct ≥35) with a laboratory

197

developed nested PCR assay targeting an independent gene target, RdRp, including Sanger

198

sequencing of the PCR amplicon. We documented a much lower rate of reproducible positive

199

tests among patients in the lowest pre-test probability category of asymptomatic persons

200

within an institution with three or fewer positive patients identified through screening testing

201

(Group 5). Among this group, only five (15·6%) of 32 patients tested positive with the RdRp

202

gene nested RT-PCR. This is in contrast to the other patient groups with higher pre-test

203

probability, where 50% to 85% of E gene rRT-PCR positive specimens were also RdRp gene PCR

204

positive.

205

Results of the group-specific analysis suggest that screening asymptomatic individuals in low

206

prevalence situations can generate results which are false positive due to low positive

207

predictive value. This is indicated by the higher percentage of reproducible positive results in

208

symptomatic cases (85·0% detected) compared to cases with no known evidence of disease and

209

likely no contact with positive cases (15·6% detected).

210

A significantly higher rate of RdRp gene nested RT-PCR positivity was also found among

211

asymptomatic patients exposed to a probable or confirmed case (Group 3, 66·7% detected),

212

and among asymptomatic persons who were tested in facilities with ≥10 positive cases (Group

213

4, 50% detected), both reflecting higher pre-test probability scenarios than Group 5.

214

It should be noted that lack of detection with the RdRp gene nested PCR assay is not necessarily

215

a false positive E gene rRT-PCR result, and should not be used to definitively infer false

11

216

positivity at the individual level. In general, specimens with Ct values well below the assay cut-

217

off for positivity (e.g. Ct values <35 with the positivity cut-off set at Ct 38.0) are less likely to be

218

false positive. However, if the initial positive result was of high Ct value, near the assay cut-off,

219

then repeat testing of the same specimen may yield a negative result, as assay performance

220

near the LOD is not consistent, with results varying on repeat testing. Furthermore, different

221

assays will perform differently on the same specimen having virus quantity near the LOD.

222

However, when applied at a group level, these results provide an indication of the potential

223

relative contribution of false positive test results that may occur in different settings which are

224

differentiated by pre-test probability.

225

In general, the PPV of COVID-19 PCR assays is excellent among patients with high pre-test

226

probability and approaches 100%.2 This was previously determined at PHO using Sanger

227

sequencing of amplicons from RT-PCR positive specimens excluding those for which viral copy

228

number was near the LOD of the assay. However, when testing asymptomatic patients with

229

low pre-test probability in low prevalence settings, the PPV is likely to be different. For

230

example, if community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is 1% with a rRT-PCR test sensitivity of 80%

231

and specificity of 99%, the PPV of a positive test is only 44·7%. If prevalence were to increase to

232

5% or 10%, then the PPV increases significantly to 80·8% and 89·9%, respectively. Recent

233

serosurveys conducted by PHO using residual convenience specimens found a low adjusted

234

monthly seroprevalence of 1·1% among specimens received in June, July and again in August,

235

2020.18 This provides further evidence that Ontario overall was a low prevalence setting for

236

SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period.

237

Analysis of results from over 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 tests conducted at PHO Laboratory for

238

asymptomatic screening programs (including long-term care homes, retirement homes,

239

childcare settings, hospitals, settings with migrant workers, and correctional institutions) during

240

the same period as this study identified a positivity rate of 0·2%, (unpublished data). Nearly

241

70% of positive tests had Ct values ≥35, suggesting that true positivity is likely to be lower,

242

given the potential for false-positive high Ct results in these low-prevalence settings.

243

Limitations of this study include small sample size and use of a non-randomized sampling

244

method that may limit generalizability of findings. Additionally, all specimens from Groups 2 to

245

5 included in the study were indicated as the individual’s first positive specimen tested by PHO.

246

However, because PHO Laboratory only conducts a subset of Ontario’s testing (approximately

247

25%), it is possible that patients had additional positive tests processed at other laboratories,

248

which would increase the pre-test probability of the specimen regardless of the group to which

249

the individual’s sample was assigned. For similar reasons, it is possible that not all positive

250

cases from individual institutions were captured in our study if some testing for additional cases

251

was done at other laboratories or individuals declined testing. To substantiate that the low-

252

prevalence institutional settings had no more than three cases, validation was conducted

253

against provincially reported outbreak-related cases associated with these settings within a

254

three week period. It was assumed that if the number of cases identified by the asymptomatic

255

screening program became greater than 3, an outbreak would be declared and any additional

256

cases would be captured as part of the outbreak.

257

A further limitation of this study involves changes to government testing guidelines as the

258

pandemic evolved: changes occurred in both the population incidence of COVID-19 as well as

259

guidelines indicating who should be tested during the period of this study, from March to July

260

2020. This may introduce a bias, since persons tested in periods with more cases, or with

261

stricter testing criteria as occurred earlier in the pandemic in Ontario, may have a greater

262

likelihood of infection.

263

Specimens included in this study were stored at -80C for weeks to months prior to conducting

264

the RdRp gene nested RT-PCR. RNA degradation during storage and freeze-thaw is possible, and

265

was more likely to affect specimens that were close to the LOD, resulting in a negative RdRp RT-

266

PCR in a specimen that was true rRT-PCR positive at the time of initial testing.

267

Specimen inclusion was based on E gene Ct value at the time of rRT-PCR. Determination of Ct

268

values for LDTs rely on interpretation by the reporting technologist, introducing variability in Ct

269

value assignment. This introduces a risk of reporter bias influencing the specimens included in

270

this study.

271

Despite these limitations, the results presented here are an important first step towards

272

quantifying the magnitude of false-positive test results in low-prevalence settings, which will

273

increasingly become the norm in many countries with increased use of widespread testing,

274

including broad testing in low pre-test probability populations. Globally, few studies have

275

investigated widespread testing results from low-prevalence areas. This may be attributed to

276

factors such as testing capacity, resources, and practicality. Instead, testing is often restricted to

277

travellers from high prevalence countries, or to those individuals who present with symptoms

or a history of exposure, which is linked to public health management.19 Currently, there exist a

279

few studies that have attempted to ascertain prevalence through probability-based population-

280

level surveillance studies, rather than initiating a study in an area known to have low

281

prevalence.20,21 Examples of targeted low-prevalence studies include examination of potential

282

SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater, as well as serosurveillance studies in low prevalence

283

areas.22,23

284

The results of this study have implications for informing future testing approaches, including

285

the utility of conducting broad screening with PCR-based tests in settings with low pre-test

286

probability. For example, in Ontario, this work has been used to inform recent public health

287

approaches, resulting in discontinuation of unnecessary public health management such as case

288

isolation, contact tracing, and outbreak declaration for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR

289

positive persons with low pre-test probability who are negative on retesting.2

290

CONCLUSIONS

291

SARS-CoV-2 Ct values can be of use when interpreting positive laboratory results derived from

292

patients with low pre-test probability, in particular asymptomatic persons with no

293

epidemiological link to a confirmed COVID-19 case. Ontario has produced guidance documents

294

facilitating risk-based patient management and follow-up that do not rely on definitively

295

concluding if the specimen is true or false positive, which often cannot be achieved with high

296

Ct-positive specimens due to difficulty in reproducing results near the assay LOD on retesting.

297

Health care providers, public health professionals, policy-makers and the public will benefit

298

from ongoing education to understand that false positive tests will occur when testing

asymptomatic patients during periods of low community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, even when

utilizing assays with excellent performance. These false positive tests and unnecessary case

301

isolation, contact tracing and outbreak declaration likely outweigh the benefits from the low

302

numbers of true cases detected among these populations.
