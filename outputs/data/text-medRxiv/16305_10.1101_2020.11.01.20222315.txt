Abstract
Background: Close contact with children may provide cross-reactive immunity to SARs-CoV-2 due to
more frequent prior coryzal infections from seasonal coronaviruses. Alternatively, close contact with
children may increase risk of SARs-CoV-2 infection. We investigated whether risk of infection with
SARs-CoV-2 and severe outcomes differed between adults living with and without children.
Methods: Working on behalf of NHS England, we conducted a population-based cohort study using
primary care data and pseudonymously-linked hospital and intensive care admissions, and death records,
from patients registered in general practices representing 40% of England. Using multivariable Cox
regression, we calculated fully-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of outcomes from 1st February-3rd August
2020 comparing adults living with and without children in the household.
Findings: Among 9,157,814 adults ≤65 years, living with children 0-11 years was not associated with
increased risks of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related hospital or ICU admission but was
associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 death (HR 0.75, 95%CI 0.62-0.92). Living with children aged
12-18 years was associated with a small increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 1.08,
95%CI 1.03-1.13), but not associated with other COVID-19 outcomes. Living with children of any age
was also associated with lower risk of dying from non-COVID-19 causes. Among 2,567,671 adults >65
years there was no association between living with children and outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2. We
observed no consistent changes in risk following school closure.
Interpretation: For adults living with children there is no evidence of an increased risk of severe
COVID-19 outcomes. These findings have implications for determining the benefit-harm balance of
children attending school in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE on 19th October 2020 for population-based epidemiological studies comparing
the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in people living with and without children. We
searched for articles published in 2020, with abstracts available, and terms "(children or parents or
dependants) AND (COVID or SARS-CoV-2 or coronavirus) AND (rate or hazard or odds or risk), in the
title, abstract or keywords. 244 papers were identified for screening but none were relevant. One
additional study in preprint was identified on medRxiv and found a reduced risk of hospitalisation for
COVID-19 and a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection among adult healthcare workers living with children.

Added value of this study
This is the first population-based study to investigate whether the risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection
and severe outcomes from COVID-19 differ between adults living in households with and without
school-aged children during the UK pandemic. Our findings show that for adults living with children
there is no evidence of an increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes although there may be a slightly
increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection for working-age adults living with children aged 12 to
18 years. Working-age adults living with children 0 to 11 years have a lower risk of death from COVID19 compared to adults living without children, with the effect size being comparable to their lower risk of
death from any cause. We observed no consistent changes in risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection and
severe outcomes from COVID-19 comparing periods before and after school closure.

Implications of all the available evidence
Our results demonstrate no evidence of serious harms from COVID-19 to adults in close contact with
children, compared to those living in households without children. This has implications for determining
the benefit-harm balance of children attending school in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Background
The role of children and adolescents in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain. They may have
lower susceptibility to infection1 and are less likely to experience severe disease once infected.2
Modelling of other respiratory tract infections such as influenza suggests that children are a major driver
of transmission during the initial phase of an epidemic, in part due to a high frequency of social contacts.3
However, accruing evidence suggests that for SARS-CoV-2, by contrast, lower susceptibility and
possibly lower infectiousness among children means that they may not transmit infection more than
adults.4
A suggested mechanism for lower susceptibility or propensity to disease is cross-protection due to
immunity derived from recent seasonal coronavirus infection.5 There are four seasonal coronaviruses
(hCoVs) that usually cause self-limiting “common cold”-like syndromes, although hCoVs are only one
group of viruses responsible, causing 10 to 30% of common colds in adults.6 Children experience more
colds each year than adults, with the highest infection frequency in young children.7–9 Adults in close
contact with children also have a higher frequency of viral respiratory infections, especially adults
exposed to younger children and among women.10
If recent hCoV infection is protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19, then adults living
with children may be at a lower risk than those living without children. Conversely children may also
introduce SARS-CoV-2 infections into their households, meaning adults living with children may
experience an increased risk of infection and severe disease. In the face of increasing transmission in
many countries and the need for policy decisions about school opening, quantifying the overall impact of
living with children on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections and severe outcomes from COVID-19 is
important. We therefore conducted a large cohort study using UK electronic health records (EHR) with
linked data on household members to determine whether the risk of COVID-19 outcomes differs between
adults living with and without school-aged children.

Methods
Database Description
Primary care records managed by the GP software provider The Phoenix Partnership (TPP) were linked to
Secondary Uses Service (SUS) hospital admissions, Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre
(ICNARC) COVID-19-related Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions11 and Office for National Statistics
(ONS) mortality records through OpenSAFELY, a data analytics platform created on behalf of NHS
England to address urgent COVID-19 research questions (https://opensafely.org).
OpenSAFELY provides a secure software interface allowing the analysis of pseudonymized primary care
patient records from England in near real-time within the EHR vendor’s highly secure data centre,
avoiding the need for large volumes of potentially disclosive pseudonymized patient data to be transferred
off-site. This, in addition to other technical and organisational controls, minimizes any risk of reidentification. Similarly, pseudonymized datasets from other data providers are securely provided to the

EHR vendor and linked to the primary care data. The dataset analysed within OpenSAFELY is based on
24 million people currently registered with GP surgeries using TPP SystmOne software. It includes
pseudonymized data such as coded diagnoses, medications and physiological parameters. No free text
data are included. Further details on Information Governance and Ethics can be found on page 12.

Study Design and Population
Our pre-specified study protocol12 and post-hoc protocol amendments (Table A1) are available.
The study population included all adults aged ൒18 years, registered and active for ൒three months, in an
English TPP general practice on 1st February 2020 (study start). We followed participants until the
earliest of: developing the outcome of interest; deregistration from their general practice; death from any
cause; or 3rd August 2020 which was the latest date of linked outcomes, except for hospital admissions
which were available until 1st May 2020.

Inclusion & Exclusion Criteria
We required participants to have ൒three months of follow-up before study start to allow records to be
updated following change of GP practice, while minimising loss of households moving home more
frequently, potentially related to having children.
The TPP-developed pseudonymised household identifier links people living at the same address
(Supplementary Methods). We excluded people with no household identifier, and individuals living in
care homes (derived by TPP from linking addresses matched to publicly-available Care Quality
Commission data) or household sizes >10 individuals (possible care homes or other institutions). Finally,
we excluded households where any individual had a missing record of sex, age, or index of multiple
deprivation (IMD), and we excluded individuals with missing ethnicity.

Study Measures
Exposures
The primary exposure was an ordered categorical variable reflecting school stages, derived using the ages
of individuals linked by the household identifier; 1) no children under 18 years in the household, 2) any
children 0 to 11 years of age in the household, 3) no children 0 to 11 years of age but one or more
children aged 12 to 18 years in the household.

Outcomes
We included four outcomes: 1) evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection recorded in primary care defined as a
code indicating either a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, a positive swab test for SARS-CoV-2, or having
sequelae of COVID-19 (Supplementary methods); 2) hospital admission for COVID-19 defined as a
COVID-19 ICD-10 code in the primary diagnosis field (ascertained from SUS data); 3) ICU admission
with COVID-19 that required non-invasive or invasive respiratory support (ascertained from ICNARC
data); and 4) COVID-19 related death defined as a COVID-19 ICD-10 code anywhere on the death

certificate (ascertained from ONS death certificate data). Participants were able to contribute to each
outcome. Post hoc, to contextualise our findings, we added the outcome of non-COVID-19 death defined
as death from any other cause on the death certificate.

Covariates
We used a directed-acyclic graph approach to determining covariates (Figure A4), considering
demographics including age in years, sex, body mass index (BMI; kg/m2), smoking status, IMD,
ethnicity, geographic area, and the total number of adults in the household. We identified chronic
comorbidities that are associated with the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes.13 These are defined with
links to code lists in the Supplementary Methods, with further information about demographic covariates.
We identified participants who were recommended to shield following the UK government’s
identification of clinically extremely vulnerable groups.14

Statistical Analysis
Primary Model
We analysed outcomes separately for adults aged 18-65 years, those most likely to be parents or primary
caregivers, and also of working-age; and older adults (>65 years). We described the proportion of
individuals within each exposure and outcome, by the covariates. We then described the rate of outcomes
according to the presence of children, and the number of children aged 0 to 11 years, in the household.
We used Cox proportional hazards modelling to determine hazard ratios (HRs) for each outcome using
robust standard errors to account for clustering by household identifier and stratifying by geographic area
to allow for regional variation in infection rates. We wished to adjust for illness in early adult life, which
could have impacted the ability or decision to have children, as a confounder but were concerned about
the accuracy of dates of onset of illness in the primary care record. Therefore, we used comorbidities at
study start as a proxy for earlier health issues, as well as a marker of differences in current health status
between adults living with and without children. To show the impact of this adjustment we present a
‘demographic-adjusted model’, adjusted for sex, age using a four-knot cubic spline, IMD, BMI, smoking,
ethnicity and total number of adults in the household; and then a ‘comorbidity-adjusted model’ with
addition of clinical comorbidities at study start. Violations of the proportional hazards assumption were
explored by testing for a zero slope in the scaled Schoenfeld residuals.
Secondary models
We examined possible interactions between our primary exposure and: 1) time periods from 1st February
to 3rd April 2020 and 4th April 2020 to end of follow-up for each outcome. This period was chosen to
allow three weeks after school closure on March 20th (except for key-worker children) for infections
related to school transmission to progress to serious outcomes; 2) sex of the adult; and 3) probable
shielding behaviour of the adult.
We also examined a potential ‘dose-response’ effect of exposure to previous coronavirus infections by
recategorising the number of children between 0 and 11 years as 0 (reference), one, two, and ≥three.

Sensitivity analyses
To confirm that our household identifier correctly linked parents/care-givers with children we conducted
a similar analysis over an earlier time period (1st February 2019 to 1st February 2020) where the outcome
was a Read code for threadworm infection, a condition where we anticipated transmission from young
children to adults.
Secondly, we repeated the comorbidity-adjusted model: 1) restricting to participants with complete BMI
and smoking data since in the main analysis we assumed those with missing BMI to be non-obese and
those with missing smoking information to be non-smokers; 2) using age as the underlying timescale, to
ensure we had fully adjusted for age as a confounder; 3) requiring >12 months primary care follow-up
prior to study start, to fully capture pre-existing comorbidities; and 4) fitting time-interactions on
covariates where there was evidence of non-proportional hazards.
Since data regarding occupation (and hence risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection) was not available, we
conducted quantitative bias analysis to assess the potential extent of confounding from high-risk
occupation among working-age adults. Bias-adjusted hazard ratios were calculated under a range of
plausible assumptions regarding the association between occupation and risk of infection, and prevalence
of high-risk occupations among those with and without children.15–18
Finally, we carried out an additional post-hoc analysis using multiple imputation to address those initially
excluded for missing ethnicity data. Five imputed datasets were created with estimated hazard ratios
combined using Rubin’s rules.19

Software and Reproducibility
We used Python 3.8 and SQL (Server 2016 Enterprise SP2) for data management and Stata 16 for
analysis. Analysis code is available online.20

Results
The final cohort included 9,157,814 adults ൑65 years and 2,567,671 >65 years (Figure A1). Among those
≤65 years, 5,738,498 (63%) did not live with children, 2,568,901 (28%) lived with children 0 to 11 years
and 9% (850,415) lived with children 12 to 18 years (Table 1). A total of 29,863 (0.33%) had evidence of
SARS-CoV-2 infection recorded in their primary care record, 4,776 (0.05%) were admitted to hospital
with COVID-19, 1,471 (0.02%) were admitted to ICU for ventilatory support with COVID-19 and 1,173
(0.01%) died of COVID-19 (Table A2). Those living with children were more likely to be younger,

female, of non-white ethnicity, have a lower IMD, have more adults in the household and have fewer
comorbidities.
Among those >65 years, 2,481,210 (97%) did not live with children (Table 2). A total of 11,826 (0.46%)
had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection recorded in their primary care record, 6,496 (0.25%) were
admitted to hospital with COVID-19, 675 (0.03%) were admitted to ICU for ventilatory support with
COVID-19 and 6,352 (0.25%) died of COVID-19 (Table A3).
Among adults ≤65 years, after adjusting for ethnicity, IMD, BMI, smoking and total number of adults in
the household, living with children aged 0 to 11 years was not associated with recorded SARS-CoV-2
infection, COVID-19 related hospital or ICU admission but was associated with a reduced risk of death
from COVID-19 (HR 0.74, 95%CI 0.60-0.90) (Table A4). Living with children aged 12 to 18 years was
associated with a small increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.03-1.13),
but was not associated with COVID-19 related hospital or ICU admission, or death from COVID-19
(Table A4).
For adults >65 years living in a household with children, there was no evidence of an association with any
outcome (Table A4).
Living with children of any age was associated with around 30% reduced risk of death from non-COVID19 causes for adults ≤65 but there was no reduction in risk for adults >65 years (Table A4).
In all analyses, additionally adjusting for comorbidities did not materially change the results (Figure 1,
Table A4).
There were no evident trends in the associations between risks of recorded SARS-CoV-2 in primary care
or severe outcomes from COVID-19 and the number of children aged 0 to 11 years in a household, for
adults of any age (Table A4).
We explored whether the association between household exposure to children and the risk of COVID-19
disease varied by sex, time period in relation to school closure, and probable shielding status, in the
comorbidity-adjusted model (Figure 2 for adults ≤65 years and Supplementary Figure A5 for adults >65
years).
Among ≤65 year olds, there was some evidence that the associations varied by sex of the adult: for
recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection (P-value for interaction=<0.001), the small increased risk among those
living with children aged 0 to 11 years was observed in males (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.13) but not
females (HR 0.99, 95%CI 0.96-1.03). For COVID-19-related hospital admission (P int=<0.001), there
was evidence of an increased risk of admission among males living with children aged 12 to 18 years (HR
1.24, 95%CI 1.10-1.40), but not females (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76-1.03). For death from COVID-19 there
was evidence of a reduced risk in females (HR 0.58, 95%CI 0.41-0.82 for females living with children 0
to 11 years (P int=0.059); HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.89 (P int=0.029) for those living with children 12 to
18 years), but no evidence of lower risk for males living with children.
There was evidence that for working-age adults, the risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher
in the period three weeks after school closures compared to earlier but no evidence of important variations
in the risk of any other COVID-19 outcomes between these time periods. There was no evidence of

important increases in risk for any outcome for working-age adults who were likely to have been
shielding and no evidence of any interactions for those aged >65 years.
Model checking and sensitivity analyses
Among adults ≤65 years, living with children aged 0 to 11 years was associated with a 2-fold increased
risk of being diagnosed with threadworm (HR 2.53, 95%CI 2.19-2.92), with strong evidence of an
increased risk with increasing number of children in the household, and an increased risk among adults
living with children aged 12 to 18 years, though of a smaller magnitude (HR 1.32, 95%CI 1.03-1.70)
(Table A4).
None of the sensitivity analyses materially altered the results from the comorbidity adjusted models
(Figure A3).
When accounting for missing ethnicity data through multiple imputation, the associations between living
with children and outcomes remained the same as the primary (complete case) analysis (Table A6).
Quantitative bias analysis accounting for shared risk of people with young children working in
occupations with high-risk of exposure did not materially alter any results (Tables A7-A14).

Discussion
We observed no increased risk of recorded infection or serious COVID-19 outcomes among working-age
adults sharing a household with children aged 0 to 11 years, compared to those living without children,
but a reduced risk of death from COVID-19. This was similar in magnitude to the reduction in risk of
death from causes other than COVID-19 seen in working-age adults living with children of all ages. For
working-age adults living with children aged 12 to 18 years we found a small (between three and 13%)
increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection, but no association with other outcomes from COVID19. We found no association with the risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes from
COVID-19 among adults over 65 years living with children of any age.
Our analysis has a number of important strengths. Firstly, our study is large, providing us with sufficient
power to examine rarer outcomes, as well as interactions with several important factors. Secondly we
show largely consistent results across SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related clinical outcomes,
supporting our findings. Thirdly, in our control analysis of threadworm infection in adults we show strong
evidence that our model can detect an infection transmitted from children to adults, with, as we would
anticipate, risk increasing with the number of children in a household and a stronger effect seen in
younger children.
However, there are also limitations. During the period covered by this study, the outcome of recorded
SARS-CoV-2 infection is mainly based on swab tests taken in community testing centres and healthcare
settings that were later transferred to the primary care record. Therefore, results related to testing should
be viewed as likely to be heavily influenced by people in high-risk jobs where testing was more easily
available. A positive recorded infection combines the risk of being infected with the chance of being
tested and this is particularly important for interpreting the interaction by date. Occupation was also an

unmeasured confounder both in terms of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (such as healthcare and other highrisk workers) and degree of contact with children outside the home (such as nursery workers). To explore
the potential impact of lack of occupational information we conducted a quantitative bias analysis which
did not meaningfully change our results for any outcome. We were not able to adjust for confounding by
previous comorbidities that affected ability or choice to have children, and subsequent risk of
development of severe outcomes from COVID-19. However, to examine the potential impact of this we
show results from models with and without adjusting for baseline comorbidities and again find no
important differences. It is likely we have misclassified the degree of contact with children in a number of
situations such as for divorced parents, and limitations in the data may mean misclassification of the
number of people living in a household, e.g. for flats within a larger property or when people have not
updated their address with their general practice following a house move. Finally, in this analysis we are
assuming a constant relationship for infections between people through clustering at the household level,
rather than detailed modelling of how infections are transmitted within households.
One previous cohort study of 310,097 healthcare workers and other adults in their household in Scotland
has also addressed whether the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes from COVID-19
differs between adults living in households with and without children aged 0 to 11 years.21 Similar to our
results they find no increase in hospitalisation due to COVID-19 for people living with young children.
However, they find a slightly reduced rate of testing positive for COVID-19 for adults living with young
children, and evidence that the protective effect increased with a greater number of children. Differences
in power, greater consistency in testing patterns and exposure risk among healthcare workers in their
cohort and different epidemic trajectories between Scotland and England make direct comparisons
between our results difficult.
Our findings of no increase in risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 despite some evidence of a small
increased risk of infection among adults living with older children could be explained by confounding if
parents are healthier than people without children. This explanation is supported by our finding of a
substantially lower risk of mortality from causes other than COVID-19 among working-age adults living
with children of any age. Parents are known to have lower all-cause mortality than individuals without
children.22,23 The protective mechanisms of having children are likely to be multifactorial, including
healthier behaviours among parents, e.g. in relation to smoking and alcohol,24,25 and self-selection of
healthier individuals becoming parents.26 However, beneficial changes in immune function from exposure
to young children have been proposed to cause reduced mortality among parents.27
In terms of implications for health policy, our results can be viewed as the cumulative effects of
transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2, the impact of any cross-reactive immunity and differences in
underlying health status and health related behaviours of adults living with and without children. We
found that outcomes differed by the sex of the adult, with in general, less risk of severe outcomes and
lower risk of death for women compared to men, particularly those living with younger children. Given
that women and parents of younger children have higher rates of respiratory tract infections,10 this offers
some clinical support to the basic science evidence that exposure to other hCoVs may offer some

immunity to SARS-CoV-2.28 If confirmed, this would have important implications for understanding
high-risk populations and the likely future course of the pandemic.
Concern that children act as an important source of spread of SARS-CoV-2 have led to school closures in
many countries during the pandemic. We saw an increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection for
adults living with children in the period from three weeks after schools closed, compared to previously,
although this must be interpreted in light of limitations of testing data. However, overall our findings
suggest that on a population level transmission from school age children does not result in an increased
risk of serious outcomes among the adults they live with.

Conclusion
During a period covering the first peak of the UK pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 we found no evidence of
increased risk of serious outcomes from COVID-19 among adults of any age living with children
compared to those in households without children. Within the limitations of testing data there was
evidence of a small increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection for adults living with older
children. We found no evidence for a reduction in risk following school closure. These findings, in
consideration alongside other evidence, have implications for determining the benefit-harm balance of
children attending school in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Role of the funding source The views expressed are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the
NIHR, NHS England, Public Health England or the Department of Health and Social Care. Funders had
no role in the study design, collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; in the writing of the report; and
in the decision to submit the article for publication.

Information governance and ethical approval
NHS England is the data controller; TPP is the data processor; and the key researchers on OpenSAFELY
are acting on behalf of NHS England. This implementation of OpenSAFELY is hosted within the TPP
environment which is accredited to the ISO 27001 information security standard and is NHS IG Toolkit
compliant;29,30 patient data has been pseudonymised for analysis and linkage using industry standard
cryptographic hashing techniques; all pseudonymised datasets transmitted for linkage onto OpenSAFELY
are encrypted; access to the platform is via a virtual private network (VPN) connection, restricted to a
small group of researchers; the researchers hold contracts with NHS England and only access the platform
to initiate database queries and statistical models; all database activity is logged; only aggregate statistical
outputs leave the platform environment following best practice for anonymisation of results such as
statistical disclosure control for low cell counts.31 The OpenSAFELY research platform adheres to the
data protection principles of the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and the EU General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) 2016. In March 2020, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care used powers
under the UK Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002 (COPI) to require

organisations to process confidential patient information for the purposes of protecting public health,
providing healthcare services to the public and monitoring and managing the COVID-19 outbreak and
incidents of exposure.32 Taken together, these provide the legal bases to link patient datasets on the
OpenSAFELY platform. GP practices, from which the primary care data are obtained, are required to
share relevant health information to support the public health response to the pandemic, and have been
informed of the OpenSAFELY analytics platform.
