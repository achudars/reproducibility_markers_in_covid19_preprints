Abstract

Introduction
Sri Lanka has been able to contain COVID-19 transmission through very stringent suppression
measures implemented from the onset. The country had been under a strict lockdown since 20
March 2020, and currently the lockdown is being relaxed gradually. The objective of this paper is
to describe a projection model for COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka applied to different scenarios
after lockout, utilizing the stringency index as a proxy of total government response.

Methods
COVID-19 Stringency Index (C19SI) is published and updated real time by a research group from
Oxford university on 17 selected mitigation and suppression measures employed by different
countries. We have mapped and validated the stringency index for Sri Lanka and subsequently
validated the projection model in two phases. Predictions for the base-case scenario, less stringent
scenarios, advanced relaxation scenarios, and high-risk districts were done with 95% confidence
intervals (95%CI) using the validated model, utilizing data up to 10th May.

Results
C19SI was able to accommodate all of the government responses. The model using validated
C19SI could predict number of cases with 95% confidence for a period of two weeks. The model
predicted base-case scenario of 815 (95%CI, 753-877) active cases by 17 May 2020 and 648
(95%CI, 599-696) cases for the high-risk districts by 18 May 2020. The model further predicted
3,159 (95%CI, 2,928-3,391) cases for 75% stringency and 928,824 (95%CI, 861,772-995,877)
cases for 50% stringency. Advancing normalcy by three weeks resulted in the case load increasing
to 4526 (95%CI, 4309-4744) by 30 June 2020.

Conclusion
The proposed prediction model based on C19SI provides policy makers an evidence based
scientific method for identifying suppression measures that can be relaxed at the most appropriate
time.

Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on 11
February 20201. The first case of Covid-19 was reported in Sri Lanka on 27 January 2020 in a 44year-old Chinese woman from Hubei Province in China2. Almost six weeks later, Sri Lanka
identified the first COVID-19 patient who contracted the disease locally3. The number of COVID19 cases reported since then showed a gradual increase and included both imported and locally
transmitted cases. Since the country followed an aggressive policy of contact tracing and isolation
the health authorities were able to contain the situation4–6. However, on 22 April 2020, a sailor
from a Sri Lanka Navy camp outside the capital, Colombo, who was actively engaged in contact
tracing, tested positive for COVID-19, and 19 more sailors tested positive on the same day7. Since
then the outbreak has escalated, but has been contained within Navy camps, and many of the
COVID-19 positive sailors have been asymptomatic8. Sri Lanka has to date reported nine deaths
attributable to COVID-19, with the latest reported death on 5 May 20209.
Based on the four-stage classification of epidemics published by the WHO; ie. no cases, sporadic
cases, community clusters and community transmission, Sri Lanka is currently in the category of
community clusters10. At the time of writing this paper, Sri Lanka has been able to contain disease
transmission, preventing the occurrence of ‘community transmission’, where the risk of health
services in the country being overwhelmed is very high.
The measures countries take to tackle the effects of COVID-19 can be classified broadly as
mitigation methods and suppression methods11. In mitigation, the focus is to slow down the spread
of the virus and achieve a staggered onset. Although such measures would continue to allow the
spread of the disease, the health services are unlikely to be overwhelmed due to the slow spread of
the virus and communities would develop herd immunity, thereby easing the burden on the
countries. The measures adopted by the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom (at least in
the early stages of COVID-19 spread), were focused on mitigation11,12. Suppression methods were
focused on stopping the spread completely, and the measures are generally more forceful than for
disease mitigation. China, Vietnam and New Zealand adopted suppression measures which
enabled them to flatten the curve and reduce the burden on their health services13. Some European
countries such as Italy and Spain, changed their strategies from largely mitigation methods to

suppression after the numbers of positive cases and deaths increased exponentially11. Both
methods, mitigation and suppression, have their positive and negative health, economic and social
consequences. The steps adopted in Sri Lanka in tackling the epidemic were largely suppressive,
from the onset. These included, quarantining of all inbound passengers to the country, suspension
of inbound flights, closing of schools and universities, implementing an island wide curfew,
proactive contact tracing, quarantining and enforcing social distancing14.
The responses of governments to the pandemic, depending on the focus on mitigation or
suppression, may impart different stringency levels. For instance, Scandinavian countries and the
Netherlands have attempted to tackle the spread of COVID-19 by adopting less stringent
mitigation policies than countries such as Vietnam and China12,13. Thomas Hale et al describe an
index, based on the degree of stringency of government policies towards managing the COVID19 pandemic15. The stringency index, developed by a group of researchers from the University of
Oxford, considers multiple indicators including policies such as school closures, travel bans, and
financial indicators such as fiscal and monetary measures. The index simply refers to the strictness
of government policies in each country and is not necessarily indicative of how effective such
policies are. The stringency index varies from country to country and to varying degrees with
time, depending on the local disease situation, as was seen in Singapore with the emergence of
new disease clusters among immigrant workers15.
We believe that the stringency index could be a useful parameter in modeling COVID-19 disease
control, especially when countries have adopted policies which may be classified as suppressive.
While adopting strict policies seem to dampen the spread of COVID-19 and limit an acute rise in
the numbers, there is little evidence as to how the disease may behave as countries start to ease
control policies. This paper describes a projection model for COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka applied
to different scenarios utilizing the stringency index as a proxy of the total government response.
We aim to supplement already existing projection models for COVID-19 in Sri Lanka and identify
the change in COVID-19 disease spread with a changing stringency index and epidemiological
trends. This could help decision makers to visualize the potential effects of policy changes from
the perspective of the stringency of such measures.

Methods

For this analysis, we extracted publicly available data from the official website of the
Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medical Services, Sri Lanka16. and
other websites17–20. We have not used any personally identifiable data for this analysis. We
extracted data relevant to cases reported from 27 January 2020 to 10 May 2020. We did not include
the first case reported in Sri Lanka in the analysis, as the second case was reported more than six
weeks later and none of the cases reported subsequently were linked to the first case. Relevant
stringency indexes were extracted from Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker listing
the COVID-19 Stringency Index (C19SI)15 developed by the Oxford University, United Kingdom.
We extracted Government control measures from the Ministry of Health and other Government
sources14,16–20. We have plotted daily new cases and mapped the Government response against the
C19SI. We have mapped out the many interventions applied in Sri Lanka in responding to the
COVID-19 pandemic, in relation to the areas of the C19SI as indicated by C1–C8 (Containment
and Closure), E1–E4 (Economical Response), H1–H4 (Health System Response) and M1
(Miscellaneous). Further, we plotted C19SI and cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases
for seven selected countries with a view to validating the index for its applicability as a projection
tool. Since different countries had initiated their response measures at different points in time, we
plotted the C19SI from 14 days prior to the onset of the first case in each country, considering the
incubation period for COVID-19.
We have applied the SIR (susceptible, infected and removed/recovered) model, given its reliability
as a model applicable to large populations facilitating the predictions in disease outbreaks21,22. In
the SIR model, Susceptible (S) individuals are those at risk of infection, infected (I) indicates
individuals who are infected, and recovered or removed (R) includes those who may have
developed immunity or died. Movement between these three categories is governed by β and γ
which describe the “rate” of the infection and the infectious period, respectively23. The COVID19 Stringency Index was used as a proxy to replace the parameter β. The per-capita recovery rate,
, is usually difficult to influence, except through the introduction of vaccines24. Hence  is highly
unlikely to change over time during the current COVID-19 pandemic. In the absence of adequate
local data due to the limited number of cases, we have considered 11 days as the recovery period
to estimate the parameter in this study25. Using the SIR model and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

technique, we projected the number of COVID19 cases that would present based on existing
stringency measures in Sri Lanka up to 11 May 2020, and anticipated values for stringency index
based on current arrangements for exit thereafter. Based on reported cases and the documented
stringency index, the model was validated for its ability to predict the number of cases with 95%
confidence for a period of 14 days. Since a new cluster was identified from the Welisara Navy
Camp on 22 April 2020, which significantly changed the behavior of the epidemic, the validation
was done based on two periods of time: (1) using data for 11 March to 8 April and projecting from
9 to 22 April, and (2) using data from 11 March to 26 April and projecting from 27 April to 10
May.
Once the model was validated, we refined the projection by applying the model to the entire
country and high-risk areas respectively. Since S0 (the initial susceptible population) also plays a
key role in estimating the number of possible inflected population, two approaches were adopted:
(1) considering the entire population of Sri Lanka as susceptible (base-case scenario); (2)
considering only the population in the high-risk districts of Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara and
Puttalam as susceptible. We used the midyear population for 2019 (21,203,000) and the population
for individual districts estimated by the Department of Census and Statistics26 for this purpose.
Further, we estimated the number of cases that would have presented at hypothetical stringency
index values of 75% and 50% (maintained up to 11 May 2020) and relaxed in a gradual manner.
Finally, we extended the projection by advancing the dates of relaxing of stringency measures.
Results
As shown in Figure 1, most of the initial cases reported in Sri Lanka were among expatriates who
returned to the country from Italy, while the next significant cluster was observed among
participants of a religious activity. After the 19th of April, new cases were mainly due to two large
clusters: one found within Colombo (the first infected person within the cluster had arrived from
India); and the other at a Navy Camp housing more than 4,000 Navy personnel, most of whom
were on active COVID-19 contact tracing duty. Figure 1 illustrates how Sri Lanka initiated its
response to COVID-19 in advance of the first case and continued to heighten the response
gradually between the first and second cases (6 weeks apart), and further escalated its response
immediately after the second case, to a stringency index to 75% within one week and 97% within
two weeks.

Figure 2 illustrates changes in C19SI for eight countries including Sri Lanka (Panel A), and the
cumulative cases in each country over the same period of time (Panel B). Stringency Index for the
countries were plotted from 14 days prior to the first reported case/s for each country. Compared
to other countries, the Sri Lankan Government initiated control measures early. These measures
closely resemble the measures taken by Vietnam. The control measures were escalated rapidly just
after the first locally transmitted case was reported, and the Government Response Index reached
its highest level within two weeks. Although Italy and Spain had escalations similar to that of Sri
Lanka, it was after a considerable lag period. The United Kingdom and United States of America
demonstrated an even longer lag period. Singapore and South Korea have gradually enforced
stringency measures and demonstrate a stringency index below the other countries.
Panel B of Figure 2, shows the number of COVID-19 cases reported for the same time period using
a log scale. Countries that initiated their response early and escalated it before the case-load
increased have been able to maintain a lower number of cumulative cases: Vietnam, Sri Lanka
(less than 1000 cases) and South Korea (less than 10000 cases). Countries that had a high
stringency index with a delayed escalation have demonstrated a larger number of cases: Italy,
Spain, UK (around 200,000 cases) and USA (over 1.4 million cases).
Table 1 shows the projected number of new cases with 95% confidence interval for two-time
periods: from 9 to 22 April and from 27 April to 10 May. For both phases, actual reported values
lie within the 95% confidence interval of the prediction.

illustrates changes in the COVID-19 Stringency Index based on the following

assumptions: Open government and private offices without limiting work but continue the
lockdown for identified infection cluster locations in these areas till 1 of June 2020, further
relaxation for social movement activities such as gradually opening of universities, removing
traveling restrictions for the entire country by mid-June and “normalize” the country to operate
without any quarantine centers and re-open schools mid-July. The results suggest that Sri Lanka
will have 815 (95% CI, 753-877) active cases at the peak of the epidemic, occurring on 17 May
2020.

The projection was repeated out considering only the total population of four high-risk districts
(Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Puttalam) as susceptible, since the level of control measures
implemented in the high-risk areas was more stringent than in other areas of the country. Therefore,
the COVID-19 Stringency Index was modified to reflect the control measures implemented in
these areas. This projection estimates that the number of active cases will peak by the 18 of May
to 648 (95%CI, 699-696) for high-risk areas (Figure 4).

As shown in Figure 5, we made projections for two other scenarios in addition to our base-case
assumptions. Scenario 75% assumes only 75% of the actions under the base-case scenario will
be implemented by the government. This would result in a peak of 3,159 cases (95%CI, 2,9283,391) by 20 of May 2020. Scenario 50% assumes only 50% of the actions under the base-case
scenario will be implemented by the government. This would result in a peak of 928,824
(95%CI, 861,772-996,877) cases by 25 of May 2020.

Figure 6 shows the possible impact of advancing the relaxation of each level of control by a week
so that near normality would be advanced by one month. The model predicts a sharp increase in
active cases after 13th June where the peak number of active cases would rise to 4,526 (95%CI,
4,309-,4744) by 30th of June 2020.

Discussion
In this paper, we have used the COVID-19 Stringency Index as a proxy to manipulate the
parameter β in a SIR model, in order to enhance the predictability of future movements of the
epidemic curve, as it is linked to practical actions. The methodology of estimating of C19SI is well
documented in the BSG working papers. The extent of caseload is inversely related with the time
taken to initiate control measures and the C19SI. The C19SI represents a composite indicator based
on select response measures that have been globally practiced in suppressing the spread of COVID
19 and is updated regularly by the Oxford university research team. Therefore, we identified the
C19SI as a proxy measure to be used as parameter β of SIR model. This model was able to predict
the cases within 95% confidence for a period of two weeks. The second prediction had the full

trend from 11 March to 26 April which included the cluster that emerged from the Navy camp
which resulted in a three-fold increase in the number of cases for 4-5 days. Yet the prediction
model run with the full set of values from 11 March to 26 April was able to predict accurately with
95% confidence the case load for two weeks starting 27 April. Therefore, the model had
successfully factored in the surge of cases that emerged from the Navy cluster.
This would facilitate the real time estimation of the country specific C19SI for Sri Lanka, taking
into consideration the response measures that are being considered for relaxation and projecting
the case load based on the model using the C19SI at national and subnational levels. Based on the
current pattern of cases and the suppression measures, in place the model predicted some 872
active cases at the peak of transmission. These predictions are in line with some other local
predictions done by Weerasinghe (2020) using a SIR model with an active caseload of 1000
peaking after 90 days of onset28 and a separate group predicting based on a logistic regression
model a total case load of 998 (+/- 6 cases) and ending by 20 July19. Similar findings are obtained
from the model proposed by29 also using a SIR model. Further, based on our analysis, we have
projected for C19SI or Stringency Index to be relaxed from 94 to 80 on 14 May and further relaxed
to 60 by 1 June. The projection model has estimated that the number of active cases would increase
from 815 (95%CI, 753-877) peaking on 17 May to 4,526 (95%CI, 4,309-4,744) peaking on 30
June 2020.
Based on the information available on COVID-19 cases and deaths reported from different
countries, it is clear that varying levels of mitigation and suppression measures have been
employed by different countries. The comparison of C19SI with the corresponding number of
cases of COVID 19 reported by each country demonstrates a relationship between the timing of
the response measures and the combination of the response measures put in place. In their report
Walker et.al from the Imperial College group suggested that delays in implementing suppression
strategies could lead to worse outcomes and fewer lives saved. For example, if suppression
strategies are initiated when death rates are at 0.2 per 100 000 population per week and are
sustained, this will save up to 38.7 million lives globally. Even if suppression strategies are
initiated late when the death rates are as high as 1.6 per 100 000 population per week this could
still save up to 30.7 million lives. The observation that there are more than 1.4 million cases for
USA and more than 250,000 cases in UK, Spain, Italy and Russia, and far fewer numbers of cases

in Vietnam, New Zealand and Sri Lanka can be explained by the different suppression strategies
adopted by these countries30.
The accuracy of traditional forecasting models largely depends on the availability of data. In
epidemics there may be no data at all in the beginning and with limited data early on in the
epidemic, making predictions very uncertain. We have only begun to understand the nature of
COVID-19 due to it being a novel infection and do not have the full information to fashion
epidemiological predication models readily. Obtaining quality data on the numbers of cases, deaths
and tests have been a challenge. Concerns regarding poor quality of data at the onset of any
epidemic and problems in getting sharable data readily have been previously documented. Further,
we are also limited by the paucity of real time data on implementation of the mitigation and
suppression measures employed and to what extent these measures were adhered to by different
population groups at national and subnational levels. Although we have mapped many
interventions, there was no evidence to support that all of them were adhered to universally.
Further, we felt that it would have been more effective to have a detailed index for the country
which captures all the measures implemented by health authorities and other agencies. Such an
index would be a refinement of the C19SI.
Conclusions and Recommendations
The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker documents the stringency by which a
government implements mitigation and suppression measures in controlling the spread of COVID19. This stringency index accommodates all measures that governments across the globe have
implemented and is therefore considered valid in the context of Sri Lanka as well. The C19SI
provides a framework for generating a composite index based on many interventions, which in
turn was used as a basis for the proposed model (parameter β) in this paper. The predictions made
through the model therefore reflects on the number of cases that may result when control measures
are relaxed at each point in time. The prediction model has demonstrated its ability to predict the
number of cases for 14 days in advance with a 95% confidence. This prediction model based on
the C19SI will be a useful tool for the timing and the extent of relaxing the many suppression and
mitigation measures implemented by governments.
