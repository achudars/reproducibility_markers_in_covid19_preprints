Risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality outcomes of COVID-19 patients on
the 14th and 28th day of the disease course: a retrospective cohort study in Bangladesh
Original Research Article
Summary
Diverse risk factors intercede the outcomes of COVID-19. We conducted this retrospective
cohort study to identify the risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality outcomes with a
cohort of 1016 COVID-19 patients diagnosed in May 2020. Data were collected by telephoneinterview and reviewing records using a questionnaire and checklist. Morbidity (64.4% Vs.
6.0%) and mortality (2.3% Vs. 2.5%) outcomes varied between the 14th and 28th day. Morbidity
risk factors included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (RR=1.19, RR=2.68) both
on the 14th and 18th day while elderly (AOR=2.56) and smokeless tobacco (SLT) (AOR=2.17)
on the 28th day. Mortality risk factors included elderly (AOR=10.14), COPD (RR=5.93), and
SLT (AOR=2.25) on the 14th day, and elderly (AOR=24.37) and COPD (RR=2.72) on the 28th
day. The morbidity risk was higher with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (RR=3.33) and chronic
liver disease (CLD) (RR=3.99) on the 28th day. The mortality risk was higher with coronary
heart disease (RR=4.54) and CLD (RR=9.66) on the 14th while with diabetes mellitus (RR=3.08,
RR=2.08), hypertension (RR=3.14, RR=2.30), CKD (RR=8.97, RR=2.71), and malignant
diseases (RR=10.29) on both 14th and 28th day. We must espouse program interventions
considering the morbidity and mortality risk factors to condense the aggressive outcomes of
COVID-19.
Key words: Cohort, COVID-19 patients, Risk factors, Morbidity, Mortality and Outcomes.

Introduction
A newly emergent coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
was first documented in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 as an outbreak
of pneumonia of mysterious cause [1]. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy, and established practice,
on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease as COVID-19
[2]. WHO declared COVID-19 as a global emergency on 30 January 2020 [3] and as pandemic
on 11 March 2020 [4]. Globally 213 countries are confronting the grave consequences of the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The situation is sprouting rapidly with increasing case counts and
deaths worldwide [5]. In this course, Bangladesh is also confronting the tolls of morbidity and
mortality posed by this highly infectious disease with community transmission across the
country.
The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 appears to be in a wide range, encompassing asymptomatic
infection, mild (40%) or moderate (40%) disease, severe disease (15%) that requires oxygen
support, and only 5% critical disease [1]. The incubation period of COVID-19 infection is
around 5.2 days and the period from the onset of symptoms to death ranges from 6 to 41 days
with a median of 14 days [6]. A study conducted in Wuhan of China found that increased age
and various comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM) were associated with the
severity of COVID-19. But the study didn’t identify the tobacco use and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) as the risk factors for COVID-19 [7].
Another study in China found that nearly half of the patients had comorbidity where
hypertension was the most common followed by DM and coronary heart disease (CHD). The
study also established the association between increased age and death of the COVID-19 patients
[8]. Another study showed that severe patients were older and had comorbidities including

hypertension (30.0%), diabetes mellitus (12.1%), and cardiovascular diseases. The median age
was 64 years in severe cases and 51.5 years in non-severe cases [7]. The presence of any
comorbidity was more common among the severe patients than those having a mild or moderate
disease (38.7% vs. 21.0%) with a similar exposure history between the two groups of disease
severity [9].
Widespread shreds of evidence have emphasized the harmful impact of tobacco use possibly
related to adverse outcomes of COVID-19. One of the leading studies conducted in the Wuhan
city of China found higher percentages of current and former tobacco users among the patients
that needed ICU support, mechanical ventilation or who had died, and a higher prevalence of
smoking among the severe cases [10].
A study conducted on outcomes of the COVID-19 patients found that non-survivors were more
often older and men, and they had a higher prevalence of DM, hyperlipidemia, and CHDs. The
history of current tobacco use and having COPD was more among the non-survivors [11].
However, the pandemic is still under progression, diverse risk factors influence the outcomes of
COVID-19, but relevant data and studies are very scarce in Bangladesh. Therefore, it is
irrefutably obligatory to determine the risk factors to avert the aggressive consequences of
COVID-19 patients. Based on these realities, in this particular study, we aimed to identify the
risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality outcomes of COVID-19 patients.
Methods:
Study setting, design, and population
This observational retrospective cohort study was conducted on the National Institute of
Preventive and Social Medicine (NIPSOM), Dhaka, Bangladesh during the period from March to
June 2020. The study enrolled a cohort of laboratory-confirmed 1016 COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)

patients diagnosed at the central laboratory of NIPSOM, Dhaka. The NIPSOM is the apex public
health institute holding the central laboratory designated for COVID-19 diagnosis, approved by
the Ministry of Health and Family Warfare, the government of Bangladesh. The participant who
had no contact telephone/cell phone number; who didn’t respond to a phone call on three (03)
separate occasions within 28 days of diagnosis; who were unwilling; and who had incomplete
interview were excluded from the study.
Cohort:
The cohort comprised of all the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, who were diagnosed
at the central laboratory of NIPSOM during the period from 01 to 30 May 2020 by real-time
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal (NP) /
Oropharyngeal (OP) / Nasal swab.
Exposures:
The exposures were the risk factors linked with the morbidity and mortality outcomes of the
COVID-19 patients, which included baseline characteristics, comorbidity, and tobacco use.
Outcomes:
Both morbidity (cure/not-cured) and mortality (survivors/non-survivor) outcomes of the COVID19 were identified and compared between exposed and non-exposed groups on the 14th and 28th
day of the disease course.
Sample size and sampling
Initially, all the 1187 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients diagnosed in May 2020 were
selected as the study cohort. Finally, 1016 COVID-19 patients were enrolled as the study
samples considering the selection criteria and single-centered cluster sampling technique. All the
COVID-19 patients formed the sampling frame and each patient was a sampling unit.

Data collection and analysis
Data were collected by telephone interview and medical records review using a semi-structured
questionnaire and checklist respectively. Each telephone interview session was recorded by a
digital recorder to ensure the validity of data. The data collection instruments were pretested on
the COVID-19 patients diagnosed in April 2020 and accordingly necessary corrections were
performed for finalization. Participation of the COVID-19 patients was voluntary and informed
consent was obtained from each participant before data collection. In case of non-survivor, data
were collected from the eligible family member of the respective non-survivor. Measures were
taken to ensure data quality; inconsistency and irrelevance of data were checked and corrected.
Data were analysed using SPSS STATISTICS (Version 25.0, IBM Statistical Product and
Service Solutions, Armonk, NY, USA).
Statistical analysis
The normality of the variables was tested with the Shapiroe Wilk test/Kolmogorov Smirnov tests
of Normality. Continuous data were written in the form of mean and standard deviation.
Categorical data were reported as counts and percentages. Descriptive statistics estimated mean,
standard deviation, and frequency while inferential statistics included chi-square test, logistic
regression, Relative Risk (RR), and Attributable Risk (AR). A p-value <0.05 was considered
significant. All the statistical tests were two-sided and were performed at a significance level of

α= 0.05.
Measurement of exposure and outcome
Exposures were measured by assessing exposure on the risk factors including baseline
characteristics, comorbidity, tobacco consumption, of the COVID-19 patients retrospectively.

Outcomes were measured by assessing the morbidity outcome in terms of cured or not-cured and
the mortality outcome in terms of survivor or non-survivor.
Ethics
The study was conducted by maintaining all kinds of ethical issues in different stages of the
study. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) of
NIPSOM, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Informed consent was obtained from the participants by
informing the purpose and procedure, expected duration, nature, and anticipated physical and
psychological risks and benefits of participating. The confidentiality of data and privacy of the
participants was strictly maintained. The participants were offered the right to withdraw their
consent at any stage of the study. Data were stored into the computer at the central office,
NIPSOM under the direct supervision of the principal investigator. Data were used anonymously
for the present study only.
Results
Out of 1187 COVID-19 patients, 1016 (85.6%) were enrolled followed by 6.6% had a wrong
contact number, 3.5% didn’t attend phone calls, 3.3% were unwilling to participate and 1.0% had
an incomplete interview -Figure 1.
Baseline characteristics of COVID-19 patients
Among 1016 COVID-19 patients, the majority (64.1%) were males 89.9% were aged ≤59 years
and the median (IQR) age was 37.0 (28-49) years. Of all, 72.6% were married and 39.6%
completed their graduation, the majority (32.5%) were service holders and 18.6% were health
workforce. More than two-third (69.3%) was from urban settings and around three-fourth
(72.7%) was from a nuclear family. The majority (37.0%) had monthly family income between
TK.10000-30000 and their average monthly family income was TK.52859(±51000.37) -Table 1.

Comorbidity
More than one third (33.9%) patients had at least 1 comorbidity. Major comorbidities were; DM
(35.0%) hypertension (28.4%), COPD (16.6%), CHD (7.8%), chronic liver disease, CLD (2.5%),
chronic kidney disease, CKD (4.1%), and malignant diseases (1.8%) -Figure 2.
Outcomes of the COVID-19 patients
Morbidity outcomes included 35.6% cured and 64.4% not-cured on the 14th day of the disease
while 94.0% cured and 6.0% not-cured on the 28th day. On the contrary, mortality outcomes
included 97.7% survivors and 2.3% non-survivors on the 14th day while 97.5% survivors and
2.5% non-survivors on the 28th day -Figure 3.
Risk factors associated with outcomes of COVID-19 patients on the 14th day
Regarding morbidity related risk factors, COPD was significantly (p<0.05) higher among the
not-cured (9.8%) than the cured (5.8%) patients. Regarding mortality related risk factors, elderly
(60.9%) and having comorbidity (78.3%) current smokeless tobacco (SLT) use (39.1% Vs.
8.7%), COPD (13.3% Vs, 3.3%), CKD (17.4% Vs. 1.7%), and CLD (13.0% Vs. 1.1%) were
significantly (p<0.01) higher among the non-survivors than the survivors. On the other hand,
DM (39.1% Vs. 16.5%), CHD (17.4% Vs. 4.0%), hypertension (34.8% Vs. 13.8%) and
malignant diseases (8.7% Vs, 0.6%) were also significantly (p<0.05) higher among the nonsurvivors than the survivors -Table 2.
Risk factors associated with outcomes of COVID-19 patients on the 28th day
Regarding morbidity associated risk factors, the elderly (24.6% Vs. 9.2%) were significantly
(ρ<0.01) higher among the not-cured than the cured patients. Having comorbidity (45.9% Vs.
33.1%), current SLT use (9.8% Vs. 3.6%), CKD (6.6% Vs. 1.8%) and CLD (4.9% Vs. 1.0%)
were also significantly (ρ<0.05) higher among the not-cured than the cured patients. COPD

(19.7% Vs. 7.6%), CKD (6.6% Vs. 1.8%) CLD (4.9% Vs. 1.0%) were also significantly higher
among the not-cured than the cured patients (ρ<0.05). Regarding mortality associated risk
factors, the elderly (56.0% Vs. 2.8%) and having comorbidity (88.0% Vs. 22.2%) were
significantly higher among the non-survivors than the survivors (ρ<0.01). DM (36.0% Vs.
11.1%), hypertension (36.0% Vs. 8.3%) and CKD (16.0% Vs. 0.0%) were also significantly
higher among the non-survivors than the survivors (ρ<0.05) -Table 3.
Logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk of ‘not-cured’ (morbidity) was significantly
higher (p<0.05) among the elderly (AOR:2.56, 95% CI:1.31–4.99), patients with comorbidity
(OR:1.72, 95% CI:1.02–2.89) and current SLT users (OR:2.95, 95% CI:1.19–7.34) on the 28th
day. The risk of ‘non-survivor’ (mortality) was significantly (p<0.01) higher in the elderly
(AOR: 10.14, 95% CI: 3.98-25.79) and patients having comorbidity (AOR: 4.32, 95% CI: 1.4912.60) on the 14th day. On the contrary, the risk of being non-survivor outcome was significantly
higher among the elderly (AOR: 24.37, 95% CI: 2.59-229.37) and patients with comorbidity
(AOR: 7.91, 95% CI: 1.91-32.70) -Table 4.
Relative Risk and Attributable Risk of outcomes of COVID-19 patients
The risk of ‘not-cured’ outcome was higher (RR:1.19, AR:11.92%) among the patients with
COPD on the 14th day while it was higher among the elderly (RR:2.89, AR:9.52%) and patients
with comorbidity (RR:1.66, AR: 3.23%), current SLT users (RR=2.66, AR: 9.36%), CKD
(RR:3.33, AR:3.32%), CLD (RR:3.99, AR:17.29%) and COPD (RR:2.68, AR:8.85%) on the 28th
day. The risk of ‘non-survivor’ outcome was higher among the elderly (RR:13.63, AR:19.36%),
patients with comorbidity (RR:6.86, AR: 6.83%), current SLT users (RR=3.94, AR:9.33%), DM
(RR:3.08, AR:5.38%), CHD (RR:4.54, AR:10.75%), hypertension (RR:3.14, AR:5.74%), CKD

patients with comorbidity (RR:4.71, AR:56.28%), DM (RR:2.08, AR:35.90%), hypertension
(RR:2.30, AR:42.35%) and CKD (RR:2.71, AR:63.16) on the 28th day -Table 5.
Discussion
This single centered retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify the risk factors
associated with the outcomes of COVID-19 patients on the 14th day and the 28th day of the
disease course. The study results on morbidity and mortality associated risk factors including
age, comorbidity, and tobacco consumption propose decisive academic, policy, preventive,
promotive, and curative strategies and interventions to combat the COVID-19 impact.
Strength and weakness of the study
The current study is the pioneering initiative for the first time done in Bangladesh on the risk
factors associated with outcomes of COVID-19 patients. This observational retrospective cohort
design was scientifically apposite and feasible for identifying multiple risk factors at a single
attempt. The sample size was large enough to draw a valid inference on the risk factors linked
with the outcomes of COVID-19 patients considering both morbidity and mortality
consequences. Though the study results might not reflect the scenario of the whole country, it
offers an impression on the problem under the study with an urban-rural mix and representation
of the population of the COVID-19 patients. Despite a few limitations of recall bias that emerged
through a telephone-interview and wrong telephone contact number, the study findings conserve
irrefutable policy implications for prevention and control of the worst outcomes of the COVID19 patients.

Baseline characteristics
Though the males (64.1%) have a reasonably higher risk of being affected by COVID-19 than
their counterpart females (35.9%), but no significant gender difference of outcomes was revealed
in our study. Similar findings were also found by other studies [7-8, 12-13] where males were
being affected more than females. It is evident that the males are more involved in outdoor
activities in our context and thus they are more vulnerable than the females. Though the majority
(89.9%) of the patients were aged ≤59 years, the adverse outcomes were more prevalent among
elderly patients (≥60 years). Urban prevalence (69.3%) was higher than the rural; it could be
argued that unplanned urbanization, higher population density, and industrialization in the urban
areas increase disease transmission and prevalence. Moreover, more aware urban people undergo
laboratory tests for COVID-19 more than the rural people. By occupation, lion shareholders were
service holders (32.5%) and health workforce (18.6%). It is evident that the service holders
including bankers, security forces, police, and community forces provide various emergency
services and are exposed to COVID-19 infection. The health workforce including doctors,
nurses, and supporting staff are more vulnerable for the COVID-19 as they have to provide
healthcare in direct contact with the patients. Besides, poor quality and quantity of personal
protective equipment (PPE) also aggravate their vulnerability for the disease.
Comorbidity and outcomes of COVID-19 patients
Of all, 33.9% patients had diverse comorbidities including DM (35.0%), hypertension (28.4%),
COPD (16.6%), and CHD (7.8%). Another study conducted in Wuhan, China [8] also identified
DM, hypertension, COPD, and CHD as major comorbidities with the COVID-19 patients. A
large difference (64.4% Vs. 6.0%) of morbidity outcome (not-cured) while a small difference
(2.3% and 2.5%) of mortality outcome was revealed between the 14th and 28th day of the disease

course respectively. It reflects that the worst mortality outcome occurs within the first 14 days
while most of the patients come round by the second 14 days of the disease. So, patient
management for the first 14 days must be emphasized and prioritized considering associated risk
factors to reduce the morbidity and mortality burden of COVID-19. A study conducted in China
revealed different findings, where the death rate was 3.6% among Chinese patients and 1.5%
among patients outside China [14]. This discrepancy demands comprehensive comparative
studies, but it may be the result of differences in host factors like body immunity, comorbidity,
food habit, etc. and agent factors like genomes, virulence, transmission probability, etc. between
the geographies.
Risk factors associated with morbidity outcome
COPD (RR=1.19, AR%=11.92) and elderly (AOR=2.56, RR=2.89) were significantly associated
with the ‘not-cured’ morbidity outcome on the 14th and 28th day of the disease. Other relevant
studies [12, 15] showed similar findings in respect of age, COPD, and morbidity outcomes. It is
established that poor body immunity of the elderly patients instigates the worse progression and
adverse outcomes of the COVID-19. Current SLT use (OR=2.96, RR=2.66), CKD (RR=3.33),
and CLD (RR=3.99) were found independently associated with morbidity (‘not-cured’) outcome
of COVID-19 on the 28th day. It could be explained by the fact that comorbidity increases the
severity of COVID-19 and prolong the morbid condition.
Risk factors associated with mortality outcome
Elderly (AOR=10.14, RR=13.63) and having comorbidity (AOR=4.33, RR=6.86) were
significantly associated with the mortality outcome of COVID-19 on the 14th day of the disease.
A study conducted in Wuhan, China [8] also showed similar findings. Though the majority of the
patients of our study were in the middle age group, the mortality rate was higher among the

elderly. It can be justified by the fact that compromised body immunity of the elderly patients
having comorbidity could not win the fight with COVID-19 rather confront the worst outcome.
Mortality outcome (non-survivor/death) was also significantly associated with COPD
(RR=5.93), DM (RR=3.08), CHD (RR=4.54), hypertension (RR=3.14), CKD (RR=8.97), CLD
(RR=9.66), and malignant diseases (RR=10.29) on the 14th day. It is recognized that all the
comorbidities weaken the immune system of the patients and aggravate the worst mortality
outcome. Though current smoking didn`t show any significant association with the morbidity
and morbidity outcomes and current SLT use was independently associated with the mortality on
the 14th day of the disease (OR=4.36, RR=3.94). It is reported that 27.5% adult people (26.9 %
men, 28.1% women) of Bangladesh take ‘zarda’, ‘khoinee’, ‘gul’, ‘sadapata’, ‘nossi’, etc., which
are local smokeless tobacco products [16]. It is argued that smokeless tobacco induces
pathophysiological changes in the upper respiratory tract, which makes the virus more
progressive and aggressive to aggravate acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality.
Further intensive research and analysis could be conducted to establish the scientific arguments
on this association in the Indian sub-continent including Bangladesh.
On the 28th day, mortality outcome was significantly associated with the elderly (AOR=24.367,
RR=3.90) and having comorbidity (AOR=7.908, RR=4.71). Another retrospective study
conducted in Wuhan; China [8] also revealed that higher median age (69.0 years) of the nonsurvivors than the survivors (52.0 years). The study also found comorbidity more in the nonsurvivors (67%) than the survivors (40%). Mortality outcome was also significantly associated
with COPD (RR=2.72), DM (RR=2.08), hypertension (RR=2.30), and CKD (RR=2.71). These
findings were consistent with other relevant studies conducted in different countries [8,12,14]. It

is claimed that the comorbidity deteriorates the defensive mechanism of the patients and worsen
the mortality outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Policy and public health implications
The identified risk factors associated with the outcomes of the COVID-19 patients conserve
crucial policy implications for prevention and control of the morbidity and mortality burden of
the disease. The study results could contribute to strengthen and reorganize the health care
delivery system of the country for providing need-oriented and prioritized services to COVID-19
patients emphasizing the first fourteen days of the disease. The study findings could also
contribute to devising effective strategies for the provision of comprehensive health care to
COVID-19 patients with comorbidity. Policymakers, health care managers, and relevant
stakeholders may use the study findings to revise the national treatment guidelines considering
the risk factors, adverse outcomes, and disease course of the COVID-19.
Acknowledgments: The authors are indebted to all the staff of the central laboratory of
NIPSOM for their technical assistance in data generation. We are also obliged to all the COVID19 patients and their families for participating in the study.
Financial support: This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the
