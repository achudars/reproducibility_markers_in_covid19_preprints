Abstract
Background
Non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) remains the most reliable COVID-19 containment tool
for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) given the inequality of vaccine distribution and
their vulnerable healthcare systems. We aimed to develop mathematical models that capture
LMIC demographic characteristics such as young population and large household size and assess
NPI eﬀectiveness in rural and urban communities.
Methods
We constructed synthetic populations for rural, non-slum urban and slum settings to capture
LMIC demographic characteristics that vary across communities. We integrated age mixing and
household structure into contact networks for each community setting and simulated COVID-19
outbreaks within the networks. Using this agent-based model, we evaluate NPIs including testing
and isolation, tracing and quarantine, and physical distancing. We explored the optimal
containment strategies for rural and urban communities by designing and simulating
setting-speciﬁc strategies that deploy rapid diagnostic test, symptom screening, contact tracing
and physical distancing. We performed extensive simulations to capture the uncertainty of
outbreak trajectories and the impact of varying model parameters.
Findings
We found the impact of testing, tracing and distancing varies with rural-urban settings. In rural
communities, we found implementing either high quality (sensitivity > 50%) antigen rapid
diagnostic tests or moderate physical distancing could contain the transmission. Additionally,
antibody rapid diagnostic tests and symptom-based diagnosis could be useful for mitigating the
transmission. In non-slum urban communities, we demonstrated that both physical distancing
and case ﬁnding are essential for containing COVID-19 (average infection rate < 10%). In slum
communities, we found physical distancing is less eﬀective compared to rural and non-slum
urban communities. Lastly, for all communities considered, we demonstrated contact quarantine
is essential for eﬀective containment and is eﬀective at a low compliance rate (30%).
Interpretation
Our ﬁndings could guide setting-speciﬁc strategy design for diﬀerent communities in LMICs.
Our assessments also have implications on applying rapid diagnostic tests and symptom-based
diagnosis for case ﬁnding, tracing and distancing in lower-income communities.

Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the
COVID-19, has rapidly spread worldwide since the end of 2019. (Zhu et al., 2020) Without
eﬀective pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., vaccines), many low- and middle- income countries
(LMICs) rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to control COVID-19, (Brauner et al.,
2021; J. N. Nkengasong et al., 2020) such as physical distancing, travel restriction, and testing
and tracing programs. While contributing to COVID-19 control, these NPIs may cause
considerable damage to the economies as people put their life and work on hold. (Hodgins &
Saad, 2020) Therefore, evaluating the eﬀectiveness of NPIs could inform government decisions
and ease the burden on the economy and society. (Brauner et al., 2021)

Many COVID-19 containment policies rely on testing which can be challenging to implement in
LMIC because of the limited clinical resources (Bong et al., 2020; Murthy et al., 2015) and
laboratory capacities. (Hasell et al., 2020; J. Nkengasong, 2020) Speciﬁcally, the real-time
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the most common tool for detecting
SARS-CoV-2, requires lab facilities that are insuﬃcient in LMICs. (Corman et al., 2020; Shen et
al., 2020) These limitations pose challenges for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 transmission,
which is crucial to LMICs due to their vulnerable healthcare systems. Therefore, it is essential to
leverage alternative testing methods, such as rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) based on antigen or
host antibody detection (Jacobs et al., 2020; Krueger et al., 2020; Organization & Others, 2020;
Porte et al., 2020) which is less resource-demanding. Additionally, community healthcare
workers could perform contact tracing and quarantine to further mitigate the SARS-CoV-2
transmission, which has been implemented successfully during HIV and Tuberculosis outbreaks.
(Shapiro et al., 2012) Combining RDT, contact tracing and quarantine, we can increase the
testing capacity, ensure early and accurate detection of infected cases, and to contain disease
transmission and avoid complete lockdown.

In this study, we evaluated the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission in younger populations that
are typical of LMICs and the eﬀectiveness of testing, tracing and distancing. We constructed an

agent-based model using synthetic contact networks that reﬂect the demographic structures in
lower-income communities. To account for the diﬀerent infection rates across geographical
locations, (Baqui et al., 2020; El-Sadr & Justman, 2020), we simulated SARS-CoV-2
transmission in the rural, non-slum urban and slum settings of LMICs and captured the
uncertainty of the epidemic sizes by replicating the simulation with bootstrap samples of contact
networks. For each setting, we evaluated the impact of various testing methods with or without
physical distancing on COVID-19 transmission. Our simulation results suggest combined
strategies of testing, close contact tracing and moderate physical distancing could reduce the
number of infections signiﬁcantly. We also showed that RDT and symptom-based diagnosis
could be deployed in several settings for better containment outcomes.

Material and methods
Processing demographic data
We cited the age distribution and household sizes from the United nation. (Department of
Economic and Social Aﬀairs, 2020; United Nation, 2017) (Supplementary Table 1) We
considered three age groups (0-14, 15-25 and 25+ years old) for simplicity and to capture the
susceptibility of the younger population and contact structure diﬀerences between younger and
older groups. We cited the contact survey data from a study in Uganda to compute age-speciﬁc
contact matrices, contact numbers, and contact distribution within households (le Polain de
Waroux et al., 2018). To compare the model using diﬀerent demographic data, we included
projected contact matrices from Kenya, South Africa and Nigeria. (Prem et al., 2017) We chose
Kenya and South Africa as their projected data were compared with empirical data in the cited
study; we chose Nigeria as it is located in Western Africa and has a large population. When
using the contact matrices in simulation, we scaled the contact matrix to match the average daily
contact number under each community setting. (Table 1)

Agent-based modelling
We used an agent-based model and conﬁgured the communities based on the age distributions
and household sizes in South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda. We modelled three diﬀerent

community settings for LMICs: non-slum urban areas, rural areas, and slums, which diﬀer in
parameters including household sizes, daily close contact numbers, and percentage of contact
between members from the same household. (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2018) (Table
1) For each community setting, we simulated 20 synthetic populations, where each household
composed of at least one adult above age 25, and each household was assigned to a location on a
two-dimensional plane. The contact networks for the synthetic population were conﬁgured for
the corresponding household structure, age-speciﬁc contact matrices, and geographical
clustering, using an Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM). (Robins et al., 2007) See
Supplemental Methods for details on the ERGM.

After constructing the synthetic populations with contact and household structure, we randomly
choose one of the 20 synthetic populations and simulated COVID-19 transmission initiated by
importing 2 cases. At each time step of a simulated outbreak, one realized contact network of
ERGM was sampled to represent the daily dynamic of contacts. (Figure 1) Infection events were
sampled among the contacts proportional to the transmissibility multiplied by generation time,
which is a Weibull distribution that has a mode on the day of onset. (Sun et al., 2020) The day of
onset for each infected individual was sampled from the cited incubation time distribution
(Ferretti et al., 2020). The susceptibility of the younger group (0-14 years old) was set to 50% of
that of the older group (15+ years old). (Davies et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) Using the
age-dependent susceptibility and basic reproduction number, we computed the next generation
matrix and the transmissibility. (Supplementary Methods) At each infection event, we sampled
whether an infected individual is asymptomatic using a Bernoulli distribution of probability
equal to 30%. (Table 1) For detailed parameterization of transmission dynamics, see
Supplementary Methods.

We tested our model from two perspectives. Firstly, we tested if our model reﬂects the cited
contact data and transmission dynamics by comparing the simulated contact distribution and
generation time with the empirical data. (Figure 2) Secondly, we tested if the cited generation
time and incubation time capture the temporal dynamics of transmission by comparing the

growth curve in our simulation to those of the UK (March 10th to March 24th) and China (January
9th to January 23rd) (Z. Wu & McGoogan, 2020) before lockdown. We assumed no major
behavioural change in the populations and constant case discovery rates within the selected time
interval for these two countries. Moreover, we compared the averaged outbreak trajectories of the
four countries simulated, and proceeded with synthetic populations of Uganda, because no
obvious deviation was observed (Supplementary Figure 1).

NPI simulation
We evaluated the impact of testing alone and in combination with other NPIs, which include
contact tracing, quarantine, and physical distancing, for LMICs. (Figure 1B) The testing methods
considered were PCR, antigen RDT and antibody RDT. We simulated that only individuals with
symptoms and agree to be tested will receive testing. In our simulation, an infected individual
with symptoms will be discovered at a rate which is the product of four parameters: healthcare
seeking rate, test consent rate, sampling success rate and lab sensitivity of the test. Values and
sources of testing parameters were summarised in Table 2.

Our simulation assumes a test is always performed with close contact tracing and quarantine,
unless speciﬁed otherwise. We assumed only close contacts of conﬁrmed cases who consent to
be isolated will be tracked. Therefore, the overall quarantine rate is determined by the product of
three parameters: isolation consent rate of the infector, tracing success rate (we assumed a tracing
success rate equal to 100% for members within the same household of the infector) and
quarantine consent rate of the contacts. Physical distancing was modelled by reducing the
number of contacts outside the households. We simulated the eﬀect of physical distancing by
reducing the out-of-household contact number by 20% to 80% with 20% increments. We
approximate the eﬀective reproduction number Re under physical distancing by scaling Re
proportionally to the average daily contact numbers.

To identify the eﬀective NPIs for LMICs, we simulated combined testing strategies. The
strategies evaluated included 1) a symptom-based quarantine with low compliance rate

performed with PCR testing, 2) a symptom-based quarantine with low compliance rate
performed with PCR testing and antibody RDT, 3) and antigen RDT in combination with PCR
testing. (Supplementary Table 2) The availability of PCR testing is assumed to be aﬄuent for
non-slum urban areas, limited for slums and not available for rural areas. All three strategies
were replicated with and without physical distancing for 200 outbreak trajectories to estimate the
average daily incidence number. We simulated each trajectory for 100 days to guarantee that the
transmission extincts within the synthetic population.

Sensitivity analysis
We performed the sensitivity analysis separately for baseline conditions and for intervened
conditions. For the baseline conditions, we simulated outbreaks over grids of values for
transmission and demographic variables that are assumed or could not be determined from
literature. We computed R2 using the total infected number as the dependent variable to capture
the proportion of variance explained by each variable. (Table 1). For the intervened conditions,
we performed the same simulations over grids of values for testing and NPI variables. We
computed the R2 using infected numbers under three diﬀerent intervention strategies as the
dependent variables and testing/NPI variables in Supplementary table 3 as independent variables.
In total we have 2,028 simulation settings (3 community settings, 4 containing strategies and 169
values for the variables) which are listed in Supplementary table 4. For each simulation setting,
we simulated 200 simulated trajectories of 100 days to obtain the bootstrap conﬁdence interval
(BCI) of the estimated infection numbers.

When simulating single testing methods under the non-slum urban scenario, we found that using
symptom-based diagnosis, PCR, antibody RDT or antigen RDT alone will isolate or quarantine
more than 25% of the population and reduce the proportion of population infected as the
isolation compliance rate increases. (Figure 3B) When isolation compliance rates are at
optimistic levels (i.e. symptom-based = 20%, test-based = 90%), antigen RDT testing
outperformed other methods and reduced the infection rate (computed as the proportion of
population that are infected) to 47.4% [95% BCI 45.8% - 49.1%].

When simulating physical distancing alone under the baseline condition, we found that the
infection number reduces as the out-of-household contact number reduces. (Figure 3C) The
transmission almost stopped when non-household contact number was reduced by 80% (Re =
1.01), compared to the scenario without physical distancing (Re = 2.48) where 72.4% [95% BCI:
70.6% - 74.2%] of the population was infected. When simulating physical distancing with
symptom-based diagnosis, PCR testing, antibody RDT or antigen RDT using the optimistic
compliance rates for isolation and quarantine (Table 2), we found these detection and quarantine
methods could mitigate the transmission. When physical distancing reduces 60% of
non-household contact, using antigen RDT testing for isolation and quarantine performs the best
by reducing infection rate to 14.1% (95% BCI 12.5% - 15.7%).

When simulating disease outbreak in relation to combined testing strategies (Supplementary
Table 2), we found that the symptom-based diagnosis with auxiliary PCR testing (type 1
combined strategy) could provide better outcomes (48.9% infected [95% BCI: 46.4% - 50.5%] )
than either method alone, while additional antibody testing (type 2 combined strategy) did not
provide noticeable containment power (46.9% infected). (Figure 3D) Antigen RDT testing with
auxiliary PCR (type 3 combined strategy) provided the strongest mitigating eﬀect, with 41.0%
[95% BCI: 39.4% - 42.7%] of the population infected. Though the combined eﬀect of antigen
RDT and PCR testing is not much stronger than using antigen RDT testing alone. When physical
distancing reduces out-of-household contact number by 60%, the transmission is delayed and the
infection rate is reduced to 21.8%. When type 3 combined strategy is performed with physical

distancing, the infection rate is reduced to 5.6%. (Figure 4A) Combined, these results show that
although combination strategies could mitigate the transmission in the non-slum urban setting,
delaying the transmission with physical distancing is essential for containing the outbreaks.

Transmission and containment in diﬀerent community settings
When simulated outbreaks under diﬀerent community settings, we found the transmission in
rural areas (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2018) were slower and the ﬁnal epidemic sizes
were smaller (29.2% infected [95% BCI: 26.6% - 31.9%]) than the urban settings (Figure 4A,
Supplementary Figure 2, Supplementary Table 2). Using antigen RDT for case ﬁnding and
contact tracing could reduce the infection rate to 11.6% [95% BCI: 10.1% - 13.1%]. When
simulating a moderate physical distancing by blocking 40% out-of-household contacts in rural
communities, we observed a signiﬁcant containment of the outbreak (6.2% infected), while
adding antigen RDT for case ﬁnding and contact tracing could further reduce infection rate to
2.4%. Results from the non-slum urban setting is the baseline community discussed in the
previous section. Slum setting is simulated with a large household size (mean = 15) and a high
proportion (50%) of contacts between members from the same household. Infection rate is high
(mean = 82.9%) and using antigen RDT with limited PCR tests could mitigate the transmission
(infection rate 54.9% [95% BCI: 54.0% - 55.9%]). While physical distancing (reducing 60% of
out-of-household contacts) could only mitigate the transmission in slums (infection rate =
64.0%), applying case ﬁnding and contact tracing using antigen RDT and limited PCR tests
could further reduce the infection rate to 32.6%.

The distributions of infection rates show substantial uncertainty for rural areas and for non-slum
urban areas when physical distancing is in place. (Figure 4A, Supplementary Table 2) To account
for the uncertainty, we deﬁned the stochastic extinction events as the trajectories that infected
less than 5% of the population. Under the three settings considered, the probability of stochastic
extinction increases when testing, isolation and quarantine are implemented. When physical
distancing and case ﬁnding using antigen RDT are implemented under the rural setting, 80% of
the simulated trajectories would lead to an stochastic extinction event, while stochastic

extinctions happened in 25% of the trajectories when no NPI is imposed. Under the non-slum
urban setting, the stochastic extinction events happened in 44.5% of the trajectories when
physical distancing and type 3 combined strategy are implemented, which is a much larger
proportion compared to 4% when no NPI is implemented. For the slum setting, physical
distancing (reducing 60% of out-of-household contacts) increases stochastic extinction rate
slightly from 2% to 5%. When physical distancing is supplemented with type 3 strategy, the
stochastic extinction probability increases to 13.5%.

The impact of RDT sensitivity, tracing and assumed parameters
The most eﬀective containing strategy identiﬁed above involves antigen RDT whose sensitivity
varies across studies. (Pilarowski et al., 2020; Scohy et al., 2020) When testing strategy involves
antigen RDT, our simulations show that the containment eﬀect increases as the RDT sensitivity
increases. (Figure 4B) To reach a similar containment eﬀect as in Figure 4A, which assumes an
antigen RDT sensitivity of 56% (70% sampling success rate and 80% kit sensitivity), the kits
deployed should have a sensitivity above 40%.

For the role of contact tracing, we found when the quarantine compliance rate increased from
30% to 100% under the type 3 strategy, the average infection rate reduced from 15.7% to 9.5% in
rural settings, from 53.2% to 36.5% in non-slum urban settings, and from 66.5% to 49.5% in
slum settings. (Figure 4C) Note only contacts that are of isolated infectors and successfully
traced are subject to the quarantine. With no close contact quarantine measures, the combination
strategies show no signiﬁcant eﬀect on reducing infection numbers (Supplementary Figure 3).
Moreover, we found that the number of infected individuals discovered by testing is less than
those discovered by contact tracing when the contact quarantine compliance rate is above 25%.
(Supplementary Figure 4A)

The impact of other testing parameters on the containment outcomes are summarised in
Supplementary table 3 using R2 and P-values. Among these parameters, strong correlation
between isolation consent rates and containing eﬀectiveness are observed for all strategies and

settings. Days from symptom onset to isolation, quarantine consent rate of contacts and tracing
success rate are correlated with containing eﬀectiveness in two urban settings, while less
impactful in the rural setting. Duration of close contact tracing is only eﬀective for type 2
strategy under all three settings, suggesting antibody RDT requires contact tracing through a
longer period to be eﬀective. Additionally, we found that starting testing and quarantine after
10% of the population are infected could protect 31% of the healthy population under a non-slum
urban setting and 21% of the healthy population under the slum setting (Supplementary Figure
4B).

Discussion
Our primary goal in this study is to identify optimal COVID-19 containment policies for LIMCs
where NPIs are critical due to their limited vaccine supply and hospital capacity. (Walker et al.,
2020) To capture demographic characteristics of LMICs, notably younger population, large
household sizes and large rural population, we designed our agent-based model from two
perspectives. Firstly, we constructed synthetic population and contact networks that incorporate
age proﬁles, household sizes and contact structures. Secondly, we conﬁgured three community
settings which have contacts of diﬀerent frequencies and distributions to study the transmission
and containment of COVID-19 in rural and urban populations. The transmission dynamics and
NPI eﬀectiveness varies largely across community settings which is consistent with observations
that outbreaks have very diﬀerent scales among LMICs. (Makoni, 2020; Nordling, 2020)
Therefore, containment strategies should be designed for speciﬁc settings: mild NPI in rural
regions where activities are mostly outdoor might provide a similar containment eﬀect as strict
NPI in urban areas where contacts happen outside households but indoors. Our model discovered
another level of variability where similar epidemic start points could result in completely
diﬀerent epidemic sizes. The distribution of epidemic sizes tends to follow a bimodal pattern
where new cases either infect the majority of the population or end up in stochastic extinctions.
This pattern is most manifest in rural settings where contacts are more clustered within
households or in urban settings with physical distancing.

Our results also suggested antigen RDT could be applied for containing the epidemic. Though
the containing power subjects to the test sensitivity and community scenario, our results
suggested high quality kits that have a sensitivity above 50% for the rural setting and above 40%
for urban settings will provide similar containment power shown in our simulation. However, the
detrimental eﬀect of false negative test results might negate the containment eﬀect, which
requires careful evaluation of the kit sensitivity in real-world settings. (Bock et al., 2017)
Therefore, we propose to supplement antigen RDT to PCR tests in the urban settings where PCR
tests are available. Other case ﬁnding methods including antibody RDT and symptom-based
diagnosis are eﬀective in rural settings or physically-distanced non-slum urban settings. Both
settings have relatively small numbers of out-of-household contacts, which allows case ﬁnding
and quarantine to slow down the spread. Note all the case ﬁndings are based on an optimistic
assumption of isolation consent rate (i.e. symptom-based = 20%, test-based = 90%), which
remains to be validated in real-world settings.

The eﬀectiveness of physical distancing varies across community settings: in the rural setting, a
moderate physical distancing alone could mitigate the transmission to an infection rate of lower
than 10%; in the non-slum urban setting, physical distancing is an essential supplement to testing
and tracing if we want to reduce the infection rate to below 10%; in the slum setting, physical
distancing is less eﬀective. In contrast, contact tracing is an essential component of containing
strategy in all community settings. More importantly, contact tracing could provide containing
power even when simulating a low quarantine consent rate of contacts (30%) and a short tracing
time (3 days). As many LMICs have ﬁeld healthcare professionals who could perform contact
tracing, (Shapiro et al., 2012) it would be a realistic and essential measure to contain the
outbreaks, especially that we have shown that testing alone without contact tracing is not
eﬀective.

There are some limitations in our study. Firstly, our simulated population is an approximation to
the communities in LMICs and is limited by the lack of empirical evidence from LMICs.
Therefore, a majority of the parameters are set heuristically rather than by empirical evidence.

Our simulation might be improved using detailed demographic data for LMICs, such as those
collected from the Oﬃce of National Statistics (ONS) in the UK. Secondly, like many simulation
studies, we had to choose our parameters from empirical studies that are not consistent with each
other. (Omori et al., 2020) This diﬃculty is most pronounced when we are setting the parameters
for age-dependent susceptibility and asymptomatic rate of the infected. Lastly, we scaled up our
model by replicating simulations on independent contact networks (200,000 individuals divided
into 200 populations of 1,000 individuals) due to the computation constraint of ﬁtting large
network models. Compared to simulations on larger networks, (Hinch et al., 2020) our strategy
could not capture preparedness triggered by cases from nearby communities or repeated
introduction of cases. A simulation framework that simulates large contact networks might

Figure 1: Schematic representation of methodology. A) For each parameter setting we simulated
20 synthetic populations and inferred the contact network with ERGM, using contact data over
age groups and household structure. At each simulation step, a contact network is sampled from
the ERGM, where we simulate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. B) We evaluated the eﬀect of
physical distancing by reducing the sampling probability of out-of-household contacts.
Detection, isolation, contact tracing and quarantine are also simulated using the contact
networks.

Figure 2: Properties of simulated outbreaks from the agent-based model. A) Example outbreak
in a network composed of 1000 individuals, simulated under the non-slum urban setting without
NPI. The left, middle and right panel show the distributions of infected individuals (red dots) on
day 20, day 30 and day 40 from the day that initial cases are imported. The network structure is
ﬁxed for visualization, while in simulation a diﬀerent contact network is sampled each day. B)
Comparison of the simulated contact number distribution with those computed from the cited
Uganda survey data. The simulated contact number distribution is computed by sampling 100
daily contact realizations from each of the 20 synthetic populations. C) Comparison of
generation time from simulation (red histogram) and that from (Ferretti et al., 2020) (blue dotted
curve). D) Comparison of simulated growth curves with cited data. The red curve with shade
shows the mean of daily new cases and its 95% conﬁdence interval for 15 days, computed from
200 simulated outbreak trajectories. The blue and green dashed curves show the growth curve for
the UK (by report date) and China (by onset date) before lockdown. Growth curves are scaled so
