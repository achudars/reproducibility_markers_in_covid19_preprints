ABSTRACT
Background
Mortality remains very high and unpredictable in COVID-19, with intense public protection strategies tailored
to preceived risk. Males are at greater risk of severe COVID-19 complications. Genomic studies are in process
to identify differences in host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods
Genomic structures were examined for the ACE2 gene that encodes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the
obligate receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Variants in 213,158 exomes/genomes were integrated with ACE2 protein
functional domains, and pathogenicity criteria from the American Society of Human Genetics and
Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology.
Results
483 variants were identified in the 19 exons of ACE2 on the X chromosome. All variants were rare, including
nine loss-of-function (potentially SARS-CoV-2 protective) alleles present only in female heterozygotes.
Unopposed variant alleles were more common in males (262/3596 [7.3%] nucleotides) than females (9/3596
[0.25%] nucleotides, p<0.0001). 37 missense variants substituted amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 interacting
regions or critical domains for transmembrane ACE2 expression. Four upstream open reading frames with 31
associated variants were identified. Excepting loss-of-function alleles, variants would not meet minimum
criteria for classification as ‘Likely Pathogenic/beneficial’ if differential frequencies emerged in patients with
COVID-19.
Conclusions
Males are more exposed to consequences from a single variant ACE2 allele. Common risk/beneficial alleles
are unlikely in regions subject to evolutionary constraint. ACE2 upstream open reading frames may have
implications for aminoglycoside use in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

For this SARS-CoV-2-interacting

protein with pre-identified functional domains, pre-emptive functional and computational studies are
encouraged to accelerate interpretations of genomic variation for personalised and public health use.

INTRODUCTION
The human population is currently undergoing natural selection for genomic variants that were not deleterious
prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. COVID-19 infection can result in mild sequelae, but life-threatening
disease phenotypes are common [1-7]. Despite intensive public health measures, by June 2020 the disease had
claimed more than 380,000 lives [8].

The spectrum of COVID-19 disease severity strongly points towards differences in host genetic susceptibility,
and genomic studies are pending [9]. An understanding of who may be more, or less, at risk from SARS-CoV2 is important for public and personalised health strategies. The most obvious initial questions regard males,
with Italian [4] and UK [5] intensive care units reporting striking male excesses in >10,000 admissions, and
males displaying more severe biomarkers at all ages [6].

SARS-CoV-2 has an obligate host receptor, transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [1],
providing opportunities to examine potential genetic risk. ACE2 is a single membrane-spanning protein with a
complex, hinge-bending extracellular structure [10], and normally catalyses the degradation of angiotensin II
[11]. Angiotensin II degradation is a crucial regulatory step which has multiple and essential cardio-protective
consequences through modification of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) [11]. Recently, the
crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 virus interacting with ACE2 was solved to 2.5-Å resolution [12]. The viral
Spike (S) envelope protein embeds into the surface of the human host cell, and is cleaved to subunits S1 and S2
(‘primed’) by TMPRSS2, augmented by cathepsin B/ L [13]. This process enables S1 to participate in receptor
recognition, and S2 in membrane fusion. As detailed by Wang and colleagues, the S1 C-terminal domain (CTD)
interacts with a single membrane-bound molecule of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), resulting
in internalisation of the complex by the cell [12]. The viral-receptor engagement was shown to be dominated
by a series of strong polar contacts formed between specific viral and ACE2 amino acids, resulting in a solid
network of hydrogen-bond and salt bridge interactions at the interface [12].

With these insights, it becomes feasible to begin to address differing host genotypic susceptibility to SARSCoV-2. The study goals were to define human genetic variation in ACE2, and consider in the context of the
rigorous, structured approaches recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and
the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) [14].

METHODS
ACE2 Reference Sequence
The reference sequence for the human 3596 nucleotide transcript encoding ACE2 (NM_021804, 19-Apr-2020
update), was downloaded from RefSeq [15] and cross mapped to the National Center for Biotechnology
Information Genome Reference Consortium Human Builds GRCh37/hg19 [16] and GRCh38/hg38 [17],
utilising University of Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser resources [18,19]. Exon 1 and 2 sequences 5’ to
the methionine start codon were translated using ExPASY Translate [20].

Definition of ACE2 nucleotides relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Amino acids participating in hydrogen bonding with SARS-CoV-2 [13], and immediately adjacent residues,
were mapped to the primary amino acid and nucleotide sequences of NM_021804. These, and the NM_021804
annotations for nucleotides encoding the transmembrane domain and protease cleavage sites of ACE2 (limited
circulating enzyme is released following cleavage of transmembrane ACE2), were mapped to the two human
genome builds in current use, GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38.

Assessment of ACE2 human variation
Variants in all ACE2 exons and flanking intronic regions identified by versions 2 and 3 of the Genome
Aggregation Consortium (gnomAD) were downloaded. These 213,158 exomes and genomes from largely nonoverlapping 111,454 male and 101,704 female datasets [21], mapped to GRCh37/hg19 [16] (version 2, 141,456
samples), and GRCh37/hg19 [17] (version 3, 71,702 genomes) [21]. Denoted ACE2 variants were supplemented

using genomic coordinates to retrieve additional variants in the untranslated nucleotides of exons 1 and 19. All
variants were used to align human genome builds GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38 across the ACE2 locus.

ACE2 Variant Interpretation
The ACMG/AMP Standards and Guidelines [14] describe a structured approach to DNA variants, integrating
evidence in favour or against a functional consequence/pathogenicity. Multiple separate criteria are evaluated
for a particular gene variant based on allele frequency, molecular/protein functional predictions, patient
phenotypic information, segregation studies in families, and other data from reputable sources [14]. For
Pathogenicity (P) there are categories of very strong [PVS]; strong [PS]; moderate [PM] and supporting [PP]
criteria of evidence. Separate categories of evidence support Benign (B) status, with standalone [BA], strong
[BS] and supporting [BP] criteria for the absence of impact on the function or phenotype under study [14].
Criteria met by the variant are evaluated against rules defining minimum requirements to meet ‘Pathogenic’,
‘Likely Pathogenic’, ‘Likely Benign’ or ‘Benign’ status. Any variant not meeting or exceeding the minimum
requirements for a ‘Likely’ designation is classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS), and considered
non-actionable for clinical care [14].

For COVID 19, variant alleles increasing expression of transmembrane ACE2 protein, or otherwise enhancing
capacity to internalise SARS-Co-V into the host cell, may enhance risk. Conversely, loss-of-function variants
predict lower COVID 19 risk. Variants with no functional impact would be considered as a VUS or Likely
Benign with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection. For the current study, variants were defined as meeting the
ACMG/AMP criterion PVS1 for pathogenic/functional impact (in terms of a COVID resistant state) if they
clearly resulted in loss-of-function (null) alleles [14]. Missense variants resulting in amino acid substitutions
were evaluated particularly with respect to SARS-CoV-2 receptor status [12, 22].

Data Analysis
Aligned data were uploaded to STATA IC 15.1 (Statacorp, Texas, US) in order to generate descriptive statistics,
perform two way comparisons using χ2 and Mann Whitney tests, and generate graphs.

RESULTS:
ACE2 structure
The human ACE2 gene comprises 19 exons which span 41.9kb of the X chromosome (Figure 1). The 24 key
amino acids for viral-receptor engagement [12] are encoded by nucleotides in ACE2 exons 2, 3, 9 and 10. The
stalk cleavage site recognised by ADAM-17, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain protein, is encoded by
exon 16. The stalk cleavage site recognised by transmembrane protease, serine 2 TMPRSS2 (which also cleaves
the viral Spike protein to subunits S1 and S2 [13]) and by transmembrane protease, serine 11D, is encoded by
exons 17 and 18 (Figure 1).

Coding DNA variants in ACE2
3596 transcribed nucleotides are spliced to form the ACE2 messenger (m)RNA. In these and flanking splice
site nucleotides, 483 variants were identified in gnomAD [21], with 305 (63.1%) present in only one of the two
datasets. The variants were distributed across the ACE2 gene, and as shown in Figure 2, more than 90% were
very rare, affecting fewer than 0.01% of the population. The twelve most common variants are annotated in
Figure 2. Six of these resulted in amino acid substitutions, four were synonymous variants where the nucleotide
sequence still encoded the original amino acid, and two were in the 3’ untranslated region of exon 19.

Males are more likely to have an unopposed variant of ACE2
The implications of variant alleles differ for males with their single X chromosome, and single copy of ACE2,
compared to females with two. Across the 19 exons of ACE2, only 9/3596 (0.25%) nucleotides were
homozygous variant in at least one female (Figure 3A) compared to 262/3596 (7.3%) present in a hemizygous
state in at least one male with their single X-chromosome (Figure 3B, χ2 p<0.0001).

ACE2 exhibits few coding variants that generate an ACE2 loss-of-function allele
For ACE2, gnomAD version 2 and 3 databases included one whole gene duplication. There were 9 clear lossof-function variant alleles that would prevent any production of ACE2 protein/SARS-CoV-2 receptor. No full

or multi-exon deletions were identified, but several frameshift insertions/deletions resulted in transcript
ablation, and other loss-of-function variants resulted from start codon loss, stop codon gains, or disruption of
2 splice site consensus sequences (Table 1, Figure 1).

The loss-of-function variants were only found in the heterozygous state in females who had a second, normal
(“wild-type”) allele on their other X chromosome.

ACE2 exhibits few coding variants substituting amino acids that hydrogen bond with SARS-CoV-2
The ACE2 peptide sequence comprises 805 amino acids, 24 of which participate in hydrogen bonding with
SARS-CoV-2 [12]. The gnomAD databases indicated that 7 of the 24 SARS-Co-V-interacting amino acids are
substituted by other amino acids in members of the human race, and a further 8 substitutions affect the
immediate flanking amino acids (Table 1, Figure 1). The individual frequencies of these variant alleles ranged
from fewer than 1 in 100,000 to 0.4% (1 in 250) of the gnomAD populations. The most common variant, ACE2
c.77A>G, p.(Lys26Arg)/K26R, substitutes the residue immediately preceding the SARS-CoV-2-bonding Thr27
and Phe28.

Across the 213,158 datasets in gnomAD versions 2 and 3, two females (0.002%) were homozygous for
c.77A>G, p.(Lys26Arg)/K26R, and 429 males (0.39%) had a single unopposed copy of one of eight variants
listed in Table 1.

ACE2 exhibits few variants substituting amino acids involved in maintenance of the transmembrane state
Thirty-one amino acids are in the ACE2 stalk cleavage site or transmembrane domain (Figure 1). Three
missense variants were identified in nucleotides that encode the ADAM17 cleavage site (Table 1, Figure 1), all
with population allele frequencies < 0.0046%. Thirteen missense variants were identified in nucleotides that
encode the TMPR cleavage site (Table 1, Figure 1). For these, respective allele frequencies were < 0.026%.
Similarly for the transmembrane domain, the 6 identified missense variants (Table 1, Figure 1) had a maximal
allele frequency <0.011%.

For these 22 variants, in the 213,158 gnomAD datasets, no female was homozygous for any substitution. 58
males (0.05%) had a single unopposed copy of at least one variant (Table 1).

Upstream open reading frames in the ACE2 gene
The regions in ACE2 exons 1 and 2 that are 5’ to the transcriptional start site are illustrated in Figure 4. On
ExPASy translation, the first exon and the 5’ region of the second exon contained 4 non-overlapping upstream
open reading frames (uORFs). The first uORF is in-frame with the main transcript, the second, third and fourth
are in the +1 reading frame. As indicated in Figure 4, 12 variants were in the three of the uORFs, a further 7
variants in the uORFs 5’untranslated regions (UTRs), and 14 in the second exon 5’ UTR for the main transcript.
All were rare, with individual allele frequencies <0.028%.

No variant was present in a homozygous state in females. In total, 46 males (0.041%) were hemizgous for a
variant in exon 1 (rs1049986543, rs954681758, rs934738609, rs1432973822, rs867425621), or in the
untranslated regions of exon 2 (rs981244191, rs1452729298, rs370596467, rs762634913, rs1388994308,
rs1455256395).

ACMG/AHP Classification Considerations
The 9 loss-of-function alleles met the ACMG PVS1 criterion in support of “pathogenicity”, noting this would
be for the beneficial state of resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection, since each would prevent any ACE2/SARSCoV-2 receptor production. The 15 variant alleles for amino acids adjacent and directly interacting with SARSCoV-2, and 22 variant alleles affecting amino acids in the transmembrane domain, or membrane-proximal
cleavage sites, could meet the ACMG/AHP moderate criterion of PM1 in terms of COVID-19, on the basis of
affecting a critical domain. In this setting, variants that impaired ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 interaction, prevented
ACE2 membrane anchoring, or augmented ACE2 cleavage would be predicted to enhance resistance to SARS8

CoV-2 infection, while those that increased ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 interactions, or impeded cleavage of ACE2
would be predicted to enhance susceptibility.

Meeting a single criterion does not meet the minimum requirements for ‘Likely Pathogenic’ [or beneficial] by
ACMG/AMP guidance [14]. For the 9 loss-of-function alleles meeting PVS1, at least one further criterion of
strong or moderate evidence is required. For the 37 missense variants meeting PM1 due to presence in key
functional domains, a ‘Likely Pathogenic’ assignment would require at least two further moderate criteria, or a
combination with up to 4 supporting criteria, only one of which can reflect differential allele frequency in
disease and non-disease cohorts [14].

DISCUSSION

We have shown that the ACE2 gene on the X-chromosome provides a biological rationale why males and
females have different risk profiles for COVID-19 infection. Within coding nucleotides, identified variants
were rare, with complete loss-of-function (putative SARS-CoV-2-protective) alleles only observed in the
heterozygous state in females, and unopposed variants present more commonly in males. The first and second
exon upstream open reading frames were identified as a source of ACE2 regulation and variation relevant for
patients treated with aminoglycoside antibiotics. Excepting very rare loss-of-function alleles, different patterns
of allele frequencies captured in very large COVID-19 sequencing initiatives will be unlikely to meet minimum
ACMG/AMP criteria for pathogenicity without further functional data.

The current manuscript utilised gnomAD databases due to their broad population coverage. It is widely
considered that variant databases are already saturated for common alleles, although further rare variants are
expected to emerge, particularly from previously under-represented populations [23]. Thus, although a

limitation of the current study is that not every human genomic database was examined, a wider number of
coding ACE2 variants were retrieved compared to other publications [24], most likely due to combined use of
both the GRCh37/hg19-mapping and more recent GRCh37/hg19-mapping gnomAD databases. The study by
design was limited to ACE2, in order to illustrate principles, but could be expanded to additional potential
regions of genomic risk.

Study strengths include highlighting the landscape of genetic variation relevant to SARS-CoV-2, and
questioning how strictly putative COVID-19 risk and protective alleles should be defined, particularly if they
may become part of public health policies, as for underlying health conditions [25,26]. The pattern from
Mendelian disorders was of over-exuberant pathogenicity calls in early research reports, with pathogenicity
classifications of many variants later downgraded as assignments became increasingly stringent [14,28]. As a
result, high proportion of coding variants in known disease-causing genes are currently clinically non-actionable
due to classification as a VUS. This is important because many individuals are “pre-genotyped,” having
undergone whole genome sequencing as part of other initiatives [29-31], and will have direct access to opensource research publication of COVID-19 associated variants, before they are subjected to the rigorous
oversights applied by Clinical Geneticists.

To facilitate classification if variants are found to be associated with greater or lesser SARS-CoV-2
infection/consequences than expected by chance, in vitro modelling of infection rates in ACE2 heterozygous
cells would provide evidence towards one of the ACMG/AHP functional studies criteria (PS3). Computational
modelling for the small number of specific missense variants at amino acids directly interacting with SARSCo-V has commenced, and may also meet the ACMG/AMP strong criterion of evidence (PS3): Hussain and
colleagues demonstrated that two SARS-Co-V interactions of ACE lysine 353 are predicted to be absent if the
apparently ‘distant’ serine 19 is substituted by proline (S19P) [22]. Modelling docking poses of SARS-Co-V2 suggested intermolecular contacts were also fewer than predicted for E329G, and inter-residual interaction
maps indicated that SARS-Co-V interaction with ACE Q42 was absent in E35D, E37K, M82I, and E329G.
Additionally, a significant change in the estimated free energy of ACE2 for S19P and K26R implied these may

adversely affect protein stability compared to wildtype.[22] Thus PM1 and PP3 (in terms of “pathogenicity” for
a COVID-resistant state) would be met for six variants including ACE2 c.77A>G, p.Lys26Arg, the second most
common ACE2 missense substitution in the human population (Figure 2).

Overall, the paucity of loss-of-function alleles in this X-chromosome gene points towards strong evolutionary
constraint based on the normal role of ACE2 as a critical homeostatic mediator through the renin angiotensin
system [11]. The similarly low allele frequencies for missense substitutions in the SARS-Co-V binding region
and stalk cleavage sites suggest these too have been under evolutionary constraint, potentially for the same
homeostatic role. In males, the wider consequences of an unopposed loss-of-function allele in this essential
transmembrane carboxypeptidase are not yet known, but notably no such males were in the gnomAD datasets.
The rare female heterozygotes with a single loss-of-function ACE2 allele will be protected from total protein
absence due to Lyonisation when one female X chromosome is randomly inactivated in each cell [32,33], and
may benefit from relative protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Males are therefore more likely to have unopposed risk alleles, but females more likely to benefit from
protective alleles better tolerated in the heterozygous state. The rarity of variants in ACE2 exons indicate that if
common resistance or susceptibility alleles to SARS-Co-V emerge, they are unlikely to be found in the ACE2
coding regions.

Currently the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project identifies 2,053 expression

quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for ACE2 based on mapping windows 1Mb up and downstream of the
transcription start site [34]. While these loci will likely harbour SARS-CoV-2 genomic susceptibility and
resistance alleles, and some are very common, with minor allele frequencies approaching 0.5, the significant
linkage disequilibrium implies that selecting individual loci for functional evaluations may be challenging [35].

For immediate clinical considerations, regulation of the ACE2 uORFs is suggested as a focus for functional
assays in the presence and absence of relevant variants. This is because aminoglycoside antibiotics (such as
gentamicin, amikacin, neomycin, tobramycin and kanamycin that are used to treat patients including those with
COVID-19) are used in vitro to manipulate uORFs via ribosomal read-through of termination codons [36]. In

general, uORFs are known to be able to stimulate or inhibit translation of main ORFs [37]. In vitro studies
would provide evidence whether aminoglycosides have no effect, increase or decrease ACE2 transcription and
thus whether no effect, beneficial or deleterious effects on disease progression would be predicted.

In conclusion, given the obligate host receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is located on the X chromosome, genetic
considerations supported by population-based genotyping further emphasise the importance of increasing
targeted and personalised care to males, and highlight priority regions of the human genome for interrogation.
These focus not only on ACE2 amino acids interacting with SARS-CoV-2 and in critical sites that maintain
ACE2 in its transmembrane form, but also the upstream reading frames where read-through may be modified
by antibiotic treatments used in SARS-CoV-2- infected individuals. Given the large number of COVID-19 host
genomics initiatives, differential allele frequencies will probably emerge before variants meet ACMG/AMP
criteria for actionable results in patients. Pre-emptive functional studies, and ACMG/AMP-structured
approaches to research-based presentation of COVID-19 susceptibility variant results are encouraged.

Figure 1: ACE2 and key variants

The 19 exons of the main transcript of ACE2 (NM_021804), sited on the X chromosome, and drawn as boxes to scale, with stylised untranslated regions
(pale green), intervening introns and splicing events. Black numbers indicate exon first nucleotides, with the ATG start codon and TGA natural stop codon
highlighted. Blue text indicates nucleotides encoding the signal peptide (SP), asparagines that are N-glycosylated (G), the transmembrane domain (TM), and
two essential regions for cleavage by ADAM-17, and by transmembrane proteases, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and serine 11D (TMPRSS11D). Below the exons,
amino acids (αα) numbered in blue refer to host ACE2 domains, with amino acids that hydrogen (H)-bond with the SARS-CoV-2 virus Spike protein CTD
listed vertically, with precise position indicated at the point of the adjacent diamond. Above the exons, variants most likely to change COVID-19 susceptibility
are described by coding nucleotide number (c. from methionine start i.e. +307 compared to exon 1 nucleotide 1), consequence (p. protein sequence; *, stop
gain; fs, frameshift), and rs designation if available. Text is coloured as follows: Brown, loss of function alleles (start loss, stop gain, frameshift, and splice
consensus variants); red, variants replacing amino acid residues directly hydrogen-bonding with SARS-CoV-2; purple, variants replacing an amino acid
adjacent to a SARS-CoV-2 hydrogen bonding amino acid; green, variants affecting the cleavage sites, and black, variants affecting the transmembrane
domain. Variants are also presented in Table 1.

Figure 2: Allele frequencies of ACE2 exonic variants.

The allele frequency of all variants, grouped by exon and plotted on a logarithmic scale. Individual mean allele
frequencies were calculated for variants present in more than one database, before calculation of median
frequency of all variant alleles in each exon. Corresponding percentage frequencies are indicated on the right,
anchored by key individual and median allele frequencies. Box plots indicate median number and interquartile
range, error bars 95th percentiles, and dots are outliers. For the most common variants, yellow squares indicate
synonymous variants where the nucleotide changes would not result in amino acid substitutions, and blue, noncoding variants in the 3’ untranslated region in exon 19. On the y axis, 2.7 represents e, the base of the natural
logarithm that approximates to 2.71828.

Figure 3: Number of individuals without a normal ACE2 sequence.

A) The number of females homozygous for (i.e. having two copies of) an ACE2 variant, plotted by the exon in
which the nucleotide(s) are sited. B) The number of males hemizygous for ACE2 variants (i.e. having their only
copy of the ACE2 sequence a variant) plotted by the exon in which the relevant nucleotide(s) are sited. Note the
difference in y-axis scales between A) and B), similar patterns of distribution (reflecting overall variant allele
frequency in the population, data not shown), and that most variation occurs in exons 17 and 18.

Figure 4: Variants in the 5’ “untranslated” region of ACE2.

ACE2 exon 1 and the start of exon 2 with upstream open reading frames (ORFs) to scale, stylised intervening intron/splicing event, and variants approximately
positioned. Note that compared to Figure 1, the 5’ “untranslated” region has been deconstructed into open reading frames and 5’/intervening untranslated
regions. Grey indicates the in-frame ORF, with variants listed in grey text. Lilac indicates alternate reading frame ORFs with variants listed in purple text.
Pale green indicates the intervening untranslated regions, with the relevant variants listed in green text.
