Abstract
Since March 31st, 2020, during the height of the pandemic, we have decontaminated

26

thousands of 3M 1860 respirators with Ultraviolet C (UVC) for our frontline workers. There is

27

no published peer-reviewed data regarding the dose required to effectively disinfect SARS-CoV-

28

2 on N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Four different locations (facepiece and strap) on

29

5 different N95 FFR models (3M 1860, 8210, 8511, 9211; Moldex 1511) were inoculated with a

30

10 μL drop of SARS-CoV-2 viral stock (8 x 107 TCID50/mL). The outside-facing and wearer-

31

facing surfaces of the respirators were each irradiated with a dose of 1.5 J/cm2 UVC (254 nm).

32

Viable SARS-CoV-2 was quantified by a median tissue culture infectious dose assay (TCID50).

33

UVC delivered using a dose of 1.5 J/cm2, to each side, was an effective method of

34

decontamination for the facepieces of 3M 1860 and Moldex 1511, and for the straps of 3M 8210

35

and the Moldex 1511. This dose is an appropriate decontamination method to facilitate reuse of

36

respirators for healthcare personnel when applied to certain models/materials. Increasing the

37

dose may improve decontamination for the other models and straps; however, UVC radiation can

38

degrade certain polymers in a dose dependent manner, and the effects may vary greatly between

39

different models. Therefore, fit-testing of UVC decontaminated respirators must be performed

40

each time a new model and/or dose is introduced into the healthcare system.

Introduction
The shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) is affecting healthcare workers

49

worldwide during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The ability to

50

decontaminate and reuse N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) is a partial solution to the

51

current shortage.(1) We recently proposed decontaminating respirators with repurposed

52

dermatology office phototherapy devices, which serve as a platform for ultraviolet C (UVC)

53

germicidal disinfection.(2) On March 31st, during the height of the pandemic, Henry Ford Health

54

System (HFHS) began decontaminating 3M 1860 respirators with UVC and returning them to

55

their original users. Since then, several thousand respirators have been decontaminated.

56

Previous studies have shown that UVC can inactivate other coronaviruses including

57

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory

58

Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).(3, 4) However, there is no peer-reviewed published data

59

showing the effective disinfection of the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 by UVC,

60

on intact N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Consequently, this was causing significant

61

anxiety in our frontline workers using decontaminated PPE.

62

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of UVC on decontamination of

63

SARS-CoV-2-innoculated N95 respirators using a variety of FFRs that are available to

64

healthcare employees at Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) in Detroit, MI.

65

Methods

66

The study was performed as a collaboration between the HFHS and the University of

67

Michigan. All study procedures were approved and conducted according to the University of

68

Michigan Institutional Biosafety Committee BSL3 (Biosafety Level 3). The appropriate training

69

and medical surveillance for experimental procedures and manipulations performed in the BSL3

Virus and Preparation of Viral Stocks

73

The SARS-CoV-2 strain used was USA-WA1/2020 NR-52281. Viral stocks of SARS-

74

COV-2 were obtained from the Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources

75

Repository and were propagated in Vero-E6 cells grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium

76

(DMEM) without phenol red, with 2% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), L-glutamine,

77

penicillin/streptomycin, non-essential amino acids, and hydroxyethyl piperazineethanesulfonic

78

acid (HEPES). The virus stock was purposely produced in a phenol red-free medium to avoid

79

photodegradation or photooxidation that may affect the results. For stock virus titration, aliquots

80

of viral stock were applied on confluent Vero-E6 cells in 96-well plates for a 50% tissue culture

81

infectious dose (TCID50) assay. Viral stocks were determined to be 8 x 107 TCID50/mL.

82

Test respirators and UVGI device

83

Respirators were tested 100% intact and included the following models: 3M 1860 (St.

84

Paul, MN); 3M 8210 (St. Paul, MN); Moldex 1511 (Culver City, CA); 3M 8511 (St. Paul, MN);

85

and 3M 9211(St. Paul, MN).The low-pressure mercury lamp ultraviolet germicidal irradiation

86

device (UVGI) (254 nm, 1 series) was manufactured by Daavlin (Byron, OH), with custom

87

dimensions (22 in. x 10 in. x 8 in) to fit under the BSL3 biosafety hood. The irradiance of the

88

device was approximately 16.5 mW/cm2 at a distance of 11.5 cm from the lamps (approximately

89

at the apex of the N95 respirator). The UVGI device used 4 lamps, spaced 4.5 cm apart. In

90

comparison, the devices used by HFHS to decontaminate respirators for healthcare personnel had

91

an irradiance of approximately 10 mW/ cm2 at a distance of 11.5 cm from the lamps. This UVGI

92

device had 10 lamps, spaced 11 cm apart. Despite the differences, the units are similar in

93

performance. Prior to initiating the experiment, the irradiance of the device was measured, and a

94

built-in dosimeter was calibrated to adjust the irradiation.

95

Decontamination studies

96

Intact FFRs in a donned position were inoculated on the outside-facing surface with a

97

single 10 μL drop of viral stock (8 x 107 TCID50/mL) on 4 areas to account for differing received

98

doses on complex surfaces: nosepiece, apex, chin-piece, and strap (Figure 1A). Inoculated

99

respirators were dried in a biosafety cabinet at room temperature for 40 minutes. For each N95

100

respirator model, FFRs were UVC-irradiated or left untreated as positive controls for viral load

101

recovery. The respirators were then placed under the UVGI device, in the center, and were

102

individually treated with a dose of 1.5 J/cm2. Then, they were rotated and the wearer-facing side

103

of the N95 was again irradiated with 1.5 J/cm2. The irradiation time for each side was

104

approximately 60-70 seconds. The device does not generate any heat; as such, all FFRs were

105

exposed to UVC at room temperature. Immediately after the completion of the irradiation, 4 mm

106

circles containing the inoculated surface were obtained with a leather belt eyelet hole punch tool

107

and were placed in 300 μL (microliters) of PBS for 1 hour at room temperature.

108

Recovered viral loads were determined by TCID50 assay of the absorbed samples.

109

Briefly, 25 μL aliquots of serially 10-fold diluted samples were inoculated into 96-well plates

110

with a Vero-E6 cell monolayer in sextuplicate and cultured in DMEM with 2% FBS, L-

111

glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, non-essential amino acids, and HEPES. The plates were

112

observed for cytopathic effects for 4 days. Viral titer was calculated with the Reed and Müench

113

endpoint method.(5) Viral yields were expressed as total TCID50 recovered in 300 μL or TCID50/

114

4mm punch. TCID50 negative controls were cells with media only and were included on each

115

plate assayed. All negative controls had no cytopathic effect (CPE). The limit of detection (LOD)

116

for the TCID50 assay was determined to be 101.3 TCID50 / 4 mm punch. If the amount of viral

117

particles was below the LOD, then a theoretical, yet low content of viruses may be present.(6)

118

However, an absence of CPE in the Vero E6 cells at 4 days post inoculation indicates a loss of

119

infectivity and is evidence of inactivation of the SARS‐CoV-2 samples (Figure 1B).(6) We

120

considered effective decontamination to be results below the LOD with no CPE, the elimination

121

of all infectious SARS-CoV-2.

122

Results

123

Following preliminary testing (Appendix Figure 1, Appendix Table 1), virus

124

inoculation was performed on all 5 types of respirators. For each type, three were irradiated with

125

UVC, and one was not irradiated to serve as positive control. Similar results were seen for the

126

3M 1860 respirators as in the preliminary study. All facepiece locations were below the LOD

127

with absent CPE. Two straps were above the LOD, and one strap was below the LOD with

128

absent CPE. Sufficient virus (≤ 1 log reduction) was recovered from the untreated positive

129

controls on all facepiece locations; however, a lower yield was recovered from the untreated

130

control strap (Figure 2, Appendix Table 2).

131

On the 3M 8210 respirators, location 1 had two respirators above the LOD, and one

132

respirator below the LOD with absent CPE. Location 2 had one FFR at the LOD, and two FFRs

133

below the LOD with absent CPE. Location 3 and all the straps were below the LOD with absent

134

CPE. Lower virus yields were recovered from the untreated positive control on all facepiece

135

locations. In contrast, the strap did not absorb the droplet and a sufficient yield was obtained.

136

(Figure 2, Appendix Table 2). Of note, the amount of virus recovered from the strap on the

137

untreated positive control was higher than the untreated control virus stock (10 μL in PBS

138

control). This could have been due to a loss of viral titer of the stock as the control sat in PBS

139

solution for an hour during the experiment.

140

On the Moldex 1511, all facepiece locations and straps were below the LOD with absent

141

CPE. However, there was a lower virus recovery from certain facepiece locations (1 and 3) on

142

the untreated positive respirator (Figure 2, Appendix Table 2).

143

For the 3M 8511 and 3M 9211, locations 1 and 2 had FFRs all below the LOD with

144

absent CPE. Location 3 had one FFR at the LOD, and two respirators below the LOD with

145

absent CPE. All the straps were above the LOD. All facepiece locations and the strap on the

146

untreated control had lower virus recovery as compared to the 10 μL in PBS control (Figure 2,

147

Appendix Table 2).

148

Discussion

149

Five N95 respirator models were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and tested. UVC

150

delivered using a dose of 1.5 J/cm2, to each side, was an effective method of decontamination for

151

the facepieces of 3M 1860 and Moldex 1511, and for the straps of 3M 8210 and the Moldex

152

1511. This is consistent with previous results using H1N1 influenza demonstrating that UVC

153

decontamination is dependent on model and material type. Mills et al(7) and Heimbuch et al(4)

154

reported 1 J/cm2 dose may not be adequate to kill H1N1 influenza depending on the N95

155

respirator used. Mills et al found that only facepieces on 12 of 15 models and straps on 7 of 15

156

models showed a significant (≥ 3 log) reduction of H1N1 influenza viability. Similarly,

157

Heimbuch et al found that only facepieces on 11 of 15 models and straps on 4 of 15 models

158

showed a significant (≥ 3 log) reduction of H1N1 influenza viability.(8)

159
160

Some respirator models have materials, such as the straps of the 3M 1860, that
demonstrate hydrophilic characteristics when inoculated. Moreover, these seemingly hydrophilic

161

surfaces showed consistently lower mean log reduction < 3 log10 TCID50.(4) In contrast,

162

seemingly hydrophobic materials, such as the 3M 1860 facepiece, were found to demonstrate a >

163

3 log10 TCID50 reduction.(4) In our study using SARS-CoV-2, we observed similar results with

164

the 3M 1860 facepiece and strap. Further, the facepieces of the 3M 8210 have hydrophilic

165

properties which were reflected in the reduced decontamination results, while the straps did not

166

readily absorb the droplets, and hence were adequately disinfected. The Moldex 1511 facepiece

167

and straps also appeared to be hydrophobic and did not absorb the droplets.

168

Some straps are prone to twisting. Consequently, when the respirator is flipped during

169

the irradiation process, care must be taken to make sure the appropriate surface of the strap is

170

exposed to UVC. Also, straps should not inadvertently lay on top of the respirator, hence

171

creating a shadowing effect. Reduced decontamination seen amongst the straps may not only be

172

a result of material but secondary to receiving a reduced dosage. UVC devices which provide

173

360 degrees of irradiation may obviate this issue. Possible respirator-based solutions include a

174

secondary disinfection step (e.g. Environmental Protection Agency recommended cleansers)

175

applied only to the straps. Further, ancillary disinfection testing was performed on the 3M 1860

176

straps using over-the-counter 70% isopropyl alcohol prep pads (TopCare, Elk Grove Village,

177

IL). The straps were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and wiped three times with the alcohol pad.

178

Results of the study showed that regardless of UVC irradiation, alcohol alone was sufficient to

179

decontaminate the 3M 1860 straps (Appendix Figure 2, Appendix Table 3). Additionally,

180

manufacturers may consider using, for example, the same material as the straps of the 3M 8210

181

for all the other models of FFRs to improve UVC decontamination.

182

Our dosage for this study was partially based on previous work with Influenza A (H1N1),

184

A/Shanghai/1/2013, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV,(4, 7-9) where it was determined that all areas

185

of a respirator should receive at least 1 J/cm2. Preliminary unpublished data from the

186

Photomedicine and Photobiology Unit at HFHS demonstrated through theoretical and measured

187

models that the curvature and the distance of the 3M 1860 N95 respirator from the light source

188

affected the dosage delivered in a predictable way. Moreover, extrapolating from this model,

189

after irradiating one side of the respirator with 1.5 J/cm2, some of the lateral aspects may only

190

receive 900 mJ/cm2 while the apex of the respirator may receive almost 3 J/cm2. Further, it was

191

also observed that a certain percentage of the dosage received in an area (~10%) permeates to the

192

other side (I. Kohli, unpub. data). Therefore, 1.5 J/cm2 was chosen as the lowest irradiance to

193

ensure that all areas received at least 1 J/cm2. Increasing the dosage delivered may improve

194

decontamination, but UVC radiation can degrade certain polymers in a dose dependent manner,

195

and the effects may vary greatly between different models.(10) Therefore, fit-testing of UVC

196

decontaminated respirators must be performed each time a new model and/or dose is introduced

197

into the healthcare system.(11)

198

Our study sampled different areas of each respirator to ensure that all ranges of dosages

199

were accounted for in a real-world setting against SARS-CoV-2. Other strengths included the

200

testing of different model types. Of note, the hydrophilic surfaces (e.g. 3M 8210 facepiece and

201

3M 1860 strap) of untreated positive controls demonstrated a lower virus recovery than control.

202

Additional testing was performed to determine if the droplet was drying larger than the 4 mm

203

area tested. The results showed that there was limited to no virus in the periphery of the 4 mm

204

area tested, and that no virus could be detected on the wearer-facing surface. Moreover, the

205

lower yield reflects a diminished ability to resuspend the virus after drying. Limitations of the

206

study include that no soiling agents were used. However, at Henry Ford Health System, as in

207

other healthcare facilities, personnel are instructed not to reuse respirators that are visibly soiled.

208

Further, it is still unclear what the infectious dose is for SARS-CoV-2; therefore, it is unknown if

209

a significant reduction in viral load eliminates contagious risk.

210

In conclusion, UVC at a dose of 1.5 J/cm2 applied to both sides is effective at

211

decontaminating SARS-CoV-2 on some N95 respirators. This dose may only be an appropriate

212

decontamination method to facilitate reuse of PPE for healthcare personnel when applied to

213

certain models/materials. In addition, some straps may require additional disinfection to

214

maximize the safety to the frontline workers. Implementation of widespread UVC

215

decontamination methods requires a careful consideration of model, material type, design, and

216

fit-testing following irradiation. It should also be emphasized that similar cautions should be

217

practiced for all other methods of respirator decontamination.
