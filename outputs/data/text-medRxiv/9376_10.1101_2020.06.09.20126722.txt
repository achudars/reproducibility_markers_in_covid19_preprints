ABSTRACT
Objective:

Measure the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, work-exhaustion, burnout, and

decreased well-being among faculty and staff at a university and academic medical center during the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and describe work-related and personal factors associated with mental health
and well-being.

Design:

Observational cohort study conducted between April 17 and May 1, 2020 using a web-based

questionnaire.

Setting:
Participants:
Exposures:

Medical and main campuses of a university.
All faculty, staff, and post-doctoral fellows.

Work factors including supervisor support and exposure to high-risk clinical settings;

personal factors including demographics and family/home stressors.

Main Outcomes and Measures:

Stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased

well-being.

Results:

There were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%). 38% of faculty and 14% of staff

(n=915) were providing clinical care, while 57% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home.
The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and work exhaustion were somewhat higher among clinicians
than non-clinicians. Among all workers, anxiety, depression, and high work exhaustion were
independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19 [Prevalence Ratios and
95% confidence intervals 1.37(1.09- 1.73), 1.28(1.03 - 1.59), and 1.24(1.13 - 1.36) respectively]. Poor
family supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes [1.40 (1.21 1.62), 1.69 (1.48 - 1.92), 1.54 (1.44 - 1.64)]. Age below 40 and a greater number of family/home
stressors were also associated with poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for
patients with COVID-19 and work in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors.

Conclusions and Implications:

Our findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on

mental health and well-being among both clinical and non-clinical employees. Prevention of exposure
to COVID-19 and increased supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental
health and well-being.

INTRODUCTION
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created unprecedented disruption in social interactions and working

conditions. Recent studies have described the effects of the pandemic on the mental health and well-

1,2

being of frontline healthcare workers (HCW),

3-5

and potential interventions to protect them.

Although concern over health and well-being has primarily focused on frontline HCW, the pandemic

has also affected working conditions in most other industries. Social and employment changes have

led to concern of an impending “second pandemic” of short and long term mental health issues,

7

predictions of a preventable surge of avoidable deaths from alcohol, drug use, and suicide.

6

and

Few data

describe the effects of the pandemic on mental health and well-being of workers outside of healthcare.

Such evidence is important for developing appropriate responses to the pandemic in order to preserve

health and plan for economic and social recovery.

Emp o W

We describe results from the EMPOWER study (

which measured mental health and well-being among a large and diverse academic workforce,

including those with and without clinical exposure to COVID-19 patients. The goals of the study were to

measure the prevalence of, stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased

mental well-being among faculty and staff at a university and its academic medical center during the

SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; to compare mental health and well-being between clinical workers who were

or were not caring for COVID-19 patients; and to identify other modifiable workplace and personal risk

factors associated with mental health and well-being.

METHODS
Study Design and Participants

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.09.20126722; this version posted June 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

We conducted a web-based survey of all benefits-eligible university employees (faculty, staff, and post-

doctoral scholars) at Washington University in St. Louis, a private university with a large academic

medical center where attending physicians and clinical staff are university employees. A separate

survey was sent to physician trainees (residents and clinical fellows) and is not included in this report.

An email invitation to participate was sent to all benefits-eligible employees on April 17, 2020, with a

clickable link to a voluntary, anonymous online survey. A single reminder email was sent ten days later.

The survey period spanned 4 -5 weeks after the university enacted work at home plans. The study was

approved by the institutional review board of Washington University in St. Louis.

Survey Instrument
The survey was designed to take less than 10 minutes to complete (Supplementary Materials).

Demographic questions included age, race, household income, children, dependents, and other adults

living at home, and work status of partner. Questions about work included current work status (onsite

work involving clinical care, onsite work not involving clinical care, working from home, or not

working). Those doing onsite work in clinical care were asked about clinical setting, and if they had

cared for patients with COVID-19. All participants were asked if they or a member of their household

had received a medical diagnosis or a positive test for COVID-19 or if they had been exposed to

someone with COVID-19.

The questionnaire also included three questions from the Family Supportive Supervisor Behavior Short-

8

Form (FSSB-SF),

which measures supervisor behaviors supportive of family roles (“Your supervisor

makes you feel comfortable talking to him/her about your conflicts between work and non-work; Your

supervisor demonstrates effective behaviors in how to juggle work and non-work issues; Your

supervisor works effectively with employees to creatively solve conflicts between work and non-

work.”) We used the mean value of these three responses as the supervisor support variable. We also

asked about 8 potential family/home stressors related to the pandemic (childcare, home schooling,

caring for elderly relatives, having access to food and other essential ies, being infected, friends and

family being infected, keeping your job, and personal finances). These questions were asked in the

format “Currently how stressed are you about…?” in a 5-point scale from “not at all” to “extremely”

stressed. The number of stressors reported by each individual as “somewhat” to “extremely” were

totaled to create a composite stress score (range 0-8).

Outcome Measures
9

Study outcomes included stress, anxiety, and depression as measured by the DASS-21,

10

work exhaustion as measured by the Professional Fulfillment Index (PFI),

burnout and

11

and changes in well-being.

The DASS-21 is a validated instrument with scales that correlate well with other measures of

depression, anxiety, and stress. Due to the PFI questionnaire structure, burnout was only assessed

among HCW. Self-reported changes in well-being comparing current to pre-pandemic status were

assessed in five domains (overall, financial, physical, mental, and social) by the question “To what

extent have COVID-19-related work/life changes impacted your well-being” using a four-point scale

from “much worse” to “much better/somewhat better. ”

Statistical Analyses
We contrasted the proportions or means of outcomes between faculty and staff and those in different

clinical settings, and conducted univariable and multivariable Poisson regression with robust sandwich

estimators to examine personal and work factors associated with six mental health and well-being

outcomes described above: stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, work exhaustion, and changes in well-

being.

In conducting these analyses, we selected a priori ten potential personal and work factors as

independent variables for multivariate analysis (supervisor support, clinical work, staff [vs. faculty or

post-doc], exposure to people [or patients for clinicians] with a diagnosis of COVID-19, age, sex, race,

annual household income, children under 18 years living at home, and composite stressor count).

Results were expressed as Prevalence Ratios (PR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Independent

variables were dichotomized at the median scores or at relevant cut-points for ordinal variables. We

categorized race and ethnicity as “under-represented groups” (those identifying as Black/African

American, Native American, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander or Hispanic) and as “other.” Significance level

was set at 0.05 and hypothesis tests were 2-sided. All analyses were performed with R statistical

and R studio version 1.2.504.

Patient and Public Involvement
The survey was developed in collaboration with the university human resources department and

employee wellness director to ensure sensitivity to current issues and to address emerging concerns

about employee wellness during the pandemic response. Initial survey results have been shared with

university leaders in order to highlight mental health needs of employees. Study results are driving

plans to communicate broadly with faculty, staff, and trainees to highlight mental health challenges

faced by our workforce and to better publicize and encourage employees to utilize available mental

health resources.

RESULTS
16,238 email invitations were sent to university faculty, staff, and post-doctoral scholars. 5706

responses were received (Figure 1); there were 5569 unique responses after the exclusion of 137

responses with duplicate self-generated identifier allowing anonymous longitudinal follow-up. 19

surveys were dropped for missing status as faculty, staff, or post-doctoral scholar, leaving 5550

respondents for analysis (870 faculty, 4470 staff, and 210 post-docs). Overall response rate was 34.3%

for unique surveys. Response rates were higher for staff than for faculty (40% vs. 19.7%)

Table 1 compares demographics, work factors, and outcomes between faculty, staff, and post-docs.

34.3% of faculty and 13.6% of staff reported working onsite in clinical operations while a majority of

the faculty (60.6%) and staff (76.5%) were working from home. Smaller numbers worked onsite in non-

clinical roles and few were not working. A majority of faculty (50.4%) reported that their workload

increased after the COVID-19 workplace changes, as compared to 40.4% of staff and 21% of post-docs.

Overall, a majority of respondents reported being stressed (more than “a little bit”) about personal

finances, keeping their jobs, and about themselves or friends or family being infected. Of those with

children at home, a majority reported feeling stressed about home schooling; most of those providing

care to elderly relatives reported stress about their care. Distributions of most perceived stressors

were significantly different across the faculty, staff, and post-doctoral fellows, with post-doctoral

fellows more frequently reporting stress about childcare, home schooling, and access to food and

essential supplies. Faculty, staff, and post-doctoral fellows all reported high prevalence of worsened

overall well-being (61.6%) related to COVID-19 work/life changes. Moderate to high levels of stress

were reported by 13%, anxiety by 13%, depression by 15.9% and high work exhaustion by 43%.

Multivariable analyses of associations between these outcomes and a common set of work and

higher prevalence of all five outcomes (Table 2 – univariable analyses in supplemental materials): poor

supervisor support, higher number of family/home stressors, and age below 40. Working onsite in

clinical operations was associated with higher anxiety and lower mean well-being; being a staff

member (rather than faculty or post-doc) was associated with better well-being and lower prevalence

of stress and work exhaustion. Reported exposure to COVID-19 (diagnosis in self or family, or exposure

to someone likely to have COVID-19) was associated with higher stress, anxiety, depression, and work

exhaustion. Household income $70,000 and below was associated with higher prevalence of stress,

anxiety, and depression. Women were more likely to report experiencing anxiety, work exhaustion,

and decreased well-being. Unanticipated protective factors were also notable: having children at home

was associated with lower prevalence of anxiety and depression, and underrepresented racial/ethnic

groups were less likely to report stress, depression, or decreased well-being.

Comparison of outcomes between faculty and staff working in clinical settings is shown in Table 3

(univariable analyses in supplemental materials). Those working in high risk settings (Intensive Care

Unit, Emergency Room, or performing procedures likely to generate respiratory aerosols) were more

likely to report caring for COVID-19 patients and experiencing an increased workload since COVID-19

restrictions began, had a worse mean score on changes in well-being, and were more likely to report

moderate to high stress and depression, high work exhaustion, and burnout. Multivariable analysis of

faculty and staff working in clinical operations showed that caring for patients who had COVID-19 was

associated with higher prevalence of stress, anxiety, burnout, and work exhaustion. (Table 4) High-risk

clinical work (ICU, ED, aerosol-generating procedures) showed similar, albeit weaker associations with

these outcomes in multivariable analysis (data not shown). There were no statistically significant

differences between clinically active staff and faculty for any outcome. Notably, low supervisor support

was strongly associated with of all mental health and well-being outcomes, and a high number of

family/home stressors was associated with all outcomes except depression.

DISCUSSION
The EMPOWER study found high prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion,
burnout, and worsened well-being among clinical and non-clinical university employees
surveyed 4 – 5 weeks after work at home policies were implemented for those performing work
deemed “non-essential” during the crisis phase of the pandemic. These findings uniquely
highlight the associations of health and well-being with additional personal and work factors
beyond those addressed in existing studies of HCW during the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic.
Importantly, our study also reports on workers outside of clinical medicine, whose health and
well-being has been minimally studied. A unique finding of this study is that the factors with the
strongest consistent associations with all health and well-being outcomes in both clinical and
non-clinical workers were items from the Family Supportive Supervisor Behavior Short-Form
(FSSB-SF), a measure of general perception of family specific supervisory support,8 and a sum of
eight stressors related to family/home life and financial security. Perceived supervisor support
for family is a pathway through which employees develop perceptions of organizational
support,14 plays a major role influencing the health and well-being of workers,15 and is
associated with reduction in work-family conflict, improved well-being, and increased job
satisfaction.14,16 Importantly, these factors are potentially modifiable by employer policies and
practices.

Limitations of this study include its cross-sectional design, so associations between potential
risk factors and health and well-being outcomes may not be causal. The overall response rate of
34.5% means that the respondents may not be fully representative of all university employees.

Since the survey was anonymous, our study relies entirely on self-reported data. We studied
employees of one university, who may not be representative of other workforces. The St. Louis
region was an early adopter of physical distancing and has had a later peak of SARS-CoV-2 and a
lower incidence of COVID-19 patients than some other areas of the US. Strengths of the study
include its large size, examination of employees who are not in health care, and evaluation of
both family/home stressors and workplace factors including supervisor support. To our
knowledge this is the first large American study of mental health and well-being outcomes
related to the pandemic outside of HCW. We will conduct repeated surveys over time to track
changes in individual health and well-being over time, and to allow more robust causal
inferences.

Our findings among clinical workers, both faculty (primarily physicians) and staff (primarily
nurses) are broadly consistent with findings from other cross-sectional studies of HCW caring
for COVID patients. A study of 1257 HCW in China1 used different instruments and found higher
prevalence of depression and anxiety than seen in our study. Their study reported that HCW
directly involved in the care of patients with COVID-19 were at a greater risk of anxiety and
depression, similar to our findings of increased risks of stress, anxiety, burnout, and work
exhaustion. A study of 906 HCW in Singapore and India,17 using the DASS-21, found moderate
to severe stress in 3.8%, anxiety in 2.2%, and depression in 8.7%, much lower than the
prevalence of 14.5%, 17.2%, and 16.4% seen in our study. Our finding that family/home
stressors and supervisor support for family-work balance were strongly associated with mental
health and well-being outcomes are consistent with the findings of a recent review18 of

psychological reactions of HCW during past epidemics. Their analyses showed that
responsibilities of caring for family members and lower household income were associated with
poorer mental health outcomes among HCW. While HCW caring for COVID-19 patients had
worse mental well-being than their fellow faculty and staff, those working from home or onsite
in non-clinical roles also had appreciable rates of poor outcomes. While we do not have
baseline measures for the well-being and mental health outcomes in our study, respondents
described altered well-being related to COVID-19-related work/life changes, with 14.6%
reporting “much worse” and 68% reported “much worse” or “somewhat worse” mental wellbeing. These findings are strikingly similar to those of an April 2020 poll by the Kaiser Family
Foundation. Among those who had not experienced job or income loss, 15% reported major
negative impacts on their mental health from worry or stress over coronavirus, and 54%
reported some negative mental health impacts.19

University staff and to some extent faculty are representative of the larger non-clinical
workforce that is undergoing uniquely stressful circumstances that blur the boundaries
between work and family as people work from home, find it difficult to work because their
children’s schools and daycares are closed, or worry about bringing an infection home to their
families. While front-line HCW are at uniquely high risk due to their work, our study shows that
effects of family and home stresses and of supervisor support play a large role in their health
and well-being. Appreciation of these factors has been largely missing from studies of risk
factors for mental health and well-being among HCW during this pandemic. These same family
and home stresses and supervisor support also influence the health of the broader working

population. As the pandemic continues in the months and perhaps years to come, our concern
over the mental health and well-being of healthcare workers must broaden to include other
worker groups as well.

There are many possible interventions to address the health and well-being of the clinical and
non-clinical workforces. A systematic review found that organizational and social support, clear
communication, and having a sense of control were protective factors for adverse mental
health outcomes among healthcare workers during prior epidemics.20 Recent publications have
stressed the importance of robust organizational responses to address the mental health and
well-being of front-line HCW.5,21 Many of these interventions should be applicable outside of
the healthcare setting. While interventions aimed at improving resilience among individual
workers may lead to improvements in burnout and other well-being measures, organizational
level interventions that reduce perceived work demands or increase resources are generally
more effective.22 Our data would suggest that organizations should explicitly focus on
improving supervisor support for work-family issues. Evaluation of interventions training
supervisors in family supportive behaviors, including a study in healthcare workers, have
suggested that such training is associated with improved reports of physical health, job
satisfaction, job engagement, and decreased intent to leave the current job.23,24 Future
research should include longitudinal studies to follow mental well-being over time, should
include more workers outside of health care to better understand the effects on the broader
population, and should test both individual level and institutional level interventions to mitigate
the effects of the pandemic on mental health.

Conclusions
Both health care and other workers have encountered worsened mental health and well-being
as a result of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Employers, health care systems, and public health
agencies should begin interventions to improve mental health and overall well-being among
HCW and the broader workforce. In addition to traditional wellness interventions addressing
resilience and mental health issues among individual workers, responses should include
support for work/family balance and other organizational changes to improve work conditions
for health care and other workers.
