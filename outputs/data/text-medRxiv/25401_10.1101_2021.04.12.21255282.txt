Abstract

19

A large-scale SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey of New Zealand blood donors (n=9806) was

20

conducted at the end of 2020. Seroprevalence, after adjusting for test sensitivity and specificity,

21

was very low (0.1%). This finding is consistent with limited community transmission and provides

22

robust evidence to support New Zealand’s successful elimination strategy for COVID-19.

Research Letter

24

New Zealand has a strategy of eliminating SARS-CoV-2 that has resulted in a low

25

incidence of coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19). The first case was reported on February 26th

26

2020, and the country entered a strict nationwide lockdown one month later for 49 days (1).

27

Through rigorous border control and managed isolation and quarantine facilities for new arrivals,

28

New Zealand has since remained largely COVID-19 free. Globally, serological surveillance has

29

been utilized throughout the pandemic to define cumulative incidence, including estimations of

30

missed cases and/or asymptomatic infection. Due to lockdowns and movement restrictions, blood

31

donors have been used as a sentinel population in many settings (2,3). The aim of this study was

32

to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in New Zealand via a blood donor serosurvey. Though the

33

pandemic response has been highly effective, PCR testing was initially restricted due to limited

34

diagnostic reagents (4) and there have been occasional border incursions and small community

35

outbreaks, including a cluster in August 2020 with no identified link to the border.

36

Samples were collected by the New Zealand Blood Service via 9 static collection centers

37

and 36 mobile collection services over a 4-week period (December 3rd 2020 - January 6th 2021)

38

from individuals aged 16 to 88 years. Duplicates were removed, leaving 9,806 samples for

39

analysis. Compared with the 2018 New Zealand census, participants were more likely to be aged

40

40-59 years (43.3% versus 25.9%) and of European ethnicity (77.8% versus 61.0%) but had a

41

similar proportion of females (49.1% versus 50.7%) and were geographically spread with 16 of 20

42

district health board regions represented (Table 1 and Appendix). This study was assessed by the

43

Health and Disability Ethics Committee, and additional consent was not required (21/CEN/21).

44

Antibodies to the Spike (S) protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD) persist for many

45

months after infection, compared with antibodies to the nucleocapsid (N) protein (5,6), providing

46

rationale for the use of S protein-based assays in serosurveys. The overall serological testing

47

algorithm was optimized for specificity given the low number of reported COVID-19 cases in

48

New Zealand (2,190 as of January 6th 2021) and the associated period prevalence of 0.04%, which

49

limits the positive predictive value of tests with reduced specificity (7). Samples were first

50

screened with a widely used and well-validated 2-step ELISA that comprises a single point dilution

51

assay against the RBD followed by titration against trimeric S protein (Appendix) (8,9). Samples

52

above the cut-off were tested on two further immunoassays – the EuroImmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG

53

ELISA (EuroImmun AG, Lübeck, Germany) and the cPass surrogate Viral Neutralization Test

54

(sVNT) (GenScript, New Jersey, USA) and deemed seropositive if above the cut-off on both

55

commercial assays. Sensitivity and specificity for these assays were determined by Receiver

56

Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves based on previous analyses (413 pre-pandemic negatives,

57

99 PCR confirmed cases) (Appendix) (9,10).

58

Of the 9,806 samples, 18 were positive for both Spike IgG (EuroImmun) and antibodies

59

that block the RBD-hACE-2 interaction (sVNT), with the values highly correlated

60

(Pearson r 0.7993, p < 0.0001) (Figure). Further analysis of the 18 seropositive samples with a

61

multiplex bead-based assay that detects antibody isotype reactivity to RBD, S and N proteins (5)

62

revealed a pattern consistent with infections that occurred weeks or months prior; a dominance of

63

RBD and S protein IgG with few samples positive for N protein IgG, nor IgA or IgM against any

64

of the three antigens (Figure). Within these 18 seropositive samples, six were retrospectively

65

matched to donors with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. That all confirmed cases

66

were detected supports the rationale of the testing algorithm applied. A further four seropositive

67

samples were from donors with 2020 travel history in settings with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2

68

exposure (United Kingdom and Europe), suggesting likely infection outside New Zealand. The

69

remaining eight seropositive samples were from seven different district health regions, giving a

70

crude seroprevalence estimate of 0.082% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.035-0.16%). Applying

71

the Rogan-Gladen estimate with the Lang-Reiczigel CI method to account for test sensitivity and

72

specificity results in a true seroprevalence estimate of 0.103% (95% CI 0.09-0.12%) (Appendix)

73

and an infection to case ratio of 2.3, based on notified cases on January 6th, 2021, suggesting some

74

undiagnosed infections have occurred. However, this ratio needs to be interpreted with caution

75

given the limitations of the sampling population, together with the extremely low number of

76

seropositive donors, which also precludes any subgroup analysis.

77

The very low seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in New Zealand implies undetected

78

community transmission has been limited. This seroprevalence is broadly similar to a recent study

79

conducted in a low prevalence state of Australia (3), and markedly lower than estimates of >10%

80

from serosurveys in Europe and America where the pandemic has been poorly controlled

81

(https://serotracker.com). This study provides the first robust, serological evidence of New

82

Zealand’s successful elimination strategy ahead of vaccine roll-out.
