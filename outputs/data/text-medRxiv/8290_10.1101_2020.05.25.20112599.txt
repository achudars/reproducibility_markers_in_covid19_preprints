Abstract
To screen potential risk and protective socioeconomic factors for Coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) prevalence and fatality, meta-regression of data from top 50 U.S.
large-population cities was performed. The population estimate (in 2019) of each
country to which the city belongs was abstracted from the "County Population Totals:
2010-2019." From the "Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center," the cumulative
number of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in each country was obtained on
May 22, 2020.

Socioeconomic characteristics of each country were extracted from the

"2014–2018 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Data Profile" and "Small
Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) Program (for 2018)." Radom-effects
meta-regression

was

performed

using

(http://www.cebm.brown.edu/openmeta/index.html).

OpenMetaAnalyst

A coefficient (slope of the

meta-regression line) for COVID-19 prevalence was significantly negative for male sex,
education attainment, computer and Internet use, and private health insurance.
Whereas, the coefficient was significantly positive for black race, never matrimony,
unemployment, and poverty.

In the multivariable model, the coefficient was

significantly negative for male sex (P = 0.036) and computer use (P = 0.024), and
significantly positive for never matrimony (P < 0.001).

A coefficient for COVID-19

fatality was significantly negative for no health insurance, and significantly positive for
elderly, unemployment, and public coverage.

In the multivariable model, the

coefficient was significantly positive for only elderly (P = 0.002).

In conclusion, a

number of socioeconomic factors, e.g. male sex (negatively for prevalence), elderly
(positively for fatality), never matrimony (positively for prevalence), and computer use
(negatively for prevalence) may be associated with COVID-19.

Text

Introduction

Reuters reported "The coronavirus mortality rate among some of the poorest Catalans is
five times higher than among the wealthiest residents of the Spanish region, a study
showed, in the latest evidence of how COVID-19 [Coronavirus disease 2019] hits the
needy hardest" on 22 May, 2020.1 It has been suggested that outcomes of pandemic
influenza are associated with socioeconomic status.2 Socioeconomic characteristics
also may affect prevalence and case fatality of COVID-19.

To screen potential risk

and protective socioeconomic factors for COVID-19 prevalence and fatality,
meta-regression of data from top 50 U.S. large cities was performed.

Methods

From

the

"Population

and

Housing

Unit

Estimates

(https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html)," top 50 U.S. large-population
cities (in 2019) were selected.

The population estimate (in 2019) of each country to

which the city belongs was abstracted from the "County Population Totals: 2010-2019
(https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html
)."

From

the

"Johns

Hopkins

Coronavirus

Resource

Center

(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map)," the cumulative number of confirmed cases and
deaths of COVID-19 in each country was obtained on May 22, 2020.

sex (P < 0.001; Figure 1, Panel A), education attainment (P = 0.011), computer (P <
0.001; Figure 1, Panel B) and Internet (P < 0.001) use, and private health insurance (P =
0.029), which suggests that COVID-19 prevalence may decrease significantly as male
sex, education attainment, computer and Internet use, and private health insurance
increases.

Whereas, the coefficient was significantly positive for black race (P <

0.001), never matrimony (P < 0.001; Figure 1, Panel C), unemployment (P = 0.003),
and poverty (P < 0.001), which suggests that COVID-19 prevalence may increase
significantly as black race, never matrimony, and poverty increases.

In the

multivariable model entering all these 9 covariates, the coefficient was significantly
negative for male sex (P = 0.036) and computer use (P = 0.024), and significantly
positive for never matrimony (P < 0.001), which suggests that male sex and computer
use may be independently and negatively associated with COVID-19 prevalence and
never matrimony may be independently and positively associated with COVID-19
prevalence.
A coefficient for COVID-19 fatality was significantly negative for no health
insurance (P = 0.006), and significantly positive for elderly (P < 0.001; Figure 1, Panel
D), unemployment (P = 0.011), and public coverage (P = 0.003).

In the multivariable

model, the coefficient was significantly positive for only elderly (P = 0.002), which
suggests that elderly may be independently and positively associated with COVID-19
fatality.

The present results suggest an independent and negative association of male sex and
computer use with COVID-19 prevalence, an independent and positive association of
never matrimony with COVID-19 prevalence, and an independent and positive
association of elderly with COVID-19 fatality.
The present findings never denote, for instance, that a subject having a computer is
at low risk of COVID-19 prevalence, which should be noted.

Because of the

community-level epidemiological study, the present results simply denote, for instance,
that COVID-19 prevalence is lower in a community in which there are more subjects
having a computer.

Further patient-level clinical studies would be expected to

determine, for instance, whether a subject having a computer is at low risk of
COVID-19 prevalence.

In meta-regression being generally different from simple

regression, the relationship between outcome and explanatory variables is more
influenced by larger studies (countries in case of the present analysis) than by smaller
studies because the precision of each estimate weights studies.3

Thus, to screen

potential risk and protective socioeconomic factors for COVID-19 prevalence and
fatality, meta-regression may be more valid than simple regression.
In conclusion, a number of socioeconomic factors, e.g. male sex (negatively for
prevalence), elderly (positively for fatality), never matrimony (positively for
prevalence), and computer use (negatively for prevalence) may be associated with
COVID-19.
