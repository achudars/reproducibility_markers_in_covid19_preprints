Abstract
Measuring the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can enable the assessment
of past infection as well as protective immunity and the risk of reinfection. While
neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers are one measure of protection, such assays are
challenging to perform at a large scale and the longevity of the SARS-CoV-2 nAb
response is not fully understood. Here, we apply a T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing
assay that can be performed on a small volume standard blood sample to assess the
adaptive T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Samples were collected from a
cohort of 302 individuals recovered from COVID-19 up to 6 months after infection.
Previously published findings in this cohort showed that two commercially available
SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays correlate well with nAb testing. We demonstrate that the
magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response strongly correlates with nAb
titer, as well as clinical indicators of disease severity including hospitalization, fever, or
difficulty breathing. While the depth and breadth of the T-cell response declines during
convalescence, the T-cell signal remains well above background with high sensitivity up
to at least 6 months following initial infection. Compared to serology tests detecting
binding antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleoprotein, the overall sensitivity of the
TCR-based assay across the entire cohort and all timepoints was approximately 5%
greater for identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the improved performance
of T-cell testing compared to serology was most apparent in recovered individuals who
were not hospitalized and were sampled beyond 150 days of their initial illness,
suggesting that antibody testing may have reduced sensitivity in individuals who
experienced less severe COVID-19 illness and at later timepoints. Finally, T-cell testing
was able to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection in 68% (55/81) of convalescent samples
having nAb titers below the lower limit of detection, as well as 37% (13/35) of samples
testing negative by all three antibody assays. These results demonstrate the utility of a
TCR-based assay as a scalable, reliable measure of past SARS-CoV-2 infection across
a spectrum of disease severity. Additionally, the TCR repertoire may be useful as a
surrogate for protective immunity with additive clinical value beyond serologic or nAb
testing methods.

Introduction
Understanding the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential to inform clinical management of COVID-19 and
vaccination strategies to contain the pandemic (1). Infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces
both humoral and T-cell responses, but the nature and kinetics of these responses are
heterogeneous, varying with disease severity and individual characteristics (2–4).
Similarly, antibody titer and T-cell assays have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2
vaccines induce humoral and/or cell-mediated immune responses, but the optimal
combination of responses underlying immune correlates of protection remains
undefined (5, 6). This knowledge gap is underscored by recently described viral variants

that can escape antibody responses (7, 8) with relatively preserved CD4+ and CD8+ Tcell responses (9), having potential impacts on vaccine-induced immunity and the
capacity for viral neutralization (10, 11).
While serologic assays are a common means of assessing prior SARS-CoV-2 infection
at the population level (4, 12), it remains unclear whether the results of serologic testing
correspond with long-term protective immunity (13, 14). In addition, neutralizing
antibody (nAb) titers, while providing one measure of immune protection in SARS-CoV2 infection (15), are challenging to perform, pose biohazard risks and may have limited
durability over time (16). More recently, T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire-based assays
have emerged as another technology for reliable assessment of prior infection and
immunity (17, 18). Such assays can be performed on standard whole blood samples of
1-2mL. Through application of SARS-CoV-2-specific classifiers leveraging thousands of
public TCR sequences, that is, those sequences that are shared across individuals with
a history of infection, both the presence and magnitude of the T-cell response to SARSCoV-2 can be more fully evaluated (17). However, additional data are needed to
validate the utility, performance, and advantages of these assays relative to serologic or
nAb testing.
A recent study compared nAb titers with the performance of two SARS-CoV-2 IgG
serology tests using blood samples collected up to 6 months after symptom onset as
part of a convalescent plasma donor screening program (19). Results from this study
demonstrated that these tests correlate with nAb testing, enabling better prioritization of
high-titer samples for immunoglobulin donor products. Here we conduct further
assessments of samples from this cohort as well as additional enrolled individuals, in
order to characterize the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 and its relationship with
antibody testing strategies and clinical indicators of disease.

Results/Discussion
SARS-CoV-2–specific T-cell responses are correlated with neutralizing antibody
titers
TCRβ sequencing was performed on samples from 302 persons with a prior positive
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test in the setting of compatible illness. Of these, 55 had an
additional sample from a subsequent visit with a median of 90 days between samples,
for a total of 357 samples. All samples were collected during convalescence, ranging
from 29-190 days after symptom onset (Supplemental Table 1). We first evaluated the
association between clonal breadth and depth of the T-cell response and nAb titers.
Clonal breadth was defined as the relative number of distinct SARS-CoV-2-associated
T-cell clonotypes as a fraction of the overall repertoire, and clonal depth as the extent of
expansion of SARS-CoV-2–associated T-cells (17). Both clonal breadth (p<1e-20, ρ =
0.54, Spearman) and depth (p<1e-20, ρ=0.46, Spearman) showed highly significant
positive correlations with nAb titer (Figure 1A,B). These data suggest that, like nAb titers

(15), SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response signatures may represent a potential surrogate of
protective immunity arising from natural infection.
To further characterize the correlation between the T-cell response and nAb titers, we
assigned a subset of TCR sequences to specific antigens and class I or class II HLA
restriction based on data from multiplexed antigen stimulation assays (17, 20). These
TCRs are associated with cytotoxic (CD8+) and helper (CD4+) cellular immune
responses, respectively. For helper (CD4+) T cells, we could assign 769 TCRs to
antigens from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, 362 to nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and 474
to other viral proteins. We then evaluated correlations of nAb titers to these assigned
TCR sets; partial correlations were applied to account for correlations in immune
response to different antigens which may result from natural biologic variation, such as
systemic immune activation or total viral burden (described in greater detail in the
Supplementary Methods). These analyses revealed that the clonal breadth and depth of
class II-associated TCRs for spike protein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein remain
correlated with nAb titer after partial correlation, while TCRs for the remaining antigens
do not (Supplemental Figure 2A-C). Of interest, TCRs assigned to CD8+ T cells were
not correlated to nAb titers, suggesting that the primary origin of the nAb correlation with
overall SARS-CoV-2-specific TCR breadth and depth is the helper T-cell response.
While most nAbs are presumed to be targeting the spike protein (15), these results
suggest that CD4+ cells responding to antigens from spike as well as some other
proteins may support the development of functional humoral immunity.

SARS-CoV-2–specific T-cell responses are correlated with clinical measures of
COVID-19 severity
Previous analyses involving this cohort revealed significant associations between nAb
response and a number of important clinical correlates, including older age, male sex,
the presence of fever, difficulty breathing, and hospitalization denoting more severe
disease (19). We observed that the clonal breadth of the SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response
is significantly correlated (p< 0.05) with each of these variables by both single and multivariable regression (Figure 2). Clonal depth was also significantly correlated (p<0.05)
with each variable except difficulty breathing (Supplemental Figure 1). These
associations are independent of the number of unique T-cell rearrangements, which
was included in the multi-variable regression. The association between magnitude of
the T-cell response and clinical indicators of disease severity is consistent with other
reports showing higher T-cell responses in symptomatic versus asymptomatic
individuals that can persist months after infection (3, 21). We hypothesize that increased
viral load, longer viral persistence, and/or higher levels of immune activation during
acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may in part underlie the association between more severe
COVID-19 illness and greater recruitment and long-term durability of the T-cell
response. T cell breadth and depth was also higher in men and older adults (Figure

2D,E; Supplemental Figure S1D,E), consistent with increased rates of severe illness
and hospitalization seen in these groups (22).

SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses have higher diagnostic sensitivity than
serology in identifying past infection, particularly in non-hospitalized cases.
Based on identification of public SARS-CoV-2–specific T-cell signatures shared across
individuals, a classifier was developed to diagnose recent and past SARS-CoV-2
infection (17) in previously-confirmed RT-PCR-positive cases that has been validated in
several independent data sets (18, 21). Optimization and application of this TCR
classifier (further described in Methods) as a test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection yielded
a sensitivity of 88.8% across all samples and timepoints, with a specificity of 99.8% in a
control set of 1,657 pre-pandemic samples sequenced prior to 2020 (Figure 3A;
Supplemental Table 2). Consistent with the observation that TCR repertoire breadth
and depth are greater in individuals with more severe disease (Figure 2, Supplemental
Figure 1), we found that sensitivity of the classifier was higher in hospitalized (93.2%)
compared to non-hospitalized cases (88.2%; Supplementary Table 2). Although the
classifier (log-odds) scores decreased slightly with time from symptom onset (ρ = -0.15,
p=0.01, Spearman), the assay maintained a sensitivity of 95% for samples collected
>150 days after symptom onset (Figure 3B). Together, these results support the utility of
the TCR-based assay as a sensitive measure of prior disease.
Next, we compared results from the TCR-based assay with two serology assays which
were interpreted using manufacturer-suggested cutoffs (1.1 for EUROIMMUN AntiSARS-CoV-2 ELISA, 1.4 for Abbott Architect; www.fda.gov). The EUROIMMUN assay
measures IgG binding to the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and the
Abbott Architect assay measures IgG binding to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein.
Across the entire cohort and inclusive of all timepoints assessed, these assays had
sensitivities significantly lower than TCR-based testing (p=0.01, mid-p McNemar’s test;
Table 1, Supplemental Table 2) (19). Notably, when performance was assessed at
specific sampling timepoints in the months following initial illness, both serology assays
showed steeper declines in quantitative diagnostic scores over time relative to the TCRbased assay (Figure 3C,D), with the greatest differences in sensitivity observed beyond
5 months (>150 days) from initial symptoms (p<0.03 comparing the TCR-based assay
to EUROIMMUN and Abbott, mid-p McNemar’s test; Table 1, Supplemental Table 2).
We then explored the performance of TCR and serology tests among hospitalized and
non-hospitalized individuals (Supplemental Table 3). All 3 tests exhibited high sensitivity
(93.2% or higher) for identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized individuals,
with no significant difference in performance between tests (p=0.15, mid-p McNemar’s
test) and consistently high sensitivity >100 days after symptom onset (Supplemental
Table 3). However, for non-hospitalized individuals, the sensitivity of the TCR-based
test was significantly higher than serology tests (p=0.01, mid-p McNemar’s test; Table

1). Notably, in non-hospitalized individuals, wider differences in sensitivity were seen for
samples tested >100 days from symptom onset (86.2%, 76.6%, and 72.3% for the T-cell
test, EUROIMMUN, and Abbott, respectively; p=0.01, mid-p McNemar test; Table 1).
Taken together, these findings suggest that the rate of signal decline over time may be
faster for antibody-based tests relative to T-cell testing, particularly in non-hospitalized
individuals (Figure 3C,D), consistent with data indicating that some individuals may
undergo loss of detectable antibodies or seroreversion (23).

SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses are detectable in a large proportion of
convalescent cases testing negative by nAb or serology
Figure 3 (E,F) and Supplemental Figure 3A show discordant results from antibody
testing compared to T-cell testing on all samples. While the EUROIMMUN, Abbott, and
nAb tests identified some samples as SARS-CoV-2-positive that were classified as
negative by T-cell testing, this was offset by a greater number of samples identified as
SARS-CoV-2-positive that were not identified by each of the 3 antibody assays,
resulting in 24, 21, and 41 more samples being correctly classified by T-cell testing
compared to EUROIMMUN, Abbott, and nAb respectively. Notably, T-cell testing was
able to identify 68% (55/81) of convalescent SARS-CoV-2 samples with nAb titers
below the lower limit of detection (1:40); nearly all (53/55) of these samples originated
from non-hospitalized cases. Additionally, T-cell testing identified 37% (13/35) of
samples which were classified as negative by all three antibody assays, all originating
from non-hospitalized individuals (Figure 3E,F; Supplemental Figure 3B). Notably, the
22 samples without detectable immune responses on any test originated from patients
with mild disease, with a lower reported incidence of fever compared to other samples
(p=0.01, T-test) and only one patient with hospitalization. These results are consistent
with other published reports describing that some individuals generate a T-cell response
to SARS-CoV-2 infection without detectable antibodies, particularly in mild disease (23–
25).
Results from this study provide evidence for robust and persistent T-cell responses to
SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in patients with more severe disease who required
hospitalization. The depth and breadth of T-cell responses correlate strongly with nAb
titers, supporting the potential role for TCR repertoire sequencing as a surrogate for
SARS-CoV-2 protective immunity that reflects both T-cell and humoral compartments.
Finally, we observe that T-cell testing can identify SARS-CoV-2 responses in high
proportions of individuals who do not demonstrate antibody responses on either nAb or
serologic assays, suggesting that such assays may provide incomplete information on
immune protection, particularly in individuals with less severe illness. This observation
underscores that measuring both cellular (via CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) and humoral
immunity is likely necessary for thorough assessment of the immune response to
SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that T-cell testing provides important additive diagnostic

value. This is especially relevant for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies, where recently
updated FDA guidance recommends evaluation of vaccine immunogenicity endpoints
via nAb response, as well as exploration of the potential impact of emerging viral
variants on vaccine-induced immunity (26). From our own experiments mapping TCRs
to specific viral antigens (17) as well as other reports (9), we expect that the majority of
T-cell responses will not be impacted by viral strain variations; we are conducting
additional research to directly assess this in clinical samples.
We also show that a SARS-CoV-2-specific TCR-based test has high sensitivity for
diagnosis of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals up to at least 6 months following
initial infection. We have previously described the clinical validation and performance of
a TCR-based assay (T-Detect) for diagnosing past SARS-CoV-2 infection with high
sensitivity, ~100% specificity, equivalent or higher sensitivity compared to commercial
serologic testing, and lack of pathogen cross-reactivity (18). In the present study, using
an updated classifier that includes additional filtering of the TCR sequence list
(described in Methods), we observed that performance of the TCR-based test was
equivalent to serology testing in hospitalized individuals and was more sensitive than
serology in non-hospitalized individuals, particularly at timepoints beyond 100 days from
initial onset of symptoms. The largest difference in performance was observed at the
latest time points (>150 days), but we note that the sample size was limited to 20
samples over these ranges and additional research is needed to confirm the long-term
performance. As only a minority of individuals with COVID-19 require hospitalization
(5.3%, derived from a CDC data summary of US cases) (27), the improved performance
observed in symptomatic but non-hospitalized individuals supports the utility of T-cell
based testing compared to serology for monitoring past infection in the real-world where
the vast majority of infections occur in the outpatient setting.
We acknowledge several limitations in the present study, including smaller sample sizes
at later timepoints analyzed, restriction of the cohort to symptomatic cases only, and
limited ethnic diversity of the sample population. Nevertheless, these results collectively
indicate that analysis of the TCR repertoire from small-volume standard blood samples
may be a useful surrogate for evaluating past infection and immune protection months
after COVID-19 illness that could overcome several challenges in nAb and serologic
testing, including labor intensity, biohazard risks, scalability, incomplete or absent
antibody signal in non-severe illness, or limited antibody durability over time. Future
studies across diverse populations and longer-term follow-up are needed to better
define the nature and duration of the detectable T-cell response and its utility as a
biomarker for assessing both natural and vaccine-mediated immunity.

Supplemental Materials
Methods
Clinical sample collection and serology assays
The Virology Research Clinic at the University of Washington began enrollment in an
IRB-approved study in April 2020, and all participants provided informed written
consent. The study recruited persons with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
who volunteered to be considered for convalescent plasma donation. The
characteristics of the initial 250 persons in the cohort have been recently published
(Boonyaratanakornkit 2021). The methods used for serologic assays for antibody
responses were included in that report. We continued to recruit subjects and the present
report extends this cohort to 302 persons.
Immunosequencing of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires
Genomic DNA was extracted from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
As much as 18 mg of input DNA was then used to perform immunosequencing of the
CDR3 regions of TCRβ chains using the ImmunoSEQ assay. Briefly, input DNA was
amplified in a bias-controlled multiplex PCR, followed by high-throughput sequencing.
Sequences were collapsed and filtered to identify and quantitate the absolute
abundance of each unique TCRβ CDR3 region amino acid sequence for further analysis
as previously described (Robins 2009; Robins 2012; Carlson 2013).
T-Detect model to characterize the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2
Due to the extreme diversity of CDR3 sequences, a majority of TCRs are private to any
given individual. However, a subset of TCRs can be detected in multiple individuals and
may be the result of exposure to a common antigen (Robins 2010). These public TCRs
serve as a biomarker of disease and have been used to build diagnostic classifiers for
CMV exposure/serostatus (Emerson 2017), and more recently for SARS-CoV-2 (Snyder
2020). In this work, classification of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the clonal
depth and breadth of the T-cell response, were determined using methods based
published by Snyder et al. (Snyder 2020). Briefly, TCR repertoires from 784 unique
cases of RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 2,447 healthy controls collected
before 2020 were compared using one-tailed Fisher’s exact tests to identify 4,469 public
TCRβ amino acid sequences (“enhanced sequences”) significantly enriched in SARSCoV-2–positive samples. None of the samples used for model training were from the
clinical cohort investigated in the present study.
Following initial selection of enhanced sequences, some filtering of the sequence list
was performed to remove potential false positives. Specifically, we reasoned that TCRs
associated with CMV seropositivity or HLA alleles in non-COVID-19 healthy populations
were unlikely to be specific to SARS-CoV-2. We therefore identified TCRs associated

with CMV seropositivity or any of over a hundred HLA-I or HLA-II subtypes using a onetailed Fisher’s exact test applied to TCRβ repertoires of ~2,000 healthy controls with
available HLA genotyping and CMV serotyping data. A total of 182 candidate SARSCoV-2-associated TCR sequences were also associated with an HLA subtype or CMV
seropositivity and were removed, leaving 4,287 enhanced sequences.
The final list of enhanced sequences was used to develop a classifier predicting recent
or past infection with SARS-CoV-2 using a simple two-feature logistic regression, with
independent variables E and N, where E is the number of unique TCRβ DNA
sequences that encode an enhanced sequence and N is the total number of unique
productive TCRβ DNA sequences in that subject. We define the T cell test score to be
the log-odds of the probability of this logistic regression model. A decision boundary on
this T cell test score representing 99.8% specificity on 1,657 controls was used to define
the test-positive threshold used in the present study; this model was identical to that
used in another recent analysis (Gittelman 2021).
The narrowed list of enhanced sequences was also used to calculate the clonal depth
and breadth using the same formulae described in more detail by Snyder, et al. (Snyder
2020). Briefly, treating unique TCR DNA sequences observed in a repertoire as distinct
clonal lineages, clonal breadth represents the fraction of all observed lineages in a
repertoire that are lineages associated to SARS-CoV-2. Clonal depth accounts for the
extent of clonal expansion of each lineage. With ti representing the total number of T
cells observed for lineage i, N representing the total number of T cells in a sequenced
repertoire, and D representing the set of all disease-associated lineages, we estimate
the clonal generations for each lineage as log ! (1 + 𝑡" ). Clonal depth, normalizing for
depth of sampling, is calculated as ∑"∈𝒟 log ! (1 + 𝑡" ) − log ! (𝑁).
Estimating the SARS-CoV-2 protein antigen-specific T-cell response
Public TCRs were assigned to SARS-CoV-2 antigens by cross-referencing enhanced
sequences identified via our case/control design with TCRs observed in multiplexed
antigen-stimulation experiments, both described in prior work (Snyder 2020). To
maximize the number of TCR antigen assignments, we identified a set of public TCRs
from an augmented sample of repertoire data comprising prior training and validation
repertoires, 1,143 additional SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, and over 1,800 samples
identified as SARS-CoV-2-negative from another large study (Gittelman 2020). The final
sample of repertoires, consisting of 1,927 cases and 4,135 controls, was used to
identify ~500,000 candidate public SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs with a Fisher’s Exact
Test P value < 0.05. We cross-referenced this list of TCRs with a set of ~400,000 TCRs
independently derived from multiplexed antigen-stimulation experiments to yield 3,381
overlapping TCRs in both datasets with protein and CD4+/CD8+ assignments
determined based on antigen-stimulation experiments.
The Pingouin package in Python (Vallat 2018) was used to calculate Spearman rank
correlations between antibody titers and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses and report

the two-sided significance. To disentangle confounding correlations, partial Spearman
rank correlations were calculated between spike, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and
other antigen specific T-cell responses and antibody titers; two-sided significance was
reported. Partial correlation coefficients and P values are denoted with tildes when
included in figures. When calculating partial correlations between antibody titers and
specific categories of T-cell responses (CD4+ T-cell response specific to spike,
nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and all other assayed proteins), the other T-cell groups
served as covariates. These partial correlations describe the correlation between two
variables that cannot be explained by the covariates, representing a conservative
measure of correlation.
