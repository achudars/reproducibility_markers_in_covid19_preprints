Abstract
Introduction
Efficient therapeutic strategies are needed to counter the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARSCoV-2 virus. In a context where specific vaccines are not yet available, the containment of the pandemic
would be facilitated with efficient prophylaxis.
Methods
We screened several clinical trials repositories and platforms in search of the prophylactic strategies that
are investigated against COVID-19 in late April 2020.
Results
Up to April 27, 2020, we found 68 clinical trials targeting medical workers (n=43, 63%), patients
relatives (n=16, 24%) or individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 (n=5, 7%). (Hydroxy)chloroquine was
the most frequently evaluated treatment (n=46, 68%), before BCG vaccine (n=5, 7%). Sixty-one (90%)
clinical trials were randomized with a median of planned inclusions of 600 (IQR 255-1515).
Conclusion
The investigated prophylaxis strategies cover both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and study
numerous immune enhancers and antivirals, although most research efforts are focused on
(hydroxy)chloroquine.

INTRODUCTION
The SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging human coronavirus discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
It causes the COVID-19 disease, which developed into a pandemic in early 2020: on May 24, 2020, more
than 5 million persons had been infected and more than 340,000 died. In the past four months, more than
12,400 articles have been published and scientific data collected from thousands of patients have been
released. This impressive research and clinical work made it possible to better understand the disease
and its different phases. Numerous clinical trials are currently investigating multiple therapeutic
candidates and strategies (1), including prophylaxis (2).
Prophylaxis refers to measures taken to prevent the onset of the disease. For infectious diseases it includes
for example drugs aimed at blocking the infectious cycle of the pathogen or drugs that can reinforce the
host immunity. There are two main categories of prophylaxis: pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), where
individuals who did not yet encounter the pathogen are treated, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP),
where individuals who may have been infected (for example through contact with patients) but did not
yet develop symptoms are treated. Both strategies have been extensively studied with HIV infections (3).
According to these studies, PrEP with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine can reduce the risk of
HIV transmission by more than 90 percent in patients who are at high risk of acquiring HIV, depending
on the level of adherence (4,5).
Prophylaxis is an interesting strategy for COVID-19 since it could both contain the spread of the SARSCoV-2 and prevent the development of COVID-19, especially in patients at risk of severe forms. In this
review we discuss the current approaches for COVID-19 prophylaxis and the therapeutic perspectives
they raise.
METHODS
A review of currently registered clinical trials was performed to identify relevant studies. A search was
conducted on April 27 on the clinicaltrials.gov repository (6), the EudraCT repository (7), the anticovid
platform (8), the covid-nma platform (9) and the covid-trials platform (10), using the keywords
“prophylaxis”, “PrEP” and “prevention”, except in the covid-nma platform where the keywords
“healthy” and “exposed” were searched in the data file. A search on pubmed on May 14 with the key
words “COVID-19 prophylaxis”, “COVID-19 prophylax*” and “COVID-19 vacc*” did not reveal any
published clinical trial result.
The eligibility criteria were developed using the Patient Intervention Comparison Outcomes Study type
(PICOS) framework (11).
Inclusion criteria were:
- Population: any population
- Intervention/Comparator: any antiviral agent or drug. We excluded trials evaluating therapeutic
strategies whose description was not sufficient to identify a specific drug.
- Outcomes: any outcome evaluating the infection with SARS-CoV-2
- Study type: interventional clinical trial.

We found 309 studies on the clinicaltrials.gov repository, 32 on the EudraCT repository, 508 on the
anticovid platform, 69 on the covid-nma platform and 101 on the covid-trials platform.
After eliminating the duplicates and the studies that were not testing prophylaxis (n=951), 68 relevant
clinical trials were identified (Figure 1), summarized in Table 1. Sixty-one (90%) clinical trials were
randomized with a median of planned inclusions of 600 (IQR 255-1515). Most trials were focused on
hydroxychloroquine (n=46, 68%), followed by BCG vaccine (n=5, 7%) and lopinavir/ritonavir (n=3,
4%). The most frequently evaluated routes of administration were oral (n=51, 75%), intradermal for
vaccines (n=6, 9%) and inhaled (n=4, 6%). Both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis were investigated,
with a substantial number of trials on PrEP for exposed medical workers, as could be expected from the
current emphasis on protecting medical workers in order to keep health systems functional through the
pandemic. The complete list of trials can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

Table 1: Description of the clinical trials registered for the prophylaxis of COVID-19
*4 trials included an association of hydroxychloroquine with other drugs: hydroxychloroquine +
azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine + arbidol, hydroxychloroquine + bromhexine, hydroxychloroquine +
tenofovir + emtricitabine
**4 trials included several categories
(Hydroxy)chloroquine
Chloroquine derivatives, most notably hydroxychloroquine sulfate, inhibit coronavirus membrane fusion
through an increase in endosomal pH and disrupt the glycosylation of their glycoproteins (13) They were
suggested to be efficient against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (12–14) and allegedly improved the disease in
COVID-19 patients (17,18), although these reports are questioned and side effects are suspected (17,18).
These early results and the ease to produce and administer hydroxychloroquine in high quantities may
explain why it is the most investigated prophylaxis against COVID-19, with 68% (46/68) of all clinical
trials analysed in this review, and involving more than 150,000 subjects in total (Supplementary Table
1). Chloroquine derivatives are administered orally at doses ranging from 400mg per week to 600mg per
day, with a loading dose the first day (or occasionally the first 4 days) of 200 to 1200mg. Both pre- and

post-exposure prophylaxis were represented, the former included trials conducted over 65 (IQR=58-90)
days in median, while the median duration of the latter was 5 (IQR=5-5) days after exposure.
Interferons
Type 1 interferons (IFN) are cytokines with pro-inflammatory and unspecific antiviral properties.
Although they are produced by the organism when an infection occurs, treating COVID-19 patients with
additional IFN is thought to be protective in the early phases of infection, when an acceleration in the
recruitment of adaptive immunity can facilitate viral clearance (21). Therefore, type 1 interferons appear
suited to prophylaxis or early disease treatment, and to immunocompromized patients (22). In late stages
of the disease, an excessive immune response could be deleterious and the role of interferons is more
debated. In macaques, prophylactic pegylated IFNα2b administered intramuscularly one on two days at
3mg/kg decreased SARS-CoV replication and lung damage (23). As a therapy, IFNα2b has been reported
to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection duration (24) in a small-scale, non-randomised clinical trial. Recently,
IFNα1b was used as a prophylaxis on hundreds of health care workers, many of whom directly exposed
to COVID-19 patients, and administered by nasal drops, in combination or not with thymosin-α1 (a
putative enhancer of cellular innate immunity) (25). No COVID-19 case was reported in the individuals
who received the prophylaxis. Although very promising, this result must be further confirmed, since it
stems from a non-randomised clinical trial. Different modes of IFN administration are studied, notably
subcutaneous pegylated IFNλ1a in a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04344600).
Lopinavir/ritonavir
Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV), a protease inhibitor, was reported to improve SARS (26), although this
study was criticized due to biases in patients’ assignment (27). Its safety profile is ascertained by its
widespread use against HIV (28). LPV/RTV is investigated as COVID-19 post-exposure prophylaxis in
the CORIPREV-LR trial (NCT04321174) and the COPEP trial (NCT04364022), during respectively 14
or 5 days following exposure to a COVID-19 patient. It is administered orally twice daily at doses of
400mg lopinavir + 100mg ritonavir in CORIPREV-LR, versus 200mg lopinavir + 50mg ritonavir in
COPEP. In the trial COVIDAXIS (NCT04328285), it is used as PrEP, administered orally twice daily at
doses of 200mg lopinavir + 50mg ritonavir for 2 months.
Nitazoxanide
Nitazoxanide is a broad-spectrum antiviral that amplifies cytoplasmic RNA sensing and type 1 IFN
signaling. It inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro (14) and is tested as a PrEP for 600 elderly people
in special care institutions in the trial NCT04343248, and for 800 medical workers in the trial
NCT04359680. It is administered orally twice a day at doses of 600mg in both studies.
Nitric oxide
Nitric oxide, a signaling molecule and unspecific antimicrobial, inhibits SARS-CoV replication in vitro
(29) and is investigated as a PrEP for medical workers in contact with COVID-19 patients in the trial
NCT04312243. It is administered twice daily through a 15 minutes long inhalation of a gas containing
160ppm of nitric oxide. In the NCT04337918 trial, it is used both as PrEP for medical workers and as
post-exposure prophylaxis. Several modes of administration are investigated: gargle, nasopharyngeal
irrigation and nasal spray.
Convalescent serum

Convalescent serum intravenous administration has been proposed as a passive antibody prophylaxis or
therapy against COVID-19 (30) following the hypothesis that antibodies developed by the donor, who
had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and recovered, could protect the recipient against potential infection.
Convalescent serum has already been used as a therapy against MERS-CoV (31), SARS-CoV (32,33)
and SARS-CoV-2 (34), and resulted in improved prognosis, but has not yet been tested as a prophylaxis.
The number of recovered patients is already very high and is expected to grow further: thus, if the pool
of potential donors is efficiently harnessed, large quantities of convalescent serum could be produced
and convalescent plasma may become a good candidate for large-scale prophylaxis. Therefore,
convalescent serum has been included in the guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America
(35) for both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis. This treatment will be tested as a post-exposure
prophylaxis, with 150 individuals belonging to categories highly susceptible to develop a severe disease,
in a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04323800).
However, the most relevant dose of convalescent serum has yet to be determined, and convalescent serum
treatment raises the risk of antibody-dependant enhancement of infection (ADE), a process observed in
a few coronaviruses (36). Consequently, investigations aiming to determine if convalescent antibodies
for SARS-CoV-2 could induce ADE are warranted.
An alternative to convalescent serum prophylaxis is the use of antibody preparations, which are already
being developed, but we did not find clinical trials investigating them.
Tuberculosis or measles vaccines
The BCG tuberculosis vaccine is known to have non-specific protective effects against respiratory
infections. Moreover, the geographical distribution of BCG vaccination is negatively correlated with the
prevalence and mortality of COVID-19 (37,38), although the significance of this correlation is debated
(39,40). 5 clinical trials of BCG vaccination on medical workers exposed to COVID-19 are being
conducted (NCT04328441, NCT04327206, NCT04348370, NCT04350931, NCT04362124) and involve
together 8810 subjects.
Similarly, Mycobacterium w, another tuberculosis vaccine, is tested as anti COVID-19 prophylaxis (both
pre- and post-exposure) in the trial NCT04353518.
An in silico comparison of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with those of the measles, mumps and rubella viruses
suggested that the antigens of the MMR vaccine may immunise patients against SARS-CoV-2 epitopes
(41). Although this hypothesis has not yet been tested in vitro or in vivo, it prompted the launch of the
NCT04357028 trial, where the MMR vaccine is used as PrEP for medical workers.
Levamisole and isoprinosine
Levamisole is a stimulator of T helper type 1 immune response (42), used as vaccine adjuvant.
Isoprinosine is also an immunostimulator and has antiviral properties whose mechanism is unclear (43).
These two drugs are tested in combination in the trial NCT04360122, as a PrEP for medical workers.
They are administered orally at doses of 150mg levamisole twice a week and 1g isoprinosine three times
a day.
Other treatments
Other compounds are investigated in combination with hydroxychloroquine. Umifenovir (arbidol) is a
broad-spectrum antiviral approved in Russia and China which impairs viral membrane fusion (44) and
displays anti SARS-CoV-2 effects. It was correlated with improvements in COVID-19 in a small-scale
(16 patients in the arbidol group), non-randomised clinical trial (45). It is investigated as post-exposure

prophylaxis in the trials ChiCTR2000029803 and ChiCTR2000029592. Azithromycine is an antibiotic
and antiviral reported to synergize with hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 in the controversial
report of Gautret et al.(18). It is compared with hydroxychloroquine as PrEP for medical workers in the
trials NCT04344379 and NCT04354597, with an oral administration of respectively 250mg per day and
500mg per week.
Mefloquine, an anti-malarial drug, was identified as a potent in vitro inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 (46) and
other coronaviruses (47,48), and is currently evaluated as a post-exposure prophylaxis in the 2020001194-69 clinical trial on 200 individuals, with an oral administration of 250mg/day for a month.
In the NCT04334928 trial, both tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine are tested. These are nucleoside
inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase. Their use against COVID-19 was probably prompted by the
discovery that tenofovir binds SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (49), suggesting an antiviral effect. They are
administered orally at respective doses of 245 and 200 mg per day to medical workers.
Bromhexine is a potent and specific inhibitor of the TMPRSS2 protease involved in SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein maturation (50). It is investigated in an early phase 1 clinical trial (NCT04340349), where it is
administered orally at doses of 8mg 3 times a day.

DISCUSSION
Most of the trials studied here are randomised and include a large number of patients. Prophylaxis
research efforts are mainly concentrated on (hydroxy)chloroquine although evidence in favour of this
drug is currently low, a fact which has already been reported for clinical therapeutic trials (1). Numerous
other antivirals potentially active on SARS-CoV-2 are investigated, but in a limited number of studies.
Half of the trials on immune enhancers are testing vaccines against tuberculosis or measles, notably the
BCG vaccine.
Both pre and post exposure prophylaxis are investigated. PrEP strategies targeted at-risk individuals
(such as elderly or with chronic medical conditions such as obesity (12)) or, in most cases, medical
workers highly exposed to infectious patients, on the protection of whom a special emphasis is put in
order to keep health systems functional through the pandemic.
Most trials were focused on (hydroxy)chloroquine (68%), which explains the prevalence of orally
administered treatments. Numerous trials on hydroxychloroquine or BCG vaccine are redundant because
they follow identical or very similar protocols.
An important challenge with prophylactic treatments is that they must be pursued or repeated until the
recipient is immunized or falls out of the priority categories, because the protective effects are shortlived: from a few hours with interferon nasal drops (25) to a few weeks with convalescent serum (30).The
long duration of treatments and the fact that they are targeted on healthy individuals make it essential to
propose treatments easily administered on an outpatient basis and with an excellent tolerance. Compared
with therapeutic treatments, more risks are taken and less advantages are expected, which may lead to
exclude treatments such as hydroxychloroquine for which side effects have been reported.
Naturally, the prophylactic strategies evaluated are centered on the early antiviral action of drugs or the

stimulation of the immune system, e.g. with interferons or convalescent antibodies. The antiinflammatory strategies that have been described elsewhere are reserved for patients with severe disease
and an excessive immune response to the virus (51).
We only included trials that were registered up to April 27, 2020 but new approaches could be tested in
future trials, notably antivirals that demonstrated prophylactic efficiency against coronaviruses, such as
EIDD-2801 (52).
CONCLUSION
Numerous strategies of prophylaxis against COVID-19 are currently investigated, and target different
steps of the virus life cycle or the patient immune system. (Hydroxy)chloroquine is being evaluated in
68% of the registered clinical trials that we found, while numerous prophylactic strategies were
investigated in a small number of trials. This discrepancy highlights the need to increase the number of
treatments investigated in order to achieve an extensive cover of all promising candidate treatments
against COVID-19.
