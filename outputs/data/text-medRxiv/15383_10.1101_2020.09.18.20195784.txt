Abstract

26

Males have excess morbidity and mortality from respiratory viral infections and especially so in COVID-

27

19. The mechanisms explaining this excess in disease burden in males are unknown. Innate immune

28

responses are likely critical in protection against a novel virus like SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesised that

29

innate immune responses may be deficient in males relative to females. To test this we stimulated

30

peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from participants in a population-based birth cohort with

31

three respiratory viruses (rhinoviruses-RV-A16 and RV-A1, and respiratory syncytial virus-RSV) and two

32

viral mimics (R848 and CpG-A, to mimic responses to SARS-CoV-2). We measured interferon (IFN) and

33

IFN-induced chemokine responses and investigated sex differences in virus-induced responses. IFN-α,

34

IFN-β and IFN-γ responses to RV-A16 were deficient in males compared to females, fold-inductions being

35

1.92-fold (P<0.001), 2.04-fold (P<0.001) and 1.77-fold (P=0.003) lower in males than females,

36

respectively. Similar significant deficiencies in innate immune responses were observed in males for

37

eleven other cytokine-stimulus pairs. Responses in males were greater than those in females in only one

38

of 35 cytokine-stimulus pairs investigated. Review of healthcare records revealed that 12.1% of males but

39

only 6.6% of females were admitted to hospital with respiratory infections in the first year of life (P=0.017).

40

Impaired innate anti-viral immunity in males likely results in high morbidity and mortality from respiratory

41

viruses including COVID-19. Males may preferentially benefit from therapies that boost innate anti-viral

42

immune responses.

Significance Statement

45

Clinical outcomes including, mortality, Intensive care unit admissions and hospital admissions, during

46

COVID-19 disease are consistently and substantially worse in males than in females. The mechanisms

47

underlying this increased susceptibility to severe disease in males are not understood. We hypothesised

48

that the differential outcomes between sexes could be a consequence of deficient innate interferon

49

responses in males, and more robust innate interferon responses in females. We have investigated such

50

responses in a large population-based cohort and found that indeed males have deficient innate interferon

51

responses to viral stimuli, including stimuli that mimic SARS-CoV-2 infection, relative to females. Our

52

findings have very important treatment implications as interferons are available for clinical use with

53

immediate effect.

Introduction

56

Respiratory viral infections are a leading cause of ill health and mortality(1). This has been highlighted by

57

the immense global impact of COVID-19(2) and the enormous public health threat it poses. Males and

58

females differ in the prevalence and severity of viral infections(3). In COVID-19, risk factors for mortality

59

include older age, the presence of comorbid conditions, and male sex(4, 5). In an early report of 191

60

cases from Wuhan, China, 70% of deaths were male, while only 30% were female(5). This gender

61

imbalance has subsequently been confirmed in a large study of 44,672 COVID-19 confirmed cases in

62

China, where 63.8% of deaths were male while only 36.2% were female, and the case fatality rate for

63

males was 2.8%, while that for females was 1.7%(6). Similar mortality data are reported in Italy where

64

9390 of 13,334 (70.4%) of COVID-19 deaths in persons under 90 years of age reported by 6th April 2020

65

were male, and 3,944 (29.6%) were female(7). In the UK, the data are very similar, with males

66

representing 65% of deaths involving COVID-19 reported by 27th March 2020, while 35% were

67

females(8). Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission are also much higher for males in Lombardy, Italy, where

68

82% of 1591 ICU admissions were male(9). The ICU data are very similar in the UK, as 72.5% of 3883

69

confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to ICU by the 10th April 2020 were male, and 27.5% female(10). A

70

recent large UK study of 20,133 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, reported more men were

71

admitted than women (men 60%, n=12 068; women 40%, n=8065)(11). An even larger study of primary

72

care records of 17,278,392 adults linked to 10,926 COVID-19-related deaths reported COVID-19-related

73

death was associated with: being male with a hazard ratio of 1.59(12). COVID-19 case identification in

74

population screening also reports a male preponderance, with more males than females testing positive

75

in both targeted testing (16.7% vs 11.0%) and in population screening (0.9% vs 0.6%)(13).

76

The mechanisms explaining excess COVID-19 mortality, ICU and hospital admissions and case

77

identification in males are unknown(14). Understanding how sexes differ in their responses to respiratory

78

viruses is critically important for the development of treatment and preventative strategies, which may

79

differ for males and females. Innate immune responses, mediated by anti-viral interferon (IFN) production

80

by virus-infected cells will be critical in protection against SARS-CoV-2, a new virus that humans have

81

never previously encountered. We have previously reported that deficient IFN-α(15), IFN-β(15, 16) and

82

IFN-γ(17, 18) production by virus-infected cells from people with asthma is implicated in their increased

83

susceptibility to respiratory virus infections(19). However, little is known about the variation within the

84

human immune system in relation to the patterns of response to viruses at a population level. We

85

hypothesised that the adverse outcomes for males reported in COVID-19 may be related to deficient

86

innate immune responses to viruses in males relative to females. To investigate this, we stimulated

87

peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from male and female participants in a population-based

88

birth cohort with three common respiratory viruses and two viral mimics (R848 and CpG-A, to mimic

89

responses to SARS-CoV-2) and measured IFN and IFN-induced chemokine responses in supernatants.

Results

92

Participant flow and demographic data

93

Of 751 participants who attended follow-up at age 16 years, 361 provided blood samples. After quality

94

control (Supplementary Appendix), we excluded data for 16 participants. Participant flow is presented in

95

Fig. 1. There were no differences in demographic characteristics, environmental exposures and clinical

96

features between participants included in this analysis (n=345) and those who were not (n=406), either in

97

the whole population or stratified by sex (Table S1).

98

The demographic and clinical characteristics of the 345 subjects included in this analysis are shown in

99

Table 1. There were no significant differences between sexes in birth weight, relevant environmental

100

exposures (including position in sibship, pet ownership and tobacco smoke exposure) or common

101

respiratory diseases, such as wheezing and asthma. No significant differences were observed in cell

102

viability between sexes (Fig. S1).

103

Induction of IFNs and IFN-induced chemokines in PBMCs in response to viral stimuli

104

There was a significant induction of all IFNs and IFN-induced chemokines in response to all viral stimuli

105

compared to medium control (Figures 2 and S2). Cytokine responses to viral stimuli were not normally

106

distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test, Table S2). The most potent inducers of IFN-α were CpG-A, RSV and RV-

107

A16, with median concentrations of 184.7pg/mL, 108.3pg/mL and 34.0pg/mL respectively compared to

108

0.0pg/mL in medium control (all P<0.001, Figure 2). RV-A1 and R848 also induced IFN-α, but to lesser

109

degrees (Fig. 2). Induction of IFN-β followed a very similar pattern to that of IFN-α, but with lower

110

concentrations.

111

The most potent inducers of IFN-γ were R848, RV-A16 and RSV, with median concentrations of

112

102.1pg/mL, 60.7pg/mL and 35.7pg/mL, respectively, compared to 0.2pg/mL in medium control (all

113

P<0.001, Figure 2). RV-A1 and CpG-A also induced IFN-γ, but to lesser degrees (Fig. 2).

114

The most potent inducers of the IFN-induced chemokine CXCL10/IP-10, were RV-A16, RSV and CpG-A,

115

with median concentrations of 1841.0pg/mL, 1515.2pg/mL and 1343.4pg/mL respectively, compared to

116

130.6pg/mL in medium control samples (all P<0.001, Figure 2). RV-A1 and R848 also induced CXCL-

117

10/IP-10, but to lesser degrees.

118

The IFN-induced chemokines CCL2/MCP1, CCL4/MIP-1β and CCL13/MCP4 were also all induced by all

119

viral stimuli, CCL2/MCP1 and CCL4/MIP-1β most potently by R848 and CCL13/MCP4 most potently by

120

RV-A1 (Fig. S2).

121

Differences between males and females in IFN and IFN-induced chemokine induction

122

Results of the comparisons between sexes are presented in Table 2. The trend across all viral stimuli and

123

responses was remarkably consistent, as almost all of the IFNs and IFN-induced chemokines had higher

124

levels of induction in females compared to males: out of 35 stimulus-cytokine pairs, females exhibited

125

higher induction than males in 32 cases (Table 2).

126

The induction of IFN-a was significantly higher in females than in males for all five viral stimuli (with P-

127

values ranging from <0.001 to 0.018, Table 2). After adjustment for multiple testing, these differences

128

remained statistically significant for RV-A16, RV-A1 and R848 (P=0.001, 0.041 and 0.002 respectively),

129

and marginal for RSV and CpG-A (P=0.055 and 0.051 respectively, Table 2). The magnitude of the

130

differences observed for IFN-α ranged from a 1.34-fold (34%) greater induction of IFN-α in females than

131

in males for RSV, to a 2.06-fold (106%) greater induction for R848.

132

The individual responses of each IFN and of CXCL10/IP-10 to RV-A16 stimulation are depicted in Fig. 3

133

A-D, with induction in females significantly greater than that in males for IFN-a at 1.92-fold (92%) greater

134

(P<0.001), IFN-b at 2.04-fold (104%) greater (P<0.001), IFN-g 1.77-fold (77%) (P=0.003) and CXCL10/IP-

135

10 1.40-fold (40%) greater (P=0.01).

136

Regarding the viral mimics R848 and CpG-A (which mimic responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection), females

137

had significantly greater induction of IFN-a in response to R848 stimulation (2.06-fold, P<0.001), and in

138

response to CpG-A (1.71-fold, P=0.015) (Fig. 4 A-B), though the latter difference was marginal after

139

adjustment (P=0.051, Table 2). Females also had significantly greater induction of IFN-g (2.01-fold,

140

P=0.003) and CCL13/MCP4 (1.36-fold, P=0.04) in response to CpG-A than males (Fig. 4 C-D), though

141

the latter difference was marginal after adjustment (P=0.10, Table 2).

142

Stimulation with RV-A1 also resulted in significantly greater induction in females than in males for IFN-a

143

(Fig. S3A, 1.55-fold, P=0.011), CXCL10/IP-10 (Figure S3B, 1.23-fold, P=0.041, though this difference

144

was marginal after adjustment [P=0.10, Table 2]), CCL4/MIP-1b (Fig. S3C, 1.16-fold, P=0.01) and

145

CCL13/MCP4 (Fig. S3D, 1.61-fold, P=0.002), as did stimulation with RSV (Fig. S3 E-F) for IFN-a

146

(P=0.018) and CCL13/MCP4 (P=0.019). These latter two differences were marginal after adjustment

147

(both P=0.055, Table 2).

148

Since adverse clinical outcomes in viral infections are likely in those individuals with the weakest innate

149

anti-viral responses, we examined proportions of males and females whose innate anti-viral responses

150

were below certain lower thresholds. We restricted this analysis to IFN-α and low thresholds were defined

151

as the 15th, 20th and 25th percentile of the response determined from the entire population. Results are

152

shown in Fig. 5 and S4. Proportions of males having IFN-α responses to RV-A16, RSV and R848 below

153

each threshold were significantly higher compared to the proportion of females (Fig. 5). Similar trends

154

were observed for response of IFN-α to RV-A1, and CpG-A (Fig. S4), but these did not reach statistical

155

significance.

156

Differences in early-life severe LRTIs between males and females

157

Having observed diminished innate immune responses to viral stimuli in males, and greater proportions of

158

males with weak innate immune responses, we investigated whether frequencies of early-life LRTIs were

159

also different between sexes in our cohort. We focussed on early life, as this is when innate immune

160

responses will be most important, as the very young will have had little opportunity to develop memory

161

responses. Results are presented in Table S3. Among participants attending follow up at age 16 years

162

who had primary care records available for inspection (n=651), 12.1% of males and 6.6% of females were

163

admitted to hospital with LRTI in the first year of life (P=0.017). In the second year of life, 6.1% of males

164

but only 0.75% of females were admitted to hospital with LRTI (P <0.001). We observed a similar trend

165

for RSV-positive bronchiolitis, with 4.32% of males hospitalised, compared to 1.64% of females, but the

166

difference between the sexes did not reach formal statistical significance (P=0.067).

Discussion

169

We hypothesised that the adverse outcomes for males reported in virus infections and especially in

170

SARS-CoV-2 infections, including substantially increased COVID-19-related mortality, ICU admissions,

171

hospital admissions and case identification, may be related to deficient innate immune responses in

172

males relative to females, resulting in increased disease severity in males. Our analysis of induction of

173

three IFNs and four IFN-induced chemokines by five respiratory viruses/viral stimuli in PBMCs sampled

174

from participants in a population-based birth cohort study demonstrated that responses in females were

175

substantially greater than those in males in 32 of 35 cytokine-stimulus pairs. Of these, differences in 14

176

cytokine-stimulus pairs were statistically significant, of which 9 remained significant after adjustment for

177

multiple testing, all showing increased responses in females. These statistically significant cytokine-

178

stimulus pairs included IFN-α induction in response to each viral stimulus, IFN-β induction in response to

179

RV-A16 and IFN-γ induction in response to RV-A16 and CpG-A.

180

IFN-α and IFN-β are type I IFNs that are critical mediators of innate anti-viral immune responses, inducing

181

apoptosis of virus-infected cells and inducing over 300 IFN-stimulated genes, many of which have a

182

variety of direct anti-viral activities(20). Through these combined activities, type I IFNs can abort virus

183

replication in virus-infected cells(16).

184

IFN-γ is the only type II IFN, and it also is very important in promoting innate immune responses

185

principally by activating natural killer (NK) cells which are important in innate immune defense against

186

virus infections, by rapid killing of virus-infected cells(21). IFN-γ also primes other immune cells such as

187

macrophages, to release anti-viral cytokines(22) and to phagocytose infected cells(21). IFN-γ has been

188

shown to suppress mouse coronavirus replication, though this was dependent, in part, on induction of

189

type I IFN secretion(23).

190

Type I and II IFNs also cooperate and work together to activate macrophages, NK cells, dendritic cells

191

and T cells by enhancing cell activation, antigen presentation, cell trafficking, cell differentiation and

192

proliferation, resulting in markedly enhanced innate and acquired antiviral immune effector function(24).

193

Thus, deficiency in either or both of these IFN types would be expected to markedly increase severity of

194

virus-induced illnesses. We have previously described deficiency in IFN-α(15), IFN-β(15, 16) and IFN-

195

γ(17, 18) in patients with asthma and have reported that patients with asthma have increased

196

susceptibility to respiratory virus infections(19). In addition, recent reports indicate that deficiencies in IFN

197

responses are linked to increased susceptibility to virus-induced exacerbations of chronic obstructive

198

pulmonary disease(25-28). These data therefore support the biological and clinical relevance of our

199

findings.

200

The deficiencies we observed in IFN responses in males are reflected in a significantly increased

201

incidence of severe LRTIs requiring hospital admissions in the first and second years of life, as well as

202

with a trend for increased incidence of RSV-proven bronchiolitis, a disease with a peak incidence at 4.5

203

months of age(29). We focused on severe LRTIs requiring hospital admissions in early life, as these are

204

almost exclusively viral in aetiology. The first 2 years of life is a time of life during which innate immune

205

responses will be most important, as infants and toddlers will have had very little experience of viral RTIs

206

and will therefore have little memory/acquired immunity. The fact that we find females produce

207

approximately twice the concentrations of IFN-α and IFN-β in response to RV-A16 and of IFN-α in

208

response to R848, 55% more IFN-α in response to RV-A1 and 71% and 52% more IFN-α and IFN-β in

209

response to CpG-A, than do males, and females have ~half the number of LRTIs requiring hospital

210

admission in the first year of life, 88% fewer in the second year of life and 62% fewer admissions with

211

RSV-positive bronchiolitis also lends credence to the biological and clinical relevance of our findings in

212

relation to diseases where innate immune responses will be vitally important in protection against adverse

213

outcomes.

214

SARS-CoV-2 is a virus completely new to mankind, it is therefore even more important to have as strong

215

an innate immune response to this virus as possible, to reduce the likelihood of adverse outcomes. The

216

marked reductions in type I IFN responses to viral stimuli reported herein in males relative to females,

217

with the relationships discussed above with virus-induced exacerbations of lung disease(15-18, 25-28),

218

and with severe viral LRTIs in infants in our cohort, make it almost certain that the deficient IFN

219

responses we report in males will be at least in part responsible for the adverse outcomes to SARS-CoV-

220

2 infection currently being reported in COVID-19 in males(2, 4-10, 12, 13).

221

A very recent study by Takahashi et al studied sex differences in immune responses during COVID-19

222

disease in hospitalised patients and claimed that these differences underlie sex differences in COVID-19

223

disease outcomes(30). This study reported female patients mounted significantly more robust T cell

224

activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection. They also found that a poor T cell response

225

was associated with worse disease outcome in male patients. This study also reported significantly

226

increased plasma concentrations of IL-8 and IL-18 and numbers of peripheral blood non-classical

227

monocytes in males, with trends to increased SARS-CoV-2 virus load (of magnitude 1-2 Log10 copies/mL,

228

noting that virus load was only measured in the upper respiratory tract and not in the lung) and plasma

229

CXCL-10 concentrations in males. As robust innate interferon responses are well known to drive robust T

230

cell responses during viral infections(24), and deficient innate interferon responses studied ex vivo pre-

231

infection are known to relate to increased virus load, increased inflammatory outcomes and worse clinical

232

outcomes upon subsequent in vivo respiratory virus infection(31), we suggest all the differential outcomes

233

between sexes identified by Takahashi et al would be a consequence of the deficient innate interferon

234

responses in males, and more robust innate interferon responses in females, that we report herein.

235

Our study has strengths and limitations. Strengths include the population-based cohort design, so our

236

participants should be representative of the general population, the fact that illness ascertainment was

237

carried out by personal inspection of primary care records to maximise accuracy, that PBMCs were

238

stimulated/infected with the most common respiratory viruses and with ligands of TLRs that are

239

representative of RNA respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, and that infections/stimulations were

240

carried out using a single batch of each virus/stimulus and conducted by a single highly experienced

241

individual, so any variability in response will be participant-related and not a result of technical variability.

242

Limitations include that PBMCs were not directly infected/stimulated with SARS-CoV-2. This was not

243

possible as our participants’ PBMCs were infected/stimulated before SARS-CoV-2 existed as a human

244

pathogen. However, we did study ligands (R848 and CpG-A) to the endosomal expressed TLRs 7/8/9,

245

which are clearly engaged by positive strand RNA viruses such SARS-CoV-2, which require endosomal

246

processing as part of viral entry into cells(32). Furthermore, consistency of findings across all viral stimuli

247

and responses suggests that our findings should apply to all respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2.

248

We were not able to assess the importance of induction of the type III IFNs, IFN-λs 1-3, which are very

249

important in innate antiviral responses against respiratory viruses(31, 33-35), as the type III IFNs were not

250

significantly induced by any infection/stimulus in the PBMCs that we studied (data available on request).

251

This is likely because respiratory epithelial cells are the main source of type III IFNs, and the cells within

252

PBMCs that are capable of producing type III IFNs when studied fresh(35) likely succumbed as a result of

253

freeze/thawing.

254

Our findings have important therapeutic implications. IFN-α and IFN-β have both been shown to inhibit

255

replication of SARS-CoV-2(36, 37). A very recent report indicates that early subcutaneous IFN-β

256

administered up to three times weekly (with ribavirin) in the first seven days after diagnosis of COVID-19

257

was associated with faster virus clearance and clinical improvement and with shorter hospital stays(38). It

258

is likely that most of this clinical benefit resulted from IFN-β rather than ribavirin(39), but ongoing clinical

259

trials (more than 20 trials investigating IFN-α or IFN-β in COVID-19 are currently registered on clinical trial

260

registries) will determine whether and to what degree type I IFN therapies are effective.

261

Since IFN production by virus-infected respiratory cells is likely critical to innate anti-viral immunity against

262

SARS-CoV, therapeutic use of agents that boost innate IFN induction by virus infections may be

263

efficacious in treatment of COVID-19. We reported 10 years ago that azithromycin doubles IFN-β and

264

IFN-λ production from virus-infected human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro(40). Erythromycin and

265

telithromycin did not(40). Innate IFN-induction by azithromycin in virus-infected human lung cells has

266

been confirmed in three subsequent studies(41-43), one of which confirmed this property was variable

267

among 225 novel macrolides studied, as some macrolides induced innate IFNs (up to ~5-fold), while

268

others did not(43). Thus this innate IFN-inducing property is not a property of all macrolides, but is

269

reproducibly a property of azithromycin(40-43). This is supported by a recent report that among 1,520

270

clinically approved compounds from a chemical library screened for anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-

271

2, only two had clear dose-responsive replication-inhibition curves with identified EC50 concentrations in

272

the 1-10μM range. These two compounds were azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, and they also had

273

EC90 concentrations of ~10μM and ~15μM respectively, with azithromycin achieving ~100% inhibition of

274

SARS-CoV-2 replication at ~15μM(44). Azithromycin treatment of COVID-19 patients (especially early in

275

the disease course when patients progress from mild to moderate disease severity) in order to boost IFN

276

production by respiratory epithelial cells when infected with SARS-CoV-2, may therefore be effective,

277

especially in males who demonstrably have deficient innate IFN responses when compared to females.

278

This deduction is indirectly supported by high-quality randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical

279

trial evidence that azithromycin is effective in preventing progression to severe lower respiratory tract

280

illnesses (which are initiated by viral infections) in preschool children(45) and in prevention of asthma

281

exacerbations (the great majority of which are caused by respiratory viruses) in uncontrolled

282

moderate/severe asthma(46). Ongoing studies (more than 50 clinical trials investigating azithromycin in

283

COVID-19 are currently on trial registries) will determine the effectiveness of azithromycin, and we would

284

suggest that post-hoc analyses include stratification by sex.

285

Our findings have important implications for prevention strategies, which are best implemented when

286

high-risk populations can be identified. Respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, are initially

287

encountered by the nasal epithelium where infection is initiated. An adequate anti-viral response can

288

contain the virus in the upper airway, with cold-like symptoms, and a diminished response can see the

289

infection spreading to the lower airways to induce severe LRTI. Our data support a preventive strategy,

290

particularly among males, which involves targeting the innate immune system with ‘immune training’

291

agents to boost resistance to primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 and enhance the capacity to control the

292

intensity of airways’ inflammatory responses (such as, for example, OM-85(47), which has been shown to

293

effectively and safely reduce winter hospitalizations in COPD(48), severe bronchitis among residents in

294

care-homes for elderly(49), and LRTIs in children(50)). Effective prophylactic therapy will be crucially

295

important while we wait for a vaccine.

296

Our findings also have important implications for a hotly debated topic, namely whether “man flu” actually

297

exists or not(51). Here we provide a biological basis to explain why males would be expected to suffer

298

more than females when infected by respiratory viruses.

299

In conclusion, high morbidity and mortality from respiratory viruses including COVID-19 in males is likely

300

explained by impaired innate anti-viral immune in males compared to females. Males may preferentially

Materials and Methods

304

Detailed methods are presented in the Supplementary Appendix.

305

Study design, setting, participants and data sources

306

The study subjects were participants in the Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study, a population-based

307

birth cohort study(52). The study was approved by the research ethics committee; we obtained written

308

informed consent. PBMCs were collected from subjects at age 16 years and cryopreserved. We used

309

male or female sex as assigned at birth.

310

Cell stimulations and cytokine measurement

311

The PBMCs were thawed on the day of stimulation, counted and had viability checked as described(53,

312

54). Cells were distributed in 96-well round bottom plates at 2*105 cells/well and were stimulated with two

313

rhinoviruses (RVs), RV-A16 and RV-A1, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We also used two viral

314

mimics (which mimic infection with SARS-CoV-2), the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7/8 ligand resiquimod

315

(R848) and the TLR-9 ligand class A CpG oligonucleotide (CpG-A), both at 1µM concentrations

316

(Invivogen). Concentrations of IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ and four IFN-induced chemokines CXCL10/IP-10,

317

CCL2/MCP1, CCL4/MIP-1β and CCL13/MCP4 were measured in supernatants 24h post-stimulation,

318

using the Meso Scale Discovery® kits as previously described(53, 54).

319

Clinical outcomes: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)

320

We extracted data on severe LRTIs requiring hospital admissions in the first and second year of life from

321

electronic and paper-based primary care medical records; age in days at the time of each event was

322

documented to provide an accurate account of each episode(54).

323

Statistical analysis

324

Quality control: Prior to analyses, data were pre-processed according to the pipeline described in our

325

previous study(53), to exclude samples with low viability and/or no response of any cytokine to any stimulus.

326

Analysis: We expressed the induction of IFNs and IFN-induced chemokines as raw values (in pg/mL) and

327

fold-induction over medium controls. The data were summarised as median and interquartile range (IQR).

328

Univariate comparisons between groups were performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (2-tailed).

329

Benjamini-Hochberg correction was applied to account for multiple testing(55). Proportions of males and

330

females with IFN responses to viral stimuli below the 15th, 20th and 25th percentiles of the entire

331

population were compared using chi-squared tests. Associations with P<0.05 were considered significant.
