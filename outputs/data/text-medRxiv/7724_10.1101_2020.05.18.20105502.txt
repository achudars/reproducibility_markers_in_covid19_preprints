Major findings
During COVID-19, pulmonary blood vessel dilatation induces a severe intrapulmonary oxygen
shunt. Almitrine iv infusion was associated with a rapid and significant improvement of PaO2 in
mechanically ventilated patients during both prone or supine positioning.

Abstract: In severe COVID-19 pulmonary failure, hypoxia is mainly related to pulmonary
vasodilation with altered hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). Besides prone positioning,
other non-ventilatory strategies may reduce the intrapulmonary shunt. This study has investigated
almitrine, a pharmacological option to improve oxygenation.
Patients and Method. A case control series of 17 confirmed COVID-19 mechanically
ventilated patients in prone or supine positioning was collected: 10 patients received two doses of
almitrine (4 and 12 mcg/kg/min) at 30-45 min interval each, and were compared to 7 “control”
COVID-matched patients conventionally treated. The end-point was the reduction of intrapulmonary shunt increasing the PaO2 and ScvO2.
Results Patients were male (59%) with median (25th, 75th percentiles) age of 70 (54-78)
years and a BMI of 29 (23-34). At stable mechanical ventilatory settings, PaO2 (mmHg) at FiO2 1
(135 (85, 195) to 214 (121, 275); p = 0.06) tended to increase with almitrine. This difference was
significant when the best PaO2 between the 2 doses was used : 215 (123,294) vs baseline (p =
0.01). A concomitant increase in ScvO2 occurred ((73 (72, 76) to 82 (80, 87); p = 0.02). Eight over
10 almitrine-treated patients increased their PaO2, with no clear dose-effect. During the same
time, the controls did not change PaO2.
In conclusion, in early COVID-19 with severe hypoxemia, almitrine infusion is associated
with improved oxygenation in prone or supine positioning. This pharmacological intervention
may offer an alternative and/or an additional effect to proning and might delay or avoid more
demanding modalities such as ECMO.

Introduction
The clinical presentation of COVID-19 disease is heterogenous, ranging from no symptoms
to severe acute respiratory failure (ARF), which may have a poor prognosis. (1, 2) The lung
contamination by SARS- CoV-2 is typically characterized by a major difficulty to oxygenate the
arterial blood. (3) This severe hypoxemia is associated with preserved respiratory mechanical
properties, in particular the pulmonary system compliance. As recently quoted by Gattinoni et
al(4), the COVID-19 pneumonia seems to have 2 different phenotypes: the early phase, with
severe hypoxemia and close to normal respiratory mechanics with a moderate effect of PEEP on
lung recruitment; the later phase, corresponding to the more “classic” ARDS alteration of
respiratory mechanics such as a reduced compliance with chest CT Scan images of diffuse
ground-glass opacities and condensations. The hypoxia during the early phase seems to mainly
result from an important ventilation/perfusion (VA/Q) mismatch(5) associated with an altered
pulmonary vasoconstriction. The “protective” mechanism called hypoxic pulmonary
vasoconstriction (HPV) normally reduces the blood flow in poorly or non-ventilated areas
towards aerated zones leading to reduce the (VA/Q) mismatch. HPV seems poorly functional in
COVID-19 severe patients in absence of “cor pulmonale”.(2)
Most of the publications on severe COVID-19 describe intubated and mechanically
ventilated patients, installed in prone positioning as an adjuvant therapy to limit hypoxia. The
prone positioning in ARDS is supposed to facilitate alveolar recruitment, and to decrease the
heterogeneity of compliance.(6) In theory, this modality should have a limited effect during the
COVID-19 early phase. The recent publications demonstrated that the majority of patients
improved PaO2 after prone positioning,(7) which suggests another mechanism to improve PaO2.

The most probable was a pulmonary blood flow redistribution towards the ventilated areas by
gravitational forces. This modality creates a huge work load to the care team, and increases the
risk of endotracheal tube obstruction and malposition, and pressure sores on face and chest.(6)
In the 90s’, other non-ventilatory strategies have been reported including inhaled nitric
oxide(8), almitrine bismesylate (9, 10) or a combination of both.(11) According to the French
National agency for Drug Security (ANSM), only iv almitrine was indicated for hypoxic acute
respiratory failure as Drug of Major Therapeutic Interest. The brutal COVID-19 outbreak with
many severe hypoxic patients prompted intensivists to test iv almitrine to improve HPV(12, 13)
and to reduce the intrapulmonary shunt. The use of ECMO is limited to trained centres, which
could not meet COVID-19-related demands. We hypothesized that almitrine might restore even
partially a HPV response, both in supine or prone positioning.
We investigated 10 COVID-19 patients mechanically ventilated at FiO2 1 with a severe
intrapulmonary shunt during their early phase. The emergency conditions and the acute high
inflow of patients to ICU impeded the design of a randomized control trial. To eliminate the
eventuality of a spontaneous evolution of hypoxia, these patients were compared with 7 controlmatched COVID-19 patients treated conventionally.

Patients and measurements
The Research Program database of the Departement d’Anesthésie- Reanimation Brabois
Adulte was submitted to the “Direction de la Recherche et Innovation (ref 2020PI080)”, and was
agreed by the research Ethical Committee (Saisine 263) of Centre Hospitalier Régional
Universitaire (CHRU) de Nancy, France. The relatives or patients were questioned about

objections to use almitrine and collected data for scientific purposes and/or potential publications
or not. The statement including also the opposition forms was dated and recorded in medical file.
The study was retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.govafter enrolment (NCT04380727,
Principal Investigator: Marie-Reine LOSSER, M.D., Ph.D., May 7, 2020,
Between March16 and April 12, 2020, COVID-19 patients referred to ICU were screened to
receive iv almitrine using the following criteria: a positive RT- PCR, a highly suggestive thoracic
CTScan, and a severe hypoxemia leading to intubation for less than 3 days. The exclusion criteria
were: the presence of an acute cor pulmonale on the trans-thoracic 2D Echo-Doppler(14) and
abnormal liver function tests or hyperlactatemia.(15) Ten successive patients were studied
according to the following protocol: baseline measurement in prone or supine positioning; second
measurement 30 to 45 min after 4 mcg/kg/min iv almitrine bismesylate (Vectarion®, Servier
Laboratory, Neuilly, France), and a third measurement 30-45 min after 12 mcg/kg/min infusion
rate.(16) Because of a shortage of drug store at national level, a protocol using continuous
infusion was not considered.
The recorded parameters were: the ventilatory settings unchanged along the protocol,
including FiO2, PEEP level, tidal volume (VT), peak inspiratory pressure, plateau pressure;
haemoglobin concentration, blood gases simultaneously sampled on the arterial catheter and on
the central catheter to assess central venous oxygen saturation ScvO2, and arterial lactate, right
atrial pressure; cardiac output when possible (Mostcare®, Vygon, Ecouen, France). Similar data
were collected on a matched control group of COVID-19 patients, matched on gender, age, BMI
and duration of mechanical ventilation, with serial measurements corresponding to the duration
of almitrine testing. Data were reported according to the Strobe Statement for case control
studies.(17)

Statistical analysis
Data were reported as median (25th-75th percentiles) for continuous variables and as count
(percentage) for categorical variables. Change in blood gases parameters during almitrine
infusion were first assessed using a Friedman test followed by a pairwise Wilcoxon signed-ranks
post-hoc test with Bonferroni correction when appropriate. Second, to perform a two-points
comparison (i.e. baseline and after almitrine infusion) with the control group (baseline and H8
measurement), we only considered the best variation in term of PaO2 regardless of the infusion
dose of almitrine (4 or 12 mcg/kg/min). In the two groups, difference between before (baseline)
and after (almitrine infusion or H8) measurement was assessed using a Wilcoxon signed-ranks
test. All tests were 2-sided and a p value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.6.0 for Mac OS (The R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Results
All patients had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (positive PCR testing). The median age
was 70 (54-78) years, with 10/17 males, having a median BMI of 29 (23-34). Haemoglobin was
stable at 12.2 (8.9-13.8) g/dL. Most of the patients were intubated just before or soon after ICU
admission. Patients from both groups had co-morbidities, mostly metabolic and/or cardiovascular
diseases under chronic treatment (Table 1). At the time of manuscript submission, in almitrine
group 2 patients died and 6 patients were extubated and discharged from the ICU, the remaining
being still mechanically ventilated. In the control group, 2 died and 5 were extubated and
discharged from the ICU.

Table 2 shows the hemodynamic, gas exchange and mechanical ventilation parameters from
baseline, 4 and 12 mcg/kg/min of almitrine infusion. PaO2 tended to increase (p = 0.06) with a
significant increase in ScvO2 (p =0.03). All other parameters did not change during the protocol.
The changes in PaO2 did not parallel the increasing doses of almitrine (data not shown). In the
control COVID group, none of the collected parameters changed after 8hrs (Supplementary table
S1). The whiskers box plot of Figure 1 shows the median PaO2/FiO2 for almitrine and control
groups. The best response in PaO2 increase starting from baseline was found significant only in
the almitrine-treated group (p = 0.01), while it remained stable in controls. Figure 2 shows the
individual data for both PaO2 and ScvO2 in both groups, which significantly increased only in the
almitrine group. Eight over 10 patients increased their PaO2 with almitrine, with no clear relation
with the level of infusion rate. Of note, when the drug was available to continue, the increase in
PaO2 associated with almitrine infusion persisted (3 patients), which permitted to reduce the
number of positioning changes. During this short perfusion time no hemodynamic side effects
were observed and lactate remained stable (<1.5 mmol/L) (data not shown).

Discussion
Intravenous almitrine was associated with almost a doubling of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio in the
early phase of severe COVID-19 ARDS with no clear dose-effect relation. SvcO2 increased
consistently, while neither Pra nor CI was altered. The individual responses related to almitrine
infusion varied in amplitude between patients (fig2A), but 8 over 10 patients responded in term
of PaO2 with an average of 80mmHg increase from baseline to the most efficient dose of
almitrine.
In our experience, the patients admitted in ICU with a PaO2/FiO2 lower than 100 mmHg
required a rescue intubation and mechanical ventilation at FIO2 close to 1. Standard ventilatory
settings were used as previously reported in COVID-19(3), including moderate PEEP with a VT
close to 6 ml/kg IBW. Among the non-ventilatory method to improve oxygenation, the prone
positioning is leading with frequent and rapid increase in PaO2/FiO2.(6) As recently stated by
ATS(6), prone positioning improves oxygenation mainly through respiratory mechanics
improvement, limiting the heterogeneity of the gas volume partition. The apparent benefit of
prone positioning on PaO2 in “early” COVID-19 with almost normal respiratory mechanics(18)
strongly suggests that prone positioning improves hypoxia and reduces the intra-pulmonary
VA/Q mismatch by another mechanism.
The absence of cor pulmonale despite severe ARF in COVID-19 indicates a relative
dilatation of the pulmonary vascular bed with a “normal” pulmonary blood flow.(19) The logical
hypothesis was that the prone positioning is changing the partition of pulmonary blood flow
towards better ventilated areas by gravitation. The severe VA/Q mismatch in COVID-19
associated with pulmonary vasodilation indicates an alteration in HPV.(5) Years ago, we and

others have shown that almitrine may spectacularly improve PaO2 by reducing the intrapulmonary oxygen shunt.(5, 13) In the present pilot study, almitrine was used as a test to restore,
even though partially, the HPV in supine or prone positioning (Fig 2B). The combination of these
conditions (prone and almitrine) could then be seen as a combination of gravitational and
pharmacological effects to improve the oxygen VA/Q mismatch. The observed increase in P/F
ratio in 80% of the patients confirmed this approach. The small cohort of patients does not allow
concluding about any additional effect of these therapies. Worthy of note, in 3 patients the repositioning from prone to supine under almitrine prevented the loss of the benefit of prone
positioning on PaO2 values. The observed results with almitrine would not be related to the
spontaneous evolution of the patients as suggested by the stable PaO2 in the control COVID-19.
The PaO2 increase associated with almitrine infusion was concomitant with a significant
increase in ScvO2. This observation confirms the absence of tissue hypoperfusion with no large
peripheral O2 extraction, as suggested by the low lactate levels. This ScvO2 increase provides a
greater reserve for O2 extraction in case of acute desaturation, and increased the level of dissolved
O2, the diffusible form of oxygen to the tissues.(20)
This case control series has several limitations in addition to the small size cohort (17
patients). First, although the “control” COVID-19 patients were selected on stringent criteria to
match the studied group, it was not randomized and could be biased. The stability in PaO2 during
8 hours reinforced the credence in an almitrine effect. In absence of a drug shortage, all of these
patients would have received almitrine. This shortage resulted from the small national stock of
almitrine facing an important demand during the pandemic. Second, although the data were
prospectively collected, the overwhelmed care team capabilities in a dramatic context explains
why some data were missing. Third, for the same reason, we were not able to administer the drug

for a longer period than 36 to 48 hours for few patients. This precludes any conclusion about the
potential benefit on mechanical ventilation duration and on the number of prone positioning.
Following the same line of thinking, the almitrine test on arterial oxygenation cannot be proposed
as either a prognostic test or a predicator of the prone position response.
In conclusion, in a case series of early hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia with acute
respiratory failure, iv almitrine was associated with an improvement in arterial blood oxygenation
both in prone or supine positioning in most of the patients, suggesting a partial recovery of the
pulmonary vessels’ contractility. This pharmacological intervention may offer an alternative
and/or an additional strategy to the prone positioning in severe COVID-19 ARDS. It may help to
support the lung function when ECMO possibilities are very limited.

Figure 1: Boxplot representation of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio change in the almitrine group and in the control
group between baseline and after treatment measurements (best dose response for patients treated with
almitrine and 8-hours after baseline for matched control patients).
Tukey boxplots show median with 25th and 75th percentiles (lower and upper hinges). Whiskers extend from the
correspondent hinge to the largest or smaller value not further than 1.5*interquartile range. Isolated points
represent the outlier values.

Figure 2: Individual change of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (A) and the ScvO2 (B) between baseline and post
almitrine administration (best dose response in term of PaO2/FiO2 ratio) in the almitrine group of patients
(n=10). Individual change of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (C) in the matched-control group (n=7) between baseline
and H8.
ScvO2 measurements were not available for the control group.
Shape of the individual point corresponds to the position of the patients (circle: prone positioning; triangle: supine
positioning).
Tukey boxplots on the background show correspondent median with 25th and 75th percentiles (lower and upper
hinges). Whiskers extend from the correspondent hinge to the largest or smaller value not further than
1.5*interquartile range.
