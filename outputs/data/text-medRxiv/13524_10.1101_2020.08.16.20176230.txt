Abstract
Background: We aimed to compare the pre, lockdown, and post-lockdown aeromedical retrieval
(AR) diagnostic reasons and patient demographics during a period of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)
social isolation.
Methods: An observational study with retrospective data collection, consisting of Australians who
received an AR between 26 January and 23 June 2020. The main outcome measures were patient
diagnostic category proportions and trends prior (28 January to 15 March), during (16 March to 4
May), and following (5 May to 23 June 2020) social isolation restrictions.
Results: There were 16981 ARs consisting of 1959 (11.5) primary evacuations (PEs) and 12724
(88.5) inter-hospital transfers (IHTs), with a population median age of 52 years (interquartile range
[IQR] 29.0–69.0), with 49.0% (n= 8283) of the cohort being male and 38.0% (n= 6399) being female.
There were a total of six confirmed and 209 suspected cases of COVID-19, with the majority of cases
(n=114; 53.0%) in the social isolation period. As compared to pre-restriction, the odds of retrieval for
the restriction and post-restriction period differed across time between the major diagnostic groups.
This included, an increase in cardiovascular retrieval for both restriction and post-restriction periods
(OR 1.12 95% CI 1.02-1.24 and OR 1.18 95% CI 1.08-1.30 respectively), increases in neoplasm in
the post restriction period (OR 1.31 95% CI 1.04-1.64), and increases for congenital conditions in the
restriction period (OR 2.56 95% CI 1.39-4.71). Cardiovascular and congenital conditions had
increased rates of priority 1 patients in the restriction and post restriction periods. There was a
decrease in endocrine and metabolic disease retrievals in the restriction period (OR 0.72 95% CI 0.530.98). There were lower odds during the post-restriction period for a retrievals of the respiratory
system (OR 0.78 95% CI 0.67-0.93), and disease of the skin (OR 0.78 95% CI 0.6-1.0). Distribution
between the 2019 and 2020 time periods differed (p<0.05), with the lockdown period resulting in a
significant reduction in activity.
Conclusion: The lockdown period resulted in increased AR rates of circulatory and congenital
conditions. However, this period also resulted in a reduction of overall activity, possibly due to a
reduction in other infectious disease rates, such as influenza, due to social distancing.

What is already known on this subject: We know the rates of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) have an impact
on a range of health services globally, however we do not have a clear understanding of the aeromedical
retrieval reasons during a period of sustained social isolation.
What this study adds: While there were fewer aeromedical retrievals during the social isolation period there
were relatively more retrievals for cardiovascular disease and congenital malformations of the circulatory
system. However, post-restriction demonstrated reductions in respiratory disease and skin infections, as
compared to the pre-restriction period. Many aeromedical retrievals come from areas with higher chronic
disease rates. If these areas have community transmission of COVID-19, it is likely that retrievals will increase
for severe COVID-19 patients, with associated comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
originated in Wuhan China, and spread globally affecting millions of people. The major
symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) include fever, cough, muscular soreness, and
dyspnea,1 with most deaths occurring in older patients with at least one comorbidity.2 The
current median reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 is estimated by the World Health
Organisation (WHO) to be 1.95, however recent studies indicate it could be closer to 2.79.3
The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11 2020.4
COVID-19 rapidly spread throughout the world, with 118 319 cases reported on March 11
rising to more than 17 million by the end of July 2020.5 The rapid spread of COVID-19 led
many countries to close their borders to international travel and impose social distancing and
lockdown isolation measures, aimed at reducing or minimising community transmition.4

Lockdown measures differed slightly between geographic areas throughout Australia,
however generally included: closures of non-essential business, working from home,
national/state border closures, interpersonal social distancing, curfews, limitations on outdoor
activities, school closures, personal hygiene measures, and recommendations associated with
the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Fines were issued for any major breaches.

The public health measures associated with controlling the virus, led to widespread economic
disruptions,6 and potentially positive environmental impacts,7,8 such as reduced carbon
emissions due to reduced travel. The global lockdown has also affected population health in
other ways, such as reduced influenza transmission,9 reduced accidents and injuries,10 and
potentially reduced preterm labour.11 Many of these reports are anecdotal observations,
however it is likely that changes in the work environments, social interactions, and a focus of
improved hand hygiene, has reduced overall exposure to other non-COVID infectious
diseases.

To date there has been little research that considers whether nationwide lockdowns contribute
to changes in patient diagnostic reasons, including those who require emergency aeromedical
retrieval.

We aimed to investigate:

whether the COVID-19 social lockdown/restriction was associated with differences in
the rates and diagnostic reasons for people requiring aeromedical retrieval throughout
Australia.

-

whether the diagnostic proportions during the COVID-19 social lockdown/restriction
period differed to patient diagnostic proportions seen in 2019.

Methods
Setting
During the COVID-19 pandemic the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) was tasked with
transferring confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients throughout Australia, in addition to
its normal activity of 30,000-35,000 aeromedical transfers per year.12 Australian spans 7.69
million square kilometres, with the majority of the 2018 Australian population (n=
24,992,860) residing in major cities (n = 18,003,544; 72.0%) or inner-regional areas (n =
4,445,356; 17.8%), with the remainder living in outer-regional (n = 2,052,366; 8.2%), remote
(n = 291,213; 1.2%), and very remote (n = 200,381; 0.1%) areas.13 With a fleet of 74 aircraft
the RFDS provides extensive aeromedical retrieval for patients requiring treatment in innerregional or major city hospitals.14

Study Design
We conducted an observational study with retrospective data collection to investigate the
diagnostic reasons patients were accessing aeromedical services throughout Australia. This
analysis included all aeromedical retrievals conducted by the RFDS from 26 January to 23
June 2020. To determine whether this pandemic period differed to the same period in 2019,
we included data from 26 January to 23 June 2019 to allow comparison.

An aeromedical retrieval was classified into two main categories, including primary
evacuation (PE) (also known as primary retrieval) and inter-hospital transfer (IHT) (also
known as a secondary retrieval). All repatriations were excluded from the analysis. A PE is
generally staffed by a medical doctor and a nurse, while an IHT can only include a nurse or a
medical doctor depending on the patient’s severity.

Measures
Basic demographic information on age and gender was collected during the aeromedical
retrieval. Aeromedical retrieval in-flight diagnoses were retrospectively coded to the

International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th
Revision (ICD-10).15 During the aeromedical retrieval patients were categorised into priority
categories from 1 to 3, with priority 1 being the most urgent.

To investigate the association between the time and differences in the rates and diagnostic
reasons for people requiring aeromedical retrieval throughout Australia, each patient
interaction was allocated to either pre-restriction, restriction/lockdown, and post-restriction
time period depending on the date they received treatment in 2020. All three periods were
chosen to last for 7-weeks and were defined as follows: pre-restriction chosen as the baseline
period (28 January to 15 March); restriction from the time that Australia went into lockdown
(16 March to 4 May) and post-restriction where restrictions were gradually eased (5 May to
23 June).

The outcome measures included the number of patients across the three study periods (each
7-weeks duration), the proportions and percentages for the ICD-10 diagnoses and patient
demographics, across the three periods studied.

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were summarised as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs).
Categorical variables were summarised as counts and proportions. The association between
the time period and the likelihood of requiring aeromedical retrieval due to a specific
diagnostic reason in 2020 was investigated using logistic regression with magnitudes of
association reported as odds ratios (ORs) with respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs)
using pre-restriction period as a reference category. No p-values for individual diagnostic
categories are reported due to the number of categories investigated. 95% CIs that do not
include 1 are indicative of statistical significance at two-sided threshold of 0.05. The
frequency distribution of the air ambulance retrievals across the three studies were compared
between 2019 and 2020, using Chi-square test. Statistical analyses were performed using
Stata 15IC statistical software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) with graphs
implemented in the statistical software package R version 3.5.1.

Ethics approval
This project was deemed a low-risk quality assurance project. As this project involved
routinely collected data, specific patient consent forms were not required.

Patient and Public Involvement
This study was developed and informed by patient priorities. The RFDS is an essential
service, with the RFDS being the only healthcare service provider in many areas. This
research is broadly aimed at understanding patient trends to promote and provide evidencebased services to the Australian public. RFDS stakeholders, including patients, will receive
study results through various formats, including social media, newsletters, and via
community engagement. Social engagement will also be used to determine community needs
associated with COVID-19 lockdowns, especially with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
(Indigenous) communities. This will help to ensure our pandemic responses are culturally
appropriate.

Results
There were 16981 aeromedical retrievals throughout the 2020 study period including 1959
(11.5%) PEs, and 15022 IHTs (88.5%), as compared to 18125 retrievals consisting of 2337
(12.9%) PEs and 15788 (87.1%) IHTs during the same date range in the year 2019.

The 2019 activity consistently increased across the 3 time periods from 5793 (32.0%), 6140
(33.9%), to 6192 (34.2%). However, in the pandemic study period there were observed
differences in the distribution, in terms of the number of retrievals, with 5927 (34.9%), 5121
(30.2%), and 5933 (34.9%), prior, during, and following social isolation restrictions,
respectively. The 2020 pandemic period resulted in a reduction in overall activity, as
compared to the same time period in 2019. Historical trends were expected to increase with
the Australian winter months (June, July, August), however the lockdown period resulted in a
reduction in activity as compared to the same timeframe in the prior year (see Figure 2).

The median population age of patients that underwent an aeromedical retrieval by the RFDS
during the 2020 pandemic study period was 52 years (interquartile range [IQR] 29.0–69.0).
There were 8283 (49.0%) males, 6399 (38.0%) females, and 2299 (13.5%) missing gender,
with the male median age being 55 (IQR:55-70) and the female median age being 47 (IQR:
26-67) years, with the female median age reflecting retrievals that were related to pregnancy
(n=639; 3.8%).

The leading retrieval reasons throughout the study period included diseases of the circulatory
system (n=3082; 18.15%), injury (n=2768; 16.3%), and diseases of the digestive system (n=
1535; 9.0%). There were significantly lower numbers of aeromedical retrievals performed
during the period of social isolation (n= 5121; p<0.05), compared to the pre-isolation period
(n=5927). See Table 1 for diagnostic trends.

There were six confirmed and 209 aeromedical COVID-19 cases, with the majority (n= 114;
53.0%) conducted during the social isolation period. It should be noted, that all the areas that
these patients came from did not pathology testing services. As such all suspected cases were
treated as confirmed cases.

Cardiovascular retrievals decreased in overall number during lockdown (n=945; 18.45%)
however started to increase in number during the post-lockdown period (n=1143;19.3%).
Compared to the pre- restriction period there was an increase in odds of cardiovascular
retrievals during the lockdown and post-restriction periods (OR 1.12 95% CI 1.02-1.24 and
OR 1.18 95% CI 1.08-1.30 respectively), indicating a relative increase compared to other
reasons for retrievals. The most common diagnosis in this group was ischaemic heart disease
(n=1506; 8.9%). The restriction (n=113; 29.4%) and post-restriction (n=132; 28.6%) periods
also had higher rates of cardiovascular priority 1 patients, as compared to the pre-restriction
period (n= 110; 23.6%).

There was a decrease in number of retrievals for respiratory diseases during restriction and an
increase in number during the post-restriction period. There were significantly lower odds of
retrieval for respiratory diseases in the post-restriction period compared to pre-restriction,
indicating a relative decrease of respiratory system retrievals compared to other reasons (OR
0.78 95% CI 0.67-0.93). The restriction (n=21; 5.5%) period had lower rates, while the postrestriction period had higher rates (n=31; 6.7%) of respiratory priority 1 patients, as
compared to the pre-restriction period (n= 30; 6.4%).

The number of retrievals for diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue were in the
restriction period compared to the pre-restriction period, however in the post restriction
period the number was higher than in the two prior periods as were the odds of retrieval (OR
0.78 95% CI 0.62-0.98) indicating a relative increase of retrievals in the post-restriction
period. The number of retrievals for neoplasm were similar in the restriction period compared

to the pre-restriction period, however in the post restriction period the number was higher
than in the two prior periods as were the odds of retrieval (OR 1.31 95% CI 1.04-1.64)
indicating a relative increase of neoplasm retrievals in the post-restriction period.

There were lower number of retrievals both in the restriction and the post-restriction period
for the endocrine and metabolic diagnostic groups. The odds of retrieval for this diagnostic
group in the restriction period was significantly lower than the odds in the pre-restriction
period (OR 0.72 95% CI 0.53-0.98), indicating relatively less retrievals for this diagnosis in
the restriction period compared to the pre-restriction period.

The number of retrievals for congenital conditions diagnosis was low across the three
periods, however higher in the restriction and post-restriction period than in the prerestriction period. The odds of retrievals for congenital conditions during the restriction
period were significantly higher than in the pre-restriction period (OR 2.56 95% CI 1.394.71). The restriction (n=6; 1.6%) and post-restriction (n=3; 0.7%) period also had slightly
higher rates of congenital priority 1 patients, as compared to the pre-restriction period (n= 2;
0.4%).

Discussion
As an essential service, the RFDS provides emergency aeromedical support throughout
Australia, as reflected in recent COVID-19 activity reports.16 The main findings from this
paper indicated that there were relatively more retrievals for diseases of the circulatory
system, and congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities, during
the social isolation period compared to the pre-isolation period. During the post-isolation
period there was an increase in number of retrievals for diseases of the circulatory system and
for neoplasms, however a reduction for respiratory disease, and skin conditions. The
increases of cardiovascular and neoplasm treatment during this period may indicate a rebound
effect in patients subsequently seeking treatment following social isolation. Furthermore, the
decrease in respiratory and skin infections during the post-lockdown period may indicated
that social distancing is also influencing other disease transmission rates, such as influenza.

Many of the retrievals for the circulatory system were for ischaemic heart disease, such as
acute myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. It is unclear why there were relatively less
circulatory cases however a higher proportion during the lockdown period. This may reflect

patients delaying early invention due to social isolation measures and limitations in accessing
primary healthcare services.17,18 This appeared to be the case, as there were more circulatory
system cases during the post-lockdown period.

Cardiovascular disease, older adults, those with respiratory disease, and diabetes are at the
highest risk of complications from COVID-19 infection. While many of our patients would
not be considered old, with a median age of 52 years old, many of the retrievals were for
endocrine disease, and specifically uncontrolled diabetes. Many of these patients come from
rural and remote areas, which also have high rates of metabolic syndrome.18 Uncontrolled
diabetes, or chronic hyperglycaemia, negatively affects the immune system increasing
morbidity and mortality due to increased infection risk and organic complications.19 For
example, those with Influenza A (H1N1) and diabetes, have triple the risk of hospitalization
and quadruple the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission once hospitalized.20 It is likely
that COVID-19 infection coupled with diabetes would have similar rates,20 as the mortality
rates in China indicate that 42.3% of their COVID-19 deaths had diabetes.21
A striking finding was that there were significantly more paediatric patients retrieved for
congenital malformations of the circulatory system during the lockdown period, most
requiring a IHT from a rural area to a large metropolitan hospital mainly for cardiac surgery
and congenital heart defects. This was due to limitations with accessing local cardiac
surgeons/ units. There is limited data that details the effects that COVID-19 has on the
paediatric population, due to less than 1% of hospitalised cases to date being children
younger than 10 years old.22 While children seem less vulnerable to severe COVID-19,23
those with congenital malformations are likely to have worse COVID-19 outcomes.23

During the lockdown period there were less aeromedical PE and IHT transfers for cancer,
increasing significantly post-lockdown. This trend is believed to be related to many
oncologists within Australia only conducting essential treatments. The lockdown period
provided many challenges associated with cancer patient safety, specifically that patients
would need to leave their homes and thus would expose themselves to infection.24 Cancer
treatment in itself predisposes patients to the more serious effects of COVID-19. For
example, a recent study found that patients with cancer are at a greater risk of death and/or
intensive care unit admission (OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.8–16.2).25 Oncologists were required to
weigh the risks of death and morbidity from COVID-19 against the benefits of cancer

therapy. This risk is arguably amplified during aeromedical retrieval and transferring patients
hundreds of kilometres from their homes into inner-regional and major city areas. The risks
associated with transporting patients for cancer treatment are believed to be the main driver
for a reduction in transfers during the lockdown period.

It was found that the retrievals for diseases of the respiratory system started to decline during
the isolation period, and significantly reduced in the post-isolation period. This was mainly
driven by reductions in acute respiratory disease retrievals. While influenza retrieval rates did
not appear to reduce, reductions in overall respiratory disease match findings that social
distancing for COVID-19 is reducing other respiratory disease transmission rates. For
example, the Australian rates of confirmed influenza has significantly reduced since
increased hygiene and social isolation measures have been in place, as compared to the
winter months of 2019.9 However, this trend could also be a result of a strong influenza
vaccination campaign operated by the Australian Government during the early isolation
periods. As per respiratory disease, skin infection retrieval rates started to decrease during the
lockdown period, and significantly reduced in the post-lockdown period. As observed within
Australia and internationally, non-pharmaceutical interventions, including border restrictions,
quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour, not only reduce
COVID-19 transmission but also led to reductions in other diseases.26
The vast majority of aeromedical retrievals come from rural and remote areas of Australia.13
These areas are characterised as having healthcare workforce shortages, coupled with higher
social and economic disadvantage and higher rates of chronic disease, including
cardiovascular and respiratory disease.27 A potential contributor to the higher relative rates of
retrievals for cardiovascular disease could be associated with limitations in these population
groups able to access telehealth services, as traditional face-to-face services during the
lockdown period were limited. As many remote Australian communities have limited access
to COVID-19 testing and management facilities, coupled with higher chronic disease risk
factors, it is likely that during mass infection many of these patients will require air
ambulance transfer to inner-regional and major city hospitals.16

This study highlighted interesting trends during a period of social isolation and lockdown.
Future research should consider whether the overall numerical reductions in cardiovascular
disease were due to less clinical cases, or a result of less people seeking treatment. Attention

to the higher rates of congenital malformations of the circulatory system should also be
considered in the context of future paediatric research. Future research should also consider
social isolation trends within primary healthcare.

This study was limited to one medical service; however, this limitation was reduced by the
RFDS being the largest aeromedical service in the world, providing services to the whole of
the Australian continent during the study period. This study did not include primary
healthcare interactions prior to aeromedical retrieval, however this limitation will be
addressed in a future study.

Conclusion
Social isolation measures led to a reduction in overall aeromedical activity, however
increased significantly once the restrictions were lifted. During the social isolation period
there were relatively more retrievals for cardiovascular disease, such as ischaemic heart
disease, and congenital malformations of the circulatory system compared to pre-restriction.
These population groups if infected with COVID-19 have significantly worse outcomes, and
should be considered a high risk population group. Many of the Australian aeromedical
retrievals come from rural and remote areas, characterised by vast geographical distances,
often with significantly lower healthcare provision. If these community areas have
community transmission of COVID-19, it is likely that aeromedical retrievals will increase
for severe COVID-19 patients, with associated comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease.
