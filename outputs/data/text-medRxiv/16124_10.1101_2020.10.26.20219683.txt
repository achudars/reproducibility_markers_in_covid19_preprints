Abstract
BACKGROUND: COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV2), became a pandemic in 2020 with mortality rate of 2% and high transmissibility, which
makes studies with an epidemiological profile essential. OBJECTIVES: To characterize
the population that performed the SARS-CoV-2 molecular and serological tests in Carlos
Chagas-Sabin laboratories in Cuiabá. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study
was carried out with all the samples collected from nasal swab tested by RT-PCR and
serological for SARM-CoV-2 IgM / IgG from the population served between April and
July 2020.
FINDINGS: In the analyzed period, 11,113 PCR-Covid-19 exams were registered. Of
this total of cases, 3,912 (35.20%) tested positive, while 6,889 (61.90%) did not detect
viral RNA and 312 (2.80%) of the visits resulted as undetermined. The peak of positive
RT-PCR performed in July (n = 5878), with 35.65% (n = 2096). A total of 6,392 tests
performed on SOROVID-19, with a peak of 1161 (18.16%) of the positive tests for
SARS-CoV-2 in July. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Molecular positivity and serological
tests, both peaked in July 2020, were mostly present in women aged 20-39, characterizing
Cuiabá as the epicenter of the Midwest region in this period due to the high rate of
transmissibility of SARS- CoV-2.

Introduction

COVID-19 the disease caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) became an
alarming threat to public health in 2020, despite global efforts to prevent its spread. 1
SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly, reaching more than 100 countries in five continents, forcing
the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare COVID-19 as a pandemic on March
11, 2020 2,3.
This virus has an RNA virus of the order Nidovirales of the family Coronaviridae
that can induce disease in the upper, and eventually, lower respiratory tract in vulnerable
patients, immunocompromised patients with chronic diseases, the elderly and,
sporadically, in children and young people 4. After this contact, there is an average
infection incubation period of 5 days, with an interval of up to 12 days. There are other
reports that indicate an interval of 7 to 14 days, but not very precise so far, once the viral
spreading happens directly among humans through community transmission 5. COVID19 is a new disease that deserves special attention and care because the symptoms among
infected people, from mild to severe, with mortality estimated at just over 2% 3. However,
in Várzea Grande, a city located in the Baixada Cuiabana, there was a high lethality period
(6-10%) from April to July 2020 according to the data released by the Municipal Health
Department. The State Department of Health (SES-MT) has notified, to date, 83,490 confirmed
cases in Cuiabá, Várzea Grande and thirteen more cities in Mato Grosso, that are classified as
“very high” risk for SARS-CoV-2 and with a total of 2614 deaths so far. The number of new
cases registered in the first week of August was 42% higher than the same rate in the first
week of July, classifying the state as the epicenter of COVID-19 cases.
(http://www.saude.mt.gov.br/painelcovidmt/).
The transmission of this virus occurs quickly through aerosols in patients
undergoing airway procedures, such as orotracheal intubation or airway aspiration. Direct
contact with mucous membranes (mouth, nose or eyes) contributes to the invasion and
pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, some population groups are more vulnerable to
being affected by the disease, due to general conditions, ranging from health conditions
to the way of life to which they are exposed6. Patients who meet the criteria for suspected
cases should be tested for SARS-CoV-2, using samples collected from the
nasopharyngeal mucous by the nasal swab

reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a positive SARS-CoV-2
test confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19 8.
However, if the initial test is negative, but suspected of COVID-19, WHO
recommends resampling and testing of various airway locations, as well as testing for
antibodies 9. Serological tests are used to assess the window period in the stage of current
(IgM) or chronic (IgG) infection.
The tests are based on the principle of lateral flow immunoassay for the detection
of IgG / IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in whole blood, serum and plasma of
humans, requiring quantification according to the onset of symptoms reported by the
patient to avoid false negative results10. Thus, identifying the magnitude of the health
problem in the population is the first step towards the development of effective decisionmaking strategies in evidence-based public health situations11, 12, as well as understanding
the spatial distribution of the disease is fundamental for the development of strategies
during the early stages of the COVID-19 13 emergency.
In this regard, among the clinical and laboratory repercussions of the patient
with COVID-19, this study aims to characterize the prevalence of molecular (RT-PCR)
and serological (IgM and IgG) tests for SARS-CoV-2 performed in Carlos Chagas-Sabin
laboratories in Cuiabá from April to July 2020.

Materials and methods
This is a retrospective cross-sectional study with samples from the secondary
database of Carlos Chagas Laboratory - Grupo Sabin, in Cuiabá - MT, collected between
April and July 2020. In order to verify the prevalence of molecular and serological tests
for SARS-CoV-2, all samples from people seen in the laboratory of both sexes were
included, without age restriction; and the reports of the molecular tests performed by
qPCR-RT through the extraction of the genetic material of the nasal swab virus, as well
as serological tests SOROVID-19 (IgM and IgG) for the detection of antibodies to SARSCoV-2. Rapid IgG or IgM test data were excluded from the study. Data were expressed
as absolute frequency and percentages with tabulation in Microsoft Excel.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of UNIVAG- Centro
Universitário under protocol number CAAE: 37320320.1.0000.5692. The procedures

Results
Between April and July 2020, 11,113 PCR-Covid-19 tests were registered in Carlos
Chagas-Sabin laboratories located in Cuiabá. Out of the total number of cases, 3,912
(35.20%) tested positive, while 6,889 (61.90%) did not have the disease and 312 (2.80%)
of the visits resulted in indeterminate (Table 1).

There was a predominance of cases in 6474 women (58.2%) in the 20-49-year-old
age group. Positive cases registered with a peak in July (n = 2096), totaling 5680 exams
performed in that month for COVID-19th, undetected (n = 3584) and undetermined (n =
198) (Table 3).

In April, 324 tests were registered, 10 (3.08%) of which were confirmed by
COVID-19 and 314 (96.91%) were negative for the disease. Of the total cases, 197
(60.80%) were female and 127 (39.19%) were male, individuals between 20 and 59 years

undetermined results, those ones being believed to have been performed outside the
appropriate period for the exam. Of the total cases, 3481 (59.22%) were female and 2397
(40.77%) were male, remaining the same range of individuals aged 20 to 59 being the
ones looking for the laboratories to perform the exams (Table 3).

The total of 6,392 tests performed by SOROVID19 at the Carlos Chagas-Sabin
Laboratory experienced a significant increase in the total number of tests collected per
month, subsequent to April, due to the high rate of transmission and community
circulation of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 4). In April, 202 tests were recorded, 14 (6.93%) were
confirmed for SOROVID and 188 (93.06%) were negative for the disease. Of the total
cases, 110 (54.45%) were female and 92 (45.54%) were male, individuals between 30
and 59 years of age were the ones who most performed the exams. In May, 496 tests were
recorded, 23 of which (4.63%) were confirmed for SOROVID and 473 (95.36%) were
negative for the disease. Of the total number of cases, 296 (59.67%) were female and 200
(40.32%) were male, individuals between 20 and 59 years of age were the ones who
performed the exams in that month. In June, 1,446 tests were recorded, 215 (14.86%)

Discussion

The results of the 11,113 tests performed for SARS-CoV-2 in the period from
April to July, detected 35.20% positive by the molecular test (RT-PCR) and 22.10% of
the serological tests by the SOROVID-19 test (IgG / IgM ) peaked in July 2020, being
the women the majority in the 20-39 age group. Those data demonstrate a progressive
increase in cases, associated with the high rate of transmission and community circulation
of SARS-CoV-2 in Cuiabá during the analyzed period, characterizing the month of July
as the epicenter of COVID-19 in the central west region of Brazil 14,15.
Regarding gender, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was more positive in women,
similar to the findings in another study conducted in Mato Grosso 19 and Rio de Janeiro10
which also reported the majority of cases in women (51.4%), whereas in males it was
47.7%. In contrast to our study in Wuhan province, China 20, the prevalence was higher in
men (56%) with mortality 56.5% and 38.0% of female deaths10.
According to data from the State Department of Health, Cuiabá, Várzea Grande
and 13 other cities in Mato Grosso are classified as “very high” risk for the new
coronavirus. This risk classification points to cities with more than 150 active cases on
that date, such as Sorriso with 24.81%, Barra do Garças with 19.92% and Paranatinga
with 14.83%, the other cities in the State are between 2-11 %. In Cuiabá, there are 13,958
confirmed cases with 636 deaths and the city Várzea Grande with a high mortality rate,
as there are 5,234 confirmed cases with 337 deaths and a 7% lethality rate, confirming
that the Baixada Cuiabana has a lethality rate above the national average.
According to the Epidemiological Bulletin of the State of Mato Grosso, the profile
of patients with COVID-19 is predominantly female (52%), as well as the prevalence of
deaths is also higher in women (59.3%). However, this distribution differs between the
states, as in Maranhão the predominance of deaths by COVID-19 was male (62%)16. It is
believed that women seek health services more frequently than men, and there may be
underreporting of cases in the male population, as, historically, men seek health services
less, which can lead to the worsening of the disease, late treatment and evolution to death.
Regarding the age group, there was a predominance of cases of patients between
30 and 49 years old for both tests, molecular and serological, for the detection of SARSCoV-2. Those findings are similar to the ones found in a study carried out in Maranhão

(28.4%)16 and in Wenzhou (China), which presented 58.9% of cases in that same age
group17. Likewise, individuals aged 30 to 59 years were more prevalent among the cases
studied in Rio de Janeiro10. It is worth emphasizing the need to endorse nonpharmacological measures, in order to reduce the number of people with the disease in
that age group, which characterizes the economically active population, reinforces the
adoption of assertive socioeconomic measures and preventive measures with the
epidemiological surveillance of each citizen in order to decrease the transmissibility of
SARS-CoV-2 19.
The serological tests for the detection of antibodies were mostly non-reactive,
probably due to sample collection during the immunological window period, as well as
in asymptomatic patients or those who did not report the onset period of symptoms for
SARS-CoV-2 IgM / IgG positivity as recommended by the Ministry of Health (10-12
days).
Among the limitations, despite the secondary data of this study being collected in
a locally and nationally known laboratory, the samples are representative and descriptive
only from the city of Cuiabá and region roundabout. This in fact precludes a statewide
coverage of the epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the possibility that the population
may have performed tests for SARS-CoV-2 in other laboratories available in the capital.
However, it is one of the first studies describing the cases of COVID-19 and the type of
approach carried out in Cuiabá which directly contributes to decision-making by
requiring notification to the surveillance and health control bodies.

Conclusion

Therefore, we conclude that the prevalence of COVID-19 in Cuiabá - MT was higher in
