Abstract

Background:

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has put significant additional pressure on healthcare

systems throughout the world. The identification of at-risk population beyond age, pre-existing

medical conditions and socioeconomic status has been the subject of only a small part of the

global COVID-19 research so far. To this day, the extent to which the red blood cell (RBC)

antigens expressed by an individual can be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or clearance

remains unknown.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused over 2.6 million deaths worldwide as of March

2021

(https://covid19.who.int/).

Intensive

work

has

been

done

since

the

beginning

of

the

pandemic to protect the most at-risk populations. Being male, of older age, obese, of varying

ethic

origin,

having

diabetes,

asthma,

or

many

other

medical

conditions,

associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related complications or death

1–5

have

all

been

. Genetic factors,

such as the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-related genes, may also play a

6

role in disease severity and could serve as a predictive marker for at-risk populations .

The relation between ABO blood group expression and susceptibility for infection by SARS-CoV-

2, hospitalization risks and death risks from COVID-19 has been explored by a few groups. O

group individuals were identified as having a decreased risk of infection compared to other ABO

groups,

although

no

differences

associated with COVID-19

7,8

were

observed

regarding

hospitalization

and

death

rates

. Several hypotheses to explain this observed link between ABO type

and risk of infection have been proposed, in regard to the presence of A and B antibody in O

individuals

9

and the binding of Receptor-Binding Domain (RBC) to group A antigens

10

. Given the

important immunological deregulation and potential cytokine storm associated with mortality in

COVID-19 patients

11

and the interesting reports from an Italian laboratory of higher rates of

direct antiglobulin test (DAT) reactivity in COVID-19 patients

12

, we sought to determine if any

trends could be identified in the expression of an extended panel of red blood cell antigens

(ABO, RhD and 37 other antigens) within a Caucasian convalescent plasma donor cohort (N=90)

compared to reference frequencies.

hospitalization and free of symptoms for at least two weeks before donation, and respected the

CONCOR-1 selection criteria. The average age of our convalescent plasma donor cohort was 40.4

± 15.0 years and included 68% males. All donors gave consent to participate in this research

project, which was approved by the Héma-Québec Research Ethics Committee.

Phenotyping and genotyping

the manufacturer’s protocol. The RBC genotyping was done on the Luminex xMAP® technology

Results
Red blood cell genotyping
Caucasian antigen frequencies for Rh, Kell, MNS, Duffy, Kidd, Diego, Dombrock, Colton, Yt and
