Abstract
The Coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic, which was first reported in
December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has caused 3,314 death as of March 31,
2020 in China. This study aimed to investigate the spatial associations of
daily particulate matter (PM) concentrations with death rate of
COVID-19 in China. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis to examine
the spatial associations of daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations with
death rate of COVID-19 in China through multiple linear regression
method. We found that COVID-19 held higher death rates with increasing
concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 levels in the spatial scale, which may
affect the process of patients developed from mild to severe and finally
influence the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 is a new emerge of coronavirus that poses immense
challenges to global health and the economy. As of April 3, 2020, a total
of 1,042,588 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in 199 countries
worldwide. In China, a total of 82,772 confirmed cases and 3,327 deaths
were recorded. World Health Origination (WHO) announced on March 11
that the assessment of the COVID-19 outbreak has been a global
pandemic.

The hypothesis that air pollution can act both as a vector of the
infection and as a worsening factor of the health impact of the pandemic
in progress has been raised recently. Short-term exposure to ambient
particulate matter (PM) pollution has been associated with increasing
risks

of

mortality and

morbidity of cardiopulmonary diseases

worldwide1,2, and the adverse effects are significantly higher for people
who are older or with underlying medical conditions3, among which the
fatality of COVID-19 is also higher. While previous studies suggested
that short-term exposure to PM could aggravate respiratory symptoms
and increase the emergency visits of patients with asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 4, the European Public Health
Alliance have recently reported that air pollution is likely to increase the
death rate of SARS-CoV-2 in cities5. Air pollution, especially PM
pollution, was approved to be also positively associated case fatality of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China6.
However, few studies have estimated and quantified the short-term
effects of air pollutants on early deaths from COVID-19. While the extent
of correlation is less known, this study aimed to investigate the
association between death rate of COVID-19 and PM2.5 and PM10
pollutions in a spatial scale.

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis to examine the spatial
associations of daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations with death rate of
COVID-19 in China through multiple linear regression method. The
COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths information in China was
collected from the National Health Commission and the Provincial Health
Commissions of China. We calculated death rate, which was defined as
cumulative death counts divided by cumulative confirmed cases, for 49
cities including Wuhan, other 15 cities inside Hubei and 33 cities outside
Hubei, with no less than 100 cases as of March 22 (few confirmed cases
and deaths were reported afterwards). Daily PM2.5 and PM10 data were
collected from the National Urban Air Quality Publishing Platform
(http://106.37.208.233:20035/), which is administered by China’s Ministry of

Environmental Protection. And meteorological data including daily mean
temperature and relative humidity were collected from the China
Meteorological Data Sharing Service System. Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) per capita, hospital beds and population size were obtained from
statistical yearbook of each province.

Results
As of March 22, the mean death rate of COVID-19 was 1.7% among
the 49 cities in China, with a range of 0.0%-5.0%. And the mean ±
standard deviation and range were (51.2±20.9, 20.8-96.9 μg/m3 &

62.1±22.6, 30.8-115.1 μg/m3) for PM2.5 & PM10. There were no
significant PM2.5 or PM10 differences between cities outside and inside
Hubei (t=0.48, p=0.63 & t=0.63, p=0.53). Death rate of cities inside
Hubei except Wuhan was significantly lower than that of Wuhan (t=6.70,
p=5.0×10-5), while death rate of cities outside Hubei was even lower than
those inside Hubei (t=8.26, p=2.6×10-10).
After adjustment for temperature, relative humidity, GDP per capita
and hospital beds per capita, COVID-19 death rate was positively
associated with concentration of PM2.5 (Figure 1A, χ2=13.10, p=0.011)
and PM10 (Figure 1B, χ2=12.38, p=0.015), suggesting that COVID-19
held higher death rates with increasing concentration of PM2.5 and PM10
levels in the spatial scale. In addition, we did not find significance in the
association between GDP per capita, hospital beds per capita, temperature
or relative humanity and COVID-19 death rate (χ2=6.02, p=0.20 &

Discussions
Our results demonstrate that the death rate of coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) has a strong association with PM2.5 and PM10, whether in
Hubei province or other cities in China. Our results are consistent with
previous studies of SARS6. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which
shares 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV and has the same cell entry
receptor - angiotensin converting enzyme II - as SARS-CoV. Limited

studies have researched on the associations between air pollution and
SARS which only lasted for half year in 2003 and only a few Chinese
cities had adequate death data for analysis. A previous one reported that
moderate air pollution index (APIs), which was dominated by PM10 in
China in 2003, had an 84% increased risk of dying from SARS compared
to those from regions with low APIs, and SARS patients from regions
with high APIs were twice as likely to die from SARS compared to those
from regions with low APIs. Other previous studies demonstrated that
long-term or short-term exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 might damage the
lung functions7-9. The mechanism of the effects from PM exposure on
respiratory outcomes might be caused by activation of inflammatory
pathways in the small airways in response to PMs, leading to the
recruitment of inflammatory cells10. These biological mechanisms might
potentially influence the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
Considering the fact that the patients died from COVID-19 are likely
to be critically ill, most of them might stay in Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
for treatment. We speculate that the effects of PM2.5 and PM10 on death
mainly affect the progress of patients from mild to severe and prognosis.
There is a need to increase our efforts in the control of air pollutant
emissions, especially regarding the situation that the COVID-19
epidemics may come back at any time.
The study was limited to a short period of season with less variation

of air pollution. However, the correlation of trends of death and air
pollution is quite convincing. Given the ecological nature of study, other
city-level factors, such as implementation ability of COVID-19 control
policy, urbanization rate, and availability of medical resources, may affect
the death rate of COVID-19 and confound our findings, however, we
control the GDP per capita and hospital beds per capita increased the
credibility of the results.
