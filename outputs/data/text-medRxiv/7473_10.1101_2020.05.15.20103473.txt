Abstract
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently a global pandemic, and the early
screening of COVID-19 is one of the key factors for COVID-19 control and treatment.
Here, we developed and validated chest CT-based imaging biomarkers for COVID-19
patient screening. We identified the vasculature-like signals from CT images and found
that, compared to healthy and community acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, the
COVID-19 patients revealed significantly higher abundance of these signals. Furthermore,
unsupervised feature learning leads to the discovery of clinical-relevant imaging
biomarkers from the vasculature-like signals for accurate and sensitive COVID-19
screening that has been double-blindly validated in an independent hospital (sensitivity:
0.941, specificity: 0.904, AUC: 0.952). Our findings could open a new avenue to assist
screening of COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently a global pandemic[1, 2]. More than
one million cases of COVID-19 have currently been confirmed, but the peak in the number
thrives through uncertainty [3]. China's prevention and control experience in February
showed that early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment are
essential for the prevention and control of the entire COVID-19 epidemic. Nucleic acid
detection based on the new coronavirus provides the most important tools for the diagnosis
of pathogens and COVID-19. However, many challenges include: (1) COVID-19 belongs
to a class of highly infectious diseases, and a considerable proportion of the patients have
no obvious clinical symptoms during the onset of this disease [4]; (2) in the early stages of
the disease, the amount of virus in the upper respiratory tract, including the nasopharynx,
is very small under detection, which result in that some patients with suspected COVID19 cannot be diagnosed, isolated, and treated because of negative nucleic acid test results;
(3) due to the quality of the coronavirus nucleic acid detection kit is not uniform, the
operation is not standardized and other factors, the nucleic acid test has obvious false
negatives; and (4) due to the rapid outbreak of the epidemic in many regions around the
world, there are obvious shortages of resources including nucleic acid detection kits in
some countries, which also limits the clinical application of the nucleic acid detection.
Except for the coronavirus etiology, epidemiological contact history, and clinical
symptoms, pulmonary imaging (especially chest computed tomography (CT) imaging) has
very unique value for the diagnosis of COVID-19[5]. COVID-19 patients with early lung
CT showed multiple interstitial changes in small patchy albums, which were evident in the
extrapulmonary bands. As the disease progresses, the imaging of the disease can develop
into multiple "ground-glass opacities" (GGO) and infiltrates in the lungs, and severe
consolidation may occur in patients with severe disease [6]. However, the CT image of

COVID-19 patients especially at early stage are similar to these from other common
pneumonia patients, including H7N9 influenza virus pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia,
chlamydial pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia [7]. In this study, we develop and validate
chest CT-based imaging biomarkers for COVID-19 patient screening using artificial
intelligence (or computer vision) methods, which will be of great significance to reduce
the workload of clinicians and to assist in differential diagnosis of COVID-19 from other
diseases. Our findings could open a new avenue to assist screening of COVID-19 patients.
Material and Methods
Data collection
The chest CT images in this case-control study were collected from Hubei Provincial
Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Wuhan Third Hospital. The inclusion criteria
for COVID-19 patients were: (1) patients were diagnosed and confirmed through nucleic
acid test from January 2020 to March 2020; (2) patient were with mild or moderate disease
status, where the severity was classified according to the Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) diagnosis and treatment guideline (trial version 7) issued by the National
Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China. Specifically, according to the
guidelines, patients with mild disease status have mild clinical symptoms, and have no
obvious pneumonia manifestations on chest CT images; and patients with moderate disease
status have obvious respiratory symptoms such as fever and cough, and have obvious
pneumonia manifestations on chest CT images. In addition, both patients with community
acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthy participants (with no obvious abnormalities in
chest CT images) were randomly collected from aforementioned two hospitals and used as
control group. The inclusion criteria for control group were: (1) patients who were
diagnosed with lung infection on imaging and clinical basis few months before the onset
of the epidemic; (2) patients without severe diseases of respiratory system, cardiovascular
or cerebrovascular systems, (3) patients without mental illness or cognitive impairment.
This study has been approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of both participating
hospitals.
Imaging Protocol for CT chest
Chest CT exams from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine were
performed with two different scanners: (1) GE Optima 660 CT (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee)
and (2) uCT 530 (United imaging, Shanghai), with reconstruction thickness at 0.625 mm
and 1 mm, respectively. While, CT exams from Wuhan Third Hospital were performed
with GE Discovery CT750 HD (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee) with reconstruction thickness
at 0.625mm.
Vasculature-like Structure Enhancement
Vasculature-like signal is recognized and enhanced using an iterative tangential voting
(ITV) approach [8] within pre-segmented lung regions in 3D, where ITV enforces the

continuity and strength of local linear structures (i.e., vasculature-like structure) and the
3D lung segmentation is achieved via level-set method [9]. Specifically, ITV operates on
CT image gradient information with sigma set to be 0.5 and 1.0 on training and validation
cohorts, respectively, to accommodate the technical difference across hospitals.
Imaging Biomarker Detection and Visualization for COVID-19 Screening
We developed an unsupervised feature learning pipeline based on Stacked Predictive
Sparse Decomposition (Stacked PSD) [10] for the unsupervised discover of underlying 3D
characteristics from the ‘vasculature-like signal’ space derived from CT-based raw images.
Specifically, in this study, we used single network layer with 256 dictionary elements (i.e.,
signal patterns) at a fixed pattern size of 20x20x20 pixels and a fixed sampling rate of 100
3D patches per sample which were experimentally optimized. In the training cohort, 8 of
256 dictionary elements were identified to have significant correlation with COVID-19
with cutoff FDR value < 0.05 through cross-validation approach (training sample rate: 0.8;
bootstrap 100 times). At last, these 8 significant dictionary elements as a set of imaging
biomarkers were selected and utilized to build the random decision forests model for
COVID-19 screening. A double-blind study was designed and implemented to validate this
model in an independent hospital. Visualization of these imaging biomarkers was created
in three-dimensional space using ITK-Snap (version 3.8.0), Python (version 3.7.0),
Matplotlib (version 3.1.2), Blender (version 2.82) and Three.js (version r115 on GitHub).
Snapshots of the three-dimensional visualization were used to generate two-dimensional
visualization that overlays with the original CT slices.
Comparison of the Performance between the 3D Imaging Biomarkers and
Experienced Chest Radiologists
In order to validate the diagnostic performance of our pre-identified 3D imaging
biomarkers, we invited two experienced chest radiologists to independently and blindly
(blind to clinical data) assess the CT images in our validation cohort. These two chest
radiologists have 8 and 10 years of clinical imaging diagnosis experience, respectively.
And both of them have more than 2 months of intense and continuous diagnosis experience
of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Sensitivity and specificity were utilized for performance
comparison between the chest radiologists and our 3D imaging biomarkers.
Statistical Analysis
The difference in the vasculature-like signals among different groups (COVID-19, CAP
and healthy) was assessed by non-parametric test, and the association between signatures
and COVID-19 by logistic regression. Principle component analysis (PCA) and heatmap
cluster analysis were performed in R (version 3.6.1) and MATLAB (version 2012b),
respectively. The screening performance was characterized with sensitivity, specificity and
area under curve (AUC).

Results
Study Population Characteristics
In order to identify chest CT-based imaging biomarkers for COVID-19 patient screening,
we conducted a case-control study in two hospitals together with artificial intelligence
technologies in machine learning (Fig. 1). The population characteristics for the training
and double-blind validation cohorts are summarized in Extended Data Table 1. A total of
321 participants were included in this case-control study. The cohort (n=116) from one
hospital (Hospital A) served as training set, the cohort (n=205) from the other (Hospital B)
as a double-blind validation set (Fig. 1). The median ages of participants in the training and
validation cohorts were 42 (range: 14-76) and 58 (range; 19-89), respectively. There were
53 (45.7%) females and 63 (54.3%) males in the training cohort, while corresponding data
were 110 (53.7%) and 95 (46.3%) in the validation cohort. The training cohort contained
47 (40.5%) COVID-19 patients, 20 (17.2%) healthy and 49 (42.2%) CAP patients, while
the validation cohort had 153 (74.6%) COVID-19 patients, 15 (7.3%) healthy and 37 CAP
(18%) patients.
Vasculature-like Structure Enhancement
In our study, the vasculature-like structure was recognized and enhanced with iterative
tangential voting in both training and validation cohorts as a pre-processing step.
Interestingly in the training cohort, the mean vasculature-like signal reveals significant
difference (p-value < 0.05) among healthy, CAP and COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2b). These
findings are consistent with the observation of vascular changes in lung tissue from
COVID-19 patients, including vascular congestion/enlargement, small vessels hyperplasia
and vessel wall thickening[11, 12]. Furthermore, such distinction itself leads to remarkable
differentiation between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups in our training cohort
(AUC=0.721, Extended Data Fig. 2, blue curve) with logistic regression approach.
Altogether, those results encourage us to identify imaging biomarkers from the
“vasculature-like signal” space to assist accurate screening of COVID-19.
Imaging Biomarker Detection and COVID-19 Screening
Next, we applied Stacked PSD on the entire training cohort within the ‘vasculature-like
signal’ space to acquire underlying characteristics for dictionary construction (details see
method). 256 dictionary elements were learned and optimized from the entire training
cohort. We found that 8 of 256 dictionary elements have significantly positive correlation
with COVID-19 (FDR < 0.05, Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1). These
8 COVID-19-relevant signatures (i.e., imaging biomarkers) are graphically presented (Fig.
1 3D CT Imaging Biomarkers panel). These biomarkers also allow the construction of full
3D multispectral staining in the entire lung region (Fig. 2a), which is further demonstrated
in 3D animations (Supplementary Videos 1-3). The corresponding 2D multispectral
staining into the CT image slices are also constructed (Supplementary Videos 4-6). The 8
imaging biomarkers clearly separate COVID-19 patients from others in the training cohort

by PCA (Fig. 2c) and clustering (Extend Data Fig. 3a) analysis. Finally, we built a random
decision forest model for COVID-19 screening based on these imaging biomarkers within
the training cohort (AUC = 1.000, Extended Data Fig. 2, red curve), which will be tested
in the validation cohort.
Test of Imaging Biomarkers in Validation Cohort
Identical enhancement process was applied onto the validation cohort. Similar to training
cohort, we observed the distinction of mean vasculature-like signal among different groups
(i.e., COVID-19, CAP and healthy) (Fig. 2d). The logistic regression model pre-built in the
training cohort on signal led to accurate prediction between COVID-19 patients and others
in the validation cohort (AUC=0.927, Fig. 2f, blue curve). 8 pre-identified imaging
biomarkers also clearly separate the COVID-19 patients from others in validation cohort
(Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 3b). Excitingly, we founded the pre-built random decision
forest model based on pre-obtained biomarkers predict COVID-19 with high sensitivity
(0.941), specificity (0.904), and AUC (0.952), which is competitive with two COVID-19
experienced chest radiologists (Fig. 2f).
Discussion
In this study, we developed and validated 3D imaging biomarkers for COVID-19 screening
based on chest CT images. Our quantitative evaluation suggests that, compared to healthy
and CAP patients, COVID-19 patients may have significantly more vascular changes in
lung tissue, including vascular congestion/enlargement, small vessels hyperplasia and
vessel wall thickening[11, 12], which leads to the discovery of robust imaging biomarkers
for COVID-19 screening. Our double-blind validation confirms the robustness and
effectiveness of pre-identified imaging biomarkers in an independent hospital with high
specificity (0.904) and sensitivity (0.941), which is competitive with two COVID-19
experienced chest radiologists.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is a world-wide threat. Specifically, in Europe and the
United States, there are tens of thousands of new confirmed cases and suspected cases
every day[13-16]. These sharply increased cases of COVID-19 are running out of medical
resources in some countries to varying degrees and are paralyzing the medical system in
some countries[17]. Therefore, rapid screening, diagnosis, isolation and treatment of
COVID-19 patients are particularly important for the prevention and control of the
epidemic. However, it is unfortunate that nucleic acid detection kits for COVID-19 have
been in short supply in many countries. At the same time, due to improper operation,
technical variations among different nucleic acid detection kits and many other reasons,
the results of nucleic acid test have certain false negatives. On the other hand, CT
examination has been proved to have unique advantages in the early screening and
diagnosis of COVID-19[11, 18]. To discover new possibility for COVID-19 screening, this
study utilized an unsupervised deep learning method to identify robust imaging biomarkers

from chest CT scans for accurate COVID-19 screening. The major advantages of our
imaging biomarkers reside in two folds as follows: (1) they provide robust, accurate and
cost-effective COVID-19 screening, which can significantly alleviate the shortage of
clinical resources, including both nucleic acid detection kids and experienced chest
radiologists; and (2) they provide a non-invasive diagnostic tool that enables world-wide
scalable practical applications. Furthermore, our imaging biomarkers may provide a new
avenue for predicting COVID-19 patients’ prognosis and clinical outcome, which will be
further investigated in our future research.
