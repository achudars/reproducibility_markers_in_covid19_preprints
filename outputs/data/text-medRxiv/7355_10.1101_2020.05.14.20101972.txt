Abstract
The SARS-COV-2 pandemic has put pressure on Intensive Care Units, so that identifying
predictors of disease severity is a priority. We collected ​58 clinical and biological variables,
chest CT scan data (506,341 images), and radiology reports from 1,003 coronavirus-infected
patients from two French hospitals. We trained a deep learning model based on CT scans to
predict

severity; this model was more discriminative than a radiologist quantification of

disease extent. We showed that neural network analysis of CT-scan brings unique prognosis
information, although it is correlated with other markers of severity (oxygenation, LDH, and
CRP). To provide a multimodal severity score, we developed ​AI-severity that includes 5
clinical and biological variables (age, sex, oxygenation, urea, platelet) as well as the CT
deep learning model. When comparing ​AI-severity with 11 existing scores for severity, we
find significantly improved prognosis performance; ​AI-severity can therefore rapidly become
a reference scoring approach.

Introduction
Hospitalized COVID-19 patients are likely to develop severe outcomes requiring mechanical
ventilation or high-flow oxygenation. Among hospitalized patients, 14 to 30% will require
admission to an ICU, 12 to 33% will require mechanical ventilation, and 20% to 33% will
die​1–4​. Detection at admission of patients at risk of severe outcomes is important to deliver
proper care and to optimize use of limited intensive care unit (ICU)​ ​ressources​5​.
Identification of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at risk for severe deterioration can be done
using risk scores that combine several factors including age, sex, and comorbidities (CALL,
COVID-GRAM, 4C Mortality Score)​6–12​. Some risk scores also include additional markers of
severity such as the dyspnea symptom, clinical examination variables such as low oxygen
saturation and elevated respiratory rate, as well as biological factors reflecting multi-organ
failures such as elevated Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values​8,10,13–15​.
Beyond clinical and biological variables, ​computerized tomography (CT) scans also contain
prognostic information, as the degree of pulmonary inflammation is associated with clinical
symptoms, and the amount of lung abnormality is associated with severe evolution​16–20​.
CT-scans can be acquired at admission to diagnose COVID-19 when RT-PCR results are

negative​21​. However, the extent to which CT scans at patient admission add prognostic
information beyond what can be inferred from clinical and biological data is unresolved.
The objective of this study was to integrate clinical, biological and radiological data to predict
the outcome of hospitalized patients. By processing CT-scan images with a deep learning
model and by using a radiologist report that contains a semi-quantitative description of
CT-scans, we evaluated the additional amount of information brought by CT-scans.

Results
A total of 1,003 patients from Kremlin-Bicêtre (KB, Paris, France) and Gustave Roussy
(IGR, Villejuif, France) were enrolled in the study. Clinical, biological, and CT scan images
and reports were collected at hospital admission. There were 931 patients for which clinical,
biological and CT-scan data were available (Supp Fig 1). A total of 506,341 images were
analyzed for the 980 patients with CT-scans (average of 517 slices per scan). Radiologists
annotated 17,873 images from 329 CT-scans. Summary statistics for the clinical, biological,
and CT scan data are provided in Table 1
Variables associated with severity
We first evaluated how clinical and biological variables measured at admission were
associated with future severe progression, which we defined as an oxygen flow rate of 15
L/min or higher and/or the need for mechanical ventilation and/or patient death​22​. This
definition of severe progression corresponds to a score of 5 or more according to the World
Health Organization evaluation of severity on a 1 to 10 scale. We computed the severity
odds ratios for each individual variable, and at each hospital center (Table 1). When
combining association results from the two centers, we found 12 variables significantly
associated with severity (P <0.05/58 to account for testing 58 variables, Table 1): age, sex,
oxygen saturation, diastolic pressure, respiratory rate, chronic kidney disease, hypertension,
LDH, and urea, CRP, polynuclear neutrophil, and leukocytes.
We then assessed the predictive value of features from admission radiology reports. These
reports contain semi-quantitative evaluations of the extent of disease which values range
from 0 to 5, as well as a presence/absence coding of several types of lung lesions in

COVID-19 patients. We found three significant associated features (P <0.05/58): extent of
disease, and presence of crazy paving lesions, which are both associated with greater
severity, and presence of a peripheral distribution of lesions, which is associated with lesser
severity.

standard deviation of the continuous variable.

A neural network model to predict severity based on CT scans
To capture CT-scan prognosis information from images, we considered a weakly supervised

​ deep learning model
approach with no radiologist-provided annotations (Supp Fig 2)​23​. A

was trained to predict severe progression based on a CT-scan image​. ​The neural network
was trained on a development cohort consisting of 646 patients from Kremlin-Bicêtre
Hospital (KB). It was evaluated on 150 KB patients, which were left-over from the
development cohort, and it was further evaluated using a validation cohort consisting of 135
patients from Institut Gustave Roussy hospital (IGR). The discriminative ability of the ​neural

network w
used to train the network, and of AUC = 0.75 (0.65,0.84) for the validation IGR dataset. As a
point of comparison, the AUC obtained with the radiologist evaluation of disease extent is of
0.73 (0.64-0.82) for the 150 KB patients of the development cohort and of 0.66 (0.56-0.76)
for the validation IGR cohort, and the difference between the two AUC values was significant
for the validation IGR cohort only (P​≤​0.05).
Interpretability analysis of the neural network model
To apprehend the information present within the CT scans that is captured by the weakly
supervised neural network model, we evaluated to what extent the features (internal
representation) extracted by the neural network can predict clinical and radiological
variables. To this end, we trained a new logistic regression with the extracted features as
input, and some clinical and radiological variables as output. ​AUC on the 150 leftover
patients of the KB development cohort was 0.93 (0.88,0.97) for disease extent (threshold
>2), 0.78 (0.70,0.85) for crazy paving, 0.64 (0.53,0.74) for condensation and 0.80 (0.65,0.94)
for Ground Glass Opacity (Supp Table 1). It was also possible to relate internal
representations of the neural networks to clinical variables. We obtained an AUC of 0.88
(0.82,0.94) for predicting an age strictly larger than 60 year-old, an AUC of 0.93 (0.89,0.97)
for sex, and of 0.76 (0.68,0.84) for predicting an oxygen saturation larger than 90%. As a
comparison, a logistic regression trained on the variables from the radiology report obtained
only AUC scores of 0.70 (​0.61,0.78​) for age, 0.57 (​0.48, 0.67​) for sex and of 0.68 (​0.58, 0.77​)
for oxygen saturation, and differences of AUC were significant (P<0.05). Simply put, ​this
analysis shows that the internal representation of the ​neural network captures clinical

features from the lung CTs, such as sex or age, on top of the known COVID-19 radiology
features.

A multimodal prognostic models for severity
To add information from lab tests and chest characteristics to the CT-scan information, we
constructed the ​AI-severity score. We used a greedy search approach to include optimal
clinical and biological variables (see Methods). In addition to the CT deep learning variable,
the variables included in ​AI-severity are age, sex, oxygen saturation, urea, and platelet
counts. Coefficients and transformations required to compute the 6-variable ​AI-severity
score are available in Supp Table 2. Coefficients required to compute ​AI-severity were
learned using the WHO-defined high severity outcome of "oxygen flow rate of 15 L/min or
higher, or need for mechanical ventilation, or death". All the prognosis scores were also
evaluated on two other outcomes that consist of "death or ICU admission" and "death".

Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier curves for the high risk individuals and the ones with low or medium
risk according to ​AI-severity​. The threshold to assign individuals into a high risk group was the
⅔-quantile of the ​AI-severity ​score computed for patients of the KB development cohort. Kaplan-Meier
curves were obtained for the 150 leftover KB patients from the development cohort (left panel) and the
135 patients of the IGR validation cohort (right panel). P-values for the log-rank `test were equal to
4.77e-07 (KB) and 4.00e-12 (IGR). The two terciles used to determine threshold values for low,
medium and high risk groups were equal to 0.187, and 0.375.

We evaluated ​AI-severity with several statistical measures of performance. The
discriminative ability of AI-severity ​was of AUC ​= 0.78 (0.69,0.86) for the 150 left-over KB
patients, and of AUC = 0.79 (0.70,0.87) for the validation IGR dataset. To compute additional
measures of performance, individuals in the top tercile were assigned in a high risk group.
We found that the survival function of the individuals at high risk was significantly different
from the survival function of the other individuals (Figure 1, P = 4.77e-07 at KB, P = 4.00e-12
at IGR for a log-rank test). When considering a binary classification consisting of a high-risk
group and a medium or low risk group, we obtained for the ‘O​2​≥15L/min or Ventilation or
Death’ outcome, a positive predictive values (or precision) of 54% (0.40-0.67) (KB) and 76%
(0.56-0.92) (IGR), negative predictive values of 86% (0.78-0.93) (KB) and 81% (0.73-0.88)
(IGR), specificities of 75% (0.66-0.84) (KB) and 94% (0.89-0.98) (IGR), and sensitivities of
70% (0.56-0.83) (KB) and 47% (0.30-0.63) (IGR) (Table 2).

validation cohort. Among alternative scores, the COVID-GRAM, the NEWS2 for COVID-19
score, and the 4C mortality scores were the ones with the largest mean AUC values
(averaged over outcomes and hospitals). The ​AI-severity score was significantly larger than
the NEWS2 for COVID-19 score for all outcomes when evaluated with the left-over patients
of the KB development cohort and for the ‘Death or ICU’ and the ‘Death’ outcomes when
evaluated with patients from the IGR validation cohort. Differences between ​AI-severity on
the one hand and the COVID-GRAM score or the 4C mortality score on the other hand were
significant only for the ‘Death or ICU’ outcome when being evaluated on the left-over
patients of the KB development cohort but they were significant for all outcomes when being
evaluated on the validation IGR cohort.

Development of alternative models that include CT-scan information
In addition to ​AI-severity​, we considered two alternative scores that also integrate CT-scan
information. The two scores include the same clinical and biological variables (age, sex,
oxygen saturation, urea, platelets) than ​AI-severity​. The first score (​AI-segment) uses an
automatic quantification of disease extent to include CT-scan information and the second
score (​C & B & RR) ​considers a radiologist quantification--available in the radiological
report-instead. ​AI-segment relies on segmentation of lesions that was performed by training
another deep learning model using fully annotated and partially annotated CT-scans (see

about

segmentation).

The

correlation

between automatic

quantification of lung lesions with ​AI-segment ​and radiologist quantification was of 0.56
(Supp Fig 3, see Supplementary Material about segmentation).
AI-severity has a superior discriminative ability when compared to the alternative ​C & B &

​ lthough differences of AUC were generally not significant (Supp
RR and ​AI-segment s​ cores a
Fig 4)​. ​The mean difference averaged over outcomes between AUC​AI-severity and ​AUC​C & B & RR

(​resp. AUC​AI-segment)​ ​is null (resp. 0.03) for the 150 leftover KB patients of the development
cohort and of 0.04 (resp. 0.01) for the IGR validation cohort. Differences between scores

​ t KB for the ‘Death
were not significant except when comparing ​AI-severity ​to ​AI-segment a

or ICU’ outcome​ (​ Supp Fig 4)​.

Additional value of CT-scan information
Last, we evaluate to what extent CT-scan adds prognosis information to the clinical
characteristics and biological variables from lab tests. To this end, we trained a score named
C & B based on Clinical and Biological variables only. The AUC of the scores that integrate
CT-scan information was larger or equivalent to the AUC of the ​C & B s​ core (Supp Fig 5).

​ UC​C&B was equal
The mean difference averaged over outcomes between AUC​AI-severity ​and A
to 0.03 for both cohorts. Differences between ​AI-severity and ​C & B were significant for
some outcomes and cohorts but not for all combinations (Supp Fig 5). This comparative

analysis shows that CT-scan adds significant prognosis information although the addition of
CT-scan information increases AUC by a measurable but limited amount in both cohorts;
there was a difference of AUC of 0.03 when comparing ​AI-severity​ to the ​C & B​ score.
To further investigate the added prognosis value of CT-scan, we studied the association
between COVID-19 severity and the prognosis variable provided by the neural network. In

the KB dataset, the three variables that were the most correlated with the prognosis variable
of the neural network were oxygen saturation (r = -0.52 (-0.58,-0.48)), LDH (r = 0.46
(0.39,0.52)), CRP (r = 0.43 (0.37,0.49)) (Supp Table 4). To account for the confounding
effect of these variables, we regressed the severity outcome with the neural network
prognosis variable and the three correlated variables. We found that the neural network
variable was significantly correlated with the severity outcome (P = 0.01). The statistical
evidence for association between the neural network prognosis variable and COVID-19
severity was also found (P = 3.24 ​× ​10​-6​) when accounting for the five additional variables of
AI-severity.​ This confirms that CT-scan information captured by the neural network brings
unique prognostic information.

Discussion
Using a deep learning model to capture CT scan prognosis information, we have built the
AI-severity score to prognose severe evolution for COVID-19 hospitalized patients. In
addition to the deep learning variable, ​AI-severity is based on age, sex, oxygen saturation,
urea and platelet counts. On the IGR validation cohort containing a majority of cancer
patients, ​AI-severity ​provided values of AUCs significantly larger than the ones obtained with
the best prognosis scores of our comparative analysis, which consist of COVID-GRAM, the
NEWS2 score modified for COVID-19 patients and the 4C mortality score​6,12,24​. ​Taken
together, these results show ​that future disease severity markers are present within routine
CT scans performed at admission.
Looking back on the prognostic clinical and biological variables, we found 12 of these
significantly associated with severe evolution, which is consistent with previous studies​15,25,26​.
First, looking at clinical characteristics, we confirmed that male and older persons are more
at risk​27​. Second, looking at clinical examination variables, we found that respiratory rate,
diastolic pressure, and oxygen saturation are clinical variables associated with severity.
These associations may reflect physician decisions taken for ICU triage. Inclusion criteria for
critical care triage include (i) requirement for invasive ventilatory support characterized by an
oxygen saturation lower than 90%, or by respiratory failure, or (ii) requirement for
vasopressors characterized by hypotension and low blood pressure​28​. Third, looking at
comorbidities, we confirmed the results of several meta-analyses​26,29–31 that showed that
chronic kidney disease and hypertension are linked to severity. We however did not find
significant associations for other comorbidities previously associated with severity, such as
diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases​31,32​. While we expected cancer patients to have more

severe outcomes because they are generally older, with multiple co-morbidities and often in
a treatment-induced immunosuppressive state​33–35​, we did not find this association. Several
factors can explain this. Each cohort was not optimally balanced to conclusively study the
association between cancer and severity: IGR admitted mostly cancer patients (80% of the
patients) while KB admitted very few cancer patients (7%). Fourth, looking at COVID-19
symptoms, we did not find any significantly associated with severity. Dyspnea is a prominent
symptom that has been repeatedly associated with severity and our results are compatible
with a positive association with severity but we may lack a large-enough sample size to be
significant​6,36,37​. Last, looking at biological measures, we found that inflammatory biomarkers,
LDH and CRP are related to severity​14,25,38​. We also found association of severity with
leukocytes, neutrophils and urea, the later being explained by the fact that high urea is
indicative of kidney dysfunction. Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) was not significantly
associated to severity, possibly because of lack of statistical power and stringent correction
for multiple testing, but association betwen thrombocytopenia and severity was in the
expected direction and platelet counts are included in the 6-variable ​AI-severity​ score​39​.
Beyond these clinical and biological variables, chest CT-scans provided additional markers
of disease severity. Significant features include the total extent of lesions, and the presence
of crazy paving pattern lesions. Although the extent of disease severity and consolidation are
known to be associated with severity​16,19,40–45​, our study discovered its association with crazy
paving, a precursor of consolidation lesions. Initial damages to the alveoli, as well as protein
and fibrous exudation, explain the early onset of GGO. As the disease progresses, more and
more inflammatory cells infiltrate the alveoli and interstitial space, followed by diffuse
alveolar lesions and the formation of a hyaline membrane, which results in a crazy paving
appearance, which is then followed by consolidation on the CT examination​46,47​.
Compared to a radiologist's reporting and quantification of lesions, there are several
advantages to capturing CT-scan information through a deep learning model. Good
reproducibility is a key element for imaging biomarkers, and visual inspection of images
introduces variability that can hinder its clinical application​48​. Another advantage is that
radiologists are faced with the challenge that large numbers of cases must be read,
annotated and prioritized in a COVID-19 pandemic. AI analysis of radiological images has
the potential to reduce this burden and speed up their reading time. Finally, prognosis scores
obtained with deep learning models trained on CT-scans are more predictive of severity than
a quantification of disease extent performed by a radiologist. We indeed showed that
internal representation of the ​AI-severity neural network model captures clinical information

from CT scans, and this can be particularly useful when some clinical or lab measurements
are missing.
Our reported prognostic values for CT-scan-based models (AUC range of 0.70 - 0.80) are
lower than the 0.85 AUC reported in a previously published study that uses deep learning
with CT-scan images for prognosis​17​. We hypothesize that this is due to use of different
outcome definitions, as well as different patient characteristics in the study cohorts (age,
severity at admission, etc). Hospital admission criteria vary between countries and hospitals;
for instance, the proportion of deaths in our French KB and IGR cohorts was of 16-17%,
while it was of 39% in the study that reported larger AUC values​17​. When applying other
previously published scores to the KB and IGR datasets, we found smaller AUC scores than
reported values in the original papers. This difference can again be explained by differing
patient characteristics, and different measures of severity between studies​7,10,16​6,9
Our evaluation of ​AI-severity and of alternative scores revealed that including CT scan
information in addition to clinical and biological information significantly improves prognosis
of future severity at least for the IGR validation cohort. However, the neural network
prognosis variable was correlated to biological and clinical severity biomarkers such as CRP
levels, tissue damage (LDH) and oxygenation—highlighting some information redundancy
between data modalities—explaining the relatively modest gain of AUC provided by
CT-scan​36,49–51​.
Beyond AI modeling, our study shows that the 6-variable ​AI-severity score integrating a
radiological quantification of lesions with key clinical and biological variables provides
accurate severity predictions, and can rapidly become a reference scoring approach for
hospitalized patients.

Methods
Description of the retrospective study
Data including CT-scans, were collected at two French hospitals (Kremlin Bicêtre Hospital,
APHP, Paris denoted as KB and Gustave Roussy Hospital, Villejuif denoted as IGR). CT
scans, clinical, and biological data were collected in the first 2 days after hospital admission.
This study has received approval of ethic committees from the two hospitals and authors
submitted a declaration to the National Commission of Data Processing and Liberties (N°
INDS MR5413020420, CNIL) in order to get registered in the medical studies database and

respect the General Regulation on Data Protection (RGPD) requirements. An information
letter was sent to all patients included in the study. We stopped to update information about
patient status on the 5th of May. Among the 1,003 patients of the study, two patients asked
to be excluded from the study.
Inclusion criteria were (1) date of admission at hospital (from the 12th of February to the 20th
of March at Kremin Bicêtre and from the 2nd of March to the 24th of April at Institut Gustave
Roussy) and (2) a positive diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients were considered positive either
because of a positive RT-PCR (real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction) based on
nasal or lower respiratory tract specimens or a CT scan with a typical appearance of
COVID-19 as defined by the ACR criteria for negative RT-PCR patients​52​. Children and
pregnant women were excluded from the study.

The clinical and laboratory data were obtained from detailed medical records, cleaned and
formatted retrospectively by 10 radiologists with 3 to 20 years of experience (5 radiologists at
GR and 5 at KB). Data include demographic variables: age and sex, variables from the
clinical examination include: body weight and height, body mass index, heart rate, body
temperature, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and a list of symptoms
including cough, sputum, chest pain, muscle pain, abdominal pain or diarrhoea, and
dyspnea. Health and medical history data include presence or absence of comorbidities
(systemic

hypertension,

diabetes

mellitus,

asthma,

heart

disease,

emphysema,

immunodeficiency) and smoker status. Laboratory data include conjugated alanine, bilirubin,
total bilirubin, creatine kinase, CRP, ferritin, haemoglobin, LDH, leucocytes, lymphocyte,
monocyte, platelet, polynuclear neutrophil, and urea.
CT scan acquisition
CT scan data were available for 980 patients representing a total of 506,341 2D images (517
slices per patient on average). Summary statistics for the clinical, biological, and CT scan
data are provided in Table 1.​ ​Three different models of CT scanners were used : two
General Electric CT scanners (Discovery CT750 HD and Optima 660 GE Medical Systems,
Milwaukee, USA) and a Siemens CT scanner (Somatom Drive; Siemens Medical Solutions,
Forchheim). All patients were scanned in a supine position during breath-holding at full
inspiration. The acquisition and reconstruction parameters were of 120kV tube voltage with
automatic tube current modulation (100-350 mAs), 1 mm slice thickness without interslice
gap, using filtered-back-projection (FBP) reconstruction (SOMATOM Drive) or blended

FBP/iterative reconstruction (Discovery or Optima). Axial images with slice thickness of 1
mm were used for coronal and sagittal reconstructions.
Radiology reports
COVID-19 associated CT imaging features were obtained from radiologist reports that follow
the guidelines of several scientific societies of radiology (French SFR, STR, ACR, RSNA)
regarding the reporting of chest CT findings related to COVID-19 52​
​ . The template of the
radiologist
(​https://ebulletin.radiologie.fr/actualites-covid-19/compte-rendu-tdm-thoracique-iv-0​)

report
​was

available the 17th of March and the reports were completed retrospectively for the patients
who were admitted to the hospital before that date. ​CT imaging characteristics were
evaluated to provide the five following variables : (i) ground glass opacity (GGO) (rounded /
non rounded / absent) that is defined as an increase in lung density not sufficient to obscure
vessels or preservation of bronchial and vascular margins, (ii) consolidation (rounded / non
rounded / absent) that occurs when parenchymal opacification is dense enough to obscure
the vessels’ margins and airway walls and other parenchymal structures, (iii) the
crazy-paving pattern (present/absent) that is defined as ground-glass opacification with
associated interlobular septal thickening​53​, (iv) peripheral topography (present/absent) that
corresponds to the spatial distribution of lesions in the one-third external part of the lung, and
(v) inferior predominance (present/absent) that is defined as a predominance of lesions
located in the lower segments of the lung. A rounded pattern (for GGO and consolidation) is
defined as a lesion presenting a well delineated shape. In addition to the five CT imaging
features, radiologists assessed the extent of lung lesions according to the evaluation criteria
established by the French Society of Radiology (SFR)​54​. Disease extent can be: absent /
minimal (<10%) / moderate (10-25%) / extensive (25-50%) / severe (>50%) / critical >75%.
The coding absent / minimal / moderate extensive / severe / critical was based on a
quantitative variable with values of 0 / 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5. Variables were automatically extracted
from the report using ​optical character recognition.
Statistical analysis
When detecting association with the severity outcome, odds ratio and P-values (two-sided
tests) were computed separately for each hospital using logistic regression (​glm function of
the R statistical software). P-values from the two different hospitals were pooled using the
Stouffer meta-analysis formula accounting for the two different sample sizes. For association

between severity and each variable, we considered Bonferroni correction accounting for 58
variables. To compute confidence intervals for AUC values, we considered DeLong
method​55​. Survival functions were obtained using Kaplan-Meier estimators.
Deep learning models for severity classification based of CT scans

​ odel was defined as an ensemble of two sub-models, as illustrated in
The deep learning m
Supp Fig 2. Each sub-model predicted disease severity from CT scans without using any
expert annotations at the slice level. Preprocessing of the data consisted of resizing the CT
scans to a fixed pixel spacing of (0.7mm, 0.7mm, 10mm) and applying a specific windowing
on the HU intensities. Each sub-model is composed of two blocks: a deep neural network
called ​feature extractor and a penalized logistic regression. The two sub-models feature
extractors are EfficientNet-B0​56 pre-trained on the ImageNet public database and
ResNet50​57 pre-trained with MoCo v2​58 on one million CT scan slices from both Deep
Lesion​59 and LIDC​60​. Each of these networks provide an embedding of the slices of the input
CT scans into a lower-dimensional feature space (1280 for EfficientNet-B0 and 2048 for
ResNet50). For the ResNet50-based sub-model, we reduced the dimension of the feature
space using a principal component analysis with 40 components before applying logistic
regression. A different windowing was applied on the CT scans before the feature extractor :
(-1000 HU, 600 HU) for EfficientNet-B0 and (-1000 HU, 0 HU), (0 HU, 1000 HU) and (-1000
HU, 4000 HU) for ResNet50. Predictions of ​AI-severity were obtained by averaging
predictions of the submodels using equal weights. Optimisation of the architecture of the
network (preprocessing, feature extraction or model architecture and training, feature
engineering, model aggregation) was performed using a 5 fold cross validation on the
training set of 646 patients from KB.
CT scans may contain devices such as catheters (EKG monitoring, oxygenation tubing...)
that are easily detectable in a CT and can bias prediction of severity. Indeed, there is a risk
of detecting the presence of a technical device associated with severity instead of detecting
the radiological features associated with severity​61​. In order to ensure that medical devices
do not affect feature extraction, all voxels outside of the lungs were masked using a
pre-trained U-Net lung segmentation algorithm​62​.
Multivariate models to predict severity

The different models that combine multiple features to predict severity were fitted using
logistic regression (​AI-severity,​ ​AI-segment​, ​C & B​, ​C & B & RR)​ . Models were trained using
cross validation with 5 folds on the training dataset of 646 patients from KB, and folds were
stratified by age and severity outcome. Variables that were available for less than 300
patients of the training set (conjugated bilirubin and alanine) were not used. For the
remaining variables, missing values were imputed by the average over patients of the
training set. L2 regularization was applied when fitting logistic regression. The regularization
coefficient was determined by maximizing the average AUC over the 5 cross-validation folds,
using a range of different values ranging from 0.01 to 100. XGBoost algorithm was also
evaluated but did not show better performance than logistic regression. We use pandas and
scikit-learn to manipulate data, train and evaluate machine learning algorithms​63​.
To select variables in the multivariate models, we considered a forward feature selection
technique (Supp Fig 6). The first variable included in the model is the variable which
provides the largest AUC values. Then, we computed AUC values for all models with two
variables including the first one that has already been included. We continued this procedure
until all variables were included. Performances of the models increased quickly when the
first variables were included and then AUC values reached a plateau (Supp Fig 6). We used
the elbow method to select the parsimonious set of variables that is found when a plateau of
AUC is reached. For the three models that include CT-scan information, we consider the
model ​C & B & RR to perform variable selection. The three models (​AI-severity, C & B & RR,
AI-segment​) were then trained using the six variables found with our variable selection
procedure. The variable selection procedure for the ​C & B model that contains clinical and
biological variables only indicated that 10 variables should be kept in the model (see Supp
Table 5 for the list of selected variables).
Other scores to predict severity and mortality

We performed a comparison of the proposed AI-severity model with 11 other COVID-19
severity scores published in the literature: COVID-Gram​6​, 2 scores from Colombi et al.​16​,
CALL​9​, CURB-65​64​, Yan et al.​7​, Liang et al.​65​, NEWS2 and NEWS2 for COVID-19​66​, 4C
mortality score​12​, and MIT analytics (​https://www.covidanalytics.io/mortality_calculator​).
Among these scores, only three included radiological information in their model: the
presence of an X-ray abnormality for COVID-Gram and Liang et al., and the lung disease
extent for Colombi et al.. The number of considered clinical and biological variables for these

scores varied (from 3 for Yan et al. to 14 for NEWS2 for COVID), as well as the model
architecture (simple scoring system, logistic regression, xgboost or multilayer perceptron),
and the outcome they were trained on (such as death or admission to ICU). Notable
variation between scores include the definition of comorbidities and details about how it has
been computed for the different scores are provided in Supp Table 6. For missing variables,
we manually imputed the missing variables with a constant value (Supp Table 6). Due to the
poor performances of one of the score​7​, we retrained their score by repeating their training
procedure with the KB development cohort.
