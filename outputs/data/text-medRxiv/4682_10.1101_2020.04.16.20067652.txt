Abstract
After reaching the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, many regions are in search of a reopening
plan that would minimize resurgence. Here we show to prevent resurgence local governments
need to estimate how early and how many COVID-19 cases can be detected. It is safe to end
social distancing if the majority of cases are detected early in the infection window. If cases are
detected later, a 2-layer quarantine may be necessary to prevent resurgence. If fewer cases are
detected, community events, schools, and large businesses may need to remain in virtual mode.
Our results demonstrate that detecting more cases earlier is essential for preventing COVID-19
resurgence.

COVID-19 is an infectious disease with asymptomatic carriers1,2. An estimated 25%-43% of
COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic3,4 (Fig. 1). In symptomatic cases, the disease can be
transmitted 1-2 days before the onset of symptoms1,2 (Fig. 1). Asymptomatic transmission makes
COVID-19 challenging to track and study. Unless everyone takes the test, only a portion of
COVID-19 cases can be detected and quarantined (Fig. 1). Limited detection also makes
estimating the reproduction number of COVID-19 more challenging than other infectious
diseases such as SARS. How to prevent the resurgence of infectious disease with asymptomatic
carriers is an open and urgent question.

To address this question, we developed a microsimulation model5,6 where only a portion of cases
is detected and quarantined. Disease carrier is infectious between days 5 and 14 post-infection1,2
(Fig. 1). Between days 6 and 14, some carriers are detected by testing (Fig. 1), resulting in the
quarantine of confirmed carriers and their close contacts. We applied this model to a hypothetical

region similar to Massachusetts, with 6.8 million residents, 3.9 million employees, and 2.5
million households (Fig. S1). Patient 0 was introduced on February 26 at a company conference;
K-12 schools and colleges were closed on March 14; non-essential works were shut down on
March 22 (Fig. S2).

We performed multiple tests to validate this model. First, we compared the number of cases in
the simulation to the number of confirmed cases reported by the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health (MDPH). Because the latter depends on testing availability and turnaround time, it
sets a lower bound of actual cases approximately one week before the report date (Fig. S3).
Second, we compared the number of deaths predicted by the simulation to the number of deaths
reported by MDPH. Although the reported deaths is also subject to undercounting7, it provides
an estimate of actual cases 1-2 weeks before the report date (Fig. S4). Here we assumed the
death rate is ~1% as reported in Korea, where extensive testing started early in the outbreak.
Third, our model predicts a peak date of reported cases on April 24 (Fig. S5). The prediction was
made on April 15, posted on April 198, and is consistent with the peak between April 23 and
April 25 reported by MDPH (Fig. S6). The University of Washington model
(covid19.healthdata.org accessed on April 15) predicted a peak date of resource use on April 28
(Fig. S7). Fourth, our model predicts a total death of 9,106 by August 5th, 11% more than the
University of Washington model (Fig. S7). As of April 30, Massachusetts has seen 3,562 deaths,
a figure that is likely an undercount7. Fifth, our model predicts a serial interval of 5.04 +/- 0.04
days, consistent with the reported interval of 4.4-7.5 days1. Last, our model predicts a
reproduction number of 5.96 +/- 0.18. This number is higher than the COVID-19 estimate1,9

based on the early outbreak in Wuhan, where testing was limited. This is also higher than
SARS10,11. Therefore, we modeled a disease that is more infectious than SARS.

According to the model, the reopening plan needs to be made based on estimated Pd, the
percentage of cases detected, and tq, the time quarantine starts. The higher the Pd, the lower the
tq, the less restrictive the reopening plan needs to be (Fig. 2). Social distancing can be lifted if
70% of cases can be detected, and quarantine starts within one week of infection (Fig. 2 and 3).
These conditions are difficult, if not impossible, to satisfy. Pd = 70% requires detection of most,
if not all, symptomatic cases since asymptomatic cases account for 25% or more of total cases of
COVID-193,4. tq = 7d requires quarantine to start within 1-2 days of the onset of symptoms.

tq is an often neglected but critical variable. tq determines whether 2-layer quarantine is

necessary. If social distancing measures are lifted, but quarantine does not start within ten days
of infection, a 100% detection rate is not sufficient to prevent resurgence (Fig. 2 and 3c). In
general, the number of layers required is determined by two timescales: tq, the time when
quarantine starts, and ti, the time when the patient becomes infectious. ti, according to recent
studies, is 4-5 days1,2. Currently, it can take another 4-5 days altogether for the test to come back
positive and for public health officials to reach close contacts. At the time quarantine starts (tq),
the disease might have spread from the first layer of contacts to the next layer (Fig. 3a s).

In our model, 2-layer quarantine requires not only the confirmed carrier and its close contacts,
but also their workplace, schools, homes, and communities to be quarantined. This additional
layer leads to 950 +/- 69 quarantines per confirmed case. Nevertheless, at any given time, only a
small percentage of the total population is under quarantine (Fig. S8).

In addition to 2-layer quarantine, schools, large businesses, and community events may need to
be restricted if not enough cases are detected. If 70% of cases are detected, no restriction is
necessary as long as 2-layer quarantine starts on day 8 (Figs. 1 and 4). If 60% of cases are
detected, schools and businesses can reopen, but community events need to be restricted (Fig. 4).
Community contacts outside schools, work, and home account for ~30% of daily contacts12 (Fig.
S3).

If 30% of cases are detected, schools and large businesses (>2000 employees in our model) need
to remain in virtual mode (Fig. 4). Due to their large size, schools and large businesses are hot
spots for disease transmission. In our model, students are 66% +/- 12% more likely to transmit
the disease than the rest of the population. Employees of large businesses, 94% +/- 5%.
According to the model, had schools, large businesses, and community activities been shut down
on March 3, the outbreak in Massachusetts would be limited to 3220 +/- 650 people and peaked
by March 31 (Fig. S9).

Here we show the probability of resurgence for a given reopening open depends on Pd, the
percentage of cases detected, and tq, the time quarantine starts (Fig. 1). This conclusion is based
on the microsimulations of a hypothetical region similar to Massachusetts. To use the model for
policymaking, however, it needs to be refined by local government records on population,
employment, school, business, household, etc. The model can also be updated in the future as
more data on disease transmission become available. The model can also be custom-built for
regions other than Massachusetts. Nevertheless, for any given region, the more cases detected,
the earlier quarantine starts, the less restrictive the reopening plan is expected to be.

The resurgence of infectious disease has significant impacts on public health and the economy.
At the initial stage of reopening, it is safer to assume only a small percentage of cases (Pd = 30%
or less) are detected late in the infectious window (tq = day 8 or later). In order to increase Pd, it
may be necessary to (i) test all symptomatic patients, (ii) test all close contacts of confirmed
cases, and (iii) screen high-risk populations routinely. To decrease tq, besides utilizing fast
COVID-19 tests and contact tracking apps, it is also essential to consider the psychological and

economic burden of testing and quarantine13. One possibility to offset such burdens is to issue
stimulus checks to individuals and businesses affected by quarantines. 100,000 checks a day,
$250 per check, cost $25million, which corresponds to 1.5% of daily GDP in Massachusetts14.
100,000 COVID-19 tests a day cost $5million15, or 0.3% of daily GDP. Therefore, encouraging
more COVID-19 tests earlier is a small investment with a high return.

Methods
Disease transmission
In our microsimulation model, the disease spreads through three types of contacts. Contacts at
school/work, home/residence, and community events account for 37%, 34%, and 29% of total
contacts, respectively. This ratio is consistent with a recent study of social contacts in European
countries12.

Each disease carrier makes up to four contacts at school/work every workday, three contacts at
home/residence every night, and four contacts in a community event (see section regionspecificity). The probability of infection upon contact is a free parameter in the model. We set it
to 45%. This value is constrained by (i) the number of confirmed cases and (ii) the number of
deaths reported by MDPH, and (iii) the number of conference attendees with COVID-19
symptoms reported by Biogen on March 316.

Detection and quarantine
Our model follows the timeline of the COVID-19 outbreak in Massachusetts. Once a case is
detected, the disease carrier and its contacts are subject to quarantine. The number of detected
cases between February 26 and April 9 is set by the number of confirmed reported daily by
MDPH. Between April 10 and the reopen date (see section reopen), the number of detected cases
is determined by min(2151, Pd*N). 2151 is the number of confirmed cases on April 9, Pd is the
probability of detection, and N is the number of disease carriers between days 8 and 14 postinfection. After the reopen date, the number of detected cases is determined by Pd*N’, where N’
is the number of disease carriers on days tq post-infection. We assumed that disease carriers

under quarantine no longer go to work, school, community events, but continue to make contacts
at home.

For 1-layer quarantine, contacts of the confirmed carrier between the day of infection and the day
of detection are subject to quarantine. In comparison, 2-layer quarantine requires the school,
workplace, home, and communities of the confirmed carrier and its contacts to be quarantined as
well. In theory, it is possible to reduce the 2nd layer to close contacts of the 1st layer. However,
this reduction would increase the workload of MDPH and might delay the start of quarantine. A
slight delay might allow the virus to spread to the next layer and cause significant resurgence.

Region-specificity
There are 9,000 daycares, 2,400 K-12 schools, and 100 colleges, with a total of 1.93 million
students (see table 1). These numbers are estimated based on publicly available data on age
distribution, student enrollment, and student/teacher ratio. They can be refined by local
government records.

There are 197,715 employers with a total of 3.9 million employees (see table 2). Small (<19
employees), middle (20-99), large (100-499), and extra-large (500+) employers, account for
18%, 17%, 15%, and 50% of total workforce, respectively. This ratio is consistent with the
national distribution of employer size17.

There are 2.5 million households with 6.8 million residents (see table 3). Residents are randomly
assigned to households. The household assignment is independent of the school/employer
assignment.

Patient zero
We introduced patient zero in a large company (with 2,000 employees) on February 26,
consistent with the COVID-19 outbreak in Massachusetts16. A conference organized by a Biogen
between February 26 and 27 led to a dramatic increase of confirmed cases in the state16. We
assumed that patient zero made eight contacts daily during the conference. That is two times the
default number of contacts at work. This temporary doubling of contacts is needed to reproduce
(i) an estimate of 50 conference attendees with flu-like symptoms on March 2 reported by
Biogen16 and (ii) the dramatic increase of confirmed cases reported by MDPH the following
week.

Closure of school, business, and community
In our model, schools, community events, and businesses with more than 25 employees (except
essential businesses) are closed on March 14. These closures are consistent with orders by
Governor Baker and public announcements of schools, businesses, and event organizers. Upon
closure, the disease can no longer transmit through these schools, businesses, and community
events. In our model, all non-essential businesses are closed on March 22. Afterward, only
516,000 essential workers are allowed to work. In our model, the probability of infection is
reduced by 50% on April 3. During that week, (i) CDC recommended wearing mask or facecovering; (ii) local grocery stores started to limit the number of customers inside the store; (iii)
signs urging social distancing of 6 feet and redirecting foot traffic appeared in public places. We
simulated the possible scenario that the probability of infection rebounds after reopening. If the
probability is set to the default value of 45%, resurgence can still be prevented. For a given
reopening plan, it requires more cases to be detected earlier.

Validation of the model
In order to compare our model to the number of confirmed cases reported by MDPH, we
assumed that cases are reported seven days after infection. This delay accounts for the incubation
period (5-6 days1,2), consulting the primary care physician, ordering the test, and receiving the
result. We assumed that confirmed deaths are reported 11 days after infection.

To calculate the serial interval, we analyzed all incidences, in which the disease is transmitted
from a sender to a receiver. For each incidence, we calculated how long after the infection of the
sender, the receiver is infected with the disease. We then averaged over all such incidences.

To calculate the reproduction number, we divided the number of infected people by the number
of senders, before the closure of school, business, and community.

To quantify the likelihood of disease transmission by people affiliated with (i) schools, (ii) large
businesses, and (iii) rest of the population, we calculated the number of senders in each
population and then normalized by the size of the population.

Reopen
In our model, reopening occurs when the total number of infected people does not change
compared to the previous day. At the time of reopening, there are disease carriers who are
infectious and yet to be detected.
