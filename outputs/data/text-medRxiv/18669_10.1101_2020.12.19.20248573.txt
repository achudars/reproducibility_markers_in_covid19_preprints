Abstract
Background: To break the chains of SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission and contain the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, population‐wide testing is practiced in various countries. However, scant
research has addressed this topic in Japan.
Materials and Methods: In this modelling exercise, we extracted the number of daily reported cases
of COVID‐19 in Okinawa from October 1 to November 30, 2020 and explored possible scenarios for
decreasing COVID‐19 incidence by combining population‐wide screening and/or social distancing
policy.
Results: We reveal that permanent lockdown can be replaced by mass testing that mobilizes
sufficient target population at an adequate frequency. In addition, solely imposing a circuit breaker
will not bring a favorable outcome in the long‐term, and mass testing presents implications for
minimizing a period of lockdown.
Discussion: Our results highlight the importance of incentivizing citizens to join the frequent testing
and ensure their appropriate isolation. To contain the COVID‐19 pandemic, rigorous investment in
public health is manifestly vital.

Introduction
To combat against the surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) cases and break chains of SARS‐
CoV‐2 transmission, many countries imposed various non‐pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in
2020. Especially, an unprecedented lockdown of cities, regions, and countries highly contributed to
suppress the virus [1]. Although the economic loss and social burden on citizens, especially vulnerable
populations, were critically featured, and there has been a dispute on how to leverage socio‐
economic activities with infection control measures in many countries that employed suppression or
mitigation strategies, it becomes evident that economic activities were subdued by social distancing
policy, even at a voluntary basis [2]. On the contrary, some countries or regions in the Western Pacific
Region, such as China, Taiwan, Vietnam or New Zealand, advanced for aggressively suppressing or
eliminating COVID‐19, and have started to boost their socio‐economic activities [3]. Australia is
currently at the final phase for eliminating community‐acquired infection under its aggressive
suppression strategy.
To contain the COVID‐19 pandemic, symptom‐based strategy is not feasible due to its large
proportion of asymptomatic infections [4], and many countries rapidly ramped up the testing
capacity, expanded testing targets, and arranged logistics for rigorous contact‐tracing and isolation.
There has been an argument that weekly testing for the entire population, followed by contact‐
tracing and quarantine, can break chains of transmission within a few weeks [5], and population‐wide
testing has been practiced in various ways [6]. China utilized a mass testing approach for early
containment [7,8], and some European countries have started to employ it through a novel approach.
Slovakia spearheaded for screening over 3.6 million persons, and mass testing with other NPIs
successfully reduced the prevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2 [9]. The United Kingdom firstly kicked off the trial
of mass testing in Liverpool by a lateral flow test, and positive cases were followed by confirmatory
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) testing [10]. Other countries, such as South
Tyrol/Alto Adige in Italy, Austria and Slovenia, has already conducted or will implement similar
approaches.
While many Asian‐Pacific countries have rigorously contained the COVID‐19, Japan has been
employing the suppression strategy. While maintaining the reproduction number at least below 1
will be vital in this strategy, the government kept neglecting its evolution [11]. Rather than
strengthening additional countermeasures for high‐risk environments, imposing social distancing
policies and ensuring citizens’ access to testing, the government boosted multiple “go to” campaigns
[12]. As a result, the spread of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus has been accelerated to the entire nation. Some
clusters of COVID‐19 have already been reported from remote islands in Hokkaido or Okinawa
prefectures.
After lifting the nationwide state of emergency in early May, Okinawa prefecture, whose population
amounts to 1.46 million with 148 remote islands, aggressively suppressed the virus, and the number
of COVID‐19 cases was maintained almost zero in May‐June 2020; however, there were insufficient
efforts for expanding testing targets to truly eliminate the virus. This, along with the importation
from other prefectures and COVID‐19 outbreak in U.S. military bases, brought a resurgence in late
July, and necessitated local state of emergency in August. After lifting it, the grand strategy has
obscurely revised. Now Okinawa has been again facing an increase of COVID‐19, and the purpose of
this study is to explore possible scenarios for decreasing its incidence by combining population‐wide
testing and/or social distancing policy.

Materials and Methods
Model
In the numerical simulation, we used an SEIQR compartmental model as in [13], in which the
susceptible, exposed (asymptomatic infectious), infectious, quarantined and recovered populations
are considered. As in [13], we assumed that, for COVID‐19, the average incubation period is 5 days
[14], the average infectious period is 10 days [15], the average quarantine period is 14 days and the
reproduction numbers for asymptomatic and symptomatic infections are 0.44 R and 0.56 R,
respectively [16], where R denotes the reproduction number. To estimate R in Okinawa, we applied
the least‐squares method as in [17] under the assumption that the identification rate is 0.1 to the
data of number of daily reported cases of COVID‐19 in Okinawa from October 1 to November 30,
2020. We then obtained R=1.22, and the asymptotic and symptomatic infection rates were calculated
as in [13]. The sensitivity and specificity in usual diagnosis were assumed as 90% and 100%,
respectively [18]. In the pulsed mass testing that screens infectiousness among citizens people, which
is described in the next subsection, we assumed a perfect test sensitivity for detecting infectious
individuals regardless of their symptoms, specificity and compliance with quarantine, as illustrated
in another modelling study of population‐wide screening [9].

Multiple scenarios
We simulated multiple scenarios under the assumption that the pulsed mass testing and lockdown
started on December 8, 2020. On the mass testing, we assumed that the testing is periodically carried
out per 7/14/30 days to 5/25/50% of the whole population in Okinawa. On the other hand, we also
simulated a scenario that the daily self‐testing is carried out on weekdays to 1/5/10% of the whole
population in Okinawa. Consequently, we obtained four figures (see the next section) for the
following scenarios.
i) Mass testing with testing rate 5% per 7/14/30 days;
ii) Mass testing with testing rate 25% per 7/14/30 days;
iii) Mass testing with testing rate 50% per 7/14/30 days;
iv) Daily self‐testing with testing rate 1/5/10%.
In addition, in each scenario, we considered three cases of social distancing policies that decreased
social contacts by 50%, and the duration of lockdown was classified into three patterns: no lockdown:
circuit breaker where the lockdown ends after 4 weeks; and the permanent lockdown.

Results
Multiple scenarios of mass testing towards 5%. 25%, and 50% of whole population in Okinawa at
different intervals are presented in Figures 1‐3. The number of daily reported cases will exponentially
increase without mass testing or lockdown. While imposing the circuit breaker can curb the epidemic,
it is not sufficient to aggressively suppress the virus; therefore, to decrease the number of patients,
mass testing at appropriate intervals must be combined. The permanent lockdown will decrease
COVID‐19 cases, and its period will be shortened by simultaneously implementing mass testing.
Figure 1 clearly exhibits that mass testing for 5% of all citizens in Okinawa is not sufficient to curb an
increasing number of daily reported cases, even when mass testing is conducted on a weekly basis
or combined with circuit breaker (Figure 1).
This tendency slightly changes when 25% of whole population in Okinawa are screened, as presented
in Figure 2. When the lockdown is not a policy option, mass testing per 14 days will curb an increasing
trend; however, each mass testing continuously reports more than 1,000 cases for a few months.
When implementing mass testing per 7 days, an increasing trend will be reversed; however, it must
be debatable in terms of health system capacity. Obviously, a frequent testing will hugely contribute
to breaking chains of transmission, and vividly decreasing the reported number of COVID‐19 per mass
testing. Even without lockdown, the number of people tested positive will decrease to below 100
after April. When combined with the circuit breaker, the number will be decreased to below 100 in
early February (Figure 2).
Figure 3 illustrates scenarios of mass testing that targets 50% of all citizens. Even monthly mass
testing will quell an increasing trend of transmission; however, it should be noted that even in April,
more than 1,000 cases will be reported. Mass testing per 14 days will truly curb the epidemic, and
the decreasing trend will be accelerated by simultaneously implementing mass testing and imposing
a circuit breaker. When the weekly mass testing is performed without lockdown, it will promptly
impact on crashing transmission dynamics, and record less than 10 cases in late‐February. This period
can be shortened to early February when combined with circuit breaker. Figure 3A and Figure 3C also
suggest that weekly mass testing for 50% of entire population will not only overturn an increasing
trend of COVID‐19 patients but bring a similar effect that can be gained by simply imposing a
permanent lockdown (Figure 3).
Figure 4 presents the evolution of daily reported cases when the testing is conducted on a daily basis.
Our results show that daily testing towards 1% of all citizens is not sufficient to hammer an increasing
trend of daily reported cases without permanent lockdown. When 5% of all citizens are targeted, the
number of reported cases will gradually decrease but it will record over 100 cases even in March:
therefore, this scenario needs to be carefully considered in terms of health system capacity. When
10% of all citizens were tested on a daily basis, the number of daily reported cases will reach below
10 in late February. When combined with circuit breaker, daily testing towards 1% of all citizens is
not enough to turn the tide; but expanding more than 5% of all citizens will be effective to decrease
the number of daily reported cases (Figure 4).

Discussion
Our modelling exercise revealed three major findings. First, there is a scenario that permanent
lockdown can be averted by population‐wide testing. If the mass testing covers 50% of all citizens on
a weekly basis, the number of COVID‐19 cases will reach nearly zero in mid‐March. Even when the
project is conducted through daily testing approach and targets 10% of all citizens, it will also
contribute to decreasing COVID‐19 cases and the new COVID‐19 cases will reach nearly zero in early
April. As mass testing that targets 5% of all citizens at a weekly basis or daily testing for 1% of all
citizens will not change the deteriorating trend, mobilizing sufficient target population will be vital.
Second, a frequent mass testing will be crucial to curb the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic in Okinawa,
even when the current test‐trace‐isolate systems are maintained. Monthly screening will not bring a
decrease of COVID‐19 infections, and an adequate frequency needs to be ensured. Third, mass
testing presents implications for minimizing a period of lockdown. To truly reverse an increasing
trend of COVID‐19, circuit breaker, namely a short‐term lockdown, must be combined with
population‐wide screening for sufficient population. Solely imposing a circuit breaker will not bring a
favorable outcome in the long‐term.
Our results are in line with other latest evidence. As pre‐symptomatic and asymptomatic infections
contribute to the whole transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 [19], intervening these infections through
regular essential medical services is challenging. Considering the natural history of SARS‐CoV‐2
infection [20], and high transmissibility from asymptomatic or pre‐symptomatic infections [21, 22],
capturing these infected individuals is a critical topic. In fact, some universities in the United States
have already started to implement a frequent RT‐PCR screening test [23‐25]. In addition, frequent
use of rapid, inexpensive tests, which show lower sensitivity but become positive when the virus load
is high, is assumed to be a game changer [26,27], and modelling studies support this presumption
[28,29]. While Japan urgently needs to expand the RT‐PCR testing capacity for diagnosing patients
[11], screening essential workers [12], and raising preparedness for other health emergencies in the
near future, using appropriate rapid testing kits for detecting high transmissible cases will be
necessary. Moreover, our results indicate that implementing a population‐wide screening during a
period of circuit breaker will accelerate a decreasing trend of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. While this study
assumed that only people tested positive would be isolated, because the tracing capacity in Japan
has already been overwhelmed, utilizing a population‐wide screening as an opportunity for mass
isolation and quarantine will aggressively reduce the transmission. In fact, a recent case study from
Slovakia [9] suggested that population‐wide screening, even conducted only a few times, can be
beneficial for detecting infectious individuals, appropriately isolating people who were tested
positive, quarantining their close‐contacts, and breaking chains of transmission. If managed
appropriately, this approach can contribute to minimizing the period of lockdown, thus mitigating
the impact of social‐distancing policy on socio‐economic activities.
Five operational challenges must be noted. First, incentivizing public participation will be exigent.
Discrimination against COVID‐19 patients and healthcare workers and insufficient capacity in health
communication will be eminent barriers [30]. Second, a limited testing capacity and weak logistics in
procuring personal protective equipment will be demanding. Adopting a pooling strategy [31‐33] will
dramatically dilate Japan’s testing capacity and make it possible to repeatedly provide RT‐PCR testing.
Importing appropriate testing kits for truly recognizing infectiousness based on the previous
discussion [34] will be a policy option, although it can be a debatable political choice in terms of
health security. Third, the feasibility of mass screening schemes is completely different by context
[35]. Discussing advantages and disadvantages of a home‐based approach, testing tools, and intervals

of mass testing will be vital. While the false‐positive result was not a critical matter in population‐
wide screening in Slovakia [9], it will be sensible if positive cases detected by rapid tests are followed
by confirmatory PCR testing. Fourth, our results suggested the necessity of launching shelter
hospitals (i.e., isolation facilities). These will not only work for truly breaking chains of transmission
and avoiding additional transmissions (e.g., household transmission), but lessen additional burden
on tertiary referral hospitals. Fifth, social support, including financial scheme for positive cases, must
be ensured with a political will to contain the pandemic. This is crucial to truly achieve a high
compliance of isolation. Expanding the public support towards close contacts of patients will improve
their compliance.
There are several limitations in this modelling exercise. First, the heterogeneity of COVID‐19 infection
is not considered. The heterogeneity of the offspring distribution of secondary infection of COVID‐19
is recognized [36,37], and intervention in high‐risk environments will be effective for preventing
superspreading events [38]. We launched this modelling exercise with concerns that a great number
of essential workers, even healthcare workers at hospitals and nursing homes, still cannot access to
regular protective screening in Japan [12]. Opportunities for population‐wide testing can be
beneficial for ensuring their access to testing. Second, the management of prefectural borders is not
considered. However, as Okinawa prefecture has no land bridge except the U.S. Military Bases and
Facilities on Okinawa Island and Its Vicinity, test‐based strategy at its prefectural border can be easily
implemented compared to other prefectures. Third, our modelling did not strongly address the
importance of contact‐tracing. While this assumption is plausible in that the tracing capacity in public
health centers has been overwhelmed in Japan [11,39], the population‐wide testing followed by
contact tracing activities, even limited ones, will contribute to further reducing transmission. Fourth,
we assumed that the lockdown would decrease social contacts by 50%. Considering that the state of
emergency in Japan in April has been declared under the assumption that social contacts will be
decreased between 70% and 80% [11], our assumptions can be strengthened.
Despite these limitations, our modelling exercise presented several implications for the deteriorating
situation of COVID‐19 in Okinawa, Japan. To end this pandemic, revive socio‐economic activities and
protect citizens’ lives and livelihoods, rigorous investment in public health is manifestly vital [40,41].
Testing obviously plays a vital role in containing the virus, and aggressive, widespread testing can
capture more asymptomatic cases. Actually, countries advanced for near‐elimination conducted
more testing per case [42]. Population‐wide screening has been previously practiced for early
containment or elimination [7,8], and some countries in Europe started to employ this approach with
their own social distancing policies. Our exercise implies that repeated mass testing that targets
sufficient population will be a policy option to avoid the lockdown. However, if there are limitations
for promptly conducting a mass testing, early introduction of a tight circuit breaker, followed by solid
logistics for mass screening, will be critical to contain the pandemic. While expanding the RT‐PCR
testing capacity and ensuring citizens’ access to testing must be utmost important, critical roles of
mass screening must be reconsidered for promptly detecting highly infectious individuals, protecting
positive cases, breaking further transmission dynamics, and containing the pandemic.
