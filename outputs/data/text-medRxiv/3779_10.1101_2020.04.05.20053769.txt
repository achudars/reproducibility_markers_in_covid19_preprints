Abstract
Risk indicators viral load (ORF1ab Ct), lymphocyte percentage (LYM%),
C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT) and lactic
acid (LA) in COVID-19 patients have been proposed in recent studies.
However, the predictive effects of those indicators on disease classification
and prognosis remains largely unknown. We dynamically measured those
reported indicators in 132 cases of COVID-19 patients including the
moderate-cured (moderated and cured), severe-cured (severe and cured) and
critically ill (died). Our data showed that CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM%, lactic acid and
viral load could predict prognosis and guide classification of COVID-19
patients in different degrees. CRP, IL-6 and LYM% were more effective than
other three factors in predicting prognosis. For disease classification, CRP and
LYM% were sensitive in identifying the types between critically ill and severe
(or moderate). Notably, among the investigated factors, LYM% was the only
one that could distinguish between the severe and moderate types.
Collectively, we concluded that LYM% was the most sensitive and reliable
predictor for disease typing and prognosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
the precise classification and prognosis prediction are critical for saving the
insufficient medical resources, stratified treatment and improving the survival
rate of critically ill patients. We recommend that LYM% be used independently
or in combination with other indicators in the management of COVID-19.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infective disease
caused

by

severe

acute

respiratory

syndrome

coronavirus

(SARS-CoV-2)[1-2]. This pandemic has been spreading worldwide rapidly
since March 2020. It was reported that more than 500,000 individuals had
been diagnosed and this disease caused over 20,000 deaths at late of March
2020. The rapidly increased cases lead to overload of public healthcare
sources and a run on medical facilities[3]. The severity of patients with
COVID-19 can be divided into 4 levels, i.e. mild, moderate, severe and critical
according to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis Program (5th edition)
published by the National Health Commission of China[4]. Current experience
reveals that most of infected people (approx. over 80%) are not severe and
can get self-healing, only a small part of cases should be carefully treated and
hospitalized[5-8]. However, the mortality among the severe, especially the
critical patients, is quite high, thus it is critical to screen out reliable predictors
for severity of patients to get better outcomes and to save medical sources.
Several factors including viral load[9-10], lymphocytes[11-12], C-reactive
protein (CRP)[8, 13], interleukin-6 (IL-6)[14-15], procalcitonin (PCT)[16-17]
and lactic acid[7, 17] have been identified as warning indicators of prognosis in
COVID-19 patients in recent studies from different cohorts of patients.
However, it is still elusive that which of these factors are the most effective and
reliable indicators for predicting the prognosis of COVID-19 in the early stage.

Besides, the indicators for disease classification were also urgently needed. In
the present study, basing on the clinical information of 132 patients with
COVID-19, we will compare and validate the predictive power of several
reported risk factors of prognosis in COVID-19 in a descriptive manner.
Methods
Patient information
All cases were taken from the General Hospital of Central Theater Command
(Wuhan, Hubei province, People’s Republic of China). This study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the hospital. All subjects signed informed
consent forms at admission to hospital. A total of 132 patients hospitalized
between January 14, 2020 and March 14, 2020 were investigated, of which 96
cured cases were moderate type (moderate-cured), 21 cured cases were
severe type (severe-cured) and 15 dead cases were critically ill type (critically
ill-died). The gender and age information of those patients were presented in
Table S1 and S2. All patients were confirmed by viral detections of
SARS-CoV-2 via oropharyngeal swabs using quantitative RT-PCR for
ORF1ab[18], which ruled out infection by other respiratory viruses such as
influenza virus A, influenza virus B, coxsackie virus, respiratory syncytial virus,
parainfluenza virus and enterovirus.
Disease classification
All cases were diagnosed and classified according to the New Coronavirus
Pneumonia Diagnosis Program (5th edition) published by the National Health

Commission of China[4]. Clinical manifestations consist of four categories,
mild, moderate, severe and critically ill. The mild clinical symptom were mild
with no pulmonary inflammation on imaging. The moderate is the
overwhelming majority, showing symptoms of respiratory infections such as
fever, cough, and sputum, and pulmonary inflammation on imaging; when
symptoms of dyspnea appear, including any of the following: shortness of
breath, RR ≥ 30bpm, blood oxygen saturation ≤ 93% (at rest), PaO2 / FiO2 ≤
300 mmHg, or pulmonary inflammation that progresses significantly within 24
to 48 hours> 50%, it was classified as severe; respiratory failure, shock, and
organ failures that require intensive care were critically ill. Among them, mild
patients were not admitted in this designated hospital.
Data collection
In this study, the basic information, complete blood count, serum biochemical
test, inflammatory indicators, viral load and disease outcome of all included
patients were collected dynamically.
Statistical methods
In this study, GraphPad 8.01 software was used for data statistics and
mapping. Data were expressed as the means±s.e.ms. and were analyzed
using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test. For each parameter of all data
presented, * indicates P< 0.05, ** indicates P<0.01 and *** indicates P<0.005..

To investigate the mortality-associated risk factors, COVID-19 patients were
classified into cured and died groups (Table S1). The serum levels of CRP,
PCT, IL-6, percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%), lactic acid and Ct values of
viral tests were measured dynamically. The levels of CRP in peripheral blood
increased quickly after the symptom onset and further increased to the end
around 4 weeks later in the dead cases, while the levels of CRP in survivors
fluctuated very little (Fig. 1A). Similar trend was obtained for the PCT level,
although it just began to increase 25 days after disease onset (Fig. 1B). The
blood IL-6 levels in dead cases increased rapidly in the early phase and rose
to an extraordinary level before death (Fig. 1C). In contrast, after the symptom
onset, the LYM% in dead cases deceased quickly and sustained in a low level
(Fig. 1D). For the levels of blood lactic acid, there was a narrow time window in
which we could distinguish the died and cured groups (Fig. 1E). From 8 days
after disease onset, the pre-died patients had an obviously higher levels of
viral load indicated by ORF1ab Ct values than the survivors did (Fig. 1F).
Taken together, indicators CRP, PCT IL-6, LYM% and viral load could predict
the mortality risk in different degrees. IL-6, LYM% and CRP are sensitive
indicators because obvious changes of those factors in the early phase (2 or 4
days after disease onset) were identified between the cured and died groups
(Fig. 1G). In addition, those three indicators had a long time window in
distinguishing cured and died cases, which could ensure the accuracy of the
forecast(Fig. 1G).

Validating the indicators for classifying the critically ill and severe types
in COVID-19
The initiation and duration of difference in some indicator between two groups
are the key to judge the disease types. In distinguishing between the critically
ill and severe groups, the initial day of difference for indicators CRP, PCT, IL-6,
LYM%, lactic acid and ORF1ab Ct was 4, 25, 2, 3, 12 and 11, respectively (Fig.
2A-G). The duration of difference for indicators CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM%, lactic
acid and ORF1ab Ct was 4-, 25-, 22-, 8-, 12-24 and 19-, respectively (Fig.
2A-G). These results indicated that CRP, IL-6 and LYM% were more sensitive
and reliable than other three indicators for disease typing between the critically
ill and severe.
Validating the indicators for classifying the critically ill and moderate
COVID-19 patients
To study the indicators classifying the critically ill and moderate patients, those
two types of patients were enrolled. The initial day of difference for indicators
CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM% and ORF1ab Ct was 4, 25, 2, 2 and 8, respectively (Fig.
3A-F). The duration of difference for indicators CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM% and
ORF1ab Ct was 4-, 25-, 22-, 2- and 8-, respectively (Fig. 3A-F). Taken together,
CRP and LYM% were more effective in typing the critically ill and moderate
cases.

For the indicators of the severe and moderate types, the initial day of
difference for indicators CRP, IL-6, LYM% and ORF1ab Ct was 5, 6, 1 and 8,
respectively. In contrast, there were totally no difference of PCT levels in both
groups (Fig. 4A-F). Noteworthily, the duration of difference for CRP and LYM%
was 9-20 and 9-26, respectively, while PCT, IL-6 and ORF1ab Ct had no
continuous time window for differentiation (Fig. 4A-F). These results indicated
that LYM% was the only indicator among those 5 factors for the typing of
severe and moderate patients.
Discussion
Given the worldwide prevalence of COVID-19, disease typing and
prognostic indicators are of great significance in guiding classified treatment,
preventing medical runs and saving critical patients. In this study, we selected
several reported risk factors for prognosis of COVID-19 patients and further
validated their predictive roles in disease outcome and classification. This is
the first study reporting CRP, PCT, IL-6, lactic acid, ORF1ab Ct and LYM% as
indicators for different types of patients with COVID-19.
We validated that the LYM% could be a permissible predictor to identify
critically ill, severe and moderate cases. Previous studies also supported the
conclusion that lymphocyte count and function were closely related to the
disease status of COVID-19[11, 19]. Patients with insufficient immunity,
including the elders and people with immunodeficiency, always presented a
lower level of lymphocytes and a worse prognosis after infected with

SARS-CoV-2[7, 20]. In addition, the relative stability of LYM% in each patients
and less overlap among groups with different severity during the progression
of COVID-19 made this indicator a potential good predictor.
Notably, as we described above, the serum levels of IL-6 and CRP
presented with a zigzag curve during the whole course of disease in critically ill
patients. We speculated that this obvious change may be caused by the
medical intervention. Interestingly, the changes of serum levels of these two
markers in moderate and sever patients were much more stable and lower
than those in critical patients. These results indicated that refractory
inflammatory reaction can be identified in early stage of this disease and
predict a poor outcome. Patients with this feature should be brought to the
forefront in early stage. In clinical practice, the curve of inflammatory indicators
should be draw dynamically, like body temperature.
The higher levels of inflammatory indicators and the lower level of LYM%
leads to another interesting question: whether the “storm” of inflammatory
cytokines is due to the impaired lymphocytes, such as T cells. As we know,
some of T cells, i.e. Treg, are responsible for inflammatory regulation[21-22].
The impaired function of Treg cells may contribute to the uncontrolled
inflammation in critical patients. It should be noted that in the late stage of
dead cases, all the levels of proinflammatory indicators, LYM% and lactic acid
had an acute increase (Fig. 1A-E). This phenomenon indicated an absolute
disorder of inflammation, immunity and metabolism in those dying patients.

Persistently low levels of Ct values in viral tests indicated sustained high
levels of viral load in the critically ill patients[10]. However, it should be noted
that there were no obvious differences in the duration of viral shedding
between the severe and non-severe patients, which was consistent with a
previous study[7]. Recently, we reported a moderate patient with long duration
of viral shedding for 49 days. This phenomenon was in line with the
asymptomatic infection, which was reported in some population[23-24].
Conclusion
In the present study, basing on the information of 132 patients with COVID-19,
we analyzed the predictive power of several reported indicators for disease
severity and prognosis in a descriptive manner. We found that CRP, PCT, IL-6,
LYM%, lactic acid and viral load could predict prognosis and guide
classification of COVID-19 patients in different degrees. CRP, IL-6 and LYM%
were more effective than other three factors in predicting prognosis. CRP and
LYM% were sensitive in identifying the types between critically ill and severe
(or moderate). Notably, among the investigated factors, LYM% was the only
one that could distinguish between the severe and moderate types.
Collectively, we concluded that LYM% was the most sensitive and reliable
predictor for disease typing and prognosis. We recommend that LYM% be
used independently or in combination with other indicators in the management
of COVID-19.
