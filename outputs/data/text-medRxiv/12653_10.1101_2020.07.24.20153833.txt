Abstract

27

Introduction: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has

28

caused a recent outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). In Cuba, the first case of

29

COVID-19 was reported on March 11. Elderly with multiple comorbidities are particularly

30

susceptible to adverse clinical outcomes in the course of SARS CoV-2 infection. During the

31

outbreak, a local transmission event took place in a nursing home in Villa Clara province,

32

Cuba, in which nineteen elderly residents were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Based

33

on the increased susceptibility to viral-induced cytokine release syndrome inducing

34

respiratory and systemic complications in this population, the patients were included in an

35

expanded access clinical trial to receive itolizumab, an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody.

36

Results: All the patients had underlying medical conditions. The product was well tolerated.

37

After the first dose, the course of the disease was favorable and 18 out of 19 (94.7%) patients

38

were discharged clinically recovered with negative RT-PCR at 13 days (median). One dose of

39

itolizumab, circulating IL-6 decreased in the first 24-48 hours in patients with high baseline

40

values, whereas in patients with low levels, this concentration remained over low values. To

41

preliminary assess the effect of itolizumab, a control group was selected among the Cuban

42

COVID-19 patients, which did not receive immunomodulatory therapy. Control subjects

43

were well-matched regarding age, comorbidities and severity of the disease. Every three

44

moderately ill patients treated with itolizumab, one admission in intensive care unit (ICU)

45

was prevented. Discussion/Conclusion: Itolizumab was well tolerated. Its effect is associated

46

with a reduction and controlling IL-6 serum levels. Moreover, treated patients had a favorable

47

clinical outcome, considering their poor prognosis. This treatment is associated significantly

48

with a decrease the risk to be admitted in ICU and reduced 10 times the risk of death. This

49

study corroborates that the timely use of itolizumab, in combination with other antiviral and

50

anticoagulant therapies, is associated with a reduction the COVID-19 disease worsening and

51

mortality. The humanized antibody itolizumab emerges as a therapeutic alternative for

52

patients with COVID-19 and suggests its possible use in patients with cytokine release

53

syndrome from other pathologies.

Manuscript Title: Use of a humanized anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody (itolizumab) in elderly

60

patients with moderate COVID-19

61

Introduction

62

From December 2019, the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pneumonia

63

began to be registered in the Chinese city of Wuhan. A month later, the World Health

64

Organization (WHO) confirms that the cause of this pneumonia is the severe acute

65

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To date (June 23, 2020), 185 countries

66

are reported with cases of COVID-19 and it amounts to 9 million 063,264 confirmed cases,

67

471 681 deaths for a fatality of 5.20%. In the Americas region, 4 million 512,775 confirmed

68

cases are reported (49.79% of the total reported cases in the world) with a fatality of 5.02%.

69

The first positive case in Cuba was reported on March 11 and to date, 2319 positive cases

70

have accumulated, with 85 deaths reported (June 25, 2020) [1].

71

COVID-19 can range from asymptomatic to critical disease. Many patients, mostly younger,

72

are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. Elderly with pre-existing comorbidities have

73

been at higher risk of severe disease and fatal outcome [2]. Changes occurring in the immune

74

system with increasing age, termed immunosenescence and the state of chronic, low-grade

75

inflammation known as inflammaging, characterized the immune system in the elderly. Both

76

processes suggest the origin of most of the comorbidities of the older adults and its

77

susceptibility to suffer cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases and new infections [3].

78

SARS-CoV-2 infection is reported to trigger a pro-inflammatory response characterized by

79

high levels of cytokines, including IL-6 and overexpression of other growth factors such as

80

fibroblast growth factor (FGF), the granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-

81

CSF), tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) among

82

others. In some vulnerable patients, the disease might worsen up to admission into the

83

intensive care unit (ICU), if appropriate therapy is not used. Patients at this stage show high

84

levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Particularly, many authors have found that IL-6 levels

85

are directly correlated with increased mortality and inversely with lymphocyte count. Based

86

on these findings it has been suggested that cytokine release syndrome may hinder the

87

adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection [4, 5].

88

High number of COVID-19 associated deaths has been seen in the nursing home sector. It is

89

suggested that elderly patients residing in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) could be more

90

vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection becoming a population with higher risk for COVID-19-

91

associated morbidity and mortality [6].

92

The Center of Molecular Immunology developed the humanized monoclonal antibody (MAb)

93

itolizumab (CIMAREG) capable of binding to a region in the distal membrane domain of

94

human CD6 (domain 1) [7]. The in vitro characterization of its mechanism of action revealed

95

that it reduces the expression of intracellular proteins involved in activation and inhibits the

96

proliferation of T cells. The effect is associated with the reduction of activation signals and

97

the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interferon-γ (IFN- γ), interleukin (IL)-6 and

98

tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)) [8]. Studies in blood and tissue samples from patients

99

with severe psoriasis treated with this MAb, showed that the treatment reduced the

100

proliferation capacity of T cells and the number of T cells producing IFN- γ. In addition, the

101

reduction of serum IL-6 and IFN-γ levels was observed [9, 10].

102

A local transmission event occurred in a Cuban’s nursing home, in which several patients

103

were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Nineteen of these patients were admitted to a hospital at

104

moderate stage of the disease. All the patients were older than 64 years and the majority of

105

them suffered hypertension and/or other comorbidities, which are risk factors associated with

106

severity and fatal COVID-19 outcome. Based on the immunoregulatory action of itolizumab

107

and the safety profile verified in previous severe COVID-19 patients, its use was proposed in

108

the moderately ill elderly patients from the nursing home.

109

In this study we characterized the clinical features and outcomes of these nineteen elderly

110

patients treated with itolizumab combined with anti-viral therapies.

Materials and Methods

112

Patients

113

Nineteen patients confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive by real-time transcriptase polymerase

114

chain reaction (RT-PCR), admitted from the Cuban’s nursing home, were enrolled in an

115

open, multicenter expanded access clinical trial (RPCEC00000311(VICTORIA)) to be

116

treated with the humanized MAb itolizumab. The Ethics Committee for Clinical Research in

117

the hospital and Cuban Regulatory Agency (CECMED) approved the trial. The study

118

complied with the Good Clinical Practices and the precepts established in the Declaration of

119

the Helsinki World Medical Association. All patients met the inclusion criteria described in

the protocol (http://rpcec.sld.cu/trials/RPCEC00000311-Eg.) and signed the informed

121

consent.

122

Treatment

123

Patients received standard treatments (lopinavir/ritonavir (kaletra), chloroquine, prophylactic

124

antibiotics, interferon alpha (α) 2B and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)) included in

125

the institutional protocol for COVID-19 [11].

126

In addition, patients received a first intravenous dose of 200 mg of a humanized Mab

127

itolizumab (8 vials). Some patients received a second dose (200 mg), considering their

128

clinical evolution and the physician criteria. Itolizumab-associated adverse events (AE) were

129

reported. Their classification was performed according to the NIH-CTC toxicity criteria,

130

version 5.0.

131

Laboratory examination

132

Laboratory results included blood routine, leucocyte subsets and blood biochemical

133

parameters. The level of inflammatory cytokines was measured using human Quantikine

134

ELISA Kits from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, USA): Human IL-6 Quantikine ELISA Kit

135

(Cat# S6050).

136

Statistical Analysis

137

Continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard deviations or median and

138

interquartile ranges (depending of the distribution of each variable). Wilcoxon rank sum test

139

were applied to continuous variables, and chi-square or Fisher’s exact test were used for

140

categorical variables. Type 1 error of 0.05 was used. To preliminary assess the effect of

141

itolizumab, a control group was selected among the Cuban COVID-19 patients, that did not

142

receive immunomodulatory therapy. Controls were treated with lopinavir/ritonavir,

143

chloroquine, interferon α2B and LMWH. Control subjects were well-matched regarding age,

144

comorbidities and severity of the disease. Odds ratio for disease progression and mortality

145

was estimated for itolizumab vs control. The number of patients needed to treat (NNT) to

146

prevent an additional poor outcome and the absolute risk reduction were also calculated. The

147

analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0 software.

150

The median age was 79 years (64 to 100 years old); 63.2% were female and 68.4% were

151

white skin. All the patients had chronic underlying health conditions. The most frequent

152

comorbidities were hypertension (73.7%), dementia (57.9%), malnutrition (52.6%), cardiac

153

disease (42.1%), diabetes mellitus (31.6%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

154

(COPD) (26.3%). The majority of them suffered more than one comorbidity (Table 1).

155

Upon admission, 42.1% of these elderly patients required oxygen therapy due to respiratory

156

function worsening. In addition, 52.6% had fever, 47.3% had cough and 42.1% showed signs

157

and symptoms of dehydration. Other symptoms included dyspnea (36.8%) and diarrhea

158

(26.3%). Regarding the severity of the disease, they were classified as moderately ill patients.

159

Concerning hematological and biochemical parameters, 16.7% of patients had leukocyte

160

levels below the normal range. Lymphocytes were below the normal range in 29.4% and

161

5.6% had low counts of platelets. Aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) was above the normal

162

values in 13.3% and D-dimer was increased in 84.6% of the patients.

163

Treatment with an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody (itolizumab)

164

Immediately upon confirmation of the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the patients received the

165

established institutional COVID-19 treatment protocol [11]. All the patients received

166

lopinavir/ritonavir (kaletra), 94.7% had chloroquine, 68.4% received interferon α2B and

167

89.5% received LMWH. Additionally, 63.2% got vitamins and 31.6% antibiotics. Three

168

patients (15.8%) were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin at a cytoprotective

169

dose (Table 1).

170

All the patients received one dose of the antibody, while 89.5% received two. The median

171

time between the onset of symptoms and itolizumab was 1 day. The time between doses,

172

ranged from 1 to 7 days, with an overall median of two days. In this study, 94.7% of the

173

patients were discharged, with a median hospital stay of 13 days, ranging from 3 to 40 days.

174

All of them were negative for SARS-COV2 at the moment of discharge. Only one death-

175

event took place, in a patient with several comorbidities (hypertension, coronary artery

176

disease, dementia and malnutrition). In it, daily electrocardiograms showed a left bundle

177

branch block without sings of acute ischemia and death was by pulmonary

178

thromboembolism. Only one AE related to the administration of the itolizumab was reported.

179

The AE consisted on chills and occurred immediately after the first administration, lasting for

180

minutes. The AE was mild intensity and did not imply changes in the administration of the

181

antibody.

182

Vital signs were evaluated after itolizumab administration during the hospital stay. After 7

183

days of itolizumab treatment, only two patients required oxygen therapy (10.5%) and this

184

difference had statistically significant compared to baseline requirements (42.1% vs 10.5%,

185

p=0.031, χ (McNemar) test).

186

IL-6 serum levels were measured before and 24-48 hours after the treatment in twelve elderly

187

patients. The median of pretreatment concentration was 23.9 pg/mL and the median of IL-6

188

levels 48 hours after the treatment was 25.9 pg/mL. Therefore, no significant changes were

189

detected. In a previous work, the application of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve

190

selected the cut-off of IL-6 levels on 28.3 pg/mL, to stablish the association between baseline

191

IL-6 concentration and severity of illness (unpublished data). When analyzing the IL-6 serum

192

values of elderly patients regarding the selected cut-off, five patients had baseline levels

193

above 28.3 pg/mL. Four out of five patients reduced the cytokine concentrations 24-48 hours

194

after the itolizumab. In one patient, the levels remained similar (shown in Fig. 1).

195

Among the seven patients with baseline levels below the selected cut-off, in six patients the

196

circulating IL-6 did not increase over 28.3 pg/mL 24-48 hours after the administration. Only

197

in one patient, the IL-6 concentration increased (shown in Fig. 1). The magnitude of change

198

of IL-6 among the patients with concentrations above the cutoff has a median of reduction of

199

48.6 pg/mL. The median of change in IL-6 concentration among the patients with baseline

200

levels below 28.3 pg/mL, was 2.2 pg/mL.

201

Clinical outcome of itolizumab-treated patients

202

A comparison of the clinical evolution between the cohort from the nursing home (n=19) and

203

a group of Cuban COVID-19 patients with similar baseline conditions (control group), was

204

performed. Control patients were defined as COVID-19-confirmed patients, reported by the

205

Cuban Ministry of Public Health. Among them, patients with similar baseline conditions to

206

our cohort: at least one comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease, cancer,

207

chronic kidney disease, obesity, malnutrition or COPD), 64 years or older and who were not

208

included in other COVID-19 clinical trials, were selected (n=53 patients). Control patients

209

received the rest of the Cuban protocol drugs described above. The groups were

210

homogeneous in terms of demographic characteristics and significant comorbidities, except

211

for malnutrition, which occurs only in the itolizumab treated group (p=0.000, test χ2).

213

significant dependence between itolizumab use and admission in intensive care unit (ICU) or

214

mortality, was detected. Every three moderately ill patients treated with itolizumab, one

215

admission in ICU was prevented (p=0.042, test χ2, NNT: 3.12). Additionally, treatment with

216

the Mab is associated with a reduction the risk of death 10 times as compared with the control

217

group (1/0.10=10). Every three moderately ill patients treated with itolizumab, one death was

218

prevented (p=0.020, test χ2, NNT: 2.93) (shown in Fig. 2).

220

Discussion

221

Elderly patients are particularly susceptible to adverse clinical outcomes in the course of

222

SARS CoV-2 infection. Older adults with age-related diseases are more susceptible to viral-

223

induced cytokine storm resulting in respiratory failure, multisystem damage and fatal

224

outcome [12].

225

COVID-19, caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, become a global health emergency

226

according to the WHO since March 11, 2020, has led the international scientific and medical

227

community to search for adequate therapies that would allow controlling it, avoiding

228

mortality and the damages associated with it [12].

229

In April 2020, an episode of massive SARS CoV-2 transmission occurred in the Nursing

230

Home in Villa Clara province, Cuba. Nineteen residents were infected by a visitor, who

231

turned out to be positive at SARS CoV-2 days after having made a visit to that facility.

232

Residents and health care personnel at long-term care facilities are at risk for COVID-19

233

transmission and residents are particularly at risk of severe outcomes because they are

234

predominantly at advanced ages and have commonly underlying medical conditions [6].

235

After the appearance of COVID 19- related symptoms, all the elderly were admitted into the

236

Hospital. They immediately received the treatment-protocol established in the country for this

237

disease [11].

238

All the patients in our cohort had underlying medical conditions. The most frequent were

239

hypertension, dementia, malnutrition, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus and COPD. The

240

median age was 79 years old. People of any age with certain comorbidities such as

241

hypertension, COPD, serious heart conditions, diabetes mellitus and immunocompromised

242

state, especially elderly, are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 [13]. Fever,

243

cough, dyspnea, signs of dehydration and diarrhea were the most frequent symptoms on

244

admission. They were classified as moderately ill patients. Assessment and treatment is

245

challenging for elderly patients diagnosed with COVID-19. An individualized approach

246

should be offered to older adults properly analyzing the beneficial effects and the risks of

247

therapeutic decisions [12].

248

Based on the increased susceptibility to viral-induced cytokine storm inducing respiratory

249

and systemic complications in this type of population [12], the patients were included in an

250

expanded access clinical trial to receive itolizumab, an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody.

251

Itolizumab is a first-in class antagonistic Mab that selectively targets the CD6-ALCAM

252

pathway, reducing the activation, proliferation and differentiation of T cells into pathogenic

253

effector T cells and leading to a decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokine production [8].

254

The product was well tolerated since only one mild adverse reaction was reported after the

255

first infusion in one subject. In general, after the first dose, the course of the disease was

256

favorable, only two patients required oxygen therapy after the treatment and 94.7% of the

257

patients were discharged with negative RT-PCR results at 14 days. This outcome suggests

258

that although itolizumab is an immunomodulatory drug, it did not interfere with the clearance

259

of SARS-CoV-2 virus.

260

Inflammation arises as a critical process in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. While a strong

261

immune response may contain the infection, previous studies have reported worse outcomes

262

related to the presence of an excessive number of cytokines and inflammatory soluble factors

263

[14]. Itolizumab is associated with a reduction or stabilized IL-6 levels in these elderly

264

patients in the first 24-48 hours of administration. In four out of five patients with IL-6

265

baseline concentrations above the pre-stablish cutoff for severity (28.3 pg/mL) (unpublished

266

data), the levels decreased after Mab administration. In one patient, the levels remained

267

similar. Regarding patients with IL-6 baseline levels below 28.3 pg/mL, only one increased

268

the IL-6 values; the rest remained under this cut-off 24-48 hours after the administration.

269

Therefore, these findings suggest that the reduction of serum IL-6 levels in patients with high

270

baseline concentrations, and its stabilization over low values is an effect associated of this

271

monoclonal antibody.

272

Modulation of the severe inflammatory state in patients with COVID-19, consist in a relevant

273

strategy to limit the severity of pulmonary and systemic complications. This approach could

274

successfully reduce the needs for intensive care support and mechanical ventilation, and

275

eventually decrease mortality [15]. When comparing our cohort of COVID-19 itolizumab-

276

treated patients with a control group of Cuban COVID-19 patients, with similar

277

characteristics (age, comorbidities and similar treatment except for itolizumab or another

278

immunomodulatory agent), itolizumab emerged as therapy associated on preventing the

279

severity of the disease. This treatment is associated significantly with a decrease the risk to be

280

admitted in ICU and reduced 10 times the risk of death.

281

This study has some limitations regarding the short kinetic of IL-6 levels and the limited

282

follow up of the patients, long-term outcomes of them are unknown. Nevertheless, it shows

283

the effect of itolizumab associated with a reduction and controlling IL-6 serum levels.

284

Moreover, itolizumab treated patients had a favorable clinical outcome, considering their

285

poor prognosis associated with old age and comorbidities, including nutrition deficit.

286

In conclusion, this study corroborates that the timely use of itolizumab, in combination with

287

other antiviral and anticoagulant therapies, is associated with a reduction the COVID-19

288

disease worsening and mortality. The humanized antibody itolizumab emerges as a

289

therapeutic alternative for patients with COVID-19 and suggests its possible use in patients

290

with cytokine release syndrome from other pathologies.

Abstract
Introduction: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
has caused a recent outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). In Cuba, the first
case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11. Elderly with multiple comorbidities are
particularly susceptible to adverse clinical outcomes in the course of SARS CoV-2
infection. During the outbreak, a local transmission event took place in a nursing home
in Villa Clara province, Cuba, in which nineteen elderly residents were positive for
SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Based on the increased susceptibility to viral-induced cytokine
release syndrome inducing respiratory and systemic complications in this population,
the patients were included in an expanded access clinical trial to receive itolizumab, an
anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody. Results: All the patients had underlying medical
conditions. The product was well tolerated. After the first dose, the course of the disease
was favorable and 18 out of 19 (94.7%) patients were discharged clinically recovered
with negative RT-PCR at 13 days (median). One dose of itolizumab, circulating IL-6
decreased in the first 24-48 hours in patients with high baseline values, whereas in
patients with low levels, this concentration remained over low values. To preliminary
assess the effect of itolizumab, a control group was selected among the Cuban COVID19 patients, which did not receive immunomodulatory therapy. Control subjects were
well-matched regarding age, comorbidities and severity of the disease. Every three
moderately ill patients treated with itolizumab, one admission in intensive care unit
(ICU) was prevented. Discussion/Conclusion: Itolizumab was well tolerated. Its effect
is associated with a reduction and controlling IL-6 serum levels. Moreover, treated
patients had a favorable clinical outcome, considering their poor prognosis. This
treatment is associated significantly with a decrease the risk to be admitted in ICU and
reduced 10 times the risk of death. This study corroborates that the timely use of
itolizumab, in combination with other antiviral and anticoagulant therapies, is
associated with a reduction the COVID-19 disease worsening and mortality. The
humanized antibody itolizumab emerges as a therapeutic alternative for patients with
COVID-19 and suggests its possible use in patients with cytokine release syndrome
from other pathologies.
