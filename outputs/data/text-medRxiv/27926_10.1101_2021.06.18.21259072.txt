Abstract
Background
Remdesivir was given UK early-access approval for use in COVID-19 in people aged 12 years and
older on 26th May 2020 on the basis of unmet clinical need. Evidence on the side effects, complications
of therapy and effectiveness of this therapy is lacking or conflicting.
Methods
Adults with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir were compared with propensity-score matched
controls, identified from the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol study of UK hospitalised
patients with COVID-19. Remdesivir patients were matched to controls according to baseline
underlying 14-day mortality risk. The effect of remdesivir on short-term outcomes was investigated
(primary outcome: 14-day mortality). Effect sizes were estimated and adjusted for potential
confounders using multivariable modelling.
Results
1,549 patients given remdesivir and 4,964 matched controls were identified satisfying inclusion and
exclusion criteria. The balance diagnostic threshold was achieved. Patients had symptoms for a median
of 6 days prior to baseline; 62% were male, with mean (SD) age 63∙1 (15∙6) years, and 80% categorised
as ‘White’ ethnicity. Fourteen-day mortality was not statistically significantly associated with treatment
(9∙3 % remdesivir vs. 11∙9% controls, odds-ratio 0∙80, [95% CI 0∙60-1∙07], p=0∙116, adjusted for age,
sex, number of key comorbidities, dexamethasone use, and diagnosis of viral pneumonia.
Findings
Treatment with remdesivir was not associated with a reduction in mortality in our primary endpoint at
14 days.
Interpretation
Remdesivir did not significantly improve mortality in this study. The findings are subject to the
limitations of an observational study. Balance was achieved for measured baseline factors, but
unmeasured confounders may account for observed treatment effect sizes.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
At the time of designing this study, two clinical trials measuring the efficacy of remdesivir as a
therapeutic in treating SARS COV-2 had published results: ACTT-1 and SOLIDARITY. ACTT-1
suggested that for those who required supplemental oxygen but not ventilation at baseline, remdesivir
reduced time-to-recovery (rate ratio 1∙45, [95% CI: 1∙19-1∙79]), improved clinical status at 15 days
(proportional odds ratio 1∙6 [1∙2-2∙3]), and improved mortality by both 15 days (hazard ratio 0∙28 [0∙120∙66]) and 29 days (0∙30 [0∙14-0∙64]) compared with a placebo. SOLIDARITY did not find any
evidence of benefit for remdesivir in these same types of patients – it reported on time-to-recovery, and
28-day mortality, compared with the local standard of care.

Added value of this study
This study presents real-world data on the effectiveness of remdesivir use during a non-surge phase of
the pandemic in the UK, specifically looking at patients for whom the ACTT-1 trial suggested would
be most likely to benefit from remdesivir.

Implications of all the available evidence
We show that during the pandemic, remdesivir was given to a wide demographic of patients in the UK
(on average older than those in clinical trials). At 14-days post baseline no reduction in absolute
mortality was observed. Propensity score matching achieved balance for measured baseline variables.
However as with all observational studies, differences between the groups in unmeasured variables that
may influence clinicians but were not recorded in our study, are plausible.

Introduction
Several therapeutic drugs licensed for use in other conditions have been trialled in the treatment of
severe COVID-19. Remdesivir (Gilead Sciences, Inc.), was approved for use in people aged 12yrs and
older affected with severe COVID-19 by the United Kingdom’s (UK) Medicines and Healthcare
products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) under their Early Access to Medicine Scheme (EAMS) from 26th
May 2020. EAMS status was withdrawn in July 2020, because remdesivir was commissioned for
routine use in severe COVID-19 following an evidence review1 by the National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence (NICE). The data collection initiated to evaluate remdesivir has continued.

Clinical trial evidence for remdesivir use
Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that has shown activity against Ebola virus in vitro and
in non-human primates.2 It is an adenosine nucleotide prodrug administered via intravenous infusion,
and once it is metabolised into its active form3, it inhibits the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase4,
a conserved enzyme involved in viral RNA synthesis. Remdesivir has demonstrated in vitro efficacy
against other emerging coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-15,6, and SARS-CoV-2 7–
11

. The half-effective concentration (EC50) values against SARS-CoV-2 were below 5M. This

promising EC50 combined with high (>100) safety indices in cells, made remdesivir one of the principal
compounds of interest for a clinical trial early in the pandemic. While in vivo studies also showed
clinical benefits2,12, there are limits to what can be extrapolated from the animal models due to important
differences in the pharmacokinetics of the drug and disease course, particularly in mice. 13 The
pharmacokinetics of remdesivir have been reported in healthy adults, showing a favourable profile, 14
but they are yet to be reported in severely ill patients. At the time of design of this study, findings for
two key clinical trials (ACTT-115,16, and SOLIDARITY17,18) had been publicised (see Research in
Context panel).

Methods
Study design and participants
We used data from a prospective observational cohort study of UK patients hospitalised, using a unique
dataset consisting of data collected using the ISARIC WHO CCP-UK protocol.19,20 Study materials
including protocol, revision history, case report forms (CRFs), study information and consent forms,
are available online20 Ethical approval for data collection was given by the South Central - Oxford C
Research Ethics Committee in England (Ref: 13/SC/0149) and by the Scotland A Research Ethics
Committee (Ref: 20/SS/0028). Under the Control of Patient Information (COPI) notice 2020 for urgent
public health research, processing of demographic and routine clinical data from medical records for
research does not require consent in England and Wales. In Scotland, a waiver for consent was obtained
from the Public Benefit and Privacy Panel. The patient population of interest was those who at baseline

would have been eligible to be initiated on remdesivir and classified at clinical status level 5 of an 8point ordinal scale (hospitalised, requiring oxygen, but not requiring ventilation) (see below for full
definitions of baseline and inclusion/exclusion criteria). The study period was patient baseline between
26th May 2020 and 30th November 2020, with 28 days follow-up post baseline (see below). Patients that
initiated remdesivir treatment within 24 hours of baseline were compared with a propensity-score
matched control group that received no remdesivir during hospitalisation. We followed the
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement checklist
to guide transparent reporting of this study.

Procedures
Patients were eligible for inclusion whether their COVID-19 was hospital or community acquired
(hospital: symptom onset at least 5 days after hospital admission; community: admitted with symptoms
consistent with COVID-19). They were followed up for 28 days post baseline. ‘Baseline’ was defined
as ’date of hospital admission’ for community acquired COVID-19 and ‘date of a positive COVID-19
test’ for hospital acquired infection. Patients were included if they satisfied all of the following: (1)
Laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; (2) hospitalised; (3) aged ≥ 18 years at baseline; (3)
requiring supplementary oxygen (usually for hypoxaemia SpO2 ≤ 94%) at any time during the 24 hours
post baseline; (4) remdesivir initiated ≤ 24 hours post baseline (remdesivir group only). Patients were
excluded if at least one of the following criteria were confirmed: (1) requiring any form of respiratory
support (“high flow” oxygen, non-invasive, or invasive ventilation) or extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO) during first 24 hours post baseline; (2) pregnant; (3) chronic kidney disease, or a
baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30; (4) remdesivir initiated > 24 hours post
baseline; (5) COVID-19 re-admission (was previously hospitalised for COVID-19); (6) missing a Day
1 Daily Treatment CRF; (7) missing ‘Medication’ section of the Outcome CRF.

We define two treatment groups: standard of care with remdesivir, and standard of care without
remdesivir (control treatment). Guidelines in the UK21 – recommended remdesivir’s use in newly
hospitalised patients, no later than within 10 days of symptom onset, and only initiated in non-ventilated
patients. Recommended dosing was 200mg on Day 1 of treatment, followed by 100mg daily for 4 days.
Guidelines regarding recommended duration of treatment evolved over time (see appendix [p6]).
Standard of care evolved over time: corticosteroids, dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, became
recommended for some patients part-way through the study period. Interactions between remdesivir
and these corticosteroids were not expected21 such that remdesivir patients will have received these in
the same way as non-remdesivir patients. The drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate
were actively not recommended as concomitant medications for remdesivir from 3rd September 2020
(Figure 2).

The control group was selected from the cohort of eligible non-remdesivir patients using propensity
score matching. An optimal propensity score (log-odds of being given remdesivir at baseline) model
was derived from the data using the following baseline variables as potential predictors prespecified in
the statistical plan: month of baseline; ISARIC4C tier of participating centre (0/1/2); sex; age; broad
ethnicity group (White/Asian/Black/Other); clinically extremely vulnerable status (yes [Any of the
following: cancer, severe respiratory condition, on immunosuppression therapy, other]/none/unknown);
binary indictors of the key comorbidities: diabetes, hypertension, obesity, chronic cardiac disease
(CCD), chronic pulmonary disease (CPD), and asthma; where COVID was acquired (community /
hospital); admitted to HDU or ICU at baseline (yes/no). A propensity score was then assigned to each
patient and used to match remdesivir patients with up to four controls (see Statistical Methods below).

Data were routinely collected on patients at baseline, the first day of admission to an ICU, and then on
death, discharge, or day 28 post hospitalisation depending on which was soonest. For some sites, daily
CRFs for days 3, 6 and 9 were also collected. Remdesivir patients had daily CRFs completed for each
day of remdesivir dosing, and on day 14 after remdesivir initiation. Data collection regarding safety
was limited to a tick-box assessment of 30 complications that patients may have experienced during
their hospital stay post baseline. Space was provided for free-text entry of other complications, and
these were searched for text that indicated any of the 30 listed complications, and to identify commonly
occurring others. There was no scope to measure severity or relatedness, and the quality of the data
relied on what was recorded in medical notes. An extract of the database was made on 10th January to
assess (a) whether the sample size of eligible remdesivir patients was >500, and (b) the extent of missing
data of key baseline variables and the primary outcome. This data extract was judged to be adequate for
the purpose of our analysis. No outcome analyses were carried out prior to this decision.

The primary outcome was 14-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were: (1) time-to-recovery; (2) 28day mortality; (3) time-to-death; (4) clinical status at day 15; (5) length of time receiving supplementary
oxygen; (6) time-to-first ventilation; (7) use of non-invasive ventilation; (8) use of mechanical
ventilation or ECMO; (9) acute renal injury/acute renal failure; and (10) liver dysfunction. Full
definitions and rationale for the outcomes are given in the appendix [pp 3-4].

Statistical Methods
The study was planned prior to access to the data being granted and a statistical analysis plan (SAP)
was published on the ISARIC website on 16th December.22 This was subject to internal clinical and
statistical review. The manufacturer was also given opportunity to comment on the SAP. This review
was discretionary, and suggested revisions were considered prior to finalisation; however none were
considered substantive and the proposed methodology was unchanged.

The sample size was limited by the number of patients treated with remdesivir in practice and while a
formal sample size calculation was not undertaken a sample size of more than 500 patients treated with
remdesivir was considered sufficient for a meaningful analysis. No upper boundary was placed on the
numbers included. The number of controls eligible for the study could not be predicted, but the total
was expected to be greater than the number that received remdesivir.

Remdesivir patients were matched with to up to four controls using variable-ratio nearest-neighbour
propensity-score matching with a calliper width of 0∙2 standard deviations. 23 Controls were chosen
without replacement, so could not be matched to more than one remdesivir patient. An optimal
propensity score model was selected satisfying a pre-defined balance diagnostic threshold (absolute
standardised difference in risk score ASDRS ≤ 0∙124, where risk score is the estimated underlying risk of
14-day all-cause mortality). Full details and rationale for methods are given in the appendix [p8].

Descriptive statistics were used to describe demographics, other baseline characteristics including preexisting comorbidities, treatments received during hospitalisation, and complications associated with
hospitalisation. Outcomes were summarised by treatment group, but inference was obtained through
multivariable modelling, adjusting for key confounders chosen a priori (sex, age-group, and number of
key comorbidities), and if necessary, additional factors that on seeing the data were considered potential
confounders. Models incorporated weights for the control group to account for the variable matching
ratio (wj = 1/kj) where kj is the number of controls matched to remdesivir patient j). Stuart23 suggests
that for analysis purposes, the two groups may be treated as independent. Binary outcomes (e.g. 14-day
mortality) were modelled using logistic regression; time-to-event outcomes were modelled using Cox
Proportional-Hazards models (using a Landmark analysis if proportional hazards assumptions failed);
the ordinal outcome - clinical status at 15 days – was modelled with ordinal logistic regression. The
primary outcome analysis was subject to sensitivity analyses regarding specification of the logistic
regression model: e.g. adding propensity score as a covariate, adding interactions. Propensity score
matching was carried out using the package MatchIt in R v3.6.1; all other analyses were carried out
using SAS v9.4.

Results
Cohort ascertainment and characteristics
A total of 39,330 unique patients were identified from a data extract made on 8th January 2021, with a
baseline date between 26th May and 30th November 2020. A total of 9,278 patients satisfied
inclusion/exclusion criteria, and of these, 6,513 were included in the matched analysis (see Figure 1,
and Table S2). Patients included in the matched cohort came from all regions of the UK, were 62∙1%
male, with mean (SD) age 63∙1 (15∙6) years, and 79∙7% of those with ethnicity recorded were

categorised as ‘White’ (see Table 1). They had a median (IQR) 4C Mortality Score of 9 (6, 12), meaning
that most patients were classified as at intermediate or high risk of in-hospital mortality.

An optimal propensity score model was derived, with sufficient balance between the groups (ASD RS=
0∙1). In the eligible cohort, remdesivir was found to have been more likely given: later in the study
period, to younger patients, those without an extreme clinical vulnerability, with obesity, who acquired
COVID-19 in the community, or who were not admitted to HDU or ICU at baseline (Table S3). The
fitted primary outcome risk score model results are presented in Table S4. Figure S1 presents
distributions of propensity score split by group. The cohorts are well balanced with respect to baseline
characteristics (Table 1) – in particular, 4C Mortality Score25 statistics were almost identical.

Treatments received during hospitalisation post baseline
The remdesivir group were generally more medicated post baseline than controls. They were more
likely to have been given dexamethasone (93∙9% vs. 61∙7%) or antibiotics (89∙7% vs 79∙8%) during
hospitalisation. Use of at least one corticosteroid other than dexamethasone was similar in the two
groups (9∙4% vs 10∙7%). In both groups, the use of antiviral agents other than remdesivir was rare –
3∙0% of the control group were known to have received an antiviral agent (Table S5). Dexamethasone
use was identified as a factor that should be adjusted for in all inferential analyses, given its known
efficacy as a therapeutic in treating COVID-19.

In-hospital complications
Data on complications was recorded for 6,190 (95∙0%) of the matched cohort (remdesivir: 1,504,
control: 4,686). The most prevalent complications were viral pneumonia (61∙9%), bacterial pneumonia
(11∙8%), hyperglycaemia (11∙0%), acute renal injury/failure (8∙9%), anaemia (8∙1%) and acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (7∙2%) (Table S6). The remdesivir group had proportionally
higher recorded viral pneumonia (75∙2% vs 57∙6%), hyperglycaemia (17∙8% vs 8∙8%), and ARDS
(11∙4% vs 5∙9%). Liver dysfunction (a secondary outcome) was significantly more common in
remdesivir treated cases (8∙6% vs 5∙4%, adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1∙51, 95% CI: 1∙18-1∙92, p=0∙0009).
Acute renal injury/failure was not associated with treatment group (0∙93, 0∙75-1∙16, p=0∙53). No
assessment could be made of relatedness nor severity of observed complications as data for this purpose
were not collected.

Primary Outcome
A total of 140/1,507 (9∙3%) patients in the remdesivir group and 565/4,734 (11∙9%) patients in the
control group died within 14 days of baseline. 6,202 patients were included in a logistic regression
model (Table 2). The OR of death at 14 days for remdesivir vs controls, adjusted for age, sex, number

of comorbidities, dexamethasone use, and viral pneumonia was 0∙80 with 95% CI (0∙60-1∙07), p=0∙116.
Sensitivity analyses did not change inference (appendix [p15]).

Secondary Outcomes
Time-to-recovery was found to vary with time and treatment (Figure 3A). During days 1-5, recovery
was more likely in the control group; during days 6-8 there was no treatment effect; and for days 9-28,
remdesivir was associated with a faster recovery (Table 3). Median (IQR) time to recovery was 9 (910) days for remdesivir, and 8 (8-9) days for controls. There is evidence to suggest that reduction in 28day mortality is associated with remdesivir (Table 2): the p-value is 0.03, but uncorrected for
multiplicity; this can be interpreted as an estimated 36 (95% CI: 20- 290) patients needed to treat to
prevent one death. Time-to-death over these 28 days was not significantly associated with treatment
group (Figure 3B, Table 3). Five clinical status classifications were derivable at day 15 (appendix [pp
15-16]). Ordinal regression of this outcome indicates no evidence of an association with treatment group
(Table 2). The proportional odds assumption was checked and found to hold. Overall, by day 15 most
patients had improved clinical status compared with baseline: 1,106/1,549 (71∙4%) remdesivir vs.
3,303/4,964 (66∙5%) controls. Non-invasive ventilation was more likely in the remdesivir group (Table
2). Remdesivir patients required more invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; and where data were
available, median (IQR) duration of these interventions in days were 10 (5,16) for remdesivir, and 6
(3,14) for controls. Two outcomes could not be derived due to insufficient daily CRF data: length of
time requiring supplementary oxygen, and time-to-first-ventilation.

Discussion
In this analysis of data from a large UK-wide study, we found that remdesivir use was not statistically
significantly associated with improved 14-day mortality. There was an absolute difference in incidence
of 2.6 percentage points in favour of remdesivir, but this was not statistically significant after adjusting
for potential confounders. The confidence interval for the adjusted odds-ratio indicated considerable
uncertainty regarding potential effect of remdesivir of a 40% reduction, to having no effect. A small
reduction in 28-day mortality was detected, though as a secondary outcome, this result should be
considered hypothesis generating. Our study does not exclude the possibility that effectiveness might
be present in specific patient subgroups.

Our study population was representative of severe COVID-19 patients of all ages, treated in hospitals
across the whole UK, predominantly of white ethnic background, and male. Compared with both the
ACTT-115 and SOLIDARITY17 trials, our cohort was older, and less ethnically diverse. As age is a key
factor in risk of death from COVID-19 absolute survival outcomes presented here should not be
compared directly with the rates published in these trials. Patients in our study received many types of

treatment during hospitalisation, but the data do not indicate when these treatments were received, nor
the dose, nor duration. Use of other antivirals was rare - the control group can be considered a ‘Non
anti-viral therapeutics’ group. There is an indication that dexamethasone use (and by implication
corticosteroid use) was greater in the remdesivir group, and also use of antibiotics. Complications
during hospitalisation indicated some imbalance in the groups. The remdesivir group had higher
recorded prevalence of viral pneumonia. This measure is difficult to interpret, and arguably our
inclusion criteria define patients that were presenting with viral pneumonia at baseline. It may have
little meaning recorded in the complication CRF, or may have been a proxy for greater baseline severity,
or a secondary effect to the antiviral, though there is less biological plausibility for the latter.
Hyperglycaemia, ARDS, and liver dysfunction were also more observed in the remdesivir group. One
in eleven patients in our cohort were recorded as suffering from acute renal injury or failure, but this
was similar in the two groups. NIV usage was more likely in the remdesivir group. This could represent
a higher level of illness in this group, which was not apparent from the baseline data. Alternatively, it
could represent a lower threshold for escalation of care in this group, or a perception that escalation was
less likely to be futile in this group. See appendix p17 for further discussion regarding secondary
outcomes.

This analysis used data from a prospective observational study, using routine care data collected during
a pandemic. There are limitations in that effectiveness estimates are not from randomised patients, and
the data collected reflect local practice by the clinical teams at numerous hospital sites. The study was
designed pragmatically to be simple enough to be rapidly implemented, using data that were being
collected under a generic protocol. The analysis was planned and made open for comment prior to any
data being provided for analysis. Data completeness for baseline characteristics and final clinical
outcomes were found to be extremely good thanks to the diligence of participating sites throughout the
country. Daily follow-up data was less available than expected, and this meant that two outcomes and
clinical status at day 15 could not be derived as planned. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to
define a cohort that represented the type of patient that would have been eligible to have received
remdesivir, and with the greatest potential to benefit from it, according to the existing evidence base.
This created a clear analysis cohort with similar baseline level of severity of COVID-19. 73% of patients
given remdesivir were excluded – chiefly because their treatment did not start within 24 hours of
baseline. We justify their exclusion as the data collection tool could not guarantee determination of
clinical status at start of treatment at other times. Other remdesivir patients were excluded because they
required respiratory support or ECMO at baseline. These excluded patients are of interest, in the overall
assessment of effectiveness, but would have to be the subject of a separate study. Propensity matching
was used effectively to select a control group that had a similar profile to remdesivir patients and
balanced according to the risk-score balance diagnostic. The control group were slightly older, but had
similar clinical frailty scores, and numbers of comorbidities. Propensity score matching is a powerful

design tool in an observational study – provided all key factors that increased likelihood of treatment
are considered when developing a propensity score model. A priori matching factors were principally
demographic and baseline clinical characteristics that might be related to chance of being given
remdesivir, or chance of death within 14 days, or both. Several baseline continuous measures were not
prespecified in the SAP for inclusion in the development of the propensity score model: oxygen
saturation, respiratory rate Glasgow coma score, urea and C-reactive protein (CRP). With hindsight
these may have been important to consider, though missing CRP and urea data would have led to at
least 20% of patients being excluded from the matching algorithm. Nevertheless, these variables all
contribute to the 4C mortality score, for which good balance was observed.

It is possible that further benefit could be gained if remdesivir, or a similar orally available direct acting
antiviral, could be given earlier in the disease process, when pharyngeal shedding and by inference viral
replication in the lower respiratory tract is at its highest.12 SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques were
successfully treated when remdesivir dosing was initiated 12 hours after virus inoculum. The authors
noted that the efficacy of such direct acting antivirals against acute viral respiratory infections usually
drops with time after infection and stressed the importance of dosing humans as quickly as possible.
The ACTT-1 trial15 confirmed that benefits associated with remdesivir were larger earlier in the disease
course (<=10 days vs >10 days). Our study contains too few hospital-acquired patients to explore this
hypothesis.

We note that liver dysfunction was increased in the remdesivir group. This is not unexpected, since
raised transaminases are an expected adverse event in nucleoside analogues, and indeed alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) was elevated in 7% of remdesivir clinical trial participants.26 The current data
does not allow us to distinguish the level of severity of this liver dysfunction or whether it was
reversible.

Overall, our study does not provide evidence that remdesivir is of benefit in patients hospitalised with
severe COVID-19.

(a) Defined to be mutually exclusive: Asian = any ticked from Arab, East/South/West Asian; Black = Black ticked, but no Asian categories; White = ‘White ticked’, but not any Asian or Black
categories; Other = not categorised Asian, Black or White, but at least one category ticked in any other box except ‘Unknown’.
(b) Categories are not mutually exclusive. No clinically vulnerabilities: all options ticked ‘No’; Clinically vulnerable unknown: no boxes are ticked ‘Yes’, and any level of missingness.
(c) Key comorbidities: Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity, CCD, CPD, Asthma.

(a) Each odds ratio presented is estimated from a separate model, each adjusted for: baseline age-group (<50, 50-69, 60-69, 70-79, 80+), sex, number of key comorbidities (0, 1, 2+) [where key
comorbidities are: any diabetes, hypertension, obesity, CCD, CPD, asthma], dexamethasone use during hospitalisation (Yes, No, Unknown), Viral Pneumonia recorded in the complications
CRF (Yes, No, Unknown). Covariate parameter estimates are not published here, as these are not the subject of this study.
(b) Proportional odds-ratio presented – odds of being classified in a worse clinical status at day 15 for Remdesivir compared with Control.

Time-to-death

(a) Each hazard ratio presented is estimated from a separate model, each adjusted for: baseline age-group (<50, 50-69, 60-69, 70-79, 80+), sex, no. of key comorbidities (0, 1, 2+) [where key
comorbidities are: any diabetes, hypertension, obesity, CCD, CPD, asthma], dexamethasone use during hospitalisation (Yes, No, Unknown), Viral Pneumonia recorded in the complications
CRF (Yes, No, Unknown). Covariate parameter estimates are not published here, as these are not the subject of this study.
(b) Time intervals are chosen such that approximately one third of recoveries took place in each interval. The sample size decreases with each subsequent time-period, as those who recover or
are censored prior to the time-period are excluded from the model.
