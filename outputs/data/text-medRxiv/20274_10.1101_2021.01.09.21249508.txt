ABSTRACT

27

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a rapidly spreading infectious illness that causes a

28

debilitating respiratory syndrome. Supportive therapy remains the standard for mild-to-

29

moderate cases, including treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

30

e.g. ibuprofen, however such medications may increase COVID-19 complications when used

31

in patients with acute viral respiratory infections. P450 enzyme CYP2C9 are known to be

32

involved in the metabolism of NSAIDs, however, their pharmacogenetic data are limited.

33

This study aims to better understand the genetic landscape of CYP2C9 sequence variation

34

across different ethnic and geographic groups, in correlation with ibuprofen dosing

35

guidelines. A cohort of 101 Jordanian Arab samples were retrospectively recruited and

36

genotyped using Affymetrix DMET Plus Premier Package. This study identified 18 single

37

nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CYP2C9 in these Jordanian Arabs, within the

38

context of over 100,000 global subjects in 417 published reports. Genetic structure analysis

39

across populations revealed that Jordanian Arabs share the closest CYP2C9 sequence

40

homology to Near East and European populations. However, European populations are 7.2x

41

more likely to show impaired ibuprofen metabolism than Sub-Saharan populations, and 4.5x

42

more likely than East Asian ancestry populations.. This is the most comprehensive and up-to-

43

date analysis for CYP2C9 allele frequencies across multi-ethnic populations world-wide. The

44

use of modern genomic tools coupled with a proactive assessment of the most likely gene-

45

drug candidates will lead to a better understanding of the role of pharmacogenetics for

46

COVID-19 and more effective treatments.

Introduction

50

A global pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global

51

healthcare crisis resulting from high infection and mortality rates1. For suspected or

52

confirmed cases of COVID-19, requiring urgent care for conditions such as fever and/or sore

53

throat, pharmacological management may require antibiotics and/or analgesics as an

54

alternative2. In addition, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) e.g. ibuprofen, may

55

be prescribed for the management of pain and fever. However, uncertainty related to

56

infection etiology and efficacy, and emerging concerns related to the use of common NSAIDs

57

such as ibuprofen, have presented additional challenges in the treatment of COVID-193,4.

58

Patients in France and Europe showing symptoms of COVID-19 were recommended

59

paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen, as treatment with ibuprofen could

60

exacerbate the condition3. Ibuprofen may offer symptomatic relief, and could provide

61

healthcare professionals additional time to deliver customized care and prevent the spread of

62

infection. Although this strategy is not always reliable since individuals may respond

63

differently to similar treatments.

64

Genetic factors are one of the major contributors to individual or ethnic differences in

65

drug therapeutic efficacy and toxicity5,6. Consequently, host genetics and demography

66

associated with COVID-19 are crucial aspects of infection and prognosis, hence, integral

67

medication dosing might need to be altered based on a patient’s genetic information7,8. There

68

are several gene variants that alter how an individual's body metabolizes and processes

69

COVID-19 therapies, potentially increasing the risk of undesirable adverse effects. The

70

cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9, facilitates metabolism of several NSAIDs including

71

ibuprofen, and CYP2C9 allele frequencies have been shown to vary substantially across

72

diverse ethnic groups9,10.

73

In March 2020, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)

74

published a pharmacogenetic guideline on NSAIDs, with specific therapeutic

75

recommendations for celecoxib, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, fornoxicam, feloxicam, firoxicam,

76

and fenoxicam based on CYP2C9 phenotype11. The phenotype was derived from an activity

77

score, obtained by the sum of two individual allele scores. Recent meta-analysis of CYP2C9

78

alleles and ibuprofen concentrations using the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base

79

(PharmGKB), showed strong correlations between the CYP2C9*2 allele (g.47639A>C;

80

p.(Ile359Leu)) and CYP2C9*3 allele (g.47639A>C; p.(Ile359Leu)) with plasma levels of

81

ibuprofen12-16. Based on these results, PharmGKB assigned the highest level of evidence

82

(level 1A) to these associations9, indicating strong evidence of pharmacokinetic (PK) or

83

pharmacodynamic (PD) alteration7. Furthermore, CPIC level A and B gene/drug pairs have

84

sufficient evidence for at least one prescribing action to be recommended. In contrast, CPIC

85

level C and D gene/drug pairs are considered as having inadequate evidence for actionability

86

to have prescribing recommendations. For example, CYP2C8*3 with level C, has insufficient

87

evidence for recommendations in ibuprofen prescription. However, this study shows that

88

current pharmacogenomics databases can be leveraged to enhance the identification of

89

CYP2C9 alleles, and to determine population differences in drug response/toxicity events.

90

Results from this study have wide ranging impacts on the targeted treatment of COVID-19

91

patients across broad geographic ranges and ethnic backgrounds, and facilitates drug

92

development processes.

This study retrospectively included 101 unrelated Jordanian participants, of which 54 were

97

male and 47 were female. After a signed informed consent, a 3ml venous blood sample was

98

collected in 3ml EDTA tubes from each participant at the Princess Haya Biotechnology

99

Centre between May 2010 and December 2011. Blood samples were stored at 4°C until DNA

100

extraction. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Jordan University of Science and

101

Technology approved this study on 4/7/2013 under registration number 67/2/2013.

102

103

DNA extraction and genotyping

104

Genomic DNA was extracted from each blood sample using the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit

105

(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality of the

106

purified DNA was determined by using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo

107

Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA).

108

Genotyping was accomplished using the Affymetrix DMET (Drug Metabolizing

109

Enzymes and Transporters) Plus Premier microarray assay (Santa Clara, CA, USA) to test for

110

drug metabolism associations. The DMET array contains 1,936 drug metabolism markers

111

consisting of 1,931 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and five copy number variations

112

(CNVs) in 225 genes, including 47 phase I enzymes, 80 phase II enzymes, 52 transporters

113

and 46 other genes. These genetic variants were multiplex genotyped using molecular

114

inversion probe (MIP) technology17. The profiles for the genotyping call rates and

115

concordance comparisons, were generated by the DMET console software v1.3 (Thermo

116

Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), based on the Bayesian robust linear model with

117

Mahalanobis (BRLMM) distance classifier algorithm18,19. Genotypes were determined for

118

each SNP site and reported as homozygous wild-type, heterozygous, homozygous variant,

119

and ‘no call’ in the case of a lack of genotype call. SNPs with a call rate of less than 99%

120

were excluded from subsequent analyses. Statistical and genetic analyses were performed for

121

selection and validation using Microsoft Excel and SPSS v16. Linkage disequilibrium (LD)

122

analysis was performed to identify non-random SNP associations between populations. LD

123

was in concordance with all worldwide-distributed 1kG-p3 populations20. The genotype and

124

allele frequencies were calculated and tested using the chi-square (χ2) test and the Hardy–

125

Weinberg equilibrium formula (p>0.05). The workflow applied in this study is

126

summarized in Supplementary material file (Fig. S1).

127

128

Selection of CYP2C9 variants

129

LD analysis was performed using the LDlink tool to generate D' and r2 values21, and a matrix

130

was generated for visualization. These allele frequencies were compared to 139 different

131

CPIC reports from European and Near Eastern population groups (Table S1). The statistical

132

comparison of allele frequencies on experimental data and reference populations were

133

performed by Pearson's χ2 test with Bonferroni correction and the negative logarithm of the

134

adjusted significance values [-log10 (adj.p.val)] using the R statistical package v3.6.2 with

135

ggplot2 and visualized using Rstudio v1.3.1056 (Boston, MA). The assembled DNA flanking

136

sequence for each of the SNP loci was also subjected to BLAT22 to determine the specificity

137

of the array’s probes matched to the target sequence set. A probe alignment was considered to

138

be specific if 40 consecutive base pairs of the probe were fully aligned with the target

139

sequence17. In order to detect the homologous sequences, which likely result in false-positive

140

or false-negative variant calls, sequence similarity searches were performed using the

141

Ensembl BLAST/BLAT search programs with default parameters.

142

143

Population structure analyses

144

To identify cryptic relatedness from the genomic data, principal component analysis (PCA)

145

was performed using the base R function “prcomp” within the R software package and

146

multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots were generated from the PCA results using ggfortify

147

and ggplot223. Cryptic population structure was inferred using CYP2C9 SNP data to identify

the ancestral relatedness between the Jordanian Arab population and three defined datasets:

149

1,810 individuals from 22 populations from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase III (1kG-p3)

150

dataset, excluding admixed populations (Table S2); 3,413 individuals from 18 global reports

151

(Table S3); and 31,880 individuals from 118 reports from the European (EUR) and Near

152

Eastern (NEA) populations from the CPIC updated report in March 2020. For a detailed

153

description, refer to the supplementary material.

154

Fixation Index (Fst) was used to quantify population differentiation from genetic

155

structure using SNP allele frequencies. The R package “BEDASSLE” function was used to

156

assess genetic similarity between ethnic populations by generating pairwise Fst values (0

157

indicates no divergence, 1 indicates complete separation) between the Jordanian Arab

158

population and the other populations listed above23.

159

160

Pharmacogenetic analyses

161

The frequencies of the 13 actionable pharmacogenomics biomarkers were assessed

162

cumulatively for the Jordanian Arabs against nine biogeographical groups, consisting of

163

101,407 individuals from 412 global populations11,24. The total frequency of two SNPs with

164

a Level 1A for the Jordanian Arab population within nine geographically-defined groups

165

were mapped for global impact visualization of allele frequency on ibuprofen response

166

(Supplementary material file). Inferred frequency for CYP2C9*1 was excluded from our

167

biogeographical analyses as no population studies have tested for all known variant alleles,

168

and *1 was not genotyped directly in many studies11 (see Supplemental Material for

169

populations details).

RESULTS

174

Selection and analysis of CYP2C9 Variations

175

It is worth mentioning that we have screened all the variants listed in Table S5 for variants

176

fulfilling our selection criteria to ensure that our pipeline had not missed any known causal or

177

candidate variants in this gene. Four CYP2C9 variants across 101 Jordanian individuals of

178

Arab descent associated with reduced enzyme function were selected (Table S5 and S6). The

179

defective allele *2 was the most abundant variant (0.094), followed by allele *3 (0.084). In

180

addition, two rare variants, g.55323A>T; and g.55221C>T; were also detected. These two

181

SNPs had frequencies of less than 0.05. CYP2C9 *2 and *3 together accounted for 0.178 of

182

the allele frequency and about 0.327 of the reduced or non-functional genotype/phenotype

183

associations. The four genotype frequencies CYP2C9 *1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3 and *2/*3 were

184

0.673, 0.158, 0.139 and 0.03, respectively. Moreover, the genotype frequencies showed no

185

deviation from HWE (p>0.05; Table 1).

186

Significant D' values were observed spanning the entire genomic region, following

187

LD measurements for pairs of SNPs distributed across the 52-kb region. Most allele pairs of

188

CYP2C9 have a D′ value equal to 1.0 (indicating complete LD), whereas, r2 values across the

189

same region, show a LD block between the *7 allele (g.5080C>A) at exon 1 and the *14

190

allele (g.8577G>A) at exon 3. A clear LD block was also observed between CYP2C9*3

191

(g.47639A>C) at exon 3 and between g.55323A>T at exon 9, crossing an approximately 8-kb

192

region (Fig. 1A and Table S7). The experimental allele of CYP2C9*7 (g.5080C>A;

193

p.(Leu19Ile)) was significantly different from the other sampled populations (p = 4.9x1022;

194

Table S8). However, the nucleotide BLAT search showed that the DNA sequence obtained

195

from the flanking region of this SNP (124 bp) had 100% sequence identity with the

196

CYP2C19 genes at the region of 10:94762716-94762839. Therefore, this variant was

197

excluded from the analyses since the individual probes in the MIP assay only bind to a

198

genomic footprint of ~40 bp. Thus, the homologous sequences would likely result in false-

199

positive or false-negative variant calls17.

200

201

Genetic structure of CYP2C9 across populations

202

The two leading principal components from the 14 variants shared between the Jordanian

203

Arab population and the 22 global populations from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase III

204

(1kG-p3) dataset (Fig. 2A), captured 60.63% and 21.38% of the variance respectively,

205

showing a well-defined separation between the Jordanian Arab population and African, East

206

Asian, and South Asian super populations. The Jordanian Arab population had a close

207

affinity with European populations, and validated by pairwise Fst analyses (Table S9). The

208

lowest level of differentiation was observed between the Jordanian Arab population and

209

British in England and Scotland (Fst = 5.97x10-3), followed by Iberian (Fst = 6.39x10-3) and

210

Finnish in Finland (Fst = 6.69x10-3) populations, whereas the greatest divergence was

211

observed with Gambian in western divisions in the Gambia (Fst = 8.54x10-2).

212

Lack of genomic data for additional ethnic groups in the 1000 Genomes Project such

213

as near eastern populations, can reduce robustness and potentially result in biased

214

geographic-based genomic analysis. Therefore, a secondary analysis was performed to

215

include under-represented populations. The two leading principal components shared

216

between the Jordanian Arab population, and the 18 global reports including the Near Eastern

217

population for *1, *2 and *3 captured 98.35% and 1.62% of the variance, respectively,

218

suggesting a well-defined genetic separation between Jordanian Arabs and African and East

219

Asian populations (Fig. 2B). In addition, defined clusters of European and Near Eastern

220

populations were found, which were further validated using pairwise Fst analyses (Table

221

S10). The lowest level of differentiation was observed between the Jordanian Arab

222

population and Saudi Arabian population (Fst = 7.4x10-4), followed by Italian (Fst = 1.62x10-

) and Turkish populations (Fst = 1.8x10-3), whereas the greatest divergence was observed

with the Korean population (Fst = 1.13x10-1).
These findings were investigated further by increasing the coverage of the variant

225

226

analysis to include populations from 118 reports across European and Near Eastern groups.

227

MDS analysis showed that Jordanian Arabs cluster with Turkish, Israeli, Caucasian, Italian,

228

Romanian, Iranian and Lebanese populations (Fig. 2C).

229

230

Pharmacogenetic analyses by biogeographic grouping system

231

Across the nine biogeographical groups, 27% of subjects were of East Asian origin, followed

232

by Europeans (26%), South Central Asians (13%), Near Easterns (12%), Americans (7%),

233

Latinos (6%), African Americans/Afro-Caribbeans (4%), Sub-Saharan Africans (4%), and

234

Oceanians (1%; Table S11). Distinct differences were found among these populations, with

235

direct impacts on ibuprofen clinical outcomes (Fig. 3B). The CYP2C9 *2 and *3 allele

236

frequencies were significantly higher in the Central/South Asian origin (0.224), followed by

237

Near Easterns (0.212), Europeans (0.203), Jordanian Arabs (0.178), and Latinos (0.116),

238

indicating a decreased metabolism and clearance of ibuprofen as compared to Americans

239

(0.064), Oceanians (0.045), East Asians (0.04), African Americans/Afro-Caribbeans (0.036)

240

and Sub-Saharan Africans (0.024; Table S12). These significant variant alleles and genotypes

241

were classified as PharmGKB Level 1A evidence with reduced enzyme function, therefore

242

are associated with recommended changes to ibuprofen dosing7. Interpretation of the

243

translation into specific dosing guidelines for individual ibuprofen-diplotype pairs 7,11 showed

244

that European populations are 7.2x more likely to show impaired CYP2C9 metabolism than

245

Sub-Saharan populations, and 4.5x more likely than East Asian populations (Tables S13 and

246

S14).

247

Interestingly, a large number of generally less common alleles were also identified

248

(Table S15). Allele *9 (g.15560A>G) was significantly over-represented in Sub-Saharan

249

Africans (0.13), but was not detected in other global populations (Fig. 3A). Alleles *5

250

(g.47644C>G), *6 (g.15626delA), *8 (g.3260T>C; g.8652G>A; g.8652G>T) and *11

251

(g.47567C>T) were significantly over-represented in African populations (Sub-Saharan

252

African and African Americans/Afro-Caribbean) and under-represented in other populations.

253

East Asian populations over-represented alleles *42 (g.8573C>T) and *55 (g.47645C>A)

254

(Tables S16 and S17).

DISCUSSION

257

Although no direct evidence of pharmacogenomics data in patients with COVID-19 was

258

available at the time of writing this manuscript, there are plausible mechanisms by which

259

genetic determinants may play a role in adverse drug responses. Having diverse population

260

genetic information and genetic databases, could help clinicians avoid additional risks for

261

treating COVID-19 patients. In this work, several genetic markers were analyzed across

262

diverse ethnic backgrounds to identify population differences in drug responses and toxicity

263

events associated with ibuprofen treatment. Moreover, controversy arose on the use of

264

ibuprofen due to the possibility of a worse COVID-19 prognosis3,4. Results from this study

265

showed that pharmacogenomics studies can be leveraged to enhance the understanding of

266

adverse reactions to the treatment of COVID-19 symptoms and support advancement of drug

267

development pipelines.

268

Approximately 33% within 101 individuals of Jordanian Arab descent were either

269

intermediate or poor metabolizers of ibuprofen based on the sequence variant analysis of

270

CYP2C9. The g.55323A>T marker was also found to be in LD with the variant of

271

CYP2C9*3 (Fig. 1A, Table S7), which is consistent with the recently published PharmVar

272

change adding g.55323A>T to the *3 haplotype definition25. The CYP2C9*7 was

273

significantly different from other populations, and the nucleotide BLAT search revealed a

274

100% sequence identity with CYP2C19. Further analysis indicated that the array probe used

275

for genotyping was not able to bind specifically with the target SNP, due to non-specific

276

binding to another genomic region. Awareness of problematic regions is critical during test

277

design and reporting to guide decision regarding exclusion of regions and/or whether

278

alternative assays must be used. This is particularly the case for CYP2C9*7, where both

279

statistical and genetic tests revealed a homologous sequence that may result in false positive

280

or false negative variant calls.

281

MDS analysis showed that the Jordanian Arab population clustered with multiple

282

regions within European and Near Eastern. MDS results were further validated by the

283

pairwise Fst values, where the lowest level of differentiation was observed between the

284

Jordanian Arab population and Saudi Arabian followed by the Italian and Turkish.

285

Collectively these results showed that the current Jordanian population today falls into two

286

main groups: one sharing more genetic characteristics with modern-day Europeans and

287

Central Asians, and the other with closer genetic affinities to Arabia26. These autosomal

288

analyses are in agreement with recent studies using large-scale genomics that indicated three

289

major genetic events related to Levant populations, including Jordanian. During the late

290

neolithic, gene pools across Anatolia and the Southern Caucasus mixed, resulting in an

291

admixture cline27. The second event occurred during the Early Bronze Age, where Northern

292

Levant populations, a region flanked by the Middle East and Europe, experienced gene flow

293

in a process that likely involved a yet to-be-sampled neighboring population from

294

Mesopotamia27. The most recent event for the modern Levant was largely determined by

295

subsequent repopulations and mass movements associated with multiple cultural changes

296

within the last two millennia. This appeared to have facilitated and maintained admixture

297

between culturally different populations28. Conversion of the region's populations to Islam,

298

appeared to have also introduced major rearrangements in the populations genetic relations

299

with an admixture of culturally similar populations26. In general, the Jordanian population

300

was not significantly different from their Levantine neighbours, and fit consistently into a

301

Middle East-Anatolia-Balkan-Caucasus geographic and genetic continuum29.

302

Mapped frequencies of CYP2C9 genotypes of *2 and *3 alleles based on both the

303

PharmGKB meta-analysis7,12-16 and the CPIC updated report11, showed that European

304

populations were 7.2x more likely to show impaired CYP2C9 metabolism than Sub-Saharan

305

populations, and 4.5x more likely than East Asian ancestry populations (Fig. 4, Table S13).

306

Inference that a higher proportion of East Asian and African ancestry populations have

307

normal ibuprofen metabolism, and therefore are less susceptible to complications for

308

ibuprofen-based treatment.

309

These findings are supported by recent European reports of potential harm with

310

ibuprofen usage in patients with COVID-19 symptoms3. Further supported by multiple

311

reports, the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) of

312

France, issued a warning in April 2019 about the use of NSAIDs for patients with infectious

313

diseases based on an analysis of 20 years of safety data of ibuprofen and ketoprofen.

314

Consequently, the French regulatory body was concerned that existing infections might be

315

worsened by the use of these two NSAIDs30. Following this analysis, the European

316

Committee in charge of risk assessment and pharmacovigilance (PRAC) concluded in April

317

2020 that taking ibuprofen or ketoprofen (oral, rectal or injectable) can lead, in certain

318

infections, to mask symptoms such as fever or pain, leading to a delay in the management of

319

the patient with the consequence of a risk of complications of the infection. The PRAC also

320

concluded that this risk has been observed for bacterial infections in the context of

321

chickenpox and pneumonia30. Furthermore, one large case-control study found a clear

322

association between NSAIDs and respiratory complications, regardless of whether the

323

NSAIDs were taken long term or as a treatment for acute illness, suggesting that the

324

association was not simply a result of increased prescription in response to acute illness31.

325

However, additional research is necessary to clarify whether further variants should

326

be incorporated into clinical decision making. Collectively, this work demonstrates the

327

capability and application of large-scale pharmacogenomics studies to elucidate genetic

328

variation effects on NSAID efficacy in COVID-19 patients. Ultimately, the implementation

329

of pharmacogenetics in clinical settings can leads to more efficient, safer, and cost-effective

330

treatments.
