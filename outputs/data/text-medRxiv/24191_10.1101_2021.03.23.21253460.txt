Abstract

30

Serological assessment of SARS-CoV-2 specific responses are an essential tool for determining

31

the prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infections in the population especially when testing occurs

32

after symptoms have developed and limited contact tracing is in place. The goal of our study was

33

to test a new 10-plex electro-chemiluminescence-based assay to measure IgM and IgG responses

34

to the spike proteins from multiple human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, assess the

35

epitope specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response against full-length spike protein,

36

receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain of the spike protein, and the nucleocapsid

37

protein. We carried out the assay on samples collected from three sample groups: subjects

38

diagnosed with COVID-19 from the U.S. Army hospital at Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek,

39

South Korea; healthcare administrators from the same hospital but with no reported diagnosis of

40

COVID-19; and pre-pandemic samples. We found that the new CoV-specific multiplex assay

41

was highly sensitive allowing plasma samples to be diluted 1:30,000 with a robust signal. The

42

reactivity of IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and IgM responses to SARS-

43

CoV-2 spike protein could distinguish COVID-19 samples from non-COVID-19 and pre-

44

pandemic samples. The data from the three sample groups also revealed a unique pattern of

45

cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and seasonal

46

coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43. Our findings show that the CoV-2 IgM response is highly

47

specific while the CoV-2 IgG response is more cross-reactive across a range of human CoVs and

48

also showed that IgM and IgG responses show distinct patterns of epitope specificity. In

49

summary, this multiplex assay was able to distinguish samples by COVID-19 status and

50

characterize distinct trends in terms of cross-reactivity and fine-specificity in antibody responses,

51

underscoring its potential value in diagnostic or serosurveillance efforts.

Introduction

53

The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is unparalleled in recent history, and countries have

54

developed diverse approaches to combat and manage transmission. Most countries are attempting

55

to curtail the infection rates through strict social distancing rules, rigorous testing, and contact

56

tracing of individuals potentially exposed to infectious individuals. A population-wide serological

57

assessment of SARS-CoV-2 immunity would have several applications: (a) conduct surveillance

58

to determine exposure rates, (b) investigate the feasibility of using antibody titers as markers of

59

immunity, (c) examine the durability of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses and protection from

60

reinfection, (d) establish the serological landscape of pan-CoV antibody responses and determine

61

whether pre-existing immunity to common human CoVs affect COVID-19 disease course; (e)

62

screen individuals for participation in COVID-19 vaccine trials or for prioritization for receiving

63

FDA-approved or emergency use authorized COVID-19 vaccines; and (f) screen for antibody

64

reactivity to newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains.

65

Several tests have been developed for measuring SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM

66

responses are currently available [1] and the data obtained from these tests suggest that SARS-

67

CoV-2-specific antibody responses are reliably measurable by 2-3 weeks after onset of symptoms

68

[2-5]. The presence of antibodies was detected in a minority of COVID-19 patients within one

69

week of onset and seroconversion ranges from 90 to 100% by 15 days after onset. [6, 7]. IgM

70

seroconversion is seen around 12 days from onset, and IgG seroconversion around 13 days from

71

onset [8], with the caveat that studies on antibody response dynamics have so far largely focused

72

on convenience samples that may fail to capture the earliest emergence of these responses.

73

However, recent findings suggest the possibility of a lack of durable antibody responses, whereby

74

some percentage of individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 that were seropositive

75

following infection and later became seronegative during early convalescence, especially in cases

76

where the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in asymptomatic infection or low disease severity [9,

77

10]. This finding agrees with previous studies in humans with other coronaviruses in that antibody-

78

responses to CoV infections can be short-lived [11-13]. However, the durability of SARS-CoV-2

79

responses remains poorly characterized, and it is unclear how durability varies with respect to

80

antibody fine-specificity, isotype profile, cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses, and how these

81

aspects of the humoral immunity contribute to durable protection from reinfection.

82

Although numerous SARS-CoV-2-specific serological assays have been developed [14,

83

15], additional challenges remain in using these assays for surveillance or clinical management

84

[16] including: 1) assay throughput, 2) the specificity of assay readouts to SARS-CoV-2 as

85

compared to other related coronaviruses 3) and the need to perform sample testing at multiple

86

dilutions due to the narrow linear range of the respective assay platform. Recently, we compared

87

a newly developed multiplexed serological assay based on electro-chemiluminescence (ECLIA)

88

customized for malaria serosurveillance with a qualified standard ELISA [17]. The results

89

demonstrated superiority of the ECLIA-based assay in several aspects including a wide linear

90

range eliminating the need for serial dilutions of test samples, low variability, robust

91

reproducibility of the assay, and no signal reduction due to antigenic competition when testing

92

closely related antigens. Given that only 0.1 µL of sample is needed for the assay, and with the use

93

of the pre-manufactured CoV antigen plates described here, five antigen plates (450 samples)

94

could be run by a single operator in five hours, and with substantially higher throughput if using a

95

liquid handler, this platform would be appropriate for use in high-throughput serosurveillance

96

applications.

97

The objective of the current study was to test the performance of a multiplexed pan-CoV

98

ECLIA-based assay regarding its ability to establish a serological profile of responses to common

99

beta CoVs (HKU-1, OC43), MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. For this study, three

100

sample groups were compiled subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 from the Brian D. Allgood

101

Army Community Hospital at Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, South Korea from March 13 to

102

April 18, 2020; healthcare administrators from the same hospital during the same time period but

103

with no diagnosis of COVID-19; and pre-pandemic samples from several sources in the United

104

States in 2019. The comparison of the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 samples from the same site

105

will enable us to compare antibody responses from COVID-19 diagnosed individuals from other

106

individuals the same location and pandemic time period, who may have been exposed, but were

107

not symptomatic or diagnosed with COVID-19. Comparison with pre-pandemic samples will

108

determine whether there are differences in CoV exposure between pre-pandemic samples and

109

pandemic samples, even in cases where there was no COVID-19 diagnosis. Our findings

110

demonstrate the utility of this assay for SARS-CoV-2-serosurveillance based on its high sensitivity

111

and specificity as well as its ability to discern between pre-existing immunity to common human

112

CoVs and SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and Methods

115

Sample Collection

116

For this analysis, plasma samples were obtained from a public health investigation of

117

COVID-19 patients at the Brian D. Allgood Army Community Hospital (BDAACH) at Camp

118

Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, South Korea from March 13 to April 18, 2020 (WRAIR#2755). Three

119

sample groups were compiled: patients diagnosed with COVID-19; health care personnel assigned

120

to the same hospital during the same time period whose duties did not include regular interaction

121

with patients and who did not have a diagnosis of COVID-19 (these individuals were assumed to

122

be unexposed or minimally exposed from living and working in an outbreak setting with a very

123

low prevalence of COVID-19 at the time of collection); and pre-pandemic samples from several

124

sources in the United States in 2019. COVID-19 and Control subjects were drawn from the same

125

overall population: the U.S. Department of Defense military, civilian, and contractor population

126

working at Camp Humphreys. The comparison of the COVID-19 and Control samples from the

127

same site enabled us to measure antibody responses from COVID-19 diagnosed individuals from

128

those in the same location and pandemic time period, who may have been exposed, but were not

129

symptomatic or diagnosed with COVID-19. Samples from ten COVID-19 subjects and eight

130

control subjects, matched by study location and population, were obtained and compared to a

131

similar number of pre-pandemic samples (ten) using the multiplex ECLIA assay. As this was a

132

retrospective analysis of COVID-19 samples collected during a public health investigation of a

133

local outbreak, no a priori power calculation was carried out.

134

All COVID-19 patients were diagnosed using a nasopharyngeal swab and RT-PCR-based

135

diagnostic assay. All Control subjects were also tested via nasopharyngeal swab and RT-PCR and

confirmed to be negative for COVID-19 at the time of sample collection. COVID-19 disease

137

severity was assessed as asymptomatic, mild (symptomatic but not interfering with daily activity),

138

moderate (interfering with daily activity but not requiring hospitalization), and severe (preventing

139

daily activity and requiring hospitalization). All samples collected at BDAACH were sent to

140

Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) for analysis. Pre-pandemic samples were

141

obtained from a WRAIR blood collection protocol (WRAIR#2567) based on sample availability

142

from August 2019 conducted in Silver Spring, Maryland. Finally, two pre-pandemic samples were

143

commercially available as pooled plasma samples from GeminiBio (GemCell™ U.S. Origin

144

Human Serum AB, Cat.No 100-512) that were delivered to WRAIR in 2018.

145

Ethics approval and consent to participate

146

The plasma sample use was reviewed by the WRAIR Human Subjects’ Protection Branch which

147

determined that the research does not involve human subjects (NHSR protocol WRAIR #2567,

148

WRAIR#2755, #EID-029) as the samples used were de-identified and no link between samples

149

and subjects exists.

(Expi 293 F) and printed onto the 10-plex plates by Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC (Cat No

154

K15362U (IgG), and K15363U (IgM), MSD, Rockville, Maryland). The antigens used were: HA-

155

trimer Influenza A (Hong Kong H3), spike (soluble ectodomain with T4 trimerization domain)

156

trimers for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and betacoronaviruses HKU-1 and OC43,

157

as well as the spike N-terminal domain (NTD, Q14-L303 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike sequence),

161

The MSD V-PLEX platform was used as 10-plex assays utilizing the pre-printed antigens

162

described above with each printed on its own spot. Blocker A Solution (Cat.No R93BA, MSD)

163

was added to the plates at 150 µl/well. The plates were sealed and incubated at room temperature

164

(RT) for 1h on a plate shaker, shaking at 700 rpm. The plates were washed three times with 1x

165

MSD Wash Buffer (Cat.No R61AA, 150 µl/well). Sera were diluted to 1:1000 dilution with

166

Diluent 100 (Cat. No R50AA, MSD) and added to each well (50 µl/well). The same dilution was

167

used for both IgM and IgG measurements. Plates were sealed and incubated at RT for 2h on a plate

168

shaker, shaking at 700 rpm, then washed three times with 1x MSD Wash Buffer (150 µl/well). The

169

detection antibody, SULFO-TAG either with anti-human IgG (Cat.No D20JL, MSD) antibody or

170

anti-human IgM (Cat.No D20JP, MSD) was diluted to 2 µg/ml in Diluent 100 (MSD) and added

171

to the wells (50 µl/well). The plates were sealed and incubated at RT for 1h on a plate shaker,

172

shaking at 700 rpm. After washing, 150 µl a working solution of MSD GOLD Read Buffer B

173

(Cat.No R60AM, MSD) was added to each well and immediately the plates were read on the

174

MESO QuickPlex SQ 120 (MSD), per manufacturer’s instructions. We assessed the dynamic

175

range of the MSD V-PLEX platform using this antigen panel across a serial dilution range from

176

1:1000 to 1:30,000 and found high signal-to-noise ratio and a linear response across that entire

177

span of concentrations (S1 Fig).

background. Univariate analysis comparisons between groups (COVID-19, Control, and pre-

182

COVID) were made using a Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test followed by a student’s t test or a

183

Wilcoxon signed rank test. We applied a multiple test correction using the Benjamin-Hochberg

184

method; p-values were considered significant if their adjusted p-value was < 0.05. Principal

185

Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out by normalizing and scaling the log-transformed

186

values. Data points were colored by group, and ellipses were generated corresponding to 50%

187

confidence intervals for each group, to identify general trends in the data set. Seropositivity for

188

each CoV spike antigen for a given subject was assessed based on whether the readout for that

189

antigen exceeded cutoff defined by the upper limit of the 99.9% confidence interval of the BSA

190

(negative control) response, as determined from pooling the BSA response across all subjects in

191

the study. This cutoff value was determined to be 8.85 for IgM and 8.96 for IgG in log-transformed

192

units of mean luminescence intensity. Correlation plots were generated using pairwise Pearson

193

correlation coefficients calculated from the log-transformed data. All statistical analysis was

194

carried out in R using the stats, ggplot2, and corrplot,.

209

terms of assay sensitivity, we found that COVID-19 samples had a roughly 300-fold higher IgM

210

signal to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a 1000-fold higher IgG antibodies binding to SARS-

211

CoV-2 spike antigen compared to BSA. In Control and pre-pandemic samples, there was no

212

significant difference in IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and BSA, but the IgG

213

response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike was approximately 10-fold higher (p < 10-4) than to BSA,

214

suggesting either some degree of cross-reactivity of pre-existing IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2

215

spike antigen in these samples or higher non-specific IgG binding to this antigen. We carried out

216

serial dilutions to further assess assay sensitivity (S1 Fig).

samples (n=10, red), individuals with no known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Control group, n=8,

220

dilution; plate antigens shown are: BSA (negative contol); influenza H3 trimer (reference antigen), along

221

with full-length spike proteins for CoVs: SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, OC43 and HKU1.

222

We found that COVID-19 samples showed significant higher IgM responses to the SARS-

223

COV-2 spike protein (p<10-7) than the control sample group and pre-pandemic group, while no

224

differences between the three groups were noted for BSA or influenza. On average, COVID-19

225

samples showed 100- to 200-fold higher IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen than the

226

control or pre-pandemic samples. For IgG responses, the COVID-19 samples also showed

227

no differences were seen between the sample groups in terms of their reactivity to BSA or H3.

229

Like the IgM responses, the IgG responses in the COVID-19 samples to SARS-CoV-2 spike

230

protein were approximately 100- to 200-fold higher than in the control and pre-pandemic samples.

231

In both IgM and IgG responses to CoV-2 spike protein, there was a single subject in the COVID-

233

pandemic samples. This subject had mild symptoms and their plasma sample was obtained only

234

one day following initial test positivity; it is possible this was early in the infection course and the

235

subject had not yet seroconverted.

236

Cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses

237

Next, we analyzed differences in antibody binding response to the other CoV antigens

238

between the three groups. COVID-19 subjects, in addition to showing significantly higher IgM

239

binding antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike compared to the Control and pre-COVID subjects, also

240

showed significantly higher IgM binding antibodies to SARS-CoV-1 (p < 0.001), HKU1 (p <

241

0.05), and OC43 (p < 0.01) spike proteins (Fig 1A). This data suggests significant IgM cross-

242

reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS CoV-1, HKU-1, and OC43. Likewise, we found that

243

COVID-19 subjects, in addition to showing significantly higher IgG binding antibodies to SARS-

244

CoV-2, also show significantly higher IgG binding antibodies to SARS-CoV-1 (p < 0.001) and

245

MERS-CoV (p < 0.01) spike proteins, compared with Control and pre-COVID-19 subjects,

246

suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies may be cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-1 and

247

MERS-CoV (Fig 1B).

248

To determine the distinguishing features between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 samples,

249

we generated a principal component analysis (PCA) plot of the IgM and IgG responses to these

250

five CoV spike antigens (Fig 2). The PCA using IgM data demonstrates that samples display

251

antibody responses largely along two major axes: SARS-CoV-1/SARS-CoV-2 vs. HKU1/MERS-

252

CoV. COVID-19 samples have high SARS-CoV-1/SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies while

253

Control and Pre-COVID-19 samples do not; HKU-1/OC43/MERS CoV responses appear to be

254

independent of COVID-19 status. Analyzing the IgG responses revealed that the profile of cross13

255

reactivity is different from that of IgM: samples show responses along two major axes: SARS-

256

CoV-1/SARS-CoV-2/MERS-CoV and HKU-1/OC43. COVID-19 samples show high SARS-

257

CoV-1/SARS-CoV-2/MERS-CoV responses, and responses along the HKU1/OC43 axis appear to

258

be independent of COVID-19 status.

Seropositivity across CoV antigens

265

We next sought to determine the seropositivity of these samples across the five CoV spike

266

antigens in the panel. We defined a cutoff above which a sample would be considered seropositive

267

based on the IgG and IgM signal to BSA (noise). We set the cutoff at the upper limit of the 99.9%

268

confidence interval calculated by pooling all the samples in the data set. This cutoff was

determined to be 8.46 for IgM seropositivity and 8.96 for IgG seropositivity in log transformed

units of luminescence intensity.

277

Overall, we found that 90% of the COVID-19 samples were seropositive for IgM binding

278

antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting most COVID-19 patients tested here had seroconverted by

279

the time the sample was taken (Fig 3, top). Additionally, 33% of CoV-2-seropositive COVID-19

280

samples were also seropositive for MERS-CoV, 33% were seropositive for both SARS-CoV-1,

281

and 22% to both. By contrast, none of the Control and pre-pandemic subjects were seropositive

282

for SARS-CoV-2, and 50% of the Control and 90% of the pre-pandemic samples were seropositive

283

to none of the CoV antigens, including OC43 and HKU1, again reflecting the lack of IgM response

284

detected against these seasonal CoVs. Interestingly, 50% of Control samples were seropositive for

285

MERS-CoV, compared to none of the pre-pandemic U.S. samples.

286

For the IgG responses, 90% of COVID-19 samples were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2,

287

suggesting that one (of the 10) COVID-19 patients did not seroconvert at the time the sample was

288

taken (Fig 3, bottom). Almost 60% of COVID-19 subjects that had seroconverted by IgG to

289

SARS-CoV-2 were seropositive for all four other CoVs, suggesting substantial cross-reactivity in

290

IgG SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies. Interestingly, 25% of the subjects in the Control group

291

showed seropositivity to not only SARS-CoV-2 but also to all five of the human CoVs tested,

292

similar to what was observed in the COVID-19 group. A single subject in the COVID-19 group,

293

aforementioned Subject i-0003, was seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 in both IgM and IgG responses.

294

No clear association between seropositivity and symptom severity was observed in this data set.

295

None of the subjects in the pre-COVID-19 group showed seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2,

296

but all showed seropositivity to the seasonal betacoronaviruses HKU1 and OC43. Overall two

297

broad observations can be made from this seropositivity data: 1) IgM CoV binding antibodies

298

likely reflect acute or recent infection while IgG CoV binding antibodies reflect both acute

299

infection (in the case of SARS-CoV-2) or long-term memory responses (in the case of the seasonal

301

IgM SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies.

302

Fine specificity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses

303

The multiplex assay contains additional antigenic targets of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., RBD,

304

NTD, and N (Fig 4). COVID-19 patients had significantly higher IgM levels directed at these

305

antigens compared to the control groups. While all samples in the three groups had significant

306

antibody responses to the seasonal CoVs (HKU-1, OC43), there was no significant recognition of

307

the SARS-CoV-2 antigen fragments in the Control and pre-COVID-19 samples. The hierarchy of

308

IgM binding to SARS-CoV-2 antigens reveals highest reactivity to spike and RBD, followed by

309

binding to the nucleocapsid and the least reactivity to NTD. The antibody profile of SARS-CoV-

310

2 specific IgG responses was different from the IgM profile. While COVID-19 patients had

311

significantly higher IgG binding antibodies targeting the spike, RBD and nucleoprotein, the SARS-

312

CoV-2-specific IgG responses to NTD were not significantly different between the three sample

313

groups. As before, one subject in the COVID-19 group, aforementioned Subject i-0003, was a low

314

outlier in responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD for both IgG and IgM responses.

315

To identify the relationship between the different antibody specificities, correlation

316

matrices were generated for IgM and IgG responses (Fig 4) demonstrating that the magnitude of

317

IgM SARS-CoV-2 spike binding antibodies correlated strongly with RBD responses. To a lesser

318

extent, there was also a positive correlation between the nucleocapsid and RBD specific antibodies.

319

The antibody profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG was distinct from the IgM profiles as there was

320

a weak correlation between nucleocapid and spike-specific responses and NTD with RBD specific

321

antibodies, suggesting that the fine specificity between the IgM and IgG SARS-CoV-2 spike

322

responses may differ, specifically that the IgM spike binding antibodies target epitopes largely to

We combined all the SARS-CoV-2 specific antigen readouts (full-length spike, RBD,

from Control or Pre-COVID-19 samples. Using an unsupervised PCA approach, we show that

335

these groups can be readily distinguished (Fig 5A), and that even a reduction from these 12

parameters to two, IgG response to N and IgM response to the spike protein (Fig 5B), was

337

sufficient to identify COVID-19 samples, for all subjects except the aforementioned Subject i-

338

seroconverted by IgG over the course of eight days. Mapping the data from this subject shows that

Discussion

358

In the current study, we evaluated a new multiplex coronavirus antigen panel using an

359

electro-chemiluminescence assay platform to conduct serological high-throughput testing of

360

sera/plasma. The study had two objectives: (a) determine whether the methodology is useful for

361

sero-surveillance and (b) to gain insights into serological cross-reactivity between five human

362

coronaviruses. Analysis of the high-dimensional serological data (20 parameters per sample

363

collected) revealed clear differences between pre-existing immunity and SARS-CoV-2 induced

364

antibody responses and distinct patterns of cross-reactivity in IgM and IgG responses,

365

demonstrating the value of this multiplex approach for SARS-CoV-2 serology studies.

366

The ECLIA-based MSD platform was chosen based on its superiority in previous studies

367

using malarial antigens [17, 18]. In the present study, we evaluated a pan-CoV panel of

368

recombinant proteins generated in a mammalian expression system to ensure proper glycosylation.

369

We found that the linear range of the MSD ranged from 1:1,000 to 1:30,000, which eliminates the

370

need to test serial dilutions for individual samples. An assay with such high sensitivity and

371

specificity requires only very small sample volume (facilitating longitudinal studies), and is also

372

more likely to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for longer periods of time after recovery.

373

This is critical for serosurveillance approaches, particularly in light of recent studies which report

374

sero-reversion within weeks to months of infection [19, 20]. Multiplexing the various antigens and

375

testing only at one dilution provides significant sample sparing and increases the throughput of the

376

assay. Another advantage of the MSD platform is the lack of apparent competition for antibody

377

binding between related test antigens [17] due to their physical separation within the assay wells.

378

Such competition has the potential to introduce significant artifacts when antigen-antibody binding

379

occurs in a liquid phase as is the case in fluorescent bead-based flow cytometry (e.g. Luminex)

380

[17]. This aspect is critical to the current study where the spike proteins of five CoVs are

381

simultaneously being tested.

382

While the ECLIA assay tests reactivity to multiple antigens simultaneously, the assay must

383

ultimately be validated against samples from individuals with known exposure to each antigen in

384

the panel to determine thresholds for seropositivity and assess the specificity. Here we provide this

385

validation for SARS-CoV-2 antigens using samples known to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and

386

utilized a single threshold for defining seropositivity based on negative controls, but cross-

387

reactivity in antibody responses between the CoV antigens necessitates individual validation of

388

responses to each antigen to maximize specificity. This limitation is highlighted in the apparent

389

50% IgM seropositivity for MERS-CoV in the Control Group. While there was a MERS outbreak

390

in South Korea in 2015, there were only 186 confirmed cases in that outbreak [21] and a more

391

likely explanation is that this reflects a cross-reactivity from immunity to a related beta

392

coronavirus. On a similar note, we were surprised to find 25% IgG seropositivity for SARS-CoV-

393

2 in the Control group. Given that they were all seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 by IgM, this suggests

394

the possibility of either a prior asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or cross-reactivity from

395

immunity to another coronavirus.

396

Assessing the serological landscape of CoV-specific IgM and IgG responses resulted in

397

several key observations: 1) IgG seropositivity to seasonal OC43 and HKU1 as well as influenza

398

H3 was high, while IgM seropositivity to these antigens was low; 2) IgM seropositivity to SARS-

399

CoV-2 was highly specific, with 90% seropositivity in COVID-19 samples and 0% seropositivity

400

in Control or Pre-COVID samples; 3) SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses were highly cross-reactive with

401

almost 60% of SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositive samples being seropositive for all five CoV spike

402

antigens; and 4) IgM and IgG SARS-CoV-2 spike responses appear to show different fine

403

specificities, with IgM spike responses being largely recapitulated by the SARS-CoV-2 RBD

404

antigen, while IgG spike responses were not. Taken together these observations suggest a few

405

explanations. First, that the IgM response measured here largely reflect short-term antibody

406

responses to acute or recent infections, while the IgG response here reflects long-term memory

407

responses (in the case of the seasonal influenza H3, OC43, and HKU1) and/or later-stage, possibly

408

affinity-matured, responses (in the case of COVID-19 samples). Accordingly, the early IgM

409

response is highly specific to SARS-CoV-2 and focused on the RBD, while the late IgG response

410

is broadly cross-reactive to many CoVs and includes non-RBD or RBD-adjacent epitopes. One

411

immunological explanation for this pattern of responses is that the SARS-CoV-2 IgM response is

412

naïve-derived and thus highly specific to SARS-CoV-2, while the IgG response is largely memory-

413

derived, from cross-reactive B cells from prior CoV infections, and thus biased towards conserved

414

or broadly cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.

415

Different origins of the CoV-2 IgM and IgG response (naïve vs. memory derived) could

416

explain the apparent near-simultaneous emergence of IgM and IgG responses [22], lacking the

417

interval period thought to be associated isotype-class switching in a primary infection, that has

418

also been observed in SARS in 2003 [23]. Wec et al [24] showed that the memory B cell repertoire

419

from an individual that survived SARS-CoV-1 infection in 2003 contained hundreds of B cells

420

that were broadly neutralizing across multiple human CoVs, including CoV-2, suggesting they

421

derived from memory B cells to prior CoV infections. Further corroborating evidence is found by

422

Ng et al. [25] who found that approximately 10-20% of pre-pandemic or non-CoV-2 infected

423

samples showed CoV-2-reactive IgG responses while none showed CoV-2-specific IgM

424

responses, very similar to our findings. They found that these cross-reactive CoV-2-reactive IgG

425

antibodies largely target the more highly conserved spike S2 domain, not the S1 domain that

426

contains the RBD, while CoV-2 infection induced IgG and IgM antibodies target both S1 and S2

427

domains, supporting the theory that pre-existing CoV immunity is largely biased towards

428

conserved S2 epitopes. Finally, our findings suggest that for antibody-based diagnostics and

429

serosurveillance, IgM and CoV-2-N-specific responses may have higher specificity than IgG and

430

CoV-2-spike-responses, and that RBD-specific IgG responses in particular might have poor

431

sensitivity in individuals with COVID-19 whose IgG response is largely derived from pre-existing

432

CoV immunity focused on conserved S2 epitopes.

433

In this study, we demonstrate that by combining IgM and IgG responses to spike and N

434

proteins, the ECLIA assay platform is able to reliably distinguish COVID-19 samples from Control

435

or Pre-COVID-19 samples. IgM responses alone were found to be highly specific, but may have

436

limited durability, while IgG responses were less specific, but potentially more long-lived –

437

possibly distinguishing acute infection from convalescence or prior exposure. Furthermore, IgG

438

responses of COVID-19 patients were more cross-reactive with spike proteins of other CoVs. This

439

is an important finding since most reports on SARS-CoV-2 serology focus on assessing the level

440

of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG. Our findings support the strategy of some point of care antibody

441

testing kits that assess IgM and IgG to identify ongoing/recent infection or previous exposure [8].

442

The fact that our unsupervised approach to combining IgM and IgG responses was able to

443

distinguish COVID-19 subjects suggests that a machine-learning approach using a larger data set

444

would have high potential for detecting acute infection status and prior exposure of an individual

445

from their serological data.

446

There were several limitations to the present study. First, the sample size is relatively small

447

and as such the study is intended primarily to demonstrate feasibility of the multiplex ECLIA

448

assay. Second, the samples were obtained through a public health investigation of a local outbreak

449

in Camp Humphreys, and thus largely consists of ‘convenience’ samples. While we matched

450

Control subjects to the same location and study population, a rigorous case-control study was

451

infeasible in the midst of an emergency outbreak response. Still, the samples reflect diversity in

452

disease onset and severity that parallels samples collected in real-world serosurveillance efforts.

453

Third, with some exceptions, the study did not include longitudinal sample collection which limits

454

its findings with respect to disease progression. Fourth, while COVID-19 and Control groups were

455

matched by site and population, pre-pandemic samples were obtained from a sample collection

456

protocol carried out domestically, in Maryland, and thus provides an imperfect pre-pandemic

457

comparison to the pandemic samples.

458

In summary, the new multiplex assay demonstrated the power of assessing both, IgM and

459

IgG specific for pan-CoVs - and SARS-CoV-2 in particular - and showed the power of this readout

460

to establish serological landscapes that contribute to our understanding of the role of cross-

461

reactivities between the various CoV and the impact on immunity and protection. Furthermore, the

462

present study also demonstrates the power of the MSD multiplex platform in quickly establishing
