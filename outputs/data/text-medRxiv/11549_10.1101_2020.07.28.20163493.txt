ABSTRACT
The expansion of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) triggered a renewed interest
in epidemiological models and on how parameters can be estimated from observed data.
Here we investigated the relationship between average number of transmissions though
time, the reproductive number Rt, and social distancing index as reported by mobile
phone data service inloco, for Goiás State, Brazil, between March and June 2020. We
calculated Rt values using EpiEstim package in R-plataform for confirmed cases
incidence curve. We found a correlation equal to -0.72 between Rt values and isolation
index at a time lag of 8 days. This correlation is also significant for half of the cities of
the State with more than 90,000 people, including the 3 largest ones (and the 7 cities
with significant correlations account for 43% of the population of the State). As the Rt
values were paired with center of the moving window of 7 days, the delay matches the
mean incubation period of the virus. Our findings reinforce that isolation index can be
an effective surrogate for modeling and epidemiological analyses and, more
importantly, helpful for anticipating the need for early interventions, a critical issue in
public health.

Key words: Social isolation, time series analysis, effective R, COVID-19, real-time
intervenion.

1. Introduction
The global expansion of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) triggered a
great and renewed interest in epidemiological models to understand temporal and
geographical patterns of expansion of the pandemics and to use such models to guide
real-time decision making to mitigate its spread (Adam, 2020; Jewell et al. 2020). As
so, it is of utmost importance to better understand clinic, immunologic and
epidemiological characteristics of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes
COVID-19 and how these epidemiological features can be translated into statistical
parameters estimated from real-time observed data to provide accurate predictive
models. In the core of such discussions lies the basic reproduction number (R0), which
reflects the average number of new infections generated from an initial infection in a
susceptible population (Ridenhour et al., 2014). This parameter synthesizes, under a
more realistic view, incubation and transmission periods of the infectious agent (Lauer,
2020; He et al. 2020), but actually it is not constant though time. During an epidemic,
changes in the effective or realized infection transmission through time (here denoted as
Rt) also reflect the demographics of the host-pathogen interaction, which is regulated by
several extrinsic environmental effects (mainly population density and social contact)
(Badr et al., 2020; Flaxman et al., 2020). Thus, in the particular case of COVID-19
pandemic, for which no specific therapeutic or preventive strategy is yet available, the
downward shifts in Rt is the expected outcome of non-pharmaceutical interventions,
including social distancing measures, sanitary measures and use of masks, to reduce the
number of transmissions. These interventions flatten the epidemic curve, allowing
healthcare systems to prepare and manage the expected cases of disease, while waiting
for a vaccine development, its high-scale production and availability to wide population.
Although it is relatively simple to estimate the infection Rt based on incidence
data and estimates of serial interval (Abbott et al., 2020), it is much more difficult to
explain its continuous temporal variation given the implementation of interventions, in
particular social distancing measures (Badr et al., 2020). Given the characteristics of
COVID-19 such as its large proportion of oligo and asymptomatic cases, the ability to
be transmitted by asymptomatic individuals, and its rapid spread, it is impossible to
accurately identify the number of infected individuals early in the epidemic. As such, it
is important to have surrogates for real-time tracking of the Rt dynamics. The broadscale real-time monitoring of mobility derived from mobile phones has been reported to

significantly correlate with decrease in the number of COVID-19 cases and increased
social distance in the population (Badr et al., 2020). Particularly in extremes of the
epidemic, social distancing estimated by mobility indicators have been one surrogate of
the Rt dynamics (Flaxman et al., 2020; Kupferschmidt, 2020; Mellan et al., 2020).
However, in addition to these extremes, it is interesting to assess whether there is a
more continuous relationship between mobility indicators and Rt over time, as this
would allow closer and timely monitoring of disease transmission, which may guide
public health responses tailored at the local level (Badr et al., 2020).
Here we investigate the relation between Rt, estimated from incidence curves of
confirmed cases, and social distancing index from mobile phone data in Goiás State in
Central Brazil and its major cities. The first COVID-19 cases were identified in Goiás in
mid-March and, shortly after, while there were only few imported confirmed cases
notified to the local surveillance system, the State Government implemented strict
social distancing measures, including cancellation of events, school and workplace
closures, closure of commercial establishments and services, except for essential
services (Silva et al., 2020) (see also https://medidas-covidbr-iptsp.shinyapps.io/painel/).
After these initial measurements, social distancing was relaxed and isolation indicators
gradually decreased, thus providing an opportunity to evaluate the continuous
relationship between Rt and social distancing index.

2. Methods
Goiás state has approximately 7 million people living in its 246 municipalities
(SEGPLAN, 2020). We considered epidemiological and mobility data from all
municipalities in the state. Isolation indicator is given as 1 - MI, where MI an index of
social mobility estimated as the percentage of electronic devices (eg., mobile phone,
tablets) leaving a radius of 200 meters from a location considered “home” by InLoco
app users (https://mapabrasileirodacovid.inloco.com.br/pt/). Isolation indicador was
obtained for each municipality in Goiás state and overall isolation was obtained by
population-weighted average. Epidemiological data for COVID-19, including
confirmed cases and deaths, were obtained from the Goiás State Health Department
(SES-GO, available at http://covid19.saude.go.gov.br/). The study period ranged from
March 16 to June 6, 2020. We estimated the Rt values based on the incidence curve of

confirmed COVID-19 symptomatic cases reported in the study period representing a
total of 14,751 cases.
We used the package EpiEstim of the R language (R Core Team, 2020; Cori et
al., 2013) to analyze incidence by dates of symptoms. Despite the significant delay for
case confirmation in the system, of approximately 7-10 days in Goiás state, we
considered cases by date of symptom onset, therefore, we have enough replications to
represent the changes disease incidence. We modeled Rt through time as a Poisson
distribution whose the expected amount of new infected individuals is, on average,
t

Rt ∑ I t − s ws, where ws is the probability distribution of time until secondary infection
s

(Cori et al., 2013), approximated by a discretized Gamma distribution (µ = 5.2 and σ =
0.6 for ws) (Abbott, et al., 2020; Kupferschmidt, 2020; Ganyani et al., 2020). The It-s is
the total incidence up to time t. We estimated the posterior distribution of Rt by
assuming a prior Gamma distribution (a = 1, b = 5). The values of Rt were calculated
using a moving average of 7-day window.
Although more sophisticated methods are available to account for delays of
disease notifications and eventually sub-notifications in the estimation of real-time Rt
(Gostic et al., 2016), we simply truncated the end of the distribution of cases as our goal
is not to have a real-time estimate of Rt, but rather to evaluate the effectiveness of
isolation indicator as a proxy of Rt shifts throughout the time series.
The isolation indicator for the entire state were correlated to the Rt values,
initially, using standard Pearson correlations. We paired the Rt values to isolation
indicator assuming that each Rt reflects the centre of each time window. However,
considering date of symptom onset and the fact that infection transmission take place in
average 5 days earlier (Lauer et al., 2020; He et al., 2020), we also calculated these
correlations considering different time lags to evaluate its behavior (from 1 to 12 days).
Because of the strong temporal autocorrelation in both time series, especially in the Rt
values (as they are calculated using overlapping moving windows), it is not appropriate
to apply a standard statistical test due to inflated Type I error. We then tested the
correlation between Rt and isolation indicator using the Dutilleul’s method to calculate
the effective degree of freedom based on temporal Moran’s I correlograms taking into
account positive autocorrelation in both time series (Dutilleul et al., 1993; Legendre
and Legendre, 2013).

We repeated the above calculations of Rt and its correlation with isolation index
for each of the 246 cities of the State. We also evaluated how correlation is affected by
uncertainty in serial interval of COVID-19 by repeating it 1000 times randomly varying
this value between 3.5 and 6.5 (see Nishiura et al. 2020).

3. Results
The early intervention by State Government in March declaring a quarantine
which resulted in a significant increase in the isolation indicator from about 25% to ca.
55% within a one-week period (Fig. 1A). However, in March there was a very small
number of confirmed cases, so as expected the COVID-19 epidemic curve grew very
slowly in the state (as well as in surroundings states encompassing the entire Central
region of Brazil) from mid-March to mid-May 2020. After this 2 month-period,
isolation indicator decreased steadily together with the observed increase of case counts
and disease transmission from mid-May onward.
The time-series of Rt (Fig. 1B) shows the effects of the early and strict social
distancing policies in Goiás State in mid-March 2020, reducing the Rt from around 2.0
to about 1.0 in middle April 2020. However, it is possible to observe that Rt increases
slowly from this point on, reaching 1.4 - 1.5 in late May/early June 2020.
However, even though overall pattern of the time-series are qualitatively similar,
when we correlate Rt and the isolation indicator at a fixed data a relatively low
correlation (r = -0.281) is observed. However, it is indeed necessary to consider a timelag to reveal a relatively high negative correlation, and it is possible to find a much
higher correlation of -0.636 at time lag 8. Hence, the number of transmissions is
associated with isolation indicator of 8 days before, as we used a 7-day time window, it
closely matches the 5 average days of incubation of the virus. The relationship may be
slightly non-linear (Fig. 2), although Spearman rank correlation is not that different
from Pearson’s correlation (-0.645). A log-transformation in both variables increased
the correlation to -0.685.
The first class autocorrelation using Moran’s I autocorrelation coefficient in both
variables is around 0.5, decreasing to zero after ca. 21 days, and thus Dutileull’s method
suggest that correlation between the two series should be effectively tested with about
18-20 degrees of freedom (and even in this case these correlations are significant at P <

0.01). For the analyses of the cities, these degrees of freedom vary a bit as a function of
the autocorrelation in each series, but in general values of correlation lower than -0.3
tend to be statistically significant at P < 0.05.
Although there is a non-linear relationship between correlation between Rt and
isolation index and the serial interval used (see Nishiura et al. 2020), even lower values
of serial interval around 3.5 days results in a significant correlation of -0.60 for the
entire State, which does not qualitatively affect our conclusions.
Significant correlations between Rt and isolation index were found for only 7 out
of the 246 cities in the State. Actually, the overall pattern for the State can be attributed
mainly to the three cities with more than 250,000 people, Goiânia (the capital),
Aparecida de Goiânia and Anapolis (Fig. 3). Out of the 15 cities with more than 90,000
people, correlation was observed for 7 of them, mostly situated in the central part of the
State. These 7 cities with significant correlations encompass ca. 43% of the State
population.

4. Discussion
There is a real interest to evaluate the local dynamics of disease transmission, as
this is the main parameter that drives the spread of COVID-19 in a region. Several
analyses have shown, as expected, that social distancing policies effectively reduce the
reproduction number (Rt) of disease spreading (Badr et al., 2020; Flaxman et al., 2020).
However, it is actually difficult to evaluate the true effects of such measures in a more
realistic fashion, as there may be several confounding and interactions between broadscale isolation related to mobility and more local and “behavioral” aspects at very local
and individual scale, including hygiene measures, mask use and social awareness as a
result of the pandemic (Chu et al., 2020; Kucharski et al., 2020), as well as a more
effective contact tracing and early detection of cases (Peto et al., 2020).
We identified for Goiás State a relatively high negative correlation of -0.685 at
log-scale) between the estimated Rt and isolation indicator obtained from mobile phone
data. Correlation for Rt based on death incidence curve are slightly slower, for a larger
time lag, which is expected because of the relatively smaller number of cases, as well as
due to a more complex series of events from transmission to death (including a strong
effect of age-structure in hospitalization in intensive care facilities). For transmissions,

anyway, our empirical results match those reported for São Paulo State, where the Rt
decreases from about 2 to 1 after strict social distancing interventions were implemented
in mid-March 2020. Similar findings were also reported for broad-scale analysis of
other countries (Badr et al., 2020; Kupferschmidt, 2020). However, our results show
that this high correlation between Rt and isolation indicator suggests a more continuous
relationship between these variables, as recently calculated for United States (Badr et
al., 2020), rather than a more discrete variation of extremes (i.e, if isolation increases to
50% the Rt decreases to 1.0, as shown for São Paulo state (Ganem et al., 2020), France
(Roques et al., 2020), and Europe in general (Flaxman et al., 2020), and used for initial
modeling in Brazil (Mellan et al., 2020).
Even more interestingly, the negative correlation between isolation and Rt
appears only if a time-lag is created, which is indeed expected considering current
knowledge of COVID-19 disease and in particularly its incubation time. This
correlation may seem clear to our case in Goiás, perhaps due to the variability of time
series, with an initial increase in the isolation indicators shortly after the start disease
transmission locally, followed by a more continuous reduction in the isolation indicator,
and finally by a stabilization at around 38% in late May. Even so, it is also important to
note that this correlation between Rt and isolation indicator must be better detected in
early phases of the COVID-19 expansion, and it will tend to disappear as the epidemic
size increases and the peak of transmissions occurs because Rt will be also more
strongly affected by the reduction of number of susceptible individuals in the
population.
Another important issue to be discussed is the spatial patterns in the correlation
between Rt and isolation, which seems to be associated to population size in cities, as
expected by its association with increase in number of cases (i.e., Coelho et al. 2020;
Berg et al. 2020). Out of the 15 cities, correlations between Rt and isolation index was
observed for 7 of them, all with almost 100,000 people. Of the four largest cities in the
State, only for the fourth one (Rio Verde, with about 230,000 people) there is no
correlation between Rt and isolation index. Actually, this is an interesting case as this
city was one of the first cities in Goiás to confirm a case (just after the capital) so we are
aware that strong control measures were declared since the beginning of the pandemics.
Now the cities is actually the third one in the State in terms of number of death and a
huge number of confirmed cases, but this was due to a late superspreading event in

large meat processing plants, in late June. It is interesting to note that a significant
correlation is observed in the neighbor city, Jatai.
The other important spatial component of diffusion in Goias state is related to
the proximity with the Federal District (DF), which encompass the capital of the
country, Brasilia (the retancgle inside the central-eastern portion of the State), with
almost 4 million people. Thus, although political and administration measure in respect
to COVID-19 were independent of in DF, it is not possible to neglect its effect of the
neighbouring regions, which also concentrates another large part of the population in
Goias state. Since the beginning of the pandemics, these cities surrounding the DF
tended to adopt epidemiological control of borders that reduced their effect and slowed
down the growing of the infection, especially the largest ones (i.e., Formosa, on the
eastern side of DF in Fig. 3). Even so, again half the cities with more than 100,000
people surrounding the DF showed significant correlations between Rt and isolation
index.
So, the cases of Rio Verde and Formosa seems to be informative in the sense
that strong local controls, at least in early phases of the pandemics, tend to buffer the
broad-scale correlation between population mobility and number of transmission and
further events. Although epidemics started in all these cities early, in some of them
contact tracing and border control seems to be more effective to minimize early growth
of number of cases.
In conclusion, about 50% of the variation in the mean number of transmissions
expressed by Rt in the Goiás state is explained by broad-scale isolation indicator
measured by mobile phones. Although there is a relatively large amount of unexplained
variation, we do not have additional variables related to more local measures that could
improve our understanding of disease transmission. Considering the amount of variation
explained and the randomness of the residuals of the relationship between isolation and
Rt, we understand that isolation indicators obtained from mobile phones can be a good
surrogate for COVID-19 transmission in a given population, and can be used for
modeling purposes as well as routine epidemiological analyses. More importantly, it
and can be quite useful for real-time public health policies, anticipating the need for
early interventions, an important and critical issues in public health.

Figure Captions
Figure 1. Times series of Isolation index (InLoco) (A) and mean reproduction number
(Rt) though time in Goiás State (B) between March – June 2020, with respective 95%
confidence intervals.
Figure 2. Negative relationship between Reproduction number Rt and isolation index
measured by InLoco, Goiás State, between March and late May. The correlation is equal
to 0.696 at original scale and, due to a slightly non-linearity, it increases to 0.721 after
log-transforming both axis).
Figure 2. Goiás State in Central Brasil, showing the main municipalities (cities are
capitals) with more than 90,000 people (gray areas) and those with significant
correlations between isolation index and Rt. The numbers refers to each cities, with the
estimated correlations shown in the table at lower left.
