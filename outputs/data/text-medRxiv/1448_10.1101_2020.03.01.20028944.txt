Abstract
At the end of 2019, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbroke in

13

Wuhan, China, and spread to Guizhou province on January of 2020. To acquire the

14

epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 in Guizhou, China, we collected data on

15

162 laboratory-confirmed cases related to COVID-19. We described the demographic

16

characteristics of the cases and estimated the incubation period, serial interval and

17

basic reproduction number. With an estimation of 8 days incubation period and 6 days

18

serial interval, our results indicate that there may exist infectiousness during the

19

incubation period for 2019-nCoV. This increases the difficulty of screening or

20

identifying cases related to COVID-19.

23

At the end of 2019, a Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia (NCIP) outbroke

24

in Wuhan, China. This coronavirus was named as 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-

25

nCoV), and then renamed this disease caused by the virus strain from 2019-nCoV

26

acute respiratory disease to "coronavirus disease 2019" (COVID-19) by World Health

27

Organization (WHO) officially0. This incident caused a public health issue within

28

China immediately, and spread to several countries over the world2–5.

29

Guizhou province is in Southwest of China, close (~1,000 km) to Wuhan. With

30

the increasing number of COVID-19 patients in mainland China, Guizhou detected its

31

first confirmed case on January 21, and was officially confirmed by Chinese Center

32

for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) on January 23. Before the

33

confirmation of the first case, Guizhou CDC identified and screened suspected

34

COVID-19 cases by “pneumonia of unknown etiology” surveillance mechanism6.

35

After the confirmation, Guizhou CDC started to identify and screen every case with

36

pneumonia.

37

Until February 16, over 140 laboratory-confirmed cases were officially

38

reported by Guizhou Health Committee7. In this study, we analyzed the data on the

39

laboratory-confirmed cases in Guizhou to demonstrate the epidemiologic

40

characteristics of COVID-19.

41

Methods

42

Case Definitions

43

According to standard clinical guidelines, suspected case of COVID-19 was

44

defined as the combination of clinical characteristics and epidemiologic histories.

45

Clinical characteristics of suspected case must fit at least 2 of 3 following criteria:

46

“fever and/or symptoms in respiratory system; radiographic evidence of pneumonia;

47

low or normal white-cell count or low lymphocyte count.” 8 Epidemiologic histories

48

must fit at least 1 of 4 following criteria: “A history of traveling Hubei Province or

49

other districts that has confirmed cases reported within 14 days of symptom onset; A

50

history of contacting with patient who has fever or symptoms in respiratory system

51

from Hubei Province or other districts that has confirmed cases reported within 14

52

days of symptom onset; Any person who has had a close contact with confirmed

53

cases; cluster cases.”8 With a stricter definition, Guizhou Health Committee counted

54

all cases that fit clinical characteristics criteria but not any criteria of epidemiologic

55

histories described above as suspected cases. A confirmed case was defined as a case

56

with respiratory specimens that tested positive for the 2019-nCoV by at least one of

57

the following two methods: positive result by real-time reverse-transcription–

58

polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for 2019-nCoV or a genetic sequence that

59

matches 2019-nCoV. Asymptomatic carrier (i.e. case that displays no signs or

60

symptoms to 2019-nCoV) was not announced by Health Committee officially, but

61

was included in this study.

62

Sources of Data

63

Suspected case was screened by local hospital or local Center for Disease

64

Control and Prevention (CDC). Once the patient was identified as confirmed case by

65

laboratory, a joint field epidemiology team comprising members from Guizhou CDC

66

and local CDC would open a detailed field investigation on demography information,

67

epidemiologic histories, timelines of key events, and close contacts.

68
69

All data from epidemiological reports were inputted into standardized forms
from technical protocols designed by China CDC. At least two team members

70

independently review the full report of each case report to ensure that data is correctly

71

input.

72

Epidemiological investigation
Once a case was evaluated as suspected case, local CDC would finish an

73
74

initial investigation report in 24 hours and collect respiratory specimens for

75

centralized laboratory testing. When case was confirmed as positive to 2019-nCoV,

76

province CDC would send a special epidemiology team to investigate with local

77

CDC, in order to acquire more detailed information. Information was collected from

78

infected individuals, family members, medical workers, close contacts, GPS-info, and

79

CCTV camera, etc. Information included basic demography data, detailed life trace

80

and all close contacts, clinical characteristics, exposure history, etc.

81

Laboratory confirmation
With the guidelines of protocol by World Health Organization (WHO) 9,

82
83

specimens of suspected cases were taken from whose upper and lower respiratory

84

tract by professional medical worker from CDC or hospital. RNA was extracted and

85

tested by RT-PCR with primers and probes for 2019-nCoV. Cross-reactivity with other

86

known respiratory viruses and bacteria such as Influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, or

87

H7N9), Influenza B (Victoria or Yamagata), MERS-CoV, Adenovirus, etc. are also be

88

tested.

89

Statistical analysis

90

The onset date was defined as the self-reported first date to have symptoms

91

related to 2019-nCoV or the date of visiting to clinical facilities if it was unavailable

92

to acquire the accurate onset date, and as the confirmation date for confirmed cases

93

without symptoms. As the date of infecting exposure for a given individual falls

94

within a finite interval, an exposure window was clarified to denote this interval.

95

Criteria of infecting exposure was described above in the Case Definitions section.

96

Continuous variables were expressed as the means and standard deviations or

97

medians, the interquartile range (IQR) equals the difference between 75th and 25th

98

percentiles. Categorical variables were summarized as the counts and percentages in

99

each category. The incubation period is defined as the delay from viral infection to the

100

onset of illness10, which was estimated by fitting a parametric accelerated failure time

101

model with log-normal distribution of cases with detailed exposure window data, and

102

standard errors of parameters was computed using a 1,000 times bootstrap routine,

103

this was performed by R package coarseDataTools11. The serial interval distribution

104

(i.e. the duration between symptom onset of a primary/index case and symptom onset

105

of its secondary cases) was fitted by a Weibull distribution with data from cluster

106

events. The basic reproduction number (R0) was defined as the expected number of

107

cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are

108

susceptible to infection, it was estimated by maximum likelihood estimation via R

109

package R012.

110

All analyses and statistical graphs were conducted with R software version

111

3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

Ethics approval

113

Data collection and analysis of cases and their close contacts were determined

114

by Guizhou Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China. It is part of a

115

continuing public health outbreak investigation and exempted from institutional

Results
There were 759 cases in total. Among all patients, 144 (18.97%) cases were

119

confirmed cases with symptoms to 2019-nCOV, 18 (2.37% of all 759 cases, 11.11%

120

of all 162 confirmed cases) cases were confirmed as cases without symptoms, 597

121

(78.65%) cases were diagnosed as other diseases after clinical diagnosing or

122

laboratory testing, 34 (4.47%) cases were suspected cases that were pending for

123

laboratory testing. Figure 1 shows the geographic distribution of confirmed cases

124

throughout China and Guizhou. The median age of all confirmed cases was 37 years

125

(ranges from 1 month to 89 years), 82 (50.62%) confirmed cases were male, 84

126

(51.85%) confirmed cases were exposed to Wuhan or other districts outside Guizhou,

127

the detailed demographic data are shown in Table 1.

128

The first case was detected on January 21 and was officially confirmed by

129

China CDC on January 23. It was reported by Guiyang (capital city of Guizhou)

130

CDC. This case was a 51-year-old male, infected in Wuhan where he was there to do

131

some business affairs. His onset date was on January 9 when he was still in Wuhan.

132

After returning to Guizhou on January 14, he visited a local hospital for several times

133

until January 16 when he was isolated by the Division of Infection. Figure 2 shows

134

the distribution of the onset date of all cases related to 2019-nCoV over time. It is

135

notable that there was a decline of cases after February 7th, which is most likely

136

attributed to the delay of reporting by the local hospital and laboratory confirmation.

137

We included 93 confirmed cases with detailed exposure window and onset

138

date information to estimate the incubation period (Fig. 3 A-B). The median

139

incubation period was 8.06 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.89 – 9.36). The

140

95% percentile was 21.90 days (95% CI: 18.21 – 25.45). Other percentiles are shown

on Table 2. We obtained 57 observations from cluster cases and estimated the serial

142

interval distribution (Fig. 3C) with the mean (±SD) of 6.37±4.15 days. The estimated

143

basic reproduction number (R0) was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.94 – 1.26).

144

Discussions

145

This study provides an initial analysis among epidemiologic characteristics

146

and two typical transmission phenomena of COVID-19. Most index cases were

147

exposed to Wuhan or confirmed cases related to Wuhan, but it is also necessary to

148

prevent the community transmission of COVID-19. Measures such as community

149

screening, isolation of close contacts, public transportation limitation, extended

150

population of PCR testing, enhanced disinfection, and health education etc. could be

151

taken. Our findings provide more epidemiologic data to this incident of COVID-19,

152

which contribute to the further analysis and the control of this disease.

153

In addition to the evidence of the human-to-human transmission, it is likely

154

that there exists infectiousness to some extend during the incubation period, and the

155

presence of “super-spreaders”. The median incubation period was 8.2 days (95% CI:

156

7.9 – 9.5) in our study, which is longer than a recent report of 425 patients (8.2 days

157

vs. 5.2 days), this may be a results of recall bias, during epidemiological investigation,

158

we found that some cases actually have had shown mild symptoms days before the

159

date they reported so as to their ignorance. We estimated the R0 as 1.09 (95% CI: 1.9

160

– 1.2), which means each patient can infect other 1.09 people on average. In

161

commonly used infection models, when R0 > 1 the infection will be able to start

162

spreading in a population, but not if R0 < 1.

163
164

However, it should be treated with caution that the basic reproduction number
R0 was calculated under the assumptions that an infected individual but has no

165

symptoms does not yet infect others, which assumes that all index cases should show

166

symptoms before their secondary cases. However, as the investigation went on,

167

Guizhou CDC found that there existed index cases who showed symptoms after that

168

of their secondary cases. This may lead to that the estimated R0 was not robust as we

169

do not hold enough evidence and information to the presence of asymptomatic carrier,

170

those data were not included in the estimation model.

171

There are several limitations in our study. First, we could not collect all

172

complete exposure and onset data from all confirmed cases, due to the recall bias and

173

the lack of standardization on epidemiological investigation at the beginning of the

174

incident. Second, some key data from asymptomatic carrier, especially the onset date

175

or onset window, and left bound of exposure window from cases of Wuhan residents

176

were unavailable, other statistical model may be used to fit such kind of censored data

177

to estimate serial interval and R0 more accurately.
