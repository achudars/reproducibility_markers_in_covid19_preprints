Abstract

Background: The COVID-19 epidemic has taken a fearsome toll on individuals residing
in long-term care facilities (LTC). As of April 10, 2020 half of Canada’s COVID-19
deaths had occurred in LTC. We sought to better understand trends and risk factors for
COVID-19 death in LTC in Ontario.

Methods: We analyzed a COVID-19 outbreak database created by the Ontario Ministry
of Health, for the period March 29-April 7, 2020. Mortality incidence rate ratios for LTC
were calculated with community living Ontarians aged > 69 used as the comparator
group. Count-based regression methods were used to model temporal trends and
identify associations between infection risk in staff and residents, and subsequent LTC
resident death.

Results: Confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 were identified in 272/627 LTC by
April 7, 2020. The incidence rate ratio for COVID-19 death was 13.1 (9.9-17.3) relative to
community living adults over 69. Incidence rate ratio increased over time and was
87.28 (90% CrI 9.98 to 557.08) by April 7, 2020. Lagged infection in staff was a strong
predictor of death in residents (e.g., adjusted IRR for death per infected staff member
1.17, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.26 at a 6-day lag).

Interpretation: Mortality risk in elders in Ontario is currently concentrated in LTC, and
this risk has increased sharply over a short period of time. Early identification of risk
requires a focus on testing and provision of personal protective equipment to staff, and
restructuring the LTC workforce to prevent movement of COVID-19 between LTC.

Funding: The research was supported by a grant to DNF from the Canadian Institutes
for Health Research (2019 COVID-19 rapid researching funding OV4-170360).

Introduction

Communicable diseases do not respect boundaries. But they also do not affect all
members of our society equally. Since its initial recognition in January 2020, it has been
starkly apparent that SARS-CoV-2 disproportionately harms the most vulnerable in our
population. Mortality due to COVID-19 is highest in the elderly and those with
underlying medical conditions (1). In Canada, we had an early indication of the
particular vulnerability of those living in long-term care (LTC). The first confirmed
death in the country occurred on March 9th 2020 in a resident of a North Vancouver care
home (2).

Since then, outbreaks in LTC have been identified across the country. As of April 9 2020
nearly 50% (198/401) of all COVID-19 attributable deaths in the country have occurred
in residents of LTC (3). In addition to the age and comorbidity profiles of residents,
other factors make LTC especially susceptible to infectious disease outbreaks, including
outbreaks of COVID-19 infection (4). These include: a lack of access to testing and
personal protective equipment, the close quarters of residents, the difficulty of
maintaining physical distancing among mobile patients with dementia, and a
precariously employed workforce that can transmit the virus across LTC sites (5-7).

Recognizing and quantifying the scope of the issue and identifying which resident and
worker factors may contribute to sudden increases in deaths is an important first step

for ensuring that comprehensive policies and response measures are in place to protect
residents and the health care workers who provide essential services to these residents.
We sought to evaluate the risk of death among residents of LTC and identify risk factors
associated with mortality, using data from the province of Ontario.

Methods

Data for this study were obtained from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term
care as part of the province’s emergency “modeling table”. This included the following:
(i) age and date of death of COVID-19-positive Ontario residents and (ii) cumulative
death and COVID-19 positive case counts by date among LTC residents and staff. The
available time series for LTC covered the 10-day period between March 29 and April 7,
2020, inclusive, however deaths prior to March 29 were included as part of the
cumulative counts. The provincial death data included the time period from March 3 to
April 11, 2020. Daily deaths and cases were estimated by taking the difference of
cumulative cases and deaths on sequential days.

Population denominators for non-LTC deaths were derived from Statistics Canada
estimates for the appropriate age group. Population denominators were not available
for LTC facilities and were approximated as the total number of facility beds in Ontario
(79,498) assuming complete occupancy. Age data for deaths reported in LTC were not
available, but data show that approximately 93% of residents in LTC are aged 65 or

older (8). In our main analysis, we estimated incidence rate ratios for COVID-19 deaths
in the LTC resident population, compared to deaths in Ontario population aged over 70
years. In sensitivity analyses we compared outcomes in LTC residents to COVID-19
deaths in the entire Ontario population, the population aged >59 years, or >79 years.
Cumulative deaths at the end of the respective time series were considered, with risk in
both LTC residents and non-LTC residents considered to have begun on March 3, 2020.
However, person-time denominators were adjusted for the fact that the LTC database
ended 4 days before the provincial death database (i.e., 36 days in the LTC population
and 40 days in the general Ontario population).

We also created a negative binomial regression model to evaluate the change in
incidence rate ratio in LTC residents, as compared to the non-LTC population, during
the period from March 29-April 7, 2020. Negative binomial regression was performed
as a deviance statistic test suggested the data were not Poisson-distributed. Non-LTC
residents aged > 69 were used as the comparator population, and model offsets were
the population denominators described above. The model included three covariates:
LTC residence, time (centered around April 3, 2020) and an interaction term of LTC
residence (yes/no) multiplied by time. Model predictions were generated both
forwards and backwards to generate graphical representations of how risk in the LTC
population has changed over time.

Lastly, we created Poisson regression models that evaluated risk of death within LTC
facilities as a function of the number of laboratory-confirmed, infected residents and
confirmed infected staff at lags from 0-7 days, adjusting for date. As our model could
not accommodate multiple simultaneous lags, we constructed 8 models, each of which
included cumulative resident and staff infection as at identical lags (0 to 7 days.
Deviance statistics indicated that counts were Poisson-distributed. LTC beds were used
as model offsets. and confidence intervals were adjusted for clustering by LTC facility.

The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the University of Toronto.

Results

A total of 627 LTC were included in the provincial dataset; of these 272 (43.4%) were
identified as having either confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection in residents or
staff. No significant differences between LTC with and without confirmed COVID-19
infections were seen in number of licensed bed size, operator (e.g., for-profit vs. not-forprofit), or geographic location in Ontario (Table 1).

The incidence of death due to COVID-19 was 13-fold higher in the LTC population than
in Ontario residents aged > 69 years. When the whole population was used as the
referent, the IRR for death was > 90 in this population; incidence was 23-fold higher
when compared to those aged > 59 years, and 8-fold higher when compared to those
those aged 80 and over not resident in LTC (Table 2).

We identified significant interaction between time and risk associated with LTC
residence (Figure 1). While risk of death in those not resident in LTC declined nonsignificantly over time, the rate ratio for death in LTC residents rose sharply, from 8.03
(90% CI 2.73 to 20.42) on March 29 to 87.28 (90% CI 9.98 to 557.08) by April 7, 2020.

In analyses focussed risk for death within LTC (Table 2, Figure 2) we found that lagged
infections in institution staff were the strongest predictors of death in residents (Figure
2) and were significant at all lags (0 to 7 days) after adjustment for date and numbers of

infected residents. The strongest effects were seen with infected staff at a 2 day lag
(relative increase in death per infected staff member 20%, 95% CI 14-26%) and a 6 day
lag (17%, 95% CI 11%-26%). By contrast the association between infection in residents
and subsequent resident death was variable, and far weaker than the effect seen for
staff, and was statistically significant only at a zero-day lag (increased risk per infected
resident 8%, 95% CI 1% to 15%).

Discussion

In this analysis we document the rapid spread of COVID-19 through Ontario’s LTC
system, with a marked increase in risk of death among frail older residents in a brief
period from late March to early April 2020. Issues such as crowding, use of communal
space, low staffing ratios, and high care needs (with resultant high density of physical
contact between residents and staff) have long been recognized as key drivers of
vulnerability to outbreaks in the LTC setting (4, 7). In the context of COVID-19 this
vulnerability has proven particularly deadly, with (as we demonstrate here), an
incidence of mortality more than 13 times higher than that seen in community living
elders over age 69 during a similar period, with relative risk of death rising sharply
over time.

We find also that documented infection in facility staff, as opposed to residents, is a
strong identifiable risk factor for mortality in residents, with temporality suggesting
that residents are infected by staff, and not vice versa. Although it might be argued that
the limited nature of testing, and a tendency to test staff and residents for COVID-19
after a resident dies might lead to spurious associations between identified infections
and deaths, the temporality of association and differential strength of effect in staff and
residents suggests that this effect may be causal. The greater mobility and
connectedness of staff in the LTC setting, as opposed to residents, lends biological
plausibility to this effect (9).

Transmission of infection is not the only mechanism whereby infection in staff could
result in increased mortality in a vulnerable older population. Fear of COVID-19 may
result in absenteeism by staff, which could itself lead to death through dehydration and
other mechanisms in a high-needs population, which would be consistent with the
lagged effects we demonstrate here. Such tragedies have been documented in Canada
recently (10).

The prevention of such deaths requires strategic guidance from health regions and the
provision of sufficient testing and personal protective equipment. Provision of personal
protective equipment has benefits both in bidirectional prevention of SARS-CoV-2
transmission, and in providing workers peace of mind, in order to stay on the job.
Expanded testing, including testing of minimally symptomatic infection, will facilitate
early identification of infection, and implementation of effective infection control
strategies. Also needed are integrated regional approaches to LTC human resource
management, such as limiting workers to a single facility and ensuring that these
workers earn a living wage to prevent the need for multiple jobs while at the same time
maintaining adequate staffing levels (11).

Like any observational study, this study has limitations, including possible
incompleteness of data collected rapidly during an outbreak, inconsistency in testing
across Ontario, and absence of individual-level data on LTC infections and deaths. We

regard our outcome of interest, death in LTC from COVID-19 to be less likely
misclassified than non-fatal infection in staff and residents. If misclassification of
infection status in these individuals occurs at random, that would likely mean the
effects reported here are lower bound effects. If under-identification of both fatal
infections and infections in residents and staff are clustered by home, that would result
in effects that are biased upwards. The temporality in the effects we observe provides a
degree of reassurance in this regard.

Conclusions

In summary, we document that the rapid movement of COVID-19 through Ontario’s
LTC system has resulted in a marked surge in mortality in that population, as
compared to community-living elders. We find evidence that links mortality to
infection in LTC staff, highlighting the urgent need for improved infection control,
more widespread testing, access to personal protective equipment, and economic
protections and support for those who do this important work.
