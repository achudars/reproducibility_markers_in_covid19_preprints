Abstract
Emerging evidence suggests that contact tracing has had limited success in
the UK in reducing the R number across the COVID-19 pandemic. We
investigate potential pitfalls and areas for improvement by extending an existing branching process contact tracing model, adding diagnostic testing
and refining parameter estimates. Our results demonstrate that reporting
and adherence are the most important predictors of programme impact but
tracing coverage and speed plus diagnostic sensitivity also play an important
role. We conclude that well-implemented contact tracing could bring small
but potentially important benefits to controlling and preventing outbreaks,
providing up to a 15% reduction in R, and reaffirm that contact tracing is
not currently appropriate as the sole control measure.

Main
In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus strain, was detected in
Hubei Province, China [1]. By 31 January 2020 the first UK cases of COVID19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, were confirmed [2]. Initial modelling
studies indicated that fast and effective contact tracing could contain the UK
outbreak in most settings [3, 4]. However, by 20 March there were almost
4,000 confirmed cases nationwide [5], at which point the UK Government
scaled up physical distancing measures, including the closure of schools and
social venues, extending to heightened restrictions on non-essential travel,
outdoor activities and between-household social mixing [6]. Similar patterns
occurred in other countries [7, 8].
Throughout the pandemic, it has become obvious that the UK’s NHS Test
and Trace programme has not been as effective at reducing transmission as
originally hoped, with a recent financial report even suggesting it has made no
“measurable difference” to the course of the pandemic [9]. Results from the
Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) are more flattering, but still
only conclude that contact tracing efforts reduced the R number by 2–5% in
October 2020 [10]. Speed of testing and tracing, poor integration with local
authorities and adherence to isolation have all been cited as possible reasons.
The head of NHS Test and Trace revealed in February 2021 that around
20,000 people a day had ignored isolation rules, despite being contacted by
them [11]. This number is based on 80% adherence to isolation, which is
optimistic compared to estimates from other surveys [12, 13, 14], and hence
may be a substantial underestimate.
The UK’s Test and Trace strategy has been continually updated throughout the pandemic, but with minimal, if any, observed improvement in results.
A few elements have remained consistent throughout, such as traced contacts
only being allowed to access tests once symptomatic and requiring a positive test result before tracing an isolated individual’s contacts [15]. Current
methods are reliant on PCR testing, but there is growing discussion around
potential use of rapid lateral flow tests [16], which are considered to be substantially less sensitive [17].
Imperfect adherence to isolation and reporting and the innate difficulties
in identifying contacts will pose challenges for contact tracing, particularly
in crowded urban settings [18]. Therefore, evaluating both the limitations of
contact tracing and how to maximise its effectiveness could be crucial in preventing an exponential rise in cases, which might see contact tracing capacity

rapidly exceeded and stricter physical distancing measures required [19].
Extending Hellewell et al.’s [3] UK-focused contact tracing study with
new insights could inform contact tracing strategy. Their key conclusion was
that highly effective contact tracing would be sufficient to control an initial
outbreak of COVID-19 in the UK, however subsequent evidence supports
much higher pre- and asymptomatic transmission rates than had initially
been considered. In particular, the original analysis only considered scenarios with 0–10% of cases as asymptomatic and 0-30% of transmission from
symptomatic individuals occurring pre-symptoms, compared to more recent
estimates of 31–42.5% [20, 21, 22] and 44% [23] respectively. The focus on
speed in the UK contact tracing programme also requires a detailed assessment of the associated trade-offs through mechanistic modelling of the testing
process. Up-to-date modelling studies are therefore needed to investigate the
feasibility of contact tracing and the conditions under which it is effective.
We use improved incubation period and serial interval estimates [24, 23,
25], consider imperfect self-reporting, adherence and tracing rates and simulate the use of diagnostic tests. We explore trade-offs between testing speed
and sensitivity, and investigate the limitations of contact tracing and in which
scenarios it is likely to be most effective.

We used data from a UK-based survey to consider three adherence scenarios
[12]: a scenario with low self-reporting and poor adherence to isolation (representative of the proportion of individuals who reported being fully adherent
to advice from Test and Trace); a scenario with good reporting and adherence (representing those intending to be adherent to advice); and a scenario
with good reporting and boosted adherence (where additional incentives to
adhere to isolation are introduced).
Self-reporting and adherence can have a moderate-to-substantial impact
on the efficacy of Test and Trace (Figure 1). In the poor reporting & adherence scenario, there is no observable benefit of scaling up the coverage of

contact tracing, or speeding up tracing. Increasing adherence and reporting
to intended compliance levels shows a clear benefit to increasing contact tracing, with reductions in the outbreak risk and effective reproduction number
R (dependent on the proportion of contacts traced and the magnitude of
delays in testing and/or tracing) (Figures 1 & 2).
However, even when Test and Trace is able to identify and trace 80% of
contacts and compliance is good (good self-reporting, and adherence good or
better), the associated reduction in R is only 6–13%. If coverage is lower at
around 40% of contacts, the reduction is 6% or below. This highlights the
need for Test and Trace to be used as a supplemental measure, not as the
sole control strategy.

Assuming good compliance to Test and Test, we can investigate the comparative impact of a highly sensitive (95%) or poorly sensitive (65%) test
(Figure 3). There is a clear benefit to having a test with high sensitivity, and
the relative benefit increases with contact tracing coverage.
Although there is an observable benefit to increasing the speed of testing
and tracing, a two-day decrease in time to trace and obtain a test result, representing the use of a rapid test, appears insufficient to make up for switching
from a 95% sensitive to a 65% sensitive test. However, the difference in probability of a large outbreak between instant testing with a 65% sensitive test
and a two-day delay with a 95% sensitive test is relatively small. Hence
conclusions around preferred test usage are likely to be sensitive to small
changes in testing delay or sensitivity.

By considering the total number of observed and unobserved cases in an
outbreak so far (Figure 4) we can evaluate the probability of a large outbreak
for a range of scenarios. It is hence possible to set thresholds for contact
tracing feasibility. For example, consider a scenario with average reporting
& adherence where 80% of contacts could be successfully traced. Then if the
desired outcome was keeping the probability of a large outbreak below 50%,
increasing testing and tracing speed from 2 days to instantaneous would raise
the threshold number of cases from 166 to 357—an increase of 115%.
Improving contact tracing coverage has a visible effect in all scenarios

presented, aside from those with poor reporting and adherence (left column).
In scenarios with average or boosted adherence for a fixed number of total
cases so far, speeding up tracing reduces the probability of a large outbreak
and increases the relative benefit of higher contact tracing coverage.

Our results provide insights into why contact tracing implementation has not
been as effective in reducing transmission as initially hoped in the UK. We
conclude that the largest likely factor is adherence to the various stages of
contact tracing and isolation, which is believed to be relatively poor [12].
However, if reasonable reporting and adherence can be achieved, then contact tracing efficacy could be improved by increasing speed of test and tracing
or increasing the proportion of contacts traced in the majority of scenarios
considered. There are substantial behavioural challenges around improving
adherence, requiring consideration of why individuals do not, or cannot, adhere to guidance. Isolation of traced contacts and positive-testing individuals
is already legally required in England, so interventions would need to be targeted around messaging, logistical support and financial incentives. Even
if good reporting and adherence, fast testing and tracing and identifying a
high proportion of contacts can be achieved, our results demonstrate that the
potential reduction in R is only around 10–15%. This confirms the emerging
conclusion in the field that the UK contact tracing programme, in its current form, is ill-suited as the sole control strategy. However, more targeted
investigative contact tracing could still be beneficial for identification and
monitoring of new virus strains.
At this stage of the pandemic, there are more diagnostic tools available
than in the initial months. In particular, use of rapid lateral flow device
(LFD) tests is growing due to increased speed and reduced costs compared
to PCR alternatives. However, our results suggest that test sensitivity is still
important, with contact tracing using a 95% sensitive test that takes two
additional days performing better than an instantaneous 65% sensitive test.
This effect is seen in the presence of an assumption that negatively-testing
individuals are not immediately released from isolation guidance but if this
was not the case we would expect to see an even more marked reduction
in contact tracing efficacy when considering the faster lower-sensitivity test.
It is therefore vital to carefully consider the implications of changes in the
testing methods employed in contact tracing.

Our model assumes constant test sensitivity across an individual’s infected period, whereas a previous study shows that testing too early or late
after exposure can dramatically increase false negative rates [26]. While
assuming a fixed incubation period of 5 days, we have ignored temporal variation. Additionally, high between-person variance has been observed in the
natural history of infection [23]. It is therefore unclear what drives these
temporal changes in sensitivity or whether this temporal profile makes sense
on an individual basis. These simplifying assumptions mean we may be
over-estimating operational test sensitivity in some cases, leading to more
optimistic results around the impact of contact tracing. This reinforces the
conclusion that contact tracing is not currently appropriate as the sole control
measure.
We also assume the Negative Binomial dispersion, k = 0·23 [27], of secondary cases, does not vary with RS due to different social distancing measures. This relationship is poorly characterised, but it is believed that social
distancing may increase k, leading to decreased heterogeneity in number of
contacts across the majority of the population due to an overall reduction
in mean contacts, paradoxically making outbreak control harder, although
this effect is expected to be cancelled out by the reduction in the mean [28].
Furthermore it is also possible that less heterogeneity in contacts may make
tracing of individual contacts more feasible, allowing for a higher coverage.
The vaccine roll-out is currently in progress in the UK, with over 50%
now believed to have COVID-19 antibodies through either vaccination or
prior infection [29]. This will have the effect of reducing R and, eventually,
when antibodies are sufficiently high, contact tracing may become viable as
the sole control measure for keeping R below 1.
Contact tracing improvements could include secondary contact tracing as
seen in Vietnam, i.e. tracing the ‘contacts of contacts’ of known cases, to get
ahead of the chain of transmission [30]. Backwards contact tracing, whilst
highly labour intensive, could also fill vital gaps where transmission links have
been missed by focusing on tracing back from known cases to identify parent
cases and potential super-spreaders [31]. As experience in contact tracing
develops, it may be possible to give contacts a prior probability of infection
(e.g. based on the contact duration and setting) and combine this with test
results to improve existing isolation protocol. Testing of asymptomatic contacts would also allow tracing of currently hidden chains of infection, further
reducing transmission.
Overall, we conclude that well-implemented contact tracing could bring

small but potentially important benefits to controlling and preventing outbreaks, providing up to a 15% reduction in R. Reporting and adherence are
the most important predictors of programme impact but tracing coverage
and speed also play an important role, as well as diagnostic sensitivity. In
line with a previous study [8], we have demonstrated that contact tracing
alone is highly unlikely to prevent large outbreaks unless used in combination with evidence-based physical distancing measures, including restrictions
on large gatherings.

In this extension of a previous COVID-19 branching process model [3], the
number of potential secondary cases generated by a primary case is drawn
from a Negative Binomial distribution. The exposure time for each case,
relative to infector onset, is drawn from a shifted Gamma distribution that
allows for pre-symptomatic transmission and is left-truncated to ensure secondary case exposure time is after the primary case exposure time. Secondary
cases are averted if the primary case is ‘quarantined’ at the time of infection, assuming within household segregation is possible. The probability of
quarantine depends on whether the primary case was traced, and adherence
to self-isolation recommendations, irrespective of the test result (Figure 5).
Each simulation was seeded with five index cases that are initially undetected
by the contact tracing system.

A Negative Binomial distribution represented heterogeneity in onward transmission due to factors such as individual contact patterns or infectiousness,
with the mean relating to the effective reproduction number under physical distancing RS (taking values 1·1, 1·3 or 1·5) with a constant dispersion
parameter k = 0·23, taken from a study that used genome sequencing to
investigate the clustering of secondary cases [27]. This also represents a midvalue among estimates, which vary widely from 0·1 (range: 0·05–0·2) [31] to
0·7 (range: 0·59–0·98) [32]. Here a smaller k represents greater heterogeneity in transmission and results in the majority of index cases leading to no
secondary infections, while a small proportion of individuals infect a large
number of secondary cases. All parameter estimates and references can be
found in Table 1.

Generation interval

242

The incubation period (time from exposure to symptoms) is assumed to follow a Lognormal distribution with mean 1·43 and standard deviation 0·66
on the log scale [24]. Each new case is then infected at an exposure time
drawn from a Gamma-distributed infectivity profile (shape = 17·77, rate =
1·39 day−1 , shift = −13·0 days) relative to their infector’s symptom onset.
If this time is before the infector’s exposure then this value is rejected and
re-sampled to prevent negative generation intervals. This Gamma distribution has been fitted under these sampling assumptions to serial interval data
published by He et al. [23] using the fitdistr package in R and our resulting
distributions qualitatively match those presented in the original paper (see
Figure S1 in Supplementary File for more details). The exposure time is then
compared to the isolation times of the infector and cases are averted if the
infector is in isolation when the infection event would have happened. For
non-averted cases, symptom onset times are then drawn from the Lognormal incubation period distribution and the probability of a case remaining
asymptomatic throughout their infected period is fixed at 31% [22].

New cases are identified either through tracing contacts (like persons B &
D in Figure 5) of known cases or symptomatic individuals self-reporting to
the system, which we model as a two-stage process. Firstly, if an individual
is symptomatic (i.e. has a fever and/or dry persistent cough) but untraced
we assume that a combination of reduced social activity due to illness, and
awareness of COVID-19 prevention measures, results in a probability, a1 of
self-isolation one day after symptom onset. Secondly, individuals who selfisolate in this way then have a probability, a2 , of contacting the tracing
programme and reporting their symptoms as a potential case (like person
A), which can be varied in the model.
Using data on UK adherence to the NHS Test and Trace programme from
the CORSAIR study [12], we characterised three levels of population compliance. Firstly, as a lower bound, we considered the proportion of individuals
who reported complete adherence to guidance: 18·2% reported adhering fully
to isolation following onset of symptoms; 11·9% of symptomatic individuals
self-reported their case to Test and Trace; and 10·9% of traced individuals
isolated for the recommended duration. These reported figures were sub-

stantially lower that the intentional adherence reported by individuals who
had not yet developed symptoms or been traced, which was taken as a ‘good’
compliance scenario: 70% individuals said they would isolate following symptoms; 40–50% would self-report following onset; and 65% would isolate for
the full duration if contacted by Test and Trace. We also considered a scenario with a boosted adherence to tracing of 90%.
Contact tracing is initiated where an existing case has been identified,
isolated and returned a positive test (person A). The time taken to get a
test result is either instant, 1 day or 2 days. The contacts of that individual
are then traced with 40%–100% coverage. If a contact is successfully traced
they will isolate with probability a3 . This continues until either the outbreak exceeds 2000 cases, or there are no further cases, resulting in disease
extinction.

In simulations that include testing, we assume constant test sensitivities of
65% or 95%. The lower value aims to represent tests with poorer sensitivity,
such as the rapid lateral flow tests that are seeing increased usage in 2021,
based on estimates in the literature of 50.1–79.2% sensitivity [33, 34]. The
higher value represents the PCR tests that are available, with an estimated
94.8% sensitivity [34, 35]. Due to the nature of the branching process model,
only infected individuals are modelled so the impact of test specificity cannot
be assessed under these methods, although the implications would be related
to programme feasibility rather than efficacy. Current specificity estimates
for both types of test are believed to be reasonably high in comparison [36,
37, 38, 33, 34], with some estimates of close to 100%, but false positive tests
could lead to unnecessary negative socioeconomic impact under any scheme
requiring quarantine of healthy individuals.
When testing is included in the model, all individuals that either selfreport to the contact tracing system (person A in Figure 5), or are traced
contacts (persons B & D), are tested. From the moment a contact selfreports or is identified through tracing, either a zero-, one- or two-day delay
is simulated before the test result is returned, chosen to be representative
of UK programme targets. If a positive test is returned, the individual’s
contacts are traced. If a negative test is returned, the individual is asked to
complete a precautionary quarantine period of 7 days from the beginning of
isolation.

Simulation process
Results presented are the combined output of 5,000 simulations for each parameter combination or scenario, and each simulation is run for a maximum
of 300 days. These results are used to derive the probability of a large outbreak given a range of conditions. A large outbreak is defined at 2,000 cases:
this threshold was chosen from experimental runs with a maximum of 5,000

Figure 5: Contact tracing schematic. Overview of the contact tracing
process implemented in our model. Person A isolates and self-reports to the
contact tracing programme with some delay after symptom onset, by which
time they have infected Persons B, C and D. When Person A self-reports they
isolated and are tested, a positive result initiates contact tracing. Person B
was infected by A prior to their symptom onset and is detected by tracing
after some delay. After isolating they are tested, with a false negative result.
This leads to B either a) stopping isolation immediately or b) finishing a
minimum 7 day isolation period. Both may allow new onward transmission.
Person C was infected by A but not traced as a contact. Person C does not
develop symptoms but is infectious, leading to missed transmission. Person
D is traced and tested. The test for D returns positive, meaning that D
remains isolated, halting this chain of transmission.
