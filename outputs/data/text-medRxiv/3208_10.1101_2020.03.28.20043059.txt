An acute viral pneumonia (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus HCoV-19,

24

was first identified during December 2019 in China(1). HCoV-19 was found to be

25

highly transmissible in humans(2) and is now a pandemic, with transmission into over

26

140 countries, causing over 150,000 infections and 6,000 deaths as of March 15, 2020

27

(3).

Diagnosis is critical for confirmation and treatment of COVID-19. Viral RNA

30

detection for the respiratory samples is currently the primary criteria for diagnosis of

31

COVID-19. Two studies on virus loads in clinical samples have been recently

32

reported, in which viral loads in nasal and throat swabs and sputum specimens peaked

33

at three to seven days after illness onset (d.a.o.) and virtually disappeared before 15

34

d.a.o.(4, 5). Another study showed that the median duration of virus shedding in throat

35

swabs was 20 d.a.o. in survivors and was detectable until death in non-survivors(6).

36

Additionally, live viruses have been isolated in the feces and urine samples of

37

COVID-19 patients. However, the viral dynamics in these two types of specimens

38

have not yet been elucidated, as well as comparative studies on virus shedding in the

39

upper respiratory, intestinal and urinary tracts.

From January 20 to February 23, 2020, a total of 23 patients were treated in a

42

designated hospital in Beijing (11 were imported, 12 were secondary cases; two

43

family clusters; 12 men, 11 women; median age was 48.0 years (IQR 40.0 to 62.0);

44

two with severe disease, the others were mild-to-moderate, all patients recovered

except for one due to an unrelated bacterial infection) (Table S1 in the Supplementary

46

appendix). Upper respiratory (nasal-throat mixed) swabs (n= 66), feces (n= 51), urine

47

(n= 56), and plasma (n= 56) samples were collected for viral RNA detection by

48

real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). The study was approved by the Ethics Committees of

49

Chinese Academy of Sciences (SQIMCAS20). Informed consent was obtained from

50

all subjects for being included in the study, and all patient data were anonymized

51

before study inclusion.

52
53

The plasma and urine samples were all negative, except for urine samples from two

54

severe cases at the latest available detection point (16 or 21 d.a.o). Conversely, virus

55

was shed in respiratory swabs and feces samples during the diseased period (Figure

56

1A). Ten of 12 cases (83.3%) were positive for feces samples, while 14 of 21 cases

57

(66.7%) were positive for respiratory samples. In addition, all samples from one

58

severe patient were negative until 21 d.a.o., when feces samples were positive. The

59

median duration of virus shedding was 10.0 days (IQR 8.0 to 17.0) in nasal-throat

60

mixed swabs, but was 22.0 days (IQR 15.5 to 23.5) for the feces (Figure 1 B). The

61

viral titers of nasal-throat swabs peaked at six to nine d.a.o. and at 14-18 d.a.o for

62

fecal samples, and the highest virus titers at the peak was significantly higher for

63

feces (105.8 copies/ml, mean 5623 copies/ml) than of respiratory samples (106.3

64

copies/ml, mean 2535 copies/ml) (Figure 1A). Notably, at 26 days after discharge,

65

case 3 was detected positive again in feces samples, but appears to be healthy and

66

negative for respiratory swabs. These results indicated that beside respiratory samples,

intestinal samples (e.g. feces) should be recommended for diagnosis of COVID-19,

68

especially for monitoring the relapse of discharged patients.

The nasal-throat mixed swabs and fecal samples of all 23 cases were detected by rRT-PCR targeting

95

ORF1ab, N and S genes (Mabsky Biotech Co., Ltd., CONFORMITE EUROPEENNE NO.), the Ct

96

values of ORF1ab gene were shown in (A). Sequential nasal-throat mixed swabs, feces, urine, and

97

plasma samples were collected in 11 cases and used for virus detection. The Ct values of nasal-throat

98

mixed swabs (solid line) and feces (dotted line) specimens were shown in (B). Two cases with severe

99

diseases, identified according to the guideline of HCoV-19 infection from the National Health

100

Commission of the People’s Republic of China, were colored in red. The other eight cases with

101

mild-to-moderate symptoms were in black. Ct values were inversely related to viral RNA copy number,

102

with Ct values of 37.6, 32.64, 29.22, and 25.77 corresponding to 1×103, 1×104, 1×105, and 1×106 copies

103

per mL. Negative samples were denoted with a Ct value of 43, which was the limit of detection.
