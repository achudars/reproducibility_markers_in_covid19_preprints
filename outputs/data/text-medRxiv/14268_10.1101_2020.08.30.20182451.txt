ABSTRACT

Background. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) type 2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 for entry into
lungs cells. Because ACE-2 may be modulated by ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor
blockers (ARBs), there is concern that patients treated with ACEIs and ARBs are at higher risk for
COVID-19 infection.
Aim. This study sought to analyze the association of COVID-19 with previous treatment with ACEI and
ARB.
Methods. We retrospectively reviewed 684 consecutive patients hospitalized for suspected COVID-19
pneumonia and tested by PCR. Patients were split into 2 groups, whether (group 1, n=484) or not
(group 2, n=250) COVID-19 was confirmed. Multivariate adjusted comparisons included a propensity
score analysis.
Results Age was 63.6±18.7 years, and 302(44%) were female. Hypertension was present in 42.6% and
38.4% patients of group 1 and 2, respectively (P=0.28). A treatment with ARBs (20.7% versus 12.0%,
respectively, OR 1.92, 95% confidence interval [1.23–2.98], p=0.004) was more frequent in patients of
group 1 than in group 2. No difference was found for treatment with ACEIs (12.7% vs 15.7%,
respectively, OR 0.81 [0.52–1.26], p=0.35). Propensity score matched multivariate logistic regression
confirmed a significant association between COVID-19 and a previous treatment with ARBs (adjusted
OR 2.18 [1.29–3.67], p=0.004). Significant interaction between ARBs and ACEIs for the risk of COVID19 was observed in patients aged>60, women, and hypertensive patients.
Conclusion. This study suggests that ACEIs and ARBs are not similarly associated with the COVID-19.
In this retrospective series, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia received more frequently a previous
treatment with ARBs, than patients without COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had been officially declared by the World Health Organization as a global
pandemic on March 11, 2020, and had been the main challenge that health care providers have had to
face. The relationships between COVID-19 and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and its
inhibitors have been widely debated. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2)
as a cellular entry receptor (1, 2). ACE-2 is furthermore a key enzyme of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS) that is likely to be modulated by the use of either angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers (ARBs) (3, 4). ACE-2 may
have a protective effect against lung injury because it degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7) (5).
The effect of RAAS inhibition on ACE-2 expression is complex (4, 6, 7), and poorly studied in humans
(8, 9).
ARBs have been demonstrated to be protective against lung injury in different experimental models of
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), infective or not (5, 10-12). In hypertensive patients already
affected by COVID-19 pneumonia, there is accumulating evidence that ACEI/ARB treatment is
associated with a lower mortality (13, 14).
In contrast, there is no evidence that ACEIs and ARBs could affect patients’ vulnerability to COVID-19.
A study conducted in a large US population found no association between ACEI or ARB use and
COVID-19 test positivity, although hospitalizations related to COVID-19 were more frequent in patients
treated by ACEIs/ARBs (15). Another case control study found a positive association between RAAS
blockers and the risk of COVID-19 that was explained by a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease
(16). Two other case-control studies were negative (17, 18) and showed no difference between ACEIs
and ARBs.
However, ACEIs and ARBs have different effect on the RAAS (4, 6) as well as on the risk of non
COVID-19 pneumonia (19). Their interaction with COVID-19 may therefore differ, with the hypothesis
that ACEIs could be more protective than ARBs against infection.
This study sought to compare the prevalence of hypertension and previous treatments with ACEIs and
ARBs at admission in a consecutive series of high-risk patients suspected of COVID-19 acute
pneumonia, hospitalized for confirmation or not of COVID-19 in a tertiary center located in the Greater
Paris area – one of the region most affected by COVID-19 in France.

METHODS
Study Design
The COVHYP study is a retrospective observational study that was prospectively planned in March,
2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Greater Paris Area in France, and registered in
May 2020 (NCT 04374695). The Centre Hospitalier de Versailles is a tertiary hospital that serves a
population of about 600.000 inhabitants. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki and protocol was approved by a national committee of research and the
French “Commission Nationale Informatique et Libertés”. Patients and/or legal representatives received
informed consent. Analyses were retrospective.

Study Population
From March 10 to April 15, 2020, all consecutive patients referred to the emergency department and
hospitalized in a temporary 24-72 hours “COVID-19 screening hospitalization unit” were screened for
inclusion. According to regional governmental guidelines, hospitalization was required for patients
suspected of COVID-19 having at least one criteria of severity (respiratory frequency >22/min,
spontaneous SpO2 <90%, systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, alteration of consciousness, fast
worsening of the general status or serious dehydration in the elderly), or having no severity criteria but a
medical history or comorbidities known to increase the risk in case of COVID-19 (listed in
supplementary material).
Patients were included into the study if they fulfilled the additional criteria as follows: 1) age ≥18 years;
2) Clinical presentation suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia, at least: fever > 38°C or influenza-like
symptoms (deep asthenia, myalgia, chills, muscular aches) associated with cough or dyspnea or need
for oxygen supply (SpO2 ≤90%); and 3) Test of the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 by reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in nasopharyngeal or sputum samples. Exclusion
criteria were the absence of clinical symptoms of COVID-19, no PCR performed, age < 18 year,
prisoners or detainees, and refusal to participate.
Laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 was defined as a positive result of real-time reverse
transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swabs, according to

the French National Reference Center of Respiratory Viruses and the WHO guidance (20). As
appropriate, a second RT-PCR assay from sputum or lower respiratory tract aspirates was proposed
when the clinical/radiological probability of COVID-19 was high and the first RT-PCR was negative in
swab. Almost all patients underwent a chest x ray imaging by chest radiography and/or chest CT scan
at the emergency unit. Antihypertensive and cardiac treatments received prior to admission were not
discontinued during the hospitalization in COVID-19 screening hospitalization unit.

Definition of groups
Patients were split into 2 groups, according to the result of SARS-CoV-2 PCR, chest imaging, and the
clinical presentation at discharge from the “COVID-19 screening hospitalization unit”. Group 1 (COVID19) consisted of patients with positive COVID-19 PCR (confirmed) and patients with symptoms and
chest CT-scan abnormalities very likely of COVID-19 despite negative PCR (probable). Group 2 (no
COVID-19) included patients with negative PCR and chest imaging not suggestive of COVID-19.

Data Collection
Clinical, radiological, and laboratory data reported in this study were collected from hospital medical
reports. The recorded data included the following: age, sex, initial symptoms, time from first symptoms
suggestive of COVID-19 and admission, chest imaging performed, result of RT-PCR, history of
hypertension, long-term treatments for hypertension, congestive heart failure, ischemic cardiopathy,
RAAS inhibitors (mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (MRBs), ACEIs, ARBs), and medical comorbidities
(asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, other chronic pulmonary diseases, chronic cardiac
diseases, cancer, hypothyroidism, allergies, and immunosuppression).

Statistical Analyses
Continuous data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median [interquartile ranges,
IQRs] as appropriate, and were compared between groups using analysis of variance or nonparametric
Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables are presented as counts and percentages, and were
compared using the χ2 test or the Fischer’s exact test. Multivariate analyses were performed using
logistic regression, with adjustment on age, sex, obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m²), hypertension
and history of chronic cardiac disease.

In addition to the main analysis, as in the observational studies, treatment selection is often influenced
by subject characteristics; in order to address the issues of confounding by indication, we used a
propensity score-matching analysis to balance the different RAAS treatments groups on the possible
baseline confounders Multivariate logistic regressions were performed, and the probability of receiving
ARBs (or ACEIs) given the observed covariates was estimated. All the variables listed in the
supplementary Table 1 were included in the model regardless of statistical significance.
After fitting the model, patients were ranked by their estimated propensity score and grouped within
quintiles. Quintiles are commonly used for adjustment, as they are expected to remove 90% of the
confounding. Propensity score adjusted analyses were then performed to compare the association
between COVID-19 status and previous treatments, either by univariate analyses by quintiles of
propensity score in each group, and multivariate logistic regression including the propensity score as a
covariate.
Stratified analyses were performed in pre-specified subgroups according gender, age > 60 years,
hypertension, and diabetes, using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Chi² statistics. A P value <.05 was
considered significant. All statistical analyses were carried out with the SPSS® version 19.0 software
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and the R version i386 3.6.2.software.

RESULTS
Baseline and initial symptoms
During the study period, 763 consecutive patients were hospitalized in COVID-19 screening unit, 79
were excluded (supplementary material), and 684 were included in the study. COVID-19 was diagnosed
in 434 patients (63.4%, 396 confirmed and 38 probable), and excluded in 250 patients (36.6%).
Baseline characteristics of patients of both groups are shown in Table 1. The two groups were well
balanced for fever or flu-like symptoms (almost all patients in both groups), cough (69.1% in group 1 vs
65.6% in group 2, respectively), ENT, digestive and neurologic symptoms. Dyspnea (75.8% vs 67.6%,
respectively), male gender and time from first symptoms to admission were higher in Group 1 than in
group 2. A second RT-PCR in sputum sample has been performed in 55 patients (8.0%) and was
positive in 17. Chest CT scan has been performed most frequently in patient with subsequently
confirmed COVID-19. A Discrepancy between chest imaging indicated as “suggestive of COVID” by

radiologist and discharge diagnosis of “no COVID-19” remained in 7 patients, all with congestive heart
failure or chronic pulmonary disease.

Comorbidities
The distributions of comorbidities are shown in Table 2. In this series of patients, a negative association
was found between COVID-19 and asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic heart
disease. Non-significant trend for a positive association was found for obesity and hypothyroidism.
History of congestive heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction <40% was present in only 3.2% of
patients (2.4% in group 1).

Hypertension and RAAS inhibitors
Hypertension was present in 42.6% and 38.4% patients of group 1 and 2, respectively (P=0.28) (Table
1), and increased with age, without differences between groups (Figure 1). Distribution of RAAS
inhibitors in both groups are shown in Table 3. No patient received the association valsartan-sacubitril,
and 1 patient received both an ACEI and an ARB. At least one inhibitor of the RAAS (ACEI, ARB or
MRB) was given in 34.1% of patients of group 1 and 26.8% of patient of group 2 (OR 1.41, 95%
confidence interval [1.00 – 1.99], p=0.05). Patients of group 1 received more frequently a treatment with
ARB as compared to those of group 2 (20.7% versus 12.0%, respectively, OR 1.92, 95%CI, [1.23 –
2.98], p=0.004]). No difference was found for ACEIs (12.7% vs 15.7%, respectively, OR 0.81, 95%CI,
[0.52 - 1.26], p=0.35) (Figure 2). These trends, although not significant, were also observed in the
subgroup of hypertensive patients (Table 3), who received more frequently an inhibitor of the RAAS in
group 1 and other classes of antihypertensive agents in group 2.
Propensity score matched multivariate logistic regression confirmed a significant association between
COVID-19 and a previous treatment with ARBs (adjusted OR 2.18, 95%CI, [1.29 - 3.67], p=0.004)
(Supplementary Table 1). Similar results were found when the 396 patients with PCR confirmed COVID19 were compared to the 250 patients without COVID-19 (supplementary material). Stratified analyses
(Figure 3) showed opposite Odds Ratios for the risk of COVID-19 associated with previous ARBs and
ACEIs, with significant interactions in women, patients aged > 60 years or with hypertension, and a nonsignificant trend in diabetic patients.

DISCUSSION
The results of this observational study conducted on a consecutive series of patients with clinical
presentation consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a positive association between COVID-19
and a previous treatment with ARBs, and no association with ACEIs. They suggest that a long-term
treatment with an inhibitor of RAAS may be not neutral for the vulnerability to the SARS-CoV-2, with a
trend for opposite effects of ARBs and ACEIs, particularly in aged patients and women. This may be of
importance, since it has been shown that women with hypertension are less frequently treated by ACEIs
and ARBs than men (21).
Unfortunately, the present results were discrepant with those of large observational retrospective
studies conducted in USA (15, 17), Italy (16), and Denmark (18), which found no difference in the
prevalence of RAAS inhibitors between COVID-19 patients and controls. These studies strongly differ
from the present study by the selection of either patients or controls. In these studies, a minority of
patients tested positive for COVID-19 were hospitalized (25-50%) (15, 16), and the rate of
hospitalization in controls is not given. Interestingly, in one study (15) a significant association was
found between ACEI/ARB treatment and hospitalization, with an odds ratio (1.93, 95%CI, 1.38-2.71)
close to that found for ARBs in the present study. For two studies, age- and sex-matched controls were
drawn from general population databases, and were not specifically tested for COVID-19 (16, 18). The
prevalence of treatment with RAAS inhibitors varied considerably in the overall study populations, from
12.5% and 18.4% In the US studies (15,17) to 45.6% in the Italian study (16), and >60% in the Danish
study, which was restricted to hypertensive patients (18). In all these studies, baseline characteristics
and comorbidities were different in cases and controls. In the present study, both patients and controls
were patients who presented to emergency hospital department for symptoms suggestive of acute
pulmonary infection, and who were admitted because of severity criteria, including the need for oxygen
supply. The more selective inclusion criteria resulted in baseline characteristics, clinical symptoms, and
comorbidities relatively well balanced between groups despite the absence of randomization, with the
exception that COVID-19 patients had a more severe respiratory presentation (more dyspnea, lower
SpO2, higher extension of pulmonary lesions on CT scan, more admission in ICU) than controls. These
differences in selection criteria may in part explain the difference in the results.
There are theoretical arguments for different effects of ACEIs and ARBs on the RAAS, and the
vulnerability against pulmonary infection. Both ACEI and ARB have been shown to increase cardiac

ACE-2 gene transcription in some animal models (3, 5), but there is no evidence that inhibitors of the
RAAS upregulate the transmembrane ACE-2 receptor expression in human lung (22). Moreover,
several experimental and clinical data suggest that ACEIs and ARBs have not similar effects on ACE-2
expression and activity. In a murine model of myocardial ischemia, the upregulation of ACE-2 induced
by lisinopril was higher than that induced by losartan, but was associated with no increase in cardiac
ACE-2 activity. In the same model, lisinopril and losartan were associated with opposite variations in
plasma Angiotensin (Ang) II and Ang(1-7)/Ang II ratio (4). Conflicting evidence was also reported with
ramipril that failed to increase ACE-2 (8). Discrepant effects of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE-2 mRNA and
activity, as well as RAAS metabolism have been summarized by Kreutz et al. (6).
Differences between ACEI and ARBs have also been found for the human vulnerability to pulmonary
infections. In a meta-analysis of 37 studies (17), ACEIs were associated with a reduced risk of
pneumonia as compared with control treatment (OR 0.66, 95%CI, 0.55 to 0.80), but also with ARBs (OR
estimate 0.69, 95%CI, 0.56 to 0.85). In contrast, similar protective effects of either ACEIs or ARBs on
the risk of influenza have been demonstrated in a large British population (23). During a median 8.7
years of follow-up, patients who were treated with ACEIs had a lower risk of influenza than those who
had not (adjusted hazard ratio 0.66; 95%CI, 0.62 to 0.70). Conversely, in-hospital usage of ACEIs
trended to have a higher incidence and risk of 28-day COVID-19 mortality than usage of ARBs in a
retrospective Chinese study (24). One of our hypotheses when planning this study was that ACEIs
could have a protective effect against the risk of COVID-19, and not ARBs. Although odds ratios for
COVID-19 pneumonia associated with ACEIs and ARBs varied inversely in the present study, we did
not confirm a protective effect of long-term treatment with ACEIs in all patients. The results suggest a
significant association between the risk of developing COVID-19 pneumonia and a previous treatment
with ARBs. The protective effect associated with ACEIs was however likely in women and patients aged
> 60 years (Figure 3).
This study did not investigate the association between RAAS inhibitors and the severity of COVID-19.
This point is of importance since there is accumulating evidence that ARBs have protective effects on
the development of ARDS triggered by pathogens, including the Coronaviruses (10-12). Genetic
deletion of ACE-2 worsened experimental ARDS (1), while Ang (1-7) and blockade of AT1 receptors
improved it (4). In humans, ACEIs and ARBs were neutral (25) or were associated with a decrease in
severity of pneumonia due to COVID-19 (13) and mortality among hypertensive patients (14).

It is therefore necessary to clearly distinguish two aspects of the relationship between ACEIs and ARBs,
and COVID-19. The first one is the questionable protective or deleterious effect of ACEIs and ARBs on
SARS-CoV-2 lung invasion and infection. The second one is the likely protective effect of RAAS
inhibitors against progression of COVID-19 and ARDS, when lungs are already infected. The results of
the present study are restricted to the vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and do not involve the
severity of the COVID-19 pneumonia. They suggest a negative effect of ARBs, not of ACEIs. The
results have to be confirmed by data from large observational studies or even randomised clinical trials.
Until results of confirmatory studies are not available, and because discontinuation of ACEIs or ARBs
may be harmful in high-risk patients (26), recommendations for continuing RAAS inhibitors in patients
affected by- or at high risk for COVID-19 should be respected (27).

Study Limitations
This study has several limitations. Although it was prospectively designed, collection and analyses of
data were retrospective. The biases classically associated with retrospective studies may account for
the observed differences. Particularly, a misclassification of patients with and without COVID-19 may
have occurred. In case of discrepancy between typical clinical symptoms/chest CT scan abnormalities
and a first negative RT-PCR in swab, routine practice was to perform a second PCR in sputum sample,
as appropriate, and reach a final collegial diagnosis with clinicians and radiologists if the second PCR
was negative. In our study 38/384 of patients of group 1 were diagnosed having probable COVID-19
despite negative PCR. This corresponds to an overall RT-PCR false negative rate of 10%, much lower
than the 30% false negative rate reported in Wuhan, China (28). Conversely, few patients who tested
negative for PCR were classified as “no COVID-19”, although abnormalities in chest CT scan were
consistent with COVID-19. Most of these latter patients had non typical symptoms and an alternative
diagnosis (pulmonary infection complicated congestive heart failure or chronic pulmonary disease).
Nevertheless, in order to take into account and overcome this putative bias, additional analyses were
done excluding the 38 patients with probable COVID-19 (Supplementary Table 3), and then pooling the
probable COVID-19 with the non-COVID-19 patients (Supplementary Table 4). Similar results were
found in the first case, and borderline non-significant results in the second case, the least favorable to
the hypothesis of a significant association between ARBs and COVID-19.

Because of potential confounding factors, analyses were adjusted on propensity scores taking into
account variates that were independently associated with previous treatments by ARBs or ACEIs.
Propensity score adjusted analyses confirmed the positive association between ARBs and COVID-19.
Finally, individual creatinine levels were not collected and no adjustment was made on renal function, a
potential confounding factor.

Conclusions
This study confirmed that, overall, RAAS blockers are not associated with the risk of COVID-19.
However, comparative analyses suggested that ACEIs and ARBs are not similarly associated with the
COVID-19 incidence, the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia receiving more frequently a previous
treatment with ARBs than patients without COVID-19. An opposite effect of ACEIs, likely to be
protective, and ARBs, not protective, was observed in women and aged patients. The results of the
present study need to be interpreted with caution, given the retrospective monocentric observational
design of the study. These results have to be confirmed and do not question the current
recommendations to continue long term treatments with ACEIs and ARBs, particularly in patients
already infected by SARS-CoV-2.
