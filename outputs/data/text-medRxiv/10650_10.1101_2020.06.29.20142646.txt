ABSTRACT
Objectives: The aim is to systematically describe the findings of lung ultrasound in
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and to analyze its prognostic value.
Methods: Lung ultrasound was performed to 63 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia
admitted to a University Hospital. Lung involvement was evaluated using a 4-point
scale with a 12-area pulmonary division (lung score -LS-). Ultrasound findings, along
with clinical characteristics, were recorded.
Results: All patients showed ultrasound involvement in at least 1 area (mean 8 ± 3.5).
Total LS was 15.3 ± 8.1, without differences between left and right lung. Most affected
regions were the lower one (95.2%) and the posterior one (73.8%). Total LS showed a
strong correlation (r = -0.765) with PaO2/FiO2; by lung regions, those with a higher
correlation were the LS of the anterior one (r = -0.823) and the LS of the upper one (r =
-0.731). 22.2% of patients required non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS).
Multivariate analysis shows that anterior region LS, adjusted for age and sex, is
significant (odds ratio 2.159, 95% confidence interval 1.309 to 3.561) for the risk of
requiring NIRS. Anterior region LS ≥ 4 and total LS ≥19 have similar characteristics to
predict the need for NIRS.
Conclusions: Ultrasound involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia is bilateral and
heterogeneous. Most affected regions are the posterior and the lower ones. The anterior
region has prognostic value, because its involvement strongly correlates with the risk of
requiring NIRS, and an anterior region LS ≥ 4 has high sensitivity and specificity for
predicting the need for NIRS.
Key words: Lung ultrasound, COVID-19, pneumonia

INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, a new coronavirus was identified in hospitalized patients in Wuhan
(China)1, initially named 2019-nCov. On February 11, 2020, the World Health
Organization (WHO) formally named COVID-19 the disease caused by this new virus,
whose name changed, by decision of the Coronavirus Study Group of the International
Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses, to SARS-Cov-2. The number of COVID-19
cases grew exponentially and on March 11, 2020, the WHO officially declared the
pandemic2. As of May 20, 2020, the WHO recognizes 4,731,458 cases worldwide, and
316,169 deaths3. On the same date, in Spain, the Ministry of Health acknowledges the
(official) existence of 232,037 cases and 27,778 deaths 4.
COVID-19 symptoms are mostly nonspecific and common to any respiratory tract
infection. Approximately 14% of patients develop severe disease and 5% present a
critical situation5.
Imaging tests are necessary to evaluate patients with suspected pneumonia. Pulmonary
ultrasound is a portable, fast, radiation-free, non-invasive method that has been used for
the initial assessment, diagnosis, prognostic stratification, and monitoring of pneumonia
in the pre-COVID-19 era6,7 and during the COVID-198-10.
First to report lung ultrasound results in patients with COVID-19 were Huang et al11,
with a non-systematic description of findings in 20 patients. Since then, numerous
works have been published, but most are case descriptions, small series, or
recommendations and reviews8-19. All of them are based on the search for classic
ultrasound signs of interstitial involvement (B-pattern) and consolidation (C-pattern),
originally described by Lichtenstein20,21.
Numerous ultrasound findings have been reported in patients with COVID-19, but a
systematic description of the ultrasound presentation of COVID-19 pneumonia has not
been published to date.
The aim of this work is to describe in a systematic way the pulmonary ultrasound
findings in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and to analyze if echographic
characteristics correlate with pneumonia severity and/or with clinical course.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Prospective study carried out in patients admitted with the diagnosis of COVID-19
pneumonia in a University Hospital that serves a population of 245,000 people. The
project has been approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the University
Hospital of Guadalajara (Spain), and informed consent has been obtained from all
patients.
From March 19, 2020 to April 19, 2020, thoracic ultrasound was performed on 63
patients admitted to the Pneumology Service (no patients were excluded) with a
diagnosis of pneumonia (confirmed with a simple chest x-ray and/or thoracic computed
tomography -CT-) by COVID-19 (confirmed with PCR in nasopharyngeal exudate

and/or serological tests). Ultrasound was performed in the first 48 hours after hospital
admission or transfer to our Service.
Following recommendations published jointly by the Spanish Society of Pneumology
and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR) and the Spanish Association of Respiratory Endoscopy
(AEER)22, 6 areas were delimited in each hemithorax (Figure 1). In each area, all
accessible intercostal spaces were explored, from medial to lateral and from inferior to
superior. A score was assigned to each area according to the following scale (in the case
of observing more than one in the same area, the highest score was assigned):
• 0 points: A-pattern, defined by the existence of a regular and not thickened pleural
line, with sliding sign, and the presence of A-lines.
• 1 point: B7-pattern, defined by the presence (in the same ultrasound field) of more
than 3 B-lines with a separation of approximately 7 mm between them measured at the
pleural line level.
• 2 points: B3-pattern, defined by the presence (in the same ultrasound field) of more
than 3 B-lines with a separation of approximately 3 mm between them measured at the
pleural line level, or the existence of confluent B-lines (white lung).
• 3 points: C-pattern, defined by the presence of an irregular or discontinuous pleural
line, with small subpleural consolidations, or the existence of frank consolidation with
air bronchogram and/or liquid bronchogram.
For purposes of analysis and comparisons, the following lung regions have been
defined:
- Anterior region: R1 and R2 (right), L1 and L2 (left)
- Posterior region: R5 and R6 (right), L5 and L6 (left)
- Lateral region: R3 and R4 (right), L3 and L4 (left)
- Upper region: R2, R4 and R6 (right), L2, L4 and L6 (left)
- Lower region: R1, R3 and R5 (right), L1, L3 and L5 (left)
The score (lung score -LS-) was recorded for each area and for each region (sum of its
areas), both unilaterally and bilaterally, as well as the total LS for each patient
(minimum 0, maximum 36).
In 55 patients the ultrasound examination was performed while sitting, while in 8 was
performed in the supine position; in the latter, the patient was temporarily placed in the
right lateral position to explore L5 and L6 areas, and in the left lateral position to
explore R5 and R6 areas.
The following data were also collected for each patient: age, sex, days elapsed since the
onset of symptoms, PaO2/FiO2 ratio (PAFI) and need for non-invasive respiratory
support (NIRS), which includes high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, CPAP and
noninvasive mechanical ventilation.
To perform the ultrasound, a C5-2 convex probe was used with the Lumify system
using the lung configuration (Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands) attached to a Galaxy
Tab A 2019 tablet (Samsung Electronics, Seoul, South Korea). The ultrasound probe
was protected with CIV-Flex cover (CIVCO Medical Instruments, Kalona, Iowa, USA)
and the tablet with a clear plastic sleeve, which were discarded after each examination.

Statistical analysis has been performed with SPSS for Mac version 26 (IBM, New York,
USA). Results of qualitative variables are expressed as percentages and absolute
frequencies. For quantitative variables, mean and standard deviation are expressed.
Comparison of discrete variables was carried out using the chi-square test, and that of
independent means of quantitative variables using the Student's t test. For comparison
of multiple means, the block ANOVA with Tukey's HSD post-hoc test was used. A p <
0.05 was considered statistically significant. For multivariate analysis, a binary logistic
regression model with Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test was used. For the
analysis of the ROC curves, sensitivity, specificity and Youden’s index were used.

RESULTS
Patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Ultrasound involvement
A-pattern was found in 251 out of 756 examined lung areas (33.2%), B7-pattern in 203
(26.8%), B3-pattern in 143 (19%) and C-pattern in 159 (21%).
Distribution of ultrasound findings:
The distribution of ultrasound findings by pulmonary areas is shown in Table 2.
We found ultrasound involvement (defined as the finding of a pattern other than Apattern) in 8 ± 3.5 lung areas per patient (4.1 ± 1.7 in the right lung, 3.9 ± 1.9 in the left
lung, p = 0.306). Involvement of at least one lung area was observed in all patients. In
only 4 out of 63 patients (6.3%) the involvement was unilateral. Small unilateral pleural
effusion was observed in 3 patients (4.8%).
Anteroposterior distribution: the posterior region was affected in 118 out of 126
examined lungs (93.6%), the lateral one in 93 (73.8%) and the anterior one in 79
(62.7%). Only in 23 lungs (18.2%) a single region was affected: in 19 (15.1%) the
posterior one, in 1 (0.8%) the lateral one, and in 3 (2.4%) the anterior one.
Craniocaudal distribution: the upper region was affected in 111 out of 126 examined
lungs (88.1%) and the lower one in 120 (95.2%). Only in 13 lungs (10.3%) a single
region was affected: in 11 (8.7%) the lower one and in 2 (1.6%) the upper one.
Degree of involvement: The mean total LS per patient was 15.3 ± 8.1 (range 1 to 33).
The comparison of LS between lung regions is shown in Table 3.
Correlation with gasometric severity
The mean of PAFI was 304.4 ± 93 (range 141 to 462). Table 4 shows the comparison of
PAFI according to the presence or absence of ultrasound signs of consolidation (Cpattern) and the involvement or not of different lung regions.
Correlation between PAFI and total LS shows r = -0.765 (p <0.001). Correlation
between PAFI and LS of the different lung regions is shown in Figure 2, being
especially striking with the LS of the anterior and superior regions.

Prognostic value
Table 5 presents patients’ characteristics according to the need of NIRS, where we can
see that, although patients who required NIRS had involvement of all lung regions, best
discrimination occurs in the anterior one (p = 0.006).
In a univariate logistic regression model for the risk of requiring NIRS, the significant
variables were age (odds ratio -OR-: 1.096, 95% confidence interval -CI-: 1.037-1.158)
and anterior region LS (OR: 1.809, CI: 1.303-2.510). In the multivariate model OR for
age was 1.130, CI 1.041-1.277, while OR for anterior region LS was 2.159, CI 1.3093.561.
Figure 3 shows ROC curves for the need of SRNI according to the LS of different lung
regions. The ones with the best characteristics are total LS and anterior region LS.
Table 6 shows sensitivity, specificity and Youden’s index of different cut-off points of
total LS and anterior region LS for predicting the need of NIRS. The best cut-off points
were total LS ≥ 19 and anterior region LS ≥ 4.
DISCUSSION
This study systematically describes the findings of pulmonary ultrasound in patients
with COVID-19 pneumonia and identifies its prognostic value, since the LS of the
anterior lung region correlates with gasometric severity and the need for NIRS.
In our series, distribution by sex shows a significantly greater representation of men.
This has not been observed in COVID-19 general population5, 23 although in some series
that focus on patients with pneumonia, a higher proportion of men has been
reported24,25, but not in others26,27.
Ultrasound involvement
To calculate the LS of each area we have used the 4-point scale developed for the
ultrasound evaluation of respiratory distress syndrome28, which is the one used by all
authors to date, although recently Soldatti et al.19 made a slightly different
standardization proposal specific for COVID-19 patients.
Most affected lung region is the posterior one, followed by the lateral one and the
anterior one. Involvement is bilateral in most cases (93.7%) and finding of pleural
effusion is rare (4.8%). These data are in line with that published in the series that
analyse lung involvement both with chest CT25-27,29 and with ultrasound11,15.
There is no significant difference in ultrasound involvement between left and right lung.
But there is, however, by lung regions, so that the lower region is affected more
frequently than the upper one and its degree of involvement is also greater. The same
occurs with the posterior region, which is affected more frequently than the anterior one
and with a greater degree of involvement, which may perhaps help explain the
improvement in oxygenation observed with pronation in many patients, both in classic
distress31 and in COVID-19 pneumonia31,32.
Gasometric severity
PAFI is one of the most objective and reliable parameters for assessing oxygenation
status33, it is an important criterion for assessing the severity of pneumonia34 and
defines severity in acute respiratory distress syndrome35. In our results, PAFI shows a
good negative correlation with total LS, which is not surprising, but it is especially

relevant that when examined by lung regions, the most significant negative correlation
of PAFI was with LS of the anterior region. On the other hand, patients who have
ultrasound involvement of the anterior region have a significantly lower mean PAFI
than those who do not.
Prognostic value
22.2% of patients required NIRS. When variables are entered into a multivariate logistic
regression model to determine the risk of requiring NIRS, those that show statistical
significance are age and LS of the anterior region.
Total LS and anterior region LS behave similarly in terms of characteristics of their
ROC curves to predict the need for NIRS. When the possible cut-off points are
analysed, total LS ≥ 19 and anterior region LS ≥ 4 show similar values. From a practical
point of view, this may be important in some situations, because ultrasound examination
of the anterior region requires less time and is more accessible than a complete
ultrasound examination, especially in patients who cannot adopt the sitting position.
Weakness and strength
The main weakness of this study is that not all patients admitted for COVID-19
pneumonia have been included, since the enormous caseload of these days prevented
ultrasound examination for all of them. However, we believe that this fact does not
cause an inclusion bias, since the decision to perform or not ultrasound depended only
on the care burden of each day.
The main strength is that this is a prospective study and that the ultrasound examination
was done with the operator unaware about patients’ radiological examinations and
clinical situation, knowing only the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. This eliminates
the part of subjectivity that may have the interpretation of ultrasound images.
Conclusions
In conclusion, in COVID-19 pneumonia the ultrasound involvement is bilateral and
heterogeneous. Pleural effusion is very rare. The degree of total ultrasound involvement
shows a strong correlation with gasometric severity of pneumonia. The most affected
lung regions are the posterior and the inferior ones. The anterior region, although
usually more spared, is the one that implies a worse prognosis since its degree of
involvement, along with age, predicts the need for non-invasive respiratory support. An
anterior lung region lung score ≥ 4 has a high sensitivity and specificity to predict the
need for non-invasive respiratory support.
