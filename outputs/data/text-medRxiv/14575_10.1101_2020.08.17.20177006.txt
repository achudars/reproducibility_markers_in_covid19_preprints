Abstract. We report the single-strand Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (ssRPA) method, which merges the fast,
isothermal amplification of RPA with subsequent rapid conversion of the double-strand DNA amplicon to single strands,
and hence enables facile hybridization-based, high-specificity readout. We demonstrate the utility of ssRPA for sensitive
and rapid (4 copies per 50 µL reaction within 10 min, or 8 copies within 8 min) visual detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
spiked samples, as well as clinical saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs in VTM or water, on lateral flow devices. The ssRPA
method promises rapid, sensitive, and accessible RNA detection to facilitate mass testing in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Introduction. Effective and accessible mass testing can help to limit the spread of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
While serology testing reveals recent and past exposure, RNA testing allows early detection of active infection. Standard
RT-qPCR1 and relatives2–10 achieve high analytical sensitivity (1-100 copies of viral RNA per input µl)11, but take hours
and require relatively complex equipment. New sequencing approaches promise high multiplexing but slow response
further12–15. In contrast, isothermal methods such as Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA)16–22, RecombinaseAided Amplification (RAA)23, Nicking Enzyme Amplification Reaction (NEAR)24, Loop-mediated isothermal
Amplification (LAMP)25–39, and Rapid Amplification (RAMP, an RPA + LAMP combination)25 typically detect 10-1000
copies of RNA per reaction with minimal or no instrumentation (see review40). The RPA reaction can generate doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) amplicons particularly quickly, but its recombinase-driven priming process is prone to multi-base
mismatching that necessitates an additional specificity check39,41. Augmentation of RPA with conditionally extensible
primers or cleavable inter-primer probes enhances specificity16,42,43, but tends to reduce reaction speed. Alternatively,
Cas1234 or Cas1319,44 nucleases applied to amplification products generate signal in a sequence specific manner, but incur
substantial increases in workflow complexity and reaction time. Here, we describe “single-strand RPA” (ssRPA) method,
which applies (1) rapid amplification of dsDNA, (2) conversion to ssDNA, and (3) sequence-specific, hybridization-based
readout, arranged to maintain both optimal speed and accuracy (Fig. 1a). For amplification, we apply basic RT-RPA16 in
the absence of any specificity-enhancing components that may inhibit speed. For ssDNA conversion, we use an
exonuclease to digest strands except those chemically protected. Finally, hybridization-based readout is shown with LFDs.
Results. We selected the 5′ end of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence as our main detection target. Per the detailed
protocol of Fig. 1b (and Supplementary Protocol), we diluted the sample in a basic RT-RPA reaction mixture, modifying
the forward primer with a 5′ tail of 6 phosphorothioate-linked bases to confer exonuclease protection45,46. The reaction was
run for 5 min at 42°C on a heating block. A sample of the product was then treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
and diluted into an exonuclease and lateral flow (exo/LFD) buffer, where the unprotected strand in the dsDNA was
rapidly (≤ 1 min) digested by a T7 exonuclease to yield the protected ssDNA target45,46. A pair of 3′-biotin and 5′-FAM
modified probes in the digestion buffer were available to target sequences in between the amplification priming domains,
providing specificity not achievable with RPA priming alone. The correct target ssDNA therefore acted as a bridge that
co-localized both detection probes within an LFD, ultimately binding gold nanoparticles to the biotin-ligand test line to
produce visual readout as early as 1-2 minutes. Full amplification and detection timelines are described in Fig. 1c.
We first tested ssRPA on buffer-spiked samples. Figure 1d (and Supplementary Fig. S1) shows LFD detection of synthetic
SARS-CoV-2 full genome standard serially diluted in DNase/RNase-free water, photographed at multiple intervals on the
same strips. Concentrations of input RNA were quantified by RT-qPCR and direct comparison to spectrophotometricallyquantified synthetic standards (Fig. S2). Results show detection of 8 copies per 50 µL reaction by naked eye within 8 min
(2 min LFD), or 4 copies within 10 min (4 min LFD), and a dynamic range of at least 5 orders of magnitude. No test line
signal formed for the no-template negative controls over >60 min of LFD incubation. To test for assay reliability, we
spiked 5 µL human saliva with 8 copies of cultured, heat-inactivated virus and showed 20 of 20 positive tests within 8 min
(Figs. 1e and S3). To test for specificity, we performed ssRPA on water spiked with viral RNA from 8 other respiratory
viruses, including genomically similar coronaviruses and alternative diagnoses, each at >105 copies per assay. None
exhibited false positive signals (Figs. 1f and S4). Finally, we performed a blinded assay on clinical samples, with a
technician unaware of patient type or qPCR result correctly identifying the type (positive or negative) of all 18 samples at
2 min LFD time. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs stored in viral transport media (VTM), NP swabs stored in water, and saliva
samples were processed by single-tube RNA extraction (1:1 mixture with extraction buffer, 95 °C × 2 min)47 and used at
10% v/v in RT-RPA (Figs. 1g and S5). All clinical samples were also semi-quantified by RT-qPCR, using column
extraction/concentration and CDC N2 primers (Fig. 1g, S7). Results of this limited study demonstrate 100% sensitivity
and 100% specificity across all sample types, including NP swabs in water and saliva samples with lower titers (high Ct).

Figure 1: ssRPA assay design, workflow, and characterization. (a) Key to ssRPA design is the rapid generation of many ssDNA copies
from a single RNA target. ssDNA output offers straightforward specific readout by fluorescence or colorimetric/visual methods such as
lateral flow devices. (b) Step 1: Target viral RNA region (of domains a-b-c-d) is reverse transcribed into cDNA via extension of the reverse
primer (d*) by the Reverse Transcriptase in the reaction mixture48. Subsequently, the cDNA is amplified via isothermal RPA at 42 °C by
templated extension of the forward (a) and reverse primers (d*). The forward primer has a 6-nucleotide long poly-T segment with
phosphorothioate bonds. Step 2a: Products of RPA are amended with SDS and transferred to the exo/LFD buffer that contains T7
exonuclease (a dsDNA-specific 5′ to 3′ exonuclease) and detection probes. The resulting mixture is incubated for 1 min at ambient
temperature and reverse strand of the dsDNA amplicon products get preferentially digested yielding ssDNA amplicon (a-b-c-d) homologous
to the target RNA sequence. Step 2b: The 3′ biotin (b*) and 5′ FAM (c*) modified detection probes, already added, hybridize to target
sequences. These probes make the assay directly compatible with commercially available test strips that feature a biotin-binding test line and
gold nanoparticles conjugated to rabbit anti-FAM IgG on the conjugate pad. Step 3: The test strip is vertically inserted into the resulting 100
µl mixture. The right ssDNA amplicon acts as a bridge that binds both the biotin-probe and the FAM-probe independently resulting in
immobilization of the complex at the test line, where formation of a colored line indicates a positive result. The control line formed of rabbit
secondary antibodies captures the remaining gold nanoparticle conjugates by binding to rabbit anti-FAM IgG. (c) Timeline of the assay
shows the incubation conditions and duration of the 3 main steps in ssRPA: (1) RT-RPA, (2) exonuclease digestion and (3) lateral flow. The
test line and control line can be visualized as early as 1-2 min or as late as 60+ min without false positives. (d) Sensitivity of ssRPA-LFD

demonstrated by serial dilution of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 full genome standard (Twist) from ~ 1,000,000 copies down to ~ 2 copies per
reaction. A 5 µl volume of genomic viral RNA in DNase/RNase-free water was used as input for a 50 µl reaction volume. After RT-RPA for
5 minutes at 42 °C, 8 µl product was mixed with 12 µl of 10% SDS and then transferred into 80 µl of exo/LFD buffer. Following 1 min T7
exonuclease digestion at room temperature, samples were applied to commercial HybriDetect strips for ≥ 1 min. A time series for the same
strip is shown in each column. Note the zero test line signal in negative controls, even at 60 min. (e) Using the same procedure as in (d), but
spiking 8 copies cultured, heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus (BEI) into 5 µl of SARS-CoV-2-negative human saliva in 20 repeats. Notemplate negative controls are also shown. (f) Specificity was shown by testing 8 other respiratory virus genomic samples, including
genomically similar coronaviruses 229E, MERS, (2003) SARS-CoV, and NL63, and alternative diagnoses of influenza B, influenza A,
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus 17, each at >105 copies per assay and spiked in DNase/RNase-free water. A sample with
virus-derived SARS-CoV-2 RNA at low copy is shown as a positive control. Strips show the readout at 10 min of lateral flow. (g) Clinical
samples were taken as NP swabs in VTM, NP swabs in water, or saliva, from SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients alike, and heat
inactivated at vendor for safety. Sample order was randomized prior to ssRPA, and technician was blinded as to patient type or qPCR status
to avoid experimental bias. During assay, samples further underwent a 2 min extraction protocol with Lucigen DNA extraction buffer at 50%
dilution and 95 °C, and were tested at 10% v/v into ssRPA for 5′ spike targets (see Methods). Non-extracted samples yielded little or no
signal (Fig. S6). Presumptive diagnosis from supplier testing is noted. Concomitant qPCR quantification in our lab, using CDC N2 primers
from buffer-exchanged samples, is shown with each result (See also Fig. S7).

Discussion. The ssRPA method combines the speed of established RT-RPA16 with the sequence specificity of ssDNA
hybridization by serially applying RPA and exonuclease steps. It enables best-in-class performance on the principal axes
of reaction time and sensitivity, enabling the detection of 8 copies in 8 min or 4 copies in 10 min. The conceptual
framework could be generalized to other isothermal readout methods with dsDNA output for achieving optimal sensitivity
and speed. The present method may also be further developed to achieve single-nucleotide specificity, for example by
using toehold probe readout19, and spatial multiplexing readout on LFDs with multiple test positions. We also expect
future development, including simplified workflow and use of lyophilized reagents for ambient distribution and storage,
will further facilitate mass testing.

Methods. Sample sources. Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Twist Biosciences, 102019) was used in sample qPCR quantification and in the
serial dilution experiment of Fig. 1d. Synthetic fragment RNA (IDT), constituting the 76 nt region beginning at the 5′ end of the spike
sequence (“5′ S region”), was used in sample qPCR quantification and ordered as Ultramers at 20 nmol scale. All synthetic primers and
probes (IDT) were chemically synthesized with any specified modifications, ordered at 100 or 250 nmol scale, desalted or PAGE-purified,
and used as is. Viral genomic RNA (isolated from infected cells) from coronaviruses 229E (ATCC, VR-740D), MERS (BEI, NR-50549),
SARS-CoV-1 (BEI, NR-52346), and NL63 (BEI, NR-44105), as well as influenza A (ATCC, VR-1736D), influenza B (ATCC, VR-1535D),
respiratory syncytial virus (ATCC, VR-1580DQ), and rhinovirus (ATCC, VR-1663D), were used for the specificity experiment in Fig. 1e.
Cultured and heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (BEI, NR-52286) was used in specificity (Fig. 1e) and in spiked saliva (Fig. 1f)
experiments. Pooled human saliva from ≥ 3 de-identified donors (Lee Biosolutions, 991-05-P) was collected prior to November 2019 and
used to prepare the contrived samples. All clinical samples (Fig. 1g) were purchased from BioCollections Worldwide, Inc. and heatinactivated at 95 °C for 5 min prior to shipping.
Primer and probe design. Relatively clean RPA products are the result of multiple primer pairs designed in silico for the appropriate salt and
temperature conditions (NUPACK.org) and extensively tested empirically, with the goal of minimizing primer dimers and other unintended
reactions that might slow the targeted amplification. RPA primer sequences and LFD probes for SARS-CoV-2 5′ spike target were as
follows, where “*” denotes a phosphorothioate bond (for exonuclease protection), “/iFluorT/” denotes an internal FAM fluorophore (for
nanoparticle capture), “/3ddC/” denotes 3′ dideoxycytidine (to prevent 3′ end extension), and “/3Bio/” denotes 3′ biotin (for test line capture).
Here, the probe sequences partly overlap with primer sequences, but not enough to bind significantly to those sequences in isolation. This
overlap is not necessary. Also note that, for extended protection, an internal fluorescein with poly-phosphorothioate protection is noted here,
though we have had similar results with a simple 5′ /56-FAM/ moiety. Probes and primers for 5′ spike were: Fwd primer:
T*T*T*T*T*T*TAACATCACTAGGTTTCAAACTTTACTTGC; Rev primer: CCAACCTGAAGAAGAATCA CCAGGAGTCAA; FAM
LFD probe: T*T*T*T*T*T*T /iFluorT/ TTTTTTTTTTTTT AGGAGTCAA ATAACTT/3ddC/; Biotin LFD probe: T*T*T*T*T*T*
TATGTAAA GCAAGTAAAG TTTTTTTTTTTTTTT /3Bio/.
Sample preparation. SARS-CoV-2 samples were quantified in-house, comparing fluorometrically-quantified synthetic RNA fragments
(IDT), Twist Biosciences qPCR RNA standards, and culture-derived BEI viral genome samples, all diluted in DNase/RNase-free water (See
SI Fig. S2). Synthetic fragment (IDT) RNA segment was quantified by Nanodrop spectrophotometry by blanking with IDTE buffer (IDT)
and then measuring absorbance at 260 nm with a 2 µl sample volume. Ten-fold serial dilutions of the synthetic fragment (IDT) RNA segment
were made from 107 copies/µl down to 103 copies/µl in DNase/RNase-free water, using low binding tips and tubes to avoid sample loss.
Similarly, Twist synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA were serially diluted in ten-fold (0.1×, 0.01×, 0.001×) for comparison. Amplification by qPCR
(Bio-Rad, CFX Connect) was then performed with 4× TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR master mix (Life Science, A15300), 5′ spike primers (100
nM), and EvaGreen dye (Thermofisher) at 20 µl total volume with 1 µl sample volume. A linear regression was performed on the Ct and
expected dilution concentrations of the standard (R2 = 0.99745), and in turn used to convert sample Ct to absolute quantities of 552000,
55400, and 7200 copies/µl, respectively. This quantified Twist sample was then used in a dilution series to quantify the culture-derived (BEI)
RNA using Charite “E” primer and sequence-specific probe set (IDT). Here, qPCR was performed with 5 µl of 4× TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR
master mix, 3 µl of Charite “E” primers/probes, and 7 µl of DNase/RNase-free water at 20 µl total volume with 5 µl input sample volume.
Simple and contrived samples were prepared by further diluting quantified samples as necessary, spiking into DNase/RNase-free water or
pooled human saliva at ~ 2 or more copies per 5 µl, and used directly in RT-RPA reactions. For the specificity experiments, genomic RNA
from 8 respiratory viruses were spiked in DNase/RNase-free water at 105 copies/µl, unless noted (in which case quantification was not
supplied from source). As a positive control, heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus was used at 100 copies/µl. All were diluted 1:50 (1 µl input
into 50 µl total reaction volume) in the RT-RPA reaction mixture.
RT-RPA. A mixture of 2.5 µl each of 10 µM forward and reverse primers to the specified target, 29.5 µl of TwistAmp Basic RPA rehydration
buffer (TwistDx, TABAS03KIT), 5 µl of DNase/RNase-free water, and 0.5 µl of Protoscript II reverse transcriptase (NEB, M0368S) were
vortexed briefly and added to the TwistAmp lyophilized powder mix. Then, 5 µl of sample was added to the tube while 5 µl of 280 mM
Magnesium Acetate was added to the reaction tube lid. The 50 µl mixture was vortexed briefly, spun down, vortexed again, spun down once
more and immediately incubated at 42 °C for 5 min in a standard PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, 4484073) or heating block (Benchmark
Scientific, BSH300).
Amplicon digestion. During amplification, a digestion and LFD buffer mixture was prepared with 64 µl of LFD running buffer (Milenia,
MGHD 1), 1 µl of 10 µM biotin probes, 1 µl of 10 µM FAM probes, 10 µl of 10× NEBuffer 4 (NEB, B7004S), and 4 µl of T7 exonuclease
(NEB, M0263S), in a total volume of 80 µl. The mixture was vortexed briefly and added to a 2 mL lo-bind tube (Eppendorf). Once complete,
8 µl of the RT-RPA reaction was subsequently mixed thoroughly and completely with a 10% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) at a ratio of 8 µl
sample:12 µl SDS to inactivate enzymes. This 20 µl mixture was then added to the 80 µl digestion mixture above and incubated for 1 min at
room temperature.
Electrophoresis. All gels (8 × 8 cm) were denaturing PAGE at 15% polyacrylamide (Invitrogen, EC6885BOX), run in 1× TBE buffer that
was diluted from 10× TBE (Promega, V4251) with filtered water, at 65 °C, 200V, for 30 min. Immediately after 5 min of RT-RPA, 5 µl of
products were directly mixed with 5 µl of formamide dye consisted of 100% formamide (Thermofisher) and Bromophenol blue dye (Sigma
Aldrich). Gels were then removed from cassettes, stained in 1× SybrGold (Life Technologies) for 3 min, and imaged with a Typhoon scanner
(General Electric). Ladders shown are 25–766 nt DNA (NEB, #B7025).
Lateral flow assay. A standard HybriDetect LFD strip (Milenia Biotec, MGHD 1) was inserted into the 2 mL Eppendorf tube above, arrows
pointing up/away from the mixture, with care taken not to handle the strip roughly. Note that strips are covered with a membrane that protects
the nitrocellulose and supported by a semi-rigid backing card. The strip was incubated for 2 min or longer, as desired.

Quick RNA extraction protocol (adapted from Ladha et al, doi: 10.1101/2020.05.07.20055947)
0.1. Take 5 µl of patient sample (whether VTM, water, or saliva)
0.2. Mix with 5 µl of Lucigen DNA extraction buffer
0.3. Incubate at 95 °C for 2 minutes
0.4. Take out the tube and immediately keep on ice
0.5. Use 5 µl (out of the total 10 µl per sample) for ssRPA
ssRPA protocol
Step 1: Set up and run RPA (on PRE-AMPLIFICATION BENCH)
* Please have the heat block set up before setting up reaction to ensure reaction time.
1.1. Prepare (per reaction) in the following order at room temperature:
5 µl
DNase/RNase-free water
29.5 µl
Rehydration buffer (included in TwistDX kit)
2.5 µl
10 µM forward primer
2.5 µl
10 µM reverse primer
0.5 µl
Protoscript II Reverse Transcriptase
Vortex ~ 3 seconds and spin briefly (~ 3 seconds).
If making a master mix, ensure that ~(n+1)× master mix solution is mixed for n samples to ensure that all samples get the full, correct amount
of master mix.
1.2. Add above reaction to a TwistAmp Basic reaction (dried powder included in TwistDX kit). Do not mix or pipette up and down. Then add
5 µL of RNA template directly into the tube (or water for the negative control).
1.3. Add 5 µL of 280 mM Magnesium Acetate (included in TwistDX kit) to tube lid (this way, MgOAc is kept separate in the tube lid prior to
overall mixing). Carefully close tube lid without touching the inside of the tube lid (to avoid any contamination from previous amplicons or
other sources), vortex briefly (~ 2 seconds), spin down briefly (~ 2 seconds on a micro-centrifuge), then vortex again ~ 2 seconds to start
reaction. Spin briefly (~ 2 seconds) before the next step.
1.4. Immediately, incubate it at 42 °C for 5 minutes.*
Step 2: Set up LFD (on POST-AMPLIFICATION bench)
2.1. While RPA is running, prepare (per reaction) the following in a 2 mL lo-bind tube:
1 µl
10 µM FAM probe
1 µl
10 µM protected biotin probe
64 µl
running buffer
10 µl
NEB buffer 4
Vortex and spin briefly, then to each add:
4 µl
T7 exonuclease
Vortex and spin briefly.
2.2. Add 12 µL of 10% SDS to lid of the tube. (Avoid long spin-down of 10% SDS solution, and make sure to store at room temperature
prior to this addition.) Once RPA reaction is complete, immediately vortex RPA samples for 3-5 seconds. Then add 8 µL of RPA sample to
lid and pipette up and down 25-30 times quickly and vigorously until white bubbles appear to mix RPA sample with SDS. Immediately, spin
solution down, vortex for 5 seconds, spin for 5 seconds.
2.3. Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute (for exonuclease digestion).
2.4. Place the lateral flow strip into tube, incubate for 2 minutes (but may wait up to an hour).

Figure S2: Quantification of spike-in RNA. Synthetic (IDT or Twist) and culture-derived (BEI) SARS-CoV-2 RNA
were quantified by spectrophotometry and qPCR for spike-in experiments. (a) A 76 nt, 5′ spike sequence RNA segment,
synthesized by IDT and shipped at high (~ 100 µM) concentration, was first quantified by Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher)
spectrophotometry. The machine was calibrated and “blanked” with RNA-free buffer, and absorbance at 260 nm (A260)
was recorded for IDT RNA in the same buffer in triplicate. The average value (69.3 ±0.15) was used in conjunction with
the sequence-specific extinction coefficient (756800 /M/cm) to calculate a stock concentration of 91.6 µM. This RNA was
diluted and spiked at ~ 8E2 to 8E6 copies per 5 µl into RT-qPCR reactions, with our ssRPA 5′ spike primers and
EvaGreen dye, and RT-qPCR was performed in triplicate as described in Methods. Values for Ct were recorded and a least
squares fit was made between Ct and known copy number (shown), with R2 >0.997. In separate wells of the same run, 3
dilutions of Twist synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA were amplified in an identical manner, and those Ct values were
converted to copy numbers by applying the described fit, yielding 7200 to 552,000 copies per 5 µl. This quantified Twist
sample was used in the spike-in buffer experiments of main text Fig. 1d. (b) This quantified Twist sample was then used
in a dilution series to quantify the culture-derived (BEI) RNA at very low copy, to ensure that low-copy ssRPA spike-in
experiments were accurate. As in (a), the Twist and BEI samples were both amplified by RT-qPCR, this time using
Charite “E” primer and sequence-specific probe set (IDT) for maximum accuracy at low copy number. The Twist results
were fit to the relation shown, in turn used to quantify BEI copy numbers to 44 and 7 per sample, as shown. These BEI
dilutions were used in the spike-in saliva and specificity experiments of main text Fig. 1e and 1f.

Figure S7: Clinical sample qPCR quantification. Clinical samples were received from vendor with assigned SARSCoV-2 status based in vendor qPCR. We repeated qPCR quantification in a single experiment to compare relative Ct
values across samples and to confirm RNA status. Volumes of 100 µl of each raw clinical sample were extracted and
buffer exchanged, per CDC qPCR recommendations, with the Qiagen QiaAMP viral RNA mini kit, eluting into 20 µl.
Column-extracted volumes of 5 µl each were used in 20 µl qPCR reactions with CDC N2 primers and probes and TaqPath
1-step RT-qPCR master mix, per Methods and CDC recommendations. Extracted samples were tested in triplicate when
extraction volumes allowed (“n/a” indicates volumes were insufficient). Forty-four temperature cycles were applied, and
those that did not cross the Ct threshold after 44 cycles are listed as “-”. Average Ct values are also shown and correspond
to those in main text Fig. 1g. In other experiments not shown, it appeared that small column elution (extraction) volumes
(meant to concentrate samples) led to a 5-fold or higher variation in column elution yield. Quantification Ct values shown
are therefore only accurate to ~ +/- 2 cycles. Ranges nevertheless suggest relatively high RNA concentrations for NP
swabs in VTM compared to NP swabs in water or in raw saliva.
