COVID-19 manifests with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes that are
characterized by exaggerated and misdirected host immune responses1–8. While
pathological innate immune activation is well documented in severe disease1, the
impact of autoantibodies on disease progression is less defined. Here, we used a
high-throughput autoantibody discovery technique called Rapid Extracellular
Antigen Profiling (REAP) to screen a cohort of 194 SARS-CoV-2 infected COVID-19
patients and healthcare workers for autoantibodies against 2,770 extracellular and
secreted proteins (the “exoproteome”). We found that COVID-19 patients exhibit
dramatic increases in autoantibody reactivities compared to uninfected controls,
with a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins
including cytokines, chemokines, complement components, and cell surface
proteins. We established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and
impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signaling and by altering
peripheral immune cell composition, and found that murine surrogates of these
autoantibodies exacerbate disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2
infection. Analysis of autoantibodies against tissue-associated antigens revealed
associations with specific clinical characteristics and disease severity. In summary,
these

findings

implicate

a

pathological

role

for

exoproteome-directed

autoantibodies in COVID-19 with diverse impacts on immune functionality and
associations with clinical outcomes.
Humoral immunity plays dichotomous roles in COVID-19. Although neutralizing
antibodies afford protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection9,10, growing evidence
suggests that dysregulated humoral immunity also contributes to the characteristic
immunopathology of COVID-1911–17. For example, subsets of COVID-19 patients
commonly exhibit an expansion of pathological extrafollicular B cell populations (IgD/CD27- double negative, DN) that have been associated with autoantibody production in
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients12,18. Furthermore, recent reports have
identified isolated autoantibody reactivities in COVID-19 patients, including those that are
characteristic of systemic autoimmune diseases such as antinuclear antibodies,
rheumatoid factor (anti-IgG-Fc antibodies), antiphospholipid antibodies, and antibodies

against type 1 interferons (IFN-I)15–17. Importantly, some autoantibodies, particularly
neutralizing antibodies against IFN-I, appear to directly contribute to COVID-19
pathophysiology by antagonizing innate antiviral responses11. While striking examples of
disease-modifying autoantibody responses have been described, the full breadth of
autoantibody reactivities in COVID-19 and their immunological and clinical impacts
remain undetermined at a proteome-scale. We therefore sought to identify functional
autoantibody responses in COVID-19 patients by screening for autoantibody reactivities
against the human exoproteome (the set of extracellular and secreted proteins in the
proteome).
COVID-19 patients have widespread autoantibody reactivity against extracellular
antigens
To discover functional autoantibodies that could influence COVID-19 outcomes, we used
a high-throughput autoantibody discovery method called Rapid Extracellular Antigen
Profiling (REAP; Wang et al, manuscript in preparation). REAP enables highly multiplexed
detection of antibody reactivities against a genetically-barcoded library of 2,770 human
extracellular proteins displayed on the surface of yeast. Briefly, the REAP process
involves biopanning of serum/plasma-derived patient IgG against this library, magnetic
selection of the IgG-bound clones, and sequencing of the barcodes of the isolated yeast
(Fig. 1a). REAP thus converts an antibody:antigen binding event into a quantitative
sequencing readout (“REAP Score”) based on the enrichment of each protein’s barcodes
before and after selection (see methods). To allow for detection of antibodies against
coronavirus proteins, we additionally included the receptor binding domain (RBD) of
SARS-CoV-2 and other common coronaviruses in the library (full antigen list in
Supplementary Table 1). We used REAP to screen samples from people with SARSCoV-2 infection who were prospectively followed as part of the Yale Implementing
Medical and Public Health Action Against Coronavirus CT (IMPACT) study. This cohort
includes 172 patients seen at Yale-New Haven Hospital with a range of clinical severities
and 22 healthcare workers with mild illness or asymptomatic infection. Longitudinal
samples were screened for a subset of the cohort. Patients were excluded from
subsequent analysis if they were undergoing active chemotherapy for malignancy;

disease

burden;

were

receiving

pharmacological

immunosuppression for solid organ transplant; or had received convalescent COVID-19
plasma as part of a clinical trial. IMPACT patients were next stratified according to COVID19 disease severity as reported previously1 and described briefly in Methods. As healthy
controls, we screened 30 healthcare workers who tested SARS-CoV-2-negative by RTqPCR throughout their follow-up period in the IMPACT study. We concomitantly assessed
nasopharyngeal viral RNA load, plasma cytokine/chemokine profiles through a Luminex
panel, and blood leukocyte composition by flow cytometry as previously reported1. Patient
demographics can be found in Extended Data Table 1.
To validate the performance of the REAP platform in this patient cohort, we assessed the
concordance of REAP data with known antibody reactivities. We assessed levels of
antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ELISA for 160 subject samples and
compared the results against RBD reactivity as detected by REAP. As seen in Fig. 1b,
all samples that were ELISA negative for SARS-CoV-2 RBD reactivity were also REAP
negative (score = 0), whereas 84% of samples that were ELISA positive were REAP
positive (score > 0). Additionally, 151 samples were from patients who received
tocilizumab or sarilumab (anti-IL-6R antibodies), which provided an inherent “spike-in”
experimental control to further validate REAP. Analysis of IL-6R reactivities by REAP
showed strong IL-6R reactivity in these patients compared to those that did not receive
anti-IL-6R therapy (Fig. 1c).
Next, we examined the total degree of autoreactivity stratified by COVID-19 disease
severity by quantifying the number of autoantibody reactivities at different REAP score
thresholds. Irrespective of the REAP score cutoff used, COVID-19 samples had a greater
number of reactivities compared to control samples, with the number of reactivities
positively correlating with disease severity (Fig. 1d). At score cutoffs 4, 5, and 6, there
was a clear difference between severe and moderate/mild COVID-19 samples; the
highest scoring reactivities were preferentially enriched in the severe patients (Fig. 1d,e).
Of note, there was not a statistically significant difference in days from symptom onset
(DFSO) between severe and moderate COVID-19 samples (Supplementary Fig. 1a),

suggesting that differences in autoantibody reactivities between these two groups were
not due to temporal confounding. DFSO data was not available for mild and asymptomatic
COVID-19

samples.

Compared

to

REAP

profiles

of

SLE

and

autoimmune

polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) patients, COVID-19
samples had greater numbers of reactivities compared to SLE, but fewer numbers of
reactivities compared to APECED (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Altogether, these results
suggest that broad autoreactivity toward the exoproteome is a highly prevalent feature of
COVID-19 patients.
To investigate the temporal nature of these reactivities relative to COVID-19, we
assessed REAP scores longitudinally for a subset of infected patients. Additionally, given
that these samples were collected during the primary wave of infections at our study site
from March through May, we considered the probability of re-infection in any patient an
unlikely confounder for our temporal analysis. Although definitive assignment was not
possible due to a lack of recent pre-infection baseline samples for most patients, we
inferred reactivities as likely pre-existing, newly acquired, or waning based on their REAP
score trajectories plotted against reported days from symptom onset (Supplementary
Fig. 2). For example, approximately 50% of REAP reactivities with a score of 3 or above
were present within 10 days from symptom onset, suggesting that they were likely preexisting (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Around 10% of longitudinal REAP reactivities started
with a score of 0 and had an increase in score of at least 1 at a later time point, indicating
they were newly acquired post-infection (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Finally, approximately
15% of longitudinal REAP reactivities started with a score of 3 and had a decrease in
score of at least 1 at a later time point, which suggests waning antibody titers
(Supplementary Fig. 2c). Representative plots of these reactivities are depicted in
Supplementary Fig. 2d-l.
In order to further explore potential cellular sources of the elevated autoantibody
reactivities in COVID-19 patients, we examined B cell phenotypes in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) matching the REAP plasma samples. Similar to previous
reports, we find that extrafollicular DN B cells are expanded in moderate and severe

COVID-19 patients compared to uninfected controls (Fig. 1i).
Autoantibodies in COVID-19 patients target a wide range of immune-related
proteins
Having established that COVID-19 patients have increased autoantibody reactivities
against extracellular antigens, we sought to specifically investigate autoantibodies that
could impact immune responses (immune-targeting autoantibodies). To this end, we
evaluated a group of immunomodulatory antigens with significant differences in REAP
scores between symptomatic and negative cohorts and grouped these antigens by their
known immunological function and/or association with specific cell types (Fig. 1f). We
found that autoantibodies in COVID-19 patients targeted proteins involved in diverse
immunological functions such as acute phase response, type II immunity, leukocyte
trafficking,

interferon

responses,

and

lymphocyte

function/activation.

Cytokine

autoantibody targets included type 1 interferons, IL-1α/β, IL-6, GM-CSF (CSF2), IL-18Rβ
(IL18RAP), and Leptin (LEP). Chemokine autoantibody targets included CXCL1, CXCL7
(PPBP), CCL2, CCL15, CCL16, and the chemokine decoy receptor ACKR1 (Duffy blood
group antigen). Immunomodulatory cell surface autoantibody targets included NKG2D
ligands (RAET1E/L, ULBP1/2), NK cell receptors NKG2A/C/E (KLRC1/2/3), B cell
expressed proteins (CD38, FCMR, FCRL3, CXCR5), T cell expressed proteins (CD3E,
CXCR3, CCR4), and myeloid expressed proteins (CCR2, CD300E). Stratifying samples
by disease severity, we found that immune-targeting autoantibodies were elevated in
COVID-19 patients compared to controls and that the fraction of samples with these
reactivities increased with worsening disease severity (Fig. 1g,h). Using ELISA, we
orthogonally validated a subset of 16 autoantibodies that target cytokines, chemokines,
growth factors, complement factors, and cell surface proteins (Supplementary Fig. 3).
These results demonstrate that COVID-19 patients possess autoantibodies that may
impact a wide range of immunological functions.
Autoantibodies targeting cytokines/chemokines are associated with distinct
virological and immunological characteristics in COVID-19
We hypothesized that the presence of autoantibodies in patients influences the circulating

concentrations of their autoantigen targets. We therefore compared the plasma
concentrations of cytokines and chemokines measured by Luminex in patients who
possessed or lacked autoantibodies against these targets. In some cases, autoantibodies
were associated with apparent increases in their autoantigen targets (e.g., CCL15,
CXCL1, IFN-α2, IL-13; Supplementary Fig. 4b,f,j,m), whereas in other cases they
correlated with apparent decreases (e.g., IL-1A, IL-1B; Supplementary Fig. 4k,l). This is
consistent with the ability of antibodies to both neutralize, but also paradoxically to
pharmacokinetically stabilize their targets by preventing renal clearance and/or receptormediated endocytosis19. A caveat to these findings is that autoantibodies can variably
interfere with antibody-based detection methods such as the Luminex assay or ELISA,
for instance, by blocking antigen capture or detection with secondary reagents. This may
explain the apparent discrepancy between our results showing increased circulating IFNα2 concentrations (though not IFN activity) in antibody-positive patients compared to the
findings of Bastard et al.11 that used a different assay and found decreased apparent
concentrations. Nevertheless, these results provide orthogonal clinical validation that the
presence of autoantibodies affected circulating levels of their targets in patients.
To more directly assess potential immunomodulatory effects of cytokine/chemokine
targeting autoantibodies in COVID-19 patients, we assessed the in vitro activity of
autoantibodies that were identified in our screen and validated by ELISA (Supplementary
Fig. 3a,b). In a GM-CSF signaling assay based on evaluation of STAT5 phosphorylation
in TF-1 cells, we found that purified IgG from a patient with anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies
neutralized GM-CSF signaling while purified IgG from uninfected control patients did not
(Fig. 2a). Similarly, we assayed chemokine receptor activity using the PRESTO-Tango
system20 and found that serum-purified IgG from a patient with anti-CXCL7
autoantibodies and a patient with anti-CXCL1 autoantibodies neutralized CXCL7 and
CXCL1 signaling on their shared receptor CXCR2, whereas serum-purified IgG from
control patients did not (Fig. 2b,c). Thus, these results demonstrate that immunetargeting autoantibodies in COVID-19 patients can directly neutralize the activity of
cytokines/chemokines and perturb immune function in affected COVID-19 patients.

To investigate the potential virological effects of cytokine/chemokine targeting
autoantibodies, we examined a subset of COVID-19 patients with anti-IFN-I
autoantibodies. Confirming a recent report from Bastard et al.11, we identified anti-IFN-I
autoantibodies in 5.2% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and additionally found that
these autoantibodies were enriched in patients with severe disease (Fig. 1f, 2d). While
anti-IFN-I autoantibodies from COVID-19 patients were previously demonstrated to
neutralize IFN-α activity in vitro, their effect on virological control in infected patients has
not been determined11. We therefore assessed the functional impact of these
autoantibodies in patients by comparing composite viral loads (average of
nasopharyngeal and saliva samples) from patients who had anti-IFN-α autoantibodies to
those who did not have such antibodies during the course of disease (Fig. 2e). After
matching patient groups for comparable average age, sex, and disease severity (average
age in anti-IFN-I cohort was 70.25 vs. 71.67 in control; sex distribution was 63% male vs.
67% in control; average disease severity was 3.89 vs. 4.00 in control), patients who had
anti-IFN-I antibodies demonstrated impaired virological clearance throughout the course
of the study, while patients without anti-IFN-I autoantibodies were able to reduce
composite viral loads over time. These results indicate that anti-IFN-I autoantibodies
impair the ability to control viral replication in COVID-19 patients.
Autoantibodies targeting immune cell surface proteins are associated with specific
changes in blood leukocyte composition
In addition to their effects on secreted proteins, autoantibodies can also perturb immune
responses by binding to targets expressed on the surface of immune cells and triggering
opsonization, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and/or complement-dependent
cytotoxicity21. To investigate the effects of autoantibodies against immune cell surface
proteins in COVID-19, we looked for associations between these autoantibody reactivities
and patient blood leukocyte composition. We found that patients with autoantibodies
against antigens expressed on B cells (CD38, FcμR, and FcRL3) had significantly lower
frequencies of circulating B-cells when compared to both severity-matched patients
without these autoantibodies and control healthcare workers (Fig. 2f). Furthermore,
patients with these autoantibodies had significantly lower levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD

IgM when compared to severity-matched patients without these autoantibodies (Fig. 2g).
We further examined the patient with anti-CD38 autoantibodies and found that they also
exhibited a lower frequency of NK cells, activated CD4+ T cells, and activated CD8+ T
cells, all of which also express CD38 (Supplementary Fig. 5a-f). With respect to
monocytes, we identified five autoantibody targets (CCR2, CCRL2, FFAR4, SYND4, and
CPAMD8) that were preferentially expressed on classical and intermediate monocytes in
a publicly available RNA-seq dataset of human blood leukocytes22. We found that patients
with these autoantibodies had significantly lower frequencies of classical and intermediate
monocytes as well as increased frequencies of nonclassical monocytes when compared
to severity-matched patients without these autoantibodies (Fig. 2h-k). Finally, we found
one patient with autoantibodies against CD3E (a component of the T cell receptor
complex) who had intact B and NK cell compartments but dramatically reduced levels of
CD4 T cells, CD8+ T cells, and NKT cells in the blood (Supplementary Fig. 5g-k). In
aggregate, these data show that autoantibodies that target immune cell surface proteins
are associated with depletion of particular immune cell populations and may negatively
impact the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Immune-targeting autoantibodies exacerbate disease severity in a mouse model of
SARS-CoV-2 infection
To assess the impact of cytokine-targeting autoantibodies in COVID-19 pathogenesis in
vivo, we used a naturally susceptible mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in which
mice transgenically express human ACE2 under the human keratin 18 (KRT18) promoter
(K18-hACE2)23. SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 mice results in robust viral
replication and pulmonary inflammation that recapitulate aspects of COVID-19
pathogenesis in human patients24,25. Given that anti-IFN-I autoantibodies are enriched in
severe COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2d), we first administered neutralizing antibodies against
the interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR) in K18-hACE2 mice to examine the impact of
antibody-mediated IFN-I blockade in vivo. We found that mice pre-treated with anti-IFNAR
antibodies were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicated by increased
weight loss (Fig. 3a) and reduced survival (Fig. 3b). Additionally, in mice treated with
anti-IFNAR antibodies, monocyte recruitment, maturation, and differentiation into

proinflammatory macrophages in the lung were severely impaired (consistent with the
known effect of IFN-I deficiency26,27; Fig. 3c-e). Furthermore, we found marked increases
in the relative frequency (Fig. 3f) and absolute number (Fig. 3g) of activated lymphoid
cells, including CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and γδ T cells, co-expressing CD44
and CD69 from PBS-treated SARS-CoV-2 infected mice. In contrast, lymphoid cells failed
to upregulate activation markers in mice treated with anti-IFNAR antibodies (Fig. 3f,g).
Collectively, our findings demonstrate that early blockade of IFN-I signaling by antibodies
(mimicking the effect of pre-existing anti-IFN-I in patients) interferes with myeloid and
lymphoid activation in a murine model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and results in severely
exacerbated disease.
In addition to anti-IFN-I autoantibodies, we identified autoantibodies against the
interleukin-18 (IL-18) pathway, particularly against the IL-18 receptor subunit, IL-18Rβ
(IL18RAP) (Supplementary Fig. 3d). IL-18Rβ serves as a component of the
heterodimeric IL-18 receptor (which also contains IL-18Rα), which is a proinflammatory
cytokine critical for antiviral NK and CD8+ T cell responses28,29. To examine the impact of
IL-18 pathway disruption in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we administered anti-IL-18 antibodies
to K18-hACE2 mice immediately prior to infection. We found that IL-18 blockade greatly
enhanced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection; anti-IL-18-treated mice rapidly lost
weight and universally succumbed to the infection, whereas 40% of PBS-treated mice
survived (Fig. 3h,i). To better understand the mechanisms underlying susceptibility
associated with IL-18 blockade, we first measured viral RNA loads in the lung 4 days
post-infection. Compared to PBS treatment control, we found that IL-18 blockade resulted
in significantly higher viral burden measured by levels of either the N (CDC N1 and CDC
N2) or E (Berlin E) gene, suggesting IL-18 is critical for controlling viral replication (Fig.
3j). Additionally, given the critical role of IL-18 in inducing the effector properties of NK
cells30, we measured the expression of various surface markers on NK cells in PBS or
anti-IL-18 treated mice. We found that the relative frequency (Fig. 3k) and absolute
number (Fig. 3l) of NK cells expressing CD11b+ or KLRG1+, which mark the effector
subsets with enhanced cytotoxic properties, were significantly reduced in mice treated
with anti-IL-18 compared to PBS treated controls. Together, these data demonstrated that

antibodies neutralizing the IL-18 pathway resulted in severe impairment in early antiviral
control and NK cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice.
Autoantibodies targeting tissue-associated antigens correlate with disease
severity and clinical characteristics in COVID-19 patients
In addition to immune-targeting autoantibodies, we also observed a high prevalence of
tissue-associated autoantibodies in COVID-19 patients. To understand if these antibodies
correlated with particular clinical phenotypes, we manually curated a list of tissue
associated antigens with significant differences in REAP signals between uninfected
controls and symptomatic patients, and generated a heatmap organized by COVID-19
disease severity (Fig. 4a). Broadly, we found a high frequency of autoantibodies directed
against the CNS compartment (e.g., orexin receptor HCRT2R, metabotropic glutamate
receptor GRM5, neuronal injury marker NINJ1); against vascular cell types (e.g.,
endothelial adhesion molecule PLVAP, regulator of angiogenesis RSPO3); and against
connective tissue and extracellular matrix targets (e.g., suspected regulator of cartilage
maintenance OTOR, matrix metalloproteinases MMP7 and MMP9), as well as various
other tissue-associated antigens. We next determined whether these tissue-associated
antigens had enhanced correlations in severe COVID-19 patients by comparing levels of
common clinical laboratory values against REAP scores and generated a difference
matrix of Pearson’s r correlation values (moderate correlations subtracted from severe)
(Fig. 4b). Several tissue groups (e.g., CNS, Cardiac / Hepatic, Epithelial, Ion Channels)
had enhanced correlations with inflammatory clinical markers such as ferritin, C-reactive
protein (CRP), and lactate in severe patients relative to moderate COVID-19 cases, high
levels of which have been linked to worse COVID-19 disease prognosis31,32.
To systematically identify the greatest changes in autoantibody-clinical variable pairwise
correlations, we first stratified antigen-clinical variable pairs into groupings based on
positive or negative delta Pearson’s r between moderate and severe COVID-19 patients.
We next identified the top-ranked pairings with the greatest changes in correlations
between moderate and severe disease states (dashed red line), and found large,
significant changes in the correlations for NXPH1, DCD, SLC2A10, and LRRC8D

autoreactivity and various inflammatory markers (Fig. 4c). We also identified significant
changes in the negative correlations for REAP reactivity against the Ectodysplasin A2
receptor (EDA2R), a protein with enhanced expression on type 1 alveolar cells, with
oxygen saturation (SpO2), suggesting that increasing levels of autoantibodies against this
target correlates with decreasing oxygen levels in affected patients (Fig. 4d). Given the
extent of CNS-specific autoantigens identified in our REAP screen, and recent reports of
the potential for SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion33,34, we additionally examined whether any
autoantibodies correlated with individual patient’s Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores.
Intriguingly, we found that eight unique COVID-19 patients developed autoantibodies
against HCRTR2, an orexin receptor enriched in the hypothalamus. We noted a marked
negative correlation between levels of HCRTR2 autoantibodies in these patients and their
exceptionally low GCS scores encompassing the time of sample collection (Fig. 4e). An
additional negative correlation between GRM5 autoreactivity and GCS was found in one
of these patients, who eventually succumbed to their infection (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Discussion
The surprising extent of autoantibody reactivities seen in patients with COVID-19
suggests humoral immunopathology is an intrinsic aspect of disease pathogenesis.
Screening patient samples with the REAP platform, we identified and validated numerous
protein targets involved in a wide range of immunological functions. These autoantibodies
had potent functional activities and could be directly correlated with various virological,
immunological, and clinical parameters in vivo within COVID-19 patient samples.
Furthermore, murine surrogates of these autoantibodies led to increased disease severity
in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Altogether, these results provide additional
evidence that autoantibodies are capable of altering the course of COVID-19 by
perturbing the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and causing direct tissue injury.
Although COVID-19 patients demonstrated high autoreactivity against the exoproteome
at a global level, there were essentially no “COVID-19 specific” autoantibodies that
distinguished COVID-19 patients from uninfected controls. Similarly, we did not find public
responses that could extensively partition patients into specific COVID-19 phenotypes or

outcomes. Rather, we observed an extensive constellation of uncommon (e.g., 5-10%
prevalence; anti-IFN-I) and rare (e.g., <1-5% prevalence; anti-CD38, anti-IL-18Rβ, antiCD3E) reactivities with large apparent effect sizes. In other words, relatively private
reactivities are common in COVID-19, and the aggregate sum of these multifarious
responses may explain a significant portion of the clinical variation in patients. It is also
intriguing to consider whether the extent of observed autoantibody formation across
clinical phenotypes and the absolute breadth of potential targets represents a
fundamental defect in tolerance mechanisms as a result of the rapid and exaggerated
inflammatory profile attributed to COVID-19. Conversely, patients with pre-existing
autoantibodies may be at heightened risk of severe disease due to autoantibodymediated deficiencies in immune responses during early SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis
of longitudinal REAP scores within our cohort suggests the existence of both pre-existing
autoantibodies, as well as a broad subset of autoantibodies that were induced following
infection, indicating that both paradigms may drive the heterogeneity of COVID-19 clinical
presentations.
The diversity of autoantibody responses in COVID-19 patients also underscores the
importance of high-throughput and unbiased proteome-scale surveys for autoantibody
targets. By perturbing biological pathways, autoantibody reactivities are somewhat
analogous to genetic mutations35 and can uncover unexpected pathways in disease
pathophysiology. For instance, beyond validating the biologically-compelling example of
anti-IFN-I antibodies in COVID-19, our studies implicated numerous other immune
pathways targeted by autoantibodies in COVID-19 that were not previously associated
with the disease. In addition to immune-targeting autoantibodies, we also detected
antibodies against various tissue-associated antigens. These autoantibodies were
correlated with inflammatory clinical markers like ferritin, CRP, and lactate in COVID-19
patients, and these correlations became more extreme with worsening disease
progression. Intriguingly, many tissue autoantibodies were present across the diverse
physiological compartments frequently implicated during post-COVID syndrome (PCS).
Whether the specific autoantibodies identified here play a role in the establishment of
PCS, and whether they persist beyond the acute phase of COVID-19, deserves further

investigation given the persistent and growing affected patient population.
In summary, our analyses delineated an expansive autoantibody landscape in COVID-19
patients and identified distinct autoantibodies that exerted striking immunological and
clinical outcomes. These results implicate previously underappreciated immunological
pathways in the etiology of COVID-19 and suggest novel therapeutic paradigms centered
around modulating these pathways, as well as attenuating the autoantibodies themselves.
Finally, our findings provide a strong rationale for a wider investigation of autoantibodies
in infectious disease pathogenesis.

Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
This study was approved by Yale Human Research Protection Program Institutional
Review Boards (FWA00002571, protocol ID 2000027690). Informed consent was
obtained from all enrolled patients and healthcare workers.
Patients
As previously described1 and reproduced here for accessibility, 197 patients admitted to
YNHH with COVID-19 between 18 March 2020 and 5 May 2020 were included in this
study. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Nasopharyngeal
and saliva samples were collected as described36, approximately every four days, for
SARS-CoV-2 RT–qPCR analysis where clinically feasible. Paired whole blood for flow
cytometry analysis was collected simultaneously in sodium heparin-coated vacutainers
and kept on gentle agitation until processing. All blood was processed on the day of
collection. Patients were scored for COVID-19 disease severity through review of
electronic medical records (EMR) at each longitudinal time point. Scores were assigned
by a clinical infectious disease physician according to a custom-developed disease
severity scale. Moderate disease status (clinical score 1–3) was defined as: SARS-CoV2 infection requiring hospitalization without supplementary oxygen (1); infection requiring
non-invasive supplementary oxygen (<3 l/min to maintain SpO2 >92%) (2); and infection
requiring non-invasive supplementary oxygen (>3 l/min to maintain SpO2 >92%, or >2
l/min to maintain SpO2 >92% and had a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) >70)
and received tocilizumab). Severe disease status (clinical score 4 or 5) was defined as
infection meeting all criteria for clinical score 3 and also requiring admission to the ICU
and >6 l/min supplementary oxygen to maintain SpO2 >92% (4); or infection requiring
invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in
addition to glucocorticoid or vasopressor administration (5). Clinical score 6 was assigned
for deceased patients. For all patients, days from symptom onset were estimated as
follows: (1) highest priority was given to explicit onset dates provided by patients; (2) next
highest priority was given to the earliest reported symptom by a patient; and (3) in the
absence of direct information regarding symptom onset, we estimated a date through

manual assessment of the electronic medical record (EMRs) by an independent clinician.
Demographic information was aggregated through a systematic and retrospective review
of patient EMRs and was used to construct Extended Data Table 1. The clinical data
were collected using EPIC EHR and REDCap 9.3.6 software. At the time of sample
acquisition and processing, investigators were unaware of the patients’ conditions. Blood
acquisition was performed and recorded by a separate team. Information about patients’
conditions was not available until after processing and analysis of raw data by flow
cytometry and ELISA. A clinical team, separate from the experimental team, performed
chart reviews to determine relevant statistics. Cytokines and FACS analyses were
performed blinded. Patients’ clinical information and clinical score coding were revealed
only after data collection.
Clinical Data Acquisition
Clinical data for patients and healthcare workers were extracted from the Yale-New
Haven Health computational health platform37,38 in the Observational Medical Outcomes
Partnership (OMOP) data model. For each research specimen, summary statistics
including minimum, mean, median, and maximum values were obtained for relevant
clinical measurements, including the Glasgow Coma Scale, within ±1 day from the time
of biospecimen collection. Disease severity endpoints, including admission, supplemental
oxygen use, and invasive ventilation were validated as previously described39.

Mice
B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J (K18-hACE2) mice were purchased from the Jackson
Laboratories and were subsequently bred and housed at Yale University. 5- to 10-weekold mixed sex mice were used throughout the study. All procedures used in this study
(sex-matched, age-matched) complied with federal guidelines and the institutional
policies of the Yale School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee.
Isolation of plasma
Plasma samples were collected as previously described1. Briefly, plasma samples were
first isolated from whole blood by centrifugation at 400 g for 10 min at room temperature
(RT) without brake. The undiluted plasma was then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C for
subsequent analysis.
Isolation of PBMCs
PBMCs were collected as previously described1. Briefly, PBMCs were isolated from
whole blood by Histopaque (Sigma-Aldrich) density gradient centrifugation. After isolation
of plasma, blood was diluted twofold with PBS, layered over Histopaque in a SepMate
(StemCell Technologies) tube, underwent centrifugation for 10 min at 1,200 g, and further
processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After PBMC isolation, cells were
washed twice with PBS to remove residual Histopaque, treated with ACK Lysing Buffer
(ThermoFisher) for 2 min, and then counted. Cell concentration and viability were
estimated using standard Trypan blue staining and an automated cell counter (ThermoFisher).
Yeast Induction
All yeast were induced as previously described (Wang et al, manuscript in preparation).
In short, one day prior to induction, yeast were expanded in synthetic dextrose medium
lacking uracil (SDO -Ura) at 30 °C. The following day, yeast were induced by
resuspension at an optical density of 1 in synthetic galactose medium lacking uracil (SGO
-Ura) supplemented with 10% SDO - Ura and culturing at 30 °C for approximately 18
hours.

Yeast Library Construction
The yeast exoproteome library was constructed as previously described (Wang et al,
manuscript in preparation). In this study the library was further expanded with the Nterminal extracellular domains of 171 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as well as
the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV,
HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E coronaviruses. Exact sequences of all
proteins in the library are provided in Supplementary Table 1. Proteins were displayed
on yeast as previously described (Wang et al, manuscript in preparation). In short, A twostep PCR process was used to amplify cDNAs for cloning into a barcoded yeast-display
vector. cDNA for GPCR N-terminal extracellular domains was derived from the from the
PRESTO-Tango plasmid kit, a gift from Bryan Roth (Addgene kit # 1000000068). cDNA
for coronavirus RBDs was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. First, cDNAs
were amplified with gene-specific primers and PCR products were purified using magnetic
PCR purification beads (Avan Bio). Second, the 15bp barcode fragment was constructed
by overlap PCR. 4 primers (bc1, bc2, bc3, bc4) were mixed in equimolar ratios and used
as a template for a PCR reaction. This PCR product was purified using magnetic PCR
purification beads (Avan Bio), reamplified with the first and fourth primer, and then PCR
products were run on 2% agarose gels and purified by gel extraction. Purified barcode
and gene products were combined with linearized yeast-display vector (pDD003 digested
with EcoRI and BamHI) and electroporated into JAR300 yeast using a 96-well
electroporator (BTX Harvard Apparatus). Yeast were immediately recovered into 1 mL
liquid synthetic dextrose medium lacking uracil (SDO -Ura) in 96-well deep well blocks
and grown overnight at 30°C. For coronavirus RBDs, yeast were plated on SDO -Ura
agar, single colonies were isolated, and sanger sequencing was used to confirm correct
cDNA insertion and identify the associated barcodes. For GPCR N-terminal extracellular
domains, these yeast were pooled together with transfected yeast that were used to
construct the previously described exoproteome library and a limited dilution of clones
were sub-sampled, induced, and stained for FLAG using 1:100 anti-FLAG PE antibody
(BioLegend). Yeast were sorted for FLAG display on a Sony SH800Z cell sorter. Barcodegene pairing for these yeast were performed using a custom Tn5-based sequencing
approach as previously described (Wang et al, manuscript in preparation). 4-5 yeast

clones for each coronavirus RBD were then spiked into the newly constructed yeast
library. All primers used were previously described in Wang et al.
Rapid Extracellular Antigen Profiling (REAP)
IgG antibody isolation for REAP was performed as previously described (Wang et al,
manuscript in preparation). In short, Triton X-100 and RNase A were added to plasma
samples at final concentrations of 0.5% and 0.5 mg mL−1 respectively and incubated at
RT for 30 min before use to reduce risk from any potential virus in plasma. 20 μL protein
G magnetic resin (Lytic Solutions) was washed with sterile PBS, resuspended in 75 μL
sterile PBS, and added to 25 μL plasma. plasma-resin mixture was incubated overnight
at 4 °C with shaking. Resin was washed with sterile PBS, resuspended in 90 µL 100 mM
glycine pH 2.7, and incubated for five min at RT. Supernatant was extracted and added
to 10 µL sterile 1M Tris pH 8.0. At this point, IgG concentration was measured using a
NanoDrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). This mixture was added
to 108 induced empty vector (pDD003) yeast and incubated for 3 hours at 4 °C with
shaking. Yeast-IgG mixtures were placed into 96 well 0.45 um filter plates (Thomas
Scientific) and yeast-depleted IgG was eluted into sterile 96 well plates by centrifugation
at 3000 g for 3 min.
Yeast library selection for REAP was performed as previously described (Wang et al,
manuscript in preparation). In short, 400 µL of the induced yeast library was set aside to
allow for comparison to post-selection libraries. 108 induced yeast were added to wells of
a sterile 96-well v-bottom microtiter plate, resuspended in 100 µL PBE (PBS with 0.5%
BSA and 0.5 mM EDTA) containing 10 µg patient-derived antibody, and incubated with
shaking for 1 hour at 4 °C. Yeast were washed twice with PBE, resuspended in 100 µL
PBE with a 1:100 dilution of biotin anti-human IgG Fc antibody (clone HP6017,
BioLegend), and incubated with shaking for 1 hour at 4 °C. Yeast were washed twice with
PBE, resuspended in 100 µL PBE with a 1:20 dilution of Streptavidin MicroBeads (Miltenyi
Biotec), and incubated with shaking for 30 min at 4 °C. All following steps were carried
out at RT. Multi-96 Columns (Miltenyi Biotec) were placed into a MultiMACS M96
Separator (Miltenyi Biotec) in positive selection mode and the columns were equilibrated

with 70% ethanol and degassed PBE. Yeast were resuspended in 200 µL degassed PBE
and placed into the columns. The columns were washed three times with degassed PBE.
To elute the selected yeast, columns were removed from the separator and placed over
96-well deep well plates. 700 µL degassed PBE was added to each well of the column
and the column and deep well plate were centrifuged briefly. This process was repeated
3 times. Yeast were recovered in 1 mL SDO -Ura at 30 °C.
DNA was extracted from yeast libraries using Zymoprep-96 Yeast Plasmid Miniprep kits
or Zymoprep Yeast Plasmid Miniprep II kits (Zymo Research) according to standard
manufacturer protocols. A first round of PCR was used to amplify a DNA sequence
containing the protein display barcode on the yeast plasmid. PCR reactions were
conducted using 1 µL plasmid DNA, 159_DIF2 and 159_DIR2 primers, and the following
PCR settings: 98 °C denaturation, 58 °C annealing, 72 °C extension, 25 rounds of
amplification. A second round of PCR was conducted using 1 µL first round PCR product,
Nextera i5 and i7 dual-index library primers (Illumina) along with dual-index primers
containing custom indices, and the following PCR settings: 98 °C denaturation, 58 °C
annealing, 72 °C extension, 25 rounds of amplification. PCR products were pooled and
run on a 1% agarose gel. The band corresponding to 257 base pairs was cut out and
DNA (NGS library) was extracted using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according
to standard manufacturer protocols. NGS library was sequenced using an Illumina
NextSeq 500 and NextSeq 500/550 75 cycle High Output Kit v2.5 with 75 base pair singleend sequencing according to standard manufacturer protocols.
Recombinant protein production
Recombinant GM-CSF and IL-6 were produced as previously described (Wang et al,
manuscript in preparation). In short, sequences encoding the proteins were cloned into a
secreted protein expression vector. Expi293 cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were
transfected and maintained according to manufacturer protocols. 4 days post-transfection,

Recombinant IL-18Rβ was produced as follows. The human IL-18Rβ ectodomain (amino
acids 15–356) was cloned into the pACBN_BH3 vector with an N-terminal GP64 signal
peptide and a C-terminal AviTag and hexahistidine tag. Plasmids were co-transfected
with a transfer vector (Expression Systems, 91002) into Sf9 cells using a baculovirus
cotransfection kit (Expression Systems, 91200) per manufacturer’s instructions. P0 virus
was harvested after 4-5 days and used for generation of P1/P2 virus stock. For protein
production, Hi-5 cells were infected with P2 virus at a previously optimized titer and
harvested 3–5 days after infection. Proteins were captured from cell supernatant via NiNTA chelating resin and further purified by size exclusion chromatography using an
ENrich SEC 650 10 x 300 Column (Bio-Rad) into a final buffer of HEPES buffered saline.
Autoantibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measurement
200 ng of purchased or independently produced recombinant protein in 100 µL of PBS
pH 7.0 was added to 96-well flat-bottom Immulon 2HB plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and placed at 4 °C overnight. Plates were washed once with 225 µL ELISA wash buffer
(PBS + 0.05% Tween 20) and 150 µL ELISA blocking buffer (PBS + 2% Human Serum
Albumin) was added to the well. Plates were incubated for 2 hours at RT. ELISA blocking
buffer was removed from the wells and appropriate dilutions of sample plasma in 100 µL
ELISA blocking buffer were added to each well. Plates were incubated for 2 hours at RT.
Plates were washed 6 times with 225 µL ELISA wash buffer and 1:5000 goat anti-human
IgG HRP (Millipore Sigma) or anti-human IgG isotype-specific HRP (Southern Biotech;
IgG1: clone HP6001, IgG2: clone 31-7-4, IgG3: clone HP6050, IgG4: clone HP6025) in
100 µL ELISA blocking buffer was added to the wells. Plates were incubated for 1 hour
at RT. Plates were washed 6 times with 225 µL ELISA wash buffer. 50 µL TMB substrate
(BD Biosciences) was added to the wells and plates were incubated for 20-30 min in the
dark at RT. 50 µL 1 M sulfuric acid was added to the wells and absorbance at 450 nm
was measured in a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek). Proteins used

RT for 30 min to inactivate potentially infectious viruses. Meanwhile, recombinant SARSCoV-2 S1 protein (ACRO Biosystems, S1N-C52H3) or recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD
protein (ACRO Biosystems, SPD-C82E9) was used to coat 96-well MaxiSorp plates
(Thermo Scientific) at a concentration of 2 μg mL−1 in PBS in 50 μL per well, followed by
overnight incubation at 4 °C. The coating buffer was removed, and plates were incubated
for 1 h at RT with 200 μL of blocking solution (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and 3% milk
powder). Plasma was diluted 1:50 in dilution solution (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and 1%
milk powder) and 100 μL of diluted serum was added for two hours at RT. Plates were
washed three times with PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) and 50 μL of HRP anti-Human
IgG Antibody at 1:5000 dilution (GenScript) or anti-Human IgM-Peroxidase Antibody at
1:5000 dilution (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in dilution solution were added to each well. After
1 h of incubation at RT, plates were washed six times with PBS-T. Plates were developed
with 100 μL of TMB Substrate Reagent Set (BD Biosciences 555214) and the reaction
was stopped after 12 min by the addition of 100 μL of 2 N sulfuric acid. Plates were then
read at a wavelength of 450 nm and 570 nm. The cut-off values for sero-positivity were
determined as 0.392, 0.436, and 0.341 for anti-S1-IgG, anti-S1 IgM, and anti-RBD IgG,
respectively. 80 and 69 pre-pandemic plasma samples were assayed to establish the
negative baselines for the S1 and RBD antigens, respectively. These values were
statistically determined with a confidence level of 99%.
Functional Validation of GM-CSF Autoantibodies
TF-1 cells were starved of recombinant GM-CSF (PreproTech, 300-03) eighteen hours
prior to experiments. GM-CSF at 200 pg/mL was incubated with dilutions of purified IgG

for 15 min at RT and then used to stimulate TF-1 cells in a 96-well plate (2 × 105 cells per
well) in a final volume of 100 µL (final concentration of 100 pg/mL). IgG was purified from
plasma using protein G magnetic beads (Lytic Solutions) as previously described (Wang
et al, manuscript in preparation). After 15 min of stimulation, cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 30 mins, washed with PBS, and permeabilized in 100% methanol
on ice for 45 mins. Cells were then washed twice with PBE and stained with PEconjugated anti-STAT5 pY694 (1:50) (BD Biosciences, 422302) and human TruStain FcX
(1:100) (Biolegend, 422302) for 1 hour at RT. Cells were washed with PBE and acquired
on a SONY SA3800 flow cytometer. Data were analysed using FlowJo software version
10.6 software (Tree Star). pSTAT5 signal was measured as a function of mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI). Percent max signal was calculated by subtracting
background MFI and calculating values as a percentage of GM-CSF induced pSTAT5
MFI in the absence of IgG.
Functional Validation of CXCL1 and CXCL7 Autoantibodies
HTLA cells, a HEK293-derived cell line that stably expresses β-arrestin-TEV and tTALuciferase, were seeded in wells of a sterile tissue culture grade flat bottom 96-well plate
(35,000 cells/well) in 100 μL DMEM (+ 10% FBS, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin). 18-24 hr
after seeding (approximately 80-90% cell confluence), 200 ng CXCR2-Tango plasmid in
20 μL DMEM and 600 ng Polyethylenimine-Max (Polysciences, 24765-1) in 20 μL DMEM
were mixed, incubated at RT for 20 min, and added to each well. 18-24 hr after
transfection, medium was replaced with 100 μL DMEM (+ 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, 10
mM HEPES) containing 10 ng CXCL7 (Peprotech, 300-14) or CXCL1 (PeproTech, 30046) and 5 ug isolated IgG. IgG was purified from plasma using protein G magnetic beads
(Lytic Solutions) as previously described (Wang et al, manuscript in preparation). 18-24
hr after stimulation, supernatant was replaced with 50 μL Bright-Glo solution (Promega)
diluted 20-fold with PBS with 20 mM HEPES. The plate was incubated at RT for 20 min
in the dark and luminescence was quantified using a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Microplate
Reader (BioTek). HTLA cells were a gift from Noah Palm. CXCR2-Tango was a gift from
Bryan Roth (Addgene plasmid # 66260)

SARS-CoV-2 mouse infections
Before infection, mice were anesthetized using 30% (vol/vol) isoflurane diluted in
propylene glycol. 50 µL of SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281; BEI
Resources) at 2 × 104 or 2 × 105 PFU/mL was delivered intranasally to mice, equivalent
of 103 or 104 PFU/mouse, respectively. Following infection, weight loss and survival were
monitored daily.
Viral RNA measurements from human nasopharyngeal samples
RNA concentrations were measured from human nasopharyngeal samples by RT–qPCR
as previously described36. Briefly, total nucleic acid was extracted from 300 μL of viral
transport medium (nasopharyngeal swab) using the MagMAX Viral/Pathogen Nucleic
Acid Isolation kit (ThermoFisher) and eluted into 75 μL elution buffer. For SARS-CoV-2
RNA detection, 5 μL of RNA template was tested as previously described41, using the US
CDC real-time RT–PCR primer/probe sets 2019-nCoV_N1 and 2019-nCoV_N2, as well
as the human RNase P (RP) as an extraction control. Virus RNA copies were quantified
using a tenfold dilution standard curve of RNA transcripts that we previously generated.
If the RNA concentration was lower than the limit of detection (ND) that was determined
previously, the value was set to 0 and used for the analyses.
Viral RNA measurements from mouse lung tissues
Viral RNA from mouse lung tissues was measured as previously described26. Briefly, at
indicated time points, mice were euthanized with 100% isoflurane. The medial, inferior,
and postcaval lobe from the right lung were placed in a Lysing Matrix D tube (MP
Biomedicals) with 1 mL of PBS, and homogenized using a table-top homogenizer at
medium speed for 2 min. After homogenization, 250 μL of the lung mixture was added to
750 μL Trizol LS (Invitrogen), and RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were quantified
with 250 ng of RNA inputs using the Luna Universal Probe Onestep RT-qPCR Kit (New
England Biolabs), using real-time RT-PCR primer/probe sets 2019-nCoV_N1 and 2019nCoV_N2 from the US CDC as well as the primer/probe set E-Sarbeco from the Charité
Institute of Virology, Universitätsmedizin Berlin.

Cytokine and chemokine measurements
Cytokine and chemokine levels from plasma samples were measured as previously
described1. Briefly, patient serum was isolated as before and aliquots were stored at
−80 °C. Sera were shipped to Eve Technologies (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) on dry ice,
and levels of cytokines and chemokines were measured using the Human Cytokine
Array/Chemokine Array 71-403 Plex Panel (HD71). All samples were measured upon the
first thaw.
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry on human PBMCs was performed as previously described1. Briefly,
freshly isolated PBMCs were plated at 1–2 × 106 cells per well in a 96-well U-bottom plate.
Cells were resuspended in Live/Dead Fixable Aqua (ThermoFisher) for 20 min at 4 °C.
Following a wash, cells were blocked with Human TruStain FcX (BioLegend) for 10 min
at RT. Cocktails of desired staining antibodies were added directly to this mixture for 30
min at RT. For secondary stains, cells were first washed and supernatant aspirated; then
to each cell pellet a cocktail of secondary markers was added for 30 min at 4 °C. For
mouse samples, the left lung was collected at the experimental end point, digested with
1 mg/mL collagenase A (Roche) and 30 µg/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) in complete
RPMI-1640 media for 30 min at 37 °C, and mechanically minced. Digested tissues were
then passed through a 70 µm strainer (Fisher Scientific) to single cell suspension and
treated with ACK Lysing Buffer (ThermoFisher) to remove red blood cells. Cells were
resuspended in Live/Dead Fixable Aqua (ThermoFisher) for 20 min at 4 °C. Following a
wash, cells were blocked with anti-mouse CD16/32 antibodies (BioXCell) for 30 min at
4 °C. Cocktails of desired staining antibodies were added directly to this mixture for 30
min at 4 °C. Prior to analysis, human or mouse cells were washed and resuspended in
100 μL 4% PFA for 30–45 min at 4 °C. Following this incubation, cells were washed and
prepared for analysis on an Attune NXT (ThermoFisher). Data were analysed using
FlowJo software version 10.6 software (Tree Star). The specific sets of markers used to
identify each subset of cells are summarized in Supplementary Fig. 6.

Figure 1: COVID-19 patients have widespread autoantibody reactivity against extracellular antigens.
a, Simplified schematic of REAP. Antibodies are incubated with a barcoded yeast library displaying members
of the exoproteome. Antibody bound yeast are enriched by magnetic column-based sorting and enrichment
is quantified by next-generation sequencing. b, COV-2 RBD REAP scores for COVID-19 patient samples
stratified by positive (n = 121) or negative (n = 39) ELISA RBD reactivity. Significance was determined using
a two-sided Mann-Whitney U test. c, IL6-R REAP scores for COVID-19 patient samples stratified by treatment with an anti-IL-6R biologic therapy (tocilizumab or sarilumab). Samples collected at least one day after
infusion were considered treated. Samples collected on the day of infusion were excluded from analysis due
to uncertainty in the timing of sample collection. Significance was determined using a two-sided Mann-Whitney U test. d, Average number of positive reactivities per sample at different score cutoffs, stratified by
disease severity. A positive reactivity was defined as one with a REAP score greater than or equal to the
corresponding score cutoff. Comparisons were made between each disease severity group and the
COVID-19 negative group. Significance was determined using a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Dunnet’s
test. e, Distributions of hits between samples of different disease severities at different score cutoffs. Each
point on the graph represents the fraction of samples in a given severity group that had at least the indicated
number of reactivities at the given score cutoff. f, Heatmap of immune-related protein REAP scores stratified
by disease severity. Scores below the REAP Validation Threshold of 2.0 were set to 0 to aid interpretation of
significant hits. g, Average number of positive immune-targeting reactivities per sample at different score
cutoffs, stratified by disease severity. Analysis was performed as in d. h, Fraction of samples, stratified by
disease severity, with a REAP score greater than 4 for at least one antigen in each given antigen group. i,
Percentages of IgD-/CD27- B cells among peripheral leukocytes in patient samples, stratified by disease
severity. Significance was determined using a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Dunn’s test. Longitudinal

Supplementary Figure 1. a, Violin plots of days from symptom onset (DFSO) in severe and moderate
COVID-19 samples. DFSO data was not available for a limited number of samples from each group. Significance was determined using a two-sided Mann-Whitney U test. b, Violin plots of the number of reactivities in
severe COVID-19, moderate COVID-19, mild or asymptomatic COVID-19, severe SLE, and APECED
patient samples at different score cutoffs. SLE and APECED patients were screened as previously
described (Wang et al, manuscript in preparation). Due to the smaller size of the yeast exoproteome library
used to screen the SLE and APECED samples, reactivities in the COVID-19 cohort against proteins that
were not in the previously described yeast exoproteome library were removed from these analyses. Significance was determined using a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Dunn’s test. Significance indicators above
the APECED group represent significance in comparison to all other groups. In all violin plots in this figure,
