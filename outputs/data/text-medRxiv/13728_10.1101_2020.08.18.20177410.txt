Title: Inadequate preparedness for response to COVID-19 is associated with stress and burnout
among healthcare workers in Ghana

ABSTRACT

Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded the global crisis of stress and burnout
among healthcare workers (HCWs). But few studies have empirically examined the factors
driving these outcomes. We examined the association between perceived preparedness to
respond to the pandemic and HCW stress and burnout and identified potential mediating factors
among HCWs in Ghana.

Methods: Data are from HCWs in Ghana who completed a cross-sectional self-administered
online survey; 414 and 409 HCWs completed stress and burnout questions, respectively.
Perceived preparedness, stress, and burnout were measured using validated psychosocial
measures. We assessed associations using linear regressions with robust standard errors.

Results: The average score for preparedness was 24 (SD=8.8), 16.3 (SD=5.9) for stress, and
37.4 (SD=15.5) for burnout. In multivariate analysis, HCWs who felt somewhat prepared and
prepared had lower stress (β=-1.89, 95%CI:-3.49 to -0.30 and β=-2.66, 95%CI:-4.48 to -0.84)
and burnout (β=-7.74, 95%CI:-11.8 to -3.64 and β=-9.25, 95%CI:-14.1 to –4.41) scores than
those who did not feel prepared. Appreciation from management and family support were
associated with lower stress and burnout, while fear of infection was associated with higher

stress and burnout. Fear of infection partially mediated the relationship between perceived
preparedness and stress/burnout, accounting for about 16 to17% of the effect.

Conclusion: Low perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19 increases stress and burnout,
and this is partly through fear of infection. Interventions to increase HCWs’ morale and capacity
to respond to the pandemic are needed.

Strengths and limitations of this study
•

Our study is among the first to report data on COVID-19 related stress and burnout
among HCWs in Africa and to identify contributing factors, including HCWs’ perceived
preparedness to respond to the pandemic.

•

We used validated psychosocial measures of stress and burnout, as well as a perceived
preparedness for COVID-19 scale developed by our team, which has high validity and
reliability; this scale can facilitate similar research in other settings.

•

Our study shows that among healthcare workers in Ghana, low perceived preparedness to
respond to the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with higher levels of stress and burnout
and this association is partially mediated by fear of infection.

•

Perceived appreciation from management and family support on the other hand are
associated with lower stress and burnout.

•

Findings are based on self-reported data from a cross-sectional online survey, thus, there
may be social desirability bias; associations described are not causal; and the online
survey may limit generalizability.

INTRODUCTION
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a major health crisis of our generation.
The pandemic had affected over 19.8 million people and claimed the lives of over 733,000
people as of August 10th, 2020.1 Healthcare workers (HCWs) in particular have been
disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, accounting for over 10% of global infections
according to the World Health Organization (WHO).2 In Africa, over 10,000 HCWs across 40
countries contracted COVID-19 as of July 23rd, 2020.3 Underlying the epidemic among these
frontline workers are various factors that may be shaping HCWs’ risk of COVID-19, including
preparedness indicators such as inadequate training, protocols, knowledge, personal protection
equipment (PPE), as well as weak health systems, slow national responses, and poor political
leadership.2,4,5 Yet, emerging data indicate that providers across the globe are inadequately
prepared to respond to the pandemic.5,6

The scale and rapid spread of COVID-19, combined with inadequate preparedness, may be
contributing to HCW stress and burnout—two psychological indicators that reached crisis levels
among HCWs globally prior to COVID-19.7,8 Chronic work-related stress, when not adequately
managed, leads to burnout, which manifests as physical, cognitive, and emotional exhaustion and
depersonalization (feelings of negativism, cynicism, or detachment from one’s job), and reduced
professional efficacy.9 Burnout leads to lower productivity and effectiveness, decreased job
satisfaction and commitment, and poor quality care, with risks to patient safety.10,11 Stress and
burnout is also associated with poor health outcomes such as depression, cardiovascular disease,
and premature mortality.12,13 Moreover, HCW burnout is expensive for the health system given

its associations with care quality, absenteeism, and workforce turnover, and is, thus, critical to
examine.14,15

Since the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, a growing number of studies have
examined its psychological impact on frontline workers.16–19 A qualitative study among HCWs
in China found that challenges experienced in responding to COVID-19 included exhaustion
from prolonged use of protective gear and heavy workloads, and fear of infection and infecting
others, while social support and self-management strategies helped HCWs cope with distress.20
Additionally, a systematic review found that HCWs are experiencing psychological distresses
due to COVID-19, with the following pooled estimates for anxiety (26%), depression (25%),
distress (35%), stress (40%), insomnia (32%), and PTSD (3% to 16%).19 None of these studies
were in Africa.

Inadequate preparedness has been linked to various psychological outcomes among HCWs in
prior epidemics outbreaks.21 But few studies have empirically examined this in the context of
COVID-19 and no studies, to our knowledge, have specifically examined the psychological
impact of perceived preparedness among HCWs to respond to the COVID-19. A nationwide
survey examining psychological distress among the general population in China during the
COVID-19 epidemic found that preparedness indicators (e.g., having effective prevention and
control measures and a highly efficient health system) were protective against psychological
distress.22 In Africa, where health systems are constrained and underfunded,23 no empirical
studies in the context of COVID-19 have reported on this issue to date for HCWs. However, a
prior systematic review found that, generally, burnout is high among physicians and even higher

among nurses in Africa and that drivers of burnout include lack of social support, long work
hours and understaffing, and professional and interpersonal conflicts.24,25

Due to shortage of staff and limited resources, HCWs in African settings have been working
under excessive workloads and psychologically charged environments where demand outweighs
capacity.26,27 In Ghana, which has the third highest number of COVID-19 cases in Africa and
over 2,000 HCWs infected,28,29 stress and burnout may be even higher among HCWs. Previous
studies assessing HCWs’ preparedness for the Ebola outbreak in Ghana found that providers felt
inadequately prepared to respond, and reported issues such as inadequate PPE and staff.30–33 Our
study contributes to addressing the gap in the literature on the psychological impact of COVID19 on African HCWs by examining HCW stress and burnout and associations with perceived
preparedness to respond to COVID-19 and other factors in Ghana.

METHODS
Context
Ghana recorded its first two cases of COVID-19 on March 12th, 2020. Since then, the epidemic
in Ghana has grown exponentially, with 41,212 cases and 215 deaths as of August 10th, 2020,
making it the country with the third highest number of cases in Africa and 51st globally.1,29
Ghana has a constrained health system, with a population of approximately 30 million, an
estimated 1.8 medical doctors and 42 nurses and midwives per 10,000 population, and less than
one hospital bed per 1,000 people.23,34–36 The increasing number of cases within an overburdened
healthcare infrastructure is, therefore, a major source of concern for many HCWs. In addition,
HCWs have expressed fear of coronavirus infection due to concerns about inadequate PPE and

testing, sparking threats of industrial strike actions by nurses and doctors in Ghana.37,38 New data
on the high number of COVID-19 cases among HCWs, including six deaths, has elevated this
fear and, raised renewed concerns about the potential catastrophic effects of a weak health
system and lack of HCW preparedness.39,40

Data collection
This is a cross-sectional study conducted with HCWs in Ghana (i.e., nurses, physicians, and
allied health workers) from April 17th, 2020 to May 31st, 2020. We used a convenience sampling
approach to recruit HCWs virtually through advertising on diverse online and social media
platforms (WhatsApp, Facebook, and direct messaging), and invited them to complete a selfadministered online survey through a link in the ad. To maximize representativeness in our
sample, we disseminated survey links to Facebook and WhatsApp pages of different professional
groups, graduation year groups, and regional groups of HCWs, as well as to leaders of
professional organizations and Ghana Health Service directors to share with members of their
groups. No incentives were provided, and respondents had the option of skipping questions. The
survey included questions on demographics, perceived preparedness, stress, burnout, and other
questions relevant to the pandemic response. Providers consented to the study by completing the
survey. Additional study methods can be found elsewhere.41

Ethical approval was obtained from the University of California, San Francisco (#20-30656)
and the Navrongo Health Research Centre (#NHRCIRB374).

Patients and/or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, or reporting, or
dissemination plans of this research. HCWs however contributed to the development of the
survey questions.

Measures
Dependent variables: stress and burnout
The two outcome variables—stress and burnout—were measured using validated psychosocial
measures. Stress was assessed using the 10-item Cohen perceived stress scale, which captures
people’s feelings and thoughts in the past month.42 Questions relate to how nervous or stressed,
unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives (appendix 1a). Each
question is on a scale of 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Burnout was assessed using the 14-item
Shirom-Melamed Burnout measure (SMBM), which assesses feelings at work in the past
month.43 Questions capture three domains of burnout: physical fatigue, emotional exhaustion,
and cognitive weariness, with responses options ranging from 1 (never or almost never) to 7
(always or almost always) (appendix 1b).

Independent variables
The key predictor in this analysis is perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19, which was
assessed using a 15-item scale developed by our team. The questions capture personal, facility,
and psychological preparedness for prevention, diagnoses, management, and education regarding
COVID-19. Each question has response options from 0 (not prepared at all) to 3 (very prepared),
with options for “I don’t know about this (4), and “Not applicable to my role” (5) (appendix 1c).
The scale development process is described elsewhere.41

Other independent variables included feeling of appreciation, support, and communication from
management; family support, ability to isolate at home without exposing family, fear of
contracting COVID-19, confidence in being cared for if infected, COVID-19 training;
availability of PPE, isolation ward, and protocols for COVID-19; perceived knowledge of how
to manage COVID-19 (appendix 1d), and provider and facility characteristics.

Analysis
The analytic sample is 414 and 409 for the stress and burnout analysis, respectively, representing
respondents who answered all questions on stress and burnout and relevant predictors. We
examined the distribution of variables using descriptive statistics and created summative scores
for stress, burnout, and preparedness. Factor analysis showed all three scales had good construct
validity with all items in each scale loading on one dominant factor with eigen-values greater
than three. The scales also had good internal consistency with Cronbach alpha of 0.79 for stress,
0.94 for burnout, and 0.91 for preparedness. Before creating summative scores, items were
recoded such that higher scores indicate higher stress, burnout, and preparedness. For the
preparedness score, we coded response options to range from 0 to 3 by recoding 4(I don’t know
about this) to 0(not at all prepared) and 5(not applicable to my role) to 2(prepared). Stress scores
range from 0 to 40. Scores of 0-13 are considered low stress, 14-26 moderate stress, and 27-40
high stress.42 Burnout scores range from 14-98—rescaled to 1-7 by dividing by total number of
items for ease of comparison with sub-domains. Scores of ≤2.0 are considered no burnout, 2-3.74
moderate burnout, and ≥3.75 as high burnout.44 We used the same cutoffs for burnout domains.
Preparedness scores range from 0-45. We categorized scores less than 15 as “not at all prepared”;
scores 15 to 29 as “somewhat prepared,” and ≥30 as “prepared”.41

We used the continuous scores for the outcomes in linear regressions with robust standard errors
to examine the associations with various predictors. The burnout score was slightly skewed to
the right, which was corrected with a log transformation. For ease of interpretation, we used the
untransformed variable for the main analysis and conducted sensitivity analysis with the log
transformed variable. We built multivariate models by gradually adding demographic and other
independent variables that were significant in the bivariate analysis and testing for model fit and
collinearity. Finally, we examined if the relationships between perceived preparedness and both
stress and burnout were mediated by fear of infection using the difference of coefficients (c-c’)
method. The mediated or indirect effect is the difference in the coefficients in the model without
the mediator (total effect: c) and that in the model with the mediator (direct effect: c’). The
proportion mediated is ((c-c’)/c).45,46 We also examined if the associations were moderated by
type of health provider, appreciation from management, and family support. In additional
analysis, we ran the models with preparedness as a continuous variable and with the outcomes as
binary variables.

RESULTS
Descriptive results
About 20% were doctors, 62% nurses (including midwives and medical/physician assistants) and
18% other professionals, including medical laboratory professionals, disease control officers,
nutritionists and other allied health care workers (Table 1a). About 26% worked in teaching
hospitals, 59% in other public hospitals (e.g., regional and district hospitals and health centers),
and 15% in private facilities. Approximately 23% work in the Greater Accra and Ashanti regions
(the initial epicenters), 23% from Northern region, and the rest from other regions. There were at

least 10 respondents from each the 16 regions of the country, except for the Bono and Ahafo
regions, which had less than five respondents. The average age of respondents was 34.2 years
(SD=6.0), with 8.2 years of professional experience (SD=5.6). About half were female.

The average stress score was 16.3 (SD=5.9) (Table 1b), with 64% having moderate stress and
4% high stress. Average burnout score was 37.4 (SD=15.5), with 47% having low burnout and
20% high burnout. About 33%, 15%, and 23%, respectively, had high values for physical
exhaustion, emotional exhaustion, and cognitive weariness. Average preparedness score was 24
(SD=8.8), with 56.9% somewhat prepared and 27.5% prepared (Table 1). About 44% perceived
management was appreciative or very appreciative of their efforts and 55% perceived
communication from management was good or very good. Additionally, 46% were fearful or
very fearful of contracting COVID-19 and only 20% were confident or very confident that they
would be adequately cared for in their facility if they got infected. About 67% felt their families
were supportive or very supportive of their work, and 33% were certain of a place to isolate at
home without exposing their family if they were infected. Distribution of other variables shown
in Table 1.

Bivariate results
In the bivariate analysis (Table 2), higher perceived preparedness was associated with lower
perceived stress and burnout. The average stress and burnout scores among those who felt
prepared was 14 (SD=5.1) and 33 (SD=13.5), respectively, compared to 19 (SD=6.1) and 47
(SD=15.3), respectively, for those who did not feel at all prepared. Burnout scores among other
HCWs were lower than that of doctors and nurses. HCWs in Northern region had lower stress

than those in Greater Accra and Ashanti regions and HCWs in other southern regions had lower
burnout than those in Greater Accra and Ashanti regions. Other factors significantly associated
with lower stress and burnout included appreciation, support, and communication from
management; family support; confidence in being cared for if infected; training on COVID-19;
availability of PPE, isolation ward, and COVID-19 guidelines; and confidence in being able to
manage COVID-19 patients. Fear of infection and being female were associated with higher
stress and burnout.

Multivariate analysis
In the multivariate analysis (Tables 3a and 3b), the associations between perceived preparedness
with both stress and burnout were still significant. When accounting for only the demographic
variables (model 1 of Table 3a), providers who felt somewhat prepared and prepared had about
3- and 5-points lower stress scores respectively compared to those who did not feel at all
prepared. This decreased to about 2 and 3 points, respectively, with the addition of appreciation
from management and family support in model 2. In model 3, which includes fear of infection,
the coefficients for somewhat prepared and prepared decreased further (β=-1.89, 95%CI:-3.49 to
-0.30 and β=-2.66, 95%CI:-4.48 to -0.84) by 17% and 16% from model 2, suggesting fear of
infection partially mediates the relationship between perceived preparedness and stress.

For burnout, when accounting for only the demographic variables (Table 3b, model 1), providers
who felt somewhat prepared and prepared had about 10 points and 14 points lower burnout
scores, respectively, compared to those who did not feel at all prepared. This decreased to about
9 and 10 points, respectively, with the addition of appreciation from management and family

support in model 2. In model 3, which includes fear of infection, the coefficients for somewhat
prepared and prepared decreased to about 8 and 9 points (β=-7.74, 95%CI:-11.8 to -3.64 and β=9.25, 95%CI:-14.1 to –4.41)—a 10% decrease from model 2, suggesting potential partial
mediation by fear of infection. The mediated effect with the categorical preparedness variable
was not significant, but it was significant with the continuous preparedness variable with the
proportion of the mediated effect at 16% (table 4).

Providers in the Northern region had about 3 points lower stress scores than those in Greater
Accra and Ashanti regions (the COVID-19 epicenters). Females also had about 3 points higher
burnout scores than males, and married providers had about 5 points lower burnout scores than
unmarried providers. Perceived appreciation from management and family support were
associated with about 2 points lower stress scores and about 5 points lower burnout scores, while
fear of infection was associated with about 2 points higher stress scores and 4 points higher
burnout scores.

Sensitivity results
The interactions between preparedness with type of provider, appreciation from management and
family support were not significant for neither stress nor burnout, suggesting the absence of
conditional effects. The results obtained from using the log of burnout as the outcome, as well as
that from using preparedness as a continuous variable, were consistent with the results of the
untransformed burnout variable and the categorical preparedness variables respectively in their
significance, direction, and magnitude of the associations. Results from the binary logistic
regression based on the dichotomized stress and burnout scores were also generally consistent

with the results of the continuous variables, with minor variations depending on how the variable
was dichotomized (Appendix 2).

DISCUSSION
We found evidence of high stress and burnout and low perceived preparedness to respond to the
COVID-19 pandemic among HCWs in Ghana. Low perceived preparedness was associated with
increased stress and burnout. Our findings suggest that increased fear of infection partly accounts
for the effect of perceived preparedness on stress and burnout—i.e., inadequate preparation leads
to fear of infection, which leads to high stress and burnout. This is, however, a small indirect
effect (<20%), which is likely because other factors, including fear of poor outcomes for
patients, may also be mediating the effect of preparedness on stress and burnout. In contrast,
increased appreciation from management and family support decreases stress and burnout.
Inadequate preparedness may, therefore, have multiplicative effects through its association with
stress and burnout, which may negatively affect HCW job satisfaction, productivity, quality of
care, and workforce turnover14,15—outcomes that would impede Ghana’s progress in containing
COVID-19.

High stress and burnout among health workers in Ghana is not surprising given global evidence
prior to the pandemic of provider stress and burnout—including in Ghana and other African
countries.25,47,48 Our prevalence of moderate (64%) and high (4%) stress among HCWs is
comparable to that reported in a recent systematic review of the psychological impact of
COVID-19 on HCWs and general public, which found stress to be at 40% (20%-60%).19 Also,
compared to our findings of low (47%) and high (20 %) burnout, a study of HCWs in Ghana

reported burnout scores ranging from good (71.5%), alarming (12.6%), acute crisis (6.0%), and
burnout (9.9%) among Accra-based HCWs; however this was prior to the COVID-19
pandemic.48 Additionally, a study among frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 patients in
Wuhan, China reported that about half of the nurses studied experienced moderate and high
burnout—characterized by emotional exhaustion (60.5%) and depersonalization (42.3%).49 We
found lower levels of moderate to emotional exhaustion (39%) and higher levels physical
exhaustion (73%), although the estimates are not directly comparable given the use of different
measures in the different studies.

Burnout among HCWs during COVID-19 pandemic has thus been characterized as an infection
of the mind,50 with calls for interventions to fight the two afflictions: COVID-19 and the
psychological strain experienced by medical professionals at the frontline of the response.51
Extant studies show that factors associated with preparedness include availability of PPE, clear
protocols, and isolation wards, training, and good communication from management.5,41
Improving these would increase perceived preparedness, decrease fear of infection, and decrease
stress and burnout. Recommended steps related to preparedness include development of national
and regional disaster mitigation plans to shorten the time needed to provide necessary equipment
and testing; provision of adequate test kits and PPE; training on disaster management and
response for HCWs; and creating a medical reserve corps of licensed individuals.51 Such
initiatives would help improve HCW preparedness to respond to COVID-19.

Similar to findings from other studies,18,19,52 our results suggest that feeling appreciated by
management and having family support is important for HCWs’ psychological wellbeing, while

being unmarried, female, and working in the most impacted areas negatively affected wellbeing.
Efforts are therefore needed to ensure providers feel appreciated for their role in the pandemic
response and to provide additional support to HCWs who are female, unmarried, and based at the
epicenters of Ghana’s epidemic. Additionally, interventions are needed to increase workplace
awareness of stress and burnout, self-care, availability of and access to mental health services,
and to implement organizational policies and practices that prioritize HCW wellbeing.53 In some
jurisdictions, support programs such as peer-support video conferencing sessions are being
offered for peer groups to discuss various issues affecting them.54 Additionally, categorizing
COVID-19 as an occupational disease, like healthcare organizations have demanded, may help
improve worker protections and government accountability.26 Interventions, like mindfulness
exercises, changes to institutional culture, and workplace incentives could also improve
psychological outcomes among HCWs. Family support is also critical and may help lower stress
and burnout.18

Limitations and strengths
There are some limitations to the study. First, the use of an online survey with a volunteer
sample limits the generalizability of findings to all HCWs in Ghana. This was, however, the best
option available for rapid data collection as the country was in partial lock-down due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. To address this limitation, we recruited from diverse platforms such as
Facebook and WhatsApp pages of different professional groups, graduation year groups, and
regional groups of HCWs. Survey links were also emailed to leaders of professional
organizations and Ghana Health Service directors to share with members of their groups. Thus,
our sample is diverse in terms of gender, age, years of experience, region, and facility type as

shown in the sample distribution—which increases the representativeness of the findings.
Moreover, our study sets the stage for future research to examine these issues in a more
representative sample under circumstances that allow for probability sampling. Additionally, as
with all self-reported data, social desirability and recall bias are potential limitations. The use of
composite scores from validated psychosocial measures, however, helps to address this
limitation. Finally, this was a cross-sectional study, thus, associations described are not causal.
Despite these limitations, this is the first study to our knowledge assessing perceived
preparedness for COVID-19 and psychological well-being among HCWs in Africa and
contributes critical findings that can help address emerging issues and challenges in the current
pandemic response. It also provides a baseline for future studies in Ghana, Africa, and globally.

Conclusions
HCWs in Ghana reported low perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19, which was
associated with increased stress and burnout. The effect of inadequate preparation on both stress
and burnout is partially mediated by fear of infection. This finding is likely replicable in other
low-resource settings, and potentially globally, and highlights the need for interventions to
increase providers’ preparedness. The government of Ghana has demonstrated commitment to
addressing the needs of HCWs; however, more efforts are needed. Government and other
stakeholders must institute necessary trainings, protections, and incentives to improve HCWs’
psychological wellbeing and ability to respond to the pandemic. With HCW shortage in Africa, a
high number of cases among these frontline workers, inadequate PPE and preparedness, and
growing work demands, such interventions are critically needed to retain them and maintain the
quality of care in already strained health systems. Studies in different settings examining the

impact of these factors on health care quality and outcomes in the context of the pandemic are
also needed. For Africa, stress and burnout have far reaching implications for the COVID-19
response. Given warnings that the continent could witness the loss of millions of lives,
immediate actions are needed to strengthen health systems, train HCWs, and provide support and
encouragement to boost morale.
