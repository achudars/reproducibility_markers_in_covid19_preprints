The COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil has demonstrated an important public health impact,
as has been observed in the world. In Brazil, the Amazon Region contributed with a
large number of cases of COVID-19, especially in the beginning of the circulation of
SARS-CoV-2 in the country. Thus, we describe the epidemiological profile of COVID19 and the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in the Amazon Region.
We observe an extensive spread of virus in this Brazilian site. The data on sex, age and
symptoms presented by the investigated individuals were similar to what has been
observed worldwide. The genomic analysis of the viruses revealed important amino
acid changes, including the D614G and the I33T in Spike and ORF6 proteins,
respectively. The latter found in strains originating in Brazil. The phylogenetic analyzes
demonstrated the circulation of the lineages B.1 and B.1.1, whose circulation in Brazil
has already been previous reported. Our data reveals molecular epidemiology of SARSCoV-2 in the Amazon Region. These findings also reinforce the importance of
continuous genomic surveillance this virus with the aim of providing accurate and
updated data to understand and map the transmission network of this agent in order to
subsidize operational decisions in public health.

INTRODUCTION

65

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a

66

newly discovered Betacoronavirus, now recognized as severe acute respiratory

67

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1,2, and is responsible for one of the most

68

significant pandemics in this century, causing millions of cases and high rates of

69

hospitalizations and deaths3,4.

70

In South America, Brazil holds the first place of infected individuals, with

71

3,761,391 diagnosed cases and, out of these, approximately 118,649 Brazilians have

72

lost their lives due to COVID-193. To this end, the Amazon region has effectively

73

contributed to the number of 760,394 infected patients and 19.358 deaths (Update

74

August 28th2020)5 with some of the states in this region presenting the worst scenario of

75

cases at the beginning of the pandemic in Brazil with high rates of occupancy in

76

intensive care units (ICU) and deaths. Most persons with COVID-19 experience mild to

77

moderate respiratory symptoms and recover6. On the other hand, individuals with

78

underlying medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic

79

respiratory diseases and cancer are more likely to be severely and possibly in need of

80

intensive care 6,7.

81

In addition to epidemiological information, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic data, as

82

well as evolution datasets to quantify the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions

83

(NPIs) in virus spatiotemporal spread, are under much investigation, and until then it has

84

been shown that this virus has diversified into several phylogenetic strains 8, marked by

85

different punctual mutations that reflect ongoing transmission currents9.

86

In view of the above, investigations aimed at evaluating the circulation

87

dynamics, genetics and evolutionary characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are of substantial

88

importance for the global surveillance of this virus and, consequently, will provide a

89

better understanding of the virus, the disease it causes and its circulation, providing

90

relevant information for the development of new therapeutic and control strategies and

91

prevention of infections by the new coronavirus. To this end, we combine genetics and

92

epidemiological data to investigate the genetic diversity, evolution and epidemiology of

93

SARS-CoV-2 in the Amazon region.

RESULTS

96
97

Epidemiological data

98

In the Brazilian Amazon region, 8,203 samples were analyzed and 4,400 of

99

which (53.64%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The frequency of detection within the

100

region is shown in figure 1. As for circulation, the highest rate was in epidemiological

101

weeks (EW) 17, 18, 19 and 21, with the highest peak in EW 18 (figure 2).

information. In this regard, the distribution of positive samples by age group has

111

demonstrated that the highest frequency of positivity has occurred in the adult

112

population amongst the over 20 age groups; the average age was 47 (figure 3).

NGS sequencing

130

Thirty-three (33) samples were successfully sequenced from the states of Acre

131

(1), Amapá (11), Maranhão (8), Pará (11), Paraíba (1) and Rio Grande do Norte (1).

132

These samples were analyzed and showed an average of 22,594,487 reads per

133

sequenced sample, ranging from 1,476,498 to 50,601,712 reads (supplementary material

134

1).

135

Pre-processing data

136

After the trimming process of regions with low quality, removal of the adapters

137

and reads smaller than 40 bp, these samples had presented an average of 18,207,316

138

reads per sample, extending from 971,498 to 42,083,456 reads and then were used for

139

assembly by De Novo and Reference Mapping (figure 6 and supplementary material 1).

143

Genome Assembly (De Novo and Reference Mapping)

144

For the genomic assembly process, the assembly was first done via the De

145

Novo method, which has generated an average of 364,488 contigs per sample,

146

extending from 3,964 to 1,816,455 contigs. As for the minimum size of the generated

147

contigs is 200 bp, all the sequences under this length were discarded, for there is no

148

variation in this item. The average of the maximum length of the contigs was 44,130 bp,

149

extending from 4,574 bp to 312,642 bp. The generated N50 lengths were on average

150

409 bp, ranging from 344 bp to 618 bp (supplementary material 1).

151

For reference mapping assemblies, the average of reads mapped was 479,937

152

reads, extending from 11,935 to 3,087,036 reads per sample, leading to an average

153

coverage of 3,007x, extending from 115x to 36,460x (figure 7 and supplementary

154

material 1). All genomes had 38% GC content. There is no variation in this regard. All

155

SARS-CoV-2 genomes were assembled almost entirely during assembly by De Novo,

156

with only the ends needing editing, assembled via reference mapping and later sequence

157

edition.

158
159

Phylogenetic Analysis and Mutation analysis

160

The genomes obtained were aligned with the reference strains deposited in

161

GISAID, showing an identity of 99.98% (supplementary material 2). The analysis of the

162

SARS-CoV-2 genome found revealed 62 nucleotide changes in 12 genes leading to 32

163

amino acid changes in 7 proteins (supplementary material 3).

164

The phylogenetic analysis reveals that isolates from present study clustering in

165

three major clades in B.1 (one clade) and B.1.1 (two clades), with moderate statistical

166

values of 70-89%. These clades are characterized by the presence of mutations

167

S:D614G (B.1 and B.1.1) and substitutions in protein N (N:R203K and N:G204R) that

168

classifies the lineage B.1.1 (Figure 08).

DISCUSSION

178

In Brazil, the first case of COVID-19 was detected in the state of São Paulo on

179

February 26, 2020. In the Brazilian Amazon Region, the first detection has occurred in

180

the state of Manaus on March 13, 2020 and, in that month, the Brazilian Health

181

Ministry had already reported community transmission in the country, as well as a

182

pandemic status by the World Health Organization (WHO). After the first detection of

183

SARS-CoV-2 in this Brazilian site, an extensive spread of this virus was observed in the

184

region, demonstrating, in the present study, a detection frequency of 53.64% showing a

185

critical adaptation and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in this tropical region. The most

186

active circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred mainly in April and May, in EW 17, 18,

187

19 and 21, which coincides with the Amazonian winter season.

188

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred in all age groups. However, the

189

highest frequency has occurred in adults and the elderly, as described in the world

190

population10–13. The low frequency of SARS-CoV-2 in children and teenagers under 20,

191

verified in the present study, has been associated with reduced susceptibility and less

192

likelihood to infection or a combination of both, compared to adults14–16.

193

As for sex, similar to what has been reported by literature, the frequency

194

amongst men was slightly higher than in women17,18. Estrogen, the main female sex

195

hormone, plays a possible protective role in COVID-19, activating the immune

196

response, and directly suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication19,20. Indeed, estrogen

197

inhibits the activity or expression of different components of the renin-angiotensin

198

system. Particularly, estrogen can upregulate ACE2 expression21,22. Regarding the

199

clinical analysis presented by the investigated patients, the most described symptoms

200

were fever, cough, sore throat and dyspnoea, respectively, associated or not, commonly

201

reported amongst respiratory infections, as well as in COVID-1910,11,23,24. However,

202

unlike other respiratory infections, in COVID-19 anosmia and dysgeusia have been

203

frequently reported25–29, as described amongst patients in the study region. After the

204

onset of symptoms, the period of greatest detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR has

205

occurred on the fifth day, similarly to what has been described in other studies30.

206

The genomic analysis of the viruses found revealed that 61 nucleotide

207

mutations were found in the entire genome when compared to the reference genome,

208

and, out of these, 16 led to amino acid changes, with emphasis on the substitutions in S

209

and N proteins that have a structural role and ORF6, a non-structural protein not yet

210

characterized 31,32.

211

Amongst the alterations in the Spike protein that plays a role in binding to the

212

human ACE2 receptor and is also the main antigenic target, it was found the D614G

213

substitution that is described as a factor that antigenically favors the virus, giving it a

214

higher capacity to infection33 and has been used as a genetic marker for strains of the B-

215

lineage (Pangolin Classification) which has become the largest circulating group

216

worldwide34. Also, it was verified the V1176F mutation described in the literature35 and

217

used as a genetic marker for samples circulating in Brazil (https://www.gisaid.org), but

218

no antigenic advantage has yet been attributed.

219

Regarding the N protein plays a role in folding viral genetic material and has

220

been used as a marker for samples from Europe, it was verified R203K, G204R and

221

I292T amino acidic substitutions. However, their molecular roles are still unclear36,37.

222

The change I33T in ORF6, a non-structural protein, has been observed in samples

223

originating in Brazil and that circulate in South America38.

224

The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the samples of this study have formed

225

three distinct groups that cluster with the phylogenetic lineages B.1 and B.1.1 that have

226

samples already sequenced from Brazil39. Within clade B.1, only two samples from Pará

227

were clustering with samples from Europe. In clade B.1.1, it was possible to observe the

228

formation of two distinct groups divided by the I33T ORF6 and V1176F S protein

229

substitutions. These two mutations have been observed to divide the two main strains of

230

SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Brazil34. Since its worldwide circulation on December

231

201940, the SARS-CoV-2 genome has changed wherever it arrives41, which may mean a

232

likely adaptation to the population42.

233

In this study, we did not yet had the chance to analyze how SARSCoV-2

234

became established across the Amazon region and to associate the finding lineages with

235

the population movements, that is, to relate to the proportion of within and between

236

state measured virus movements. Another relevant issue is that the B.1 and B.1.1

237

lineages from the Amazon region were quite similar, making it difficult to trace with

238

precision the origin of these strains in the study site.

239

In conclusion, this study reveals that the highest SARS-CoV-2 circulation has

240

reached its peak in epidemiological week 18. The distribution of positive samples by

241

age group has demonstrated that the median age was 47, with men being the main

242

affected gender and there was a spectrum of symptoms composed of fever, cough,

243

dyspnoea and sore throat. Furthermore, this investigation supports the evidence for the

244

existence of two main lineages (B.1 and B.1.1) associated with genomic epidemiology

of SARS-CoV-2 in the Amazon region. Thus, genomic surveillance must be

246

continuously adopted to be able to offer accurate and quality data to understand where

247

this virus emerged from, and map the transmission network to improve operational

248

decisions in public health.

METHODS

251
252

Samples and ethical aspects

253

The Laboratory of Respiratory Viruses of the Evandro Chagas Institute (LVR-

254

IEC), located in the Amazon region, works with the World Health Organization (WHO)

255

as a National Influenza Center (NIC) for the surveillance of influenza and other

256

respiratory viruses, amongst them, the SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this laboratory has received

257

8,203 clinical specimens from patients of both sexes and in different age groups (zero to

258

111 years old) between February 27th, 2020 to July 1st, 2020 for the diagnosis of SARS-

259

CoV-2 from the states of Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Ceará, Maranhão, Pará, Paraíba,

260

Pernambuco, Rio Grande Norte and Roraima. The clinical specimens collected and used

261

for molecular diagnosis and viral genetic analysis were nasopharyngeal swabs plus

262

throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirate and sputum. This study was approved by Evandro

263

Chagas Institute Ethical Committee (34931820.0.0000.0019).

264
265

Extraction and Detection by RT-qPCR of viral nucleic acid

266

The viral RNA was extracted manually using the QIAamp® Viral RNA

267

Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's guidelines. The

268

detection of the viral genome by RT-qPCR was performed with the Molecular Kit

269

SARS-CoV-2 (E/RP) Biomanguinhos (Biomanguinhos, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil),

270

according to the protocol described by Corman et al (2020) 45.

271

The amplification reaction was conducted sequentially in the following

272

steps: reverse transcription at 50°C for 15 minutes, followed by transcriptase

273

inactivation and activation of Taq DNA polymerase at 95 ° C for 2 minutes, polymerase

274

chain reaction at 95°C for 15 seconds in 45 cycles, extension and annealing at 55 ° C for

275

30 seconds. At the end of the amplification, all clinical samples should have reaction

276

sigmoid curves for the targets that cross the limit line (cycle threshold - Ct) equal to or

277

before 40 cycles. Positive and negative controls were included in each reaction.

readr47, lubridate, fmsb48, plyr49, scales50, viridis51 and hrbrthemes52. By international

285

convention, epidemiological weeks were counted from Sunday to Saturday, considering

286

the sample collection date.

287
288

Sample selection for sequencing

289

The selection of strains for sequencing the viral genome was conducted so that

290

there was geographical and temporal representativeness. In this aspect, the date of

291

collection and the respective epidemiological week of the sample of each state of origin

292

were considered to reach the minimum representation of each federated unit per

293

epidemiological week. In addition, in order to obtain the highest amount of viral RNA

294

and, thus, a greater chance of success in sequencing, samples that showed Ct ≤ 20 in the

295

RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 were selected.

296
297

Library construction and sequencing

298

The total RNA was converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the

299

cDNA Synthesis System Kit and 400 μM of random primers, following the

300

manufacturer's procedure. The reaction solution was purified with the Agencourt

301

AMPure XP Reagent. The cDNA library was prepared and sequenced using the

302

methodology described in the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit on a NextSeq

303

(Illumina, Inc) platform by paired-end methodology with 300 cycles (2x150 reads), in

304

the Evandro Chagas Institute, Brazil Ministry of Health.

305
306

Data pre-processing

307

The data were evaluated for their quality regions. The adapters sequences reads

308

with a quality lower than Phred 20 and reads with less than 40 bp size, were removed

309

using Trimmommatic53. The processed reads were visualized with FastQC54.

313

Genome Assembly (De Novo and Reference Mapping)

314

For this step, the reads validated based on quality trimming were used to

315

assembly the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The De Novo assembly was performed using the

316

Megahit v.1.1.4-255 and for Reference Mapping we have used the software Bowtie256

317

and Geneious Prime, where the respective coverage, gaps and final size of the genome

318

were analyzed. For genome assembly, all programs were performed with default

319

parameters.

320
321

Taxonomic annotation and submission to GISAID

322

The generated de novo contigs were compared using the Blastx tool57

323

implemented in Diamond v.0.9.3358, against the RefSeq database (NCBI's Protein

324

Reference Sequences Database), which is a database of cured protein sequences and

325

which provides a high level of annotation, such as the description of the function of a

326

protein, its domain structure, post-translational modifications, where a statistical value

327

(e-value) of 0.0001 was considered.

328

The viral genome annotation was performed automatically using the Geneious

329

Prime software (Biomatters, Ltd., New Zealand, 2019) and cured manually by

330

comparing the starts and stop codons, as well as the sizes of the genes. These genome

331

database

EPI_ISL_450873-450874,

335

The genomes sequences were aligned with other genomes from all the world

336

using the Mafft v.7.47159. For phylogenetic analysis the software RaXML60 with 1000

337

bootstraps was used as statistical support, using GTR as a nucleotide substitution model.

338

The genomes obtained were compared to the reference strain (NC_045512) by in house

339

python script that compares each base of the entire genome and gives us a mutation list.
