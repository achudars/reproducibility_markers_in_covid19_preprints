Abstract

45

Objectives: Patients requiring haemodialysis are at increased risk of serious illness

46

with SARS-CoV-2 infection. To improve the understanding of transmission risks in

47

six Scottish renal dialysis units, we utilised the rapid whole-genome sequencing data

48

generated by the COG-UK consortium. Methods: We combined geographical,

49

temporal and genomic sequence data from the community and hospital to estimate

50

the probability of infection originating from within the dialysis unit, the hospital or the

51

community using Bayesian statistical modelling and compared these results to the

52

details of epidemiological investigations. Results: Of 671 patients, 60 (8.9%)

53

became infected with SARS-CoV-2, of whom 16 (27%) died. Within-unit and

54

community transmission were both evident and an instance of transmission from the

55

wider hospital setting was also demonstrated. Conclusions: Near-real-time SARS-

56

CoV-2 sequencing data can facilitate tailored infection prevention and control

57

measures, which can be targeted at reducing risk in these settings.

Introduction

62

The emergent SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19 is associated with

63

increased morbidity and mortality in older individuals and in those with chronic

64

diseases.1,2 Chronic kidney disease and pre-existing conditions that may increase

65

the risk of renal failure, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and

66

hypertension, are significantly associated with an increased risk of death in COVID-

67

19.3,4 Individuals requiring haemodialysis in hospital are also at increased risk of

68

nosocomial infection due to prolonged outpatient dialysis (typically three times

69

weekly for four hours per session) and to community infection due to regular travel

70

on public or hospital transport, often with other patients.5-7 The case fatality rate in

71

dialysis patients has been reported as 20-30% compared with 1-2% in patients not

72

requiring haemodialysis.8-11

73

Whole-genome pathogen sequencing has become increasingly accessible. Its utility

74

in the context of evolving outbreaks has been demonstrated with Ebola, Zika and

75

hospital outbreak investigations.12-15 The COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK)

76

Consortium, funded by the UK Department of Health and Social Care, UK Research

77

and Innovation (UKRI) and the Wellcome Sanger Institute, was set up to enable real-

78

time sequencing at a population level and to facilitate the investigation and

79

management

80

information on introductions and transmission events.16-18

81

We aimed to investigate the genetic epidemiology of COVID-19 infection from

82

patients attending six Scottish renal dialysis unit(s) (RDU) using a Bayesian

83

statistical analysis framework incorporating temporal, geographical and genetic

84

sequence data. These results were evaluated alongside traditional epidemiological

85

investigations. We further investigate the clinical impact of COVID-19 infection on

of

hospital-associated

infections,

Study design and participants

90

The Glasgow Renal and Transplant Unit based at the Queen Elizabeth University

91

Hospital and University Hospital Monklands serve a combined population of

92

approximately 2.16 million people across West and Central Scotland under NHS

93

Greater Glasgow and Clyde, NHS Forth Valley and NHS Lanarkshire Health Boards.

94

These institutions provide haemodialysis treatment for 828 outpatients across eight

95

RDUs (numbers extracted 1st March 2020). Use of anonymised data was approved

96

by the Local Privacy Advisory Group of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde ‘Safe

97

Haven’ on behalf of the West of Scotland Ethics Committee (approval

98

GSH/20/RE/001). Follow up was until 4th June 2020. From 2nd March 2020, patients

99

attending for dialysis with symptoms of COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by

100

nasopharyngeal swab. We report data on the six RDUs (RDU 1-6, number of

101

patients treated with dialysis =671) with any patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

102

Initially, personal protective equipment (fluid-resistant surgical masks, eye protection,

103

aprons and gloves) (PPE) was not recommended by UK and Scottish Governments

104

for HCWs caring for patients, unless clinical index of suspicion was high for COVID-

105

19 or for aerosol generating procedures. RDU1 instigated PPE for HCWs and

106

surgical masks for patients whilst travelling to, from and during dialysis on 23rd March

107

in response to earlier infections. From 3rd April 2020, the UK-recommendations

108

changed to include any close patient contact. Surgical masks were also given to all

109

patients, as per RDU1 and shared-patient transport discontinued. Until 5th April

110

HCWs were ineligible for SARS-CoV-2 testing unless hospitalised, being advised to

111

self-isolate for 7 days in keeping with Scottish government policy.

Phylogenetic and probabilistic analysis

138

Retrospective phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome sequences was performed as

139

follows. All full genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from Scotland sequenced as part of the

140

COG-UK consortium were included and aligned using MAFFT v7.310 and with the

141

HKY+I+G4 nucleotide substitution model determined by modeltest. The global

142

lineage and UK lineage assignments for the dialysis samples were determined using

143

civet (https://github.com/artic-network/civet).

144

We applied a novel algorithm, the Sequence Reporting Tool (SRT) to estimate the

145

probability of healthcare- vs community-acquired infection in each case, based on

146

the statistical approach developed for the COG-UK hospital-onset COVID-19

147

infection (HOCI) study (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04405934).22 The

148

approach is based on Bayesian principles and involves comparison of the proportion

149

of similar viral sequences (with maximum pairwise SNP difference of two, with no

150

difference where there is an overlap in ambiguous nucleotide codes or an ‘N’ in

151

either sequence) observed within potential locations of infection for the case of

152

interest: i) patients’ RDU and elsewhere in this hospital, ii) inpatient ward and

153

hospital (if the patient was admitted) all within the prior three weeks; along with a

154

weighted proportion of similar sequences in the local community of the patient within

155

the prior six weeks based on the outer postcode of their home address. There are 61

156

districts based on this outcode (49 in Glasgow and 12 in Lanarkshire). We assumed

157

0.5 prior probability of infection within the RDU before consideration of sequence

158

data, and the prior probability of admission-related infection among the inpatients

159

was based on the interval from admission to diagnosis and the incubation distribution

160

of COVID-19.23 The SRT algorithm outputs two posterior probabilities in all cases:

161

that of acquiring the virus directly from the RDU (p_RDU) and that of acquiring the

162

infection through use of facilities within the hospital but not in the RDU (e.g. toilets,

163

cafes, lobbies, or shared transport, etc) (p_hRDU). A posterior probability (p_RDU)

164

of 1 indicates that the transmission occurred within the RDU; if the p_RDU stays at

165

0.5 then it remains unclear where the transmission occurred; if p_RDU is 0 then the

166

infection was most likely community acquired. If the haemodialysis patient was an

167

inpatient and continued to attend the RDU at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, the

168

SRT algorithm also gives the probability of acquiring the infection from the ward of

169

admission (p_wADM) and that of infection elsewhere in that hospital (p_hADM). The

170

SRT algorithm was coded in R version 3.6.0, using the ape v5.3 package for

171

calculation of pairwise SNP differences and PostcodesioR v0.1.1 and gmt v2.0-1

172

packages to calculate distances between postcodes.22

Survival statistics

174

Comparisons were made between patients who lived and died following SARS-CoV-

to death was 10.5 days (range 0-29 days). Two patients required intensive care (of

188

whom one died). No patients received ‘specific’ therapy for COVID-19 (e.g.

189

dexamethasone, remdesivir, tocilizumab). Compared to the corresponding three-

190

month periods 2018-19 (mean deaths 44/quarter year), there were 16 more deaths

191

in patients undergoing outpatient haemodialysis in the same RDUs, equivalent to

192

0.797 deaths per 1000 patient days in all patients requiring haemodialysis during 1st

193

March-31st May 2020 compared to 0.628 deaths per 1000 patient days as mean of

194

the corresponding period during 2017-2018 (equivalent to a 27.0% increase).

195

Genomic and epidemiological investigation

196

Residual RNA extract from 53 of 60 patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive samples

197

were obtained for virus genome sequencing. 39 of these sequences plus one from a

198

healthcare worker were of sufficient quality and coverage for further analysis. The

199

samples belonged to 13 different UK lineages (Figure 2). Whilst a number of patients

200

had indistinguishable sequences from the same UK lineage and shared dialysis

201

sessions, some fell outwith phylogenetic lineages, providing evidence of community-

202

transmission. The recent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the human population and

203

its relatively low mutation rate, mean sequences in the same UK lineage and

204

phylotype cannot be interpreted as direct transmission events, with further temporal

205

and epidemiological data required to quantify the probability of transmission.

206

Conversely, sequences from different UK

207

transmission. Epidemiological investigation identified clusters of SARS-CoV-2

208

positive patients with shared dialysis sessions and sometimes transport and this was

209

analysed with the phylogenetic data (Figure 2 and 3). We found five of the six RDUs

210

spanning two health boards in the West of Scotland had evidence of unit-linked

211

transmission events.

213

In RDU1, viral sequences from seven haemodialysis patients and one HCW from the

214

same unit clustered within the UK40 lineage (Figure 3). Five of these sequences

215

were indistinguishable to each other (CVR248, CVR284, CVR495, CVR987 and

216

CVR1404), suggestive of within-unit transmission. Applying the SRT, we found the

217

probability of within-unit transmission in RDU1 was indeterminate based on

218

sequence data alone ranging from 0.53 to 0.68. Further epidemiological analysis

219

suggested transmission in some cases – for example, CVR248 and CVR1404 had

220

indistinguishable sequences and shared dialysis sessions (Figure 3). However,

221

CVR284 and CVR495, also with indistinguishable sequences, did not overlap with

222

each other or anyone else on the unit, suggesting community-acquisition. HCW,

223

CVR987, having been in direct contact with CVR248, self-isolated on 22nd March,

224

prior to testing positive seven days later. However, this viral sublineage of UK40,

225

was widespread in the community, with 63 other indistinguishable sequences

226

detected within the geographical location of RDU1 and patient communities; so this

227

transmission could not reliably be inferred.

228

sequences derived from the wider UK40 lineage (CVR780 and CVR1404) (Figure 3)

229

were linked epidemiologically, sharing both dialysis sessions and transport from

230

home to the unit. However, the estimated probabilities of within unit transmission for

231

CVR780 and CVR1404 were 0.63 and 0.54, respectively. This result was supported

232

by close inspection of the data. CVR780 was found to have tested positive for

233

SARS-CoV-2 six days prior to CVR1404 and had a single nucleotide polymorphism

234

relative to the Wuhan reference not found in CVR1404, making transmission from

235

CVR780 to CVR1404 less likely. The widespread distribution of UK40 lineages in the

236

community, the early preventative measures implemented by RDU1 and the lack of

237

definitive epidemiological evidence for transmission suggest that individual

238

transmissions were not due to infection prevention and control (IPC) challenges in

239

this unit. The final case occurred nine days after “lockdown” and the implementation

240

of enhanced PPE measures.

241

RDU2

242

In RDU2, there was evidence of five introductions of SARS-CoV-2 from the

243

community, of which two lineages spread within the unit or on hospital transport to

244

the unit. CVR3289 and CVR3290 had indistinguishable sequences, only seen in two

245

other non-geographically linked community cases. These patients shared the same

246

dialysis session and transport, with an estimated 100% probability of within-unit

247

transmission (Figure 2, lineage UK658). Likewise, CVR1003 and CVR1924 had

248

indistinguishable sequences and shared the same dialysis sessions (Figure 3,

249

lineage UK51). CVR2314 had a p_RDU of 1, but this patient had no epidemiological

250

link to other two patients, suggesting nosocomial transmission from fomites or an

251

untested staff member (staff were not routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2, at this time).

252

RDU3, 4 and 5

253

In RDU3, three introductions and two separate transmission events were identified.

254

Although CVR375 and CVR1511 had indistinguishable sequences, this was shared

255

with 161 other Scottish samples (Figure 2, lineage UK5098). The SRT identified

256

nosocomial infection in CVR375 due to within-hospital rather than within-dialysis unit

257

transmission (p_hADM 0.95). CVR1511 acquisition of infection from RDU3 (p_RDU

258

0.68) was less clear. CVR1817 is a close sequence match to CVR375 and CVR1511

259

based on the 2 SNP threshold, leading the SRT to estimate probable unit-based

260

transmission (p_RDU = 0.73). However, on phylogenetic analysis CVR1817 falls into

261

the separate UK501 lineage (Figure 2) and appears likely to have been community-

262

acquired on consideration of all available information. In lineage UK39, CVR937 was

269

(lineage UK5098) was community-acquired while CVR1843 (p_RDU of 0.9) was

270

highly suggestive of within RDU transmission. These related sequences differed by 2

271

SNPs. This strongly suggests that intermediary modes of transmission should ideally

272

have been investigated, including untested asymptomatic individuals, for example

273

members of staff.

274

RDU6

275

SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to RDU6 on at least 5 occasions with evidence of

276

onward transmission in two cases and hospital-transmission in one. Of the 26

277

(12·3% of total) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, 16 were sequenced. Nine of these

278

patients were within the UK429 lineage (Figure 3). The SRT verified a high likelihood

279

of within-unit transmission, with p_RDU ranging from 0·96 to 1 (Figure 3). CVR3373

280

(p_RDU = 0, the first of this phylotype found in RDU6) and CVR3362 were within a

281

separate lineage, UK5098 (Figure 3). CVR3362 had been hospitalised for a month

282

prior to the positive SARS-CoV-2 test, whilst maintaining dialysis within RDU6 and

283

had a p_RDU of 1. Further discussion with the infection control team confirmed that

284

CVR3379 (non-haemodialysis patient) and another unsequenced SARS-CoV-2

285

positive haemodialysis patient, shared the same hospital bay with CVR3362. It is

286

possible that SARS-CoV-2 was brought onto this bay by the other haemodialysis

287

patient from their dialysis sessions on RDU6. This highlights one of the limitations of

288

phylogeny and the SRT algorithm in an outbreak investigation – sequencing data

289

needs to be representative of prevalent cases for the results to be interpreted.

290

Finally, CVR3732 (Figure 2, UK370) had a high p_hRDU (0·96) indicating acquisition

291

of SARS-CoV-2 from elsewhere in the hospital.

292

Summary

293

We found evidence of multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 infection into Scottish

294

dialysis units and of onward transmission within these units. There was strong

295

evidence for 15 patients acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in hospital or on shared hospital

296

transport. For a further 9 patients the source of infection was less certain although

297

most likely acquired within the hospital RDU setting (In lineage UK40: CVR284,

298

CVR495, CVR780, CVR1204, CVR1314, CVR1404 were similar but multiple

299

indistinguishable sequences were also detected in the community; lineage UK5098:

300

CVR1511; lineage UK39: CVR1816; lineage UK501: CVR1817). A further 15

301

patients most likely acquired SARS-CoV-2 in the community (Supplementary Table

302

1). RDU6 cases had a high likelihood of within-unit transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and

303

RDU6 also had one of the highest rates of infection over the longest time period (31st

304

March to 26th May, Table 2). However, in RDU1, where the rate of infection was also

305

high, there was tentative evidence of within-unit transmission; infections occurred

306

over 12 days, the incubation period of the last case was coincident with both

307

“lockdown” and enhanced PPE implementation.

Discussion

311

6 affected Scottish RDUs. Using a genomic epidemiology approach, we found that

312

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within RDUs was common, affecting 8·9% of dialysis

313

patients with a very high associated mortality (27%) in keeping with other recent

314

studies. 8-11Many guidelines have evolved for the care of dialysis patients to minimise

315

risk of infection, including nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.5,6,24 Less is

316

known around whether patients requiring dialysis are at greater risk of community
13

During the first wave of the UK pandemic, we studied SARS-CoV-2 infections within

317

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and how infection in the dialysis units relates to viral

318

exposure in the healthcare environment compared to that in the community. Whole-

319

genome sequencing provides high-level resolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome and in

320

combination with epidemiological data can facilitate our understanding of

321

transmission and evolution during pathogen outbreaks.13,14 Applying careful analysis

322

of data generated from the community and the hospital setting, we found risk was

323

present both from community and hospital settings; almost always from within the

324

RDUs themselves, but on occasion from the wider hospital. Multiple introductions

325

occurred into the dialysis units, reflecting the risks associated with individuals having

326

increased contact with the community (including need for frequent travel to hospitals)

327

as well as prolonged and regular contact within the RDUs themselves. Data from the

328

Scottish Renal Registry suggest that measures introduced in early April to reduce

329

this exposure, including the use of masks to and from dialysis and individual

330

transport, were effective; with the number of cases in people receiving dialysis falling

331

sharply two to three weeks before the rest of the general population within

332

Scotland.25 In order to capitalise on the utility of such knowledge in hospital-outbreak

333

management, the results from the sequencing data need to be generated in a timely

334

manner.15,17 However, the feasibility of implementing this rapid sequencing response

335

in the National Health Service to date has been impeded by lack of expertise and

336

equipment for both high-throughput whole-genome sequencing and for processing

337

the data generated into a form interpretable by infection control and public health.

338

COG-UK has demonstrated that near real-time sequencing is achievable at scale.17

339

We used this framework and a novel statistical algorithm to characterise

340

transmission dynamics specifically in the haemodialysis cohort, a group both at

341

higher risk of severe outcome as well as having numerous healthcare interactions.

342

A limitation of the study is the sequences available for analysis; accurate estimation

343

of the likely source of infection depends on having sufficient sequences available

344

from the community of affected patients and of cases from the hospital setting. Here,

345

we obtained sequences from two-thirds of the lab-detected SARS-CoV-2 cases from

346

RDU1-RDU5, and 44% for RDU6. We also compared data from the RDUs with 944

347

other cases in the community, 700 inpatients and 546 samples taken from patients

348

presenting in emergency departments in the same health boards as provide care for

349

dialysis patients. Additionally, COVID-19 is asymptomatic in up to 20% of patients,

350

which may have reduced the number of infections captured.26 Further, early in the

351

pandemic, HCWs were ineligible for testing. Frequent, regular testing of all HCWs

352

and all patients, regardless of symptoms is warranted. There is also mounting

353

evidence that HCWs have a higher seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies than

354

the general population, with a high proportion being asymptomatic.27,28

355

The low substitution rate of SARS-CoV-2 limits the granularity of outbreak analysis;

356

as demonstrated in this study, indistinguishable sequences may not be part of a

357

transmission cluster if there is widespread circulation in the patients’ home

358

communities. To address this limitation, we employed the SRT, which combines

359

sequence data with both temporal and geographic data to improve estimates of

360

within-unit and within-hospital versus community transmission. Based on additional

361

epidemiological evidence such as timing of haemodialysis sessions and hospital

362

transport, the SRT correctly identified a high probability of within-unit transmission for

363

RDU 2, 3, 5 and 6. Less definitive results for RDU1, not immediately apparent by

364

phylogenetic investigation alone (due to the widespread presence the lineage within

365

the community), affirm its potential as a rapid tool to aid outbreak investigations.

366

We confirm the findings of other published reports of SARS-CoV-2 in the

367

haemodialysis cohort that cases are at risk of poor outcomes, with no specific at-risk

368

group identified based on comorbid conditions.9 The high mortality, dearth of

369

therapeutics and likely poor response to vaccines,29 emphasises the need for

370

targeted strategies to mitigate risk in this cohort. Identification of major transmission

371

risks is vital to address outbreaks in this vulnerable group where there is prolonged,

372

unavoidable contact between healthcare settings and the local community. Whilst

373

universal infection control measures are beneficial, we identified multiple community-

374

acquired infections, with RDUs being an interface for transmission. Additional

375

measures may be required to reduce infection in this setting. Longer, more extreme

376

periods of intensive social distancing (‘shielding’) to reduce contact with other

377

individuals may be required when the community incidence of infection is high.

378

Knowledge of the dominant site of transmission can justify and provide precision to

379

the recommendation to shield and condense the period of isolation, loneliness and

380

distress in this cohort, who already have a high incidence of depression.

381

Although we demonstrate the utility of identifying the likelihood of transmission of

382

SARS-CoV-2 infection around treatment centres for haemodialysis, our findings have

383

resonance for any group requiring frequent attendance in healthcare facilities, such

384

as patients undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy or outpatient rehabilitation.
