Abstract - word count:149

26

Greece is a country with limited spread of SARS-CoV-2 and cumulative infection attack rate of

27

0.12% (95%CI 0.06%-0.26%). Health care workers (HCWs) are a well-recognized risk group for

28

COVID-19. The study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in

29

two hospitals and assess potential risk factors. Hospital-1 was involved in the care of COVID-19

30

patients while hospital-2 was not. A validated, rapid, IgM/IgG antibody point-of care test was

31

used. 1,495 individuals consented to participate (response rate 77%). The anti-SARS-CoV-2

32

weighted prevalence was 1.07% (95%CI 0.37-1.78) overall and 0.44% (95%CI 0.12-1.13) and

33

2.4% (95%CI 0.51-8.19) in hospital-1 and hospital-2, respectively. The overall, hospital-1, and

34

hospital-2 seroprevalence was 9, 3 and 20 times higher than the estimated infection attack rate in

35

general population, respectively. Suboptimal use of personal protective equipment was noted in

36

both hospitals. These data have implications for the preparedness of a second wave of COVID-

37

19 epidemic.

Introduction

44

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) caused by a novel coronavirus [severe acute

45

respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)] emerged in Wuhan, China in December

46

2019 (1) and spread worldwide in 212 countries and territories causing more than 5.8 million

47

cases and 360,000 deaths within a period of 5 months (1).

48

In Greece, the first COVID-19 case was diagnosed on February 26. On March 23, a

49

nation-wide lockdown was enforced to reduce ongoing virus transmission as a response to this

50

pandemic. As of May 30, there were 2,915 confirmed cases and 175 related deaths in Greece

51

with a death rate of 16 per 1,000,000 population, which is one of the lowest in Europe (2).

52

Modelling data suggest that by the end of April 2020, when the first wave of epidemic was

53

completed, the infection attack rate in Greece was 0.12% (95% Crl: 0.06-0.26%) which

54

corresponds to 13,200 total infections (95% Crl: 6,206 – 27,700) and a case ascertainment rate of

55

19.1% (95 CI 9.1-40.6) (3).

56

Health care workers (HCWs) is a well-known risk group for coronavirus infections (4,5),

57

accounted for a significant proportion of COVID-19 infections worldwide. By February 24,

58

2020, 3,387 HCWs out of 77,262 (4.4%) cases reported in China were HCWs (6). The majority

59

of these HCWs were documented at Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic. In a

60

comprehensive analysis of 9,684 HCWs from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei, the

61

symptomatic infection rate was 1.1% while the respective asymptomatic infection rate was

62

estimated at 0.9%. Nurses held a higher infection risk than physicians [OR: 2.07 (95% CI 1.7-

4.3)] (7). The city of Daegu, South Korea, had the first large outbreak of COVID-19 outside

64

China. 121 HCWs were infected with infection rates 4.42 cases/1000 compared with 2.72 in the

65

general population. Among HCWs, the infection rates were 2.37, 4.85, and 5.14 cases/1,000

66

among doctors, nurses, and nurse assistants, respectively (8). In a large study among HCWs from

67

the Netherlands, of whom 9,705 were hospital employees, a total of 1,353 (14%) reported fever

68

and respiratory symptoms. Of those, 86 (6%) were infected with SARS-CoV-2, representing 1%

69

of all HCWs employed (9). Higher infection rates of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, ranging from 5-

70

44%, were observed in HCWs from UK, Spain, Italy and US (10-17).

71

Serologic methods based on antibody testing (anti-SARS-CoV-2) could provide a more

72

accurate estimate of epidemic size by detecting diagnosed and undiagnosed cases. Antibody

73

methods rely on detection of IgM, IgG, IgA, or total antibodies by a variety of methods (18,19).

74

The prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs was assessed in a number

75

of studies from countries with high burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection where the reported anti-

76

SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence ranges from 1.6 - 45.3% (20-25) Few studies used serological

77

methods in the context of outbreak investigation (26,27).

78

This study aimed to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs of

79

two Greek hospitals during the current epidemic and identify potential risk factors for infection.

80

Patients and Methods

81

This cross-sectional study recruited HCWs aged more than 18 years from two hospitals.

82

The designated hospital-1 is a 500-bed tertiary General Hospital providing care to COVID-19

83

patients. Hospital-2 with 134 beds is a Cardiac Surgery Center not involved in the care of

84

COVID-19. The eligible personnel was in total 1,952, 1,120 in hospital-1, and 832 in hospital-

85

2.

86

Two groups were investigated 1) first-line health care workers (FL-HCWs), defined as

87

personnel whose activities involve contact with patients, and 2) second-line health care workers

88

(SL-HCWs), such as office employees, technical personnel, cleaning personnel etc.

89

Testing was offered at one specified location in each hospital for a period of 4 weeks, 13

90

April-14 May 2020, and 30 April – 15 May 2020 in hospital-1 and -2, respectively. Informed

91

consent was obtained from all participants who were interviewed using a structured

92

questionnaire including demographics, education, position within hospital, exposure to COVID-

93

19, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and symptoms related to COVID-19. The data

94

were directly recorded in a secure database. All participants were immediately informed on their

95

test results, and they were offered a short posttest counseling session. The study was approved

96

by the Institutional Review Board of both hospitals.

97

Testing was based on the GeneBody COVID-19 IgM/IgG detection, which is a

98

chromatographic immunoassay for the rapid and differential test of immunoglobulin M and

99

immunoglobulin G against SARS-CoV-2. Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was

100

performed using capillary blood according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Genebody Inc.).

101

Samples were concluded as reactive if the IgM or the IgG or both bands were positive using a

102

colorimetric reader (Confiscope G20 analyser). Positive individuals were immediately retested

103

and the concordant were considered positive.

104

The antibody assay was validated in a serological panel of 107 hospitalized,

105

symptomatic, positive by RT-PCR, COVID-19 patients (Panel A) and in a second panel (Panel

106

B) including 150 samples collected before SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (see Appendix).

107

To calculate the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, firstly, we calculated the

108

unweighted proportions of positive testsand then we obtained the prevalence after weighting for

109

the age distribution of the adult population (18-69 years old) in Athens Metropolitan area from

110

the 2011 census. Secondlywe adjusted the weighted proportion for the sensitivity and specificity

111

of the test, as assessed from the validation in the serological panels A and B, using the epiR

112

package (R version 3.6.3, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

113

Results

114

A total of 1,495 HCWs consented to participate. The overall participation rate was 77%

115

(81% and 71% in hospitals-1 and 2, respectively). Of 1,495 individuals tested, 69.7% were

116

women, 61.7% were aged 35 to 54 years old, with a mean age (SD) of 46.4(10.3) years. FL-

117

HCWs accounted for 73.4 % of those tested. Subjects’ characteristics are listed in Table.

118

A total of 15 individuals tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2, eleven of them for IgG

119

only, three for IgM only and one for both IgM/IgG. After adjusting for age and test performance-

120

assuming 87% sensitivity and 100% specificity the weighted seroprevalence for anti-SARS-

121

CoV-2 in the total population was 1.07% (95%CI 0.37, 2.78). The weighed seroprevalence in

122

hospital-1 was 0.44% (95%CI 0.12, 1.13) and in hospital-2 2.40% (95%CI 0.51, 8.19) (Table).

123

The seroprevalence was 9, 3 times and 20 times higher in the overall hospital population, in

124

hospital-1 and in hospital-2, respectively compared with the general population (0.12%,

125

Crl:0.06-0.26) (3). No significant associations were noted in the seroprevalence according to

126

gender, country of birth, education, number of members in the household, FL-HCWs, SL-HCWs

127

and use of PPE. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was higher with increasing age, but the trend was

128

not statistically significant (p=0.10). The use of PPE was suboptimal in both hospitals. In

129

hospital-1 and among the personnel treating COVID-19 the use of gloves, masks, glasses, gown

130

was 96%, 99%, 56% and 63%, respectively. In hospital-2 the use of gloves and mask was

131

reported in 99.7% and 100% while the use of glasses and gown occasionally (15%).

132

Among all participants, 150 (10.1%) reported some symptoms indicative of COVID-19

133

in the previous 3 months; 82 reported fever, and 111 of them cough; 27 reported shortness of

134

breath. Overall, 1,345 (89.9%) reported no symptoms. The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 was

135

2.02% (95%CI 0.15, 13.78) and 0.98% (95%CI 0.28, 2.80) in those who reported and those not

136

reporting symptoms, respectively but the difference was not statistically significant.

137

Discussion

138

In this survey of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among hospital personnel, the overall

139

seroprevalence was 1.07% (95% CI 0.37, 2.78) using a validated point-of care assay. This low

140

seroprevalence rate is consistent with the low burden of COVID-19 in Greece. However, in the

141

total hospital population and in that of hospital-2, it was 9 and 20 times higher, respectively,

142

compared to the cumulative infection attack rate estimated by mathematical modeling for the

143

general population in Greece (3). This is not surprising since the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is

144

highly heterogeneous (28). In New York State the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 was found

145

14.0% with a range of 3.6-22.7% (28).

146

Due to the low burden of infection, the study is underpowered for pointing out risk

147

factors. The difference in the prevalence between hospital-1 [0.44% (95%CI 0.12, 1.13)] and

148

hospital-2 [2.40% (95%CI 0.51, 8.19)] is not significant. However, it is consistent with data

149

suggesting that HCWs in hospitals involved in COVID-19 care could have a lower burden of

150

infection than those not participating in COVID-19 care (7, 21). This is probably due to the use

151

of PPE, which is the main determinant for risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the health care

152

environment (30). In this study the use of PPE was suboptimal in both hospitals. Other reported

153

risk factors are working in high- risk departments, long duty hours, practicing suboptimal hand

154

hygiene (31). Of the 42,600 HCWs caring for COVID-19 patients in the second half of the China

155

epidemic, none was infected, suggesting that sufficient precautions and rigorous enforcement of

156

PPE are the major determinants for eliminating COVID-19 infection (6).

157

A further challenge is whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can be truly attributed to hospital-

158

acquired infections, especially in countries with a high burden of community infection (28). In

159

the study of Lai Y et al, contact with patients (59%), colleagues with infection (11%), and

160

community acquired infection (13%) were the main routes of exposure among HCWs (7).

161

Contradicting results are noted in two large studies from Madrid and Birmingham. The anti-

162

SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is higher in HCWs working in areas with exposure to COVID-19 (31-

163

34%) compared with low-risk area (26%) and external workers (30%) in Madrid (24). On the

164

contrary in Birmingham study the anti-SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was higher among general

165

medicine and housekeeping general personnel (30-35%) compared with intensive care and

166

emergency medicine (13-15%) (21).

167

Several study limitations are noted: 1) The sensitivity of the currently existing antibody

168

assays is not well known since they were registered using convalescent sera from symptomatic

169

hospitalized patients and their sensitivity was not assessed in asymptomatic or mildly

170

symptomatic patients (18,19). 2) At present, data on post-infection immunity are lacking. Studies

171

from the previous SARS-CoV-1 outbreak have shown a steady prevalence decrease with time

172

(18,19) 3) Higher antibody titers are associated with infection severity (18,19). 4) The study,

173

due to the low anti-SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, is underpowered to detect risk factors. 5) The

174

prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 in the Greek population is not known and the infection attack

175

rate estimated from a modelling study was used as surrogate of the general population

176

prevalence. 6) Several studies, non-peer reviewed available as preprint, were used.

177

In conclusion, the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospital personnel in Athens

178

is low, consistent with the low burden of infection in the country. The use of PPE was

179

suboptimal. These findings have implications for the preparedness of a second wave of COVID-

180

19.
