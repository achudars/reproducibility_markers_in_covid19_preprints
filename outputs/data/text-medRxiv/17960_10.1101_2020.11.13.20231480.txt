Abstract

21

Background: High levels of vaccination coverage in populations will be required even with

22

vaccines that have high levels of effectiveness to prevent and stop outbreaks of coronavirus.

23

The World Health Organisation has suggested that governments take a proactive response to

24

vaccine hesitancy ‘hotspots’ based on social and behavioural insights.

25

Methods: Representative longitudinal online survey of over 3000 adults from Australia that

26

examines the demographic, attitudinal, political and social attitudes and COVID-19 health

27

behavior correlates of vaccine hesitance and resistance to a COVID-19 vaccine.

28

Results: Overall, 59% would definitely get the vaccine, 29% had low levels of hesitancy, 7%

29

had high levels of hesitancy and 6% were resistant. Females, those living in disadvantaged

30

areas, those who reported that risks of COVID-19 was overstated, those who had more

31

populist views and higher levels of religiosity were more likely to be hesitant or resistant

32

while those who had higher levels of household income, those who had higher levels of

33

social distancing, who downloaded the COVID-Safe App, who had more confidence in their

34

state or territory government or confidence in their hospitals, or were more supportive of

35

migration were more likely to intend to get vaccinated.

36

Conclusions: Our findings suggest that vaccine hesitancy, which accounts for a significant

37

proportion of the population can be addressed by public health messaging but for a

38

significant minority of the population with strongly held beliefs, alternative policy measures

39

may well be needed to achieve sufficient vaccination coverage to end the pandemic.

Introduction

45

For most countries the development of a safe and effective vaccination for COVID-19 is seen

46

as the long-term solution to the COVID-19 pandemic. A critical step in extinguishing the

47

pandemic will be vaccination of a high proportion of the population in the context of

48

increasing misinformation, vaccine hesitancy and lack of trust in science. In this paper we

49

present evidence from a large nationally representative survey of vaccination intentions to a

50

safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. We document the demographic, attitudinal, political

51

and social attitudes and COVID-19 health behaviour correlates of vaccine hesitance and

52

resistance to a COVID-19 vaccine. We focus on lower and higher levels of hesitancy and

53

resistance to vaccination, as tailored public health information campaigns may well be more

54

effective for those who are less hesitant.

55
56

Herd immunity of populations is a product of several factors, the infectivity of the

57

coronavirus (R0 = 3.1) [1], the effectiveness of the vaccine and the percentage of the

58

population vaccinated. Estimates of infectivity of the coronavirus suggest that with a 100 per

59

cent effective vaccine, 67 per cent of the population needs to be vaccinated [2] but that

60

vaccination coverage needed varies by infectivity (55 per cent when R0 = 2.2 to 82 per cent

61

when R0 =5.7 [3]. Simulations suggest that solely relying on a vaccine to extinguish a

62

COVID-19 epidemic would require vaccination coverage of 100 per cent with vaccine

63

effectiveness of 60 per cent [4]. For 80 per cent effectiveness of a vaccine, coverage of 75

64

per cent of the population would be required [4]. Assuming that initial vaccines are less than

65

80 per cent effective (flu has been found to have an average effectiveness of 67 per cent) [5]

66

then very high vaccination rates are needed to ensure eradication or control of the

67

coronavirus in populations.

68
69

Research to date suggests that COVID-19 vaccination intentions vary substantially between

70

countries [6]. Vaccine hesitancy (being unsure about getting a vaccine) usually accounts for a

71

more substantial share of the population who will not be vaccinated than vaccine resistance

72

(those who object to vaccines). For instance, in the United States 21 per cent were probably

73

willing and 31 per cent were not willing to have the COVID-19 vaccine [7] while nationally

74

representative surveys in the United Kingdom reported 25-27 per cent were hesitant, and 6-9

75

per cent resistant [8, 9] and in Canada reported 19 per cent somewhat likely, 9 per cent did

76

not know and 14 per cent unlikely to get the COVID-19 vaccine when available [10]. A

77

cross-national representative survey of over 7,000 participants in seven European countries

78

(Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, and the UK) reported that

79

across these countries 19 per cent were hesitant (not sure) and 7 per cent would not get

80

vaccinated [6]. However there was substantial variation between countries with vaccine

81

hesitancy 12-28 per cent while resistance ranged from 5-10 per cent [6]. In Australia vaccine

82

hesitancy to a COVID-19 vaccine has been reported at 9 per cent and vaccine resistance 5 per

83

cent however this evidence was from a non-representative online survey [11].

84
85

The World Health Organisation’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) have

86

suggested governments take a proactive response to vaccine hesitancy ‘hotspots’ based on

87

social and behavioural insights [12]. Therefore, nationally representative information is

88

important for an agile response to COVID-19 vaccination. Using a representative

89

longitudinal survey of over 3000 participants from Australia we examine the demographic,

90

attitudinal, political and social attitudes and COVID-19 health behaviour correlates of

91

vaccine hesitance and resistance to a COVID-19 vaccine. We distinguish between those who

92

may get the vaccine but are not sure (hesitant) from those who will definitely get the vaccine

93

because they are usually a large percentage of the population, and unlike vaccine resistant

94

individuals, are likely to be convinced about public health messaging and information about

95

vaccine safety [13]. We also examine those who will not get the vaccine (resistant). Given the

96

Australian government has indicated that the COVID-19 vaccine would be provided free to

97

the population, consistent with previous research on vaccine hesitancy [8, 14] we hypothesise

98

that confidence in government and science, attitudes towards COVID-19 and adherence with

99

public health messages, conservative and authoritarian political attitudes will be more

100

important than demographic characteristics [8, 9, 14]. We also test whether downloading the

101

COVID-Safe app was related to vaccine hesitancy or resistance.

The remainder of the paper is as follows, Section 2 outlines the methodology including the

104

study design and participants, survey questions and statistical analyses. Section 3 shows the

105

results and Section 4 discusses the results in the context of previous research and their

106

implications.

110

The primary source of data for this paper is the August ANUpoll, which collected data from

111

3,061 respondents aged 18 years and over across all eight States/Territories in Australia, and

112

is weighted to have a similar distribution to the Australian population across key

113

demographic and geographic variables. Data for the vast majority of respondents was

114

collected online (94.1 per cent), with a small proportion of respondents enumerated over the

115

phone. A limited number of telephone respondents (17 individuals) completed the survey on

116

the first day of data collection, with a little under half of respondents (1,222) completing the

117

survey on the 11th or 12th of August.

The contact methodology for offline Life in Australia™ members was an initial SMS (where

120

available), followed by an extended call-cycle over a two-week period. A reminder SMS was

121

also sent in the second week of fieldwork. Taking into account recruitment to the panel, the

122

cumulative response rate for the most recent survey is 7.8 per cent, a slight decline from

123

previous waves of data collection in 2020.

124

Unless otherwise stated, data in the paper is weighted to population benchmarks. For Life in

125

Australia™, the approach for deriving weights generally consists of the following steps:

126

1.

127

Compute a base weight for each respondent as the product of two weights:
a. Their enrolment weight, accounting for the initial chances of selection and

128

subsequent post-stratification to key demographic benchmarks

129

b. Their response propensity weight, estimated from enrolment information

130

available for both respondents and non-respondents to the present wave.

131
132

2.

Adjust the base weights so that they satisfy the latest population benchmarks for
several demographic characteristics.

133
134

We make use of a limited amount of longitudinal data in this paper. Of those who completed

135

the August 2020 wave of data collection, 2,916 individuals (95.3 per cent) also completed the

136

May 2020 ANUpoll, 2,833 individuals (92.6 per cent) also completed the April 2020

137

ANUpoll, 2,828 individuals (92.4 per cent) also completed the February 2020 Life in

138

AustraliaTM surveyi, and finally, 2,790 individuals (91.1 per cent) also completed the January

139

2020 ANUpoll (during the height of the Black Summer Bushfire crisis).

Survey questions

147

questions ask about your views on a vaccine for COVID-19’ and then we ask ‘If a safe and

148

effective vaccine for COVID-19 is developed, would you…’ with the following four

149

response categories, alongside the weighted percentage of respondents:

Dependent variable: Vaccine intention was measured by the following question: ‘The next

150

•

Definitely not (5.5 per cent);

151

•

Probably not (7.2 per cent);

152

•

Probably (28.7 per cent); and

153

•

Definitely (58.5 per cent)

154
155

Consistent with previous literature on vaccine acceptability, we define those who are

156

definitely not going to get the vaccine as vaccine resistant [8]. High levels of hesitancy was

157

defined as those who would probably not get vaccinated while low levels of vaccinated was

158

categorised as low levels of hesitancy because of the uncertainty given that the decision was

159

about a vaccine would be safe and effective [8].

160
161

Independent variables: Detailed descriptions of independent variables included in the

162

analyses are provided in the Appendix. Demographic variables included sex, age, indigenous

163

status, born overseas (English speak or non-English speaking country), speaks a language

164

other than English at home, education, socio-economic status of the area, capital or non-

165

capital city, employed, and household income. The state of Victoria was experiencing an

166

outbreak in August 2020 marked by a score of 79.7 on COVID-19 Stringency index

167

compared to 52.3 and we identified participants living in Victoria through a dummy variable

168

[15]. As a point of comparison the COVID-19 Stringency index was 67.1 in the United

169

States and 69.9 in the United Kingdom on 12 August 2020. Health related variables included

170

self-rated health and disability or chronic illness. COVID-19 related variables included been

171

tested for COVID-19, worried about yourself or family or friends contracting COVID-19,

172

extent of social distancing behavior, downloaded the COVID-Safe app and considering that

173

there was too much worry about COVID-19. Political, and social attitudes included voting

174

intentions, populism, authoritarianism, religiosity, attitudes towards immigration, social trust,

175

altruism, confidence in Federal government, state government or hospital and health system.

176
177

2.3

Statistical analyses

178

We estimated an ordinal probit model using oprobit command in STATA 15.1. Given the

179

large number of independent variables we estimated several models. Model 1 included

180

demographic variables. Model 2 included demographic and health variables. Model 3

181

included demographic and COVID-19 related variables. Model 4 included demographic and

182

political and social attitudes. To understand the relative importance of the variables included

183

in the models, Model 5 included demographic variables and statistically significant variables

184

(p<0.05) from models 2-4. We weighted to population benchmarks in all analyses to account

185

for survey design and non-response.

Almost three-in-five Australians (58.5 per cent) would definitely get the vaccine. We divided

191

vaccine hesitancy into two levels. Low levels of vaccine hesitancy were those who indicated

192

they were likely to get the vaccine but not certain (28.7 per cent) and high levels of vaccine

193

hesitancy those who will probably not get the vaccine (7.2 per cent). We defined those who

Correlates of vaccine hesitancy and resistance

201
202

Females were less likely than males to intend to get the vaccine, and more likely to be

203

hesitant and resistant. Those who were older (55-64, 65-74 and those over 75 years) were less

204

likely to be resistant or hesitant and more likely to intend to get vaccinated when it became

205

available than those aged 35-44 years old. Compared to those had Year 12 only, those with

206

an undergraduate or postgraduate university degree were less likely to be resistant or hesitant

207

and more likely to intend to be vaccinated.

208
209

There were neighbourhood differences, those living in the 4th most disadvantaged quintile of

210

disadvantage were less likely to intend to get vaccinated when compared to those living in the

211

3rd quintile. Individuals living in households with more household income were less likely to

212

be resistant or hesitant and more likely to intend to get vaccinated. All other demographic

213

variables were not statistically significant.

Health and disability status were not associated with vaccine intentions (model 2, see

220

In model 3 COVID-related variables were included as well as demographic variables (see

221

Appendix). Contrary to other research on the likelihood of getting vaccinated to COVID-19

222

[14] individual concerns or concerns about relatives or friends contracting COVID-19 were

223

not related to vaccination intentions. Being tested for coronavirus was also not related to

224

vaccination intentions.

225
226

People who reported greater levels of social distancing behaviour were less likely to be

227

resistant and more likely to intend to get vaccinated. Similarly, those that had downloaded the

228

COVID-Safe App were less likely to be resistant (-3.0 percentage points lower) or hesitant

229

(high: -2.7 percentage points and low: -5.1 percentage points) and more likely to intend to get

230

vaccinated (+10.8 percentage points). Those who thought too much fuss had been made about

231

COVID-19 were more likely to be resistant (8.1 percentage points) or have high levels of

232

hesitancy (4.2 percentage points) and less likely to intend to get vaccinated (-14.9 percentage

233

points less likely).

234
235

In Model 4 we added political and social attitudes to demographic characteristics (see

236

Appendix). There were no statistically significant differences by levels of social trust,

237

altruism or support for authoritarianism. Compared to those who voted for the Coalition,

238

those who voted for Labor were less likely to be resistant (-1.6%, p<0.10), hesitant (high: -

239

1.5%; low: -3.2%) and more likely to intend to get vaccinated (6.3%, p = 0.05).

Those who had confidence in their state or territory government or in their hospitals and

244

of hesitancy (-4.8 and -5.2 percentage points respectively) and more likely to intend to get

245

vaccinated (11.1% and 13.0% respectively).

246
247

Those who were more religious were less likely to intend to get vaccinated. People who had

248

more populist views were more likely to be resistant or hesitant (at high or low levels) and

249

less likely to intend to get vaccinated. Finally, those who were more likely to support

250

migration were less likely to be resistant and more likely to intend to get vaccinated.

251
252

The final model included statistically significant variables from models 2 to 4 and

253

demographic variables (Table 2). Females were less likely to intend to get vaccinated while

254

those aged 55 and over were more likely to intend get vaccinated. Those with higher

255

household income were less likely to be resistant and more likely to intend to get vaccinated.

256

Differences by levels of education observed in model 1 were explained by other variables.

257

Neighbourhood differences by socio-economic index for areas were evident with those living

258

in the most disadvantaged area more likely to be resistant or hesitant (at high levels) and less

259

likely to intend to get vaccinated.

260
261

People exercising greater levels of social distancing were less likely to be resistant and more

262

likely to be vaccinated. Those who downloaded the COVID-Safe App were less likely to be

263

resistant or hesitant and more likely to intend to get vaccinated. Those who reported too

264

much fuss had been made about COVID-19 were still more likely to be resistant or hesitant

265

and less likely to intend to get vaccinated.

Those who had confidence in their state or territory government or confident in their

and more likely to intend to get vaccinated. People who were more supportive of migration

270

were more likely to get vaccinated.

271
272

Those who reported more populist views were more likely to be resistant or hesitant (at high

273

or low levels) and less likely to intend to get vaccinated. This pattern of results was also

274

evident in terms of level of religiosity although this finding should be treated with caution as

275

there was a higher level of uncertainty around the estimates (statistical significance was only

276

at the 90% level). Similarly, those living in Victoria, with by far the highest numbers of

277

COVID-19 infections in Australia in August 2020, were significantly less likely than

278

Australians from other states to get vaccinated but this was not evident in other statistical

279

modelling, bivariate analyses and should not be considered a robust finding.

Discussion

284

In August 2020 36 per cent of Australians are hesitant and 6 per cent resistant to being

285

vaccinated with a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19 if one was available. Given

286

previous research suggests that the factors associated with vaccine resistance might be

287

different to vaccine hesitancy, we examined demographic, health, COVID-19 related health

288

behaviour and attitudes, and political and social attitudinal correlates.

289
290

Many factors were associated with vaccine resistance and hesitancy. Consistent with previous

291

research, females, those with lower levels of household income and living in disadvantaged

292

areas were associated with increased likelihood of vaccine resistance or hesitancy [8, 14].

293

However, in contrast to previous research, younger people were not less likely to intend to

294

get vaccinated than those aged 35-44 years.

295
296

Less adherence to COVID-19 health behaviours was consistently associated with lower

297

likelihood of being vaccine resistant or hesitant (social distancing and downloading the

298

COVID-Safe app) and these were strongly related to vaccine intentions [14]. For example,

299

downloading the COVID-Safe app was associated with an increase of 11 percentage points in

300

the likelihood of being vaccinated. Similarly, there was a seven-percentage point increase in

301

the likelihood of intending to be vaccinated for COVID-19 if an individual moved from the

302

16th percentile in terms of social distancing to the 50th percentile (a one standard deviation

303

increase). Given that many governments have tracking surveys about social distancing, this

304

information could be used to support targeted campaigns to encourage vaccination in areas of

305

low social distancing.

306
307

Consistent with other studies of COVID-19 several variables that could be considered

308

associated with broader societal dissatisfaction and anti-establishment sentiments were also

309

associated with vaccine resistance or hesitancy. Specifically in this study, attitudes about too

310

much fuss being made about COVID-19, lack of confidence in state or territory government,

311

and having more populist sentiments [8, 16]. Other studies have also independently reported

312

that religious beliefs associated with declining a COVID-19 vaccine [14].

313
314

For many with low levels of hesitancy, providing information about the safety and efficacy of

315

the COVID-19 vaccine will be critical as other studies have highlight this as important

316

hesitancy [14]. Our analyses suggest that those with resistance or hesitancy are likely to lack

317

trust in those providing health services (e.g. state governments or health systems) and

318

therefore the misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine that will occur may be even more

319

effective for these groups. Pre-emptively using cognitive inoculation techniques and pre-

320

bunking techniques [17] to actively work against the likely misinformation that will be

321

generated in the development and preparation phase of a vaccine for COVID-19 will be

322

important but probably requires more targeted and nuanced public health messages by trusted

323

members of the community (e.g. community or religious leaders).

324
325

Those with higher vaccine resistance or hesitancy are more likely to have a set of strongly

326

held beliefs, a lack of trust in those responsible for health (state or territory government and

327

hospitals or health systems) and lower levels of compliance with public health advice for

328

COVID-19 (e.g. lower levels of social distancing, not downloading the COVID-Safe App). If

329

large scale surveys collect information on the extent of compliance with health advice,

330

further nuanced targeting could be employed. Beyond more sophisticated and nuanced public

331

health messaging, it should be noted that a systematic review of research on compulsory

332

vaccination policies suggests that the majority of the population supports these programs

333

[18]. However, none of the studies in the systematic review were conducted during a

334

pandemic where civil liberties were restricted due to lockdowns [18] and a staged approach

335

may well be more proportional [19].

336
337

While we used a rich set of variables to predict vaccine intentions some factors were not

338

collected in our surveys. In particular, we did not collect information about concerns about

339

vaccine safety which may be important determinant of vaccine hesitancy and may also

340

explain why females were more likely to be hesitant or resistant than males. Another robust

341

correlate in other studies of vaccine intentions is previous vaccination such as for influenza

342

[14]. Vaccine safety and public discourse will likely be particularly important as media and

343

public scrutiny of vaccine trials is unprecedented for COVID-19 vaccines and further

344

monitoring of public sentiment [8].

345
346

Another issue that we did not address in this paper is if there are initial shortages of a vaccine

347

how would these be distributed? A survey experiment using these participants suggests that

348

essential health workers, those with a health condition, those in areas with high levels of

349

COVID-19 and with caring responsibilities should get priority [20]. Moreover, vaccine

350

intentions of respondents did not change these priorities.

351

5

352

Given that over 75 per cent of the population are likely to need to be vaccinated with a highly

353

effective vaccine to extinguish the epidemic (Bartsch et al., 2020) our findings that only 59

354

per cent of Australians will definitely get vaccinated is sobering and suggests that as noted by

355

WHO (Hickler et al., 2020), proactive measures need to be adopted by countries to encourage

356

vaccination in the community. Our findings suggest that vaccine hesitancy, which accounts

357

for a further significant proportion of the population, and can be addressed by public health

358

messaging. However for a significant minority of the population with strongly held beliefs

359

that are the likely drivers of vaccination intentions, alternative policy measures may well be

360

needed to achieve sufficient vaccination coverage.
