ABSTRACT
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has swept through the globe at an
unprecedented rate. CRISPR-based detection technologies such as DETECTR, SHERLOCK,
and STOPCovid have emerged as a rapid and affordable platform that can shape the future of
diagnostics. Recently, we reported engineered crRNAs for Cas12a, called ENHANCE, that
enables enhanced detection of nucleic acids. Here we report development, clinical validation, and
advancement of ENHANCE platform for detecting SARS-CoV-2. With an RT-LAMP preamplification step, ENHANCE detects samples down to a single copy with 95% accuracy and
shows high specificity towards various isolates of SARS-CoV-2 against 31 highly similar and
common respiratory pathogens. Utilizing LbCas12a-mediated trans-cleavage activity, ENHANCE
works robustly in a wide range of magnesium concentration (3 mM-13 mM), allowing for further
assay optimization. Additionally, ENHANCEv2 is developed to further improve the previously
reported ENHANCE. ENHANCEv2 employs mutated LbCas12aD156R, engineered chimeric DNAextended crRNA, and a dual reporter for both fluorescence-based reporter assay and lateral flow
assay. Both ENHANCE and ENHANCEv2 are validated in 62 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs,
showing 60/62 (96.7%) agreement with RT-qPCR results, and using only 5 µL of sample and 20
minutes of CRISPR reaction. Lateral flow assay on paper strips displays 100% agreement with
fluorescence-based reporter assay in the clinical validation. Following a 30-minute preamplification RT-LAMP step, the lyophilized ENHANCEv2 is shown to achieve high sensitivity
and specificity while reducing CRISPR reaction time to as low as 3 minutes and maintaining its
detection capability upon storage at room temperature for several weeks.
INTRODUCTION
With a global pandemic of over 72 million COVID-19 cases resulting in over 1.6 million deaths,
there remains a crucial need for diagnostic tools that allow for quick yet accurate detection of
SARS-CoV-2 without the requirement of expensive equipment and extensive training (1, 2). While
vaccines are beginning to emerge from Phase III clinical trials and be granted Emergency Use
Authorizations (EUAs) by the FDA (3-7), case numbers are continuing to rise as second and third
waves occur in many countries across the globe, and with treatments still somewhat limited,
improvements in testing are more necessary than ever to keep both case numbers and fatality
numbers down in order for preventative measures to be effective down the line (8, 9).
SARS-CoV-2 is a ~30kb betacoronavirus composed of four known structural proteins, including
the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins, as well as a viral RNA
genome (10). Nucleic acid detection methods often target N, E, and RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase) genes. In quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTqPCR), the viral RNA is reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) and then amplified
through cyclic changing of temperatures to achieve denaturation of strands, annealing of primers
to the template DNA, and extension of new complementary DNA by the addition of nucleotides
by a polymerase. DNA copies are detected in real-time through the emission of fluorescence by
probes that bind to the DNA. Detection using this method requires expensive equipment, clinically
trained professionals and is not easily portable (11, 12).

CRISPR-Cas-based methods, such as SHERLOCK (Specific High sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter
unLOCKing) and DETECTR (DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter) have
recently received an EUA by the FDA. They take advantage of the collateral cleavage (trans)
activity from Class 2 Type V and Type VI Cas proteins, specifically Cas13a and Cas12a, to cleave
a FRET-based reporter resulting in fluorescence. A Cas12a-based DETECTR has a limit of
detection of around 20 copies/µL, while SHERLOCK is based on Cas13a and is time-consuming
(~1 hour, as opposed to ~30 min) but can detect ~ 6.75 copies/µL (table S1) (13-20). To amplify
the target genes while accommodating for the drawbacks of traditional PCR, both COVID-19
detection platforms pair CRISPR/Cas reactions with an antecedent isothermal amplification step,
with SHERLOCK utilizing Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) and DETECTR utilizing
Reverse Transcription Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP). The RT-LAMP,
performed at a constant temperature of 60-65°C, is significantly less time-consuming due to its
“cauliflower-like” logistic growth amplification pattern. It is also more sensitive than RPA and can
be easily adopted without supply-chain issues (21).
Here we report the clinical validation of ENHANCE system, which was developed in our previous
study (22), utilizes a similar system with a 7-nucleotide DNA extension on the 3’ end of the crRNA
to boost the collateral cleavage activity of an LbCas12a protein, enabling a significant increase in
sensitivity while maintaining specificity even at low magnesium concentrations. Similar to
DETECTR, RT-LAMP is used for a pre-amplification step prior to the CRISPR-Cas reaction, which
trans-cleaves the fluorophore from the quencher after the initial cis-cleavage of the target dsDNA.
In order to validate the ENHANCE v1 system under clinical conditions, 62 nasopharyngeal
samples (31 positive samples and 31 negative samples) were tested using both the fluorescencebased and lateral flow assays and then compared to RT-qPCR results. Further, we developed a
lyophilized a version of ENHANCEv2 system, which utilizes modified crRNAs from ENHANCE, a
mutated LbCas12a protein (Cas12aD156R) (23-26) to further amplify the signal, and a dual reporter
construct that allows each sample to be read using a fluorescence-based and a lateral flow assay
format in the same reaction. The lyophilized CRISPR reaction in ENHANCEv2 occurs at an
accelerated rate and preserves for a long period of time upon room temperature storage.
RESULTS
CRISPR-ENHANCE demonstrates robust detection across SARS-CoV-2 genes
Our previous study observed that a 3’-end chimeric DNA-extended crRNA enhanced the rate of
trans-cleavage activity (Kcat/Km) of LbCas12a by 3.2-fold thus facilitated higher sensitivity in
nucleic acid detection (fig. 1A), also known as ENHANCE (Enhanced Analysis of Nucleic acids
with CrRNA Extensions). This universal 7-mer DNA extension is spacer-independent and has
been tested in various nucleic acid targets such as GFP, HCV, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2 (22). To
detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy number, both wild-type and ENHANCE require a preamplification step such as Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RTLAMP), which reverse transcribes SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA to complementary cDNA and
convert it into dsDNA targets (14, 18).

In this study, selected regions of the SARS-CoV-2 N gene, E gene, and RdRp gene were targeted
with pairs of crRNAs (crN, crE, and crR referred to as crRNA targeting N gene, E gene, and R
gene, respectively). These designed crRNAs bear a spacer region of greater than 50% GC
content (fig. 1B and table S2). In addition to previously designed crN2, crE1, and crE2 by
Broughton et al. (14), we employed three additional crRNAs (crN1, crR1, and crR2) to not only
determine optimal crRNAs but also examine the modified LbCas12a trans-cleavage activity
compared to the wild-type system. Consistent with our previous study, when targeting SARSCoV-2 genomic RNA, the modified crRNAs (referred to as crRNA-Mod) exhibited enhanced transcleavage activity, up to 5-fold, across all targets compared to the wild-type crRNA (crRNA-WT),
indicating significantly higher fluorescence signals via the fluorophore-quencher-based reporter
assay results (figs. 1C-E). Improved activity and specificity remained consistent while detecting
multiple geographically distributed isolates (Hong Kong, USA, and Italy) (fig. 1F). The ENHANCE
system works robustly with a wide range magnesium concentration (3 mM-13 mM), and especially
at low magnesium concentration. Thus, ENHANCE enables a potential strategy for screening a
library of guide RNAs under various reaction conditions (27).
Previous study has shown that the variant LbCas12aD156R exhibited a substantially higher gene
editing efficiency compared to the wild-type LbCas12a (23-26). We hypothesized that this mutated
LbCas12aD156R would likely increase the trans-cleavage activity due to its correlation between ciscleavage and trans-cleavage capabilities. Having previously modified crRNA for enhanced
LbCas12a trans-cleavage activity, we sought to investigate if we could utilize LbCas12a D156R to
further increase the sensitivity for nucleic acid detection purposes. As a result, the combination of
LbCas12aD156R and 7-mer DNA-extended crRNA showed a significantly higher fluorescence
sensitivity than the wild-type LbCas12a and crRNA and a slight enhancement compared to the
combination of wild-type LbCas12a and modified crRNA (fig. 1G). This observation later became
the basis for the development of ENHANCEv2.
CRISPR-ENHANCE SARS-CoV-2 targeted guide RNA optimization
To seek optimal crRNAs for the ENHANCE platform, we next evaluated the limit of detection
(LoD) for the 6 selected modified crRNAs. Quantitative qPCR SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA were
utilized to make a serial dilution theoretically ranging from 200 copies/µL to 0.2 copies/µL followed
by an isothermal pre-amplification RT-LAMP step (1000 copies/rxn to 1 copy/rxn). An estimated
LoD was determined based on a criterion that the lowest copies/µL having 2/3 of replicates
showing at least 5 folds in fluorescence signal compared to that of the no-template control (NTC)
within 20 minutes. Out of the six modified crRNAs, crN2 and crE2 designed by Broughton et. al.
exhibited the lowest LoD with 0.2 copies/µL and 7.9 copies/µL, respectively (figs. 2A-D). Hence,
we selected crN2-Mod and crE2-Mod as the optimal guide RNAs for our clinical validation. The
LoDs of crN2-Mod and cRE2-Mod were confirmed by testing 20 replicates of their 1x
concentration (0.2 copies/µL and 7.9 copies/µL for crN2 and crE2, respectively) and 1x
concentration (0.4 copies/µL and 15.8 copies/µL for crN2 and crE2, respectively). The LoD was
established by observing 95% (19/20 replicates) of the target samples being positive. The
replicates of both crN2-Mod and crE2-Mod at 1x concentration yielded sufficient positive results,
reconfirming the LoD to be 0.2 copies/µL and 7.9 copies/µL, respectively, within 20 minutes of
CRISPR reaction (fig. 2E and F). These results demonstrate that the CRISPR-ENHANCE

achieved a comparable sensitivity to traditional RT-qPCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 in less than an
hour without sophisticated equipment.
As a part of exclusivity, we tested a variety of highly similar pathogens to SARS-CoV-2 (SARSCoV, MERS-CoV, Coronavirus 229E, OC43, SARS, and NL63) and respiratory pathogens
commonly detected in nasal swabs or saliva. Notably, the CRISPR-ENHANCE exhibited high
specificity towards SARS-CoV-2 with the modified crRNAs targeting N gene and E gene (fig. 2G).
No cross reactivity was observed in any of the 31 tested pathogens.
Validation of ENHANCEv1 in patient samples
Having tested detection using the SARS-CoV-2 heat-inactivated virus and genomic RNA for
crRNA optimization and LoD determination, we sought to validate the ENHANCEv1 in patient
samples to determine whether it still maintains robust detection with clinical conditions. We tested
a total of 62 nasal swab samples in which 31 samples were predetermined SARS-CoV-2 positives
and the other 31 samples negative. Samples were randomly selected out of the pool and blinded
prior to viral RNA extraction. Similar to DETECTR (14), RNAse P gene was used as an internal
control for all the nasal swab samples. For the real-time fluorescence-based reporter detection,
the criterion for a positive sample is a change in fluorescence signal of 5-fold or greater compared
to non-template control (NTC) samples within 20 minutes. Consistent with previous observation,
the EHANCEv1 demonstrated a higher sensitivity across all positive samples at low magnesium
concentration in a shorter amount of time (fig. 3A). Furthermore, the ENHANCEv1 achieved a
96.7% overall accuracy with a false positive rate and a false negative rate of 3.3% and 3.3%,
respectively (fig. S1 and table S3). For lateral flow-based detection, the ENHANCEv1 showed
100% in agreement with the real-time fluorescence-based reporter assay. Similarly, the false
positive and false negative rates for this assay were both 3.3% (figs. 3B and S2, S3).
Lyophilized ENHANCEv2 significantly reduces CRISPR reaction time
We further developed a CRISPR-ENHANCEv2 by combining ENHANCEv1 with the mutated
LbCas12aD156R and a dual reporter comprising a fluorophore FAM, biotin, and a quencher. This
reporter can be used as a fluorescence-based reporter as well as a lateral flow-based reporter,
both in a single detection assay (fig. 4A). A typical CRISPR reaction requires complexation of
crRNA and LbCas12a prior to addition of pre-amplified activator. Therefore, we initially sought to
understand whether the complexation of crRNA and LbCas12a can be achieved and remain
stable for a period of time prior to testing. If successful, large batches of pre-complexed
crRNA:LbCas12a can be manufactured to reduce reaction time and minimize the need for
specialized training. We explored if lyophilization can accomplish this objective. Optimal
concentrations of crRNA and LbCas12aD156R were pre-complexed in a mixture containing dual
reporter and cleavage buffer. This combined mixture was prepared in different pilot scales: 1
reaction, 5 reactions, and 20 reactions (fig. 4B). By conducting a time study, we observed that
these lyophilized pre-complexes maintain high trans-cleavage activity as the liquid version and
remain stable for up to 30 days upon storage at room temperature (figs. 4C and S5A). These
results help enable scale-up manufacturing, ease of transportation, storage, and reduction in
preparation time.

Surprisingly, we also observed a significant decrease in reaction time. Using lyophilized CRISPR
reaction stored at -20°C after 2.5 months for the fluorescence reporter assay, the fluorescence
signal can be seen by naked eyes under blue light after 2 minutes (fig. 4D). When applying the
lyophilized ENHANCEv2 towards 62 patient samples, we were able to accurately detect the same
62 patient nasal swab samples with >5-fold change in fluorescence compared to NTC samples in
as low as 2.5 minutes (fig. 3F and S4), bringing a total reaction time to 33 minutes (30 minutes of
RT-LAMP). This phenomenon strongly suggests that pre-complexed LbCas12a-crRNA promotes
faster and easier assay setup.
DISCUSSION
In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, detection and vaccine developments become the two
important pillars of research to eradicate the disease (28, 29). At the time of preparing this
manuscript, the first vaccine developed by Pfizer has been granted emergency authorization by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This news gives hope to combat the COVID-19 disease
that has already caused great damage to our community. However, it will take months for the
vaccine to get in the hands of million people; therefore, COVID-19 testing remains a necessary
tool to track the severity of the spread and to follow up the population post-vaccination. Many
CRISPR-based detection platforms such as DETECTR, SHERLOCK, and STOPCovid have
emerged as an alternative to traditional RT-qPCR assays due to their rapid, affordable, and
sensitive capabilities (14, 18, 30). Here, we developed ENHANCEv2, an engineered CRISPRbased diagnostic platform to detect SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples with high sensitivity and
specificity. Similar to the DETECTR system, ENHANCE utilized a robust trans-cleavage capability
of Cas12a towards detection (13, 14).
ENHANCEv1 consists of a chimeric 7-mer TA-rich extension the 3’-end of crRNA and wild-type
LbCas12a. Our previous study has shown that this modified CRISPR-Cas system significantly
enhances Lbcas12a trans-cleavage activity while slightly improving its specificity (22). The
theoretical limit of detection for ENHANCEv1 was determined to be 0.2 copies/µL and 7.9
copies/µL for N gene and E gene, respectively, achieving single molecule sensitivity in a sample
volume as small as 5 µL with 95% accuracy. This engineered system also exhibited high
specificity towards SARS-CoV-2 when tested against highly similar and commonly circulating
pathogens. Finally, ENHANCEv1 was used to validate 62 patient samples in this work, with 60/62
patients in agreement with RT-qPCR results. One false negative and one false positive were
observed in 31 negative and 31 positive samples for both fluorescence-based reporter and lateral
flow assay, showing a total of 96.7% accuracy. We encountered some challenging results during
clinical validation of ENHANCEv1 and ENHANCEv2 with 62 patient samples. Patient sample p01
was pre-determined as negative upon arrival in our lab. The sample also indicated as negative
with our ENHANCE assay, but revalidation with RT-qPCR assay indicated it as a positive sample.
Therefore, we concluded that the sample was a false negative based on our analysis approach.
For patient sample p43, both ENHANCE and RT-qPCR assays agreed that the sample was
negative with SARS-CoV-2, but it was pre-determined as a positive sample. Thus, we concluded
this sample was negative. The patient sample p12 was predetermined to be a negative sample
and was detected negative with the qPCR, however, it was consistently detected as positive by
ENHANCE v1 and v2 methods. Therefore, we concluded it as a false positive. Finally, QC failure

was observed while testing samples p32, p38, and p62 as fluorescence signals for the RNase P
control gene did not show up. However, we were able to successfully detect these samples upon
the second round of RNA extraction.
We developed ENHANCEv2 to further improve the testing capability of ENHANCEv1.
ENHANCEv2 is comprised of a 7-mer DNA extension on the 3’-end of crRNA, a mutated
LbCas12aD156R, and a dual reporter that can be used for both fluorescence-based reporter and
lateral flow assays. The dual reporter enables detection of clinical samples in two different assay
formats that can be potentially used for conducting a high-throughput lab-based as well as a rapid
point-of-care-based test using a single CRISPR kit (fig. S5B). ENHANCEv2 was used to test the
same 62 patient samples, showing 100% agreement with ENHANCEv1 while reducing CRISPR
reaction time to as low as 3 minutes. Furthermore, unlike ENHANCEv1, the ENHANCEv2 does
not require a crRNA/Cas pre-incubation step, saving 15-20 minutes of time and labor. These
results were achieved by lyophilizing pre-complexed crRNA:LbCas12a in advance. The
lyophilized version of ENHANCEv2 not only accelerates CRISPR reaction speed significantly but
also remains stable for several weeks upon storage at room temperature.
Similar to SHERLOCK and DETECTR, a major drawback to this technology is the possibility of
carryover contamination. CRISPR-based detection system provides two check points for
detection: (1) an isothermal pre-amplification step such as RT-LAMP that converts SARS-CoV-2
genomic RNA into millions of dsDNA copies and (2) CRISPR reaction where crRNA:LbCas12a
complex targets the amplified dsDNA. Since this detection platform is not a continuous step,
contamination might occur. Therefore, proper reaction setup must be met. This major
disadvantage motivated us to develop ENHANCEv2. ENHANCEv2 uses RT-LAMP master mix
containing UDG which has been shown to greatly eliminate carryover contamination. The
lyophilized CRISPR version not only significantly reduces the reaction time but also simplifies the
needs for CRISPR reaction setup. The reaction can be reconstituted with the addition of RNasefree water and RT-LAMP products. The method further promotes large-scale manufacturing,
eases the challenge of reagent storage and handling, and would enable easier deployment across
the globe.
CONCLUSIONS
The ENHANCEv2 offers a rapid, sensitive, and affordable test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in
clinical samples. The improved capability and stability of ENHANCEv2 would be pivotal for
global deployment towards curbing the COVID-19 pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein Expression and Purification
LbCas12a gene fragment was obtained by PCR from the plasmid LbCpf1-2NLS as a gift from
Jennifer Doudna (Addgene plasmid # 102566) (31) and subcloned into a linearized CL7-tagged
vector (Plasmid #21, TriAltus Bioscience) digested with HindIII and XhoI. The fragments assembly
was performed using NEBHiFi Builder (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. The assembled plasmid was transformed into DH5ɑ (New England Biolabs) competent
cells. Individual colonies were picked the next day and inoculated in 10 ml of LB broth, Miller
(Fisher Scientific) at 37oC overnight. Cells were harvested, and plasmids were extracted and
purified using the Monarch Mini Plasmid prep (New England Biolabs).
For protein expression, 100 ng of the purified plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) competent
cells (New England Biolabs). Individual colonies were picked and inoculated in 10 ml of Terrific
Broth (TB) at 37oC for 8-10 hours. The culture was then added to 1L TB broth containing 50 µg/ml
Kanamycin (Fisher Scientific) and 50 µL antifoam 204 (Sigma Aldrich) and let grown until OD600
= 0.6. The culture was then taken out of the 37oC incubator and let cooled on ice for 30-45
minutes. Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Fisher Scientific) was added to the culture
and let grown at 18oC overnight.
The overnight culture was centrifuged to collect cell pellets the next day. They were resuspended
in Lysis Buffer A (2M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 7.5, 0.5 mM TCEP, 5% Glycerol, 1mM PMSF,
0.25 mg/ml lysozyme). The mixture was disrupted by sonication, centrifuged at 40000 x g, and
filtered through a 0.45 µm filter. The lysate was run through a 1 ml CL7/Im7 column (TriAltus
Bioscience) connected to the FPLC Biologic Duoflow system (Bio-Rad). The column was washed
for at least 3 cycles of alternating Wash Buffer B (2M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 7.5, 0.5 mM
TCEP, 5% Glycerol) and Wash Buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 7.5, 0.5 mM TCEP, 5% Glycerol).
The column was then eluted by adding 5 mL of SUMO protease (purified from plasmid pCDB302
as a gift from Christopher Bahl, Addgene plasmid# 113673) (32) and flown through in a closedloop cycle at 30oC for 1.5 hours. (Optional) To remove SUMO protease, the eluted solution was
then concentrated using a 30 kDa MWCO Sartorius Vivaspin Concentrator to 500 µL and subject
to size exclusion chromatography in SEC buffer (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 7.5, 0.5
mM TCEP) via the Superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva). Eluted fractions were
collected, pooled together, concentrated, quantified using the NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher), snap
frozen in dry ice, and stored at -80oC until use.
For LbCas12aD156R expression and purification, the CL7-tagged plasmid obtained by subcloning
above was mutated using the Q5® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. The protein expression and purification were the same as
described above.
Lyophilization of ENHANCEv2 CRISPR reaction
To make one CRISPR reaction, reagents were mixed in the following order:

This recipe was scaled up accordingly to make 5x and 20x reaction aliquots. These aliquots were
then subject to lyophilization using the Labconco freeze dryer for 2-4 days.
CDC RT-qPCR assay
Patient samples were obtained from University of Florida (UF) Clinical and Translational Science
Institute and Boca Biolistics by following the guidelines listed in the approved UF Institutional
Review Board protocol (IRB202000781). The samples were re-validated with real time RT-qPCR.
The reactions were performed using the CDC recommended Quantabio qScript XLT One-Step
RT-qPCR ToughMix (Catalog# 95132-100) and TaqMan probes and primer sets (add citation)
and measured using the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System. RT-qPCR quantification was performed
using amplification plots generated by the ViiA 7 software.
Viral nucleic acid extraction
For crRNA screening and optimization, LoD estimation, inclusivity testing and specificity testing,
viral RNA extraction was performed using the Lucigen QuickExtract™ DNA Extraction Solution
(Cat # QE09050). Viral samples were diluted with QuickExtract™ in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio and incubated
at 65°C for 15 min and 98°C for 2 min.
For clinical validation experiments, all patient samples were extracted using Maxwell® RSC 16
automated nucleic acid extraction instrument. Maxwell® RSC Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification
Kit (Cat# AS1330, as recommended by CDC) was used for all extractions following
manufacturer’s protocol.
RT-LAMP reactions
A set of 6 LAMP primers were designed for each gene using the freely available PrimerExplorer
software (https://primerexplorer.jp/e/) (33). The designed primers were synthesized by Integrated
DNA Technologies. A 10x primer mix for each gene was created by mixing the 6 primers to a final
concentration of 1.6 µM (FIP/BIP), 0.8 µM (LB/LF) and 0.2 µM (F3/B3). RT-LAMP reactions were
performed using the WarmStart® Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs). RT-

crRNA screening and optimization of ENHANCE for detection of SARS-CoV-2.
Genomic RNA from SARS-CoV-2, Isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52285) obtained from Biodefense
and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository (BEI resources), was spiked in nucleic
acid extract obtained from a healthy donor. The spiked extract was amplified for the target genes
(N1, N2, E1, E2, R1 and R2) using RT-LAMP. The amplified products were then detected using
wild type CRISPR/Cas12a as well as CRISPR ENHANCEv1.
Inclusivity Testing
SARS-CoV-2 Genomic RNA of isolates obtained from different geographic regions such as Italy,
Hong Kong and USA (NR-52498, NR-52388 and NR-52285) obtained from BEI resources were
spiked in nucleic acid extract obtained from the nasopharyngeal swab of a healthy donor. Target
genes were amplified using RT-LAMP protocol described earlier and detected using CRISPR
ENHANCEv1.
Specificity testing
To demonstrate specificity of our assay towards SARS-CoV-2 we obtained 31 highly similar and
commonly circulating pathogens from ZeptoMetrix (Cat# NATPPQ-BIO, Cat# NATRVP-3, Cat#
NATPPA-BIO). Each pathogen was spiked in a matrix composed of nasopharyngeal swab from
a healthy donor. The spiked nasal swab was extracted using Lucigen QuickExtract™ and target
genes within the extracted nucleic acids were amplified using RT-LAMP. The amplified products
were detected using CRISPR ENHANCEv1.

Estimation of LoD
Nasopharyngeal swab sample from a healthy donor was mixed with an equal volume of Lucigen
QuickExtract™ DNA Extraction Solution (Cat # QE09050) and incubated at 65°C for 15 min and
98°C for 2 min to extract nucleic acids from the swab. Mock clinical patient samples were prepared
by serially diluting the nucleic acid extract with Quantitative PCR (qPCR) Control RNA from HeatInactivated SARS-Related Coronavirus 2 (BEI NR-52347) to a final concentration range of 200
copies/µL to 0.2 copies/µL. The LoD for each gene was determined by amplifying the gene using
RT-LAMP and then detecting it at the indicated concentrations with CRISPR ENHANCEv1. The
LoDs for N2 gene and E2 gene were confirmed by testing with 20 replicates at 1x and 2x of the
previously estimated LoD for each gene.
Fluorescence-based reporter detection assay
All fluorescence-based detection experiments were performed in a 384-well plate. The following
recipe was used for CRISPR/Cas complexation:

plate containing 0.2 µL of 100 µM Fluorophore-Quencher (FQ), 25.8 µL of nuclease-free water
and 2 µL of RT-LAMP product. Emitted fluorescence resulting from Cas12a based trans-cleavage
was measured using BioTek Synergy 2 microplate reader with fluorescence measurement at
excitation and emission wavelengths of 485/20 and 528/20, respectively, every 2.5 minutes. For
a 96-well plate format all reagents are scaled up 2.5 times.

2 µL of the corresponding RT-LAMP product was added to the above mixture and incubated at
37°C for 20 minutes. A paper strip is then dipped in the reaction tube and the presence or absence
of the target gene is determined based on a visual readout after 2 mins. Lateral flow band signals
were later quantified by ImageJ.
Clinical validation of patient samples using CRISPR ENHANCE
62 patient samples underwent a blind test. Random samples were selected from the pool, and
nucleic acids extracted from those patient samples were subjected to RT-LAMP based
amplification of N2 gene, E2 gene and RNASE-P gene. The same amplified RT-LAMP products
were then detected using both the fluorescence-based reporter detection assay and the lateral
flow assay with ENHANCEv1 and with the lyophilized ENHANCEv2.
