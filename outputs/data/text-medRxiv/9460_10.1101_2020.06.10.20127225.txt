Identifying and Ranking Common COVID-19 Symptoms from
Arabic Twitter
Abstract
Background: Massive amount of covid-19 related data is generated everyday by
Twitter users. Self-reports of covid-19 symptoms on Twitter can reveal a great deal
about the disease and its prevalence in the community. In particular, self-reports
can be used as a valuable resource to learn more about the common symptoms and
whether their order of appearance differs among different groups in the community.
With sufficient available data, this has the potential of developing a covid-19 riskassessment system that is tailored toward specific group of people.

NOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.

Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the most common symptoms reported
by covid-19 patients in the Arabic language and order the symptoms appearance
based on the collected data.
Methods: We search the Arabic content of Twitter for personal reports of covid-19
symptoms from March 1st to May 27th, 2020. We identify 463 Arabic users who
tweeted testing positive for covid-19 and extract the symptoms they publicly
associate with covid-19. Furthermore, we ask them directly through personal
messages to opt in and rank the appearance of the first three symptoms they
experienced right before (or after) diagnosed with covid-19. Finally, we track their
Twitter timeline to identify additional symptoms that were mentioned within ±5
days from the day of tweeting having covid-19. In summary, a list of 270 covid-19
reports were collected and symptoms were (at least partially) ranked from early to
late.
Results:
The collected reports contained roughly 900 symptoms originated from 74%
(n=201) male and 26% (n=69) female Twitter users. The majority (82%) of the
tracked users were living in Saudi Arabia (46%) and Kuwait (36%). Furthermore,
13% (n=36) of the collected reports were asymptomatic. Out of the users with
symptoms (n=234), 66% (n=180) provided a chronological order of appearance for
at least three symptoms.
Fever 59% (n=139), Headache 43% (n=101), and Anosmia 39% (n=91) were found
to be the top three symptoms mentioned by the reports. They count also for the top3 common first symptoms in a way that 28% (n=65) said their covid journey started
with a Fever, 15% (n=34) with a Headache and 12% (n=28) with Anosmia. Out of
the Saudi symptomatic reported cases (n=110), the most common three symptoms
were Fever 59% (n=65), Anosmia 42% (n=46), and Headache 38% (n=42).
Conclusions:
This study demonstrates that Twitter is a valuable resource to analyze and identify
COVID-19 early symptoms within the Arabic content of Twitter. It also suggests the
possibility of developing a real-time covid-19 risk estimator based on the users’
tweets.

Introduction
The ongoing vigorous COVID-19 outbreak has shown a great impact on human
health and well-being and radically enforced a rigorous change in societies lifestyle

undermining their prosperity. Along with this catastrophe, we have witnessed a
great effort from diverse research communities to study this disease in all its
aspects.
In recent years, social networks have become an unignorable source of information
where users expose and share ideas, opinions, thoughts, and experiences on a
multitude of topics. Several researches have utilized the abundance of information
offered by social platforms to conduct non-clinical medical research. For example,
Twitter has been the source for data for many health and medical studies; such as
surveillance and monitoring of Flu and Cancer timeline and distribution across the
USA using Twitter [1], analyzing the spread of influenza in the UAE based on geotagged Arabic Tweets [2], surveillance and monitoring of Influenza in the UAE based
on Arabic and English tweets [3], identifying symptoms and disease in Saudi Arabia
using Twitter [4], and most recently on analyzing COVID-19 symptoms on Twitter
[5] and analyzing the chronological and geographical distribution of COVID-19
infected tweeters in the USA [6].
Twitter platform enables obtaining multiple features (such as age, sex, geo-location,
… etc.) along with informative messages that using appropriate data mining and
analysis techniques can potentially result in useful insights about a specific health
condition [7]. Extracting common symptoms associated with a disease from
publicly available data has the potential to control the spread of the disease and
identify users at high risk. It also gives new insights that call for early intervention
and control. For example, Figure 1 highlights a tweet (from Saudi Arabia)
mentioning explicitly the loss of smell and taste as one distinctive symptom of
covid-19. The national-wide self-testing questionnaire App was updated almost
couple of weeks after the tweet to include the loss smell and taste as one potential
sign for covid-19 [8]. Tracking covid-19 symptoms in real-time from public data on
Twitter could have shorten the gap.
Figure 1: A covid-19 survivor tweets about how the loss of smell and taste was the
only common sign among all of her family members.

In this paper, we study COVID-19 symptoms as reported by Arabic tweeters.
Initially, we shuffled Arabic tweets and searching for tweets with COVID-19
symptoms and also collected tweets for users who reported themselves infected
through clinical test. In addition, we asked users who have been marked infected
about the first three symptoms they experienced via a voluntary survey template
sent over private message.

Methods

Our method for data collection is outlined in Figure 1. We search Twitter for
personal reports of covid-19 from March 1st, 2020 to May 27, 2020 using two Arabic
keywords ‫ إﺻﺎﺑﺗﻲ‬and ‫ ﺗﺷﺧﯾﺻﻲ‬which translates roughly to “I have been diagnosed”.
Suck keywords are likely to filter out reports that were not associated with a formal
test result. An initial list of 463 users were collected and two independent
freelancers were asked to further read users’ timeline and extract symptoms that
were explicitly mentioned to be related to covid and their order of appearance if
mentioned. Additional information such as user gender, date of infection, and the
country of residence were also collected. We assume the date of tweeting being
covid-19 positive is the date of infection in case no other information were available.
Figure 2: Data collection steps.

A final list of 270 covid-19 users were identified amongst 80 were sharing their
symptoms publicly. To further understand the chronological order of the symptoms,

we asked through Twitter personal messages users to order the first three
symptoms they experienced right before or after tested positive for covid-19.
We record the symptoms from first to last based on the received responses and
what is available publicly on the users’ tweets. In case no order was given, an
implicit order is assumed following the order of which the symptoms were
mentioned by the user.
Tracking tweets containing specific keywords is simply not enough to have the big
picture about the disease dynamics [9]. Many patients detail their experience while
infected, hence, knowing their health condition, sentiment, and tracking useful
information may lead to a better understanding of the disease symptoms. In
particular, we found tweets that were posted within ±5 days of infection date to
contain valuable information about early symptoms, allowing us to process and
rank the symptoms. Figure 3 highlights three tweets by three different covid-19
patients that indirectly relate symptoms before or after diagnosed with covid-19.
For simplicity, we set a fake date (28 Apr, 2020) for all the three using the TweetGen
service [10]. User..1 was tested positive on Apr 26 and tweeted on Apr 28 about the
loss of smell. User…2 tested positive May 1st, three days after complaining about a
headache. User..3 tested positive Apr 29th, one day after tweeting her wish to be able
to taste the food.

Figure 3: Example of tweets collected within ±5 days of the user tweeting being
covid-19 positive

The example highlighted in Figure 3 demonstrates that mining twitter for covid
symptoms require more than a simple keyword search. In principle, the context of
the tweet, narrated by a covid-19 patient, is also important. Therefore, it is
important to look not only the verbatim of the tweet but also to its context. To build
a high-quality database of covid symptoms based on Arabic tweets, we have relied
on manual symptoms extraction. However, we have used Twitter API to construct a

social network graph for the 270 users and the software Gephi [11] to visualize the
resulted graph.

Results
The majority of the cases were recorded in May (78%, n=210), followed by April
(14%, n=39) and March (8%, n=21). This surge of May reports is understandable as
most of world countries, let alone the Arabic speaking countries, witnessed a great
increase in the number of confirmed cases. As for the demography, users from Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, and UAE constitute 85% of reports with Saudi Arabia being the
largest cluster of reports (46%). The other countries (Egypt, Iraq, Bahrain, Qatar,
UK, USA, Belgum, and Germany) together constitute the remaining 15%. Needless to
say, some of the adopted strategies to prevent further spread of the virus (e.g.,
active screening by the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia [12]) may also helped in
finding more reports in May compared to other months. We have witnessed this
firsthand as some of the asymptomatic reports were mainly a result of early active
screening.
The fact that almost half of the reports came from Saudi Arabia is not surprising as
its one of the top countries participating on Twitter with more than 15 million users
[13]. We have collected almost 900 symptoms from the 270 reports (as shown in
Figure 4). The daily number of collected tweets is also highlighted in Figure 5.
Figure 4 indicates that most of the reported cases experience between 2 to 5
symptoms, whereas 13% of the reported cases were asymptomatic. Table 1 lists the
frequency of each symptom ordered from the most prevalent symptom to the least.
Only Fever experienced by more than 50% of the patients. The frequency of
symptoms appears to be consistent across male and female patients (Corr. Coeff.
=0.966). Further, Table 2 lists the top three most reported symptoms. Fever and
headache were commonly the first reported symptoms. The top 4 symptoms that
coincide with fever were headache (23.7%), cough (14.4%) anosmia (13.7%), and
ageusia (12.2%). Other symptoms have relatively lower frequency with fever. In
addition, Table 3 lists the top-8 common symptoms for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
which correspond for about 81.2 % of the reports. The symptoms have a Corr. Coeff.
of 0.835 between the two countries.

We have constructed a social graph for the users to discover insights related covid19 communities in social networks as shown in Figure 6. An edge between X and Y
represents the fact that X follows Y or Y follows X or both follow each other on
Twitter. Saudi cases were colored in green while the Kuwait cases are blue and
orange for other places of residence. The graph shows 164 nodes each node with a
size proportional to its degree in the graph. The remaining users were found to be
disconnected from all other users and thus removed from the network. It was built
by the software Gephi [11] and relations were extracted by Twitter API. Clearly,
Kuwait users are more connected compared to others and some form a clique of
three or more users.

Discussion
This work identified common covid-19 symptoms from Arabic personal reports on
Twitter. Such study complements other recent studies [5-6,9] that were focused on
English tweets or specific demographic groups. The study was carried in a way to
report not only the symptoms but their timeline as narrated by users.
Social networks have become the de facto communication channel for large number
of people. Many individuals around the globe write, interact, or even just browse the
content of the social networks countless times a day. Social networks have the
property of being continuously updated by new information provided by other
global citizens. As such, it is crucial to monitor their content to identify health issues
[14-15]. One potential benefit of analyzing social networks is understanding covid19 symptoms and identifying people at high risk [7].
Anosmia being one of the top three reported symptoms, mentioned in 39% of the
reports, was a surprising result in our study. Several tweets complained how long it
lasted before they started to smell again. Our sample size is still relatively small to
make any good judgement in this regard. However, recent clinical studies have
reported finding Anosmia in 35.7% of the mild cases of covid-19 [16] which is
relatively close to our estimation from Arabic tweets. Indeed, the size of self-reports
reflect the testing capacity in different countries. As of June 9, 2020, Saudi Arabia
has done almost one million tests and Kuwait has roughly exceeded 350,000 tests
[17].
Limitations
The reported cases from Egypt, the Arabic country with largest population, were
inadequately representative. This could be attributed to factors such as the
preferred social platform (e.g., Facebook), the dialect and use of local idioms.
Our study tracked two widely used keywords to identify Arabic covid-19 patients on
Twitter then manually extract symptoms. More complex keywords could reveal
more interesting patterns about symptoms, and this brings the need to establish a
comprehensive medical dictionary for different local Arabic dialect. The dictionary
can be utilized when mining different health opinions and conditions from the
Arabic content in social networks.
Our main motivation is to extract symptoms from users who are likely took the
disease test and, hence, tweeted based on its result. In this study, we have not used
other covid-19 sources. Specifically, studying the Arabic content of personal reports
from both Facebook and Twitter will enrich the study.

The noticeable increase in May reports compared to other months show the
importance of developing a real-time surveillance system based on the symptoms
reported by the Arabic content of Twitter. It also suggests further studies into the
information sharing behavior [19] in different communities and.

Conclusion
The collected tweets of symptoms provided some insights into covid-19 symptoms
and their chronological order. We have shown the most common symptoms
associated with Arabic self-reports of symptoms. We have analyzed the first, second,
and third common symptom experienced by the users. Furthermore, we analyzed
symptoms prevalence in the two largest clusters found in our database: Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait.
