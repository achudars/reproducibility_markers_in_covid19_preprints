Abstract
More than a billion people live in densely-populated informal settlements worldwide. Crowded
living conditions and limited resources may render these populations vulnerable to the health and
economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Representative and longitudinal survey data are
needed to accurately measure impacts in these populations, but such data are scarce. Using
satellite data and spatial sampling to ensure representativeness, we use longitudinal survey data
on 1,033 households comprising 3,681 individuals collected pre- and post-pandemic to measure
the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic households in six areas of the informal
settlement of Kibera, Nairobi. The economic impacts are sizable and long-lasting. Household
incomes declined at the start of the pandemic by 59% (95% CI: 50% to 69%) and remained 21%
(95% CI: 13% to 28%) below the baseline level after six months. Respondents primarily
attributed these declines in income to fewer labor market opportunities or lower demand for
services, rather than the direct health impacts of the pandemic. The findings raise serious
concerns about the welfare consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for residents of informal
settlements.

Summary box:
•

Residents of informal settlements may be highly vulnerable to the economic impacts of
the COVID-19 pandemic, but the longitudinal and representative survey data needed to
measure impacts in these populations are scarce.

•

We use an innovative spatial sampling strategy to collect representative survey data from
residents in six areas of the informal settlement of Kibera, Nairobi.

•

Relative to a pre-pandemic baseline, household incomes declined by 59% on average
during the first three months of the pandemic. Six months later, incomes were still 21%
below baseline.

•

Households attributed declines in income primarily to fewer labour market opportunities
or lower demand for services (43% of respondents) rather than the direct health impacts
of the pandemic (1%).

•

The declines in income we document raise concerns about the welfare of residents of
informal settlements during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
Worldwide, more than a billion people live in densely-populated informal settlements, of
which just under a quarter live in sub-Saharan Africa (1). The well-being of these populations
may be particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cramped living conditions and
dependence on often-limited communal water and sanitation facilities increase vulnerability to
infectious disease transmission, while many household’s incomes were insufficient to meet daily
household needs even before the pandemic, implying a high level of vulnerability to
interruptions in income (2). However, due to a lack of census data making it difficult to identify
a representative sample and the high mobility of these populations, to date no representative
longitudinal cohort studies have quantified the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on
residents of informal settlements (3-9).

Pre- and post- COVID-19 pandemic data for a representative sample of resident
households in an informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya
We analyzed data from a longitudinal survey of a representative cohort of 1,218
households (comprising 3,907 individuals) residing at six 100m-radius sites in the informal
settlement of Kibera, Nairobi (Figure 1a). Kibera is Nairobi’s most populous informal
settlement, located close to the city centre. The majority of dwellings are poorly-ventilated single
room homes (10). Seroprevalence studies suggest that transmission in Kibera was likely to have
been widespread during the study period (11, 12).
The cohort was initially created prior to the pandemic to study the impacts of flooding in
informal settlements. Given the lack of reliable population census data, we constructed a
representative sample in two steps. First, we randomly sampled building structures from satellite

images (Figure 1b and 1c). Second, enumerators visited sampled structures to enumerate
dwellings (Figure 1d), and we randomly sampled dwellings for interviews. After establishing a
representative baseline sample, enumerators administered subsequent rounds of surveys
approximately every six months by returning to the same dwellings and interviewing current
residents. We use data from pre-COVID survey rounds that were conducted in-person between
October 2019 and March 2020; during the pandemic, survey rounds were conducted by mobile
phone between April 2020 and October 2020.
Respondents were asked to report their household income, whether that income was
sufficient for their household's needs, and reasons for changes to their income in all survey
waves. Questions on respondents' adoption of social distancing behaviors and self-reported
health symptoms were added during the pandemic.
In the primary analysis, we restricted the sample to the subset of households (85% of
1,218 households) who were surveyed at least once before and once after the COVID-19
pandemic began in March 2020. We examined whether there were changes in mean household
income between October 2019 and October 2020 using a linear regression model with
adjustment for household fixed effects to account for pre-pandemic differences between
households in income. Sampling weights were applied in order to account for stratification in the
sampling strategy, and standard errors were clustered by the primary sampling unit (building
structure). We examined the sensitivity of our results to potential bias from secular trends in
mean household income, seasonal variation in household income, and non-random loss-to-follow
up.

Analyses were performed in Stata v16 (StataCorp). Participation in the study was
voluntary, and analyses were conducted on anonymized data. The Kenyan National Commission
for Science, Technology & Innovation approved this study.

Household incomes declined at the start of the pandemic and had not recovered after six
months.
The final sample consisted of 1,033 households comprising 3,681 individuals, with a
median (IQR) age of 21 (10-33) and 49.8% female. Prior to the pandemic, enumerators
completed a field interview with a respondent inhabitant in 87% of randomly sampled occupied
dwellings. During the pandemic, enumerators successfully surveyed 85% of previous
respondents.
Relative to the six-month period preceding the pandemic, self-reported weekly household
income declined by 59% (95% CI: 50% to 69%) from 2324 KSh (US$21) to 1417 KSh (US$13)
during April to July 2020 (Figure 2). By September 2020, self-reported household income partly
rebounded but remained 21% (95% CI: 13% to 28%) below the baseline level. The fraction of
households reporting income sufficient for their needs declined by 49% (95% CI: 34% to 64%)
from 18% to 9% during April to July 2020, relative to the baseline period (Supplemental Figure
1).
During the pandemic period, the most commonly-cited expenses for which household
incomes were insufficient were rent and food. Additionally, 27% of households reported their
income was insufficient for healthcare expenses and 46% reported their income was insufficient
to obtain drinking water (Figure 3). Households attributed their reduced income to fewer labor
market opportunities or lower demand for services during the pandemic (43%, the most

commonly cited reason), rather than to the direct impacts of the lockdown on their own mobility
(8.6%) or the direct health impacts of the pandemic (1.2%) (Figure 4).
Respondents also reported limited ability to adopt protective behaviors during the
pandemic. Nearly all respondents (88% between April and July 2020, rising to 95% between
September and October 2020) reported needing to access congregant settings to obtain food or
water or for sanitation. The share of individuals reporting at least one symptom among fever, a
dry cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia at the time of survey averaged 5% between April and
October.

Estimated drops in income are unlikely to be explained by secular trends, seasonal
variation, or non-random loss to follow-up.
The estimated decline in household income was unchanged across sensitivity analyses
accounting for secular trends, seasonal variation, and non-random loss-to-follow up. Before the
COVID-19 pandemic, mean household income was stable or increasing, suggesting that the
decline in income during the pandemic was not driven by pre-existing trends (Supplemental
Figures 2 and 3). The estimated decline in income during the pandemic was essentially
unchanged when adjusting for seasonal variation in income using season and quarter-of-year
fixed effects (Supplemental Figure 3). Our main result, which included movers, was
unchanged after excluding movers from the analysis and when limiting the sample to a fully
balanced panel that only included households that were successfully surveyed in every wave
(Supplemental Figure 4). Finally, although response rates were high, the estimated change in
incomes could be biased if those respondents who could not be interviewed by phone during the
pandemic experienced larger or smaller changes in income than those who were interviewed.

Reassuringly, there was no correlation between the number of times enumerators had to call
respondents in order to secure an interview between April and July 2020 and the respondent’s
change in household income during versus before the pandemic. If respondents who could not be
reached were similar to respondents who were most difficult to reach, this suggests non-random
loss-to-follow up is unlikely to explain the observed decline in income during the first months of
the pandemic. However, during September and October 2020, respondents who were harder to
reach reported a greater recovery in income, possibly because these respondents had returned to
the labor force. This pattern suggests that we might underestimate the recovery in income in
September and October 2020 (Supplemental Figure 5).

Conclusion
In this longitudinal cohort study of residents of informal settlements in Kenya, we
observed a 59% reduction in household income during the COVID-19 pandemic that had yet to
recover to baseline levels after six months.
Study limitations include that our study sample is representative of the six sites within the
informal settlement but not of the whole settlement of Kibera. We note that we were able to
achieve relatively high response rates because of intensive long-term engagement in the six
communities. Furthermore, the six communities are distributed across Kibera and the change in
income was similar in all communities. There was limited scope to further increase response
rates during the pandemic conditions; in cases where enumerators could not reach respondents,
they made on average 8.5 attempts to do so. Nonetheless, if loss to follow-up

was correlated

with changes in income, it could potentially introduce bias into our estimated effects on changes
in income. Additionally, since no objective measures of income exist for this population, we

depended on self-reported measures of income. However, the effects we observe are consistent
across different self-reported measures, suggesting that the results are unlikely to be artefacts of
a specific measurement process.
Further research should investigate the long-run consequences of the short-term losses in
income we observed, with the aim of understanding how different policy choices might mitigate
income losses among residents of informal settlements during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
and future pandemics.
While the longer-term consequences for welfare remain unknown, the scale of the
reduction in income we observed raises serious concerns about the well-being of highly
vulnerable residents of informal settlements in sub-Saharan Africa during the pandemic.
