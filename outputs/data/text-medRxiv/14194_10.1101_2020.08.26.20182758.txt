Précis:
The mean-effects of Covid-19 mandated social interventions were found to have no affect the maximum
slope of the daily mortality nor the overall mortality but did correlate to the population density.

Abstract:
Background: Evaluate the correlation between U.S. state mandated social interventions and Covid-19
mortality using a retrospective analysis of Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) data.
Methods:
Twenty-seven (27) states in the United States were selected on June 17, 2020 from IHME
data which had clearly defined and dated establishment of statewide mandates for social distancing
measures to include: School closures, Prohibition on mass gatherings, business closures, stay at home
orders, severe travel restrictions, and closure of non-essential businesses. The state Covid-19 mortality
prevalence was defined as total normalized deaths to the peak daily mortality rate. The state mortality
prevalence was correlated to the total number of mandates-days from their date of establishment to the
peak daily mortality date. The slope of the maximum daily mortality rate was also correlated to mandatedays.
Results:
The standardized mortality per state to the initial peak mortality rate did not demonstrate
a discernable correlation to the total mandate days (R2 = 0.000006, p= 0.995). The standardized peak
mortality rate per state suggested a slight correlation to the total mandate days (R2 = 0.053,p=0.246), but
was not statistically significant. There was a significant correlation between standardized mortality and
state population density (R2 = 0.524,p=0.00002).
Conclusions: The analysis appears to suggest no mandate effective reduction in Covid-19 mortality nor
a reduction in Covid-19 mortality rate to its defined initial peak when interpreting the mean-effect of the
mandates as present in the data. A strong correlation to population density suggests human interaction
frequency does affect the total mortality and maximum mortality rate.

Background:
Socially distancing policy has been theorized to effectively reduce the rate of transmission of contagious
diseases.1,2,3 Mandating social distancing state-wide within the United States has been instituted to
varying degrees during the Covid-19 pandemic. Reducing the maximum contagion transmission by
mandating decreased social interactions has been theorized to reduce mortality by allowing for
social/medical mobilization and proper resource allocation.3,4,5 Verification of this theoretical model has
not been demonstrated, except analyses demonstrating marginal social distancing effectiveness in
delaying the peak infection.6 The extensive global incidence of the Covid-19 pandemic and unique realtime record keeping presents an opportunity to evaluate the social distancing theory over a large
population with considerably different social distancing measures instituted.

Methods:
The study was conducted using the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) openly published
data on Covid-19 infections by individual states in the United States, to include daily infections/deaths as
well as onset and discontinuation dates of state mandated social interaction interventions. As this was
the primary source of information used for predictive modeling and setting public policy, it was chosen
for its accuracy and regular updates.7
The methods utilized are an extension of the recently submitted manuscript evaluating European
countries in the same manner. The methods are discussed extensively in the available preprint
manuscript: “Covid-19 Social Distancing Interventions by State Mandate and Their Correlation to
Mortality”. 8
The purpose was to quantify the decrease in the infection/mortality or decrease in the maximum
infection/mortality rate as a result of defined state mandated social distancing measures. Mortality was
chosen to define endpoint peaks and rates of change over registered infections within a state. Covid-19
registered infections are beset by inaccuracies due to: Inaccurate testing, testing frequency,
asymptomatic patients, test availability, and regional variations in testing criteria. Individual states
routinely record the cause and time of death. The analyses account for the state’s stage in the
epidemiological infectious cycle and to extend those techniques to the states in the USA while additionally
accounting for population density.
IHME data accessed on June 17, 2020 at 1900 EST was used to select all U.S. states with more than a
maximum mortality rate of 10 Covid-19 deaths per day. Each of the selected states independently
instituted preventive social interaction law on a given date to include one of the six (6) possible mandates.

States which did not maintain their state-wide mandated social distancing through the end of the
examination period (initial peak mortality rate) were excluded. Twenty-Seven (27) States were included
as listed in figure 1. All states mandated social distancing universally across their respective territory of
the 6 variations listed above on a specific date provided by the IHME data set accessed on June 17, 2020
and maintained them through their initial peak infection rate.
Figure 1 captures population density, social mandate form and duration, and Covid-19 mortality and
maximum mortality rate data on the 27 states of the USA included in the study. Covid-19 data was
obtained from IHME. 7 State median age data is obtained from StatsAmerica’s USA States in Profile

Figure 1: Table of population density, median age, social mandate, and Covid-19 mortality data on 27
states of the USA used in this analysis. Fields with “N/A” indicate the state did not implement that
particular form of social mandate.
The defined endpoints for the analysis included the date of the initial peak mortality in deaths per day for
each state. A state’s peak mortality was defined as the highest recorded daily deaths over a seven-day
moving-average which was followed by a seven-or-more day decline in mortality with no other
discernable peaks (using the same criteria) at the time of accessing the data. The maximum daily mortality
rate was used as an easily defined universal milestone in any infectious disease progression to examine
the total viral mortality up to the maximum mortality rate.
Additionally, the maximum slope of the Covid-19 mortality was determined by evaluating the maximum
of the derivative of the mortality curve. Specifically, this slope was defined as the total recorded mortality
five days after the peak-mortality-rate minus the total recorded mortality five days before the peakmortality-rate divided by the 10-day interval. Both the mortality-at-peak and peak-mortality-rate were
normalized by dividing by the population of the selected state.

All data was analyzed with Matlab and Microsoft Excel. 11 General linear mixed effects (GLME) was used
to examine combined effects of the multiple variables. Specifically, Microsoft Excel was used for the
bivariate linear regressions and ANOVA summaries for both mortality-at-peak and peak-mortality-rate
while Matlab was used to generate the 95% confidence interval bounds on those linear regressions as
well as the separate multivariate GLME analyses.
The clinical study was conducted within the ethical principles contained in Declaration of Helsinki, Code
of Federal Regulations (CRF), Obligations of Clinical Investigators (21 CFR 812). All data was public and
anonymous so no IRB was needed.
Similar to the previous study on European countries, the study conducted two high-level bivariate
analyses on this data: one for each output of interest – peak-mortality-rate (PMR) and mortality-at-peak
(MAP) – against the total mandate days. 8 The total mandate days is defined the same way as it was in
the previous study which is the summation from each form of social-mandate of the total number of days
prior to the initial peak that form of social-mandate was implemented. 8

After the bivariate analyses against total mandate days, we then conducted bivariate analyses with the
same response variables against population density instead. After the bivariate analyses, two multivariate
analyses were conducted. These multivariate analyses used the same response variables as in the
previous bivariate studies.

These models were then regressed onto the data from Figure 1. Note that where certain social distancing
mandates were not implemented, the “Days Prior to Peak” values were coded as zero in modeling to avoid
singular data matrices during the regression analysis. The travel restrictions mandate was removed from
the analysis since no states implemented strict travel restrictions in the time of this study according to
Figure 1.

Results:
Results from Bivariate Analysis, MAP vs Total Mandate Days:
Twenty-Seven states were selected June 17, 2020 to examine their collective correlation between
standardized mortality and total mandate-days of state directed social distancing directives. All states
maintained social distancing directives through the study endpoint.7 States were found to have a
significant diversity in total mandated intervention over time (mean = 171 total-mandate-days, std-dev =
50 total-mandate-days). The total population studied was 292 million. All states had statistically similar
age distributions (mean = 38.6 years-old, std-dev = 1.5 years-old). The population density varied
significantly (mean = 304 Pop./square mile, std-dev = 306 Pop./square mile)
Results for the bivariate analysis of mortality-at-peak against total mandate days is captured in Figure 2.
The correlation of the standardized mortality-at-peak with total-mandate-days of social-distancing
mandates prior to the peak was found to be statistically insignificant (R2 = 2E-06 with p-val = 0.9946).
Figure 2: Standardized Covid-19 mortality on the day of peak-mortality-rate correlated to days under
state-mandated social distancing directives prior to the peak.

Discussion:
The analysis appears to show no statistically significant reduction in neither the slope of the Covid-19
mortality rate (p-val = 0.995) nor in Covid-19 mortality (p-val = 0.246) to its defined initial infection peak.
There was a significant correlation to both the overall mortality and the maximum mortality rate to state
population density. The correlation to population density suggests that the proximity and frequency of
social interactions directly affect the mortality rate and overall mortality. However, the evaluation of
state mandates suggests that they were unable to reduce the frequency of social interactions to be
effective. The results corroborate the findings of the previous study conducted using the same
methodology with the IHME data for 12 European countries. 8
One of the advantages in this analytical approach is in the design of the social-mandate input variables to
be more robust to possible biases caused by different states being in different epidemiologic infectious
stages of Covid-19. It is worth noting that quite a few of the states involved in this study have since
experience a second wave of infections not included in this analysis. This may be a successive
superposition of infectious cycles within the state in sequestered populations or an effect of behavioral
changes within the population. As of the drafting of the manuscript on July 19, 2020, Six States; Arizona,
California, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas have had secondary peaks of maximum infection
rates which eclipsed the primary peak used in this analysis. Only their initial peaks were the subject of this
study and they were not revised to the new peak nor excluded. Mandates and social behaviors changed
substantially during the interim between the first maximum and could confound the analysis.
Furthermore, the strong correlation to population density demonstrating a likely effect of personal
interaction frequency which assists in validating the methodology. It is also worth noting that start dates
of social-mandate state implementation does not necessarily imply a certain degree of compliance of the
population with enacted mandates.

Conclusions:
How early before the initial peak an investigated form of social-mandate was implemented by a USA state
was found to be statistically insignificant in its effects on peak-mortality-rate and mortality-at-peak in both
the bivariate studies and the multivariate studies. (The lowest associated p-value with social-mandate
terms across all studies above was p-val > 0.2463 in the bivariate study of studying standardized Covid-19
peak-mortality-rate against total-mandate-days.) However, the average population density was found to
be a statistically significant factor for both peak-mortality-rate and mortality-at-peak of a state in both the
bivariate and multivariate studies. (The largest associated p-value with average population density across
all studies above was p-val = 0.0025 in the multivariate study with peak-mortality-rate.)
What we could conclude from this study is that the timing of social-mandates alone is not enough to
explain the variability in Covid-19 peak-mortality-rate and mortality-at-peak numbers between states.
However, a state’s average population density is a significant factor and should be accounted for in one
way or another in current and future investigations to explain the variability in Covid-19 peak-mortalityrate and mortality-at-peak numbers between states.
Factors which influence the effectiveness of social distancing interventions include the reproduction
number (R0) of the virus, the mortality rate, and the mandate effectiveness of the isolation.12,13 A
reduction of the slope of the maximum infection rate without a change in mortality is consistent with

theory of viral infectious epidemiology.14 Reductions in total mortality due to reduced healthcare system
or advancements in medical care did not materialize in this analysis. However, the time from the probable
first infection to the peak of the infection rate was likely only around 3 months. It is possible that if the
viral mortality estimated at 0.6% to 1.2% or the viral reproduction R0, estimated between 2.8 and 3.3,
were significantly higher may have produced a correlation.11,12 Mandated interventions which were
significantly more isolating may have produced a correlation to the mortality.
