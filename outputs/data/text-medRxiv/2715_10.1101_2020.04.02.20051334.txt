Abstract: The rapid pace of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
pandemic (COVID-19) presents challenges to the robust collection of population-scale data to

20

address this global health crisis. We established the COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology
(COPE) consortium to bring together scientists with expertise in big data research and
epidemiology to develop a COVID-19 Symptom Tracker mobile application that we launched in
the UK on March 24, 2020 and the US on March 29, 2020 garnering more than 2.25 million
users to date. This mobile application offers data on risk factors, herald symptoms, clinical

25

outcomes, and geographical hot spots. This initiative offers critical proof-of-concept for the
repurposing of existing approaches to enable rapidly scalable epidemiologic data collection and
analysis which is critical for a data-driven response to this public health challenge.

Main Text:
The exponentially increasing number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) infections has led to “an urgent need to expand public health activities to
elucidate the epidemiology of the novel virus and characterize it’s potential impact.”(1)
5

Understanding risk factors for infection and predictors of subsequent outcomes is critical to gain
control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (2). However, the speed at which
the pandemic is unfolding poses an unprecedented challenge to collecting exposure data
characterizing the full breadth of disease severity, hampering efforts to disseminate accurate
information in a timely manner to impact public health planning and clinical management. Thus,

10

there is an urgent need for an adaptable real-time data-capture platform to rapidly and
prospectively collect actionable high-quality data that encompasses the spectrum of subclinical
and acute presentations while identifying disparities in diagnosis, treatment, and clinical
outcomes. Addressing this priority will allow for more accurate estimates of disease incidence,
inform risk mitigation strategies, more effectively allocate still-scarce testing resources, and

15

allow for appropriate quarantine and treatment of those afflicted.
An evolving body of literature suggests COVID-19 incidence and outcomes vary
according to age, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying health status, with inconsistent evidence
suggesting that commonly used medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors, thiazolidinediones (TZD), and ibuprofen may alter the natural disease course(3-9).

20

Further, symptoms of COVID-19 vary widely, with fever and dry cough reportedly the most
prevalent, though numerous investigations have demonstrated that asymptomatic carriage is a
significant determinant of community spread(3, 4, 6, 10-14). In addition, the full spectrum of
clinical presentation is still being characterized, which may be significantly different in different
patient groups, as evidenced by recent advisories by the American Gastroenterological

Association (AGA) and the American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery
(AAO-HNS), and British Geriatric Society (BGS) on the potential importance of previously
underappreciated gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, anorexia, and diarrhea) or loss of taste
and/or smell associated with COVID-19 infection, as well as common geriatric syndromes e.g.
5

falls and delirium. The pandemic has dramatically outpaced our collective efforts to fully
characterize who is most at-risk and who may suffer the most serious sequelae of infection.
Mobile phone applications or web-based tools facilitate self-guided collection of
population-level data at scale(15), the results of which can then be rapidly redeployed to inform
participants of urgent health information (15, 16). Both are particularly advantageous when more

10

than three-quarters of Americans are advised to physically distance(13). Such digital tools have
already been used in more controlled research settings which benefit from greater lead time for
field testing, question curation, and recruitment. Although several digital collection tools for
COVID-19 symptoms have been developed and launched in the U.S., including some in
partnership with government health agencies such as the CDC, these applications have largely

15

been configured to offer a single assessment of symptoms to tailor recommendations for further
evaluation. Alternatively, others have been developed for researchers to report patient-level
information on behalf of participants already enrolled in clinical registries. While these
approaches offer critical public health insights, they are not tailored for the type of scalable
longitudinal data capture that epidemiologists need to perform comprehensive, well-powered

20

investigations to address this public health crisis.
To meet this challenge, we established an international collaboration, the COronavirus
Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) consortium, comprised of leading investigators from several
large clinical and epidemiological cohort studies. COPE brings together a multidisciplinary team

of scientists with expertise in big data research and translational epidemiology to interrogate the
COVID-19 pandemic in the largest and most diverse patient population assembled to-date.
Several large inception cohorts have already agreed to join these efforts, including the Nurses’
Health Study II and 3, the Growing Up Today Study, the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study,
5

TwinsUK, Cancer Prevention Study 3, and the Multiethnic Cohort. To aid in our data
harmonization efforts, we co-developed a COVID-19 Symptom Tracker mobile app in
partnership with in-kind contributions from Zoe Global Ltd, a digital healthcare company and
academic scientists from King’s College London. By leveraging the established digital backbone
of an application used for personal nutrition studies, the COVID Symptom Tracker was launched

10

in the UK on March 24, 2020, garnering 1,9,000 users over 8 days since launch. We launched the
app in the U.S. on the evening of March 29th, 2020.
The COVID Symptom Tracker enables self-report of data related to COVID-19 exposure
and infections (Fig. 1). On first use, the app queries location, age, and core health risk factors.
Daily prompts query for updates on interim symptoms, health care visits, and COVID-19 testing

results. In those self-quarantining or seeking health care, the level of intervention and related
outcomes are collected. Individuals without obvious symptoms are also encouraged to use the
app. Through pushed software updates, we can add or modify questions in real-time to test
emerging hypotheses about COVID-19 symptoms and treatments. Importantly, participants
enrolled in ongoing epidemiologic studies, clinical cohorts, or clinical trials can provide

20

informed consent to link survey data collected through the app in a Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPPA)- and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)-compliant
manner to their pre-existing study cohort data and any relevant biospecimens. A specific module
is also provided for participants who identify as healthcare workers to determine the intensity

and type of their direct patient care experiences, the availability and use of personal protective
equipment (PPE), and work-related stress and anxiety.
Through rapid deployment of this tool, we can gain critical insights into population
dynamics of the disease (Fig. 2). By collecting participant-reported geospatial data, highlighted
5

as a critical need for pandemic epidemiologic research (16), we can rapidly identify populations
with highly prevalent symptoms that may emerge as hot spots for outbreaks. A preliminary
snapshot of the first 1.6 million users in the UK over the first five days of use confirms the
variability in symptoms reported across suspected COVID-19 cases and is useful for generating
and testing broader hypotheses. Users are a mean age of 41 with a range from 18 to 90 years,

10

with 75% female users. Simple visualization of initial results (Fig. 3) demonstrates that among
those reporting symptoms by March 27, 2020 (n=265,851) the most common symptoms were
fatigue and cough, followed by diarrhea, fever, and anosmia. Shortness of breath was relatively
rarely reported. Only 0.2% (n=744) of individuals reporting possible COVID-19 symptoms
reported receiving a qPCR test for COVID-19. Among individuals who did undergo a test, cough

15

and fatigue alone or in combination commonly led to testing, but was not highly predictive of a
positive test. Similarly, no individuals reporting diarrhea in the absence of other symptoms tested
positive. Interestingly, more complex presentations with cough and/or fatigue and at least one
additional symptom, including less commonly appreciated symptoms such as diarrhea and
anosmia, appeared to be better predictors. In particular, anosmia may be a more sensitive

20

symptom as it was more common than fever in individuals who tested positive. In contrast, fever
alone was not particularly discriminatory. However, in combination with lesser appreciated
symptoms, a greater frequency of positive tests was observed. These findings suggest that
individuals with complex symptomatic presentation perhaps should be prioritized for testing.

Concerningly, 20% of individuals report complex symptoms (cough and/or fatigue plus at least
one of anosmia, diarrhea, or fever) but have not yet received testing, representing a substantial
population who appear to be at greater risk for the disease.
With additional data collection, we will apply machine learning and other big-data
5

approaches to identify novel patterns that emerge in dynamic settings of exposure, onset of
symptoms, disease trajectory, and clinical outcomes. Our launch of the app within several large
epidemiology cohorts that have previously gathered longitudinal data on lifestyle, diet and health
factors and genetic information will allow investigation of a much broader range of putative risk
factors to COVID-19 outcomes. With additional follow-up, we will also be uniquely positioned

10

to investigate long-term outcomes of COVID-19, including mental health, disability, mortality,
and financial outcomes. Mobile technology can also supplement recently launched clinical trials
or biobanking protocols already embedded within clinical settings. For example, at the
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, we are deploying
the tool within several ongoing clinical studies, centralized biobanking efforts, and healthcare

15

worker surveillance programs. Healthcare workers are a particularly vulnerable population to
COVID-19’s effects beyond infection, including work hazards from PPE shortages, emotional
stress, and absenteeism. Real-time data generation focused within these populations will be
critical to optimally allocate resources to protect our healthcare workforce and assess their
efficacy.

20

In the near future, we hope to release our app as fair-use open source software to allow
for its translation and development in other regions. We have also developed a practical toolkit
for clinical researchers to facilitate local Institutional Review Board (IRB) and regulatory
approval to facilitate use within research studies (www.monganinstitute.org/cope-consortium).

This toolkit includes full detail of the questions asked within the app, consent documents,
privacy policies, and terms of use for the mobile app. We believe our novel approach has
demonstrated critical proof-of-concept for rapid repurposing of existing data collection
approaches to implement scalable real-time collection of population-level data during a fast5

moving global health crisis and National Emergency. We call upon our colleagues to work with
us so that we may deploy all the tools at our disposal to address this unprecedented public health
challenge.
