0 | Abstract
In the absence of effective countermeasures, human convalescent plasma has been widely used to treat
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 including among patients with innate or acquired
immunodeficiency. However, the association between COVID-19-associated mortality in patients with
immunodeficiency and therapeutic use of convalescent plasma is unknown. We review clinical features
and treatment protocols of COVID-19 patients with immunodeficiency after treatment with human
convalescent plasma. We also discuss the time course and clinical features of recovery. These insights
provide evidence for the need to develop a clear treatment protocol for COVID-19 patients with
immunodeficiency and support the efficacy of convalescent plasma in patients with primary or secondary
immunodeficiency.

1 | Introduction
Convalescent plasma represents a passive antibody therapy that has been used to prevent or treat
infectious diseases for more than a century.1,2 In the context of the novel coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic, convalescent plasma has received full or conditional regulatory authorization in
the United States for therapeutic use in adults and children hospitalized with suspected or laboratory
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive COVID-19.3–5 Although early signals for efficacy and optimal use of
convalescent plasma have emerged,6–10 additional large randomized controlled trials are needed to garner
clinical consensus regarding the therapeutic effectiveness of convalescent plasma.

Inasmuch as convalescent plasma confers antiviral properties for the recipient, evidence of therapeutic
effectiveness may be confounded by endogenous anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, particularly
when convalescent plasma transfusion occurs late in the disease course.11 Hence, evaluation of the clinical
responses to convalescent plasma transfusion in immunosuppressed patients who cannot generate innate
immune responses may provide an optimal opportunity to assess the effect of convalescent plasma per
se.12 Thus, herein we summarize the literature detailing the clinical experiences of patients with primary
and secondary immunosuppression who were transfused with COVID-19 convalescent plasma. We
hypothesize that patients with immunodeficiency syndromes, or patients with diseases associated with
blunted endogenous antibody responses to COVID-19, may provide evidence of improved clinical status
when given plasma containing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, with improvements over and above
expectation in light of their underlying clinical conditions and the severity of COVID-19.

This review highlights 40 reports including 104 COVID-19 patients with primary immunosuppression
due to Agammaglobulinemia (X-linked or autosomal) or Common Variable Immunodeficiency, and
secondary immunodeficiencies related to hematological malignancies and solid organ transplants who
were transfused with convalescent plasma. We also highlight additional cases of patients with COVID-19,
including but not limited to patients with other forms of immunosuppression, transfused with
convalescent plasma. We provide a summary overview of patient characteristics, COVID-19 therapies
used, including convalescent plasma, and clinical symptomology (table).

Search strategy and selection criteria
References for this Review were identified through searches of PubMed for articles published from Jan 1,
2020 to Nov 1, 2020, using the Medical Subject Headings terms “COVID-19”, “convalescent plasma”,
“convalescent serum”, “immunosuppression”, “cancer”, “transplant”, “agammaglobulinemia”,
“malignancy”, and any relevant entry terms and supplementary concepts (figure). Relevant articles and
data were also identified through searches in Google Scholar, medRΧiv, and other websites. Articles
resulting from these searches and relevant references cited in those articles were reviewed. Articles
published in English were identified and included. All procedures accessed public information and did not
require ethical review as determined by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board in accordance with
the Code of Federal Regulations, 45 CFR 46.102, and the Declaration of Helsinki.
2 | Primary Immunodeficiency
2.1 | Patients with Agammaglobulinemia
This narrative includes one patient with Autosomal Agammaglobulinemia and six patients with X-linked
Agammaglobulinemia (XLA), six of whom were reported in peer-reviewed articles and one patient who
was identified in a media report.13–16 Patients with Agammaglobulinemia do not produce endogenous
antibodies and require regular intravenous infusions (monthly) or subcutaneous injections (bi-weekly) of
immunoglobulins

to

avoid

serial

infections

from

various

common

pathogens.17

However,

immunoglobulin replacement therapy cannot protect patients against pathogens for which antibodies are
uncommon or absent in the immunoglobulin donor pool, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus.17 The clinical
narratives describing patients with Agammaglobulinemias all demonstrate a prolonged course of disease
and absent antibody response to COVID-19. However, all patients with Agammaglobulinemia
demonstrated clinical improvement and symptom resolution following convalescent plasma transfusion,
with three patients improving rapidly and demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies after transfusion.
In addition to immunoglobulin therapy, some patients also received the experimental COVID-19
therapies remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine.

2.2 | Patients with Common Variable Immunodeficiency
We identified four patients with Common Variable Immunodeficiency transfused with convalescent
plasma for COVID-19 therapy.16 Common Variable Immunodeficiency represents a heterogeneous
collection of immunodeficiencies commonly characterized by intrinsic B-cell defects and suppressed
antibody production.18 Patients with Common Variable Immunodeficiency often present with
inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, which are suspected to elevate these patients risk for
progression to severe COVID-19.16,18 The four patients described here were all antibody deficient and
diagnosed with severe or life-threatening COVID-19. Notably, three of these patients survived following
convalescent plasma transfusion, including two patients whose clinical symptomatology required
mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

3 | Secondary Immunodeficiency
3.1 | Patients with Hematological Malignancies
We identified 54 patients with hematological malignancies transfused with convalescent plasma in 18
peer-reviewed reports.19,20,28,29,29–36,21–24,24–27 The largest cohort of patients with hematological
malignancies was a group of 17 patients with B-cell depletion whose immunodeficiency was secondary to
therapies for various types of lymphoma or leukemia.19 These patients experienced protracted severe
COVID-19 symptoms and absent endogenous SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses due to cancer-directed
therapies that suppress B-cell proliferation, such as rituximab. Within 48 hours of convalescent plasma
transfusion the majority of patients demonstrated improved clinical status and viral clearance. Similarly,
in a separate cohort of 14 patients with hematological malignancies, most patients exhibited
improvements in clinical symptomatology, including reduced oxygen requirements,20 after treatment with
convalescent plasma. Other case-reports are of lymphoma (n = 11), leukemia (n = 5), multiple myeloma
(n = 3), and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1) and include one four year old pediatric patient with
leukemia who received two convalescent plasma doses over two days.28 A majority of patients with
hematological malignancies recovered following convalescent plasma transfusion, with many
demonstrating rapid clinical improvements shortly after transfusion. Notably, a patient with protracted
COVID-19, evidenced by three separate COVID-19-related hospitalisations over a 100+ day period, and
with lymphoma-associated B-cell immunodeficiency demonstrated rapid reductions in fever, oxygen
requirements, and lung infiltrates (via chest computed tomography) forthwith after two separate
convalescent plasma transfusions separated by ~90 days.22

3.2 | Solid Organ Transplant Patients
Among nine peer-reviewed articles and two media reports we identified a total of 29 COVID-19 patients
transfused with convalescent plasma whom were receiving immunosuppressive therapies for previous
solid organ transplants.37–47 In a cohort of 13 transplant recipients transfused with convalescent plasma
concomitant to hydroxychloroquine, steroids and anticoagulants therapies for COVID-19, eight patients
demonstrated improved oxygen requirements and were promptly discharged 37. In the other nine reports, a
majority of the 17 patients with COVID-19 demonstrated improved clinical symptomatology following
convalescent plasma transfusion. Improvement was even seen in a liver transplant patient discharged
home after a convalescent plasma transfusion that occurred during a seventeen day medically-induced
coma due to COVID-19 complications.44

4 | Conclusion
These data provide evidence and encouraging anecdotal statements (panel) supporting the efficacy of
convalescent plasma in patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency, and are consistent with the
historical evidence demonstrating that passive antibody therapies for infectious diseases are especially
effective when given early in the course of disease prior to an endogenous antibody response.2,48,49 In
contrast to ongoing studies of convalescent plasma efficacy in clinical trials where the majority of patients
are not immunosuppressed and thus mount their own protective antibody responses,6,11,50 convalescent
plasma use in these immunosuppressed patients represents a situation where exogenous antibody is
provided in the setting of an immune deficit.17 This is particularly true in the case for patients with
Agammaglobulinemia, who represent in effect a natural ‘immunological knockout’ providing the
opportunity to evaluate the value of adding specific antibody to a host unable to make antibody to SARSCoV-2.

The results for patients with Agammaglobulinemia are striking for the beneficial effects of convalescent
plasma, and even though the reports lack a control group, the rapid time course of clinical improvement
following administration of specific antibody in a situation where no endogenous antibody was present is
impressive. Convalescent plasma was also found to be safe and efficacious in COVID-19 patients with
common variable immunodeficiency, myasthenia gravis, and Sjögren’s syndrome, in addition to COVID19 patients with heart rhythm abnormalities and gravida.51–57 Hence, from the viewpoint of establishing
the efficacy of convalescent plasma administration in COVID-19 therapy, the experience with this patient
set provides the important criterion that addition of specific antibody to a host with no antibodies resulted
in a favorable therapeutic effect.

In the present case, the rapid clinical improvement followed by viral clearance after administration of hyperimmune
plasma argue that passively transferred antibodies played a key role in COVID-19 recovery.23
One day later [after convalescent plasma transfusion], the patient was afebrile for the first time in 3 weeks and had
improved energy.13
On day 122 (of illness), due to worsening symptoms, the patient was given convalescent plasma. He defervesced
within 24 hours and was discharged nine days later.31
…she was transferred to the intensive care unit for intubation. In the meantime…the patient received convalescent
therapy instead and did not undergo intubation following the immediate improvement after plasma therapy infusion.52
Based on the lack of clinical improvement…we transfused 1 unit of convalescent plasma…Importantly, the patient
did not receive any other treatment potentially having an effect on the course of COVID-19…After transfusion of the
convalescent plasma, the patient showed a dramatic clinical improvement, became asymptomatic, and was discharged
home only 2 days later.36
The patient was discharged after 2 weeks [convalescent plasma transfusion] with a dramatic response to therapy. Both
newborns had no COVID-19 symptoms and negative PCR results.54
36 hours after [convalescent plasma] transfusion, the patient was discharged from the hospital reporting that he felt
improved.53
COVID-19 antibody testing showed complete lack of COVID-19 antibodies…She received 2 units of convalescent
plasma…with rapid improvement in oxygen requirements. She was weaned off high-flow nasal cannula within 48 h
and within a few days was discharged home in stable condition.32
Intravenous convalescent plasma…was administered…Her health condition quickly improved, allowing [withdrawal
of oxygen supplementation]…23
Within a day of receiving her first transfusion of convalescent plasma, she reported improvement in shortness of
breath and cough, had fever resolution, and decreasing oxygen requirements.24
She received COVID convalescent plasma…She showed remarkable improvement [the next day]…with reduction of
respiratory rate…and oxygen requirements.21
…the patient received a transfusion of convalescent plasma…one day later her [arterial oxygen saturation] increased
to 98%...clinical symptoms and pathological criteria improved rapidly within 3 days.29
Within hours after receiving the convalescent plasma… [The patient’s] fever started going down. Days later, his
breathing and kidney function improved.45
[The patient]…received a transfusion of convalescent plasma…He is recovering at home after spending two and a
half weeks in a coma fighting for his life...44
…received 217 mL of convalescent plasma…24 hours later, his heart rate had improved to 60-70 bpm with less
frequent premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular contractions and he was breathing comfortably on
room air…36 hours after transfusion the patient was discharged from the hospital…53
Stagnancy in the patient’s evolution, as represented by the lack of response to any of the treatments dispensed....we
administered on day 23 COVID-19 convalescent plasma...after 24 hours of infusion, fever ceased without subsequent
reappearance and with progressive improvement of asthenia.14
