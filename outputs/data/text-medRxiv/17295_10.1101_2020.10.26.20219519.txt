Summary

19

Adults over 60 and children admitted to hospital with COVID-19 are less likely to have typical

20

symptoms. Nausea and vomiting are common atypical presentations under 30 and confusion over

21

60. Women are less likely to experience typical symptoms than men.

Abstract

25

Background

26

The ISARIC prospective multinational observational study is the largest cohort of hospitalized

27

patients with COVID-19. We present relationships of age, sex, and nationality to presenting

28

symptoms.

29

Methods

30

International, prospective observational study of 60;109 hospitalized symptomatic patients with

31

laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 recruited from 43 countries between 30 January and 3 August 2020.

32

Logistic regression was performed to evaluate relationships of age and sex to published COVID-19

33

case definitions and the most commonly reported symptoms.

34

Results

35

‘Typical’ symptoms of fever (69%), cough (68%) and shortness of breath (66%) were the most

36

commonly reported. 92% of patients experienced at least one of these. Prevalence of typical

37

symptoms was greatest in 30- to 60-year-olds (respectively 80%, 79%, 69%; at least one 95%). They

38

were reported less frequently in children (≤18 years: 69%, 48%, 23%; 85%), older adults (≥70 years:

39

61%, 62%, 65%; 90%), and women (66%, 66%, 64%; 90%;

40

common atypical presentation under 60 years of age was nausea and vomiting, and over 60 years

41

was confusion. Regression models showed significant differences in symptoms with sex, age and

42

country.

43

Interpretation

44

Adults over 60 and children admitted to hospital with COVID-19 are less likely to present with typical

45

symptoms. Nausea and vomiting are common atypical presentations under 30 years. Confusion is a

46

frequent atypical presentation of COVID-19 in adults over 60 years. Women are less likely to

Background

52

Despite the pandemic’s immense human cost, enormous economic toll, and extensive research

53

response, the precise clinical characteristics of COVID-19 remain unclear [1]. At the start of the

54

outbreak, COVID-19 was broadly characterised as a severe respiratory illness presenting with fever,

55

cough and an atypical pneumonia [2-5]. Altered sense of taste and smell have since been found to

56

be strongly associated with the disease [6, 7]. However, a review of 77 observational studies found

57

substantial proportions of patients presenting with less typical symptoms [8].

58

The World Health Organization’s (WHO) clinical criteria for suspected COVID-19 is either a

59

combination of acute fever and cough, or a combination of three or more of fever, cough, general

60

weakness and fatigue, headache, myalgia, sore throat, coryza, dyspnoea, anorexia, nausea and

61

vomiting, diarrhoea, and altered mental status [9]. Clinical criteria from the Centers for Disease

62

Control and Prevention in the United States are at least two of fever, chills, rigors, myalgia,

63

headache, sore throat, and new olfactory and taste disorder, or at least one of cough, shortness of

64

breath or difficulty breathing [10]. Public Health England’s definition of possible COVID-19 is

65

individuals with a new cough or temperature ≥37.8 °C, or a loss or change in sense of smell or taste

66

[11]. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control clinical criteria are at least one of

67

cough, fever, shortness of breath, or sudden onset anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia [12].

68

Defining presenting symptoms of COVID-19 is further complicated by clinical experience

69

suggesting that patients frequently present with atypical symptoms other than cough, fever and

70

shortness of breath. This variation in the clinical characterisation of COVID-19 is problematic, as case

71

definitions are used to guide clinical diagnosis, disease surveillance, and public health interventions.

72

The International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium

73

(ISARIC)/WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol for Severe Emerging Infections is a standardized

74

protocol for investigation of severe acute infections by pathogens of public health interest [13, 14].

75

Here we present an analysis of how symptoms of patients admitted to hospital with confirmed

76

COVID-19 vary by age and sex.

Materials and methods

78

Study population, variables and measurement

79

Patients of any age admitted to hospital with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were eligible for

80

recruitment. This analysis was limited to patients admitted to hospital between 30 January and 3

81

August 2020 with symptomatic COVID-19, confirmed according to sites’ local laboratory methods.

82

We excluded asymptomatic patients admitted to hospital solely for isolation, and patients admitted

83

for other conditions who subsequently developed COVID-19 symptoms. Variables used in this

84

analysis were age, sex at birth, symptoms, date of symptoms onset, SARS-CoV-2 confirmation, and

85

country of recruitment. To allow proportions to be calculated with a reliable denominator, only

86

symptoms specified on the case report forms were included in this analysis.

87

This observational study required no change to clinical management and permitted

88

enrolment in other research. The study was approved by the World Health Organization Ethics

89

Review Committee (RPC571 and RPC572). Local ethics approval was obtained for each participating

90

country and site according to local requirements. Informed consent was obtained where required by

91

local ethics committees. In many jurisdictions, ethics committees and public health authorities

92

approved a waiver of consent.

93

Study design and setting

94

The ISARIC cohort is an international prospective observational study of patients admitted to

95

hospital with COVID-19. Data were collected via electronic ‘Core’ and ‘Rapid’ ISARIC case report

96

forms [15], and through aligned forms by ISARIC-4C Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium

97

in the United Kingdom [16] and the COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium [17]. Investigators from 41

98

countries used Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap, version 8.11.11, Vanderbilt University,

99

Nashville, Tenn.) to contribute their data to a central database hosted by the University of Oxford.

100

Additional data were submitted by investigators not using the University of Oxford REDCap database

101

from Malaysia, Russia [18], and Spain. The primary objective of this analysis was to investigate how

symptoms of patients admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 vary by age and sex.

Secondarily we investigated how sensitivity of clinical case definitions varied among these

104

populations, and explored heterogeneity among countries.

Analysis

106

Data were converted to Study Data Tabulation Model (version 1.7, Clinical Data Interchange

107

Standards Consortium, Austin, Tex.). We excluded patients who had all symptoms recorded as

108

missing or unknown, and those with missing age, sex, country or onset date. Continuous variables

109

were expressed as median with interquartile range (IQR), and categorical variables as counts with

110

percentages. We tested for differences between female and male patients using Wilcoxon rank-sum

111

tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. We grouped patients

112

into ten-year age bands (with a single group ≥90 years). We plotted most frequently reported

113

symptoms by age group, presenting missing data as a third category. We collated symptoms

114

according to four sets of clinical criteria, based on published criteria [9-12] modified to omit

115

symptoms with large numbers of missing data:

116

1.

117

Fever plus cough; or any three of fever, cough, fatigue, headache, myalgia, sore throat,

rhinorrhoea, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, and confusion;

118

2.

Cough or shortness of breath; or any two of fever, myalgia, headache, and sore throat;

119

3.

Cough or fever;

120

4.

At least one of cough, fever, and shortness of breath.

121

Patients with missing details of cough, fever or shortness of breath were omitted from the

122

composite groups; patients missing details of symptoms included in the lists of criteria 1 and 2 were

123

classified according to their non-missing symptoms. We plotted proportions of patients meeting

124

each set of criteria by ten-year age group with 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated using the

125

Clopper–Pearson method.

126

127

We used logistic regression to identify associations of age and sex with the twelve most

prevalent symptoms. Age group and sex were included as fixed effects, with country as a random

intercept. To display heterogeneity between countries on the same scale as the fixed effects, we

129

plotted median odds ratios (MOR), which quantify variation between countries by comparing odds

130

of an outcome between randomly chosen persons in different clusters who share covariates [19].

131

MORs are defined as a comparison of the greater propensity group to the lower propensity group, so

132

lie in the range one to infinity [19].

133

79% of patients were recruited in a single country. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the

134

analysis excluding patients from this country. Finally, we plotted age-stratified symptom frequencies

135

for each country with at least 250 patients.

136

No minimum sample size was calculated. All significance tests were two-tailed. Analyses

137

were performed using R (version 4.0.3, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) with

proportion in the age-band 10 to 20 years (46%). We included 60;109 patients (Figure 1), recruited

144

from 394 sites in 43 countries (Supplementary Table 1), in this analysis. The median age of included

145

patients was 70 years (IQR 54–82; Table 1). 929 (1.5%) were 18 years old or younger. Age

146

distribution of patients varied among countries, between a median of 10 years in Poland, and 73

153

prevalence was reported in adults aged between 30 and 60 years, decreasing toward extremities of

154

age (Figure 2). Frequency of confusion increased with age. Large numbers of patients had missing

155

data for anorexia, severe dehydration, altered sense of taste and smell, and inability to walk as these

156

were not included on all case report forms. Altered sense of taste and smell, which we had excluded

157

from the composite criteria, were experienced by only 7.4% and 6.2% respectively of patients with

158

non-missing data.

159

Data on cough, fever or shortness of breath were missing for 3446 patients. The composite

160

clinical criteria were calculated for the remaining 56;663 patients. Each set of criteria was met by a

161

greater proportion of patients aged 30 to 60 years than those toward either extreme of age (Figure

162

3). The criteria based on WHO’s clinical criteria [9] (fever plus cough; or any three of fever, cough,

163

fatigue, headache, myalgia, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting,

164

diarrhoea, and confusion) were met by 40;911 (72%) patients, but only 51% of those aged 18 years

165

and under, and 67% of those aged 70 years or over. The most sensitive criteria were at least one of

166

cough, fever and shortness of breath, met by 52;041 (92%) participants. These criteria were met by

167

85% aged 18 years and under, and 90% of those aged 70 years or over. Each set of criteria were met

168

by a greater proportion of male than female patients (Table 2).

169

For the 4622 patients whose symptoms did not meet any assessed case definitions, the most

170

frequent symptom was confusion (47%; Table 3). This increased with age to 66% of those aged 90

171

years or older. Nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain were the most common symptoms for

172

people less than 60 years old who had not met any of the case definitions.

173

In the logistic regression models (Figure 4), similar associations between age and symptoms

174

were seen after adjustment for sex and relationship of onset to admission date as in the unadjusted

175

bar charts. Confusion increased with age. Nausea and vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, and sore

176

throat were each more frequent in younger age groups, decreasing with age. The 95% CI for sex

177

excluded one for most symptoms, but for most the point estimate was close to one. Male patients

178

had greater odds of fever, cough and shortness of breath, and lower odds of gastrointestinal

179

symptoms of nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, chest pain, headache and sore throat.

180

The median odds ratio for heterogeneity between countries was greater than the relationship with

181

sex in all symptoms. It was of similar magnitude to the relationship with age for most symptoms. For

182

each symptom, heterogeneity between countries was of a similar magnitude to the effect of age,

183

and a greater magnitude than sex.

184

47;280 (79%) patients were included from the United Kingdom. Excluding these patients,

185

the patterns of symptoms were similar to the main analysis (Supplementary Figure 2). The peak

186

prevalence of fever, cough and shortness of breath was in 70- to 80-year-olds, and fatigue increased

187

with age. Below the age of 50 years, the clinical case definitions tended to be less sensitive in the

188

analysis excluding the United Kingdom than in the analysis including it; above the age of 70 years

189

each tended to be more sensitive (grey lines in Figure 3). Within countries, the baseline prevalence

190

of each symptom varied but patterns within countries were broadly similar to the overall results

191

(Supplementary figures 3–14).

192

Discussion

193

The ISARIC prospective multinational cohort study is the largest cohort of patients admitted to

194

hospital with COVID-19. In this report, we confirmed a relationship between patients’ symptoms and

195

their age and sex. The ‘typical’ COVID-19 symptoms occur most frequently in adults aged 30 to 60

196

years. Commonly used case definitions in use can miss up to half of children and a third of adults

197

over 70 years who are admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

198

Our results support the findings of smaller cohort studies that atypical symptoms are more

199

common in older adults [21], and correlate with similar findings of atypical presentations for

200

pneumonia, bacteraemia and coronary artery disease [22, 23]. A lower prevalence of symptoms in

201

children and young people has previously been suggested [24, 25], but this is the first large

202

international cohort to collect data prospectively from both adults and children.

203

Separate analyses of the ISARIC-4C data have identified fever, cough and shortness of breath

204

as frequently co-occurring clusters of symptoms [26, 27]. In children, the next most frequent cluster

205

consisted of systemic, enteric and mucocutaneous symptoms [26]. For adults, other clusters

206

consisted of non-specific viral symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, upper respiratory symptoms,

207

neurological symptoms, and symptoms of bronchospasm [27]. Those data were included in this

208

global dataset so the results of these analyses are not independent of our results.

209

We found that differences in symptoms by sex were statistically significant but generally of

210

smaller magnitude. Typical symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath were more common

211

in men than in women; all other symptoms were equal or more common in female patients. A

212

cohort of non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Poland found greater differences in symptoms

213

of lack of appetite (55% of women, 36% of men) and taste disorder (53% women, 40% men) [28].

214

We are unable to determine from our data whether these differences reflect differences in health-

215

seeking behaviour between men and women, or a biological difference in their response to the

216

infection. Elaboration of this difference should be a goal of future research.

217

Our results suggest considerable heterogeneity among countries. We have not attempted to

218

elicit reasons for heterogeneity. Potential reasons include cultural idiosyncrasies in reporting

219

symptoms, and hospitals’ criteria for admission and testing. It might also reflect differences in local

220

patient recruitment. Researchers in some countries may be unwilling to recruit confused patients

221

due to requirements for consent, whereas in others the requirement for consent has been waived or

222

could be obtained from a proxy.

223

We explored the effect of using the country of recruitment as a random effect in regression

224

models and by repeating the analysis excluding the largest country. Each analysis suggested an

225

underlying pattern of lower frequencies of typical symptoms in children and older adults. Therefore,

226

although the prevalence of each symptom reported in this study may not apply to all settings, we

227

have evidence to support the possibility of age-dependent differences internationally.

228

229

The size of this cohort is a strength. To our knowledge, it is the largest cohort of hospitalized

COVID-19 patients in the world. However, the study has several limitations. Firstly, almost 80% of

10

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.26.20219519; this version posted November 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this

230

patients were recruited in a single country. Moreover, less than 1% of patients were recruited from

231

low- or lower-middle-income countries. Secondly, the cohort overwhelmingly includes older adults,

232

with only 1.8% of the cohort aged 18 years or younger. Thirdly, our analysis includes only patients

233

who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and who had a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis. This patient

234

population is more likely to be severely unwell and more likely to exhibit symptoms typically

235

associated with COVID-19 than people who were managed in the community or whose disease has

236

not been recognized. Accordingly, the reporting of ‘typical’ COVID-19 symptoms in this cohort is

237

likely to be an overestimate of the population prevalence. Symptoms are subjective and cannot be

238

externally verified. Some differences for children may reflect that symptoms could only be recorded

239

if a caregiver recognised the symptom or the child had the appropriate vocabulary to describe it.

240

Similarly, some symptoms may be under-reported in elderly patients if there are difficulties in

241

communication, for example due to delirium. As such, the generalizability of estimates of our

242

symptom prevalence is limited. Similarly, there is a shortage of studies conducted outside of high-

243

income countries: a recent scoping review of clinical characteristics of COVID-19 identified no large

244

cohorts in non-high-income countries except China [8].

245

The absence of a control group of patients without COVID-19 in this dataset prevented

246

estimation of specificity or positive and negative predictive values. We are therefore prevented from

247

advocating changes to clinical case definitions, as such decisions inevitably require a balance of false-

248

positive and false-negative rates. However, given the prevalence of atypical symptoms in our cohort,

249

we can confidently suggest that reliance on clinical case definitions may result in missing cases of

250

COVID-19, especially among children and older adults. Non-healthcare professionals making

251

decisions regarding isolation may be especially vulnerable to missing cases of COVID-19 by adhering

252

to a clinical case definition too strictly.

253

The reported prevalence of COVID-19 may also rely on a strict interpretation of case

254

definitions. In settings where comprehensive contact tracing is planned, or there is easy access to

255

microbiological testing, a highly sensitive case definition is desirable. However, where decisions are

256

based on clinical diagnoses, it is important to recognize other pathogens that can cause similar

257

constellations of symptoms. The addition of symptoms such as confusion or gastrointestinal

258

symptoms to the COVID-19 case definition could increase sensitivity, but at the cost of reduced

259

specificity. Changes in the senses of taste and smell have recently been added to case definitions.

260

Our data suggest that these criteria would detect only a small proportion of patients admitted to

261

hospital with COVID-19 who were omitted by other definitions.

262

These results highlight the need to consider COVID-19 even if individuals do not display

263

typical symptoms of the disease. This is especially the case in children and older adults. Given that

264

our results are likely to overestimate the sensitivity of the clinical criteria currently used to identify

265

patients for testing, our results suggest a lower limit to the proportion of people in the community

266

with COVID-19 who would not be identified. Addition of confusion as a symptom would increase the

267

sensitivity of case definitions for older adults; and inclusion of nausea and vomiting or abdominal

268

pain would increase sensitivity for children and young adults. The high proportion of asymptomatic

269

patients identified in patients aged 10 to 20 years suggests that universal screening in these ages

270

could be beneficial when there is widespread community circulation of COVID-19. Ongoing data

271

collection outside high-income countries is needed to establish whether alternative case definitions

272

are needed in different settings. Work is also ongoing to determine whether some constellations of

273

symptoms are associated with better or poorer outcomes than others.

Black boxes show the proportion of individuals, with error bars showing 95% confidence intervals

panel A, the three symptoms are from the list of fever, cough, fatigue, headache, myalgia, sore
