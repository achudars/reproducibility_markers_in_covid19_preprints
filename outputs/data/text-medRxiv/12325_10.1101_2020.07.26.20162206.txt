Abstract:

48

Background: Since the end of 2019 to the present day, the outbreak of the

49

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had an immense impact on China and on

50

other countries worldwide. This outbreak represents a serious threat to the lives and

51

health of people all around the world. The epidemic first broke out in Wuhan, where

52

the Chinese government was unable to prevent the spread of the disease by

53

implementing home quarantine measures. Mobile cabin hospitals were used to relieve

54

pressure on hospitals due to the need for beds while also isolating the sources of the

55

infection through a centralized quarantine and treatment of mild cases. Method: This

56

paper reviewed and summarized the treatment of patients with mild illness and

57

symptoms during the period from the construction to the closing of the Hanyang

58

Mobile Cabin Hospital in Wuhan, China, and presented the operational elements and

59

possible improvements of running this hospital. Results: Mobile cabin hospitals

60

helped China to curb the epidemic in only 2 incubation periods in 28 days.The basic

61

conditions required for a normal operation of mobile cabin hospitals included the

62

selection of the environment, medical staff to patient ratio, organizational structure,

63

management model, admission criteria, treatment approaches, discharge process,

64

livelihood guarantee, security, and other safeguarding measures. All of these

65

components were performed carefully in Wuhan Hanyang Mobile Cabin Hospital,

66

without medical staff being infected. Conclusion: The mobile cabin hospital

67

compulsory quarantine for mild patients was an alternative method to combat

68

COVID-19. It is hoped that the presented work in this manuscript can serve as a

69

reference for the emergency prevention and control measures for global epidemic

70

outbreaks.

Introduction

76

At the end of 2019, there was an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

77

epidemic in Wuhan, China. Due to its long incubation period, atypical symptoms,

78

multiple organ dysfunction due to multiple organ involvement, and insufficient

79

medical resources in the early stages, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was estimated

80

at 6%-10%

81

transmission, with a basic reproduction number (R0) of about 2-3

82

number of cases rose sharply from 41 cases in December 30, to 14,557 in February 3,

83

including 14,411 cases in China and 146 cases in 22 countries outside of China [9].

84

This led to a series of problems, such as a shortage of hospital beds, intense pressure

85

on medical resources due to the exponential growth in the number of cases, and the

86

difficulties faced by designated hospitals due to an overflow of patients. In the early

87

stages of the epidemic outbreak, the Chinese government adopted home quarantine

88

measures for patients with mild symptoms. However, outbreaks in familial clusters

89

became one of the major routes of transmission in the development of the epidemic at

90

the later stages [3] and the previously adopted home quarantine approach was shown to

91

be unable to effectively control the epidemic. The disease continued spreading within

92

many families, and mild cases could not be effectively contained, which then in turn

93

became important sources of infection. This vicious cycle sustained the spread of the

94

disease, resulting in an ongoing exponential growth of new and suspected cases

95

(Figure 1). Secondly, due to insufficient medical resources, a large number of patients

96

were unable to receive effective treatment, which caused more patients to become

97

critically ill and increased the mortality rate

98

dire, and new strategies were urgently needed to cope with the situation.

[1-5].

Furthermore, COVID-19 displayed an unprecedented rate of

[10-12]

[6-8]

, hence the

. The situation became increasingly

99
100

To further control the sources of infection and prevent the deterioration of patients’

101

conditions, On February 3, China’s central government decided to implement the

102

Mobile Cabin Hospital policy for confirmed cases with mild disease symptoms for

103

concentrating quarantine and treatment, in addition to the policy that suspected cases

104

and patients with fever underwent centralized quarantine (one patient, one room)

105

through the requisition of hotels, guest houses, idle factories etc., before testing,

106

diagnosis, and treatment. The so-called mobile cabin hospitals were wartime field

107

hospitals that were built by converting large sports centers and exhibition centers for

108

the purposes of receiving mild cases. This approach, on the one hand, enabled the

109

unified centralized quarantine, treatment, and management of patients with mild

110

disease symptoms, thus reducing transmission. On the other hand, it meant that

111

designated hospitals were used for the treatment of severe cases, which enabled the

112

concentration of resources and treatment, thereby increasing the recovery rate and

113

decreasing the case fatality rate.

114
115

From February 3 to March 10, a total of 14 mobile cabin hospitals were set up and

116

used in China, providing a total of 12,365 beds

117

been in operation for 35 days as of the writing of this paper, and a total of 11,309

118

patients had received treatment(Table1). The construction of mobile cabin hospitals

119

had had a significant effect on reducing transmission and slowing down the growth

120

rate of new cases (see Figure1). Since they had operated for an incubation period of

121

14 days, the newly diagnosis cases dropped significantly, for two incubation periods

122

the number of new cases had gradually fallen to single digits. On the other hand, with

123

an increase in the number of recovered patients, and the current number of confirmed

124

cases having decreased substantially (Figure1), the trend of a rapid spreading the

125

epidemic disease was curbed quickly as a result. Therefore, mobile cabin hospitals

126

had played a crucial role in China’s success in the fight against the epidemic.

I. Location selection and ward layout description.

147

Wuhan Hanyang Mobile Cabin Hospital was transformed by Hall B1 in Wuhan

148

International Expo Center [ Figure 2a]. Hanyang Mobile Cabin Hospital(MCH) was

149

located in Hall B1, while the headquarter was set in Hall A1, which was in the

150

upstream of Hall B1 and considered as clean zone. There were some measures taken

151

before it began to run in order to prevent the cross infection of medical staff and

152

patients and ensure the smooth operation(see Figure 2). First, the route toward the

153

MCH for entering and leaving of Medical staff (blue arc line with arrow) was

154

designed to be separated from that for patients (red arc line with arrow)(Figure 2a).

155

Secondly, three zones and two passage ways were set up in MCH to facilitate the

156

management of hospital infection control. (1)Two passage ways included one for

157

doctors

（②

and another for patients

158

The three zones included contaminated zone (red), buffer zone (yellow), and clean

159

zone (outside the MCH, not shown). The contaminated zone contained preview triage

160

area and the ward. In the buffer zone where doctors passageway

161

there was an entry channel (a) to don PPE (1 changing room, 1 buffer rooms) and an

162

exit channel (b) to dof PPE. The exit channel also had four rooms: 1 the first buffer

163

room, 2 the first doffing room, 3 the second doffing room, and 4 the second buffer

164

room(Figure 2b). While the area outside the Hall B1, for example, Hall A1 was

165

designated as the clean zone, and used as working area. Thirdly, In the middle of

166

buffer area, a temporary CT reading area was set to facilitate the clinician to read

167

patient’s chest imaging(Figure 2b)(see supplemetal material1). Lastly, in front of the

168

MCH, in the patients’ pathway, there were two mobile CT scanners for patients’

169

imaging test with a waiting area in a tent. On the left, there was a simple clinical

170

laboratory for blood testing that had been transformed from a convenience store(see

171

supplemental material2).

173

II. Ward layout and requirements for medical staff

174

There were 48 units which consisted of 18-22 beds in each unit, making up a total of

175

930 beds in the ward. The general ward was divided into two parts named A and B,

176

managed by Shandong medical team and Sichuan medical team respectively. The

177

Nurse Station was located in the central part, on the opposite side facing the Nurse

178

Station, there were the intensive care unit (ICU), the Drug House, and the material

179

storage room. There were reading room and activity area in the front of the ward,

180

while at the back it was equipped with the storage area (Figure 2C)(see nhsupplemetal

181

material3).

182

Bed spacing was at least 1-1.5m

183

medical teams called Shangdong and Sichuan Medical Team, each of which managed

184

465 beds. Each team had about 300 medical staff including 100 physicians and 200

185

nurses who were divided into several groups. Therefore, the ratio of physicians to the

[17]

, Hanyang Mobile Cabin Hospital had two

186

nurses to patients was approximately 1:2:5. Every team had several groups for

187

shifting works in MCH. The medical group leader (second-line physician) in each

188

group managed the entire patients, and each front-line physician managed about 40

189

patients, hence at least 12 physicians were needed for each shift in each medical

190

group. Additionally, special hospital infection teams were also established, scheduled

191

for four shifts per day and four stations per shift, which included contaminated zones,

192

semi-contaminated zones, buffer zones and cleaning stations (where material

193

distribution, cleaning of googles and other work was performed). These teams were in

194

charge of supervising the proper wearing and removal of personal protective

195

equipment (PPE) for all types of workers to ensure zero infection.

196
197

III. The admission and operation of Hanyang Mobile Cabin Hospital.

198

According to the “Workbook of mobile cabin Hospitals (Third Edition)” released by

199

the Bureau of Hospital Administration, Department of Medical Administration,

200

National Health Commission of China, the patients admitted to mobile cabin hospitals

201

should be mild cases with mild clinical symptoms and no manifestations of

202

pneumonia on imaging findings; and common cases with fever and respiratory

203

symptoms, some manifestations of pneumonia on imaging findings, had self-care

204

ability and were independently ambulatory. Patients should be free of severe chronic

205

diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, malignant tumors,

206

structural lung disease, pulmonary heart disease, and immunosuppression. Patients

207

should not have a history of mental illness. Their resting-state finger pulse oximetry

208

SpO2 should be above 93% and respiratory rate should be <30 breaths/min. Special

209

instructions are given for other conditions [16].

210

In Hanyang MCH with A total of 930 beds, 1,028 patients were treated, 598 patients

211

were cured, and 430 patients were transferred to designated hospitals before the MCH

212

was closed.

213

As was shown in Figure3A, large number of patients were admitted at an early time

214

on Feb 11, due to the outbreak being at an early stage, the mobile cabin hospital filled

215

up rapidly in just four days.

216

Novel coronavirus nucleic acid testing was performed in the mobile cabin hospital

217

starting on Feb 17th based on the diagnosis and treatment protocol of novel

218

coronaviral pneumonia (trial version 7) in China, when the patients gradually

219

recovered. Novel coronavirus nucleic acid testing in HanYang MCH was performed

220

by KingMed Diagnostics Company. In Figure 4a, the results indicated there were

221

about 30-120 patients who met discharge criteria with two negative nucleic acid tests

222

each day. The positive rate of nucleic acid detection of Covid-19 was determined to be

223

about 10-17%.

224

Mobile CT (Shanghai United Imaging HealthCare Co.ltd) were installed and put into

225

use on Feb 19th,8 days after the opening of Hangyang Mobile Cabin Hospital. It

226

indicated the trend for daily CT scans increased every week according to requirements

227

of evaluation of clinical effects, there were on average about 60-120 CT scans

228

performed, with the maximum number of CT scans being at about 160 times per day

229

for the initial stage, while the data drop to 20-80 due to the decrease of patients.

230

Over time, there were about 50 patients discharged every day around 10 days later

231

when the patients gradually recovered. Since the newly diagnosed patients dropped

232

dramatically indicating the epidemic was controlled after one incubation period of 14

233

days (Figure1). No more patients were admitted to the Han Yang MCH from that time

234

onwards.

235

In total, about 40% of patients were transferred to designated hospitals for treatment

236

due to the severity of Covid-19 infections or other underlying diseases. There were

237

nearly 200 critically ill patients transferred to designated hospitals on March 8, when

238

the cabin hospital was closed because the epidemic in Wuhan had been curbed.

241

Like other mobile cabin hospital, Hayang Mobile Cabin Hospitals had a complete

242

organizational structure to ensure their operation. The head of the local hospital Hubei

243

Women and Children Hospital served as the hospital director for the overall

244

management, the regional government served as district general commander, while

245

the leaders of the different medical teams including Fujian, Sichuan and Shandong

246

Province served as deputy hospital directors to be responsible for supplementary

247

examination, hospital infection control and medical administration, respectively. In

248

addition, the head of another local designated hospital served as the deputy hospital

249

director, thereby ensuring that critically ill patients had a transfer pathway. When in

250

operation, a general commander, medical teams, nursing teams, nosocomial infection

251

teams, and publicity teams were appointed for the mobile cabin hospitals, each of

252

which took charge of work in different domains.

253
254

V. No nosocomial infections occurred in Hanyang Mobile Cabin Hospital

255

There were some measures that ensured that no nosocomial infections occurred in

256

Hanyang Mobile Cabin Hospital. First, the division of the “three zones and two

257

passages” was executed appropriately as described above. while as in most MCH, a

258

correct airflow direction could not be made from positive pressure in the clean zone to

259

negative pressure in the contaminated zone in Hanyang MCH in an emergency

260

situation. Secondly, special nosocomial infection teams were formed, consisting of

261

nosocomial infection specialists and part of the nursing staff. 24-hour supervision

262

were performed by this special team for medical staff and other types of staff (e.g.

263

security and cleaning staff) over the proper wearing and removal of protective

264

equipment, to ensure that the prevention and control of nosocomial infections were in

265

place. Thirdly, no material was permitted to be taken out of the contaminated zone in

266

order to ensure no nosocomial infection may occur. Therefore, the data was taken in

267

form of pictures and transferred to headquarters outside the cabin hospital. Lastly but

268

also importantly, medical staff did not go home but returned to their designated hotels

269

after work ensuring that they could not spreading the virus to their family members.

270

Furthermore, medical staff did not take in any food and drinks without doffing PPE

271

when they were working continuously for 6 hours in every shift, once they went back

272

to their residency after work, they conducted immediate personal hygiene, including

273

bathing, eye, ear, mouth and washing the nose, before eating. and timely disinfection

274

of clothing (such as boiling water, or chlorine-containing disinfectant treatment) were

275

performed in order to ensure contamination and infection should not occur in

276

residency.

277
278

VI. The patients’ livelihoods was safeguarded in mobile cabin hospitals

279

Mobile cabin hospitals must safeguard the daily lives of all patients, and guaranteeing

280

the livelihoods of nearly a thousand patients in Hanyang mobile cabin Hospital,which

281

was not an easy task. The normal operation of mobile cabin hospitals involved full

282

preparations in terms of livelihood, security guarantee, hygiene, activities and

283

entertainment, and other aspects. Firstly, during the hospitalization and quarantine

284

period, the patients’livehood including clothing, three meals a day, bed linens, paper

285

towels, and other daily necessities, as well as heating systems for the winter were

286

fully managed by the government freely. Secondly, safety protection measures were

287

implemented appropriately. In addition to taking precautions for fire safety, it was also

288

necessary to ensure that conflicts and riots did not occur among patients during

289

hospitalization. These were guaranteed by having a certain ratio of security personnel

290

to patents and staffs. Furthermore, in order to provide patients with an appropriate

291

amount of space for activities, it was also necessary to set up reading rooms,

292

entertainment areas and other facilities to assist in the patients’ daily recreation, thus

293

ensuring their emotional well-being.

294

During the management of the patients, we adopted a volunteer system, whereby

295

responsible, caring people and activists were selected from each medical unit to serve

296

as unit leaders to assist in management. This enhanced the patients’ daily life

297

management efficiency and orderliness, while also greatly reducing the pressure on

medical staff.

VII. Treatment regime of patients in mobile cabin hospitals

301

The adopted main treatment approaches were a combination of traditional Chinese

302

and Western medicine. However, given the limited supply of drugs, the preferred

303

medications were based on traditional Chinese medicine, and the easily available

304

arbidol, and drugs with fewer side effects etc. Biochemical and other tests were not

305

carried out in the mobile cabin hospitals, and hence the side effects of the drugs could

306

not be fully monitored, which was one of the limitations of mobile cabin hospitals.

307

The special treatment approaches adopted in mobile cabin hospitals included

308

psychological treatment, such as providing comfort, alleviation, and social

309

activities(see supplemetal material4). These measures could all effectively reduce

310

patients’ mental anxiety, while also enhancing the enthusiasm of doctors and patients

311

in working harmoniously together to combat the disease.

312

Based on the discharge criteria in Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel

313

Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7).[19] in China, patients who improved

314

significantly underwent nucleic acid testing(Figure4b) and CT scan(Figure4b).

The mobile cabin hospitals have the advantage of large capacity, low cost and fast

326

construction speed. Treatment in the cabin hospital mainly included basic medical

327

care and observation of clinical changes, so that severe patients can be transferred to

328

designated hospitals as soon as possible for treatment so as to improve the cure rate

329

[20]

330

spreading occurs at the outbreak of an epidemic when conventional medical resources

331

are not so sufficient. However, if the disease breaks out nationwide and the population

332

has reached a state referred to as herd immunity, the need for cabin hospitals would be

333

greatly reduced

334

presenting mild symptoms, with few severe chronic diseases, self-care ability, no

335

mental abnormalities, and active cooperation with medical personnel. In order to

336

ensure the normal operation of the cabin hospital, adequate medical staff, reasonable

337

medical management system and adequate supplies of livehoods were required.

338

Furthermore, the basic mental needs and privacy of patients, and hospital security

339

measures should also be taken into account.

Discussion

342

Throughout human history, infectious diseases posed a huge threat to mankind, killing

343

millions of people. This was the case in the 1918 Pandemic, the Black Death, SARS

344

and many others, which killed 50 million, 25 million and 744 people worldwide,

345

respectively [22-24]. In the course of history, there had been precedents using temporary

346

hospitals to fight against epidemics. For example, during the plague outbreak in the

347

Qin Dynasty in China, railway carriages were employed to isolate patients, so as to

348

cut off the source of infection, resulting in curbing the spread of diseases effectively.

349

Moreover, a special infectious hospital (Xiao tang shan Hospital) was established in

350

combating SARS in 2003. Nevertheless, there has no any application of the cabin

351

hospital in dealing with an emergency situation of infectious diseases. COVID-19 was

352

shown to be more highly infectious than any other previous contagious disease [25-26].

353

In this situation, there had been over ten thousand new cases in less than one month,

354

causing an emergency situation because medical resources could not be increased

355

accordingly. Home quarantine was adopted extensively at an early stage in China for

356

mild patients[27-28] but unfortunately turned out to be ineffective due to the consistent

357

spread of the virus in families in Wuhan. On these basis, in order to cut off the source

358

of infection thoroughly, China initiated to employ cabin hospitals accompanied with a

359

free treatment strategy to achieved the aim of accepting all infected patients, which

360

was shown to be extremely effective, leading to a curbing of the epidemic in Wuhan

361

in only two incubation period of 14 days. There were also other alternative measures

362

such as the use of hotels to provide basic home care for patients with mild cases in

363

Korea, which might have provided a more comfortable livelihood and privacy for

364

patients. Otherwise, this kind of management could only have worked in a setting

365

with limited spreading of the virus but would be difficult to cope with an epidemic

366

which had caused large scale impact. Therefore, in the case of the widespread

367

epidemic the employment of cabin hospital maybe an alternative effective measure to

368

control the infectious diseases.

369
370

There were several benefits from the employment of Mobile Cabin Hospitals. With

371

this kind of temporary hospital, all confirmed mild cases received compulsory

372

quarantine in that the sources of infection were cut off quickly and thoroughly when

373

compared to uncontained home quarantine. The strict isolation of patients with mild

374

disease symptoms from the outside world in mobile cabin hospitals helped to reduce

375

the risk of infection among the healthy population and increased the efficiency of

376

centralized diagnosis and treatment by medical staff. As for the patients themselves,

377

this approach reduced the frequency of traveling to and from the hospital, while also

378

preventing transmission to their family members, which slowed down an increase in

379

new cases. Wuhan witnessed this significant effect in only two incubation periods as

380

the newly diagnosed case dropped from over 3 thousand to single digits. Secondly, on

381

one hand, the mild patients were treated at a centralized location and as they were

382

taken care under regular procedures in the Mobile Cabin Hospital, they recovered

383

more rapidly. On the other hand, the severe cases were identified at an early stage and

384

transfer to designated hospital for further treatment, which enabled so many severe

385

cases to be treated effectively as early as possible. Thirdly, relying on the high

386

capacities of mobile cabin hospital for mild cases, sufficient beds in designated

387

hospitals were available for critically ill patients. In addition, following centralized

388

treatment led to a significant increase in recovery rate, a dramatic decrease in

389

mortality rate, and thereby a gradual increase in the number of cured and discharged

390

patients. In summary, by employing cabin hospital, thousands of severe patients were

391

rescued promptly, the cure rate of severe case increased from 14% to 89%. As a result,

392

after 2 incubation periods of using Mobile Cabin Hospital to combat COVID19, the

393

epidemic was effectively curbed, the number of cumulative cases dropped from its

394

peak of more than 80,000 to 14,000. So, all the Cabin Hospital completed their tasks

395

and were closed before Mar 10[29].

396
397

In China, 34000 medical staff who aided in Hubei achieved not to get infected due to

398

adhering to the following points. Firstly, everyone was very cautious and attached

399

great importance to it in spirit, so they pursued the personal protection as rigorous as

400

possible. Secondly, China took a very strict attitude to prevent the spread of the virus.

401

Due to the risk of aerosol transmission of the new coronavirus disease[30], all possible

402

transmission routes were cut off, including different entry and exit routes for medical

403

staff and patients, three zones and two channels constructed for prevention of cross

404

infection, doffing PPE layer by layer plus supervision by special team for reducing the

405

risk of self-contamination by PPE, including that all possible contaminated media

406

were being isolated , e.g. all items were not permitted to be taken out, strict

407

three-level protection medical personnel, timely cleaning after work and other

408

measures to ensure that personnel would not be infected. These measures may be

409

regarded as excessive protection, but because of strict adherence, Chinese medical

410

workers were protected well with no cross infection rather than the highly infected

411

rate of about 16% in the United States [31]. Therefore, these preventive measures were

412

worth learning for perfection in the global medical system for infectious diseases.

413
414

Although MCH had played an important role in combatting COVID19 in China, in

415

our view, there were some suggestions to improve the feasibility for implementation

416

of MCH:

417

1. A mature and rapid response management system for infectious disease should be

418

established. Although a powerful management team of mobile cabin hospital was

419

organized by the emergency medical rescue team. The working systems made by the

420

emergency medical team in cooperation with local medical staff and medical staff

421

from nationwide had many defects: they were crude due to temporary thought, many

422

strategies were constantly honed due to immaturity, which consumed much time. If a

423

mature and rapid response management system for infectious disease can be

424

established, a special management team should be trained based on previous

425

experiences, the management efficiency could be greatly improved, medical staff and

426

materials might be greatly reduced too.

427
428

2. Some management strategies should be optimized: (1) the structure of the medical

429

staff can be adjusted. Since most patients in MCH were mild patients who could take

430

care of themselves, the core problems of MCH operation were quarantine, basic

431

medical care, arrangement of life and daily management of the patients. The demand

432

of medical staff was not necessarily high. For example, the number of senior

433

professional clinicians could be reduced appropriately, and the number of junior

434

doctors of healthcare staff could be increased to do general care observation, which

435

can greatly reduce the demand for medical personnel (2). Leader patients chosen from

436

every unit to help manage the life of the patients was a useful and effective method to

437

improve management efficiency of MCH and may also reduce the cost and human

438

resources. (3) Intelligent management links were recommended if possible. Automatic

439

simple COVID19 electronic case history system can be filled in before admission to

440

enhance the working efficiency, and the increased use of video instruments in the

441

ward round was able to greatly reduce the exposure of medical staff as well as the use

442

of PPE, and an intelligent program for a screening procedure for nucleic acid

443

detection and CT imaging result could be implemented so as to greatly improve the

444

working efficiency and reduce the number of working staff.

445
446

3. It was suggested to establish an emergency management system of the Mobile

447

Cabin Hospital, which was intended help to cut off the source of infection and prevent

448

the further spread of infectious diseases in the early stage of community transmission.

449

The establishment of the emergency management system of mobile cabin hospitals

450

was able to help to deal with large-scale infectious diseases. Different countries may

451

set up emergency management teams for infectious diseases in different regions, and

452

set up emergency response groups for infectious diseases in hospitals at different

453

levels. In this way, the highest administrative unit can mobilize all the medical staff of

454

the emergency teams of hospitals to participate in early stage of epidemic. What is

455

more, sufficient medical personnel can be quickly mobilized to participate in the

456

construction and management of an MCH. Although many countries appeared to have

457

a well-established medical system, they had not prepared for prevention and control

458

of the epidemic of COVID 19, maybe due to not experiencing large-scale infectious

459

diseases in the last 50 years, except countries in Southeast Asia, which were affected

460

by SARS in 2003 and the Middle East by MERS. As a result, the global prevention

461

and control measures of the new epidemic were not effective, causing the continuous

462

spread of the disease. Therefore, it is suggested that the international infectious

463

disease prevention and control system should be strengthened.

464
465

After nearly 2 incubation periods of intense efforts, as the number of newly diagnosed

466

cases in Wuhan, the center of epidemic, dropped, the number of new cases in Hubei

467

and China as a whole finally decreased to single digits. Fighting against COVID with

468

mobile cabin hospital was a useful initiative in China and was shown to be effective

469

in handling the COVID19 epidemic [20], and these experiences may serve as a helpful

470

reference for other countries with epidemic outbreaks.

471
472

However, Mobile cabin hospitals also have several notable limitations. For example,

473

they had modest facilities, poor conditions for medical treatment, and a low level of

474

nosocomial infection protection. Therefore, they were not capable of handling severe

475

cases, and it was recommended that only mild cases who meet the admission criteria

476

were accepted. Patients with worsening conditions or underlying diseases that were

477

more challenging to treat should be transferred to designated hospitals for treatment.

478

therefore, once the epidemic had eased, mobile cabin hospitals should be closed as

479

soon as possible, and the main strategy should be switched to admitting and treating

480

patients in designated hospitals [32].

481
482

Currently, the COVID-19 epidemic has spread throughout the world. On March 11,

483

the World Health Organization Director-General Tedros announced that it constituted

484

a global pandemic. At this time, China had controlled the most of the native epidemic

485

for a longer period of time but it also encountered mostly imported case for quite long

486

periods. Therefore, many medical staff members have been working in the front

487

line to prevent the second outbreak of COVID until June 26. As of June 26, a total of

488

9638755 cases were confirmed worldwide outside of China, with more than 190371

489

newly diagnosed cases and 5000 new deaths in a single day, as well as a total of more

490

than 487426 deaths

491

infectious diseases are raging throughout the world. As a community joined by human

492

destiny, the whole world must face this together and jointly launch emergency

493

response strategies. It is our hope that China’s experiences in operating mobile cabin

494

hospitals will help the global response to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in

495

the future, thus ensuring that the epidemic will come under control as soon as

[32-34]

. We are now living in a time when Covid-19 and other

Figure 1: Demographics of newly diagnosed and cured cases, cumulative

644

diagnoses and cured cases over time in Wuhan

645

Since the opening of the mobile cabin hospital on Feb 5th, the number of newly

646

diagnosed cases in Wuhan (capital of Hubei province), the center of the epidemic,

647

gradually decreased. This decrease could also be observed in Hubei Province, and the

648

rest of China. Moreover, 13436 cases were clinical diagnosed on Feb 12th due to

649

emergency strategy in this special time according to diagnosis and treatment protocol

650

of novel coronaviral pneumonia (trial version5) in China. The number of newly

651

diagnosed cases dropped to below 1000 and newly cured cases increased in Wuhan

652

and the two lines crossed on Feb 20th, suggesting an inflection point of the epidemic.

653

Moreover, the rate of cumulative diagnosed cases has gradually slowed down, and

654

leveled off from then on. As the number of cured cases increased, the number of

655

existing confirmed cases decreased significantly, suggesting that the epidemic had

656

been effectively curbed.

discharge in Hanyang Mobile Cabin Hospital

688

As was shown in Figure 3, a large number of patients were admitted at an early time

689

on Feb 11, causing the mobile cabin hospital to be filled rapidly in just four days.

690

There were about 50 patients discharged every day about 10 days later when the

691

patients gradually recovered. In total, about 40% of patients were transferred to

692

designated hospitals for treatment due to the severity of Covid-19 infections or other

693

underlying basic diseases. There were nearly 200 critically ill patients transferred to

694

designated hospitals on March 8, when the cabin hospital was closed because the

695

epidemic in Wuhan had been curbed.
