Abstract:
The durability of the antibody response following severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections has not been fully elucidated. We have performed a
cross-sectional study in one of the largest slums of Buenos Aires, Barrio Padre Mugica in
June 2020, detecting a seroprevalence of 53.4%. To evaluate the persistence of the humoral
response against SARS-CoV-2 in this area, we designed a second study assessing only the
people that were IgG positive in the first survey. The IgG levels against the full spike (S)
protein in 175 individuals that were seropositive, at least 6 months before, were evaluated in
a second survey. The positivity rate was 92.0%, 161 from 175 individuals remained IgG
positive. We observed a contraction in the overall IgG levels measured by ELISA. The median
IgG dropped 62% from June to December 2020. Most of the individuals tested (87%) reported
to be asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic. No difference was found between men and
women, but people aged less than 50 showed a lower IgG level in each period compared to
older individuals. Our data indicate sustained humoral immunity for at least 6 months in a

specific socio-economical setting in a population that was mainly asymptomatic for COVID19.
Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest medical and socio-economic challenge of
our time (1). Still there are no effective antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19 cases and the
recently approved vaccines are not at reach for most of the world population (2–6). It is crucial
to understand how long immunity against SARS-CoV-2 persists in infected individuals for
decision-making policies and vaccination planning.
Antibody mediated immunity is thought to protect individuals from SARS-CoV-2 by interfering
with viral infection. Most of the neutralizing antibodies are directed against the S protein and
more specifically to the receptor binding domain RBD (7). Multiple studies have shown that
the majority of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals produce S- and RBD-specific antibodies
during the first 2 weeks of the primary response (8). In addition, monoclonal antibodies
against this viral protein neutralize the virus in vitro and in vivo (9–11). The accumulated
information indicates that circulating neutralizing antibodies likely contribute to protection of
reinfection, either by their presence in plasma or rapid expression by memory B cells (9,12).
In this regard, it has been recently shown that RBD-specific B cells increase and persist up
to 8 months post infection (13,14).
Different studies have shown both sustained and declined humoral responses after 6 months
of SARS-CoV-2 infection (13,15,16). Several reports have indicated a contraction phase of
IgG levels after 2-3 months of infection, followed by a stabilization at relatively high levels
over a 6 month period (15). In contrast, other studies have shown a decay in IgG titers as a
function of time, reaching undetectable levels during convalescent phases (10).These
observations raise a number of questions. Does the longevity of circulating antibodies against

SARS-CoV-2 depend on the population assessed? Is it different among inhabitants of
wealthy or vulnerable neighborhoods, or other environments such as health care
professionals or nursing homes residents?

Does the duration of circulating antibodies

depend on the mode of viral spread in specific socio-economical settings? With no clear
answers to these questions, there is a need to study factors that affect the spread of the virus
and the dynamics of the immune responses in different geographic, demographic, and
socioeconomic areas.
Here, we focused on evaluating the durability of antibodies in the Barrio Padre Mugica, one
of the most vulnerable and overcrowded slums of Buenos Aires City, with more than 40.000
inhabitants (17). The first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this Barrio was reported four days
after the national mandatory quarantine on March 19th 2020. In June, after a decay in the
number of reported SARS-CoV-2 infections in this Barrio, the first seroprevalence survey was
performed, and a second study was set in December to evaluate the duration of IgG among
seropositive individuals identified in the first survey.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement: The study was approved by the institutional review board of the "Hospital
de Niños, Dr. Ricardo Gutierrez", Argentina. Informed consent was obtained from every
participant. The study protocol was registered in clinicaltrials.gov. NCT04673279
Population and settings: The study was performed in Barrio Padre Mugica, one of the most
overcrowded slums with more than 40000 inhabitants, and almost 1500 people experiencing
homelessness. The Barrio is located next to the main passenger transfer center of the City
of Buenos Aires and near the neighborhoods named Retiro and Recoleta. It is a
heterogeneous slum, with 10 different geographical sectors, each presenting particular
cultural and social characteristics. Areas: Bajo Autopista, Comunicaciones, Cristo Obrero,

Ferroviario, Güemes, Inmigrantes, Playón Este, Playón Oeste, San Martín and YPF. The
cohort included residents above 14 years that were positive IgG against SARS-COV-2 in
June 2020.
The cross-sectional survey was carried out between December 3er and December 19th
2020, 8 months after the initial reported COVID-19 cases in Barrio Padre Mugica, and 6
months after the first seroprevalence study (18).
Data collection and analysis methods: The survey collected information of the following
variables: age, biological sex, symptoms two months before the study, living and sharing
spaces with confirmed COVID-19 case, number of households in the building and the sector
of Barrio Mugica. Blood sample collection and epidemiological data were collected and
entered in a secure database. The field data was obtained by community health care
workers who lived in Barrio Padre Mugica.
Specific anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were measured from blood samples collected by finger
pricking. Samples were taken at the doorstep of each household. IgG antibodies against the
trimeric S protein were measured using the ELISA COVIDAR test (8). The COVIDAR IgG
test was approved by Argentina's national drug regulatory agency (ANMAT, National
Administration for Drugs, Food and Medical Devices) (26). Performance characteristics of the
kit indicate a sensitivity of more than 90% after 21 days and more than 95% after 45 days of
symptoms onset. The specificity was set to be 100% (8).
Sample Size and Statistical analysis: In the first survey 426 seropositive individuals were
identified. For the second survey, it was defined to reach out 184 individuals from the original
426, in order to detect at least 30% of antibody persistence (5% precision and 95%
confidence). A proportionate stratified random sampling was performed in all ten sectors of
the Barrio.

Continuous variables were expressed as the mean (standard deviation [SD]) or median
(interquartile range (IQR)) and compared by the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical
variables were expressed as the frequency (%). IgG levels during the follow-up were
compared using the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test. Significant level was set in
0.05 and statistical analysis was performed with software R version 4.0.2
Funding source
The National and local Ministries of Health provided medical supplies for the survey and for
the virology laboratory to perform the ELISA test for SARS-COV-2 antibodies detection. The
COVIDAR group provided the Serokits for sampling and the ELISA COVIDAR IgG kits,
supported by FOCEM and Asoc. SAND.
None of the funding sources provided economical support for the data collection, statistical
analysis, or were used to write the manuscript, or to submit it for publication.
Results
The first reported case of SARS CoV-2 infection in the Barrio Padre Mugica was reported on
March 22nd. From then, reported cases rapidly increased reaching a peak of over 100 cases
a day in May 2020 (Fig. 1). In order to study seroprevalence and antibody persistence, two
surveys were performed: the first one when the daily reported cases dropped to under 10
cases a day, on June 20 (18), and the second one on December, 7 months from the peak
and 6 months from the first survey (Fig. 1).

Figure 1 COVID-19 Incident Cases year 2020 at Barrio Padre Mugica, Buenos Aires, Argentina. The two surveys
SeroCovid-POB Study (06/2020) and LTCovid Study (12/2020) are indicated on the top.

The survey performed in June 2020 included a cohort of 873 inhabitants of different sectors
of the Barrio. ELISA based IgG anti-S of SARS-CoV-2 measurements indicated 421
seropositive cases, resulting in 53.4% seroprevalence (95%IC 52.8% to 54.1%). In
December 2020, 220 individuals of the seropositive group were contacted and invited to a
second survey, from which 175 agreed to participate, with a response rate of 87%. The field
data was obtained by community health care workers who lived in Barrio Padre Mugica.
They received training for sampling and collecting survey information. The participatory
action research was the groundwork that allowed this study.
The cohort included inhabitants from all 10 areas of the Barrio Padre Mugica, each presenting
particular cultural and social characteristics. The amount of individuals selected was based
on the population of each area. Regarding the household's characteristics, the median of
people living in the same dwelling was 4 (IQR 2–5) and 55 (31%) shared kitchen and

bathroom. Sixty one participant (34.8%) knew a SARS-CoV-2 positive household relative.
The persistence of IgG anti-S detected in each area of the Barrio was as follows: Güemes
95% (41 of 43), Playón Oeste 97% (33 of 34), Bajo Playón Este 100% (24 of 24), Ferroviario
75% (12 of 16), San Martín 100% (16 of 16), YPF 57% (8 of 14), Bajo Autopista 100% (10 of
10), Cristo Obrero 100% (11 of 11), Inmigrantes 100% (5 of 5), Comunicaciones 50% (1 of
2) (Fig 2). The study revealed 92% (CI 95% 86.9-95.6) persistence of IgG antibodies antiSARS. Thus, most of the people that were seropositive in the first survey retained detectable
IgGs in the second survey.

very high rate of asymptomatic infection in this population. The IgG median level detected in
June 2020, measured as optical density OD, was 2.03 (IQR 1.30-3.17). In December 2020
the median OD was 1.26 (IQR 0.69-2.34), indicating a drop of IgG levels of 62% (Fig 3A).
Within each study period, no differences in IgG levels were found by sex and presence of
symptoms. However, we found that older people (>50 years) displayed greater levels of IgG
in both periods compared to people under 50 years (Fig 3B), and both levels declined in the
six month period. For >50, IgG levels dropped from median IgG of 3.12 (1.56-3.19) to 1.80
(0.92-2.80) and for <50, from median IgG of 1.93 (1.15-3.00) to 1.18 (0.63-2.04).

This is one of the first reports showing IgG anti-SARS persistence in Latin America. We found
that 92% of people living in a vulnerable neighborhood in Argentina retained detectable IgG
anti-S after at least six month of infection. The persistence of antibodies could be longer (up
to 8 months) as the wave peak in that neighborhood occurred before the first cross-sectional
study (Fig. 1). The high prevalence of sustained natural immunity found here is of great value
for future public health control measures.
This population-based study revealed about 87% of SARS-CoV-2 infected participants
without any relevant clinical symptoms. It has been previously reported that asymptomatic
individuals showed earlier waning of IgG levels, as compared with symptomatic ones. The
immune responses of asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have not been
well described, mainly because they are more difficult to detect. Here, in a population study
of a vulnerable neighborhood, we found a 92% persistence of IgG, which contrasts with that
observed in other cohorts. For instance, about 40% of asymptomatic cases, identified as
close contacts of qPCR positive cases, were reported to become seronegative in an early
convalescent phase (10). These observations suggest that infections in distinct settings may
account for different immunological outcomes. We have to bear in mind that different
serologic tests used in different studies could yield distinct results. It has been shown with
the same samples that anti-S detection displayed higher sensitivity to detect long-lasting IgGs
than that with anti-nucleocapsid detection (19).
We found an average contraction of 63% in circulating IgG levels in a six-month period, which
is in agreement with previous reports (15) . However, it has been shown that a memory phase
is triggered when B lymphocytes reactivate antibody production in face of a new infection
phase (14,20). In this regard, low or undetectable levels of IgG in convalescent individuals,
were found to be followed by a rapid increase in IgG levels after vaccination (21–23). With

the recent approval of highly effective vaccines for COVID-19, data on the persistence of
immune responses are of central importance. In particular to define whether previously
infected people should be vaccinated with full doses and to define priorities in control actions.
The participatory action research process applied here was a cornerstone for gathering the
required cohort, and key for accomplishing this study. The “community of inquiry and action”
evolved throughout the process, addressing questions that were highly relevant for those who
participated in the study. Also, it is important to highlight that co-researchers directly involved
in the field work, were community health workers living in the neighborhood (24). This
participatory action challenges the notion that the community is a passive object of study,
empowering and increasing the knowledge of community members (25).
The current focus for pandemic control is to attain a massive vaccination in a timely fashion.
Effective vaccines are being developed and their phase 3 studies are being published.
Although their short time efficacy has been already proved for several vaccines, there is not
yet guarantee that this protection is long-lasting. Thus, it is essential to evaluate the duration
of the immune responses during this world-wide vaccination process and compare it with that
in natural infections.
In conclusion, our work provides important data on persistence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG
antibodies in a vulnerable neighborhood for at least six months after a wave of infections.
The high prevalence of sustained natural immunity found in this study will help to elaborate
pandemic control measures.
