ABSTRACT
Background: Syndromic surveillance systems for COVID-19 are being increasingly used to
track and predict outbreaks of confirmed cases. Seasonal circulating respiratory viruses share
syndromic overlap with COVID-19, and it is unknown how they will impact the performance of
syndromic surveillance tools. Here we investigated the role of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory
virus test positivity on COVID-19 two independent syndromic surveillance systems in Ontario,
Canada.
Methods: We compared the weekly number of reported COVID-19 cases reported in the
province of Ontario against two syndromic surveillance metrics: 1) the proportion of respondents
with a self-reported COVID-like illness (CLI) from COVID Near You (CNY) and 2) the
proportion of emergency department visits for upper respiratory conditions from the Acute Care
Enhanced Surveillance (ACES) system. Separately, we plotted the percent positivity for other
seasonal respiratory viruses over the same time period and reported Pearson’s correlation
coefficients before and after the uncoupling of syndromic tools to COVID-19 cases.
Results: There were strong positive correlations of both CLI and ED visits for upper respiratory
causes with COVID-19 cases up to and including a rise in entero/rhinovirus (r = 0.86 and 0.87,
respectively). There was a strong negative correlation of both CLI and ED visits for upper
respiratory causes with COVID-19 cases (r = -0.85 and -0.91, respectively) during a fall in
entero/rhinovirus.
Interpretation: Two methods of syndromic surveillance showed strong positive correlations
with COVID-19 confirmed case counts before and during a rise in circulating entero/rhinovirus.
However, as positivity for enterovirus/rhinovirus fell in late September 2020, syndromic signals
became uncoupled from COVID-19 cases and instead tracked the fall in entero/rhinovirus. This
finding provides proof-of-principle that regional transmission of seasonal respiratory viruses may
complicate the interpretation of COVID-19 surveillance data. It is imperative that surveillance
systems incorporate other respiratory virus testing data in order to more accurately track and
forecast COVID-19 disease activity.

Emerging evidence is showing that syndromic surveillance systems for COVID-19 can be used
to predict outbreaks of confirmed cases with high spatial and temporal resolution.1–3 These
methods can be used as an early warning system to guide regional public health policy decisions.
Tools include passive methods (e.g. tracking healthcare encounters), as well as more active
participatory surveillance, whereby individuals self-report symptoms using phone or internet.2,3
Currently, it is unknown how seasonal circulating respiratory viruses impact the performance of
COVID-19 surveillance tools, although their symptomatic overlap makes this a theoretical
concern.4 We investigated the role of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus test positivity on two
independent COVID-19 syndromic surveillance systems in Ontario, Canada.

METHODS

Our data sources were: 1) self-reported symptoms from COVID Near You (CNY), 2) emergency
department (ED) visits for upper respiratory conditions from the Acute Care Enhanced
Surveillance (ACES) system, 3) provincial laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case counts and 4)
percent positivity for other respiratory viruses reported by Public Health Ontario, from April
20th, 2020 to November 1st. COVID-19-like illness (CLI) from CNY was defined using the CDC
Surveillance Case Definition for COVID-19.5 ACES uses machine learning algorithms to
categorize ED visit chief complaints into clinical syndromes.6 See supplemental methods for full
description on data sources and syndromic definitions.

We compared the weekly (by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) date week
number of reported COVID-19 cases against the proportion of CNY respondents with CLI and
the proportion of all emergency department visits for an upper-respiratory condition. Separately,
we plotted the percent positivity for other respiratory viruses over the same time period. We

reported Pearson’s correlation coefficients before and after the uncoupling of syndromic tools to
COVID-19 cases. The data were analyzed using R version 4.0.1 in the RStudio software
environment, version 1.1.463 (RStudio Inc., Boston, MA).

The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the University of Toronto and a waiver
of informed consent was granted because the data were collected for public health surveillance
purposes.

RESULTS
There were strong positive correlations of both CLI and ED visits for upper respiratory causes
with COVID-19 cases up to and including week 40 (r = 0.86 and 0.87, respectively).
Subsequently, from week 41–45 there was a strong negative correlation of both CLI and ED
visits for upper respiratory causes with COVID-19 cases (r = -0.85 and -0.91, respectively).
There was also an observed rise in enterovirus/rhinovirus percent positivity in Ontario from
weeks 35 to week 39, to a peak of 22.8% in week 39, and subsequent fall in weeks 39 – 44
(figure 1B).

Two methods of syndromic surveillance showed strong positive correlations with COVID-19
confirmed case counts before and during a rise in circulating entero/rhinovirus. However, as
positivity for enterovirus/rhinovirus fell in late September 2020, syndromic signals became
uncoupled from COVID-19 cases. It is now apparent that although these seemed to be tracking
closely in weeks 34-40, the rise in syndromic cases in this period reflected rapidly rising
entero/rhinovirus disease activity rather than COVID-19. Even milder, seasonal respiratory
viruses such as rhinoviruses have considerable syndromic overlap with COVID-194. The absence
of an envelope may explain why rhinoviruses tend to be more robust in diverse environments,
and why they have spread so easily despite current public health measures. This finding provides
proof-of-principle that regional transmission of seasonal respiratory viruses may complicate the
interpretation of COVID-19 surveillance data. It is imperative that surveillance systems
incorporate other respiratory virus testing data in order to more accurately track and forecast
COVID-19 disease activity.
