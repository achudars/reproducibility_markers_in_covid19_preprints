ABSTRACT

Objectives. SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly evolving pandemic causing great morbimortality.
Medical therapy with hydroxicloroquine, azitromycin and protease inhibitors is being
empirically used, with reported data of QTc interval prolongation. Our aim is to assess
QT interval behaviour in a not critically ill and not monitored cohort of patients.
Design. We evaluated admitted and ambulatory patients with COVID-19 patients with
12 lead electrocardiogram at 48 hours after treatment initiation. Other clinical and
analytical variables were collected. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the
magnitude of the QT interval prolongation under treatment and to identify clinical,
analytical and electrocardiographic risk markers of QT prolongation independent
predictors.
Results. We included 219 patients (mean age of 63.6 ± 17.4 years, 48.9% were women
and 16.4% were outpatients. The median baseline QTc was 416 ms (IQR 404-433), and
after treatment QTc was prolonged to 423 ms (405-438) (P < 0.001), with an average
increase of 1.8%. Most of the patients presented a normal QTc under treatment, with
only 31 cases (14,1 %) showing a QTc interval > 460 ms, and just one case with QTc >
500 ms. Advanced age, longer QTc basal at the basal ECG and lower potassium levels
were independent predictors of QTc interval prolongation.
Conclusions. Ambulatory and not critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated with
hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and/or antiretrovirals develop a significant, but not
relevant, QT interval prolongation.

What is already known about this subject?
Treatment for COVID 19 with empirical drugs hydroxicloroquine, azitromycin and
protease inhibitors affects ventricular repolarization by prolonging the QT interval in a
variable degree basing upon heterogeneous studies

What does this study add?

Not critically ill patients with COVID 19 develop a non relevant QT interval
prolongation, leading to a modest arrhythmic risk increase, overall in patients with
normal basal ECG

How might this impact on clinical practice?
Our findings are significant as ECG monitoring of COVID 19 patients is costly and
difficult. Ambulatory and stable patients with normal basal ECG might nor benefit from
QT assessment afeter treatment initiation

BACKGROUND
Since late 2019, a new coronavirus is responsible for the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing a worldwide pandemic.1
It has spread rapidly throughout the world with a high mortality rate, especially among
older adults with cardiovascular disease.2 There is currently no specific preventive or
therapeutic strategy approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), so an empiric approach with conventional
antimalarial, antibiotic or antiviral drugs are being evaluated for COVID-19. Some of
them have been proven to have in-vitro antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2.
Particularly hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) seems to limit the virus entry likely through
inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors.3 Recently, one study
has suggested that the concomitant use of azithromycin in combination with HCQ is
associated with a more rapid resolution of virus detection than HCQ alone.4 Finally,
lopinavir/ritonavir is a protease inhibitor largely used in HIV infection, and has in-vitro
activity against SARS-CoV-2.5 While the optimal strategy to treatment of COVID-19 is
uncertain, a combination of these drugs is the accepted worldwide approach in
symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Beyond their limited evidence for treating COVID-19, the scientific community
is aware of adverse effects, in particular the QT interval prolongation. There are
sporadic data reporting QT interval prolongation with hydroxychloroquine, when it is
used in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. On the other hand, azithromycin is
a well-recognized ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) aetiology,

METHODS

Population and study design:
A transversal study was conducted between March 23 and April 24, 2020 in a
tertiary referral hospital. Patients presenting to our emergency department (ED) with
confirmed diagnosis or high clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection and treated
whether an inpatient or outpatient management, were identified. Confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection was defined as positive nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and/or positive IgM and IgG serological test. High suspicion diagnosis was
realized by clinician criteria based on clinical characteristics, chest imaging, analytical
parameters and ruling out common infectious pathogens causing pneumonia, if
diagnostic tests were undetermined, negative or non-available. Ambulatory and
admitted patients with COVID-19 treated with one or more SARS-Cov-2 experimental
drugs (according to our hospital protocol, see appendix I) were included. Patients
readmitted for SARS-Cov-2 and those admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or
with mechanical ventilation at the time of baseline and control ECG were excluded. The
study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee and verbal informed consent was
obtained from participant patients.

Data collection
Twelve lead ECG was performed in all patients 48h after treatment initiation. In
addition, most of the patients had a basal ECG collected before the beginning of
medical therapy at the ED admission. Electrocardiographic analysis included heart
rhythm and rate, P-QRS-T intervals duration, atrioventricular and intraventricular
conduction disturbances and ventricular repolarization in all ECGs. The measurement of
the QT interval was preferably carried out on lead II, and V5-V6 if needed, starting at

the beginning of the Q wave and using the tangent method described by Postema et al.9
and corrected with the Bazett’s formula. Electrocardiographic assessment was
performed by two independent certified cardiac electrophysiologists who were blinded
to the patient's information.
Furthermore, baseline investigations included previous comorbidities, chronic
treatments, severity illness at ED, complete blood count, coagulation profile, serum
biochemical test (creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, electrolytes, renal and liver
function), and complementary treatment during hospitalization with QTc interval
prolongation risk were also recorded. Additionally, mortality during admission was
analysed.
The primary endpoint of the study was to determine the prevalence of clinically
significant QT interval prolongation under medical therapy for COVID-19, especially
QTc greater than 500 ms involving a higher arrhythmic risk. Other secondary aims were
to detect clinical or analytical independent predictors of QT interval prolongation and
quantify the QTc interval increasing from basal ECGs.

Drug therapy:
According to our centre protocol, patients with confirmed or high-suspicion of
COVID-19 received a combination of two or more of the following agents:
hydroxychloroquine 400 mg BID (loading dose) and 200mg BID during 5 days,
azithromycin 500 mg SID (loading dose) and 250mg SID during 5 days, and
Lopinavir/Ritonavir 400/100 mg BID or Darunavir/Ritonavir 600/100 mg BID during 7
to 14 days at physician criteria based on severity illness.

Statistical analysis:
Numerical variables are expressed as mean and standard deviation or, for nonnormally distributed variables, as median [interquartile range]. Categorical variables are
expressed as absolute and relative frequencies. To assess the agreement between the two
observers with respect to both, baseline and control QTc parameter measurements, the
Bland-Altman graphical method was used, calculated with the interval ± 1.96 times the
standard deviation from the mean difference. In addition, the intraclass correlation
coefficient has been calculated. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the baseline
and control QTc. A bivariate analysis has been carried out to analyze the variables that
are related to the QTc prolongation, establishing 460 ms as the cut-off point. The
categorical variables have been contrasted with the Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's
exact test in cases where applicability conditions were not met. For the quantitative
variables, the Student's t-test was used for independent samples and the Mann-Whitney
test was used for those variables with a non-normal distribution. With the variables in
which a p value of <0.20 was obtained, a multivariate logistic regression model was
constructed. The variable selection method was by successive steps backwards,
removing from the model at each step, those with p <0.10, and using the likelihood ratio
method to contrast the appropriate model at each step. For the final model, the odds
ratio is calculated along with its 95% confidence interval. The goodness of fit was
compared with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and its predictive capacity was evaluated
with the area under the ROC curve.

RESULTS
Baseline parameters:
Two hundred and nineteen patients with confirmed diagnosis or high suspect of
COVID-19 were included, with a mean age of 63.6 (± 17.4 years, 23-98 years), 107
were (48.9%) women. Thirty-six (16.4%) were outpatients. All patients had a control
ECG 48 hours after treatment initiation and 165 patients had a baseline ECG at ED
admission. At ED admission, 154 patients (93.3%) were on sinus rhythm and 11 on
atrial fibrillation (6.7%). One hundred and forty-eight patients (89.7%) had a narrow
QRS on admission, 3 had left bundle branch block (1.8%), 9 right bundle branch block
(5.5%), 4 bifascicular block (2.4%) and 1 ventricular paced rhythm (0.6%). Patients
were divided in two groups according to the treatment: group 1 (single or double
therapy) with 105 patients (47.9%) who received hydroxychloroquine and/or
azithromycin and group 2 (triple therapy) with 114 patients (52.1%) who received
hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and protease inhibitors (lopinavir-ritonavir or
darunavir-ritonavir). Only one patient (0.5%) did not received azithromycin and 9 did
not received hydroxychloroquine (4.1%). Baseline characteristics according to
treatment are shown in table 1; patients with triple therapy had a worse clinical
presentation during admission, with more fever, more multilobar pneumonia and worse
analytics parameters.

QTc interval Analysis:
Correlation between both ECG observers was excellent basing upon the result of
the Blant Altman test (Suplementary figure 1) with an intraclass coefficient of 0.903.
The spectrum of QTc distribution after treatment is shown in figure 1, with only
4 patients with QTc > 500 ms, most of them cases with wide QRS due to

intraventricular conduction disturbances or paced rhythm; one case with narrow QRS
complex developed a QTc interval > 500 ms. Only 14,1 % of the cases (n=31) presented
a QTc interval of more than 460 ms after treatment and no patient presented torsade de
pointes or arrhythmic death during admission. Table and figure 2 show a bivariate
model to identify variables associated with the presence of a QTc> 460 ms. There were
no differences in QTc between treatment groups 1 and 2.
The median baseline QTc was 416 ms (IQR 404-433), and after treatment QTc
was prolonged to 423 ms (405-438) (P < 0.001) (figure 3, panel A). An increase in QTc
between 0 and 5% was observed in most of the patients, with an average increase of
1.8% (-1.3 to 5.6%) (figure 3, panel B); importantly, no patient showed an increase
greater than 25%.
In the multivariate model (table 3) age was a risk factor, with an OR 1.05
[1,009-1,095]. For each year of age, the risk of prolonged QTc increased by 5%. The
baseline QTc is a risk factor, with an OR 1.06 [1,009-1,095]. For each ms of increasing
in baseline QTc interval, the risk of prolonged QTc increased by 5%. Basal potassium
acts as a protective factor. For each unit that increases basal potassium, the risk of
prolonged QTc is 3.29 times lower (1/0.3039). Predictive ability of the model was very
good, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.9130 (suplementary figure 2).

Follow-up:
Fourteen patients discontinued treatment (6.4%), being in 11 patients (5%) due
to QTc prolongation. The median hospital stay was 7 (5-11) days. After admission, 5
patients required intensive care, and only one of them in needing of orotracheal
intubation. Fifteen patients died (6.8%) and two of the outpatients required admission
during follow-up due to worsening symptoms.

DISCUSSION

Scientific community is facing against one of the hardest epidemiological crisis
in the last century, and safety regarding medical therapies used against SARS-Cov-2
infection seems critical to avoid iatrogenia. Indeed, significant concern about
ventricular arrhythmias and SCD in COVID-19 population have emerged, since
previous data about QT interval prolongation are reported with the use of
hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which added to the antiretroviral drugs have
been defined as “the corona cocktail”10. In this direction, a recent report from the Italian
group in Lombardia has warned about the important increase in out-of-hospital cardiac
arrests, suggesting a hypothetical link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and this high
rate of ventricular arrhythmias11. One of the connections might be the QTc prolongation
and torsade de pointes induced by drugs (DI-TdP) in ambulatory and admitted, but not
ECG-monitored, medically treated patients with COVID-19. Our study focuses on this
specific group of patients that, due to a not so serious SARS-CoV-2 disease stage, are
not admitted to the ICU, or they even are discharged without admission to hospital. The
lack of ECG monitoring would markedly reduce the survival chances of these patients
in case of DI-TdP. Our data are strongly reassuring about the use of this combination of
drugs in this specific cohort of patients, as we have not detected a clinically relevant
QTc interval prolongation attributable to the treatment. Interestingly, our serie is the
first, as far as we know, to test the safety of the combination of the three drugs,
including antiretrovirals, against COVID-19.
There are some recent reports describing a high percentage of patients
developing significant QT interval prolongation (more than 500 ms) in patients with
COVID-19, albeit in heterogeneous cohort of patients12-14. A recent report from the
New York group found a significant QTc interval prolongation in a substantial

proportion of patients, being more pronounced in patients with congestive heart failure,
on amiodarone or with higher basal QTc intervals12. They even present a case of DI-Tdp
successfully defibrillated. However, the report of TdP cases in COVID-19 patients is
scarce and it likely occurs in ECG-monitored patients admitted to the ICU. Strikingly,
their median basal QTc interval is quite long, about 440 ms, which is the upper limit for
healthy population; something similar was observed in other works with a basal median
QTc of 455 ms13,14. This fact suggests the presence of concomitant factors predisposing
this extreme QTc interval prolongation response.14 Our data suggest a modest QTc
interval prolongation, with just one case, in the absence of LBBB or ventricular paced
QRS, greater than 500 ms.
There may be several reasons for this different observation. First of all, ours is a
homogenous cohort of patients excluding severely ill patients in needing of mechanical
ventilation nor central nervous system depressants drugs; basal QTc in our serie is
similar to the one observed in general population15. Previous studies with extremely
prolonged basal QT intervals may not reflect the patient’s real-world baseline
repolarization status. This data have been replicated recently by the group from Yale16,
that describe a significantly prolonged QTc interval after treatment among patients
admitted to ICU after reviewing more than two thousands ECGs of patients with
COVID-19; on the other hand, previous studies focus mostly on American population1215

, with lack of large series in other regions. A single European work showed a

significantly prolonged QT interval in more than 20 % of the sample17, but in this case
patients were treated with chloroquine, which is known to affect QT interval in a greater
degree than HCQ. In fact, chloroquine has even been tested in a randomized clinical
trial for patients with COVID-19, showing significant QT interval prolongation,
although in higher doses than the conventional used18. Another European cohort in a

very limited sample of patients, most of them admitted to the ICU and intubated,
showed a significant proportion of patients with QTc interval greater than 500 ms19.
These data differ with ours, although basal population and treatment approach is
different too. A recent multicentric registry has shown an increased risk of arrhythmic
risk in patients taking antimalarial +/- macrolide, but with no clear relation with an
underlying QT interval prolongation20.
It is well recognized that genetic background is the key point to develop QTc
interval prolongation and DI-TdP. Some genetic polymorphisms are common in
specific geographical areas and may predispose, under environmental circumstances
such as drugs or electrolyte disturbances, to prolong the QT interval. Particularly, some
polymorphisms in SCN5A are present in a high proportion of American population of
African-descent, such as p.Ser1103Tyr; this variant is absent in Europeans and has been
proven to increase the late/persistent sodium current, with a basal modest proarrhyhtmic
effect, but an enhanced risk of DI-TdP under clinical scenarios that reduce the
repolarization reserve such as hypoxia, acidosis or adverse clinical status with advanced
age,10,21-27. This is something we have also observed in our serie, as advanced age was
an independent predictor of QT interval prolongation. However, in the absence of a
proarrhythmic genetic variant, these unfavourable conditions seem to be not enough to
damage the repolarization reserve and are not able to create the perfect substrate for the
appearance of ventricular arrhythmias and SCD. This fact might be contributing to the
observed difference between our serie and the ones by the Americans.
Taking our data into consideration, our hypothesis to explain the higher rate of
out of hospital cardiac arrests described by some groups11 does not support the DI-TdP
etiology. Recent studies have shown a worrisome decline in the number of patients
treated with primary coronary intervention for acute coronary syndrome during the

pandemia28,29. Fear of patients to be admitted to health centers as well as the strict
public health laws may have contributed to this phenomenon, in a higher grade than the
sporadic cases of DI-TdP in patients with COVID-19.

CONCLUSIONS
Ambulatory and not critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated with
hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and/or antiretrovirals develop a significant, but not
relevant, QT interval prolongation. Advanced age, prolonged baseline QTc and low
basal potassium levels are independent markers for this prolongation. Although caution
is needed to identify basal risk predictors, these data are reassuring for this specific
population

LIMITATIONS
First, due to the centre’s treatment protocol all patients received the medication and a
control group of untreated positive COVID-19 patients was not available. Second, the
absence of baseline ECG in some patients and limited follow-up may underestimate the
real incidence of high risk QTc prolongation.. Finally, considering the daily update on
the disease, we may have not reflected on some relevant clinical variables that could
have confounded clinical conclusions.

Figure Legends

Figure 1. Distribution of patients according to the QTc interval during treatment,
at 10 ms intervals. Only 2.9% (n=6) of patients presented a QTc of more than 480ms.
Among the 4 patients presenting a QTc interval of ≥500 ms, 3 showed a wide QRS due
to intraventricular conduction defects (left bundle branch block or right bundle branch
block)

Figure 2. Representation of QTc interval of relevant variables associated with the
presence of a QTc> 460 ms (cardiac disease, age, hypertension and the previous
treatment with antidepressants).

Figure 3. Panel A. Representation of QTc interval at baseline (at treatment
initiation) and at follow-up (at least 48h on treatment). The median of the baseline
QTc was 416 (404-433) ms; after treatment QTc was prolonged to 423 (405-438) ms.
Panel B. Distribution of patients according to the percentage increase of the QT
interval with respect to the basal. The vast majority of patients presented a mild (09.9%) raise in QTc during treatment.

SUMMARY BOX
What is already known on this topic
-

-

-

The absence of evidence-based treatment during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led
to the worldwide use of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and
antiretrovirals on an empirical basis.
Recent studies have warned of the risk of QT prolongation-related arrhythmic
adverse events in COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and
azithromycin, usually in severe or critical situations.
This evidence stems from observational studies comprising patients usually in
critical condition with an increased intrinsic risk of major arrhythmic events.

What is new and what are the clinical implications?
-

-

-

For the first time, we describe the arrhythmogenic impact of hydroxychloroquine
plus azithromycin in a cohort of non-severe ill patients, including outpatient
management.
Patients presenting COVID-19 infection with mild to moderate affection are not at
risk of severe cardiac rhythm disturbances due to combined hydroxychloroquine and
azithromycin treatment
Patients with advanced age, prolonged baseline QTc or low basal potassium levels
are at higher risk of QT interval prolongation, and treatment should be administered
with caution
