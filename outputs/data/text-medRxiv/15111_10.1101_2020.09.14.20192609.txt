ABSTRACT
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to over 820,000 deaths for almost 24 million confirmed cases
worldwide, as of August 27th, 2020, per WHO report. Risk factors include pre-existing conditions
such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer. There are currently no
effective treatments. Our objective was to complete a meta-analysis to identify comorbidityassociated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), potentially conferring increased
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a computational approach.
Results
SNP datasets were downloaded from publicly available GWAS catalog for 141 of 258 candidate
COVID-19 comorbidities. Gene-level SNP analysis was performed to identify significant
pathways by using MAGMA program. SNP annotation program was used to analyze MAGMAidentified genes. COVID-19 comorbidities from six disease categories were found to have
significant associated pathways, which were validated by Q-Q plots (p<0.05). The top 250
human mRNA gene expressions for SNP-affected pathways, extracted from publicly accessible
gene expression profiles, were evaluated for significant pathways. Protein-protein interactions of
identified differentially expressed genes, visualized with STRING program, were significant
(p<0.05). Gene interaction networks were found to be relevant to SARS and influenza
pathogenesis.
Conclusion
Pathways potentially affected by or affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified in underlying
medical conditions likely to confer susceptibility and/or severity to COVID-19. Our findings have
implications in COVID-19 treatment development.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 pandemic became prominent in Wuhan, China in December of 2019 [1]. As of
August 27th, 2020, there have been over 24 million confirmed COVID-19 cases affecting over
200 countries [2]. This staggering number of cases includes more than 820,000 deaths, with
the U.S. representing roughly one fourth of cases and deaths. WHO estimated the mortality rate
of COVID-19 to be 3.4% in March 2020, which is significantly higher than reported average
mortality rate of 0.1% for influenza [2].

COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, SARS-CoV-2.
This highly pathogenic coronavirus can cause severe respiratory illness and is highly
contagious. The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 can last up to 14 days with a median range
of 4 to 5 days from exposure to onset of symptoms [3]. Transmission of the infection is due to
inhalation of droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces. Symptoms include but are not
limited to fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and body aches [4]. Current treatment for
severe SARS-CoV-2 illness involves the management of complications associated with the
disease and supportive care [1]. There is currently no treatment proven to be sufficiently
effective for COVID-19 patients, although many drugs are being evaluated for effectiveness in
reducing disease progression, severity, or mortality [5].

Multiple studies have shown that comorbidities influence severity, quality of life, or 1-year
mortality, or altogether, in patients subject to viral infections [6, 7]. Risk factors for severity of
SARS-CoV-2 infection include age 65 or above, and/or having a pre-existing condition [8, 9].
Thus, patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney dysfunction, obesity,
and pulmonary diseases may have worse clinical outcomes when infected with SARS-CoV-2
[10].

Understanding pathways which could determine COVID-19 degree of susceptibility and severity
is critical for drug development. Alternative drug combinations might act in synergy to
complement future vaccination strategies, because no vaccination provides absolute protection
[11]. Indeed, protection from vaccination against viral diseases may range from 9 to 90% and up
to 60% of people vaccinated against influenza, for example, still fall ill due to the virus [12, 13].
In addition, vaccination is not systematically mandatory across countries.

Computational approaches may be utilized to identify candidate target molecules for the
development of tailored drug treatments [14-16]. Insofar, drug targets can be predicted based
on analysis of gene expression or genetic polymorphism profiles accessible through publicly
available databases such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [17, 18]. Computational tools
may (i) help elucidate or compare the mechanism(s) of action of drugs, (ii) assist in identification
and characterization of interactions between a drug and its target, and (iii) provide a better
understanding of mechanistic cellular reactions occurring at the molecular level in a drug
response [19].

Computational approaches may also serve to investigate viral susceptibility and contribute to
the development of vaccines [20-22]. For instance, machine learning has been used in the
development of viral vaccines (e.g., influenza) and in the investigation of genetic adaptation of
the virus to the host [23]. Indeed, the genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 will likely impact vaccine
development in future outbreaks. Additionally, an appropriate computational model that
accounts for the complexities of molecular interactions in COVID-19 patients affected by
comorbidities, would allow for a predictive and better assessment of viral mechanisms and
patients’ response to drug or vaccine treatment.

The aim of this study was to complete a meta-analysis to identify genes associated with
comorbidities/underlying medical conditions, potentially conferring increased susceptibility to
SARS-CoV-2 infection or leading to the manifestation of more severe viral symptoms. To this
end, we conducted a generalized gene set analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of a comprehensive list of possible
comorbidities using Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA)[24]. This analysis
was complemented with (i) the investigation of predicted effects from the significant SNPs
identified by MAGMA and (ii) the determination of differential human gene expression, most
likely relevant to the pathogenesis of the viral respiratory illnesses, severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and influenza.

GWAS catalog and gene mapping

From an initial list of 258 mostly chronic diseases (data not shown), possibly representing
comorbidities/underlying medical conditions associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 infectivity
or disease severity, SNP datasets from the online GWAS catalog database [25] were identified
using disease name, then downloaded and parsed. SNPs were mapped to genes using
MAGMAv1.07b with the publicly available gene reference file NCBI37.3.gene.loc
(https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/magma) [24].

Determination of multiple SNPs significance

The significance of SNPs (p-values) and derived sample sizes pertaining to genetic studies of
comorbidities were extracted from the GWAS catalog datasets to compute correlations between
neighboring genes and gene-level metrics via MAGMAv1.07b. To this end, the publicly available
1000 Genomes datasets (https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/magma) were used as reference files,
considering the ethnicities associated with the possible comorbidity tested (European, East
Asian, African, South American) [24]. To perform the gene set SNP analysis in MAGMAv1.07b,
the ‘ncol’ flag was set to the to the sample size column in the SNP p-value file where each
sample size corresponds to a p-value for the GWAS study completed. The flag for “multi=snpwise” model was used to perform the ‘mean’ and ‘top1’ model analysis.

Pathway analysis using Enrichment Map and MAGMAv1.07b programs

Reactome analysis

To conduct the pathway analysis, Reactome[26] human pathways were downloaded from
Enrichment Map program [27] using Entrez gene IDs [28-30]. Computationally derived Gene
Ontology (GO) biological terms and “No Data” were excluded. Based on the significant SNPs in
comorbidity gene sets per MAGMAv1.07b analysis, significant Reactome gene ontology defined
pathways were identified. The significant pathways also underwent a per-gene analysis with the
MAGMAv1.07b model flag set to ‘alpha=0.05’ [24].

Visualization of protein-protein interaction networks was completed using STRINGv11.0 [31]
program by testing different confidence levels to identify ontologies of biological significance for
the significant pathways associated with comorbidities.

Quality control

Possible comorbidity significant associated gene sets/pathways were checked for quality control
by generating Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plots using observed quantiles and residual Z-scores of
genes within the gene set, based on the MAGMAv1.07b publicly available Rv3.6.2 script
(posthoc_qc_107a.r) [32, 33].
Prediction of SNP effects

Ensembl’s Variant Effect Predictor program (VEP) [34] was used to analyze
MAGMAv1.07b annotation files for each gene set associated with comorbidities [35].
MAGMAv1.07b annotation files were converted into VEP format using a bash script. All
converted annotation files were uploaded into VEP online tool separately. VEP summary
statistics and analysis tables were downloaded for the comorbidities’ associated genes
and pathways found significant by MAGMAv1.07b. Corresponding tables were merged
via Pythonv3.8.2 and SNPs containing a Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) score of
0 and a Polymorphism Phenotyping2 (PolyPhen2) score of 1, were removed
(Supplemental Data File 1). Human Genome Organization (HUGO) gene symbols were
extracted from the table with remaining SIFT and PolyPhen2 scores. Duplicate HUGO
gene symbols were removed using Rv4.0.2. The most recently updated Affymetrix HGU133A/B Human Genome Files [36, 37] containing annotated gene symbols and Entrez
gene identifiers for all human genes were used to retrieve missing gene identification
[38]. These tabular (.csv) files were merged and loaded into Rv4.0.2. Entrez gene IDs
were matched to gene symbols from VEP analysis files to identify Affymetrix gene
symbols. Genes and their corresponding Entrez ID’s were then matched to significant
genes’ Entrez IDs found through combined MAGMAv1.07b - STRING analysis.

GEO2R [39] was used to test the top 250 human mRNA gene expressions for each comorbidity
based on available human data using NCBI GEO[39], by only including comorbidities that had
significant pathways identified by MAGMAv1.07b and VEP STRING analyses. Human mRNA
expression datasets comparing disease group to healthy controls since 2010 were searched. If
no datasets were available post-2010 the latest dataset was downloaded using characteristics
described for prior datasets. For diseases with no publicly available datasets comparing healthy
controls to disease type, the newest, most relevant dataset was used. Tissue types used for
analysis included: (i) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), (ii) cancer tissues, (iii)
adipose tissue, (iv) pulmonary tissue, (v) post-mortem brain tissue, (vi) cardiovascular tissue,
and (vii) blood stem cells.

For each comorbidity, human mRNA gene expression data corresponding to average log-fold
change (aLFC) were formatted for clustering of genes identified by MAGMAv1.07b and VEP
and subsequently matched to STRING protein-protein interactions. Gene weights were added
manually to account for duplicate genes in the dataset. Genes were mean centered and
normalized. Hierarchical clustering was completed using a similarity metric of Manhattan cityblock distance for genes and arrays with average linkage via Cluster3.0v1.59. Clusters were
visualized using heatmaps created using JavaTreeViewv1.1.6r4 [40]. Clustered groups of genes
for MAGMAv1.07b and VEP genes were run separately through GeneCodisv4.0 online tool [41]
for identification of possible biological processes or pathways involved in viral infection [42].

Gene involvement in influenza and/or SARS

Significant genes (n=119) were investigated to determine their roles in relation to influenza
and/or SARS respiratory viral infections. Genes were cross referenced using Pubmed [43]
literature searches, DisGeNETv6 [44], Influenza Research Database[45] and conventional
Google searches including HUGO gene symbol and either “influenza” or “SARS” [46, 47]. Risk
of bias was assessed according to “Cochrane’s Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions” [48]. Human tissue expression relevant to COVID-19 for genes with direct
involvement was validated using Ensembl Expression Atlas [49, 50]. Genes not generally
expressed in central nervous, cardiovascular, or pulmonary systems were removed from the
dataset. Visualization of protein-protein interaction network of genes directly involved with
influenza and SARS (caused by SARS-CoV-1) was completed using STRINGv11.0 using an
interaction score of 0.400 [31].

RESULTS

The overall computational analytical design and associated primary results are presented in
Figure 1.

MAGMA analysis of multiple SNPs associated with candidate COVID-19 comorbidities

To conduct generalized gene set analysis, we retrieved publicly available GWAS catalog
datasets for 141 out of 258 COVID-19 possible comorbidities/underlying medical
conditions. The 141 comorbidities were grouped into 8 categories by disease type based
on organ most affected (Table S1). Following our MAGMA analysis (Figure 1: Flowchart
section A), gene set and Reactome gene level analyses yielded 69 pathways
representing 119 significant genes (p<0.05). These pathways were significant for 22
COVID-19 comorbidities representing 6 disease categories, namely, cancer (n=9);
cardiovascular (n=4); neurologic/mental (n=3); respiratory (n=2); skin/musculoskeletal
(n=1); autoimmune/endocrine/metabolic (n=3). Reactome significant pathways and
genes obtained through MAGMAv1.07b gene-level analysis from Enrichment Map are
shown in Tables 1a and b.

Using STRINGv11.0 program with the highest confidence interaction score (CIS) of 0.9,
processing of the 119 genes yielded a protein-protein interaction network of 70 genes, which
was found to be highly significant based on hypergeometric test with Benjamini-Hochberg
correction (p=4.36x10-11) (Figure 2a). The top Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) pathway, identified by using STRINGv11.0, corresponded to Epstein-Barr virus
infection with a false discovery rate of 6.72x10-9.

Verification of significant pathways using Q-Q plots showed a high association between genes
and their relative gene ontology defined pathways, since all plots show a distribution of residual
z-scores deviating from the diagonal early on. There were no Q-Q plots with any ambiguous
feature. Significant genes had high levels of association with each pathway. Q-Q plots of more
than five genes, representing the pathways ontologies “post-translational protein modification”,

“translocation of ZAP-70 to immunological synapse”, “metabolism” and “cell cycle” and
associated possible COVID-19 comorbidities (including asthma), are described in
Figure S1.

VEP analysis of MAGMA-identified COVID-19 comorbidity-associated genes

Annotation files were converted for 134 of the 141 comorbidities with GWAS catalog datasets
available (Figure 1: Flowchart section B). Of 3704 HUGO gene symbols extracted from VEP,
2996 corresponding Entrez gene IDs were identified using Affymetrix human genome
annotation file. Of these gene IDs, 50 were matched with the 119 significant genes identified by
MAGMAv1.07b for the 22 comorbidities with significant pathways (Table 2). Of the 50 genes, all
were included in a protein-protein interaction network of 55 genes using a low CIS in
STRINGv11.0 (Figure 2b). The top KEGG pathway identified using STRINGv11.0 was HTLV-1
infection with a false discovery rate of 4.38x10-7 using hypergeometric test with BenjaminiHochberg correction.

Transcriptional gene expression analysis of MAGMA- and VEP-identified genes

GEO human mRNA expression datasets were retrieved for 19 of 22 comorbidities. A description
of GEO datasets is presented in Table S2. Using 119 MAGMAv1.07b identified genes (Figure
1: Flowchart section A), JavaTreeViewv1.1.6r4 clustered 4 of 9 cancer types in the heatmap
(partial view in Figure 3a, full heatmap in Supplementary Image). Also, interstitial lung
disease, multiple sclerosis, asthma, obesity, and heart failure were clustered (Figure 3a). VEP
STRING matched genes (n=50) also clustered 4 of 9 cancer types and clustered interstitial lung
disease, multiple sclerosis, asthma, obesity, and heart failure together (Figure 3b). In both
heatmaps Nucleoporin 160 (NUP160), Nucleoporin 153 (NUP153), Fibroblast Growth Factor
Receptor 2 (FGFR2), and Karyopherin Subunit Beta 1 (KPNB1) showed lower aLFC expression
in 12, 10, 6, and 10 out of 19 comorbidities, respectively (Figures 3a and b). GeneCodisv4.0
was able to confirm the four above mentioned genes, as well as others to be involved in lung or
viral biological processes.

The 119 genes analyzed for gene expression were also investigated for their possible role in
influenza and SARS-Cov-1 infection, as these might be relevant to SARS-Cov-2 infection. We
identified three genes with a primary role in influenza infection: FGFR2, KPNB1 and NUP153

[51-54]. We also identified three genes KPNB1, Signal Transducer and Activator of
Transcription 3 (STAT3), and Interleukin 2 Receptor Subunit Alpha (IL2RA) shown to play a
significant role in SARS [55-57]. Genes identified as being possibly directly associated with
influenza and/or SARS are shown in Table S3. STRING protein-protein interaction network
yielded 38/46 (82.6%) genes involved in influenza and 15/17 (88.2%) genes involved in SARS,
using an interaction score of 0.4 (Figures 4a and b). No GWAS study was found for SARSCoV-1 infection to identify possible susceptibility genes within the 119 genes. Additionally, no
studies were found to be at high risk for bias (Table S4).

DISCUSSION

This is the first study conducting generalized gene set analysis on a broad spectrum of possible
COVID-19 comorbidities, with the prospect of identifying comorbidity-specific genes that could
impact infection by SARS-Cov-2.

Starting with a list of 258 diseases, our MAGMA pipeline was able to identify 69 significant
Reactome pathways with a total of 119 significant genes corresponding to 22 comorbidities that
might have implications in predicting the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1, Table 1,
Table S1). Of the 22 comorbidities, we were able to validate pathways associated with
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and pulmonary diseases. Cardiovascular diseases
identified included heart failure, atherosclerosis, Kawasaki’s disease, and hypertension.
Pulmonary diseases included asthma and interstitial lung disease. Cancer has been reported as
a possible risk factor for COVID-19 [9]. We were able to identify nine cancers with GWAS data
and significant associated pathways including acute myeloid leukemia, renal cell cancer, small
cell lung cancer, and lung cancer. Furthermore, the known COVID-19 comorbidities,
hypertension, obesity and diabetes had significant pathways and genes.

While Q-Q plots indicated validity of our findings, caution for interpretation of Q-Q plots must be
used as these plots are normally used for pathways containing many genes. To a certain
degree, these allow us to convey a certain level of confidence that there is a true association
between gene and pathway [33]. In our analysis, however, less genes identified allowed us to
narrow possible gene targets and pathways. Indeed, certain genes identified in our study may
have significant biological relevance to infection by SARS-COV-2. For instance, sialyl

transferase ST6 N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 3 (ST6GALNAC3) was
found significant in the post-translational protein modification pathway (Figure S1). Another
sialyl transferase, ST6GALNAC1, has been previously investigated as a drug target against
infection of smooth airways epithelial cells by influenza virus [58]. It remains, however, to be
determined whether ST6GALNAC3, generally expressed at high levels in renal cell cancer[59],
plays a significant role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Interestingly, aLFC gene expression of
ST6GALNAC3 was positive in our analysis for 8 of 19 comorbidities (including renal cell
cancer), namely, in tumor, pulmonary, brain, adipose tissues and PBMCs (Figure 3a&b).

STRINGv11.0 analysis produced significant enrichment for both MAGMAv1.07b genes and VEP
matched genes containing SNPs that had characteristics of deleterious effects (Table 2).
Therefore, we believe the interactions among genes from significant pathways from MAGMA
and matched VEP genes are likely not due to chance and that these genes are biologically
connected. Furthermore, STRINGv11.0 analyses identified top KEGG pathways including,
Epstein-Barr virus pathway (MAGMA genes), and HTLV-1 pathway (VEP matched genes).
STRING was able to cluster 70 genes into four functional groups among the 119 MAGMA
significant genes: cell regulation and immune response, cell transport and nervous tissue
function, protein homeostasis and gene expression, transcriptional regulation and RNAmediated silencing (Figure 2a). Additionally, NUP160, NUP153, and KPNB1 clustered tightly
together in the cell transport and nervous tissue function group.

STRINGv11.0 analysis of the 50 VEP matched genes with a lower confidence interval of 0.150
was required to obtain sufficient network connections for interpretation. Although network
analysis may be subjective and is dependent on established knowledge, it is important to note
that the enriched protein-protein interaction p-value was statistically significant. For the VEP
matched gene STRINGv11.0 analysis, there were four distinct biological groupings recognized
within the mapped network based on the closeness of protein interactions (Figure 2b). Those
groupings were (i) antigen specific immune response, (ii) cell division and molecule
formation/development, (iii) cell growth, survival, proliferation, motility, and morphology, (iv) and
voltage gated ion channel transmembrane proteins. Notably, one of the comorbidities with
significant associated pathways, breast cancer, contained SNPs affecting Solute Carrier Family
4 Member 7 (SLC4A7) and Solute Carrier Family 24 Member 3 (SLC24A3) genes. These genes
are involved with sodium, calcium, and potassium ion transport and play a role in the malignant
progression of breast cancer [60]. In addition, Euchromatic Histone Lysine Methyltransferase 2

(EHMT2) was mapped within close protein interactions. EHMT2 is involved with posttranslational histone modification and epigenetic transcriptional repression. The orthologous
gene (G9A) in drosophila is related to viral infection and susceptibility [61]. EHMT2 has been
associated with the asthma comorbidity [62]. These results could indicate that EHMT2
deregulation possibly confers susceptibility to COVID-19.

The heatmap of MAGMA and VEP matched STRINGv11.0 genes shows that in 6 out of 19
comorbidities (Figure 1: Flowchart section C), FGFR2 had low aLFC (Figure 3a and b).
Epithelial signaling by fibroblast growth factors is required for effective recovery from lung
injuries resulting from influenza infection [51]. Our analysis coincides with previous findings
linking induced inactivation of FGFR2 with increased mortality and influenza-induced lung injury
[51]. KPNB1 (Figure 2a), NUP153, and NUP160 (Figures 2a and 2b) clustered in our heatmap
analysis and were observed to have negative aLFC in majority (>50%) of possible comorbidities
(Figure 3a and b). Downregulation of these factors under the condition of a
comorbidity/underlying medical condition might impair cellular function in the presence of an
active replicating virus.

Indeed, it has been previously established that a lower concentration of KPNB1 (interacting with
NUP153, Figure 2a) in epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells results in diminished Signal
Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) nuclear translocation activity [55]. Such
regulation is critical for STAT1-activated genes to determine the level of anti-viral response and
disease severity in an infection by SARS-CoV-1 [55]. Furthermore, KPNB1 is involved in the
early stage of influenza virus replication via nuclear trafficking, by way of, nuclear import of viral
cDNA or viral/host proteins into the host chromosome [52, 53].

Based on previous studies, the interaction between NUP153 and KPNB1 has been investigated
in relation to nuclear transport [63]. The degradation of NUP153 in influenza virus A infected
cells, such as Madin-Darby canine kidney II and human lung epithelial cells, results in an
enlargement and widening of nuclear pores [54]. This disease process allows viral
ribonucleoprotein complexes to be exported from the nucleus to the plasma membrane[54].
Additionally, NUP160 has been shown to work in conjunction with NUP153 to mediate nuclear
import and export [64]. Therefore, degradation of one or both can prevent the import of signal
transducers and activators of transcription, reducing effectiveness of the anti-viral interferon

response [65]. Our results support the interactions between these genes and viral respiratory
diseases, such as influenza and SARS.

NUP153 showed negative aLFC of three cancer types (tumor tissues), three cardiovascular
diseases (PBMCs and cardiovascular tissue), two respiratory diseases (pulmonary tissues), and
two autoimmune/endocrine/metabolic diseases (PBMCs and adipose tissue). NUP160 showed
lower aLFC in four cancer types (tumor tissues), two cardiovascular disease (PBMCs and
cardiovascular tissues), two respiratory diseases (pulmonary tissues), two autoimmune
/endocrine/metabolic diseases (PBMCs and adipose tissue), one mental health disease (postmortem brain tissue), and one skin/musculoskeletal (PBMCs). KPNB1 showed low aLFC in four
cancer types (tumor tissues), two respiratory diseases (pulmonary tissues), two mental health
diseases (post-mortem brain tissue), one cardiovascular disease (PBMCs), and one
autoimmune/endocrine/metabolic disease (adipose tissue).

Moreover, FGFR2 showed lower aLFC in four cancer types (tumor tissue), one respiratory
disease (pulmonary tissues), and one cardiovascular disease (PBMCs) (Figure 3a and b).
Notably, the possible comorbidities, asthma and prostate cancer, were identified as having all
four genes (i.e., FGFR2, KPNB1, NUP153, and NUP160) downregulated. Three of the four
genes were downregulated in obesity (KPNB1, NUP153, NUP160), heart failure (FGFR2,
KPNB1, NUP153), and interstitial lung disease (KPNB1, NUP153, NUP160) (Figure 3a). Only
NUP153, and NUP160 were downregulated in hypertension and type 1 diabetes mellitus
(Figure 3a and b).

GeneCodis was able to identify FGFR2 as being involved in mesenchymal cell differentiation
involved in lung development while NUP153 and NUP160 are involved in viral replication
process and intracellular transport of viruses. STAT3 was identified as being involved in primary
miRNA binding and viral process and has been observed to be downregulated in SARS-CoV-1
infected Vero E6 kidney epithelial cells extracted from an African green monkey [56].
Additionally, IL2RA has been recently identified as significantly upregulated in the plasma of
patients with severe COVID-19 [57] (Figures 2a and 2b). In our analysis, GeneCodis also
identified Transporter 2, ATP binding Cassette Subfamily B Member (TAP2), Major
Histocompatibility Complex, Class II, DR Beta 1 (HLA-DRB1), and Major Histocompatibility
Complex, Class II, DQ Beta 1 (HLA-DQB1) as being involved in Epstein-Barr virus infection.

Further research is needed to confirm these genes (or associated regulations) as possible drug
targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Limitations

While there is no shortage of publicly available data, not all diseases have the same level of
dedicated research. Therefore, not all possible comorbidities had publicly available SNP
datasets from GWAS catalog or human mRNA gene expression datasets from NCBI’s GEO
datasets database. This resulted in a large decrease from 258 possible comorbidities to 141.
Additionally, we were only able to use 19 of 22 significant comorbidities for GEO2R analysis and
heatmap visualization. Another caveat is that GEO2R mRNA expression datasets have been
generated through different independent studies using different genomic platforms and analysis
pipelines, so that optimal normalization of raw data cannot be implemented. Little is still known
about COVID-19 pathogenesis, although research on the matter has increased greatly since the
beginning of the pandemic.

Conclusions

Significant pathways were identified associated with comorbidities/underlying medical conditions
conferring susceptibility and/or severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which have been reported in
conjunction with decreased clinical outcomes. Our findings may have implications in
development of COVID-19 therapies.

Figure 1. Computational analytical design for determination of genes/pathways associated with
comorbidities, possibly contributing to COVID-19 severity/infectivity

Legend.

Flowchart section A.
A list of candidate comorbidities (n=258) possibly associated with increased severity/infectivity
of COVID-19 were curated. SNPs associated with comorbidities with available GWAS
catalogdata (n=141) were analyzed. Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA)
was performed. SNPs were annotated to genes using NCBI gene reference file
(NCBI37.3.gene.loc). In MAGMAv1.07b, gene set/pathway analysis was performed for which
each SNP that was identified, using the “multi-mean=snp-wise” model-generated results, taking
into account ethnicities associated with a possible comorbidity. Gene-level analysis was
completed using Reactome pathways retrieved from Enrichment Map program. STRINGv11.0
protein-protein interaction program was used to visualize the network of 119 significant genes.
Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots in Rv3.4.2 for 69 significant pathways were used for quality
control. NCBI-gene expression omnibus (GEO) human mRNA differential expression datasets
were downloaded via GEO2R for each comorbidity with associated genes/ pathways (n=19 of
22). Human mRNA expression was visualized with a heatmap of the 119 significant genes using
Cluster3.0v1.59 and JavaTreeViewv1.1.6r4. Tissue expression relevance to SARS and
influenza was determined using DisGeNETv6 and Ensembl Expression Atlas databases.

Flowchart section B.
MAGMAv1.07b annotation files were converted for Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)
format (n=134 of the 141 GWAS datasets). Gene symbols (n=3704) were extracted for VEP
analysis from 22 significant comorbidity-associated genes/pathways per MAGMAv1.07b
analysis. Entrez gene IDs (n=2996) were matched to gene symbols using Affymetrix gene
symbols annotation files (HG-U133A/B Human Genome Files). STRINGv1.0 protein-protein
interaction program was used to visualize the network (n=50 genes).

Flowchart section C.
NCBI-Gene expression omnibus (GEO) human mRNA differential expression datasets were
downloaded via GEO2R for each of the 22 comorbidities with associated genes/pathways (n=19
of 22). VEP genes were matched to network genes and formatted for Cluster3.0v1.59. Human
mRNA expression was visualized with a heatmap using average log-fold changes (aLFC) in
JavaTreeViewv1.1.6r4 (i.e., 50 VEP identified genes matched to 119 MAGMA identified genes).

a. Significant genes were identified via MAGMAv1.07b gene-level analysis
(https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/magma) using Reactome human pathways (https://reactome.org)
obtained from Enrichment Map (http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap) for 22 COVID-19
possible comorbidities with 119 significant genes. In STRINGv11.0 program, the confidence
interaction score (CIS) was set to the maximum of 0.9, resulting in a network of 70 connected
genes. Clustering by biological functions is represented by outlines. Green (…): cell regulation
and immune response. Red (__): cell transport and nervous tissue function. Blue (--): protein
homeostasis and gene expression. Orange (-..-): transcriptional regulation and RNA-mediated
silencing.

b. Significant genes (n=50) were identified for 22 COVID-19 possible comorbidities in both VEP
SNP and MAGMAv1.07b gene-level analyses. CIS was set to low value of 0.150, which resulted
in integration of all 50 genes in a network of 55 genes. Clustering by biological functions is
outlined. Red (__): antigen specific immune response. Blue (--): cell division and molecule
formation/development. Green (--.--): cell growth, survival, proliferation, motility, and
morphology. Purple (…): voltage gated ion channel transmembrane proteins.

Note: Three gene symbols had other synonymous gene symbols (HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DRB5,
HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQA2, PIK3R2 and IFI30), which were also entered into STRINGv11.0
program for verification.

b. Heatmap of VEP matched genes

Legend.

Heatmap from GEO2R human gene expression datasets using average log-fold changes
(aLFC) from (a) 119 significant genes (p<0.05) identified via MAGMAv1.07b and (b) 50 genes
matched to MAGMAv1.07b 120 significant genes from Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)
with 19 of 22 significant comorbidities identified via MAGMAv1.07b as arrays (a, b).

Genes were filtered by removing those with less than 60% values present, mean centered and
normalized. Hierarchical clustering was completed using weights for duplicate/synonymous
genes with a similarity metric of city-block (Manhattan) distance for genes and arrays with
average linkage through Cluster3.0v1.59 software. Heatmaps were created using
JavaTreeViewv1.1.6r4. Yellow depicts positive aLFC, blue depicts negative aLFC, black depicts
missing data and values of zero.

STRING protein-protein interactions of MAGMAv1.07b identified genes with direct involvement with (a)
influenza (n=46) and/ or (b) SARS (n=17) are shown. Level of stringency in STRINGv11.0 program was
set to a medium confidence interaction score (CIS) of 0.4 in both influenza and SARS related molecular
networks (a, b), resulting in a cluster of 38/46 (82.6%) and 15/17 (88.2%) genes, respectively.
