Summary

49
50

Understanding humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection will play a critical role in the

51

development of vaccines and antibody-based interventions. We report systemic and mucosal antibody

52

responses in convalescent individuals who experienced varying disease severity. Robust antibody

53

responses to diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens and evidence of elevated responses to endemic CoV were

54

observed among convalescent donors. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG responses were often negatively

55

correlated, particularly in mucosal samples, suggesting subject-intrinsic biases in isotype switching.

56

Assessment of antibody-mediated effector functions revealed an inverse correlation between systemic

57

and mucosal neutralization activity and site-dependent differences in the isotype of neutralizing

58

antibodies. Serum neutralization correlated with systemic anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM response

59

magnitude, while mucosal neutralization was associated with nasal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA. These

60

findings begin to map how diverse Ab characteristics relate to Ab functions and outcomes of infection,

61

informing public health assessment strategies and vaccine development efforts.

Introduction:

67

Since its emergence in late 2019 in China’s Hubei province, SARS-CoV-2, the human coronavirus

68

(CoV) causing COVID-19, has spread rapidly. Formal designation as a pandemic followed in March of 2020,

69

making understanding the health implications of infection and the development of effective interventions

70

a global priority. To this end, studies of endemic and other pathogenic CoV strains and evaluation of

71

humoral immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans have contributed to our

72

understanding of how antibodies (Abs) might provide protection from infection or severe disease, or

73

alternatively, contribute to disease pathology.

74

Due to the critical role of the spike (S) protein in viral entry, Abs targeting S, particularly in the

75

receptor binding domain (RBD), have been shown to neutralize the infectivity of CoVs (Chan et al., 2009;

76

Sui et al., 2004; ter Meulen et al., 2006; Traggiai et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2007) including SARS-CoV-2 (Chen

77

et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020). Studies of monoclonal Abs isolated from SARS-CoV-2-

78

infected individuals have shown potent anti-viral effects in vitro and protection from viral challenge in

79

mouse and nonhuman primate models (Cao et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020; Imai et al., 2020; Ju et al.,

80

2020; Pinto et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Salazar et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Wec et al., 2020; Wu et

81

al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020). Similarly, polyclonal Ab responses observed in convalescent and vaccinated

82

macaques have demonstrated promising protection profiles in challenge experiments (Chandrashekar et

83

al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). Collectively, these studies establish firm proof of principle for Ab-mediated

84

protection, motivating passive transfer of polyclonal serum Abs from recovered individuals as a clinical

85

intervention (Duan et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).

86

These efforts are challenged by the diversity of serum responses observed among convalescent donors

87

(Klein et al., 2020), and variability in the symptoms and sequelae of treated individuals (Guan et al., 2020).

88

Moreover, some CoV-specific Abs have been reported to contribute to disease pathology: while the

89

mechanism whereby SARS-CoV-2 sometimes triggers cytokine storm remain to be fully elucidated, Ab-

90

Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of infection or disease has been implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-

91

CoV-2 and other CoV (Cong et al., 2018; Hoeppel et al., 2020; Jaume et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2019; Vennema

92

et al., 1990; Yang et al., 2005; Yip et al., 2014).

93

Other challenging aspects of understanding humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 are that the highest

94

Ab titers and most potent neutralizing Ab responses have been observed in individuals with severe

95

infection (Klein et al., 2020; Long et al., 2020b), while infected subjects with mild symptoms may not

96

seroconvert (Gallais et al.; Le Bert et al., 2020; Sekine et al., 2020). Further, neutralizing Ab responses have

97

been observed to wane quickly (Long et al., 2020b; Seow et al.), suggesting the full spectrum of anti-viral

98

functions of Abs and T cells may be needed to contribute to protection from infection or disease. As a

99

result, there is concern that neither vaccines nor prior infection will be highly effective, that any protective

100

effects may have limited durability, and that the most vulnerable individuals, such as the

101

immunocompromised, elderly, and those with co-morbidities, may have an inadequate level of

102

protection. Cumulatively, many questions remain about the features and functions of systemic and

103

mucosal SARS-CoV-2-reactive Abs present after infection and how they may contribute to viral clearance

104

or inflammatory pathology.

105

To characterize the systemic and mucosal humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and better

106

understand the dynamic between Ab features and functions within each compartment, we turned to

107

systems serology (Pittala et al., 2019). This technique utilizes high-throughput, multidimensional

108

biophysical profiling of Ab response features, cell-based assays of Ab functions, and machine learning as

109

a means to discover mechanistically meaningful signatures of Ab-mediated protection and activity beyond

110

response magnitude (Barouch et al., 2015). We assessed antigen binding, CoV-specific Ab isotypes and

111

subclasses, and binding to FcγR and FcαR. These biophysical Ab response features were complemented

112

by functional analysis of neutralization and Ab-mediated effector functions with the goal of defining the

113

sites and characteristics of functionally potent humoral immune responses.

Results:

116

Systemic and Mucosal SARS CoV-2 Specific Ab Response Features

117

Serum, nasal wash, and stool samples were collected approximately one month (range: 19-67

118

days, mean: 40 days) after initial clinical presentation from 20 subjects (age range: 18-77, mean: 53 years)

119

who tested positive for SARS CoV-2 by qPCR, and from 15 SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects (age range: 22-66,

120

mean: 40 years). Ab responses to SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated using an Fc array (Brown et al., 2017; Brown

121

et al., 2018) to characterize isotypes, subclasses, and Fc Receptor (FcR) binding across Abs specific to a

122

panel of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This panel included spike protein in trimeric, subdomain (i.e. S1, S2), and

123

receptor binding domain (RBD) forms, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and the fusion peptide. S proteins from

124

seven other endemic CoV strains, those associated with prior outbreaks (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS), and a

125

closely related bat coronavirus, WIV1 (77.1% S amino acid identity) (Uddin et al., 2020), plus two non-CoV

126

control antigens (influenza HA and herpes simplex virus gE), were also evaluated. Our results demonstrate

127

SARS-CoV-2-specific Ab responses in COVID-19 convalescent but not naïve donor sera and nasal wash (Fig.

128

1A). Convalescent donor samples showed strong cross-reactive responses to the closely related bat CoV,

129

WIV1. Elevated levels of OC43 (29.7% S amino acid identity) S-specific IgG and IgA Abs were also observed

130

(unpaired two-tailed t-test with Welch’s correction, p < 0.0001, p = 0.011 respectively). This apparent

131

boosting of responses to endemic CoV was observed more broadly among IgG1 and IgG3 subclass

132

responses (Supplemental Fig. 1). Ab responses in serum and nasal wash samples were further examined

133

by measuring levels of other Ab isotypes, subclasses, and by defining binding to diverse FcRs (Fig. 1B,

134

Supplemental Fig. 2-6). SARS CoV-2-specific IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgA, IgM, and Abs able to ligate FcRs (FcaR,

135

FcgR) were observed among samples from convalescent donors but not naïve subjects. In contrast to the

136

robust responses apparent in serum and nasal samples, limited SARS CoV-2 specific Ig was detected in

137

stool samples (Supplemental Figure 7), though like serum and nasal samples, responses toward OC43

138

appeared elevated in a fraction of convalescent donors. Systematic analysis of the magnitude and

139

statistical confidence of differences in Ab present in convalescent versus naïve donors indicated elevated

140

IgG, IgA, and IgM responses across diverse SARS CoV-2 antigen types as well as a number of endemic and

141

related beta-CoV (Supplemental Figure 8).

142

To understand how aspects of the humoral response relate to each other, hierarchical clustering

143

was performed on Ab features to define similarities among subjects and features (Supplemental Figures

144

9-10). When focusing on those features that were significantly increased among convalescent donors

145

(unpaired two-tailed t-test with Welch’s correction, p < 0.05), elevated IgG responses were observed in

146

both serum and nasal samples in convalescent donors who had experienced severe disease (Fig. 2). In

147

contrast, elevated nasal IgA responses were apparent among donors with mild or moderate disease.

148

When correlations between Ab types and specificities elicited among convalescent donors were plotted

149

for serum and nasal samples, clear patterns emerged suggesting biases between IgA and IgG responses.

150

For example, in serum, IgG1, IgG3 and FcgR-binding Ab responses were well correlated with each other

151

across diverse specificities, as were IgA, IgA1, and IgA2 and FcaR-binding Abs (Fig. 3A). Correlations

152

between these isotypes were more modest, though overall in serum, many response features were

153

positively correlated with each other. In contrast, nasal responses showed clear evidence of a bias to favor

154

either IgG or IgA, as striking inverse correlations were observed between these isotypes across diverse

155

antigen specificities (Fig. 3B).

156

Because mucosal and systemic responses can exhibit remarkable divergence (Wright et al., 2016),

157

we determined correlations in the humoral immune response between these anatomical sites using sera

158

and nasal samples from convalescent donors (Fig. 4A). IgG and IgA responses in serum were directly

159

correlated with IgG and IgA responses, respectively, in nasal wash samples. However, no or inverse

160

relationships were observed between the serum IgG and nasal IgA; between serum IgA and nasal IgG; or

161

between different isotypes at different anatomic sites, as shown for a representative S antigen (Fig. 4B).

162
163

Neutralization activity of systemic and mucosal Ab

164

Given evidence of robust humoral responses in systemic and mucosal samples, we next sought to

165

determine neutralization potency in both serum and nasal wash samples using a luciferase-based SARS-

166

CoV-2 pseudovirus assay (Letko et al., 2020). Consistent with other studies (Klein et al., 2020), elevated

167

serum neutralization activity was observed for subjects who experienced severe, as compared to non-

168

severe, disease (unpaired two-tailed t-test with Welch’s correction, p = 0.034) (Fig. 5a). In contrast to

169

observations in serum, nasal samples from subjects with severe disease showed little to no viral

170

neutralization, whereas subjects with elevated mucosal neutralization activity tended to have

171

experienced mild or moderate symptoms (Fig. 5b). Indeed, nasal and serum neutralization activities

172

exhibited an inverse relationship (Fig. 5c). This observation further suggests the potential importance of

173

the observed distinctions in Ab isotypes between mucosal and systemic Ab responses.

174
175

Effector functions of systemic and mucosal Ab

176

Beyond neutralization, however, little is known about the antiviral functions of systemic and

177

mucosal Abs in COVID-19 convalescent donors. We sought to further characterize the antiviral activities

178

of Abs in serum and nasal samples by evaluating their effector functions against CoV-2 RBD, including Ab-

179

mediated phagocytosis, NK cell receptor ligation and complement activation. Our results demonstrate

180

that serum from most convalescent subjects readily promoted phagocytosis mediated by monocyte

181

(ADCP) and neutrophil (ADNP) effector cells (Fig 5a). While nasal wash samples were far less capable of

182

driving functional activity, a number of subjects exhibited nasal Ab responses able to elicit phagocytosis

183

in monocytes (Fig. 5b). Serum from these subjects also tended to generate a strong phagocytic response

184

(Fig 5c). Across phagocytosis, NK cell FcgR3a receptor ligation (ADCC), and complement cascade protein

185

C3b deposition (ADCD), a pattern of elevated Ab effector function emerged among subjects who

186

experienced moderate or severe disease; those who experienced mild disease generated little activity.

187

In contrast to serum, but consistent with the lower relative levels of IgG Abs present in nasal wash

188

samples, limited nasal ADNP, ADCC, and ADCD activity was observed (Fig. 5b). Comparison of serum and

189

nasal effector functions showed positive correlation for ADCP activity, consistent with the observation

190

that subjects with severe disease and high serum IgG also tended to exhibit high nasal IgG, and the known

191

dependence of monocyte phagocytosis on IgG-binding FcgR (Fig. 5c).

192
193

Ab features correlated with Ab functions

194

Next we established the characteristics of the Abs mediating each function by measuring the

195

degree and direction of correlation between RBD-specific Ab biophysical features and Ab functions in

196

serum (Fig. 6a). Consistent with their reliance on FcgR, ADCP, ADNP, and ADCC activities were most

197

strongly correlated with FcgR binding, but also with levels of IgG1 and IgG3, which ligate FcgR best among

198

human IgG subclasses. Interestingly, IgM positively correlated with both ADNP and neutralization activity,

199

though the mechanistic relevance of each observed association is unclear. While IgA responses were

200

robustly induced in serum, this isotype was generally more weakly associated with neutralization and

201

effector activities.

202

In nasal samples, however, neutralization activity was strongly correlated with the IgA response

203

(Fig. 6a. ADCP showed significant correlation with total RBD-specific IgG and FcgR-binding RBD-specific

204

Abs. Strong relationships with the other effector functions, which generally showed low or negligible

205

levels of activity, were generally not observed. Serum Ab functions were significantly correlated with one

206

another; however, this relationship was not seen in nasal wash samples (Fig. 6b, consistent with the low

207

activity observed for many functions, the differing isotypes associated with the robustly induced functions

208

(neutralization and ADCP), and the bias observed among subjects to favor either a nasal IgA or a nasal IgG

209

response. Representative scatterplots between individual features and functions show how these

210

activities and characteristics varied by subject according to disease severity (Fig. 6c)

211
212

Relationships between clinical characteristics and Ab responses

213

In order to probe how aspects of the immune response relate to subject characteristics, the

214

magnitude and statistical confidence of differences between subjects by age, sex, and disease severity

215

were evaluated (Supplemental Fig. 11). In exploratory analyses, comparisons were performed to

216

determine which CoV-2-specific features showed differences between individuals experiencing severe

217

versus mild or moderate disease in serum and nasal wash samples (unpaired two-sided test with Welch’s

218

correction p < 0.05). As has been observed in other cohorts (Klein et al., 2020), a number of IgG-related

219

responses were elevated in serum among individuals who had experienced severe disease (Supplemental

220

Fig. 12). This elevation was also evident in nasal samples (Fig. 7A). Critically, RBD-specific Ab binding to

221

FcaR was found to be significantly elevated in the nasal wash samples from subjects who had experienced

222

mild or moderate as opposed to severe disease (Fig. 7A), and a number of other IgA-related responses

223

exhibited differences near the arbitrary significance threshold (Supplemental Fig. 11). When examining

224

the relationships between these features among donors who recovered from mild, moderate, and severe

225

disease, IgG-related features typically showed a uniformly increasing magnitude with increasing disease

226

severity (Fig. 7B). In contrast, the IgA-associated feature defined by nasal RBD-specific Abs binding to FcaR

227

(Fig. 7C) and its correlated function neutralization (Fig. 7D) were lowest in subjects with either mild or

228

severe disease, and elevated among those who recovered from moderate illness.

229
230
231

Discussion:

232

While information on systemic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 continues to rapidly accrue,

233

questions remain about mucosal immune responses to the virus within the respiratory tract – the primary

234

site of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication (Wölfel et al., 2020) and where IgA is the dominant Ab isotype

235

(Chodirker and Tomasi, 1963; Conley and Delacroix, 1987; Tomasi et al., 1965). Prior work to delineate Ab

236

responses to human CoV (Callow, 1985) and from studies of CoV strains in animals (Loa et al., 2002;

237

Pearson et al., 2019; Saif, 1987), suggests that induction of mucosal Ab is a key component in reducing

238

virus shedding after infection and may mediate protective immunity following re-exposure. Moreover,

239

studies of mucosally-targeted SARS-CoV vaccines in animal models have identified virus-specific mucosal

240

IgA as playing a role in protection from subsequent challenge (Du et al., 2008; See et al., 2006).

241

Accordingly, strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease are likely to benefit from not only

242

robust systemic immunity, but also functional mucosal immunity to prevent infection at sites of virus entry

243

(Moreno-Fierros et al., 2020). Indeed, robust mucosal immunity may serve not only to protect the

244

individual, but also populations by reducing the level or duration of viral shedding.

245

We sought to characterize the humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 with an emphasis

246

on Ab features and functions observed at distinct anatomical sites. We examined the CoV-specific Ab

247

response across a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antigens, six other endemic human CoVs, and the putative

248

precursor bat CoV, WIV1 (Zeng et al., 2016). Intriguingly, Abs that bound to endemic CoV also appeared

249

to be boosted among SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors. While the early appearance of CoV-specific IgG in

250

a subset of patients (Long et al., 2020a; Zhao et al., 2020) is suggestive of a recall response, data presented

251

here cannot define whether these boosted Abs are cross-reactive across CoV, or represent a more general

252

boosting phenomenon. Consistent with the possibility that boosted Abs are cross-reactive, SARS-CoV-2 S-

253

reactive CD4 T cells, a prerequisite for class-switched Ab responses, have been detected in the majority

254

of COVID-19 patients, as well as in 34% of uninfected individuals, supporting the existence of shared

255

epitopes between S proteins of endemic CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 (Braun et al., 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020a;

256

Grifoni et al., 2020b). Additionally, immunofluorescence assays (Wölfel et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020) have

257

exhibited a similar phenomenon, whereas Abs specific to the control antigens from other mucosal

258

pathogens tested in this study were not elevated among convalescent donors. While many possibilities

259

exist, the observation that the aged are most prone to severe COVID-19 illness, combined with the fact

260

that the elderly have a decreased ability to generate de novo Abs (de Bourcy et al., 2017; Gibson et al.,

261

2009; Henry et al., 2019), raises the possibility that pre-existing immunological memory resulting in

262

induction of poorly neutralizing but cross-reactive Abs from prior exposure to circulating CoVs such as

263

OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63 (Ng et al., 2020) may be associated with severe COVID-19 illness (Tetro,

264

2020).

265

Both multiplexed Ab profiling and functional assays showed induction of a generally robust

266

humoral response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the majority of subjects, but an occasional lack of

267

seroconversion in the context of mild disease (Klein et al., 2020; Sekine et al., 2020). Indeed, the

268

magnitude of the humoral response in serum appeared to be closely tied to the clinical severity of

269

infection. Closer dissection of the humoral response revealed that it was primarily comprised of IgG1 and

270

IgG3 – subclasses that readily promote effector function via their Fc domains and which were, along with

271

FcgR-binding SARS-CoV-2-specific Abs, associated with diverse effector functions. These observations

272

suggest that SARS-CoV-2-specific Ab have the potential to contribute to protection against COVID-19

273

disease through the involvement of cells of the innate immune system and the complement system, and

274

not solely by neutralization. While much has been made of the potential for Ab responses to promote

275

infection or inflammation via interactions with FcR or via other mechanisms (Arvin et al., 2020; Eroshenko

276

et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016), it remains unclear whether the elevated Ab response magnitude is either

277

a cause or effect of increased disease severity (Huang et al., 2020).

278

Separate from the dichotomy of whether Abs serve a protective or pathogenic role, we observed

279

that the characteristics of the responses observed in serum and nasal samples tended to be highly distinct.

280

Not only did the Ab profile of the nasal wash samples from individual subjects tend to favor either IgG or

281

IgA to the exclusion of the other, there was an inverse correlation observed between the dominant nasal

282

isotype and the prevalence of that isotype in serum. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG in serum was associated with

283

neutralization activity, consistent with prior work showing that neutralizing serum Abs against SARS-CoV-

284

1 and SARS-CoV-2 are highly correlated with CoV-2-specific IgG (Cao et al., 2007; Klein et al., 2020). In

285

contrast, those subjects who mounted a relatively IgA-biased nasal response exhibited elevated nasal

286

wash neutralization activity, suggesting that the mechanistic contribution of mucosal IgA to neutralization

287

of virus at the portal of entry could be substantial. Neutralization by mucosal IgA could be relevant in vivo

288

in light of the observation that those subjects whose nasal specimens had the greatest neutralization

289

potency also tended to report experiencing only mild or moderate symptoms. It is important to note

290

however that the available cohort was not large enough to adequately power a robust examination of this

291

trend. Reduced SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses among subjects with mild disease also confound

292

the ability to identify potential correlates of protection among these convalescent donors. Further,

293

because of the many correlations, inverse and direct, observed between Ab types and activities in

294

different anatomical sites, depletion and other follow up studies will be needed to define the mechanistic

295

relevance of feature-function correlations and their potential to make causal contributions to modifying

296

disease severity. Nonetheless, taken together with prior studies of other CoV in humans and animals

297

(Callow, 1985; Du et al., 2008; Loa et al., 2002; Pearson et al., 2019; Saif, 1987; See et al., 2006), these

298

data raise the possibility that levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific mucosal IgA could serve as a useful immune

299

correlate for mitigated disease severity, protection from infection, as well as reduced likelihood of

300

transmission.

301

Chief among the limitations of this work is the small sample size, linked to low local disease

302

prevalence. Other limitations include reliance on self-reported disease severity, and cross-sectional

303

analysis of responses at a somewhat variable period after diagnosis and following varying degree and

304

duration of symptoms among subjects with varying co-morbidities. Additionally, as with most mucosal

305

sampling techniques, there was variability in the volume of nasal wash collected from each subject. This

306

variability appeared to be largely due to accidental ingestion of the fluid during collection and affected

307

volume to a greater degree than concentration. Experimental limitations include the use of lab-adapted

308

cell lines rather than autologous or primary cells for evaluating some Ab functions. Surrogate endpoints

309

of anti-viral activities, such as the substitution of FcgR3a activation and complement C3b deposition were

310

employed as alternatives to assessing infected cell death or viral lysis, and compromises were made in

311

antigenic fidelity by use of recombinant spike proteins. However, assays simplified in these ways may

312

represent approaches with a broad ability to be deployed in global efforts to understand responses to

313

infection and define protective immunity.

314

These compromises notwithstanding, these data have important implications for our

315

understanding of the protection afforded by vaccination or prior infection. When considering vaccine

316

development, an ideal candidate would not only protect the recipient from disease but would also prevent

317

them from serving as an asymptomatic vector, as can be the case in other vaccine-treatable diseases such

318

as polio and pertussis (Althouse and Scarpino, 2015; Holmgren and Czerkinsky, 2005; Warfel et al., 2014).

319

Polio is a particularly informative model in this respect as the mucosally administered form of the vaccine

320

is capable of providing sterilizing immunity – at the expense of a risk of reversion to virulence – while the

321

systemically administered form fails to induce mucosal immunity and thus serves primarily to protect the

322

recipient (Wright et al., 2016). Our current observation that natural infection elicits alternatively IgG or

323

IgA-biased responses, with IgG associated with serum neutralization potency but severe disease and IgA

324

associated with nasal neutralization activity and mild to moderate disease, suggests that this dichotomy

325

could exist for COVID-19 as well. While human correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 in humans

326

have yet to be defined, lessons from related CoV in animals and humans are consistent with the results of

327

this small natural infection history study; mucosal IgA is likely of substantial importance.

Methods:

331

Human subjects

332

A total of 35 individuals were studied, including 20 who had recovered from COVID-19 (age range:

333

18-77, mean: 53 yrs) and 15 naïve control subjects (age range: 22-66, mean: 40 yrs). Infection with SARS-

334

CoV-2 was confirmed in all COVID-19 patients by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-

335

reaction of a nasopharyngeal swab. Study subjects included both males (17) and females (18). Disease

336

severity among COVID-19 subjects ranged from mild (4) to moderate (12) and severe (4). Classification of

337

disease severity was based on self-reported symptoms for individuals with mild or moderate disease,

338

while a designation of severe disease was made on the basis of hospitalization for COVID-19. Serum, nasal

339

wash, and stool samples were collected from each donor approximately one month after symptom onset,

340

or one month from first positive PCR test in the case of asymptomatic (mild) disease (range: 19-67 days,

341

mean: 40 days).

342

Primary neutrophils used in functional assays were purified from deidentified blood samples from

343

healthy male and female donors over the age of 18 yrs. All research involving human subjects was

344

approved by the Dartmouth College and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center Committee for the

345

Protection of Human Subjects (Institutional Review Board) and written informed consent was obtained

346

from all participants.

347
348

Antigen and Fc Receptor expression and purification

349

Prefusion-stabilized, trimer-forming spike protomers (S-2P) of SARS-CoV-2, closely related and/or

350

epidemic strains (SARS-CoV-1, WIV1, and MERS), and endemic coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, and

351

HKU1), and the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 fused to a monomeric form of the human IgG4 Fc

352

region were transiently expressed in either Expi 293 or Freestyle 293-F cells, and purified via affinity

chromatography according to the manufacturers’ protocols (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Human FcgR

354

were expressed and purified as described previously (Boesch et al., 2014).

355
356

Fc array assay:

357

CoV and control antigens, including S trimers, S subdomains (i.e., S1 and S2), and other viral

358

proteins from SARS-CoV-2 as well as S and S subdomains from SARS CoV-1, MERS, HKU1, OC43, NL63,

359

229E, and WIV1 (Supplemental Table 2) and influenza HA and herpes simplex virus (HSV) gE proteins were

360

covalently coupled to Luminex Magplex magnetic microspheres using a two-step carbodiimide chemistry

361

as previously described (Brown et al., 2012). Biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide was captured on

362

neutravidin-coupled microspheres. Pooled polyclonal serum IgG (IVIG), CR3022, a SARS CoV-1-specific

363

monoclonal Ab that cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2 S (Yuan et al., 2020), and VRC01, an HIV-specific

364

monoclonal Ab, were used as controls to define the antigenicity profiles. The optimal dilution of serum

365

was determined in pilot experiments in which a subset of samples was titrated. Test concentrations for

366

serum ranged from 1:250 to 1:5000 and varied per detection reagent. Nasal wash and stool samples were

367

assayed at a 1:10 dilution. Isotypes and subclasses of antigen-specific Abs were detected using R-

368

phycoerthrin (PE) conjugated secondary Abs and by FcRs tetramers (Supplemental Table 3) as previously

369

described (Brown et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2018). A FlexMap 3D array reader detected the beads and

370

measured PE fluorescence used to calculate the Median Fluorescence Intensity (MFI).

371
372

Neutralization assay

373

Samples of serum and nasal wash from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and naïve donors were tested

374

in microneutralization assays using a VSV-SARS-CoV pseudovirus system (Letko et al., 2020). In brief,

375

samples were serially diluted 2-fold (1:50-1:3200 for serum; 1:4-1:256 for nasal wash) and incubated with

376

a standardized concentration of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus for 1 hr at 37°C followed by addition to duplicate

377

wells of 293T-ACE2-expressing target cells (Integral Molecular, Philadelphia PA) in a final volume of 100

378

µl per well. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 18-24 hrs, after which luciferase activity was measured using

379

the Bright-Glo system (Promega, Madison WI) in a Bio-Tek II plate reader. Results were quantified relative

380

to controls and data expressed as 60% neutralization titers.

384

Assays of Ab-dependent phagocytosis by monocytes (ADCP) and neutrophils (ADNP) were

385

performed essentially as described (Ackerman et al., 2011; Karsten et al., 2019; McAndrew et al., 2011).

386

Briefly, 1 µm yellow-green fluorescent microspheres (Thermo, F8813) were covalently conjugated with

387

recombinant RBD and incubated for 3 hrs with dilute serum or nasal wash specimens and either the

388

human monocytic THP-1 cell line (ATCC, TIB-202), or with freshly-isolated primary neutrophils. After

389

pelleting, washing, and fixing, phagocytic scores were quantified as the product of the percentage of cells

390

that phagocytosed one or more fluorescent beads and the median fluorescent intensity of this population

391

as measured by flow cytometry with a MACSQuant Analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec). ADCP assays were

392

performed in duplicate with high correspondence between results presented here and the replicate run.

393

ADNP assays were performed in biological replicate using neutrophils purified from two different healthy

394

donors for which results were averaged. A subset of neutrophils was stained with CD66b-APC (Biolegend

395

G10F5) and PI (Biotium 41007) to determine the purity and viability of the isolated cellular fraction.

396

CR3022 and VRC01 were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Wells containing no Ab were

397

used to define the level of Ab-independent phagocytosis.

398
399

CD16 reporter assay

400

The ADCC potential of the specimens was measured using a Jurkat Lucia NFAT cell line (Invivogen,

401

jktl-nfat-cd16), cultured according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, in which engagement of

402

FcγR3a (CD16) on the cell surface leads to the secretion of luciferase. One day prior to running the assay,

403

a high binding 96 well plate was coated with 1 µg/mL SARS-CoV-2 RBD at 4°C overnight. Plates were then

404

washed with PBS + 0.1% Tween20 and blocked at room temperature for 1 hr with PBS + 2.5% BSA. After

405

washing, dilute serum or nasal wash sample and 100,000 cells/well in growth medium lacking antibiotics

406

were cultured at 37°C for 24 hrs in a 200 µl volume. The following day, 25 µL of supernatant was drawn

407

from each well and transferred to an opaque, white 96 well plate, to which 75 µL of QuantiLuc substrate

408

was added and luminescence immediately read on a SpectraMax Paradigm plate reader (Molecular

409

Devices) using 1 s of integration time. The reported values are the mean of three kinetic reads taken at 0,

410

2.5, and 5 min. Negative control wells substituted assay medium for sample while 1x cell stimulation

411

cocktail (Thermo, 00-4970-93) plus an additional 2 μg/mL ionomycin were used to induce expression of

412

the transgene as a positive control.

415

Antibody-dependent Complement Deposition (ADCD) was quantified essentially as previously

416

described (Fischinger et al., 2019). In brief, serum and nasal samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30

417

min prior to a 2 hr incubation at a dilution of 1:20 at RT with multiplex assay microspheres. After washing,

418

each sample was incubated with Human Complement Serum (Sigma #S1764) at a concentration of 1:50

419

at RT with shaking for 1 hour. Samples were washed, sonicated, and incubated with murine anti-C3b

420

(Cedarlane #CL7636AP) at RT for 1 hr followed by anti-mouse IgG1-PE secondary Ab (Southern Biotech

421

#1070-09) at RT for 30 min. After a final wash and sonication, samples were resuspended in Luminex

422

Shealth Fluid and complement deposition was determined on a MAGPIX (Luminex Corp) instrument to

423

define the MFI. Assays performed without Ab and with heat-inactivated Human Complement Serum were

424

used as negative controls.

425
426

Data analysis and visualization

427

Basic analysis and visualization were performed using GraphPad Prism. Heatmaps, correlation plots, and

428

boxplots were made in R (supported by R packages pheatmap, corrplot, and ggplot2). Hierarchical

429

clustering was used to cluster and visualize data using the Manhattan and Euclidean metrics. Fc Array

430

features were filtered by elimination of measurements for which >25% of the samples exhibited signal

431

within 10 standard deviations (SD) of the technical blank. Fc Array features were log transformed, then

432

scaled and centered by their standard deviation from the mean (z-score). A student’s two-tailed t-test

433

with Welch’s correction with a cutoff of p= 0.05 was used to define features different between groups.

434

Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for the correlation matrices.

that exhibited statistically significant differences in responses between subjects with severe and nonsevere disease (unpaired two-sided t-test with Welch’s correction, p < 0.05). B-D. Representative
boxplots of nasal features by disease severity across donors who experienced mild, moderate, and
severe disease. B. IgG1 specific to S-2P as a representative Ab feature elevated among subjects with
severe disease. C-D. FcaR binding Abs specific to RBD (C), the sole Ab response elevated among subjects
with non-severe disease, but which like nasal neutralization activity (D) is elevated among individuals
who recovered from moderate disease as opposed to either mild or severe disease.
