Abstract
Background: SARS-CoV-2 quick testing and reporting are now considered relevant for the
containment of new pandemic waves. Antigen testing in self-collected saliva might be useful.
We compared the diagnostic performance of salivary and naso-pharyngeal swab (NPS) SARS-CoV2 antigen detection by a rapid chemiluminescent assay (CLEIA) and two different point-of-care
(POC) immunochromatographic assays, with that of molecular testing.
Methods. 234 patients were prospectively enrolled. Paired self-collected saliva (Salivette) and NPS
were obtained to perform rRT-PCR, chemiluminescent (Lumipulse G) and POC (NPS: Fujirebio and
Abbott; saliva: Fujirebio) for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection.
Results. The overall agreement between NPS and saliva rRT-PCR was 78.7%, reaching 91.7% at the
first week from symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2 CLEIA antigen was highly accurate in distinguishing
between positive and negative NPS (ROC-AUC=0.939, 95%CI:0.903-0.977), with 81.6% sensitivity
and 93.8% specificity. This assay on saliva had an overall good accuracy (ROC- AUC=0.805,
95%CI:0.740-0.870), reaching the optimal value within 7 days from symptom onset (Sensitivity:
72%; Specificity: 97%). POC antigen in saliva had a very limited sensitivity (13%), performing better
in NPS (Sensitivity: 48% and 66%; Specificity: 100% and 99% for Espline and Abbott respectively),
depending on viral loads.
Conclusions: Self-collected saliva is a valid alternative to NPS for SARS-CoV-2 detection not only
by molecular, but also by CLEIA antigen testing, for which the highest diagnostic accuracy was
achieved in the first week from symptom onset. Saliva is not suitable for POC, although the
accuracy of these tests appears satisfactory for NPS with high viral load.

Introduction
Saliva testing for SARS-CoV-2, one of the strategies for COVID-19 diagnosis and
monitoring, is advocated mainly for screening asymptomatic subjects in order to rapidly detect and
isolate infected individuals and their contacts, thus limiting viral spread and containing further waves
of the pandemic (1-6). Although the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in naso-pharyngeal
swabs (NPS) is considered the “gold standard” technique for identifying symptomatic or
asymptomatic individuals (7), it has limitations in both the analytical and the healthcare settings.
From the analytical viewpoint, it is widely agreed that the sensitivity of rRT-PCR of NPS ranges from
70 to 90% (5,8), reaching values around 50% after the first two weeks of disease (9,10). Therefore,
COVID-19 disease cannot be ruled out when a NPS result is negative, but the patient has clinical
symptoms, and biochemical data and radiological findings that evidence a clinical scenario typical of
the disease (11). In this context anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies should also be taken into account (12).
From the healthcare organizational viewpoint, NPS testing calls for the involvement of healthcare
workers and services for sample collection. This pre-requisite might be promptly met by the
healthcare system when the demand is low, but not necessarily when it is high, as occurs in a
pandemic. Any delay in testing puts individuals without a diagnosis at risk, consequently exposing
the community to viral contagion.
Saliva testing might not only have the advantage of relieving health care resources, but also
of reducing hazard exposure to healthcare workers during sampling; it might also limit the risk of
viral spread incurred when numerous individuals queue for a long time waiting for testing, since
saliva can be self-collected at home. However, none of these advantages support the use of saliva
testing if its results are not as reliable as those of NPS. When rRT-PCR is used for SARS-CoV-2
testing, the reliability of saliva testing is reportedly equal to, or even higher than, NPS (5,10,13,14),
although some studies report contradictory findings (i.e. saliva as less sensitive) (15). This
discrepancy might depend on the salivary viral load kinetic, the highest load occurring in the first
week of symptom onset, followed by a progressive decline during the course of the disease (3,9,14).

Moreover, the viral load estimated by the threshold cycle (Ct) has been found to be higher in saliva
than in NPS especially in pre-symptomatic individuals, thus supporting the view that these subjects
increase viral spread (16).
Saliva testing by rRT-PCR is reliable, but time consuming, calling for dedicated laboratory
equipment for nucleic acid extraction and amplification, and personnel trained in molecular
techniques (17). These requirements, which might not be fulfilled by all laboratories, compromise
the advantage of using the saliva sample. In front of a safe and rapid collection procedure, the overall
testing process remains long not only because molecular testing takes time, but also because
molecular laboratories might be limited in number, especially in low resource countries, thus
increasing the turnaround time due to sample transportation and processing. In order to speed up
testing while maximizing the number of tested individuals, the search for SARS-Co-2 antigens rather
than RNA, by immunometric techniques is now emerging, including point-of-care (POC) rapid
immunochromatographic assays based on lateral flow technology (18). The market now offers a
number of SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection immunometric assays, which are high throughput but
require laboratory instrumentation, and ultra-rapid POC devices suggested for use in medical cabinets
by general practitioners and nurses. Since they are simple to use, these devices are also considered
potentially employable in auto-testing. However, simplicity is not synonymous with accuracy. Assays
designed to identify SARS-CoV-2 antigens have been investigated using NPS samples with a
reported sensitivity ranging from 0 to 94% for rapid immunochromatographic assays (19), and from
85 to 100% (depending on the viral load) and a specificity above 99% for antigen levels measured by
automated chemiluminescent assay (20). No exhaustive data are present in the literature on antigen
detection using saliva, an approach that might maximize an effective and timely COVID-19
diagnosis, encompassing the advantages of a) saliva self-collection and b) rapid viral protein
detection, thus making wide-scale screening possible in many parts of the world.

The aim of this prospective study was to compare in saliva and NPS the diagnostic accuracy
of molecular testing with SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection by a rapid chemiluminescent assay and two
different point of care ultra-rapid immunochromatographic assays.
Materials and methods
Patients and samples
A total of 234 subjects were enrolled between 1 August and 30 November 2020. One hundred
thirty-eight (52 females, 86 males, mean age±SD: 56±17 years) were COVID-19 inpatients, and 96
(47 females, 49 males, mean age±SD: 42±15 years) were outpatients screened for suspected SARSCoV-2 (i.e. contact with a SARS-CoV-2 positive subject or with typical symptoms). After obtaining
giving fully informed consent in writing (Local Ethic Committee Nr. 27444), patients were asked to
collect a morning saliva sample (Salivette device, SARSTEDT AG & Co, Nümbrecht, Germany).
Saliva was self-collected by the Salivette device (SARSTEDT AG & Co, Nümbrecht,
Germany), the cotton swab being chewed for at least one minute to stimulate salivation. In order to
obtain clear saliva, the Salivette device was centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 minutes within 3 hours of
collection. An aliquot of saliva (200 μL) was used for rRT-PCR, and another aliquot (150 μL) for
chemiluminescence (CLEIA) SARS-CoV-2 antigen determination. A third saliva aliquot (about 100
μL) was used for SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing with the immunochromatographic ESPLINE rapid
test (Fujirebio, Tokjo, Japan) following the manufacturer’s instructions for this sample type.
After saliva sampling, trained nurses collected three NPS from each patient. One was
collected using the ∑-VCM (Medical Wire & Equipment, UK) and used for SARS-CoV-2 molecular
and CLEIA antigen testing. The second and third swabs were used for SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing
by the immunochromatographic ESPLINE rapid test and COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (ABBOTT,
Chicago, Illinois, USA) at the bedside, following the manufacturers’ instructions. The former test
requires 30 minutes while the latter 15 minutes for reading. A subset of 32 inpatients repeated saliva
collection and testing 7 days after enrollment and, among them, 23 repeated also NPS.
Clinical data on each inpatient were also retrieved from the hospital information system (HIS).

Repeatability and intermediate precision evaluation
Precision estimation was performed on CLEIA assays using three NPS and three saliva pools
made up of ten different samples each. Triplicate aliquot measurements were performed over three
consecutive days. For estimating precision we used analysis of variance following the CLSI EP15A3 protocol (CLSI. User Verification of Precision and Estimation of Bias; Approved Guideline—
Third Edition. CLSI EP15- A3. Wayne, PA: Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2014).
Repeatability and within-laboratory precision were in accordance with the repeatability and
intermediate precision conditions specified in the international vocabulary of metrology (VIM,
JCGM 100:2012) for precision estimation within a three-day period.
Laboratory testing
All molecular and CLEIA antigen testing in both saliva and NPS were performed in parallel
within 3 hours from collection. For molecular testing, saliva and swab samples were mixed (2:1, v:v)
with Nuclisens® easyMAG® Extraction buffer 1 immediately before extraction of RNA using an
automated platform (Magna Pure 96 Instrument, Roche Diagnostics, USA), and then used for Orf1ab,
N and S SARS-CoV-2 genes rRT-PCR, by means of the diagnostic system TaqPath COVID-19 RTPCR kit (Applied Biosystems, USA), performed by QuantStudio™ 5 Real-Time PCR Systems
(Applied Biosystems, USA). RNaseP was also separately analyzed by QuantStudio™ 5 RealTime
PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems, USA) as described elsewhere [21]. In the absence of RNaseP
target amplification, the analysis was considered invalid, and this criterion was used to decide on
repeat testing. The threshold cycle (Ct) of SARS-CoV-2 genes Orf1ab, N and S, and of RNaseP was
obtained after standardization of the rRT-PCR instrument’s software settings as follows: baseline
calculated in the cycle range 3 to 15; fixed threshold, 0.1. The Ct of each analysis was considered for
data comparison. In each analytical set, two negative and two positive controls were always run in
parallel with the subject’s samples. The positive controls (IQC) were RNA, obtained from positive
samples stored at −80 °C for a maximum of one week. Saliva and NPS samples were considered
positive when at least two of three targets had an amplification plot with a Ct value of < 40.

Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLEIA) was performed using an LUMIPULSE SARSCoV-2 Ag kit on a LUMIPULSE G1200 automated analyzer (Fujirebio, Tokjo, Japan), following the
manufacturer’s instructions. After the first result, available in 30 minutes, the diagnostic system
provides 120 results per hour. ESPLINE rapid test and COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (ABBOTT,
Chicago, Illinois, USA) were the two evaluated POC.
Statistical analysis of data
The statistical analysis of data was made with Stata software ver. 13.1 (Lakeway drive, TX,
US). Descriptive statistics included mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile ranges
(25th and 75th percentile) where appropriate. The following tests were applied: Wilcoxon rank test,
Kruskal-Wallis rank test, Student’s t test, Fisher’s exact test, and multiple linear regression.
Bonferroni’s adjustment was used for multiple comparisons. Non-parametric ROC analyses were
used to estimate the area under the ROC curve. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated by means
of the user community package “diagt”.

Results
Clinical data
The clinical characteristics of the 138 inpatients are shown in Table 1.
While no significant differences were found between in- and outpatients (n=96) for gender
distribution (Fisher’s exact test: p=0.106), the mean age of outpatients was significantly lower than
that of inpatients (Student’s t test for unpaired data: t=6.51, p<0.001).
NPS and saliva molecular testing
At enrollment, NPS rRT-PCR results were positive among 84/138 (60.9%) inpatients and 3/96
(3.1%) outpatients, while saliva in 67/127 (52.8%) inpatients and in 4/96 (4.2%) outpatients. Positive
NPS and saliva were more frequent among inpatients with a time lapse from symptoms of less than
7 days (37/38, 97.4% for NPS; 32/36, 88.9% for saliva), with respect to those with 7 to 14 days’
(40/74, 54.1% for NPS; 31/69, 44.9% for saliva) and those with more than 14 days’ (7/26, 26.9% for

NPS, 4/22, 18.2% for saliva) (Fisher’s exact test: p<0.001 for both NPS and saliva). Accordingly, the
lowest median Ct values of NPS and saliva were found among inpatients with a time lapse from
symptoms of less than 7 days (Table 2).
Among the 96 outpatients, four had positive findings at NPS and/or saliva testing (Table 3).
The patient who was negative at NPS but positive at saliva (n. 4), repeated NPS two and ten days
after enrollment, being positive in both cases.
On considering the overall inpatient population, agreement of 78.7% was found for rRT-PCR
among paired NPS and saliva samples (n=127, Cohen k=0.569, SE=0.086, p<0.001). Agreement was
91.67% in patients tested less than 7 days after onset of symptoms (n=36, Cohen k=0.372, SE=0.130,
p<0.001), 71.0% in those tested after 7 to 14 days (n=69, Cohen k=0.427, SE=0.117, p<0.001) and
81.8% in those after more than 14 days (n=22, Cohen k=0.488, SE=0.206, p=0.009).
NPS and saliva antigen testing
Figure 1 shows the individual CLEIA antigen levels measured in NPS and saliva after
subdividing patients on the basis of the time lapse between symptom onset and testing, data on
analytical reproducibility being reported in Table 4. SARS-CoV-2 antigen measured in NPS enabled
distinction between positive and negative swabs classified on the basis of rRT-PCR with a high
diagnostic accuracy (area under the ROC curve=0.939, 95% CI: 0.903-0.977). Based on the threshold
reported by the manufacturer (1.34 ng/L), the overall sensitivity and specificity were 81.6% (95% CI:
71.0-89.5%) and 93.8 (95% CI: 86.2-98.0%), respectively, with a positive likelihood ratio (LR) and
negative LR of 13.2 (95% CI: 5.62-31.1) and 0.19 (95% CI: 0.12-0.32), respectively.
Salivary SARS-CoV-2 antigen allowed to distinguish between positive and negative samples
classified on the basis of NPS rRT-PCR with a good diagnostic accuracy (area under the ROC
curve=0.805, 95% CI: 0.740-0.870) (Table 5). For salivary antigen, the manufacturer’s suggested
cut-off is 0.67 ng/L and the limit of quantification, 0.2 ng/L. With these two thresholds, sensitivity,
specificity, positive and negative LR were calculated considering the patients overall and after
subdividing them on the basis of duration of symptoms (Table 6).

Figure 2 shows the individual levels of SARS-CoV-2 antigen measured in NPS (n=23) and
saliva (n=32) and the corresponding Ct values obtained in a series of inpatients for whom two
consecutive samples were available: one at enrollment and the other, after 7 days.
Multiple linear regression analyses were performed considering the Ct values (Orf1ab) of
NPS and saliva as dependent variables, while antigen levels, clinical and demographic data as
predictor variables (Table 7). The Ct vales were significantly correlated with antigen values
independently from all clinical and demographic characteristics (r2=0.793 for NPS and r2=0.598 for
saliva).
Figure 3 shows the percentages of positive results for SARS-CoV-2 antigen by POC and
CLEIA in NPS and saliva after subdividing samples based on viral load estimated with the Ct values
at molecular analyses. POC sensitivity was satisfactory only for NPS with high viral loads (i.e. Ct
values < 25), while CLEIA enabled the detection of viral particles with a good sensitivity also for Ct
values above 25.
Discussion
There is a pressing need for novel strategies for the effective containment of a third wave of
SARS-Cov-2 infection, particularly while awaiting vaccines. The early, reliable identification of
SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be the key to reducing community transmission yet the
recommended diagnosis based on rRT-PCR analysis of NPS, although accurate, does not enable an
early and prompt diagnosis. Moreover, it calls personnel trained in NPS collection, analysis and
interpretation. SARS-CoV-2 antigen determination in NPS by point-of-care immunochromatographic
assays or by chemiluminescent assays developed with laboratory instrumentation has been proposed
in order to overcome these limitations, and to facilitate large scale analyses (22). This approach allows
a reduction in the analytical time but does not obviate the need to perform NPS by trained personnel
within dedicated medical cabinets. This bottle-neck could be overcome by using self-collected saliva.
To identify the best possible strategy for detecting the infection by antigenic rapid testing, in this
second wave pandemic we studied two series of subjects representing real world scenarios: inpatients

with COVID-19 disease and outpatients screened for SARS-CoV-2 due to a history of positive
contact or suspect clinical signs. NPS and saliva, simultaneously collected from all patients enrolled
in the study, were used as matrices for antigen detection employing immunochromatographic assays
and rapid CLEIA, and for viral sequences identification by rRT-PCR. As expected, the prevalence of
positive rRT-PCR findings in NPS was lower among outpatients (3%) than inpatients (61%); in this
latter group, it progressively declined in parallel with duration of symptoms, as the viral load, assessed
by the Ct value, declined. Based on this observation, our patients’ series was subdivided according to
the duration of symptoms before enrollment: less than one week, one to two weeks, and more than
two weeks. The molecular detection of viral sequences in NPS and saliva gave concordant results in
a high percentage of cases at the onset (92%) and in the late phases (82%) of the infection.
Conversely, patients enrolled one to two weeks after symptom onset were more likely to have positive
NPS results than positive saliva rRT-PCR results, in agreement with previous data in the literature
(16). These findings corroborate the hypothesis that buccal mucosa and salivary glands are the first
sites of viral colonization, and as saliva is the first route for viral dissemination, it represents a suitable
matrix for screening asymptomatic subjects, who are known to carry a viral load comparable to that
of symptomatic patients (6,23).
CLEIA antigen testing in NPS enabled a highly accurate distinction between positive and
negative swabs. The area under the ROC curve was higher than 0.9, and better than that reported
earlier in a Japanese series by Hirotsu et al. (20). Unlike the approach used in the cited study, we
evaluated a large number of infected patients and for any patient one single sample, while Hirotsu et
al. included serial samples from a limited number of infected patients. Moreover, CLEIA antigenic
testing in NPS had a very high sensitivity not only in the first week, but also in the second week from

findings.

considered a limitation of these rapid immunochromatographic assays taking also into account that
Ct values ranging from 20 to 30 are considered normal findings (25). We therefore suggest that
CLEIA antigenic testing in NPS should be preferred to rapid immunochromatographic assays for
obtaining accurate and fast results in the emergency setting to rapidly identify infected symptomatic
patients before their hospitalization, on considering that in this context NPS collection does not
represent a limitation. CLEIA antigenic testing, which requires a simple laboratory instrumentation
usable by minimally trained personnel, enables the result to be obtained in 30 minutes and processes
more than 100 samples per hour and can therefore be used by any emergency laboratory.
In the setting of screening asymptomatic subjects, salivary antigen might make the difference.
In self-collected saliva, CLEIA antigen allowed subjects with positive to be differentiated from those
with negative NPS with a good overall accuracy (0.81), which was even better in the early infection
phase (accuracy 0.88) (26). The antigen levels in saliva declined more rapidly that in NPS paralleling
the decline in viral load (27). Interestingly considering the patients with repeated sampling, the Ct of
NPS especially in the time frame of one-two weeks from symptom onset exerted a higher variable
pattern than saliva findings. This discrepancy might depend on saliva collection being more
standardized than NPS collection, but also on the possibility that viral RNA fragments in the absence
of infectivity could be detected in NPS by molecular testing (28). We focused our analyses mainly in
this early phase because it is more representative of the possible screening scenario. By using the
manufacturer’s suggested cut-off of 0.67 ng/L for CLEIA salivary antigen, in the presence of
specificity close to 100%, the highest sensitivity was achieved within the first week of onset of
symptoms. However, the 56.4% sensitivity observed is too low for screening programs, especially
when the prevalence of disease is low, as might occur in the near future following the effects of
lockdown policies. Therefore we evaluated whether an increase in sensitivity, without decreasing
specificity, could be achieved by lowering the cut-off to the limit of detection suggested by the
manufacturer (0.2 ng/L), and achieved 72% sensitivity and 96% specificity. We believe that CLEIA
salivary testing could be applied in screening asymptomatic cohorts (e.g. in schools or farms)

according to the following strategic plan: 1. Values above 0.67 ng/L to be considered positive for
SARS-CoV-2; values below 0.2 ng/L to be considered negative for SARS-CoV-2; values ranging
from 0.2 to 0.67 ng/L to be considered a grey zone and, for these samples, a reflex rRT-PCR activated.
To be effective, this strategy should be used on a large scale, and undertaken at least once a week, in
agreement with the proposal for less sensitive point of care tests with a quick return suggested as
useful

in

(29).

However,

immunochromatographic saliva testing had an unacceptable overall sensitivity of about 13%, in line
with previous data obtained with the same (26), or different diagnostic systems (25); this renders it
unhelpful, even if repeated daily.
The limitation of our study is represented by the low number of subjects enrolled for
screening. Feasibility of saliva testing for screening programs is under evaluation at the University
of Padova since October 2020, aiming to test saliva samples from about 4000 asymptomatic
employees every 15 days.
In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing by CLEIA is fast enough to meet requirements
for the early detection of the infection by any laboratory. CLEIA antigen testing in NPS might be
suggested in the emergency setting, while CLEIA antigen testing with molecular reflex testing for
the grey zone results in saliva is suggested by the authors of this study for large scale screening of
asymptomatic subjects in risk cohorts.
