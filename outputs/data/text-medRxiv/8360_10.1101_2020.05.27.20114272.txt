Summary
Background
To reduce transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019, European governments have implemented
successive measures to encourage social distancing. However, it remained unclear how effectively
measures reduced the spread of the virus, due to data complications. We examined how the effectivecontact rate (ECR) among European citizens evolved over the period with implemented measures using a
new data-oriented approach that is based on an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed
(SEIR) model.
Methods
Using the available data on the confirmed numbers of infections and hospitalizations, we first estimated
the daily number of infectious-, exposed- and susceptible individuals and subsequently estimated the ECR
with an iterative Poisson regression model, disregarding information on governmental measures. We then
studied change points in the daily ECRs to the moments of the governmental measures.
Findings
The change points in the daily ECRs were found to align with the implementation of governmental
interventions. At the end of the considered time-window, we found similar ECRs for Italy (0·29), Spain
(0·24), and Germany (0·27), while the ECR in the Netherlands (0·34), Belgium (0·35) and the UK (0·37)
were somewhat higher. The highest ECR was found for Sweden (0·45).
Interpretation
There seemed to be an immediate effect of banning events and closing schools, typically among the first
measures taken by the governments. The effect of additionally closing bars and restaurants seemed
limited. For most countries a somewhat delayed effect of the full lockdown was observed, and the ECR
after a full lockdown was not necessarily lower than an ECR after (only) a gathering ban.

Introduction
To reduce the transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) European governments have
implemented several non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed at reducing the number of contacts among
individuals1. The implementation of these governmental measures differs per country, but they do follow
a similar pattern. Events involving large numbers of participants are first suspended. Then the schools are
being closed, shortly followed by closure of non-essential services like bars and restaurants. Finally,
gathering is banned (Netherlands and Germany) or citizens are forced to stay home (United Kingdom
(UK), Italy, Spain and Belgium). The latter intervention is often followed up by further restrictions, e.g.
stricter surveillance by authorities. While in most countries these policies are applied to the entire nation,
Italy and Spain started applying these measures in the so-called ‘red zones’ (regions where the spread
started).

Stabilization of the number of daily new cases, deaths and hospitalizations was observed after the
implementation of the governmental measures. These effects have been quantified in country-specific
studies in which the estimated reproduction number was compared before, during and after measures
were taken2,3. Measure-specific effects have also been estimated for some European countries1. These
authors analyzed the observed deaths and estimated that ordering of lockdown, closure of schools, ban on
public events and encouragement of social distancing would reduce the reproduction number by
approximately 50%, 20%, 10% and 10%, respectively. This work assumed that the relative improvement
for these interventions was the same across countries, and that measures had an immediate and constant
effect (thus excluding possible delays). Another study used the number of newly confirmed infections,
and showed that the effect of venue closure, gathering ban, border closure, work ban, public event ban,
closure of schools and an additional lockdown reduced the reproduction number by approximately 36%,
34%, 31%, 31%, 23%, 8% and 5%, respectively. They also assumed homogeneous reductions across

countries and incorporated a fixed delay of 7 days before an effect would be visible in the number of new

infections4.

Measure-specific estimates of the reduction of the virus spread differ among the two studies1,4. This is not
surprising, since estimation of the influence of governmental interventions is hindered by several serious
limitations. The first limitation is the incompleteness of data. The number of infectious people without
symptoms is largely unknown and the ‘recovery’ of non-hospitalized contagious individuals is mostly
non-recorded. Both are important elements in the estimation of epidemic spread models such as the
Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model, to be able to determine (time-varying) contact
rates and the reproduction number5,6. Secondly, interventions may have a partially delayed effect and it is
difficult to identify how the effect of a measure changes over time. The third limitation concerns the
transmission times that are commonly assumed to be exponential distributed in epidemic disease models5,
while for COVID-19 it was shown that the incubation period is better fitted by a Weibull distribution7–11.
To accommodate these three limitations, we have relaxed some assumptions of the SEIR model and
implemented a data-driven sequential approach to estimate time-dependent contact-rate profiles,
disregarding a priori information on governmental measures. We were then able to compare the change
points in the contact-rate profiles to the moments at which measures were implemented. This way, for
each country separately, we observed whether the influence of measures was visible, immediate or
delayed. The advantage of our country-specific analysis is that it does not require harmonization of
governmental interventions across countries, it does not impose similarity across countries (e.g. decrease
in the contact rate) and it allows a flexible measure-delay effect per country rather than imposing a fixed
one. We illustrate our results for seven European countries that adopted different strategies.

interactive dashboard hosted by the Johns Hopkins University12. These numbers were cross-validated with
other sources (official sites of authorities and https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). The
hospitalization numbers were extracted from the official daily reports released by the public health
authorities separately for each country (Appendix A). We collected data until 2020-04-09, that includes
information before, during, and after governmental interventions, but does exclude relaxation of
interventions. Additionally, we used data on the mobility of communities made available by Google13
(Appendix E).
Epidemic disease model
We modelled the daily confirmed numbers of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths per country with an
extended and time-discretized SEIR model5,14 (Figure 1), such that the total population, of size 𝑁𝑁, can be
distributed over the Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infectious (I) and Removed (R) states (Figure 1). We
assumed that the entire population is susceptible, as reported by the World Health Organization15.
[Figure 1 here]
A susceptible individual in 𝑆𝑆(𝑡𝑡) can become exposed (𝐸𝐸(𝑡𝑡)) after an effective contact with an infectious

individual. There will be an incubation period of random length before individuals become infectious and
enter state 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡) (either tested 𝐼𝐼𝑇𝑇 (𝑡𝑡) or non-tested 𝐼𝐼𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 (𝑡𝑡)). We assumed that this delay follows a Weibull

distribution, with a shape parameter equal to 2·32 and a scale parameter equal to 6·50 (giving an average

delay of 5·76 days), based on the preliminary study of 33 COVID-19 patients9. The removed state 𝑅𝑅(𝑡𝑡),

𝑅𝑅 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇 (𝑡𝑡) + 𝑅𝑅𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 (𝑡𝑡), refers to individuals that are no longer contagious (due to death or recovery).
The number of susceptible and exposed individuals at day 𝑡𝑡 is unknown.

The number of removed people is also only partially known, since infectious individuals are only
followed-up when they are hospitalized and if they die from the disease.
Furthermore, the infectious period of infected individuals (either tested or not) is unknown, so we
assumed this period to be random, following an exponential distribution with a mean, 𝛾𝛾𝐼𝐼−1 , of 2·316,17. For

simplicity, we assumed that hospitalization takes place on the same day of appearance of symptoms, and
we assumed that hospitalized individuals, 𝐻𝐻𝑇𝑇 (𝑡𝑡), can no longer infect others because they are quarantined.
The available information at day 𝑡𝑡 includes the observed cumulative number of confirmed infected

individuals, 𝑌𝑌(𝑡𝑡) = 𝐼𝐼𝑇𝑇 (𝑡𝑡) + 𝐻𝐻𝑇𝑇 (𝑡𝑡) + 𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇 (𝑡𝑡), and the daily number of new hospitalizations, ∆𝐻𝐻 + (𝑡𝑡),

representing individuals that transit from 𝐼𝐼𝑇𝑇 (𝑡𝑡) to 𝐻𝐻𝑇𝑇 (𝑡𝑡). Since the number of hospitalizations was
known, we did not use the transition rates 𝛾𝛾𝐻𝐻 and 𝜔𝜔 in this study.

The main parameter of interest is the Effective Contact Rate (ECR), 𝛽𝛽(𝑡𝑡). The ECR can be interpreted as
follows: The a priori probability that an infectious person upon contact meets a susceptible individual is
𝑆𝑆(𝑡𝑡)/𝑁𝑁. If we assume that every contact between an infectious and a susceptible individual leads to a

transmission of the virus, then we can view 𝛽𝛽(𝑡𝑡) as the average number of contacts on day 𝑡𝑡. In this case,
the expected number of newly exposed individuals that one infectious person will introduce is

𝛽𝛽(𝑡𝑡)𝑆𝑆(𝑡𝑡)/𝑁𝑁. Since there are 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡) infectious individuals on day 𝑡𝑡, 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡)𝛽𝛽(𝑡𝑡)𝑆𝑆(𝑡𝑡)/𝑁𝑁 newly exposed

individuals are expected on the same day. If we do not assume that all of these contacts lead to the
transmission of the virus, then 𝛽𝛽(𝑡𝑡) can be viewed as an effective number of contacts that leads to newly

exposed individuals. The ECR is assumed to be time-dependent, since the introduction of different

governmental interventions over time may affect the total number of contacts. Note that we did not
investigate the effective reproduction number 𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒 (𝑡𝑡), which is a function of all transition rates18,19, since
interventions only affect 𝛽𝛽 (𝑡𝑡).

Parameter Estimation

In order to obtain an ECR profile per country, we estimated 𝛽𝛽(𝑡𝑡) at day 𝑡𝑡 ∈ {1,2, … , 𝑛𝑛}, but imposed the

restriction that the ECR profile is non-increasing. We estimated the ECR from the following set of
equations:
(1)

𝔼𝔼[∆𝑌𝑌(𝑡𝑡)] = ∑𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖=0 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡−𝑖𝑖 ⋅ 𝜌𝜌 ⋅ Δ𝐸𝐸 + (𝑖𝑖 ) = ∑𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖=0 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡−𝑖𝑖 ⋅ 𝜌𝜌 ⋅ 𝐼𝐼(𝑖𝑖 ) ⋅ 𝛽𝛽(𝑖𝑖 ) ⋅ 𝑆𝑆(𝑖𝑖)/𝑁𝑁 ,

where Δ is the symbol for daily change in the values, i.e. ∆𝑈𝑈(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑈𝑈(𝑡𝑡) − 𝑈𝑈(𝑡𝑡 − 1), 𝐸𝐸 + (𝑡𝑡) = 𝐸𝐸(𝑡𝑡) +

𝑌𝑌(𝑡𝑡) + 𝐼𝐼𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 (𝑡𝑡) + 𝑅𝑅𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 (𝑡𝑡) and 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 is the discretized Weibull probability that a susceptible individual

becomes infectious 𝑡𝑡 days after exposure. The daily number of susceptible individuals 𝑆𝑆(𝑡𝑡) and the daily
number of infectious individuals 𝐼𝐼 (𝑡𝑡) at day 𝑡𝑡 were both unknown and derived from the observed data

𝑌𝑌(𝑡𝑡) (or ∆𝑌𝑌(𝑡𝑡)) and ∆𝐻𝐻 + (𝑡𝑡), using some assumptions on the incubation and infectious time periods (see

Appendix B for details). We assumed that the number of newly exposed individuals Δ𝐸𝐸 + (𝑡𝑡) at day 𝑡𝑡 is

Poisson distributed with expectation 0·5(𝐼𝐼 (𝑡𝑡) + 𝐼𝐼 (𝑡𝑡 + 1)) ∙ 𝛽𝛽(𝑡𝑡) ⋅0·5(𝑆𝑆 (𝑡𝑡) + 𝑆𝑆 (𝑡𝑡 + 1))/𝑁𝑁. Then, Δ𝑌𝑌(𝑡𝑡)

is also Poisson distributed with mean 𝔼𝔼[Δ𝑌𝑌(𝑡𝑡)] = 𝜌𝜌 ∑𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖=0 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡−𝑖𝑖 ⋅ [𝐼𝐼(𝑖𝑖) + 𝑖𝑖 (𝑖𝑖 + 1)] ⋅ 𝛽𝛽(𝑖𝑖 ) ⋅ [𝑆𝑆(𝑖𝑖 ) +

𝑆𝑆(𝑖𝑖 + 1)]/(4 𝑁𝑁). To estimate 𝛽𝛽(𝑡𝑡), we fitted a Poisson regression model to the daily increases of tested

infected individuals Δ𝑌𝑌(𝑡𝑡), selecting the data from the day of the first COVID-19 fatality in the country.

We assumed that 𝛽𝛽(𝑡𝑡) did not change on the last day of our data and included 𝜌𝜌 as a separate parameter in

the regression analysis. Finally, we obtained confidence intervals for the estimates by means of the
multivariate delta method. All estimations have been performed in R version 3.6.3.
Sensitivity Analyses

To investigate the robustness of our analysis we conducted several sensitivity analyses: we changed the
mean infectious period from 2·3 to 4·6 days20. We changed our mean incubation time to 6·4 days (instead
of 5·76 days9). Additionally, we tested the influence of choosing a gamma distribution for the infectious
period and an exponential distribution for the incubation time. We furthermore investigated the scenario
of pre-symptomatic transmission7,8,21.
Governmental Interventions
In the present study, we focused on four types of governmental interventions that were trying to limit
contacts between inhabitants. Figure 2 shows the timing of these four interventions for seven European
countries. A full list of governmental interventions can be found in Appendix A.

Results
The estimates of the daily ECR for each of the seven countries, together with their 95% confidence
intervals, are provided in Figure 3.
[Figure 3 here]
All countries have a non-increasing profile of the ECR, because of the model restriction, that consists of a
few piecewise constant values. If measures had an immediate effect on the ECR, we would expect to see
that the times of change points coincide exactly with at least one of the measures. However, due to the
variability in the data, it is very likely that a change point is estimated just one (or two) day(s) after (or
before) the real date, since daily ECRs that are similar in a period are merged to create the piece-wise
constant ECRs. Then, for smaller changes in ECRs, the distance in time between the implementation of
measures and the change point can become larger. In the majority of cases, we did indeed see that the
drop in the ECR happens within one day of the implementation of at least one of the measures, suggesting
that this measure affected the ECR, possibly in combination with measures implemented few days earlier.
Our main observations are summarized in Table 1. In Italy we observed a large decrease (9·14→1·60)
after the first measures (closure of schools and event ban in the ‘red zone’) were implemented. Another
serious decrease (to 1·28) occurred a day after the ‘red zone’ went into a full lockdown and events were
banned in the whole country. A similar decrease (to 0·91) was found, in correspondence with the ordering
of a nationwide lockdown. However, we observed a further serious decrease (to 0·46), almost a week
after the lockdown was ordered. In this period, Italy enforced the lockdown with increased police forces,
assisted by the army (Appendix A). For Spain, we observed two large decreases. The first change
happened within a day since the banning of events and closure of schools in the ‘red zone’ (3.14→1.18).
The second effect (to 0·48) became visible a week after the whole country went in lockdown. As in Italy,
the Spanish government seriously increased the amount of police forces on the street days after ordering
the lockdown. In Germany the first set of official measures of banning events, railway traffic reduction

and closure of schools coincided with the first serious decrease in the ECR (2·02→0·68), one day before
the ‘red-zone’ Bavaria went in lockdown. Two days after a full lockdown was ordered, we assessed a
second change (to 0·31). For the UK, a first decrease in ECR (1·71→1·08) was visible when the UK
Chief Medical Officers raised the risk-level to high (Appendix A), a measure that was initially not
considered in the present study (Figure 2). A second decrease in the ECR (to 0·74) was estimated after the
lockdown. The third and last decrease (to 0·37) was not traceable to the mentioned four measures but
might be attributable to letters sent to 30 million households, containing details on the lockdown, rules
and health information. In the Netherlands the ECR decreased (1·21→0·93) on the day after the schools
and the restaurants were closed. A more serious drop (to 0·34) became visible after gathering were
officially banned. In Belgium, the estimated ECR did first decrease (1·44→1·30) after events were
banned and schools and restaurants were closed. More than a week after the lockdown was ordered, a
serious decrease was observed (to 0·34). In Sweden, a decrease in the ECR (0·88→0·57) became visible
when the Swedish government warned its citizens for the first time and banned large events. After more
restrictive measures (banning of smaller events) were ordered, a small decrease (to 0·45) was estimated.
[Table 1 here]
In Table 2 we reported the estimated ECR before any interventions were implemented (𝛽𝛽̂𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ), and the

final ECR after all interventions were taken (𝛽𝛽̂𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 ). The 𝛽𝛽̂𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 varies largely across countries, from 0·88
for Sweden to 9·03 for Italy. However, the variability in 𝛽𝛽̂𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 is much smaller ([0·24, 0·45]). We

observed similar ECR in Italy (0·29), Spain (0·24), and Germany (0·27), while the ECR in the

Netherlands (0·34), Belgium (0·35) and the UK (0·37) were somewhat higher. The ECR in Sweden
(0·45), where the least rigorous measures were implemented, seemed to be the highest. The estimated
fraction of tested infectious individuals 𝜌𝜌, can be found in Table 2 in Appendix D.

In Figure 4, the daily observed number of new confirmed infections Δ𝑌𝑌(𝑡𝑡) (the points in the graph) are

shown together with the fit of our Poisson regression model (the continuous lines) and their

corresponding 95% prediction intervals. The results of the sensitivity analyses can be found in Appendix
C, demonstrating that our ECR profile was robust against violation of our assumptions.

Discussion
In this study we have extended the SEIR model to allow for general transition-time distributions and
developed an estimation strategy in which we first retrieved the latent number of infectious and
susceptible individuals per day, and subsequently estimated the ECR per day. This way, we did not make
a priori assumptions on consistency across countries and delays in the effect of governmental
interventions. Our findings show that change points in the daily ECRs overlap with moments of
governmental interventions. Overall, the first set of measures taken by the governments seems to have an
immediate (although heterogeneous) effect. This first set of measures typically included the closure of
schools and daycares, as well as banning events. Implementing a full lockdown after the first set of
measures, either locally or nationally, seemed to coincide with changes in the ECR, but in several
countries only when this was enforced with increased police surveillance.
Although the effect of closing schools and banning events has been demonstrated in previous studies1,4,
our findings suggested a stronger (combined) effect of the first set of measures than found before. On the
contrary, these studies observed more serious effects of a gathering bans, lockdowns, and closure of bars
and restaurants1,4. These differences may be explained by the additional model restrictions (constant
contact rates, country homogeneous effect sizes, and fixed delay in the effects) that these studies
implemented. Therefore, they could not determine whether the effect of the full lockdown did change
over time as we observed. Our observation is in line with the Google mobility data (Appendix E) that
suggests that mobility did further reduce in the days after the ordering of the lockdown in Italy, Spain and

(less) in the UK and Belgium. The closure of bars and restaurants frequently coincided with the moment
of lockdown (Italy, Spain and Germany) or with closing schools (UK, Netherlands, Belgium), thus it is
difficult to distinguish the effect of the different measures. In Italy and Spain, the combined measures had
only limited influence on the contact rate, and in Sweden national restrictions on restaurant and bars had
no effect. So, it seems unlikely that the closure of bars and restaurants had an additional effect (to the
previous measures taken) on the ECR.
Our findings strongly suggest that the ECRs in Italy, Spain, and Germany were very similar after all
measures were implemented. This was unexpected since more restrictive measures were taken in Italy and
Spain, but it was consistent with other findings1. The final ECRs for the Netherlands, Belgium and the
UK were also comparable but somewhat higher. The difference between the two groups was not the result
of lower compliance to lockdown restrictions, since the Google mobility data showed similar decreases in
activity in Belgium and the UK as observed in Spain and Italy. We did therefore conclude that gathering
bans (as ordered in Germany and the Netherlands) were as effective as full lockdowns (as implemented in
Italy, Spain, UK and Belgium). An ECR for COVID-19 of 0·30 seems to characterize a society in which
citizens only have interactions for essential needs (e.g. grocery shopping and travel of healthcare
workers). It is important to observe that despite the fact that the ECRs of the countries are comparable
after all the interventions, the ECRs did seriously differ in the period before interventions were
implemented. This suggests that the different interventions cannot have the same (absolute and relative)
effect across countries, as assumed in previous studies1,4.
Several limitations of our study need to be addressed. First, our method did not provide estimates of effect
sizes for the different measures, contrarily to what is done in previous papers1,4, and therefore our results
may seem more exploratory. We explicitly made this choice, since interventions were often taken
simultaneously and there was no information about the delay on the effect of various measures. All
measures try to directly lower the ECR, but the success highly depends on the compliance of the citizens.
This was supported by the Google data, showing that reductions in mobility do not align directly with

implemented measures. A second limitation of our approach is the implemented restriction, imposing
non-increasing ECRs. This choice was motivated to avoid additional oscillations in the parameter
estimate due to the large variability present in the data (shown by the observations outside the prediction
intervals in Figure 4), possibly a result of delays in testing and reporting. Thirdly, our analysis was based
on a few assumptions (although supported by other research), like the choice of distributions for the
incubation and infectious periods. The influence of our modelling assumptions was investigated in the
sensitivity analysis (Appendix C) and showed that variation in the shape of ECR profile was limited for
all countries and did not shift the change points. Lastly, we assumed that the fraction of tested infectious
individuals 𝜌𝜌 was unknown but constant, while it may change with test policies within countries. Again,

the sensitivity analysis showed that the percentage of tested individuals did not influence the shape of the
ECR profile.
The main strength of our work is the data-oriented approach: we focused on the information present in the
data and modelled it with an extended version of a well-known epidemic disease model, based on a
limited number of assumptions. The data demonstrated essential change points in ECR and the sensitivity
analysis demonstrated that our assumptions have little influence, making the ECR profile trustworthy.
This solid ECR profile could then be connected to moments at which governments implemented
measures, evaluating direct and delayed effects. We believe that such approaches are more valuable than
the approaches used so far, since the data collection does not satisfy assumptions that are normally valid
in other areas of epidemiological research. With our approach and the data of multiple countries, we have
been able to disentangle the influence of several governmental interventions. We have showed an
immediate influence of banning events and closing schools on the spread of the virus, and a somewhat
delayed effect of the full lockdown. Closing bars and restaurants seems to have only a limited effect
instead.
Although we observed that the first set of governmental interventions had an immediate causal effect, the
causal pathway of the first measures remains unclear. This set of measures might have made citizens

realize the severity of the situation, which consequently made them reduce their social activity. This
would confound the effect estimates of the physical constraints introduced by the interventions and should
thus not be overlooked. When governments will decide to relax their interventions, the ECR might
increase both as a direct result of the vanishing physical restrictions, and indirectly via the relaxation in
the behavior of citizens. As a result, the ECR before the intervention was implemented could seriously
differ from the ECR after the same intervention is lifted again. Prediction studies for exit strategies
presenting counterfactual scenarios1,22–24 should therefore be dealt with caution.

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the SEIR model. When there are both susceptible individuals, 𝑆𝑆(𝑡𝑡), as well
as infectious individuals, 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡), a susceptible individual gets exposed 𝐸𝐸(𝑡𝑡) at an exponential rate of 𝛽𝛽(𝑡𝑡)𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡)/𝑁𝑁.
Once exposed it takes a Weibull distributed time before the individual becomes infectious. The individual is tested
with probability 𝜌𝜌 and might subsequently be hospitalized. The infectious period of non-hospitalized infectious
individuals is assumed to follow an Exponential distribution after which the individuals are transferred to the
removed states.

Figure 2 Timing of interventions. Timing of four main governmental interventions (lockdown, restaurants closed,
schools closed and events suspended) for the seven European countries considered in this paper. Colors are
representative for the countries, while symbols are representative for the measures taken. For each of the considered
measures, we have either a filled symbol (measure taken in the whole country), or an empty symbol (measure taken
in the ‘red zones’ or at a lower intensity).

Figure 3 ECR profiles per country. The trend in the point estimates of the ECR 𝛽𝛽̂(𝑡𝑡) are presented as colored lines
(country specific colors, following the legend in Figure 2). The black continuous lines represent the 95% confidence
intervals of the point estimates. The gray vertical dashed lines indicate the moments when the governmental
measures were taken, with the corresponding symbol(s) (same symbols introduced in Figure 2).
