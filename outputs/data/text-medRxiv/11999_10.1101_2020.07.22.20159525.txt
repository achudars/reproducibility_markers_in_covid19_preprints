Abstract

27

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global

28

pandemics. To facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, various RT-LAMP assays

29

using 19 sets of primers had been developed, but never been compared. We performed

30

comparative evaluation of the 19 sets of primers using 4 RNA standards and 29 clinical

31

samples from COVID-19 patients. Six of 15 sets of primers were firstly identified to have

32

faster amplification when tested with four RNA standards, and were further subjected to

33

parallel comparison with the remaining four primer sets using 29 clinical samples. Among

34

these 10 primer sets, Set-4 had the highest positive detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 (82.8%),

35

followed by Set-10, Set-11, Set-13 and Set-14 (75.9%), and Set-14 showed the fastest

36

amplification speed (< 8.5 minutes), followed by Set-17 (< 12.5 minutes). Based on the

37

overall detection performance, Set-4, Set-10, Set-11, Set-13, Set-14 and Set-17 that target

38

Nsp3, S, S, E, N and N gene regions of SARS-CoV-2, respectively, are determined to be

39

better than the other primer sets. Two RT-LAMP assays with the Set-14 primers in

40

combination with any one of four other primer sets (Set-4, Set-10, Set-11, and Set-13) are

41

recommended to be used in the COVID-19 surveillance.

Introduction

47

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the newly discovered coronavirus

48

SARS-CoV-2 1,2, is rapidly spreading throughout the world, posing a huge challenge to global

49

public health security. As of 1 June, 2020, it has infected over 6 million people, and resulted in

50

at least 376,320 deaths globally. In the absence of effective antiviral drugs or efficacious

51

vaccines, early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential for the containment of

52

COVID-19 3,4, without which it is impossible to timely implement intervention and quarantine

53

measures, and difficult to track contacts in order to limit virus spread.

54

Nucleic acid testing of various approaches are widely used as the primary tool for
3,4

55

diagnosing COVID-19

56

have been set as the gold standard for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection

57

because of their proven track record as being the most robust technology in molecular

58

diagnostics

59

supply of electricity and well-trained personnel in large general hospitals and health care

60

facilities, or government labs (such as CDC), and it is relatively time-consuming (about 1.5-2

61

hrs). These limit its capacity in point-of-care settings. Moreover, visiting a clinical setting for

62

testing increases the risk of spreading the virus. Therefore, an alternative, fast, simple, and

63

sensitive point-of-care testing (POCT) is highly needed to facilitate the detection of

64

SARS-CoV-2 infection in resource-limited settings 3,7.

4-6

. Among them, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) methods

. However, the RT-qPCR assay relies on sophisticated facilities with reliable

65

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a promising POCT method with high

66

sensitivity, specificity, and rapidity, and it is easy-to-use 8. To overcome the limitation of

67

RT-qPCR assay, a number of RT-LAMP assays using at least 19 sets of different primers had

68

been developed in the last few months for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 9-19. Although these

69

assays had proven sensitive and effective for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, how do they

70

compare with each other have not been evaluated. In this study, we compared all 19 sets of

Results

76

Strategy for the comparative evaluation

77

There were 19 sets of SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP primers available for the evaluation.

78

Among these primers, 2 sets were designed for binding to the Nsp3 (non-structural proteins), 5

79

for RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), 2 for E (envelope protein) and 2 for N

80

(nucleocapsid protein) gene regions of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1). These regions are highly

81

conserved among SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, but distinct from five other human

82

coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1). Other 4 sets of primers were

83

dispersed throughout the genome of SARS-CoV-2. The primers binding to the same target

84

gene are adjacent to each other and cover genomic segments from 251 to 1954 bps. To

85

minimize the consumption of clinical samples, and economize experimental efforts, we

86

adopted a strategy that initiated by a preliminary evaluation of the primers binding to the four

87

major genomic regions using in vitro-transcribed RNA standard, and followed by a further

88

evaluation of preliminarily selected primers together with four sets of other primers using

89

clinical RNA samples (Fig. 1).

90

Preliminary evaluation of primer sets

91

Using 3000 copies of in vitro-transcribed RNA standards of four gene segments of

92

SARS-CoV-2, we assessed the amplification performance of 15 sets of RT-LAMP primers.

93

Except for Set-3 that failed in amplification, all other primer sets generated amplification

94

curves with Time threshold (Tt) of 7.5-15.9 minutes and reached the plateau phase within 20

95

minutes (Fig. 2). In particular, six sets of the primers showed faster amplification with 10

96

minutes less Tt values than other primer sets (Fig. 2), implying higher amplification

97

sensitivity. The six sets (Set-2, Set-5, Set-13, Set-14, Set-17 and Set-18) of primers contain

98

three that bind to N gene and another three that bind to Nsp, RdRp, and E genes, respectively.

99

The six sets of primers were selected for further evaluation using clinical samples together

100

with other four primer sets that bind to other genomic regions of the virus.

101

Comparative evaluation of ten primer sets using clinical samples

102

A total of 29 RNA samples extracted from COVID-19 patients were used at 4-fold

103

dilutions. Except for one, all 29 RNA samples were detected as being SARS-CoV-2 positive

104

by at least one of the primer sets. Nine samples were detected as positive by all ten sets of

105

primers and almost all reactions (except for one with 49.5 minutes) had Tt values of less than

106

15.1 minutes, indicating a high viral load. The primer Set-4 detected 24 positive samples,

107

showing the highest positive detection rate (82.8%), followed by Set-10, Set-11, Set-13 and

108

Set-17 that all detected 22 positive samples (75.9%) (Fig. 3A). Two primer sets, Set-1 and

109

Set-18, had the lowest positive detection rates of 44.8% and 62.1%, respectively, and thus

110

were excluded in the subsequent analyses. Comparison showed that the primer Set-14 had

111

the lowest mean Tt values of less than 8.4 minutes, followed by Set-10, Set-11 and Set-13

112

that had mean Tt values of 11.1-11.5 minutes (Fig. 3A). These four fast-amplification sets of

113

primers also have small standard deviations (SD) of 1.7-2.9, indicating that the RT-LAMP

114

with these four primer sets are relatively more stable and faster than the other 15 sets. As

115

expected, the primer Set-14 is the most efficient one that generated the fastest (the lowest Tt

116

value) and the second fastest amplification in 14 and 7 samples, followed by Set-17 which is

117

the fastest in 6 samples and second best in 9 samples, demonstrating these two primer sets

118

had the best performance.

119

Because of their relatively high positive detection rate and lower Tt values, six primer sets

120

including Set-4, Set-10, Set-11, Set-13, Set-14 and Set-17 were subjected to further pairwise

121

comparison. The comparison showed that any two sets of these primers had high

122

concordance performance (87.8-97.6%) for 41 clinical RNA samples (including 29 positive

123

and 12 negative for SARS-CoV-2) (Fig. 3B). All the six primer sets had high amplification

124

efficiency with mean Tt values of less than 12 minutes (Fig. 3B). In particular, Set-14 had

125

faster amplification than the other five sets of primers (8.3-8.4 vs. 10.5-11.2 minutes).

126

Specficity evaluation of four optimal primer sets based on sequence alignment

127

The specificity of these primer sets had been reported in previous studies

9-19

. In this

128

evaluation, all ten primer sets did not generate amplification for all 12 COVID-19 negative

129

RNA samples. To further examine the specificity of six recommended primer sets (Set-4,

130

Set-10, Set-11, Set-13, Set-14 and Set-17) to other human coronaviruses, we performed

131

sequence alignment analyses. SARS-CoV-2 shared 79.5% genomic homology with

132

SARS-CoV 1,2, indicating a relatively high sequence identity; but it was largely distinct from

133

MERS-CoV and other four human coronaviruses (Supplementary Fig. S1). In particular,

134

several primers of Set-4, Set-10 and Set-17 correspond to gaps or insertions of the genomes

135

of MERS-CoV and other four common human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1.

136

These results implied that these six sets of primers were unable to bind to the genomes of

137

MERS-CoV and four common human coronaviruses, therefore more specific for

138

SARS-CoV-2. However, because of high sequence identity and the use of mismatch-tolerant

139

RT-LAMP system that allows the presence of few mismatched bases between primers and

140

templates, the SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assays may generate a cross-amplification of

141

SARS-CoV.

148

serological assays are not suitable for this purpose, because detectable antibodies always

early diagnostics of COVID-19. Despite being the most robust diagnostic tests,

151

RT-qPCR-based assays are more centralized in core facilities, and they are not amenable for

152

large-scale monitoring for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic virus carriers in point-of-care

bases between primer and templates in a mismatch-tolerant version

169

version, we assessed 19 sets of SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP primers. Six sets of primers with

170

faster amplification speed were firstly selected from 15 sets of primers using 4 RNA

171

standards, and then tested with other 4 primer sets using 41 clinical samples. Eight sets of

172

primers showed either comparable or better performance than the other 2 sets of primers

173

(Set-1 and Set-18) as determined by positive detection rate (>69.0%). Of the 8 sets of primers,

174

six were further selected based on high positive detection rate and/or overall faster

175

amplification speed (with mean Tt of less than 13 minutes). The six primer sets are Set-4,

176

Set-10, Set-11, Set-13, Set-14 and Set-17 that correspond to Nsp3, S, S, E, N, and N genes of

177

SARS-CoV-2, respectively.

. Using this new

178

Among these primer sets, the N gene-based RT-LAMP assays (Set-14 and Set-17) had the

179

fastest amplification speed, followed by S and E gene-based assay (Set-10, Set-11 and Set-13).

180

This result suggested that the N gene-based RT-LAMP assay is more sensitive in detecting

181

SARS-CoV-2 than that based on other genes, consisting with results of RT-qPCR assays 5.

182

Interestingly, previous studies showed that the sensitivities of Set-4 and Set-11 were more

183

than 100 copies per 25 µL reaction

184

primer sets generated comparable performance with highly sensitive primers Set-13 and

185

Set-14 (less than 3 copies per 25 µL reaction) 16,17. In addition, two of our previous reported

186

primers, Set-8 and Set-18, exhibited high sensitivities of 3-20 copies per 25 µL reaction and

193

the six sets of optimal primers had good specificity to SARS-CoV-2, albeit they might

194

generate non-specific amplification for SARS-CoV due to a high degree of sequence identity.

195

However, given the lethal nature of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV

196

positive result for SARS-CoV might also be of clinical importance.

25

, a non-specific

197

Two nucleic acid assays targeting different genes are suggested to be used in the

198

detection of SARS-CoV-2 to avoid potential false-negative results 5. Based on comparable

199

performances, any two of the six optimal primer sets (Set-4, Set-10, Set-11, Set-13, Set-14

200

and Set-17) are recommend to be used in the detection of SARS-CoV-2. However,

201

simultaneous use of Set-10 and Set-11, or Set-14 and Set-17 should be avoided because the

202

former two sets target S gene and the latter two sets target N gene. In addition, because of its

203

very fast amplification speed, Set-14 is strongly encouraged to be preferentially selected for

204

the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Apart from the six recommend primer sets, other primers

205

such as Set-2 and Set-5 also had good performance, and can also be used in the monitoring of

206

COVID-19 infections.

207

Another advantage of our version of the RT-LAMP assay is that the results are easily

208

visualized with a pH-sensitive indicator dye (e.g. cresol red and neutral red) 26. Moreover, a

209

combination of a nucleic acid extraction-free protocol and a master RT-LAMP mix containing

210

all reagents (enzymes, primers, magnesium, nucleotides, dye and additives), except for the

211

template, enables the development of a simple kit that can be used at home, or a

212

community-based diagnosis center for the detection of COVID-19 infection 3,27.

213

In summary, we evaluated and selected six optimal primer sets from 19 sets of

214

SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP primers through a comparative evaluation with clinical RNA

215

samples from COVID-19 patients. Two RT-LAMP assays with the Set-14 primers and any

216

one of the other four primer sets (Set-4, Set-10, Set-11 and Set-13) are strongly

217

recommended to be used in the COVID-19 surveillance to facilitate the early finding of

Preparation of RNA standard

227

To prepare RNA standard, four SARS-CoV-2 genomic segments (2720-3620 nt,

243

To assess the performance of 19 sets of RT-LAMP primers in the detection of

244

SARS-CoV-2, an optimized mismatch-tolerant RT-LAMP method that has higher sensitivity

245

and faster amplification speed than the conventional ones was used. A 25 µL RT-LAMP

246

reaction mixture was prepared with 1x isothermal amplification buffer, 6 mM MgSO4, 1.4 mM

247

dNTPs, 8 units of WarmStart Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase, 7.5 units of WarmStartR RT, 0.15 unit

of Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, 0.2 μM each of primers of F3 and B3, 1.6 μM each of

249

primers of FIP and BIP, 0.4 μM each of loop primer LF and/or LB, and 0.4 mM SYTO 9 (Life

250

technologies, Carlsbad, CA, United States). The enzymes were all purchased from New

251

England Biolabs (Beverly, MA, United States). In general, 3 μL of RNA standard or samples

252

were added into each RT-LAMP reaction. The reaction was run at 63  for 50 minutes with

253

real-time monitoring by the LightCycler 96 real-time PCR System (Roche Diagnostics,
