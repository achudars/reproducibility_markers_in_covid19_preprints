Abstract

2

Many countries around the world have all seen a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases as the second

3

wave since the beginning of October 2020. Decline of antibodies response to severe acute

4

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that was reported exclusively in the early

5

month increases the risk of reinfection for convalescent individuals. There is a current need to

6

follow the maintenance of special antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we reported

7

changes of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent patients over 8 months.

8

Antibodies of all 20 participants targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding-domain (RBD)

9

had decreased from a mean OD 450 value 1.78 to 0.38 over 8 months. The neutralizing

10

antibody (NAb) titers decreased from the mean ID 50 value 836 to 170. The NAb titers were

11

significantly correlated with IgG level during 8 months (P<0.001). Furthermore, while

12

RBD-specific IgG existence of 25% (5/20) convalescent plasma was undetectable, the NAb

13

titers of 15% (3/20) convalescent plasma decreased below the threshold. In addition,

14

compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (S-D614), lower titers of neutralizing antibodies against its

15

G614 variant were shown at 8 months after symptom onset. This study has important

16

implications when considering antibody protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.

Methods

19

Twenty patients who had recovered from COVID-19 were included in our cohort (see Table).

20

Blood samples were obtained in February and October with correspond to a median of 25

21

days (range 5 to 33 days) and 230 days (range 221 to 248 days) after symptom onset (Figure

22

A). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to evaluate the presence of

23

anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG over 8 months. A preliminary

24

positive cutoff was set with the mean value of negative controls above 3 standard deviation1.

25

The neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were measured by SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (S-D614) and

26

S-G614 mutant pseudovirus-based assays in 293T-ACE2 cells. The inhibitory dose (ID 50 ) was

27

calculated as the titers of NAbs.

Results

30

Antibodies of all 20 participants targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD had decreased from a

31

mean OD 450 value 1.78 (range 0.55 to 2.72) to 0.38 (range 0.15 to 1.01) over 8 months. When

32

OD 450 value was less than 0.26, the specimen was considered seronegative. At the follow-up

33

time point 2 (in October), IgG level of 5 participants (25%) became negative (Figure B). A

34

similar decline had been observed in the pseudovirus neutralization assay. The NAb titers

35

decreased from the mean ID 50 value 836.55 (range 263-1160) to 170.30 (range 33 to 365).

36

Among them, NAb titers of 3 participants (15%) were lower than the threshold at 8 months

37

after symptom onset (Figure C). Moreover, the NAb titers were significantly correlated with IgG

38

levels (Figure D).

evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 S-G614, which has been the dominant form of SARS-CoV-2

41

worldwide. NAb titers of 5 participants (25%) decreased below the threshold against S-G614

42

mutant pseudovirus. Moreover, there was a statistically significant difference in neutralizing

43

efficacy of convalescent plasma to SARS-CoV-2 S-D614 and S-G614 mutant pseudovirus

44

(Figure E).

Discussion

47

In this study, we reported changes of humoral immunity response in SARS-CoV-2

48

convalescent patients over 8 months. In agreement with previous follow-up studies within a

49

shorter time, decline of both IgG and NAb level were observed1-3. Furthermore, better

50

significant correlation between IgG and NAb level in February than in October indicates that

51

anamnestic immune response and other protective immunity should be evaluated in the

52

context of low-level neutralizing antibodies4.

53

Facing the challenge of the second wave of SARS-CoV-2, the risk of reinfection by the

54

currently dominant SARS-CoV-2 S-G614 variant is worthy to be considered, especially for

55

Chinese convalescent patients infected by wild-type SARS-CoV-2.The weaker neutralizing

56

activity to S-G614 mutant pseudovirus has been shown. In two samples, neutralizing antibody

57

titers even quickly decrease from 1:99 or 1:122 to near the limit of detection. That might be a

58

warning about the possible loss of protective ability of convalescent plasma with lower titers to

59

SARS-CoV-2 S-G614 variant, like the reinfection case found in Hongkong5. Therefore, more

60

data about the longevity of humoral immunity are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of herd

61

immunity.

62

According to the current data, evaluation of the duration of humoral immunity response is limit.

63

Meanwhile, there are limitations to our study on the lack of correlation analysis between

64

clinical characteristics and specific antibody levels due to the small sample size, as well as on

65

the lack of data to evaluate anamnestic immune response.
