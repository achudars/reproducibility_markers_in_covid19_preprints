Abstract

9

As healthcare capacities in the US and Europe reach their limits due to a surge in the COVID-19

10

pandemic, both regions enter the 2020-2021 influenza season. Southern hemisphere countries

11

that had suppressed influenza seasons provide a hopeful example, but the lack of reduction in

12

influenza in the 2019-2020 influenza season and heterogeneity in nonpharmaceutical and

13

pharmaceutical interventions show that we cannot assume the same effect will occur globally.

14

The US and Europe must promote the implementation and continuation of these measures in

15

order to prevent additional burden to healthcare systems due to influenza.

Introduction

19

The COVID-19 pandemic has altered almost every aspect of public health since its global

20

spread in early 2020. The impacts of COVID-19 continue to unfold and one such consequence is

21

the effect of the pandemic on seasonal respiratory pathogens like influenza. The similarities

22

between the transmission pathways and clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza

23

lead to critical ecological, public health and clinical interactions (Solomon et al., 2020). As the

24

influenza season begins in temperate, northern hemisphere regions, there is a devastating surge

25

of COVID-19 in the US and Europe that is pushing healthcare capacity to its limits, leaving no

26

room for additional public health burden. On the other hand, reports of a curtailed 2019-2020 flu

27

season in the US and a suppressed 2020 flu season in southern hemisphere nations have provided

28

encouraging signs. With the competing forces of viral interactions, overlapping protective

29

behaviors and a single, limited healthcare capacity, it remains unclear what the upcoming winter

30

will bring for influenza.

31

To understand the impacts of COVID-19 on influenza, we first look retrospectively. By

32

the time SARS-CoV-2 transmission had become widespread in early 2020, the influenza season

33

in Europe was largely over (Boelle, 2020), but flu transmission in the US was still ongoing and

34

declined rapidly in March and April (CDC, 2020a). Some have proposed that the pandemic and

35

the ensuing nonpharmaceutical interventions led to this unexpected decrease in influenza

36

transmission (Olsen et al., 2020). However, the viral circulation in the 2019-2020 season and the

37

timing of nonpharmaceutical interventions make these impacts unclear.

38

Global case studies provide further evidence to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on

39

influenza transmission. The countries in the southern hemisphere, which typically experience

40

their influenza season in May-October, have reported drastically reduced influenza circulation in

41

2020 (Olsen et al., 2020). One possible explanation for this pattern is viral competition between

42

SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. This competition could occur through multiple mechanisms, such

43

as immune interactions, viral competition and a reduced susceptible pool due to isolation

44

(Nickbakhsh et al., 2019; Rohani et al., 2003). But the more likely explanation is the significant

45

behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions in place in these settings that are leading to this

46

dramatic effect on flu. Nonpharmaceutical interventions such as closures of non-essential

47

businesses, telework, restriction on gathering size, and mask-wearing have been key public

48

health tools for limiting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (Di Domenico et al., 2020; Haug

49

et al., 2020). Given the shared transmission route between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, the same

50

protective behaviors could greatly limit influenza transmission (Cowling et al., 2020). In fact, far

51

less mitigation effort is required to control a low R0 disease like flu (R0 = 1-2), compared with a

52

high R0 disease like COVID-19 (R0 = 2-5). Additionally, increased influenza vaccination is

53

another tool that could reduce influenza burden. Global case studies examining this data can

54

shine light on how these factors have impacted or will impact influenza transmission.

55

To further our retrospective and prospective understanding of influenza dynamics during

56

the COVID-19 pandemic, we consider case studies across geographic regions. We analyze

57

influenza data from the 2019-2020 season to identify whether COVID-19 significantly impacted

58

influenza transmission in the US. Then, we present global data on mobility and vaccination, for

59

countries that have already avoided an influenza season in the Southern hemisphere and

60

countries that are in the midst of the influenza season in the Northern hemisphere.

61

Methods

62

Intervention Analysis

63

We tested whether the 2019-2020 influenza A season was statistically different from

64

expectations based on influenza seasons of prior years. We separate influenza A from influenza

65

B as the influenza B dynamics in 2019-2020 were extremely unusual, mostly occurring early in

66

the season before COVID-19 was a factor in the US, and this obscures comparison of influenza

67

data with prior seasons (Figure S1). We obtained surveillance data from the CDC for the 2015-

68

2016 through the 2019-2020 influenza seasons (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

69

2020). We calculated the influenza A ILI rate as % positive influenza A * ILI / Total visits. This

70

accounts for influenza-like illness cases, healthcare seeking, and influenza A virus circulation.

71

We used intervention analysis as implemented in the CausalImpact R package to build an

72

expectation for the 2019-2020 influenza season, based on the 2015-2016, 2016-2017, 2017-2018,

73

and 2018-2019 seasons as control data (Brodersen et al., 2015). The date of the intervention was

74

March 16, 2020, which is the same week as the COVID-19 National Emergency Declaration in

75

the US. This means that the pre-intervention period was 10/7/2019-3/16/2020, and the post-

76

intervention period was 3/23/2020-7/1/2020. We compare the expected 2019-2020 influenza A

77

season to the actual 2019-2020 influenza A season. We also gathered mobility data from

78

Safegraph to evaluate mobility in this timeframe in the US, shown in Figure S2 (Safegraph,

79

2020).

80

Global intervention comparison

81

We gathered global mobility data from Google mobility reports (Google, 2020). This represents

82

the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 in reducing mobility. We

83

particularly evaluate mobility to retail and recreational locations compared to a pre-pandemic

84

baseline. We also gathered 2020 influenza vaccination data for uptake of influenza vaccination.

85

This was gathered from Reseau Sentinelles and IQVIA France, the CDC, and the Australian

86

Department of Health (CDC, 2020b; Hunt, 2020). As a case study, we compared Australia,

87

France, and the US, as they are westernized, large population countries with data available on

88

these two factors. Australia provides a retrospective example, as it experienced a suppressed

89

influenza season in May-October 2020. We also examined NPIs in other southern hemisphere

90

countries for support (Figure S3). France and the US provide prospective examples for

91

comparison.

93

The 2019-2020 influenza season in the US was not significantly impacted by COVID-19

94

When examining influenza A dynamics and controlling for healthcare seeking, the dynamics of

95

the 2019-2020 influenza season were not significantly different from what was expected after

96

March 16 based on the 4 prior influenza seasons. It is necessary to isolate influenza A from

97

influenza B because influenza B cases occurred much earlier and at a higher rate than previous

98

years (Figure S1). The high, early influenza B peak makes the 2019-2020 season appear to be

99

very severe early in the season. It also makes comparing the tail of the season misleading: in

100

typical years influenza B becomes more prevalent at the end of the season resulting in a more

101

gradual tail, and its early decrease in 2019-2020 makes the tail of the 2019-2020 season appear

102

to drop more drastically than typical years. Examining just influenza A dynamics reveals similar

103

dynamics to previous years. This is supported by evaluating mobility data in the US in early

104

2020 (Figure S2). This demonstrates that mobility did not deviate from previous years until

105

April, when the influenza season had ended.

106

Southern Hemisphere countries engaged in reduced mobility and increased vaccination

107

during the influenza season

108

Mobility to retail and recreational locations in Australia was at 30-45% below baseline at the

109

start of the influenza season (Figure 1B). Similar reduced mobility patterns at the start of the

110

influenza season were observed in Chile, Argentina, and South Africa (Figure S3). All of these

111

countries have reported diminished influenza seasons (Olsen et al., 2020; PAHO

112

PHE/IHM/Influenza Team, 2020). Additionally, Australia reported a 36% increase in influenza

113

vaccine distribution in 2020.

116

Participation of Northern Hemiphere countries in nonpharmaceutical interventions

117

remains variable during the early influenza season

118

Mobility to retail and recreational locations at the start of the 2020-2021 influenza season was at

119

35-40% below baseline. Additionally, vaccine purchase data shows that influenza vaccine

120

distribution was 13% higher in 2020 than in previous years. Mobility to retail and recreational

121

locations in the US at the start of the 2020-2021 influenza season was only slightly below

122

baseline values. Additionally, the US reports an 11% increase in influenza vaccine distribution.

123

However, stark heterogeneities exist both spatially and demographically. The US state of Iowa

124

estimates a decline in vaccination across populations, with a 24 percentage points decline in

125

vaccination in the 65+ age group (Iowa Department of Public Health, 2020). Additionally, it is

126

estimated that vaccination coverage among Black, non-Hispanic children in the US is down 11

127

percentage points from last year (CDC, 2020b).

128

Discussion

129

Our study does not seek to identify causal or correlative links between influenza and COVID-19

130

dynamics. Instead, we seek to synthesize various lines of evidence that allow for careful

131

consideration of this relationship in the future. We have considered case studies to explore the

132

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on influenza dynamics in northern and southern hemisphere

133

nations. We find that the 2019-2020 influenza season in the US was not significantly impacted

134

by COVID-19. We compare mobility and flu vaccine distribution data for Australia, France, and

135

the US. Australia provides an example of suppressed influenza epidemics, in which significantly

136

reduced decreased mobility and increased vaccine distribution was observed during the early part

137

of the influenza season. France appears to be similar to Australia, with reduced mobility and an

138

increase in influenza vaccination. The US, however, has mobility similar to pre-pandemic

139

baseline, and an increase in vaccination, with notable spatial and demographic heterogeneity.

140

Influenza surveillance in the US through November 30th shows lower rates of disease

141

compared to previous seasons (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020), and Europe

142

has reported only 5 sentinel-source positive specimens out of 8729 samples through December

143

6th (Figure S4, ECDC-WHO, 2020). Travel restrictions due to the pandemic may also limit the

144

introduction of influenza from other countries. This encouraging news must be balanced with

145

caution. Healthcare systems are stretched to capacity with current COVID-19 hospitalizations

146

topping 113,000 in the US and 140,000 in Europe, so we cannot afford additional burden from

147

influenza (which leads to hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations annually in the US and

148

Europe). Recent data also suggests that while the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was

149

68% lower among influenza cases, the risk of severe outcomes, such as ICU admission or death,

150

were many-fold higher for coinfection cases than for either infection alone (Stowe et al., 2020).

151

Thus, though current flu numbers are fortunate, continued diligence and public health messaging

152

will be necessary to continue to suppress influenza cases.

153

The lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic must be heeded to prevent further devastation.

154

We must sustain efforts towards social distancing and mask wearing, which have been

155

definitively linked to reductions in respiratory disease transmission. We must continue

156

vaccination administration efforts while accommodating social distancing requirements to

157

prevent exacerbation of health disparities. We must not let hopeful news of suppressed epidemics

158

deter from a path of action and vigilance.
