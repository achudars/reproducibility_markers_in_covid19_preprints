Abstract
Background: Since the pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the health
system capacity in highly endemic areas has been overwhelmed. Approaches to efficient management
are urgently needed. We aimed to develop and validate a score for early prediction of clinical
deterioration of COVID-19 patients.
Methods: In this retrospective multicenter cohort study, we included 1138 mild to moderate
COVID-19 patients admitted to 33 hospitals in Guangdong Province from December 27, 2019 to
March 4, 2020 (N =818; training cohort), as well as two hospitals in Hubei Province from January 21
to February 22, 2020 (N =320; validation cohort) in the analysis.
Results: The 14-day cumulative incidences of clinical deterioration were 7.9% and 12.1% in the
training and validation cohorts, respectively. An Early WArning Score (EWAS) (ranging from 0 to 4.5),
comprising of age, underlying chronic disease, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, and
D-dimer levels, was developed (AUROC: 0.857). By applying the EWAS, patients were categorized
into low-, medium-, and high risk groups (cut-off values: two and three). The 14-day cumulative
incidence of clinical deterioration in the low-risk group was 1.8%, which was significantly lower than
the incidence rates in the medium- (14.4%) and high-risk (40.9%) groups (P <.001). The predictability
of EWAS was similar in the validation cohort (AUROC =0.781), patients in the low-, medium-, and
high-risk groups had 14-day cumulative incidences of 2.6%, 10.0%, and 25.7%, respectively (P <.001).
Conclusion: The EWAS, which is based on five common parameters, can predict COVID-19-related
clinical deterioration and may be a useful tool for a rapid triage and establishing a COVID-19
hierarchical management system that will greatly focus clinical management and medical resources to
reduce mortality in highly endemic areas.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a new coronavirus to
which there is no pre-existing immunity in humans. The continued increase in the number of cases with
COVID-19 and the number of affected countries over time are of great concern. On February 28, 2020,
the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the international risk assessment for the COVID-19
outbreak from “high” to “very high” nearly a month after the novel coronavirus was declared a public
health emergency of international concern, which is the WHO’s highest level alarm.1 As of April 13,
2020, the global number of reported cases of COVID-19 has reached 1 773 084, with 83 597 cases in
China and 1 689 487 cases outside of China.2
Hubei Province was the center of the epidemic area in the early stage of the pandemic. As of April 13,
2020, 6 7803 confirmed cases with COVID-19 were reported in Hubei Province, 2 which accounted for
over 80% of the cases in China, and the case fatality rate in Hubei Province was five times greater than
in areas outside of Hubei Province.3 Moreover, approximately 26% of cases developed severe disease
in Hubei Province which accounted for 98% of the severe cases in China. Guangdong Province had the
second largest number of confirmed cases with COVID-19 in China outside of Hubei, with 1 564
reported cases as of April 13, 2020.2
Based on the clinical characteristics reported by patients with COVID-19, around 80% of the patients
were diagnosed with mild or moderate COVID-19 and a part of those will develop severe disease
rapidly.4,5 The median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately two weeks,
and it is three to six weeks for patients with severe or critical COVID-19.4 Previous studies found that
older patients with underlying chronic illnesses, such as hypertension and diabetes, are more likely to
develop severe pneumonia. 5-10 Moreover, it was reported that patients with severe pneumonia in

comparison to patients with mild pneumonia, frequently have elevated C-reactive protein (CRP),
decreased lymphocytes, and elevated D-dimer. 5-10 Preliminary data from the WHO suggest that the
time interval from onset of symptoms to the development of severe disease is one week.4 Thus,
efficient and timely management of patients with a high risk of developing severe COVID-19 is crucial
in the face of severe resource constraints. Currently, there are no effective prediction tools for the early
stratification of COVID-19 patients according to different risks of clinical deterioration. We therefore
conducted this study with the aim to develop and validate an early warning score for predicting the
clinical course of patients with COVID-19. We hypothesized that this score could be used as an
efficient and widely applicable evaluation tool to prioritize managing patients with a high risk of
developing severe to critical COVID-19 at an early stage.
Methods
Subjects and Data collection
This study was based on two datasets of Chinese patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 from 35
hospitals in two Chinese provinces. The inpatients from 33 hospitals in Guangdong Province were used
as the training dataset to derive a score in predicting clinical deterioration of COVID-19 within 14 days
after admission, whereas the inpatients from Wuhan Hankou Hospital (Wuhan, Hubei Province, China)
and Honghu People’s Hospital (Jingzhou, Hubei Province, China) were used for external validation of
the scoring system. All patients were diagnosed and treated according to the Chinese Guidance for
COVID-19.11 The data, including demographic characteristics, clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory
results, chest computer tomography (CT) scan images and clinical outcomes, were collected. The data
of patients in Guangdong Province were extracted from the information reporting system established
by the Health Commission of Guangdong Province. The data of patients in Hubei Province were

extracted from the hospital information system, nursing records, and laboratory reports of the
participating hospitals.
Definitions
According to the Chinese COVID-19 prevention and control program (7th edition),11 a confirmed case
was defined by the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in
respiratory specimens detected by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and/or
positive results of immunoglobulin [Ig] M or IgG to SARS-CoV-2 testing. Mild COVID-19 was
defined as having mild symptoms without radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Moderate COVID-19
was defined as having fever or respiratory symptoms with radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Severe
COVID-19 was defined as meeting one of the following criteria: 1) presence of shortness of breath
with a respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/minute; 2) an oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤ 93% in the resting state; 3)
hypoxemia defined as an arterial partial pressure of oxygen divided by the fraction of inspired oxygen
(PaO2/FiO2 ratio) ≤ 300 mmHg; or 4) evidence of radiographic progression, defined as a ≥ 50%
increase of target lesion within 24-48 hours. Critical COVID-19 was defined as meeting one of the
following criteria: 1) respiratory failure plus mechanical ventilation; 2) circulatory shock; or 3) a
combination of multiple organ failure plus the need for intensive care. In this study, clinical
deterioration was defined as meeting the criteria of severe or critical COVID-19 in patients with mild
or moderate COVID-19 at admission. The analysis time was the time interval between the date of
admission and the date of clinical deterioration or the end of follow-up in the absence of clinical
deterioration.
Statistical analysis
All data were entered into and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS version

20.0, Chicago, IL, USA) and R (Version 3.5.1). Data are expressed as counts and percentages for
categorical variables and as medians (interquartile ranges [IQRs]) for continuous variables. Qualitative
and quantitative differences between groups were analyzed using chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests for
categorical parameters and Mann-Whitney’s tests for continuous parameters, as appropriate. The
cumulative probabilities of clinical deterioration were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and
compared with the log-rank test. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression
models were used to estimate the effect of various variables on the hazard of clinical deterioration.
Hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) together with corresponding p values are
presented. A p value of <.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
The study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the
principles of International Committee of Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (ICH - GCP).

(NFEC-2020-026).
Results

Patient Characteristics at admission

During the study period, 1043 and 662 patients were admitted to the hospitals in Guangdong and Hubei
Provinces, respectively. After excluding patients with pre-existing severe to critical COVID-19 at
admission (N =158, 133), patients who had incomplete medical records or laboratory tests (N = 61,
199), and patients co-infected with other respiratory viruses (N = 6, 10), the final analysis included 818
and 320 patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 from Guangdong (training cohort) and Hubei
(validation cohort) Provinces, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1). Overall, 725 of 817 patients
(88.7%) from Guangdong and 306 of 311 (98.4%) patients from Hubei province had images consistent

with pneumonia on chest CT in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. In both cohorts,
patients who experienced clinical deterioration were older, had higher neutrophil counts, lower
lymphocyte counts, higher C-reactive protein levels, and higher D-dimer levels. Male patients and
those with underlying chronic conditions had a higher probability of experiencing clinical deterioration.
More patients with clinical deterioration received antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment (Table 1).

Risk factors for clinical deterioration

At a median follow-up of 18 days (IQR, 13 - 24 days), 24 patients experienced clinical deterioration
with 14-day cumulative incidence of 7.9% (95% CI, 6.0% -9.7%) in the training cohort. In the
univariable Cox regression analysis, sex, age, underlying chronic illness, days from onset of symptoms
to admission, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil to lymphocyte
ratio (NLR), CRP and D-dimer were associated with the 14-day incidence of clinical deterioration. By
multivariable Cox regression analysis (with stepwise selection), it was found that age (> 50 vs. ≤ 50
years) (hazard ratio [HR], 2.158; 95% CI, 1.136 - 4.097; P =.019), underlying chronic disease (Yes vs.
No) (HR, 2.631; 95% CI, 1.399 - 4.951; P =.003), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (> 5 vs. ≤ 5) (HR,
2.176; 95% CI, 1.128 - 4.199; P =.021), C-reactive protein (> 25 vs. ≤ 25 mg/L) (HR, 2.577; 95% CI,
1.358 - 4.889; P =.004), and D-dimer (> 0.8 vs.≤ 0.8 mg/L) (HR, 4.567; 95% CI, 2.605 - 8.008; P
<.001) were independently significant factors in predicting the 14-day risk of clinical deterioration
(Table 2).

Refining the early warning score
An Early WArning Score (EWAS) was developed using the above identified five significant variables,
for which the weights were defined as the quotient (rounded to nearest integer) of the corresponding

estimated coefficient from a multivariable Cox regression analysis divided by the smallest χ2
coefficient (Table 3). EWAS ranged from 0 to 4.5. The AUROC was 0.857 (95% CI, 0.807 - 0.907, p
<.001) in the training cohort. Using two and three as the cutoff values, among the 552 patients with
available scores, 338 (61.2%), 146 (26.4%) and 68 (12.3%) patients were in the low-, medium-, and
high-risk categories. The 14-day cumulative incidence rates of clinical deterioration were 1.8%, 14.4%,
and 40.9% in the three risk groups, respectively (p <.001). (Figure 1A) The cut-off value of two was
associated with 70.8% sensitivity and 96.9% negative predictive value (NPV). The cut-off value of
three resulted in 94.6% specificity and 39.7% positive predictive value (PPV) (Table 4). The calibration
plot for the 14-day probability of remaining free clinical deterioration was predicted well in the training
cohort (Figure 1C).
External validation of the early warning score
A total of 38 patients experienced clinical deterioration with a 14-day cumulative incidence of 12.1%
(95% CI, 8.4% - 15.8%) during a median follow-up of ten days (IQR, 7 - 14 days) in the validation
cohort. The AUROC of EWAS in the validation cohort was 0.781 (95% CI, 0.695 - 0.866, p <.001).
Among the 248 patients with evaluable scores in the validation cohort, 118 (47.6%), 51 (20.6%) and 79
(31.9%) of the patients were assigned to the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups, respectively. The
K-M curves also showed equally good discrimination among the three risk groups in the validation
cohort. The 14-day cumulative incidences of clinical deterioration were 2.6%, 10.0%, and 25.7% in the
low-, medium- and high-risk groups, respectively (P <.001) (Figure 1B). The cut-off value of two was
associated with 71.1% sensitivity and 94.2% NPV. The cut-off value of three resulted in 79.8%
specificity and 27.8% PPV (Table 4). The calibration plot of the model in the validation cohort is
depicted in Figure 1D.

Discussion
With the spread of the epidemic, an increasing number of studies describing the clinical characteristics
of COVID-19 have been reported. However, there is still lack of knowledge on many aspects of
COVID-19, such as clinical predictors manifestations of asymptomatic and mild cases who progress.
While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14%,
even among the young patients, develop severe disease.12 Thus, it is critical to better understand the
clinical features of COVID-19 and the risk of disease progression. To our knowledge, we describe here
the first validated score for predicting clinical deterioration of COVID-19 which was developed with
the dataset of COVID-19 patients from Guangdong Province and validated with the dataset of
COVID-19 patients from Hubei Province. Our findings show that the early-warning score can be useful
in the assessment of the 14-day risk of clinical deterioration in patients with mild to moderate
COVID-19 at admission. A major advantage of this score is that it is practical and easy to use in routine
clinical practice, based on patient’s age, history of chronic disease, NLR, CRP, and D-dimer. It can
therefore be widely applicable in many health care settings globally. Although there were several
differences in the characteristics of the patients in the training and validation datasets, this strengthens
the reliability of our score, which was shown to offer similar predictability in different patient
populations.
Age has been reported as an important independent predictor of disease progression in Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).13,14 Previous studies on
COVID-19 also revealed that the elderly are prone to have higher incidences of severe illness and
mortality. Our study confirms that increased age is also associated with disease progression in patients
with mild or moderate COVID-19. Presence of underlying chronic illness is a common risk factor for

progression in most diseases. The most common chronic diseases in our cohort were hypertension,
pre-existing cardiac conditions, chronic lung disease and diabetes, which had prevalence rates of 12.6%,
12.2%, 7.3% and 5.5% in the training cohort, respectively. These comorbidities are found to be
important risk factors in previously reported seriously ill or non-survival COVID-19 patients. In
addition, patients with these illnesses may receive angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor
treatments. These regimens increase the expression of ACE2, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2
and may contribute to disease progression.15,16
One of the reported early general manifestations in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is
lymphocytopenia in the presence of a normal WBC count and more prominent abnormalities in
lymphocyte counts are identified in patients with more severe pneumonia. In the present study, a
correlation between a higher neutrophil count and early deterioration was also observed. Hence, we
included the NLR in the multivariable regression analysis. Additionally, NLR is used as a predictor of
community acquired pneumonia (CAP), specifically in elderly patients.17-19 CRP is a common indicator
of the inflammatory response. Its prediction value of disease progression has been reported in MERS,
influenza-infected and CAP patients. 20-22 In our study, a CRP level higher than 25 mg/L at admission
may indicate an underlying secondary infection or an intense inflammatory response that may lead to
disease progression in the short term. Another factor, D-dimer, is associated with coagulation activation,
which has been previously been reported to be a common finding in COVID-19 patients who had
severe illness or died. Additionally, elevated D-dimer is one of the risk factors for the development of
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), progression from ARDS to death or early in-hospital
death in COVID-19 patients. 23,24 The possible mechanisms include ischemia and thrombosis caused by
systemic proinflammatory cytokine responses, which are reported to be mediators of atherosclerosis

directly contributing to plaque rupture through local inflammation. 25,26
Management decisions for the high-risk patients with COVID-19 must be made quickly and are often
based upon scant evidence. Under these pressing clinical circumstances, high quality and timely
evidence-based guidance becomes especially crucial. EWAS, with a high level of differentiating power,
can be regarded as such quality evidence in providing an efficient, feasible and practical approach to
establish a hierarchical management system of COVID-19 in highly endemic SARS-CoV-2 areas
where medical resources are extremely limited. Specifically, it is suggested that, by applying the EWAS,
patients classified in the low-risk group should be isolated and treated in "mobile cabin hospitals", an
isolation facility converted from sports stadiums, convention centers, etc. with structures easily
installed which can accommodate large numbers of patients. Patients in the medium-risk group should
be treated in the general wards, whereas patients in the high-risk group should be transferred to the
intensive care unit for more comprehensive treatment due to the high risk of clinical deterioration
within 14 days of admission being as high as approximately 40% in this group. It is predicted that this
approach would benefit a considerable number of patients with COVID-19 by directing the appropriate
level of medical resources according to the severity of the disease, thus reducing mortality and saving
valuable medical and socioeconomic resources.
Our study has several strengths, including the use of two independent cohorts with large sample sizes,
which increase the reliability of the results. Nonetheless, the study also has certain limitations. First, the
patients in the training cohort were enrolled from more than 30 hospitals in Guangdong Province, and
their disease status, exposure history, and treatment strategy were relatively heterogeneous; however,
this heterogeneity strengthens the reliability of our scoring methodology, which shows similar
predictive ability in different patient populations. Secondly, the EWAS was based on artificially defined

categorical variables, which may have led to the loss of detailed continuous data. However, the
categorical variables will be much simpler to apply and promote in highly endemic areas. Thirdly, the
patients in the two cohorts were all Chinese. Whether the study results are applicable to patients in
other Eastern or Western countries merits further investigation.
In conclusion, the early-warning score, which is based on patients’ age, underlying chronic disease,
NLR, CRP, and D-dimer, represents a reliable and simple scoring system for the prediction of clinical
deterioration of COVID-19 within 14 days after admission. It may be a useful and convenient tool for a
rapid triage and establishing a hierarchical management system of COVID-19 patients that will greatly
focus clinical management and medical resources to reduce mortality in highly endemic areas.
