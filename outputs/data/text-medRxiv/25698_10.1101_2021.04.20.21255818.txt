Abstract
Background
Calculations of disease burden of COVID-19 are used to allocate scarce resources and
historically have focused on mortality, with little attention to morbidity such as postviral ‘postCOVID,’ similar to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), which strikes 4 and 16% of male and
female survivors. This paper quantifies post-COVID disability burden and combines it with case
fatality to estimate total morbidity per COVID-19 case.

Methods
Healthy life years lost per COVID-19 case were computed as the sum of (incidence*disability
weight*remaining lifespan) for death and post-COVID (modeled as CFS) by sex and 10-year age
category. In addition to death, the main model considered lifelong mild, moderate or severe CFS;
Model 2, CFS which resolved in ten years; Model 3, no CFS but 10% risk of death 10 years later.

Results
In all models, acute mortality was only a small share of total morbidity. For lifelong moderate
CFS symptoms, healthy years lost per COVID-19 case ranged from 0.92 (male in his 30s) to
5.71 (girl under 10) and were 3.5 and 3.6 for the oldest females and males. At higher symptom
severities, young people and females bore larger shares of total morbidity; if symptoms were
persistent or survivors’ later mortality increased, young people of both sexes were at highest risk.

Conclusions
Compared to post-COVID, acute mortality contributes only a small share of total COVID-19
morbidity. Total burden falls heavily on the young, who are currently deprioritized for
preventive interventions such as vaccines. To fairly allocate scarce resources, decisionmakers
should consider all morbidity.

Background
Calculations of disease burden of COVID-19 are used to allocate scarce resources, and generally
focus on death and acute illness which are more common in the elderly1; thus older patients are
prioritized for interventions such as vaccination. Less attention is paid to ‘post-COVID’ or longterm morbidity which follows COVID-19 infection in 10% of cases, of which 80% are female2:
this translates to 16% of females and 4% of males.
Parallels have been drawn between post-COVID and chronic fatigue syndrome, CFS.2
Post-COVID and CFS are both postinfectious syndromes3 whose most common symptoms are
fatigue, muscle and body aches, and difficulty concentrating;2,4 they also both tend to strike
women. Significantly, although CFS has been known for decades it remains poorly understood
and medically neglected.2,5 Diagnosis, treatment and services are not easily accessible even to
severe cases; little specific treatment is available; and research is sparsely funded relative to the
disease burden.5 Much of this also is true for post-COVID, whose prevention should thus be a
public health priority.
In addition to CFS-type symptoms, many or most COVID-19 cases have clinical sequelae
such as damage to the heart6 and lungs,7 even in those whose symptoms were otherwise mild.
This damage may increase mortality risk years or decades later, but has not yet been included in
calculations of disease burden or even of mortality.
In this paper I establish a plausible range for total morbidity burden per COVID-19 case
that is attributable to CFS-type symptoms; to immediate death; and to delayed death. By doing so
I inform allocators of scarce resources and suggest avenues for future research.

Materials and Methods
Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) lost per COVID-19 case were computed for the
combination of death and post-COVID by sex and age using sex- and age-specific case fatality
rates (CFR)1 and estimated remaining lifespan from the US Social Security Administration.8 All
computations here show DALY lost rather than DALY remaining.
DALY lost = Σ incidencei * disability weighti * durationi
where death has a disability weight of 1.0.

Three models were run:
•

Model 1 treated post-COVID as CFS, with increased disability but no increase in
mortality. DALY were computed for mild, moderate, and severe CFS (disability weights
of 0.14, 0.45, and 0.76)9 and presented in a single chart along with those for death.

•

Model 2 also treated post-COVID as CFS, but assumed that symptoms resolved ten
years after the initial infection.

•

Model 3 ignored CFS-type symptoms entirely but assumed that 10% of COVID-19
survivors sustained damage to heart, lungs, or other vital systems which caused death an
average of ten years later.

We did not consider post-COVID symptoms which are not also CFS symptoms, such as
anosmia, since no published DALY estimates exist for these. However, once these weights
become available this issue can be resolved by multiplying together the disability weights:
DWpost-COVID = (DWCFS) *(DWNEW SYMPTOM)
For example, if the disability weight for anosmia was 0.90, and all post-COVID cases had it, the
disability weight for mild post-COVID would increase from 0.14 to 0.244.

Results
These figures show the breakdown of total DALY lost per COVID-19 case under different
scenarios for each sex. In models showing symptoms of varying severity, total DALY lost can be
read from the top of the colored bar corresponding to the chosen symptom severity.

Model 1: Persistent Symptoms
If symptoms persisted for life but mortality was not affected (Figure 1), then most morbidity was
in female survivors. Female morbidity had a U-shaped association with age, being higher in the
young and old (dominated by post-COVID and death, respectively); while male morbidity was Jshaped: dominated by mortality, mostly in the old.

Moderate Symptoms
If post-COVID was of moderate severity, each female COVID-19 case under age 10 lost 5.7
DALY, while those over 80 lost 3.5. These can be read from the top of the dark pink bar
corresponding to ‘moderate symptoms, female.’ 3% and 86% of these lost DALY were death,
while the remainder was disability. Female morbidity was lowest at 2.59 DALY per case (19%
death), at age 50-60. Male morbidity in the youngest was 1.5 DALY per case (12% death) it was
0.95 (35% death) at age 40-50, and 3.6 in the oldest (97% death.)

Mild Symptoms
Only if symptoms were mild did the oldest females had higher morbidity than the youngest. Girls
under 10 lost 1.9 DALY per case (9% death); this declined to 1.08 (21%) in those between 40
and 50, and rose to 3.2 (95%) in the oldest. Male morbidity did not exceed 1 DALY per case
until age 60, and then surpassed female to reach a maximum of 3.6. (99%)

Severe Symptoms
If post-COVID was severe, females had higher morbidity than males in every age group; and
female morbidity dropped near-linearly with age, from 9.5 (2% death) in the youngest to 3.9
(77%) in the oldest. Male morbidity remained dominated by mortality and showed only a slight
U-shaped association with age, from 2.4 DALY in the youngest (7% death) to 1-3 in middle age
(increasing from 5% death to 77%) and 3.7 (95% death) in the oldest.

Model 2: Symptoms Resolve
If post-COVID symptoms resolved after ten years (Figure 2), total DALY lost to disability were
age-invariant (0.224, 0.720, and 1.216 for mild, moderate and severe symptoms in females, and
0.056, 0.180, and 0.304 for males) until lifespan dropped below ten years. This was age 80 in
females and 70 in males. As a result morbidity was almost constant until age 40, when CFR
began to increase. Morbidity was about 0.5, 0.8, and 1.3 DALY per case for young females with
mild, moderate and severe symptoms (about 40%, 10%, and 5% death) and 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 for
young males (60, 30 and 20% death.)

Model 3: Increased Mortality
If 10% of post-COVID cases had symptoms that caused mortality an average of 10 years later,
then even if CFS-type symptoms were absent the situation for both sexes was similar to that for
females when CFS-type symptoms were severe. Average female cases under 10 in this scenario
lost 6.9 DALY, of which 3% were immediate death and 97% were delayed death. Males in this
age group lost 6.4 DALY, (3% immediate death). DALY loss for females after age 50 was nearly
constant, between 2.4 and 3.1 per case; for males this plateau was earlier (age 40+) and lower
(2.0 – 2.7.)

Discussion
This paper shows that under all but the most optimistic conditions, acute case fatality is likely to
contribute only a small share of total COVID-19 morbidity. In most models total burden fell
heavily on females and the young. Rather than focusing solely on mortality, allocators of scarce
resources should consider all sources of morbidity.
Rather than give a single estimate of the contribution of acute case fatality to total
COVID-19 morbidity, this paper provides a plausible range. It is likely that the truth will contain
elements of all three models: chronic CFS-type symptoms of varying severity which may
resolve, plus elevated mortality in those survivors or others. In determining which scenario is the
closest to the truth, researchers should establish post-COVID incidence, both overall and in
specific populations; its sex ratio; and its clinical course, which may include remission, death, or
some mix.
Estimates of post-COVID incidence vary, but most are higher than the 10% cited by
Rubin.2 A different paper10 found persistent symptoms in a third of outpatients, including some
whose initial infection was asymptomatic, up to nine months later; and others found persistent
symptoms in half, or more than half, of those who had been hospitalized. 7,11 If the true incidence
is found to be higher than 10% then the disability burden of post-COVID will increase,
equivalent to a worsening of symptoms under the present model; while if persistent symptoms
are more common in those with more severe illness, relative burden borne by the old (who tend
to have more severe illness) will increase, while that borne by the young (who are more often
asymptomatic) will decrease.

Secondly, our models used disability weights for CFS since none exist for post-COVID.
However post-COVID has symptoms that CFS does not, leading to systematic underestimation
of the true disability weight of post-COVID. For each additional symptom, the number of DALY
lost per case at a given symptom severity increases such that the situation becomes similar to that
for a higher symptom severity.
Thirdly, the shape of the post-COVID morbidity curve with age is sensitive to the clinical
course of the disease. Under most situations the curve was U-shaped (morbidity high in young
and old, lower in middle age) or L-shaped (morbidity highest in the young.) These were the
situations if post-COVID caused lifelong disability that was other than mild; increased mortality;
or both.
However, there was one model in which the mortality curve was J-shaped and burden of
morbidity was borne by the elderly (the situation assumed by current public-health guidelines.)
For this to occur, non-mild symptoms must be time-limited, resolving either spontaneously or
due to medical advances. For either of these to occur, post-COVID would have to be atypical of
postinfectious conditions such as CFS. Full recovery from these conditions is rare:5 most patients
experience fluctuating symptoms, with periods of low and high functioning,9,12 and some
deteriorate further. Furthermore ‘recovery’ is often defined relative to the disease state rather
than relative to fully restored health: even those reported as recovered often have persistent
disability.12 Thus while post-COVID patients may experience improvements in symptoms, it
seems likely that some disability will remain.
It is also possible that medical advances will improve the post-COVID prognosis.
However, this would require a significant change in current priorities: relative to its disease
burden CFS is deprioritized for research funding5 and although it has been documented for
almost a century, many patients have difficulty accessing diagnosis, treatment or services. The
same is true for post-COVID.4 Thus while it is not impossible that post-COVID will become
treatable, this scenario appears unlikely.
To conclude, these findings establish plausible outer bounds for the sex and age bias of
total disease burden of COVID-19. In most situations, most morbidity is in female survivors and
in young people. However, these estimates are imprecise and based on incomplete data. Future
research should collect and publish better data to allow fair distribution of resources for
