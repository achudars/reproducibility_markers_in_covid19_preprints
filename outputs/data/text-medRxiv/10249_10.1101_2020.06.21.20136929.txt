Abstract
Background: SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing a high mortality global pandemic.
However, the clinical spectrum of disease caused by this virus is broad, ranging from
asymptomatic infection to cytokine storm with organ failure and death. Risk
stratification of individuals with COVID-19 would be desirable for management,
prioritization for trial enrollment, and risk stratification. We sought to develop a
prediction rule for mortality due to COVID-19 in individuals with diagnosed infection
in Ontario, Canada.
Methods: Data from Ontario’s provincial iPHIS system were extracted for the period
from January 23 to May 15, 2020. Both logistic regression-based prediction rules,
and a rule derived using a Cox proportional hazards model, were developed in half the
study and validated in remaining patients. Sensitivity analyses were performed with
varying approaches to missing data.
Results: 21,922 COVID-19 cases were reported. Individuals assigned to the
derivation and validation sets were broadly similar. Age and comorbidities (notably
diabetes, renal disease and immune compromise) were strong predictors of mortality.
Four point-based prediction rules were derived (base case, smoking excluded as a
predictor, long-term care excluded as a predictor, and Cox model based). All rules
displayed excellent discrimination (AUC for all rules > 0.92 ) and calibration (both by
graphical inspection and P > 0.50 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test) in the derivation set. All
rules performed well in the validation set and were robust to random replacement of
missing variables, and to the assumption that missing variables indicated absence of
the comorbidity or characteristic in question.

Conclusions: We were able to use a public health case-management data system to
derive and internally validate four accurate, well-calibrated and robust clinical
prediction rules for COVID-19 mortality in Ontario, Canada. While these rules need
external validation, they may be a useful tool for clinical management, risk
stratification, and clinical trials.

Introduction
Since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization on
March 12, 2020 (1), the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has taken a fearsome toll on global
mortality. As of June 11, 2020, over 400,000 deaths worldwide have been attributed
to SARS-CoV-2, with many more excess deaths likely related either to infection with
the virus or disruption of health systems by epidemics (2). While most infections with
SARS-CoV-2 are mild or even asymptomatic, approximately 20% of recognized
infections are sufficiently severe to require hospitalization (3, 4). Among those
hospitalized, 10-20% have an intensive care requirement, usually related to
respiratory failure (3-5), though multiorgan system failure (6), clotting abnormalities
(7) and angioneogenesis (8) with resultant bleeding are increasingly recognized as
severe complications of COVID-19.
Numerous studies have identified clinical factors associated with requirements for
intensive care and death among those with COVID-19 infection (9-11). Published
prediction models to date have evaluated case-level factors that might predict care
diagnosis, more severe disease requiring hospitalization, and poor outcomes (critical
illness or death) (9). A recent review identified 16 prediction models focused on
prognosis; 14 were based on the COVID-19 epidemic in China and the other two used
aggregated public data from a variety of sources (9). The generalizability of these rules
to the North American context is unclear. Furthermore, few of these efforts included
conversion of prediction models into parsimonious, simple, score-based tools that can
be used easily for risk stratification in clinical settings. In the context of COVID-19, a
such rules might have important implications for risk-stratification of patients,
streamlining decisions around hospital care vs. self-isolation (12), and prioritizing

individuals for enrollment in clinical trials of emerging therapies (e.g., convalescent
plasma or antiviral drugs), as has been the case with similar tools developed for
community acquired pneumonia (13).
Ontario, Canada, had identified over 30,000 virologically confirmed cases of COVID-19
in the province as of June 11, 2020 (14). Each confirmed case is the subject of
epidemiological investigation by local public health authorities, who enter
epidemiological, clinical and outcome data into the Province’s Integrated Public Health
Information System (iPHIS). Our objective was to make use of iPHIS data to develop
and validate parsimonious, sensitive and specific prediction rules for infection-related
death in individuals with COVID-19 in Ontario.

Methods
Study population and data collection

Ontario is Canada’s most populous province, with a current population of 14.7
million (15) . The Province identified imported COVID-19 cases from China, and Iran,
in January and February 2020 (16); local epidemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been
evident since late February 2020 (17). Each of Ontario’s 34 public health units is
responsible for local case investigation and uploading of case information into the
iPHIS data system, which is used for surveillance and case management of notifiable
diseases in the Province (18). Ontario’s case definition for a confirmed case of requires
a positive laboratory test using a validated nucleic acid amplification test, including
real-time PCR and nucleic acid sequencing (19).
Information on patient characteristics – including age group (by 10-year
intervals), sex, medical comorbidities, long-term care residence, healthcare and
emergency service work, case symptoms, dates of symptom onset, testing and
reporting, hospitalization and intensive care admission, and mortality was collected for
cases. Approximately 80% of all deaths during the Ontario COVID-19 epidemic have
occurred in long term care facilities (20), and there has been little transfer of long-term
care residents to intensive care units (17).
Statistical analysis

We randomly assorted cases into derivation and validation sets. Characteristics
of the two sets are presented in Table 1. Univariable logistic regression was used to

identify factors associated with mortality in the derivation group. Continuous
variables were dichotomized to facilitate score generation and ease of application in
clinical settings. When a factor was found to be protective, the covariate evaluated
was absence of the factor, so that resultant odds ratios were > 1.
Risk factors significant at P < 0.2, or which were thought a priori to confer
important increases in risk (age and sex) were included in model building using a
forward stepwise selection algorithm, with covariates selected for P < 0.05, and
retained in the model for P < 0.15. We did not include interaction terms in efforts to
keep a final prediction rule as simple as possible. The final regression model was
transformed to a point-based rule, with each regression coefficient divided by half of
the smallest coefficient and rounded to the nearest integer to obtain weighted values.
Risk scores were calculated by summing the individual point values of all applicable
risk factors. Risk of death can then be approximated from a graph of model-predicted
probability versus calculated score (Figure 1) using the relation p = 1/(e-(I + CS)+1)
where S is the individual’s score, C is the prediction rule’s coefficient in a logit model
using score as a predictor of death, I is the intercept from the same model.

The discriminatory ability of the prediction rule in the derivation group was
quantified through the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC
AUC), with 95% confidence intervals estimated through 1000 bootstrap replicates.
Calibration was assessed visually and using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test for goodness
of fit, which evaluates expected and observed probabilities in population deciles (21).

Some analysts have expressed concern that failure to account for right
censoring in could lead to bias in COVID-19 clinical prediction rules (9). As such we
created a second prediction rule using Cox-proportional hazards analysis, by
identifying factors associated with increased hazard of death using the same selection
algorithm as applied to the logistic model described above. Log transformed hazard
ratios were converted to point scores using the approach described above.
Discriminative ability of the rule was evaluated using Harrell’s C-statistic after
constructing a Cox proportional hazards model with the score as the sole covariate in
both the derivation and validation sets. ROC analysis, and score calibration, were
performed by using the Cox-model-derived score as a predictor in a logistic model.
Smoking status emerged as a protective effect in our base case prediction
model; this is likely to be controversial with some users. Furthermore, it might be
argued that the known high mortality associated with COVID-19 in long term care
settings favors creation of a rule for non-long-term care residents. As such, we made
additional rules which excluded smoking status, and which excluded long-term care
residents, using the approach described above.
Sensitivity Analyses
In the base case, models were built using only observations from individuals
with complete data; we tested the robustness of our models by evaluating the
discriminative ability and calibration of rules in datasets in which missing fields were
replaced at random, and in datasets where an attribute was assumed not present if a
field was left blank (e.g., if an individual had no record of presence or absence cardiac
disease, they were assumed not to have cardiac disease). All analyses were performed

Results
Of 21,922 COVID-19 cases reported between January 23 and May 15, 2020,
57% were female, and 43% were aged > 59 years. The median time from symptom
onset to case reporting was 5 days (IQR 4 to 10 days). Fourteen percent of cases were
residents of long-term care facilities; 17% were healthcare workers. Thirteen percent
of cases were hospitalized; 2% had record of intubation and/or mechanical ventilation,
and case-fatality was 8%. Individuals assigned to the derivation and validation sets
were broadly similar, but were significantly more likely to be smokers, less likely to
have a history of chronic liver disease, and less likely to die (Table 1).
Derivation of the Prediction Rule
In univariable analyses, death was associated with a broad array of demographic
characteristics and comorbid conditions. No association was seen between risk of
death and mean neighborhood income or asthma which were not included in
subsequent model building (Table 2). As age was provided as ordinal, 10-year age
groupings (0 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 29, etc.) the age coefficient in models represents
increased risk per increase in (age/10). Using a forward selection algorithm, we
identified 7 independent predictors of death in the derivation group: age, long-term
care residence, a history of renal disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, and immune compromise, and non-smoking. (Table 3).
The point-based prediction rule was well-calibrated between quantiles of observed and
expected risk (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2=1.58; p=0. 0.90) in the derivation group and
discriminated extremely well between those who did and did not develop die (ROC AUC
in the derivation group=0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.96). The median score (interquartile

range) was 13 (6) for survivors and 25 (6) for those who died (p<0.001 by the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test). The rule displayed good calibration to outcomes in the validation set
(Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2=9.16; p=0.16), as well as excellent discrimination (AUC 0.92,
95% CI 0.89 to 0.94) (Figure 1 and Figure 2).
Alternate Prediction Rules
Three alternate rules (based on a Cox proportional hazards model, a logistic model
excluding smoking status, and a model with long-term care residents excluded) were
created. These models had excellent discrimination. We statistical found evidence for
poor calibration of the model that excluded long-term care residents in the validation
set (P = 0.04). The Harrell’s C-statistic for a Cox model including age, male sex,
diabetes, COPD, and immune compromise was 0.97 in the derivation set, and 0.96 in
the validation set. Other fit statistics, and c-statistics for AUC, as well as values of the
model intercept and smallest logit model coefficient (for calculation of death
probability) are presented in Table 3 and presented graphically in the Supplement.
Sensitivity Analyses
We re-evaluated all four prediction rules in datasets in which missing variables were
assumed to not be present, and in which missing variables were replaced randomly.
Discriminative ability remained good for both randomly replaced datasets (ROC curve
AUC 0.84-0.90 for missing observations replaced with zeroes; AUC 0.79-0.83 for
missing observations replaced randomly). The large number of observations in
datasets with all missings replaced (N = 21,922) resulted in statistically significant
differences between observed and expected mortality probabilities (P < 0.001 for all

of rules remained very good (Supplement).

Discussion
Accurate prediction of mortality from COVID-19 has a number of potential
applications, including rational decision making for hospital admission, prioritization
of high-risk individuals for inclusion in trials of novel therapeutic agents, and to
identify high risk individuals for policy purposes (e.g., to inform decisions around risks
and benefits of remote work). We demonstrate here that COVID-19 mortality in
identified cases can be predicted with remarkable accuracy based on the limited,
readily available demographic and chronic health information available in public
health line lists. The large number of COVID-19 cases that have occurred in Ontario
provided sufficient statistical power for both model derivation and validation without
resorting to bootstrap resampling. The discriminative ability of our rules (as reflected
in AUC > 0.9 in both derivation and validation sets) places them among the upper tier
of current COVID-19 prediction rules; the parsimoniousness of these rules and their
conversion to an easy-to-calculate point score allows easy incorporation into clinical
care.
While many of our predictors (age and comorbidities) could have been
anticipated based on established epidemiology of COVID-19 (22-24), some (e.g., nonsmoking as a predictor of mortality) are likely to be controversial, and it is for this
reason that we derived alternate rules that exclude non-smoking. Apparent protective
effects of smoking against COVID-19 acquisition (25) as well as under-representation
of smokers among COVID-19 patients have been noted by others (26). However, other
investigators have suggested higher risk of progression of COVID-19 in smokers(26,
27), and increased density of ACE-2 (a viral receptor) is present in the lungs of
smokers (28), suggesting that apparent protective effects might result from selection

bias (e.g., individuals predisposed to very mild COVID-19 infection as a result of young
age or good general health might be over-represented among those tested for COVID19 due to smoking-related health concerns like cough). Regardless, a non-causal
association with risk may still be useful for clinical prediction; if this association
reflects peculiarities of Ontario’s approach to COVID-19 testing we expect that it may
not be generalizable to other jurisdictions that test more widely.
Similarly, the strong effect of long-term care residence on mortality is
unsurprising, given the high fraction of long-term care deaths seen during the
Canadian COVID-19 epidemic to date (20). As such we created alternate rules that
exclude smoking and long-term care residence; these rules can be used in place of our
base case rule, as they have similar discriminative ability. Lastly, to avoid biases that
might be introduced by right-censoring (i.e., lack of mortality in individuals in the
study cohort as a result of insufficient follow up time) we derived an additional rule
using survival methods, which also performed well. There was substantial overlap
between all four prediction rules in included covariates: notably, age, diabetes, and
immune compromise were included in all four rules we derived, and renal or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease were included in 3 of four rules.
Our analysis had many limitations; the use of a public health record system not
explicitly designed as a research tool means that we lack laboratory and radiological
results that have been useful in other prediction models (23, 29). Furthermore,
missing data was a significant limitation of our dataset, although our models appeared
robust even with random replacement of predictors and outcomes that should bias
associations towards the null. In that sense, the ability to derive simple, accurate and
parsimonious rules, which perform well in split-halves validation, despite limitations

in our dataset, may suggest generalizability of application outside Ontario. We hope
that other groups will evaluate our rules in other settings.
In summary, we developed and internally validated a prediction rule for COVID19 mortality using a large and detailed public health line list in the Canadian province
of Ontario. The rule was well calibrated and discriminated well and was robust in
sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of missing information on predictor variables.
If externally validated, this rule might facilitate decision making during future
epidemic waves.

Supplement: Derivation and Validation of Clinical Prediction Rule for COVID-19
Mortality in Ontario, Canada
1. Cox-model derived prediction rule.
As noted in the text, we used a Cox proportional hazards model to derive point scores
for a prediction score. The use of Cox models was intended to avoid bias that might be
introduced as a result of incomplete follow up and right censoring. Point scores were
derived based on log-hazard ratios. The scores, and values for I and C necessary to
predict mortality probability are presented in Table 3. The score itself was then
evaluated as a single covariate in a logit model predicting mortality. Model calibration
in derivation (top panel) and validation (bottom panel) sets are presented in Figure S1
below. Figure S2 presents the ROC curves for the derivation (top panel) and validation

2. Logit model-derived prediction rule with smoking excluded.
We anticipated that a prediction rule incorporating non-smoking as a risk factor for
mortality would be controversial. As such, we created an alternate rule with nonsmoking excluded. Again, rule-based scores, and values for I and C necessary to
predict mortality probability are presented in Table 3. As above model calibration in
derivation (top panel) and validation (bottom panel) sets are presented in Figure S3

3. Logit model-derived prediction rule with long-term care residents excluded.
The extremely high mortality in the long-term care setting might make a prediction
rule unhelpful. As such, we created an alternate rule with long-term care residents
excluded. Again, rule-based scores, and values for I and C necessary to predict
mortality probability are presented in Table 3. As above model calibration in
derivation (top panel) and validation (bottom panel) sets are presented in Figure S5

4. Sensitivity Analyses with Replacement of Missing Data
The iPHIS dataset was limited by substantial data missingness. To assess the
robustness of our rules, we replaced missing variables in two ways: first, by assuming
that missingness (for covariates or death) indicated that they were not present or did
not occur (i.e., replaced missing values as zero); and second, by assuming that
variables were missing completely at random, and replacing missing values randomly
based on their frequency of observation among non-missings. The latter approach
had the effect of substantially increasing the number of deaths available in the
dataset. Notwithstanding the likely introduction of misclassification via both of these
approaches, model calibration (based on visual inspection) and discrimination
remained very good. Calibration (left sided panels) and discrimination (right sided
panels) are presented graphically for all four prediction rules with missing values
replaced as zeroes (Figure S7) and missing values replaced at random (Figure S8).
