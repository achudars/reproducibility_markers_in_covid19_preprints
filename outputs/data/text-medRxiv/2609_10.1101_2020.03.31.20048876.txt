Abstract

21
22

The Japanese government instituted countermeasures against COVID-19, a pneumonia caused

23

by the new coronavirus, in January 2020. Seeking “people’s behavioral changes,” in which the

24

government called on the public to take precautionary measures or exercise self-restraint, was

25

one of the important strategies. The purpose of this study is to investigate how and from when

26

Japanese citizens have changed their precautionary behavior under these circumstances, where

27

the government has only requested their cooperation. This study uses micro data from a

28

cross-sectional survey conducted on an online platform of an online research company, based on

29

quota sampling that is representative of the Japanese population. By the end of March 2020, we

30

had recruited a total of 11,342 respondents, aged from 20 to 64 years. About 85% reported

31

practising the social distancing recommended by the government. More females than males and

32

more older than younger participants are supportive of practicing social distancing. Frequent

33

handwashing is conducted by 86 percent of all, 92 percent of female and 87.9 percent of

34

over-40 participants. The most important event influencing these precautionary actions was the

35

infection aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which occurred in early February 2020

36

(23%). Information from the central and local governments, received by 60% of the participants,

37

was deemed trustworthy by 50%. However, the results also showed that about 20% of the

38

participants were reluctant to implement proper prevention measures. The statistical analysis

indicated that the typical characteristics of those people were male, younger (under 30 years

40

old), unmarried, from lower-income households, with a drinking or smoking habit and a higher

41

extraversion score. To prevent the spread of infection in Japan, it is imperative to address these

42

individuals and encourage their behavioral changes using various means to reach and influence

43

them.

Introduction

47
48

The new coronavirus in Japan

49

Pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in China and first officially reported on 31

50

December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced a name for the new

51

coronavirus disease, COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), on 11 February 2020.[1] Since then,

52

COVID-19 has been spreading throughout the world, and a rapid increase in deaths has been

53

reported in many countries. As of 28 March, a total of 571,678 cases and 26,494 deaths have

54

been confirmed.[2] One study has estimated that there will be a total of 81,114 deaths from

55

COVID-19 over the next four months in the US alone.[3] The number of COVID-19 cases and

56

deaths in Japan is gradually increasing, with 1,499 cases (including 60 critical cases) and 49

57

deaths reported as of 28 March.[4] Several small clusters of infected groups have been increasing

58

in urban areas, including those in hospitals and nursing homes, in addition to cases with

59

unlinked infections. Nevertheless, the total number of deaths and severely ill patients has been

60

comparatively small, especially relative to the country’s population size, and the trend of the

61

increase is not sharp. The reasons for this mild trend have been questioned outside Japan.[5]

62

Over the past few decades, Japan has not experienced any serious damage from new

63

infectious diseases, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS (Middle East

64

respiratory syndrome) or the Ebola virus. Ironically, this history of escapes might delay the

65

establishment of the emergency operation headquarters in Japan. The implementation of

66

polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which must be the frontline response to the novel

67

coronavirus outbreak, has faced time-consuming obstacles. In Japan, a recent revision of the Act

68

on Special Measures for Pandemic Influenza and New Infectious Diseases Preparedness and

69

Response allows the Prime Minister to declare a state of emergency for the outbreak, but under

70

the current legislation, no central or local government can enforce lockdowns such as those

71

undertaken in other countries. If the Act on the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical

72

Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases is revised for COVID-19, local governors can restrict

73

or block the traffic in contaminated places for a specified period of not more than 72 hours for

74

the purpose of preventing the spread of the coronavirus.

75

Under such limitations, the current goal of the Japanese government is to avoid an

76

explosive increase in patients that would exceed the limit of intensive or critical care units in

77

hospitals in urban areas. To meet this goal, the government policy consists of three strategies:

78

early detection of clusters and rapid response, enhancement of the early diagnosis of patients

79

and intensive care for severely affected patients, and strengthening of the universal healthcare

80

system and people’s behavioral change.[6]

82

Three strategies against COVID-19

83

With regards to the first and second strategies, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare

84

(MHLW) strongly promotes contact tracing, social distancing and pneumonia surveillance under

85

the direction of the Patient Cluster Countermeasure Group in the MHLW Headquarters for

86

Novel Coronavirus Disease Control. Regional public health centers conduct contact tracing,

87

asking infected persons and their close contacts to maintain social distancing for 14 days and

88

allocating available hospital beds or hospital wards in designated local communities. In clinical

89

settings, the large number of computed tomography (CT) scanners in Japan (111.49 per million

90

population[7]) supports physicians with investigating suspicious pneumonia cases in the absence

91

of conducting massive PCR tests in the population. This policy approach might lead to a

92

relatively slower increase in the number of cases and deaths.

93

Regarding the third strategy, people’s behavioral change, by the middle of February 2020,

94

the MHLW encouraged the Japanese public to practise frequent handwashing and “coughing

95

etiquette” (using a handkerchief or sleeve instead of hands to catch a cough or sneeze).

96

Furthermore, the MHLW has prioritized access to healthcare for elderly people, people suffering

97

from fatigue or shortness of breath and people with underlying health conditions. The MHLW

98

has also asked the public not to visit clinics for at least four days if they have experienced cold

99

symptoms or a fever of 37.5°C or over.[8] This restriction might be a shock to Japanese citizens,

100

who are typically allowed to freely access clinics and hospitals.

101

In analyses of contact tracing, it was found that one infected person tended to infect more

102

than one other person at locations with certain characteristics. On 24 February, the Expert

103

Meeting on the Control of Novel Coronavirus Infection asked the public to refrain from

104

attending places involving close face-to-face contact (within an arm’s length of each other) in

105

conversations and similar interactions for more than a given length of time in crowds. Since

106

then but prior to other similar slogans that have appeared in the world, the government has been

107

campaigning for avoidance of these situations with the slogan “Avoid overlapping three Ms”

108

mippei-kukan [poorly ventilated closed space], misshu-basho [large gathering] and

109

missetsu-bamen [conversations or shouting in close proximity], in addition to regular ventilation

110

and wiping of shared surfaces (door handles, knobs, and bed fences) and goods with diluted

111

household chlorine bleach. “Avoid overlapping three Ms” has been the core and unique message

112

against COVID-19 in Japan.

113
114

Previous studies and our research questions

115

This study examines three research questions: 1) How do Japanese citizens implement the

116

government’s three Ms precautionary measures? 2) How effective are these requests from the

117

government? and 3) Who has changed their daily precautionary behavior and who has not?

118

Several previous studies have investigated changes in people’s precautionary behavior

119

against the coronavirus. For example, an online survey conducted on 29 January of 3,083

120

mainland Chinese respondents revealed that adults living in urban areas had a better awareness

121

of the issue than those in rural areas (72.7% vs. 66.1%, p<0.001).[9] Another online survey

122

conducted between 23 February and 2 March in the US (N=2,986) and the UK (N=2,988) adult

123

residents showed that people have a good understanding of the main mode of disease

124

transmission and common symptoms, although they also have several important misconceptions

125

and discriminatory attitudes towards people with East Asian ethnicity due to COVID-19’s origin

126

in China.[10] The latest study in Italy clarified the three types of attitude to COVID-19 among

127

Italian citizens: people who trust authority and choose isolation, fatalists who are keen on social

128

media and uniformed youth. [11] The Gallup International Association also recently conducted a

129

snap poll in 28 countries (including 1,115 Japanese participants), asking about precautionary

130

procedures, and their findings indicated that 71 percent of Japanese participants had adopted

131

more frequent handwashing.[12] It is still unclear, however, what the trigger is for behavioral

132

change around COVID-19 and who is more actively implementing the prevention measures. In

133

this survey, the response period and sample attribution are also unclear. Furthermore, this survey

134

is not necessarily informative for policymaking, as it does not reveal who is not implementing

135

prevention measures.

136

Using a large sample of cross-sectional survey data, this study investigates how and at what

137

point Japanese citizens changed their precautionary behavior in this situation, where the

138

government has only requested, rather than mandated, their cooperation.

Survey design and participants

143

This study uses micro data from a cross-sectional survey conducted via an online

144

platform of an online research company, MACROMILL INC, Japan. From a pool of

145

approximately 1.2 million registered individuals residing in Japan, we recruited a total of 11,342

146

males and females aged from 20 to 64 years. In the recruitment process for this study, quota

147

sampling was conducted so that the sample distributions among gender (male or female), age

148

group (20s, 30s, 40s, 50s or 60s), and employment status (regular employee, non-regular

149

employee, self-employed or not working) became equal to those of the representative Japanese

150

population, based on the statistics of the Labor Force Survey (Ministry of Internal Affairs and

151

Communications). The survey was conducted between 26 and 28 March 2020.

155

answer 11 items rating their prevention measures against novel coronavirus infections, such as

156

social distancing and coughing etiquette on a scale of 1 to 5. Thus, after summarizing

157

demographic characteristics based on the total, male and female, and under-40 and over-40

158

categories, we aggregate and compare a proportion of the participants who have been taking

159

those prevention measures.

160

The participants were also asked what kind of events caused them to change their

161

behaviors and rated the frequency and reliability of 10 information sources about the

162

coronavirus on a scale of 1 to 5. Thus, we calculate and compare the frequency and reliability

163

depending on the information sources.

164

Next, to detect factors associated with behavioral change, the participants were also

165

asked about their drinking and smoking habits. Personality traits were measured by the Five

166

Factor Personality Questionnaire: Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI). We estimate a logit

167

model, where the dependent variable is a dummy indicating 1 if the participant chose “not at all”

168

or “not true” to the question “Do you avoid the three overlapping Ms?” and where independent

169

variables are individual characteristics.

Ethical issues

176

Our survey falls outside the scope of the Japanese government’s Ethical Guidelines for

177

Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects, and there are no national guidelines in

178

Japan for social and behavioral research. Therefore, our study was carried out in accordance

179

with the Ethical Principles for Sociological Research of the Japan Sociological Society, which

180

do not require ethical reviews.

181

All survey participants gave consent to participate in the anonymous online survey by

182

MACROMILL INC. The authors did not obtain any personal information about the participants.

183

After being informed about the purposes of the study and their right to quit the survey,

184

participants agreed to participate. They were provided with the option of “I don’t want to

185

respond” for all questions. Completion of the entire questionnaire was considered as participant

186

consent.

11,342, with almost equal gender distribution. Gender and age distribution are proportional to

194

that of the Japanese population. University or college graduates constituted about 50–60 percent

195

of respondents. About half of the total sample is composed of regular employees (usually,

To what extent have prevention measures been taken?

206

In the survey, the participants were first asked to answer to the question “Have you

207

ever conducted any measures to prevent novel coronavirus infections or outbreaks?” About 76

208

percent of participants evaluated themselves as having taken some action.

209

To observe the details of those actions, Table 2 shows a variety of prevention measures

210

taken, aggregating a proportion of the participants who answer “very true” and “true” for each

Looking at the first four prevention measures, which have been continuously

219

requested by the Japanese government and the Expert Meeting on Control of Novel Coronavirus

220

Infection, it was found that 80 percent have attempted to avoid the “overlapping three Ms.” Of

221

the total, 57% have attempted avoid conversations or shouting in close proximity, which was a

222

relatively low figure among the three Ms. Looking next at the fifth prevention measure, more

223

than 85 percent of all participants reported practising social distancing by avoiding mass

gatherings. Regarding gender and age differences, more females than males and more older than

225

younger participants are supportive of social distancing, as shown by the differences in the

226

confidence intervals.

227

Regarding hygiene practices, frequent handwashing is conducted by about 86 percent

228

of all, about 91 percent of female and about 88 percent of over-40 participants. Coughing

229

etiquette was implemented by 77 percent of the participants. Many also answered that they have

230

avoided going out when ill with a cold.

231

As for the measures to strengthen individual immunity, around 70 percent of the

232

participants reported getting sufficient rest and sleep or eating a nutritious diet. Again, focusing

233

on gender and age differences, prevention measures are conducted more often by females and

234

older people.

235
236

However, regardless of gender and age, about 40 percent of participants have prepared
consultation and transportation methods for if they were to become ill.

237
238

What has caused the behavioral changes?

239

To explore the triggers of the behavioral changes and preparedness observed above,

240

the participants were asked “What was the most important event influencing these actions?”; the

241

responses are summarized in Fig 1. The figure shows that about 23 percent of the participants

cited the infection aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship

243

February 2020, when there were still few domestic cases. Diamond Princess is a

244

British-registered cruise ship on which an 80-year-old passenger from Hong Kong tested

245

positive for COVID-19 on 1 February 2020. Because the ship was in Japanese waters, the ship

246

was quarantined in February 2020 for nearly a month with about 3,700 passengers and crew on

247

board. Other participants noted events from the end of February, including the alert from the

248

Expert Meeting (5.6 percent), the statement of emergency by the governor of Hokkaido

249

(northern island of Japan) (7.4 percent) and the request by the Prime Minister to not attend mass

250

gatherings (7.8 percent). The next large trigger was the request by the Prime Minister for

251

nationwide school closures in Japan on 28 February 2020 (about 14 percent). Finally, worldwide

252

outbreak around early March (22 percent) also attracted participants’ attention.

that occurred around early

253

To explore what kind of information affected their behavioral change and

254

preparedness, the survey asked participants to report the frequency at which they consult certain

255

sources about the novel coronavirus infection and rate their reliability of the information source.

256

The results are summarized in Table 3.

Table 3 shows that almost 90 percent receive information from TV news programs and

264

Internet news sites, and that about 50 percent trust such information. Mainstream scientists are

265

annoyed about the fear-mongering that happens on TV talk and variety shows; indeed, these

266

formats are slightly favored, but considered less credible, among the public. Meanwhile,

267

information from the central and local government (received by 60 percent), including the

268

Prime Minister and the Expert Meeting, is relatively trusted by the participants (50 percent).

269

Among official sources, the local government is most trusted. Newspapers (national and local)

270

are read by only about 42 percent of the participants, and about 48 percent answered that they

271

trust information from newspapers.

272

Looking at the differences in gender and age, females tend to seek more information

273

and trust it more than males, except for the information from newspapers. Participants over 40

274

years old tend to access and trust the information from TV, newspapers and officials more than

275

those under 40 years old do, while young people often seek and trust news from the Internet and

276

SNS apps.

Who does not adhere to social distancing?

280

implementing social distancing measures and most Japanese citizens seem to be exhibiting

281

some behavioral change to prevent coronavirus infections. However, this also means that about

282

20 percent may not be conducting sufficient prevention measures.

283

To detect what kind of individuals are included in the group not conducting prevention

284

measure, Table 4 shows the estimation results of the logit model. Like the other tables, Table 4

285

shows the results based on the total, male and female, and under-40 and over-40 categories. The

286

number shown in the table is an odds ratio, so the estimates that are significantly higher than 1

287

indicate a higher tendency to not conduct proper social distancing.

Looking at the estimation results in Table 4, males, people in their 20s and unmarried

293

people exhibit significantly higher odds ratios, indicating that these groups tend not to conduct

294

preventive social distancing. Although work status is not generally associated with this

295

prevention measure, females, regular employees and non-regular employees tended to exhibit

296

higher odds ratios than self-employed or unemployed people.

297
298

Regarding household annual income, the lowest group (less than 2,000K JPY) has
significantly higher odds ratio for the total, female and under-40 categories.

299

Higher odds ratios for not conducting social distancing are associated with drinking

300

for males and smoking for females. Furthermore, those with higher extraversion scores also

301

tend to exhibit significantly higher odds ratio in many cases, while conscientiousness and

302

agreeableness are associated with lower odds ratio in most cases.

303
304

Should the government change its policy on mass gatherings?

305

Before this survey was conducted, the request by the Japanese government for

306

self-restraint in avoiding mass gatherings had become an issue. For example, on 22 March 2020,

307

the K-1 Grand Prix, a martial arts event, was held despite the Minister’s and local governor’s pleas

308

for restraint, and 6,500 participants were packed into the Saitama Super Arena. On 23 March, more

309

than 50,000 gathered in Sendai to see the Olympic flame, which had recently arrived from

310

Greece.[14] We asked the participants whether they supported this policy approach. About 29

311

percent of participants supported the idea that the government should now allow mass

312

gatherings. Males tend to support allowing mass gatherings more than females. On the other

313

hand, 65 percent supported government limitations of movement, in addition to self-restraint to

314

avoid mass gatherings in order to shorten the period of the pandemic. There are no significant

315

differences in gender and age category for this question.

Discussion

322
323

Under circumstances where there is no enforced ban on mass gathering or travelling

324

beyond the home region, our findings indicate that a large portion of Japanese citizens seem to

325

be implementing proper prevention measures on their own.

326

First, more than three-quarters of the survey participants have taken some preventive

23

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20048876; this version posted April 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

327

actions, including social distancing, handwashing, coughing etiquette and strengthening

328

immunity. Because the previous empirical studies did not include developed countries like

329

Japan, [15] there is little scientific evidence that Japanese people prefer cleanliness and tend to

330

wash their hands relatively more frequently than other countries. In Japanese communities,

331

water facilities for handwashing with soap and hand sanitizers are normally placed various

332

public places, such as train stations and supermarkets. Moreover, handwashing became part of

333

regular practice at home and school through post-war education.[16] In general, Japanese people

334

have developed the discipline of washing their hands before having meals or after using the

335

toilet. It is also well known that Japanese bow for greetings instead of handshaking, kissing and

336

hugging. This cultural behavior implies that the frequency of body contact among Japanese

337

people may be less than for those who greet with handshaking, kissing and hugging. During hay

338

fever season, Japanese citizens regularly wear surgical-style masks for prevention; it may be

339

that wearing a mask was a less popular preventive measure than some of the others in this study

340

due to there being a shortage of these products. These already habitual practices might help

341

behavioral changes develop among Japanese citizens during these unusual times.

342

In the survey, more than half of the participants had not prepared access to

343

consultation centers or transportation methods for if they were to become ill, implying that they

344

had not planned for the possibility of contracting COVID-19. We must advise the public to

24

345

prepare for such an event, to talk to family and close friends about unexpected advanced care

346

planning, and to imagine not being able to use ventilators or extracorporeal membrane

347

oxygenation at the severe stage.

348

Second, one of the main motivations for people’s behavioral changes was the infection

349

aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in early February 2020. At that time, only a few cases

350

of domestic infection had been reported in Japan, but news of the quarantine and positive test

351

results among the passengers was broadcasted daily. This may have contributed to Japanese

352

citizens changing their mindset and behavior toward precautionary measures earlier than in

353

Europe and the US. The sudden request by the Prime Minister for nationwide school closures in

354

the end of February might also have been an effective measure for changing the mindsets of

355

Japanese citizens toward prevention, even though this move was scientifically questioned and

356

confusing to the public, especially to single parents and double-income households.

357

Third, information from the Expert Meeting and central/local governments, including

358

the Prime Minister, are relatively trusted by survey participants. The Expert Meeting and

359

central/local government have held frequent press conferences, trying to clarify the tentative

360

scientific risks and advocating for citizens to conduct prevention measures. Such crisis

361

communication attempts may have caused behavioral changes in Japanese citizens. The most

362

trusted resource in this study was information from the local government, which was a hopeful

25

363

result, considering that the countermeasures against the virus are decided and conducted by the

364

local government. It is also important to support residents with disadvantages to information

365

and communication in the local communities.

366

However, the results also show that about 20 percent of the participants are reluctant

367

to implement proper prevention measures. The statistical analysis indicates that typically those

368

people are male, younger (under 30 years old), unmarried, are in lower income household, have

369

a drinking or smoking habit and have a higher extraversion score. To prevent the spread of

370

infection in Japan, it is imperative to address these individuals and encourage their behavioral

371

change in various ways that will reach and move them. It is notable that approximately 65

372

percent of the participants support stricter countermeasures, such as limitation of movement. As

373

we mentioned in the introduction, as of yet, the government has not made stay-at-home orders

374

mandatory and it has not offered financial aid to those affected by such measures. The current

375

requests from central/local governments are not legally binding and people/businesses have to

376

arrange financial compensation independent of the government. We should observe how

377

effective these measures are in Japan over the long term.

378

There are several limitations to this study. First, the data were self-reported, and

379

participants’ actual behaviors have not been observed. Second, the sample was not collected

380

based on random sampling. Quota sampling ensured a similar distribution to the Japanese

381

population among demographic groups (gender, age and work status), but the sample within

382

each group does not necessarily reflect the population. Third, we obtained this dataset at the end

383

of March 2020, when the infection is not explosively widespread in Japan. This study should be

384

reanalyzed after the COVID-19 pandemic comes to an end.
