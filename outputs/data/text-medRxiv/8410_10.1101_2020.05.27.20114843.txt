Abstract

14

The clinical condition COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, was declared a pandemic by the

15

WHO in March 2020. Currently, there are more than 5 million cases worldwide, and the

16

pandemic has increased exponentially in many countries, with different incidences and death

17

rates among regions/ethnicities and, intriguingly, between sexes. In addition to the many factors

18

that can influence these discrepancies, we suggest a biological aspect, the genetic variation at the

19

viral S protein receptor in human cells, ACE2 (angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2), which may

20

contribute to the worse clinical outcome in males and in some regions worldwide. We performed

21

exomics analysis in native and admixed South American populations, and we also conducted in

22

silico genomics databank investigations in populations from other continents. Interestingly, at

23

least ten polymorphisms in coding, noncoding and regulatory sites were found that can shed light

24

on this issue and offer a plausible biological explanation for these epidemiological differences. In

25

conclusion, ACE2 polymorphisms should influence epidemiological discrepancies observed

26

among ancestry and, moreover, between sexes.

Introduction

28

At the end of 2019, a new outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 (a coronavirus) started in

29

Hubei Province, China. The clinical condition, COVID-19, probably arose from natural selection

30

in bat reservoirs [1]. There are currently more than five million cases worldwide, and the

31

pandemic has been increasing exponentially in many countries since the disease was deemed a

32

pandemic by WHO in March 2020 [2].

33

The lethality rate is influenced by the speed of contagion, idiosyncrasies of the affected

34

populations according to the containment policies adopted, socioeconomic conditions and the

35

absorption limit of the health system [3]. Due to the high rate of transmission of the virus by air

36

and the novelty of the infection to humans, the disease has become a global emergency problem,

37

forcing periods of social confinement to contain the pandemic, in addition to hygiene habits [4].

38

Epidemiological data show a tendency towards slightly greater contamination in men;

39

however, male mortality is significantly higher [5], representing an increase from 20% to 70% in

40

European countries, approximately 65% in some Asian countries, and, even more peculiarly,

41

Dominican Republic citizens showed three times more deaths in men than women [6,2,7], even

42

considering factors related to behavioral issues. Certainly, there are biological aspects that

43

contribute to this more adverse clinical condition.

44

Studies indicate that cell–virus interaction is mediated by the connection of the

45

transmembrane glycoprotein spike (S), present in the form of homotrimers on the viral surface, to

46

angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, also called hACE2), which is responsible primarily

47

for inducing vasodilation [8].

48

The level and expression pattern of ACE2 in different tissues and cells can be critical to

49

the susceptibility and symptoms resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection [9]. Zhou and

50

collaborators [10], using scRNA-seq datasets, classified organs vulnerable to infection as high

51

and low risk based on their expression levels of ACE2. At the clinical level, the symptoms of

52

COVID-19 may be related to the entry and affinity of the virus in these organs, as observed in

53

heart failure disease and increased ACE2 expression, in which viral infection is related to a

54

higher risk of heart attack and worse ill condition [11]. For Li and collaborators [12], ACE2

55

genetic variations could be crucial to the susceptibility in different cohorts and to clinical

56

outcomes of COVID-19.

57

Currently, investigations of potential genetic variations that may favor or hinder

58

interactions between the virus and the host have been conducted [13,14,15], showing a high

59

number of codons that can, if altered, interfere with the complexity of the virus–cell interaction.

60

It is noteworthy that the ACE2 is located on the X chromosome, causing the impossibility of

61

heterozygosity in men. Therefore, polymorphisms in their single copy could be related to the

62

worst outcomes observed in males [16].

63

Considering the above, we sought explanations for an intrinsic factor that differed

64

between sexes and populations that may justify the differences observed in the incidence and

65

lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the different regions of the world, as well as between

66

sexes. We analyzed global data in the 1000 Genomes Database and, in addition, we conducted

67

studies of exomes in two population groups in the Brazilian Amazon (Indians and miscegenated),

68

without description in public genomic banks, and we compared this information with a public

69

databank from a population in southeastern Brazil. These comparisons are important because

Brazil has a continental size and an admixed population in the North (more Amerindians among

71

all regions), Northeast (more Africans), and South and Southeast (more Europeans) [17].

72

Materials and Methods

73

Analyses in the 1000 Genomes Project

74

The analysis was performed on data from the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 database (1000G),

75

which comprises 84,4 million variants in 2,504 individuals from 26 different populations [18].

76

These populations were concentrated in five large groups: African (AFR), Ad Mixed American

77

(AMR), East Asian (EAS), European (EUR), and South Asian (SAS).

78

Through the complete sequence of the X chromosome, a region between nucleotides

79

15620281 and 15512643 was selected in revision GRCh37.p13 (15602158 and 15494520 in

80

GRCh38.p13) since the angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 gene (ACE2, Gene ID: 59272,

81

updated on 22-Mar-2020) is located on the complementary strand, covering 107639 bp.

82

Additionally, a region of ten thousand base pairs upstream to the gene was included in the

83

analysis so that the initial search site became 15630281 (GRCh37.p13) [18,19], aiming to search

84

for modifications in noncanonical sites to locate minor allele frequency (MAF) and allelic

85

differences that could be relevant. The index considered was the difference in allele frequency

86

among all polymorphisms (SNP, INDEL and SV) contained in the study region, regardless of

87

their global or populational frequency.

88

Analyses in Amazon Natives and Admixed Population

89

For the allelic comparison between the populations cataloged in the 1000 Genomes

90

database and the population not described in the respective project, we investigated a population

91

composed of 64 Amerindians and 82 admixed individuals from the Amazon region of northern

92

Brazil. This study was approved by the National Committee for Ethics in Research (CONEP) and

93

the Research Ethics Committee of the UFPA Tropical Medicine Center under CAAE number

94

20654313.6.0000.5172. The Amerindians represent 10 different Amazonian ethnic groups that

95

were grouped together as the Native American (NAM) group. Tribe names and geographic

96

coordinates of the Brazilian Amazon Indian populations are presented in Table S4. The 82

97

admixed individuals (Brazilian Admixed Population - BAP) live in Belém city, located in

98

northern Brazil, where, due to the colonization process, are characterized by three ancestral

99

genetic components: European, Native American and African. This sample group is also enrolled

100

in a broad project. Furthermore, we also compared our findings to a database of variants analyzed

101

in a Southeast Brazilian population, the Online Archive of Brazilian Mutations (ABraOM, we

102

represent here as ABM) [20].

103

DNA Extraction and Exome Library

104

The DNA was extracted as described by Sambrook and collaborators [21]. The genetic

105

material was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,

106

USA). The libraries were prepared using the Nextera Rapid Capture Exome (Illumina) and

107

SureSelect Human All Exon V6 (Agilent) Kits. Sequencing reactions were run using the NextSeq

108

500 High-output v2 300 Cycle Kit (Illumina®, USA) on the NextSeq 500® platform (Illumina®,

109

USA).

eliminate low-quality readings (fastx_tools v.0.13 - http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). The

114

sequences were aligned with the reference genome (GRCh37) using the BWA v.0.7 tool

115

(http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/). The file was indexed and sorted (SAMtools v.1.2 -

116

http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/). Subsequently, the alignment was processed (duplicate

117

118

quality recalibration and local realignment (GATK v.3.2 - https: //www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/)

119

were performed. The results were processed to determine the variants (GATK v.3.2) from the

120

reference genome. SnpEff v.4.3t, Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (Ensembl release 99) and

121

ClinVar (v.2018-10) were used for variant annotations.

122

Databank Analysis

123

Information from the databank and exomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics,

124

considering the values of allele frequencies of populations and subpopulations as the data

125

explored comparatively. Genotypic differences between sexes in the homo/hemizygous state

126

were calculated based on the premise that populations are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

127

Results

128

Analyzing the polymorphisms contained in the ACE2 locus, in addition to ten thousand

129

base pairs upstream, we found 2266 polymorphisms, of which 199 were contained in the region

130

5´ upstream of the gene, 85 were located in exonic regions, and the others were located in the

131

introns.

132

Polymorphisms in exonic regions that may influence disease outcome

133

In the exonic region, 15 SNPs of the 85 polymorphisms found in 1000G present

134

differences greater than 1% between some of the populations (all between exons 17 to 21).

135

Another three polymorphisms (rs889263894, rs1027571965, rs147464721) appear mainly in the

136

Brazilian population. Nine of these exonic polymorphisms are present in the most common

137

isomorphs (v1 and v2) and show important differences in populational frequency (Fig 1,

138

additional data on S1 Table).

144

As noted, some of these polymorphisms have very significant differences between MAFs

145

from different populations. rs35803318 is absent in Asians (virtually absent in AFR) and has an

146

average MAF of 0.05 in EUR and ABM, increased to 0.074 in BAP, and has the highest allele

147

frequency in the indigenous population among all populations (MAF=0.121).

148

On the other hand, rs4646179 is absent in indigenous, miscegenated people from the

149

Amazon, Asians and Europeans and is found in the population of southeastern Brazil and

150

Americans, with a MAF=0.023 and an even greater frequency in Africans (MAF=0.074).

151

Interestingly, rs1027571965 and rs889263894 presented allele frequencies exclusively in

152

indigenous people and are not being found in any other world population of 1000G, neither in

153

BAP nor in the Brazilian ABM database, with MAF=0.095 and 0.034, respectively.

154

rs147464721 has MAF=0.014 in the miscegenated population of the Amazon (BAP);

155

however, they did not present any allelic frequency among the indigenous population, as well as

156

in Asians and Europeans, presenting a slightly lower MAF difference when compared to AFR

157

and AMR.

158

Polymorphisms in upstream regions that may influence disease outcome

159
160

Differences greater than 1% of MAF in the region 10,000 base pairs 5´ upstream to the
gene were observed in 57 polymorphisms (Fig 2).

163

differences greater than 1%. Coordinate represents the frequency of the allele (MAF).

164

Among the highlights, rs5934250, with a change from G to T at approximately 5700 bp

165

upstream to the gene, presented a difference of up to 0.47 in the AFR (0.10), AMR (0.29), EAS

166

(0.01), EUR (0.47) and SAS (0.22) populations for the T allele. This means that the T allele is

167

almost zero in the East Asian population, while it has a MAF in almost half of Europeans.

168

It is also worth mentioning that the rs2097723 SNP presents a very heterogeneous

169

distribution, oscillating between 7% in Africans, 32% in Americans, 42% in East Asians, 28% in

170

Europeans and 22% in South Asians.

171

Polymorphisms in intronic regions that may influence disease outcome

172

In intronic polymorphisms, many of them present a very relevant MAF interpopulational

173

difference (up to 0.46). Two of them deserve to be highlighted, rs2285666 and rs4646140,

174

because they are near exons.

175

It is important to mention that rs2285666 has the highest frequency of the rarest allele

176

(MAF=0.71) in the indigenous population, with very important MAF differences of 0.17 (EAS),

177

0.23 (SAS), 0.36 (BAP), and 0.37 (AMR) and an average difference of 0.48 for the others (EUR,

178

AFR and ABM). In contrast, rs4646140 has a MAF ranging from zero in Indians to 0.13 in

179

Africans through EUR, AMR, BAP, EAS, ABM and SAS (Fig 3). Furthermore, considering the

180

possibility of influence in determining isoforms v2, it is worth noting rs190614788 on intron 1

181

(with a difference of more than 0.11 between EUR and EAS).

Discussion

194

Polymorphisms of the ACE2 gene are important in the binding region of the viral particle

195

Considering the regions where the virus commonly binds to ACE2 [14,15], our results

196

point to the absence of relevant polymorphisms at these sites because many of those located in

197

coding regions have MAFs close to or less than 0.001, as well as a very low possibility of

198

conferring any global (or population) impact on the destination of the disease. Therefore, there

199

does not seem to be any direct mechanism (at the sites of interaction) that could confer some

200

form of resistance or greater propensity to contagion in humans. In view of this finding, other

201

molecular modifications with potential functional repercussions were investigated, including 1)

202

changes in sites distant to the viral binding locus, but which may bring about some structural

203

protein change with the potential to influence the cell-virus interaction; 2) changes in translation

204

regulation regions at 3´ UTR sites, at points of interaction with miRNA; and 3) modifications in

205

transcription regulation zones in 5´ upstream regions and intragenic promoters.

206

Polymorphisms with the potential to cause changes in the protein structure of ACE2 that

207

may impact virus-cell interactions

208

The ACE2 gene is mainly composed of two isoforms with 18 or 19 exons (v1 and v2) that

209

encode the same protein (805 amino acids) and three other smaller variants: x1, x2 and x3, which

210

have rarely been studied [19,23]. Thus, we searched for genotypic information in these exons that

211

could allow us to infer a disruption with the potential to culminate in impacts on the disease

212

process.

mainly belonging to exons 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21; the last two are terminal exons belonging only

215

to rare isoforms [19].

216

Among these, rs41303171 is a missense SNP, causing the replacement of an asparagine

217

(neutral amino acid) with aspartic acid (electronegative amino acid) at codon 720, which can

218

culminate in a conformational disorder of this protein that, directly or indirectly, can change viral

219

interactions. This polymorphic variant C is practically exclusive to Europeans (MAF=0.018), a

220

fact corroborated by Cao and collaborators [9], mainly in British individuals (MAF=0.03).

221

Across Asia, this allele is not found, and is only present in a single Asian resident of the UK [18].

222

In Brazil, ABraOM data point to MAF<0.01. Thus, the possible biological implications of this

223

change may have some clinical-epidemiological consequences in a small niche of European

224

patients with COVID-19 when compared to other regions of the world.

225

The change from leucine to phenylalanine in codon 731 (rs147311723) results in the

226

exchange of two nonpolar amino acids that are structurally different (with the presence of an

227

aromatic ring in this last), which may culminate in functional modifications in the ACE2 protein,

228

with the prediction that this will occur equally to 0.941, according to the PolyPhen algorithm

229

[22]. This polymorphism is absent in Asians and Europeans, with low frequency in Americans

230

and Southeast Brazilians, and it has MAF=0.017 in Africans, mainly in Nigerians, with

231

MAF=0.043 of allele A. In a study by Cao and colleagues [9], this polymorphism was described

232

as a low frequency SNP in the 1000G database, but without any mention in the China Metabolic

233

Analysis Project (ChinaMAP) database, reinforcing its absence in this population group.

234

In a context focused on the Brazilian Amazon, unprecedented data showed the presence of

235

two SNPs absent in all populations of the 1000G. One of them is rs1027571965, which is

236

characterized by an exchange of G>C in exon 16, leading to a substitution of alanine for glycine

237

at codon 673 (MAF=0.095), and the other, rs889263894, an exchange of T>A in exon 13

238

(MAF=0.034), causing an alteration of lysine to isoleucine in codon 541; thus, this last SNP

239

should cause structural differences by the exchange of a polar and electropositive amino acid

240

with a hydrophobic amino acid, possibly resulting in functional changes in ACE2, with a

241

probability of 0.958 that this event will occur [22]. Both SNPs had uncertain significance until

242

now.

243

It is also noteworthy that in codons 351 (rs147464721), 690 (rs4646179) and 749

244

(rs35803318), there are just synonymous alterations, without any study of modifications of this

245

enzyme in a genotype-dependent manner.

246

Polymorphisms with the potential to accentuate ACE2 gene expression or translation that

247

may impact virus-cell interactions

248

Our data point to a series of polymorphisms in the region upstream of the ACE2 gene,

249

which oscillate markedly among populations and, therefore, in individuals, although some of

250

them may not have relevant frequency at a global level. Among them, there are rs2097723 and

251

rs5934250, with population allele differences of up to 0.35 and 0.47, respectively.

252

The lower frequency allele (C) of rs2097723 has a normalized effect size (NES) of up to

253

0.36 [24] for increased expression of the ACE gene in brain tissue. The T allele of rs5934250 has

254

an NES of 0.64 for lower ACE2 expression in this tissue, among others. Thus, when looking at

255

population data, it can be inferred that, according to these two variants, populations in East Asia

256

would have the worst scenario with regard to increased gene expression and, Europeans or

257

Africans have the most favorable allelic combination for these two SNPs in the pre-genic region.

258

Another interesting observation involves the exon 19 polymorphisms, which are

259

contained in the 3´ UTR region of the two most important isoforms, the canonical miRNA

260

binding site for translation control dependent on this epigenetic mechanism [19,25]. In this

261

regard, observing the regions of interaction between the miRNA and nucleotide exchange sites, it

262

can be noted that rs182366225 is included in the site of attachment to the seed region of miR-

263

140-3p.1 and miR-483-3p.2, both with a match of 7mer-1A and Context ++ score percentile of 90

264

and 74, respectively. Thus, the proportion of translation regulation that depends on these

265

miRNAs will be upregulated in the East Asian population, especially in Vietnamese and Chinese

266

individuals, who have an average MAF of 0.032 of the C allele, which is not observed in any

267

other population in the world [26]. A reporter assay for miR-483-3p predicted targets by Kemp

268

and collaborators [27] showed that the regulation of ACE2 is dependent on this microRNA.

269

The rs142017934 site includes the connection site for miR-610 and miR-3646, both with

270

8mer of match in ACE2 (context ++ score percentile of 98 and 77, respectively), in addition to

271

the seed regions of miR-3609 and miR-548ah-5p, both with a match of 7mer-m8 and scores of 84

272

and 74, respectively [25]. This polymorphism occurs exclusively in the population of African

273

origin (MAF=0.013), mainly in Nigerians and individuals from Barbados with African ethnicity,

274

with an average of MAF=0.026. This higher frequency among people of African ethnicity

275

residing on different continents is probably due to the strong population ancestry of Barbados

276

being from West Africa, a region containing Nigeria [28].

277

Among the intronic polymorphisms, rs2285666 draws much attention because it presents

278

the highest frequency of the rarest allele (MAF=0.71) in the indigenous population, with

279

differences ranging from 0.48 to 0.17 for the other populations, with the Asians being the most

280

similar to the Indians, mainly the Chinese. The high MAF observed in the Chinese population in

281

the present study corroborates the data of Cao and collaborators9 using the ChinaMAP database.

282

The substitution of C for T in intron 4, to only four nucleotides of exon 3 (located in the splicing

283

region), influences the gene expression in brain tissues and tibial nerve in some way so that the T

284

allele is related to a significant increase in the expression of ACE2 [22], thus being a determinant

285

in clinical differences that will be demonstrated in this naturally more vulnerable population.

286

Another intronic polymorphism, rs4646140, has no MAF in the indigenous population,

287

reaching 0.13 in Africans, mainly in Nigerians (0.17). Some studies show the influence of these

288

two intronic SNPs with hypertension [29,30], since there is a possibility that they will interfere in

289

the ACE2 protein product.

290
291

In conclusion, considering this genetic aspect involving ACE2 in the complex relationship
between SARS-CoV-2 and humans, we emphasize the following:

292

There are genetic markers that could influence the unequal rates of aggravation and death

293

observed between men and women. Considering the polymorphisms as harmful when in

294

homozygosity (genotypic frequency equal to allelic frequency squared) or hemizygosity

295

(genotypic frequency equal to allelic frequency), men would have this conditions from 1·4 to 77

296

times more (uniallelic) than women (Table 1). Thus, a relevant contribution to the understanding

297

of higher mortality in males is presented, as reported in the various populations affected by

298

COVID-19.

299

The rates of contagion and death fluctuate greatly; in this sense, ACE2 polymorphisms

300

could contribute to these differences. The rs182366225 and rs2097723 polymorphisms are more

301

frequent in the East Asian population and are potentially unfavorable to the individual, as they

302

increase the expression of the enzyme. These allele frequencies are even higher in Chinese and

303

Vietnamese populations. Such markers are on the order of 30% to 180% more frequently in East

304

Asians than in other populations.

305

Indigenous

populations

from

Amazon have

exclusive genetic polymorphisms

306

(rs1027571965 and rs889263894) or with higher frequencies (rs2285666 and rs35803318) than

307

other populations. These polymorphisms are related to increased expression of the ACE2 gene in

308

brain tissues, among others. This is an extremely relevant finding because they may influence the

309

outcomes in these populations, whose involvement by COVID-19 was recently reported. This

310

population group, due to its genetic peculiarity and less previous exposure to viral infections,

311

represents a major challenge in understanding and handling this pandemic.

312

Africans have higher rates of three relevant polymorphisms (rs147311723, rs142017934

313

and rs4646140). Polymorphism in rs142017934 is exclusive to this population and can influence

314

the translation regulation of the ACE2 gene, thus enhancing the expression of this gene, which

315

may present an increased risk for individuals who carry this variant. However, Europeans and

316

some Africans have a higher frequency of an allele (rs5934250) that seems to reduce the

317

expression of ACE2 in some tissues. Individuals with this genotype would have a more

318

protective factor against this infection.

319

Therefore, the study highlights the importance of this genetic factor in facilitating or

320

restricting infection and, especially, in potential clinical manifestations and outcomes. The

321

investigation of these polymorphisms in patients affected by COVID-19, with different clinical

322

conditions and outcomes, has great potential to favor understanding the behavior of this

323

pandemic disease.
