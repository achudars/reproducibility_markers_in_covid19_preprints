Abstract

20

Background: In the United States, underserved communities including Blacks and Latinx are

21

disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and widespread vaccination is critical for curbing this

22

pandemic. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy,

describe attitudes related to vaccination, and identify correlates among racial minority and

24

marginalized populations across 9 counties in North Carolina.

25

26

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a self-administered questionnaire

27

distributed at free COVID-19 testing events in underserved rural and urban communities from

28

August 27 – December 15, 2020. Vaccine hesitancy was defined as the response of “no” or

29

“don’t know/not sure” to whether the participant would get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it

30

became available.

31

32

Results: The sample comprised 948 participants including 27.7% Whites, 59.6% Blacks, 12.7%

33

Latinx, and 63% female. Thirty-two percent earned <$20K annually, 60% owned a computer and

34

~80% had internet access at home. The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 68.9% including

35

62.7%, 74%, and 59.5% among Whites, Blacks, and Latinx, respectively. Between September

36

and December, the largest decline in vaccine hesitancy occurred among Whites (27.5 percentage

37

points), followed by Latinx (17.6) and the smallest decline was among Black respondents (12.0).

38

51.2% of the respondents reported vaccine safety concerns, 23.7% wanted others to get of the

39

respondents reported they would trust health care providers with information about the COVID-

40

19 vaccine. Factors associated with hesitancy in multivariable logistic regression included being

41

female (OR=1.90 95%CI[1.36, 2.64]), being Black (OR=1.68 [1.106 2.45]), calendar month

42

(OR=0.76 [0.63, 0.92]), safety concerns (OR=4.28 [3.06, 5.97]), and government distrust

43

(OR=3.57 [2.26, 5.63]).

Conclusions: This study reached underserved minority populations in a number of different

46

locations to investigate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We built on existing relationships and

47

further engaged the community, stake holders and health department to provide free COVID-19

48

testing. This direct approach permitted assessment of vaccine hesitancy (which was much higher

49

than national estimates), distrust, and safety concerns.

Highlights
•

This study surveyed 948 adults at COVID-19 testing sites in 9 counties of North Carolina

55

between August 27 and December 15, 2020 where vaccine hesitancy was widespread

56

including 74% in Blacks, 62.7% in Whites and 59.5% in Latinx.

57

•

Vaccine hesitancy declined over time but remained high for Blacks.

58

•

On-site surveys conducted in underserved areas that were paper-based and self-

59

administered permitted reaching adults with no internet (17%), no cell phone (20%), no

60

computer (40%) and yearly incomes less than 20K (31%).

61

62

•

Widespread vaccine hesitancy in predominately minority communities of NC must be
addressed to successfully implement mass COVID-19 vaccination programs.

Background
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has exacerbated deeply rooted

65

socioeconomic and health disparities in historically marginalized populations.1,2 Since the

66

coronavirus epidemic started in the US, it has become one of the leading cause of death.3,4

67

COVID-19 incidence is disproportionately higher among both Blacks and Latinx. Racial

68

minorities are more likely to become severely ill, and nearly three times as likely as Whites to

69

die from COVID-19.5

70

In November 2020, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech released their findings from

71

randomized trials of COVID-19 vaccines, showing a remarkable 90-95% efficacy.6,7 The Food

72

and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for the Pfizer-

73

BioNTech vaccine on December 10, 20208 and the Moderna vaccine on December 18, 2020.9

74

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) updated recommendations for

75

allocating initial supplies with tiered distribution to groups at highest risk first (e.g., health care

76

workers, nursing home residents, and the elderly)10,11 before universal distribution. The

77

population effectiveness12 to reach herd immunity thresholds for COVID-19 requires an

78

estimated 70% of the population to be vaccinated.13,14 To promote vaccine uptake and access

79

requires resources, strategies and structural intervention in multiple sectors.15 Vaccine hesitancy

80

is defined as a “delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination

81

services.”16 The decision to accept, delay, or refuse vaccination is complex depending heavily on

82

the context, place, and specific vaccine. It is paramount that we understand COVID-19 vaccine

83

hesitancy in historically marginalized populations (HMPs) where underlying trust issues directly

84

impact vaccine decisions.

85

Since early in the pandemic, several studies have used commercial panels, address lists,

86

or random telephone surveys, representative of the US population to estimate vaccine

87

hesitancy.17–29 The advantage of panel studies is that a large sample can be enrolled within a

88

very short time (weeks or days), but participation often requires internet access. Two studies

89

conducted during May and June, drawing from different panels, each estimated that 31% of the

90

US population had vaccine hesitancy.23,27 Others from approximately the same period reported

91

rates as low as 11% to 25%.20,21,26 These studies consistently reported higher levels of vaccine

92

hesitancy among female and Black respondents but it decreased with increasing age. Other

93

indicators of low socioeconomic status (e.g., education and income) were also frequently

94

associated with vaccine hesitancy. Serial polls and studies from the Pew Research Center and

95

others show that vaccine hesitancy has declined around the time the FDA issued EUAs for

96

the two COVID-19 vaccines.30–32 Although these studies provide important national estimates

97

of vaccine hesitancy for the overall population and within subpopulations, online surveys do not

98

capture the variants associated with social context, particularly for rural communities with low

99

and intermittent internet connectivity.33

100

In response to the COVID-19 public health emergency, North Carolina Central

101

University (NCCU), a historically black college and university (HBCU), established the

102

Advanced Center for COVID-19 Related Disparities (ACCORD). ACCORD aims to facilitate

103

COVID-19 testing, multidisciplinary research, and messaging directed at historically

104

marginalized populations in nine North Carolina counties. A key component of the ACCORD

105

efforts is working in close collaboration with community partners. Unlike online incentivized

106

panels, the ACCORD study investigated vaccine hesitancy in targeted predominately rural and

107

urban communities with entrenched, persistent, socioeconomic and health inequalities. The

108

ACCORD strategy was to enroll a convenience sample at COVID-19 testing events hosted by

109

NCCU. This targeted engagement with communities permitted directly assessing the prevalence

110

and identifying correlates of vaccine hesitancy and whether it changed over time.

111

Methods

112

North Carolina has 100 counties that vary widely with respect to population density,

113

rurality and urbanicity, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic, and health indicators. As an HBCU,

114

NCCU has fostered trusting and collaborative relationships with Black underserved communities

115

for decades. Building on these partnerships, ACCORD facilitated COVID-19 testing and

116

surveying programs in nine counties that represent economically-distressed and Health Research

117

Services Administration (HRSA)-designated medically-underserved areas. ACCORD identified

118

local residents as community facilitators and leveraged existing health resources such as public

119

health departments in each county to garner community support for COVID-19 testing events.

120

ACCORD has hosted 52 testing events at locations carefully selected by community facilitators

121

to provide access in otherwise COVID-19 testing deserts. Testing events occurred between

122

August 27, 2020 and December 15, 2020.

123

ACCORD COVID-19 testing events took place in the parking lots of churches, schools,

124

and similar venues that accommodated drive-through testing. ACCORD partnered with health

125

departments and other service providers to collect nasal swabs for PCR tests. Eligibility criteria

126

to participate in the survey included being at least 18 years of age, English or Spanish

127

comprehension and providing informed consent. NCCU students, faculty and staff greeted

128

individuals in their cars and explained that the university was conducting a survey to better

129

understand the experiences and thoughts about COVID-19 in their community. If they agreed,

130

they received the consent form and survey on a sanitized clipboard with a new ink pen that had

131

never been used (to keep). (Initially, participants were offered sanitized tablets to enter their

132

responses electronically but this was discontinued for logistical reasons.) All volunteers had their

133

temperatures recorded upon arrival, wore masks at all times, sanitized their hands frequently, and

134

used sanitized clipboards and tablets. Survey participants received a variety of NCCU-branded

135

items [e.g., T-shirts, string bags, and cups]) and their names were entered into a monthly raffle

136

for gift cards. The Institutional Review Board at NCCU approved the study.

137

Measures

138

To reduce respondent burden, participants received one of three survey questionnaires

139

that each assessed different topics related to COVID-19 in greater depth. The different surveys

140

assessed psychosocial stress, barriers to COVID-19 testing, contact tracing acceptability, and

141

electronic media use. Each version included a set of core questions. Each survey was clearly

142

marked with a version number (i.e., 1, 2, 3) to ensure that they were evenly distributed. All three

143

versions assessed COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and one version had additional questions about

144

trusted sources for information about the vaccine.

145

Vaccine hesitancy was assessed (across all three questionnaire versions) with the

146

question “Scientists are working on a COVID-19 vaccine. Would you get vaccinated against

147

COVID-19 as quickly as possible when the vaccine becomes available?” Response choices

148

included yes, no, and don’t know/not sure. To explore features of vaccine hesitancy, regardless of

149

participants’ responses, the survey then asked, “Which of the reasons below would stop you or

150

delay you from getting vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as the vaccine becomes

151

available?” Participants could choose multiple responses including: 1) Don't believe that

152

vaccines work; 2) Have concerns about vaccine safety; 3) Do not trust the government about

153

the vaccine; 4) Do not trust the medical system; and 5) Want others to get the vaccine first.

154

The outcome used for regression analysis - vaccine hesitancy - combined the

155

responses no, and don’t know/not sure. Participants who skipped or declined to answer the

156

question were excluded. This analysis also assessed temporal trends for vaccine hesitancy

157

over the data collection period by segmenting the events weeks into three time periods:

158

August-September, October, and November-December. The month number during which

159

the event occurred was treated as a continuous variable in regression models.

160

Analysis

161

All analyses were conducted using Stata Ver 15 (College Station, TX). The analysis

162

generated descriptive statistics and tabular analysis with Chi Square or Fisher’s exacts tests,

163

estimated the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy, quantified reasons to delay or not get vaccinated,

164

and changes over time. Respondents who skipped or declined to answer question(s) were

165

excluded from most analyses. Logistic regression models were used to identify correlates

166

associated with vaccine hesitancy. We selected variables for the adjusted regression model on the

167

basis of previous studies, a prior hypotheses and sample size. As a sensitivity analysis, we used

168

general linear models (glm) with a poisson distribution, logit link function, and robust standard

169

errors. The effect estimates were similar and do not change interpretation.

170

171

Results

172

We recruited a convenience sample of 1,004 participants from 34 testing events. Of these,

173

948 (94%) reported their race/ethnicity and remained in the analysis. The majority of participants

174

were Black (59.1%), followed by Whites (26.6%) and Latinx (14.4%) (Table 1). Females

175

comprised 63.9% of the sample. The median age for Blacks was 57 and significantly older than

176

Whites (45) and Latinx (37). While disparities in socioeconomic status between Whites and

177

Blacks were evident, Latinx participants were markedly poorer. Significantly more Latinx (40%)

178

did not complete high school or earn a GED as compared to 3.6% of Whites and 9.7% of Blacks.

179

Most respondents lived in a house (68.6%), with noteworthy disparities; 83.5%, 68%, and 42.9%

180

of Whites, Blacks and Latinx living in a house, respectively. Furthermore, 37.9% of Latinx lived

181

in a mobile home as compared to 11.6% of Blacks and 9.3% of Whites. The proportion of Blacks

182

who were married or cohabitating was lowest (39.3%). The majority of Latinx (71.1%) lacked

183

health insurance as compared to Whites (16.7%) and Blacks (14.2%). Approximately half (51%)

184

of Latinx, 30.8% of Blacks and 23.2% of Whites reported an annual income less than $20K.

185

Overall, 15.6%, 38.2%, and 13.1% of respondents reported difficulty paying for food, monthly

186

bills and medical care or prescriptions, respectively.

187

Disparities with respect to technology and access to the internet was evident among all

188

survey participants. Approximately 39% of respondents did not own a computer. Only 69.3% of

189

Latinx owned a mobile phone as compared 88.2% of Whites and 80.5% of Blacks. Although

190

internet access in the home was nearly universal among Whites (92.4%), significantly fewer

191

Blacks (80.1%) and Latinx (78.7%) reported internet access.

192

Vaccine hesitancy

193

The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy varied by race/ethnicity (Table 2); only 23.4% of

194

Blacks as compared to 36.1% of Whites reported they would get vaccinated as soon as possible.

195

Comparable proportions across all groups (35-36%) were unsure or did not know if they would

196

get it as soon as possible and 89 respondents (9%) skipped the question. Notably, 10% of Blacks

197

and 18.5% of Latinx did not answer the question. Excluding participants who skipped the

198

question and combining the responses no and don’t know classifies 62.7% of Whites, 74% of

199

Blacks, and 59.5% of Latinx as vaccine hesitant (Table 2). Overall, 69% of respondents reported

200

vaccine hesitancy.

201

The most common reason for not- or delaying-getting vaccinated was safety concerns for

202

54,4% of Whites, 52.9% of Blacks, and 31.9% of Latinx (Table 2). Only 17% of Latinx wanted

203

others to receive the vaccine first, as compared to 22.6% of Whites and 25.7% of Blacks.

204

Significantly more Blacks (28.6%) mistrusted the government as compared to 17.9% and 13.3%

205

of Whites and Latinx, respectively. The questionnaire also included a question that referred to

206

mistrust of the medical system that very few participants indicated (5.5%). Among the subset of

207

respondents (n=311) who received additional questions, trusted sources for information about the

208

vaccine diverged significantly for Latinx. For example, only 36.5% of Latinx trust health care

209

providers for information on COVID-19 as opposed to 70.7% and 67.4% of Whites and Blacks,

210

respectively.

211

Figure 1 presents the distributions of reasons to prevent or delay vaccination stratified by

212

participants’ responses to getting the vaccine as soon as possible. These results reveal important

213

subtleties. Although 28.1% of respondents reported that they would indeed get the vaccine

214

(Table 2), they nevertheless reported they had safety concerns (30.7%) (Figure 1). Respondents

215

who reported they would not get vaccinated were also more likely to report that vaccines don’t

216

work (14.7%) and government mistrust (43%). It is important to note that between 24-26% of

217

participants, independent of their vaccine hesitancy (or lack of) wanted others to get the vaccine

218

first (p-value= 0.769).

219

Figure 2 displays patterns of temporal changes in three intervals by vaccine hesitancy and

220

stratified by race. The prevalence of hesitancy declined for each group. It was not statistically

221

significant for Latinx because the majority enrolled at testing events during October located at

222

Latino churches in one county. The prevalence of hesitancy among Whites declined by 27.5

223

percentage points from a high of 69.2% during September to 41.7% during November-December

224

(p-value=0.01). While vaccine hesitancy also significantly declined among Blacks, the

225

prevalence was very high during the first interval (78.4%) and only declined by 12 percentage

226

points (66.4%) during November-December.

227

Logistic regression

228

Table 3 presents the bivariate associations with vaccine hesitancy. Although ownership

229

of mobile phones (OR=2.12, 95%CI[1.31, 3.43]) and computers (OR=1.46, 95%CI[1.00, 2.13]),

230

3.43] were associated with hesitancy, they were not included in the adjusted model because the

231

questions were asked to a subset of participants (n=607, 64% of sample). In the multivariable

232

model (Table 4), Blacks were 1.68(1.16, 2.45) and females were 1.90 (1.36, 2.64) times as likely

233

to report vaccine hesitancy, as well as participants who expressed safety concerns (OR=4.28

234

[3.06, 5.97]), government distrust (OR=3.57 [2.26, 5.63]) or wanting others to get vaccinated

235

first (OR=1.44, [0.98, 2.11], marginally significant p=0.062). Hesitancy also persisted to

236

significantly decline over time with each passing month (OR=0.76 [0.63, 0.92]).

237

Discussion

238

The ACCORD study enrolled over 1000 participants attending COVID-19 testing events

239

that took place in targeted communities with high racial/ethnic minorities which suffer from

240

health disparities and economic inequalities. The pandemic has intensified historically valid

241

distrust of the government, medical establishment, and probably academic researchers. Our

242

success in conducting this study emanates from the innate trust embedded in the definition of an

243

HBCU, in addition to enlisting local residents as community facilitators who looked like

244

participants, and our on-the-ground approach.

245

One other study in the US (to date) mirrors our methods.34 Researchers at the University

246

of California Berkeley have collaborated with Latino farmworker communities for decades.

247

They recruited 1115 farmworkers receiving free COVID-19 tests at clinics and other community

248

events during July – November 2020. Half (52%) of participants reported they would be

249

extremely likely to get vaccinated and 32% were unsure. Most vaccine-hesitant participants

250

reported worry about side effects (~65%). While this study and the ACCORD study reached

251

different marginalized populations, they share similar concerns. Both studies suggest that

252

working within communities where trust is earned will be essential for addressing vaccination

253

and the many needs that the COVID-19 pandemic has created or made worse.

254

Unlike representative online panel studies,17–28,35,36 we captured vast differences in

255

COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among historically marginalized populations living in areas that

256

lack technology and reliable internet service.33 The estimated prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in

257

national studies ranged between ~11% to 35% whereas in the ACCORD study, it ranged

258

between 42% to 79% depending on the race/ethnicity and collection window. Some online

259

studies collected political party affiliation or conservative versus liberal attitudes to quantify the

260

partisan impacts on pandemic response.19,22,28,37,38 In general, White, Republicans, and

261

conservatives were less likely to wear masks or practice social distancing. Fortunately, Dr.

262

Anthony Fauci has become a household name and research suggests that his endorsement of

263

wearing masks and COVID-19 vaccines increases confidence and uptake among Democrats and

264

Republicans alike.28

265

Nevertheless, these findings reflect the charged social climate during the four months of

266

the ACCORD study. This period, August-December 2020, will remain prominently ingrained in

economic hardships, Black Lives Matter and the death of George Floyd instilled more activism,

269

the incidence of COVID-19 fluctuated across the country, a new president was elected, and two

270

highly efficacious COVID-19 vaccines6,7 received emergency use authorizations from the FDA.

271

Meanwhile, attitudes about the pandemic and vaccines, in particular, are rapidly changing.

272

Repeated polls report that vaccine hesitancy has dropped over time (yet remains higher among

273

Blacks).31,39 Surveys of health care workers reported more hesitancy (than the public) at the

274

beginning of the pandemic, but as the results from clinical trials were released, hesitancy

275

diminished precipitously.40,41

276

Despite these promising trends, vaccine hesitancy may continue to persist among

277

historically marginalized populations unless substantial resources, funding, messaging, public

278

health activities, and access to vaccination programs are deployed. Intervention research

279

scientists often engage African American pastors and church leaders to promote healthy

280

behaviors.42,43 Our findings show that fewer than 10% of respondents seek the advice of the

281

church for COVID-19 vaccine information. Still, the importance and influence of faith leaders,

282

however, cannot be undermined. ignored or diminished. Although, the majority of respondents

283

(62.5%) placed their trust in their health care providers, efforts must be made to collectively

284

utilize community and faith leaders and health providers of color24 to deliver accurate and

285

reliable information about the vaccine.15 Misinformation may change attitudes and the

286

appearance of any side effects from the first shot may deter people from receiving their second

287

shot and any booster vaccinations. Providing transparent information about vaccine

288

development, potential side effects, and answering related questions will help ameliorate vaccine

289

hesitancy.

There are limitations of the ACCORD survey. The data originate from a convenience

291

self-selected sample recruited from COVID-19 testing events who agreed to take the extra time

292

to complete the survey. The extent to which they reflect the experiences of others in their

293

communities is unclear. Because respondents completed paper surveys, we did not have the

294

advantages of electronic data entry including logic checks, skip patterns, and reducing missing

295

data. However, online surveys tended to skip the questions about reasons not to vaccinate. Such

296

questions were administered to all respondents in our paper survey, showing that people who

297

were not vaccinate hesitant, nonetheless, had safety concerns and wanted others to get the

298

vaccine first (Figure 2). Logistical constraints prevented collecting COVID-19 test results from

299

participants. That said, not collecting testing results likely increased participation and preserved

300

community trust.

301

The ACCORD communities were testing deserts and susceptible to becoming vaccination

302

deserts perpetuating health disparities if provision of vaccines fails to address and overcome

303

obstacles. Emerging evidence suggests that navigating the landscape to obtain vaccines requires

304

a combination of information about where to go, health literacy, computer savvy, patience, and

305

persistence.44,45 ACCORD presents an example of a coordinated system, where collected

306

meaningful data for the implementing of evolving COVID-19 management and vaccination

307

strategies on-the-ground in most vulnerable and underserved communities.
