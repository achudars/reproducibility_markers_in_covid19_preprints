Abstract
Background: Biomarkers to predict Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outcome early at
infection are urgently needed to improve prognosis and treatment. Zinc balances immune
responses and also has a proven direct antiviral action against some viruses. Importantly, zinc
deficiency (ZD) is a common condition in elderly and individuals with chronic diseases, two
groups with more severe COVID-19 outcomes. We hypothesize that serum zinc content (SZC)
influences COVID-19 disease progression and thus might represent a useful biomarker.
Methods: We run a retrospective observational study with 249 COVID-19 patients admitted in
Hospital del Mar. We have studied COVID-19 severity and progression attending to SZC at
admission. In parallel we have studied SARS-CoV2 replication in the Vero E6 cell line
modifying zinc concentrations.
Findings: Our study demonstrates a correlation between serum zinc levels and COVID-19
outcome. Serum zinc levels lower than 50 µg/dl at admission correlated with worse clinical
presentation, longer time to reach stability and higher mortality. Our in vitro results indicate that
low zinc levels favor viral expansion in SARS-CoV2 infected cells.
Interpretation: SZC is a novel biomarker to predict COVID-19 outcome. We encourage
performing randomized clinical trials to study zinc supplementation as potential prophylaxis and
treatment with people at risk of zinc deficiency.

INTRODUCTION
Infections with SARS-CoV-2 result in a systemic disease with a variety of outcomes, from no
symptoms to severe and diverse pathologies, being pneumonia and acute distress the most
common. Therefore, biomarkers to predict disease severity in early infection stages are urgently
needed.
Zinc (Zn2+) is an essential trace element required for maintaining a variety of fundamental
biological processes due to its functions as a cofactor, signaling molecule, and structural element.
One of the most significant roles of zinc in our body is its broad effect on the immune system1,2,
as both, the adaptive and the innate immunity, are affected by zinc levels. Consequently, zinc
deficiency (ZD), due to low zinc intake and/or malabsorption, results in an immune imbalance
that ultimately causes a major public health problem with high prevalence in elderly and
individuals with chronic diseases1. In adaptive immunity, zinc affects T lymphocyte maturation,
differentiation and cytokine production. B cells activation and plasma cell differentiation depend
on zinc signaling as well2,3. In innate immunity, zinc has an anti-inflammatory role4. Concretely,
ZD is associated with higher levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alfa (5) and with altered activities of
monocytes, neutrophils and NK cells4,6,7. Correspondingly, ZD results in increased susceptibility
to inflammatory and infectious diseases including acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
measles, malaria, tuberculosis, and pneumonia (Reviewed in2).
In this context, zinc supplementation trials have been carried out to reduce morbidity and
mortality in developing countries with high ZD incidence. Importantly, zinc supplementation
significantly reduced the duration of respiratory tract infections caused by rhinoviruses and
coronaviruses8. Moreover, zinc has been shown to have a direct antiviral action (reviewed in 9).
Remarkably, zinc inhibited in vitro both, the binding of the SARS coronavirus RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase to its template and the subsequent elongation, and viral replication in cell
culture10. Altogether, zinc status might condition COVID-19 severity and zinc supplementation
could be a useful tool to impact COVID-19 outcome.
In this work we focus our observational study on the putative association between zinc status of
hospitalized COVID-19 patients with disease progression and clinical outcomes. Moreover, we
address in cell culture the potential of zinc supplementation to directly block SARS-CoV-2
multiplication in Vero E6 infected cells.
METHODS
Study design and participants
A retrospective observational cohort study was performed at Hospital del Mar in Barcelona
(Spain). This is a 400-bed university tertiary hospital in Barcelona that provides healthcare to an
urban area of 500,000 people. All patients admitted with COVID-19 for ≥ 48h between 9th
March and 1st April 2020 were included. COVID-19 was defined as a SARS-CoV-2 infection
confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) performed in nasopharyngeal samples obtained by
trained personnel at hospital admission, and/or by fulfilling clinical diagnostic criteria. These
include any of the following: respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, sore throat, changes in
taste/smell) chest X-Ray findings (uni- or bilateral interstitial infiltrates) that made the diagnosis

probable in the current epidemiological situation. The Institutional Ethics Committee of Hospital
del Mar of Barcelona approved the study and due to the nature of the retrospective data review,
and waived the need for informed consent from individual patients (CEIm 2020/9352).
Procedures
Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and the whole episode (laboratory workout, vital signs,
treatment) data were extracted from the electronic medical record using a standardized data
collection method.
Laboratory workouts were systematized with an at-admission protocol that included a fasting
blood draw complete kidney and liver profile, electrolytes, blood count, coagulation profile,
inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum ferritin), D-dimer, myocardial enzymes, zinc
and selenium levels.
Definitions
Time to clinical stability (TCS)
TCS was defined as the time elapsed since the patient's admission to: oxygen saturation >94%
(FiO2 21%), normalized level of consciousness (baseline), Heart Rate <100rpm, systolic Blood
Pressure > 90mm Hg, temperature <37·2C.
Clinical severity
Clinical severity was assessed at admission with Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS)11. The
same score was used for the follow-up during the admission.
Zinc deficit
According to previous publications the threshold of Zn2+ considered abnormally lower was 50
µg/dl (7·6 µM) (12) This cutoff was set to categorize Zn2+ levels. We considered as predictive
factor the lower range (<50 µg/dl).
Cell culture
Vero E6 cells were grown as described13,14. When indicated, FBS was incubated according to the
manufacturer’s instructions with Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories) to generate Zn2+-free
growth medium. ZnSO4 was added as needed to the final medium to generate specific Zn2+
concentration conditions. Chloroquine (Supelco, #PHR1258) was prepared in water at 10 mM
and used at the desired concentration.
Zinc measurements
Cells were seeded and grown in multi well 24 plates until reaching 80% of confluence. Cells
were incubated with 1 µM of FluoZin-3AM (Invitrogen) or 25 µM of Zinquin (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 30 min at 37ºC (5% CO2) in isotonic solution containing (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2
CaCl2, 0·5 MgCl2, 5 glucose, and 10 Hepes (300 milliosmoles/liter, pH 7·4) plus different
concentrations of Zn2+ and/or Chloroquine (CQ). Cells were then dissociated with Trypsin 0·05%
in 0·53 mM EDTA and were washed with PBS 1x. Fluorescence was quantified using a LSRII
flow cytometer. Further analysis was performed using Flowing Software (Perttu Terho).

For in vivo confocal imaging, cells growth on 22mm coverslips were incubated with Lysotracker
together with FluoZin-3AM or Zinquin in a solution with 50 µM Zn2+ for 30min, washed twice
with PBS and placed under the microscope in isotonic solution for imaging with a SP8 Leica
microscope.
Viability assays
Cells were exposed to different Zn2+ and CQ concentrations for 48h. Then, MTT reagent was
added to obtain a final concentration of 0·5 mg/ml. Cells were incubated 2-3 h at 37ºC. After
that, supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 100 µl of DMSO. The absorbance
was read at 570 nm.
Virus infection and quantification
Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 strain hCoV-19/Spain/VH000001133/2020
(EPI_ISL_418860) and 48 h later viral RNA from the supernatant was extracted using the QuickRNA Viral Kit (Zymo Research). SARS-CoV-2 production was quantified by qPCR with the
qScript™ XLT One-Step RT-qPCR ToughMix®, ROX™ (Quanta Biosciences) using the
following specific probe: 2019-nCoV_N1-P, 5’-FAM-ACCCCGCATTACGTTTGGTGGACCBHQ1-3’; and primers: 2019-nCoV_N1-F, 5’-GACCCCAAAATCAGCGAAAT-3’; and 2019nCoV_N1-R, 5’-TCTGGTTACTGCCAGTTGAATCTG-3’ (Biomers).
Western blot
Cells were treated with 0, 10 or 50 μM of Zn2+ and 10 μM of CQ for 24 h. Then, cells were
washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with 35 μl of lysis buffer ( 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7·4,
150mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 1mM DTT, 10mM 13-GP, 0·1mM Na3VO4
and protease inhibitors). Lysates were vortex for 30 min at 4ºC and centrifuged at 10000 x g to
remove aggregates. Lysates were boiled at 95 ºC and placed 1 min in ice. 20 μl of each sample
were loaded onto a 12 or 14 % polyacrylamide gel. After transfer, membranes were blocked with
5% of milk in TBS-Tween 0·1% for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in
blocking solution: LC3 (L8918, Sigma) at 1:500; p62 (ab155686, Abcam) at 1:1000; GAPDH
(ab8245, Abcam) at 1:1000; and incubated overnight at 4ºC. Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse HRP
secondary antibodies (1:1000; GE Healthcare) were used.
Statistical analysis
A descriptive analysis of the main demographic characteristics of the cohort, and the main
clinical (laboratory, treatment and outcome) characteristics of the episode was done. Continuous
and categorical variables were presented as median (interquartile range (IQR)) and absolute
number (percentage), respectively. Mann-Whitney U-test, χ2 test and Fisher’s exact test were
used to compare differences between individuals with serum zinc levels above and below 50
µg/ml respectively. Bi-variate comparisons and a multiple logistic regression model studying the
impact of at admission serum zinc in in-hospital mortality were fitted adjusting by age, sex,
comorbidities and severity of the episode. Taking into consideration the number of deaths
observed and to avoid overfitting the model we selected the most significant variables and those
that provided a more general characterization of the individuals. We excluded variables if they

had collinearity with MEWS, or age. Significance was a p-value <0.05. Stata 14 software was
used.
In the in vitro assays, we applied either unpaired Student’s t test (when comparing two
conditions) and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc test
(when comparing control with any other condition) were applied. All plots comparisons and p
values are described in figure legends. Analysis was performed using GraphPad software.
RESULTS
We included 249 consecutive adults admitted to the COVID-19 unit between March 9th and
April 1st, 2020. The median age of participants was 65 (54-75) years, 49% were female. Table 1
shows the baseline characteristics of the cohort and the differences between individuals with
SZC < 50 µg/dl and ≥ 50 µg/dl at onset. Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity. At
admission the overall severity according to MEWS score was 2 (1-3). Fever, cough and dyspnea
were the most common symptoms with a frequency of 203 (81%), 198 (79%) and 151 (60%)
respectively. Inflammation was a hallmark of the episode with 224 (87·5%) of individuals with
an abnormal IL-6 at admission and with a median IL-6 42pg/ml (15-89), a median C-ReactiveProtein 7·5 mg/dl (3·5-15.2), and a median D-Dimer 800 UI/l (470-1450). Almost all the
individuals admitted during this period received hydroxychloroquine. Other treatments were
tocilizumab, dexamethasone and methylprednisolone that were prescribed in a quarter of
individuals each one. 70 patients (28%) were admitted to the ICU and 21 (9%) patients died
during hospitalization in this period.
SZC median at admission were 61 µg/dl (9·3 µM) with 58 (23%) of the individuals presenting
SZC <50 µg/dl. Individuals with serum zinc levels <50 µg/dl had higher prevalence of chronic
kidney disease and chronic respiratory disease 9% vs 2%; p=0·024 and 16% vs 7%; p=0·041.
Moreover, this group had a more severe clinical presentation MEWS score (2 (2-3) vs 2 (1-3);
p=0·005) and a significantly higher inflammation measured by the nonspecific marker CReactive protein 14·6mg/dl vs 7mg/dl; p=0·03 and the more specific one IL-6 77pg/ml vs
32pg/ml; p<0·001. At admission, SZC correlated negatively with inflammation measured by IL6 (Pearson's r= -0·307; p<0·001) (Fig 1A) and, interestingly also correlated with the highest
value of IL-6 during the episode (Pearson’s r=-0·317;p<0·001) (Fig 1B). This negative
correlation was also observed with the nonspecific inflammatory markers such as ferritin
(Pearson’s r=-0·227; p=0·001) and C-Reactive Protein (Pearson’s r=-0·315; p<0·001) (Fig 1C).
We also found correlation between SZC at admission and procoagulation factors such as Ddimer (Pearson’s r=-0·317; p=0·048).
The median time to reach clinical stability in our cohort was 9·5 days (6-18). However, subjects
with SZC at admission <50 µg/dl needed longer TCS stability compared with those with zinc
≥50 µg/dl, 25 days (14-36) vs 8 (5-14) days, respectively; p<0·001. Moreover, SZC at admission
was correlated negatively with TCS of the episode (Pearson’s r=-0·441;p<0·001) (Fig 1D). In a
multivariable linear regression model adjusted by age, sex, severity and comorbidities TCS was
associated with low SZC at admission (beta-coefficient -0·21 (95% CI -0·316 to -0·097;
p<0·001)). In an alternative model, serum zinc levels <50 µg/dl negatively impacted on TCS
(beta-coefficient 14·1 (95% CI 4·29 - 23·94; p=0·004).

Twenty-one individuals (9%) died during this period. SZC at admission was significantly higher
among individuals who survived 62 µg/dl (52-72) compared to those who died 49 µg/dl (42-53);
p<0·001. Individuals with SZC at admission <50 µg/dl had a mortality of 21% that was
significantly higher compared with 5% mortality in individuals with zinc at admission ≥50 µg/dl;
p<0·001. We fitted a multivariable logistic regression model including 249 patients with data for
all variables (228 survivors and 21 non-survivors). When adjusting by age, sex, Charlson
comorbidity index and severity, the model showed an odds ratio (OR) for in-hospital death of
0·94 [95% CI 0·899 to 0·982; p=0·006) per unit increase of serum zinc at admission. In an
alternative adjusted model with the predictive variable SZC at admission <50 µg/dl the adjusted
OR for in-hospital death was 3·2 (95% CI 1·01 to 10·12; p=0·047).
To further understand the link between zinc status and COVID-19 severity, we carried out assays
in cell culture to study the direct impact of cellular zinc content on SARS-CoV-2 multiplication.
We used three different concentrations of zinc in the extracellular medium, 0, 10 and 50µM
ZnSO4, to reproduce zinc deficiency, physiological zinc and zinc supplementation, respectively.
As expected, intracellular Zn2+ content changed in Vero E6 cells incubated for 30min in different
extracellular Zn2+ concentrations and monitored with Fluozin 3AM and Zinquin fluorescence
probes. Confocal images showed that FluoZin 3AM signal was mainly localized in the lysosomal
compartment while Zinquin signal was intracellularly spread (Fig 2B). After 48h incubation,
different Zn2+ content solutions did not impact cell viability (Fig 2C). Importantly, extracellular
zinc concentrations affected SARS-CoV-2 multiplication as measured by qPCR from the cell
culture supernatant at 48h post infection. SARS-CoV-2 multiplication was increased at 0 µM
Zn2+ when compared to those values at 10 and 50 µM Zn2+ concentrations (Fig 2D). This
indicates that zinc levels affect the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle in infected cells.
It has been suggested that Zn2+ may potentiate CQ antiviral activity15. To test this, we carried out
SARS-CoV-2 infections at different zinc concentrations in the absence or presence of 10 µM
CQ, the concentration chosen based on previous published effective concentration 13,14. Neither
the CQ toxicity nor its antiviral activity were affected by zinc levels (Fig 3A,B). CQ caused a
significant reduction in SARS- CoV- 2 RNA genome copies compared to control cells
(59·68+18·46%; p<0.05) (Fig 3B). Next, we addressed whether CQ increases the intracellular
Zn2+ content by acting as a zinc ionophore, as was previously proposed16. For this, we evaluated
the cytosolic Zn2+ levels in cells growth under different CQ concentrations using flow cytometry
analysis and FluoZin-3AM and Zinquin labels (Fig 3C). Notably, an increased zinc signal was
observed in a CQ dose dependent manner using FluoZin-3AM but not with Zinquin (Fig 3C).
This indicates that CQ modifies lysosomal Zn2+ content but it is not a zinc ionophore. As the
described increase in lysosomal pH caused by CQ blocks autophagic flux (17) and inhibition of
autophagy impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication 18, we studied the impact on autophagy of different
zinc concentrations in the presence and the absence of CQ (Fig 3D-F). As expected, at 10µM CQ
treatment autophagy blockade resulted in an increased LC3II/I ratio and p62 expression (Fig
3E,F). However, no significant effects on these values were observed at different Zn2+ levels in
the absence or presence of CQ. Altogether, our results indicate that CQ and zinc do not
potentiate each other.

DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrates a correlation between serum zinc levels and COVID-19 outcome. SZC
lower than <50 µg/dl at admission correlated with worse clinical presentation, longer time to
reach stability and higher mortality. These results point at SZC as an early predictor of COVID19 severity, whose adjustment might also constitute an early therapeutic intervention point.
Moreover, we show that SZC affects the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle in the infected cells. This
effect, contrary to what it was previously suggested, does not seem to potentiate CQ activity.
The association between SZC and human health is known for decades1. Due to poor nutrition and
subsequent low zinc intake, ZD remains a major nutritional problem in multiple countries. In
addition, elderly individuals are prone to ZD even in developed countries where the incidence
ranges from 15 to 31% depending on the age and the country of study19. Older adults are the
group at higher risk for severe symptoms and mortality from COVID-19. In our retrospective
observational study with 249 COVID-19 patients admitted to Hospital del Mar, 23% of them had
at admission SZC lower than 50µg/dl, the cutoff associated with ZD and development of clinical
signs12.
At onset, higher levels of inflammatory markers such as IL-6 and C-reactive protein were present
in low SZC patients (Fig 1A,C). The prognostic value for COVID-19 severity of IL-6 and Creactive protein has already been described13. In this work we highlight the importance of SZC as
an early predictor of COVID-19 severity and clinical outcome, and consequently, as a potential
therapeutic intervention point. ZD is known to be associated with proinflammatory responses at
infection, showing higher reactive oxygen species production and inflammatory markers20,21. An
imbalance in cytokine production by cells of both innate and adaptive immunity has also been
reported3,2. In our study, we observed a robust negative correlation between zinc levels and IL-6
(Fig 1B). In this respect, it has been reported that IL-6 potentiates SZC decrease by promoting
zinc internalization in hepatocytes in acute phase of infection22. We cannot discard that the
hypozincemia observed in COVID-19 patients might be caused and worsened by a negative IL-6
production loop.
Several clinical trials using zinc supplementation have been carried out to prevent and treat
infections and inflammatory conditions1,2. Zinc supplementation decreases the incidence of
infection in elderly and improves cytokine imbalance and oxidative stress markers23,24 . Thus, the
idea of supplementing low SZC COVID-19 patients with zinc in order to balance what has been
called the cytokine storm caused by SARS-CoV-2 is attractive. Reassuringly, zinc
supplementation for the common cold caused by rhino- and coronaviruses has been proven to
reduce its duration and symptoms8. In addition to the impact of zinc in the modulation of the
antiviral immune response, zinc has also been shown to have a direct antiviral action9. We have
analyzed in vitro the impact of zinc homeostasis in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results indicate
that hypozincemia favors viral expansion in the infected cell (Fig 2C). These results would
support that the poor clinical outcome observed in low SZC patients is caused by the effect of
ZD on both, inducing immune imbalance and increasing viral load via promoting viral expansion
in the infected cell. Of note, our in vitro studies, however, did not show a replication blockade in
zinc supplementation conditions (50µM, Fig 2C) suggesting the need of a zinc ionophore to

further increase cytosolic zinc levels as previously shown in vitro for Herpes simplex,
picornavirus, arterivirus and SARS-CoV coronavirus9,10.
During the beginning of the pandemic CQ was prescribed as a first line treatment in the acute
presentation. The rationale was that CQ has been claimed to be a novel zinc ionophore16 and CQ
showed antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro13,14. However, clinical trials failed to
demonstrate beneficial effect over COVID-1925,26. Therefore, it was suggested that zinc
supplementation could potentiate its antiviral activity15. In our results in vitro, cellular zinc
content did not modify CQ cytotoxicity, the autophagic flux blockade or its antiviral action
against SARS-CoV2. Moreover, we monitored intracellular zinc content both with Fluozin3AM, a probe previously done by Xue and colleagues that is retained mainly in lysosomes16,
and with Zinquin, which presents a more general intracellular staining. We conclude that CQ is
not a zinc ionophore as previously claimed because its effect on cellular zinc content is restricted
to the lysosomal compartment, probably by altering zinc transport at this specific organelle (Fig
3). Thus, our study does not support the mechanistic rationale of supplementing CQ treatments
with zinc.
This work aims to focus clinical attention on serum zinc content in COVID-19 patients. Our
analysis has shown a robust correlation between low SZC and COVID-19 severity and mortality.
The cause is likely to be a combination of immune system imbalance and a direct benefit of viral
replication. Thus, we propose SZC as a novel parameter to predict COVID-19 outcome. It is then
urgent to start clinical trials supplementing with zinc low SZC patients at admission to
reestablish zinc homeostasis. It should be also recommended to promote zinc supplementation
programs targeted to people at risk of zinc deficiency, such as elderly, in order to reduce
COVID-19 severity.
