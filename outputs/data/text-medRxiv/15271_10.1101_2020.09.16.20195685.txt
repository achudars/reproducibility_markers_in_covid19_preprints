Abstract

The systematic identification of host genetic risk factors is essential for the understanding and
treatment of COVID-19. By performing a meta-analysis of two independent genome-wide
association (GWAS) summary datasets (N = 680,128), a novel locus at 21q22.11 was identified to be
associated with COVID-19 infection (rs9976829 in IFNAR2 and upstream of IL10RB, OR = 1.16, 95%
CI = 1.09 - 1.23, P = 2.57×10-6). The rs9976829 represents a strong splicing quantitative trait locus
(sQTL) for both IFNAR2 and IL10RB genes, especially in lung tissue (P = 1.8×10-24). Gene-based
association analysis also found IFNAR2 was significantly associated with COVID-19 infection (P =
2.58×10-7). Integrative genomics analysis of combining GWAS with eQTL data showed the
expression variations of IFNAR2 and IL10RB have prominent effects on COVID-19 in various types
of tissues, especially in lung tissue. The majority of IFNAR2-expressing cells were dendritic cells
(40%) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (38.5%), and IL10RB-expressing cells were mainly
nonclassical monocytes (29.6%). IFNAR2 and IL10RB are targeted by several interferons-related
drugs. Together, our results uncover 21q22.11 as a novel susceptibility locus for COVID-19, in
which individuals with G alleles of rs9976829 have a higher probability of COVID-19 susceptibility
than those with non-G alleles.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic

[1]

. The

health and economy systems of most nations worldwide are suffering from severe disruptions [2]. As
of July 13th, 2020, there were more than 12.9 million confirmed patients worldwide with more than

, and genomic features of virus

[7]

[5]

,

. Understanding host genetic factors

contributing to COVID-19 susceptibility is essential for the precise management in the community.

Recently, a growing number of researchers have concentrated on the involvement of host genetic
factors in COVID-19. Through performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 1,610
severe COVID-19 patients and 2,205 controls, Ellinghaus et al.

[8]

reported two important gene

clusters of 3p21.31 and 9q34.2 as genetic susceptibility loci for severe COVID-19, and confirmed a
potential involvement of the ABO blood-group system. From a population perspective, the
COVID-19 Host Genetic Consortium launched the “COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative” to collect
data from the genetics community to uncover the genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility,
severity, and outcomes [2]. However, identification of more host genetic risk factors is limited by the
sample size of a single study.

Here, we performed a meta-analysis by combining two independent GWAS summary statistics
with a large-scale sample size to identify novel genes for COVID-19 susceptibility. The systematic
bioinformatics analyses were performed, including MAGMA gene-based association analysis,
S-PrediXcan and S-MultiXcan analysis, Sherlock-based inference analysis, gene-property analysis,
single-cell RNA analysis, and functional enrichment analysis. We uncover the genes and pathways
convey risk of COVID-19 infection and give a clue of the potential effective drugs for treating
COVID-19.

2. Results

2.1. SNP-level association analysis reveals a novel susceptible locus 21q22.11 for COVID-19
By conducting a meta-analysis of GWAS summary data from Ellinghaus et al.

[8]

(COVID_I:

1,610 COVID-19 patients and 2,205 controls) and the COVID-19 Host Genetic Consortium

[2]

(ANA5: 1,678 COVID-19 patients and 674,635 controls), we confirmed two reported loci of 3p21.31
and 9q34.2 to be associated with COVID-19 infection (rs11385942 in SLC6A20, P = 2.87×10-16, and
rs8176719 in ABO, P = 4×10-7; Figure 1, Table 1, and Supplemental Figures S1-S2). The reported
rs657152 in ABO, which is high linkage disequilibrium with rs8176719, remains suggestively
significant (P = 5.53×10-6). Notably, we identified a novel locus at 21q22.11 to be associated with
COVID-19 infection (rs9976829 in IFNAR2-IL10RB, OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09 - 1.23, P =
2.57×10-6; Table 1 and Figure 1). The rs9976829 represents a splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL)
for both IFNAR2 and IL10RB genes across multiple tissues with the strongest significance in the lung
tissue (P = 1.8×10-24; Supplemental Figure S3).

2.2. Gene-based association analysis identifies nine risk genes for COVID-19

We performed a MAGMA gene-based association analysis by using the meta-GWAS results and
found that nine genes in three loci of 3p21.31 (LZTFL1, XCR1, CCR9, FYCO1, SLC6A20, and
CXCR6), 9q21.32 (HNRNPK and RMI1), and 21q22.11 (IFNAR2) were significantly associated with
COVID-19 infection (FDR < 0.05; Figure 2 and Table 2). As expected, the gene of ABO showed a
nominally significant association with COVID-19 (P = 6.55×10-4) consistent with the previous report
[8]

. Of note, IFNAR2 (P = 2.58×10-7), HNRNPK (P = 1.46×10-5), and RMI1 (P = 1.86×10-5) were

identified for the first time to be associated with COVID-19 infection. There were other 30 genes
showing suggestive associations with COVID-19 (P < 1 × 10-3, Supplemental Table S1). Meanwhile,
we performed two MAGMA gene-based association analyses for COVID_I GWAS summary data
from Ellinghaus et al. [8] and the COVID-19 Host Genetic Consortium (ANA5)

[2]

, respectively. We

found that these nine identified genes showed significant or suggestive associations with COVID-19
in both COVID-I and ANA5 datasets (Table 2), indicating that our meta-analysis based on larger
samples enhance the statistical power to uncover risk genes for COVID-19.

2.3. Cytokine-related pathways enriched by risk genes for COVID-19

As mentioned above, there were 41 genes showing significant or suggestive associations with
COVID-19 (P < 1 × 10-3, Supplemental Table S1). We performed a pathway enrichment analysis of
these 41 identified genes for COVID-19 susceptibility (Methods), and found they were significantly
enriched in two pathways of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (FDR = 0.009) and chemokine
signaling pathway (FDR = 0.009) (Figure 3a). Additionally, there were seven pathways showing
suggestive associations (P < 0.05; Supplemental Table S2), including Kaposi sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus infection (P = 0.0086), human cytomegalovirus infection (P = 0.014), and human
papilloma virus infection (P = 0.027). Meanwhile, we conducted a GO enrichment analysis and
found 3 GO-terms were significantly overrepresented (FDR < 0.05; Figure 3b and Supplemental
Table S3). That is, cytokine receptor activity (FDR = 1.01 × 10-5), cytokine binding (FDR = 0.022),
and peptide receptor activity (FDR = 0.027). Previous studies demonstrated that soluble cytokines
activate an anti-viral and anti-proliferate state by inducing the expression of many

interferon-stimulated genes to prevent viral replication

[9]

. Network-based enrichment analysis

showed that these 41 genes are at least partially biologically connected (P = 0.013, Supplemental
Figure S8). These results suggest cytokine-related pathways or functional terms may play important
roles in the process of COVID-19 infection.

2.4. Expression of IFNAR2 and IL10RB associated with COVID-19 across multiple tissues
To highlight the functional association of these 11 identified genes with COVID-19, we
conducted two independent integrative genomics analyses by incorporating meta-GWAS summary
data with eQTL data across 49 GTEx tissues. Using S-PrediXcan analysis, we found that the
expression variations of these 11 genes have prominent effects on COVID-19 in various types of
tissues (Supplemental Table S5). Consistently, Sherlock-based integrative genomics analysis showed
seven genes including IFNAR2 and IL10RB whose genetically regulated expression were
significantly associated with COVID-19 across multiple tissues (Supplemental Table S6). For
example, the IFNAR2 gene was associated with COVID-19 across six tissues including lung (P =
2.44 × 10-4). The IL10RB gene showed associations with COVID-19 across 24 tissues with the most
significant tissue of cells-transformed fibroblasts (P = 2.80 × 10-5).

We further used S-MultiXcan to meta-analyze the tissue-specific associations from S-PrediXcan
across 49 GTEx tissues, and found these 11 genes whose expression were significantly associated
with COVID-19, which support our results from the MAGMA analysis (Figure 3c and Supplemental
Table S7). Additionally, our in silico permutation analysis also showed that genes identified from
MAGMA analysis had a significantly higher overlap with S-MultiXcan-identified genes than random

events (P < 1 × 10-5; Figure 3d).

2.5. IFNAR2 and IL10RB specially expressed in immunity associated cell types in lung tissue
To examine the links between tissue-specific gene expression profiles and COVID-19 gene
associations, we conducted a MAGMA gene-property analysis in 53 specific tissue types and 30
general tissue types. We found that the association signals were enriched in lung, thyroid, and
esophagus tissue in 30 general tissue types (Supplemental Figure S4a). In the analysis of 53 specific
tissues, COVID-19 gene associations were also enriched in lung, cultured fibroblasts, and thyroid
(Supplemental Figure S4b). These results suggest that these identified genes for COVID-19 may
have important functions in lung tissue.

Using 50 cell populations across four compartments (epithelial, endothelial, stromal, and
immune) of lung tissue, we identified the primarily expressed cells of these 11 risk genes associated
with COVID-19 (Figure 4, Supplemental Table S4, and Supplemental Figure S5). The HNRNPK
gene was widely expressed in various cell types across all four compartments (Supplemental Figure
S6). However, the majority of IFNAR2-expressing cells were dendritic cells (40%) and plasmacytoid
dendritic cells (38.5%) (Figure 4). The IFNAR2 was also expressed within lipofibroblast (20%),
ciliated (19.1%) and nonclassical monocyte (18.5%), albeit at diminished abundance compared with
dendritic cells; IL10RB was primarily expressed within nonclassical monocyte (29.6%).
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells produce large amounts of type I interferons-proteins that are important
for immunity to viruses

[10]

. Our data indicated that IFNAR2 and IL10RB could play regulatory roles

in the pulmonary immune response.

2.6. Potential drugs targeted with IFNAR2 and IL10RB
By performing a drug-gene interaction analysis and literature mining, we found that seven of 11
COVID-19-associated genes (63.6%) were enriched in five potential “druggable” gene categories
(Supplemental Table S8 and Supplemental Figure S7). The gene of CCR9 is targeted by two
FDA-approved drugs including hydroxyurea and hydralazine (Supplemental Table S9). There are
nine FDA-approved drugs showing agonist-receptor interactions with IFNAR2 (Supplemental Table
S9), including interferon alfa-2a, interferon alfacon-1, and interferon beta-1a, which could be useful
alone or in combination with other antiviral drugs for treating SARS-CoV infection [11]. Loutfy et al.
[12]

reported that interferon alfacon-1 plus corticosteroids showed association with improved oxygen

saturation and more rapid resolution of radiographic lung opacities than systemic corticosteroid alone
in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Treatment with interferon has shown preliminary
benefits for patients with COVID-19 [13] and is being evaluated by numerous ongoing clinical trials.
The IFN-beta treatment could effectively block SARS-CoV-2 replication

[14]

. The IL10RB gene is

targeted by peginterferon lambda-1a (Supplemental Table S9), which has been designed to treat mild
COVID-19 in a clinical trial (identifier: NCT04331899). These results suggest that interferons
associated with IFNAR2 and IL10RB exert potential effects on the treatment of COVID-19.

3. Discussion
Using a meta-analytic method to combine two existing GWAS summary datasets with a
large-scale sample size, we validated two reported genetic loci on chromosome 3p21.31 and 9q34.2

to be significantly associated with COVID-19 infection, and found a novel locus at a chromosome
21q22.11 gene cluster conveying susceptibility of COVID-19.

On chromosome 21q22.11, the peak association signal covered two genes of IFNAR2 and
IL10RB, which have biological functions that probably related to COVID-19. IFNAR2 encodes a
type I membrane protein, which forms one of the two chains of a receptor for interferons alpha and
beta. The deficiency of IFNAR2 supports an essential role for interferons alpha and beta in human
antiviral immunity

[15]

. Notably, dysregulation of type I interferon response has been observed in

COVID-19 patients [16]. Impaired type I interferon activity in the blood could be a hallmark of severe
COVID-19

[17]

. Furthermore, IFNAR2 is required for anti-influenza immunity and related to the risk

of post-influenza bacterial superinfections

[18]

. As for IL10RB, its encoded protein belongs to the

cytokine receptor family and is an accessory chain essential for the active interleukin 10 receptor
complex. Variants in IFNAR2 and IL10RB gene were associated with the susceptibility to hepatitis B
virus (HBV) infection

[19]

. Most recently, the interferon pathway is identified to be targeted by the

COVID-19 viral protein of Nsp13 [20].

Functional enrichment analysis showed that cytokine-related pathways including cytokine
receptor activity, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and chemokine signaling pathway were
significantly enriched by genes associated with COVID-19. Seven risk genes of IFNAR2, IL10RB,
XCR1, CXCR6, CCR9, CCR1, and GNG12 have implicated in these pathways. There were four genes
encoding chemokine receptors, including the X-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (XCR1), the C-X-C
motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), the CC motif chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9), and the CC
motif chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1). Vaccine molecules targeting XCR1 on cross-presenting
dendritic cells enhance a protective CD8+ T-cell responses against influenza virus

[21]

potentially play important roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection, and more relevant
studies should be performed to explore the underlying biological mechanisms.

With regard to the novel gene of HNRNPK, it belongs to the subfamily of ubiquitously expressed
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP), of which proteins have important roles in cell
cycle progression. HNRNPK acts as a central hub in the replication cycle of multiple viruses
including HCV

[25]

. An interaction of HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 with hepatitis E virus (HEV)

promoters has important roles in HEV replication

[26]

. Two cellular RNA binding proteins of

hnRNPK and NS1-BP have important roles in regulating influenza A virus RNA splicing [27]. As for
the RMI1 gene, its protein is an essential component of the RMI complex, which has a crucial role in
DNA repair and maintaining genome stability

[28]

. Since there existed important functions of these

identified genes, molecular studies are warrant to illustrate the functional consequences of detected
association signals.

The power of our study is limited by the difference in study design between the two datasets we
analyzed: the COVID-19 Host Genetic Consortium included patients with mild or severe COVID-19
but the Ellinghaus et al.

[8]

study only included severe COVID-19. Because most of the COVID-19

infected individuals are asymptomatic, population-based controls used in the original studies may
contain a substantial proportion of asymptomatic patients, which further reduced the power of our
meta-analysis. Due to data from the two included GWASs were based on summary statistics, the
population stratification was not assessed in the current meta-analysis. For the Ellinghaus et al.

[8]

study, to examine for population stratification within and across Italian and Spanish panels, a
principal component analysis (PCA) was performed by using the FlashPCA [29]. Covariates from 10
PCA were conducted to control for potential population stratification (COVID_I). As for the ANA5
GWAS summary data from the COVID-19 Host Genetic Consortium constructed by 10 contributing
studies, the strategy of population stratification is unknown.

4. Conclusions
In summary, our findings uncover 21q22.11 as a novel risk locus for COVID-19 susceptibility
and implicate the potential role of interferons targeting IFNAR2 and IL10RB in the treatment of
COVID-19. Individuals with the G alleles of rs9976829 have a 16% greater chance of COVID-19
infection compared with these carrying no such allele. The efficacy and the safety of interferon
products are still being evaluated by numerous ongoing clinical trials, which may be strengthened by
subgrouping the patients according to their genotypes of the IFNAR2 and the IL10RB loci. Further
studies are needed to delineate current findings and understand the underlying pathophysiology of
COVID-19.

GWAS summary data from Ellinghaus et al. (Dataset #1)

For this GWAS recently reported by Ellinghaus et al.

[8]

, there were 1,980 patients with severe

COVID-19 enrolled from seven hospitals in the Italian and Spanish epicenters of the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic in the Europe. A total of 2,381 control participants were enrolled from Italy and Spain.
After stringent quality control and excluding population outliers, 1,610 patients with COVID-19 with
respiratory failure (835 Italian and 775 Spanish COVID-19 cases) and 2,205 control participants
(1,255 Italian and 950 Spanish controls) were included in the final GWAS. In total, 8,965,091
high-quality SNPs (post imputation R2≥ 0.6 and minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 1%) were included
in the Italian cohort and 9,140,716 high-quality SNPs in the Spanish cohort. The GWAS summary
statistics (COVID_I) are publicly available in the website (www.c19-genetics.eu). For more detailed

Meta-analysis of GWAS summary data
By using the meta-analysis tool of METAL [30], a fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed to
identify risk genes for COVID-19 across two GWAS summary datasets (Dataset #1: COVID_I
GWAS summary statistics, and Dataset #2: ANA5 GWAS summary statistics). After removing
low-quality and non-matched SNPs, there were 8,424,883 high-quality SNPs with a MAF ≥ 1% and
imputation R2≥ 0.6 that were common to both datasets with the use of effect-size estimates (BETA)
and their standard errors (SE) for the meta-analysis. With regard to the genome-wide meta-analysis,
we adopted the widely-used threshold of 5×10-8 for combined P values to determine statistical
significance. As reported in Ellinghaus et al. [8], we used the combined P value and combined effect
(E) with its SE generated by the METAL to compute the odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence
interval (CI): 1) OR = exp (E); 2) the upper confidence limit (OR_95 U) = exp (E + 1.96*SE); 3) the
lower confidence limit (OR_95L) = exp (E - 1.96*SE). The qqman package in R platform was used
to generate Manhattan plot and quantile-quantile (QQ) plot. The web-access tool of LocusZoom

[31]

was used to visualize regional association plots (http://locuszoom.sph.umich.edu/).

Gene-based association analysis

We conducted a gene-based association analysis of our meta-GWAS summary data for
COVID-19 by using the Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA)

[32]

, which

utilizes a multiple regression method to identify multi-marker aggregated effects that account for
SNP P values and linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs. The analyzed SNP set of each gene
was based on whether the SNP located in the gene body region or within extended +/- 20 kb
downstream or upstream of the gene. The LDs among SNPs were calculated based on the 1,000
Genomes Phases 3 European Panel [33]. The Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method
was used to correct the association results for multiple testing. The P value threshold of 1.86 ×10-5
was applied.

Functional enrichment analysis

To annotate the molecular functions and biological pathways of these COVID-19-associated
genes (Supplemental Table S2), we performed a functional enrichment analysis by using the
WebGestalt tool [34] based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and
gene ontology (GO) terms. Using the overrepresentation analysis, the WebGestalt could identify
functional association between COVID-19-associated genes and KEGG pathways. Furthermore, GO
enrichment analysis was performed by using 3 categories of GO terms: biological process, cellular
component, and molecular function. The redundancies of GO-terms were removed. The
hypergenometric test was applied to assess the statistical significance. P values were corrected for
multiple testing using the FDR, and a P value threshold of 2.9 ×10-4 was applied.

We performed a MAGMA gene-property analysis

[32]

, which is implemented in FUMA [35]. The

gene expression data from 83 tissues GTEx RNA-seq data (version 8) were used to parse the gene
expression profiles. Expression values (TPM) were log2 transformed and average expression values
were adopted per tissue. The gene-property analysis was conducted for 53 specific tissue types and
30 general tissue types, respectively. Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was used for the
examined tissue types.

Single-cell RNA-seq analysis for lung tissue

We performed single-cell data analysis from normal lung tissue sequenced by using Smart-Seq2.
This data set is a part of the Human Lung Atlas

[36]

, consisting of 50 cell populations across 4

compartments (epithelial, endothelial, stromal, and immune) of lung tissue. All 9,404 cells with
distinct cellular identities were download from the Human Lung Atlas. Cells from 3 donors with
FACS-sorted strategy were available at the Synapse (accession numbers: syn22168639,
syn22168625, and syn22168622).

S-PrediXcan and S-MultiXcan analysis

We applied S-PrediXcan

[37]

to integrate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data with

genetic associations from GWAS summary statistics to identify genes, which genetically predicted
expression levels are associated with COVID-19. S-PrediXcan firstly estimates gene expression
weights by training a linear prediction model (MASHR model) in samples with both SNP genotype

and gene expression data. These estimated weights are processed with beta values and standard
errors from meta-GWAS summary data on COVID-19 to predict gene expression from GWAS
summary statistics, while combining the variance and co-variance of SNPs from an LD reference
panel based on the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 genotypes [33]. The eQTL data for 49 tissues from
the GTEx Project (version 8) were used in the current analysis. S-PrediXcan was performed for each
of 49 tissues for a total of 659,158 gene-tissue pairs. To increase power to identify genes whose
expression is similarly differentially regulated across tissues, we meta-analyzed the S-PrediXcan
results with the use of the S-MultiXcan method

[38]

, which employs multivariate regression to

integrate evidence across 49 GTEx tissues with a total of 22,327 genes. Significant associations were
determined by using Bonferroni correction.

Sherlock-based integrative genomics analysis

To further validate these identified host genes for COVID-19, we also applied an independent
approach of Sherlock-based integrative genomics analysis based on a Bayesian inference algorithm
[39]

. The Sherlock-based integrative analysis incorporates genetic information from meta-GWAS

summary statistics on COVID-19 with eQTL data across 49 tissues from the GTEx Project (version 7)
to prioritize important risk genes. It should be noted that Sherlock employs different algorithm and
strategies to perform the statistical inference compared with S-PrediXcan. Briefly, Sherlock first
searches expression-associated SNPs (named as eSNPs) across different GTEx tissues. Then,
Sherlock estimates the possible association of eSNPs with COVID-19 using our meta-GWAS
summary data. Sherlock computes individual Logarithm of the Bayes Factor (LBF) for each SNP

pair, and the sum of these constitutes the final LBF score for each gene. There are three potential
scenarios: 1) if an eSNP in a given gene showed a significant association with COVID-19, a positive
score would be assigned; 2) if an eSNP in a given gene showed a non-significant association with
COVID-19, a negative score would be assigned; 3) no score was assigned if an SNP was not eSNP
but showed a significant association with COVID-19. The Sherlock applied the simulation analysis
to compute the p value of the Bayes factor for each gene, as reference of a method of
Bayes/non-Bayes compromise

[40]

. We used the Bonferroni correction method to correct the

significance for multiple testing. Due to we tested the Sherlock analysis in 49 GTEx tissues, there
existed different thresholds across tissues. For example, the P value threshold was 6.64 ×10-6
(0.05/7,529) for lung tissue.

In silico permutation analysis

To determine whether there exist a higher overlapped rate of genes identified from MAGMA
analysis (Gene set #1: N = 1,005, P < 0.05) with genes from S-MultiXcan analysis (Gene set #2: N =
1,141, P < 0.05) than that from random selections, we conducted a computer-based permutation
analysis of 100,000 times of random selections
Gen sets #1 and #2 (N

observation).

[41]

. First, we counted the overlapped genes between

Secondly, we used all tested genes from S-MultiXcan analysis as

background genes (N background = 22,326 genes). Then, through randomly selecting the same number of
genes as Gene set #2 from background genes to compare with Gene set #1 for 100,000 times, we
counted the number of overlapped genes in each time (N

random).

In the third step, we summed the

counts of N observation ≤ N random and divided by 100,000 to calculate empirically permuted P value. P <

0.05 is considered to be significant.

Drug-gene interaction analysis

We submitted these 11 COVID-19-associated genes into the widely-used Drug Gene Interaction
Database (DGIdb v.3.0.2; http://www.dgidb.org/) to identify drug-gene interactions with Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pharmaceutical compounds as well as antineoplastic and
immunotherapies drugs depended on 20 databases with 51 known interaction types, and search 10
databases to find genes with potential drug abilities.
