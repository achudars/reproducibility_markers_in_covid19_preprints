Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 lineage carrying the amino acid change D614G has become the dominant variant in the
global COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid spread of the G614 mutant suggests that it may have a
transmission advantage over the D614 wildtype. Using our previous epidemiological framework to
analyze COVID-19 surveillance and sequence data, we estimated that the G614 mutant is 31% (28-34%)
more transmissible than the D614 wildtype. As such, interventions that were previously effective in
containing or mitigating the D614 wildtype (e.g. in China, Vietnam, Thailand, etc.) might be less
effective against the G614 mutant. Our framework can be readily integrated into current COVID-19
surveillance to monitor the emergence and fitness of mutant strains, such that pandemic surveillance,
disease control and development of treatment and vaccines can be adjusted dynamically.

Recent studies of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have identified various mutations associated with different
emerging genetic clades. Two major clades were initially reported near the end of first wave of COVID19 outbreak in China 1, and soon the development into pandemic was accompanied by reports of several
more clades featuring different mutations among the countries 2. Some clades are found to be associated
with difference in viral phenotypes and immunological reaction from patients 3, highlighting the viral
genetic determinants of the outbreak progression and management, and importance of monitoring and
assessing emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2.
One of the notable variations, the D614G mutation, encodes a change from aspartic acid to glycine in the
carboxy-terminal region of the S1 domain of the viral spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Notably, the
detection of the mutant G614 has increased rapidly since late February 2020 and G614 is now the
dominant subtype circulating in most parts of world 4-7. The rapid spread of G614 suggests it may have a
transmission advantage over the wildtype D614 in terms of faster growth rate due to higher reproductive
number or shorter generation time or both 8. This hypothesis is corroborated by several in vitro studies
which showed that the D614G mutation is correlated with increased infectivity in cell models 9-12. Recent
phylogenetic analysis also showed the evidence of diversifying selection at the site 614, suggesting the
potential transmission advantage of D614G 13,14. However, limited assessment has been conducted to date
to quantify the epidemiological fitness of G614 compared with its wildtype predecessor D614 15. Here we
used our previous epidemiological framework for fitness inference of influenza strains 16 to analyze
COVID-19 surveillance and sequence data and characterize the comparative transmissibility of the G614
mutant.
Results
Identification of D614 and G614 co-circulating clusters
The global phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 shows multiple genetic clades and their associated genomic
mutations, of which the clade with G614 mutation is by far the largest (Figure 1). We assumed that the
mutation D614G is the only site of interest that potentially confers a transmission advantage and obtained
35,377 sequences collected between 24 December 2019 and 8 June 2020 which covered the 614th
position (i.e. either D614 or G614) in the translated amino acid sequences of the spike gene 4. We
identified phylogenetic clusters of local transmissions in each country from the context of global SARSCoV-2 phylogeny (see Methods and Figure S1). Each cluster approximately stemmed from one or a small
number of introduction events, and included at least two sequences by our definitions. We included
countries with both D614 and G614 variants co-circulated in their respective (phylogenetically evidenced)
locally sustained transmission clusters for a period of at least two weeks (i.e. at least two disease

generations, assuming the mean generation time of 5-7 days). To minimize potential bias due to
stochasticity in sampling, we only included countries with 100 or more sequences during the cocirculation period. Ten countries, namely Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Iceland, India, Netherlands,
Spain, Portugal, the UK, and the US fulfilled these criteria and were included in our further analysis. In
these ten countries, 515 D614 clusters and 1,420 G614 clusters among 10,915 sequences were identified,
and the G614:D614 ratio increased over time and the G614 mutant rapidly became the dominant strain in
these countries (Figure 2).
Inference of the G614 fitness in transmission
Let

be the ratio of the basic reproduction number of the G614 strain to that of the D614 strain, and  be

the ratio of the mean generation time of the G614 strain to that of the D614 strain. We assumed that the
mean generation time of the D614 strain was 5.4 days 17. Given that the G614 mutant has displaced the
D614 wildtype globally, we assumed

 1 and   1. Using confirmed deaths (adjusted for the delay

between onset and death) as the proxy for the COVID-19 epidemic curve, we estimated that

was 1.31

(95% CrI 1.28-1.34) and  was 0.99 (0.96-1.00) across the ten countries. That is, the basic reproductive
number of the G614 mutant was 31% (28-34%) higher than that of the D614 wildtype, and the mean
generation time of the two strains were essentially the same. The fitted model was congruent with the
observed proportions of G614 isolates over time in all ten countries (Figure 3). If we used confirmed
cases instead of confirmed deaths as the proxy for the COVID-19 epidemic curve (Figure S2 and Figure
S3), then

was 1.23 (95% CrI 1.19-1.26) and  was 0.96 (0.90-1.00).

To assess potential geographical heterogeneity in the transmission advantage of the G614 mutant, we
allowed

to differ among the US, the UK and the remaining locations and reran the inference. The

resulting estimates for

was 1.13 (1.09-1.16), 1.53 (1.28-1.58), and 1.30 (1.19-1.42) for the US, the UK,

and other locations, respectively, with  = 0.99 (0.93-1.00).
In the fitness estimation, by reconstructing co-circulating clusters of D614 and G614 using phylogenetic
methods, we were able to exclude sequences from importations that generated no or limited secondary
infections. However, the global phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that most countries in Europe
(such as UK 18) and the US received overwhelming importations of G614 since late February, possibly
from countries with largely undetected outbreaks dominated by G614. To assess the effects of dominant
introductions of G614, we incorporated G614 importation in the fitness estimation by specifically
assuming the imported infections consisted of G614 only and the imported G614 force of infection was

 times of the local COVID-19 incidence rate (see Methods). We performed a sensitivity analysis on
sequences from the UK, which is among the countries with the largest number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes

made available to the public (Figure 4). The resulting estimate of  was 0.0012 (0.001-0.0035),
suggesting that the dominant G614 importations was not driving the increase of G614 over time in UK
(Figure S4). Similarly, assuming  was the same in all the ten selected countries, the resulting 
estimate was 0.0172 (0.0028-0.0271, Table S1).
Although G614 introductions occurred later, more clusters with G614 were reconstructed in the ten
selected countries and these clusters were larger on average. However, the size of clusters strongly
depended on the sampling scheme and sequencing priority in each country. To assess the effects of
sampling frequency in the G614 fitness estimation, we performed a sensitivity analysis on sequences from
the UK. We included only clusters with at least 2, 3, 5, 10 or 20 different patient sequences in the fitness
estimation (Figure 4). We found that estimates of
20 sequences. The estimations of

were also not sensitive to the definitions of phylogenetic topology (i.e.

“strict” and “relaxed” definitions; see Methods and Figure S1) used to identify the D614 and G614 local
transmission clusters (Figure 4).
Effects of G614 fitness in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics
The inferred value of

for the D614 wildtype. For example, if mixing is homogeneous, the excess is 1 

excess) if ,

3. More robust estimates of

herd immunity threshold would require accounting for heterogeneities in age-dependent physical mixing,
susceptibility, infectiousness, etc. 19
Although the above results suggested that there is no difference between the generation time of the two
strains, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the possibility that the transmission advantage of
G614 was entirely due to shorter generation time, i.e.   1 and

1. The resulting estimate of  was

0.80 (0.75-0.86), i.e. the mean generation time of G614 was 20% (14-25%) shorter than that of D614.
However, this fitted model had significantly higher AIC than our base case model, hence supporting our
base case conclusion that the mean generation time of the two strains were essentially the same and the
transmission advantage of the G614 mutant was entirely due to higher infectivity.
Compared with Australia and US, the countries in Europe suffered from earlier introduction of the G614
strain (Table 1). The proportion of G614 infections reached 19-74% in late February to early March for
countries in Europe. Similarly, more detailed breakdown of US data showed that New York State had

earlier introduction of G614 compared with Washington State. Assuming 

1, we estimated that was

1.25 (1.20-1.30) for the Washington State, but the G614 fitness was not estimated for the New York State
due to the lack of co-circulating clusters of both strains.
Discussion
Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 strain with the G614 mutation is 31% more transmissible than the
wildtype D614 strain. Such increase in fitness propels the G614 strain to displace the wildtype D614
strain and became the dominant strain in Europe within 2 months after its first detection. Our findings are
consistent with the differential growth rates of D614 and G614 lineages estimated from the a different
phylodynamic analysis in UK 7,15: G614 lineages grow at a rate 1.21 (logistic model; 95% CI 1.06-1.56)
times of that of D614. Our results are also largely consistent with the rate at which COVID-19 was
resurging in Beijing in comparison to the spread of the D614-dominant first wave in January-February.
Whole genome sequencing showed that the strain causing the June wave in Beijing was genetically
closest to the virus isolates in Europe with G614 20. While 156 local cases were reported between 12 and
31 January for the D614-dominant first wave, 325 local cases were reported between 11 and 30 June for
the G614-dominant outbreak. This suggests that the latter was more transmissible given that Beijing had
remained extremely vigilant with COVID-19 surveillance and control since mid-January, though
intensive community testing was organized only in June and thus more mild infections might have been
identified.
We estimated that IFRs were not statistically significant in locations where COVID-19 circulation was
predominated by G614, though data were limited (Table S2). Although the virus with G614 seems to
cause more mild and asymptomatic infections in Beijing’s Xinfadi outbreak, intensive community testing
was organized only in June (and thus more mild infections might have been identified) 21: 96.1% (246/256)
of confirmed cases were mild or moderate in June, which was higher than 86.7% (216/249) during the
first wave 22; 7.9% (22/278) of confirmed infections were asymptomatic in June compared with 5.0%
(13/262) during first wave 22.
Our base case results suggest that  of the G614 strain would be approximately 1.3 times that of the
D614 strain which had been estimated to be 2-2.5 using Wuhan data 23,24. This is consistent with the
recent  estimates of 3-4.5 in Europe and US where G614 is dominant 25,26. Taken together, these results
imply that control measures that were sufficient for controlling D614-dominant outbreaks in mainland
China would only be 70% as effective against G614-dominant outbreaks. For instance, social distancing
interventions were reported to reduce 79% of contacts in Shanghai during the first wave 27, which might
not be sufficient for Shanghai’s fast and successful suppression of the first wave by mid-February if 

were 3-4.5. By the same token, the critical vaccination coverage (which is equivalent to the herd
immunity threshold) for G614 would be higher than that for D614. An alternative and less probable
explanation for the faster doubling time of the G614 strain was that there was no change in R0 but the
mean generation time of the G614 mutant was around 20% shorter than that of the D614 wildtype. Using
the first wave data of mainland Chinese city Guangzhou, we previously estimated that possibly 44% of all
COVID-19 infection events were pre-symptomatic transmission and 95% of all transmission would have
taken place by day 5 after symptom onset 28. If the G614 virus were to spread faster but cause slightly
milder illness, its current dominance would require more rapid response (20% faster) in contact tracing
and testing to control any outbreak even at the very early stage. However, in this scenario, the critical
vaccination coverage for the two strains would be the same because there is no difference in R0 29.
Our study has several limitations. First, we only considered the D614G mutation and simply categorized
the sequences on GISAID by aligning the spike protein region that contains the locus. We did not
consider mutations in other loci that might provide necessary genetic background for D614G and act
synergistically to affect the fitness of G614. The mutant D614G was detected sporadically among local
cases in mainland Chinese provinces Guangdong and Zhejiang after February, but no sustained
circulation of G614 clusters had been detected in mainland China until the recent Xinfadi outbreak in
Beijing in June. The biological mechanism of increased spread of G614 is still unclear. Second, we
estimated the date of infection approximately by deconvoluting the time series of the dates of sampling
for sequence data or the dates of reporting of confirmed cases or deaths. Given the relatively high fitness
advantage of G614, the date of exposure or symptom onset should be used instead of the date of sampling
to generate more accurate fitness estimates, if clinical data of patients could be linked with sequences
available on GISAID. Third, our fitness estimation is only applicable when D614 and G614 strain
cocirculates, and therefore cannot be used to monitor the fitness of a newly emerged mutant strain that has
not yet spread in the community or has already dominated the community transmission. Fourth, our
method compares the relative fitness of two strains. We did not consider the scenario while three or more
strains cocirculate and their transmissions might interfere with each other. Although sustained G614
transmission was not detected previously in Guangdong and Zhejiang, the mutant strain might have
accumulated several necessary mutations chronologically and exhibited a gradual increase in fitness over
time. Categorizing all the sequences by D614 and G614 might have oversimplified the biological process
and mechanism.
In conclusion, we have shown that the G614 mutation confers a transmission advantage over the wildtype
D614. Monitoring the emergence of mutations and fitness of mutant strains are essential during the
COVID-19 pandemic because the spread of mutants can attenuate the effectiveness of outbreak response

and control interventions, such as development of therapy and vaccines. It is also important to acquire
thorough understanding of viral phenotypes, clinical and epidemiological characteristics of emerging
mutants like D614G of SARS-CoV-2, such that surveillance and disease control measures could be
adjusted dynamically to counter the evolving risks posed by dominant mutant clades. Our method can be
readily integrated into the analysis of phylogenetic data in the current COVID-19 surveillance system, to
provide efficient epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential of emerging mutants for early
alert.

Methods
Phylogenetic reconstruction of D614 and G614 clusters
For the convenience of mutation analysis, we first downloaded all the SARS-CoV-2 sequences submitted
on or before 15 June 2020 from GISAID 2. Multiple sequence alignment was constructed from the
downloaded sequences. Then we labeled each sequence with either “D614” or “G614” based on the
amino acid found at the 614th position in the translated amino acid sequences of the spike gene 4. We
excluded sequences with no explicit sample collection dates. In total, 35,377 sequences collected between
24 December 2019 and 8 June 2020 were used to construct the dataset. A phylogenetic tree was built
from these global sequences with high sequencing coverages of the genomes, using maximum likelihood
heuristic search and GTR+CAT nucleotide substitution model in FastTree v2.1.11 30.
We examined the global phylogeny to identify the different local transmission chains of D614 and G614
in each country, for the use in the fitness model described below. A strict monophyletic lineage of virus
strains from the same country was defined as a local transmission cluster (hereinafter “strict” definition,
Figure S1). A minimum of two sequences in such a cluster was considered as significant local
transmission. We included countries with such clusters respectively of D614 and G614 that have cocirculated for a period at least two weeks (i.e. at least two disease generations, assuming the mean
generation time of 5-7 days). To avoid potential bias due to stochasticity in sampling, we only included
countries with 100 or more sequences during the co-circulation period. We identified 515 D614 clusters
and 1,420 G614 clusters among 10,915 sequences in ten selected countries, namely Australia, Belgium,
Denmark, Iceland, India, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, the UK and the US. We also examined the effect
of different cutoffs for minimum cluster size (2, 3, 5, 10 and 20) in our inference.
Since the SARS-CoV-2 genomes evolved in a relatively slower rate and were intensively sampled, there
were many unresolved polytomic nodes in the phylogeny and identical sequences from different countries
31

. This could potentially break a larger local transmission cluster into multiple smaller ones based on the

above-mentioned “strict” definition. As such, we also considered a “relaxed” definition under which
cluster and non-cluster sequences were grouped into an aggregated cluster if they shared the same parent
nodes (Figure S1). We evaluated the sensitivity of our fitness estimates to the “strict” and “relaxed”
definitions. We also evaluated the sensitivity to the inclusion or exclusion of earliest sequence in each
cluster which may represent the potential index case for the cluster and was less likely derived from the
local sustained transmission chains.
The model.

We assume that the mutation D614G is the only site of interest that results in potential difference in
transmission advantage of SARS-CoV-2 throughout our analysis. We define the fitness of G614 as the

ratio of the basic reproduction number of the strain with G614 to the strain with D614, i.e.
/ .
We formulate the fitness inference framework under the following base case assumptions: (1) both D614
and G614 strains co-circulate locally during the period of fitness estimation; (2) non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs) have the same effect on the reproductive number of both strains; (3) the probability
that an infected person is selected for viral sequencing is the same for both strains; (4) recovery from
infection with either strain provides protection against reinfection of both strain during the period of
estimation; and (5) the fitness of G614 does not depend on age, and age-specific susceptibility to infection
is the same for both strains.
Under the base case assumptions, the next generation matrix (NGM) of infections by the G614 strain is
times that of the D614 strain. As the pandemic unfolds, the proportion of G614 infections at time  ,
denoted by , will increase towards 1 if >1, remain at the same level if =1 and decline towards 0 if
<1. In our previous work, we have shown that  can be well-approximated using the equation:



    
          1  

where  is the total incidence rate (i.e. including both strains),  and  are the generation time
distribution for D614 and G614 infections (assumed to be gamma distributions with  as the ratio of the
mean of  to that of  ), respectively. We assumed that  had mean 5.4 days and standard deviation
3.8 days (estimated from empirical data 17,32), and  and  had the same coefficient of variation.
To assess the effects of importations and introductions dominated by G614 since late February for most
countries in Europe and the US, we modified the equation for  to include an imported force of
infection by G614, which was  times of the local incidence rate:

Inference of the G614 fitness in transmission.
Our method requires two streams of data. The first data stream is the incidence rate  or its proxy, e.g.

deaths with the time between infection and confirmation or death. We denote this data stream by ̃ . In
the base case analysis, we obtained time series of COVID-19 confirmed deaths from situation updates
published by World Health Organization as the proxies. We assume that the distribution of the time
between infection and death is gamma with mean and standard deviation (SD) of 28 and 8.4 days (Figure
2). We use probability density function of the time from infection to deaths to deconvolute the time series
of the daily number of deaths to reconstruct an epidemic curve of daily number of new infections 33. We
only used the time series of COVID-19 confirmed cases in the sensitivity analysis because it is more often
confounded with temporal fluctuations in reporting rate and testing capacity 25, but our previous
simulations had shown that our method is robust against these fluctuations 16.
The second stream is the detections of D614G mutation where   and  are the number of SARS-CoV2 isolates among phylogenetic reconstructed clusters sampled on day  with D614 and G614 respectively
(Figure 2). Please refer to the previous section “Phylogenetic reconstruction of D614 and G614 clusters”
for details of cluster reconstruction. We selected data from ten countries which had cocirculation of D614
and G614, namely Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Iceland, India, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, the UK and
the US.
In the base case, we assumed there is 7 days of delay between infection and sample collection for
sequencing in the base case analysis. Similarly, we assumed on average the time between infection and
reporting is 7 days and the time between infection and death is 28 days. We performed a sensitivity
analysis of the time between infection and these key events: 1) we assumed the time between infection
and sampling is 5, 7, 9 and 12 days with coefficient of variation of 0.3; 2) we assumed the time between
infection and reporting is 5, 7, 9 and 12 days with coefficient of variation of 0.3; 3) we assumed the time
between infection and death is 21, 28, and 35 days with coefficient of variation of 0.3. The estimation of
G614 fitness is not sensitive to the assumptions about the time between infection and these key events.
We did not include China and other East Asian countries in the analysis because no continuous
cocirculation were detected in most Asian countries and there is not enough information from GISAID to
avoid misclassifying sequences from imported cases as those from local cases. We substitute    with

̃ and denote the approximation of  by . The approximate likelihood is

Supplementary information
The infection fatality risks in locations predominated by D614 or G614.
To test the hypothesis that the G614 mutation might affect the clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
we estimated the infection fatality risks (IFRs) as the ratio of laboratory-confirmed deaths to the estimated
number of infections in locations or settings with COVID-19 circulation predominated by D614 or G614.
The daily number of confirmed deaths were obtained from the websites of local public health agencies.
For locations where extensive contact tracing and testing had been conducted, the number of infections
were estimated as the number of reported infections; for locations where seroprevalence studies had been
conducted, the number of infections were estimated by the product of the seroprevalence and the
population size accordingly. We assumed on average it takes 21 days for infected individuals to develop
consistently detectable antibodies after infection 34, and the time between infection and deaths is 28 days
17

.

Among locations where COVID-19 circulation was dominated by D614, we estimated that IFR ranged
from 0.90% (0.75-1.06) in mainland Chinese provinces outside Hubei to 1.0% (0.40-2.04) among
passengers from the Princess Diamond Cruise (Table 2). The IFR estimates were lower but not
significantly different among locations where COVID-19 circulation was dominated by G614, ranging
from 0.43% (0.37-0.56) in Geneva, Switzerland to 0.83% (0.65-1.10) in New York City, US (Table S2).

Figure S1. Illustration of ‘strict’ and ‘relaxed’ definitions of transmission clusters reconstructed
with phylogenetic methods. Solid circles in red and blue colors are sequences from UK and France
respectively. In ‘strict’ definition, only multiple sequences from the same country sharing strictly
monophyletic relationship are considered as a transmission cluster. In ‘relaxed’ definition, cluster and
non-cluster sequences of the same country are aggregated into a larger cluster if they share the same
parent node (e.g. the open circle in the tree) even if it is a polytomy and consists of child nodes from
different countries.
