41

PARTICIPANTS

42

204 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were randomised in to treatment

43

group and control group, which was 102 patients each group.

44

INTERVENTIONS

45

In treatment group, Q-14 was administrated at 10g (granules), twice daily for 14 days

46

and plus standard care. In control group, patients were given standard care alone for

47

14 days.

48

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE

49

The primary outcome was conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 viral assay. Adverse events

50

were analyzed in the safety population.

51

RESULTS

52

Among 204 patients, 195 were analyzed according to the intention to treat principle.

53

There were 149 patients (71 vs. 78 in treatment group and control group respectively)

54

turning to negative via SARS-CoV-2 viral assay. No statistically significance showed in

55

conversion time between treatment group and control group (FAS: Median (IQR):

56

10.00 (9.00-11.00) vs. 10.00 (9.00-11.00); Mean rank: 67.92 vs. 81.44; P=0.051.).

57

T ime to recovery of fever was shorter in treatment group as compared in control

58

group. The disappearance rate of symptom in cough, fatigue, chest discomfort was

59

significantly higher in treatment group. In chest computed tomography (Chest CT)

60

examinations, overall evaluation of chest CT examination after treatment compared

61

with baseline showed more patients improved in treatment group .There were no

62

significant differences in the other outcomes.

63

CONCLUSION

64

Administration of Q-14 on standard care for COVID-19 was useful for improvement of

65

symptoms (such as fever, cough, fatigue and chest discomfort), while did not result in

66

a significantly higher probability of negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 viral assay. No

67

serious adverse events were reported.

INTRODUCTION

90

CoronaV irus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted

91

in considerable morbidity and mortality in more than 200 countries, which has

92

become a major public health crisis on a global scale (Wang et al., 2020). By August

93

24, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has reached more than 23

94

million, the total reported deaths now exceeds 800,000 globally, with rapid daily

95

increases in some countries (WHO, 2020). Information regarding the epidemiology

96

and clinical features of COVID-19 (Wu et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020) provides good

97

support for its clinical prevention and treatment, but many of the drugs previously

98

hailed

99

chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have not shown ideal results in clinical trials,

100

even some of them has been found to have obvious toxic side effects (Wang et al.,

101

2020; Tang et al. 2020). Scientists around the world are actively seeking potential

102

effective drugs or developing vaccine to treat COVID-19.

104

China quickly halted the spread of COVID-19 with strong containment measures (Li et

105

al., 2020). The strategy of integrated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with

106

western medicine plays an important role in the prevention and control of COVID-19

107

in China, more than 90% confirmed cases have received TCM therapy (SCIO-China,

108

2020). At the beginning of COVID-19, China National Medical Team of Traditional

109

Chinese Medicine of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (CNMTCM-CACMS

110

Team) went to Wuhan to carry out integrated TCM with Western medicine treatment

111

for COVID-19 in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, which is one of the hospitals receiving

112

most of COVID-19 patients. In the absence of specific drugs for an emerging

113

infectious disease, based on the theory of TCM with thousands of years of experience

114

in the prevention and treatment of infectious disease, in particular, accumulated

115

clinical experience of TCM in the SARS in 2003, Chinese medicine (Q-14) was

116

developed to clinical application for treatment of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Q-14,

119

National Administration of TCM of the People’s Republic of China developed

120

“National clinical practice guideline for COVID-19 in China” (NHC-NATCM-China

121

guidelines) (NHC-China, 2020), Q-14 is one of the main Chinese herbal preparations

122

for the treatment of COVID-19 in NHC-NATCM-China guidelines, which was widely

123

used in clinical practice during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. One of the

124

important ways to improve the international recognition of Chinese herbal medicine

125

is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine with

126

evidence-based medicine (Tang, 2006).

127
128

At the critical moment of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan of China, we conducted a

129

single-center, open label, randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety

130

of Q-14 in hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.

For primary outcome, the SARS-CoV-2 viral assay negative conversion time, we firstly

273

used W ilcoxon rank sum test to test the difference of SARS-CoV-2 viral assay negative

274

conversion time between treatment group and control group, and gave the medians

275

and IQR (interquartile range). Then, kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the

276

cumulative negative conversion rate and draw the survival curve, and the negative

277

conversion rate was compared among groups through log-rank test, the median time

278

and 95% CIs (confidence interval) were given, and the hazard ratios was estimated by

279

Cox regression model. Hazard ratios greater than 1 indicated that the negative

280

conversion rate of treatment group was higher than that of control group.

281
282

For secondary outcomes, the change of 7-point scale was tested by W ilcoxon rank

283

sum test. The rate of critical aggravation was tested by Pearson chi-square test. Both

284

blood routine and blood biochemistry outcomes were numerical data, which was

285

tested by t-test for normal distribution data and W ilcoxon rank sum test for

286

non-normal distribution data. Fever recovery time was tested by W ilcoxon rank sum

287

test. For symptom improvements, which meant the disappearance rate of cough,

288

chest tightness, headache, fatigue, and pharynx, we used the Pearson chi-square test.

289

For the chest CT outcome, the score of area and density for both ground glass and

RESULT

303

Patients

304

Of the 285 patients were assessed from February 27 to March 27, 81 did not meet

305

the eligibility criteria. Remaining 204 patients were randomised with a ratio 1:1 to

306

treatment group and control group. 195 patients were included in the FAS (Full

307

Analysis Set) (99 in treatment group and 96 in control group) (Figure 1).The mean age

308

was 54 years old, and 36.4% was male. Table 1 showed baseline demographic, clinical

309

characteristics of patients in treatment group and control group.

310
311

Primary outcome

312

Among 195 patients in FAS, 149 (76.4%) patients (71 treatment group, 78 control

313

group) had converted to negative before the cut-off day of analysis, and the

314

remaining 46 patients (28 treatment group, 18 control group) did not arrive a

315

conversion-to-negative result.

316
317

In the conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 viral assay, there was no significant difference

318

between treatment group and control group both in FAS and PPS (Per-protocol Set)

319

(FAS: n=149. Median (IQR): 10.00 (9.00-11.00) vs. 10.00 (9.00-11.00); Mean rank:

328
329

We found among the 116 participants with cardiovascular disease who reached

330

conversion-to-negative, the conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 viral assay is significantly

331

shorter in treatment group as compared with control group.(Median (IQR): 10.00

332

(9.00-11.00) vs. 10.00 (9.00-11.00); Mean rank: 51.63 vs. 65.61; P=0.022.). The

333

average time of conversion- to-negative showed some advantage in treatment group

334

(Mean (SD): FAS: 9.85 (1.42) vs. 10.54 (1.56) days). The median time to conversion

335

between treatment group and control group showed significantly difference (10.00

DISSCUSION

391

This clinical trial (conducted during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) is the

392

first registered randomised controlled trial evaluating administration of Q-14 in

393

hospitalized adult patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.

These

uncomfortable symptoms caused by COVID-19, such as fever, cough, fatigue and

400

At present, there is no definite antiviral drug to accelerate the probability of

401

negativeconversion for SARS-CoV-2 (Parvathaneni and Gupta, 2020; Yadav et al, 2020),

402

the development of a vaccine (Torreele, 2020; Wang et al., 2020) appears to be the

403

last straw for prevention and control of COVID-19. The development of new antiviral

404

requires a considerable length of time and effort for drug design and validation.

405

Clearly, not only will this take time, but everything is unknown. Administration of

406

Q-14 did not resultin a significantly higher probability of negativeconversion than

413

chest discomfort. In our study, the safety of Q-14 has been fully investigated. No

414

serious adverse events were reported except for diarrhea (8 cases of treatment group)

415

or other adverse reactions in some patients, which resolve themselves within a few

416

days. The overall clinical safety of a 14-day course of Q-14 administration is

417

documented.

419

On the other hand, we performed a subgroup analysis, an increase the probability of

420

421

course of Q-14 administration to the standard care in hospitalized adult patients with

significant, they were not particularly significant in terms of time (days). This is not

424

within our expectation, which is an interesting finding. Although we cannot rule out

425

the possibility of a chance finding, we think it may be related to the following factor.

426

The majority of COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular diseases are hypertensive;

427

Q-14 may have a certain targeted improvement effect on the pathological status of

428

hypertension addition of standard care. Molecular docking showed that baicalein and

429

quercetin were the top two compounds of Q14, baicalein had strong affinity for

430

SARS-CoV-2, and quercetin had strong affinity forACE2 3CL that indicated that

431

baicalein and quercetin might play an important role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2

432

(Tao et al., 2020) .Future clinical studies with a larger sample are needed to confirm

433

this effect of Q-14. COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases

434

experience disproportionately worse outcomes in mortality (Peng et al., 2020;

435

Golemi et al., 2020), the findings of this clinical study may provide an effective drug

436

for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Of course,

more rigorous clinical and basic research is needed to validate the speculation.

Chest CT is used for diagnosis of COVID-19, as an important complement to the

greater diagnostic value than RT-PCR tests. At the same time, it will be a very

443

important observational indicator to evaluate the curative effect for therapeutic

444

schedule. Not only that, scientists have proposed a non-invasive and quantitative

445

prognostic tool for predicting poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 based on CT

446

imaging (Wu et al.,2020). Our study found that after 14 days of treatment, Q-14 with

447

standard care can significantly improve abnormal chest CT changes of COVID-19

448

patients, decreased the score of ground glass area (characteristic chest CT change of

449

COVID-19) significantly. This result suggests that Q-14 has an important therapeutic

450

role in alleviating the condition of COVID-19 patients.

451
452

More and more clinical evidence shows the great role of TCM in the prevention and

453

control of COVID-19 (Hu et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020). From these

454

studies, we have not seen that Traditional Chinese medicine has a direct antiviral

455

effect in clinical practice, but its ability to quickly relieve clinical symptoms may be

456

closely related to the enhancement of the immune ability of the body.

457
458

LIMITATIONS OF STUDY

459

Some limitations existed in the present study. First, we did not set up a placebo as a

460

Q-14 control. In the context of the COVID-19 early outbreak in Wuhan, China, many

461

clinical trials related COVID-19 has yet to be better prepared because of Wuhan

462

quarantine, especially for Q-14 placebo. As we did not adopt stratify randomisation

463

according

464

difference between the two groups. This may have greatly influenced the conclusions

465

of this trial, placebo effect of Q-14 cannot be ruled out. Secondly, the open label

466

rather than double blind design, which may be resulted in possibility of biased

467

assessments. Thirdly, we began to determine SARS-CoV-2 RNA conversion from the

468

7th day of the intervention, which may have overlooked some patients who have

469

negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days. Finally, the specimens collected in

470

our trial for SARS-CoV-2 RNA determination were mostly from the upper respiratory

471

tract rather than bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which could result in false negative

CONCLUSION AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS

475

The introduction of TCM into the world is a demand of The T imes, which is the

476

worldwide urgent demand for TCM. This trial provides evidence to support a notable

477

improvement of typical uncomfortable symptoms caused by COVID-19, such as fever,

478

cough, fatigue and chest discomfort. Additional, a significant improvement of Chest

479

CT by the addition of a 14-day course of Q-14 administration to the standard care in

480

hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19. In the current situation, Q-14 may provide

481

safe and effective option for controlling the spread of COVID-19, or a solution with

482

Chinese characteristics. China's great success in prevention and control of COVID-19

483

has demonstrated the feasibility of Chinese Approach.
