Running head: COVID VACCINES AND CANNABIS
Abstract:
Background: Cannabis use is associated with problematic health-behaviors such as
excessive alcohol and tobacco use, and sedentary behavior. Here, we examined the
association between cannabis use history and an especially topical health-behavior,
willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
Methods: COVID-19 vaccine willingness was surveyed in a subset of participants from
the Tulsa 1000 Study, which is a longitudinal study of psychiatric treatment-seeking and
healthy control participants. We identified 45 participants who completed a COVID-19
vaccine questionnaire and reported more than 10 lifetime cannabis uses. Those
participants were compared to a group of 45 individuals with very light (<10) cannabis use
histories who were propensity score-matched on age, sex, income, and race. Two-group
t-tests and Bayes factor analysis on vaccine willingness were conducted between groups.
Exploratory correlation analyses were conducted on vaccine willingness and lifetime
cannabis use levels within the cannabis group only.
Results: Vaccine willingness did not differ between the two groups (t88=0.33, p=.74;
BF01=4.3). However, a negative correlation was identified within the cannabis group, such
that higher lifetime cannabis use histories correlated with less willingness to receive a
vaccine (rho43= -.33, p=.03).
Conclusions: Although vaccine willingness did not differ between the two matched
groups, preliminary evidence suggests that heavy lifetime cannabis use might indicate a
reluctance to engage in health-promoting behaviors like receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.

1.0 Introduction
On December 11th, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency
use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine1, thus becoming the first vaccine to
combat SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States. One specific challenge facing
vaccine uptake is the willingness of various subgroups of individuals to seek out and
consent to vaccination2. A recent study from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) on
intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine found that vaccine willingness differed by
sociodemographic factors. Generally, young adult women, non-Hispanic (black)
individuals, and people from lower socioeconomic standings were less likely to express
intent to become vaccinated3. Although the CDC did not stratify by drug use, a recent
epidemiological study found that cannabis users comprise a similar sociodemographic
profile4 to the CDC study on vaccine intent. Moreover, early data from Mellis and
colleagues suggests that a quarter of people with substance use disorders were
reportedly unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine5. Hence, we hypothesized here that
cannabis users may be reticent to receive the vaccine.
In light of early trends relating substance use with vaccine hesitancy5, substance
use more generally might serve as an indicator variable reflecting a lower likelihood to
engage in healthy behaviors. Previous research showed that relative to non-users,
cannabis users were more likely to engage in excessive alcohol and tobacco use6,7, and
have an unhealthy lifestyle like poor diet8, sedentary behavior9, and risky sexual and
driving behaviors10. Similar individuals were also found to have lower rates of seeking
preventative medical procedures like routine dental visits11, cancer screenings and
influenza vaccinations12,13. Reasons for these findings are likely multifaceted, including
the stigmatization of drug use14 and socioeconomic disparities that preclude access to
healthcare. The present study seeks to understand if unwillingness to receive a COVID19 vaccine might be one specific feature exhibited by cannabis users that reflects a lower
propensity to engage in health-promoting behaviors.
Soon after the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was granted emergency use
authorization, participants from our ongoing study of psychiatric treatment-seeking and
healthy participants (the Tulsa 1000 Study15) were surveyed on their willingness to
receive a COVID-19 vaccine. We then identified participants with cannabis use histories,
and hypothesized that cannabis users would be less willing to receive a COVID-19
vaccine relative to non-using peers. The goal here is to understand if cannabis users are
less likely to participate in a specific health-promoting behavior (i.e., vaccination). In doing
so, we are careful to not dismiss or stigmatize individuals who are hesitant to receive a
vaccine; individuals’ concerns related to a new vaccine should be compassionately
addressed. The insights gained from this study might help guide targeted vaccine
education efforts and encourage healthcare experts to have dialogues with these
populations to increase vaccine uptake16. Overcoming issues of vaccine willingness is
crucial in order to reach herd immunity levels in a timely fashion17, and to curb COVID-19
infection in vulnerable populations like substance users.

Participants from our longitudinal study of psychiatric populations (Tulsa 1000)
were re-evaluated on their health-behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Briefly, the
Tulsa 1000 study is an ongoing project examining the biological and psychosocial
features of treatment-seeking individuals with mood/anxiety, substance use, and eating
disorders (plus healthy controls). See Victor et al., 2018 for an overview of the study15. All
study procedures were approved by an institutional review board, and participants
provided written informed consent.
2.2 Baseline Assessment
Lifetime cannabis use history was collected at baseline prior to the pandemic via
the Customary Drinking and Drug Use Record (CDDR) survey18. Participants provided a
quantitative free response, and those data were transformed onto a log10-scale due to
departures from normality. Age, sex, income, and race were also collected via self-report
at baseline, and the average time between baseline cannabis use and follow-up vaccine
questionnaire measurement was four years and six months.
2.3 Follow-up Assessment
The follow-up assessment involved Remote data collection from December 28th,
2020 to January 27th, 2021 and was conducted using REDcap tools. Participants
completed online questionnaires surveying their COVID-19 related experiences and
health-behaviors, including their willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Specifically,
participants were asked, “How much do you agree with the statement: I am willing to be
vaccinated for COVID-19”. Responses were measured on an ordinal scale, from
1=completely disagree to 5=completely agree. A coarse measure of recent cannabis use
was collected as part of the Coronavirus Health Impact Survey (CRISIS;
http://www.crisissurvey.org). This survey asked how frequently the participant used
cannabis in the past two weeks, and was measured on an ordinal scale, from 1=None to
5=Regularly. Current anxiety and depression symptom levels were also measured at
follow-up using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
(PROMIS)19 questionnaires.
2.4 Selected Participants
Using data collected up to January 27th 2021, a total of N=128 participants from
the original T1000 sample had provided lifetime cannabis use data at baseline and
responded to the COVID-19 vaccine questionnaire. From those 128, there were n=45
participants who had used cannabis more than 10 times in their lifetime, leaving n=82
participants with very light (≤10 lifetime uses) or no cannabis use histories to be selected
from during matching. It was not possible to match on a group of cannabis-naïve
participants only (zero lifetime uses), hence the threshold for lifetime uses was set at 10.
Next, a comparison group of individuals with very light cannabis use histories
(n=45) was identified using propensity score-matching20 via the ‘MatchIt’ library in R.
Variables used for matching included age, sex, income, and race (white vs. non-white).
After running propensity score-matching, independent samples t-tests were used to
confirm successful matching.

2.5 Statistical Analyses
Between-group comparisons on vaccine willingness was analyzed using an
independent samples t-test. Bayes factor analysis was then used to quantify the level of
support for the null (H0) vs. alternative (H1) hypothesis (hence, BF01) via the ‘BayesFactor’
library in R. Briefly, Bayes factors reflect the likelihood ratio between two competing
hypotheses (null over alternative), with the general consensus being values >3 indicate
‘substantial’ support for the null21. Lastly, the correlation between vaccine willingness and
lifetime cannabis use was calculated as an exploratory analysis within the cannabis use
group only.
3.0 Results:
Propensity score-matching successfully identified a similar group of individuals
with very light cannabis use histories (n=45). Although this comparison group contained
participants with some cannabis use (median 5 lifetime uses), the majority of individuals
in this sample were cannabis-naïve (n=26, 58%). Examination of past two-week cannabis
use data collected at the time of the vaccine survey confirmed that the cannabis group
used more cannabis in the past two weeks relative to comparators (Mann-Whitney
U=827, p=.04). However, most participants, regardless of group, reported no cannabis
use in the past two weeks. Furthermore, although both groups contained individuals
drawn from the mood/anxiety and healthy control populations from the larger T1000
study, participants from those populations were found to be balanced across the cannabis
and comparison groups. See Table 1 for information on group characteristics and
comparisons.
Vaccine willingness did not significantly differ between the two matched groups
(t88=.33, p=.74; Cannabis Group M=3.5, SD=1.6; Comparison Group M=3.6, SD=1.6).
Bayes Factor analysis suggested these results were roughly four times more likely under
the null hypothesis relative to the alternative (BF01=4.3). Lastly, within the cannabis group
only, a significant correlation was identified between vaccine willingness and lifetime
cannabis use levels (r43= -.33 , p=.03; Figure 1). Despite the ordinal nature of the vaccine
willingness data, results were reproduced using non-parametric statistics (Mann-Whitney
U=985, p=.81; cannabis group rank correlation rho43=-.33, p=.03). Lastly, vaccine
willingness was unrelated to current anxiety (r43=-.04, p=.77) or depression (r43=-.01,
p=.95) levels within the cannabis group.
4.0 Discussion:
In this study, we hypothesized that a group of individuals with high cannabis use
histories would be less willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine relative to a similar group
with very light cannabis use histories. Between-group analyses did not detect any
differences on vaccine willingness when comparing the cannabis group to a sample
matched on age, sex, income, and race. Bayes factor analysis provided substantial
support for the null hypothesis. Despite the lack of a between-group difference, the mean

values for vaccine willingness in each group suggested these participants were overall
neutral-to-moderately willing to receive a vaccine.
Although the between-group results do not necessarily point to a specific effect of
cannabis use, exploratory analyses restricted to the cannabis group suggested that
higher lifetime cannabis use was associated with lower vaccine willingness. Therefore,
heavy cannabis use might indicate a lower likelihood to engage in health-promoting
behaviors. Coupled with the average vaccine hesitancy displayed by both groups, these
results call for a need to encourage vaccine education and to address the concerns of
these participants as a means to potentially increase vaccine willingness16. Efforts to
readily vaccinate substance users are also needed because recent reviews suggest that
COVID-19 might be more debilitating among these individuals due to psychosocial
barriers to healthcare22 and an overrepresentation of comorbidities23 found among
substance users.
Strengths of this study include the use of propensity score-matching, which made
it unlikely that the matching variables confounded group membership or vaccine
willingness24. Although the T1000 study included anxious/depressed and healthy control
participants, the two groups studied here were found to be balanced on these populations
(table 1), and vaccine willingness was unrelated to current anxiety and depression
symptom levels. Nonetheless, it is possible that other psychiatric or physical health
comorbidities unaccounted for may have influenced the results. An additional strength
includes the use of Bayes factor analysis, which helped satisfy the shortcomings related
to null-hypothesis significance testing25 and provided a more intuitive way to interpret the
null findings.
Limitations of this study involve the heavy lifetime cannabis use levels within the
cannabis group. Hence, it is unclear if similar effects would be found in people with
intermediate cannabis use histories. Despite collecting a coarse measurement of recent
cannabis use at the time of vaccine willingness questionnaire, a continuous measurement
of cannabis use was only collected at baseline. Hence, this study is also limited by the
time gap between measurement of those two features. Additionally, participants were not
asked to elaborate on their reasons for or against becoming vaccinated, however, data
collection occurred just as vaccines were becoming available and skepticism over a new
vaccine may have been at its highest. Recent data from the CDC indicated that intent to
become vaccinated against COVID-19 may increase with time3. Thus, it is possible that
participants’ willingness may have evolved since data collection as they witnessed more
people receiving a vaccine. Future studies are needed to continue to monitor COVID-19
vaccine intent and uptake, as well as infection rates, among substance users. These
studies will help inform the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 within substance
users, and provide insights into combatting the pandemic within vulnerable populations.
