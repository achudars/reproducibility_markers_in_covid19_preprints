Abstract—word count: 50

17

To provide a safer environment for individuals working on-site at the Federal University of

18

Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil, we performed a large-scale mass testing SARS-CoV-2 program coupled

19

with variant genotyping using two PCR-based approaches. We observed a fast dominance of the

20

Gamma variant, displacing other variants in less than three months.

23

Continuous screening for SARS-CoV-2 active infections, coupled with contact tracing, could efficiently

24

reduce the viral transmission among the community(1). However, as virus variants with increased

25

transmission emerge, a rise of cases within affected regions is observed, demanding immediate actions for

26

blocking virus spread and consistent and continuous genomic surveillance for continuously evaluating

27

vaccination approches(2).

28

Brazil also showed consequences of the absence of genomic surveillance in a high seroprevalence

29

scenario. Gamma (B.1.1.28/P.1) variant of concern (VOC) emerged in Manaus, Brazil, within three-

30

quarters of the population positive for anti-N IgG, rapidly spreading over the city(3). This new variant

31

was able to displace his predecessor, the B.1.1.28/P.2 variant of interest (VOI), previously the major

32

lineage, among the wild one(4).

33

Extensive programs of routine asymptomatic screening for SARS-CoV-2 and follow-up sample

34

genotyping are mandatory to control the cases and prevent further infection surges(5,6). The use of

35

simplified approaches as multiplex qPCR provides a feasible, cost-effective way to discriminate samples

36

and prioritize whole-genome sequencing efforts(5,7). In order to achieve this goal, we performed large-

37

scale surveillance of infections and VOCs in the Federal University of Paraná community (students,

38

technicians, professors, outsourced workers, cohabitants, and their relatives). The study was approved by

39

the Research Ethics Committee (CAAE: 31687620.2.0000.0096).

40

The study

41

In order to perform mass screening and genomic surveillance, from October 10th, 2020, to May 24th,

42

2021, asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic individuals within the community of Federal University of

43

Paraná were called for voluntary participation by social media and e-mails. Saliva samples were collected

44

in a pre-labeled 2.0 mL microtube using an individually wrapped plastic drinking straw, stored at 4°C

45

storage until transport to the lab.

46

Each sample was homogenized and decanted for 30 minutes or centrifuged for 2 minutes (2.000 x g).

47

Following this period, 200 µL from each specimen were pooled(8) in groups of five. RNA extraction was

48

performed using an automated magnetic EXTRACTA - RNA and DNA Viral kit (Loccus Biotecnologia,

49

Brazil). Amplification was performed on an QuantStudio5™ instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,

50

USA) using AllPlex nCov-2019 RT-PCR Master Mix Kit (SeeGene, South Korea) or Molecular SARS-

51

CoV-2 EDx (Biomanguinhos/FioCruz, Brazil). The first kit include detection of the nucleocapsid (N),

52

envelope (E), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) virus genes, and a MS2-Phage spike-in as an

53

internal control gene and the second detect E virus gene and human RNaseP. Some positive individuals

54

were evaluated for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (IgM and IgG) after at least 15 days of RT-PCR

55

result. Serum samples were performed by COVID-19 IgG / IgM ECO Test (Ecodiagnóstica Brasil) lateral

56

flow immunochromatographic assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions(9).

57

Positive samples were further evaluated using two probe-based genotyping systems to detect VOCs

58

(Variants of Concern). The first one was the Vogels et al.(7) multiplex approach to detect Spike Δ69–70

59

and Orf1a Δ3675–3677 deletions as an outcome for distinguishing B.1.1.7, B.1.351 or P.1 and wild type

60

or other lineages(7). To this approach, we also included de CDC N1 target and defined the threshold of Ct

61

28 to evaluate the gene dropouts. The second involved three allelic discrimination TaqMan assays

62

(ThermoFisher, USA): N501Y (ANPRYZA), E484K (ANU7GMZ), and K417T (AN49ARF). The

63

proposed readout was: P.1 (K417T, N501Y, and E484K), P.2 (only E484K), B.1.1.7 (only E484K),

64

B.1.351 (N501Y and E484K, failure for K417T assay), and wild type/others for the absence of mutated

65

alleles. This second assay had the discrimination power to distinguish the B1.1.28/P.2 from the wild type

66

and the B.1.351/P.1. Both assays were performed using GoTaq® Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR System

67

(Promega) on an QuantStudio5™ instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA).

68

A total of sixteen collection dates were performed, with 12558 exams processed (Table 1), and 7249

69

people attended, since some participants engaged in more than one day of collection. The number of

70

participants in each collection date varied due to more widespread dissemination within the community,

71

increased service capacity, and engagement due to the perception of infection risk by the participants,

72

ranging from 162 to 1737 attendees. The overall positivity rate was 1,28% (161/12558). Comparing those

73

numbers to the Paraná state cases by epidemiological week of diagnosis (Figure A, blue bars), our

74

positivity followed the beginning of state's second SARS-CoV-2 infection wave (Figure A).

75

We performed a follow-up from 19 positive cases from December 4th (four participants) and December

76

18th (fifteen participants) with IgG and IgM serological tests. In only twice (one from each date), we

77

observed negative results for IgG after 15 days from RT-PCR positive result; all cases returned negative

78

for IgM. Seroconversion is not always observed after SARS-CoV-2 infection(10), raising questions

79

concerning the test's type and timing(11), besides the strength of the immune response in asymptomatic

80

individuals(12). Both observed cases of seroconversion failure were detected with Ct values above 30 and

81

one or two dropout targets in the multiplex RT-PCR (genes: E: non detected, RdRP: 34.7, N: 37.5 and

82

genes: E: non detected, RdRP: non detected, N: 38.2), indicating a lower viral load in the test moment.

83

After February 2021, since the profile of the asymptomatic cases became unrelated to the state

84

epidemiological curves, we started to evaluate retrospective and prospective all positive cases using

85

multiplex and singleplex genotyping approaches. From all 161 positive cases were evaluated, Vogels et

86

al. multiplex assay was invalidated in 46 (28.6%) against 50 (31.1%) in Thermo-Fisher three-assay allelic

87

detection approach. Comparing the original Ct value of detection, there is a depreciation of performance

88

in samples with Ct above 30 (Figure B), as stated in Thermo-Fisher manual. All cases were concordant

89

between the two assays, considering that Vogels et al. alone do not discriminate between wild type and

90

B1.1.28/P.2 VOI.

91

The first detection of the Gamma variant occurred on January 21th, 2021, less than two weeks after the

92

Manaus city healthcare system collapsed. The Gamma variant appeared at 9.1% incidence on this date,

93

increasing to 42.9% two weeks later (Figure C). This could be correlated to the following Curitiba city

94

healthcare system collapse and a surge of COVID-19 lethality in the Paraná state, reaching values above

95

5% in the following weeks. When the testing activities returned, all cases became Gamma variant,

96

completely displacing both B1.1.28/P.2 VOI and wild-type ones in three months.

97

Conclusions

98

Analysis of saliva in pools in the present study presents a cheap, easy to collect, and feasible

99

asymptomatic screening strategy. Thus, considering the transmission speed, until the vaccine is a large-

100

scale option, the risk of asymptomatic COVID-19 spread should become a public awareness, focusing on

101

social distancing. Our mass testing program was proposed to be accessible (since every test was free-of-

102

charge for the participant), trusted (as every participant received its result and positive cases had a follow-

103

up opportunity) and aimed to reach all social strata within the academic community (from professors to

104

outsourced employees – mainly composed by social, economic and ethnic vulnerable groups), key

105

characteristics to a strong mass testing system (13).

106

Both multiplex PCR and singleplex PCR approaches showed feasibility to evaluate the proportion of

107

variants within genomic surveillance, with speed and lower cost than whole-genome sequencing (WGS)

108

approaches. They do not replace WGS but could be an essential method to screen and select samples to

109

further variant classification. Nevertheless, those approaches could show the fast-spreading of a new

110

variant and predict COVID surges, acting as a lighthouse for wide-impact public health decisions.
