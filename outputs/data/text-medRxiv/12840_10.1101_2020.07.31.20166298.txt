Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread from a regional outbreak to a global pandemic in just a few
months. Global research efforts have focused on developing effective vaccines against SARSCoV-2 and the disease it causes, COVID-19. However, some of the basic epidemiological
parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R0,
across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical
model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European
countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented.
Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.19-0.29/day
(epidemic doubling times between 2.4-3.6 days). We discuss the current estimates of the mean
serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6-8 days in
the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated
the median R0 value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6
and 6.1 in the eight European countries. This translates to herd immunity thresholds needed to
stop transmission to be between 73% and 84%. We further analyze how vaccination schedules
depends on R0, the duration of vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and show that
individual-level heterogeneity in vaccine induced immunity can significantly affect vaccination
schedules.

Significance
With the global efforts to develop vaccines for COVID-19, it is important to understand the
contagiousness of the virus to design regional vaccination policy. To that end, we fit a
mathematical model to data collected from the early epidemic period in the United States and
eight European countries, estimating that the early epidemic doubles between 2.4-3.6 days. This
suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible in the absence of strong control measures
irrespective of heterogeneity in geographic and social settings. We estimated the median basic
reproduction number, R0 to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between
3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. The herd immunity needed to stop transmission is
high (between 73% and 84%).

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 is the infectious agent that causes COVID-19. It is originated in Wuhan city,
China in Dec, 2019 (1), and has spread rapidly causing the ongoing global pandemic. Initial
estimates of the rate of early epidemic spread in Wuhan, China suggested that the epidemic grew
at 0.1-0.14/day, leading to an epidemic doubling time of 5-7 days (2-5). However, using
domestic travel data and two distinct approaches, we estimated that the epidemic in Wuhan grew
much faster than initially estimated, and the growth rate is likely to be between 0.21-0.3/day
before lock-down was implemented, translating to a doubling time between 2.3 and 3.3 days, and
an R0 approximately at 5.7 with a confidence interval between 3.8 and 8.9 (6). However, it was
not clear whether SARS-CoV-2 can spread in other geographic locations as fast as in Wuhan,
China.
Accurate estimation of the rate of early epidemic growth is important for many practical
aspects. First, it is crucial for forecasting the epidemic trajectory, the burden on health care
systems (7, 8) and potential health and economic damage in the wake of potential second waves
of COVID-19 outbreak (9). Second, it sets the baseline for evaluation of effectiveness of public
health intervention strategies. Third, it is important for estimation of the basic reproductive

number, R0, which in turn is used for predicting the herd immunity threshold needed to stop
transmission (6, 10, 11). This is particularly pertinent to the development of vaccination
strategies, especially given the current global effort to develop effective vaccines (12).
A major challenge to the inference of the growth of COVID-19 epidemic is that as a result of
a fast-growing outbreak and a sizable infected population with no or mild-to-moderate symptoms
(13, 14), case confirmation data is influenced by many factors in addition to the true epidemic
growth, including substantial underreporting (15). Here, we argue that death and the cause of
death are usually recorded more reliably and are less affected by surveillance intensity changes
than case counts and that modeling the joint distribution of cases and deaths gives a more
accurate assessment of COIVD-19 dynamics. It is possible that deaths from COVID-19 are
underreported during very early phase of an epidemic when people are unaware of community
transmission of COVID-19 (16), during the relatively late phase of the epidemic when health
care system is overwhelmed (8), or for deaths in care homes. However, the underreporting is
unlikely to significantly affect the growth rate of deaths as long as the rate of underreporting
during the period between the early and the late phase of the epidemic remains roughly constant
(17). We fit mechanistic models to both case and death count data collected from the United
States (US) and eight European countries during this period, i.e. in early and mid-March, 2020
before broad interventions were established. We show that in most countries, COVID-19 spreads
very rapidly, leading to high estimated R0 values and consequently high herd immunity
thresholds in these countries. We further explore how vaccination schedules depend on the value
of R0 and the distribution of the duration of vaccine-induced immunity in a population, in the
context of the durations of protective immunity reported for SARS-CoV-2 (18, 19), as well as
other coronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (9, 20), SARS-CoV-1 (21-23) and
MERS-CoV (24).

Methods
Data
We collected daily case confirmation and death count data for the US and eight countries in
Europe from the John Hopkins CSSE (Center for Systems Science and Engineering) database
(https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The data is accessed and extracted on March
31, 2020. The data consists of time series of the cumulative number of case confirmations and
deaths by country. Daily incidences were derived from the cumulative counts. We used data
from the following countries: France (FR), Italy (IT), Spain (SP), Germany (GR), Belgium (BE),
Switzerland (SW), Netherlands (NT), United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US).
We included a subset of case and death count data for inference based on the two following
criteria. First, to minimize the impact of stochasticity and uncertainty in early data collection, we
used case confirmation incidence data starting from the date when the cumulative number of
cases was greater than 100, and used daily new death count data starting from the date when the
cumulative death count is greater than 20 in each country (see Table S1 and Fig. 1 for the period
from which data is included). Second, to estimate the early outbreak growth in each country
before control measures were implemented and at the same time maximize the power of
inference, we allowed a maximum of 15 days of data points for the two types of data, leading to
a maximum of 30 data points for each country. Note that the end date of incidence data used for
inference is at or close to the date when strong control measures were implemented in each
country (see Table S1), and thus the estimated growth rates represent the epidemic growth before
broad measures were implemented. We also tested the sensitivity of model predictions when

only 10, 13 days of data points are included for inference. The results are consistent across the
different numbers of data points used (Table S1).
Model
We construct a SEIR type model using ordinary differential equations (ODEs; see
Supplementary Text). We consider the exponentially growing phase of the outbreak and thus
make the common assumption that the susceptible population is constant over time. Then, the
total number of infected individuals 𝐼 ∗ (𝑡) = 𝐸(𝑡) + 𝐼(𝑡) can be expressed as:
(1)
𝐼 ∗ (𝑡) = 𝐼"∗ 𝑒 #$
where 𝑟 is the exponential growth rate of the epidemic (the growth rate for short below), and 𝐼"∗
is the number of total infected individuals at time 0, set arbitrarily as January 20, 2020. Note the
choice of the date of time 0 does not affect our estimation.
We solve the ODE model and derive the following expressions for the key quantities for
model inference (see Supplementary Text). The descriptions and values used for the parameters
in the ODE model are summarized in Table 1.
The true daily incidence of infected individuals, Ω(𝑡), can be expressed as:
𝛽(𝑘 + 𝑟) ∗ #$
(2)
Ω(𝑡) =
𝐼" -𝑒 − 𝑒 #($&') /
𝑟(𝑘 + 𝑟 + 𝛽)
where 𝛽 and 1/𝑘 are the transmission parameter of the virus and the latent period of infection,
respectively.
The daily new confirmed case count, Ψ(𝑡), is related to the true daily incidence, Ω(𝑡) as:
𝑚𝑔 𝑚
(3)
Ψ(𝑡) = 𝜃(𝑡) 2
3 Ω(𝑡)
𝑚𝑔 + 𝑟

where 𝜃(𝑡) is the detection probability, i.e. the fraction of newly individuals at time 𝑡 who are
later detected among all infected individuals. We assumed an Erlang distribution for the period
between infection and case confirmation (6), where 1/𝑔 and 𝑚 are the mean and the shape
parameter for the distribution.
The daily new death count, Φ(𝑡), is related to the true daily incidence, Ω(𝑡) as:
(4)
𝑛𝑑 )
Φ(𝑡) = 𝑋 2
3 Ω(𝑡)
𝑟 + 𝑛𝑑
where 𝑋 is the infection fatality ratio. Again, we assumed an Erlang distribution for the period
between infection and death (6), where 1/𝑑 and 𝑛 are the mean and the shape parameter for the
distribution.
We tested three different scenarios for surveillance intensity changes over time, modeled as
the detection probability, 𝜃(𝑡):
1) 𝜃 is a constant, i.e. no change over time;
$"

2) 𝜃(𝑡) = 𝑝*+) + (𝑝*,- − 𝑝*+) ) $ " ./" , i.e. 𝜃 is a Hill-type function of 𝑡;
3) 𝜃(𝑡) is equal to 𝑝*+) before 𝑡' , increases linearly to 𝑝*,- between 𝑡' and 𝑡0 and stay
constant at 𝑝*,- after 𝑡0 , i.e. 𝜃 is a semi-linear function of 𝑡.
Note that the time from infection to case confirmation, 1/𝑔, can be a time dependent function as
we and others have shown previously (6, 25). To keep the model simple, we implicitly assume
that the time dependent changes in 𝑔 can be included in the estimation of 𝜃(𝑡).
Parameter estimation

We fit the daily case count function Ψ(𝑡) and the death count function Φ(𝑡) to incidence data
and daily death data to infer the exponential growth rate of the infection (𝑟), the initial number
of total infected individuals at time, and the detection probability (𝜃$ ). Other parameter values
are fixed according to previous estimates (see Table 1). The error is calculated as the residual
sum of squares (RSS) between data and model predictions of incidence or death counts on a log
scale:

where 𝑋+ and 𝑋D1 are simulated and reported new cases at day i, respectively, and 𝑌+ and 𝑌
simulated and reported new death cases at day j, respectively. Note that Eqn. 5 assumes lognormal error distributions of the case and the death counts. We estimate the parameter values by
minimizing the RSS for each country.
To compare between models, we calculate the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) score for
each model as (26):
(6)
𝐴𝐼𝐶 = 2𝑛4 + 𝑛5 log(𝑅𝑆𝑆/𝑛5 )
where 𝑛4 is the number of fitted parameters and 𝑛5 is the number of data points used in
estimation. The model with the lowest AIC score is the best model. A model is significantly
worse than the best model if the difference between their AIC scores is greater than 2 (26).
Uncertainty quantification
We evaluate uncertainties in the estimated parameters 𝑟, 𝜃 and 𝐼"∗ , in two steps. First, we
assess uncertainties in these parameters while keeping other parameters in the model fixed. We
sampled 106 parameter combinations of 𝑟 , 𝜃 and 𝐼"∗ by drawing parameters randomly from
uniform distributions over the ranges of the parameters 𝑟 and 𝐼"∗ specified in Table 1. For the
detection probability 𝜃 , we draw random numbers between 0,001 to 1 on a log scale. We
calculate the RSS and the likelihood for each parameter combination. We accepted a parameter
combination if the likelihood of this parameter combination was not statistically different from
the best-fit parameter combinations using the log-likelihood ratio test. Second, to assess how
estimation was impacted by uncertainties in the fixed parameters, we set different values for the
mean latent period (2, 3 or 4 days), the mean time from infection to case confirmation (10, 12 or
14 days), the mean time from infection to death (16.5, 18,5 or 20.5 days) as well as the infection
fatality ratio (0.4%, 0.8% or 1%). We then re-fit the model and assessed uncertainty in the
estimated parameter values as described in the first step. The upper and lower bounds reported
were summarized using simulation results of all accepted parameter combinations in the two
steps.
Estimation of R0
We calculated R0 according to the equation proposed by Wearing et al. (27):

respectively.

We set the mean latent period, 1/𝑘, to vary between 3 and 4 days. This is based on that the
incubation period is estimated to be between 5-6 days (6, 28, 29) and infected individuals
become infectious approximately 2 days before symptom onset (30).
We set the mean infectious period, 1/𝛾, to be between 6-8 days to be consistent with the
estimated mean serial interval, i.e. the mean time interval between symptom onsets of an index
case and secondary cases in transmission pairs, of 6-8 days (3, 31, 32). See the Discussion
section for a discussion of the estimates of the serial interval. We note that this range of
infectious period is also consistent with the findings that infectious viruses can be recovered
during the first week of symptom onset (and up to 9 days post symptom onset) (24, 33).
To quantify the uncertainty of 𝑅" , we assumed that m=4 and n=3 similar as in our previous
work (6). We assume that the exponential growth rate, 𝑟, varies in the range estimated from the
data. The parameters (𝑟, 𝑘, 𝛾) are assumed to be mutually independent and we generate random
samples from uniform distributions according to ranges of variations defined above to compute
the resulting 𝑅" . We generated 106 parameters, and then computed their respective 𝑅" using Eq.
(7). We used the 97.5% and 2.5% percentile of the generated data to quantify the 95%
confidence interval.
Calculation of the level of population immunity after mass vaccination
We assume a gamma distribution for the duration of population immunity induced by a
hypothetical vaccine to SARS-CoV-2. Let 𝜏 be the mean duration, and s be the shape parameter
of the gamma distribution. For simplicity, we assume that the durations of the immunity induced
by natural infection and vaccination are the same. We further assume that the percentage of
protected population reaches to 85% after every mass vaccination with the hypothetical vaccine.
Note that this is likely to be an optimistic scenario (34). The fraction of population that are
immune to SARS-CoV-2 at time 𝑡 ∗ after a mass vaccination can then be expressed as 85% ×
-1 − C(𝑡 ∗ )/, where C(𝑡 ∗ ) is the cumulative density function of the gamma distribution for the
duration of population immunity. Based on this expression, we calculate the time when the
population immunity reaches to the herd immunity threshold value by solving 85% × -1 −
C(𝑡 ∗ )/ = 1 − 1/𝑅" for 𝑡 ∗ . The solution for 𝑡 ∗ is the maximum time interval between two
vaccinations to maintain herd immunity in a population.

Results
Estimation of the epidemic growth rate and surveillance intensity
Using our simplified SEIR-type (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) model (see
Methods and Supplementary Text for details), we fit both the case incidence data and the daily
death count data to estimate the epidemic growth rate and the detection probability, i.e. the
probability that an infected person is identified, before interventions were implemented in eight
European countries and the US. The exponential growth rates of early outbreaks, r, range
between 0.19 and 0.29/day in the nine countries, translating to doubling times between 2.4-3.7
days (Fig. 1). Spain and the US had the highest estimated growth rates, at 0.29 and 0.28/day,
respectively; whereas Switzerland and Netherlands had the lowest estimates at 0.19/day.
Evaluating uncertainties in these estimates (see Methods), we found that the epidemic growth
rates are highly constrained by the time series data despite variations in parameter values in the
model (Fig. 2A).

We estimated that the detection probability, i.e. the fraction of infected individuals who are
detected by surveillance, was likely to be low (<30%) across the countries examined except for
Germany. The point estimate of the detection probability in the US is 12%, i.e. approximately 1
in 10 infected individuals were detected, similar to a recent estimate using influenza like illness
data (35). This is likely due to the high percentage of infected individuals with no or mild-tomoderate symptoms (13, 14), which are difficult to detect through passive surveillance systems.
The detection probability is higher in Germany (with a point estimate of 58%) than in other
countries, providing an explanation of the high number of reported cases compared to the
relative low number of deaths in Germany during March 2020. Overall, there exist large
uncertainties in our estimation of the detection probability (Fig. 2B) due to the uncertainties in
the fixed parameter values assumed in the model, such as the infection fatality ratio.
Changes to the detection probability over time, e.g. as a result of changes in testing, could
lead to an apparent increase or decrease in case count and biases in inference. We considered two
scenarios involving increases in testing over the study period (see Methods for the mathematical
formulations), and found no statistical evidence that case counts during the relatively short
period for which we perform inference are strongly impacted by changes in surveillance intensity
(Table S2). While it is highly likely that the probability of a case being detected increased over
the period where testing was becoming available, our analysis excluded data from that period. As
shown in Fig. 1, the red, open circles indicate data outside of the study period. Most countries
show a pattern of very rapid increase in detected cases in the very early epidemic period that is
likely the result of both a growing epidemic and increasing availability and use of testing.
Estimating the basic reproductive number, R0
We computed the basic reproductive number, R0, for each country following the approach of
Wearing et al. (27), which uses as input the estimated growth rate, and the durations of the latent
and infectious periods. We assumed that the duration of the latent period (i.e. the period between
infection and becoming infectious) and the infectious periods to be 3-4 days and 6-8 days,
respectively (see Methods for justification of these parameter ranges). These choices of
parameters are consistent with the estimated mean serial intervals of 6-8 days (3, 31, 32).
However, some estimates of the serial intervals are shorter (30, 36-38). In the Discussion, we
present a more complete argument that for the purpose of estimating R0, a mean serial interval
between 6-8 days is the current best estimate.
Using the estimated ranges of the growth rates for each country, we estimated that the US
and Spain had highest median R0s at 5.8 (CI: 4.3-7.3) and 6.1 (5.1-7.5), respectively (Fig. 3 and
Table 2). For the other countries, we estimated the median R0 ranges between 3.6 and 4.9 (Fig. 3
and Table 2).
Implications for public health intervention strategies
Using our empirical estimates of the growth rates, we explored the implications for public
health efforts to control the COVID-19 outbreak. We considered an outbreak scenario in a large
city with a population of 10 million, and three possible goals: 1) containment (i.e. the size of
epidemic decreases), 2) 1% of the population is infected one year after the intervention, and 3)
10% of the population is infected one year after the intervention. Efforts needed for each goal are
similarly high, especially when the population of infected individuals is already more than 1000
(Fig. 2C). For example, when an outbreak grows at rate 0.28/day (as we estimated for the US),
the levels of efforts needed to achieve the three goals are between 81% and 84% reduction in

transmission; whereas when the growth rate is 0.19/day, the levels of effort needed are between
71% and 75% reduction. Regardless of the heterogeneity in the growth rates, the force of
infection must be significantly reduced, arguing for strong and comprehensive intervention
efforts.
Implications for vaccination strategies
From the range of R0 estimated above, we estimated that the range of herd immunity
thresholds needed to prevent sustained transmission is between 73% and 84% using the formula
1-1/R0 (39) (Table 2). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the protective immunity may not be
long lived for SARS-CoV-2 (18, 19). Thus, we further considered how a vaccine with waning
protection could be used to combat COVID-19 given our estimated levels of R0 (see Method).
We assumed a gamma distribution for the duration of protective immunity induced by a
hypothetical vaccine in a population, where s is the shape parameter of the gamma distribution
(Fig. 4A).
If the duration of protective immunity from the vaccine follows an exponential distribution,
(i.e. when 𝑠 = 1), a sizable fraction of individuals lose immunity rapidly, leading to a loss of
herd immunity shortly after the initial vaccination program, especially when R0 is large and the
herd immunity threshold is high (Fig. 4B). Consequently, the time between vaccinations required
to maintain herd immunity is much shorter than the mean duration of protective immunity (Fig.
4C). For example, even if the mean duration of protective immunity is 10 years, vaccination
must occur every 2.4 month and 2.4 years to maintain herd immunity when R0 is 6 and 3,
respectively (see the red lines in Fig. 4C). On the other extreme, when s is very large (Fig. 4A,
𝑠 = ∞), individuals in the population have identical durations of protective immunity. In this
case, herd immunity persists for a long period of time before the fraction of immune individuals
suddenly drops to a very low level (Fig. 4B). In this case, herd immunity can be kept at a
duration similar to the mean duration of protective immunity irrespective of R0 (see blue lines in
Fig. 4C).
The reality of an imperfect vaccine is likely to be between these two extremes. When we
assume 𝑠 = 10, the distribution becomes more Gaussian-like (Fig. 4A) where some people lose
protective immunity faster than others, but that heterogeneity is relatively low. If a mass
vaccination achieves 85% immunity in a population and protective immunity lasts on-average
around 45 weeks to 1 year (18) (consistent with the duration of immunity induced by endemic
coronaviruses (9, 20)), then vaccination will need to occur once a few months (Fig. 4C). If the
mean duration of immunity is around 3 years as observed for the antibody response to SARSCoV-1 or MERS-CoV (24), vaccination once a year or once two years will be sufficient, if R0 is
6 or 3, respectively (Fig. 4C). If the mean duration of immunity is greater than 10 years (for
example, a long T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-1 is observed in individuals recovered from
SARS-CoV-1 infection (22)), the time interval between repeated vaccinations becomes longer
than 4 years or 7 years when R0 is 6 or 3, respectively.

Discussion
In this work, we report rapid COVID-19 epidemic spread before broad control measures
were implemented in the eight most affected countries in Europe and in the US (during March,
2020). We further estimated that R0 values range between 3.6 and 6.1 in these countries, which
means high herd immunity thresholds between 73% and 84%. Together with our previous
estimates (6), these results are consistent with COVID-19 being highly transmissible in the

absence of strong control measures irrespective of heterogeneities in geographic and social
settings. A high level of coverage of effective vaccines are needed to achieve herd immunity. We
further show that the heterogeneity of individual-level protection provided by a vaccine is an
important factor in determining the frequency of vaccinations.
Awareness of the extraordinary high rates of COVID-19 spread is critically important for
epidemic preparedness, especially in face of the potential second wave of infection in the fall of
2020 (9). Regardless of the country, the short doubling times we estimated means that health
care systems can be overwhelmed in a couple of weeks rather than several months in the absence
of control (8). For example, a report shows that the number of COVID-19 patients admitted to
intensive care units in Italy grew at a rate of approximately 0.25/day during early epidemic (7).
While we found remarkably high levels of spread in all examined countries, we caution that our
inference is largely driven by data collected from highly populated areas, such as Wuhan in
China, Lombardy in Italy, and New York city in the US. Heterogeneities in the growth rate
almost certainly exist among different areas within each country. For example, recent works
suggest that the rate of spread is positively associated with population densities (40). Therefore,
the estimates we provide may represent good estimates in populated areas such as in cities.
Calculation of the basic reproductive number requires knowledge of the duration and
distribution of the serial interval, which in turn is determined by the latent and the infectious
periods. By explicitly considering the distributions of the latent and the infectious periods, our
work more accurately incorporate the timing of transmission events in the estimation of R0 (27).
Our estimates of R0 for several European countries are slightly higher than the estimated
effective reproductive numbers during early dynamics reported in a work published recently (17).
The explicit consideration of the distributions of the latent and the infectious periods and a
slightly longer serial interval assumed in our approach are likely to be the cause of this
discrepancy.
Various estimates of the mean serial interval (SI) exist for COVID-19. Similar to our earlier
work (6), we assumed parameter values that are consistent with a mean SI of 6-8 days. This is
based on estimates using data from Wuhan, China and Vo, Italy (3, 32). Shorter mean SIs were
reported in the literature, for example, 4.0 days in Du et al. (36), 5.8 days in He et al. (30), 4-5
days in Nishiura et al. (37), 4-5.2 days in Ganyani et al. (38). However, these estimates were
based on transmission pairs reported in locations outside of Wuhan, Hubei province, and other
Asian countries and territories neighboring China, where active surveillance and rapid isolation
programs were implemented. Indeed, we previously estimated that in provinces outside of Hubei
province, the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalization/isolation, was as short as 1.5
days after Jan 18th. A short duration between symptom onset and hospitalization was also
estimated for the outbreak in Singapore (25). This is in stark contrast to the time to
hospitalization estimated for patients in Wuhan (9-13 days (3)). Rapid isolation of infectious
individuals prevents further transmission after isolation, and thus inference of SIs from the
transmission pairs that were rapidly isolated will be biased towards shorter values. The impacts
of active tracing and isolation have been demonstrated by Bi et al. (31) and discussed in Ref.
(41). Bi et al. showed that in transmission pairs where index cases were isolated within 3 days
after symptom onset, the estimated mean SI is 3.6 days on average; whereas when index cases
were isolated after 3 days post symptom onset, the estimated mean SI becomes much longer,
approximately 8.0 days. Importantly, a recent work estimated the mean serial interval based on
data from and Vo, Italy (32), and showed that the mean SI is 7.2 days, consistent with estimates
from Wuhan, where little activate isolation efforts were in place during early epidemic (3).

Therefore, to calculate R0 (in the eight European countries and the US where minimal active
tracing and isolation programs were implemented), a serial interval between 6-8 as estimated in
Refs. (3, 31, 32) represents the best estimate. Further work characterizing the heterogeneities of
the distribution of serial intervals (11) and measuring serial intervals from individuals who are
asymptomatic may help to improve the estimation of R0.
We calculated the herd immunity thresholds to be between 73% and 84% in China (6), the
US and the eight European countries, based on the formula 1-1/R0 in a well-mixed population
(39). Heterogeneity in population structure may lead to certain degree of deviations (42).
Nonetheless, these are very high thresholds to reach even with an effective vaccine. For example,
for an effective vaccine with 90% efficacy, a coverage of 90% of the population only leads to a
population immunity of 81%. A recent survey showed that only approximately 50% of
Americans plan to get a COVID-19 vaccine (34). Our results highlight the importance of public
education about COVID-19 vaccination to ensure high vaccine coverage to achieve herd
immunity (34).
It is not known how long the vaccine induced protective immunity lasts. We found that if the
duration of immunity is relatively short as suggested in refs. (18, 19), and similar to the durations
of protective immunity against other endemic coronaviruses (9, 20) or MERS-CoV (24), a
frequent vaccination schedule once every couple of years to multiple times per year is needed to
maintain herd immunity. However, a recent report showed that the T cell immunity to SARSCoV-1 can last for 17 years in patients recovered from SARS-CoV-1 infection (22). In this case,
a less frequent vaccination schedule is needed. Furthermore, we found that in addition to the
mean duration of vaccine-induced protective immunity, the distribution of the duration is an
important factor in determining vaccination frequency. A vaccine that induces a more uniform
response in a population is better than a vaccine that induces a heterogeneous response in
maintaining population immunity. Studies of the kinetics of antibody dynamics in individuals,
such as refs. (19, 43), will help making more precise predictions of vaccine schedules. The stark
difference between the durations of the protective antibody immunity and the T cell immunity
(22) suggests that quantifying the individual heterogeneities in the kinetics of the T cell response
will also be important.
Overall, our work shows that SARS-CoV-2 has high R0 values and spread very rapidly in the
absence of strong control measures across different countries. This implies very high herd
immunity thresholds, and thus highly effective vaccines with high levels of population coverage
will be needed to prevent sustained transmission. If the protective immunity induced by
vaccination is not long lasting, understanding the full distribution of the duration of protective
immunity in the population is crucial to determine the frequency of vaccinations.

Figure 1. Estimation of the exponential growth rate and the doubling time of epidemics in
eight European countries and the US. Red and black symbols show the daily counts of new
cases and new deaths, respectively. Closed dots denote data used for parameter inference;
whereas open circles denote data that are not used for parameter inference. We simulated the
model using sampled parameter combinations that are able to explain the data shown in dots (see
Uncertainty quantification in Methods). The colored bands denote the area between the lower
and upper bounds of simulated/predicted true daily infection incidence (blue), daily cases (red)
and daily deaths (grey) assuming no intervention efforts nor changes in surveillance intensity.
Deviations of open circles from the corresponding bands thus indicate either changes in
surveillance intensity or impacts of control measures.

in maintaining herd immunity in a population. (A) Three scenarios for the distribution:
exponential (shape parameter 𝑠 = 1), Gaussian-like (𝑠 = 10) and identical (𝑠 = ∞). All three
distributions have the same mean, i.e. 1 year. The color code applies to all panels. (B) The
fraction of individuals who are immune in a population over time. We assumed that 85% of
population are immune after a mass vaccination at time 0. The dotted lines show the heard
immunity thresholds, i.e. 83% (for R0=6) and 67% (for R0=3). (C) The time when the population
immunity decreases to the threshold value (predicted for each R0) for the three scenarios. We
assumed R0=3 (dashed lines) or 6 (solid lines) in the calculations. Note the dashed blue line
overlaps with the solid blue line. The dotted lines show mean durations of immunity of 45 weeks,
