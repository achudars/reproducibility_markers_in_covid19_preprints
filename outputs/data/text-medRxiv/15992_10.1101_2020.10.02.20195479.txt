Abstract
Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents with a broad range of symptoms. Existing COVID-19 case definitions were
developed from early reports of severely ill, primarily hospitalized, patients. Symptom-based case definitions that
guide public health surveillance and individual patient management in the community must be optimized for
COVID-19 pandemic control.
Methods: We collected daily symptom diaries and performed RT-PCR on respiratory specimens over a 14-day
period in 185 community members exposed to a household contact with COVID-19 in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin
and Salt Lake City, Utah metropolitan areas. We interpreted the discriminatory performance (sensitivity,
specificity, predictive values, F1 score, Youden’s index, and prevalence estimation) of individual symptoms and
common case definitions according to two principal surveillance applications (i.e., individual screening and case
counting). We also constructed novel case definitions using an exhaustive search with over 73 million symptom
combinations and calculated bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals stratified by children
versus adults.

Findings: Common COVID-19 case definitions generally showed high sensitivity (8696%) but low positive
predictive value (PPV) (3649%; F1 score 5263) in this community cohort. The top performing novel symptom
combinations included taste or smell dysfunction. They also improved the balance of sensitivity and PPV (F1
score 7880) and reduced the number of false positive symptom screens. Performance indicators were generally
lower for children (<18 years of age).
Interpretation: Existing COVID-19 case definitions appropriately screened in community members with
COVID-19. However, they led to many false positive symptom screens and poorly estimated community
prevalence. Absent unlimited, timely testing capacity, more accurate case definitions may help focus public health
resources. Novel symptom combinations incorporating taste or smell dysfunction as a primary component better
balanced sensitivity and specificity. Case definitions tailored specifically for children versus adults should be
further explored.

Research in Context
Evidence before this study
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence has accelerated globally over the last several months. As the
full spectrum of clinical presentations has come into clearer focus, symptom-based clinical screening and case
surveillance has also evolved. Preliminary understanding of the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 was driven
primarily by descriptions of hospitalized patients, as early testing algorithms prioritized more severely ill persons
with classic lower respiratory symptoms and fever. Since then, more data from ambulatory settings have emerged.
We searched PubMed from 1 December 2019 to 21 August 2020 for studies that assessed the diagnostic
performance of case surveillance definitions for COVID-19. We found no studies examining the discriminatory
performance of case surveillance definitions among contacts with mild to moderate symptoms with documented
exposure to persons with COVID-19. Nonetheless, we found nine highly relevant studies: seven original reports
and two review articles. Five original studies evaluated individual, self-reported symptoms (two among healthcare
workers in the United States, one among healthcare workers in the Netherlands, and one online survey for the
general public in Somalia) and concluded that using dysfunction of taste or smell for routine COVID-19 screening
likely had utility. The fifth study had a similar conclusion based on self-reported symptoms and laboratory results
collected via smartphone from the general public in the United States and the United Kingdom. Another original
study modeled the substantial effect that multiple revisions to the COVID-19 case definition had on the reported
disease burden in the Chinese population. Lastly, an original study illustrated the shift in discriminatory
performance of established influenza surveillance case definitions for influenza between adults and children. Agespecific differences in case definition performance may also apply to COVID-19. Two articles reviewed
predictive algorithms to define outpatient COVID-19 illness and risk of hospitalization. The reviewed studies
were limited in that they were either restricted to individual signs or symptoms, or they incorporated blood tests or
imaging that required in-person access to medical care.
Added value of this study
The discriminatory performance of case surveillance definitions for COVID-19 is important for implementing
effective epidemic mitigation strategies. Our study illustrates the performance of case definitions in community
members with household exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based

solely on symptom profiles. Prior work overrepresented healthcare workers or otherwise studied nonrepresentative populations, and they did not examine across the age spectrum. Our study also provides a novel
framework for refining definitions. Using 15 symptoms associated with COVID-19 for all contacts regardless of
disease status, we systematically evaluated the discriminatory performance of individual symptoms and
previously defined case surveillance definitions across ages and according to two core surveillance applications:
1) screening non-hospitalized individuals to prioritize public health interventions, and 2) estimating the number of
non-hospitalized persons with COVID-19 (i.e., community-based syndromic surveillance). We also constructed
novel symptom combinations that effectively performed both functions and improved upon widely used case
surveillance definitions that may help to target interventions in the absence of unlimited laboratory diagnostic
capacity. Our analyses highlight the importance of ongoing re-evaluation of symptom-based surveillance
definitions to suit the intended purpose and population under surveillance. Based on our results, which were
derived from household members of all ages, case surveillance definition performance may improve if developed
separately for adults and children.
Implications of all the available evidence
Case definitions for COVID-19 should be tailored to maximize the discriminatory performance dependent upon
its intended use. Existing COVID-19 case definitions screened in most community members with COVID-19, but
also yielded a high number of false positive results. When unlimited, timely diagnostic testing is not available
symptom combinations with improved accuracy (i.e., more balanced sensitivity and specificity) may help focus
resources, such as recommending self-isolation among community contacts.

Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2). The virus was first identified in a cluster of patients with atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in
December 2019.1 Since its emergence, the virus has spread globally, causing widespread infection and death.
Following evidence of person-to-person transmission and a broader clinical spectrum of infections, case
definitions for COVID-19 have been revised.2 In the initial weeks of the pandemic, COVID-19 was labeled a
pneumonia of unknown etiology, and many who presented to medical care had classic pneumonia-like symptoms
such as fever, cough, and dyspnea. An exceptional variety of symptoms has since been reported for COVID-19,
ranging from none or mild indistinct symptoms to invasive neurological disease and fulminant respiratory
failure.3-7 As is common in the early response phases to novel emerging pathogens, there is ongoing need to
reassess and refine surveillance case definitions for COVID-19 based on new information. Changes to case
definitions affect interpretation of surveillance data, as was demonstrated by substantially different prevalence
estimates when China broadened the COVID-19 case definition early in its epidemic response.2
A few studies have demonstrated the predictive value of symptom profiles in healthcare workers4,8,9 and other
populations potentially not necessarily representative of the general public.5,10 These studies are subject to other
limitations, too. Some applied predictive models that included serum biomarkers and imaging.11,12 Obtaining this
information may limit real-world capture of people with mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection and may delay
public health intervention. Further, few studies to date have examined symptom combinations exclusively.
Respiratory pathogens routinely behave differently in children and adults, and this appears to be true for COVID19 as well.13 For example, an assessment of ambulatory case surveillance definitions for influenza demonstrated
lower sensitivity among children less than 5 years of age.14 Similar analyses across age strata are lacking for
COVID-19. Reliable, age-stratified syndromic surveillance definitions would likely aid public health officials to
scale up community contact tracing and develop protocols to safely operate various congregate venues, such as
schools and workplaces, should unlimited, timely diagnostic testing be unavailable.
Dedicated symptom-based surveillance systems have been developed to track COVID-19 cases. These include the
U.S. Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) original (CSTE combination 1; released 5 April

2020) and revised (CSTE combination 2; released 7 August 2020) clinical criteria for reporting SARS-CoV-2
infection, and the original CDC COVID-19like illness (CLI) definition (Table 1). Similarly, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains a list of symptoms for priority SARS-CoV-2 testing. These
COVID-19 case definitions and the priority testing symptom list are intended to capture as many persons with
COVID-19 as possible with confirmatory testing. Finally, longstanding respiratory virus surveillance networks
established to monitor influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI), which is used for
community-based syndromic surveillance of respiratory syncytial virus by the World Health Organization
(WHO), may be plausibly adaptable platforms for monitoring COVID-19. The performance characteristics and
utility of these syndromic surveillance platforms for COVID-19 have not been well defined.5
We aimed to describe the diagnostic performance of two existing case definitions for COVID-19, the CDC
COVID-19 symptom list, and two longstanding viral respiratory disease surveillance definitions among persons
with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 exposure, stratified between adults and children. We also aimed to derive novel,
practical symptom combinations in the same population. We interpreted the results primarily within the
framework of two core public health surveillance functions: 1) symptom-based screening of individuals to guide
SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing, contact tracing, and community-based isolation and quarantine, and 2)
estimating disease frequency in persons with documented SARS-CoV-2 exposure. For symptom screening, we
considered the merits of novel combinations when unlimited, timely diagnostic testing is unavailable.
Methods
Study Design and Data Collection
CDC collaborated with state and local health departments in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Salt Lake City, Utah
metropolitan areas in the United States to identify and enroll a convenience sample of people with laboratoryconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their household contacts from 22 March to 22 April 2020. Ours are
secondary analyses of this household transmission investigation whose methods were previously published in
detail.15 This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC

policy. See e.g., 45 C.F.R. part 46, 21 C.F.R. part 56; 42 U.S.C. §241(d); 5 U.S.C. §552a; 44 U.S.C. §3501 et
seq.
We administered questionnaires to household contacts to assess the presence of 15 symptoms during the 14 days
prior to or at enrollment (day 0). Additionally, participants completed a daily symptom diary during days 114
after enrollment. We collected serum and upper respiratory specimens (i.e., both nasopharyngeal [NP] and
anterior nares swabs) on day 0 and day 14. We additionally collected NP swabs at any interim date if any
household contact newly developed or had worsening of any one of 15 symptoms consistent with COVID-19:
nasal congestion or runny nose, sore throat, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, discomfort while breathing,
wheezing, headache, new loss of taste or smell, fever/chills, fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea (≥3 loose stools per
day), abdominal pain, or nausea/vomiting. The Milwaukee Health Department and Utah Public Health
Laboratories tested the swabs using the CDC real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2,16 and CDC tested sera using a CDC-developed SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA).17
Definitions
We defined a household contact to be a COVID-19 case if they had at least one specimen test positive for SARSCoV-2 by RT-PCR. We classified persons <18 years of age as children, and persons ≥18 years of age as adults.
We combined all symptoms recorded at any time prior to enrollment (and after the index case’s symptom onset
date) through the end of the 14-day observation period. We assessed individual symptoms, existing symptom
combinations, and newly constructed symptom combinations for their association with SARS-CoV-2 test result
by RT-PCR (Table 1). We asked enrollees to state whether they experienced any loss of taste and, separately,
smell during the specified time period. For enrollees who responded yes to this question, we then asked whether
the loss was partial or complete. We defined loss and/or dysfunction of taste or smell to include any level of loss,
whether partial or complete. For ARI, we interpreted coryza as runny nose or nasal congestion.

We excluded household contacts from the main analysis if not present at enrollment or not completing the study
procedures. Our analysis of combinations predictive of COVID-19 included all 15 symptoms surveyed. We
formally described the diagnostic performance of each individual symptom, existing COVID-19 case definitions,
respiratory illness case definitions, and newly constructed symptom combinations (Table 1). The goal of assessing
symptom combinations was to accurately divide the population into two groups: those who tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 and those who tested negative. For a given combination, we calculated the association of the
combination with respect to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, yielding the number of contacts who
were true positive (TP) (i.e., positive symptom profile and positive test), false negative (FN) (i.e., negative
symptom profile and positive test), false positive (FP) (i.e., positive symptom profile and negative test), or true
negative (TN) (i.e., negative symptom profile and negative test). From these values, we calculated the symptom
combination’s sensitivity (i.e., TP / [TP + FN]), specificity (i.e., TN / [TN + FP]), positive predictive value (PPV)
(i.e., TP / [TP + FP]), negative predictive value (NPV) (i.e., TN / [TN + FN]), F1 score (the harmonic mean of
sensitivity and PPV), and Youden’s index ([sensitivity + specificity]  100). To determine how well each
definition would estimate prevalence in a syndromic surveillance system, we also calculated the difference in the
number of positive symptom screens (i.e., TP + FP) from the actual number of contacts who tested positive by
RT-PCR. We assessed combinations across all ages and in children and adults separately, and we reported all
measures on the percentage scale. To assess variability in each performance measure, we constructed biascorrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals18 over 10,000 pseudosamples constructed by resampling
households with replacement. We reported 95% confidence intervals with two exceptions. For measures estimated
at 100% in the observed sample, we omitted confidence intervals, because the pseudosamples could not exhibit
any variability. For the difference in specificity and sensitivity between adults and children, we reported 97·5%
confidence intervals (a Bonferroni correction) to allow for a 95% joint confidence level regarding the differences
in each pair.
We adapted innovative methods previously applied in the low-resource context to derive a parsimonious symptom
combination to prioritize diagnostic testing for tuberculosis.19 We chose this approach to be as comprehensive as
practical for COVID-19 in that it systematically assessed nearly every conceivable combination of symptoms.

First, we searched over 245,000 combinations of between one and 15 symptoms (i.e., simple combinations of the
form “at least m symptoms present out of n symptoms considered”). We gave greater weight to combinations with
high F─1 score or high Youden’s index. We then conducted an exhaustive search using pairs of these “m─of─n”
combinations (i.e., compound combinations) to allow for more nuanced combinations. We limited this second
search to single combinations of no more than five symptoms, such that the number of total symptoms evaluated
for a compound combination was never more than ten. We allowed each pair of combinations to be joined by the
logical operators [AND] and [OR], yielding approximately 73 million unique combination pairs. After the search,
we selected four combination pairs to include in the primary analysis on the basis of diagnostic performance and
parsimony. We measured diagnostic performance by F–1 score (higher being better). We measured parsimony by
the total number of symptoms evaluated (fewer being better) (Table 1).
We performed all calculations in R 4·0·0 (R Core Team), Python 3·7 (Python Software Foundation), or both. To
allow for parallel processing, the exhaustive combinatorial search and bootstrap confidence intervals were
implemented on a scientific workstation with 24 logical cores and 64 GB of RAM. De-identified data and analytic
scripts in R and Python are publicly available through a GitHub repository: https://github.com/scotthlee/covidcasedefs.
Findings
Study Population
We enrolled 199 contacts of index patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections within 62
households. We excluded one contact who was not living in the home on the day of enrollment, one who was
hospitalized at enrollment, and two who did not consent to have specimens collected. Ten contacts had negative
RT-PCR and positive serology test results; they were also excluded from the primary analyses. Therefore, our
analyses included the remaining 185 household contacts. The median time interval from index patient’s symptom
onset date to enrollment was 10 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 713). About half (95; 51%) were female. 108
(58%) were Caucasian/white, 32 (17%) Latinx/Hispanic, 23 (12%) African American/black, 14 (8%) Asian, four
(2%) Native American, and four (2%) multiracial. The median age was 22 years ([IQR]: 1447), with 122 (66%)
adults and 63 (34%) children. Among children, nine (14%) were <5 years, 19 (30%) were 59 years, and 35

(56%) were 1017 years of age. SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected by RT-PCR in 49 (27%) household
contacts. Separated by age group, 35/122 (29%) adults and 14/63 (22%) children had laboratory-confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR. Among the 49 RT-PCR-positive contacts, most (45; 92%) also had a positive
serology result, three had a negative serology result, and one was not tested by serology.
Performance Characteristics for Individual Symptoms (All Ages Pooled)
Individual symptoms with the highest sensitivity were nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, headache, and cough (Table
2, Figure 1). Many of the individual symptoms reported were highly specific, although generally resulting in
lower sensitivity. The exception was loss or dysfunction of taste or smell (categorized as a single symptom),
which had a moderate sensitivity of 63% (95% CI 4777%), high specificity (96%; 95% CI 9099%), high NPV
(88%; 95% CI 8093%), and the highest PPV (84%; 95% CI 6494%), Youden’s index (59%; 95% CI 4273%),
and F1 score (72%; 95% CI 5783%).
Performance Characteristics for Existing COVID-19 Case Definitions, the CDC Symptom List, and Respiratory
Syndromic Surveillance Networks (All Ages Pooled)
Among the existing case definitions, sensitivity was perfect (100%) for the CDC symptom list definition, and also
high for ARI (96%; 95% CI 86100%), CSTE combination 1 (original); 94%; 95% CI 8298%), CSTE
combination 2 (revised); 98%; 95% CI 88100%), and CLI (86%; 95% CI 7094%) (Table 2, Figure 1). While
these definitions offered high sensitivity, they were poorly specific. Conversely, ILI was highly specific (90%;
95% CI 8394%) but insensitive (51%; 95% CI 3565%). All existing definitions demonstrated low PPV.
Youden’s indices and F1 scores were highest for CSTE combination 1 and CLI, though still suboptimal. None of
the existing definitions predicted prevalence well; the difference from true prevalence ranged from 20 for ILI to
196 for the CDC symptom list. Compared to CSTE combination 1, CSTE combination 2 had slightly higher
sensitivity and NPV, but performed more poorly on all other diagnostic performance indicators.
Performance Characteristics for Derived Compound Symptom Combinations (All Ages Pooled)

The four highest performing novel symptom combinations, based on F1 score and parsimony, were compound
symptom combinations that included dysfunction of taste or smell. These four combinations performed similarly
well on all performance measures (Table 2, Figure 1). We determined compound symptom combination 3 (i.e.,
loss or dysfunction of taste or smell, or at least two of the following: shortness of breath, wheezing, discomfort
breathing, or fever/chills), to be simple to implement, have higher specificity (93%; 95% CI 85 97%), NPV
(92%; 95% CI 8696%), PPV (79%; 95% CI 6091%), Youden’s index (70%; 95% CI 5482%), and F1 score
(78%; 95% CI 6687%) than existing case definitions. The compound symptom combination 3 showed nearperfect prevalence prediction (2; 95% CI 2024), and sensitivity was moderately high (78%; 95% CI 6388%).
Adult-Child Differences in Discriminatory Performance
The accuracy of symptom profiles for defining RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 differed by age (Table 3, Figure
2). Overall, existing case definitions were less sensitive in children compared to adults. One exception, the CDC
symptom list for priority testing (Table 1), captured all COVID-19 cases regardless of age. The existing case
definitions were more specific in children, but the greater specificity was statistically significant for CSTE
combination 1 only. Individual symptoms showed a similar pattern of lower sensitivity among children, notably
taste/smell dysfunction. Sore throat was more sensitive in children, and fever/chills and nausea were similar
regardless of age group. We observed a similar pattern of increased specificity for most derived symptom
combinations in children (Table 3, Figure 2). Cough was the sole symptom where the difference in both
sensitivity and specificity was statistically significant. For both children and adults, the CLI case definition
provided the greatest balance between both sensitivity and specificity (Youden’s Index 53%; 95% CI 880% vs.
52%; 95% CI 3666%, respectively) and harmonization of sensitivity with PPV (F1 61%; 95% CI 2683% vs.
63%; 95% CI 4976%, respectively) (Table 2). CLI also most accurately predicted overall prevalence amongst
children (percent difference from true prevalence 36%; 95% CI 17157) (Table 3).
Interpretation
Existing case surveillance definitions for COVID-19, as shown in Table 1, were generally sensitive in our study
conducted among household contacts of infected persons, a population with proven SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

However, they tended to have low specificity and poorly estimated disease prevalence. By systematically
screening novel definitions that optimized sensitivity, specificity, and PPV, we improved community prevalence
estimation and overall accuracy of individual screening, which could be useful if diagnostic testing is limited. In
particular, we affirmed loss or dysfunction of taste or smell as a uniquely discerning characteristic central to
constructing an effective, concise case surveillance definition when applied across all age groups (i.e., derived
compound combination 3).
An appropriate discriminatory balance between sensitivity and specificity for a newly emerging pathogen depends
on the objectives of the surveillance activity.20 Highly sensitive case definitions capture a larger proportion of true
COVID-19 cases, which is ideal when diagnostic testing is widely available and results are timely. Highly
sensitive definitions, however, generally rule in a larger number of non-cases (i.e., FP symptom screens).21 In
addition to testing resources, the public health system’s tolerance for false-positive screens is, of course,
dependent on human resources. This is especially apparent when intensive interventions involve extensive contact
tracing, isolation and quarantine. At high community COVID-19 prevalence, these intensive mitigation efforts
may benefit from evidence-based prioritization. By example, CSTE combination 2 had a FP symptom screening
rate (77/136; 57%) eight times that for derived compound combination 3 (10/136; 7%) in our cohort. At the
population level, such differences could expose shortcomings in resources for core interventions, such as
universal contact tracing. The COVID-19 response has repeatedly been strained in these requisite areas.22-24 Novel
symptom screening criteria that more tightly couple sensitivity and specificity (i.e., diagnostic accuracy), such as
the derived compound combination 3, could help to prioritize interventions when strategically deployed. This
principle may also apply when evaluating novel vaccines or therapeutics in large clinical trials involving
thousands of participants, where feasibility constraints often dictate the use of symptom-prioritized testing to
confirm outcomes. Still, highly sensitive symptom rules, such as CSTE combination 2, are preferred for COVID19 when resources are unlimited.
For using syndromic surveillance systems to estimate community burden, the highly sensitive existing case
definitions overestimated true burden. Conversely, highly specific case definitions, such as ILI, may detect
changes in disease trends over time but underestimate true burden.20 ILI underestimated disease prevalence by

more than 80% in this study population. Current laboratory-based surveillance grossly under-ascertains
incidence,25 especially where diagnostic testing is not easily accessible or widespread. Retailoring communitybased syndromic surveillance systems already in place26 (i.e., altering the symptoms included or applying a
correction factor based on results such as ours) would more accurately reflect true burden.
For most symptoms and their combinations, overall performance, most notably sensitivity, differed between
children and adults. These findings are consistent with prior observations whereby children generally show fewer
and milder symptoms of COVID-19 compared with adults,27 and COVID-19 syndromes vary across ages.13 The
small number of children with COVID-19 in this cohort limits the conclusion of specific recommendations, but
further examination into the utility of age-specific case definitions is warranted in considering policies for schools
and other child congregate settings, and for deriving accurate burden estimates from syndromic surveillance.
While the number of individuals in this study is relatively small, our investigation is among the largest and most
well-characterized of its kind to date. We collected extensive symptom data, which yielded a comprehensive
assessment of multiple symptom combinations. We also employed inclusion criteria that were not based on
disease status or symptom status, and a reference category based on standardized laboratory testing. Nonetheless,
we acknowledge this study’s limitations. These analyses were not intended to produce definitive symptom
combinations to be applied to the general public, however they may be used to guide the development of future
candidate case definitions. One key consideration for future validation efforts is that enrollment started
immediately after the precipitous decline in laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the United States in
mid-March 2020.28 Thus, our estimates of diagnostic performance may differ during the viral respiratory season.
In addition, COVID-19 prevalence was higher for our study population (i.e., contacts of laboratory-confirmed
household members) compared to the entire community, thereby limiting the generalizability of predictive values
(although sensitivity and specificity remain unaffected by disease prevalence). Screening criteria applied to
persons seeking medical care may also perform differently, as those individuals probably tend to have more
severe illness.
Additionally, we showed that existing COVID-19 case definitions are highly sensitive and do well to screen in
persons for testing and individual-level public health interventions like community isolation. In the first such

endeavor for evaluating and deriving novel COVID-19 case surveillance definitions in a community setting
among SARS-CoV-2—exposed individuals with largely mild illness, we evaluated novel symptom combinations
for COVID-19 using methodology previously applied to tuberculosis in low resource settings.19 These derived
combinations and CSTE definition 2 better estimated community disease burden and used taste and/or smell
dysfunction as a primary component. The latter is supported by prior studies.5,8-10 Because most SARS-CoV-2
infections are mild29 and core public health functions may need prioritization when testing and other resources are
limited, case definitions that accurately determine COVID-19 status in the general public may assist continued
interruption of community transmission.30 When timely diagnostic testing is readily available, however, using less
sensitive screening tools could inappropriately miss cases and lead to further community transmission.
Our study population, which includes persons across the age spectrum and enrolled participants independent of
disease and symptom status, may better reflect the diagnostic performance in the general population than
previously published research. Accurate clinical case definitions are likely to also apply to large clinical trials for
candidate vaccines and therapeutics where serial confirmatory SARS-CoV-2 testing for any new symptom is
impractical. It is important that our results be validated against the growing body of larger ambulatory
surveillance databases in diverse communities and in other countries; in particular, our methodology should be
assessed in the context of the annual influenza season, at varying community COVID-19 prevalence, and across
the age spectrum. Such studies ideally can be accompanied by cost-effectiveness modeling of intervention
strategies.

Table 2. Diagnostic performance indicators for individual COVID-19 symptoms, existing case definitions, and derived compound symptom
combinations for a community cohort of 185 people with household COVID-19 exposure in Utah and Wisconsin, United States, March–May 2020

Sensitivity is the probability of testing positive when disease is present.
NPV = negative predictive value. NPV is the probability of a patient not having disease when test is negative.
§
PPV = positive predictive value. PPV is the probability of a patient having disease when test is positive.
Youden’s index is defined as sensitivity plus specificity minus 100 (perfect score=100).
¶
F-1 score is defined as the harmonic mean of sensitivity and PPV (perfect score=100).
**Difference in prevalence is defined as the difference in the number of positive symptom screens (i.e., true positive plus false positive) for each
combination from the actual number of contacts who tested positive by RT-PCR.
††
TN = true negative.
‡‡
FP = false positive.
§§
FN = false negative.
TP = true positive.

Influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatient visit information collected through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like
Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932).
This collaborative effort between CDC, state and local health departments, and healthcare providers has been
tracking patients with ILI since the 1997-1998 influenza season.
Of the ten RT-PCR-negative and serology-positive contacts, three (30%) seroconverted during the two-week
observation period. Median ages were the same as those who were RT-PCR-positive and serology-positive (22
years). The most common symptoms in these ten contacts were cough (n=7), headache (n=6), and fever or chills
(n=5). Compared to those who were RT-PCR-positive and serology-positive, the ten individuals with only
positive serology had a lower median number of symptoms (2 vs. 7) and longer time interval from the household
index case’s symptom onset to first diagnostic specimen collection: for the ten participants with discordant
results, the median interval was 13 days (interquartile range [IQR] 10─17) whereas for the 185 remaining
participants it was 10 days (IQR 7─13). Taken together, these results suggest that mucosal viral shedding ceased
in these participants before study enrollment. These 10 enrollees were excluded from the main analyses.
