Antibody response (IgG) in SARS-CoV-2
infected persons

Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses remain poorly understood and the clinical utility of
serological testing is still unclear. As it is thought to confer some degree of immunity, this
study is carried out to know the relationship between demographics and ct value of confirmed
rt-PCR patients. A total of 384 serum samples were collected between 4-6 weeks after
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgG positivity was found to be 80.2% (95% CI, 76.2 – 84.2).
The IgG positivity increased with the decrease in the ct value, with highest of 87.6% positivity
in individuals with <20 ct value. The mean (± SD) ct value of IgG positives and og IgG negatives
was 23.34 (± 6.09) and 26.72 (± 7.031) respectively. There was no significant difference found
between the demographic characteristics such as age, sex, symptoms and antibody response.
The current study is first of its kind wherein we have assessed the correlation of ct of RT-PCR
with development of IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Our study showed that although Ct value might

not have any relation with severity of the diseases but is associated with the antibody
response among the SARS-CoV-2 infected individual.
Introduction:
An outbreak of pneumonia in late December 2019 which was reported in Wuhan, Hubei
Province, China1 which was later identified to be caused by a novel beta coronavirus closely
related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) family and was
recently termed SARS-CoV-2.2 As of October 30, 2020, more than 51.8 million individual were
infected with SARS-CoV-2, with 1.28 million SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths.3 USA, India and
Brazil account for the majority of the cases worldwide with India accounting for 8.2 million
cases and 1.2 million deaths.4
There is a scarcity of information on antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.5 SARS-CoV-2
antibodies have been detected from a range of few days to 3 weeks after onset of symptoms,
with median time reported as 6 days for detectable levels of IgG.6,7,8 The presence of SARSCoV-2 IgG antibodies is thought to confer some degree of immunity which is indicative of
current or previous infection by SARS-CoV-2,9 however there is uncertainty regarding the
duration and extent of immunity conferred by SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies.8,10
The present study was carried out semi-quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody estimation to
understand how the body’s antibody responds in correlation to the severity of SARS-CoV-2
symptoms, ct value, gender and age.
Methodology
Sample collection
A subset of 384 individuals were included in the study to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 IgG
between 4 and 6 weeks after confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rt-PCR from the month of
August to October 2020. The ct values, age, gender and symptoms of the patients were

correlated with the development of antibodies. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were defined as
those that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of combined nasopharyngeal and throat swab (NT)
samples. Patients who presented with any one or more symptoms such as fever,
breathlessness, cough, fatigue, muscle pain clogged nasal cavity sore throat diarrhoea Loss of
taste (anosmia) and loss of smell (ageusia) during the time of RT-PCR testing was considered
symptomatic.
Testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG
Semi-quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing was performed using ARCHITECT i2000SR platform
which uses chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology for the
detection of immunoglobulin class G (IgG) antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of
SARS-CoV-2 from human serum. The cut off for antibody response was 1.4 index, above which
the sample was considered positive.
Data analysis
Data were entered using MS- Excel and descriptive statistical analysis were performed using
SPSS software (IBM SPSS statistics for Windows, version 24.0, Armonk, NY).
Results
Out of the total 384 samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR positive individuals, 80.2%
(95% CI, 76.2 – 84.2) of the samples were found to be positive for antibodies against SARSCoV-2. The median time of the sample collection was 34 days after confirmatory RT-PCR
testing. The mean age of the IgG positive and negative individuals were 36.94 ± 11.29 and
36.09 ± 10.18 respectively. IgG positivity was found to be highest (88.3%) in persons age ≥60
years. No significant difference for antibody response was detected in different age groups
(P=0.437) (Figure 1a). The samples were collected predominantly from male 334 (86.9%) than

females 50 (13.1%). Males were having higher chances of producing antibodies than females
after a SARS-CoV-2 infection but was found to be statistically insignificant (P=0.237) (Figure
1b). The mean ct value of symptomatic and symptomatic patients were 23.48 ± 6.070 and
24.16 ± 6.521 respectively. There was no statistical difference for IgG response between
symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (P=0.754) (Figure 1c). The mean (± SD) ct value of
the IgG Ab positives was 23.34 (± 6.09) and in IgG negatives was 26.72 (± 7.031). The
percentage of IgG Ab positives increased with the decrease in the ct value, which was found
to be statistically significant (P<0.001) (Figure 1d). The antibody titre values of the positive
individuals mostly (71%) presented between 1.4 to 6.0 index (Figure 2).
Discussion
In this second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, sero-testing emerged as a most handful
utility platform to track down the susceptible population. This method is fast and is being
considered as a complementary to the gold standard RT-PCR test. Most of the studies have
found a surprisingly lower IgG prevalence (≤ 90%) among the recovered patients, although a
handful of the literature suggested quite a higher percentage for the same.8,9 This anomaly
demands the need of a study based on patients’ demography, infection severity, viral load.
In this study, the antibody response was found to be 80.2% among Covid-19 positive
individuals which had been reported by most of the literature.8,9 However, a statistically
significant correlation was found between ct value and the IgG antibody titre. Antibody titre
was found to be directly proportional to the lower ct value (indicative of higher viral load). So,
it can be said higher viral load might lead to development of stronger immune response in a
SARS-CoV-2 infected individual. Although the kind of immunity being exerted by IgG is not
undertood properly yet, but definitely some level of immunity is coferred by IgG as found by
this study. Similar to earlier studies,8 our study showed IgG response was greater in males

than in females but was statistically insignificant. The predominant positive male population
over female could be a limitation of the current study to depict the original IgG prevalence in
different gender. There was also no statistically significant association between ct value and
the development of symptoms. One of the earlier study found that antibody titre cannot be
corelated with SARS-CoV-2 disease severity which can be corroborated by this data also.12
Without the use of a standard curve using reference materials, the ct value by itself cannot
be interpreted directly as viral load13, however ct can be used as a indicative of viral load in
an infected individual.
There are additional implications from our study for blood banks wherein donors are
screened for antibodies using qualitative antibody tests for convalescent plasma to treat
Covid-19 patients. To support a previous diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, these facilities often relied
on self-reporting about patient history and onset of symptoms. The correlation of ct values
with a semi-quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay can provide significant assistance in plasma
donor selection.
The current study is the first of its kind wherein we have assessed the correlation of ct of RTPCR with the development of IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Ct value might not have any relation
with the severity of the diseases but is associated with the antibody response by the SARSCoV-2 infected persons. However further long-term studies of longitudinal follow-up of a
cohort will help in better understanding and definitive conclusion.
