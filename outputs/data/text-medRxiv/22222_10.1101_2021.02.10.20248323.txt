Abstract
Objectives: This study examined the natural history, including incidence and prevalence, of
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies serially up to 6 months post infection in Irish Healthcare Workers
(HCWs) at an academic tertiary maternity hospital, during the first pandemic peak from
March to September 2020.

Design: This single centre observational study profiled SARS-CoV-2 incidence and infection
using viral RNA detected using oro/nasopharyngeal swabs accompanied by serological
assessment of study participants for the presence of S SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Participant
demographics were also collected alongside information on clinical symptoms and time to
recovery. Real time polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) for viral RNA SARS-CoV-2 detection
was performed using the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2 three gene target 2019-nCoV assay (SeeGene
Inc., Rep. of Korea) or the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay on the GeneXpert platform
(Cepheid, USA). Blood samples were obtained at the time of initial swab and at up to 4 time
points thereafter, for the serological assessment of antibodies against both the spike and
nucleocapsid protein antigens of SARS-CoV-2. Serological response was measured using the
Captia Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA (Trinity Biotech) as part of a clinical performance
evaluation. Two other testing methods were also used; the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG)
assay (EuroImmun) and the Abbott Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG 75 kit on the Architect™ i2000SR
instrument (Abbott Laboratories).

Setting: Academic Tertiary Maternity Hospital in Dublin, Ireland.

Participants: We invited symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers employed at
the Rotunda Maternity Hospital to participate in the CAST study.

Main Outcome Measures: The CAST study aimed to examine incidence and clinical
symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs and to determine the presence and longevity of
antibodies in this group. We also sought to examine the clinical utility of the Captia AntiSARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA (Trinity Biotech) and to compare it to the current “accepted” gold
standard platform in Ireland.
Results: By July 2020, 398 molecular tests had been completed on symptomatic staff with
clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this cohort, 14% (n=54/398) had SARS-CoV-2
RNA detected by RT-PCR. The CAST study enrolled 137 HCWs with 86 participants
symptomatic at time of swab collection and a further 51 asymptomatic control participants.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 52% (n=45/86) symptomatic study participants and
serological positivity was confirmed in 98% (n=44/45) of those participants. Asymptomatic
SARS-CoV-2 RNA infection was detected in 4% (n=2/51) of control participants with a
seropositivity rate in this group of 8% (n=4/51). We demonstrated that 95% of SARS-CoV-2
PCR positive participants have detectable levels of antibodies at 100 days post infection,
which persisted in 91% of participants at day 160+. Ongoing symptoms up to six months
post infection were present in 50% of study participants with positive PCR and serology
results. These data will be important to consider for long-term workforce planning in a
healthcare setting, as the ongoing pandemic continues.
Funding: The CAST study was supported by the Rotunda Hospital and Trinity Biotech.

Introduction

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reached the Republic of Ireland in February 2020 and by March
27th, Ireland, along with many other countries, introduced a lockdown to inhibit the spread
of the virus.1 HCWs, in maintaining healthcare services and clinical activity continued to be
exposed to patients and other staff and are therefore considered to be a high risk cohort for
contracting SARS-CoV-2.2,3,4 HCWs currently account for approximately 25% of the infected
population in Ireland with information on the longer term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
this cohort continuing to emerge. 5,6,7

Robust testing strategies have shown to be an important tool in slowing down the
pandemic, supporting decisions on infection control and improving the knowledge of
virological aspects of SARS-CoV-2.8,9 However, testing should be accompanied by clear
standardized comprehensible information on performance for both clinicians and patients.
The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO)
currently recommend COVID-19 diagnosis via the identification of viral genome targets by
RT-PCR in respiratory tract materials during the first week of symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 virus
RNA.8,9 This type of test is most useful when the virus is actively replicating, therefore
identifying acute or early infection, with sensitivity ranging from 34% to 80%.8 While it is
acknowledged that molecular testing may yield false positive and negative results, it is still
the most common and reliable test across Europe. 10,11,12

Serology testing which determines the presence or levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the
blood is useful in identifying people who have developed immunity to the virus. Detection
of IgM antibodies can be found in serology samples from one week post-infection with IgG
antibodies or long term immunoglobulins detectable from Days 7-21.13,14 The longevity of
detected antibodies and whether this infers protective immunity is still unclear with
information on future defence against COVID-19 continuing to evolve as ongoing research
emerges.15

The need for a locally manufactured, sensitive and robust open platform diagnostic system
is important for the ongoing fight against COVID-19. Trinity Biotech has developed an
Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), Captia™ SARS-CoV-2 IgG kit for the qualitative
detection of human IgG class antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum. The Captia™ SARSCoV-2 IgG kit is an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device intended for use in a laboratory setting.
The CAST study is a collaborative project between Trinity Biotech and the Rotunda Hospital
which sought to examine the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs during the first pandemic
peak.

Methods
This single centre prospective observational study was conducted at the Rotunda Hospital in
Dublin from late March to September 2020. The study was approved by the Hospital
Research Ethics Committee (REC-2020-012). Hospital Staff were invited to participate by the
Occupational Health Department at a COVID-19 pre-swabbing consultation, with
asymptomatic controls invited to volunteer via a hospital-based poster and email campaign.
All tests were carried out in a designated staff testing area of the hospital, with same day

PCR results available. An on-site contact tracing team was available to quickly remove close
contacts of positive staff in order to curb transmission. Participants provided written
informed consent for collection of both oro/nasopharyngeal swabs and serum samples.
Participants were informed of their swab result within 12 hours of sample collection, with
serum samples batched, stored at -20°C and subsequently tested at the end of the study
period. Serial follow-up serum samples were obtained from study participants and a second
swab sample taken from study controls at the time of last blood draw to ensure continued
absence of disease. Additional eligibility criteria for enrolment in the CAST study included
staff being currently employed at the hospital, those fluent in English, and those aged ≥18
years. All participants were counselled appropriately and written informed consent was
obtained. Demographic data including age, gender, ethnicity, medical history as well as
presenting and ongoing symptoms were collected on all participants and transferred to a
confidential secure database for analysis.

Statistical Analyses
At study design stage, it was estimated that the asymptomatic prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
would likely range between 30-40%.16 A recent Spanish study of HCWs found a cumulative
prevalence of 11.2%, with seroprevalence in the general Irish population estimated at 1.7%
and HCW seroprevalence in Ireland reported to be closer to 18%.17,18,19

Testing Strategy
Molecular Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection was initiated on March 16th 2020 and by the end
of July 2020, 398 PCR tests had been completed via the Occupational Health Department on
symptomatic staff with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. From May 12th 2020, the
addition of serological screening was introduced for both symptomatic and asymptomatic
staff at the hospital with a previous or current laboratory-confirmed swab result for SARSCoV-2 infection. Serial blood samples (n=598) were collected on 137 participants who had
either an oro/nasopharyngeal swab taken at study enrolment (n=92) to determine current
infection or a laboratory-confirmed positive swab result (n=45) within the last 6 weeks.
Serial blood draws were obtained every 2-3 weeks for prospective participants with
recovered participants volunteering three samples at approximately day 50, 100 and 160+
post-confirmation of COVID-19 infection. Control participants had a laboratory-confirmed
negative PCR swab at enrolment and again at the time of last blood draw, in order to
confirm ongoing absence of disease. Figure 1 shows the CAST study flow chart.

Viral RNA Detection
SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing was performed on either the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV assay
(manufactured by SeeGene Inc, Rep. of Korea) or Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (manufactured
by Cepheid, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Results were
reported as either “detected” (targets 1 and 2 detected), “presumptive positive” (target 1
not detected; target 2 detected), or “not detected”.

Serology
Serum samples were collected from participants, processed immediately and stored at -20°C
prior to transport to Trinity Biotech, Bray, Ireland for analysis. Samples were tested using
the Captia™ SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay following the manufacturer’s instructions. The assay
utilises ELISA technology for the qualitative detection of IgG in human serum against the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 1 (S1) and 2 (S2) subunits. The Captia™ requires a volume of 10μL
of serum for the detection of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 (10μL diluted with 200μL of
sample diluent). Qualitative results were calculated using the absorbance readings
generated by the samples and kit controls. Serum samples which were discordant with their
corresponding molecular PCR result were also tested using an alternative CE marked kit: the
anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) assay (EUROIMMUN). This assay also utilises ELISA technology
for the qualitative detection of IgG in human serum or plasma against the SARS-CoV-2 S1
subunit. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) requires a sample volume of 10μL for the
detection of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 (10μL diluted with 1mL of sample diluent).
Qualitative results were calculated using the absorbance readings generated by the samples
and kit controls.

In addition, serum samples from all 137 study participants were tested on the Abbott
Architect™ i2000SR instrument using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG75 assay following the
manufacturer’s instructions. This additional method was selected as it is the current chosen
assay used by the Health Service Executive for seroprevalence assessment in Ireland. This
testing took place in the clinical diagnostic laboratory at the Rotunda Hospital. The assay is a
two-step immunoassay using chemiluminescent microparticle technology for qualitative
detection of IgG in human serum or plasma against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein. The

Abbott Architec™t assay requires a volume of 75µL of serum or plasma for the detection of
IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 (25µL test volume and 50µL dead volume). Qualitative results
and index values reported by the instrument were used for analysis.

Results
Of the 1,023 staff at the Rotunda hospital, 44% or 449 (398 symptomatic and 51
asymptomatic controls) individuals were tested between March 16th and July 31st 2020
(Figure 2). In the symptomatic group, 14% (n=54/398) had detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2
RNA in their swab sample. Of the 54 positive staff members during this timeframe, 49
consented to participate in the CAST study. The CAST study enrolled 137 participants in total
(as per Figure 1) and oro/nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results were available for all 137
participants. Five hundred and ninety eight individual serum samples were collected on
these participants, and serological positivity for SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in 98% (48/49)
of PCR positive participants. Study demographics are presented in Table 1, whereby, the
median age of participants is reported as 42 years with almost 90% of participants reporting
no co-morbidity. Less than 32% had close contact with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The first peak of infection of staff in the Rotunda was on 25 th March 2020 when 6 staff
members tested positive.

Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA infection was detected in 4% (2/51) control
participants, with a seropositivity rate in this group of 8% (4/51 asymptomatic seropositive
participants). Table 2 shows testing data for participants with both confirmed SARS-CoV2
infection via PCR and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at Day 50 (using both the
Captia™ and Abbott testing methods). All recovered study participants were approached for

a blood sample up to 6 months post initial infection and samples were obtained from 45 of
these participants. Analysis of these samples was performed by Trinity Biotech using the
Captia™ assay, as before. Results showed that 95% of recovered participants had detectable
antibody in their serum at day 100 with 91% (41/45) continuing to have detectable antiSARS-CoV2 antibody in their serum after day 160. Only 9% (4/45) of participants exhibited a
decrease in detectable levels of antibodies at 6 months post exposure to Covid-19. Data
from the CAST study was used to support a performance claim for the Captia™ SARS-CoV-2
IgG ELISA for Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) at
≥14 days from day 0 (date of oro/nasopharyngeal swab) in a European population.

Consent was obtained from all study participants to allow access to Occupational Health
Covid-19 records and medical history which included presenting, day 5 and day 12
symptoms. The most common presenting symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 positive staff were
cough (67%), sore throat (42%) and fever (37%). At day 5 post positive PCR result, the most
commonly reported symptom remained a cough (45%), with shortness of breath (40%) and
fever (38%) featuring prominently. By day 12 fatigue (36%), cough (32%) and shortness of
breath (21%) were most commonly reported, with just over 23% reporting being symptomfree at this point. Approximately 68% of symptomatic RT-PCR positive participants did not
need any further medical assistance with 30% requiring assessment by a GP, 9% needing
medical assessment in hospital, and one individual requiring hospitalisation for further
management of symptoms. For SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects the average duration of time
absent from work was 21 days from onset of symptoms with the average time to recovery
increasing with increasing age. Staff members over the age of 50 were absent for 5 more
days on average, compared with younger staff aged <50 years.

All recovered staff who previously had a confirmed positive PCR test were contacted in midSeptember and surveyed with regard to ongoing symptoms. In this group, 50% of PCR
positive participants reported having ongoing symptoms and of this group 60% reported
ongoing fatigue, with 28% experiencing continued shortness of breath and a further 20%
reporting ongoing loss of taste and/or smell. Of note, seven have been prescribed a
corticosteroid inhaler for ongoing management of symptoms.

Discussion
Molecular and serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 are being developed and deployed at a
rapid rate. While some serological tests obtained rapid approval during the early phases of
the pandemic, the quality and robustness of many testing methods has been questioned,
with lessons having been learned about high levels of false positive and false negative
results and the implications of this.20,21 Our experience with SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need
for a common legislative framework to ensure that all clinical tests are accurate and
reliable.22 This is especially important as currently there is no gold standard serological
reference method available for SARS-CoV-2.23 In developing a reliable antibody testing
strategy, the focus is often placed on performance characteristics such as sensitivity and
specificity, with operational characteristics, such as ease of use, test type, specimen type
and time to results often deemed less important factors. A balance between these two
elements is vital for the widespread endorsement of any serological testing method. 24

Many point-of-care (POC) lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2
antibodies in blood also exist. However, serious questions have been raised around the
11

specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility and supply of such tests.23,24,25 Conversely though,
their speed, low cost and relative ease of use may have applicability in screening for large
populations, provided performance characteristics can be proven via clinical validation. The
WHO Coordinated Global Research Roadmap for SARS-CoV-2 defines the requirement for
simplified, rapid POC testing technologies that allow infection screening to be decentralised
from the laboratory to remote patient management sites and operated by general
healthcare staff without the requirement for specialised training.8

ELISA-based tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 offer an alternative to the POC tests.
Although more complex than rapid POC assays, ELISA are more sensitive (PPA) and specific
(NPA) and can be performed in a high-throughput manner.9,26 Closed platforms such as the
Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA), and
the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are designed to run on specialised
equipment (Abbott's ARCHITECT™ i1000SR and i2000SR; Roche’s Cobas™ e-analyser) in
hospitals and reference laboratories by highly trained technicians. However, the limitation
of closed platform systems from a single supplier is around supply of reagents, analogous to
the problems with reagents for PCR testing.27

The clinical performance of the Trinity Biotech Captia™ SARS-CoV-2-IgG kit in a healthcare
worker population was evaluated as part of the CAST study. The Positive Percent Agreement
(or estimated sensitivity) and the Negative Percent Agreement (or estimated specificity)
were 95.92% and 100% respectively at >14 days post swab, providing a reliable and robust
methodology for determining IgG levels in healthcare workers with impactful utility in the
medium to long term management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

There has been much discussion regarding antibody levels and their potential associated
protection against SARS-CoV-2 re-infection. A study on SARS, a similar coronavirus to SARSCoV-2, showed recovered individuals maintained neutralising antibodies for two years on
average.28 In addition, antibody responses in individuals with laboratory-confirmed MERSCoV infection lasted for at least 34 months after the outbreak.29 Long et al. and more
recently Ward et al. have suggested a rapid decay of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, although our
findings do not support this assertion.30,31 Ward’s seroprevalence study on a large
population in the U.K using lateral flow immunoassay testing found that healthcare workers
along with ethnic minorities and care home workers were disproportionately affected by
the pandemic with more positive test results.32 Interestingly, higher numbers of healthcare
workers demonstrated persistence of antibody levels over serial time points whereas an
overall decline in the general population was observed in this study.29

We report that over 90% of our study participants had detectable levels of anti-SARS-CoV2
IgG in their serum up to six months post infection. In our laboratory-confirmed positive
participants, 98% were seropositive using the Captia™ assay (Trinity Biotech) at day 50 and
100, with 91% seropositive at day 160+, indicating a small decline in the number of
participants maintaining a seropositive status. When using the Architect™ assay (Abbott) on
the same participant cohort, only 80% of participants were detected as being seropositive at
day 100. The Captia™ assay (Trinity Biotech) utilises the Spike protein as a capture antigen
while the Architect™ assay (Abbott) utilises the Nucleocapsid protein, which is interesting to
note as the Abbott assay is a serological assay utilised by the Irish Health Service Executive
(HSE) for their seroprevalence study.18

Recommendations for healthcare workers at the time of the study were to adhere to strict
public health guidelines; namely use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE),
social distancing where possible, careful hand hygiene and appropriate cough etiquette. A
series of additional measures were introduced to the hospital at various points between
March and July 2020 (Figure 2). These protective measures helped to reduce infection levels
within the hospital. With 55% of positive cases reporting additional household members
being symptomatic, household/community transmission rather than workplace transmission
became the most common route of infection transmission for our hospital staff. High local
hygiene standards and introduction of additional hygiene measures led to a rapid decrease
in numbers of staff infections. Of the 54 positive staff diagnosed during the study
timeframe, 45 close contacts were identified with 62% of these close contacts (28/45)
becoming symptomatic and requiring subsequent testing. However only six of the close
contacts identified returned a positive result (13%), with two thirds of cases linked to
household or community transmission.

More recent reports across media platforms and in the literature describe long term or
ongoing symptoms of the virus which greatly impacts the physical and mental health of
those affected.5,6,7 This aligns with our findings whereby post-viral symptoms persist in 50%
of our cohort of COVID-19 positive participants. The true ongoing health consequences
among HCWs have yet to be realised. Early identification of SARS-CoV-2 positive HCW is
crucial to avoid virus transmission between staff members and to maximize the available
workforce.

Study Limitations
This study was carried out shortly after the first pandemic peak in March 2020. Although our
study cohort reported mild symptoms with few hospitalisations, as healthcare workers
ongoing contact with each other and with patients increased the overall risk category of
these individuals. Therefore, a limitation of this study is that our study group is a high risk
group compared to the general population.29

Conclusion
Accurate testing with high sensitivity and specificity is essential in helping understand and
manage the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Healthcare workers are among the high risk groups in
society with higher numbers of positive tests amongst the population. Longevity of antibody
status as well as transmission of the virus and ongoing symptoms in this population is of
great interest. Our findings confirm positive antibody status in 91% of those with confirmed
PCR tests up to 160+ Days post infection. The CaptiaTM SARS-CoV-2 IgG kit provides a
methodology for detecting IgG antibodies in healthcare workers and other populations with
impactful utility in the medium to long term management of the COVID-19 pandemic.
