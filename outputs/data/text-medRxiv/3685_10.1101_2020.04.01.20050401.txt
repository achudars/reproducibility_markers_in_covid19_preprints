Abstract: When a region tries to prevent an outbreak of an epidemic, like that of COVID-19,
two broad strategies are initially available: limiting the inflow of infected cases using travel
10

restrictions and quarantines, and reducing the transmissions from inflowing cases using contact
tracing and community interventions. A large number of papers have used epidemiological
models to argue that inflow restrictions are unlikely to be effective. We conduct a mathematical
analysis using a simple epidemiological model and perform simulations which show how this
conclusion changes if we relax the assumption of unlimited capacity in containment efforts such

15

as contact tracing. In particular, when contact tracing is effective, but the system is close to being
overwhelmed, moderate travel restrictions can have a very large effect on the probability of an
epidemic.
1. Introduction
Two main factors determine whether and when a region will be affected by an epidemic like the

20

current COVID-19 outbreak. The first factor is the rate 𝜆 at which infectious individuals (either

visitors or returning local residents) enter the country. The second factor is the probability 𝜋 that
such an entry gives rise to a major outbreak.1
Potential preventive measures by health authorities can hence target reduction of 𝜆, by e.g. travel
restrictions or quarantines, or reduction of 𝜋, by e.g. contact tracing in conjunction with isolating
5

the imported cases (henceforth “contact tracing”). Quite often preventive measures aim at
reducing both of these factors.
Contact tracing can be fully effective (i.e., 𝜋 = 0) if it manages to bring the epidemic’s effective
reproduction number 𝑅 below 1 during the early stage of the outbreak, where 𝑅 is defined as the
expected number of infections caused by a typical infected individual. Intuitively, a large

10

outbreak is not possible if each infected individual, on average, spreads the disease to less than
one other individual.
We use a simple epidemic model to analyze the effects of reducing 𝜋 and 𝜆 on epidemic
outbreaks. The background to our work is a literature that has found small effects from
regulating 𝜆. Anzai et al. show that inflow reduction alone (assuming 𝜋 > 0) cannot prevent an

15

epidemic outbreak from taking place and at best delays epidemic onset, often for just a very
limited time (1). T Chinazzi et al. study the effect of reducing the inflow of infected individuals
while simultaneously reducing 𝜋 in the community at large and also find that inflow reduction
has only a marginal delay effect unless 𝜋 is reduced drastically (2). These pessimistic findings
reflect those from a large number of earlier models (3-8). The World Health Organization’s 2014

Our analysis focuses on the probability of an epidemic outbreak. We do not study the subsequent evolution of the
disease after this event. In general, inflow restrictions become inconsequential once the amount of local transmission
is much larger than the number of import cases.

23 papers and concluded that a 90% reduction in international air travel would only slow down a
pandemic by 3-4 weeks and would not prevent the introduction of a pandemic into any given
country (9).
We focus on the joint effect of inflow reduction and contact tracing. Contact tracing is
5

incorporated in our model by having two different outbreak probabilities, one negligible for
incoming cases that are contact traced, and another much higher probability for incoming cases
that are not contact traced. If no one is contact traced, then reductions in 𝜆 have only very modest
effects, in line with the previous results mentioned above. Furthermore, if every infected inflow
is contact traced and contact tracing is fully effective, then changing the inflow rate 𝜆 is still

10

ineffectual, since there will never be an epidemic outbreak. Hence, in the extreme cases where
either no one or everyone is contact traced, changing 𝜆 does not meaningfully affect the
probability of an outbreak.
However, this conclusion relies critically on there being unlimited capacity in contact tracing,
i.e., that all imported cases are contact traced nearly flawlessly irrespective of how many are

15

currently being traced. We argue that when contact tracing has limited capacity but is still
effective, reducing 𝜆 may well be very effective in reducing the risk of an outbreak. Regulating 𝜆
is particularly important when the contact tracing system is close to being overwhelmed by new
cases arriving from outside, in which case even moderate reductions in 𝜆 can strongly reduce the
probability of an epidemic outbreak.

20

Since contact tracing is both resource- and labor-intensive, we believe that our limited capacity
assumption is reasonable. We also conjecture that, while our model is simple, our qualitative
findings will translate to more realistic setups. Hence, we think that epidemiological models used
for policy analysis should incorporate capacity constraints, since they might otherwise

underestimate the potential of travel restrictions to prevent epidemic outbreaks (or the reemergence of an epidemic).
2. Model
2.1 Setup
5

Formally, we study a stochastic epidemic model where infected cases arrive at some Poisson rate
𝜆. Absent contact tracing, each new case leads to an epidemic outbreak with some probability
𝜋!" > 0. The containment effort consists of contact tracing that reduces the probability of an
epidemic outbreak to 𝜋 " ≥ 0. We say that contact tracing is effective if 𝜋 " = 0 and is imperfect
if 𝜋 " > 0.

10

To model potential capacity constraints, we assume that contact tracing is conducted by a set of
𝑛 teams which process every case arrival with an intensity 𝜇 (so the mean time for completing
contact tracing is 1/𝜇). If a case arrives when at least one team is free, that case has probability
𝜋 " of leading to an epidemic. If all teams are occupied when an infected case arrives, that case is
lost to the system and causes an epidemic with probability 𝜋!" . We say that contact tracing has

15

unlimited capacity if 𝑛 = ∞ and has limited capacity if 𝑛 < ∞.
This setup can be modelled as a queuing system where the state is the number of people
currently in the contact tracing system. To analyze the probability of an epidemic outbreak at
different time horizons, we add the outbreak as an additional, absorbing state. The setup is
illustrated in Fig. 1.

20

2.2 The effect of contact tracing on outbreak probability
With this setup, we consider the effect of varying 𝜆 under four different combinations of cases:
contact tracing being imperfect versus effective and having unlimited versus limited capacity.

Doing this, we confirm the recent literature’s main finding: varying 𝜆 is relatively
inconsequential when capacity is unlimited. We also find, however, that varying 𝜆 can be very
important when contact tracing is effective but has limited capacity. We proceed by discussing
each case in turn.2
5

Case 1 – Imperfect contract tracing with unlimited capacity: In this case, there is an epidemic
outbreak at a constant rate 𝜆𝜋 " > 0. At a horizon 𝑡, the probability of an outbreak is
𝑝#$ (𝑡) = 𝑒 %&'! ( .
Reducing 𝜆 can proportionally delay the outbreak but cannot stop it.
Case 2 – Effective contact tracing with unlimited capacity: In this case, all arriving cases have

10

zero probability of causing an epidemic. Thus, regardless of 𝜆, there will not be an outbreak.
Case 3 – Imperfect contact tracing with limited capacity: In this case, epidemics break out at a
rate 𝜆𝜋 " when the contact tracing system is below capacity and at a rate 𝜆𝜋!" > 𝜆𝜋 " when at
capacity. In contrast with Case 1, reducing 𝜆 has the benefit of reducing the probability of being
at full capacity. However, since the containment system is not fully effective, reducing 𝜆 can still

15

only delay the outbreak.
Case 4 – Effective contact tracing with limited capacity: In this case, epidemics do not occur
when the contact tracing system is below capacity but do occur at a rate 𝜆𝜋!" > 0 when at
capacity. Thus, by preventing the system from reaching full capacity, reducing 𝜆 can be very
effective at preventing outbreaks. The effect of 𝜆 can also be highly non-linear. Indeed, unless

the queue was truncated at 𝑛, the value 𝜆 = 𝑛𝜇 would be a critical value where the system
discretely would change from being a subcritical to a supercritical system.3
3. Simulation
To illustrate our findings, we perform simulations varying 𝜆 under each of these four different
5

cases. All simulation parameters are given in Table 1. We assume that when capacity is limited,
there are 𝑛 = 100 tracing teams and cases are handled by a team, on average, in two days (i.e.,
𝜇 = 0.5). We consider three infected case arrival rates: a baseline rate 𝜆 = 80, a moderate
reduction 𝜆 = 40, and a strong reduction 𝜆 = 20.4 When contact tracing is imperfect, we assume
that 𝜋 " = 0.1%, and when contact tracing is effective, we assume that that 𝜋 " = 0.001%.5 In

the absence of any contact tracing, we assume that 𝜋!" = 10%.
The results for each case are displayed in Fig. 2, with the number of days on the horizontal axis
and the probability of epidemic outbreak on the vertical axis. The first row shows the first two
cases, where contact tracing has unlimited capacity. In the left-hand panel, contact tracing is
imperfect, and reducing 𝜆 only delays the outbreak. In the right-hand panel, contact tracing is

15

effective and there is a low probability of an outbreak independent of 𝜆.
The second row shows the two cases where contract tracing has limited capacity. In the left-hand
panel, contact tracing is imperfect and the result is qualitatively similar to the case with unlimited
capacity; reducing 𝜆 only delays the epidemic, with a somewhat stronger effect in that the
epidemic starts immediately in the absence of inflow restrictions. In contrast, when contact

We use a strictly positive value in order to capture how even a contact tracing system that generally reduces 𝑅
below 1 can still miss an infection chain by a stroke of bad luck.

tracing is effective, the result is very different than with unlimited capacity. This case is shown in
the right-hand panel, where reducing 𝜆 can change the probability of an epidemic from a virtual
certainty to almost nil by preventing the tracing system from being overwhelmed.
Taking stock, we conclude that introducing capacity constraints can imply large changes in the
5

effectiveness of inflow restrictions. Instead of inflow restrictions leading to a gradual delay of an
epidemic, there are non-linear effects once the system goes below capacity. Thus, in cases where
systems are at the risk of being overrun, even moderate travel restrictions can be highly effective
in reducing the risk for a local epidemic.
While most rich countries are now beyond the point of preventing domestic outbreaks of

10

COVID-19, we believe that the reasoning in this paper is still relevant for countries that have
outbreaks that are later brought under control. In these cases, inflow restrictions may be helpful
in preventing an epidemic from re-emerging, as they allow the country to stay below capacity in
their contact tracing efforts.
