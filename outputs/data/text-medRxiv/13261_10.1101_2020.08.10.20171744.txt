A novel testing policy was implemented in May in France to systematically screen potential COVID-19
infections and suppress local outbreaks while lifting lockdown restrictions. 20,777 virologically-confirmed
cases were notified in mainland France from May 13, 2020 (week 20, end of lockdown) to June 28 (week 26).
Accounting for missing data, positive tests before symptom onset, and the delay from symptom onset to test,
this corresponds to 14,061 [95% CI 13,972-14,156] cases with symptom onset during this period, a likely
underestimation of the real number. Using age-stratified transmission models parameterized to behavioral
data and calibrated to regional hospital admissions, we estimated that 103,907 [95% CI 90,216-116,377]
COVID-19 symptomatic cases occurred, suggesting that 9 out of 10 cases with symptoms were not
ascertained. Median detection rate increased from 7% [6-8]% to 38% [35-44]% over time, with large regional
variations. Healthcare-seeking behavior in COVID-19 suspect cases remained low (31%). Model projections
for the incidence of symptomatic cases (6.7 [5.8, 7.4] per 100,000 in week 26) were compatible with
estimates from participatory surveillance, provided that 80% of suspect cases consulted. Encouraging
awareness and same-day healthcare-seeking behavior in suspect cases is critical to improve detection. The
capacity of the system remained however insufficient even at the low levels of viral circulation achieved after
lockdown, and was predicted to deteriorate rapidly for increasing epidemic activity. Substantially more
aggressive, targeted, and efficient testing with easier access is required to act as a pandemic-fighting tool.
These elements should be considered in light of the currently observed increase of cases in France and other
European countries.

As countries in Western Europe gradually relaxed lockdown restrictions, robust surveillance and detection
systems became critical to monitor the epidemic situation and maintain activity at low levels1. The need is to
rapidly identify and isolate cases to prevent onward transmission in the community and avoid substantial
resurgence of cases. In France, the surveillance strategy implemented by authorities to exit lockdown on May
11, 2020 was multifold2 and based on an expanded case definition for COVID-19 suspect cases to guide
clinical diagnosis3; recommendations to the general population to seek healthcare even in presence of mild
symptoms; prescription of diagnostic tests to suspect cases by general practitioners for systematic and
comprehensive testing; isolation of confirmed cases and tracing of their contacts.
The specific characteristics of COVID-19 epidemic, however, hinder the identification of cases4. Large
proportions of asymptomatic infectious individuals5, and presence of mild or paucisymptomatic infections
that easily go unobserved6,7 present serious challenges to detection and control7–9. This may potentially result
in substantial underestimates of the real number of COVID-19 cases in the country. Here we estimated the
rate of detection of COVID-19 symptomatic cases in France in May-June 2020 after lockdown, through the use
of virological and participatory syndromic surveillance data coupled with mathematical transmission models
calibrated to regional hospitalizations. The study focused on mainland France where the epidemic situation
was comparable across regions, and excluded Corsica reporting a very limited epidemic activity and overseas
territories characterized by increasing transmission10.

COVID-19 surveillance
COVID-19 epidemic management in France in the post-lockdown phase involved the creation of a centralized
database collecting data on virological testing (SI-DEP, Information system for testing) to provide indicators
to monitor the epidemic over time2,11. All individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 were invited
to consult their general practitioner and obtain a prescription for a virological test. Contacts of confirmed
cases were traced and tested. SI-DEP centralizes results of all virological tests conducted in France. 20,777
virologically-confirmed cases were notified from May 13 (week 20) to June 28 (week 26) in mainland France.
These include positive individuals with or without symptoms at the time of testing, or positive individuals for
which information on clinical status at the time of testing was missing. Accounting for presymptomatic
individuals among those presenting with no symptoms at the time of testing and after imputation of missing
data (see Methods), an estimated 16,165 [95%CI 16,101-16,261] symptomatic cases were tested in the study
period (Figure 1). The average delay from symptom onset to testing decreased from 12.5 days in week 20
(w20) to 2.8 days in w26. Accounting for this delay (see Methods), we estimated that 14,061 [13,972-14,156]
confirmed symptomatic cases had onset of symptoms in the study period, showing a decreasing trend over
time (2,493 in w20, 1,647 in w26). The test positivity rate decreased in the first weeks and stabilized around
1.2% (average over w24-w26).
A digital participatory system was additionally considered for COVID-19 syndromic surveillance in the
general population10, including those who do not consult a doctor. Called COVIDnet.fr, it was adapted from
the platform GrippeNet.fr (dedicated to influenza-like-illness surveillance since 201112,13) to respond to the
COVID-19 health crisis in early 2020. It is based on a set of volunteers who weekly self-declare their
symptoms, along with socio-demographic information. Based on symptoms declared by an average of 7,500
participants each week, the estimated incidence of COVID-19 suspect cases decreased from about 1% to 0.8%
over time (Figure 1), according to the expanded suspect case definition recommended by the High Council of
Public Health for testing3 (Methods). 162 out of 524 suspect cases (31%) consulted a doctor in the study
period. Among them, 89 (55%) received a prescription for a test, resulting in screening for 50 individuals
(56% of those given the prescription).

Figure 1. Virological surveillance, participatory syndromic surveillance, behavioral data for model parameterization. (a)
Estimated number of virologically-confirmed symptomatic cases in mainland France by week of testing and week of onset, along with the
test positivity rate. Estimates are based on imputation of positive individuals without symptoms at the time of testing into asymptomatic
or presymptomatic; imputation of missing data on clinical status at the time of testing into asymptomatic, presymptomatic, or
symptomatic; imputation of the date of onset of symptoms for presymptomatic and symptomatic cases. Uncertainties correspond to 95%
CI. Week of symptom onset for symptomatic cases was estimated based on patients’ declarations (see panel b) through a monthly
Gamma distribution fitted to the data with a maximum likelihood approach. Missing data about presence/absence of symptoms were
imputed by region and by week, by sampling from a multinomial distribution according to the observed breakdown among cases with
complete information (see Methods). Test positivity rate was computed on cases with complete information. Data for weeks 20-26 were
consolidated in w30. (b) Breakdown of virologically-confirmed cases with symptoms and complete information in SI-DEP database by
week of testing according to declared onset of symptoms. Estimated time from onset to testing is also shown (right y axis, median and

Projections of COVID-19 epidemic trajectories and estimated detection rates
We used stochastic discrete age-stratified epidemic models16,17 based on demography, age profile18, and social
contact data19 of the 12 regions of mainland France, to account for age-specific contact activity and role in
COVID-19 transmission. Disease progression is specific to COVID-1916,17 and parameterized with current
knowledge to include presymptomatic transmission20, asymptomatic5 and symptomatic infections with
different degrees of severity (paucisymptomatic, with mild symptoms, with severe symptoms requiring
hospitalization)7,21–23. The model was shown to capture the transmission dynamics of the epidemic in Île-deFrance and was used to assess the impact of lockdown and exit strategies16,17. Full details are reported in the
Methods section and in the Supplementary Material.

Intervention measures were modeled as mechanistic modifications of the contact matrices, accounting for a
reduction of the number of contacts engaged in specific settings, and were informed from empirical data (see
Methods). Lockdown data came from Refs.16,17. The exit phase was modeled considering region-specific data
of attendance at school based on Ministry of Education’s data24, partial maintenance of telework according to
estimated presence in workplaces from mobile phones location history data14 (Figure 1), reduction in
adoption of physical distancing over time based on survey data15 (Figure 1), senior protection15, partial
reopening of activities. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the reopening of activities, as data were
missing for an accurate parameterization of associated contacts. Testing and isolation of detected cases were
implemented by considering a 90% reduction of contacts for the number of virologically-confirmed COVID-19
cases16,17. Region-specific models were fitted to regional hospital admission data (Figure 2) through a
maximum likelihood approach in the phases before lockdown, during lockdown, and in the exit phase.
Further details are reported in the Methods section and Supplementary Material.

[8,623-14,136] to 1,704 [1,258 -2,004] from w20 to w26), followed by Grand Est and Hauts-de-France (Table
1, Table S3 of the Supplementary Material).
Projections were substantially higher than virologically-confirmed cases (Figures 2 and 3). The estimated
detection rate for symptomatic infections in mainland France in the period w20-w26 was 14% [12-16]%,
suggesting that slightly less than 9 out of 10 new cases with symptoms were not identified by the surveillance
system. Estimated detection rate increased over time (7% [6-8]% in w20, 38% [35-44]% in w26). By the end
of June, 5 regions had a median detection above 50%, and 6 regions detected a number of cases within the
confidence interval of model projections (Fig. 3b-d, Table 1). All regions except Brittany displayed average
increasing trends in the estimated detection rate in June compared to May. We did not find significant
associations between the detection rate and the number of detected cases by week of onset, or the positivity
rate of performed tests (Supplementary Material). However, the detection rate was negatively associated
with the model-predicted incidence (Spearman correlation 𝑟 = −0.75, 𝑝 < 10!"# ; Fig. 3f). In addition, the
data followed a power-law function, 𝜋 = 66 ∙ 𝑖 !$.#" , where 𝜋 is the weekly detection rate of symptomatic
cases (expressed in %) and 𝑖 is the projected weekly incidence of symptomatic cases (expressed in cases per
100,000). This function quantifies the relation, in the study period, between the detection capacity of the testtrace-isolate system and the viral circulation in the population. It clearly shows that capacity rapidly drops as
epidemic activity increases.
Validation of the model was performed in two ways. First, we compared our model projections of the
percentage of infected population with the results of three independent seroprevalence studies performed
after the first wave in France25–27. Modeling results are in agreement with serological estimates at national
and regional level and at different points in time (Fig. 3e for the comparison with the serological study
performed on a representative sample of the population, at the national level; results by region and with the
other two serological studies are provided in the Supplementary Material). Second, we compared the
projected incidence of COVID-19 symptomatic cases in w26 (6.69 [5.84-7.37] per 100,000) with the value
obtained from virologically-confirmed cases (2.55 [2.48-2.61] per 100,000) and two estimates based on
COVIDnet.fr data (Fig. 3g). The first estimate applies the measured test positivity rate to the incidence of selfreported COVID-19 suspect cases (estimate #1, yielding 8.6 [95% CI 6.2-11.5] per 100,000); the second
additionally assumes that only 55% would be confirmed as suspect case by a physician and prescribed a test
(according to COVIDnet.fr data on consulting participants, estimate #2, yielding 4.7 [3.4-6.3] per 100,000).
Our projections are in line with plausible estimates from COVIDnet.fr, and suggest that on average at least
80% of suspect cases should be tested to recover the predicted incidence.
Sensitivity analysis showed that findings were robust against elements of the contact matrices that could not
be informed by empirical data (Supplementary Material). Also, a model selection analysis showed that
changes in the contact patterns over time due to restrictions and activities of individuals of different age
classes during the exit phase (e.g. for partial attendance at school, telework) are needed to accurately capture
the transmission dynamics (Supplementary Material).
The detection rate of asymptomatic cases was computed assuming a delay from infection to test based on the
infection-to-onset distribution of the compartmental model and onset-to-test delay of symptomatic
individuals (see Methods), as no additional information on the cases was available to inform the date of
infection. We found lower detection rates for asymptomatic individuals, ranging from 2.8% [2.5-3.3]% in w20
to 14.7% [13.2-16.8]% in w26 for mainland France (see also Supplementary Material).

Discussion
Despite a test positivity rate in mainland France well below WHO recommendations (5%)28, a substantial
proportion of symptomatic cases (9 out of 10) remained undetected in the first 7 weeks following the end of
lockdown. Around 90,000 symptomatic infections were not ascertained by the surveillance system from May
11 to June 28, 2020, according to our estimates.
Surveillance improved substantially over time. Detection rate was estimated to be 7% [6-8]% at the national
level in mid-May, in line with estimates for the same period from a seroprevalence study in Geneva,
Switzerland29. By the end of June, it increased to 38% [35-44]%, leaving about 6 cases with symptoms out of
10 undetected. Six regions (Hauts de France, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Occitanie, Nouvelle Aquitaine, CentreVal de Loire, Normandy) reported cases compatible with model projections. Improvement could have
resulted from the combination of different aspects. On one side, the new surveillance framework may have
progressively strengthened with increasing resources and capacity over time, as signaled for example by a
more rapid detection of cases (78% reduction of the delay from symptom onset to testing from May to June).
On the other side, the system certainly benefited from a substantial and concurrent decrease of the epidemic
activity in all regions.
Despite this positive trend, our findings highlight structural limitations and a critical need for improvement.
Some regions remained with limited diagnostic exhaustiveness by the end of June. This is particularly
concerning in those regions predicted to have a large number of weekly infections, such as Île-de-France
where approximately only 1 out of 3 cases with symptoms were detected by the end of June, and Grand Est (2
out of 10). Novel recommendations since the end of lockdown require that all patients with symptoms
suggestive of COVID-19 (as well as contacts of a confirmed case) be screened for SARS-CoV-22. Almost all
cases (92% since May 25) clinically diagnosed by sentinel general practitioners as possible COVID-19 cases
were prescribed a test10. However, only 31% of individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms consulted a doctor
in the study period according to participatory surveillance data. Overall, these figures suggest that a large

number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases were not screened because they did not seek medical care despite
recommendations. A similar evidence emerged from a large-scale serological study in Spain where only
between 16% and 20% of symptomatic participants with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 reported a previous
virological screening30. By combining estimates from virological and participatory surveillance, we
extrapolated an incidence of symptomatic cases from crowdsourced data that is compatible with model
projections, under the hypothesis that the large majority of suspect cases would get tested. This finding
further supports testing for all COVID-19 suspect cases, and suggests that the requirement of the test
prescription can be lifted. Large-scale communication campaigns should reinforce recommendations to raise
awareness in the population and strongly encourage healthcare-seeking behavior especially in patients with
mild symptoms. At the same time, investigations to identify reasons for not consulting could be quickly
performed through the participatory surveillance system.
Red tape might have contributed to low testing rates. Prescription for a test was deemed compulsory in the
new testing policy to prevent misuse of diagnostic resources2, however the path involving consultation,
prescription, and lab appointment may have discouraged mildly affected individuals not requiring medical
assistance. To facilitate access, testing should not require a prescription, as then established by authorities at
the end of July31. In addition, some local initiatives emerged over summer that increased the number of drivethrough testing facilities, mailed test vouchers to promote massive screening in certain regions (e.g. in Île-deFrance32), offered temporary mobile testing facilities (buses, pavilions) to increase proximity with the
population33. These initiatives are particularly relevant for counteracting socio-economic inequalities in
access to information and care in populations vulnerable to COVID-1934. However, such strategies should not
hinder a testing protocol targeting suspect index cases, and subsequent follow-up through contact tracing
investigations. Our results indeed show that high testing efforts, measured by low test positivity rates, are not
necessarily associated to high rates of detection. This was also observed in the UK during the first wave when
detection remained low despite the large number of tests performed (and low positivity rate)35. Without a
strong case-based surveillance, the risk is to disperse resources towards random individuals without
symptoms who are unlikely to be positive. This might saturate the test-trace-isolate machinery, without
achieving the low level of viral circulation required to safeguard the hospital system. The large demand for
testing observed over summer in certain regions, mainly as a result of imminent travels and protocols
imposed by certain countries and air companies, as well as untargeted recommendations, reportedly caused
long waiting lists and overwhelmed testing sites36. Delays from onset to screening were still longer than 48h
at the end of June, and delays in providing results increased over time, from 1-2 days to about 1 week or
longer37. Given pre-symptomatic transmission, notification to contacts should be almost immediate to allow
the effective interruption of transmission chains20. For testing to be an actionable tool for surveillance and,
most importantly, for control of COVID-19 transmission, delays should be suppressed and screening rates
radically increased and better targeted. Over May-June the average weekly number of tests was 250,000,
remaining well below the objective originally fixed by authorities (700,000). In these conditions, we found
that the capacity of detection of the test-trace-isolate system scaled as the inverse of the square root of the
incidence, rapidly deteriorating already at low incidence levels. The system was predicted to be able to detect
more than 2 cases out of 3 (rate>66%) only if the incidence was lower than 1 symptomatic case per 100,000,
a figure 50 times smaller than what we projected at the exit from lockdown at the national level. This
suggests that, even right after lockdown, the system was unable to perform the comprehensive surveillance of
suspect cases recommended by WHO28 while phasing out the restrictions. More aggressive testing should be
performed at low activity level to keep the epidemic under control. Failing in doing so leads to a rapid and
uncontrolled increase of cases with large-scale transmission in the community9, as currently reported in
European countries38. Such risk is even stronger if the relaxation in preventive behaviors persists due to
adhesion fatigue15, as reported during summer.

The number of tests increased over time after the study period, together with changes in the testing policy
(test prescription was not needed anymore). Such improvement, however, was a reactive response to the first
resurgence of cases in certain regions in France in July, and thus likely counterbalanced by a larger incidence
of cases. Future studies should determine if the relationship between detection and incidence that we found
is robust over time, as that relationship is key to estimate the needed capacity in terms of number of tests per
week, to fine-tune the testing strategy, as well as the length and intensity of the restrictive measures put in
place to reduce the viral circulation to manageable levels.
Aggressive and efficient testing will become increasingly more important in the fall and winter months, as
other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, RSV, rhinoviruses, will start to circulate. Reviewing the testing
strategy while at low COVID-19 epidemic activity, is an important opportunity to strengthen French response
system for the next season.
Models were region-based and did not consider a possible coupling between regional epidemics caused by
mobility. This choice was supported by stringent movement restrictions during lockdown39, and by the
limited mobility increase in May-June40, before important inter-regional displacements took place at the start
of summer holidays in July. Foreign importations were neglected8,41 as France reopened its borders with EU
Member States on June 15, and the Schengen area remained closed till July. COVIDnet.fr cohort is not
representative of the general population13, however the agreement found with sentinel incidence trends for
influenza-like-illness suggests that these limitations have little effect once results are adjusted for lack of
representativeness12. Underdetection may also proceed from the imperfect characteristics of RT-PCR (reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction) tests used to identify infected cases42. Some cases tested for SARSCoV-2 could have been falsely negative, e.g. because tested too early after the infection. This would affect the
analysis presented in the manuscript and would be in line with our conclusion that a large part of cases may
have been undetected. A previous work assessed the rate of underdection of symptomatic cases in 210
countries35, but it mainly focused on the early global dynamics. Our model gives up geographical extension for
higher data quality in a specific country, thus providing a novel synthesis of data sources characterizing
human behavior over time and space with virological and participatory surveillance data. Our model clearly
identifies in the targeted testing of symptomatic cases the weak link of epidemic response, which requires
prompt improvement. Our projections were validated with serological estimates after the first wave and
participatory surveillance estimates in the exit phase after lockdown. Model selection demonstrated the
importance of data sources describing changes of human behavior. The study was not extended to the
summer months, because of (i) the challenge of mechanistically parameterizing the contact matrices during
summer holidays, (ii) the increase of movement fluxes across regions weakening our assumption of regionspecific models, and (ii) the interruption of COVIDnet.fr surveillance during the summer break preventing the
identification of the key factors behind case underascertainment.
Our findings identify critical needs of improvement to increase case ascertainment in France and the
performance of the response system to monitor and control COVID-19 epidemic. Substantially more
aggressive and efficient testing targeting COVID-19 suspect cases needs to be achieved to act as a pandemicfighting tool. Associated logistical needs should not be underestimated. These elements should be considered
in light of the increase of cases currently observed in France and in other countries in Europe with similar
response systems.

Methods
Virological surveillance data. The centralized database SI-DEP for virological surveillance11 collects all tests
performed in France for any reason. In the period under study, guidelines recommended to consult a general
practitioner at the first sign of COVID-19-like symptoms and obtain a prescription for a virological test

(prescription was compulsory to access the test). In addition, routine testing was performed for patients
admitted to the hospital with any diagnosis, healthcare personnel, and individuals at other facilities (e.g. in
some senior homes or long-term healthcare facilities). Data report detailed information on individuals tested
in France, including (i) date of test, (ii) result of test (positive or negative), (iii) location (region), (iv) absence
or presence of symptoms at the time of testing, (v) self-declared delay between onset to test in presence of
symptoms. The delay is provided with the following breakdown: onset date occurring 0-1 day before date of
test, 2-4 days before, 5-7 days before, 8-15 days before, or >15 days before. For some tests, information on
(iv) and (v) is missing. The SI-DEP database provided complete information for 23,210 (66%) out of 35,264
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases tested between week 20 (May 11-May 17) and week 30 (July 19-July
26), with an increasing trend of complete information over time (see Supplementary Material). The study
referred to the period from w20 to w26. Data up to w30 were used to consolidate the data in the study period
accounting for the delays.
Imputation of asymptomatic vs. presymptomatic cases, of onset date, and of missing information.
Individuals who tested positive on a given date were recorded in the SI-DEP database as: cases with
symptoms at the time of testing, with a self-declared delay from onset of symptoms; cases without symptoms
at the time of testing; or cases with no information on presence/absence of symptoms at the time of testing.
These three subsets of cases were analysed to account for presence of presymptomatic individuals among
those with no symptoms at time of testing, imputation of missing data, estimation of dates of infection or
symptom onset.

For laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with symptoms at the time of testing, we estimated their date
of onset using the information on the date of test and the time-interval of onset-to-test delay self-declared
by the patients (Fig. 1b). We fitted a Gamma distribution to onset-to-test delay data with a maximum
likelihood approach, using three different periods of time (May, June, July), to account for changes in the
distribution of self-declared delays over time (i.e. longer delays at the beginning of the study period,
shorter delays at its end). We obtained average delays of 12.9 days in May, 5.1 days in June, 2.7 days in
July (Supplementary Material). July data was used to consolidate data corresponding to infections with
onset in June and tested with delay. Given a confirmed case with symptoms testing on a specific date, we
assigned the onset date by sampling the onset-to-testing delay from the fitted distribution for that period,
conditional to the fact that the delay lies in the corresponding time-interval declared by the patient. The
imputation procedure was carried out 100 times. Results were aggregated by week of onset.
For laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with no symptoms at the time of testing, we assumed that on
average 40% of them were asymptomatic5 (see transmission model subsection), whereas the remaining
60% were presymptomatic who tested early thanks to contact tracing. Imputation was done by sampling
from a binomial distribution and repeated 100 times. Data on contact tracing could not be used to inform
data on infection or symptom onset, because of national regulatory framework on privacy. Given the low
sensitivity of PCR tests in the early phase of the incubation period, we considered that imputed
presymptomatic cases belonged to the prodromic phase, and estimated their onset date based on the
structure of our compartmental model. For imputed asymptomatic, we assumed the same delay from
infection to testing as in cases with symptoms (see Supplementary Material). Imputation of the dates
were repeated 100 times.
For laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with no information on symptoms at the time of testing,
missing data were imputed by sampling from a multinomial distribution with probabilities equal to the
rate of occurrence of the outcomes (asymptomatic, presymptomatic, or symptomatic with 5 possible
time-intervals for the onset-to-test delay) reported for cases with complete information, and assuming
the imputation of cases without symptoms into asymptomatic and presymptomatic, as described above.
Imputation was performed by region and by week and repeated 100 times. Presymptomatic and

symptomatic individuals were aggregated together by onset date to estimate the rate of detection of
symptomatic cases.
Participatory surveillance data and analysis. COVIDnet.fr is a participatory online system for the
surveillance of COVID-19, available at www.covidnet.fr. It was adapted from GrippeNet.fr to respond to the
COVID-19 health crisis in March 2020. GrippeNet.fr is a participatory system for the surveillance of influenzalike-illness available in France since 2011 through a collaboration between Inserm, Sorbonne Université
and Sante publique France, supplementing sentinel surveillance12,13,43. The system is based on a dedicated
website to conduct syndromic surveillance through self-reported symptoms volunteered by participants
resident in France. Data are collected on a weekly basis; participants also provide detailed profile information
at enrollment. In addition to tracking influenza-like-illness incidence12,43, GrippeNet.fr was used to estimate
vaccine coverage in specific subgroups44 individual perceptions toward vaccination45 and health-seeking
behavior46. It was also used to assess behaviors and perceptions related to other diseases beyond influenza47.
Participants are on average older and include a larger proportion of women compared to the general
population13,48. Participating population is however representative in terms of health indicators such as
diabetes and asthma conditions. Despite these discrepancies, trends of estimated influenza-like-illness
incidence from GrippeNet.fr reports compared well with those of the national sentinel system12,43. All
analyses were adjusted by age and sex of participants.
To monitor COVID-19 suspect cases in the general population, we used the expanded case definition
recommended by the High Council of Public Health for systematic testing and described in their 20 April 2020
notice3:
• (Sudden onset of symptoms OR sudden onset of fever) AND (fever OR chills) AND (cough OR shortness of
breath OR (chest pain AND age > 5 years old))
• OR (Sudden onset of symptoms OR (sudden onset of fever AND fever))
AND
o (age > 5 years old AND (feeling tired or exhausted OR muscle/joint pain OR headache OR (loss of
smell WITHOUT runny/blocked nose) OR loss of taste)
o OR ((Age ≥ 80 years old OR Age < 18 years old) AND diarrhea)
o OR (Age < 3 months old AND (fever WITHOUT other symptoms))).
Figure 3 reports two independent estimates obtained from COVIDnet.fr cohort data for the incidence of
symptomatic cases in w26. They are computed as follows:
• Estimate #1 = (COVIDnet.fr estimated incidence in w26) * (test positivity rate from SI-DEP in w26)
• Estimate #2 = (COVIDnet.fr estimated incidence in w26) * (estimated proportion screened and confirmed
as COVID-19 suspect case by a physician, and prescribed a test; estimates from COVIDnet.fr) * (test
positivity rate from SI-DEP in w26)
The two estimates were used to validate model projections and identify the specific surveillance mechanisms
needing improvement.
Ethics statement. GrippeNet.fr/COVIDnet.fr was reviewed and approved by the French Advisory Committee
for research on information treatment in the health sector (i.e. CCTIRS, authorization 11.565), and by the
French National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (i.e. CNIL, authorization DR-2012–024) – the
authorities ruling on all matters related to ethics, data, and privacy in the country.
Transmission models summary. We used a stochastic discrete age-stratified transmission model for each
region based on demographic, contact19, and age profile data of French regions18. Models were region-specific
to account for the geographically heterogeneous epidemic situation in the country and given the mobility
restrictions limiting inter-regional movement fluxes. Four age classes were considered: [0-11), [11-19), [19-

65), and 65+ years old, referred to as children, adolescents, adults, seniors. Transmission dynamics follows a
compartmental scheme specific for COVID-19, where individuals were divided into susceptible, exposed,
infectious, and hospitalized (Supplementary Material). We did not consider further progression from
hospitalization (e.g. admission to ICU, recovery, death16) as it was not needed for the objective of the study.
The infectious phase is divided into two steps: a prodromic phase (𝐼& ) and a phase where individuals may
remain either asymptomatic (𝐼' , with probability 𝑝' =40%5) or develop symptoms. In the latter case, we
distinguished between different degrees of severity of symptoms, ranging from paucisymptomatic (𝐼&( ), to
infectious individuals with mild (𝐼)( ) or severe (𝐼(( ) symptoms. Prodromic, asymptomatic and
paucisymptomatic individuals have a reduced transmissibility 𝑟* = 0.55, as estimated in Ref.6, and in
agreement with evidence from the field49,50. A reduced susceptibility was considered for children and
adolescents, along with a reduced relative transmissibility of children, following available evidence from
household studies, contact tracing investigations, and modeling works51–56. A sensitivity analysis was
performed on relative susceptibility and transmissibility of children, and on the proportion of asymptomatic
infections (Supplementary Material). Full details are reported in the Supplementary Material.
Contact matrices. Age-stratified transmission uses a social contact matrix that reports the average contact
rates between different age classes in France19. This refers to the baseline condition, i.e. pre-lockdown. The
contact matrix includes the following layers: contacts at home, school, workplace, transport, leisure activities,
and other activities, and discriminates between physical and non-physical contacts. To account for the change
of contact patterns over time, contact matrices are mechanistically parameterized, by region and over time,
with different data sources informing on the number of students going to school24, the number of workers
going to the workplace14, the compliance to preventive measures15, with a higher compliance registered in
senior individuals15. Information on the progressive reopening of activities indicates that leisure and other
activities were only partially open in the study period. Data, however, are not fine-grained enough to
parameterize our model, so we assume a 50% opening of these activities and explore variations in the
sensitivity analysis. Contacts in these settings are proportionally reduced according to attendance data;
physical contacts are proportionally reduced according to adoption data. The parameterization of matrices is
fully explained in the Supplementary Material.
Inference framework. The parameters of the transmission models to be estimated are specific to each
pandemic phase:
• Prior to lockdown, {𝛽, 𝑡$ } where 𝛽 is the transmission rate per contact and 𝑡$ the date of the start of
the simulation, seeded with 10 infectious individuals.
• During lockdown, {𝛼+, , 𝑡+, } where 𝛼+, is the scaling factor of the transmission rate per contact and
𝑡+, the date when lockdown effects on hospitalization data became visible.
• After lockdown, {𝛼-./0 , 𝜋' (𝑤), 𝜋( (𝑤)} where 𝛼-./0 is the scaling factor of the transmission rate per
contact, 𝜋' (𝑤), 𝜋( (𝑤) are the proportion of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases tested in week w of
the exit phase, respectively. Detected cases in the simulations had their contacts reduced by 90% to
mimic isolation, as done in previous work16,17.
We used simulations of the stochastic model to predict values for all quantities of interest (500 simulations
each time). We fitted the model to the daily count of hospitalisations 𝐻12( (𝑑) on day d throughout the period
and the number of persons testing positive by week of onset, split according to disease status (symptomatic
or asymptomatic), denoted 𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡(,12( (𝑤) and 𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡',12( (𝑤) in week w of the exit phase. We used hospital
admission data up to week 27 (June 29-July 5) to account for the average delay from infection to
hospitalization. Data in week 27 were consolidated by waiting for one additional week to account for updates
and missing data (week 28, July 6-12, 2020).
We assumed a Poisson distribution for hospitalisations and a binomial distribution for the number of people
getting the test, therefore the likelihood function is

We reduced the required computations by making the optimization in 2 steps, first maximizing the likelihood
function in the pre-lockdown and lockdown phase to estimate the first four parameters, and then maximizing
the likelihood in the exit phase by fixing the first four parameters describing the epidemic trajectory prior to
the exit phase to their MLEs. This second step was further simplified through an iterative procedure, and we
showed through simulations that the simplified optimization procedure is consistent and well defined. The
parameter space was explored using NOMAD software57. Fisher’s information matrix was estimated at the
MLE value to obtain the corresponding confidence intervals. Simulations were then parameterized with 500
parameter sets obtained from the joint distribution of transmission parameters at MLE (one stochastic
simulation for each parameter set).
Full details on the different steps and the tests performed are reported in the Supplementary Material.
Model selection analysis. To assess the role of the mechanistic modification of the contact matrix informed
by the different data sources in the exit phase, we compared our model with a simplified version assuming
that contact patterns in the exit phase do not change from pre-epidemic conditions, and that all changes in the
epidemic trajectory are explained exclusively by the transmissibility per contact. This is equivalent to
normalize the contact matrix to its largest eigenvalue and estimate the reproductive ratio over time. We
compared the two models with the Akaike information criterion.
