Abstract
COVID-19, a recently declared pandemic by WHO has taken the world by storm causing
catastrophic damage to human life. The novel cornonavirus disease was first incepted in
the Wuhan city of China on 31st December 2019. The symptoms include fever, cough,
fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Since the
devastating phenomenon is essentially a time-series representation, accurate modeling may
benefit in identifying the root cause and accelerate the diagnosis. In the current analysis,
COVID-19 modeling is done for the Indian subcontinent based on the data collected for the
total cases confirmed, daily recovered, daily deaths, total recovered and total deaths. The
data is treated with total confirmed cases as the target variable and rest as feature variables.
It is observed that Support vector regressions yields accurate results followed by
Polynomial regression. Random forest regression results in overfitting followed by poor
Bayesian regression due to highly correlated feature variables. Further, in order to examine
the effect of neighbouring countries, Pearson correlation matrix is computed to identify
geographic cause and effect.

1. Introduction
On 31 December 2019, in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China cases of unknown virus
were detected. From 31 December 2019 through 10 January 2020, a total of 44 casepatients of unknown etiology were reported to WHO by the national authorities in China.
The authorities in China identified a new type of virus called coronavirus, which was
isolated on 7 January 2020. On 11 and 12 January 2020, WHO received detailed
information from the National Health Commission of China that the outbreak of virus is
originated from the unhygienic wet seafood market in Wuhan City. On 12 January 2020,
China shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus. [1]
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness
of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. [2] While most people have
mild symptoms, some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

possibly precipitated by cytokine storm, [3]multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood
clots. The incubation period may range from one to fourteen days. [4]
The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported on 30
January 2020. India currently has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia, [5]and has
the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States, [6]
[7] with the number of total confirmed cases breaching the 100,000 mark on 19 May, [8]and
1,000,000 confirmed cases on 17 July 2020. On 29 August 2020, India recorded the global
highest single-day spike in COVID-19 cases with 78,761 cases, surpassing the previous
record of 77,368 cases recorded in the US on 17 July 2020. [9] India currently holds the
single day record for largest increase in cases, set on September 17, with an additional
97,894. [10]
The World Health Organization declares Covid-19 a pandemic, which is defined “an
epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, and most people do not have
immunity against it”. At this point, more than 1,21,000 people were infected and over 4,300
died globally. To reduce Corona virus cases, India government introduced 21 days
lockdown on 23 March 2020 with several special rules. The lockdown was extended till 31
May 2020 with several changes in guidelines. The Government of India has proposed
multiple lockdowns to curb the spread of this virus. Due to these lockdowns, there has been
a decrease in the number of cases from 11.8% to 6.3% daily. But the government cannot
shut the entire nation forever as the economy may fall drastically. Due to lockdown the
country is facing job crisis and unemployment. The GDP has also decreased to –23.9%.
The Tourism sector had been highly affected due to lockdown. Also, Textile industry is
highly affected. According to World Trade Organization (WTO) and Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have indicated COVID-19 pandemic as
the largest threat to global economy since the financial emergency of 2008–2009. This
emergency has been the largest emergency till date. So, COVID-19 has undoubtedly put
forth a remarkably adverse effect on the day to day life of the entire human society and on
world economy.
Medical researchers throughout the globe are currently involved to discover an appropriate
vaccine and medications for the disease. On 23 March, the National Task Force for
COVID-19 constituted by the ICMR recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for the
treatment of high-risk cases. Since there is no approved medication till now for killing the
virus so the governments of all countries are focusing on the precautions which can stop
the spread. In India Serum Institute of technology is working on
clinical trial to discover corona vaccine.
Machine learning (ML) has proved itself as a prominent field of study over the last decade
by solving many very complex and sophisticated real-world problems. These prediction
systems can be very helpful in decision making to handle the present scenario to guide early
interventions to manage these diseases very effectively. To contribute to the current human
crisis our attempt in this study is to analyze COVID-19 spread in India. Hence a verified
and proved vaccine of this coronavirus is not found and many researches and scientific
experiments are undergoing and some vaccines are still in trial stage so to utilize the
available resources and to deal with the current ongoing pandemic, modelling the
situation and analyzing the outcome the future can be predicted.

In this study first we studied the growth curve of the current situation. Then different
regression models like Polynomial Regression, Forest Regression, Support Vector
Regression, Naive Bayes, were used to predict the situation till September 7, 2020 and an
optimal model was proposed. This is especially useful for Government and health workers
to analyze current situation and predict the situation up to few weeks. This helps them to
take necessary precautions and actions to curb the spread of disease. We have divided data
set into 4 regions to understand which polynomial curve fits best. We have also compared
our results with neighboring countries like Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh for better
analysis.

2. Methods
In this section, several methods based on machine learning regression and polynomial
regression are discussed. The analysis is carried out for pan India cases where the data is
acquired from [13-14]. The experiments for regression analysis are carried out on Python
platform.

2.1 Polynomial Regression Method
Regression models are statistical sets of processes which are used to estimate or predict
the target or dependent variable based on dependent variables. Regression may be linear
or nonlinear. A model is said to be linear when it is linear in parameters. For example,
the second-order polynomial in one variable
y = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1t + 𝛽2 𝑡 2 + ε

(1)

and the second-order polynomial in two variables
y = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑡1 + 𝛽2 𝑡2 + 𝛽11 𝑡11 + 𝛽22 𝑡22 + 𝛽12 𝑡1 𝑡2 + ε
are also the linear model. In fact, they are the second-order polynomials in one and two
variables, respectively [2].
Polynomial regression is a special type of regression which works on the curvilinear
relationship between the dependent values and independent values. For COVID 19 we
have used polynomial regression with only one variable.
Polynomial with one variable
y = 𝜃0 + 𝜃1 x + 𝜃2 𝑥 2 … + 𝜃𝑛 𝑥 𝑛

(2)

Equation 2 shows the relationship between a dependent and independent variable in
polynomial regression. In Equation (2), x is the independent variable and 𝜃0 is the bias
also the intercept and 𝜃1 , 𝜃2 … . 𝜃𝑛 are the weight or partial coefficients assigned to the
predictors and n is the degree of polynomial.
The polynomial regression used in the study includes transformation of data into
polynomials and applying linear regression to fit the parameter. A polynomial

regression with degree equal to 1 is a linear regression. Choosing the value of a degree
is a challenging task. If the degree of polynomial is less, it will not be able to fit the
model properly and if the value of degree of polynomial is greater than actual, it will
overfit the training data.
The mean squared error (MSE) is an unbiased estimator of the variance σ of the random
error term and is defined in equation
2
MSE = ∑𝑛𝑖=1(𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦̂)
𝑖 /n

(3)

where 𝑦𝑖 are observed values and 𝑦̂are
the fitted values of the dependent variable Y for
𝑖
the ith case. Since the mean squared error is the average squared error, where averaging
is done by dividing by the degrees of freedom, MSE is a measure of how well the
regression fits the data. The square root of MSE is an estimator of the standard deviation
σ of the random error term. The root mean squared error RMSE= √𝑀𝑆𝐸 is not an
unbiased estimator of σ, but it is still a good estimator. MSE and RMSE are measures
of the size of the errors in regression and do not give a indication about the explained
component of the regression fit.

2.2 Random Forest Regression
Random forest is an ensemble method that generates something akin to a forest of trees
from a given training sample. Ensemble-based models are far more accurate than a
single method owing to advantages like capturing linearity and nonlinearity of time
series obtained from individual methods [11].
A random forest begins with splitting the input features into a group of subsets that
essentially form a tree. A particular tree is characterized by a node that leads to a
number of branches, as depicted in Figure. 1

Figure 1: Flowchart of Random forest regression
In random forest regression, the number of trees and the number of random features in each
tree decomposition are the parameters that decide the performance of regression. At each
decision tree, a fitting function is created, which acts on the random features selected. Finally,
at the end of the training process a random forest model is created. It is worth noting that during
the training process, each tree is created from randomly selected input vectors and thus is called
a “random” forest. Mathematically, the estimated output of a random forest regression is given
as
𝐴̂ =

1
𝑘

∑𝑘𝑖=1 𝑟̂ (X,𝑉𝑖 )

(4)

Where 𝑟̂ (𝑋, 𝑉) is the representative tree at the end of training process, X is the set of input
feature vectors, T is the collective set representing an input–output pair 𝑉𝑖 = (𝑥1 ,𝑦1 )
, (𝑥2 ,𝑦2 ) … (𝑥𝑘 ,𝑦𝑘 ) The predicted output is averaged over k decision trees. Decision trees are
sensitive to the data on which they are trained. Changing the training data can change the
predictions.
Meanwhile a common problem of overfitting persists in machine learning regression models
when a well-trained model captures the noise component as well. To reduce the complexities
posed by overfitting, a random forest makes a compromise between flexible and inflexible
models. In the training phase, each regression tree repeatedly draws a sample from the feature
set. This ensures that even though the tree may possess a high variance, the overall variance of
the forest may be low. A random forest works on the principle of bagging, which combines the

predictions from different tree models to give an overall insight to the data under training. This
also helps to reduce the potential overfitting caused by supervised machine learning models.
2.3 Support Vector Regression
The main objective of SVM is to find the optimal hyperplane which linearly separates the data
points in two component by maximizing the margin [12].
Consider a set of data(𝑥1 ,𝑦1 ) , (𝑥2,𝑦2 ) … (𝑥𝑘 ,𝑦𝑘 ) ⊂ X x R, where X denotes the input feature
space of dimension 𝑅 𝑛 . Let Y = (𝑦1 , 𝑦2 … . 𝑦𝑛 ) denote the set representing the training output
or response, where i = 1, 2,..., n and 𝑦𝑖 ∈ R.
This type of SVR uses an ε-insensitive loss function that intuitively accounts for sparsity
similar to SVR by ignoring errors less than ε. ε-SVR aims to find the linear regressor
f (x) = 𝑤 𝑇 + b with w ∈ X, b ∈ R,
For prediction, where x ∈ X is the input set containing all the features, w is the weight
coefficient related to each input xi, and b is the bias term. The objective is to find f (x) with
maximum deviation ε from the respective feature sets while being as flat as possible.
In case of COVID – 19 features sets might not be able to linearly separable. To handle such
nonlinearities in the feature sets, the so called kernel functions are used to transform data to a
higher-dimensional space (“kernel trick”). After transformation via a suitable mapping
function φ : Rn → Z, the data become linearly separable in the target space (high-dimensional
space), that is, Z. The inner product <𝑤 𝑇 ,φ(x)> in the target space can be represented by using
a kernel function. Kernel functions are similarity functions that satisfy Mercer’s theorem such
that k(𝑥𝑖 , 𝑥𝑗 ) = φ(𝑥𝑖 ), φ(𝑥𝑗 ) are the elements of the kernel matrix K. Several kernel functions
are available in the literature like linear, polynomial of degree d, Gaussian, and the radial basis
function (RBF) with bandwidth of the function σ and exponential function
Fig. 4.2 illustrates the kernel trick used when the input vectors are not linearly separable. This
transformation makes the computation of weights and bias vector much easier. Now we look
at the dual form of the optimization problem:
1

min 2 ∑𝑛1,𝑗=1(𝛼 𝑖 − 𝛼𝑖 ∗ )𝑇 k(𝑥𝑖 , 𝑥𝑗 )( 𝛼𝑖 − 𝛼𝑗 ) + 𝑒 𝑇 ε∑𝑛𝑖=1(𝛼𝑖 - 𝛼𝑖∗ )
− ∑𝑛𝑖=1 𝑦𝑖 (𝛼𝑖 − 𝛼𝑗∗ )
s.t. 𝑒 𝑇 ∑𝑛𝑖=1(𝛼𝑖 − 𝛼𝑗∗ ) = 0 0 ≤ α, α∗ ≤ Ce

where α and 𝛼 ∗ represent the positive and negative Lagrange multipliers such that 𝛼𝑖 𝛼 ∗ = 0, i
= 1, 2,..., n. The regressor f (x) can be written as
f(x) = ∑𝑛1,𝑗=1(𝛼 𝑖 − 𝛼𝑖 ∗ ) 𝑘(𝑥, 𝑥𝑖 ) + 𝑏

(6)

The complexity of this regressor is independent of the dimensionality of the feature set and
only depends on the number of support vectors, which are nothing but the data points that
separate the feature sets from each other. However, the performance of the SVR also depends
on the choice of a kernel function and helps in reducing the computation time of the regression.
2.4 Naïve Bayes Regression
Naive Bayes assigns a probability to every possible value in the target range. The resulting
distribution is then condensed into a single prediction. In categorical problems, the optimal
prediction under zero-one loss is the most likely value—the mode of the underlying
distribution. However, in numeric problems the optimal prediction is either the mean or the
median, depending on the loss function. These two statistics are far more sensitive to the
underlying distribution than the most likely value: they almost always change when the
underlying distribution changes, even by a small amount. Therefore, when used for numeric
prediction, naive Bayes is more sensitive to inaccurate probability estimates than when it is
used for classification
Consider the problem of predicting a numeric target value Y , given an example E. E consists
of m attributes X1, X2, . . . , Xm. Each attribute is either numeric, in which case it is treated as
a real number, or nominal, in which case it is a set of unordered values.
If the probability density function p(Y |E) of the target value were known for all possible
examples E, we could choose Y to minimize the expected prediction error. However, p(Y |E)
is usually not known, and has to be estimated from data. Naive Bayes achieves this by applying

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.20212563; this version posted October 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this

Bayes theorem and assuming independence of the attributes X1, X2, . . . , Xm given the target
value Y . Bayes’ theorem states that
p(E,Y )

p(Y |E) = ∫ p(E,Y ) dY =

p(E|Y )p(Y )
∫ p(E|Y )p(Y )

(7)

where the likelihood p(E|Y ) is the probability density function (pdf) of the example E for a
given target value Y , and the prior p(Y ) is the pdf of the target value before any examples
have been seen. Naive Bayes makes the key assumption that the attributes are independent
given the target value, and so Equation 1 can be written
p(X1|Y )p(X2|Y )· · · p(Xm|Y )p(Y )

p(Y |E) = ∫ p(X1|Y )p(X2|Y )· · · p(Xm|Y )p(Y ) dY

(8)

Instead of estimating the pdf p(E|Y ), the individual pdfs p(Xi |Y ) can now be estimated
separately. This dimensionality reduction makes the learning problem much easier. Because
the amount of data needed to obtain an accurate estimate increases with the dimensionality of
the problem, p(Xi |Y ) can be estimated more reliably than p(E|Y ).

3. Result & Discussion
We have analyzed the data from January 30, 2020 to September 7, 2020. Figure 3 and 4
illustrate that new cases of COVID-19, the rate of Total Confirmed Cases and Recovered was
increasing at a slow pace but after April 31, 2020 there was an exponential growth in both Total
Confirmed Cases and Recovered Cases. As number of deaths increases up to 72,232. However
confirmed cases rise increases 4,277,597 while recovered cases rise 3,321,413 till September
7, 2020.Figure 3 showcase statistical analysis of all variables of COVID-19. From Figure 4,
we can see that daily confirmed cases, total confirmed cases, daily recovered, total recovered,
daily death and total death are highly dependent on each other.

Polynomial Regression
We applied polynomial regression to find relationship between total confirmed cases verses
number of days. For linear, cubic, quadratic and quartic accuracy was 65.54%, 94.85%, 99.7%
and 99.9% respectively. As earlier discussed regarding overfitting in polynomial regression
and degree 3 was observed as the best fit polynomial which otherwise would not be observed
with degree 4 due to overfitting.

Here we applied Naive Bayes Regression between total confirmed cases and number of days.
We get accuracy around 15.56%. From Figure 9 we can see that naïve bayes regression failed
to fit the graph and does not show linear relationship.

Random Forest Regression
In Figure 10, we have applied Random Forest Regression between total confirmed cases and
number of days. Random Forest has successfully fit the growth curve with 99.99% accuracy.
But when we predict further value for day 250,275 and 300, we are getting 4221741.4 for all.
Technically as number of days increases total confirmed cases cannot be constant so we can
observe data overfitting. We apply machine learning models to data set for predicting future
values. Random forest failed for future predictions due to overfitting.

Support Vector Regression
In Figure 11, we converted number of days and total confirmed cases in standard scalar form
for performing better support vector regression. By applying Radial basis function (rbf) kernel
we got an accuracy of 99.43%.

Polynomial Regression divided in 4 regions
For better understanding among total confirmed cases and number of days we divided total
number of days in 4 regions. First region ranges from 30 January 2020 to 24 March 2020.
Second region ranges from 25 March 2020 to 18 May 2020. Third region ranges from 19 May
to 12 July. Fourth region ranges from 13 July 2020 to 7 September 2020.
For Figure 12, the regression analysis of each region is illustrated in subsequent figures. First
region consists of 55 samples from 30 January 2020 to 24 March 2020. In beginning cases
increases exponentially of order 5. Accuracy of model is found to be 99.12%. Figure 14
illustrates quadratic curve with an accuracy of 99.37%. In second region, degree of polynomial
decreases from 5 to 2. Now, if we increase value of degree predicted curve will overfit the data.
Further for region 3 and 4 they show quadratic curve with 99.829% and 99.98%.

Correlation between India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan (Subcontinent study)
For all three cases total confirmed, total recovered and total death value Pearson coefficient
values are majorly dependent on each other. The output data frame can be interpreted as for
any cell, row variable correlation with the column variable is the value of the cell. We have
calculated the pairwise correlation of all columns in the data frame.

Figure 17-19 illustrate the Pearson correlation matrix between India and neighbouring
countries. It is observed that for total confirmed cases, a high correlation coefficient is
observed between India and Bangladesh compared to Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Similarly,
the correlation coefficient between India and Neighbouring countries is observed to be high
and indicates a strong geographic influence in COVID-19 transmission.

4. Conclusion
COVID-19 (Coronavirus) has affected day to day life and is slowing down the global
economy. This pandemic has affected thousands of peoples, who are either sick or are being
killed due to the spread of this disease. Regression analysis is a statistical tool for the
investigation of relationships between variables. By applying various regression models
from January 30, 2020 to September 7, 2020 we found that Polynomial Regression and
Support Vector Regression have performed exceptionally well. But in case of Polynomial
Regression, the curve witnessed exponential increase which is not fails to explain the realtime scenario as the total number of confirmed cases will cease in magnitude with improved
medication. Naive Bayes regression failed due to less accuracy and Random Forest ended
up overfitting the data set. In case of Support Vector Regression with radial basis function
kernel, graph decreases after achieving its peak value. So, we can conclude that support
vector regression is best among all methods we applied. In beginning COVID 19 cases
grow at order of 5 from 30 Jan 2020 to 24 March. From March 25, 2020 to May 18, 2020
COVID-19 cases has increases in order of 2 due to imposition of lockdown. Strict rules
were followed during this period. Similar curve has been seen from May 19, 2020 to
September 7, 2020.
As the lockdown has uplifted and the life had come to normalcy and as the Government
has given authority to open multiplex and cinema halls and slowly and steadily soon the
educational institutes will also reopen so, there will be a possibility in sudden spike in the
number of cases. Compared to neighboring countries like Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan
India is worst affected with COVID –19. However, this is due to India’s high population
density, increase in testing, large economy activities there is surge in corona virus cases.
As Sri Lanka is away from India geographically it is comparatively less affected. We also
observe that India and Bangladesh are highly correlated in terms of total confirmed, total
recovered and total death. This study is limited to cases because if any government imposes
special rule or restriction on international flights than scenario might be different. This
study was limited to data-driven models using the total COVID-19 cases. In the future
studies, the other co-factors (associated with the demographics, social, cultural, and
medical infrastructure, etc.) can be taken to considerations.
