Abstract
Peru implemented strict social distancing measures during the early phase of the
epidemic and is now experiencing one of the largest CoVID-19 epidemics in Latin
America. Estimates of disease severity are an essential indicator to inform policy
decisions about the intensity and duration of interventions needed to mitigate the
outbreak. Here we derive delay-adjusted case fatality rates (aCFR) of CoVID-19 in a
middle-income country in South America.
We used government-reported time series of CoVID-19 cases and deaths stratified by
age group and gender.
Our estimates as of May 25, 2020, of the aCFR for men and women are 10.8%
(95%CrI: 10.5-11.1%) and 6.5% (95%CrI: 6.2-6.8%), respectively, and an overall aCFR
of 9.1% (95%CrI: 8.9-9.3%). Our results show that senior individuals are the most
severely affected by CoVID-19, particularly men, with aCFR of almost 60% for those
aged 80- years. We found that men have a significantly higher cumulative morbidity
ratio than women across most age groups (proportion test, p-value< 0.001), with the
exception of those aged 0-9 years.

Introduction
As of May 25, 2020, more than 5.5 million CoVID-19 (illness caused by the novel
coronavirus SARS-COV-2) cases and ~340,000 deaths have been reported from almost
every country and territory around the globe [1, 2].

The CoVID-19 pandemic has

imposed a substantial burden on health systems, economies, and societies globally, and
there are strong indicators pointing to a disproportionate impact on low- and
middle-income countries [3-5]. Since its initial outbreak in China, the world has tracked
the CoVID-19 pandemic proliferating across Europe and Asia, seeding hotspots in
North America, and the Middle East [6]. The pandemic arrived late to South America;
Brazil reported its first case on February 26, 2020 [7]. Neighboring countries contracted
CoVID-19 cases in subsequent days; South America has registered more than 600,000
cases and 30,600 deaths as of May 24, 2020 [1]. Although many South American
countries imposed strict control measures, including travel bans, school closures, and
lockdowns early in the epidemic, the pandemic now rivals Europe in size, with
COVID-19 cases and death counts increasing rapidly [1, 5]. Other factors, including
high poverty rates, informal economies, inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene
infrastructure, frail healthcare systems, and insufficient medical supplies, further

complicate the health and socioeconomic effects of the CoVID-19 pandemic [5, 8-10].
Governments in South America are now facing the social and economic consequences
of SARS-COV-2 containment measures, while struggling to the contain the virus [9].

Peru, a country of about 30 million people, is experiencing one of the largest CoVID-19
epidemics in Latin America. With an approximate two-fold increase in the cumulative
case count during the past two weeks, Peru has reported almost 129,148 cases and 7660
deaths as of May 25, 2020 [11]. The majority (63%) of COVID-19 cases have been
confirmed in Lima, the capital of Peru [11]. The government of Peru initiated social
distancing measures soon after the confirmation of the first imported case in Peru on
March 6, 2020 [12]. The initial epidemic control measures included school closures on
March 11, 2020 followed by the suspension of large gatherings and flights from Europe
and Asia the next day. Subsequently the government declared national emergency in the
country and closed country borders on March 16, 2020 [13]. Despite these forthcoming
and swift control measures, community transmission was reported to be occurring by
March 17, 2020, forcing the implementation of a night time curfew as of March 18,
2020 [13].

Estimates from the early stage of the epidemic in Peru (March 2020) showed sustained
transmission in Lima with an estimated of reproduction number R~2.3 (95% CI: 2.0,
2.5) [14]. Moreover, the 20-days ahead forecast for Lima indicated that the prompt
social distancing measures have significantly slowed down the initial spread of the virus
in the region [14]. The crude case fatality rate (CFR), defined as the number of
cumulative deaths and cases at a single time point, in Peru is estimated at 5.9%,
approximating the global crude CFR average of ~6.3% [15]. Statistical analyses and
mathematical models using data from Peru suggest that under current epidemic growth,
the number of CoVID-19 infected individuals could surpass the healthcare system
capacity [16].

The clinical spectrum of CoVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic cases to clinical
conditions characterized by respiratory failure, to multiorgan and systemic
manifestations which can cause death [17-19]. CFR is a statistical entity used to
estimate severity of the epidemic [20] as it provides a criterion for the public health
officials to gauge the intensity and duration of public health interventions required to
contain the epidemic [21]. However, it becomes challenging to estimate CFR during an
epidemic as CFR estimates are sensitive to right censoring of the data that occurs

because of the time lag between the date of symptoms onset and the date of death for a
case [22-24]. Moreover, under-reporting of cases because mild or asymptomatic cases
can go undetected by disease surveillance systems also underestimates CFR [22, 25].

In this study we provide real-time estimates of adjusted age-specific CFR during the
CoVID-19 epidemic in Peru, through May 25, 2020 to assess the severity of the
SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the region. The country has been performing PCR tests with
the average positivity rate estimated at ~8.6% as of March 30, 2020 [14]. In Peru ~85%
of ICU beds with ventilators are currently occupied by patients [26], therefore our
current estimates are not affected by excess deaths due to health care demand exceeding
health care capacity. However, fears of hospital overcrowding persist [26].

Results
As of May 25, a total of 129,148 cases and 7,660 deaths due to CoVID-19 have been
reported by the Ministry of Health, Peru. Among men, reported cases were mostly

observed among individuals aged 30-39 years (23.1%), followed by those aged 40-49
years (20.8%), and those aged 20-29 years (18.3%). In contrast, most deaths were
reported among those aged 50 years and above, especially among men aged 60-69
(29.3%) followed by those aged 70-79 (23.2%), aged 50-59 years (20.1%), and aged 80
years and above (14.3%). (Table 1, Figure 1A, 1B). Data show a similar pattern for
women. The majority of reported cases occur in females aged 20-69 years, and the
majority of reported deaths occur among women aged 50 years or more. More
specifically, most reported cases occur among women aged 30-39 (22.6%), followed by
women aged 40-49 (19.7%), and 50-59 year olds (16.0%). In contrast, most deaths are
reported among those aged 60-69 (30.2%), followed by women aged 70-79 (25.9%),
and lastly, women aged 80 years and above (18.4%). Regarding CoVID-19 mortality
per 100,000 population, seniors (individuals >70 years of age) were the most affected
age group; mortality burden per 100,000 is 279.2 among men aged 80 years and above,
and 207.6 among men aged 70-79 years. For women of 80 years of age or more
mortality is 108.8 and 85.1 for women aged 70-79 years (Table 1, Figure 1F).

The gender proportions of reported cases by age groups are presented in Figure 1C and
Figure 1D. The proportion of cases among men is higher than 50% across all age groups

(χ2 test, p-value<0.001). Similarly, the proportion of male deaths is also higher than
50% except for those aged 10-19 years (χ2 test, p-value<0.001). Cumulative morbidity
ratio by gender and age group is presented in Figure 1E, indicating that cumulative
morbidity ratio among men is higher than women across all age groups (proportion test,
p-value < 0.001) except for individuals aged 0-9 years (proportion test, p-value =0.85).
Figure 1F illustrates the mortality per 100,000 population directly caused by CoVID-19
by gender and age group. Mortality is higher than among females aged 20 years and
above (proportion test, p-value <0.05), and it is not significantly different among those
aged 0-19 years.

Figure 2 shows the cumulative cases and deaths of CoVID-19 by age group for males
and females (A through J) over time. The figure suggests cumulative deaths increases
after an increase in cumulative cases. The growth curve for overall cumulative cases (all
age groups) for men and women appears to increase exponentially until around day 60
(April 29th, 2020), while exponential growth in cumulative deaths overall (all age
groups) for men and women appears to occur until around day 70 (May 9th, 2020).

Figure 3 illustrates observed and model based posterior estimates of the crude CFR by
age group (A-J) and time-delay adjusted CFR by age group (K-T) for men and women.
Black dots show crude case fatality ratios, and light and dark indicate 95% and 50%
credible intervals (CrI) for posterior estimates, respectively.

Overall, our model based crude CFR fitted the observed data well, except for
individuals aged 80 years and above, probably influenced by low reporting
rate/ascertainment bias of cases at an early stage. Crude CFR for most of age groups
increased at the early stage of the epidemic, peaked amidst the outbreak ~day 34 (April
3rd, 2020) and followed a decreasing trend turning into an almost flat curve.

Overall, our model-based posterior estimates for the time-delay adjusted CFR are
substantially higher than the crude observed CFR. These estimates fluctuated at the
early stage of the epidemic and then followed a decreasing trend.

The most recent estimates, as of May 25, 2020, of the time-delay adjusted CFR for men
and women are 10.8% (95%CrI: 10.5-11.1%) and 6.5% (95%CrI: 6.2-6.8%),
respectively, while overall national estimate is 9.1% (95%CrI: 8.9-9.3%) (Figure 4 and

Table 2). Among men, senior citizens appear to be severely affected; the adjusted CFR
is 33.1% (95%CrI: 31.7-34.6%) for men aged 60-69 years, 49.4% (95%CrI:
47.3-51.6%) for those aged 70-79 years, and 64.3% (95%CrI: 60.9-67.8%) for those 80
years old and above. We observe a similar pattern for women. The adjusted CFR is
19.2% (95%CrI: 17.9-20.6%) for women aged 60-69 years, 32.2% (95%CrI:
29.9-34.7%) for those aged 70-79 years, and 35.1% (95%CrI: 32.1-38.1%) for women
aged 80 years old or more.

Discussion
This study estimates the time-delay adjusted CFR by age group for the ongoing
CoVID-19 epidemic in Peru. The crude CFR varies across countries due to differences
in testing and timing of tests [27]. The results show that the CoVID-19 epidemic in Peru
disproportionately impacts senior individuals, especially those who are 70 years of age
or older, consistent with CFR estimates obtained from recent studies conducted in China
[28, 29], Chile [30], and Italy [31, 32]. This pattern, suggests that an aging population
could aggravate the fatality impact of CoVID-19, similar to influenza and respiratory
syncytial virus [30], as was probably the case in Italy [31, 32]. While the population in

Lain America, including Peru, is aging at a rapid rate, still a relatively small percentage
of the population in the region are older than 65 years of age [33]. So in fact the age
structure in the region could favor a lower overall CFR than would be expected
otherwise with a relatively older population, as in other regions.

Our estimate of adjusted CFR among men (10.8% (95%CrI: 10.5-11.1%)) is 1.7-fold
higher than the estimated adjusted CFR for women (6.5% (95%CrI: 6.2-6.8%)),
consistent with the estimates given in ref [34]. Men aged 80 years or older have an
estimated adjusted CFR as high as 64.3% (95%CrI: 60.9-67.8%), 58-fold higher than
our estimates for men aged 0-9, and 1.3-fold higher than our estimates for men aged
70-79. Similarly, the adjusted CFR estimates for women of aged 80 years or older are as
high as 35.1% (95%CrI: 32.1-38.1%), 29-fold higher than the estimates obtained for
female aged 0-9 and 1.1-fold higher than the estimates obtained for female aged 70-79,
consistent with recent findings in Chile [30]. In comparison, a study conducted in China,
reported much lower estimates of CFR for individuals >80 years of age (13.4%) [29].

An upward trend in the crude CFR for overall population suggests the transmission may
be spreading to more vulnerable populations. The majority of social distancing

measures in Peru were implemented between March 11-March 18, 2020. However,
since 72.4% of the economically active population works in informal jobs, which are
concentrated in the poorest areas of the country, compliance with government
mitigation strategies can be challenging despite the government’s efforts to support the
population [35]. Another factor possibly contributing to the upward trend in crude CFR
may be an increase in unreported cases due to saturated testing capacity [27]. However,
since Peru’s testing capacity has substantially increased since the beginning of the
outbreak, going from >0.01 test per 1000 population to 0.09 per 1000 in May 22 [15],
and the positivity rate is estimated at ~8.6% as of March 30, 2020, this seems an
unlikely cause. Furthermore, the results show an increasing trend in crude CFR around
day 45 (May 14th, 2020), probably reflecting the exponential increase of cumulative
cases around day 40 (May 9th, 2020).

The downward trend in the adjusted CFR at the early stage may indicate the existence
of a reporting delay and the shift of the outbreak to a less vulnerable segment of the
population. In particular, the observed differences in estimates between the crude CFR
and adjusted CFR can be attributed to the time-delay that is assumed fixed during the
course of the epidemic.

The relatively small proportion of males (53.5%) among CoVID-19 cases in the
individuals aged 80 years and above can be attributed to the relatively small male
population size for that age group; with men comprising only 1.7% of the population
>80 years of age in Peru, consistent with estimates for Chile [30]. As higher mortality
among male has been reported in China and the U.S. [34], additional data on deaths
stratified by gender provides the opportunity to examine the CFR by gender and age.

Our study has at least two limitations. First, our estimates are probably overestimated,
due to the effect of under reporting rates and ascertainment rates, as has been
underscored in other studies [22, 24, 36]. But a recently enhanced testing capacity in
Peru is expected to mitigate these effects, and an ongoing mass serological study will
provide data to generate more accurate estimates of the death risk. Second, adjusted
CFR, especially among seniors, has displayed fluctuations, highlighting the importance
of focusing on sub-group analyses. Additional information such as line lists that include
related risks including information on underlying diseases may help to identify
subgroups with elevated risks.

Conclusions
The COVID-19 epidemic is imposing a large death toll in Peru. Senior individuals,
especially those who are older than 70 years of age, are being disproportionately
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly elderly men. CFR was as high as
64.3% (95%CrI: 60.9-67.8%) for men aged 80 older, 58-fold higher than our estimates
for men aged 0-9. The overall adjusted CFR is larger than in other countries, which is
worrying, particularly because healthcare demand has not yet exceeded capacity, but
probably will do in the coming weeks. The relatively younger age structure in Latin
America may help ameliorate the overall CFR than would otherwise be expected with
an older age structure in the population.

Materials and methods
Data
We obtained daily cumulative numbers of reported laboratory confirmed CoVID-19
cases and deaths stratified by age group and gender through May 25, 2020. Different
age groups had different starting times, which correspond to the day when death was
reported. Confirmed CoVID-19 cases were retrieved from three surveillance systems: a)

national surveillance system (confirmed and suspected cases based on a case definition),
b) Netlab system (molecular test) and c) SICOVID system (rapid serological test).
COVID-19 deaths were obtained from two surveillance systems: a) national
surveillance system (confirmed and suspected deaths based on a case definition) and b)
Vital statistics system (National System of mortality -SINADEF- which is an online
system that keeps track of death certificates).
Population size by age, group, and gender in 2020 were retrieved from the Ministry of
Health in Peru [37]

Statistical analysis:
The crude CFR is defined as the number of cumulative deaths over the number of
cumulative cases. For the estimation of CFR in real time, we employed the delay from
hospitalization to death, hs, which is assumed to be given by hs = H(s) – H(s-1) for s>0
where H(s) is a cumulative density function of the delay from hospitalization to death
and follows a gamma distribution with mean 10.1 days and SD 5.4 days, as given in ref,
