Running Head: End point-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.

Abstract. SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is based on RT-qPCR protocols that limited testing to facilities
with Real Time PCR devices and probes supply. Here we described and adapted version of the
RT-qPCR CDC protocol where N1, N2 and N3 primers are used for end point PCR and amplicons
are visualized on agarose gel with

a limit of detection up to 20 viral

RNA copies/uL. This

protocol would allow to extend SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis to basic molecular biology laboratories
with a great impact on surveillance programs at developing countries.

Background.

Since the outbreak of Covid19, the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis is RT-qPCR.
Several in vitro diagnosis RT-qPCR kits are available on the market SARS-CoV-2 detection. Some
of

them

have

received

emergency

use

authorization

(EUA)

from

the

U.S.

Food

&

Drug

Administration (FDA), like 2019-nCoV CDC EUA from the USA Center for Diseases Control and
Prevention (CDC). All RT-qPCR protocols use florescent labelled probes detected on a Real Time
PCR devices. For instance, the CDC assay is based on N1, N2 and N3 probes to detect SARS-CoV2

and

RdRP

as

an

RNA

extraction

quality

control

(1).

These

diagnostic

tools

are

basic

at

molecular biology clinical laboratories on developed countries. However, RT-qPCR is not always
accessible for clinical laboratories at developing countries challenging their SARS-CoV-2 testing
capacity.

Objective.

This study

evaluates

the

performance of

a simple

end point

PCR protocol

for SARS-CoV-2

diagnosis where primers from 2019-nCoV CDC EUA kit (IDT, USA) for viral amplicons N1, N2 and
N3 are used to detect up to 20 copies/uL of SARS-CoV-2 on agarose gel electrophoresis. Also
RnRP amplicon was visualized for RNA extraction quality control purpose.

30sec; and final step 72 C 5min. Amplicons were visualized on 3% agarose gels stained with
ethidium bromide, and the band sizes were 72 bp, 67 bp, 72 bp for N1, N2 and N3, respectively
(Figure 1).

Thirty-six clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs collected on 0.5mL TE pH 8 buffer) from
patients selected as suspicious for SARS-CoV-2 infection were included on this study during the
surveillance in Galapagos Islands started on April 8th 2020. Eighteen of the samples were SARSCoV-2 positive and eighteen were negative, using and adapted version of RT-qPCR CDC protocol
(1) with 2019-nCoV CDC EUA kit (IDT, USA), using CFX96 BioRad instrument and PureLink Viral
RNA/DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, USA) as an alternate RNA extraction method.

Results.

The Ct values and viral loads for the eighteen positive samples are detailed on Table 1, are were
from 13.3 to 239000 viral copies/uL. All the positive samples yielded a band on agarose gels for
N1, N2, N3 and RdRP, while no band other than for RdRP was obtained with negative samples
(Figure 2). The positive sample 972 only yielded a band for N3 (Figure 2) on the first try; but on
a new RNA extraction a PCR, samples for N1, N2 and N3 were observed.

Discussion.

In summary, we herein described an end point PCR protocol using CDC FDA EUA primers for N1,
N2 and N3 viral specific amplicons that allows SARS-CoV-2 detection with 100% specificity and
sensitivity as low as least 20 viral RNA copies/uL. As indicated at CDC RT-qPCR protocol, when
only N1 or N2 probes are positive, sample must be considered inconclusive and new RNA
extraction is recommended (1). Similarly, when only one of the viral amplicons yield a band (like
in sample 972), new extraction would allow a more accurate result.

This end point PCR protocol for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis would be helpful to allow covid 19
surveillance at locations lacking of Real Time PCR devices or without proper funding for probes
purchase, with a potential great impact on developing countries.
