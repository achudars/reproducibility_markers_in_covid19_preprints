Abstract
COVID-19 infection and fatality rates vary considerably between countries. We present
preliminary evidence that these variations may in part reflect ethnic differences in the
frequencies of polymorphic alleles of SERPINA1, coding for alpha-1 antitrypsin, the
major blood serine protease inhibitor.

Introduction
Differences between countries in state-mandated border closures, lockdowns,
and social distancing regulations provide obvious reasons for the great
variation between countries in COVID-19 infection rates and morbidity.
Differences in cultural customs have also been attributed a role. For example,
wearing face masks was common in some Asian countries prior to the current
pandemic, and this may have contributed to lower COVID-19 infection and
fatality rates in these countries [1]. Genetic variations between ethnic groups
have also been proposed as a factor that contributes to differences in COVID-19
epidemiology. The relatively low rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality in
East and Southeast Asian countries, including Japan, China, South Korea,
Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Malaysia, are notable, and remain little
understood [2]. Relatively low COVID-19 infection and mortality rates are also
notable for several Sub-Saharan African countries. While these rates may be
due to lower testing for SARS-CoV-2 and fewer international arrivals, they may
also reflect genetic variations between the populations. However, at the time of
this writing, no studies have reported associations of genetic variations
between populations with COVID-19 infection and fatality rates.
The serine protease TMPRSS2 is well-established as essential for priming SARSCoV-2 cell entry, following binding to its ACE2 cell membrane receptor [3].
Accordingly, the synthetic serine protease inhibitor nafamostat mesylate and
camostat mesylate were shown to inhibit TMPRSS2 [4] and are undergoing
clinical trials in COVID-19 patients. The major human blood serine protease
inhibitor (serpin) is alpha-1 antitrypsin, which is encoded by the SERPINA1 gene
and produced in the liver, similar to many blood proteins. Comparing regions in
Italy, differential alpha-1 antitrypsin genetic deficiency rates were proposed to

correlate with COVID-19 infection. This was based on higher rates of both
alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (carriers of SERPINA1 rs28929474, termed PiZ)
and COVID-19 infection rates in Lombardy, Italy than in central and southern
Italian regions [5]. We therefore examined a possible association between the
distributions of common SERPINA1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
underlying alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and COVID-19 epidemiology on a
global scale.

Methods
National allele frequency estimates for the alpha-1 antitrypsin PiS (SERPINA1
rs17580) and PiZ (SERPINA1 rs28929474) alleles were obtained from Blanco et
al. [6]. National parameters were obtained from the United Nations database
and data.worldbank.org. For combining the effects of the PiS and PiZ alleles on
alpha-1 antitrypsin serum concentration, their frequencies were summed,
weighted by their approximate effect size (50% and 90% respectively,
according to Mitchell et al. [7]). Confounder correction and assessment of
individual factor effect sizes were done using one-way ANCOVA (Analysis of
Covariance). All statistical analyses were made in the R programming
environment. Country-specific epidemiological parameters of the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic were compared between all countries using data from the
Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center [8] (accessed August 23,
2020). We focused on countries with a population of over one million in order
to reduce noise, e.g. from small island nations.

Results and discussion
We examined if population variations in human serine protease inhibitor
(serpin) genes may help explain the lower COVID-19 infection rates and
fatalities in East and Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to other
regions. Among the 43 human serpin genes, SERPINA1, coding for alpha-1
antitrypsin, the major blood serine protease inhibitor, showed the most striking
variations in SNP frequencies between Europeans and non-Europeans. We
examined in particular variations in SERPINA1 rs28929474 (the PiZ allele). This
allele is recognized as the major allele responsible for antitrypsin deficiency in
humans, and was recently suggested to account for the higher COVID-19
infection rates in Lombardy compared with other Italian regions [5]. SERPINA1
rs28929474 was about 8-fold less frequent in East and Southeast Asian than in
South European populations (17 compared to 2 alleles per 1,000 individuals).
For the milder deficiency allele, SERPINA1 rs17580 (PiS allele), the disparity
was even greater (86 compared to 5 alleles per 1,000 individuals, over a 17fold reduction). The combined analysis of the global PiZ and PiS allele
frequencies is shown in Figure 1a.
Our comparison of epidemiological data showed that nearly all the countries
reporting >100 COVID-19 mortalities per million population were in Europe or
the Americas. In contrast, East and Southeast Asian, and also Sub-Saharan
African countries were the predominant countries with low mortality rates per
million population (Figure 1b; Table S1). The COVID-19 population-adjusted
fatality rates for Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia were 0.8, 0.2, and <0.1 per
million, respectively [6]; low COVID-19 fatality rates were also notable for
several Sub-Saharan African nations, such as Congo, and Mozambique ( 2 and
0.7 per million, respectively). Thus, the difference is up to ~100-fold compared

with some European and American countries. The far lower population-adjusted
burden of COVID-19 in many Asian and Sub-Saharan African countries remains
notable when comparing total infections per one million people (Table S1).
It could be argued that the lower COVID-19 infection and fatality rates in many
Asian and Sub-Saharan countries reflect their lower human development index
(HDI), urbanization level, and volume of international travel, as well as lower
proportions of elderly people. However, our analysis indicates that this is not
the case) (the analysis is available by request from the authors). Moreover,
infection and fatality rates remain among the highest globally in several SouthAmerican countries with low HDI and relatively low proportions of elderly
persons. The striking difference in the COVID-19 burden between South
American countries and between East and Southeast Asian countries therefore
seems to be best explained by ethnic genetic variation. Until additional
candidate alleles are found to better explain such national differences, the
population variations in the allele frequencies of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
present a possible genetic explanation for the varying national COVID-19
burden.
We applied estimated country-specific frequencies of alpha-1 antitrypsin
deficiency [6] to analyze COVID-19 fatalities per thousand inhabitants vs.
estimated alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in 67 countries (Fig. 2). The Pearson
correlation of R=0.56 (P=8.7e-7) suggests an association of alpha-1 antitrypsin
deficiency with COVID-19 fatalities. To eliminate the confounding effects of
such factors as urbanization and age distribution, we used a one-way ANCOVA
(Analysis Of Covariance) that accounts for HDI. The results showed a significant
association after correction (P=0.0002; the full analysis is available in the
supplementary methods file). Considering the above, we propose that the low

carrier frequency of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency PiZ and PiS alleles in East
and Southeast Asian and Sub-Saharan African countries may help explain the
lower COVID-19 infection and mortality rates in these regions.
In addition to being the major blood serpin, alpha-1 antitrypsin is known as a
potent anti-inflammatory protein and a key regulator of the human acute phase
immune response. McElvaney et al. [9] recently reported elevated plasma
alpha-1 antitrypsin levels in COVID-19 patients. This suggests the involvement
of alpha-1 antitrypsin in the acute phase immune response to SARS-CoV-2
infection, which might be insufficient for protection against COVID-19.
The bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination was proposed as protective
from severe COVID-19 [10], while it was shown to increase alpha-1 antitrypsin
blood levels in BCG vaccinated individuals together with trained immunity [11].
Notably, a recent study (posted as preprint and not yet published at submission
of this manuscript) demonstrated in vitro inhibition of human TMPRSS2 by alpha-1 antitrypsin, thus suggesting that it might be effective as a COVID-19
treatment [12]. Another recent preprint showed that alpha-1 antitrypsin may
inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection in human airway epithelium at physiological concentrations [13]. A clinical trial of inhaled alpha-1 antitrypsin in COVID19 patients is currently recruiting participants (NCT04385836). If alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency will be established as a key genetic risk factor for severe
COVID-19, population-wide screening for this deficiency will be desirable, for
identification and prioritizing for vaccination, once a vaccine becomes available.
