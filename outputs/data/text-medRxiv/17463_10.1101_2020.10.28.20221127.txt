Abstract

12

Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has spread all over the world and brought extremely huge losses. There is no study to systematically

13

analyse the features of hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (α-HBDH) in COVID-19 patients during the periods before and after illness progression, before death

14

and course from exposure onset.

15

Methods: We collected all included patients’ general information, clinical type, α-HBDH value and outcome, and analyzed α-HBDH values within different

16

initial time and different periods.

17

Results: In the first 30 days after symptom onset, the α-HBDH median value was 156.33 U/L. The first test of α-HBDH since exposure onset appeared on the

18

8th day, it increased from the 8th day to 18th day and decreased after the 18th day. α-HBDH median value showed a slight change until it started to increase 1

19

day before transforming to severe type, while it continued to increase during 4 days before and after transforming to critical type. The α-HBDH median value

20

ranged from 191.11 U/L to 455.11U/L before death.

21

Conclusions: α-HBDH value increases in some COVID-19 patients, obviously in severe type, critical type and death patients, and mainly in 18 days after

22

exposure onset and 10 days after symptom onset. α-HBDH increases 1 day before transforming to severe type, continues to increase in critical type and death

23

patients, increases rapidly 5 days before death. The increase of α-HBDH suggests that COVID-19 patients have tissues and organs damage, mainly in heart. In

24

brief, α-HBDH is an important indicator to judge the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.

1 Introduction

27

COVID-19 has spread around the world since the outbreak in December 2019, which is caused by SARS-Cov-2, and has attracted the

28

attention of the global because of its high transmission ability, morbidity and mortality[1-4]. On January 30, the World Health Organization

29

(WHO) identified COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern[5]. As of August 31, 2020, a cumulative total of nearly 25

30

million cases and 800,000 deaths have been reported [6].

31

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is one of the important enzymes in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. It mainly catalyzes the transformation

32

between lactic acid and pyruvate. Its enzymatic reaction is: pyruvate + NADH+H+ ⇌ lactic acid + NAD+. LDH consists of five isozymes

33

composed of different combinations of H and M subunits: LDH1 (H4), LDH2 (H3M), LDH3 (H2M2), LDH4 (HM3) and LDH5 (M4). α-HBDH

34

is tested by the α-ketoacid, a substrate, to determine the LDH activity. Additionally, the activity of LDH1 and LDH2 with more H subunits is

35

described by α-HBDH activity because of the high affinity for this substrate to the H subunit in LDH. α-HBDH mainly distributes in the heart,

36

brain, kidney and red blood cells, and the activity of the enzyme in the heart is more than half of the total enzyme activity, and it level increases

37

in the progression of cor pulmonale, leukemia and tumor. Moreover, the extent of the increase is closely related to the tissue and organ injury,

38

which can be used as an auxiliary diagnostic index in clinical practice[7-11].

39

Previous studies have shown that α-HBDH is related to COVID-19. Cen Y et al. observed 1007 mild and moderate COVID-19 patients for

40

28 days. It was found that the higher the α-HBDH value, the greater the risk of progression to severe or critical type[12]. Compared with other

41

pneumonia types, the α-HBDH level in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher, and the α-HBDH value of severe group was higher than

42

that of non-severe group[13,14]. When complicated with cardiovascular disease or gastrointestinal symptoms, the α-HBDH in COVID-19 patients

43

was much higher as well[15,16]. However, there are no reports to study the α-HBDH features in COVID-19 patients during the period from

44

symptom onset, from exposure onset, before and after illness progression and before death. In this study, we analyzed the changes of α-HBDH

45

values in COVID-19 patients during these specific period.

46

2 Materials and Methods

47

2.1 Study Design

48

This study was a bidirectional observational cohort study. It was established on Feb 9, 2020, all suspected and confirmed COVID-19

49

patients hospitalized in Xiangyang No.1 People’s Hospital before Feb 28, 2020 were included in this cohort. All information was traced back to

50

Jan 23, 2020. The last day of follow-up was Mar 28, 2020. Admission standard and clinical classifications were made according to the Diagnosis

51

Guidance for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia [17]. The study was approved by the ethics review board of Xiangyang No.1 People's Hospital (No.

52

2020GCP012) and registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry as ChiCTR2000031088. Informed consent from patients has been exempted

53

since this study does not involve patients' personal privacy.

54

2.2 Data Collection

55

The pre-designed extraction form was used to obtain the data from hospital information system, and the two groups (two researchers per

56

group) cross-checked one by one. Gender, age, all α-HBDH test results, exact exposure date (accurate to one day), disease onset date, date of

57

transforming to severe and critical type, outcome, death date, etc. were collected. The data within the course of 30 days after symptom onset and

58

40 days after exposure onset were analyzed. The distributions of α-HBDH median value in course/period were plotted with an interval of 1 day,

59

2 days, and 5 days (T1, T2, T3…Tn represented the 5 days unit successively). In this cohort, symptom onset was regarded as disease onset and

60

the corresponding date was set as the 1st day to record data from symptom onset. For patients with clear exposure date, the exposure date was set

61

as the 1st day to record data when studying the α-HBDH changes from exposure onset. The day when the clinical type changed to severe or

62

critical type was regarded as the “day 0” to study the distribution of α-HBDH before and after the type transformation. The death date was set as

63

“day -1” and selected the -16th day to -1st day as the duration to calculate the α-HBDH median value per two days and plot the distribution

64

when studying the α-HBDH features before death. Two respiratory physicians classified the patients from mild to critical type and then

65

cross-checked, a third expert was involved when there was disagreement.

66

All patients' general information, days from symptom onset to admission to hospital, from symptom onset to transformation to

67

severe/critical type, from severe type to critical type, from symptom onset to death, from symptom onset to discharge, from exposure onset to

68

discharge were included. The α-HBDH median value, abnormal percentage, and distribution of α-HBDH median over time were studied in

69

different course with various initial time, and different periods, including after disease onset, exposure onset, 4 days before and after

70

transformation to severe and critical type, and before death.

71

2.3 Statistical Analysis

72

All statistical analyses were performed through SPSS 20.0. Binary data were described using frequency and percentage. The normality of

73

continuous data was checked. Mean and standard deviation were used to describe variables with normal distribution; otherwise, median

74

(interquartile, IQR) was used. Categorical data were described as frequency (%); the chi-square test was applied to assess significance between

75

groups. All graphs were processed by GraphPad Prism 8.0.

3.1 General Information

78

Up to February 28, 542 patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 have been admitted to our hospital. A total of 142 cases were

79

positive for nucleic acid test, among which the data of 9 cases were incomplete, 2 cases were infants, thus 131 cases were included in this study

80

finally. 121 cases discharged from the hospital while 10 cases died. There were 63 males and 68 females, and the average age was 50.23±17.16

81

years old. The time from exposure to symptom onset was 11.32±8.48 days, symptom onset to hospital admission was 4.55±3.11 days, average

82

hospitalization time was 26.92±9.25 days, symptom onset to severe type was 8.09±4.42 days, symptom onset to critical type was 11.58±5.79

83

days, time from severe to critical type was 3.87±4.78 days, symptom onset to death was 18.40±9.77 days, and symptom onset to discharge from

84

the hospital was 25.77±10.61 days.

85

3.2 α-HBDH Results

86

The 131 cases underwent 37 laboratory indicators tests in outpatient and hospitalization. This study selected 565 tests of α-HBDH,

87

accounting for 2.30% of the all results of the indicators. The normal range of α-HBDH value is 72-182 U/L.

88

3.3 The features of α-HBDH during the course from symptom onset

89

During the first 30 days, there were 506 tests and the α-HBDH median value was 156.33 (125.12-221.59) U/L, and the abnormal percentage

90

was 35.97%. In T1-T6, the abnormal percentage of α-HBDH value was 26.87%, 43.86%, 40.00%, 34.38%, 35.06%, 29.03%, respectively.

91

Among the changes in α-HBDH per day, α-HBDH median value increased from the 1st to the 4th day while decreased during the 15th to the

92

18th day, and fluctuated around upper limits of normal (ULN) from the 4th to the 15th day. And the peak value 191.14 (149.41-223.65) U/L

93

appeared on the 8th day. After the 18th day, α-HBDH median value remained in the normal range, and the outliers on the 21st and the 27th day

94

might related to some severe or critical cases. According to the change trend per 5 days, the α-HBDH median value had an increasing trend from

95

T1 to T2, and a decreasing trend from T2 to T6. The peak 174.69 U/L appeared on T2. The α-HBDH median value was in the normal range

96

during T1-T6.(Table1,Figure1)

97

3.4 The features of α-HBDH in 42 cases during the course from exposure onset

98

We followed up all of the cases and finally defined the 42 cases with a exact exposure date. 42 cases underwent 206 tests , and the α-HBDH

99

median value was 162.59 (131.91-225.31) U/L, the abnormal percentage was 42.72%. The changes of α-HBDH median value indicated the first

100

test of α-HBDH since exposure onset appeared on 8th day, with the corresponding results as 180.28 (171.12-184.39) U/L, and it reached its peak

101

on the 18th day. α-HBDH median value increased from the 8th day to 18th day, decreased from the 18th day to 24th day, and fluctuated within

102

the normal range after the 24th day, the abnormal range was from the 10th day to 22nd day.(Figure2)

103

3.5 The features of α-HBDH during the period before and after transforming to severe and critical type

104

The date of transforming to severe type was set as “day 0” in 19 severe cases and 18 critical cases, and the changes during 4 days before

105

and after “day 0” was plotted. In the 73 α-HBDH test results, the median value was 235.83 (175.37-331.44) U/L, and the abnormal percentage

106

was 72.60%. The tendency showed that it just slight changed during -4th day (161.95 U/L) to -1st day (175.28 U/L) . Among the period,

107

α-HBDH median value was in the abnormal range except on the -1st day and -4th day. Similarly, the change trend during 4 days before and after

108

transforming to critical type from 18 cases was plotted. The chart showed that the α-HBDH median value was increased from -4th day (216.49

109

U/L) to +2nd day (411.03 U/L) . And all results situated in the abnormal range during the -4th day to +4th day.(Figure2)

111

The α-HBDH median value was 332.50 (292.81-474.85) U/L during 1-21 days before death, and the abnormal percentage was 96.23%.

112

α-HBDH median value fluctuated around 320U/L during the -21st to -5th day, nearly presenting a plateau level. However, α-HBDH median

113

value increased sharply during the -5th to the -1st day, and all results were abnormal values from the -21st day to -1st day. (Figure2)

114

4 Discussion

115

According to the α-HBDH median value and the abnormal percentage in each time unit, it showed that abnormal results mainly appeared

116

during T2-T4. The abnormal percentage of α-HBDH value in T2 was the highest, which was 43.36%, and the peak 174.69 (140.49-236.13) U/L

117

also appeared in T2. It indicated that tissues and organs damage mainly occurred in first 10 days. α-HBDH median value showed an upward

118

tendency during T1 to T2, and then gradually decreased, but the results was all in the normal range during T1-T6, which might be the effect of

119

the weak increase of α-HBDH in most mild and moderate patients on the overall data.

120

As shown in the changes per day, the α-HBDH median value increased during the 1st day to 4th day while decreased during the 8th to 12th

121

day and the 15th to 18th day, and it was basically in the normal range after the 16th day. The peak value 191.14 U/L was on the 8th day,

122

abnormal tests were distributed within the 7th to the 9th day and the 13th to the 15th day, the outliers of the 21st day and the 27th day might be

123

related to some severe and critical patients. The α-HBDH median value closed to the ULN on the 4th day since disease course, while the average

124

time from symptom onset to admitted was 4.55±3.11 days, indicating that α-HBDH might have increased 1-2 days before admission. So there

125

might be potential value for diagnosis in the early stage.

126

The time of symptom onset was clear and always regarded as the start of the disease, while the tissue might suffered damage before

127

symptom onset because of the infected virus. Symptom occurs just when the viral load and damage reached a certain extent, thus the total course

128

should be recorded starting from the day of exposure. After carefully follow-up, it was confirmed that the exposure time of 42 patients in our

129

study could be accurate to a day, and the time from exposure to symptom onset was 11.32±8.48 days. In order to further study the changes of

130

α-HBDH in the whole course including asymptomatic stage, we took the exposure onset as the first day, and performed a time change chart

131

during 40 days after exposure onset. The first test of α-HBDH since exposure onset appeared on the day 8, with the results close to the ULN,

132

indicating that the virus had caused tissue and organ damage before the symptoms onset. On the 18th day, α-HBDH median value reached the

133

peak, indicating that tissue and organ damage accumulated to the maximum degree, and resulting in the highest level of α-HBDH. After the 24th

134

day, α-HBDH median value gradually decreased to the normal range, which might be related to the protective effect of antibody.

135

Due to the differences in the length of incubation period and the progression of disease course, and there was also difference in the time for

136

patients to transform from moderate type to severe type and critical type. In order to reflect the changes of α-HBDH during the transformation

137

from moderate type to severe type and critical type more accurately, we observed and analyzed the changes of α-HBDH during 4 days before

138

and after the transformation. According to the fact that the time for 18 critical patients change from severe to critical type was 3.87±4.78 days,

139

we collected the results tested 4 days before and after the transformation date for statistical analysis. In the severe group, the α-HBDH median

140

value fluctuated at the ULN from the -4th day to -1st day, and there was no obvious change. Moreover, α -HBDH median value rapidly

141

increased and exceeded the ULN from the -1st day to the 4th day, indicating that the tissue and organ injury might be further aggravated after

142

transforming to severe type. Similarly, α-HBDH median value increased from the -4th day to the 2nd day but decreased gradually after the 2nd

143

day in the critical cases, and all results exceeded the ULN within the period, indicating a more serious injury of tissue and organ in this type.

144

The time from symptom onset to death was 18.30±9.65 days, which was relatively dispersed. Thus, it was difficult to describe the features

9

145

of α-HBDH before death. In order to study the feature of change in this stage, we performed a time change chart of α-HBDH with the death date

146

as "day -1". The results showed that the α-HBDH median value fluctuated around 320 U/L during the -21st to -5th day, and there was no obvious

147

change. α-HBDH median value increased rapidly 5 days before death, which indicated there was a persistent and irreversible tissue and organ

148

injury before death, Furthermore, aggravated of injury happened within 5 days before death, and α-HBDH value over 320 U/L suggest a high

149

risk of death.

150

α-HBDH distributes in many tissues and organs, mainly in the heart. In clinical work, we usually regard α-HBDH as a kind of myocardial

151

enzyme. The increase of α-HBDH in severe type, critical type and death patients in this cohort indicates there might have the serious tissue and

152

organ damage in these patients, and the higher the α-HBDH, the more serious the illness, and the worse the outcome.

153

However, this study has several limitations. All the patients in the study come from the single hospital, and the sample size is small. And we

154

may fail to detect the daily α-HBDH value in patients and lose some information.

155

5 Conclusion

156

α-HBDH value increases in some COVID-19 patients, obviously in severe type, critical type and death patients, and mainly in 18 days after

157

exposure onset and 10 days after symptom onset. α-HBDH increases 1 day before transforming to severe type, continues to increase in critical

158

type and death patients, increases rapidly 5 days before death. The increase of α-HBDH suggests that COVID-19 patients have tissues and

159

organs damage, mainly in heart. In brief, α-HBDH is an important indicator to judge the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
