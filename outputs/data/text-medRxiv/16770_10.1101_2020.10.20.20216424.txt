Abstract
We investigated how emotional responses (positive and negative affect), physical activity (PA),
and sedentary behaviors related to anxiety among US children during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sixty-four typically-developing children (63% girls) age 9-15 years old completed two virtual
visits during height of “stay-at-home” measures between April 22 – July 29, 2020. Children
completed 24-hour PA recalls, state portion of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children
(STAIC), and the shortened 10-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children
(PANAS-C). Children reported state anxiety scores that were more than 5 standard deviations
greater than values from healthy pediatric populations prior to the pandemic. Children with
higher positive affect and who reported more time in PA reported less state anxiety. Sedentary
and leisure screen time were positively correlated with negative affect. Our findings suggest that
maintaining positive affect, engaging in PA, and limiting leisure screen time may be important
for child mental health during stressful periods.
Key words: COVID-19, Affect, State Anxiety, Physical Activity, Leisure Screen Time, US
children.
Statement of Relevance
There is increasing concern regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the
psychological and physical health of children. To date, studies on mental health during the
pandemic in children are limited. We investigated links between activity levels and
psychological outcomes in children during the height of the “stay-at-home” measures. We found
that children had anxiety scores that were more than 5 standard deviations greater than normative
values from healthy pediatric populations prior to the pandemic, and 94% of children exceeded
the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations on leisure screen time. Positive affect
and physical activity were associated with reduced anxiety levels in children during the
pandemic. These findings highlight the important mental health benefits of maintaining positive
affect, engaging in physical activity, and limiting leisure screen time for children, especially
during stressful periods.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a national public health

136

emergency in the United States in March 2020. In order to prevent the spread of the virus, US

137

state and local governments implemented unprecedented “stay-at-home” orders starting in mid-

138

March, 2020, including closures of primary and secondary schools across the nation

139

(https://plus.google.com/+UNESCO, 2020). Consequently, children’s access to social support

140

resources and opportunities for physical activity may have been limited during home

141

confinement.

142

In addition to the high COVID-19 death toll, which surpassed 200,000 in the U.S. by the

143

end of September 2020 (“Mortality Analyses”), there is increasing concern regarding the

144

potential collateral damage to physical and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over

145

one-third of American adults reported that the pandemic is having a serious impact on their

146

mental health (“New Poll: COVID-19 Impacting Mental Well-Being: Americans Feeling

147

Anxious, Especially for Loved Ones; Older Adults Are Less Anxious,”), and a recent study

148

among US adults demonstrated that the prevalence of symptoms of psychological distress were

149

significantly higher during the pandemic compared to two years earlier (McGinty,

150

Presskreischer, Han, & Barry, 2020). While little is known about the impact of the pandemic on

151

the mental health of US children, school-aged children in China reported experiencing

152

depressive symptoms during their nationwide lockdown (Xie et al., 2020). Furthermore, other

153

recent studies in China, Italy, and the United States have also shown that children are engaging

154

in less physical activity and increased sedentary behavior and screen time during the pandemic

155

(Dunton, Do, & Wang, 2020; Pietrobelli et al., 2020; M. Xiang, Zhang, & Kuwahara, 2020).

156

Notably, poor mental health outcomes have been identified as independent risk factors for

157

several chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiometabolic disease (Golden et al.,

158

2008; Rudisch & Nemeroff, 2003); additionally, low physical activity levels, heightened screen

159

time, and increased sedentary behavior are also associated with these conditions (Byun, Dowda,

160

& Pate, 2012; Shrestha & Copenhaver, 2015). Given that health behavior trajectories in

161

childhood are likely to endure through adulthood (see review by Shrestha and Copenhaver

162

(2015)), these findings raise alarming public health implications.

163

Correspondingly, studies conducted prior to the pandemic demonstrated a clear link

164

between psychological well-being and lifestyle behaviors. Prior studies have shown that positive

165

affect, defined as the tendency of an individual to experience positive emotions, such as

166

enthusiasm and joy (Positive Emotion, 2014), is associated with increased engagement in

167

exercise (Pasco et al., 2011; Peterson et al., 2012). Positive affect is negatively correlated with

168

symptoms and diagnoses of anxiety and depression (Peterson et al., 2012; Watson, Clark, &

169

Carey, 1988), and multiple reports have established that physical activity reduces symptoms of

170

anxiety among children (Kiluk, Weden, & Culotta, 2009; Parfitt & Eston, 2005). Conversely,

171

studies have shown that during childhood and adolescence, both sedentary behavior and screen

172

time are associated with increased risk for depressive symptoms and negative affect, which refers

173

to the tendency to experience more intense negative emotions (García-Hermoso, Hormazábal-

174

Aguayo, Fernández-Vergara, Olivares, & Oriol-Granado, 2020; Sund, Larsson, & Wichstrøm,

175

2011).

176

While COVID-19 restrictions may impact both the psychological and physical health of

177

children, to our knowledge, no study to date has examined how children’s positive and negative

178

affect, physical activity and sedentary behaviors relate to their anxiety levels. The aim of the

179

current study was to assess children’s positive and negative affect and activity levels during the

181

activity and sedentary behaviors in children.

182
183

Methods

184

Participants

185

Participants in this study were recruited from the existing BrainChild study, an observational

186

study that includes healthy, typically developing children who were recruited at ages 7 to 11

187

years old during years 2014-2018 for entry into the study and followed with annual visits. The

188

studies reported here were completed between one and four years after initial entry into the

189

study. Children in the BrainChild cohort were born at a Kaiser Permanente Southern California

190

(KPSC) Hospital and had no history of psychiatric, neurological, or other significant medical

191

disorders.

192

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, participants were unable to complete in-person consents

193

to participate in this sub-study. Therefore, an amendment to the original Institutional Review

194

Board (IRB) protocol was sent to the IRBs at the University of Southern California (#HS-15-

195

00540) and KPSC (#10282) for virtual follow-up visits. Both USC and KPSC IRBs approved

196

this sub-study if participants had a recent in-person follow-up visit that occurred within a year.

197

During the prior in-person follow-up visit, participants’ parents gave written informed consent,

198

and children provided written informed assent to participate in longitudinal studies. Additionally,

199

participants gave verbal informed consent prior to participating in the phone or video interviews.

200

Of the 162 participants enrolled in the larger BrainChild Study, 82 participants had recent 1-year

201

follow-up visits and, therefore, were eligible to participate in this ancillary study. During in-

202

person visits that had occurred within one year of the virtual visits, height (cm) to the nearest 0.1

203

cm was collected using a stadiometer and weight (kg) was collected using a calibrated digital

204

scale. BMI was calculated using the standard formula, weight (kg) divided by height (m2). BMI

205

z-scores and BMI percentiles (age and sex-specific standard deviation scores) were determined

206

based on Center for Disease Control (CDC) standards (About Child & Teen BMI | Healthy

207

Weight | CDC, 2018).

208
209

Exposure

210

All of the children were residents of California, which was under a statewide “stay-at-home”

211

lockdown starting March 19, 2020. Data collection took place during Phase 1/Phase 2 of the

212

order from April 22th-July 29th, 2020, wherein all schools were closed for in-person instruction

213

from April 22 – May 29, 2020.

214
215

Phone Visit

216

Trained staff members contacted participants’ parents from the existing BrainChild cohort. The

217

study included two phone or video call visits with both the participant and a parent present. Each

218

visit occurred on average 34 days apart ranging from 27 to 73 days, interquartile range 30 – 35

219

days. Visit one occurred from April 22nd to June 26th, 2020. Visit two occurred from May 22nd to

220

July 29th, 2020. All questionnaires were read aloud to each participant by the trained staff

221

member, and then the participant gave their answers verbally.

222
223

Physical Activity Assessment

224

At each phone call visit, physical activity was assessed using a 24-h physical activity recall

225

(PAR) (Ainsworth et al., 2011; Weston, Petosa, & Pate, 1997). A trained staff member asked

226

participants, with a parent present to offer input, to recall all of their activities from 7:00am to

227

12:00am in 30-minute blocks for the day prior. The activities were recorded and classified based

228

on a 73-item reference list. The participant was also asked to rate the intensity of each activity as

229

either “Light” (slow breathing, little/no movement), “Moderate” (normal breathing and some

230

movement), “Hard” (increased breathing and moderate movement), or “Very Hard” (hard

231

breathing and quick movement). Each activity was then categorized as either sedentary,

232

moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), or vigorous physical activity (VPA), with their

233

associated metabolic equivalent (MET) values obtained from the Compendium of Physical

234

Activities (Ainsworth et al., 2011). Activities with MET values >1 and 1.5 were classified as

235

sedentary, METs 3 as MVPA, and METs 6 as VPA. Sleep blocks were classified as

236

METs=1.0. Examples of physical activity classifications include: walking (MVPA) or swimming

237

laps (VPA). Examples of sedentary activities include, reading a book, sitting in class and as well

238

as any sedentary screen time activities. In addition, leisure screen time (MET=1.5 per 30-minute

239

block) was obtained by adding time spent in the following leisure activities: watching TV or

240

movies, playing video games, and surfing the internet while sedentary.

241
242

State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children

243

At each phone call visit, state anxiety was assessed via the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for

244

Children (STAIC). Only items for the state-anxiety (S-Anxiety) scale were completed, given that

245

the research question was concerned with how children were acutely responding to the

246

pandemic, and by design, S-Anxiety scores are influenced by the child’s immediate environment

247

(Spielberger & Edwards, 1973). The STAIC S-Anxiety scale is composed of 20 statements, and

248

children are instructed to base their answers on how they feel at that particular moment. Each

249

STAIC S-Anxiety item is a 3-point rating scale with a stem of “I feel”; half of the items are

250

reflective of the presence of anxiety (i.e. nervous, worried), while the other half are indicative of

251

the absence of anxiety (i.e. calm, pleasant) (Spielberger & Edwards, 1973). Values of 1, 2, or 3

252

are assigned for each of the three answer choices, and scores range from 20-60, with higher

253

scores representing higher state anxiety.

254
255

Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children

256

At each phone call visit, both positive and negative affect were assessed using the Positive and

257

Negative Affect Schedule for Children (PANAS-C). The current study utilized the shortened 10-

258

item PANAS-C, which includes a 5-item positive affect scale (joyful, cheerful, happy, lively,

259

proud) and a 5-item negative affect scale (miserable, mad, afraid, scared, sad), with a 5-point

260

Likert scale ranging from 1 (“very slightly or not at all) to 5 (“extremely”) (Ebesutani et al.,

261

2012). The participants were instructed to answer each item reflecting to what extent they have

262

felt this way during the past few weeks in order to capture a wider temporal range of affect

263

during the pandemic. Scores range from 5-25 for each affect subscale, with higher scores

264

representing higher affect.

265
266

Statistical Analysis

267

To minimize data reporting errors, measures taken from each of the two visits were averaged and

268

used for all analyses. Descriptive statistics including meanSD, median (IQR), ranges and

269

frequencies were reported. Correlations and linear regression models were used to test

270

associations between emotional regulatory processes (positive affect and negative affect),

271

physical activity (MVPA and VPA) and sedentary behaviors (leisure screen time, sedentary

272

time) with state anxiety. We assessed whether emotional regulatory processes and physical

273

activity were independently associated with state anxiety by including both in the same model.

274

Covariates included in each linear regression model were child age, sex, socioeconomic status

275

(SES) and BMI z-score because these are factors known to influence mental health and physical

276

activity levels (Belcher et al., 2010; Fakhouri, Hughes, Brody, Kit, & Ogden, 2013; Mason et al.,

277

2019; Nader, Bradley, Houts, McRitchie, & O’Brien, 2008; Topçu, Orhon, Tayfun, Uçaktürk, &

278

Demirel, 2016; Zhu et al., 2019). SES was assessed using household income at birth, estimated

279

based on census tract of residence and expressed as a continuous variable, and maternal

280

education at birth, extracted from birth certificates in the electronic medical record as a

281

categorical variable with the following categories: “high-school or some high-school”, “some

282

college” and “college and post-education” (A. H. Xiang et al., 2015). Time spent in MVPA and

283

VPA were not normally distributed, and a square-root transformation was applied to normalize

284

the distribution prior to regression analyses. P-values <0.05 were interpreted as statistically

285

significant. SAS 9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC USA) was used for all data

286

analyses.

288

Results

289

Of the 82 participants from the BrainChild study who had completed at least one

290

longitudinal follow-up visit, 65 participants completed one phone-call or video visits during the

291

state mandated “stay-at-home” order, and 64 of these participants completed a second phone-call

292

or video visit approximately one month later. Child age ranged from 9 to 15 years and the mean

293

SD age was 11.84 ± 1.28 years, 63% of participants were female, and 53% were of a healthy-

294

weight defined as a BMI percentile less than 85. Children’s mean SD positive affect scores

were 16.16  4.10, negative affect scores were 8.27  3.15, and STAIC S-Anxiety scores were

296

47.37  3.15 (Table 1). Mean SD scores for other healthy pediatric samples of a similar age

297

range are as follows: positive affect (17.34  3.07) (Bauer et al., 2019; Zink et al., 2020),

298

negative affect (7.20  2.44) (Bauer et al., 2019; Zink et al., 2020), state anxiety (29.78  1.17)

299

(Mestre et al., 2019; Spielberger & Edwards, 1973; Zink et al., 2020). Thus, compared to healthy

300

pediatric studies conducted prior to the pandemic, state anxiety in our cohort was five standard

301

deviations greater. Mean SD BMI z-score was 0.87  1.15, the mean sedentary time was

677.81

303

(IQR) MVPA was 45 (67.5) (min/day), and median VPA was 0 (15) (min/day). Forty-seven

304

children (73%) did not engage in any VPA. Additionally, 94% (60/64) of children reported more

305

than 2 hours of leisure screen time per a day, exceeding the American Academy of Pediatrics

306

recommended 2 hour limit for screen time (Fakhouri et al., 2013). The mean sedentary time

307

reported by the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for similarly aged

308

children was 498.20 ± 162.20 (min/day), screen time was 264.80 ± 152.90 (min/day), MVPA

309

was 40.40 ± 26.50 (min/day) and VPA was 7.60 ± 10.02 (min/day) (Belcher et al., 2010; Hunt et

positive affect was associated with lower state anxiety in unadjusted models (correlation

313

coefficient r=-0.50, p<0.001; regression β=-0.38, 95% CI: -0.55,-0.22, p<0.001) and after

314

adjusting for child age, sex, SES, and BMI z-score (β=-0.40, 95% CI: -0.57, -0.22, p<0.001).

315

However, negative affect was not associated with state anxiety in unadjusted models (r=-0.03,

316

p=0.78; β=-0.04, 95% CI: -0.31, 0.23, p=0.79) or in models adjusted for child age, sex, SES and

318

For the relationship between physical activity and anxiety measures (Table 3), MVPA

319

was associated with less state anxiety in both the unadjusted model (r=-0.34, p=0.007; β=-0.27,

320

95% CI: -0.47, -0.08, p=0.007), and after adjusting for child age, sex, SES and BMI z-score (β=-

321

0.27, 95% CI: -0.47,-0.06, p=0.01). VPA was not associated with lower state anxiety in either the

322

unadjusted (r=-0.08, p=0.52; β=-0.11, 95% CI: -0.46, 0.23, p=0.52) or adjusted models (β=-0.07,

323

95% CI: -0.42, 0.29, p=0.72). Sedentary time was also not associated with state anxiety before

324

(r=0.06, p=0.63; β=0.002, 95% CI: -0.01, 0.01, p=0.63) and after adjusting for covariates

325

(β=0.003, 95% CI: -0.004, 0.01, p=0.44) (Table 3). Leisure screen time was not associated with

326

state anxiety in the unadjusted (r=0.10, p=0.42; β=0.002, 95% CI: -0.003, 0.01, p=0.42) and

327

adjusted models (β=0.003, 95% CI: -0.002, 0.01, p=0.24) (Table 3).

328

Analyses assessing the independent associations between affect score and physical

329

activity with state anxiety showed that both remained associated with state anxiety when

330

adjusting for each other. Positive affect remained associated with lower state anxiety after

331

adjusting for MVPA (β changed from -0.40 to -0.36, 95% CI: -0.54, -0.18, p<0.001, Table 2).

332

MVPA also remained associated with lower state anxiety after further adjusting for positive

333

affect (β changed from -0.27 to -0.20, 95% CI: -0.38, -0.01, p=0.04, Table 3).

334

When examining relationships between emotional regulatory responses (i.e., positive and

335

negative affect) and physical activity measures, we found that negative affect was correlated with

336

sedentary time (r=0.28, p=0.02) and leisure screen time (r=0.40, p=0.001) (Table 4). After

337

adjusting for child age, sex, SES and BMI z-score, negative affect remained correlated with

338

leisure screen time (r=0.40, p=0.002) and sedentary time (r=0.28, p=0.03) (Table 5). Positive

339

affect was not related to any of the physical activity measures (Tables 5 and 6).

Discussion

342

We provide the first results from the United States that examined how emotional

343

regulatory responses, measured from positive and negative affect scores, related to anxiety levels

344

and physical activity levels of children during the pandemic. In California, the “stay-at-home”

345

orders began in late March and were lifted at the end of May. During this time, we collected

346

questionnaires on affect, state anxiety, physical activity and sedentary behaviors during the peak

347

of the “stay-at-home” order to infer not only how anxiety levels were impacted, but also the role

348

of positive and negative affect and physical activity levels on anxiety levels in children. We

349

found that state anxiety levels of children in our cohort during the “stay-at-home” order were

350

more than five standard deviations greater than the mean reported by other healthy pediatric

351

populations prior to the pandemic (Mestre et al., 2019; Spielberger & Edwards, 1973; Zink et al.,

352

2020). Additionally, children reported greater screen and sedentary time than similarly aged

353

children from the NHANES (Belcher et al., 2010; Hunt et al., 2019). Interestingly, we found that

354

positive affect, negative affect and child physical activity levels in our cohort were similar to

355

those reported by other pediatric studies conducted prior to the pandemic (Bauer et al., 2019;

356

Belcher et al., 2010; Hunt et al., 2019; Zink et al., 2020).

357

Prior studies in countries first struck by the pandemic noted an increase in symptoms of

358

depression and anxiety in both children and adults (Cao et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2020; Zhang,

359

Wang, Rauch, & Wei, 2020). However, none of these studies have investigated relationships

360

between affect and mental health during the pandemic. Our study showed that positive affect was

361

related to lower state anxiety levels in children, independent of age, sex, socioeconomic status,

362

physical activity, and BMI. These findings are in keeping with larger cross-sectional studies

363

suggesting that positive affect is protective against anxiety during stressful times (O’Hara,

13

364

Armeli, Boynton, & Tennen, 2014; Sewart et al., 2019). Therefore, promoting methods to

365

maintain positive affect, such as educational interventions that encourage practicing gratitude

366

(Froh et al., 2014) and mindfulness (Kang et al., 2018), may be beneficial to children during

367

times of heightened stress, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, future studies are needed

368

to test this possibility.

369

While anxiety levels have been documented to be increased in adult populations during

370

the pandemic (Cao et al., 2020; McGinty et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020), the impact of COVID-

371

19 restrictions on child mental health is sparse (Xie et al., 2020). Similar to the one study

372

published in children during the COVID-19 lockdown in China (Xie et al., 2020), we found that

373

children during the “stay-at-home” order reported greater state anxiety compared to other

374

pediatric samples prior to the pandemic (Mestre et al., 2019; Spielberger & Edwards, 1973; Zink

375

et al., 2020). In addition to higher anxiety symptoms, Xie et al. found that school-aged children

376

in China reported higher depression symptoms (Xie et al., 2020). The authors hypothesized that a

377

reduction in outdoor activities and social interactions may have contributed to increased

378

depression and anxiety symptoms. Correspondingly, several studies have found that engaging in

379

physical activity is beneficial for mental health (Crews, Lochbaum, & Landers, 2004; Parfitt &

380

Eston, 2005; Parfitt, Pavey, & Rowlands, 2009). Interestingly, we found that children who

381

engaged in more physical activity had less reported state anxiety, independent of age, sex,

382

socioeconomic status, positive affect, and BMI. Taken together, these findings support a critical

383

role for physical activity in promoting the health and well-being of children. Engagement in

384

physical activity may be particularly important for children to help reduce anxiety during

385

stressful periods.

386

Similar to other studies in children during the “stay-at-home” order, we found an increase

387

in both sedentary and leisure screen time compared to nationally representative pediatric samples

388

before the “stay-at-home” order (Dunton et al., 2020; Fakhouri et al., 2013; Pietrobelli et al.,

389

2020; M. Xiang et al., 2020). Prior to the pandemic, the American Academy of Pediatrics

390

recommended that children engage in less than 2 hours a day of leisure screen time (Fakhouri et

391

al., 2013). However, children in our cohort reported an average of 6 hours a day of leisure screen

392

time. Additionally, children reported spending 11 hours a day being sedentary and in leisure

393

screen time. Importantly, prior studies in youth have shown that excessive screen and sedentary

394

time is associated with increased depressive symptoms and negative affect (García-Hermoso et

395

al., 2020; Sund et al., 2011). Correspondingly, we found that increased leisure screen time was

396

associated with negative affect in children, independent of age, sex, socioeconomic status, and

397

BMI. Similarly, more time spent sedentary was also associated with negative affect. While our

398

study design does not allow us to determine the directionality of the relationship between leisure

399

screen time and negative affect, our findings are in concert with previous large cross-sectional

400

studies demonstrating a dose-dependent relationship between screen-based activities and

401

depressive symptomatology such as negative affect in children (García-Hermoso et al., 2020;

402

Yang, Helgason, Sigfusdottir, & Kristjansson, 2013). Therefore, future studies should consider

403

investigating if limiting excessive leisure screen time could reduce the risk for negative affect

404

among children.

405

Our study was able to collect repeated measures of affect, anxiety and behavioral health

406

questionnaires in children over two months during the peak of the “stay-at-home” orders, but we

407

did not have baseline measures of affect or anxiety in this cohort prior to the pandemic to

408

compare to the measures collected during the pandemic. While we did compare affect, anxiety,

409

and activity levels in our cohort to other healthy pediatric populations prior to the pandemic, it is

410

worth noting that the normative comparisons that we used for anxiety were either limited in

411

sample size (Mestre et al., 2019; Zink et al., 2020) or not recent (Spielberger & Edwards, 1973).

412

However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no recent and large sample size normative

413

STAIC state-anxiety comparisons available in US children and/or adolescents. Moreover, we

414

assessed a limited number of behavioral factors that predicted levels of anxiety among children

415

during COVID-19 restrictions. Future pandemic-related studies should consider assessing other

416

potential environmental and psychosocial risk and protective factors for anxiety in children, such

417

as sleep (Alfano, Ginsburg, & Kingery, 2007) and social support (Sandler, Miller, Short, &

418

Wolchik, 1989). Additionally, we used a self-reported physical activity recall which is subject to

419

participant bias. However, self-report recalls provided pertinent information about specific

420

physical activities engaged in during the “stay-at-home” order. Finally, our small sample size

421

may limit the generalizability of our findings.

422
423
424

Conclusions
Overall, this study found that children reported heightened anxiety during the COVID-19

425

“stay-at-home” orders when compared to normative values from pediatric populations prior to

426

the pandemic. Importantly, we found that children who reported greater positive affect reported

427

lower anxiety symptoms. We also found that children who engaged in more physical activity

428

reported lower anxiety symptoms and this relationship was independent of positive affect.

429

Additionally, negative affect was positively correlated with both sedentary time and leisure

430

screen time. These study findings highlight the important mental health benefits of maintaining
