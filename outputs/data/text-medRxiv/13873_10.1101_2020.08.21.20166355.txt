Abstract
Background
Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), a novel inflammatory marker, has been suggested to be able
to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate the
association between PLR levels on admission and the severity of COVID-19 patients.

Methods
A systematic literature search was done on 23 July 2020 to identify peer-reviewed studies
across four different databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane
Library), preprints from two databases (MedRxiv and SSRN), and grey literature from two
databases (WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database and Center for Disease Control and
Prevention COVID-19 Research Article). Research articles comparing the PLR value on
admission in adult patients with COVID-19 with varying degrees of severity were included in the
analysis. The following keywords were used for the search: “COVID-19”, “PLR”, “severity”, and
“mortality”. The inverse variance method was used to calculate the pooled effect standardized
mean difference (SMD) along with its 95% confidence interval (CI).

Results
A total of seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, six of which were conducted in
China. From a total of 998 participants included, 316 (31.7%) had severe diseases; and those in
the severe group were generally older and had underlying diseases compared to the nonsevere group. In comparison to non-severe patients, the meta-analysis showed that severe
COVID-19 patients had higher PLR levels on admission (SMD 0.68; 95%CI 0.43-0.93; I2 =58%).

Introduction
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus thought to start as a zoonotic infection in
Wuhan in late December 2019 (1). The disease was declared by the World Health Organization
(WHO) as a pandemic on 11 March 2020 and has infected more than 100 countries worldwide.
As of 26 July 2020, a total number of 15 785 641 cases and 640 016 deaths attributed to
COVID-19 were recorded, only months after its emergence (2).
COVID-19 is known for being infectious and simultaneously manifesting in different organs
aside from the pulmonary system (3-5). Patients infected with COVID-19 present a wide range
of clinical conditions – ranging from asymptomatic infection, minimal symptoms to fatal
respiratory distress. Although the majority of COVID-19 cases were classified as mild, involving
flu-like symptoms to mild pneumonia, up to 20% of mild/moderate cases progressed to acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (6). Additionally, patients with rather normal clinical
conditions can rapidly deteriorate and worsen within the course of a few days, making clinical
presentation an unreliable prognostic predictor of COVID-19. Thus, a more objective indicator is
required to accurately assess and stratify the prognosis of COVID-19 patients upon admission
to healthcare services.
Immunological studies have shown that high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, known as
cytokine storm, are the hallmark characteristic of severe COVID-19 cases. This extreme
elevation of cytokines causes a massive proinflammatory response resulting in Multiple Organ
Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) and ARDS, which subsequently leads to mortality in COVID-19
patients (7). Therefore, in theory, inflammatory markers can be used to assess the severity and
mortality risk of COVID-19 patients.

Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is a novel marker of inflammation, which is inexpensive and
readily available in clinical settings. PLR has been used in various diseases, such as
cardiovascular diseases and autoimmune diseases, as a predictor of inflammation and mortality
(8, 9). Due to the rapid involvement of inflammatory processes in COVID-19, severe COVID-19
patients have demonstrated elevated PLR levels on admission (10, 11). This suggests the
potential of this inflammatory marker to determine the prognosis of COVID-19 patients,
especially in resource-limited settings. Therefore, this systematic review aims to review the
prognostic value of PLR levels on admission to determine the severity and mortality of COVID19 patients.

Methods
Protocol and Registration
This systematic review was written in compliance to the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Checklist (Table S1). Prior to the writing of
this systematic review, a protocol was formulated and registered in the International Prospective
Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on 2 June 2020 (CRD42020189369).
Eligibility Criteria
We included cohort studies evaluating the difference in PLR levels on admission in adults (>18
years old) with confirmed COVID-19 (diagnosed using RT-PCR) categorized based on disease
severity (severe and non-severe patients), and/or mortality (survivor and non-survivor). Case
series, correspondences, review articles, non-research articles, and letters to editor were
excluded from the study. We only included papers written and published in English. Otherwise,
no other exclusion criteria were applied. The severity of the disease was defined by the WHOChina Joint Mission on COVID-19 report (12). Severe COVID-19 was defined as patients that
met any of the following criteria: respiratory frequency ≥30x/minute, blood oxygen saturation

≤93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field within 24-48 hours.
Search Strategy
The keywords used in the search strategy were derived from the following key concepts
“COVID-19”, “platelet-to-lymphocyte”, “severity”, and “mortality”; and were adapted to the
respective databases (Table S2). A systematic literature search was finalized on 23 July 2020
to identify peer-reviewed papers published in four databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE,
SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library). Additionally, manual handsearching was done for
preprints in two databases (MedRxiv and SSRN), and for grey literatures in two databases
(WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database and Center for Disease Control and Prevention

COVID-19 Research Article). We also performed forward and backward tracing of references
from relevant articles to identify additional papers missed from database searching.
Study Selection
All articles retrieved from the searches were exported to EndNote X9 reference manager. After
de-duplication of articles, publications were screened based on its titles and abstracts, and the
remaining publications were screened according to the full text. This study selection process
was carried out by two independent reviewers (DMS and BAW). Any disagreement regarding
the study selection was resolved by the inclusion of a third party.
Quality Assessment and Data Extraction
All included articles’ data were extracted by two independent reviewers (DMS and BAW). Risk
of bias assessment was done using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). A standardized data
extraction form was used to gather relevant data from the selected articles. Data extracted
included: first author and publication year, publication type, country of study, study design,
baseline characteristics of patients (age, gender, and underlying diseases), and the outcome of
the study (PLR values).
Statistical Analysis
For the quantitative analysis, we exported quantitative data from all eligible studies to Review
Manager software 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration) and performed a meta-analysis. We
extrapolated the mean and standard deviation of studies with non-normal data using the
available median and interquartile range (IQR) according to Hozo et al. (13). The inverse
variance method was used to obtain the effect estimate in the form of standardized mean
difference (SMD) and the 95% confidence Interval (CI). The statistical heterogeneity between
the studies was assessed using Cochrane chi-square and I2. If there was significant
heterogeneity (I2>50%), the random-effect model was used to calculate the pooled effect size,

otherwise the fixed-effect model was used. Funnel plot analysis was used to qualitatively
evaluate the risk of publication bias by comparing the SMD with the standard error of the natural
log of SMD. We performed sensitivity analysis by omitting one study at a time to identify the
source of heterogeneity. All p-values were two-tailed and statistical significance was considered
if p<0.05.

Results
Search Selection and Study Characteristics
The literature search from electronic databases resulted in 27 publications, four of which were
identified through manual handsearching of relevant literatures (Figure 1; Figure S2). Following
de-duplication, 17 articles were screened for its titles and abstracts. The remaining 10 articles
were reviewed for its full-text and three articles were excluded, leaving a total of seven peerreviewed articles included in this systematic review.
From a total of seven selected studies, all were peer-reviewed and were retrospective
observational studies. In overall, six studies were done in China (10, 11, 14-17) and only one
was done outside of China, in Turkey (18). All studies compared the on-admission PLR values
between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients, except for one that compared the PLR
values between severe and moderate COVID-19 patients (17). Unfortunately, no study explored
the prognostic value of PLR on admission to predict mortality. The quality of the included
studies is shown in Table S3. Four studies had seven NOS stars and the other three had six
NOS stars, in brief, all studies were of acceptable quality and eligible for inclusion in the metaanalysis.
Baseline Characteristics and Study Findings
A total of 998 participants were included from all the studies, 316 (31.7%) of which had a severe
disease. Although four studies did not report the baseline comorbidity characteristics of COVID19 patients, in comparison to non-severe COVID-19 patients, those with severe diseases were
generally significantly older, and more likely to have underlying diseases such as hypertension,
diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Of all the studies, only Qu et al. reported higher PLR
values on admission in non-severe patients compared to severe patients (non-severe: 242.75 ±

173.74 vs severe: 160.02 ± 51.99; p=0.414) while the remainder demonstrated higher onadmission PLR values in severe compared to non-severe COVID-19 patients.
Two studies performed a receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis to determine the most optimal
cut-off level for PLR. Yang et al. reported the optimal cut-off level for PLR was 180 [Area under
the ROC Curve (AUC) 0.784 (95%CI 0.666-0.901); sensitivity 77%; specificity 44%] (11) while
Sun et al. reported the optimal cut-off level was 226.67 [AUC 0.746 (95%CI 0.637-0.854);
sensitivity 59.26% (95%CI 38.8%-77.6%); specificity 80.90% (95%CI 71.2%-88.5%)] (16).
Platelet-to-lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and Severity of COVID-19
A pooled effect size meta-analysis was conducted using the random-effect model (n=998;
severe = 316, non-severe = 682) (Figure 2). In overall, patients with severe COVID-19 had a
higher PLR value on admission compared to non-severe COVID-19 (SMD 0.68; 95%CI 0.430.93). There was a significant heterogeneity among the studies (I2=58%, p=0.03). The funnel
plot was visually asymmetrical and indicated a potential risk of publication bias (Figure S1).
Sensitivity analysis by sequentially removing one study at a time did not significantly change the
heterogeneity among the studies and the overall pooled effect size. However, the exclusion of
the study by Yang et al. resulted in no significant heterogeneity between the studies (I2=0%,
p=0.52) (Figure S2). The pooled effect size meta-analysis using the fixed-effect model showed
a significantly higher PLR value on admission in severe COVID-19 patients compared to nonsevere COVID-19 patients (SMD 0.57; 95%CI 0.41-0.72).

Discussion
As of 26 July 2020, COVID-19 has infected approximately 15 million people worldwide, 600
thousand of whom died (2). More concerning, those with severe COVID-19 rapidly deteriorate to
critical cases, which involve multiorgan failure, leading to death (19). Thus, there is an urgent
need for healthcare providers to develop readily available biological markers to predict the
severity and mortality of COVID-19 at the early stage of the disease to provide the most optimal
management.
PLR has been initially suggested as a great candidate marker for determining the severity and
mortality of COVID-19. First, PLR is an established marker of inflammation (20). Inflammation
plays a considerable role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, with cytokine storm as a
hallmark condition in severe disease and poorer prognosis (21). Thus, elevated PLR value
suggests an overactive inflammatory response and subsequently worse prognosis. Second,
PLR is sensitive to natural and acquired immune response (22). Third, PLR is an inexpensive
and readily available measurement that can be used in resource-limited settings. Therefore, our
systematic review aims to review the validity of PLR level on admission as a prognostic indicator
in COVID-19 patients.
Our meta-analysis, which included a total of 998 COVID-19 patients, showed that high PLR
value was associated with severe COVID-19. Six out of the seven included studies
demonstrated similar results with increased PLR on admission found in severe cases of COVID19 compared to those with mild or moderate disease. This suggests that elevated PLR on
admission among severe COVID-19 patients reflects a higher degree of cytokine storm. This
evidence can be useful for the provision of specialized treatment to patients with severe COVID19 as they might require longer hospital admissions.

Although PLR on admission was generally shown to be increased in severe vs non-severe
COVID-19, Qu et al. reported a reduced PLR on admission in severe compared to non-severe
COVID-19 despite no statistical significance. Inconsistencies between the results of different
studies could be problematic, especially for daily clinical application. However, we noted the
rather small sample size of the study, only three severe cases of COVID-19 were included in the
analysis compared to 27 non-severe cases, which could lead to this contradictory result (10).
Furthermore, follow-up analysis of PLR in the study showed elevated levels upon
hospitalization.
To date, there is no universal laboratory reference value for PLR, especially for COVID-19
patients. Of all the included studies, only two studies attempted to determine the optimal cut-off
PLR value. Yang et al. reported the optimal cut-off PLR value as 180 with AUC of 0.784,
specificity of 44%, and sensitivity of 77% (11). Meanwhile, Sun et al. suggested a cut-off PLR
value of 226.67 with AUC of 0.746, specificity of 80.90% and sensitivity of 59.26% (16). This
discrepancy warrants the need for further research to determine the most appropriate PLR cutoff value in determining the severity of COVID-19 patients.
As PLR involves a comparison between the absolute platelet and absolute lymphocyte count, a
comprehensive understanding about the role of platelets and lymphocytes in COVID-19 is
important. Platelet is a marker for inflammation in various diseases (8, 9). The platelet level in
severe COVID-19 varies between studies. From the seven studies, six studies showed low
platelet count in severe compared to non-severe group, two of which were significantly different
statistically. Three hypotheses may explain the underlying decrease in platelet count. First, the
cytokine storm triggered by SARS-CoV-2 can decrease the synthesis of platelets, by destroying
bone marrow progenitor cells. SARS-CoV-2 is also postulated to directly affect the production of
platelets in the bone marrow. Second, SARS-CoV-2 can induce the generation of autoantibody
and immune complex which may trigger the destruction of platelets. Third, platelets activated

during lung injury could be aggregated and be overactively involved in microthrombus formation
(23). However, there is still a lack of current evidence for platelet cut-off level in COVID-19.
Moreover, from the six studies showing increased PLR levels on admission in severe cases, the
absolute lymphocyte count was also decreased. Another study also reported lymphopenia
among severe COVID-19 (24). The underlying mechanism for this decreased absolute
lymphocyte count is that SARS-CoV-2 triggers pyroptosis in lymphocytes through the activation
of NLRP 3 inflammasome (23). Another hypothesis points out the role of the pro-inflammatory
cytokine IL-6 that uses the lymphocytes, thus decreased lymphocyte counts are associated with
poor prognosis. This evidence of lymphopenia has been reported from the meta-analysis by
Huang et al., which showed lymphocyte count less than or equal to 1100 cells/µL was
associated with threefold risk of poor outcome in severe COVID-19 cases (25).
We also observed a significant heterogeneity among the included studies in this meta-analysis.
The possible reasons for the high heterogeneity could be due to the distinct interstudy baseline
characteristics of the subjects, different number and proportion of patients with comorbidities as
well as the proportion of severe and non-severe cases. Fesih, Qu, and Sun excluded patients
with other comorbidities, such as chronic lung diseases, hematological diseases, and liver
diseases (10, 16, 18) while Gong did not provide any data on the comorbidities of the patients
(14). Another reason could be due to the small number of included studies in this meta-analysis,
which could reduce the accuracy of the heterogeneity analysis (26). We performed sensitivity
analysis by sequentially omitting one study at a time and determined that Yang et al. was the
source of heterogeneity (11). However, with the removal of Yang et al., pooled analysis still
showed a statistically significant higher PLR value on admission in severe COVID-19 in
comparison to non-severe COVID-19 patients.
This meta-analysis is not without limitations. We acknowledge that only including articles written
and published in English would disregard those written in other languages, and thus present

with geographical bias. Moreover, most of the included studies were from China, whereas the
majority of confirmed cases and deaths were located in the USA and Europe. The variability in
PLR values between different populations could limit the relevance of this finding. Based on the
funnel plot, we also identified a potential risk of publication bias. In addition, the limited data
presented by the included studies did not allow further stratification of the severe group into
severe and critically ill patients. Therefore, further research still needs to be conducted to
determine an optimal cut-off value for PLR value for the prediction of severity in COVID-19.

Conclusion
Our meta-analysis showed that PLR can be used as a novel, cost-effective, and readily
available biomarker in determining the severity of COVID-19 patients. The implication of our
finding is that elevated PLR levels on admission can be utilized as a prognostic indicator of
severity in COVID-19 patients, especially in resource-limited settings, where there is an urgent
need to effectively allocate medical resources and divert attention to patients with poorer
prognosis. However, further studies are needed to determine the cutoff value of PLR with the
most optimal sensitivity and specificity prior to adaptation in clinical practice.
