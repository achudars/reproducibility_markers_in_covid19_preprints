Abstract
The dynamics of immunity are crucial to understanding the long-term patterns of the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic. Several cases of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 have been documented 48–142 days after the
initial infection and immunity to seasonal circulating coronaviruses is estimated to be shorter than one
year. Using an age-structured, deterministic model, we explore potential immunity dynamics using contact
data from the UK population. In the scenario where immunity to SARS-CoV-2 lasts an average of three
months for non-hospitalised individuals, a year for hospitalised individuals, and the effective reproduction
number after lockdown ends is 1.2 (our worst case scenario), we find that the secondary peak occurs in
winter 2020 with a daily maximum of 387,000 infectious individuals and 125,000 daily new cases; three-fold
greater than in a scenario with permanent immunity. Our models suggests that longitudinal serological
surveys to determine if immunity in the population is waning will be most informative when sampling takes
place from the end of the lockdown in June until autumn 2020. After this period, the proportion of the
population with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is expected to increase due to the secondary wave. Overall, our
analysis presents considerations for policy makers on the longer term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK
and suggests that strategies designed to achieve herd immunity may lead to repeated waves of infection as
immunity to reinfection is not permanent.

Introduction

Public health context

11

As of the 1st of July 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected at least 10 million people worldwide and resulted in
over 500,000 deaths [1, 2]. Following the initial outbreak from a live animal market in Wuhan, China [3], the
United Kingdom (UK) has been among the countries most severely affected; reporting over 310,000 cases and
44,000 deaths, which is among the highest per-capita rates [2, 4]. Since the 23rd of March, nationwide nonpharmaceutical interventions (lockdown) have been in place to reduce social contacts by closing schools and
shops; encouraging home working; and social distancing in public places. Similar measures have been in place in
other European countries since late February 2020 with restrictions easing in France, Germany and Italy from
May 2020. Within the European picture of disease control strategies, Sweden has been an outlier by placing
fewer restrictions on social mixing while aiming to build up immunity in the population [5].

Following infection with the virus, hospitalised patients have an acute immune response where virus-specific

likely to become seronegative following convalescence [10]. Antibody titres raised against related coronaviruses
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to decay over time [11, 12]. Furthermore, immunity to seasonal
circulating coronaviruses has been estimated to last for less than one year [13] and recovered individuals from
coronavirus NL63 can become reinfected [14]. Concerns that immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may also wane therefore
motivated the present study [15].

Epidemiological modelling

Dynamic epidemiological models play a major role in shaping the timing and intensity of interventions against
SARS-CoV-2 in the UK and elsewhere [16]. Many models or simulations have assumed that infected individuals
recover with permanent immunity [16, 17, 18]. In such models the epidemic reaches extinction after running
out of infected individuals, although they do not preclude a second wave of infections after lockdown [19]. If
immunity wanes over a period of time, or recovered individuals have only partial immunity to reinfection, this
substantially alters the dynamics of the system [20]. In the absence of stochastic extinction and demography
(births and deaths) in a population with equal mixing where; R0 is the basic reproduction number; γ is
the average duration of infection; and ω is the reciprocal of the average duration of immunity; the endemic
equilibrium proportion of infected in the population I ∗ , is given by (R0 − 1) ω/γR0 and thus, in the absence of
interventions, the infection persists indefinitely when R0 > 1 [21].
In dynamic models which make the assumption of homogeneous mixing, the ‘classic’ threshold at which the
proportion of the population with immunity prevents invasion by a pathogen is given by 1 − 1/R0 [21]. As R0
for SARS-CoV-2 is generally estimated between 2.4–5.6 [22, 23, 24], this equates to 58–82% of the population
requiring immunity to eventually halt the epidemic. Serological studies conducted in affected countries to-date
have reported the proportion of the population with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 to be much lower than this
figure [22, 25]. However, when more realistic non-homogeneous mixing is considered, the observed immunity
threshold is lower than the classical threshold [26]. Recent studies have considered this question for SARS-CoV2 [27, 28], with Britton et al. noting that the disease-induced population immunity threshold could be closer
to 40% in an age-structured population when R0 is 2.5, rather than the 60% ‘classic’ population immunity
threshold [28]. This phenomenon is driven by individuals that have more contacts, or greater susceptibility to
the virus, getting infected earlier on and leaving the susceptible population; thus decelerating the growth of the
epidemic.

Kissler et al. considered the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States with seasonal forcing, homogeneous
mixing and waning immunity that could be boosted by exposure to seasonal circulating betacoronaviruses [29].
Under these assumptions, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was predicted to rebound in winter months. Here we do
not consider seasonality, but rather the dynamics of transmission in an age-structured population with different
periods of waning immunity in the context of the UK emerging from lockdown.
We developed a discrete time gamma delay-distributed (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-susceptible;
SEIRS) model, which incorporates current knowledge about the natural history of the virus and the UK population. Our model accounts for symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, and heterogeneity in both daily
contacts and infection susceptibility by age group. We consider different durations of immunity for hospitalised
patients (or those with more severe symptoms) compared to non-hospitalised patients (those with less severe
symptoms). We use this model to explore a range of scenarios in the UK population in the context of stringent
non-pharmaceutical interventions (lockdown) followed by more limited interventions over a two year period from
March 2020, and the impact of immunity duration on the longer term disease equilibrium.

After this analysis was presented to policymakers (see Accompanying Letter), the first case of reinfection
with SARS-CoV-2 was reported in a 33 year old male in Hong Kong in August 2020; 142 days after the initial
diagnosis [30]. Following the first infection in March, the patient was discharged from hospital after two negative
PCR results. Genomic sequencing confirmed that the viruses in March and August were from distinct clades.
Reinfections have since been reported in single cases in the USA [31], Ecuador [32] and Belgium [33] at 48, 63
and 93 days respectively from the first reported infections. Two asymptomatic reinfections were also reported
in Indian healthcare workers 108 and 111 days from the initial infection [34]. The case of reinfection in the
USA, in a 25 year old male from Nevada, was notable for the second infection causing more severe symptoms
than the first, and led to the patient requiring supplemental oxygen and hospitalisation. While these reported
cases confirm the biological plausibility of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2, the data are too sparse to infer an
expected duration of immunity at the population level.

We use current knowledge of the natural history of the virus to construct a plausible epidemiological model
(Figure 1). We extend a previously published deterministic compartmental model which has provided general
insights into the dynamics of the epidemic at a regional level for a range of scenarios [18]. The general framework
of the model is given in Figure 1 and parameter values are shown in Table 1. The disease states for each age
group are susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infectious (I S ), asymptomatic infectious (I A ), hospitalised
recovered (RH ), and non-hospitalised recovered (RN ). Each state gives the number of individuals in the
compartment at a given time t, with the sum over all the states at time t equal to the size of the UK population
in 2018 (66.4 million).

hospitalisation (or have severe symptoms) following infection. All model parameters are given in Table 1 and
state transitions are shown in Equations 1 to 6.

Distributed natural history of infection

93

The mean latent and infectious periods for SARS-CoV-2 have been estimated as 4.5 days and 3.1 days respectively, using viral load data and the timing of known index and secondary case contacts (Figure 2) [35]. The
probability mass of the latent and infectious period distributions are centred around the mean, therefore we
consider that gamma distributions with an integer shape parameter, also known as Erlang distributions, give
more realistic waiting times than exponential distributions which have a mode of zero [36, 37, 38]. We decided
to use a discrete time implementation (difference equations), as this permits greater flexibility in implementing
interventions compared to differential equations. Using difference equations results in a discretised approximation of the Erlang distribution compared with continuous time models, with the output converging as the time
step approaches zero [39, 40]. We used a time step of 0.01 days to ensure that the infection dynamics closely
approximate a continuous time model.

Estimates of the transmissibility of the virus in the UK at the beginning of the epidemic have ranged from
2.4–5.6 [23, 41, 42], therefore we assume that R0 at the beginning of the epidemic in the UK population is 4.0
[23]. Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been shown to bring the effective reproduction number (Rt ) below
one, and in some settings have led to local elimination of the virus [22, 23].

Testing performed in closed populations suggests that 40-50% of SARS-CoV-2 infections may be asymptomatic [43, 44, 45], while data from contact tracing shows transmission can occur from asymptomatic individuals [46]. We make the assumption that asymptomatic individuals (I A ) have 0.5 the infectiousness of
symptomatic individuals (I S ) [6, 16].
The UK population shows variable contact rates by age [47, 48] and, while studies show mixed results,
evidence is accruing that children have a lower susceptibility to acquiring the infection than adults [49, 50, 51].
We assume that children (≤15 years) have 0.4 times the susceptibility of adults [52].

We allow the duration of immunity to differ for recovered individuals with severe symptoms that are hospitalised
(RH ) versus those with less severe symptoms that are not hospitalised (RN ), as there is evidence from SARSCoV-2 and other coronaviruses that individuals with milder symptoms may have a lower antibody response
[53]. Among the reported cases of reinfections, all individuals showed at most ‘mild’ symptoms during the first
infection [54], supporting the notion that infections which cause more severe symptoms could generate longer
lasting immunity.

The function notation ft (X; k, µ) represents the output of the discretised Erlang delay distribution from
states E, I S , I A , RH and RN . Our model code contains k sub-compartments for each Erlang distributed
disease state, with a rate k/µ between sub-compartments, and an overall waiting time of µ. The function
notation is used in equations 1–6 for shorthand convenience instead of writing out k difference equations for
each disease state. While we do not calculate probability distributions within the model, as a simplified example;
if n individuals enter state X at a single time point t, by time t + τ there will be remaining n(1 − g(τ, k, µ));
where g(τ, k, µ) gives the cumulative Erlang distribution with shape parameter k and mean duration µ [39].

where ηi is the relative susceptibility of age group i; υ the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic cases; and
ci,j is the average number of daily contacts between a single individual in age group j and all individuals in age
group i [48] (Table 1). The basic reproduction number (R0 ) is given by the spectral radius ρ(K) which is the
largest absolute eigenvalue of K. As we specify the value of R0 , the transmission parameter β is left as a free
parameter which is scaled to the correct value. The force of infection acting on a single individual in age group

Immunological scenarios
Using data and timing of events from the UK epidemic, we explore four scenarios with varying average durations
of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2).
S1. Permanent: Where immunity is lifelong for both hospitalised (RH ) and non-hospitalised (RN ) cases.
S2. Waning (12 months): Where immunity is lifelong for hospitalised cases and has an average duration of
365 days for non-hospitalised cases.
S3. Waning (6 months): Where immunity is lifelong for hospitalised cases and has an average duration of
180 days for non-hospitalised cases.
S4. Short-lived: Where immunity lasts, on average, 365 days for hospitalised cases and 90 days for nonhospitalised cases.
UK-specific parameterisation
All scenarios are initialised with 2968 infected individuals in early March 2020 [59], which is when the majority
of importation events into the UK are likely to have occurred [59]. Intervention measures are initiated on
the 23rd of March (date the UK nationwide lockdown started), with an immediate reduction in the effective
reproduction number (expected number of secondary cases from an index case at time t; Rt ) to 1.2 for a three
week period, followed by a further reduction in Rt to 0.8 until lockdown measures are eased on 15th June [58].
After this time, Rt is brought to 0.9, 1, 1.1 or 1.2 until March 2022. We considered the majority of our analysis
over a, relatively short, two year period to explore the epidemic up to a secondary peak; beyond this point
the dynamics are likely to be altered depending on further interventions or changes to Rt . As we simulate
disease dynamics over a relatively short period of time, we do not consider demography (births and deaths) or
transitions between age classes (ageing). To obtain equilibrium values, we simulated epidemic trajectories for
up to five years.

The UK contact matrix (average daily contacts between a single individual in age group j with individuals
in age group i) comes from a ‘citizen science’ project for the BBC, in which individuals in the UK population
provided detailed information on their daily contacts in the home, in the workplace, at school and in other
settings [47, 48]. The contact matrix is altered to account for changes to contact patterns during and after the
main intervention period [56]. During the lockdown, home; work; school; and other contacts are reduced to 0.8,
0.3, 0.1 and 0.2 respectively of their baseline values. This reflects the school closures for all children, except
for those of key workers, and that workers were encouraged to work from home. Reduction in home contacts
accounts for the absence of visitors to the home during the lockdown. In the post-lockdown phase, home; work;
school; and other contacts are scaled to 1, 0.8, 0.85 and 0.75, respectively, of their baseline values to reflect
limited social distancing measures that are likely to be in place until at least the end of 2021.
Analysis was performed in R version 4.0.2. We present figures from model output in the text to the nearest
thousand. Code to reproduce the analysis with user-specified parameters is available at https://github.com/

Heterogeneity in transmission

180

The epidemic is driven by the rate of infectious contacts between individuals in different age groups. This is
described by the next generation matrix in which the average number of secondary cases generated by an index
case in age group j is the summation of row j (Equation 8 & Figure 3). At the beginning of the epidemic, when
SARS-CoV-2 is spreading rapidly, all age groups are involved in transmission; in particular those aged 20–39
years. An index case in the 20–24 age group, for instance, is expected to generate an average of 4.3 secondary
cases at baseline. As lockdown measures come into force this dramatically reduces the expected number of
secondary cases due to fewer contacts and a lower probability of infection given contact. The average number
of secondary cases from an individual aged 20–24 during lockdown drops to 0.9 and the transmission parameter
β, which captures the probability of infection given contact, is decreased from 0.18 at baseline to 0.11. In the
post-lockdown period daily contacts are increased to a higher proportion of their baseline values (see Methods);
in order to keep the reproduction number equal to the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix, β is
consequently reduced to 0.05 when Rt =0.9 and to 0.07 when Rt =1.2. This implies that, to maintain Rt below
one when more contacts are occurring in the population post-lockdown, the probability that contact results in
infection will need to be reduced.

rate at which recovered individuals lose immunity and become susceptible again, and the post-lockdown Rt .
Given our model and parameters, on the first day the intervention is imposed (23rd March 2020) there are
108,000 new SARS-CoV-2 cases, which is within the 95% credible interval (CrI) of new cases estimated for
the UK on that day (95% CrI 54,000–155,000 [60]), and 75,000 people are infectious (infected compartments
I A + I S ) on this date. From the 3rd of March until the 23rd of March there are 559,000 cumulative cases
across all age groups and 524,000 in adults ≥19 years, which is within the credible interval for an estimate of
cumulative cases in this period (95% CrI 266,000–628,000 [60]). When most of the lockdown measures were
eased in June, 5.7% of the total population and 6.8% of adults aged ≥19 years have immunity to SARS-CoV-2
(in recovered classes RH and RN ), which is comparable to estimates of antibody levels in the UK population,
estimated as 6.8% of blood donors on 24th May 2020 (95% confidence interval 5.2–8.6%; individuals ≥18 years
[25]).

A secondary peak in infections is expected in spring 2021 where Rt = 1.1 or winter 2020 where Rt = 1.2
(Figure 4, panels E & G). The height of the secondary peak is determined by the rate at which immunity is
lost. In our worst case scenario (S4: short-lived immunity) where immunity lasts an average of three months for
non-hospitalised patients, a year for hospitalised patients and Rt following lockdown is 1.2, then the secondary
peak will exceed the initial peak with a maximum of 387,000 infectious individuals and 125,000 daily new cases
in December 2020. This is three-fold greater than the number of new cases in scenario S1 where immunity

is permanent; the maximum number of infectious individuals in the secondary peak is 126,000 and there are
41,000 daily new cases (Figure 4G). We note that the timing of the secondary peak in infection curves across
immunological scenarios are closely synchronised and in winter 2020–21. This synchrony and timing is also
observed during the epidemic when values of Rt post-lockdown are greater than 1.2 (explored for values of Rt
from 1.3 to 2.0).
When Rt following lockdown is 1.1 the differences between the immunity scenarios is even more pronounced
with a ten-fold difference in the height of the secondary peak between a scenario of permanent immunity and
one of short-lived immunity, however the secondary peak does not exceed the height (maximum number of
infectious individuals) of the initial wave in any scenario. When immunity wanes rapidly, the second peak
is observed in April 2021 with a maximum of 154,000 infectious individuals and 50,000 daily new cases. By
contrast when immunity is permanent, the number of new infections decays slowly rather than accelerates and
there are projected to be a maximum of only 15,000 infectious individuals and 5,000 daily new cases in April
2021 (Figure 4E).

The dynamics of population immunity (recovered compartments RH +RN ) are similarly shaped by the expected
duration of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and the post-lockdown Rt .
Immunity decays from midway through the lockdown period in scenarios S2–S4 of waning (12 or 6 months)
and short-lived immunity and resurges following a secondary wave of infection if Rt > 1 (Figure 4, panels F &
H). After lockdown, a fall in the proportion of the population immune to the virus is observed until autumn 2020
for all values of Rt , after which point the secondary wave, if Rt > 1, causes the proportion of the population
immune to rise again. This suggests that longitudinal serological surveys to detect waning immunity would be
most informative when conducted in the period June–October 2020.

The large differences in the heights of the secondary peaks when Rt > 1 between immunological scenarios
(Figure 4, panels A, C, E & G) can be explained by the heterogeneity in transmission (see the next generation
matrix in Figure 3). Infectious and immune cases as a proportion of the total age group are shown in Figure 5
for scenarios S1 & S4 of permanent and short-lived immunity where Rt = 1.2 following lockdown. A higher
proportion of individuals aged between 20–39 are infected early in the epidemic, and this leads to 12.4–13.9%
of individuals in these age groups having antibodies by October 2020 when immunity is life-long (Figure 5B).
When immunity wanes, however, by October 2020 this drops to 6.7–7.8% (Figure 5D), thus replenishing the
pool of susceptible individuals with the age groups that disproportionately drive transmission. This causes the
secondary peak of infectious cases to rise more rapidly and to a greater height when immunity wanes rapidly
(Figure 5C), compared with permanent immunity (Figure 5A). Our models suggest that the age distribution
of cases in the epidemic will not change greatly over time; as seen in Figure 5 the ordering of the proportion of
each age group infected remains constant in both scenarios of permanent and short-lived immunity.

We explored the impact of waning immunity and Rt on the equilibrium values for the different simulations
over a longer, five year, period until March 2025 (Table 2). If the post-lockdown Rt is suppressed below
one following lockdown, then the differences in immunity will have less impact on the longer-term infection
dynamics, assuming no imported cases, as transmission of SARS-CoV-2 becomes unsustainable and the virus
reaches extinction between April–November 2021 depending on the immunity scenario. In simulations where Rt
equals one, if immunity is permanent then the epidemic becomes extinct in May 2022. When immunity wanes
there is no secondary peak (Figure 4C), however the infections persist at a low level of endemicity equivalent
to 107, 236 and 1,122 daily cases in immunity scenarios S2–S4, respectively. For larger values of Rt , and where
immunity wanes, the system oscillates with subsequent peaks of infection over the next five years until a steady
state is reached. We find that, if Rt = 1.2 post-lockdown and immunity is short-lived, there is the potential for
over 73,000 new cases daily; 5,000 hospitalisations; and 913 intensive care unit (ICU) admissions (calculated as
17% of all hospitalised cases [61]) at endemic equilibrium (January 2025), which would be sufficient to overwhelm
contact tracing services and ICU capacity [62, 63].

Despite only 6.8% of the adult UK population having immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in our simulation at the
end of the lockdown, the modelled scenarios suggest that, if this acquired immunity wanes over time, there are
substantive differences to the subsequent infection dynamics. Waning immunity impacts on the height of the

secondary peak and, in the absence of future interventions, establishes the virus at levels of endemic equilibrium
that could overwhelm contact tracing services and ICU capacity [62, 63].
We predict that surveys to detect waning immunity at the population level would be most effective when
carried out in the period between the end of lockdown and autumn 2020, as after this point an upsurge in cases
is expected that will increase the proportion of the population with immunity to SARS-CoV-2. In particular,
this will allow evaluation of whether specific antibodies generated against the virus are short-lived if reductions
in antibody prevalence are observed at the population level.
We find that transmission is driven disproportionately by individuals of working age, and subsequently a
higher proportion of individuals aged 20–39 years become infected early in the pandemic and subsequently
develop immunity (Figures 3 & 5). This prediction is borne out by serological data from Switzerland, which
showed that individuals aged 20–49 years were significantly more likely to be seropositive in May 2020 compared
with younger and older age groups [64]. We postulate that ‘key workers’ in the UK population who have continued to work during the lockdown are more likely to have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Higher immunity
among individuals of working age has the effect of slowing the subsequent epidemic when immunity is permanent. Conversely, when immunity wanes, previously infected individuals of working age rejoin the susceptible
pool and so contribute again to transmission; leading to a high growth rate and a larger secondary peak of
infected cases. In these circumstances, efforts to suppress transmission will be challenging in the absence of a
transmission-blocking vaccine [15]. We note that the model structure developed here is capable of simulating
the impact of vaccination with a vaccine that provides temporary transmission-blocking immunity, and could
be used to predict the optimal timing for booster shots.
The projected trajectory of the epidemic after lockdown is highly sensitive to the effective reproduction
number, with model behaviour for values of Rt slightly above or below one displaying qualitatively different
dynamics (Figure 4). Although we do not describe model output for higher values of Rt , the dynamics over
a wider range of effective reproduction numbers post-lockdown (1.3–2.0) are qualitatively the same as when
Rt =1.2. This shows the importance of timely and accurate estimates of Rt to inform control strategies, and
ensuring widespread community testing and contact tracing is in place. Our calculations show that to suppress
Rt below one when contact rates rise to a higher fraction of baseline (pre-lockdown) values, the probability of
infection given contact (represented by the β parameter), must drop by around half. Interventions that have
the potential to reduce the probability of infection include social distancing; regular hand washing; and the

wearing of face masks outside the home [65].
Our study reinforces the importance of better understanding SARS-CoV-2 immunity among recovered individuals of different ages and disease severity. In scenarios where immunity wanes and Rt following lockdown
is greater than one, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic never reaches extinction due to herd immunity, but rather the
number of infected cases oscillates with subsequent waves of infection before reaching endemic equilibrium (Table 2). Even in simulations where the post-lockdown reproduction number only narrowly exceeds one (Rt =1.1),
if immunity wanes over an average of one year for severe cases and three months for non-severe cases, this is
projected to lead to an equilibrium state of nearly 40,000 daily new cases and 500 daily admissions to intensive care. Policy strategies aiming to achieve herd immunity are therefore risky [5]. As individuals can lose
their immunity and become reinfected with SARS-CoV-2, a stable population immunity threshold can never
be reached in the absence of a vaccine with lifelong efficacy [21]. The establishment of an endemic equilibrium
state is dependent on no future interventions or changes to Rt , which we consider unlikely as policy makers and
public health agencies are likely to react to future outbreaks with localised control measures.
One of the strengths of our study is that the model is calibrated to key features of the UK epidemic. While
we did not explicitly fit to data, new cases at the start of the lockdown; cumulative cases in March; and the
proportion of the adult population with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are highly comparable between our output
and current estimates [25, 60]. We used contact matrices from a comprehensive study of contact patterns in
the UK population [47] in addition to demographic data from the Office for National Statistics, to give our
simulations the best chance of capturing realistic age-specific transmission patterns in the UK population.
Plausible estimates on which to base expectations for the duration of immunity are sparse in the current
literature. Rosado et al. estimated that antibodies could wane in 50% of recovered individuals after one year
[57], which is similar to the estimated duration of immunity against seasonal circulating coronaviruses [13, 29].

Even with this consideration, there are many probability distributions that can be used to capture a median
duration of immunity, and our selection of an Erlang distribution with a shape parameter of two is somewhat
arbitrary. Our assumptions on the duration of the latent and infectious periods are more closely informed
by estimates from data [35, 55, 56]. We made the decision to capture the expected duration of these states
as a discretised Erlang distribution rather than the, more conventional, exponential distribution. This has
the benefit of closely replicating fitted gamma or log-normal distributions within a compartmental model [36],
and has important implications for the dynamics of the epidemic [66, 67]. We make a number of assumptions
regarding the natural history of the virus, such as the relative susceptibility of children compared with adults and
the relative infectiousness of symptomatic versus asymptomatic cases based on the current literature [52, 49].
Future empirical studies are likely to add to and further refine these epidemiological parameters. After we
completed the analysis, a study of 37 asymptomatic individuals in China were found to have a longer period
of viral shedding when compared with symptomatic individuals [10]. While viral shedding is not necessarily
indicative of transmission potential [7], if these findings are replicated in larger studies this may suggest a need
to use different durations of infectiousness for asymptomatic and symptomatic infections in subsequent models.
We have aimed to capture future infection dynamics at a national level in the UK under a range of scenarios.
Our analysis is limited by not considering regional differences in transmission rates, for instance through a
patch (metapopulation) model [48], or a stochastic approach that allows for local extinction events [21]. There
are no deaths in our model, either from demography or infection. Accounting for mortality would mainly
affect dynamics in the oldest age group (over 70 years) [16, 61], and the higher probability of disease-induced
mortality would reduce the build up of immunity in this age group (Figure 5D). We also do not explicitly
consider transmission in settings such as schools, hospitals or care homes, although such dynamics may be
captured indirectly through the contact matrix. Given the simplicity of the model structure, we advise against
treating the output as an exact prediction of the future. In addition to the limitations listed above, the epidemic
trajectory will be substantially altered by any future interventions such as a return to full lockdown conditions,
or intensive contact tracing and isolation [29, 68]. We emphasise that the average duration of immunity following
recovery impacts substantially on epidemic growth following the easing of non-pharmaceutical interventions, and
that slight differences in Rt above or below one can lead to qualitatively different infection dynamics.
