Suggested Running Head: COVID-19 suicides in Bangladesh
Abstract
In addition to physical health, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the global
economy and mental health. The economic and social impacts have initiated many psychological
consequences for individuals. In severe cases, these consequences have led to suicidal behavior
among individuals as was witnessed in previous epidemics and pandemics. A few previous
studies have been published with regard to COVID-19 suicides in Bangladesh. However, all
them concerned more unusual cases of suicide rather than a comprehensive overview of suicides
in Bangladesh during the pandemic. Therefore, the present study examined all COVID-19
suicide cases from March 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020, as reported in Bangladeshi online
media news portals. A total of 37 suicide cases were identified (65% male; 65% married) with
hanging being the most common method used (73%). Just under half the suicides were
economically-related reasons due to lock-down-related unemployment (45.9%). These results
shed light on the topic with a clearer understanding of the apparent causalities influencing
individuals to suicide. Furthermore, it may help Bangladeshi policymakers to take necessary
action to prevent further suicides.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has brought about a dramatic
change to individuals’ occupational and social behavior including social distancing,
quarantining, staying in isolation, and working from home. The pandemic has severely disrupted
the global economy and has resulted in unemployment and poverty for millions of individuals
(Kawohl & Nordt, 2020). In addition to economic and physical health impact, the pandemic has
impacted the mental health of many. In the most severe cases, these consequences have led to
suicidal behavior among individuals as was witnessed in the 1918-1919 flu pandemic and in the
2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic (Gunnell et al., 2020). Consequently,
it is imperative to monitor the general population’s suicidal behavior in response to the COVID19 pandemic.
Previously, a few COVID-19 suicide cases were reported in Bangladesh (Bhuiyan et al., 2020;
Mamun & Griffiths, 2020; Mamun et al., 2020a; Mamun, Bodrud-Doza, et al., 2020). However,
these all concerned more unusual cases of suicide rather than a comprehensive overview of
suicides in Bangladesh during the pandemic. Therefore, the present study attempted to document
all the COVID-19-related suicide cases published in Bangladeshi media reports to better
understand the apparent risk factors and risk groups in order to aid prevention of future suicidal
instances.
2. Methods
Given that there is no national suicide surveillance system or database available in Bangladesh,
online search engines (Google and Bing) were used to collect retrospective cases of COVID-19related suicide published in Bangladeshi online media news portals between March 1, 2020, and

September 30, 2020. Similar methods of data collection have been used previously in
Bangladeshi studies (e.g., Mamun et al., 2020b; Arafat et al., 2018). Although the first case of
COVID-19 in the country was reported on March 8, 2020 (Siam et al., 2020), the search was
performed from March 1, 2020 because of the prevalent concern and suspicion about COVID-19
before the first confirmed case (NEWAGE Bangladesh, 2020). The keywords used for search
were the Bangla language words for suicide (‘Attohottma’), coronavirus in Bangladesh
(‘Bangladeshe corona’), COVID-19 in Bangladesh (‘Bangladeshe COVID-19’), and ‘lockdown’.
Two of the authors searched independently and then the search results were combined.
Duplications were removed and suicide cases that related to COVID-19 comprised the dataset.
3. Results
The search identified 37 confirmed COVID-19-related suicide cases reported by Bangladeshi
press media (24 males and 13 females). The first instance of COVID-19-related suicide occurred
on March 23, 2020. The mean age of the suicides was 35.2 years with a range of 10 to 58 years.
Most of the suicides occurred among those who were married (64.9%) and lived in a rural setting
(75.7%). The principal method of committing suicide was hanging (n=27), followed by
consuming poison/pesticide (n=5), jumping from a height (n=4), and setting oneself on fire
(n=1). In most of the cases, multiple factors appeared to contribute to the suicide. In some cases,
one risk factor appeared to lead to another (e.g., unemployment leading to family arguments).
The main reasons underlying the suicides appeared to be lockdown-related unemployment,
depression, family arguments, fear, hunger, poverty, debt, parental abuse, xenophobia, social
stigma, parental dispute, and lack of access to treatment. In relation to occupation, one individual
was a politician holding a public office, two were government service holders, eight did not
report any profession, three were students, and the remaining 23 cases were non-governmental

professionals. The majority of the cases or a close family member (n=17) lost their job due to
COVID-19 or were day-earners and unable to go to work due to COVID-19-related lock-down.
A number of cases were also reported where the victim committed suicide because of failing to
pay loan installments to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and subsequent pressure and/or
humiliation from NGO representatives. Only four of the suicides were reported as having
COVID-19. One recovered from COVID-19 before committing suicide and the remaining cases
did not report whether the individuals had a COVID-19 diagnosis or not. Only one case had a
history of mental health issue such as a previous suicide attempt. The details of all 37 cases are
presented in Table 1.
4. Discussion
The present study examined different variables (i.e., gender, age, occupation, COVID-19
diagnosis, marital status, residence, method of suicide, and apparent suicide reasons) in order to
better understand the determinants associated with COVID-19-related suicides in Bangladesh.
The findings support the previous Bangladeshi findings in relation to apparent reasons for the
suicide (Bhuiyan et al., 2020; Mamun & Griffiths, 2020; Mamun et al., 2020a). However, given
that the pandemic is unprecedented, and this is the first comprehensive study to document all
COVID-19-related suicides in Bangladeshi setting based on available evidence in a given period
of time, no comparison can be made to any previous study in terms of suicidal risk factors and
vulnerable groups. Therefore, the present study provides valuable information about factors are
associated with suicide during the pandemic.
The first case of COVID-19-related suicide due to fear occurred on March 23, 2020, in contrast
to the case reported previously by Mamun and Griffiths (2020) on March 25. This may simply
have been due to the different search engines or strategies used. The highest number of suicides

occurred during June 2020. This coincided with the highest number of COVID-19 cases being
reported in Bangladesh in the same month (see table 2). The present study also found that males
were more likely than females to commit suicide due to COVID-related reasons. Although
suicide is more common in males compared to females globally, Arafat (2019) reported the
opposite in Bangladesh both in the ratio of actual suicides and suicidal attempts. Therefore, it is
noteworthy that the incidence of COVID-19-related suicides was higher among males than
females. This is most likely because males are the principal wage earners for their families in
Bangladeshi society and the economic impact affected males far greater than females.
Unsurprisingly, COVID-19-related unemployment was the primary apparent suicide reason
among other reasons reported. Apart from fear of COVID-19 and xenophobia, all other apparent
reasons for suicide were somewhat related to the individual’s economic status and lack of money
being earned. Like many other countries, the Bangladeshi government implemented a nationwide
lockdown two weeks after the first confirmed case. The 66-day lockdown significantly impacted
low-income families, particularly those who live on a day-to-day income with no savings.
During the lockdown, offices were closed, public transportation was shut, and gatherings were
suspended (Siam et al., 2020). Consequently, many businesses temporarily or permanently
closed, many individuals unemployed. The economic impact was sustained even after the
national lockdown ended as indicated by the suicides reported in August and September 2020
due to the economic crisis. Given that, the government employees were economically protected,
the number of suicides in this group (n=2) was much lower than others, and one case was
because of fear of COVID-19 and depression.
The present study also found that the majority of the suicide cases comprised individuals that
were not diagnosed with COVID-19. This indicates that other factors were more salient in

determining the apparent reasons for suicide. Hanging was the most common form of suicide,
similar to previous studies among the Bangladeshi population (e.g., Arafat et al., 2018). The
higher incidence of suicides among those who were married and lived in rural settings has also
been found previously among the Bangladeshi population (Shah et al., 2017). However, it should
be noted that that data in the present study comprised published press reports identified utilizing
online search engines. Therefore, readers should exercise caution in interpreting the results and
not to generalize to the entire population because of the associated limitations of data collection
utilizing media reports. This method is likely to have led to an under-reporting of suicides given
that not all suicides will have been reported in the media and that some deaths may not have been
as suicides.
5. Conclusion
The present study identified that COVID-19-related unemployment appeared to be the principal
cause of suicide based on the data collected. Males were more vulnerable than females to
suicide. Very few of the suicides were diagnosed with COVID-19 and was much less as a
possible risk factor than economically-related reasons. While the study found that only one
suicide was reported with an individual having a pre-existing mental health issue, there is always
the possibility that other individuals had pre-existing mental health issues but were not made
public by the families and/or the media outlet. Finally, the findings of the present study may help
the country’s policymakers to extend and implement initiatives to protect high-risk groups and
minimize risk factors. Additionally, the study will also help researchers in the field to do
comparative analysis of suicides before, during and after the pandemic.
