Running title: Prolonged immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in outpatients.

2

ABSTRACT

3

New information is emerging about SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and immunity, but little of this

4

information comes from low- and middle-income countries or from patients receiving care in the

5

outpatient setting. The current study investigated the SARS-CoV-2 infection status and antibody

6

responses in 157 patients seeking care for a respiratory disease suggestive of COVID-19 in

7

private healthcare clinics during the first wave (June–October 2020) of infections in Nicaragua.

8

We examined nasal swabs for the presence of viral RNA via RT-PCR and longitudinally

9

collected sera for the changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody levels over six months. Among

10

patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, we evaluated if clinical symptoms were

11

associated with age, hematological parameters and co-morbidities. The combination of PCR and

12

paired serology identified 60 (38%) of the 157 outpatients as acute COVID-19. While both PCR

13

and serology identified the majority (n = 38, 64%) of the acute infections, a notable number of

14

outpatients were identified by RT-qPCR (n = 13, 22%) or by serology (n = 9, 14%) only. During

15

the longitudinal study, we identified 6 new infections by serology among the 97 non-COVID-19

16

subjects. In conclusion, this study report that more than one third of the outpatients seeking care

17

for acute respiratory disease during the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Nicaragua had an

18

acute mild COVID-19 infection that correlate with prolonged humoral response. This immune

19

response to the RBD antigen, more likely IgG dependent, significantly increased between the

20

acute to convalescent and decay in the late convalescent but still remained seropositive.

INTRODUCTION

2

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome

3

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) discovered in Wuhan, China in mid-December 2019 [1]. The

4

disease is characterized by fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, myalgia, fatigue and

5

headache, often accompanied by lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin and elevated lactate

6

dehydrogenase [2, 3]. Older people, and those with underlying medical conditions like

7

cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to

8

develop serious illness [4]. In contrast, young and healthy people infected with SARS-CoV-2

9

typically experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special

10

treatment [5, 6]. Despite the rapidly growing body of knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 infections,

11

more information is needed to better understand disease susceptibility and immunity. For

12

example, more information is needed on whether severe, moderate, mild or asymptomatic

13

SARS-CoV-2 infection elicit persistent immune memory that is protective. The persistence of

14

immunity has important implications for individual protection after infection and community

15

immunity. Another priority for is understanding whether host genetic factors contribute to

16

disease susceptibility or severity. In several studies, blood group O has been associated with

17

lower risk of COVID-19, while non-O blood types are associated with increased risk [7].

18

The coronavirus (CoV) virion consists of a nucleocapsid core surrounded by an envelope

19

containing three membrane proteins, spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) that are

20

common to all members of the genus [8]. SARS-CoV-2 is a β-CoV, a subgroup that includes

21

SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and the two common-cold human CoVs, OC43 and HKU-1 [9]. The

22

Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S) is highly immunogenic and elicit

23

antibodies that are strongly correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization [10-12]. In longitudinal

analyses SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgM antibodies have been shown to decay rapidly, while IgG

2

antibodies remained relatively stable up to 6 months or longer in serum and saliva [13-15]. The

3

median time to seroconversion has been estimated to be between 9 and 12 days post-symptoms

4

onset (PSO) for IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against RBD [16, 17]. In contrast, the median

5

times for IgM and IgA seroreversion appear to be around 49 and 71 days PSO, respectively [16].

6

Few SARS-CoV-2 longitudinal studies have been conducted in patients seeking care in the

7

outpatients setting and in South American populations to estimate the burden of disease and to

8

monitor the durability of immunity. Here we report on the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections

9

among patients with respiratory symptoms presenting to outpatient clinics during the first wave

10

of the pandemic in Nicaragua. We also followed this cohort of patients for 6 months to assess

11

the durability of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies among patients with an initial presentation of

12

mild disease that resolved with no complications in the majority of the patients. Our results are

13

applicable to estimating the burden of COVID-19 disease in Nicaragua and understanding the

14

durability of antibodies among patients with mild to moderate disease.

RESULTS

2

Laboratory diagnosis of acute COVID-19 by RT-qPCR and paired serology. A total of 51 of

3

the 157 outpatients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in NP swabs collected during the acute

4

phase; the Ct median was 24.6 (IQR, 20.3 – 32.0) (Table. 1). When paired acute and

5

convalescent blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific antibody, we observed

6

47/157 (30%) of patients seroconverted confirming acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table. 1). In

7

total 60 of 157 (38%) patients tested positive by PCR or paired serology (Fig. 1A). Of the 60

8

subjects diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, 38 (63%) were identified by both assays

9

(Fig. 1B), 13 (22%) by RT-qPCR only (Fig 1C) and 9 (15%) by serology only (Fig.1D). Re-

10

testing of the NP samples from subjects classified as “serology only” with a secondary, more

11

sensitive, RT-qPCR assay showed amplification in 7 of 9, but Ct values were all >33 indicating

12

low viral load. Of the 13 acute cases identified by PCR only, 5 subjects already had developed

13

antibody in the acute specimen, with no evidence for seroconversion in those that provided a

14

convalescent serum, 3 subjects did not develop detectable antibody in acute or convalescent

15

specimens. The infection status of 5 subjects could not be established by serology as

16

convalescent blood samples were not available (Fig. 1C). Of the 97 outpatients who tested

17

negative for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, 16 had RBD Specific-Ig antibody but not IgM in the

18

acute specimen (collected <5 days PSO), which is indicative of a past infection not linked to the

19

current illness (Fig. 1E). In summary, in the 157 patients evaluated, we observed 60 SARS-CoV-

20

2 incident infections (38%) and 16 (10%) past infections.

21

Temporal patterns of reactivity to the SARS-RBD antigen. Subjects who tested seropositive

22

in either acute or convalescent specimens were invited to provide a second late convalescent

serum sample (>120 days PSO) to measure the durability of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding

antibodies. In total 53 subjects consented to participate, including 39 diagnosed with acute

2

COVID-19 and 14 non-COVID-19 cases. The longitudinal analysis of RBD reactivity showed 3

3

different reactivity patterns. The first pattern observed in 29 subjects showed an increase in

4

signal from acute to the first convalescent specimen and a decrease in signal from early and late

5

convalescent specimen, likely due in part to the decline of IgA and IgM antibodies (Fig.2A and

6

Fig 2E). The second pattern observed in 16 subjects showed a similar increase between the acute

7

and the early convalescent but the signal remained high or even increased between the early and

8

the late-convalescent specimens (Fig. 2B). The third pattern observed in 9 subjects showed either

9

seroconversions (n = 5) or boost (n = 3) in antibody levels between the early and the late

10

convalescent specimens indicative of incident infections and, possibly, re-exposure to antigen

11

(Fig. 2C). Pan-Ig reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen lasted for at least 6-month post-

12

acute infection in the outpatients from this cohort (Fig. 2D) and IgG response was higher and

13

more prolonged than IgM and IgA responses (Fig. 2E).

14

Clinical and Epidemiological fingerprint of COVID-19 in outpatients from León,

15

Nicaragua. Among several parameters examined in outpatient with acute respiratory disease, the

16

following epidemiological characteristics were all associated (p < 0.05) with acute COVID-19 (n

17

= 60) as compared to a non-COVID-19 illness (n = 97): age between 40 and 60 years (OR = 2.1),

18

less frequent hand washing (≤5 times/day; OR = 2.8) and contact with a pet (OR = 2.8) (Table.

19

2). Among the clinical symptoms, fever (OR = 4.2), loss of taste (OR = 2.4), smell (OR = 3.0)

20

and appetite (OR = 2.1) were associated with acute COVID-19 (Table. 3). The frequency of

21

patients with ≥2 comorbidities was higher in acute-COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 patients

22

(28% vs 19%) and the most common was diabetes (18% vs 9%). After examination of several

23

laboratory parameters, lower white cells count, presence of immature granulocytes, lower

relative percent of eosinophils, higher INR, CRP-positivity and lower erythrocyte sedimentation

2

rate were all associated with acute COVID-19 (Table. 4). Interestingly, while most hematologic

3

parameters in convalescent blood normalized, participants with an acute COVID-19 diagnosis

4

had persistently lower hemoglobin, red blood cell counts and hematocrit. Patients with acute

5

COVID-19 were more likely to be treated with, ivermectin, azitromycin, aspirin and Vitamin C

6

(Supplement). During the convalescent visit, 4 (2.5%) of 157 reported hospitalizations for their

7

illness and 2 (1.3%) fatalities were confirmed; both of them had a diagnosis of acute COVID-19.

There was an association between the frequency of outpatient with diagnosis of acute COVID-19

from the current study and confirmed cases from Nicaragua, mainly derived from hospitalized

10

patients, reported in the Johns Hopkins University website [18] (Fig. 3).

DISCUSION

2

The current study contributes to our understanding of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2

3

over 6 months in outpatients in Nicaragua a country with limited epidemiological and

4

immunological data during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study also extends previous

5

knowledge on clinical, epidemiological, laboratory diagnosis and treatment associated with acute

6

SARS-CoV-2 infection in outpatients.

7

Molecular and serological testing confirmed that more than one third of the outpatients seeking

8

care for acute respiratory disease during the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Nicaragua

9

had an acute COVID-19 infection (Table 1). Other infectious etiologies with a similar clinical

10

and epidemiological profile that may have been co-circulating in this setting at the same time

11

frame (June – October 2020), such as influenza or pneumococcal, remain to be investigated.

12

Acute respiratory infections typically peak in incidence between July and October in Nicaragua

13

[19].

14

Initial serologic analysis to explore antibody response to the RBD antigen showed 3 categories,

15

the first includes subjects with naïve acute serum but highly reactive convalescent serum to the

16

RBD antigen (Fig. 1B), the second were subjects with acute and convalescent serum highly or

17

mildly reactive to the RBD antigen, indicative of prior infection if the serum was collected < 5

18

days PSO (Fig. 1E) and the third includes subjects that do not experience seroconversion to the

19

RBD antigen despite RNA detection in NP by RT-qPCR (Fig. 1C). The reactivity to the RBD

20

antigen observed in most of the acute outpatients with COVID-19 indicate activation of the

21

humoral response and is suggestive of the development of neutralizing antibodies with the

22

capacity to block SARS-COV-2 spike protein interaction with its cognate receptor ACE-2 as

23

previously reported [17, 20]. The presence of viral RNA without serological response suggests

1

false-positive PCR or atypical antibody responses, which have been reported in some patients

2

[17, 21]. Genomic studies have shown a continuous emergence of novel variants in several

3

populations, although there is little information on the presence of these or other variants in

4

Central American populations [22, 23]. It was also interesting to observe RT-qPCR negative

5

individuals with strong reactivity to the RBD antigen in convalescent serum suggestive of false-

6

negative RT-qPCR test (Fig. 1D). Re-examination with an alternative RT-qPCR that used more

7

sensitive primers and probes to the E region [24] than the Charité system [25] showed RNA

8

amplification in 7 of those 9 subjects, confirming that these were indeed false negatives. Our

9

results demonstrate the value of using both RT-qPCR and paired serology for laboratory

10

confirmation of acute COVID-19 cases.

11

We also analyzed a subset of acute COVID-19 cases to understand the long-term dynamics of

12

antibody responses. We observed three patterns of changes in antibody levels over a 6 month

13

follow up period. In the first pattern, reactivity to the RBD antigen significantly increased

14

between the acute to convalescent, thereafter decreased in the late convalescence, but remained

15

seropositive up to 6 months (Figs. 2A). In the second pattern, the reactivity did not decay and

16

remained high between convalescent and late convalescent sera, indicative of strong immune

17

response over 6 months (Fig. 2B). The third pattern was characterized by incident infections and

18

boost in the reactivity to RBD between convalescent and late convalescent serum. The boost in

19

Ab levels between convalescence and late convalescence may indicate a secondary subclinical

20

infection, possibly by SARS-CoV-2 variants.

21

The clinical symptoms and laboratory profiles of this Nicaraguan outpatient cohort follows the

22

trend observed in hospitalized patients from several other studies [27, 28]. This profile includes

23

loss of taste, smell and appetite, age 40 to 60 years, contact with pets, reduced hand washing,

lower leukocytes counts, lower eosinophils, increased INR and increased erythrocyte

2

sedimentation rate. As compared with non-COVID-19 patients, C-reactive protein (CRP) test

3

was more likely to be positive in COVID-19 outpatients (42% vs 48%, p < 0.05), suggesting that

4

CRP positivity is common in patients mild COVID-19 disease as observed in severe cases with

5

excessive inflammation [29]. In previous studies, the degree of lymphocytes count gives a hint

6

for disease prognosis and is found to be positively correlated with disease severity [27]. For

7

instance, preliminary studies from Wuhan reported lymphopenia in 80% of the critical patients

8

and 25% in patients with mild COVID-19 infection [30, 31]. Given the significantly lower

9

leucocytes counts observed in COVID-19 patients in this study, is likely that they also

10

experienced lower lymphocytes counts, but with similar differential white blood cell proportions

11

(35.5% vs 34.6%) as compare with non-COVID-19 patient, which is in line with mild disease. It

12

has previously been suggested that lower eosinophils counts is associated with acute respiratory

13

deterioration during SARS-CoV-2 [32], the current study further show that lower eosinophils

14

counts is also associated with non-severe disease and might be considered a marker of infection

15

in general. A similar multidrug therapy (ivermectin, azithromycin and aspirin) to the used in the

16

current study have shown to improve recovery and prevent risk of hospitalization and death

17

among ambulatory COVID-19 cases in Mexico [33], but further effectiveness studies will be

18

needed to reach any conclusion.

19

The correlation between the COVID-19 status and the distribution of ABO, Lewis and Secretors

20

phenotypes was explored, but the lower frequency of the non-O blood, LeA and Se- phenotypes

21

in this population required a higher sample size to establish a reliable conclusion.

22

In conclusion, this study report that more than one third of the outpatients seeking care for acute

23

respiratory disease during the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Nicaragua had an acute

MATERIAL AND METHODS.

2

Study subjects. A total of 157 patients, with a median of 43 years of age (IQR, 32 - 59), seeking

3

care for respiratory disease suggestive of COVID-19 in private healthcare clinics were

4

prospectively enrolled between June to October 2020 in Leon, Nicaragua. Following the

5

clinician’s consultation each patient was asked by phone to participate in the study. Interested

6

patients were visited in their household by the study team within 17 days PSO to obtain informed

7

consent and collect clinical and demographic data in a questionnaire. Nasopharyngeal swabs and

8

blood samples were collected for RT-qPCR and Pan-immunoglobulin (IgM, IgG and IgA)

9

screening, respectively. Patients were also asked to provide a second blood sample during

10

convalescent phase, 20 to 60 days PSO, and a third blood sample (late-convalescent) between

11

120 – 180 days PSO. This study was approved by the ethical committee for biomedical research

12

from

13

(FWA00004523/IRB00003342). All patients signed an inform consent and all methods applied

RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 screening. Viral RNA extraction was performed from 140μl of the

4

solution containing the nasopharyngeal (NP) swab by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit

5

(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Purified viral RNA was

6

analyzed by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 screening by using the Sarbeco-E primers and probes

7

described in the Charité assay [25]. The primers and probes for the RdRp gene described in the

8

Charité assay were not considered based in a previous report showing low sensitivity [36]. RT-

9

qPCR was performed with the AgPath-ID OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

10

Waltham, MA) using a Light Cycler®96 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). A sample was

11

considered positive if the cycle threshold (Ct) value was ≤ 36. NP samples from patients

12

diagnosed by serology only were re-examined with primers and probes described by Smyrlaki

13

and coworkers, Ct ≤ 36 [24].

14

In-house RBD ELISA. The protein expression and purification of the recombinant SARS-CoV-

15

2 RBD antigen used were previously described by Premkumar and coworkers [17]. The

16

sensitivity and specificity of this assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been found to be

17

98% and 100% at 9 days PSO, respectively [17]. In brief, anti-RBD specific immunoglobulins

18

(Ig) and IgM antibodies (ab) were determined by ELISA using heat inactivated serum at 56°C

19

for 30 minutes. The 96-well high-binding microtiter plate (Greiner bio one cat # 655061) was

20

coated with 50 µl of the RBD antigen at 4µg/ml in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS) pH 7.4 for 1 hr at

21

37°C. Plates were blocked with 100 µl of blocking solution (3% non-fat milk (Pinito) in TBS

22

containing 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 hr at 37°C and 50 µl of serum at 1:40 in blocking buffer was

anti-human alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody mixture at 1:2500 dilution was added for 1

2

hr at 37°C 1. The mixture contains anti-IgG (Sigma Cat # A9544), anti-IgA (Ab cam Cat #

3

AB97212), and anti-IgM (Sigma Cat # A3437) antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase.

4

After washing, 50 µl P-Nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (SIGMA FAST, Cat No N2770) was

5

added to the wells and the optical density (OD) was measured after 10 min at 405nm by using a

6

plate reader (Biotek Epoh). Acute serum with OD readings of ≥0.300 in the Pan-immunoglobulin

7

RBD assay (Pan-Ig-RBD) were defined as seropositive. OD readings of ≥ 0.300 in acute samples

8

collected ≤5days PSO were indicative of prior infection if Pan-Ig was positive but IgM-negative.

9

In seropositive patients, a recent infection or seroconversion was defined as the ratio between the

10

OD-convalescent/OD-acute ≥2. All subjects seropositive in acute and convalescent serum were

11

asked to provide a third sample to investigate prolonged humoral response. All acute,

12

convalescent and late convalescent serum samples were analyzed for IgG, IgA and IgM

13

separately using isotype specific goat anti-human antibody by following the same procedure used

14

for Pan-Ig.

15

Statistics. Patients RT-qPCR-positive and/or seroconverted were defined as acute COVID-19

16

and RT-qPCR-negative with non-seroconversion was defined as non-COVID-19. Arithmetic

17

mean with standard deviation (±SD) was used to compare continuous variables. Frequency and

18

percentages were used to compare categorical variables. The differences between two groups of

19

continuous variables was tested by using independent t-test. A regression univariate model was

20

applied to explore risk factors associated with acute COVID-19, only categorical variables were

21

included in the model. Odds Ratio (OR) was calculated to determine the degree of association at

22

95% confident interval (95%, CI), the association was significant if α was <0.05, all statistical
