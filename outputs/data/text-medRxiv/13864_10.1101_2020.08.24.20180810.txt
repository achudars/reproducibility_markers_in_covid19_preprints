Abstract
The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing
COVID-19 has rapidly turned into a pandemic, infecting millions and causing ~7 million
deaths across the globe. In addition to studying the mode of transmission and evasion
of host immune system, analysing the viral mutational landscape constitutes an area
under active research. The latter is expected to impart knowledge on the emergence of
different clades, subclades, viral protein functions and protein-protein and protein–RNA
interactions during replication/transcription cycle of virus and response to host immune
checkpoints. In this study we have attempted to bring forth the viral genomic variants
defining the major clade(s) as identified from samples collected from the state of
Telangana, India.

Introduction
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the Hubei province of China during late December
2019, has since taken the shape of a global pandemic, spreading across more than 200
countries, and resulting in approximately 7,75,581 deaths worldwide, as per recent
statistics by World Health Organization (WHO) (https://covid19.who.int/, August 19,
2020). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the subfamily Coronavirinae of the Coronaviridae
family, classified under the order Nidovirales1. After host entry, the 29.9 kb positive
sense, single-stranded, unsegmented RNA genome of this virus gives rise to 15 nonstructural proteins (nsps, 1-15). The subsequent replication and transcription cycles
produce a genomic RNA template along with nine subgenomic RNAs, which are further
translated to form major structural proteins viz.Spike (S), Envelope (E), Nucleocapsid
(N) and Membrane (M) proteins 2. They share a high degree of sequence similarity with
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV, >80%) and a moderate
sequence similarity with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV,
>50%)3. The severity of the pandemic has demanded a concerted effort to
comprehensively study the actively changing mutational landscape of the virus across
multiple demographic locations and identify potential variant clusters or individual
variants which might play a critical role in its spread and transmission dynamics.

The state of Telangana, located in south-central India, has seen an unusually high rate
of infection and there appears to have been a sharp spike in the number of cases
beginning from the second half of April 2020. In this study, we aimed at identifying the
dominant lineages present in the samples collected in Telangana, among all identified
lineages of SARS-CoV-2. We further endeavoured to draft a comprehensive mutational
landscape of the viral genome from among patient samples in Telangana state.
Towards this end, we applied next generation sequencing to determine the complete
sequence of 210 SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples.

Data and Methods
Sample collection and processing
The Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), Hyderabad, initiated
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) based diagnostics for Covid-19 infection after
approvals from Secretary, Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India,
Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) nominated nodal officer in Hyderabad,
Telangana as well as from the Telangana state government. The work was initiated
following approvals from the Institutional Bioethics committee and Biosafety committee.
The samples were obtained as nasopharyngeal swabs collected in Viral Transport
Medium from different parts of Telangana from patients with symptoms suggestive of
Covid-19 as well as asymptomatic primary contacts of affected cases. The samples
were transported to CDFD within 24 hours while maintaining a cold chain. Total RNA
was isolated using the RNA isolation kit as per manufacturer's instructions (QIAmp Viral
RNA Mini Kit; Cat #52906; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Each RNA sample was subjected
to RT-PCR for multiple viral genes (including E-gene and RDRP gene) using the
LabGun COVID-19 assay (Cat #CV9017B; LabGenomics, Republic of Korea) or the
Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Cat #RP10250X, Seegene, Republic of Korea). The samples
which tested positive in RT-PCR analysis were included for viral genome sequencing.
Since RDRP consistently provided more robust amplification than E-gene and is a
SARS-COVID-2 specific gene (unlike E-gene which is specific for all respiratory
coronaviruses), we considered Ct values of RDRP gene alone for analysis. Samples
exhibiting an RDRP Ct value greater than 10 and less than 35 were chosen for
sequencing.

Sequencing protocol
Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples was performed using protocol described
earlier (Quick et al., 2020) with slight modifications. Briefly, RNA isolated from
nasopharyngeal swabs was reverse transcribed using random primer mix (New England
Biolabs, Massachusetts, United States), and Superscript-IV (Thermofisher Scientific,
Massachusetts, United States). The resulting cDNA was subjected to a 3-step multiplex
PCR using nCoV-2019/V3 primer pools (Eurofins, India) 1, 2 and 3. The

∼400

bp

amplicons thus obtained in the pools were combined, purified using Agencourt AMPure
XP beads (Beckman Coulter, California, United States) and eluted in 45µl elution buffer

(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA libraries for Illumina sequencing were prepared using
the NEB Next Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs,
Massachusetts, United States), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Paired-End
Sequencing (2×250 bp) was performed on the Miseq FGx (Illumina Inc, California,
United States) with a targeted depth of 0.5 million reads per sample (∼4,000X
coverage). Libraries for Nanopore sequencing were prepared using the Ligation
sequencing kit (LSK-109; Oxford Nanopore Technologies, London, United Kingdom).
Barcoded libraries were pooled (12-24 samples each) and sequenced on a MinION flow
cell in GridION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, London, United Kingdom). Sequencing
was performed with a targeted depth of 0.1 million reads per sample (up to 24 hours).

Mutation analysis
All raw fastq files from Illumina were checked for overall sequencing quality, presence of
adapters and bad quality reads using FastQC and Fastp4. The adapter sequences were
trimmed using a wrapper script for Cutadapt5 tool, called Trim Galore. The filtered reads
were aligned to the reference strain NC_045512.1, Severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, using bwa-mem6 algorithm with default parameters.
Mapping quality was assessed using samtools7 and BAMStats. Post alignment, the
reads were filtered, sorted and indexed using samtools, and any primer sequences
were masked using iVar8. Subsequent mutation calling and generation of consensus
sequence was performed using samtools mpileup and iVar (https://github.com/connorlab/ncov2019-artic-nf/). The resulting VCF files were annotated using snpEff9. For
processing the nanopore data, we followed the protocol suggested by ARTIC pipeline
(https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics,

https://github.com/connor-

lab/ncov2019-artic-nf/) for mutation calling as well as for assembling the reads for
generating the consensus sequence. A schematic describing the entire workflow is
shown in Supplementary Fig S1. Before analysing the obtained calls, we filtered all the
problematic sites prone to errors by multiple sources as recommended by De Maio et al
(https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473).

Phylogenetic analysis
The consensus fasta files generated for both Illumina and Nanopore data were
subjected for phylogenetic analysis using the Nextstrain pipeline with recommended

default criteria for filtering, multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and nucleotide
substitution calculations. To briefly summarize the workflow of the pipeline, all the
consensus sequences having length < 27000 and Ns > 5% were filtered out. Three
samples were removed from further analysis as their sequence data included Ns > 5%;
thus all analyses were conducted on 207 individual patient viral genome sequences. A
compendium of problematic sites as used earlier (https://virological.org/t/issues-withsars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473), was also provided to mask those sites prior to MSA
by MAFFT10. Following MSA, the workflow constructed a time-resolved phylogenetic
tree using the maximum likelihood based method IQ-TREE11. The resultant tree was
pruned and internal nodes and ancestral traits were inferred from the dates of the
sample collection using TreeTime12. The final tree in Newick format was then
customized for visualization using iTol13.

Results
General sample features
Our dataset consists of samples collected during late March to July, 2020. Interestingly,
samples collected from late May till July represented a higher proportion of
asymptomatic cases when compared to samples collected earlier (Figure 1a). A
majority of our samples belonged to age group between15-62 years, with males (61%)
dominating the profile distribution over females (39%) (Figure 1b). We also compared
the distribution of cases with respect to Ct values, the latter being a proxy for viral load.
Symptomatic cases appeared to be associated with higher Ct values (thus lower viral
load), compared to asymptomatic ones, which was unexpected (Figure 1c). there was a
reduction in the Ct values in samples, as we neared the end of June, 2020, implying
that more recent samples seemed to carry a higher viral load than earlier samples
(Supplementary figure S2a). The distribution of Ct values with respect to age showed
no clear correlation (Supplementary figure S2b). However, there was a consistent rise
in the fraction of samples showing asymptomatic behaviour, as calculated from a
cumulative increment, as opposed to symptomatic, starting from the end of May (Figure
1d). The locale distribution of the samples in and around the district of Hyderabad is
indicated in Supplementary figure S2c.

Phylodynamic epidemiological clustering of SARS-Cov2 strains
The phylodynamic clustering of samples suggested presence of 2 minor (19A, 20A) and
one major clade (20B). The phylogenetic clustering was rooted with respect to the
sequence from the Wuhan Wu-1 strain (NC_045512.1), which has been annotated as
the base clade 19A. One sample (collected in April, 2020) seemed to directly emerge
from this base clade. Further, five samples harbored the C13730T mutation linking them
to the base clade (establishing sub-clade 19A/C13730T). This split was marked by
missense mutations G1820A (ORF1a, G519S), C6310A (ORF1a, S2015R), C6312A
(ORF1a, T2016K), C28311T (N, P13L), and two synonymous mutations C19524T
(ORF1a, L6425L) and C23929T (S, Y789Y). The first major split in our dataset was
observed at around the starting of April, marking the onset of 20A clade, and was
characterized by the appearance of co-occurring mutations C241T (5’-UTR),
synonymous C3037T (ORF1ab, F924F), and missense C14408T (ORF1ab, P4720L)
and A23403G (S, D614G). Seven samples belonged to this 20A clade, directly linked to

the dominant viral lineage established in Europe (Belgium, Italy, of which one exhibited
a distinct 20A/18877T profile. This division retained none of the mutations found in the
initial samples belonging to 19A and 19A/C13730T cluster (Supplementary figure S3).
From the middle of April and onwards, the profile was strongly dominated by the 20B
clade, which also formed the second cluster within this division, with a characteristic
mutation of GGG28881/28882/28883>AAC (Figure 2 and Supplementary figure S4.
Thus, of all the clades identified, our dataset was strongly populated by the presence of
a single major clade 20B. From a time resolved mutational map calculated for all
samples (Supplementary figure S4), we observed that the more recent samples,
collected from the end of June onwards, did not show many of the mutations found in
ORF1a, C5700A (nsp3, A1812D), C6573T (nsp3, S2103F) and C25528T (ORF3a,
L46F). These samples also coincided with the most diverged samples along the
phylogenetic time-tree, indicating towards a newer divergence path of the virus among
the later infections. We checked whether these samples belonged to any single cluster
within the phylogenetic tree, but they were found to be interspersed among different
branches (Figure 2, Supplementary figure S4). Within the dominant 20B clade, a
major proportion of samples between the age group of 15 and 50 were found to be
asymptomatic, while the symptomatic patients mainly belonged to samples collected
from age group >50. As also discussed before, the viral load, calculated in terms of
RdRp gene, was found to be primarily associated with asymptomatic patients. This
behaviour can explain the higher transmission rates of the virus among the Indian
population, in general, as opposed to per capita mortality rates, which will be further
elaborated upon in the next section. A location wise distribution indicating the
neighbourhood origin of the samples in the phylogeny tree has been shown in
Supplementary figure S5.

We performed Nextstrain analysis separately on our Illumina and nanopore datasets, in
order to rule out the possibility of incorporation of any bias in cluster formation due to
the sequencing platform. The clusters obtained did not show any segregation due to the
platform used and were distributed across the clades (data not shown).

Mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2
From the mutation analysis on the filtered, combined pool of 207 sequences from
Illumina and Nanopore data, we obtained a total 302 mutations across the SARS-CoV-2
genome (Supplementary data D1). From this set, 17 mutations were consistently
found to be present in >10% of samples (Figure 3a). The proportion of asymptomatic
cases for each of these 17 high frequency mutations, as a fraction of the total number of
cases, was found to be higher than symptomatic cases (Figure 3b). Further, for each of
the 17 high frequency mutation identified in this set, we calculated the cumulative
increment in the frequency of case symptoms as a function of time and noted a
consistent increase in the frequency of asymptomatic cases specially for missense
mutations (Supplementary figure S6). Of these 17 high frequency mutations, 5 viz.
C241T (5’-UTR), C3037T (ORF1a), C14408T (nsp12, ORF1ab), A23403G (S),
GGG28881-3AAC (N) were highly recurrent (present in >80% of the samples; Figure
3a). The A23403G (D614G) mutation in Spike protein was identified in samples as early
as beginning of April, 2020. Although a highly recurrent mutation in multiple
demographics, no clear correlation has been established between D614G mutation and
severity of disease

14

. The D614G mutation has almost invariably been found to be

associated with C241>T, C3037>T (a silent mutation) and a mutation in RNA dependent
RNA polymerase gene, nsp12 C14408>T as has also been reported earlier

15

. The

haplotype defined by the co-occurrence of these 4 mutations is the current dominant
form circulating across the world. Apart from these four mutations, the nsp3 protein
region within ORF1a also displayed a higher frequency of mutations, G4354A, A4372G,
C5700A, C6027T, C6573T, the latter three being missense mutations. Of these, C5700
along with a silent C313T mutation has been reported to co-occur in samples collected
from Western state of Maharashtra, India 16. The nsp4 and nsp5 proteins each harbored
one high frequency missense mutation each namely C9693T and C10815T,
respectively. Similarly, the ORF3a region possessed one high frequency missense
mutation C25528T.

Discussion
In the current study, we have presented a comprehensive map of the mutations
identified from the confirmed COVID-19 cases collected from the southern state of
India, Telangana. After a slow progress of the outbreak during the months of FebruaryApril, the state has been witnessing a constant upsurge in the number of infections and
has been listed as one of the worst affected states in the country. Identifying the
mutations from samples collected over a period of time, provides a way to assess the
genomic diversity which the virus might have experienced during infection and
transmission. With these aspects in our purview, we have attempted to characterize the
genomic epidemiology of novel coronavirus and a comprehensive mutational
landscape, using a dataset of 210 samples sequenced using both Illumina and
Nanopore sequencing technologies. Most of our samples were collected from midMarch with the months of June-July reporting highest collections. A significantly higher
association of samples with asymptomatic behaviour was noted, which were also
associated with lower Ct values. We also observed an upsurge in the asymptomatic
cases compared to symptomatic. A majority of our samples belonged to the 20B clade,
with the clade seeming to appear in the beginning of April. Although we did not see a
clear correlation between age and viral load, it was observed that samples collected
from higher age groups frequently displayed symptomatic behaviour.
More importantly, mutational analysis revealed the presence of unique mutations in the
samples from Telangana, especially in the nsp3, nsp4, nsp5 and ORF3a. The nsp3 is a
papain-like protease (PLP2) and nsp5 is a 3C-like protease (3CLpro), both required for
cleavage of polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab to generate 16 non-structural proteins (nsp116)

17

. Nsp3 is the largest multidomain protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2, and binds to

viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein

18

. The mutations identified in nsp3 viz. C6027T

(P1921L), C5700A (Ala1812Asp) and C6573T (S2103F) lie in the protease like (PLP2)
and protease like non-canonical (PLnc) domains of the protein. The PLnc domain has
been shown to interact with a large number of nsp partners during viral replication and

replication/transcription complex (RTC) formation. The formation of RTC also requires

19

. Hence, it could be speculated that these

mutations can potentially alter the balance or stoichiometry of the complex formation,

perhaps causing viral RTC reprogramming. The RTC complexes in coronaviruses have
been shown to perform multiple tasks during replication and transcription by being able
to form compositionally diverse complexes, each specific to carry out a particular
process. It is possible that these mutations could bring about a switch in this
compositional programming 19.
SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a encodes an accessory, transmembrane, ion-channel protein,
belonging to the class of proteins called Viroporins, which induce innate immune
signalling receptor NLRP3, leading to production of cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)

20

. This often results in tissue inflammation in a SARS-CoV-2

infection. The most common mutations identified in ORF3a among the prevalent
lineages across the world is Q57H and G251V

21

. However, the C25528T (L46F)

mutation observed in this study localizes to the same domain I as Q57H, in the Nterminal signal-peptide region of the protein. This region is critical for viral localization to
the Golgi apparatus. Functional impact of these mutations on the location, and
subsequent translation and assembly, might require additional experimental evidences.
In addition to these high frequency mutations, we also observed a few low frequency
mutations in the Spike, N , nsp3 and nsp2 proteins. A detailed study of these mutations
and their functional impact on the viral life cycle is currently underway.
In conclusion, we report the comprehensive mutation landscape of more than 200
individual SARS-CoV-2 viral genome sequences isolated from COVID-19 patients or
primary contacts. We report the 20B clade as the major clade in Telangana which is
similar to reports from West India. The data forms a starting point for the state
government machinery to conduct further studies on virus transmission helping in taking
informed public health decisions. The genomic mutations also inform on potential
mechanisms being employed during evasion of the host’s immune response and traces
of higher or lower pathogenicity, if any, being developed over the span of time, thus
significantly impacting efforts in vaccine development.
