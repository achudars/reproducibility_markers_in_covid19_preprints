Abstract
Background
The relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and ischemic stroke is poorly
defined. We aimed to leverage genetic data to investigate reported associations.
Methods
Genetic association estimates for liability to Covid-19 and cardiovascular traits were obtained
from large-scale consortia. Analyses primarily focused on critical Covid-19, defined as
hospitalization with Covid-19 requiring respiratory support or resulting in death. Cross-trait
linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to estimate genetic correlations of critical
Covid-19 with ischemic stroke, other related cardiovascular outcomes, and risk factors
common to both Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease (body mass index, smoking and
chronic inflammation, estimated using C-reactive protein). Mendelian randomization analysis
was performed to investigate whether liability to critical Covid-19 was associated with
increased risk of any of the cardiovascular outcomes for which genetic correlation was
identified.
Results
There was evidence of genetic correlation between critical Covid-19 and ischemic stroke
(rg=0.29, FDR p-value=4.65x10-3), body mass index (rg=0.21, FDR-p-value=6.26x10-6) and
C-reactive protein (rg=0.20, FDR-p-value=1.35x10-4), but none of the other considered traits.
In Mendelian randomization analysis, liability to critical Covid-19 was associated with
increased risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] per logOR increase in genetically predicted
critical Covid-19 liability 1.03, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.06, p-value=0.03). Similar
estimates were obtained when considering ischemic stroke subtypes. Consistent estimates
were also obtained when performing statistical sensitivity analyses more robust to the

inclusion of pleiotropic variants, including multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses
adjusting for potential genetic confounding through body mass index, smoking and chronic
inflammation. There was no evidence to suggest that genetic liability to ischemic stroke
increased the risk of critical Covid-19.
Conclusions
These data support that liability to critical Covid-19 is associated with an increased risk of
ischemic stroke. The host response predisposing to severe Covid-19 is likely to increase the
risk of ischemic stroke, independent of other potentially mitigating risk factors.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the cause of the
coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic that has resulted in a health crisis of
unprecedented magnitude.1, 2 While much of the disease burden relates to respiratory failure
and sepsis, some studies suggest an increased risk of ischemic stroke.3-6 This has been
estimated to be seven times greater than in influenza infection,3 with up to 5% of people with
severe Covid-19 suffering stroke.5 Strokes that occur in individuals with Covid-19 are more
severe, have poorer outcomes and higher mortality rates than in those without Covid-19,
despite similar acute managment.6, 7 Indeed, almost two-fifths of people with Covid-19 who
develop stroke consequently die.8 However, some studies do not support an increased risk of
stroke in individuals with Covid-19.9, 10 Obtaining unbiased estimates for the risk of stroke in
people with Covid-19 is challenging due to difficulty diagnosing mild Covid-19 and an
overall reduction in the rate of admission to hospital with stroke, and minor stroke in
particular, during the pandemic.9,

11

Furthermore, observational studies investigating the

association between Covid-19 and stroke are vulnerable to potential confounding and reverse
causation.3-6 For example, there are common risk factors for severe Covid-19 and stroke, such
as obesity and smoking12. Similarly, patients with acute stroke have a dampened immune
response and may be more susceptible to severe Covid-19.13
Leverage of genetic data can help overcome some of these issues. Cross-trait linkage
disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) can be used to estimate the genetic correlation
between traits. Mendelian randomization (MR) can be employed to investigate whether
genetic variants predicting an exposure (such as Covid-19) also associate with risk of an
outcome (such as ischemic stroke).14 There are numerous plausible mechanisms by which
Covid-19 may be increasing ischemic stroke risk. Covid-19 can trigger a cytokine storm with
upregulation of pro-inflammatory signaling and endothelial dysfunction that predisposes to a

hypercoagulable state and can lead to thromboembolic events.15 Indeed, Covid-19 also
appears to promote the development of other cardiovascular disorders including myocardial
injury, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, heart failure and venous thromboembolism.15
Furthermore, pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with high mortality in
people with Covid-19, which has raised the possibility of a bidirectional interaction between
Covid-19 and the cardiovascular system.15 MR analyses can also allow the exploration of
such bidirectional relationships.
Elucidating the relationship between Covid-19 and risk of ischemic stroke could prove
important for optimizing prevention and treatment strategies. With this in mind, we
performed cross-trait LDSC to investigate whether there is a genetic correlation between
Covid-19 and ischemic stroke, and followed this up with MR analyses to investigate whether
any such statistically significant correlation might be explained by liability to Covid-19 being
associated

with

increased

Study overview
First, we performed cross-trait LDSC to estimate genetic correlations for Covid-19 with
ischemic stroke, other related CVDs, and risk factors common to both Covid-19 and CVD.
Second, for CVD outcomes that showed evidence of genetic correlation with Covid-19, MR
analysis was performed to investigate whether liability to Covid-19 was also associated with
these outcomes. Finally, bidirectional MR was carried out to investigate potential reverse
associations, i.e. whether genetic liability to the CVD outcome was also associated with
increased risk of Covid-19.
Exposure definitions and genetic association estimates for Covid-19
Genetic association estimates for Covid-19 were obtained from release 5 of the Covid-19 host
genetics consortium.16 In our analysis we focused on the most severe definition of Covid-19
available, where a critical case is defined as an individual who was hospitalized with
laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and required respiratory support or died.
Genetic associations were derived from 5,101 cases and 1,383,241 controls from the general
population. Hospital admission and requiring respiratory support or death is a proxy for
disease severity and is preferred here over other case definitions which are solely based on a
positive Covid-19 test result. Previous studies have shown that bias may impact analyses
identifying cases based on likelihood of testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, because

participants being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection are selected for a wide range of genetic,
behavioral and demographic traits.9
Results based on other Covid-19 definitions from the Covid-19 host genetics consortium
were performed as further sensitivity analysis. Firstly, we compared individuals with
laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had been hospitalized (cases) versus
individuals with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who did not require
hospitalization (4,829 cases and 11,816 controls). Secondly, we compared individuals with
laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had been hospitalized (cases) versus the
general population (9,986 cases and 1,877,672 controls). The final definition was based on
individuals with reported Covid-19 (laboratory confirmed, physician-reported or selfreported; cases) versus controls from the general population (38,984 cases and 1,644,784
controls).
Outcomes
Ischemic stroke
The primary outcome was any ischemic stroke (34,217 cases). In secondary, hypothesisgenerating analyses, stroke subtypes were further explored as large artery stroke (LAS, 4,373
cases), cardioembolic stroke (CES, 7,193 cases) and small vessel stroke (SVS, 5,386 cases).17
The common control pool included 406,111 individuals. Genetic association data were
derived from the MEGASTROKE consortium.18
Related cardiovascular disease outcomes
We considered other CVD outcomes related to ischemic stroke in their pathophysiology.
These were coronary artery disease (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary
syndrome, chronic stable angina or >50% coronary artery stenosis), heart failure and atrial
fibrillation. Genetic associations with risk for coronary artery disease were measured on

60,801 cases and 123,504 controls and taken from the Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome
wide Replication and Meta-analysis (CARDIOGRAM) plus The Coronary Artery Disease
(C4D) consortium (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D),19 for heart failure were measured on 47,309
cases and 930,014 controls and taken from the HEart failuRe Molecular Epidemiology for
therapeutic targetS (HERMES) consortium20 and for atrial fibrillation were measured on
65,446 cases and 522,744 controls and taken from a transethnic meta-analysis.21
Risk factors related to both Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease
To investigate whether any genetic correlation between critical Covid-19 and the CVD
outcomes was related to confounding factors, we further considered common risk factors to
both, including obesity, smoking and chronic inflammation.22-25 Genetic association estimates
to proxy these traits were taken from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on body
mass index (BMI) measured on 694,649 subjects,26 lifetime smoking index measured on
462,690 subjects,27 and C-reactive protein (CRP) measured on 361,194 individuals in UK
Biobank 28.
Statistical analyses
Cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression
We performed LDSC to estimate the genetic correlation (rg) of critical Covid-19 with the
primary outcome ischemic stroke, and secondary outcomes coronary artery disease, heart
failure and atrial fibrillation, using GWAS summary statistics data.29,30 We also estimated
correlation with possible genetic confounders, including BMI, lifetime smoking index and
CRP. We restricted our analyses to HapMap 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
which are known to be well-imputed across most studies and utilized the pre-computed
European LD-scores estimated using the 1000G reference panel, provided by the LDSC
creators. For each set of summary statistics, the SNP-specific sample size information was

used. If not available, we assumed that all SNPs had the same sample size for that trait,
defined as the total sample size for continuous phenotypes or as the sum of cases and controls
for case/control phenotypes. By default, LDSC also removed variants that were duplicate,
strand-ambiguous, not SNPs (e.g. indels), with p-values not between 0 and 1, with alleles that
did not match with the 1000G reference panel, and with low effective sample size or not
included in all studies of a GWAS meta-analysis (if such information was available) for traits
with no effective sample size information. After estimation of the genetic correlation across
all phenotypes, we corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini and
Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR).31 FDR-corrected p-values <0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Mendelian randomization analyses
Genetic variants used as instrumental variables
Genetic variants were selected based on associations with critical Covid-19. In our main
analysis, we selected uncorrelated genetic variants (clumped at correlation threshold r2<0.01)
at p-value<5x10-6. In sensitivity analyses, we applied a more stringent threshold and
considered only genome-wide significant genetic variants (p-value<5x10-8).
Main analysis
For CVD outcomes that showed evidence of genetic correlation with critical Covid-19 in
LDSC, MR analysis was performed to estimate the association of genetically predicted
liability to critical Covid-19 with that outcome using the random effects two-sample inversevariance weighted (IVW) method.32 The IVW estimate can be biased by pleiotropy when a
genetic variant associates the outcome (e.g., ischemic stroke) via a pathway other than
through the exposure (i.e., liability to critical Covid-19). Pleiotropy can cause heterogeneity
in the MR estimates obtained by different variants employed as instruments, which was

assessed using the Q-statistic and the respective heterogeneity p-value.33 A Mendelian
randomization estimate with p-value<0.05 for the main IVW analysis was deemed to
represent supportive evidence, given that MR was only performed to follow up positive
LDSC findings.
Sensitivity Analyses
We performed sensitivity analyses with pleiotropy-robust two-sample summary-level MR
approaches, including the weighted median MR34 and MR-Egger35 to compare the MR
estimates between different MR models. Each of these methods provides a statistically
consistent estimator of the true causal estimate under different assumptions. The intercept of
the MR-Egger model represents a test for directional pleiotropy and we included this in
sensitivity analyses.35
Pleiotropic pathways – inflammation and cardiometabolic risk factors
We further performed multivariable MR to adjust for potential pleiotropic pathways via
cardiometabolic risk factors that are known to affect risk of both Covid-19 and CVD,12
including obesity (BMI),26 lifetime smoking index,27 and chronic inflammation (estimated
using CRP). Multivariable MR includes all the respective genetic associations in a joint
model to account for genetic confounding.36 While univariable MR measures the total
estimate of an exposure, multivariable MR measures the direct estimate of the exposure
independent of other risk factors (i.e. pleiotropy or genetic confounders) in the model.37 In
the multivariable MR model, we selected instruments based on the primary exposure of
critical Covid-19. We compared the multivariable MR model with the univariable MR model
using likelihood ratio test to evaluate if accounting for the pleiotropic pathway provides a
better model fit than the univariable MR model.

Bidirectional MR
For CVD outcomes that showed evidence of genetic correlation with critical Covid-19 in
LDSC, bidirectional MR was also performed to investigate for any association of genetic
liability to that CVD outcome with risk of critical Covid-19. Uncorrelated genetic variants
(r2<0.01) associated with the CVD outcome at a p-value <5 x10-6 were selected as
instruments.
MR estimates are expressed as odds ratios (OR) per unit increase in the logOR of the
exposure for binary traits. All analyses were performed using the ieugwasr (version 0.1.5)
and MendelianRandomization (version 0.5.0) R packages.38

Results
LD score regression
Performing LDSC, we found evidence of genetic correlation between critical Covid-19 and
ischemic stroke (rg=0.29, FDR-p-value=4.65x10-3) (Figure 1). Critical Covid-19 was also
genetically correlated with BMI (rg=0.21, FDR-p-value=6.26x10-6) and CRP (rg=0.20, FDRp-value=1.35x10-4)). We did not observe evidence for genetic correlation between critical
Covid-19 and the CVD outcomes (Supplementary Table 2), and therefore focused the
consequent MR analysis only on ischemic stroke and its subtypes.
Mendelian randomization
We selected 31 uncorrelated genetic variants as instrumental variables for liability to critical
Covid-19. These are detailed in Supplementary Table 3, along with their associations with
ischemic stroke and its subtypes. MR estimates are presented in Figure 2. In a univariable
MR analysis, genetically proxied liability to critical Covid-19 was associated with all-cause
ischemic stroke (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.06, p-value=0.03). Restricting to ischemic stroke
subtypes, there were similar MR estimates for cardioembolic stroke (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01

to 1.12, p-value=0.03), large artery stroke (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.14, p-value=0.06) and
small-vessel stroke (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11, p-value=0.06). For the MR estimates
generated by different variants, we observed heterogeneity greater than would be expected by
chance only for cardioembolic stroke (heterogeneity p-value=0.049), but none of the other
considered ischemic stroke categories.
Mendelian randomization sensitivity analyses
Diagnostic scatterplots for ischemic stroke outcomes are presented in Supplementary Figure
1. We observed consistent MR estimates for ischemic stroke risk in sensitivity analyses based
on pleiotropy-robust approaches as in the main analysis and none of the intercept estimates of
MR-Egger suggested directional pleiotropy (Supplementary Table 4). In multivariable MR
to investigate potential pleiotropy through risk factors common to both Covid-19 and CVD,
there was little evidence for attenuation of the size of the estimate in any of these analyses
(Supplementary Figure 2), which was confirmed by likelihood ratio test, (Supplementary
Table 5).
Sensitivity analysis based on genome-wide significant genetic variants
As an additional sensitivity analysis, we used a more stringent p-value threshold based on
genome-wide significance to select genetic variants as instrumental variables. We identified 9
uncorrelated genetic variants that associated with critical Covid-19 at genome-wide
significance (p-value <5x10-8). This MR analysis based on fewer variants generated
consistent estimates to the main analysis, but with wider confidence intervals that crossed the
null, reflective of lower statistical power. Results are displayed in Supplementary Figure 3.
Comparison with other Covid-19 definitions
We further considered other Covid-19 definitions (Supplementary Figure 4 and
Supplementary Table 6). Genetically predicted Covid-19 requiring hospitalization as

compared to not requiring hospitalization was associated with increased risk of any ischemic
stroke (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.10, p-value=0.01) and small-vessel stroke (OR 1.22, 95%
CI 1.11 to 1.34, p-value=5.5×10-5). Considering reported Covid-19 (laboratory confirmed,
physician-reported or self-reported) versus controls from the general population, this was
associated with increased risk of any ischemic stroke (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.26, pvalue=0.04) and large artery stroke (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.81, p-value=4.2×10-4).
Bidirectional MR
There was no strong evidence to support that genetic liability to any of the considered
ischemic stroke outcomes was associated with increased risk of critical Covid-19, as
illustrated in Figure 3.

Discussion
In this study, we used cross-trait LDSC to explore the genetic correlation of critical Covid-19
with ischemic stroke, other CVD outcomes, and risk factors common to both. We identified a
genetic correlation between critical Covid-19 and ischemic stroke, and performed MR
analyses that found genetic liability to critical Covid-19 to be associated with increased risk
of ischemic stroke. Notably, there was no evidence to support that these associations were
attributable to shared risk factors, such as obesity, smoking and chronic inflammation.
Furthermore, there was no MR evidence that genetic liability to ischemic stroke increases risk
of critical Covid-19.
To date, studies assessing the incidence of ischemic stroke during the Covid-19 pandemic
have produced contrasting findings. On one hand, some studies demonstrate that the
likelihood of stroke is seven-fold higher in people with Covid-19 than with influenza,3 that
Covid-19 is associated with 21-fold increased odds of in-hospital stroke compared to patients
without Covid-19,6 and that stroke is the most common neurological/neuropsychiatric

complication of Covid-19.4 On the contrary, other studies have demonstrated a reduced rate
of hospital admissions with stroke during the first wave of the pandemic compared to one
year before.9 Two main hypotheses have been proposed as explanations for these contrasting
findings. The first is that the incidence of stroke declined during the first wave of the
pandemic and that Covid-19 is not mechanistically associated with stroke, and the second is
that the observed reduction in stroke presentations was due to a higher proportion of people
with mild strokes not reaching stroke services.11,

39

We have leveraged large-scale genetic

data to identify that liability to critical Covid-19 is associated with increased risk of ischemic
stroke. This is consistent with the host response in Covid-19 contributing to increased
ischemic stroke risk. Mechanisms that increase risk of ischemic stroke in patients with Covid19 are complex,5, 15 and include systemic inflammation and endotheliopathy.15, 40-42 Covid-19
can trigger a cytokine storm with upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6.15
Endothelial inflammation can induce a microvascular and macrovascular endotheliopathy
that contributes to a pro-thrombotic state.15, 40
While prophylactic low molecular weight heparin is used to prevent thromboembolism in
patients with Covid-19, more targeted approaches to prevent strokes are yet undefined.5, 43
Moreover, the REMAP-CAP, ACTIV-4 and ATTACC trials have recently reported that
therapeutic doses of anticoagulation do not improve clinical outcome and may increase
bleeding for people with Covid-19 in the critical care setting. Previous work using an MR
approach anticipated a beneficial effect of IL-6 receptor inhibition on both risk of ischemic
stroke and severe Covid-19.44, 45 More recently, clinical trials have demonstrated that IL-6
receptor inhibition can improve outcomes in patients hospitalized with Covid-19.46 Targeting
the deleterious host immune response through similar approaches may also help to reduce the

Our findings also support the hypothesis that few patients with minor strokes reached stroke
services during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.11 This is reinforced by data that
demonstrate the reduction in stroke admissions observed in some centers during the first
wave of the pandemic was driven mainly by a reduction in presentations with minor stroke
syndromes.11 People with minor stroke are at high risk of early recurrence47 and public health
messaging should encourage people to attend stroke services if they have any symptom of
stroke during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Our current study has strengths. We have made efficient use of existing large-scale data
resources to address an important clinical issue in the context of the rapidly evolving global
pandemic. A key strength of MR analysis is the use of randomly allocated genetic variants to
help overcome environmental confounding, which is analogous to randomization of treatment
allocation in clinical trials. This has helped to overcome some of the limitations of previous
observational studies (either retrospective or cross-sectional) assessing the relationship
between Covid-19 and ischemic stroke.3-6
Our work also has limitations. A series of modelling assumptions are made when using MR,
in particular, that the genetic variants do not affect the considered outcomes through
pathways independent of the exposure. While this can never be completely excluded, we
employed methods that are robust to genetic confounding (pleiotropy) in a series of
sensitivity analyses (including pleiotropy-robust MR methods and accounting for measured
pleiotropy using multivariable MR) and the estimates were consistent with our main analyses.
We cannot be certain that genetic associations with liability to critical Covid-19 accurately
reflect the pathophysiological process that actually occurs during critical Covid-19. For
example, while genetic predisposition may place an individual at increased liability to critical

Covid-19, it is not possible to determine from our analyses whether that factor is involved in
the pathophysiological response to Covid-19.
In conclusion, we have found genetic evidence that liability to critical Covid-19 is associated
with increased risk of ischemic stroke. Our results are consistent with the host response in
critical Covid-19 underlying this relationship, and support the evaluation of strategies to
mitigate this.
