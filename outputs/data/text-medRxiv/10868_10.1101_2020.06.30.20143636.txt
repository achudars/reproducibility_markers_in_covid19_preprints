he SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused significant mortality and morbidity worldwide, sparing almost no community. As the disease will
likely remain a threat for years to come, an understanding of the precise influences of human demographics and settlement, as well as the dynamic factors of climate, susceptible depletion, and intervention, on the spread of localized epidemics will be
vital for mounting an effective response. We consider the entire set of local epidemics in the United
States; a broad selection of demographic, population density, and climate factors; and local mobility data, tracking social distancing interventions, to
determine the key factors driving the spread and
containment of the virus. Assuming first a linear
model for the rate of exponential growth (or decay)

in cases/mortality, we find that population-weighted
density, humidity, and median age dominate the dynamics of growth and decline, once interventions
are accounted for. A focus on distinct metropolitan areas suggests that some locales benefited from
the timing of a nearly simultaneous nationwide shutdown, and/or the regional climate conditions in midMarch; while others suffered significant outbreaks
prior to intervention. Using a first-principles model
of the infection spread, we then develop predictions
for the impact of the relaxation of social distancing and local climate conditions. A few regions,
where a significant fraction of the population was
infected, show evidence that the epidemic has partially resolved via depletion of the susceptible population (i.e., “herd immunity”), while most regions

Introduction
The new human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in
Wuhan Province, China in December 2019 (Chen et al.,
2020; Li et al., 2020), reaching 10,000 confirmed cases
and 200 deaths due to the disease (known as COVID-19)
by the end of January this year. Although travel from
China was halted by late-January, dozens of known introductions of the virus to North America occurred prior to
that (Holshue et al., 2020; Kucharski et al., 2020), and
dozens more known cases were imported to the US and
Canada during February from Europe, the Middle East,
and elsewhere. Community transmission of unknown
origin was first detected in California on February 26, followed quickly by Washington State (Chu et al., 2020b),
Illinois and Florida, but only on March 7 in New York City.
Retrospective genomic analyses have demonstrated that
case-tracing and self-quarantine efforts were effective in
preventing most known imported cases from propagating (Ladner et al., 2020; Gonzalez-Reiche et al., 2020;
Worobey et al., 2020), but that the eventual outbreaks on
the West Coast (Worobey et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2020b;
Deng et al., 2020) and New York (Gonzalez-Reiche et
al., 2020) were likely seeded by unknown imports in
mid-February. By early March, cross-country spread was
primarily due to interstate travel rather than international imports (Fauver et al., 2020).
In mid-March 2020, nearly every region of the country saw a period of uniform exponential growth in daily
confirmed cases — signifying robust community transmission — followed by a plateau in late March, likely
due to social mobility reduction. The same qualitative dynamics were seen in COVID-19 mortality counts, delayed
by approximately one week. Although the qualitative
picture was similar across locales, the quantitative aspects of localized epidemics — including initial rate of
growth, infections/deaths per capita, duration of plateau,
and rapidity of resolution —were quite diverse across
the country. Understanding the origins of this diversity
will be key to predicting how the relaxation of social
distancing, annual changes in weather, and static local
demographic/population characteristics will affect the
resolution of the first wave of cases, and will drive coming
waves, prior to the availability of a vaccine.
The exponential growth rate of a spreading epidemic
is dependent on the biological features of the virus-host
ecosystem — including the incubation time, susceptibility of target cells to infection, and persistence of the
virus particle outside of the host — but, through its de-

pendence on the transmission rate between hosts, it is
also a function of external factors such as population
density, air humidity, and the fraction of hosts that are
susceptible. Initial studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2
has a larger rate of exponential growth (or, alternatively,
a lower doubling time of cases1 ) than many other circulating human viruses (Park et al., 2020). For comparison,
the pandemic influenza of 2009, which also met a largely
immunologically-naive population, had a doubling time
of 5–10d (Yu et al., 2012; Storms et al., 2013), while that
of SARS-CoV-2 has been estimated at 2–5d (Sanche et al.,
2020; Oliveiros et al., 2020) (growth rates of ∼ 0.10d−1
vs. ∼ 0.25d−1 ). It is not yet understood which factors
contribute to this high level of infectiousness.
While the dynamics of an epidemic (e.g., cases over
time) must be described by numerical solutions to nonlinear models, the exponential growth rate, λ, usually has
a simpler dependence on external factors. Unlike case
or mortality incidence numbers, the growth rate does
not scale with population size. It is a directly measurable
quantity from the available incidence data, unlike, e.g.,
the reproduction number, which requires knowledge of
the serial interval distribution (Wallinga and Lipsitch,
2007; Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007; Dushoff and Park,
2020), something that is difficult to determine empirically (Champredon and Dushoff, 2015; Nishiura, 2010).
Yet, the growth rate contains the same threshold as the
reproduction number (λ = 0 vs. R0 = 1), between a
spreading epidemic (or an unstable uninfected equilibrium) and a contracting one (or an equilibrium that is
resistant to flare-ups). Thus, the growth rate is an informative direct measure on that space of underlying
parameters.
In this work, we leverage the enormous data set of
epidemics across the United States to evaluate the impact of demographics, population density and structure,
weather, and non-pharmaceutical interventions (i.e., mobility restrictions) on the exponential rate of growth of
COVID-19. Following a brief analysis of the initial spread
in metropolitan regions, we expand the meaning of the
exponential rate to encompass all aspects of a local epidemic — including growth, plateau and decline — and
use it as a tracer of the dynamics, where its time dependence and geographic variation are dictated solely by
these external variables and per capita cumulative mortality. Finally, we use the results of that linear analysis
to calibrate a new nonlinear model — a renewal equation that utilizes the excursion probability of a random
walk to determine the incubation period — from which
we develop local predictions about the impact of social
mobility relaxation, the level of herd immunity, and the
potential of rebound epidemics in the Summer and Fall.

doubling time is ln 2 divided by the exponential growth rate.

Diverse local epidemics reveal the distinct effects of population density, demographics, climate, depletion of susceptibles,
and intervention in the first wave of COVID-19 in the United States

Results

Exponential growth rate of mortality as a
dynamical, pan-epidemic, measure

Initial growth of cases in metropolitan regions is exponential with rate depending on mobility, population, demographics,
and humidity

In the remainder of this report, we consider the exponential rate of growth (or decay) in local confirmed deaths
due to COVID-19. The statistics of mortality is poorer
compared to reported cases, but it is much less dependent on unknown factors such as the criteria for testing,
local policies, test kit availability, and asymptomatic individuals (Pearce et al., 2020). Although there is clear
evidence that a large fraction of COVID-19 mortality
is missed in the official counts (e.g., Leon et al., 2020;
Modi et al., 2020), mortality is likely less susceptible to
rapid changes in reporting, and, as long as the number
of reported deaths is a monotonic function of the actual
number of deaths (e.g., a constant fraction, say 50%), the
sign of the exponential growth rate will be unchanged,
which is the crucial measure of the success in pandemic
management.
To minimize the impact of weekly changes, such
as weekend reporting lulls, data dumps, and mobility
changes from working days to weekends, we calculate
the regression of ln [Mortality] over a 14-day interval,
and assign this value, λ14 (t), and its standard error to
the last day of the interval. Since only the data for distinct 2-week periods√are independent, we multiply the
regression errors by 14 to account for correlations between the daily estimates. Together with a “rolling average” of the mortality, this time-dependent measure of
the exponential growth rate provides, at any day, the
most up-to-date information on the progression of the
epidemic (Figure 2).
In the following section, we consider a linear fit to
λ14 , to determine the statistically-significant external
(non-biological) factors influencing the dynamics of local
exponential growth and decline of the epidemic. We
then develop a first-principles model for λ14 that allows
for extrapolation of these dependencies to predict the
impact of future changes in social mobility and climate.

As an initial look at COVID-19’s arrival in the United
States, we considered the ∼100 most populous metropolitan regions — using maps of population density to select
compact sets of counties representing each region (see
Supplementary Material) — and estimated the initial
exponential growth rate of cases in each region. We
performed a linear regression to a large set of demographic (sex, age, race) and population variables, along
with weather and social mobility (Fitzpatrick and Karen,
2020) preceding the period of growth (Figure 1). In the
best fit model (R2 = 0.75, BIC = −183), the baseline
value of the initial growth rate was λ = 0.21d−1 (doubling time of 3.3d), with average mobility two weeks
prior to growth being the most significant factor (Figure
1B). Of all variables considered, only four others were significant: population density (including both populationweighted density (PWD) — also called the “lived population density” because it estimates the density for the
average individual (Craig, 1985)— and population sparsity, γ, a measure of the difference between PWD and
standard population density, see Methods), p < 0.001
and p = 0.006; specific humidity two weeks prior to
growth, p = 0.001; and median age, p = 0.04.
While mobility reduction certainly caused the “flattening” of case incidence in every region by late-March, our
results show (Figure 1C) that it likely played a key role in
reducing the rate of growth in Boston, Washington, DC,
and Los Angeles, but was too late, with respect to the
sudden appearance of the epidemic, to have such an effect in, e.g., Detroit and Cleveland. In the most extreme
example, Grand Rapids, MI, seems to have benefited
from a late arriving epidemic, such that its growth (with
a long doubling time of 7d) occurred almost entirely
post-lockdown.
Specific humidity, a measure of absolute humidity, has
been previously shown to be inversely correlated with respiratory virus transmission (Lowen et al., 2007; Shaman
and Kohn, 2009; Shaman, Goldstein, and Lipsitch, 2011;
Kudo et al., 2019). Here, we found it to be a significant
factor, but weaker than population density and mobility
(Figure 1C). It could be argued that Dallas, Los Angeles,
and Atlanta saw a small benefit from higher humidity
at the time of the epidemic’s arrival, while the dry latewinter conditions in the Midwest and Northeast were
more favorable to rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

We considered a spatio-temporal dataset containing 3933
estimates of the exponential growth measure, λ14 , covering the three month period of 8 March 2020 – 8 June
2020 in the 187 US counties for which information on
COVID-19 mortality and all potential driving factors, below, were available (the main barrier was social mobility
information, which limited us to a set of counties that
included 69% of US mortality). A joint, simultaneous,

Diverse local epidemics reveal the distinct effects of population density, demographics, climate, depletion of susceptibles,
and intervention in the first wave of COVID-19 in the United States

linear fit of these data to 12 potential driving factors (Table 1) revealed only 7 factors with independent statistical
significance. Re-fitting only to these variables returned
the optimal fit for the considered factors (BIC = −5951;
R2 = 0.674).
We found, not surprisingly, that higher population
density, median age, and social mobility correlated with
positive exponential growth, while population sparsity,
specific humidity, and susceptible depletion correlated
with exponentially declining mortality. Notably the coefficients for each of these quantities was in the 95%
confidence intervals of those found in the analysis of
metropolitan regions (and vice versa). Possibly the
most surprising dependency was the negative correlation, at ' −3.7σ between λ14 and the total number of
annual deaths in the county. In fact, this correlation
was marginally more significant than a correlation with
log(population), which was −3.3σ. One possible interpretation of this negative correlation is that the number
of annual death is a proxy for the number of potential
outbreak clusters. The larger the number of clusters, the
longer it might take for the epidemic to spread across
their network, which would (at least initially) slow down
the onset of the epidemic.

Nonlinear model
To obtain more predictive results, we developed a mechanistic nonlinear model for infection (see Supplementary
Material for details). We followed the standard analogy
to chemical reaction kinetics (infection rate is proportional to the product of susceptible and infectious densities), but defined the generation interval (approximately
the incubation period) through the excursion probability
in a 1D random walk, modulated by an exponential rate
of exit from the infected class. This approach resulted in
a renewal equation (Heesterbeek and Dietz, 1996; Champredon and Dushoff, 2015; Champredon, Dushoff, and
Earn, 2018), with a distribution of generation intervals
that is more realistic than that of standard SIR/SEIR
models, and which could be solved formally (in terms of
the Lambert W function) for the growth rate in terms of
the infection parameters:

The model has four key dependencies, which we describe here, along with our assumptions about their own
dependence on population, demographic, and climate
variables. As mortality (on which our estimate of growth
rate is based) lags infection (on which the renewal equation is based), we imposed a fixed time shift of ∆t for
time-dependent variables:

1. We assumed that the susceptible population, which
feeds new infections and drives the growth, is actually a sub-population of the community, consisting
of highly-mobile and frequently interacting individuals, and that most deaths occurred in separate subpopulation of largely immobile non-interacting individuals. Under these assumptions, we found (see
Supp. Mat.) that the susceptible density, S(t), could
be estimated from the cumulative per capita death
fraction, fD , as:
S(t−∆t) = S(0) exp [−CD fD (t)]

(fD = Dtot /N ) ,

where Dtot is the cumulative mortality count, N
is the initial population, and the initial density is
S(0) = k PWD.
2. We assumed that the logarithm of the “rate constant”
for infection, β, depended linearly on social mobility,
m, specific humidity, h, population sparsity, γ, and
total annual death, AD , as:
ln [β (M, H, γ, AD )] = ln [β0 ]


+ CM M − M̄ + CH H − H̄

+ Cγ (γ − γ̄) + CAD AD − ĀD

(2)

where a barred variable represents the (populationweighted) average value over all US counties, and
where the mobility and humidity factors were timeshifted with respect to the growth rate estimation
window: M = m (t − ∆t) and H = h (t − ∆t).
3. The characteristic time scale to infectiousness, τ , is
intrinsic to the biology and therefore we assumed it
would depend only on the median age of the population, A. We assumed a power law dependence:
 CA
A
τ = τ0
(3)
A0
where we fixed the pivot age, A0 , to minimize the
error in τ0 .
4. The exponential rate of exit from the infected class,
d, was assumed constant, since we found no significant dependence for it on other factors in our
analysis of US mortality. From the properties of
the Lambert W function, when the infection rate
or susceptibility density approach zero — through
mobility restrictions or susceptible depletion — the
growth rate will tend to λ ≈ −d, its minimum value.
With these parameterizations, we performed a nonlinear regression to λ14 (t) using the entire set of US county
mortality incidence time series (Table 2). Compared to
the linear model of the previous section (Table 1b), the fit
improved by 7.6σ (BIC = −6008 ; R2 = 0.724), despite
both having 9 free parameters. Through the estimated
parameter values, the model makes predictions for an

Diverse local epidemics reveal the distinct effects of population density, demographics, climate, depletion of susceptibles,
and intervention in the first wave of COVID-19 in the United States

individual’s probability of becoming infectious, and the
distributions of incubation period and generation interval, all as a function of the median age of the population
(see Supplementary Material).
The model was very well fit to the mortality growth
rate measurements for counties with a high mortality
(Figure 3). More quantitatively, the scatter of measured
growth rates around the best-fit model predictions was
(on average) only 13% larger than the measurement
errors, independent of the population of the county 2 .
Importantly, when the model was calibrated on only
a subset of the data — e.g., all but the final month for
which mobility data is available — its 68% confidence
prediction for the remaining data was accurate (Figure 4)
given the known mobility and weather data for that final
month. This suggests that the model, once calibrated
on the first wave of COVID-19 infections, can make reliable predictions about the ongoing epidemic, and future
waves, in the United States.

Predictions for relaxed mobility restrictions, the onset of summer, and the potential second wave
Possibly the most pressing question for the management
of COVID-19 in a particular community is the combination of circumstances at which the virus fails to propagate, i.e., at which the growth rate, estimated here by
λ14 , becomes negative (or, equivalently, the reproduction
number Rt falls below one). In the absence of mobility restrictions this is informally called the threshold for
“herd immunity,” which is usually achieved by mass vaccination (e.g., John and Samuel, 2000; Fine, Eames, and
Heymann, 2011). Without a vaccine, however, ongoing
infections and death will deplete the susceptible population and thus decrease transmission. Varying the parameters of the nonlinear model individually about their
Spring 2020 population-weighted mean values (Figure 5)
suggests that this threshold will be very much dependent
on the specific demographics, geography, and weather in
the community, but it also shows that reductions in social
mobility can significantly reduce transmission prior the
onset of herd immunity.
To determine the threshold for herd immunity in the
absence or presence of social mobility restrictions, we
considered the “average US county” (i.e., a region with
population-weighted average characteristics), and examined the dependence of the growth rate on the cumulative
mortality. We found that in the absence of social distancing, a COVID-19 mortality rate of 0.13% (or 1300 per
million population) would bring the growth rate to zero.
However, changing the population density of this average
2 See Supplementary Material for more detailed discussion of Error
Diagnostics.

county shows that the threshold can vary widely (Figure
5).
Examination of specific counties showed that the mortality level corresponding to herd immunity varies from
10 to 2500 per million people (Figure 9). At the current levels of reported COVID-19 mortality, we found
that, as of June 22nd, 2020, only 128 ± 55 out of 3142
counties (inhabiting 9.4 ± 2.1% of US population) have
surpassed this threshold at 68% confidence level (Figure
8). Notably, New York City, with the highest reported
per capita mortality (2700 per million) has achieved
mobility-independent herd immunity at the 10σ confidence level, according to the model (Figure 6). A few
other large-population counties in New England, New
Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana, Georgia and Mississippi that
have been hard hit by the pandemic also appear to be at
or close to the herd immunity threshold. This is not the
case for most of the United States, however (Figure 8).
Nationwide, we predict that COVID-19 herd immunity
would only occur after a death toll of 340, 000 ± 61, 000,
or 1058 ± 190 per million of population.
We found that the approach to the herd immunity
threshold is not direct, and that social mobility restrictions and other non-pharmaceutical interventions must
be applied carefully to avoid excess mortality beyond the
threshold. In the absence of social distancing interventions, a typical epidemic will “overshoot” the herd immunity limit (e.g., Handel, Longini Jr, and Antia, 2007;
Fung, Antia, and Handel, 2012) by up to 300%, due to
ongoing infections (Figure 6). At the other extreme, a
very strict “shelter in place” order would simply delay
the onset of the epidemic; but if lifted (see Figures 6
and 7), the epidemic would again overshoot the herd
immunity threshold. A modest level of social distancing,
however — e.g., a 33% mobility reduction for the average
US county — could lead to fatalities “only” at the level
of herd immunity. Naturally, communities with higher
population density or other risk factors (see Figure 5),
would require more extreme measures to achieve the
same.
Avoiding the level of mortality required for herd
immunity will require long-lasting and effective nonpharmaceutical options, until a vaccine is available. The
universal use of face masks has been suggested for
reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with a recent meta-analysis (Chu et al., 2020a) suggesting that
masks can suppress the rate of infection by a factor of
0.07–0.34 (95% CI), or equivalently ∆ ln(transmission)
= −1.9 ± 0.4 (at 1σ). Using our model’s dependence
of the infection rate constant on mobility, this would
correspond to an equivalent social mobility reduction of
∆M̄mask ' −24% ± 9%. Warmer, more humid weather
has also considered a factor that could slow the epidemic (e.g., Wang et al., 2020a; Notari, 2020; Xu et

Figure 4: Forecasts of COVID-19 mortality (orange) — based on the best-fit nonlinear model to data prior to May 16th, 2020 —
versus actual reported mortality (blue) for 4 large US counties. The 68% confidence range (orange regions) were determined
from 100 random 60-day long simulations (see Supplementary Methods). The vertical red lines indicate June 21st. Forecasts
for most US counties can be found at our online dashboard: https://wolfr.am/COVID19Dash

al., 2020a). Annual changes in specific humidity are
∆H̄ ' 6 g/kg (Figure 10b in Supplementary Material),
which can be translated in our model to an effective mobility decrease of ∆M̄summer ' −12% ± 5%. Combining
these two effects could, in this simple analysis, yield
a modestly effective defense for the summer months:
∆M̄mask+summer ' −37% ± 10%. Therefore, this could
be a reasonable strategy for most communities to manage the COVID-19 epidemic at the aforementioned -33%
level of mobility needed to arrive at herd immunity with
the least excess death. More stringent measures would
be required to keep mortality below that level. Of course,
this general prescription would need to be fine-tuned for
the specific conditions of each community.

Discussion and Conclusions
By simultaneously considering the time series of mortality incidence in every US county, and controlling for the
time-varying effects of local social distancing interventions, we demonstrated for the first time a dependence of
the epidemic growth of COVID-19 on population density,
as well as other climate, demographic, and population
factors. We further constructed a realistic, but simple,
first-principles model of infection transmission that allowed us to extend our heuristic linear model of the

dataset into a predictive nonlinear model, which provided a better fit to the data (with the same number of
parameters), and which also accurately predicted latetime data after training on only an earlier portion of the
data set. This suggests that the model is well-calibrated
to predict future incidence of COVID-19, given realistic
predictions/assumptions of future intervention and climate factors. We summarized some of these predictions
in the final section of Results, notably that only a small
fraction of US counties (with less than ten percent of
the population) seem to have reached the level of herd
immunity, and that relaxation of mobility restrictions
without counter-measures (e.g., universal mask usage)
will likely lead to increased daily mortality rates, beyond
that seen in the Spring of 2020.
In any epidemiological model, the infection rate of a
disease is assumed proportional to population density
(Jong, Diekmann, and Heesterbeek, 1995), but, to our
knowledge, its explicit effect in a real-world respiratory
virus epidemic has not been demonstrated. The universal reach of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the diversity
of communities affected have provided an opportunity
to verify this dependence. Indeed, as we show here,
it must be accounted for to see the effects of weaker
drivers, such as weather and demographics. A recent
study of COVID-19 in the United States, working with
a similar dataset, saw no significant effect due to popPage 9 of 28

Figure 6: Nonlinear model prediction of the exponential growth rate, λ14 , vs. cumulative COVID-19 mortality (top panels), assuming
baseline social mobility, M̄ = 0, in the “average US county” (see caption of Figure 5) on the left, and New York City, on
the right. The curves show 68% predictions for the nonlinear model (Table 2), while the points with errorbars are linear
fits to all the data within bins of death fraction. The threshold for “herd immunity” (λ14 = 0) is reached at a mortality
of approximately 1300 (1700) per million for an average county (NYC), but this would be higher in counties with more
unfavorable values of the drivers. The eventual mortality burden of the average county will be determined by its path through
a “phase space” of Daily vs. Total Mortality (bottom panel). An epidemic without intervention (red curves, with the particular
trajectory starting at zero death shown in bold) will pass the threshold for herd immunity (1300 deaths per million; note
that at zero daily deaths this is a fixed point) and continue to three times that value due to ongoing infections. A modest 33%
reduction in social mobility (blue curves), however, leads to mortality at “only” the herd immunity level (the green disk). The
black curve on the bottom right panel shows the 7-day rolling average of reported mortality for NYC, which appears to have
“overshot” the “herd immunity threshold”.

ulation density (Hamidi, Sabouri, and Ewing, 2020),
but our analysis differs in a number of important ways.
First, we have taken a dynamic approach, evaluating
the time-dependence of the growth rate of mortality incidence, rather than a single static measure for each county,
which allowed us to account for the changing effects of
weather, mobility, and the density of susceptible individuals. Second, we have included an explicit and real-time
measurement of social mobility, i.e., cell phone mobility
data provided by Google (Fitzpatrick and Karen, 2020),
allowing us to control for the dominant effect of intervention. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we calculate
for each county an estimate of the “lived” population density, called the population-weighted population density
(PWD) (Craig, 1985), which is more meaningful than
the standard population per political area. As with any
population-scale measure, this serves as a proxy — here,
for estimating the average rate of encounters between
infectious and susceptible people — but we believe that
PWD is a better proxy than standard population density,
and it is becoming more prevalent, e.g., in census work
(Dorling and Atkins, 1995; Wilson, 2012).
We also found a significant dependence of the mortality growth rate on specific humidity (although since
temperature and humidity were highly correlated, a replacement with temperature was approximately equivalent), indicating that the disease spread more rapidly in
drier (cooler) regions. There is a large body of research

on the effects of temperature and humidity on the transmission of other respiratory viruses (Moriyama, Hugentobler, and Iwasaki, 2020; Kudo et al., 2019), specifically
influenza (Barreca and Shimshack, 2012). Influenza
was found to transmit more efficiently between guinea
pigs in low relative-humidity and temperature conditions
(Lowen et al., 2007), although re-analysis of this work
pointed to absolute humidity (e.g., specific humidity)
as the ultimate controller of transmission (Shaman and
Kohn, 2009) . Although the mechanistic origin of humidity’s role has not been completely clarified, theory
and experiments have suggested a snowballing effect
on small respiratory droplets that cause them to drop
more quickly in high-humidity conditions (Tellier, 2009;
Noti et al., 2013; Marr et al., 2019), along with a role
for evaporation and the environmental stability of virus
particles (Morawska, 2005; Marr et al., 2019). It has
also been shown that the onset of the influenza season
(Shaman et al., 2010; Shaman, Goldstein, and Lipsitch,
2011) — which generally occurs between late-Fall and
early-Spring, but is usually quite sharply peaked for a
given strain (H1N1, H3N2, or Influenza B) — and its
mortality (Barreca and Shimshack, 2012) are linked to
drops in absolute humidity. It is thought that humidity
or temperature could be the annual periodic driver in
the resonance effect causing these acute seasonal outbreaks of influenza (Dushoff et al., 2004; Tamerius et
al., 2011), although other influences, such as school

openings/closings have also been implicated (Earn et
al., 2012). While little is yet known about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 specifically, other coronaviruses
are known to be seasonal (Moriyama, Hugentobler, and
Iwasaki, 2020; Neher et al., 2020), and there have been
some preliminary reports of a dependence on weather
factors (Xu et al., 2020b; Schell et al., 2020). We believe
that our results represent the most definitive evidence
yet for the role of weather, but emphasize that it is a
weak, secondary driver, especially in the early stages
of this pandemic where the susceptible fraction of the
population remains large (Baker et al., 2020). Indeed,
the current early-summer rebound of COVID-19 in the
relatively dry and hot regions of the Southwest suggests
that the disease spread will not soon be controlled by
seasonality.
We developed a new model of infection in the framework of a renewal equation (see, e.g., Champredon,
Dushoff, and Earn, 2018 and references therein), which
we could formally solve for the exponential growth rate.
The incubation period in the model was determined by
a random walk through the stages of infection, yielding
a non-exponential distribution of the generation interval, thus imposing more realistic delays to infectiousness
than, e.g., the standard SEIR model. In this formulation,
we did not make the standard compartmental model assumption that the infection of an individual induces an
autonomous, sequential passage from exposure, to infectiousness, to recovery or death; indeed, the model does
not explicitly account for recovered or dead individuals.
This freedom allows for, e.g., a back passage from infectious to noninfectious (via the underlying random walk)
and a variable rate of recovery or death. We assumed
only that the exponential growth in mortality incidence
matched (with delay) that of the infected incidence — the

primary dynamical quantity in the renewal approach —
and we let the cumulative dead count predict susceptible
density — the second dynamical variable in the renewal
approach — under the assumption that deaths arise from
a distinct subset of the population, with lower mobility
behavior than those that drive infection (see Supplementary Material). Therefore, we fitted the model to the
(rolling two-week estimates of the) COVID-19 mortality
incidence growth rate values, λ14 , for all counties and
all times, and used the per capita mortality averaged
over that period, fD , to determine susceptible density.
Regression to this nonlinear model was much improved
over linear regression, and, once calibrated on an early
portion of the county mortality incidence time series, the
model accurately predicted the remaining incidence.
Because we accounted for the precise effects of social mobility in fitting our model to the actual epidemic
growth and decline, we were then able to, on a county-bycounty basis, “turn off ” mobility restrictions and estimate
the level of cumulative mortality at which SARS-CoV-2
would fail to spread even without social distancing measures, i.e., we estimated the threshold for “herd immunity.” Meeting this threshold prior to the distribution of a
vaccine should not be a goal of any community, because it
implies substantial mortality, but the threshold is a useful
benchmark to evaluate the potential for local outbreaks
following the first wave of COVID-19 in Spring 2020.
We found that a few counties in the United States have
indeed reached herd immunity in this estimation — i.e.,
their predicted mortality growth rate, assuming baseline
mobility, was negative — including counties in the immediate vicinity of New York City, Detroit, New Orleans,
and Albany, Georgia. A number of other counties were
found to be at or close to the threshold, including much
of the greater New York City and Boston areas, and the
Four Corners, Navajo Nation, region in the Southwest.
All other regions were found to be far from the threshold for herd immunity, and therefore are susceptible to
ongoing or restarted outbreaks. These determinations
should be taken with caution, however. In this analysis,
we estimated that the remaining fraction of susceptible
individuals in the counties at or near the herd immunity
threshold was in the range of 0.001% to 5% (see Supplementary Materials). This is in strong tension with initial
seroprevalence studies (Rosenberg et al., 2020; Havers
et al., 2020a) which placed the fraction of immune individuals in New York City at 7% in late March and 20%
in late April, implying that perhaps 75% of that population remains susceptible today. We hypothesize that
the pool of susceptible individuals driving the epidemic
in our model is a subset of the total population — likely
those with the highest mobility and geographic reach —
while a different subset, with very low baseline mobility,
contributes most of the mortality (see Supplementary MaPage 14 of 28

Diverse local epidemics reveal the distinct effects of population density, demographics, climate, depletion of susceptibles,
and intervention in the first wave of COVID-19 in the United States

terial). Thus, the near total depletion of the susceptible
pool we see associated with herd immunity corresponds
to the highly-mobile subset, while the low-mobility subset could remain largely susceptible. One could explicitly
consider such factors of population heterogeneity in a
model — e.g., implementing a saturation of infectivity as
a proxy for a clustering effect (Capasso and Serio, 1978;
Mollison, 1985; De Boer, 2007; Farrell et al., 2019) —
but we found (in results not shown) that the introduction
of additional of parameters left portions of the model
unidentifiable. Despite these cautions, it is interesting
to note that the epidemic curves (mortality incidence
over time) for those counties that we have predicted an
approach to herd immunity are qualitatively different
than those we have not. Specifically, the exponential
rise in these counties is followed by a peak and a sharp
decline — rather than the flattening seen in most regions
— which is a typical feature of epidemic resolution by
susceptible depletion.

At the time of this writing, in early Summer 2020,
confirmed cases are again rising sharply in many locations across the United States — particularly in areas
of the South and West that were spared significant mortality in the Spring wave. The horizon for an effective
and fully-deployed vaccine still appears to be at least a
year away. Initial studies of neutralizing antibodies in
recovered COVID-19 patients, however, suggest a waning immune response after only 2–3 months, with 40%
of those that were asymptomatic becoming seronegative
in that time period (Long et al., 2020). Although the
antiviral remdesivir (Beigel et al., 2020; Grein et al.,
2020; Wang et al., 2020b) and the steroid Dexamethasone (Horby et al., 2020) have shown some promise in
treating COVID-19 patients, the action of remdesivir is
quite weak, and high-dose steroids can only be utilized
for the most critical cases. Therefore, the management
of this pandemic will likely require non-pharmaceutical
intervention — including universal social distancing and
mask-wearing, along with targeted closures of businesses
and community gathering places — for years in the future. The analysis and prescriptive guidance we have
presented here should help to target these approaches
to local communities, based on their particular demographic, geographic, and climate characteristics, and can
be facilitated through our online simulator dashboard.
Finally, although we have focused our analysis on the
United States, due to the convenience of a diverse and
voluminous data set, the method and results should be
applicable to any community worldwide, and we intend
to extend our analysis in forthcoming work.

Data & Methods
Datasets, Resources, Definitions
All data for cases and mortality, demographics, mobility, and weather were incorporated into the publiclyavailable Wolfram COVID-19 Dataset and the Wolfram|Alpha Knowledgebase (COVID-19 Data & Resources
2020). COVID-19 confirmed case and mortality data
were obtained from both the NYTimes and Johns Hopkins University Github repositories (Johns Hopkins University, CSSE, 2020; The New York Times, 2020); the
former was used for the analysis initial case data in
metropolitan regions, while the average of the two data
sets was used for all other analyses. In each case, daily
confirmed counts were utilized. Demographic data by
county, including people per household, estimated 2019
population, annual births, and annual deaths were obtained from the US Census 2019 County Population Estimates data set (United States Census, 2019a). Median ages were determined from the US Census 2018
County Characteristics Resident Population Estimates data
set (United States Census, 2018). For the Median Age,
Wolfram|Alpha has curated the raw data from United
States Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5-Year
Estimates: B01002, the Median Age By Sex, American
FactFinder; for the People per Household and Annual
Death, the source of curated data is United States Census
Bureau, State & County QuickFacts. County outline polygons were obtained from the US Census 2019 TIGER/Line
shapefiles database (United States Census, 2019c). Local
weather data (Figure 10 was obtained from the NOAO
Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) database
(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Observatory, 2020).
The nearest WBAN station with daily dew point and pressure values (for calculation of specific humidity), and
daily average temperature was chosen for each county or
metropolitan region. Weather data was averaged over a
two-week period for λ14 , and over a window equal to the
growth period for metropolitan regions. Google’s COVID19 Community Mobility Reports dataset (Fitzpatrick and
Karen, 2020), specifically “Workplace mobility,” was used
to estimate the human social mobility in each county
(Figure 10).
Population-weighted population density (or, population weighted density, PWD) (Craig, 1985; Wilson, 2012;
Dorling and Atkins, 1995), was calculated using the
Global Human Settlement Population raster dataset (European Commission Joint Research Centre, 2019), which
contains 250 m-resolution population values worldwide,
taken from census data. The value of PWD for a county —
or for a set of counties, in the metropolitan region analysis — was calculated as the population-weighted average

by political boundaries. To represent the degree to which
the population density changes across the region (county
or metropolitan region) we define the population sparsity
index, γ. Assuming that the population-weighted population density declines approximately as a power law
with “pixel” area, PWD√Area ∼ Area−γ , we define:

ranges from 0.09 (i.e., very uniform) for the most populous/dense counties to 0.88 (i.e. very sparse) for least
populated/dense counties. For reference, the value of γ

For each of the top 100 metropolitan regions (United
States Census, 2019b), a logarithmic-scale population
heat map, windowed from the full GHS-POP raster image,
was used to select a minimal connected set of US counties
enclosing the region of population enhancement. In this
process, overlap and merger reduced the total number
of metropolitan regions under consideration to 89.
As is discussed in the main text, nearly every metropolitan region saw, in mid-March 2020, an exponential increase of daily confirmed cases, followed by a flat/plateau
period of nearly constant daily confirmed cases. In a
few cases, the second phase — primarily caused by the
country-wide lockdown — lasted only days or weeks (possibly signaling a depletion of the susceptible population,
see discussion in main text), but for most metropolitan
regions the plateau persisted for months (indeed, persists or is again increasing at the time of this writing).
Thus, the initial value of the exponential growth rate, λ,
of daily confirmed cases could be reliably and automatically estimated by fitting the case numbers to a logistic
function

far in excess of Poisson noise, but are well modeled by
a log-normal probability density function with constant
width), and associated estimates of the variance in each
parameter. To avoid polluting the exponential growth
phase with singular early cases, a “detection limit” of 3
was imposed, and all daily case values less than or equal
to that limit were ignored in fitting. The only manual
intervention required for this fit was the specification of
the upper limit of its range, i.e., the end of the plateau
region, for each data set.
To analyze the effect of demographic, population, mobility, and weather variables on this initial growth rate,
we perform a weighted linear regression to the lambda
values (and their standard errors) of the 89 metropolitan
regions.
To choose representative cities for the visual examples in Figures 1A and 1C, we performed an additional
logistic fit to the mortality incidence data of each region and retained for Figure 1C only those that had
(1) less than 15% error in both growth rates, and (2)
|λcase − λdeath | < 0.15d−1 . This was done in an effort
to specifically comment on or highlight only those cities
for which the growth rate was accurately determined,
and was well correlated with the more reliable measure,
mortality growth, that we used for the remainder of the
analysis.
Linear Dynamical Model of Mortality Data
A standard weighted least squares analysis was performed on the measured exponential growth rate, λ14 ,
as a function of demographic, mobility, population and
weather variables, with weights equal to inverse root of
the estimated variance.
Nonlinear Model
We construct a model where, in the standard analogy
to chemical reaction kinetics, the incidence of infections
per unit area at time, i(t), is proportional to the product
of the density of susceptible individuals, S(t), and the
density of infected individuals, I(t). But, we allow for
the rate constant for infection3 in the encounter, β, to
depend on the infected individual’s “stage” of infection,
C, with C = 0 immediately following infection. The
incidence then has the form:
Z ∞
i(t) = −Ṡ(t) = S(t)
β(C) I(C, t) dC ,
(7)

to the susceptible population by all means other than
infection. The density of infected individuals is found by
integration over the stages of infection,
Z ∞
I(t) =
I(C, t) dC .
(8)
0

If the rate constant were taken to be independent of stage,
i.e., β(C) = β̄, we would obtain the familiar expression
Ṡ(t) = −β̄S(t)I(t). We will assume spatial homogeneity
and that the total density of individuals is constant and
equal to S(0) for a particular region, but, that the density
could vary when comparing different regions.
We assume that an infected individual’s evolution
through the stages of infection, C, follows a Gaussian
random walk in time, but modulated by an exponential
rate, d, of death or recovery. Therefore we have
Z ∞
I(C, t) =
i(t − a) frw (C; a) e−d a da
(9)

where a is the “age” of an infection (time since infection),
and the probability density function for the stage at a
given age is given by

where τ is the characteristic time scale of the random

stages and taking the derivative with respect to time
˙ = i(t) − dI(t), showyields the familiar expression I(t)
ing that the model reduces to the SIR model if a stageindependent rate constant, β̄, is assumed.
As we show here, using the random walk to specify the
dependence of infection stage on time allows for both a
non-exponential distribution of delays to infectiousness
(which is more realistic than that of the simplest model
with incubation, the SEIR model) and a formal solution
for the exponential growth rate. Inserting the expression
for I(t, C) into the incidence equation yields

with infection age a. To obtain the simplest nontrivial
incubation period, we assume that β(C) = β̄ Θ(C − 1) —
where Θ(x) is the Heaviside step function — meaning

β(C) = hσvieff (C), i.e., the scattering cross section of an encounter

4 More precisely: C is the absolute value of the position of a 1D
random walker, taking one step every ∆t, with step size drawn from a
normal distribution with mean zero and variance ∆t/τ . The variance
of the walker position at time t is then t/τ

For the early stages of the epidemic, when we can assume that the population of susceptibles is approximately
constant and large, we see that the growth rate depends
approximately linearly on the square of the logarithm of
the density. In later stages, when either the base contact
rate declines due to social distancing interventions, or
the population of susceptibles decreases, we see that the
exponential rate takes the value λ ≈ −d.
In practice, we utilize the exact Lambert W-function
expression as our “nonlinear model” for fitting λ14 , where
we parameterize β and τ by the demographic, population,
and weather variables (see main text). To estimate the
susceptible density, S̄, in this procedure we must use the
reported mortality statistics. Thus far we have not specified the dynamics of death. We now make the assumption

Relation between the remaining susceptible density, S(t) and the death fraction, fD (t)
In epidemic models the infection of susceptible individuals is typically determined by
Ṡ = −β S I∗

(21)

where I∗ is the density of infectious (contagious) individuals, and for our model, βSI∗ is the right-hand side of
Eqn. 7. This can be solved, formally, as:


Z t
S(t) = S(0) exp −β
I∗ (s) ds
(22)
Alternatively, the susceptible density can be expressed in
terms of the cumulative number of infected individuals,
Itot , i.e.,
S(t) = S(0) [1 − fI (t)]

Diverse local epidemics reveal the distinct effects of population density, demographics, climate, depletion of susceptibles,
and intervention in the first wave of COVID-19 in the United States

where fI (t) = Itot /N , with N the total population.
When fitting the exponential growth rate of mortality,
λ14 (t) to our nonlinear model, Eqn. (16) (see main text),
we must estimate the value of the susceptible density driving growth at that time. Without any reliable information about the true infected or infectious populations, we
must do so using the mortality statistics. We show here
how the previous two equations can be used, along with
reasonable assumptions about distinct sub-populations
driving infection and death, to determine a relationship
between the reported cumulative mortality (per capita)
and the remaining susceptible density.
Our basic assumption is that there are two different
categories of susceptible individuals underlying the dynamics of the epidemic: (A) highly mobile individuals
with a large geographic reach that frequently interact
with other individuals (in particular, infectious individuals) and thus drive the dynamics of infection (these could
be termed “super-spreaders” (Liu, Eggo, and Kucharski,
2020)); and (B) essentially non-mobile individuals that
have quite rare contacts with infectious individuals, but
have a much higher probability of death once infected,
and therefore make up the majority of the mortality burden. The dynamics of each susceptible population is
governed by an equation of the form in Eqn. (21), with
a common density of infectious individuals, I∗ , but with
different rate constants, βA  βB . From Eqn. (22), we
see that the susceptible densities of the two populations
are then related, at any time, by:

β /β
SA (t)
SB (t) A B
=
.
SA (0)
SB (0)

(24)

Expressing the non-mobile population in terms of the
cumulative fraction infected, we have
h
iβA /βB
SA (t)
(B)
= 1 − fI (t)
,
SA (0)

(25)

and, assuming that the infection fatality rate (IFR) is a
constant factor, fD (t) = IFR × fI (t − ∆t), where ∆t is
the delay from infection to death, we can write:
"
#βA /βB
(B)
fD (t + ∆t)
SA (t)
= 1−
.
SA (0)
IFR

(26)

Finally, having assumed that the ratio of infection rates
is large, we can approximate this as:


SA (t − ∆t)
βA
(B)
≈ exp −
fD (t)
(27)
SA (0)
βB IFR
The “A” category of individuals, as defined above, are
exactly those individuals driving the infection in our
model (and, presumably, in the real world), and, therefore, the susceptible density SA is exactly that which must

be estimated for Eqn. (16). On the other side, with people aged 65 and over accounting for ∼80% of COVID-19
deaths, and with approximately ∼45% of deaths linked
to nursing homes, the mortality statistics are clearly tracing individuals similar to category “B.” Therefore, we use
this relationship,
S(t − ∆t) = S(0) exp [−CD fD (t)] ,
to estimate the susceptible density in terms of the reported per capita mortality, where we assume S(0) is
proportional to the population weighted density (PWD).
We also considered the standard approach, in which
the population is a single homogeneous group. In that
case, the susceptible density could be estimated as


fD (t + ∆t)
S(t) = S(0) [1 − fI (t)] = S(0) 1 −
.
IFR
(28)
In testing both models, we found that the two-component
population scenario was preferred by the data at the ∼
10σ confidence level, with the homogeneous population
model failing to capture the observed dependence of the
growth rate on the per capita mortality (Figure 13).
The broader implications of our assumption of two
populations is that the required proportion of individuals with immunity for “herd immunity” to take effect, is
lower than population with homogeneous mobility characteristics, i.e., the epidemic will slow as a significant
proportion of the “super-spreader” category have been
infected (category A, above), regardless of the level of
infection and immunity in the rest of the population.
Indeed, the effect of population heterogeneity on lowering the “herd immunity” threshold for COVID-19 was
recently noted (Britton, Ball, and Trapman, 2020), and
will be important in interpreting the results of randomized serology tests across the entire population (Havers
et al., 2020b).

Incubation Time
The nonlinear epidemic model described above posits
that the incubation of SARS-COV2 virus within an infected individual can be modelled by a stochastic random
walk starting at zero, with excursions beyond ±1 corresponding to episode(s) of infectiousness. This makes our
model distinct from the standard SEm In R compartmental models (see, e.g., (Champredon, Dushoff, and Earn,
2018)), where the progress of the disease is only in one
direction — E 1 → E 2 → . . . → I 1 → I 2 → . . . — while
in our model (Figure 14), the individual can jump back
and forth between different stages (with the obvious
exception of Death), with a constant exit rate of d for
quarantine, recovery, or death. This can be described

Figure 14: The stages of COVID-19 infection, as a continuous
variable C. We model the disease as a random walk,
starting at C = 0, and a uniform exit rate (due
to either quarantine or recovery). The curves show
the resulting distribution in C, during the growing
(early) and decaying (late) epidemic. Note that the
Hospitalization and Death are not directly modelled
in the Nonlinear model, as they should have a small
effect on the spread of the epidemic.

Figure 13: Comparison of hypotheses regarding the relationship
between the susceptible fraction, S(t)/S(0), and the
dead fraction, fD (t). A model in which deaths are
suffered by a largely immobile population, while the
infection is driven by a mobile category of individual (bottom) was preferred to one with a single homogenous population (top) at the 9σ confidence level.
Similar to Figure 6, the points show the best-fit linear
model prediction for NYC, fitted independently in different bins of mortality to population ration, while
the lines show best-fit ± 1σ nonlinear models. Note
that while we show the nonlinear model predictions
for a county similar to NYC, we use all US data to
find the best fits.

Based on this picture, and the best-fit parameters to the
US county mortality data (Table 2), we can infer the
probabilities associated with the different stages of the
disease. For example, by looking at the steady-state solutions of Equation (29), we can compute the probability
that an exposed individual (who starts at C = 0) will ever
become infectious (i.e., make it beyond C = Cinf = 1):
√
Pinf = exp[− 2dτ Cinf ], where Cinf = 1,
(30)
This is plotted as a function of the median age of the
community in Figure (15a). For example, for the median
age of all US counties, A = 37.4-yr, we get:
Pinf (37.4 years) = 0.08+0.04
−0.03 (68% C.L.),

(31)

i.e., less than 12% of exposed individuals will ever be
able to infect others, although this fraction increases in
older communities.
Next, we can compute the distribution of times for
the onset of infectiousness, i.e., the incubation period.
This can be done by using a first crossing probability
of a random walk, which we did by solving Equation

This estimate is much longer than those found by tracking the serial interval (time from between the start of
symptoms for an infector-infectee pair) in COVID-19
patients (Ganyani et al., 2020; Nishiura, Linton, and
Akhmetzhanov, 2020), which are on the order of 5–10 d.
It is possible that the long tail of these distributions, generated by the slow asymptotic exponential decay at rate
d ≈ 0.06d−1 , raises the mean generation interval, while
a clinical study, is necessarily biased toward shorter serial
intervals.

(15b), again showing a shorter incubation period in older
communities.
Finally, we can compute the probability density function for the generation interval, g(tg ), defined in Equation
(19) (Figure 15c). This shows a similar qualitative dependence on age as the incubation period, but the median
incubation period is, as expected, shorter than the generation interval for each age group. Using Eqn. (20) and
our parameterization of τ , we find a mean generation
interval of

One of the most pressing questions in any exercise in physical modelling is whether we have a good understanding
of the uncertainty in the predictions of the model. While
we have an estimate of the measurement uncertainties
for the mortality growth rates, λ14 , which we discussed
in the main text, we also should characterize whether the
deviation of the best-fit model from the measurements
are consistent with statistical errors. To evaluate this,
we can look at the average of the ratio of the variance of
the model residuals to that of the measurement errors,
otherwise known as reduced χ2 , or χ2red . This is shown
in Figure (16), demonstrating that we see no systematic
error in model that is significantly bigger than statistical
errors, across counties with different populations.
As another consistency check, Table (3) examines
whether the parameters of the model change significantly
from urban counties with large, uniform populations, to
rural counties with a small and more sparse population
(Figures 11-12). From counties with enough COVID mortality data, roughly those with population & 106 inhabit
half of the total population, which we chose as our threshold, separating large from small counties. We notice no
statistically significant difference, and Table (3) even
suggests that Fisher errors quoted here might be overestimating the true errors. This comparison brings further

Given an understanding of the physical model and
its uncertainties, we can provide realistic simulations to
forecast the future of mortality in any community, similar
to those provided in the main text (Figure 4), which
can be made on-demand using our online dashboard:
https://wolfr.am/COVID19Dash.
In order to perform these simulations, we follow these
simple steps. To predict the daily mortality on day t + 1,
D(t + 1), we use the prior 13 days of D(t), as well as the
total mortality up to that point:

We see that the residuals are consistent with measurement errors.

1. Use Equation (1), plugging in prior total mortality,
county information, weather, mobility and parameters in Table 2 to find λ14 . Every simulation uses a
random realization of model parameters (from their
posterior fits), which remain fixed through that simulation.
2. Add the random model uncertainty to λ14 using:

where gt0 s are random independent numbers drawn
from a unit-variance normal distribution. This captures the model uncertainty mentioned above, while
ensuring that it remains correlated across the 14
days that are used to define λ14 .
3. Having fixed the logarithmic slope for daily mortality λ14 , find the best-fit intercept and its standard
error for ln[D(t0 ) + 1/2] for the preceding 13 days,
i.e. t − 12 ≤ t0 ≤ t, which can then be used to find
a random realization for ln[D(t + 1) + 1/2]
4. Advance to next day and return to step 1.

across geography and demography.
On average, we find that (either county-weighted or
population-weighted) χ2red ' 1.28, suggesting that the
model errors are only 13% bigger than statistical errors.
We further compare the model-prediction vs measured
mortality growth rate in Figure (17) for all our available data. We find that the 1-σ error in the model prediction (in excess measurement errors) is on average
±σ14 = ±0.0180, i.e. 1.8% error in the daily mortality
growth rate. This is shown in Figure (17) as the red
region, which compares the model prediction with the
observed mortality growth rates. We can also see that
there appears to be no significant systematic deviation
from the predictions, at least for λ14 < 0.23/day.

Note that, in contrast to Table (2), we use temperature rather than specific humidity (CT rather than CH ), as the latter was
not available for some small counties. Nevertheless, the parameters remain also statistically consistent with Table (2).
