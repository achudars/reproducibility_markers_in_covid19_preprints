Abstract
Introduction. Current reports indicate that the increased use of social distancing for
preventive COID-19 distribution may have a negative effect on patients who suffering
from acute medical conditions.
Aim. We examined the effect of social distancing on acute ischemic stroke (AIS)
patients' referral to the emergency department (ED)
Method. A retrospective archive study was conducted between January 2017 and
April 2020 in a comprehensive stroke center. We compare the number of neurologic
consultations, time from symptoms onset to ED arrival, patients diagnosis with AIS,
number of patients receiving treatment (tPA, endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) or
combine) and in-hospital death.
Results. The analysis included a total of 14,626 neurological consultations from the
years 2017 to 2020. A significant decrease of 58.6% was noted during the months of
January-April of the year 2020 compared to the parallel period of 2017. Percent of
final AIS diagnosis for the year of 2020 represent 24.8% of suspected cases, with the
highest diagnosis rate demarcated for the year of 2019 with 25.6% of confirmed
patients. The most remarkable increase was noted in EVT performance through the
examined years (2017, n=21; 2018, n=32; 2019, n=42; 2020, n=47).
Conclusion. COVID-19 pandemic resulted in routing constraints on health care
system resources that were dedicated for treating COVID-19 patients.
The healthcare system must develop and offer complementary solutions that will
enable access to health services even during these difficult times.

Currently, the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine or any definitive medication
has led to increased use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), aimed at
reducing contact rates in the population and thereby transmission of the virus.1 Two
fundamental strategies are possible: (a) mitigation and (b) suppression.
Each policy has major challenges. The strategies differ as to whether they aim
to reduce the reproduction number, to below 1 (suppression) – and thus cause case
numbers to decline – or merely to slow spread by reducing reproduction number.1
NPIs impact depend on the extent to which people respond to instructions, which
varies among countries and even communities, with significant spontaneous changes
in population behavior even in the absence of government-mandated interventions.
In Israel, several NPI interventions are currently applied: (a) Symptomatic
case isolation in home - symptomatic cases are under home isolation until symptoms
resolve; (b) Voluntary home quarantine - all household members remain at home for
14 days following identification of a symptomatic case in the household, or when a
member returns home from another country; (c) Social distancing of those over 60
years of age – who are required to remain in their households, separate themselves
from family members, and avoid hospital and community medical waiting rooms; (d)
Social distancing of entire populations - all households reduce contact outside the
household, school, or workplace except those affiliated to an approved government
institute; and (e) Closure of schools and universities - closure of all schools and
universities while shifting to remote learning programs.
Social distancing guidelines were implemented from initial pandemic
declaration during the month of December and gradually exacerbated as the pandemic
spread and reached a massive global impact by February through April.

These social distancing guidelines indirectly create two isolated populations at
high-risk: the chronically ill and voluntary isolated persons who had contact with a
verified patient or person returning from abroad. These populations are at increased
risk mainly due to difficulty in accessing medical care.
Stroke remains a medical emergency even during a pandemic and although ischemic
stroke has been recognized as a complication of COVID-19 the mechanisms and
phenotype are not yet understood.2
Optimizing outcomes matter even more in these times as patients affected with severe
stroke require hospitalization and may potentially be at greater risk of in-patient
morbidity and mortality.3 Current pandemic compel the elaboration of a more
articulate pathway for acute stroke patients, re-routing patient care and allocation of
designated pathway for patients with large vessel occlusion.4
NPI's impact on stroke load has yet to be apparent. However, global concerns rises
stating that the management of stroke must not be neglected.5

Method
Study Design and Setting
A retrospective archive study was conducted between January 2017 and April 2020 in
a comprehensive stroke center. The hospital serves as a comprehensive stroke center
from throughout the north of Israel, and is a referral center for 12 district hospitals, in
addition to the Israel Defense Forces Northern Command, the United States Sixth
Fleet, United Nations peacekeeping forces and foreign embankment ships stations in
the region. The ED contains 105 beds, and about 136,819 patients >18 years old are
treated per year on average. Of these, approximately 5000 patients with suggestive
symptoms of AIS are assessed by a neurologist in the hospital annually.

A comparison was made for the months of January-April for the years 2017 to 2020.
The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the hospital (#3023-18RMB).

Data collection
For each year, data collection was conducted in four steps (Figure 1). First, in order to
examine the number of patients admitted with symptoms suggestive of AIS we
extracted all neurological consultations from the electronic medical record (EMR).
Neurologic consultation can be requested either by the triage nurse or by an ED
physician. AIS suspected was defined according to the following key-words:
confusion, loss of consciousness, vision abnormalities, dysarthria, facial paralysis,
loss of balance, lack of coordination, numbness, weakness, hemiparesis, sensory
abnormalities, headaches with abnormalities of gait and diplopia. Neurological
consultations of Traumatic head injury, Drug use, Alcohol intoxication, Epileptic
seizures, Meningitis, Post herpetic neuralgia, Trigeminal neuralgia, Multiple sclerosis,
Parkinson's disease, Psychosis, Malignancy and Migraine as initial diagnosis were
excluded. Second, in order to examine which of the patients had a final AIS diagnosis
we collected CT examination results of patients referred from the ED and reviewed
the medical records of all patients discharged between the years of 2017 to 2019
diagnosed with AIS except cases of in-hospital stroke. AIS was determined according
to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 codes: 433.01, 433.10, 433.11,
433.21, 433.31, 433.81, and 433.91 (occlusion and stenosis of pre-cerebral arteries),
434.00, 434.01, 434.11, and 434.91 (occlusion of cerebral arteries), 436 (acute but illdefined cerebrovascular disease). We excluded the following codes 430,431,432
demonstrating hemorrhagic stroke. Third, composing a final patient list by cross

linking of records was performed by the first and third author, matching patient's
identification number, case number and exclusion of duplicate records.

Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables are reported as means and standard deviations (SD) or medians
and interquartile ranges (IQR), as appropriate. Dichotomous variables are reported as
proportions. The data analysis was performed using SAS® software (SAS Enterprise
Guide 7.1) and Python 3.6.5 software version 2019a.

Results
The analysis included a total of 14,626 neurological consultations from the years 2017
to 2020, representing 31.4%, 28.1%, 27.5% and 13.0% respectively. A significant
decrease of 58.6% was noted during the months of January-April of the year 2020
compared to the parallel period of 2017. Percent of final AIS diagnosis for the year of
2020 represent 24.8% of suspected cases, with the highest diagnosis rate demarcated
for the year of 2019 with 25.6% of confirmed patients. (Figure 1)
Figure 2 depicts treatment distribution of AIS patients. We found that the number of
patients receiving treatment, either tPA or EVT, increased during the year of 2020
(n=84). With the lowest number of treated patients in the year of 2017 (n=44), and
relative uniformity in the years of 2018 and 2019 (n=67 and n=65 respectively).
The most remarkable increase was noted in EVT performance through the examined
years (2017, n=21; 2018, n=32; 2019, n=42; 2020, n=47) compared to tPA
administration, demonstrating relative uniformity (2017, n=19; 2018, n=26; 2019,
n=20; 2020, n=28).

Patient arrival within six hours from symptom onset was also noted (Figure 3). No
significant difference was noticed for the years of 2017 (January, n=27%; February,
n=27%; March, n=23% and April, n=32%), 2018 (January, n=29%; February,
n=35%; March, n=42% and April, n=40%) and 2019 (January, n=28%; February,
n=34%; March, n=30% and April, n=33%). The most remarkable arrival rate was
noted for the year 2020 compared to the previous years, with a 100% arrival rate in
the month of April.
For in-hospital death of all-cause mortality, an increase was noted from 2017 (n=15)
to 2018 (n=32) and 2019 (n=26), with a subsequential decrease in 2020 (n=17).
Intracranial hemorrhage was found to represent 66.7% of death cases during 2017 and
64.7% in 2020. Lower rates were noted in 2018 and 2019 with 25% and 30.7%
respectively (Table 1).

Discussion
Currently, the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine or any definitive medication has led to
increased use of NPIs, aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and thereby
transmission of the virus.6 Those NPI'S, primarily based on social distancing has led
to a controlled disciplined minimizing viral spread and reduced mortality and
morbidity rate.7 However, the lack of an anticipated pandemic of such magnitude has
forced hospitals to an unprecedented and unexpected channeling of resources into
COVID-19 patient treatment. Simultaneously, medical staff and medical services
campaigns have urged people to stay in their homes and encourage the use of
telemedicine.8

Alongside the positive effect of the mitigation strategies undertaken, a number of
negative outcomes were also noted.7 Among them, a significant reduction in the
number of urgent referrals to the ED, one of which is AIS.
It is possible that the fear of contagion at the hospital has discouraged access to
emergency medical services, particularly after the media diffused the news that the
infection was largely spread across hospitalized patients and healthcare personnel due
to the lack of personal protection equipment. Furthermore, second hypothesis is
linked to the fact that the emergency medical system was focused on COVID-19 and
most healthcare resources were relocated to manage the pandemic. This might have
induced an attitude towards deferral of less urgent cases, at both the patient and the
healthcare system levels.8
In the current study examining AIS patients patterns in the ED during the period of
four months for four consecutive years, with consideration to the COVID-19
pandemic, a significant decrease was noticed in the number of neurologic
consultations, ED referral for AIS and of those the number of final AIS diagnosis.
Numbers illustrate in a significant manner that patients avoided seeking medical care
and ED visit. However, the absolute number of patients undergoing treatment has
showed an increasing trend during the year of 2020, during pandemic times.
A possible explanation may be speculated for symptom severity for those arriving to
the ED. Patients willing to seek medical care represented with severs AIS symptoms
and required interventional treatment. Second explanation may be attributed to the
lower ED arrival rate affiliating to a non-specific medical cause. Thus, neurology
teams were able to increase attentiveness for staff guidance and greater attention was
placed for each case leading to a more deliberated decision for treatment necessity.

Arrival time distribution demonstrate a significant increase for 2020 compared to the
previous year when 100% of patients arrived within 6 hours. A suitable speculation is
of severe symptomatic presentation also serving as a possible explanation for early
presentation. Although no significant increase in the in-hospital mortality rate was
noted, the rate of in-hospital mortality due to intra cranial hemorrhage was
significantly higher than parallel periods in the years 2018 and 2019. As such, it may
indicate a severe infarct leading to ICH for the elderly arriving with AIS. Craniotomy
is usually performed for young patients, especially if the case is a right infarct. In
patients with poor prognosis, surgical procedure is usually avoided.9
In the present case, the patients arriving may have presented with a massive
hemorrhage forming a significant edema, pressing the brain stem. In addition, the
Intensive care unit teams preoccupied with the treatment of COVID-19 patients may
not had the opportunity to perform a complex procedure such as craniotomy.
In contrary to a previous correspondence letter10 demonstrating an increase in the
number of young patients, COVID-19 positive, presenting with large vessel
occlusion, in the current study such increase was not noticed.

Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the present study is a retrospective study of
medical cases, thus we rely on accurate recordkeeping of others. Secondly, data is
available solely for patients arriving to the ED and not for those not referred or their
outcomes. Thirdly, there is no long-term follow-up of mortality within 30 days, 90
days and a year as is common in AIS cases. Finally, we cannot completely exclude
that a true reduction in the incidence of acute cardiovascular disease as the potential
result of low physical stress and widespread prevalence of the resting state during the

quarantine, especially in the initial phase of the social containment, might have partly
contributed to the lower number of admissions for acute stroke.

Conclusion
COVID-19 pandemic forced hospitals to an unprecedented and unexpected
channeling of resources. Alongside the positive effect of the mitigation strategies
taken, a negative effect may be present for patients suffering from acute medical
conditions. Paradoxically, lower referral rate and final AIS diagnosis rate were noted
parallel to increased treatment percentage. As such, implications may indicate
symptom severity and hesitation from seeking medical care. Complementary solutions
must be develop by the healthcare system to enable access to health services even
during these difficult times.
