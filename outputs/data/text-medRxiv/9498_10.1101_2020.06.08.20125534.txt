ABSTRACT
SARS-CoV-2 spread has proven to be especially difficult to mitigate in high risk settings, including nursing
homes, cruises, prisons and various industrial settings. Among industrial settings, meat processing
facilities in the United States have experienced particularly challenging outbreaks. We have sequenced
SARS-CoV-2 whole viral genomes from individuals testing positive in an integrated regional healthcare
system serving 21 counties in southwestern Wisconsin, northeastern Iowa and southeastern Minnesota,
providing an overview of SARS-CoV-2 introduction and spread in a region spanning multiple jurisdictions
with differing mitigation policies. While most viral introductions we detected were contained with only
minor transmission chains, a striking exception was an outbreak associated with a meatpacking plant in
Postville, IA. In this case, a single viral introduction led to unrestrained spread within the facility,
affecting many staff and members of their households. Importantly, by surveilling viral sequences from
the surrounding counties, we have documented the spread of this SARS-CoV-2 substrain from this
epicenter to individuals in 13 cities in 7 counties in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, a region spanning
185 square miles. This study highlights the regional public health consequences of failures to rapidly act
to mitigate viral spread in a single industrial setting.

INTRODUCTION
The SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus is a novel respiratory pathogen which emerged in Wuhan, China in late
2019 (1). An early assessment of the 29,903 base RNA genome sequence of 95 viral specimens
highlighted several sequence variants (2). Numerous teams around the world have produced a rapidly
increasing number of publicly available sequences (32,673 in GISAID on 5/27/20) with obvious sequence
diversification as viral replication and spread has continued. These sequence variants, inherited in each
cycle of viral replication, allow the generation of phylogenetic trees through which the evolution of the
virus can be traced. Individual viruses acquire mutations during replication at an approximate rate of 1-2
sites per month (3). This mutation rate provides good resolution for both global and local tracking of
viral substrains. Because viral replication occurs in individuals, tracking these inherited variants acts as a
proxy for tracking the spread of the virus through populations of individuals.
In the present study, we have monitored the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 to the service area
of the Gundersen Health System, an integrated healthcare system headquartered in La Crosse, WI and
providing care in 21 counties in southwestern Wisconsin, northeastern Iowa and southeastern
Minnesota. We have performed whole viral genome sequencing on 67 positive cases from this region,
spanning three states which have adopted mitigation approaches of differing intensity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens
Specimens were nasopharyngeal swabs taken for diagnostic purposes and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2
positivity at the Gundersen Medical Foundation’s Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory using the CDC 2019nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic assay. This study includes positive cases diagnosed between
3/18/2020 and 5/24/2020) Ethical approval was obtained from the Gundersen Health System
Institutional Review Board (#2-20-03-008; PI: Kenny) to perform additional next-generation sequencing
on remnant specimens after completion of diagnostic testing. Samples for this study include only those
testing positive in Gundersen Healthcare System’s diagnostic laboratories and, as such, do not include
other cases from the region which may have been tested in other healthcare systems and/or public
health laboratories.

RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Nasopharyngeal swabs were immersed in liquid medium. RNA was isolated using QIAmp Viral RNA Mini
kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). cDNA was synthesized from 5 µl of purified RNA using ProtoScript II First
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Early libraries were generated from
cDNA prepared using a mixture of random hexamers and oligo dT, although we soon determined that
omission of oligo dT led to better depth of coverage across the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
Next Generation sequencing
We used the Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Panel (Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA) to sequence 237 viral
specific targets encompassing the complete viral genome from cDNA derived from SARS-COV-2-positive
clinical specimens. Barcoded multiplexed libraries were prepared in batches of eight on the Ion Chef
(Thermo-Fisher) and sequenced on the Ion Torrent S5 (Thermo-Fisher), most commonly with a single
library of 8 specimens on an Ion 520 chip. For samples with low viral load (typically CT values above 30),
the merging of data from replicate runs was often required to achieve good coverage.
Bioinformatics
Demultiplexed Tmap-aligned bam files were produced by the Ion Torrent S5. To overcome difficulties
caused by read soft-clipping by this non-splice aware aligner, individual sequence reads were extracted
using samtools (4) and re-aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 genome using a splice-aware aligner, hisat2 (5).
These bam files were subjected to QC review in IGV. Samples passing QC had a consensus sequence
computed by IGV according to the method of Cavener (6). Consensus sequences were reported to
GISAID (7). For phylogenetic inference (i.e. to determine the hierarchy of case relationships) samples
were integrated with associated metadata and aligned on a local implementation of NextStrain (8) using
augur and displayed via a web browser using auspice.

RESULTS
Viral genome sequencing was attempted on all samples testing positive in Gundersen Healthcare
System’s diagnostic laboratories. Good genome-wide coverage was typically achieved with specimens
with clinical test Ct values up to 30/31, and merging of data from multiple runs allowed analysis of

samples with higher Ct values. Consensus viral sequences were loaded into a local implementation of
NextStrain, along with a background dataset of viral sequences from elsewhere in Wisconsin,
Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois which was downloaded from GISAID (See Supplemental Table 1 for all
sequences used in this study). Phylogenetic analysis indicated 14 independent viral introductions to our
region (Fig 1).
Notably, the majority of viral introductions did not give rise to outbreaks consisting of sustained
transmission chains. Often, where multiple cases are clustered on the tree, they consist of individuals
sharing the same household. A striking exception was a cluster of cases detected in Allamakee County,
Iowa (Fig 1, lower right). This cluster is associated with multiple individuals associated with a
meatpacking plant in the small town of Postville, Iowa (estimated population 2,083).
Since 4/6/2020 we have sequenced 27 viral cases that are attributed to this substrain (typically
identified by the SARS-CoV-2 polymorphisms C9866T, A14747G and A20755C). Allamakee County
reported 119 cases between late March and 5/26/2020, so we believe that the sequences reported here
represent only a sample of the cases arising from this outbreak. In addition, factors common in the
meatpacking workforce in this region (non-English speaking, under- or uninsured, low socio-economic
status, undocumented immigration status) may also adversely affect the ability to achieve a
comprehensive case count.
To estimate the origin of this viral substrain, we examined the position of this cluster relative to other
sequenced specimens from other regions on NextStrain.org (Fig 2). To facilitate understanding of the
origin and spread of these viral substrains, data are resolved by either time (diagnosis date, Fig 2A) and
by divergence (number of non-reference mutations, Fig 2B). This allowed us to ascertain the order of the
acquisition of these non-reference variants (first A20755C, then A14747G, followed by C9866T) and the
divergence that occurred among sequenced substrains over time. The substrain ancestral to most of
these viruses (containing only A20755C) was first detected in specimens obtained in Connecticut (CTYale) and in Israel in mid-March (Fig 2A). Analysis of divergence in this portion of the tree (Fig 2B) shows
8 identical viral sequences (5 from Israel, 1 from Russia, 1 from Connecticut and 1 from Maryland; These
specimens are aligned vertically in Fig 2B). Additional slightly more divergent sequences within this
group were from similar locations (New York, Connecticut, Israel). These data implicate the origin of the
Postville virus being in the northeastern United States with some overlap with Israel. The outgroup to

the sequences shown in this figure is mostly comprised of specimens sequenced in the USA so it seems
most likely that US-to-Israel rather than Israel-to-US spread contributed to the observed close
association of these specimens on this tree. After the acquisition of the A14747G mutation, the tree
splits in two, with one variant defining the Postville cluster (C9866T) and another variant (C16658T)
defining a cluster of cases identified in Arizona. The inferred ancestry of this Postville cluster in the
northeastern USA in early March is consistent with media reports of initial COVID19-positivity in three
family members associated with the meatpacking plant who returned to Postville from New York City in
early March (9).
In the early phase of this outbreak (first two weeks), the majority of cases sequenced from this substrain
were among plant workers or individuals living in their households. The first 16 cases were from
Allamakee County (13 cases) or neighboring Winneshiek County (3 cases). Although public health
departments typically do not release zip code level details, data published in the media on 5/12/2020
indicated that Postville accounted for the overwhelming majority of cases (87 out of 97) in Allamakee
county at that time (10). Thereafter, numerous cases were detected by sequencing in nearby and, later,
more distant, communities among individuals with no known direct link to the meatpacking workforce
(See Table 1 and Fig 3). In mid-May, we identified a case linked to this cluster in Trempealeau County,
WI which is more than 100 miles distant from the Postville epicenter. Cases traceable to this outbreak
have now been detected in seven counties in three states, affecting a total of 13 municipalities. This
region spans 185 square miles.
Although documenting the spread of this viral substrain was the primary focus of the study, we
performed an exploratory analysis of demographic and outcome data on affected individuals,
summarized in Table 2. The small sample size limited the statistical power of the analysis. We stratified
data between the outbreak county (Allamakee county; 15 cases) versus areas of subsequent spread
(other counties; 12 cases). We noted a non-significant trend toward older age in counties beyond the
epicenter. More individuals in the latter counties had significant relevant co-morbidities (diabetes
and/or chronic kidney disease, p = 0.0085). The hospital admission rate in the other counties was also
numerically higher (58.3% v 26.7%, p = ns). One individual died from COVID19.
The extent to which viral substrain differences may result in different clinical symptoms has been the
subject of speculation. In this series of 27 patients with clearly confirmed infection with a single

substrain, the patients had the following symptoms at presentation documented in their medical
records: Fever (59.3%), cough (51.9%), myalgia (29.6%), dyspnea (22.2%), diarrhea (22.2%), fatigue
(18.5%), anosmia (18.5%), headache (18.5%) and sore throat (18.5%), indicating substantial initial
symptom variability among individuals infected with essentially identical viruses. This variability,
particularly the high proportion of individuals lacking fever, highlights the challenges inherent in
deploying effective workforce symptom screening.
DISCUSSION
Contemporaneous with the outbreak reported here, several outbreaks at meat processing plants have
been reported across the United States (11). While the importance of meat to the national food supply
has been emphasized at the highest levels of government, the full implications of such policies require
assessment of impacts not just to individuals designated “essential workers” but to their families,
communities and broader regional populations.
The genomic epidemiology in the present study documents not just the effects of unmitigated spread of
SARS-CoV-2 within a meatpacking plant, but the collateral damage resulting from widespread
dissemination of this disease from a meat-packing epicenter across a large midwestern region. Unlike
most of the SARS-CoV-2 introductions to our region which resulted in minimal spread (Fig 1), this
particular introduction grew explosively. Review of the clinical histories of individuals tested in this study
revealed anecdotes of numerous additional household members exhibiting symptoms of COVID19 but
who were not tested, underlining the fact that the cases presented here represent only a subset of the
cases likely attributable to this source.
The ability to move beyond simple identification of positive cases to unambiguously identifying patterns
of case-to-case spread and cluster formation will improve the ability of the healthcare system (both
hospitals and public health departments) to understand and monitor the emergence and spread of
SARS-CoV-2 infections from new clusters as they are seeded. This may allow discovery of weak points in
current disease control strategies in ways that might not otherwise be possible (e.g. linking of
meatpacking cluster with a new case more than 100 miles distant). Such weak points may be amenable
to mitigation by specific additional social, structural, or technical interventions.

The public health infrastructure in the United States has suffered from systematic underinvestment for
many years (12). A comprehensive and sustained effort to track and mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread may be
limited by capacity and resource issues, which may be particularly acute in rural counties, but also by
the ability of public health officials to communicate efficiently across county and state lines. A
significant strength of the current study is the co-location of the sequencing team with the molecular
diagnostics laboratory which was among the earliest laboratories to provide SARS-CoV-2 testing across
this wide region. By sequencing viral genomes from a region spanning 21 counties in 3 states, our team
has been able to achieve an overview of interregional spread that would be most challenging for smaller
entities. Dissemination of such information to local county health departments may assist them in more
efficiently targeting limited resources to high yield interventions to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread.
CONCLUSIONS
Overall, these data, which almost certainly undersample the true extent of disease spread, document
the regional consequences of early failures to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 contagion in an industrial setting.
