Abstract
Objective
The new kind of coronavirus SARS-Cov2 spread to countries in all continents
in the World. The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) causes fever, cough, sore
throat, and in severe cases shortness of breath and death. To evaluate strategies,
it is necessary to forecast the number of cases and deaths, in order to aid the
stakeholders in the process of making decisions against the disease. We propose
a system for real-time forecast of the cumulative cases of Covid-19 in Brazil.

tification System, from March to May 2020, concentrated on Brazil.io databases.
Training and evaluation of ARIMA and other machine learning algorithms
for temporal forecasting using correlation indexes (Pearson’s, Spearman’s, and
Kendall’s) and RMSE(%). Validation from the relative errors of the following
six days.
Methods
Our developed software, COVID-SGIS, captures information from the 26 states
and the Distrito Federal at the Brazil.io database. From these data, ARIMA
models are created for the accumulation of confirmed cases and death cases
by Covid-19. Finally, six-day forecasts graphs are available for Brazil and for
each of its federative units, separately, with a 95% CI. In addition to these
predictions, the worst and best scenarios are also presented.
Results
ARIMA models were generated for Brazil and its 27 federative units. The states
of Bahia, Maranhão, Piauı́, Rio Grande do Norte and Amapá, Rondônia every
day of the predictions were in the projection interval. The same happened to the
states of Espı́rito Santo, Minas Gerais, Paraná and Santa Catarina. In Brazil,
the percentage error between the predicted values and the actual values varied
between 2.56% and 6.50%. For the days when the forecasts outside the prediction interval, the percentage errors in relation to the worst case scenario were
below 5%. The states of Bahia, Maranhão, Piauı́, Rio Grande do Norte, Amapá,
and Rondônia every day of the predictions were in the projection interval. The
same happened to the states of Espı́rito Santo, Minas Gerais, Paraná and Santa
Catarina.
Conclusion
The proposed method for dynamic forecasting may be used to guide social
policies and plan direct interventions in a robust, flexible and fast way. Since
it is based on information from multiple databases, it can be adapted to the
different realities, becoming an important tool to guide the course of politics
and action against Covid-19 pandemic worldwide.

1. Introdução
The world are facing a pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARSCov2. The probable origin of the SARS-Cov2 is from a pangolin’s virus (Zhang
et al., 2020). SARS-Cov2 has a high transmission rate. During later December
2019 and May 2020 more than 4.7 million people were infected in 216 countries.
(WHO, 2020). Some coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) symptoms are fever,
cough, sore throat and gastrointestinal infection (Guo et al., 2020). But in
severe cases Covid-19 can lead to shortness of breath and death. Until later
May 317 thousands people died due Covid-19 (WHO, 2020).
The gold standard test to diagnosis Covid-19 is the Reverse Transcription
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) with DNA sequencing and identification
(Döhla et al., 2020). Nevertheless, RT-PCR needs several hours to give a result
(Döhla et al., 2020). While RT-PCR identify directly the virus presence, in
other hand, rapid test are nonspecific. They detect the serological evidence of
recent infection like antibodies. However the production of antibodies starts
after some days or even weeks after the infection (Okba et al., 2020). Besides
that, this kind of tests could recognize antigens of other viruses, like flu and
other coronaviruses (Li et al., 2020). What compromise the test accuracy. For
example, tests based on IgM/IgG antibodies realized in samples collected in the
first week of illness have 18.8% of sensitivity and 77.8% of specificity (Liu et al.,
2020a).
The best strategy to decrease the transmission rate of the SARS-Cov2 is the
social isolation and quarantine. Its main goal is to provide a safe physical distance between infected and uninfected people. Chen et al. (2020) reported that
measure as cancelled or postponed large public events and closed non-essential
activities have helped to reduce the spread of the virus in China. Social isolation and quarantine also prevent that asymptomatic infected people spread

the disease (Chen et al., 2020; Day, 2020). Other works also show good results in reduce the virus transmission with social isolation in Italy Day (2020),
Switzerland Salathé et al. (2020) and Brazil (Oliveira et al., 2020).
One of the approaches used to combat diseases is the prediction of the number of cases based on the behavior of past events. In the case of arboviruses, for
example, the time series of the number of cases and climatic variables are used
to predict future behaviors (Guo et al., 2017; Siriyasatien et al., 2018; Baquero
et al., 2018). Considering the SARS-Cov2, predicting the pandemic trends could
be crucial to avoid the virus spreading. Because of that many models basing in
mathematical model as Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) and its variations
have being used to forecast Covid-19 pandemic trends (Wangping et al., 2020;
Bastos and Cajueiro, 2020; Liu et al., 2020b; Anastassopoulou et al., 2020; Yang
et al., 2020; Ardabili et al., 2020).
The main goal of this work is to present a methodology for monitoring and
forecasting of cases and deaths of Covid-19 in Brazil and its federative units.
The system is basing in a web application that use information from multiple
databases. This informations are used for forecasting in national and state
level. We used an ARIMA method (Hyndman and Khandakar, 2008) adapted
to a very dynamic disease as Covid-19. Our model is basing in a dynamic
forecasting because the model is training each day with a maximum window of
three days. Thus our model is flexible and robust considering that it’s adapt
each day. That makes policy measures been perceived by the method. Besides
that, the model gives three possible scenarios: the expected case with 95%
confidence interval (CI) and also the worst and best cases.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 we discuss about studies that
used mathematical models to predict trends of Covid-19 pandemic. Section 3
we describe our proposed method and it also reviews the theoretical concepts
that concern this work. In section 4 we present and analyze the results. Section
5 draws discussions and the work finalize in Section 6 with the conclusions.

2. Related Works
Several Covid-19 prediction models have emerged around the world. Because
of the many uncertainties surrounding the behavior of the virus, these models
have guided the development of public health strategies and the application of
policies that promote social isolation. Given this scenario, several studies have
sought to adapt conventional epidemiological models to predict this pandemic
trend.
Wangping et al. (2020), for instance, used an extended Susceptible-InfectedRemoved (eSIR) model to predict epidemics trends in Italy and compared with
Hunan, China due to its similarity of population size with Italy. eSIR model is
a version of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) classic model. SIR model
takes three differents classes: susceptible, infected, removed (recovered and
dead). This model was presented by Kermack and McKendrick in their article published in 1927 (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927), by Britton in their
book entitled ”Essential Mathematical Biology” (Britton, 2003) and by Brauer
et al. in the book ”Mathematical Epidemiology’ (Brauer et al., 1945). SIR
model is used to investigate diseases as measles and chickenpox. This model is
represented by the following equations:
d
S = −βSI,
dt

(1)

d
I = βSI − γI,
dt

(2)

d
I = βSI − γI,
(3)
dt
where S(t) is the population susceptible individuals, I(t) is the symptomatic
infected individuals, R(t) is the recovered individuals with immunity, β is the
contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals, and γ is the transfer
rate from I to R. The diagram in the Figure 1 explains the SIR model.
Whereas SIR model uses a constant transmission rate eSIR can adapt the
time-varying transmission rate in the population and also it uses time-varying

isolation measures. Using eSIR Wangping et al. (2020) predict that the reproduction number, R0, for Covid-19 was respectively 3.15 (95% CI: 1.71–5.21) in
Hunan and 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15–6.77) in Italy. Due to the discrepancy between
the values they concluded that this needs to be confirmed by further studies.
In a similar way, Bastos and Cajueiro (2020) developed models based on
SIR. Their main objective was to predict the evolution of the pandemic in Brazil
through data analysis in the period from February 25, 2020 to March 30, 2020.
Data were provided by the Ministry of Healthy of Brazil. For this, the authors
modified the SIR model, creating two other versions: SID (Susceptible-InfectedDead) and SIASD (Susceptible-Infected-Asymptomatic-Symptomatic-Dead). In
the first version, the authors modified the original model in order to estimate
the percentage of people who die from Covid-19. This new parameter also
changes the total number of individuals in the population. On the other hand,
the second version seeks to improve the SID model. It considers that a relevant
part of the population is infected, but asymptomatic. Then, in the SIASD
model, the variable of infected people is divided into two groups: symptomatic
and asymptomatic. In addition, the authors modified the transmission factor
taking into account the effect of social distance policies adopted during the
selected period. The addition of this parameter allows the model to evaluate the
effectiveness of the measures adopted. In order to estimate the parameters of the
models, the work sought to minimize the quadratic error between the real data

and the estimated values. The curves were constructed with a 95% confidence
interval. The authors also considered the underreporting of cases, due to the lack
of tests and the government’s recommendation to test only patients with severe
symptoms. Finally, both models indicated that social distance policies were able
to minimize contagion. It was also possible to conclude that policies adopted for
a short period are only able to postpone the peak of the pandemic. Thus, the
authors indicated the dates considered optimal to end the quarantine period,
in order to reduce the number of infections. In particular, the SIASD model
predicted a greater number of infections than the SID model. It also indicated a
lower peak for symptomatic patients, who are those who need medical attention.
In the study from Liu et al. (2020b), they also proposed a modified SIR model
to predict the cumulative number of cases of Covid-19 in China. Their model
was based on early data and is defined by the following system of differential
equations and the flowchart in Figure 2.
S 0 (t) = −τ (t)S(t)[I(t) + U (t)]

Figure 2: Model flow chart adapted from Liu et al. (2020b). They proposed a modified SIR
model by adding asymptomatic infectous people and by dividing symptomatic cases into two
classes: reported and unreported.

This model provides information regarding to the number of both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. It also estimates the amount of reported
and unreported cases from the symptomatic group. From this study, the authors
found that the estimation of unreported cases is extremely important to understand the severity of Covid-19. They also showed the importance of considering
the asymptomatic infectious cases to estimate disease transmission rate. From
their results, the authors demonstrated the importance of implementing severe
control measures by the government to decrease transmission.
Anastassopoulou et al. (2020) proposed a Susceptible-Infectious-RecoveredDead (SIRD) model to forecast the basic reproduction number (R0 ) of SARSCov2 and the daily rates of infection mortality and recovery. R0 measures the
average number of secondary cases that result from a single infectious case.
From the reproduction number, a system may predict the spreadability of a
infectious disease.
This approach was based on the daily available data of new confirmed cases
in Hubei province, China, and is described by the following equations:

S(t) = S(t − 1) −

S(t − 1)I(t − 1),

the infection rate, β is the estimation of the recovery rate, γ is the estimation

This model fits the behavior of Covid-19 in Hubei, being able to estimate key
epidemiological parameters. The approach was also successful in modelling and
forecasting the spread of Covid-19 in China. Nevertheless, their SIRD model
did not consider important factors that changes disease dynamics, such as the
effect of the incubation period, the characteristics of the population and effect
of restritive policies. The authors also point out to the urgent need for testing
and available official data. These factors are crucial to build accurate forecast
models, since they are the key way to tune the model by providing a more
realistic amount of infected cases.
On the other hand, Yang et al. (2020) proposed a modified SusceptibleExposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model and the Artificial Intelligence method
Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM), to predict epidemics trend of Covid-19 in
China under public health interventions. SEIR model is another conventional
prediction model, which is composed by four individual classes: Susceptible, Exposed to the virus or in the latent period, Infected and Removed. This model
was first introduced by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) and is used to understand illnesses like flu for example. SEIR
model uses the following equation system:

the 2003 SARS epidemic statistics, with available cases between April and June
of 2003. They predicted that the disease in China will peak in late February
and end in late April by a combination of their methods.
In contrast to previous works, Ardabili et al. (2020) made a comparative
analysis of machine learning techniques for predicting the coronavirus outbreak.
The authors argue that more traditional models, such as SIR and SEIR, are insufficient to model the pandemic. The reasons are the quarantine and social
distance policies applied by many governments in an iterative way, and the lack
of data that reveals the real scenario, since the reported data do not actually
correspond to the number of infected people. These factors impose great limits on the generalization ability of these conventional models. Thus, the work
explores ML techniques to find the best model that estimates time-series data.
Data were collected on the worldometers website in five countries: Italy, Germany, Iran, USA and China, corresponding to a period of 30 days. Initially,
simple mathematical models were tested (Logistic, Logarithmic, Quaddratic,
Compound, Power and exponential). In order to estimate the parameters, three
optimization algorithms were tested: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO), and the Gray Wolf (GWO) optimizer. Considering the
processing time, the RMSE and the correlation coefficient as evaluation metrics, the GWO optimizer presented the best results, while the logistic model
showed the smallest errors in the prediction of the Covid-19 outbreak for the
five countries. However, these models showed low accuracy and low generalization capacity, being unable to extrapolate the data beyond 30 days. In the
following, two ML methods were introduced for time-series prediction: MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system
(ANFIS). Both were tested in two different scenarios: Scenario 1 with data processed weekly, and Scenario 2, with daily sampling of consecutive days. In the
case of MLP, they tested 8, 12 and 16 neurons. For ANFIS, the membership
function types were Tri, Trap and Gauss. The comparison between analytical and intelligent models indicated that MLP presented better results in both
scenarios, being able to achieve a good approximation with the real data. Long11

term data (up to 150 days) were also extrapolated, which reported an outbreak
progression. Finally, the authors concluded that ML techniques can be useful
in predicting the Covid-19 pandemic, being able to overcome challenges found
in traditional models.

3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Proposed Method
In this work, we proposed a system for real-time forecast of the cumulative
cases of Covid-19 in Brazil and its 27 federative units. The system operates
as follows: Each Brazilian state feeds a database of Covid-19 notifications. All
of this information is gathered in a general database, the Brazil.io. Then, our
developed software, the COVID-SGIS, captures Covid-19 data daily made available by the Brasil.io portal1 through the SGIS web crawler. This accumulated
data is organized in a CSV file. From these data, training sets are formed and
the models are created for the accumulation of confirmed cases and death cases
by Covid-19. With the generated models, 6-day forecasts are made with a 95%
confidence interval which are available to the user. The forecast graphs of the
accumulated confirmed cases and deaths by Covid-19 are available for Brazil and
for each of its federative units, separately. In addition to the predictions, the
worst and best scenarios are presented for the number of confirmed cases and
the number of deaths by Covid-19. The Figure 4 shows the general schematic
of this solution.
3.2. Confirmed cases database
We used the data referring to confirmed cases available in the Brasil.io portal2 in our temporal prediction approach. Brasil.io portal provides the records
of confirmed cases and deaths obtained through the bulletins of the State Health
Secretariats.

Figure 4: Proposed method: Each of the Health Secretaruat of the 26 Brazilian states plus
the Distrito Federal (the autonomous disctrict in which is inserted the national capital) is
responsible for feeding a notification base. All of this information is available on Brazil.io.
Our Covid-SGIS software is updated daily with data from Brazil.io. A file in CSV format is
organized with the accumulated data. From them, training sets of the model can be formed.
After the ARIMA model training, the user can view the prediction of the number of cases and
deaths for each of the states, with a 6-day projection.

In this work, we selected data related to confirmed cases of Covid-19 for all
Brazil’ federative units. For each federative unit the records is from the first
date of confirmation of the disease until the last update on May 5, 2020.

3.3. ARIMA model
ARIMA models are classic models widely used to predict future behaviors
of stationary time series. ARIMA’s acronym indicates the combination of autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) models. The ”I” indicates the
model for the original undifferenced series, which was differenced d times until it became a stationary series before fitting the ARMA(p,q) process. In the
ARIMA(p, d, q) model, p and q correspond to the orders of the AR and MA
models, respectively, while the d corresponds to the level of differencing. The
equation 16 represents the mathematical expression of the model, where yt is the
differenced series, c and φ are the parameters of the model and ε is the random
error in time t (Chakraborty and Gosh, 2020; Hyndman and Athanasopoulos,
2018).
0
0
yt0 = c + φ1 yt−1
+ ... + φp yt−p
+ θ1 εt−1 + ... + θq εt−q + εt

(16)

The construction of the ARIMA model (p, d, q) occurs according to the
following steps (Chakraborty and Gosh, 2020; Hyndman and Athanasopoulos,
2018):
1. Evaluate the stationarity of the series (if it is not stationary, the differencing is applied util the stationarity is achieved);
2. Estimate the p and q parameters based on the autocorelation function
(ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots;.
3. Evaluate the best fitted forecasting model using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Baysian Information Criterion (BIC).
The function auto.arima() in the forecast package in R, automatically calculates the p, d and q parameters and returns a fitted model. The forecast()
function of this same package can be used to predict based on the model adjusted
by the auto.arima() function (Hyndman and Khandakar, 2008).
In this context, from the data collected regarding the accumulated number of
confirmed cases by state, we created a database corresponding to the historical
series of accumulated confirmed cases of Covid-19 for Brazil and each of its

federal units. We considered the period from the first notification date of the
disease until May 5, 2020. From this historical series of accumulated cases of
Covid-19, we built ARIMA models for each state, and for the Distrito Federal,
and for Brazil. These models were generated using the function auto.arima() of
R tool, version 3.6.3 3 . Each model built was used to carry out the projection
of the accumulated cases of the disease for 6 days, with a confidence interval of
95%. In order to evaluate the performance of the forecasts, we used accumulated
data from May 6 to 11, which were updated on May 13.
3.4. Metrics
We selected two metrics to evaluate the models: the correlation coefficient
and the Relative Quadratic Error (RMSE percentage). The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure between expected and predicted values. This value
varies from -1 to 1.. When it approaches 1, it indicates a strong positive correlation. When the correlation coefficient is close to -1, it indicates that the variables
have a strong negative correlation. And when the correlation coefficient is close
to zero, it indicates that there is no correlation between the variables (Witten
and Frank, 2005). The value of the correlation coefficient serves as global evaluator of the model, so it is possible to obtain a high correlation coefficient and
at the same time obtain high values for local errors. For this reason, it can
not be the only metric for assessing model performance. In order to avoid a
superficial evaluation of the regressors, whe chose the relative quadratic error as
an evaluation metric. The Equation 17 shows the expression of the calculation
of the relative quadratic error, where p is the predicted value and a is the actual
value.

4. Results
4.1. ARIMA forecasting
The models built were evaluated taking into account, as global quality, the
correlation coefficients of pearson, spearman and kendall. The relative quadratic
error (RMSE%) was used with a local quality metric. In this work, a high
correlation coefficient is considered to be above 0.9 and a low relative quadratic
error to be below 5%. The table 1 shows the evaluation metrics of the results
for the models using ARIMA.

is outside of the forcast interval and the absolute error** in between the lower
or upper limit is greater than 5%.
The results of the Table 2 show the results of the ARIMA models for the
Northeast Region of Brazil. For the states of Bahia, Maranhão, Piauı́ and Rio
Grande do Norte, the actual cases were within the range between the forecast
limits from 06 to 11 May. The ARIMA model for the State of Piauı́ showed
the best performance. The errors obtained, between the real cases and the
estimated cases, varied between 0.54% to 3.36%. On the other hand, the model
that had the worst performance for this region was the State of Sergipe. For
that state, from the six days of forecast, only the cases estimated for May 6
were within the forecast interval. On the remaining days, the real cases of the
accumulated cases of Covid-19 exceeded the maximum limits of the projections,
with errors (between the real cases and the maximum limits) of 8.52%, 12.39%,
14.16%, 15.09% and 8.77%.
Table 3 shows the forecasts results for all states in the Brazilian Northern
Region. The models that presented the best performance were the models for
the states of Amapá and Rondônia. For the six days of forecast the actual cases
were within the range between the minimum and maximum limits. The worst
performances were for the state of Roraima and Tocantins. For those states,
the errors between the actual cases and the minimum and maximum limits,
respectively, reached more than 55% and 25%.
The forecasts results for the states of the Midwest Region and the Distrito
Federal are presented in Table 4. The models referring to the states of Mato
Grosso do Sul and Goiás, presented the best performances for the region. In
the case of the State of Goiás, only the prediction for May 6, was not within the
forecast interval. However, the absolute percentage error between the actual
cases and the upper limit, did not exceed the 5% mark. In contrast, for the
State of Mato Grosso do Sul, the cumulative sum of the actual cases of Covid19 was not within the forecast interval. However, the errors considering the
actual cases and the upper limit, were not greater than 5%. On the other hand,

Federal presented a low performance. The last one being the one which showed
the worst model for the region. In which, from the 6 days of forecast, all of
them were outside the interval between the lower limit and the upper limit.
Additionaly, only the cumulative sum of the actual cases for May 6 obtained an
error below 5% in relation to the upper limit.
The results of the predictions for the states of the Southeast Region are
presented in the Table 5. Among the four models generated, only the model
from the State of Rio de Janeiro did not show a good performance. From the
six days of prediction, only two met the criteria of a good performace. For
the states of Espı́rito Santo and Minas Gerais, the forescasts for the six days
were within the forecast interval. In these two states, the absolute percentage
errors between the actual cases and the predicted values varied between 0.10%
and 5.36%, for the State of Espı́rito Santo, and between 0.03% and 5.74%, for
the State of Minas Gerais. The actual cases for the State of São Paulo, for
most of the forecast days, were outside the lower limit and upper limit interval.
However, for those days (May 6th to 10th), the errors between the actual cases
and the upper limits ranged from 2.40% to 3.57%.
The ARIMA models generated for the South Region, as shown in the Table
6, obtained good results for the forecasts of the cumulative sum of Covid-19
cases for this region. For both the State of Santa Catarina and the State of
Paraná, the actual cases were within the prediction interval and very close to
the estimated values. The absolute percentage errors between the real cases of
the Covid-19 accumulated cases for the two states varied between 0.26% and
3.21%, and 0.19% and 3.30%, respectively. In the case of the forecasts for Rio
Grande do Sul, the actual cases of May 8 and 9 are outside the prediction interval
range, however the errors between the actual case number and the upper limit
were 3.17% and 1.66%, respectively.
The results of the forecasts for Brazil are shown in the Table 7. From
May 6th to 10th, the actual cases were outside the prediction range (they were
higher than the upper limit). However, the absolute percentage error between
the upper limit and the actual cases did not exceed the 5% limit. On May 11,

The prototype of the developed system can be accessed by the link (https:
//www.cin.ufpe.br/~covidsgis). On the home screen, it is possible to visualize information about spatial predictions (Figure 10). The projections of
the cumulative cases of Covid-19 can be accessed in the ”More information”
option, in which the user will be directed to the page with the graphics. In
this screen, graphs of the temporal predictions, (Figure 10), as well as graphs
referring to the distribution of daily cases and deaths in Brazil (Figure 12) are
also available. In addition, it is available daily and cumulative cases (13), as
well as daily and cumulative deaths (14). For these graphs, the user can select
from which state they wish to evaluate these information. The software’s backend is freely available for non-commercial purpose on our Github repository:

5. Discussion
In this study, we evaluated the forecast of the cumulative cases of Covid-19
for Brazil, and its 27 federative units in Brazil, using ARIMA models in the
period between May 6 and 11. The results showed that, in general, for Brazil,
the cases of Covid-19 were still on the rise during the observed period, as shown
in the Figure 9. It shows the predictions of the accumulated cases of the disease
from 06 to 11 of May to 2020. This rise can be confirmed by analizing the actual
cases of Covid-19, for the same time period, in Table 7 which shows in detail
the growth of the number of cases. In addition, it is not possible to observe that
Brazil has reached the peak of the disease in this period, which was confirmed
in the results presented in the Table 7.
Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8 show the forecasts curves for each of the states showed
that the cases of Covid-19, in the observed period, were tending to increase.

This fact was confirmed with the results in the Section 4. Both for Brazil
and its federative units, the ARIMA models (p, d, q) managed to capture the
trends in the curves. This can be useful for health managers and governments
in promoting public policies to combat Covid-19.
The low performance of the predictions for some Brazilian states may be
associated with the underreporting of cases. That is, the amount of tests for
the diagnosis is not sufficient to meet the populational demand. Thus, people
who are asymptomatic or have symptoms of the disease, but have not been
tested, are not counted in the reported cases. This problem makes the data
substantial underestimated.
Another factor that may be associated with higher errors in the predictions
is the time taken to update the databases from the Departments of Health.
This directly affects the historical series of the states’ accumulated cases. As
the modeling using ARIMA, depends a lot on the historical series, this delay
in updating the databases, directly affect the real-time forecast. In addition,
high prediction errors can also be associated with the historical series itself. As
the day of the first notification varies from state to state, the amount of data
assessed by the model before making the prediction is also changed.
Besides that data in Brazil are probably substantial underestimates considering that Federal Government insists in sow fake news and discouraging the
social isolation (Prado, 2020). Another import issue is the social inequality of
the population. According to Prado (2020) 13 million Brazilians live in favelas
where it is common to have more than three people per room and the acess to
clean water is precarious.
Among the limitations of this study, we have the fact that, for the prediction, we only used the accumulated case history of Covid-19 for each of the 27
federative units. Therefore, factors related to probable virus mutations were
disregarded, as well as demographic information and risk factors.

6. Conclusion
Several countries are being greatly affected by the Covid-19 cases. With a
high number of infected people and public health systems operating at maximum capacity, the situation is becoming increasingly critical. For this reason,
it is important to have a tool that performs the prediction of Covid-19 cases,
able to aid government officials, health managers and general stakeholders to
ellaborate health policies and plan direct interventions. Therefore, it is possible
to make short-term decisions, develop public policies, and direct resources to
health professionals and hospitals. In addition, the forecasting tool can also assist governments in controlling measures of social isolation and lockdown. The
evaluation of these predictions allows to intensify the restrictions of social agglomerations, as well as to evaluate the effect of these measures in the contagion
of the population.
With that in mind, our motivation is to provide a robust, flexible and fast
forecasting method. Thus, we combined the ARIMA model for time series
analysis with Artificial Intelligence techniques. ARIMA was a good choice, being
efficient in predicting a disease like Covid-19, which has a rapid proliferation and
changes the scenario daily. The method is capable of presenting the prediction
if the context of the prediction moment remains constant, as well as presenting
the best and worst scenarios, with a confidence interval of 95%.
The developed models achieved a good performance taking into account the
percentage errors. Among the 26 Brazilian states analyzed plus Distrito Federal,
the majority presented satisfactory results, with low errors. Some states such as
Roraima, Tocantins and Distrito Federal showed higher errors. Some hypotheses
can be raised for this: many cases of Covid-19 are not reported, as in cases
of asymptomatic people or who remained in isolation at home; in addition,
database updates can be slow, directly affecting the prediction of the following
days. This fact becomes even worse when taking into account the measures
of the Brazilian Ministry of Health to limit testing to severe cases attested by
clinical diagnosis.

Besides that, a specific issue in Brazil is the lack of leadership and collaborative spirit on the part of the Federal Government. The absence of these characteristics fosters fear, insecurity, and misinformation among Brazilian citizens.
In this sense, the inaccurate information about Covid-19 itself is aggravated by
the huge amount of fake news spreading all over the country financed by the
person of the national president himself and his supporters. Despite that, State
and Municipal governments are struggling to maintain the social isolation and
provide more health care to the population, frequenly assuming responsibilities
of the central government.
Another fundamental challenge resides on the strong social inequality in
Brazil. Many Brazilian citizens do not have a fixed income. Since the Federal
Government is not being efficient to ensure their basic survival needs, these
people need to keep working. Therefore, making it difficult to implement social isolation policies and, consequently, increasing the size of the susceptible
population and the circulation of asymptomatic individuals.
Finally, our method provides a possibility of dynamic forecasting: the proposed model is retrained and adapted to the real scenario in a daily basis. The
proposed model is trained everyday with a maximum window of three days,
achieving low errors in most predictions, and acceptable errors (inside the confidence interval) in the worst scenarios. This forecasting window is dynamic, since
it is chosen by automatic ARIMA models. Another advantage of our proposal
is the use of multiple databases. In this way, several countries can benefit from
this solution, adapting the model to their databases, incorporating dedicated
web crawlers, for instance. Our system can be an important tool to guide the
course of this pandemic.
