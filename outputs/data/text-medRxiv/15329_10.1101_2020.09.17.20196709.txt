Abstract
Background: Assessing the impact of vital signs (blood pressure, body temperature,
heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) on the death of patients with new
coronavirus pneumonia would provide a simple and convenient method for the
monitoring of subsequent illness, and therefore, in some degree reduce treatment costs
and increase the cure rate clinically.
Methods: Six databases were retrieved. The software R 3.6.2 was used for
meta-analysis of the included literature.
Results: 12 studies were included, which comprise 8996 patients affected with
COVID-19 infection. The meta-analysis study found that blood pressure (MAP, SBP
and DBP), heart rate, respiration rate and SpO2 are the risk factors for disease
progression in patients with COVID-19. Among them, the increase in MAP and the
decrease in SpO2 have the greatest impact on the death of patients with COVID-19
[MAP: MD = 5.66, 95% CI (0.34, 10.98), SpO2: MD = -5.87, 95% CI (-9.17, -2.57),
P = 0.0005]. However, comparing the body temperature of the death group and the
survival group found that the body temperature was not statistically significant
between the two groups [body temperature: MD = 0.21, 95% CI (-0.01, 0.43), P =
0.0661].
Conclusion: The increase in MAP, heart rate and respiratory rate, as well as the
decrease in SBP, DBP and SpO2 are all independent risk factors for death in patients
with COVID-19. These factors are simple and easy to monitor, and individualized
treatment can be given to patients in time, reducing the mortality rate and improving
treatment efficiency.

Background
In December 2019, a case of novel coronavirus pneumonia cause was reported in
Wuhan, China

. With the strong ability of transmission, the virus affects a wide

[1-2]

range and propagates rapidly to other provinces and countries
report of Wang et al.

[3-5]

. According to the

, the number of new coronaviruses diagnosed and died has

[6]

been higher than that of SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in
2003 and 2013 respectively. As of July 19, a total of 14284831 cases had been
confirmed in 215 countries and regions, accounting for overall 602239 death and a
high mortality rate of 4.22%. Strong spreading ability and large number of deaths

have caused significant harm to human health and social economy. Many risk factors
have been determined to be responsible for the death of the COVID-19 patients [7-10];
however, the exact cause of death in the clinical treatment remains to be elucidated.
As far as the prevention and treatment of the disease that is concerned, it is currently
necessary to determine the factors that concisely and quickly predict the death of
patients.
Meta-analysis, reviewing the published literature data, is a method to determine
the risk factors in this paper. Meta-analysis execute a secondary analysis to expand the
sample size, minimize the limitations of a single small sample clinical trial, to
generate more comprehensive and reliable analysis results, thereby facilitating a better
platform for medical decision-making. Therefore, it is an indispensable statistical
method to determine the factors affecting the death of patients with COVID-19. Some
literatures only analyze the impact of a certain disease or lifestyle on the death of
patients with COVID-19. For example, Zhang et al.

[11]

studied the impact of the

prevalence of hypertension on the death of patients with COVID-19, Vardavas et al.
[12]

analyzed the relationship between smoking and the adverse outcome of COVID-19.

Vrsalovic et al. [13] used troponin to predict the death of COVID-19 patients. There are
also some literatures that comprehensively analyzed multiple influencing factors, but
there were only Chinese patients in these literatures, which caused a certain degree of
one-sidedness. For example, Zheng et al.

[14]

conducted a comprehensive analysis of

13 Chinese literatures. analysis. And most of the current research results are about the
basic demographic characteristics of patients and potential diseases. These factors
could not be changed in generally, so that the symptoms could not be improved in the
clinical cure. Although laboratory test results can predict the patient’s condition, they
have certain delay, and it takes a long time and costs higher.
Analyzing comprehensively for most of the risk factors (vital signs) that affect
the prognosis of COVID-19 patients, could reduce the mortality and give a reference
for the surveillance of the of COVID-19 patients. So, in this paper, as many foreign
patients as possible were included, which avoided the paper’s one-sideness, and the
risk factors about vital signs

( blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate,

respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation), which were simpler and more convenient
then experimental tests in the lab, were analyzed.

The MINORS

[15]

was applied to assess bias risk. There are 12 entries in this

standard, each of which gets a score of 0 to 2, in which 0 represents unreported, 1
designates reported but insufficient information, and 2 signifies reported and provided
sufficient information. The greater the total score of each item, the higher the quality
of the literature. Among them, a score of ≥ 19 is classified as high quality, 13-18 as
medium quality, and ≤ 12 as low quality. Studies with scores lower than 12 were
excluded from the final meta-analysis. The process of literature evaluation was
compiled by two researchers independently and in case of disagreement, by the third
researcher.
Statistical Analysis of Data
Statistical analysis of the data was carried out with the help of R 3.6.2 software.
The results of the included studies were performed with fixed-effect models
(Mantel–Haenszel method) or random effect models in the cases of significant
heterogeneity between studies. We used I2 and Q tests to test the heterogeneity of the
included literature. No statistical heterogeneity was considered if p > 0.10 or I2 < 50%,
and the fixed-effect model, i.e., Mantel–Haenszel method (M-H method), was used
for analysis. If 0.05 < p < 0.10 and I2 > 50%, or p ≤ 0.05, there was statistical
heterogeneity. The source of heterogeneity was first analyzed, and a low-quality study
with large bias was excluded, and the combined effect size was computed again. Even
after the above treatment, if the results of multiple studies still displayed
heterogeneity, the random effect model, namely, the Dersimonian-Laird method (D-L
method), was applied for meta-analysis. In order to increase the number of studies,
according to the Cochrane 4.2 user manual, when the sample size was large (n ≥ 30),
the median was used as the mean value, SD = (upper-lower limit)/1.35, and the data
from the included literature were analyzed using mean and SD. Test level, α = 0.05.

Results
Research Selection and Quality Assessment
Based on the search strategy, 251 studies were screened from the online database.
A total of 175 records were retained after removing duplicate records. Thereafter, 119
articles were excluded by the titles and abstracts, and 43 of the remaining 56 articles
were deleted for various reasons, and we were left with 13 articles. According to the
literature quality evaluation, 12 articles of 3493 patients [16–28] were ultimately selected
for the meta-analysis (Figure 1). All these selected studies were published in 2020
with varying sample sizes ranging from 20 to 7614 patients. The risk of bias and

applicability concerns for the included studies are detailed in Table 1. According to
the MINORS assessment, none of the studies was considered to be seriously flawed.
The score of the 12 included studies ranged between 18 and 22. Thus all studies were
considered to have a low risk of bias for selection.

Blood pressure
The demographic characteristics of the included literature were illustrated in
Table 1 for meta-analysis. The median age ranged from 51.0 to 86.0 years for the
patients in the death group, whereas 40.3 to 89.0 years for the survivor group.
Heterogeneity test was performed initially, the relevant literature has no statistical
heterogeneity in MAP(Mean artery pressure) and SBP(Systolic blood pressure), but
there is statistical heterogeneity between DBP(Diastolic blood pressure)-related
literature (MAP: p = 0.80, I2 = 0%; SBP: p = 0.10, I2 = 49%; DBP: p = 0.03, I2 =
58%;). Therefore, the fixed-effect model is used for meta-analysis of MAP and SBP,
while the analysis of DBP uses the random effects model. The results showed that the
MAP value of the death group was significantly higher than that of the survival group,
while SBP and DBP were significantly lower than the survival group, and the
differences were statistically significant [MAP: MD = 5.66, 95% CI (0.34, 10.98), P =
0.0371; SBP: MD = -2.30, 95% CI (-3.80, -0.80), P = 0.0027; DBP: MD = -3.00, 95%
CI (-5.51, -0.48), P = 0.0194] (Figure 2).

comparison of the incidence of MAP, SBP and DBP in death group and survivor group.

Body temperature

The prevalence of body temperature included in the literature was considered in
the meta-analysis to elucidate their impact on the death of COVID-19. Estimation of
the heterogeneity of the selected articles showed that there was not any statistical
heterogeneity among the literature related to body temperature (p = 0.74, I2 = 0%).
Thus, for further investigation, the fixed-effect model was implemented. Statistical
analysis showed that the body temperature of the death group was higher than that of
the survival group, but the difference between the two groups was not statistically
significant [body temperature: MD = 0.21, 95% CI (-0.01, 0.43), P = 0.0661] (Figure
3).
In order to further analyze whether body temperature has an impact on the death
of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia, this article conducted a meta-analysis of
the proportion of the dead group and the survival group with a body temperature of >
39°C. First, the heterogeneity test found that there are heterogeneous differences
between the relevant documents (p < 0.701, I2 = 79%), so the random effects model is
used for analysis. The analysis results showed that the proportion of patients with
body temperature (> 39°C) in the death group was lower than that in the survival
group, but the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant
[body temperature (> 39°C): OR = 0.82, 95% CI (0.18, 3,77), P = 0.8017] (Figure 3).

Heart rate
To determine the effect of the heart rate as a risk factor for death of patients
suffering from COVID-19, a meta-analysis was performed on the vital signs of the
deaths and the survivors of 8 included articles (with a total amount of 8544 patients).
The fixed-effect model could be used for analysis as there was no statistical
heterogeneity of heart rate among the pertinent literature (p = 0.11, I2 = 40%) based on
the heterogeneity test. The heart rate of the death group was considered to be
significantly higher than that of the survivor group [heart rate: MD = 2.33, 95% CI
(1.20, 3.46), P < 0.0001] (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Meta-analysis for heart rate in COVID-19 cases. Heterogeneity analysis was carried out
using Q test for the variation among the studies (I2 index). Forest plots depicted the comparison of
the incidences of heart rate in the death group and survivor group.

Respiratory rate
Meta-analysis was also executed on the respiratory rate manifested by the two
groups of COVID-19 patients- death and survivor- in the included 6 literature.
Statistically significant heterogeneity among the literature related to respiratory rate (p
= 0.11, I2 = 45%) was absent as per the heterogeneity test, so the fixed-effect model
was applied for meta-analysis. Statistical evaluation verified that the respiratory rate
of the death group was significantly higher than that of the survival group, and there
was statistical significance [respiratory rate: MD = 2.66, 95% CI (1.49, 3.83), P =
0.0048] (Figure 5).

comparison of the incidences of respiratory rate in the death group and survivor group.

Oxygen saturation (SpO2)
Analyze the difference in SpO2 between the death group and the survival group
in the 6 included literatures to determine the impact of blood oxygen saturation on the
death of patients with COVID-19 Heterogeneity inspection results to SpO2 (P < 0.01,
I2 = 91%) estimated there were heterogeneity differences among related to literature,
so the random effects model was adopted for meta-analysis. The outcomes of
statistical analysis witnessed the SpO2 of the death group were significantly lower
than that of the survivor group [SpO2: MD = -5.87, 95% CI (-9.17, -2.57), P = 0.0005]
(Figure 6).

Discussion
Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is another serious threat to public health
after SARS, Ebola, and avian flu. Owing to its fast transmissibility through
respiratory droplets and close contact, the virus is extremely infectious and pathogenic
, thereby making COVID-19 a global concern within a short period. This article

[28-29]

mainly conducts a meta-analysis of the impact of vital signs on the death of patients
with COVID-19, and evaluates the impact of vital signs on the prognosis of
COVID-19. To facilitate the monitoring of changes in the condition of COVID-19
patients, provide personalized treatment, reduce the mortality rate, and increase
treatment benefits.
This study reported that the MAP of deaths from COVID-19 was higher than that
of survivors, while SBP and DBP were lower than those of survivors. The results

showed that the MD values of MAP, SDP, and DBP of the death group were 5.66,
-2.30, -3.00, and all of them were statistically significant. This shows that the increase
in MAP and the decrease in SDP and DBP will increase the risk of death from
COVID-19. According to previous studies

, it has been found that patients with

[30-32]

COVID-19 will have complications such as shock and acute myocardial injury, and
the proportion of complications in the death group is higher than that in the survival
group, and these will cause the patient's systolic and arterial pressure to drop. Blood
pressure measurement is relatively simple and convenient, and detecting changes in
blood pressure can give patients personalized treatment early and reduce the mortality
rate.
Body temperature is one of the variables included in the pneumonia severity
index [33] and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)

. In this study, a

[34]

meta-analysis of the body temperature of the death group and the survival group
included in 4 literatures showed that the body temperature of the death group was
higher than that of the death group, but the difference between the two was not
statistically significant. Fever is the most common symptoms of patients with
COVID-19 infection and the research factor with the highest incidence of initial
symptoms in admitted patients. Therefore, the difference in body temperature between
the two groups was not significant. Fever is a general clinical feature of patients with
COVID-19 on admission. Therefore, most patients will have symptoms of fever and
have different body temperatures. In order to further study whether body temperature
will affect the prognosis of patients with COVID-19, this article discusses the death
group and The proportion of body temperature > 39°C in the survival group was
analyzed, and it was found that the proportion of body temperature > 39°C in the
death group was lower than that in the survival group, but the difference between the
two groups was not statistically significant. Some studies found that low body
temperature at the initial presentation is a marker of poor prognosis, and high
maximum temperature during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection was a significant
harbinger of poor outcomes

[24]

. Therefore, body temperature has a great influence on

the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. The patient's body temperature should be
monitored regularly at an early stage, and personalized treatment should be given
early to improve treatment benefits.
The heart rate of the patients was examined, and the MD value of the heart rate
of the deceased was equal to 2.33 compared with that of the survivor group. This

indicated increased death risk of the patients with accelerated heart. Accelerated heart
rate indicates the damage of myocardial energy supply, and one of the complications
of patients with COVID-19 is acute myocardial injury. Study has shown that in
addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), systemic inflammation with
cardiac dysfunction is the main cause of death from severe COVID-19

. So early

[23]

detection of changes in heart rate and prevention of complications can decrease the
mortality of the disease.
This study found that the respiratory rate of the COVID-19 death group was
greater than of the survival group, and SpO2 was lower than that of the survival group.
Compared with the survival group, the MD values of respiratory rate and SpO2 in the
death group were 2.66 and -5.87, respectively. An increase in respiratory rate and a
decrease in SpO2 indicates lung damage.Studies have found that the Sars-Cov2 cell
entry receptor is located mainly in the lungs, more than half of patients might develop
dyspnea, and >10% might require ventilatory support [35-37]. With acute hypoxia being
the main determinant of disease progression and severity, the SpO2 of admission is
crucial for death risk stratifification

. Therefore, an increase in respiratory rate and

[25]

a decrease in SpO2 will indicate lung function damage, worsening of the disease, and
death. Monitoring methods of respiratory rate and SpO2 are simple and convenient.
And can be used as predictors of poor prognosis for patients with COVID-19.
Improve clinical symptoms as soon as possible, prevent complications, and improve
treatment benefits.

Conclusion
In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to study the impact of the vital signs
of patients with COVID-19 on their death. The results found that the increase in MAP,
heart rate and respiratory rate, as well as the decrease in SBP, DBP and SpO2 are all
independent risk factors for death in patients with COVID-19. Monitoring methods
for these factors are simple and convenient, which can reduce medical costs and
increase treatment benefits. Thus individualized treatment should be given in time and
attention should be paid to the risk factors, to improve the efficacy and reduce the
mortality.
