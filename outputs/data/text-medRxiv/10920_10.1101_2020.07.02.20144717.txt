Abstract

2

Background The effect of using Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and

3

Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) on the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

4

is a topic of recent debate. Although studies have examined the potential association between

5

them, the results remain controversial. This study aims to determine the true effect of

6

ACEI/ARBs use on the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19.

7

Methods Five electronic databases (PubMed, Web of science, Cochrane library, China

8

National Knowledge Infrastructure database, medRxiv preprint server) were retrieved to find

9

eligible studies. Meta-analysis was performed to examine the association between

10

ACEI/ARBs use and the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19.

11

Results 22 articles containing 157,328 patients were included. Use of ACEI/ARBs was not

12

associated with increased risk of infection (Adjusted OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.01, I2=5.8%)

13

or increased severity (Adjusted OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.77-1.05, I2=27.6%) of COVID-19. The

14

use of ACEI/ARBs was associated with lower risk of death from COVID-19 (Adjusted OR:

15

0.66, 95% CI: 0.44-0.99, I2=57.9%). Similar results of reduced risk of death were also found

16

for ACEI/ARB use in COVID-19 patients with hypertension (Adjusted OR: 0.36, 95% CI:

17

0.17-0.77, I2=0).

18

Conclusion This study provides evidence that ACEI/ARBs use for COVID-19 patients does

19

not lead to harmful outcomes and may even provide a beneficial role and decrease mortality

20

from COVID-19. Clinicians should not discontinue ACEI/ARBs for patients diagnosed with

21

COVID-19 if they are already on these agents.

1. Introduction

6

In December 2019, the first case of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by

7

the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan,

8

China [1, 2]. Due to the rapidly increasing number of cases worldwide, on March 11, 2020,

9

the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic

10

As of June 3, 2020, there were 6, 287, 771 confirmed cases and 379, 941 deaths globally per

11

WHO [3]. COVID-19 has greatly impacted both professional and personal lives of everyone

12

worldwide.

13

The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been well described

14

in previous studies [4, 5]. Hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD)

15

including congestive heart failure (CHF) and myocardial infarction are common

16

comorbidities reported in patients with COVID-19 and have been associated with a poor

17

prognosis

18

Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) are first line anti-hypertensive medications and are

19

included in the guideline-directed therapy for diabetic nephropathy, CHF and myocardial

20

infarction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a membrane-bound aminopeptidase, is

21

widely expressed in certain tissues of human body including lung, intestine, heart, and

[5,

6].

kidneys, and it has been shown that the use of ACEIs and ARBs can increase the expression

2

of ACE2 [7, 8]. Furthermore, ACE2 acts as a functional receptor and SARS-CoV-2 utilizes

3

the ACE2 for attachment of its spike protein, in the process of its entrance into cells [9,10].

4

These findings led some investigators to hypothesize that the use of ACEIs or ARBs may

5

increase the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-19 [11-13].

6

Several clinical studies have been conducted to test this hypothesis. However, a

7

consensus has not been reached regarding how the use of ACEIs or ARBs affects the outcome

8

of patients with COVID-19. The goal of this meta-analysis is to clarify the effects of ACEIs

9

and/or ARBs on the infection risk, severity, and mortality of COVID-19, hoping to shed more

10

light in the prevention and treatment of the current ongoing pandemic.

2.1 Literature search and data source

17

We searched five electronic databases (PubMed, Web of science, Cochrane library,

18

China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, medRxiv preprint server) to collect

19

relevant studies published until May 20, 2020. The search strategy was established and

20

ARB) AND (coronavirus OR COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2). There was no language

2

limitation on the search. All references of included studies were evaluated for additional

3

studies to include as many eligible studies as possible. For retrieved records, we used

4

reference management software (NoteExpress, college version) to save and filter.

2.2 Study selection

7

First, we reviewed the title and abstract of retrieved studies and excluded irrelevant ones.

8

Then, we read through the full-text of remaining studies and included eligible studies based

9

on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Our inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) participants

10

were patients diagnosed with COVID-19; (2) patients were reported as having ACEI and/or

11

ARB exposure and non-ACEI and/or ARB exposure (ACEI use versus non-ACEI use; ARB

12

use versus non-ARB use; ACEI/ARB use versus non-ACEIARB use); (3) at least one of

13

following outcomes of COVID-19 was reported: positive rate/infection rate, hospital

14

admission rate, severity, mortality in groups of ACEI and/or ARB exposure and non-ACEI

15

and/or ARB exposure or the association between ACEI and/or ARB exposure and the risk of

16

infection, hospital admission, severity, and death due to COVID-19; (4) the study design was

17

case-control or cohort. Exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) the studies were reviews,

18

case-reports, or animal experiments; (2) studies did not meet the inclusion criteria; (4) The

19

data of interest was not reported; (4) no clear definition or diagnose methods of COVID-19.

20

Two authors (Guangbo Qu and Liqin Shu) conducted the selections independently, and any

21

disagreement was solved through discussion.

2.3 Data extraction and quality assessment

3

Following information was extracted using a standard chart form: first author’s name,

4

number of patients, number of patients in ACEI/ARB exposure (only ACEI exposure, only

5

ARB exposure, either ACEI or ARB exposure) and non-exposure groups, patients’

6

characteristics, infection risk, hospital admission, severity, and mortality of patients in each

7

group, odds ratios (ORs) or risk ratios (RRs) or hazard ratio (HRs) of the infection, hospital

8

admission, severity, and mortality of COVID-19.

9

Considering that the included studies were observational studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa

10

Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality from three aspects: (1) selection of participants;

11

(2) comparability of groups; (3) assessment of exposure and outcome [15]. NOS contained

12

eight items with scores ranging from 0 to 9 stars. The quality of studies was divided into three

13

categories based on the scores: low quality is 0-3 stars, moderate quality is 4-5 stars, and high

14

quality is 6 stars or above. Two authors (Guangbo Qu and Liqin Shu) assessed quality

15

independently, and disagreement was resolved by consensus.

16
17

3. Statistical analysis

18

Meta-analyses were conducted to assess for associations. Crude and adjusted odds ratios

19

(Crude OR and Adjusted OR), with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, were calculated

20

using the extracted binary data or effect sizes that was reported in all studies. Additionally, if

21

available, Crude OR and/or Adjusted OR were also calculated to explore the association

between ACEI/ARB use and outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with hypertension. The

2

statistical heterogeneity between studies was identified using the Cochrane’s Q test and

3

I-square test. Heterogeneity was present if P value of Q test was less than 0.1 or the value of

4

I2 was more than 50% [16]. The model for meta-analyses was chosen based on the level of

5

heterogeneity between studies; if obvious heterogeneity was present, then random-effects

6

model was used, otherwise, the fix-effects model was used [17]. Subgroup analysis was

7

conducted based on the characteristics of included studies. Publication bias was identified via

8

Begg’s and Egger’s tests. If P value of Begg’s and Egger’s tests were more than 0.05, then

9

publication bias is present. Sensitivity analysis was performed by omitting studies one by one

10

to assess the stability of pooled results. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA

11

software (version 14.0) and Review Manager (version 5.3).

4.1 Characteristics of included studies

15

After initial search, 477 records were retrieved (PubMed: n=166, Web of science: n=228,

16

Cochrane library: n=9, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database: n=27, medRxiv

17

preprint server: n=41, Other sources: n=6). 27 records were excluded for duplication. After

18

reading the titles and abstracts, 391 records were excluded due to irrelevance. After study

19

selection according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 36 articles were excluded and one

20

study was further excluded because it was retracted by the journal. Finally, 22 articles

21

containing 157,328 patients were included in this meta-analysis [8, 10, 18-37]. The flow chart

The characteristics of included studies were shown in Table 1. Of included studies, 11

3

were conducted in China [8,16,20,21,22,24,25,27,33,35,36], six were from the United States

4

[19,23,29,32,34,37], two were from Italy [10,30], one from Spain [26], one from United

5

Kingdom [28], and one from Belgium [31]. All, but three, were cohort studies. The sample

6

size of each study ranged from 42 to 37,031. Multiple comorbidities were reported and all

7

patients in eight of the studies had hypertension [8,18,22,25,27,32,33,37]. Majority of the

8

studies were high quality studies. Detailed quality assessment results are in Table S1.

4.2 ACEI/ARB use and COVID-19 infection

11

Pooled meta-analyses showed that, without adjusting for any confounders, ACEI, ARB,

12

and ACEI/ARB use were not significantly associated with the risk of COVID-19 infection

13

(Crude OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 0.95-1.69 for ACEI use; Crude OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.76-1.50 for

14

ABR use; Crude OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.84-1.43 for ACEI/ARB use); however, obvious

15

heterogeneity was present between studies (All I2 >50%) (Table 2, Figure 2). Similarly, after

16

adjusting for confounders, ACEI, ARB, and ACEI/ARB use were not significantly associated

17

with the risk of COVID-19 infection (Adjusted OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.87-1.01, I2=0 for ACEI

18

use; Adjusted OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.49-1.09, I2=95.1% for ABR use; Adjusted OR: 0.96, 95%

19

CI: 0.91-1.01, I2=5.8% for ACEI/ARB use). Furthermore, subgroup analysis based on

20

different characteristics of studies showed no correlation between the use of ACEI and/or

21

ARB and risk of COVID-19 infection.

4.3 ACEI/ARB use and hospital admission for COVID-19

3

Pooled meta-analyses showed that patients using ACEI, ARB, and ACEI/ARB had

4

higher risk of hospital admission for COVID-19 compared to patients not using these

5

medications (Adjusted OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.07-1.57, I2=62.4% for ACEI use; Adjusted OR:

6

1.69, 95% CI: 1.46-1.96, I2=0 for ABR use; Adjusted OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.21-1.57, I2=34.5%

7

for ACEI/ARB use) (Table 2 and Figure 3).

8
9

4.4 ACEI/ARB use and severity of COVID-19

10

Use of ACEI, ARB, and ACEI/ARB was not associated with severity of COVID-19

11

infection for both pooled crude and adjusted OR (Adjusted OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.72-1.14,

12

I2=0 for ACEI use; Adjusted OR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.74-1.13, I2=45.8% for ABR use; Adjusted

13

OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.77-1.05, I2=27.6% for ACEI/ARB use). Additionally, subgroup analysis

14

based on different characteristics (study design, region, race, study quality) also did not show

15

any significant association (Table 2 and Figure 4). Furthermore, for patients with

16

hypertension, ACEI, ARB, and ACEI/ARB use was not significantly associated with severity

17

of COVID-19 infection (Table S2).

18
19

4.5 ACEI/ARB use and COVID-19 related mortality

20

Only one study reported the association between ACEI and ARB use and risk of death

21

from COVID-19 without adjusting confounders separately (OR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.38-2.17 for

ACEI use; OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.41-1.43 for ABR use) [18]. Only one study reported no

2

significant association between ACEI use and risk of death from COVID-19 (OR: 0.97, 95%

3

CI: 0.69-1.34) [30]. The pooled crude OR showed no significant association between

4

ACEI/ARB use and risk of death from COVID-19 (Crude OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.66-1.18,

5

I2=60.9%). However, the pooled adjusted ORs showed that patients on ACEI/ARB had a

6

lower risk of death from COVID-19 (Adjusted OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.44-0.99, I2=57.9%). No

7

study reported the association between ARB use and the risk of death from COVID-19 (Table

8

2 and Figure 5). Furthermore, subgroup analysis on studies from China or studies of Asian

9

population found that ACEI/ARB use was associated with a lower risk of death from

10

COVID-19. For patients with hypertension, ACEI/ARB use also was associated with a lower

11

risk of death from COVID-19 (Adjusted OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.17-0.77, I2=0) (Table S3).

12
13

4.6 Publication bias and results of sensitivity analysis

14

There was no significant publication bias among meta-analyses with two or more studies

15

included (All P values were more than 0.05) based on Begg’s and Egger’s tests (Table S4).

16

Sensitivity analysis showed that no study had significant impact on the stability of pooled

17

results from meta-analyses.

5. Discussion

20

The effect of ACEI/ARB use on COVID-19 patients has been a controversial topic since

21

the beginning of this pandemic. Based on prior studies on the effect of ACEI/ARBs on ACE2

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.02.20144717; this version posted July 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

expression [7, 38, 39], it was initially hypothesized that increased expression of ACE2 from

2

ACEI/ARB may increase the risk of SARS-COV-2 entrance into respiratory epithelial cells

3

through binding to the structural transmembrane ACE2 receptor. Therefore, ACEI/ARB may

4

theoretically increase the susceptibility of infection and lead to worse outcomes from

5

COVID-19 [11, 40]. However, even though elevated expression of ACE2 caused by

6

ACEI/ARB use has been found in animal studies [7, 38, 39], no evidence has indicated

7

similar effects in human studies. Many studies have been published in the recent months

8

attempting to better understand the effects of ACEI/ARB in COVID-19 patients [8, 10, 19, 29,

9

30].

10

Our systematic review and meta-analysis shows that ACEI/ARBs use is not significantly

11

associated with increased infection risk and severity of COVID-19 and is actually associated

12

with a decreased risk of death from COVID-19. However, it does lead to an increased risk of

13

hospital admissions. The increased risk of hospitalization admissions in patients on

14

ACEI/ARB should be interpreted with caution because in the included studies, residual

15

confounding factors such as comorbidities like CVD were not well adjusted for [19, 30].

16

Patients who are taking ACEI/ARB likely have underlying cardiovascular comorbidities and

17

prior studies demonstrated that patient comorbidities including hypertension and CVD are

18

associated with severe COVID-19 infections, requiring hospitalization, and increased

19

mortality [41, 42]. Therefore, additional large, prospective, randomized studies are needed to

20

better characterize the effect of ACEI/ARB use on rate of hospitalization of COVID-19

21

patients.

Interestingly, the pooled crude ORs did not show significant association between

2

ACEI/ARB use and the risk of death from COVID-19, but after pooling the adjusted ORs,

3

ACEI/ARB use was associated with a decreased risk of death from COVID-19 in all patients

4

and in those with hypertension. However, the crude OR did not found a significant

5

association of ACEI use and the risk of death from COVID-19. This difference seen bet the

6

crude and adjusted ORs is likely because some important confounders were adjusted for

7

adjusted ORs, which may reflect the true association between ACEI/ARB use and risk of

8

death from COVID-19. Additionally, none of the studies reported the association between

9

ARB use and risk of death from COVID-19; therefore, pooled adjusted OR for ARBs was not

10

calculated.

11

ACEI/ARBs are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension and CHF to inhibit

12

Angiotensin II and downregulate the Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) [43].

13

The decreased risk of death is likely due to continued management of patients’ existing

14

underlying diseases as poorly controlled hypertension and CHF are both associated with

15

worse outcomes in COVID-19 patients [44]. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory and

16

immune-modulatory properties of ACEI/ARBs may also explain their protective effect.

17

Heightened inflammatory response is an important factor leading to adverse outcomes of

18

COVID-19 patients [45]. Previously, it has been shown that Angiotensin II increases

19

expression of inflammatory cytokines via activation of Angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R)

20

[46]. ACEI/ARB decreases the level of Angiotensin II, potentially attenuating the

21

inflammatory response. Additionally, ACEI/ARB reduces T-cell depletion in peripheral blood

and inhibits dendritic cell maturation and Th1 and Th17 cell polarization, resulting in a more

2

potent immune system [47]. This hypothesis is supported in the study by Meng et al, in which

3

it was demonstrated that ACEI/ARB use in COVID-19 patients was associated with lower

4

IL-6 level, increased CD3 and CD8 T-cell counts, and decreased peak viral load [25].

5

This systemic review and meta-analysis comprehensively explored the effect of

6

ACEI/ARB use on infection risk and different clinical outcomes related to COVID-19. Our

7

study is consistent with results from prior studies on this topic, where they also demonstrated

8

that ACEI/ARB use does not increase the severity of COVID-19 infection and decreases

9

mortality [48-50]. Additionally, we also included information not available in previous

10

systemic reviews such as the association between ACEI/ARB use and hospitalization due to

11

COVID-19. This study helps to shed light into the current debate on the use of ACEI/ARBs

12

in patients with COVID-19 and demonstrates that ACEI/ARB use does not lead to increased

13

risk of COVID-19 infection and may even decrease the risk of death from COVID-19. The

14

results from this study supports the joint statement from American Heart Association (AHA),

15

Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) and

16

the statement from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Council on Hypertension that

17

patients with COVID-19 taking ACEI/ARBs should continue their treatment [51].

18

A few limitations present in our study should be noted. First, all the studies included are

19

observational studies, making it difficult to infer accurate causation. Second, no data was

20

provided regarding the dose and exposure duration of ACEI/ARBs; therefore, we could not

21

determinate whether COVID-19 infection is affected by the dose and duration of ACEI/ARBs

exposure. Third, beta blockers can also prevent ACE2 activity [52], therefore, the effect of

2

ACEI/ARB use may be underestimated for patients with CVD who also take beta blockers.

3

Finally, given that some important confounders (such as comorbidities) have not been

4

adjusted for in the included studies, the true association between ACEI/ARB use and the risk

5

of hospitalization could not be well inferred.

Conclusion

8

In conclusion, ACEI/ARB use does not affect the risk and severity of COVID-19

9

infection and actually leads to a decreased mortality from COVID-19. The effect of

10

ACEI/ARB use on hospitalization needs to be further assessed with adjusting for potential

11

confounders. The potential protective role of ACEI/ARB supports the recommendation that

12

these agents should not be discontinued for COVID-19 patients if they are already on them.
