Abstract
Background​: Substantial limitations have been imposed on passenger air travel to
reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between regions and countries. However, as case
numbers decrease, air travel will gradually resume. We considered a future scenario in
which case numbers are low and air travel returns to normal. Under that scenario, there
will be a risk of outbreaks in locations worldwide due to imported cases. We estimated
the risk of different locations acting as sources of future COVID-19 outbreaks
elsewhere.
Methods​: We use modelled global air travel data and population density estimates from
locations worldwide to analyse the risk that 1364 airports are sources of future
COVID-19 outbreaks. We use a probabilistic, branching-process based approach that

considers the volume of air travelers between airports and the reproduction number at
each location, accounting for local population density.
Results​: Under the scenario we model, we identify airports in East Asia as having the
highest risk of acting as sources of future outbreaks. Moreover, we investigate the
locations most likely to cause outbreaks due to air travel in regions that are large and
potentially vulnerable to outbreaks: India, Brazil and Africa. We find that outbreaks in
India and Brazil are most likely to be seeded by individuals travelling from within those
regions. We find that this is also true for less vulnerable regions, such as the United
States, Europe, and China. However, outbreaks in Africa due to imported cases are
instead most likely to be initiated by passengers travelling from outside the continent.
Conclusions​: Variation in flight volumes and destination population densities create a
non-uniform distribution of the risk that different airports pose of acting as the source of
an outbreak. Accurate quantification of the spatial distribution of outbreak risk can
therefore facilitate optimal allocation of resources for effective targeting of public health
interventions.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been spreading rapidly since early cases
were detected in Wuhan, China at the end of December 2019.​1​ On March 11, the WHO
declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic;​2​ i.e. it is now deemed to be on a global
scale, with significant autochthonous transmission in different countries. The
implications that such a declaration can have are that tackling the COVID-19 pandemic
might require international coordination and collaboration.​3
To date, COVID-19 cases have been observed in over 100 territories, in all inhabited
continents.​4​ Such a pervasive spread is partly a consequence of the innate
transmissibility of the virus, which is expressed by the relatively high basic reproduction
number point estimates ranging from 1.4 to as high as 6.5 (with uncertainty bounds
providing an even wider range).​5,6​ However, an additional prominent reason for the
especially wide and rapid spread of COVID-19 is likely to be the current high prevalence
of international air travel, which has rapidly increased during the last decades. 7​
Moreover, air travel might have an interaction with the clinical characteristics of
COVID-19, increasing the potential of the virus to spread. Although various other

infectious diseases have caused epidemics through air travel,​8–10​ none, barring
influenza, have had as wide a global spread as COVID-19. Likely factors affecting this
significant scale of transmission are the respiratory nature of the disease and a high
frequency of presymptomatic (and, probably, to a lesser extent asymptomatic)
infectors.​11​ Both factors, which apply to influenza as well,​14​ are hypothesized to help the
spread through air travel.​12,13
Although the spread of COVID-19 through maritime transport has received substantial
media coverage due to significant transmission on the ​Diamond Princess​ and other
cruise ships,​14​ most imported cases outside China have likely originated from air
travel.​15​ These have spurred the applications of various outbreak control measures
regarding air travel, including air travel restrictions, and quarantining individuals
returning via air travel from specific countries, or regardless of their departure
locations.​16​ Consequently, sharp decreases in flight volumes have been observed,​15​ in
contrast with previous projections of a continuous increase in global air travel.​17
However, such outbreak control measures are non-selective, and are hence costly,
inconvenient and substantially hamper general international travel. As such, at least a
partial return to high flight volumes is plausible in the future.​18
A less restrictive possibility to control the COVID-19 spread is to concentrate efforts of
detection and isolation of cases to specific locations. Risk assessments of scenarios of
COVID-19 spread to new locations, or retrospective analysis or importation to certain
locations, have been previously performed.​19–23​ These studies mainly focused on the
introduction of COVID-19 into highly vulnerable locations, often with public health
infrastructures that may not respond efficiently to contain an outbreak.
On the other hand, locations can also be determined as dangerous by their likelihood to
disseminate infected individuals and initiate novel or reoccurring COVID-19 outbreaks
in other locations. Investing additional resources in individual screening at high risk
source locations might therefore prove efficient in preventing spillover from countries
which do not completely cancel international flights. In addition to being relevant
currently, such a strategy might also be important when SARS-CoV-2 is suppressed to
low-frequency or even undetectable circulation. Under this scenario, narrower public
health interventions would be needed, and increased focus would be pointed at
preventing new or recurrent outbreaks.
In this study, we consider a possible future scenario in which case numbers are low. We
develop and examine a method for discriminating airports with a high potential of
initiating a COVID-19 outbreak elsewhere upon the introduction of an infected
passenger. We apply this method to modelled flight data, and examine the risk of a new
outbreak initiation globally, as well as in three regions where the effects of a sustained
COVID-19 outbreak may be especially devastating: Africa, India and Brazil.

Our results are analysed and found robust to various disease outbreak modelling
assumptions as well as to seasonal changes in flight patterns.

Methods
Data
We approximated monthly data of airport connectivity by the model presented in Mao et
al.​24​ Briefly, this data is obtained by applying a Poisson regression model for the number
of passengers on covariates such as city connectivity, purchasing power index,​25
population and weather. This process has yielded information regarding n = 1364 major
airports scattered throughout the world. The analyses presented in the text rely on air
travel during October. This month was chosen as it approximates the beginning of major
seasonal respiratory diseases​26​ and is hypothesized to be the potential time of
resurgence of COVID-19.​27​ However, similar results are obtained for different months as
well (see supplementary material Figure S1). Continent and country information for
each airport were retrieved from.​28
Human population density data was retrieved from NASA.​29​ For each airport i = 1, ..., n
an associated density, ρi was calculated. First, the location of maximum population
density within a 130km radius of each airport was found in order to determine the most
likely destination for travellers arriving at that airport. Then, the average population
density within a 30km radius of that location was calculated to estimate the density of
the population in that area. This heuristic of density estimation is meant to approximate
the density of a major nearby location to which an infected passenger is likely to arrive.
For example, our heuristic method found the maximal density location of JFK, EWR and
LGA (three major airports serving New York City) to be located in downtown Manhattan.
Similarly, the two airports serving Berlin (TXL, SXF) and two airports serving Tokyo
(NRT, HND) were correctly assigned the same maximal population density in their
corresponding metropolitans.
Outbreak probability
Briefly, we assume a low prevalence of COVID-19 in each country, and use the number
of passengers transferring from and to different airports to calculate the probability of
arrival of infected individuals to each destination; in each destination, we scale R by the
local density; calculate the risk of an outbreak using a branching process-based

method; and, finally, combine these estimates to yield the risk each airport poses for a
COVID-19 outbreak initiation. More details follow.
We used population density estimates to adjust the reproduction number, the expected
number of cases generated by a single infected individual in the population, with the
rationale being that individual contact rates scale approximately proportional to
population density,​30​ which is consistent with another COVID-19 reproductive number
estimate.​31​ The reproduction number for region ​i, Ri , was calculated as Ri = Rw • ρi /ρw ,
where ρi is the density of region ​i, ρw is the estimated density associated with Wuhan
Tianhe International Airport, and Rw is the estimated reproductive number in Wuhan.
The value of Rw was set to 3 in all the results in the manuscript, as per recent estimates
of the basic reproduction number.​5​ A sensitivity analysis for Rw values of 2 and 4 was
conducted to reflect the variance in the estimates and potentially lower values in
previously exposed populations , and yielded similar results (see supplementary
material Figure S3).
After obtaining the basic reproductive number for each location ​i​, we can calculate the
probability of no outbreak in that location based on the arrival of a single infected
individual, pi , according to the formula derived from a branching process model​32
pi = 1/Ri . We note that this formula remains valid when the population has previously
been exposed to the virus - the basic reproduction number can be simply replaced with
the effective reproduction number. Such cases are covered by the sensitivity analysis
performed on lower basic reproductive number values. Furthermore, this formula is
correct for an exponential infectious period, which is often implicitly assumed in
infectious diseases dynamic models.​33​ Nonetheless, we performed a sensitivity analysis
on the general case of a gamma distributed infectious period, with the appropriate
correction,​32,34​ while varying the shape parameter from the exponential case k = 1 to a a
high value of k = 6 (see supplementary material Figure S2 for details). Results were
qualitatively similar.
In addition, we have performed a sensitivity analysis for the existence of
superspreaders.​35​ The derived formula for pi in this case is more complex (see
derivation in supplementary material), but our results remained robust to this
generalization as well (see supplementary material Figure S4).
To calculate the risk each airport poses to an initiation of a COVID-19 outbreak, we
assume a fraction q of the population is infected. We assume that q is small when our
method is used to mitigate risk of outbreak initiation or resurgence, probably in the order
of magnitude of 10 −5 − 10 −6 , since otherwise control measures including complete flight

restriction are likely to be implemented. We denote the number of individuals travelling
from airport k to airport i by nk,i . Therefore, the probability of ​no ​outbreak initiation from

airport k (to any airport it is connected to) is π k = Πi (1 − q (1 − pi ))nk,i where i goes over
the range of airports connected to airport k . Since q is small, this is well approximated
by π k = Πi e−q(1−pi )nk,i = (e−∑i (1−pi )nk,i )q . As raising to a positive power q preserves order (
a > b > 0 implies aq > bq ), we can conclude the relative order of risk between two
airports k and l , π k and π l , does not depend on q (as long as q is small enough to
preserve the approximation above). This independence of q enables us to rank the risk
of outbreak initiation, 1 − π k , between different airports regardless of the value of q . For
ease of presentation, in our results we choose a value of q = 10−6 yielding low numbers
of infected individuals.
Lastly, we turn to highlight three low-middle income regions with high FSI values; Africa,
India and Brazil. For each region, we estimated the probability of an outbreak
conditioned on infected individuals arriving in an airport in that region. The calculation of
the probability of arrival is identical to the one described above, with the exception of
restricting flights only to those destined to said regions.
Additional results are provided in the supplementary material, including a table of airport
risks corresponding to Figure 1.b (TableS1), a table of airport characteristics (including
the associated density, R and probability of outbreak following the introduction of one
infected individual - all in TableS2), and a full table of the risks by different airports
(TableS3). Code and detailed instructions for running the model are available at
https://github.com/yairdaon/infections​. Code was run using python 3.7.5.

Results
We heuristically examine our method by identifying which places have the highest risk
of transmission from Wuhan Tianhe International (WUH) Airport. Reassuringly, focal
locations to the COVID-19 outbreak appeared among the top-5 airports most likely to
have an outbreak originating in WUH, including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.
We start our analysis by examining the global risk of outbreak by airport. That is, every
airport is assigned a risk of initiating an outbreak in any location, according to the

airport’s flight patterns and the destination’s risk of outbreak. First, we observe the
strong connectivity clusters focused in Europe, east Asia, and the United States (Figure
1.a). We further note that risk is high in east Asia with all but two of the top ten
highest-risk airports originating in that region (the exceptions being London Heathrow
and Dubai airport; Figure 1). Calculating the average risk of the ten highest-risk airports
in each continent yields the following risk order: Asia (0.50), Europe (0.26), North

America (0.19), South America (0.11), Africa (0.06), and Oceania (0.03). The estimates
of risks in our results greatly vary between airports. For example, the risk estimated for
Beijing Capital airport - the airport with the highest risk to initiate an outbreak - is
approximately 0.74. On the other hand, Paris Charles De Gaulle airport, ranked 15th,
has a risk estimate which is lower by a factor of two.

The locations most vulnerable to be severely affected by a COVID-19 outbreak can be
estimated by the Fragile States Index (FSI),​36​ and are mostly low-middle income
countries​22​ (Figure 1.a). Hence, we turned our focus to examine the risk of initiating an
outbreak in three locations of high FSI values and large populations: Africa, India and
Brazil.
Africa is relatively disconnected from the rest of the world. Its strongest connections to
locations outside the continent include connection to central Europe, with a relatively
strong connectivity to France (mainly through Morocco), England, and the Arab
peninsula (Figure 2.a). The risk posed by different airports to initiate a COVID-19
outbreak in Africa is highest at Johannesburg, Dubai, Paris, London, Abuja (Nigeria),
Jedda (Saudi Arabia), Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Nairobi and Cairo (Figure 2.b).
Contrary to Africa, in India we do observe the largest risk to initiate an outbreak arising
from domestic flights, originating within India itself. Of the ten highest-risk airports with
respect to India, eight are within the borders of India (the exceptions being airports in
Dubai and Singapore). The same trend continues in the following twenty highest-risk
airports - fifteen of the top twenty are in India. In Brazil, a similar trend is observed - the
12 highest-risk airports are within Brazil (Figure 4).
The trend of highest risk posed by airports within a region persists when considering
other large regions - China, the United States, Russia and Europe (supplementary
figures S6, S7, S8 and S9, respectively): The risk of an outbreak in Europe arises
almost exclusively from airports within Europe, with only three of the thirty highest risk
airports outside of Europe. The United States displayed a similar trend; all of the thirty
highest-risk airports but five were found within the United States, the exceptions being
London, Toronto, Paris, Frankfurt and Tokyo. As far as China is concerned, risk was
due mostly to airports in East Asia, with all top forty airports that pose the highest risk to
China in said region. Of these, only five are located outside of China (Hong Kong,
Seoul, Tokyo, Singapore, Taipei and Bangkok). Russia presents a similar pattern, but to
a lesser extent. Four of the ten airports ranked of highest risk to Russia are outside its
borders. Three of the rest are in western Europe while one is in Ukraine.
We further investigated the seasonal changes in the connectivity between airports.
These did not yield substantial differences (see supplementary material Figure S1).

Discussion
Our study highlights the importance of quantifying the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks
through the introduction of cases from air travel. We show that (a) East Asia is the area
most prone to initiating an outbreak, globally; (b) Large regions (India, Brazil, the United
States, Europe, and China) are at a higher risk for outbreaks from infected passengers
arriving from within rather than outside these regions. Although, Russia is somewhat of
an exception to this rule; and (c) Africa is a marked exception to this phenomenon, as
outbreaks in there are more likely to be initiated by infected passengers from West
Europe rather than from within Africa.
Our work complements the results of a recent study that showed that the spread of
COVID-19 in Europe closely followed air travel patterns and that the severe travel
restrictions implemented there resulted in substantial decreases in the disease’s
spread.​37​ That study has demonstrated that such restrictions often came into effect too
late after the reporting of COVID-19 cases. In accordance, our study emphasizes that
implementation of strict epidemiological control measures to prevent the spread of
COVID-19 is likely not to be feasible or timely. We suggest that an additional layer of
control measures, such as thorough screening of infected hosts, is important, and that
particular attention should be paid to airports that are estimated as likely to be a source
of COVID-19 outbreaks elsewhere. Not only does such a strategy prevent a potential
outbreak at the destination, but contacts between infectious and susceptible hosts on
flights are less likely to occur compared to a strategy based on screening individuals on
arrival in a new location.
Unfortunately, non-laboratory based methods of COVID-19 infection detection that are
both rapid and accurate are still lacking, and airport screening currently relies on
manifestation of symptoms (e.g. body temperature). Hence, individuals with
asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic infections may still be missed despite high coverage
rates of screening at airports, until newer methods of screening are developed. Current
estimates for the frequency of such individuals and their infectivity are still uncertain, 38,39
​
but high frequency of such individuals may regardless force the introduction of new
control measures.​35,40
The transmission of various viral pathogens is affected by seasonal changes in
temperature and humidity.​41​ Unfortunately, such effects have yet to be accurately
estimated for SARS-COV-2, although some initial investigations in this direction have
been made recently.​42–44​ Hence, our study did not consider the potential effects that

weather can have on the estimated risk. However, if such changes will be estimated in
the future, they could be easily incorporated in our framework, by scaling the different
R values according to the estimated effects of weather conditions in each location, and
recalculating the risk. This could potentially change some of the risk estimates we
present, especially of regions mostly connected to either the Northern or Southern
hemisphere. In such regions, the differences in weather are expected to be the greatest
in different seasons, and these are indeed often expressed in different seasonality
patterns of infectious diseases.​45
Application of the risk estimation we perform, and other assessments relying on air
travel data, can be utilized in real-time only if flight travel data are publicly available and
easily accessible. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain such data, and our model
relied on previously modelled estimates (see Methods).
We also note that our data do not distinguish between connecting and direct flights,
which could affect the estimates of outbreak probabilities around airports that are mostly
used as transfer points rather than final destinations of passengers. Some of this effect
could perhaps be mitigated by the transferring individuals interacting and infecting
workers at those airports, but unfortunately this is outside the scope of our work and
data to refine this point are unavailable to us.
Moreover, we did not apply our estimates to other modes of transportation. Rail travel,
in particular, could be another relevant route of COVID-19 case importation. India, for
example, has more than 10-fold annual train passengers than air passengers,​7,46
although this figure can vary substantially across countries.​47,48​ We expect rail travel to
mostly increase the chances of domestic case importation, due to its more local routes
relative to air travel. Potentially, our method could be similarly applied to rail travel in the
future, given rail travel data.
Therefore, we emphasize the need in recent, detailed transportation data, and its
importance to facilitate research and improved decision making for international
COVID-19 outbreak control. Such data are crucial for real time management of crises of
a scale we are currently observing.
To conclude, our method provides an estimate of the risk to initiate a COVID-19
outbreak due to travel from different airports. We note that, while connectivity between
different locations is important, it is only one component determining the risk of an
outbreak. Other important factors include the reproduction number and characteristics
of the destination such as population density. Our risk measure combines connectivity
weighted by reproduction number estimates in a non-linear fashion, giving rise to a

realistic risk measure for outbreaks. Our results demonstrate the heterogeneity in the
risk of outbreak initiation on both global, as well as more local scales. As numbers of
cases of COVID-19 worldwide decrease, the current shutdown of air travel will be
reduced due to the large economic costs. At that time, we suggest that control and
screening measures are implemented carefully, with particular attention paid to
locations that might be responsible for outbreak initiation.
