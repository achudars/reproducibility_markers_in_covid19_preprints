Abstract

The lockdown policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has a potentially
important impact on provision of mental healthcare with uncertain consequences over the 12
months ahead. Past activity may provide a means to predict future demand. Taking advantage
of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource at the South London and
Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in
south London), we carried out a range of descriptive analyses to inform the Trust on patient
groups who might be most likely to require inpatient and home treatment team (HTT) crisis
care. We considered the 12 months following UK COVID-19 lockdown policy on 16th
March, drawing on comparable findings from previous years, and quantified levels of change
in service delivery to those most likely to receive crisis care. For 12-month crisis days from
16th March in 2015-19, we found that most (over 80%) were accounted for by inpatient care
(rather than HTT), most (around 75%) were used by patients who were current or recent
Trust patients at the commencement of follow-up, and highest numbers were used by patients
with a previously recorded schizophreniform disorder diagnosis. For current/recent patients
on 16th March there had been substantial reductions in use of inpatient care in the following
31 days in 2020, more than previous years; changes in total non-inpatient contact numbers
did not differ in 2020 compared to previous years, although there had been a marked switch
from face-to-face to virtual contacts.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic may have a profound impact on health services through the direct
effects of the virus itself, through social distancing policies and their psychological impact,
and through the disrupting impact of social distancing policies on delivery of mental and
physical healthcare. Mental healthcare services have had to be radically reconfigured to cope
with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections in inpatient and outpatient settings, staff
sickness or self-isolation, the need to minimise face-to-face contacts, and the need to
accommodate increasing pressures on acute medical care from cases of viral pneumonia.

We have previously begun reporting on the mental healthcare impact of the UK COVID-19
pandemic, taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data platform
that receives 24-hourly updates from its source electronic records. Analysing activity in key
services from February to mid-May 2020, and comparing periods before and after 16th March
2020, Community Mental Health Teams showed relatively stable caseloads and total contact
numbers, but a substantial shift from face-to-face to virtual contacts, while Home Treatment
Teams showed the same changeover but reductions in caseloads and total contacts (1).

Methods

The Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) Case Register at the South London and Maudsley
NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) has been described previously (2;3). SLaM serves a
geographic catchment of four south London boroughs (Croydon, Lambeth, Lewisham,
Southwark) with a population of around 1.2 million residents, and has used a fully electronic
health record (EHR) across all its services since 2006. SLaM’s BRC Case Register was set up
in 2008, providing researcher access to de-identified data from SLaM’s EHR via the Clinical
Record Interactive Search (CRIS) platform and within a robust security model and
governance framework (4). CRIS has been extensively developed over the last 10 years with
a range of external data linkages and natural language processing resources (3). Of relevance
to the work presented here, CRIS is updated from SLaM’s EHR every 24 hours and thus
provides relatively ‘real-time’ data. SLaM’s EHR is itself immediately updated every time an
entry is made, which include date-stamped fields indicating patient contacts (‘events’) and
those indicating acceptance of a referral or a discharge from a given service (or SLaM care

more generally). CRIS data have been substantially enhanced by a suite of natural language
processing (NLP) algorithms to extract structured data on named entities from free text fields;
a catalogue describing these is available on the CRIS site (5). CRIS has supported over 200
peer reviewed publications to date, and has received approval as a data source for secondary
analyses (Oxford Research Ethics Committee C, reference 18/SC/0372).

In order to investigate the composition of service user profiles associated with crisis service
use over the 12 months following 16th March 2020 based on previous years’ data, for each
recent year (2015-2019), we took the 16th March as an index date and characterised patients
who received any crisis care (inpatient or HTT) in the 12 months following each date (i.e. up
to and including 15th March in the following year). To begin with, we divided these patients
into three cohorts based on their status at the start of follow-up: i) Recent – those active to
SLaM at any point in the 3 months up to 16th March that year; ii) Past – those previously
active to SLaM but not within the 3 months up to 16th March that year; iii) New – those not
previously known to SLaM before the 16th March that year. ‘Active’ here was defined on the
basis of an open and accepted referral (i.e. regardless of whether a team had been assigned or
a contact made). For each follow-up period, we investigated the proportion of ‘crisis care’
accounted for by inpatient vs. HTT-only. We compared total crisis person-days, inpatient
person-days, and HTT-only person-days between the three cohorts for each year.

Further exploratory descriptive analyses of group (i) above divided the 12-month follow-up
period into quarters to investigate whether crisis service use was higher in earlier compared to
later periods after each index date. Finally, contributions to crisis days over each 12-month
period for group (i) were described specifically for seven diagnostic groups, defined on the
basis of any previous primary or secondary diagnosis received prior to each index data (thus
overlapping rather than mutually exclusive): a) serious mental illness (ICD-10 codes F2x,
F30x, F31x, F32.3, F33.3); b) schizophrenia-like disorders (F2x); c) bipolar disorder (F31x);
d) any affective disorder (F3x); e) any organic disorder (F0x); f) any alcohol or substance use
disorder (F1x); g) any personality disorder (F60x, F61x, or ascertained via an NLP algorithm
extracting diagnostic statements in documentation).

In order to quantify and contextualise the recent changes in service contact experienced by
current/recent service users in the early stages of lockdown, for each previous year we
ascertained patients on March 16th who had been ‘active’ to SLaM in the preceding 3

calendar months (i.e. Group (i) above). Taking these cohorts, we ascertained total inpatient
days and the following clinical contacts by non-inpatient teams: i) face-to-face contacts
attended; ii) virtual contacts attended (by email, fax, mail, phone, online, or video link); iii)
total contacts, as the sum of these two. These were quantified and compared for the 31 days
up to and including 15th March, and for the 31 days from 16th March onward, for the years
2015 to 2020. Further analyses were then carried out restricting the comparisons to those with
diagnoses recorded prior to 16th March in a given year, applying the same seven diagnostic
groups as described above.

Results

Total crisis days for given 12-month periods are displayed and compared in Table 1, and
were around the 350,000 to 360,000 range, tending to be lower in more recent years. Around
80-85% of crisis days were accounted for by inpatient days, reducing gradually from 201519. Around 75% of crisis days were used by current/recent patients at the start of each
follow-up period (reducing from 77% to 73% from 2015-19); this proportion was lower for
HTT days, with around 50-55% being used by recent patients (reducing over the years) and
the remainder split fairly evenly between past and new patients.

In further analyses focusing on current/recent patients at each index date, dividing the 12month follow-up period into quarters, crisis person-days were observed to be relatively stable
over that period for current/recent patients (Figures 1a-c). Descriptions of crisis day usage by
diagnostic groups of interest are displayed in Figures 2a and 2b. In summary, highest
numbers of crisis days were accounted for by people with previously recorded
schizophreniform diagnoses; use of crisis services had been decreasing in SMI,
schizophreniform, bipolar and organic disorder diagnostic groups, had been relatively stable
in patients with previously recorded affective disorder or alcohol/substance use disorder, and
had been increasing in those with a previous personality disorder diagnosis. The proportion of
crisis days accounted for by inpatient care (as opposed to HTT) was fairly similar between
diagnostic groups, although marginally lower for those with previous affective disorder
diagnoses; also, no substantial or consistent changes over the 5 years were observed.
Service contact changes for current/recent patients for the 31 day periods before and after 16th
March are compared by year in Table 2. In previous years, a consistent 3-6% reduction in

inpatient person days was observed from periods before to after the index date, compared to
the substantially larger 26% decrease observed in 2020. Face-to-face contacts showed a more
heterogeneous 8-24% decrease over the same comparison period, compared to the 65%
decrease in 2020, while virtual contacts had decreased by 3-22% in previous years compared
to a 117% increase in 2020. Total contacts decreased by 21% in 2020, which was within the
8-23% range for previous years.

Service contact changes are further displayed by previous diagnosis in Figures 3a-d. For
inpatient days, most diagnostic groups showed substantial differences in changes between
2020 and previous years, apart from bipolar disorder where these were not marked. Patterns
across years for changes in face-to-face, virtual, and total contacts did not differ substantially
between diagnostic groups. Reductions in total contacts in 2020 were least marked for bipolar
and schizophreniform disorders and most marked for organic disorders, but all of these
changes were within the range for the previous 5 years.

Discussion

We report a series of descriptive analyses carried out at SLaM, carried out to inform the Trust
on patients who might be most likely to require inpatient and other (HTT) crisis care in the 12
months following UK COVID-19 lockdown policy on 16th March, based on findings from
previous years, as well as to quantify levels of change in service delivery around that date for
the group of current/recent service users most likely to be future users of crisis care. Key
findings were as follows: i) 80-85% of crisis days were spent in inpatient care rather than
under HTT; ii) around 75% of crisis days over a given 12 months were used by patients who
were currently or recently under the care of the Trust at the commencement of that follow-up
period; iii) highest numbers of crisis days were used by patients with a previously recorded
schizophreniform disorder (ICD-10 F2x); iv) in recent/current patients, there had been
substantial reductions in use of inpatient care in the 31 days after 16th March 2020,
substantially more than in previous years; v) changes in total contacts from non-inpatient
teams did not differ substantially in 2020 compared to previous years, although there had
been a marked change from face-to-face to virtual contacts – this held for all diagnostic
groups investigated.

Considering limitations, it is important to bear in mind that the data are derived from a single
site. Because complete data are being provided for that site with no hypothetical source
population intended, calculation of confidence intervals was not felt to be appropriate for the
descriptive data provided in this report; applicability to other mental healthcare providers
cannot therefore be inferred and would need specific investigation, although we recommend
the broad approach as a methodology worth considering. Profiles of services and catchment
morbidity are also likely to vary between sites; for example, the very high predominance of
people with psychotic disorders in those requiring inpatient and/or HTT input may well be
related to SLaM’s particular inner urban catchment. Finally, the core task of predicting levels
of future service activity, and the characteristics of those requiring highest-cost services, is
clearly complex. On the one hand, there has been a marked consistency in the users of crisis
services in past years; on the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed unique
challenges on mental health services, those using them and those not yet using them but in
need of them. Therefore it will be important to set up an adequate monitoring system to
assess service use as close to real-time as possible and to identify any unexpected divergences
from previous norms.
