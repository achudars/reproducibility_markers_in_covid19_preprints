Abstract

24

Background: We evaluated the clinical performance of an immunochromatographic (IC) IgM/IgG

25

antibody assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and chest

26

computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

27

Methods: We examined 139 serum specimens collected from 112 patients with COVID-19 and 48

28

serum specimens collected from 48 non-COVID-19 patients. The presence of IgM/IgG antibody for

29

SARS-CoV2 was determined using the One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG

30

Antibody Test. Chest CT was performed in COVID-19 patients on admission.

31

Findings: Of the139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8%, 48.0%, and 95.8% of

32

the specimens collected within 1 week, 1–2 weeks, and >2 weeks after symptom onset and IgG was

33

detected in 3.3%, 8.0%, and 62.5%, respectively. Among the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens, 1

34

generated a false-positive result for IgM. Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were

35

asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were

36

positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG. The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in

37

combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22/38) and 68.4% (26/38) for the asymptomatic patients

38

and 74.3% (55/74) and 82.4% (61/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively.

39

Conclusion: The IC assay had low sensitivity during the early phase of infection, and thus IC assay

40

alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19. If RT-qPCR is not available,

41

the combination of chest CT and IC assay may be useful for diagnosing COVID-19.

Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) epidemic, which causes

44

the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan,

45

China (1), and it has since been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The ongoing

46

outbreak is a global threat to human health. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain

47

reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis for SARS-CoV2 is considered the gold standard for diagnosing

48

COVID-19. RT-qPCR has been used to analyze specimens from the upper and lower respiratory

49

tracts for clinical diagnosis during outbreaks of other diseases, but it has not been performed widely

50

in the clinical setting because it requires special equipment, a time-consuming protocol, and highly

51

skilled laboratory technicians. In addition, because RT-qPCR requires samples from the upper and

52

lower respiratory tracts, the process of collecting samples and extracting RNA increases the risk of

53

exposure to viral droplets. Therefore, an alternative diagnostic test to RT-qPCR is desirable for the

54

clinical management of COVID-19.

55

In studies conducted in China, chest computed tomography (CT) scans were widely utilized as

56

a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 (2-4). Lung involvement can be detected in patients with COVID-19

57

on a CT scan in advance of the symptoms typical for pneumonia (5) and a positive result on

58

RT-qPCR (6, 7). The common radiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT

59

have a diagnostic sensitivity of 73%–93% and a specificity of 24%–100% in distinguishing

60

COVID-19 from other forms of viral pneumonia (2, 8). An immunochromatographic (IC) assay for

61

IgM and IgG antibodies against the virus is widely accepted as a point-of-care test because it is an

62

easy-to-perform, rapid, and high-throughput method for diagnosing viral infections. Recently, several

63

commercial IC assays that detect IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV2 have become available

64

for use in the clinical setting. However, their clinical usefulness has yet to be thoroughly evaluated.

65

Here, we describe the clinical performance of an IC assay in comparison with that of chest CT.

Materials and Methods

68

Patients with COVID-19 and their clinical specimens

69

Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were referred to the Self-Defense

70

Forces Central Hospital and Saitama Medical University Hospital in Japan from February 11 to

71

March 31, 2020 were enrolled in this study. All patients were examined by RT-qPCR for

72

SARS-CoV2 using pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs collected at public health institutes or

73

hospitals in accordance with the nationally recommended method in Japan (9). Chest CT was

74

performed on the day of admission. Serum specimens were collected on the day of admission and

75

during hospitalization. Clinical information was collected from the medical records. The CT findings

76

were evaluated by a radiologist to determine the specific features caused by COVID-19 (2).

77

78

79

Negative samples from patients with non-COVID-19
To evaluate the analytical specificity of the IC assay, we used serum samples collected from

80

patients at Saitama Medical University Hospital, Japan, from April to October 2019, before

81

SARS-CoV2 was first reported in China. Clinical information was collected from the medical

82

records, and all serum samples were stored at −80°C before use in the IC assay.

83

84

85

Definition
Asymptomatic cases were defined as patients with no history of clinical signs or symptoms.

86

Symptomatic cases were defined as patients showing the clinical symptoms of COVID-19: fever,

87

cough, nasal discharge, diarrhea, malaise, dyspnea, tachypnea, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation

88

<93%, and need for oxygen therapy. The day of onset was defined as the first day of symptoms

89

caused by COVID-19 in the symptomatic patients or the day of the first positive RT-qPCR result for

90

upper respiratory specimens in the asymptomatic patients.

Detection of IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV2
IgM/IgG antibody tests for SARS-CoV2 were performed using the One Step Novel

93

94

Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test (Artron, Burnaby, Canada) according to the

95

manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 10 μL serum was added to the sample port of the IC assay and

96

was incubated for 20–30 s. Subsequently, 2 drops of sample buffer were added to the same sample

97

port, and the results were interpreted after a 15–20 min incubation. The presence of only the control

98

line indicates a negative result; the presence of both the control line and the IgM or IgG antibody line

99

indicates a positive result for IgM or IgG antibody, respectively.

Results

107

Sensitivity and specificity of the IC assay for COVID-19

108

IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV2 could be detected by the IC assay. In total, 139

109

serum samples were collected from 112 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and were

110

used as positive controls for the IC assay in this study. The medium period from onset to serum

111

collection was 6 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3–13 days). The results of the IC assay for serum

112

specimens are shown in Table 1. The serum samples were subdivided into three groups according to

113

sample collection times: within 1 week (n = 90), 1–2 weeks (n = 25), and >2 weeks after onset (n =

114

24). IgM antibody was detected in 60 (43.2%) of the 139 serum samples collected and IgG antibody

115

was detected in 20 (14.4%) specimens. All IgG antibody-positive samples were also positive for IgM

116

antibody in the IC assay. Thus, the sensitivity of the IC assay was calculated to be 43.2% for all

117

serum specimens. IgM antibody was detected in 27.8% (25/90) of specimens collected within 1 week

118

of onset, 48.0% (12/25) collected within 1–2 weeks, and 95.8% (23/24) collected >2 weeks after

119

onset. The corresponding detection rates for IgG antibody were 3.3% (3/90 specimens), 8.0% (2/25

120

specimens), and 62.5% (15/25 specimens).

121

In IC assays of the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens collected before the emergence of

122

SARS-CoV2 infection, 1 specimen from a patient with Sjogren’s syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis

123

showed a false-positive result for IgM antibody. Thus, the specificity of the IC assay was calculated

124

to be 98.0%.

127

IC assay and chest CT for patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19
Clinical background of the 112 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 in this study are

128

shown in Table 2. Thirty-eight (33.9%) patients who had no COVID-19 symptoms were classified as

129

asymptomatic and the remaining 74 (66.1%) were classified as symptomatic. Briefly, patients were

130

aged 20–93 years (median, 67 years; IQR, 45–74 years), and 64 (57.1%) were men. All

131

asymptomatic patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-qPCR while under quarantine in

132

Japan. Of the 38 asymptomatic patients, median time from the first RT-qPCR–positive day to

133

admission was 5 days (IQR, 3–6 days). Of the 74 symptomatic patients, median time from onset to

134

admission was 5 days (IQR, 2–7 days).

135

Table 3 shows the results of the IC assay and chest CT for the patients on admission. When

136

using serum samples taken from the 38 asymptomatic patients, IgM antibody was detected in 15

137

(39.5%) patients on admission, and none of the patients were positive for IgG antibody. Chest CT

138

showed abnormal lung findings consistent with the radiographic features of COVID-19 in 22

139

(57.9%) asymptomatic patients on admission. When the combination of IC assay and chest CT

140

findings was used for diagnosis in the asymptomatic patients, the sensitivity was 68.4%.

141

Of the 74 symptomatic patients, IgM antibody was detected in 22 (29.7%) patients and IgG

142

antibody in 7 (9.5%) patients. All IgG antibody-positive patients were also positive for IgM antibody.

143

The sensitivity of the IC assay was 17.0% (9/53) within 1 week, 33.3% (4/12) within 1–2 weeks, and

144

100.0% (9/9) within >2 weeks after onset. Of the 74 symptomatic patients, chest CT detected the

145

radiographical patterns of COVID-19 in 55 (74.3%) patients on admission. The corresponding

146

sensitivity of chest CT was 73.3% (39/53 patients), 66.7% (8/12), and 88.9% (8/9). When the

147

combination of IC assay and chest CT was used for diagnosis in symptomatic COVID-19 patients,

148

the corresponding sensitivity was 81.1% (43/53 patients), 75.0% (9/12), and 100% (9/9).

Discussion
Here, we presented the analytical results of a commercial IC assay and findings of chest CT

152

scans for patients with COVID-19. Although the IC assay showed high sensitivity for samples

153

collected >2 weeks after symptom onset, it was less sensitive for patients who developed

154

symptomatic COVID-19 within 1 week. Chest CT showed higher sensitivity than the IC assay for the

155

diagnosis of COVID-19, but it did not show the specific radiological features of COVID-19 in 18.3%

156

of symptomatic patients. Nevertheless, the combination of IC assay and chest CT slightly increased

157

the diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19.

158

Based on previous enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results for IgM and IgG

159

antibodies, only 38.3% of patients were positive for IgM antibody within the first week after onset.

160

The detection of IgM and IgG antibodies increased rapidly from day 15 after onset (IgM = 94.3%

161

and IgG = 79.8%) (10). Our IC assay results support these previous findings that seroconversion

162

mainly occurred >2 weeks after onset (10). The clinical usefulness of serological tests for COVID-19

163

remains controversial due to the time lag between the onset of symptoms and the appearance of IgM

164

and IgG antibodies in serum. In China and the United States, the sensitivity and specificity of

165

serological tests for samples initially collected from hospitalized patients were 38.3%–85.4% and

166

100% (10-12) for ELISA and 18.4%–88.7% and 90.6%–91.7% for IC assay (13, 14), respectively.

167

This contradiction probably reflects differences in the timing of sampling because the clinical setting

168

varies in each country. In the clinical setting, patients are usually diagnosed with COVID-19 within 2

169

weeks because they develop dyspnea and pneumonia at a median of 8 days (IQR, 5.0–13.0 days)

170

after symptom onset (1). In this study, the median time from onset to hospitalization was 5 days (IQR,

171

2–7 days), which is shorter than in previous studies (median 7–15 days) (10-14). Additionally, only

172

29.7% of patients were diagnosed using IC assay alone, supporting the Cassaniti et al.’s conclusion

173

that the sensitivity of IC assays remains insufficient for their use as a clinical diagnostic tool (14).

174

Therefore, unfortunately, the IC assay alone cannot replace RT-qPCR as an acute diagnostic protocol

175

for COVID-19, at least in the clinical setting in Japan. However, the IC assay can be used for

176

epidemiological studies of the seroprevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV2.

177

Previous studies have shown that the sensitivity of CT among symptomatic patients was

178

high (73%–97%), although specificity differed widely (24%–100%) (7, 8, 15, 16). The clinical

179

performance of CT may vary according to differences in patient populations, disease severity, and

180

accessibility to chest CT scans in each country. In the present study, chest CT showed higher

181

sensitivity than the IC assay, but sensitivity was only 73.3% among the symptomatic patients who

182

tested positive for SARS-CoV2 according to RT-qPCR. Bernheim et al. reported that the sensitivity

183

of chest CT was low (44%) in the acute phase (0–2 days after onset) but high (91%) in the

184

intermediate phase (3–5 days) (16). The low sensitivity of chest CT may reflect the short period of

185

time between symptom onset to hospitalization in the symptomatic patients examined in this study.

186

The diagnostic sensitivity was improved by combining the IC assay and chest CT (81.3%). In the

187

present study, we did not evaluate the specificity of chest CT, but taking the high specificity of the IC

188

assay into consideration, combining the IC assay and chest CT was considered to improve the

189

diagnostic specificity as well. When RT-qPCR is not available or practical, the combination may be

190

useful for diagnosing COVID-19.

191

The identification of asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 is important to prevent

192

nosocomial infection. The average incubation period of COVID-19 is 5.2 days (17) but ranges from

193

0 to 24 days (15). It has also been reported that patients hospitalized with other diseases who did not

194

show respiratory symptoms developed symptomatic COVID-19 and they spread SARS-CoV2 to

195

other patients and medical workers (18). Also, the transmission of SARS-CoV2 from patients

196

without respiratory symptoms has been reported in several countries (19-21). In the present study,

197

chest CT showed higher sensitivity than the IC assay (57.9% vs. 39.5%, respectively), but it is not

198

practical to perform chest CT for all hospitalized patients because of radiation exposure risk and

199

limited medical resources (22). Although the IC assay alone may not be useful as a screening test for

200

asymptomatic COVID-19 due to its low sensitivity, it may contribute to the prevention of

201

nosocomial infection.

202

A major limitation of this study was the low number of patients. In addition, only one

203

commercial IC kit was evaluated. The commercial IC assay verified to have the best performance in

204

the clinical setting should be chosen for further studies. Multicenter, multi-national, prospective

205

studies are warranted to determine the usefulness of IC assays and chest CT for diagnosing

206

COVID-19.

207

208

Conclusion

209

The sensitivity of the IC assay was low during the early phase in asymptomatic and

210

symptomatic patients. Therefore, IC assay alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for

211

COVID-19. When RT-qPCR cannot be used, the combination of chest CT and IC assay may be

212

useful for diagnosing COVID-19.
