Abstract
Public health emergencies such as the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have significant
impact on mental health, and have been shown to impact on already prevalent affective disorders
during and after pregnancy. The aim of this study was to utilize modern tools to assess
depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as wellbeing and life changes in pregnant women
during the pandemic in Sweden, where no lockdown has been in place.
Data from the Mom2B, a national ongoing mobile application-based study of pregnant and
newly-delivered women were utilized. Participants (n= 1345) filled out self-report screeners of
depression, anxiety and wellbeing. Questions about COVID symptoms and effects on life and
health care were added from March 2020. Movement data was collected using the phone’s GPS
sensor. Mood scores were compared with throughout the months of 2020 and to the levels of a
previous collected material. Highest levels of depression and anxiety were evident in April and
October 2020. Symptoms were higher among those feeling socially isolated, but not for those
infected or with symptomatic family members. Wellbeing and mobility were strongly positively
correlated and were lowest in April. Women reported on cancelled healthcare appointments and
worry about their partners being absent from the delivery.
The Mom2B application enabled gathering information at a national level in real-time as the
pandemic has been evolving. Levels of perinatal affective symptoms and low wellbeing were
elevated compared with previous years as well as with months with fewer cases of SARS-Cov-2.
Similar applications can help healthcare providers and governmental bodies to in real time
monitor high-risk groups during crises, as well as to adjust measures and the support offered.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a huge healthcare crisis with significant
sequelae, spreading to nearly all countries; the global death toll exceeds 1 million and the
number of confirmed cases more than 50 million people (1). Beyond other adverse effects, the
disease has posed significant threats in mental health with recent studies reporting an increase by
15-30% in anxiety and depression globally, whereas the infection itself may also affect the
nervous system, and cause symptoms of mental illness (2, 3). Notably, patients with a recent
mental disorder diagnosis show increased risk for COVID 19 infection (4). Importantly, the
mental health effects of COVID-19 are expected to persist even after a vaccination is established,
because of the neurologic sequelae of the disease, trauma of illness, loss of loved ones, and
increased stress due to financial restraints.
Especially among pregnant women, recent studies in the US, China, Japan and Turkey have
shown an increase by 25-50% in peripartum anxiety and depressive symptoms since the
beginning of the pandemic (2, 5-7). Factors that may underlie these associations include the
worry for the health of the pregnancy and the forthcoming infant, worry for the pandemic
situation in general, economic consequences, grief for victims, misinformation about the virus,
worry about not getting healthcare services as planned, social distancing/social isolation and
travel restrictions (2, 3, 5). The epidemic has greatly affected hospital organization and
procedures, especially those concerning the conditions and experiences of childbirth (8).
Depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy can increase the risk of postpartum
depression; of note is that depression and anxiety in both pregnancy and postpartum have farreaching effects including severe consequences on the mother’s future morbidity and the fetus’s
psycho-emotional development (9-12). Young age, low maternal education, low income,

unemployment and lack of partner support seem to be additional factors associated with higher
risk of adverse perinatal mental health effects (13, 14).
In Sweden, with 115.000 births per year, medical interventions to address the risks associated
with pregnancy and birth have been largely successful so far and have resulted in one of the
lowest levels of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide (15). Sweden also
offers a unique setting with as many as 92% of the Swedish population above the age of 12
owning a smartphone in 2019. Moreover, Sweden is one of the countries that did not implement
strict lockdown measures, but relied on voluntary social distancing guidelines, including working
from home when possible, reducing travel and social contacts and avoiding public transport (16).
During the spring of 2020, no widespread public testing was in place in Sweden, and only very
few non-hospitalized citizens were tested for COVID-19. Deaths peaked in late April, whereas
the second wave during fall is ongoing with cases starting to surge again in October. The
Swedish approach not to implement strict lockdown measures has garnered debate and may have
resulted in greater or less anxiety, particularly for pregnant women.
This background of nearly free maternity care, low levels of maternal and neonatal morbidity,
relative economic stability, in combination with the absence of bias from lockdown measures
sequelae, provide a unique setting to study the impact related specifically to COVID-19 on
perinatal depression and anxiety. We utilized data from a unique cohort of pregnant women
recruited using the novel Mom2B mobile application for research, with the aim to examine: (1) if
measures of mental health differed between the months of the pandemic as well as comparing
with previous years, (2) if confirmed or possible infection and/or self-reported impact from the
pandemic were associated with mental health measures, using validated instruments, (3) if
mobility and corona-related internet searches correlated with symptoms and finally (4) which

relation to the pandemic.

Methods
Study population
The Mom2B cohort (www.mom2b.se) is a national ongoing mobile application-based mother
cohort, introduced at the end of November 2019 to the App Store and Google Play. All Swedishspeaking women above 18 years of age owning a mobile smartphone who are either pregnant or
have delivered within three months are eligible for participation. Information about the study is
being posted in social media, as well as by using posters and brochures at local maternity clinics.
By the end of October 2020, 1608 women were enrolled in the study and 1345 had answered at
least one question related to mental health measures during pregnancy. The included self-report
instruments were based on the results from a previous study in Uppsala County, Sweden (17),
whereas the mobile application further recorded digital phenotyping data, such as movement
patterns, internet and mobile use, as well as voice recordings, after receiving informed consent
from participants. Privacy protection was central in the design of the application and data was
collected only on i.e. relative geographical movement patterns, and not the exact position of
participant. The application was a further development of the Beiwe research platform from the
Harvard School of Public Health, adjusted to the Mom2B study questions and adhering to the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulations in Sweden (18).

Comparison population
To compare the population in the Mom2B study to pre-pandemic years, we used data from 4879
pregnant women recruited in the Biologic Affect Stress Imagine and Cognition (BASIC)-study
(17). BASIC was a population-based longitudinal cohort study, conducted at Uppsala University
hospital in 2009-2019, with the aim to study biological and psychosocial aspects of perinatal

depression. The participants, constituting around 21% of the background pregnant population,
answered web-based self-report instruments regarding mental health twice during pregnancy and
three times during postpartum. Women with valid outcome data from at least one-time during
pregnancy were included in the analysis.

Ethical approval for the BASIC study was granted by the Regional Ethical Review Board of
Uppsala, Sweden (Dnr 2009/171), and for the Mom2B-study by the Swedish Ethical Review
Authority (Dnr 2019-01170), with amendments.

Variables of interest
Perinatal anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal
Depression Scale (EPDS)(19) a validated ten-item self-report questionnaire assessing depressive
symptoms in the perinatal period with good psychometric properties (20). For the present study,
a cutoff point of 13 points was used to define probable cases of depression during pregnancy,
according to Swedish validation (21). Three items were used for measuring symptoms of anxiety
(EPDS-3A)(22) with a cut-off score of six (22). EPDS was collected in Mom2B at the end of the
first, second and third pregnancy trimester as well as at 6, 14, 24, 36 and 50 weeks postpartum.
The second self-report inventory was the five-item World Health Organization wellbeing index
(WHO-5) (23, 24) that investigates the degree of subjective quality of life based on positive
mood (good spirits, relaxation), vitality (being active and waking up fresh and rested), and
general interest (being interested in things). Each item was rated from 0 to 5; the total score
ranged from 0 to 25. According to the instructions, a percentage value was calculated by

multiplying the score by 4 and thus obtaining a scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A percentage
score below 50 was interpreted as indicating risk of depression (23, 25).
The following questions concerning the impact of the pandemic were assessed three times during
pregnancy between gestational weeks 11-20, 22-30 and 32-42, as well as during postpartum
weeks 3-20 and 22-42:
1. Have you received treatment for Covid-19? (a)Yes; b) No)
2. Have you had symptoms similar to the description of Covid-19? (a)Yes, tested positive;
b) Yes, tested negative; c) Yes, was not tested; d) No, but someone in my family had
symptoms and e) No, and no one in my family had any symptoms)
3. How is your life situation affected by the pandemic? (a) It is not affected; b) Only slightly
affected; c) There is a lot in my life that is affected and d) Almost everything in my life is
affected)
4. Which option describes your current situation? (a) My situation is about normal; b) I am
more isolated, and I am negatively affected; c) I am more isolated, but I feel OK and d) I
am more isolated and this is mostly positive for me)
Confirmed or possible Covid-19 infection was defined as the participant replying with one of the
following: 1a, 2a, 2b, 2c. Life situation was defined as “affected” when the participant replied
with 3c or 3d and unaffected when replying with 3a or 3b. There was also an open question
regarding the potential impact of the pandemic on the maternity and delivery health care
received. Because the absolute majority of participants were pregnant during this analysis, only
pregnancy assessed variables were included in this study.

Mobility data

Movement data was collected using the GPS sensor on the phone. To save battery, the GPS
sensor was iteratively turned on for 60 seconds and turned off for 10 minutes. A random offset
between -100 km and +100 km was applied in both latitude and longitude to preserve the privacy
of the participants. In total, GPS data was available for 1400 participants. For each participant,
records before January 2020 and after October 31, 2020 were removed. Records with a high
inaccuracy of the GPS sensor (>100 m) were also removed. Participants were also removed if
they had less than 100 records remaining. After data cleaning, 1189 participants were included in
this analysis.
Since the GPS sensor is turned on and off with a fixed interval, the absolute distances travelled
for each user every month could not be calculated; instead, the relative difference in distance
travelled away from their relative “home position” between months was used. The approximate
home location of each participant was estimated by taking the median of the latitude and median
of the longitude, assuming that each participant spends the majority of her time at home, and
adding a radius of 100 meters. Next, for each GPS record outside the “home location”, the
Euclidean distance to the home location was calculated. For each participant, the monthly
median of the distance travelled away from home was used. The aggregated between-participant
summary statistics were computed over these monthly medians.

Google search volumes data
The interest of internet users for the situation around the pandemic over time (January-October
2020) in Sweden was assessed using Google Trends
(https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=SE&q=Corona). The numbers procured represent
search volumes relative to the highest point on the chart (week with highest number of searches)

for the given region and time. A value of 100 denotes the timepoint for the peak popularity for
the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not
enough data for this term.

Statistical analyses of quantitative data
The EPDS, EPDS-3A and WHO-5 total monthly mean scores over time (from January to
October 2020) were compared using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) regardless of the
pregnancy time (early, middle or late). The distribution of the prevalence of positive screening
for depressive symptoms (EPDS score over the cut-off of 12 points), anxiety symptoms (EPDS3A score over the cut-off of 6), and low well-being (WHO-5 score below the cut-off of 50), over
time were evaluated using the Pearson chi-square statistic. The associations between EPDS,
EPDS-3A and WHO-5 in pregnancy and the self-reported impact of the pandemic during early
(11-20 gestation weeks), middle (21-30 gestation weeks) and late (31-42 gestation weeks)
pregnancy, were assessed using the Pearson’s chi-square test, student’s t-test and ANOVA as
appropriate. The Spearman correlation coefficients and the respective p-values were calculated to
assess possible correlations between the monthly mean total scores in EPDS, EPDS-3A, WHO-5
(total score and each subscale) and (1) the monthly median distance away from home, as well as
with (2) google search volumes on “corona”.
All reported p-values were based on two-sided tests and the 5% significance level was used for
hypothesis testing. Analyses were performed using the SPSS software, version 22.0.

Among questions on the mobile application regarding COVID-19, participants could comment in
two open questions, on any impact on (1) their antenatal health care or birth plan, and (2) the
delivery care. The questionnaire was sent out via the mobile app at three times during gestational
weeks 11-22, 24-32 and 32-42. Analysis of the free text responses were performed using
systematic text condensation (26) to comprehend the experiences of pregnant women of
healthcare during Covid-19 pandemic. Every answer was divided into “meaning units” and the
main content of the meaning units were identified and categorized.

Results
The background characteristics of the 1345 women included in the Mom2B-study are presented
in Table 1. The majority of participants were born in Sweden and were primiparous. Moreover,
most women had university level education and lived with a partner. More than half of women
reported having experienced depression earlier in life (Table 1).
Analyses of the mental health scores over time showed that the mean scores for depressive
symptoms and anxiety peaked in April 2020 and increased again in October 2020 (Figure 1a),
with 24-25% of pregnant women reporting EPDS scores over cut-off during April and May
(Table 2). Statistically significant differences over this period were observed for EPDS and
WHO-5 total scores using ANOVA (p=0.045 and p<0.001 respectively). The wellbeing scores
were highest in January, as well as in June-August 2020. Mobility also peaked during the
summer months of 2020 (Figure 1b). The google searches regarding the corona pandemic peaked
in March, closely before the peak in symptoms of depression and anxiety, and started rising
again in late October 2020 (Figure 1c). The prevalence of women scoring above cut-off in EPDS
in 2020 was much higher, often more than double, in comparison with data from 2009-2019

(Table 2), when values were relatively stable across the seasons; no statistical testing was
applied, as these data were derived from another cohort.
The majority of participants reported that their life situation was only slightly affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic (at any of the three-pregnancy time-points) (Table 5). Most women felt
more socially isolated, and about one third of them perceived it as difficult (Table 5). Women
reporting having no symptoms had higher anxiety symptoms (10%) in gestation week 22-30 than
those with symptoms (3%) or a close friend or relative with symptoms (4%) (Table 3).
Otherwise, no differences were observed among participants with Covid-19 related symptoms
regarding depressive symptoms or well-being (Table 3).
The proportion of participants with depressive symptoms over the cut-off during gestational
week 22-30 was higher among those reporting that that their lives were affected by the pandemic
(27% vs 19% in those not affected, p<0.05, Table 3). Similarly, the proportion of participants
with lower wellbeing during gestational week 11-20 was higher among those reporting impact by
the pandemic on their lives (70% vs 42% in those not affected, p<0.05, Table 3). No statistically
significant differences were found in other periods in pregnancy or with regards to anxiety
symptoms.
Furthermore, participants who reported they were socially isolated, more often reported anxiety
scores over the cut-off (12 vs. 4%) during gestational weeks 11-20. Interestingly, among those
reporting more social isolation, there was a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms among those
reporting that the isolation felt mostly hard (12%) or mostly positive (11%), compared to those
reporting that it did not feel special (2%) or those reporting no social isolation (4%) (Table 3).
A positive correlation was found between the total score of wellbeing and mobility (rho=0.76,
p=0.01), reaching a rho=0.83, p=0.003 for the WHO-5 question “My everyday life has been full

of things that interest me” (Figure 2a). Similarly, strong statistically significant positive
correlations were shown between both depression and anxiety scores and search volumes on
corona via Google Trends (rho=0.87 and 0.83 respectively; Figure 2b). In a sensitivity analysis
excluding the month of July, both the total score of wellbeing as well as the WHO-5 question
“My everyday life has been full of things that interest me” remained statistically significantly
correlated with mobility (rho=0.73, p=0.03 and rho=0.82, p=0.007 respectively).
Table 4 presents a compilation of the women’s free responses to the open questions regarding
healthcare during the pandemic across pregnancy and childbirth. The answers have been divided
into different categories, and next to it, one or more quotes. The participants expressed loss of
support when partners were excluded from attending visits at the maternity center and ultrasound
examinations. Many comments addressed the risks of the partner missing out during the delivery
of the child, as no-one with the slightest symptoms could be accompanying the delivering
woman. Moreover, other support stemming from relatives or doulas was not allowed, which
further enhanced worry and distress. When participants mentioned that check-ups had been
canceled/postponed, they usually referred to ultrasound examinations or combined ultrasound
and biochemical screening. Moreover, they also reported meetings with other professionals, such
as social workers postponed or cancelled. Some participants also felt unsafe about their health
care. They experienced miscommunication and insufficient information from health care
professionals. Referrals had been rejected due to the strain caused by COVID-19. Some
comments referred to the notion that online or phone meetings were not satisfactory regarding
the level of care.

Main findings
We used a novel study method, the research mobile application Mom2B, to assess, for the first
time, in nearly real time self-reported perinatal depressive symptoms and data on SARS-CoV-2
treatment, symptoms, impact on everyday life and perceived health care, as well as symptoms of
depression, anxiety and wellbeing. Data from 1345 pregnant women at a national level between
January and October 2020 in Sweden were utilized to investigate the potential changes in mood
and behaviors during the pandemic. An increase in depressive symptoms and decrease in total
wellbeing was shown during the months with the highest pandemic impact in Sweden (April,
May) followed by normalization during the subsequent months and a new peak in October, when
cases started to surge again. Approximately 24% of pregnant women reported depression scores
above cut-off in screening instruments during April and May, with a subsequent tendency to
increase again as the infectious rates started rising by October 2020. These results are in sharp
contrast to the reported rates, estimated at around 12%, in different Swedish cohorts during
earlier years (27, 28). No associations were found between treatment or symptoms of SARSCoV-2 and changes in mood and general wellbeing.

Previous literature
The present findings are in general congruent with recent research providing mounting evidence
for an increase in the levels of anxiety and depression among pregnant women during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Several studies in China, Japan, Turkey, Pakistan, Qatar, US and Canada
have reported that 15% up to 35% of women scored high EPDS scores (above 12-13) during
pregnancy and early postpartum period because of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (2, 6, 7, 14, 2935). A Canadian study also showed higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms,

dissociative symptoms, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, negative affectivity and less
positive affectivity in a COVID-19 cohort compared to a pre-COVID-19 cohort of pregnant
women (36). Analyzing the comments from pregnant women in the Mom2B cohort, it is
noteworthy that most women reported less access to healthcare facilities, less satisfaction about
the quality of healthcare delivery, as well as less support during pregnancy; in general, most
emotions and experiences were negative. However, not all women provided comments and thus,
we cannot conclude whether the expressed emotions were representative of all women; however,
the present results are in line with recent studies. Specifically, consistent with our results, a
previous Swedish study including a regional population-based cohort showed increased levels of
health-related worry in pregnant women during the months of the pandemic (February-August
2020) (37), whereas other studies have also reported increased levels of anxiety and depression
due to loss of supportive perinatal services and uncertainty about the novel coronavirus disease
(38).
At baseline, Sweden provides healthcare at minimal cost to all inhabitants including mental
health services (39, 40). Moreover, Sweden is among the countries with the lowest rates of
preterm births (between 5-6%) (41), likely due to the economic stability of the country and the
focus of the government on perinatal health, as well as on the timely and adequate access to
healthcare services (42). Despite the fact that the Swedish COVID-19 strategy did not include a
general lockdown, but was instead based on voluntary social distancing guidelines (16), we still
find a clear association of theCOVID-19 pandemic with the mental health of pregnant women.
Notably during spring, even in Sweden, some extra screenings for chromosomal aberrations and
services for fear of childbirth were not available in some regions; and concurrently, partners
were not allowed to stay after delivery at the hospital. During the whole period, healthcare has

been affected through reduced staff, fewer physical appointments and restrictions to access
healthcare for individuals with symptoms of common cold. While online consultations are an
effective way of providing safe care during the outbreak, the basic elements of the patient-doctor
or midwife relation may be reduced, and the sense of genuine connection was lost (43), which
was also reported by the participants in the Mom2B study. Further research is needed to
understand individuals’ thoughts on access to care in different health care systems during the
pandemic.
It is of note that women who did not report symptoms of the COVID-19 infection self-reported
higher levels of anxiety. In general, data from the Mom2B cohort indicated that infected women
did not feel greater anxiety and depression compared to not affected women. One reason might
be that most infected cases were mild; thus, the SARS-CoV-2 mild infection might be a relief to
these women compared to the worry of the otherwise unknown, and potentially severe impact of
the disease. Moreover, although data on other adverse effects of COVID-19 notably on the rates
of preterm birth and other obstetric complications is quickly being gathered and analyzed,
findings remain inconsistent so far; therefore, women in Sweden did not receive any relevant
information on these complications during their visits to maternity care.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, pregnant women in most countries have faced the effects of
social isolation and restrictions in mobility, e.g., in Ireland, an exercise limit of one to two
kilometers from home, while all other journeys outside to be made only for provision of essential
services and goods (44). Previous studies have reported a significant association of social
isolation with exacerbation of domestic violence and poor mental health outcomes (44-46). A
Spanish internet-based study showed that confinement decreased both the level of vigorous and
moderate physical activity that pregnant women had engaged in, as well as the time they spent

walking, and doubled the number of hours they spent sitting; moreover, confinement negatively
affected their health-related quality of life (47). Our results showed that not only social isolation,
but also the emotional connotations of the fewer health care appointments and other downstream
effects of the pandemic are probably associated with increased risk of anxious symptoms. They
further support the findings linked to restricted movement, showing a strong inverse correlation
between the distance travelled away from home (reduced during April-May, and again in
October, according to voluntary recommendations) and wellbeing. The directionality of the
association is difficult to decipher using group data; yet, future studies are expected to examine if
movement changes precede the decrease in wellbeing. In addition, the possible role of vacations
during summer months, with low cases and increased mobility for the holidays might contribute
to these findings. Nevertheless, earlier studies did not in general show statistically significantly
lower levels of perinatal depression symptoms during summer months compared to spring (28).
Further, sensitivity analysis excluding July, which is the usual vacation month for Sweden, did
not significantly alter the results.
Health-seeking behaviors, such as online searches, have been extensively analyzed for
monitoring other diseases, such as seasonal influenza in the past (48); however, to our
knowledge, such strong correlation, as the one found herein between google search volumes for
an infectious disease (such as COVID-19) and mental health outcomes, has never been reported
before. If this finding is replicated in future research, internet search volumes for global health
emergencies could be a useful proxy of the mental health status at population level, enhancing
public health monitoring and interventions.

Strengths and limitations

The novel way provided through the Mom2B application to introduce new questions and gather
self-reported information in a user-friendly way at national level is a strength of this study.
Future research could further address whether possible preventive interventions might be
incorporated and delivered directly through the application, adding to the health care systems
arsenal during crises.
Among the limitations of the present study, we should first acknowledge that selection bias
should be considered: only 1% of the background eligible population contributed data; the
application cannot be used by women not able to communicate in Swedish, or those not owning
a mobile smartphone (8%). Nonetheless, the present results are in line with another recent
Swedish study with better representation (37). We cannot exclude a potential bias in the results
due to the self-reported nature of the information gathered. In addition, we used the EPDS and
WHO-5 scores for outcome assessment, which are validated screening questionnaires, and
sensitive in identifying women likely to suffer from perinatal mood or anxiety disorders;
however, these tools are not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of perinatal depression or
anxiety. Data on mobility at the individual level would have allowed for more advanced
analyses, which could address directionality in the associations with mood; this will be possible
in the near future. Lastly, the ongoing use of Mom2B, allowing for a longer follow-up period and
the ongoing recruitment of new participants will allow further analyses to be performed,
controlling for potential confounders and mediators, and looking even to other passively
collected data on mobile and internet use, which were not feasible at this stage.

Utilizing a novel application, we observed an increase in depressive symptoms and decrease in
wellbeing during the first months of the pandemic in Sweden, followed by a return to baseline
levels during summer, and a new rise in October following the new surge in COVID-19 cases in
the country. Strong correlations between mobility as well as internet searches and wellbeing
were noted. Key themes were identified including worry about the impact of the virus on health,
worry about access to healthcare, as well as social and economic impacts secondary to the
pandemic. The Mom2B application further allowed us to gather data in a user-friendly way
among pregnant women as the pandemic was evolving; such tools are expected to be useful as
other disasters occur and unfold. Lastly, the present results, supported by previous studies in
different settings, suggest that there may be protective and resilience factors associated with
different healthcare systems, highlighting the need to consider the policy decisions’ impact on
perinatal mental health. As the goal of maternity care is to identify and reduce the risks of ill
health, mental ill health should be promptly identified, especially during periods of crises,
whereas substantial preventive efforts should be put in place to minimizing the adverse events on
perinatal mental health.
