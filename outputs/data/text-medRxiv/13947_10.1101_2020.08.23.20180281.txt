Abstract
The D614G mutation of the Spike protein is thought to be relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Here we report biological and epidemiological aspects of this mutation. Using pseudotyped
lentivectors, we were able to confirm that the G614 variant of the Spike protein is markedly
more infectious than the ancestral D614 variant. We demonstrate by molecular modelling that
the replacement of aspartate by glycine in position 614 facilitates the transition towards an
open state of the Spike protein. To understand whether the increased infectivity of the D614
variant explains its epidemiological success, we analysed the evolution of 27,086 high-quality
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from GISAID. We observed striking coevolution of D614G
with the P323L mutation in the viral polymerase. Importantly, exclusive presence of G614 or
L323 did not become epidemiologically relevant. In contrast, the combination of the two
mutations gave rise to a viral G/L variant that has all but replaced the initial D/P variant. There
was no significant correlation between reported COVID mortality in different countries and the
prevalence of the Wuhan versus G/L variant. However, when comparing the speed of
emergence and the ultimate predominance in individual countries, the G/L variant displays
major epidemiological supremacy. Our results suggest that the P323L mutation, located in the
interface domain of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is a necessary alteration
that led to the epidemiological success of the present variant of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
The recent pandemic caused by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus took the world
by surprise. As opposed to previous coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS,
the new viral strain is not characterised by a particularly high case fatality rate, but rather by
unprecedented infectivity and epidemiological success1. Indeed, the virus has so far largely
resisted all attempts of eradication, despite stringent measures taken in many countries around
the globe.
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus, yet all coronaviruses differ from other RNA viruses
in several respects. They have a large genome and a sophisticated life cycle which is still
poorly understood. Also, coronaviruses have a proof-reading machinery, which confers a
relatively stable genome, as compared to other types of RNA viruses 2-4. Finally, given the
magnitude of the pandemic, prevalent SARS-CoV-2 mutations leading to amino acid changes
are relatively rare.
The SARS-CoV-2 transmembrane Spike glycoprotein (S-protein) is the most abundant protein
of the viral envelope. It mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors and
a subsequent fusion between the viral and the host cell membranes to facilitate viral entry 5.
The S-protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein, which exists in a metastable pre-fusion
conformation, divided into two main functional subunits responsible for binding to the host cell
receptor (S1 subunit) and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (S2 subunit, Figure 1a).
The trimer exists mainly in two distinct conformational states resulting from an opening of the
receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit: ‘up’ or ‘down’ (Figure 1a). The ‘up‘
conformation exposes the RBD to cell surface receptors of the host, which would otherwise
be buried (‘down’ conformation) at the interface of each monomer 6. This conformational
change is required for proteolytic processing and/or fusion of the S2 domain with the host cell
membrane. It is now understood that a variety of proteases, including the PC family of
proteases, trypsin-like proteases and cathepsins are able to cleave the spike protein 7.
The S-protein D614G mutation has received attention given that it could potentially alter the
viral attachment, fusogenicity and/or immunogenicity. The mutation has been suggested to
increase infectivity 8 and/or the case fatality rate 9. More recent studies have demonstrated
that the G614 variant indeed enhances viral entry into cells 10,11.
SARS-CoV-2 employs a multi-subunit replication/transcription machinery 12. A set of nonstructural proteins (nsp) produced as cleavage products of the ORF1a and ORF1b viral
polyproteins assemble to facilitate viral replication and transcription, making this machinery a
potential target for therapeutic intervention 13. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp or
nsp12) is a key player in the synthesis of viral RNA. The recently resolved crystal structure of
SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 in complex with its nsp7 and nsp8 co-factors underlines the central role
these non-structural proteins have in the replication and transcription of the virus 13,14. The
P323L mutation of the RdRp has received less attention; however, it has been suggested that
this mutation might alter viral proof reading and thereby lead to an increased down-stream
mutation rate 15.

In this study, we investigated the emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with concomitant
mutations in the S-protein and RdR-polymerase. Both mutations are in strategically relevant
sites of the respective proteins and hence candidates to alter the biology of the virus. We show
that the G614/L323 viral variant, but not the individual G614 or L323 mutants, is
epidemiologically highly successful and over the last months has largely replaced the original
D614/P323 variant.

Results
S-protein D614G increases cell transduction of pseudotyped lentivectors
Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on binding of viral S-proteins to cellular receptors and
subsequent priming by proteases of the host cell 16. Our first aim was to establish cell lines
that consistently express the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, which is
recognised by SARS-CoV-2; and relevant proteases, such as transmembrane serine protease
2 (TMRSS2), which cleaves the S-protein. As seen in Figure 2a and b, neither HeLa cells nor
A549 cells expressed relevant amounts of ACE2 mRNA. Similarly, mRNA levels of TMRSS2
were almost undetectable. However, both cell lines express low to intermediate gene levels of
furin and moderately high levels of cathepsin L (Figure 2). Furin is able to cleave the spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2, while cathepsin L is able to cleave S-proteins from both SARS-CoV1 and SARS-CoV-2 7. In order to establish cell lines permissive for S-protein pseudotyped
lentivectors, we transduced both HeLa and A549 cells with either ACE2 alone, TMPRSS2
alone or in combination.
To understand the impact of the S-protein D614G mutation on infectivity, we produced Sprotein pseudotyped lentivectors. Specifically, we used full length and C-terminally truncated
D614 protein, as well as full length and C-terminally truncated G614 S-protein. We included
the C-terminal truncation, as it has been shown previously to increase transduction with spike
pseudotyped subviral particles, probably due to the removal of a retention sequence 17. Our
pseudotyped lentivectors expressed both a secreted luciferase, as well as GFP; therefore,
measurements were performed by luminescence detection and flow cytometry.
As expected, exposure of wild type (mock-transduced) HeLa or A549 cells to the lentivectors
described above did not lead to GFP or luciferase expression, which suggests that these cells
were not permissive to transduction by our pseudotyped lentivectors (Figure 2c-f). Similarly,
overexpression of TMPRSS2 by itself did not lead to detectable transduction. Using the D614
pseudotyped lentivector, low-level transduction of ACE2 and ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing
HeLa cells were observed, but which was hardly detectable with A549 cells. This changed
markedly when the G614 pseudotyped vector was used, with there being significant
transduction of both ACE2-expressing cell lines. Once again, transduction of ACE2-expressing
HeLa cells was significantly higher than for ACE2-expressing A549 cells. Interestingly,
overexpression of TMRPSS2 in combination with ACE2 expression led to an additive
enhancement of transduction in A549 cells, which was not the case for HeLa cells. We
hypothesized that our HeLa cell line most likely had high-level expression of a yet to be defined

S-protein cleaving protease, and that overexpression of TMRPSS2 is not required for efficient
transduction. In contrast, in A549 cells, proteolytic cleavage appears to be rate-limiting, and
overexpression of TMRPSS2 is required to enhance transduction.
D614G mutation alters the interactions around the point of the mutation
Recently, several trajectories from long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the S-protein
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been released to the public domain (CC BY 4.0) 18. These long
simulations (10 s) were obtained in specialised supercomputers 19. For the present analysis,
we used two trajectories of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein 18. The first simulation
was initiated from the closed, “down” conformation (PDB entry 6VXX), and the second one
from a partially open, “up”, conformation (PDB entry 6VYB) 20. The simulated structures contain
modelled missing loops from the crystal structures and glycans 21. Although no conformational
transitions between the two states are observed during these long trajectories, the analysis of
the dynamics of the key interactions around the point of mutation helps to better understand
the effect of the latter.
The pairwise (all-to-all) root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) matrix of the S-protein shows for
both closed and open simulations that the starting crystal structure relaxes quickly, leading to
a different stable conformation with respect to the initial one due to the effect of the glycan
dynamics (Supplementary Figure 1). The overall dynamics of the domains of the protein is
different. While the S2 subunit and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit are very
stable for all three protomers in both the closed and open conformations, the RBD domain of
protomer A exhibits a noticeable change between the two conformations. Specifically, its
RMSD in the up conformation is higher than in the down one due to its solvent exposure
(Supplementary Figure 2). It is worth noting that the RBD domain in the up conformation
explores two states during the dynamics, as the presence of the glycans affects the initial
crystal structure conformation. In the MD simulation with all three RBD domains in the down
state (closed conformation), the D614 from chain A forms a salt bridge with K835 in the
adjacent chain C (Figure 1b upper panel, green). In the open conformation, where the RBD
domain of protomer A is in the up state, this salt bridge is lost and D614 in protomer A turns
inwards facing the core of the S2 subunit forming hydrogen bond with P862 of protomer C
(Figure 1b upper panel, pink).
The interactions involving D614, once the structures are fully relaxed after MD simulations,
clearly reveal a different behaviour between the closed and open conformations. The D614G
mutation will disrupt the formation of the D614(A)-K835(C) salt bridge in the closed
conformation, but very little will change in the open conformation (Figure 1c). The D614G

mutation stabilizes the open conformation of the S-protein as the pairwise RMSD correlation
matrix is very stable (Supplementary Figure 2) even for the RDB (A) domain exposed to the
solvent. A recent pre-print points in the same direction where negative stain electron
microscopy reconstructions of the D614G form of the S-protein shows that the mutation
favours the ‘up’ conformation, 82% population compared to 42% in the wild type 22.
Two abundant amino acid changes in SARS-CoV-2: S protein D614G and RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) P323L
27,084 genomic sequences from GISAID (www.gisaid.org/) 23, representing 87 countries over
the time period of 24 December 2019 to 19 June 2020, were used to perform the
epidemiological study. Using the original D614/P323 variant (NC_045512.2) as a reference,
we identified two highly abundant SARS-CoV-2 mutations leading to amino acid changes: the
D614G mutation in the S-protein, and the P323L mutation in the RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp). Figure 3a-b shows the weekly frequency of these mutations in the viral
sequences over time (log scale), while Figure 3c-d shows the percentage of the respective
mutants within a given week. Until mid- January 2020, both mutations were virtually absent in
the available sequences. Thereafter, we can observe a notable increase in frequency of this
mutant, with a virtually complete replacement of the original sequences by May 2020. A striking
similar increase in frequency of both the D614G and P323L mutations should be noted.

week (a, note the logarithmic scale) or percent of sequences per week (b).

Co-emergence and concurrence of the D614G and the P323L mutations
Similar kinetics in the appearance of D614G and P323L led us to further analyse the
relationship between the two mutations. Figure 4a shows the occurrence of the four possible
variants: D614/P323 (i.e., the original D614/P323 variant), G614/P323 (mutation only in the Sprotein), D614/L323 (mutation only in RdRp), and G614/L323 (mutations in both the S-protein

high-quality sequences of SARS-CoV-2 (27 075) were analysed. (a) G614/L323 (double mutant) represented more
than two-thirds, and D614/P323 (the original Wuhan sequence) about one-third of sequences; the single mutant

and RdRp). In our dataset, these variants were first reported as follows: D614/P323 on 201912-24; G614/P323 on 2020-01-24, D614/L323 on 2020-03-10, and G614/L323 on 2020-0124. Interestingly, only the double mutation G614/L323 was epidemiologically successful and
presently accounts for ~70% of all available SARS-CoV-2 sequences; while the original Wuhan
sequence, accounts for ~30%. The single mutants account for only 0.3% (G614/P323) and
0.1% (D614/L323) of all sequences. To investigate the emergence and spread of the strains,
we analysed the weekly numbers of sequences (Figure 4b) and the cumulative number of
sequences (Figure 4c) of D614/P323 and G614/L323 variants. There was an evident first wave
from December 2019 to February 2020, which was strongly dominated by the D614/P323
variant. From March 2020, a second wave with a predominance of the G614/L323 variant can
be observed. We also observed major differences between the variants in different countries
(Figure 4d). For example, while D614/P323 was the largely dominant variant in Hong Kong,
South Korea and China; G614/L323 was almost exclusively observed in countries such as
Switzerland, Czechia and Argentina. We also note that the occurrence of single mutants
(G614/P323 and D614/L323) continued to be rare.
To better understand the relationship between the dynamics and geographic aspects of the
pandemic, we analysed the weekly and cumulative numbers of sequences (Figure 5) in
different countries (only countries with at least 20 sequences were included in this analysis).
At first glance, the D614/P323 variant can be observed as the dominant strain in the initial
wave in Asian countries, while the G614/L323 variant was the main driver of the pandemic in
other continents. However, in several Asian countries, including Taiwan, Thailand, Japan; the
emergence of G614/L323 can be observed at later time points. Also, in many non-Asian
countries, the pandemic started with the D614/P323 variant, followed by a strong
predominance of the G614/L323 variant (e.g. Italy, UK, USA). Thus, country-by-country data
do not suggest a simple geographic predominance or a bottleneck in the transmission that led
to a random emergence of G614/L323 in non-Asian countries. Rather, it appears that
G614/L323 is epidemiologically more successful than the original D614/P323 variant.
We also investigated the case fatality rate in different countries as a function of the percentage
of D614/P323 vs. G614/L323. We found no significant correlation between strain
predominance and either deaths by million population (Figure 6a) or case fatality rate (Figure
6b). However, we cannot entirely exclude such a correlation, as there was a weak trend

Figure 6. SARS-CoV-2 variants: mortality, case fatality rate, and patient status. Relationship between the
percentage of the two main SARS-CoV-2 variants (D614/P323 and G614/L323) in different countries and (a)
number of deaths per 100 000 population and (b) case fatality rate in the respective countries. Numbers of deaths
per 100 000 population and case fatality rates were taken from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center
(coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality) at 4th of august 2020.

We next investigated the epidemiological parameters in more detail. In 66 countries,
sequences of both the D614/P323 variant and the G614/L323 were reported. In 37 countries,
the D614/P323 variant was reported before the G614/L323 (Figure 7a, light blue bars); while
in 24 countries, the double mutation was reported first (Figure 7a, dark blue bars). In five
countries, both variants were reported for the first time on the same date. Note that even in
countries where the D614/P323 variant was reported more than 20 days before the
G614/L323, ultimately a clear predominance of the G614/L323 variant was observed (e.g.
Belgium, USA, France). We therefore decided to compare the spread of the two dominant
strains and the single mutant variants in different countries with respect to the total number of
sequences collected within 14 days following the emergence of each respective strain (only
countries with at least five sequences at day 14 were included). As shown in Figure 7b, the

emergence of the single mutant strain was slow and of low efficiency. The D614/P323 variant
shows a relatively slow emergence, which increases mostly after seven days. In contrast, the
G614/L323 strain emerged very rapidly and efficiently. When comparing the rate at which the
strains emerge within the given countries, the difference between the D614/P323 variant and
the G614/L323 strain was statistically significant (p-value < 2.2e-16; Wilcoxon signed rank test
with continuity correction).
P323L mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp polymerase
The SARS-CoV-2 polymerase RdRp has an overall architecture that resembles the one seen
in SARS-CoV-1 and consists of a nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex. The structure of the SARS-CoV2 nsp12 contains a cupped, right-handed RdRp domain linked to a nidovirus RdRp-associated
nucleotidyl-transferase domain (NiRAN) via an interface domain. The RdRp domain adopts
the conserved architecture of the viral polymerase family 4 and is composed of three domains:
a fingers domain, a palm domain and a thumb domain (Figure 8). The nsp12 is stabilised by a
nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer, which is packed against the thumb-finger interface, and a single nsp8
monomer interacting with the finger and interface domains. The P323L mutation is located on
the interface domain of nsp12, and specifically on the loop that connects the three helices of
the interface domain to the three β-strands of the same domain.

Although P323 engages only in a single interdomain interaction with F396 of the finger domain
(Figure 8), L323 is expected to affect the local dynamics of the regions around the point of the
mutation. The conformational freedom of the proline rich 321FPPTS325 stretch, where the P323L
mutation lies, is expected to be limited due to the pyrrolidine ring of the two Pro residues, which
provide a degree of local structural rigidity. Phe has been shown to be over-represented in
sequence positions immediately following Pro-Pro motifs in protein turns and NMR data have
shown a strong Proi-Phei+2 CαΗ - π interaction that restricts the rotation of the Phe side chain
24
. Therefore, although L323 will still in principle be able to interact with F396, the mutation is
expected to increase the flexibility of this region.
A mutagenesis study has confirmed the functional role of nsp7 and nsp8 in SARS-CoV-1
replication 25. Specifically, Subissi et al. identified three nsp8 residues (P116, P183, and R190)
that are critical for the nsp8/nsp12 interaction in vitro and in vivo, and the reported impaired
SAR-CoV-1 polymerase activity in mutant variants underlines the key role of these residues in
the nsp8/nsp12 association and subsequent SARS-CoV-1 RNA synthesis 25. Although similar
experiments have to be carried out for the case of SARS-CoV-2, R190 and P116 are very
close in space to the point of the P323L mutation, and P116 interacts directly with S325 of the
321
FPPTS325 stretch (Figure 8). Therefore, we anticipate the P323L mutation to have an impact
on the nsp8 association. The level of association of nsp8 has been shown to be an important
factor for obtaining a high RNA polymerase activity in SARS-CoV-1 25, and therefore enhanced
interaction between the nsp12 and nsp8 upon the P323L mutation may give an evolutionary
advantage to the virus.

Discussion
Compared to DNA-based organisms, RNA viruses are generally believed to replicate their
genetic material with lower accuracy, as they lack the necessary proofreading and correction
mechanisms 26. Given the high mutation rate seen in viruses, the mutations that give an
advantage to the virus and, therefore, are successful, are fine-tuned through evolutionary
pressure. Here, we have analysed the structural and functional impact of the widely discussed
S-protein mutation D614G and investigated whether it provides by itself an epidemiological
advantage to the SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that indeed, this single amino acid
substitution from aspartate to glycine at position 614 significantly enhances the infectivity of
pseudotyped lentivectors. Through molecular modelling, we suggest that the G614 amino acid
substitution destabilizes the closed conformation, while it does not alter the stability of the open
one. The transition towards the open state is thought to be required for viral fusion, 5 and thus
a structurally favoured open state is in line with the higher infectivity demonstrated by our
biochemical assays.
However, epidemiological data suggests that the D614G mutation is not exclusively
responsible as a driver mutation of SARS-CoV-2. The time series for emergence of the D614G
and P323L mutations indicates that the S-protein mutation (D614G) evolved simultaneously
with P323L in RdRp. We observed small clusters of the G614/P323 single mutant variant on
two occasions: February 2020 in Germany, and June 2020 in India. Yet, these clusters were

always transient and failed to make major epidemiological contributions. Thus, our data
suggest that the P323L mutation of the polymerase plays an important role in the present
epidemiological success of D614G and SARS-CoV-2 in general.
Although more experiments are needed to understand the underlying biological relevance of
the two mutations, we speculate that the P323L mutation attenuates the clinical presentation
of the SARS-CoV-2. Firstly, based on its location, we expect the P323L mutation to negatively
impact the nsp8 association. The level of association of nsp8 has been shown to be an
important factor for obtaining high RNA polymerase activity in SARS-CoV-1 25, and thus P323L
is likely to attenuate polymerase activity in SARS-CoV-2. Secondly, experience from SARSCoV-1 and MERS suggests that a more aggressive virus is – from a public health perspective
– easier to eliminate (it is easier to diagnose acute disease with few asymptomatic carriers).
Indeed, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS resulted in higher case fatality rates relative to SARS-CoV2, but were both epidemiologically less successful 1. Patients were arguably identified sooner,
and therefore isolated more rapidly. Alternatively, infected individuals passed away before
allowing the virus to spread within communities.
Our present working hypothesis is as follows: the P323L RdRp mutation decreases the
production of viral RNA and hence the severity of the disease and symptoms. Such a viral
variant would be more difficult to detect but would also have a disadvantage with respect to
transmission. The D614G S-protein mutation would allow the virus to be transmitted even by
an asymptomatic individual because of its ability to infect cells more efficiently, which would
allow the transmission of the disease even if only few virions are present.
What do we know about the underlying molecular mechanisms? Regarding the S-protein, the
analysis of publicly available simulations reveals an interesting interaction network around the
D614 residue. The main interactions change between the two molecular dynamics datasets,
observing a cooperative effect among protomers following the symmetry of the oligomer. We
believe that the mutation of D614 will disrupt the interactions that couple the AC, CB and BA
interfaces. In particular, none of the salt bridges related to D614 could be formed, shifting the
conformational population to a more open-like situation (Figure 1a-b). Therefore, the D614G
mutation observed more prevalently in specific regions might help to reduce the energetic cost
of the conformational transition needed to attach to the cell receptors. In the case of the RdRp,
the P323L mutation is located far from the RNA binding domain, which lies within the fingerpalm-thumb domains and, therefore, any direct effect of the mutation to the ability of the
mutated RdRp to bind RNA should be excluded. However, the mutation could exert its effect
allosterically. Since allosteric effects are impossible to be inferred by static crystal structures,
simulation techniques can be employed to further elucidate the effect of the mutation on the
dynamics of the interface domain and the NiNAR, fingers, and palm domains that are in direct
contact with the domain where the mutation is found. Moreover, experiments on the stability
of the P323L variant are needed, since changes in the stability of the mutated nsp12 could
alter its cellular concentration, which would subsequently affect the replication rate of the virus
within the host cell.
Taken together, our study demonstrates that the mutation D614G in S-protein has high
infectivity in cellular systems and provides a structural explanation of this effect through

molecular modelling. Our data, however, are not compatible with the concept that the D614G
S-protein mutation by itself is sufficient to explain the epidemiological success of the presently
predominant SARS-CoV-2 strain. The coevolution of the S-protein mutation with the P323L
mutation of the RdRp is striking and appears to be crucial for the success of the viral strain.
We provide a working hypothesis where the polymerase mutation attenuates the symptoms
and severity of the infection, while the spike mutation improves the ability of the D614G spike
variant to infect cells.

Methods
Cell lines and culture
Cells were maintained in Dulbecco modiﬁed Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg/ml of penicillin and streptomycin, 2 mM l-glutamine, 1
mM sodium pyruvate and 1% non-essential amino acids. Cultures were maintained at 37˚C in
a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Human cell lines used in the study were HEK 293T/17 (human kidney,
ATC C#CRL-11268), A549 cells and HeLa cells
Luciferase reporter assay.
Cells were transduced with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein lentiviral vectors encoding GFP and
Gaussia luciferase (Gluc). Four to five days later, GLuc activity was measured by adding 5 uL
of the cell supernatant sample to 50 uL of room temperature assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 35
mM EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 300 mM sodium ascorbate, 4 μM coelenterazine in 1X phosphatebuffered saline [PBS]) and immediately measuring luminescence in a luminometer (Glomax;
Promega).
Generation of cell lines expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2.
HeLa and A549 cells were plated at a density of 2E05 cells per well in a 12 well plate. The day
after cells were co-transduced either with ACE2/puromycin and/or TMPRSS2/blasticidin
lentiviruses. Four day after transduction, cells were selected with blasticidin amd puromycin at
5 μg/ml. Cells were maintained as polyclonal population.
Plasmids
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 cDNA ORFs were purchased from GenSript and were cloned into pCDHCMV-MCS-EF1α-Puro and pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1α-Blast lentivectors respectively using
standard cloning methods. pCG1_SCoV-2 plasmid encoding SARS-CoV-2 S-protein was
provided by Prof. Dr. Stefan Pöhlmann (Deutsches Primatenzentrum, Leibniz-Institute for
Primate research, Göttingen, Germany). G614 S-protein was cloned using site-directed
mutagenesis with the following primers: 5’-GCGTGAACTGTACCGAAGTG-3’ and 5’CCTGGTACAGCACTGCC-3’. C-terminal 19 amino acids truncated version of the SARS-CoV2

packaging plasmid (psPAX2, gift from Didier Trono [Addgene plasmid 12260]), and 5 μg of
envelope (pMD2G, gift from Didier Trono [Addgene plasmid 12259]). The medium was
changed 8 h post-transfection. After 48 h, the viral supernatants were collected and filtered
using 45 µm PVDF filters and stored at -80°C.
SARS-CoV-2 S-protein pseudotyped lentiviral production
Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus were produced by co-transfection 293T cells with psPAX2,
pCDH-CMV-Gluc-EF1α- GFP, and plasmids encoding either SARS-CoV-2 S-protein D614 full
length (FL), S-protein G614 full length (FL), S-protein D614 DeltaCter (DL), S-protein G614
DeltaCter (DL) or empty vector by using the calcium phosphate method as described above.
SARS-CoV-2 S-protein pseudotyped lentiviral infectivity assays
HeLa and A549 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1000 cells per well and
inoculated with 50 μL media containing S-protein pseudovirions. After two-day incubation, cells
were washed with PBS and the media was refreshed. Two days later, supernatants were
collected to measure Gaussia luciferase activity. The cells were trypsynized and resuspended
in PBS and were analysed by flow cytometry using Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Data were analysed using FlowJo 11 (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR)
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from A549 and HeLa cell lines using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen).
Complementary DNA was synthesized from total RNA using PrimeScript™ RT Reagent kit

Epidemiological data
Metadata and 36,105 sequences specified as ‘complete’ and ‘high coverage’ were retrieved
from GISAID (www.gisaid.org/) 23 as of 30 June 2020. Only sequences that had metadata
information were filtered further to contain human as host, a full date including month of the
day and that were collected before 22 June 2020, leaving a total of 34,841 sequences. The
latter, together with the reference sequence (NC_045512.2), were used to perform multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) using MAFFT 4 (v7.453) with default parameters. We retained only
sequences where the first amino acid in S and RdRp protein were identical to the reference
proteins, respectively. Next we filtered out sequences that contained non-nucleotide bases
e.g. ‘N’ and whose sequence length was different from the respective reference gene. We kept
only sequences that corresponded to these criteria for both S protein and RdRp, leaving a total
of 27,084 sequences. Among these there were two variants for both S-protein and RdRp
protein representing the vast majority of sequences (Supplementary Figure 4). Due to the very
low number of other sequence variants (N614 S-protein and F323, H323, S323 in the RdRp

protein), we removed sequences containing other variants, leaving us with 27 075 sequenced
genomes for further analysis.
Unless stated otherwise only countries that had sequenced a minimum of 20 genomes were
used in the analysis. However, for Worldwide analysis, all countries were included. All plots
were done using ggplot2 in R. The correlation plots were done using ggscatter function from
the ‘ggpubr’ library. The statistical interference between the two dominant variants was
performed using pairwise ‘wilcox.test’ function.
S-protein modelling
The simulations of S-protein used the Amber ff99SB-ILDN force field for proteins 27, the
CHARMM TIP3P model 28 for water, and the generalised Amber force field 29,30 for glycosylated
asparagine. The system was neutralized and salted with 0.15 M concentration of NaCl. The
interval between frames of the analysed trajectories is 1.2 ns, and the simulations were run at
310 K in the NPT ensemble.
