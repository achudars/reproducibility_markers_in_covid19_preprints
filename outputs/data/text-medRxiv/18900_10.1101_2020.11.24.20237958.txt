Abstract
Studies related to COVID-19 increasingly use electronic health records (EHR) to obtain largescale evidence. However, EHR-based research must be performed with care because it can
involve new study design problems that are unfamiliar to much of the medical community.
Haimovich et al. (2020) sought to inform COVID-19 practice by evaluating temporal artery
thermometers (TATs). They retrospectively searched EHR for temperatures measured twice
within 15 minutes, including once with a TAT. The TAT often disagreed with reference
measurements, so Haimovich et al. concluded TATs perform poorly. Here, we extended
Haimovich et al.’s study design to all other major thermometer types using the eICU
Collaborative Research Database. We retrospectively identified 80,065 pairs of quickly retaken
temperatures from 24,765 adult U.S. critical care patients treated in 2014-2015. We found that
oral, tympanic, and axillary thermometers disagreed with reference measurements as much as
TATs did. Moreover, all thermometer types showed unprecedentedly worse agreement than
observed in research using other study designs: every thermometer type broke ±0.9°F (±0.5°C)
limits of clinically acceptable agreement by >2-fold and no type satisfied basic standards for
repeatability. A natural explanation for these findings is that clinicians often retook temperatures
within minutes because of user or patient errors during measurement, such as probe
misplacement or patient movement. This means that quickly retaken EHR measurements do not

Quickly retaken temperatures
Introduction

Studies related to COVID-19 increasingly use electronic health records (EHR) to obtain largescale evidence. However, EHR-based research must be performed with care because it can
involve new study design problems that are unfamiliar to much of the medical community.
Recently, Haimovich et al.1 sought to inform COVID-19 screening practices by evaluating
temporal artery (forehead) thermometers (TATs). They retrospectively searched EHR for
temperatures measured twice within 15 minutes, including once with a TAT. The TAT often
disagreed with a reference measurement, so Haimovich et al. concluded TATs perform poorly.
Here, we extended Haimovich et al.’s analysis to other major thermometer types. We found that
oral, tympanic, and axillary thermometers disagreed with reference measurements as much as
TATs did. A natural explanation is that clinicians retook temperatures because they suspected a
measurement had been taken incorrectly. This makes retaken EHR temperatures invalid for
evaluating the accuracy and precision of correctly used thermometers, and also invalid for
suggesting a revised COVID-19 fever threshold, which Haimovich et al. did. Our study provides
an illustrative example of the unexpected study design problems that can undermine EHR-based
research.

Methods
All study data2 and code3 are available online. The eICU Collaborative Research Database v2.0
provides deidentified EHR from 2014-2015, including 139,367 intensive care unit patients at 204
US hospitals.4 In this retrospective, observational research, we studied 154 hospitals with ≥50
chart records listing studied thermometer sites. Excluding 4,852 patients aged <18 years and
1431 without temperature records, 108,970 adult patients and 5,304,829 temperatures were
available. We excluded 30.4% of temperatures because a studied thermometer site was not listed,
0.3% as implausible (<50°F or >120°F), and 104 as potential double entries. From the remaining
3,670,376, we identified measurements retaken within 15 minutes: 160,130 matched
temperatures (4.3%) from 24,765 patients. For measurements retaken repeatedly within 15
minutes, we included the first 2 temperatures only. Alternatively, one could average

Quickly retaken temperatures

temperatures taken at the same site within 15 minutes,1 but that would make values less noisy for
sites retaken more frequently, biasing Bland-Altman results.
Axillary, central, oral, temporal, and tympanic sites were studied. Each has strengths and
weaknesses in terms of accuracy, safety, and convenience.5 Central temperature was defined as
pulmonary artery, urinary bladder, esophageal, rectal, or core (subtype unspecified). Pulmonary
artery is the only true gold standard,6 but is highly invasive and rarely taken (0.6% of
temperatures), so all central temperatures were used as a reference standard instead. Site was
recorded in 1-4 words of free text. We recoded entries appearing ≥10 times, amounting to
99.98% of entries.
We evaluated agreement between paired temperatures using Bland-Altman analyses. Analyses

(replicates=20,000). Re-running analyses with only 1 measurement pair per patient also
produced similar results.

Results
Patients with quickly retaken temperatures had mostly similar characteristics to the overall
patient population: 44.2% and 45.4% women, mean ages 65 and 64 years, 21.6% and 20.2% with
diabetes, and 14.1% and 11.7% with admission diagnosis of sepsis. Paired temperatures
(n=160,130) were 12.6% axillary, 45.4% central, 29.2% oral, 10.2% temporal, and 2.6%
tympanic.
Every thermometer site had similar, very low agreement with reference temperatures (Figure 1).
No site satisfied the ±0.9°F (±0.5°C) limits of agreement often used to define clinical
acceptability.6 When analyzing temperatures retaken at the same site, every site showed
unprecedentedly low repeatability (Figure 2). Retaken central temperatures were often
anomalously cold (9.9% <95°F and 4.2% <92°F).

Quickly retaken temperatures

Quickly retaken temperatures have very low repeatability and agreement in EHR, to a degree
unprecedented by previous, non-EHR research on thermometer performance.5,6 Haimovich et al.1
observed this for TATs and we observed it for all major non-invasive thermometer types.
Anomalously cold central temperatures were also common in both studies.1
A natural explanation is that clinicians often retook temperatures within minutes because of user
or patient errors during measurement. Common errors include patient movement, inadvertent
thermometer activation, and insufficiently deep rectal or esophageal probes. This last error
produces artificially cold temperatures, but correcting it discomforts patients, so clinicians
sometimes try non-invasive thermometers instead.
The explanation means that quickly retaken EHR measurements do not reflect device accuracy
or precision in correct use. To detect similar problems in other EHR-based studies, researchers
should place themselves in the clinicians’ shoes and carefully consider why actions listed in EHR
were taken.

error during a measurement. Additionally, measurements taken at central sites often reached low values that are generally inconsistent
