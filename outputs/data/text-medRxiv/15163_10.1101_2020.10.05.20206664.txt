Abstract
Background: Pre-existing antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed people is a potentially
important consideration for COVID-19 severity and vaccine responses. However, it has been difficult to
quantify due to a lack of reliable defined background titers in unexposed individuals.
Methods: We measured IgG against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens, SARS-CoV and other circulating
coronavirus spike proteins using a highly sensitive multiplex assay, and total SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific
antibodies (IgG/M/A) using a commercial CLIA assay in 276 adults from the Vancouver area, Canada
between May 17th and June 19th 2020. Reactivity threshold in unexposed individuals were defined
comparing to pre-pandemic sera and to sera from infants under 6 months of age.
Results: The seroprevalence from a SARS-CoV-2 exposure, adjusted for false-positive and false-negative
test results, was 0.60% in our adult cohort. High antibody reactivity to circulating endemic coronaviruses
was observed in all adults and was ∼10-fold lower in infants <6 months. Consistent with a waning of
maternal antibodies, reactivity in infants decreased more than 50-fold ∼8 months later. SARS-CoV-2
Spike, RBD, NTD or nucleocapsid antibody reactivity >100-fold above that of older infants was detected
in the vast majority of unexposed adults and pre-pandemic sera. This antibody reactivity correlated with
titers against circulating coronaviruses, but not with age, sex, or whether adults were healthcare workers.
Conclusion: A majority of unexposed adults have pre-existing antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2.
The lack of similar antibody reactivity in infants where maternal antibodies have waned suggests that this
cross-reactivity is acquired, likely from repeated exposures to circulating coronaviruses.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic on March 11th, 2020 and has
resulted in more than 43.6 million cases and 1.16 million deaths worldwide as of October 27, 2020.
Almost all infected individuals seroconvert within 2-3 weeks, with the spike and nucleocapsid proteins
eliciting the strongest responses (1, 2). While much attention has focused on SARS-CoV-2 responses in
infected and convalescent individuals, the extent of SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity in unexposed
individuals has been difficult to gauge due to insufficient assay sensitivity (3), or overlooked due to the
lack of definable reactivity thresholds to distinguish reactive from unreactive unexposed individuals (4).
Four circulating coronaviruses pre-dating COVID-19 cause up to 30% of upper respiratory tract infections
seasonally (5). The spike protein of circulating beta-coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43 exhibits ∼40%
sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2, whereas the circulating alpha-coronaviruses, NL63 and 229E, are
less structurally similar (6). Since the emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, interest
in studying heterologous responses among human coronaviruses has increased due to their potential to
explain why some individuals with COVID-19 have less severe outcomes (7, 8).
Across the world, estimates for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence range from 0.26-24.4%, with some reports
suggesting higher rates among health care workers (HCW) (9, 10). In the province of British Columbia,
Canada, there has been relatively little spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the first pandemic wave. British
Columbia (BC, 5.017 million population) reported its first COVID-19 case on January 25. The first peak
of the COVID-19 pandemic occurred between the third week of March and late April in BC (11). During
this period, most economic sectors were locked down. With only 2,445 diagnosed COVID-19 cases
(∼49/100,000 population) as of May 17, BC represented an ideal setting to compare the antibody
reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 that can be generated from a direct viral exposure versus the pre-existing
antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 that may be detectable within the same unexposed population.
The main objective of this study was to determine the adult population-level antibody reactivity against
SARS-CoV-2 and its relationship with seroreactivity to circulating coronaviruses. To confirm that SARSCoV-2 antibody reactivity in unexposed adults was genuinely cross-reactive and not due to widespread
unreported asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 circulation, we similarly assayed sera collected prior to the
emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and from infants before and after maternal antibodies have waned.
Results
Study population: In total, 276 adults were recruited. Their demographic characteristics and
geographical area of residence are shown in Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Figure 1.
Majority (n = 196; 71%) of participants were HCW. Less than half had travelled outside of BC in 2020,
including to the USA, Europe, Iran, the Caribbean, Australia, Mexico and Japan. Two participants
reported a history of PCR-confirmed COVID-19.
Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 seroreactivity in adults: Using a highly sensitive multiplex assay, we
quantified antibody titers against the spike proteins of circulating coronaviruses (OC43, HKU1, NL63,
229E), SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as well as against the N protein, RBD and NTD of SARS-CoV-2
from the 276 participants plus five control convalescent sera. Clustering analyses based on SARS-CoV-2
antibody profiles showed three individuals (CW087, CW0150, FH0037) that clustered very distinctly
together with the five control convalescent sera, compared to the rest of the cohort (Figure 1). These three
study participants included the two with a history of COVID-19 and one additional study participant: a

24-year-old asymptomatic non-HCW female who had been in contact with a COVID-19 case about 90
days prior to serology testing for this study.
Of the 276 participants, a subset of 222 that displayed above-the-mean antibody reactivity for any of the
four SARS-CoV-2 antigens were tested with the highly specific CLIA assay (Supplemental Figure 2).
The same 3 participants above, plus the 5 control sera, tested positive on this assay. Thus, we established
that three out of 276 (1.1%) participants showed evidence of a prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. After
adjustment for bias using point estimates of specificity and sensitivity of the CLIA assay, the
seroprevalence from a direct exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was established at 0.60% [95%CI 0% to 2.71%].
The clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2-seroreactive participants are shown in Supplemental
Table 2. Two were HCW, one of whom was a pediatric HCW and the other was a non-pediatric HCW.
Thus, there was no obvious difference in SARS-CoV-2 seroreactivity between HCW and non-HCW, or
between pediatric and non-pediatric HCW (1.0% vs 1.0%; P=1.00 and 0.7% vs 1.6%; P=0.54,
respectively), which may be indicative of similar rates of exposure to the virus in these groups in BC.
Profile of SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity: The pattern of antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2
antigens differed markedly between convalescent sera and individuals who are seroreactive without any
evidence of prior exposure to the virus. Indeed, individuals who had been previously infected with the
virus showed high reactivity to all SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested (Supplemental Figure 3A), whereas
unexposed individuals showed variable antibody reactivity against either Spike or RBD (Supplemental
Figure 3B, C). For circulating coronaviruses, all individuals displayed high antibody reactivity
(Supplemental Figure 4), which was evenly distributed by age, sex, HCW status, travel history and
independent of participants’ prior impression of having experienced “COVID-19-like” symptoms (Figure
2). We detected significant correlations between antibody reactivities to SARS-CoV-2 and the circulating
coronaviruses HKU1, NL63 and X229E (Spearman rho values ranging from 0.130 - 0.224 for 7
significant correlations with circulating coronaviruses out of 36 correlations tested) (FDR 5%; Figure 3).
SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity in unexposed individuals: Next, we aimed to define unequivocally
the SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity thresholds in adults who have not been exposed to the virus. We
reasoned that infants would be immunologically naïve with the exception of maternal antibodies that are
expected to disappear gradually after birth. To this end, we performed the 10-plex assay on sera from 21
infants less than 6 months of age obtained before the pandemic and repeated in the same infants ∼8
months later, after BC’s lockdown period. Reactivity to circulating coronaviruses was almost uniformly
detected in the first set of blood samples and this reactivity became substantially lower in the second
sample sets (Supplemental Figure 5). Thus, these second infant samples allowed us to define a true
threshold for background SARS-CoV-2-antibody reactivity (Figure 4). Most importantly, these data
strikingly revealed that the vast majority of adults displayed some degree of antibody reactivity against
either the S-2P native spike proteins, RBD, NTD or N proteins of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 reactivity
in unexposed adults was up to ∼100-fold greater than infants after maternal antibodies had waned. Prepandemic sera also showed antibody reactivity comparable to unexposed study participants, therefore
excluding that this reactivity was due to asymptomatic/undiagnosed exposures to the virus (Figure 4).
Discussion
The goal of our study was to quantify the antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in the general
population, particularly in uninfected individuals, and examine its relationship with reactivity against
circulating endemic coronaviruses. We assessed three cohorts: adults sampled before the pandemic, a

separate group of adults sampled during the pandemic, and infants sampled both before and during the
pandemic. We estimated a 0.60% [95%CI 0% to 2.71%] seroprevalence from a direct SARS-CoV-2
exposure in the adult population. Reported SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence after the first pandemic wave
varied widely across the world for reasons including the timing of sampling; how countries managed to
control spread of the virus; the target population of the study; and the assay used. Highest rates were
reported in Sweden in May (7.3%) (12), Geneva in April/early May (10.8%) (13), and Madrid in late
April/early May (>10%) (14); lowest rates were reported in BC (11). The findings from the current study
are consistent with data from the BCCDC between May 15 and 27, 2020, reporting 0.55% seroprevalence
among 885 residual sera obtained from an outpatient laboratory network in the Lower Mainland of BC;
their study population represents a wider geographical catchment and did not specifically target HCW
(11). The current study confirms that transmission of COVID-19 in BC after the first wave was low, even
among HCW, contrasting with a high seroprevalence reported among HCW in other studies (10, 15, 16).
Antibody detection combining a commercial CLIA assay and the highly sensitive multiplex assay allowed
us to distinguish antibody profiles between individuals who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 from
those who have not been exposed to the virus. This approach identified that a substantial proportion of
“unexposed” individuals display antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2, but with a pattern quite distinct
from that in convalescent individuals. The origin for this cross-reactivity is unclear. About 25% of
participants in this study reported that they had experienced COVID-19-like symptoms. However,
because the number of reported COVID-19 cases was low, despite an aggressive viral testing approach in
BC (11), it is extremely unlikely that this antibody reactivity results from a direct exposure to SARSCoV-2. Finding similar antibody reactivity in pre-pandemic sera also excludes this possibility.
The pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity in unexposed individuals in the current study is
consistent with T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 detected in about 40% of unexposed individuals
(17, 18). It is also consistent with another smaller study where 12 out of 95 pre-pandemic sera exhibited
cross-reactive IgG antibody reactivity with conserved epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S2 and N) (19).
Previous seroprevalence studies have either used single-antigen assays, focused on SARS-CoV-2, or, in
the latter case, examined cross-reactivity in selected sera (19). To the best of our knowledge, the current
study is the first and largest to define background threshold to quantify the antibody reactivity against
SARS-CoV-2 and circulating coronaviruses in SARS-CoV-2 unexposed adults, at the population level.
Another strength of the study is that it reports antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 and circulating
coronaviruses in the same population, time period and assay, which is important to avoid sampling biases.
The correlations between the antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 and circulating coronaviruses is
consistent with 35-40% sequence similarity between the spike proteins of these two viruses (6).
Correlations between HKU1, N63L and 229E, but not OC43 could suggest that unidentified factors
modulate the extent of the cross-reactivity with different magnitude of cross-reactivity to circulating
coronaviruses. Alternatively, it may simply due to chance, given our relatively small cohort. In contrast, it
is not surprising that the antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is highly correlated given
>75% sequence similarity between these two viruses (20). Importantly, reactivity detected on samples
obtained from adults sampled before the emergence of COVID-19 and from young infants sampled also
before the emergence of COVID-19, and again 8 months later confirms that we are detecting genuine
heterologous reactivity rather than specific reactivity in exposed asymptomatic people. As a corollary it is
possible that the antibody response following a COVID-19 episode is modulated by pre-existing
immunity to circulating coronaviruses bolstered by an encounter with SARS-CoV-2.

This study has limitations. First, due to the lack of follow-up, findings from this study should not be used
to predict whether the antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed individuals may confer any
immune protection or harm. Second, infection with SARS-CoV-2 prior to 7 days may be underestimated
by serology (21). However, this is unlikely to have had a significant effect on our estimates considering
the low number of reported cases in BC. Third, the small sample size limited the power for correlation
analyses and the precision of estimates of the overall prevalence from a direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure.
In conclusion, this study reveals that pre-existing antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens in
sera from unexposed adults and in young infants is common, although it has been largely overlooked in
previous serology studies. These findings warrant urgent studies of the impact such pre-existing
seroreactivity may have on seroconversion following an exposure to SARS-CoV-2, likelihood of
acquiring the infection, COVID-19 severity or vaccine responses.
Methods
Study design: Prospective cross-sectional study after the first pandemic wave in BC.
Participants: Adults over 18 years of age from the greater Vancouver metropolitan area were included if
they did not have active COVID-19, did not require self-isolation as per BC provincial public measures or
had recovered from COVID-19 at least 14 days prior to the study visit and blood collection. Blood was
drawn in gold-top serum separator tube with polymer gel (BD, cat# 367989); after at least 30 minutes of
clotting at room temperature, the blood sample was then centrifuged at 1,400 G to obtain serum aliquots
that were frozen at -80°C within four hours of collection. Infants were recruited from an ongoing study
looking at respiratory syncytial virus antibodies, with enrollment/the first blood sample planned at the
beginning and second blood sample at the end (after March 31st 2020), of the winter viral season in BC.
Residual de-identified sera from routine diagnostic testing performed in adults between January 25th 2018
and November 8th 2019 at the BCCDC Public Health Laboratory represent the pre-pandemic participants.
Recruitment: Greater Vancouver is the main urban centre in BC and third largest metropolitan area in
Canada with a population of 2.5 million. Study participants were invited by an emails sent to clinical
departments of the BC Children’s & Women’s Hospitals (C&W, the largest pediatric referral centre in
BC, located in Vancouver, and where no cases of COVID-19 were admitted during the pandemic first
wave) and its affiliated BC Children’s Research Institute (BCCHR). The study was also advertised to
hospitalists, anesthesiologists and critical care physicians at Surrey Memorial Hospital (located about 50
km from Vancouver). To minimize recruitment bias, all adults who responded to the invitation email and
returned their signed consent form were enrolled sequentially and invited to give a blood sample, without
triaging. Blood samples were collected between May 17 and June 19, 2020. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants. The study procedures were approved by the University of British Columbia
(UBC) Children’s & Women’s Research Ethic Board (H20-01205; H18-01724).
Study size: Since there was little population seroprevalence data available at the time and none in BC or
Canada, no a priori sample size calculation was performed. The recruitment period was therefore defined
by convenience over a three-week period of enrolment, in order to obtain baseline data.
Multiplex antibody assay: A highly sensitive 10-plex assay (Meso Scale Diagnostics, Gaithersburg,
USA) where each antigen is ‘spotted’ into a single well of a 96-well plate (22) was used to measure
antibody profiles against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens: trimeric S-2P native spike protein, receptor-binding
domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD) (23) and nucleocapsid (N) protein; the trimeric SARS-CoV

spike protein; and spike proteins from circulating beta- (HKU1, OC43) and alpha- (229E and NL63)
coronaviruses, plus a negative control (bovine serum albumin, BSA), on all study participants plus 5
selected convalescent sera (A to E), included as positive controls (Supplemental Figure 4). Briefly, after
blocking wells with 5% BSA, sera were added at 4 dilutions (2:25, 1:100, 1:800 and 1:10,000) and
incubated with shaking for two hours. Sulfo-tag-labelled anti-IgG detection antibody were added and the
electrochemiluminescence signal was read using the MSD Sector 600 instrument. Results are dilutioncorrected interpolated values from a standard curve with assigned Arbitrary Units (AU)/mL. Assignment
of AU/mL of serum was performed by Meso Scale Diagnostics and is designed such that values are
comparable to an International Standard Serum (ISS), and that bridging to a WHO International Standard
will be possible in the future.
Commercial chemiluminescent (CLIA) antibody assay: Total antibody (IgA, IgG and IgM) against
recombinant spike (S1) protein was determined using the VITROS 5600 analyser (Ortho-Clinical
Diagnostics, Rochester, NY) according to manufacturer instructions. This is a Health Canada and FDAlicensed qualitative assay with reported performance and in-house validation indicating sensitivities >7
days post onset range between 96% and 100% and specificities from 99% to 100% (24, 25).
Variables: The following information was collected from participants by questionnaire: age, sex, the first
three digits of their postal code, health care workers status (and whether they worked at C&W or SMH),
history of travel outside BC since January 1, 2020, and history of COVID-19 symptoms and testing.
SARS-CoV-2-exposed cases were defined by a positive result on the commercial CLIA assay, validated
for sensitivity by antibody profiling on the multiplex assay (detailed in Results).
Statistical analyses: The seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was calculated by dividing the number of
SARS-CoV-2-exposed cases by the total number of participants, adjusted for bias due to false positive
and false negative tests using the Greenland method (26). Differences in proportions were calculated
using a Fisher exact test, with significance threshold at P<0.05. Hierarchical clustering of antibody levels
(based on the multiplex assay), was performed on log-transformed, z-score normalized serology data,
using the complete linkage agglomeration method and Euclidean distance measures. Spearman
correlations between antibody levels and metavariables were adjusted for multiple testing using the
Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate method (FDR 5%). There were no missing data. Analyses were
conducted in R version 4.0.2, R Studio version 3.6.2 and GraphPad Prism version 8.4.
