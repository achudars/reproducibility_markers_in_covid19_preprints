Abstract
Background. As evidence emerged that loss of taste and/or loss of smell is frequently
triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection,
we investigated whether Google searches volume for these two disease-specific
symptoms could be associated with disease epidemiology in United States (US).
Materials and Methods. We performed an electronic search in Google Trends using the
keywords “taste loss” and “smell loss” within the US. The Google searches volume was
correlated with the number of new weekly cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) in the country.
Results. The weekly Google searches for taste and smell loss exhibited a trend similar to
that of new weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US. A nearly perfect correlation was
found between Google Trends scores of taste and smell loss (r=0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99;
p<0.001). Although a significant association was found between Google searches for
the two symptoms and the concomitant number of new weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections
reported during the same week, the correlation improved over time. The highest
correlation was found comparing Google Trends scores for taste or smell loss and the
number of new weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections two weeks later. The correlation
coefficient of summing Google Trends scores for the two symptoms and the number of
new weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections two weeks later was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.68-0.90;
p<0.001), and was associated 0.89 diagnostic accuracy.
Conclusions. These findings suggest that Google searches numbers for olfactory and
gustatory dysfunctions may help predicting the epidemiological trajectory of COVID-19
early before official reporting.

Introduction
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak can now be regarded
as one of the largest calamities to impact humanity in modern times [1]. Responsible
for over 1.3 million deaths to date and following an epidemic trend that is predicted to
become even worse in the near future, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already disrupted health care organizations,
economies and

societies worldwide [2]. With natural herd immunity universally

considered unfeasible or virtually unreachable without a concomitant collapse of health
care systems and an immense number of further casualties [3], most of our hopes rely
on the development of efficient vaccines. Nonetheless, this strategy will expectedly
encounter unprecedented challenges due to the need to generate and dispense an
efficient and durable immunization to billions of people worldwide [4]. It is predictable
that we will need to learn to live with this novel coronavirus for quite a while, adapting
our lifestyle and attempting to predict, or at least rapidly identify, manage, and contain
new outbreaks or local resurgence [5].
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the most
frequent symptoms reported by patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are fever, cough,
shortness of breath, myalgia, and headache [6]. Nonetheless, evidence has accumulated
showing that two atypical symptoms, the loss of taste and/or loss of smell, may be
frequently triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection [7]. This is supported by some recent
meta-analyses, such as those published by Hajikhani et al. [8], as well as by Tong and
colleagues [9], who reported that olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are present in
over 50% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the recent meta-analysis of
Hoang et al. also revealed that olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunctions might also be
highly specific symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, since they were found to be 10fold more likely to occur in COVID-19 patients as opposed to those with other acute

respiratory infections (odds ratio, 11.3; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 5.4-23.4)
[10]. This would hence suggest that the onset of taste (hypogeusia or ageusia) or smell
(i.e., hyposmia or anosmia) dysfunctions should raise high clinical suspicion for the
potential of active SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus accelerating diagnosis, isolation and
treatment (when necessary) of such patients. Another critical aspect directly related to
the appearance of these symptoms is that they may present a unique opportunity for
monitoring disease epidemiology that can help predict, anticipate or identify SARSCoV-2 outbreaks or resurgence within the community, even before specific diagnostic
testing is initiated. This would be extremely important in low resource settings, where
widespread molecular testing is impossible or unfeasible, as well as in the northern
hemisphere, as it heads into the winter months, concomitant with peak cold and flu
season.

Materials and Methods
We performed an electronic search in Google Trends (Google Inc. Mountain View,
CA, US), using the keywords “taste loss” AND “smell loss,” limited with country
option set to “United States.” These search terms were selected as they represent highly
paradigmatic symptoms reported at disease onset in patients with SARS-CoV-2
infection [7]. The search period ranged between the third week of January 2020 and
present time (i.e., between January 20, 2020 and November 1, 2020). The weekly
Google Trends score, reflecting the mean volume of Google searches for a specific term
in the preceding seven days, was downloaded and imported into a Microsoft Excel file
(Microsoft, Redmond, WA, United States). The number of new weekly cases of
COVID-19 in the US was retrieved from the official website of the CDC [11], and
tabulated into the same Excel worksheet. The Google search volume for the two
keywords and the new weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US were analyzed with

Spearman’s correlation, whilst the diagnostic performance was assessed by receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) curves. The statistical analysis was carried out using
Analyse-it (Analyse-it Software Ltd, Leeds, UK). The study was conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, under the terms of relevant local
legislation.

Results
A nearly perfect correlation was found between the Google Trends scores of taste
loss and smell loss (r=0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99; p<0.001) (Figure 1). The trends of
weekly Google searches for taste and smell loss and the number of new weekly SARSCoV-2 infections cases in the US are shown in Figure 2. The three curves exhibited a
relatively similar shape. However, changes in Google search trends for taste and smell
loss appeared to occur slightly earlier in comparison to changes in the number of
weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections. The Spearman’s correlations between Google Trends
score for taste or smell loss and the number of new weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections in
the US reported during the same period of the Google searches (same week, i.e. index
week), as well as the correlations between Google Trend scores in the index week
versus the number of cases reported in the subsequent 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after are
shown in Table 1. Although a significant association was found between the volume of
Google searches for the two keywords and the number of concomitant new weekly
SARS-CoV-2 infections diagnosed during the same week, the correlation gradually
improved over time. Google Trends scores for taste loss or smell loss from the index
week were correlated with the number of new weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections in the
following four weeks. The highest correlation was found comparing Google Trends
scores for taste loss or smell loss at the index week and the number of new weekly
SARS-CoV-2 infections reported in the US two weeks later (Table 1). An even stronger

correlation was found when the sum of the Google Trends scores for taste loss or smell
loss at the index week was compared with newly diagnosed weekly SARS-CoV-2
infections two weeks afterwards (r=0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-0.90; p<0.001) (Figure 3). A
positive variation (i.e., an increase from the previous week) in the number of Google
searches for taste or smell loss was characterized by an area under the curve (AUC) of
0.89 (95% CI, 0.79-0.99; 0.83 sensitivity and 0.70 specificity) for predicting an
increasing trend of new SARS-CoV-2 weekly infections two weeks after the date of
Google searches.

Discussion
Evidence has demonstrated that when frequent and specific symptoms characterize a
particular pathology, including infectious diseases, real-time analysis of web searches
may help anticipate or identify the epidemiological trajectory of that disease within a
specific geographic settings [12]. With respect to respiratory diseases, it has been earlier
shown that the volume of Google searches for influenza may reliably mirror the realtime evolution of disease at many temporal and spatial resolutions [13,14]. Similar
evidence has been reported for other common respiratory infections, such as those
caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus [15] and even for the previous coronavirus
disease Middle East Acute Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [16]. This new branch of
epidemiology, which has been informally called “infodemiology,” is defined as a
science based on using electronic Web-based information to inform and guide public
health policies [17] and is increasingly used to support conventional epidemiology in
preventing, containing and managing COVID-19 around the world [18,19].
Interestingly, Jimenez et al. recently showed that Google Trends search data for a
combination of symptoms such as fatigue, diarrhea, sore throat, fever, pneumonia, lost
sense of smell, and cough could efficiently predict the evolution of the COVID-19

outbreak in Spain with 11 days of anticipation [20]. Similar reports have been published
in other countries, though most of these have included a vast array of symptoms, such as
fever, cough, and dyspnea, which are not specific for COVID-19 [21,22]. However, as
winter arrives in northern hemisphere bringing with it cold and flu season, these nonspecific symptoms may be of limited utility as search terms for epidemiologic
monitoring. Conversely, the onset of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, especially in
combination, is rare in patients with other upper respiratory viral infections [23]. The
presence of these symptoms presents a high likelihood of being linked to an ongoing or
recent SARS-CoV-2 infection [24], which likely encourages patients to undergo
molecular testing and initiate social distancing and isolation [25]. Multiple potential
cellular and molecular causes for these two paradigmatic chemosensory alterations have
been proposed, such as nasal obstruction/congestion and rhinorrhea, damage of
olfactory receptor neurons, infiltration of olfactory centers in the central nervous
system, and injury of cells supporting the olfactory/taste epithelium [26]. Irrespective of
the specific cause, substantial evidence has been provided that self-reported taste and/or
smell dysfunctions is associated with community spread of the infection, as well as
number of hospital admissions, and are capable of predicting disease epidemiology
better than using conventional indicators [27].
The results of our analysis suggest that the volume of Google searches for
olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions may help predict the epidemiological trajectory of
COVID-19 prior to changes in official reporting. A similar analysis was published by
Cherry et al. [28], who reported modest Spearman’s correlations (i.e., between 0.30 and
0.65) between COVID-19 cases and loss of smell or taste. However, these authors
limited their search up to May 17, 2020, and only used a seven-day moving-mean.
Unlike those findings, we have extended our search up to November 2020, thus also
capturing the beginning of the so-called “second wave” of the infection [29]. We have

also analyzed the correlations up to four weeks after the index week of Google searches.
This has allowed us to define that the volume of Google searches for loss of taste and/or
smell in the US efficiently predicted the number of SARS-COV-2 diagnosed cases in
the subsequent two weeks.
In conclusion, health organizations and governments should strongly consider
using the number of Google searches as an adjunct tool for planning future strategies to
prevent, contain, and manage outbreaks of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
