ABSTRACT:
As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread around the world, there is an urgent need for new assay formats to
characterize the humoral response to infection. Convalescent serum is being used for treatment and for isolation
of patient-derived antibodies. However, currently there is not a simple means to estimate serum bulk
neutralizing capability. Here we present an efficient competitive serological assay that can simultaneously
determine an individual’s seropositivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and estimate the neutralizing
capacity of anti-Spike antibodies to block interaction with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
required for viral entry. In this ELISA-based assay, we present natively-folded viral Spike protein receptor
binding domain (RBD)-containing antigens via avidin-biotin interactions. Sera are then supplemented with
soluble ACE2-Fc to compete for RBD-binding serum antibodies, and antibody binding quantified. Comparison
of signal from untreated serum and ACE2-Fc-treated serum reveals the presence of antibodies that compete
with ACE2 for RBD binding, as evidenced by loss of signal with ACE2-Fc treatment. In our test cohort of nine
convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients, we found all patients had developed anti-RBD antibodies targeting the
epitope responsible for ACE2 engagement. This assay provides a simple and high-throughput method to screen
patient sera for potentially neutralizing anti-Spike antibodies to enable identification of candidate sera for
therapeutic use.

INTRODUCTION:
The emergence of the pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in humans, and the respiratory disease
associated with infection, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has placed a significant public health burden
on countries around the world. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the pathogenic SARS-CoV-1 that emerged in
the early 2000s.1 Both viruses infect bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes, and enter human cells
via the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).2,3 Viral entry is dependent on a binding
interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike protein and ACE2 on the cell
surface.4,5 Given the crucial role of RBD binding to ACE2 in viral entry, disrupting this interaction has emerged
as a promising target for first-generation biologics to provide passive immunity, either with anti-Spike
antibodies6 or ACE2 constructs7–9. As more patients recover from SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is a great need
for serology assays to examine the humoral response to infection and vaccination, as well as to determine how
patient-derived antibodies interact with the Spike protein.
Although direct detection of viral proteins or polymerase chain reaction testing is key to diagnosing the
early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, serological assays detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are vital tools
for monitoring how a patient’s anti-viral response evolves after the period of acute infection ends.10 Serological
assays can take many forms, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)11, viral neutralization
assays, and rapid lateral flow assays.10 Neutralization assays with serum necessitate culture of either live or
pseudovirus, and the market has been flooded with rapid lateral flow diagnostic tests that provide heterogeneous
results12 and are difficult to quantify.
ELISA-based tests are not as rapid, but they provide quantitative results and are easily adapted to test a
variety of conditions and experimental designs. Such variations in design can provide greater detail regarding
the profile of a patient’s antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 and how these antibodies interact with viral
antigens. One clear application of a modified ELISA-type serology assay is to rapidly screen for the presence of
patient antibodies that compete with ACE2 for RBD binding, and therefore may disrupt RBD binding to ACE2.
Improved understanding of the prevalence of these antibodies in patient sera will inform both therapeutic and
vaccine design efforts and allow for correlations between clinical outcome and the presence of potentially
neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, recent therapeutic use of convalescent sera shows that while safe, the
efficacy of this treatment still remains unclear.13,14 A serological assay capable of simultaneously screening
convalescent sera for potentially neutralizing antibodies would offer clinicians a facile way to screen for hightiter neutralizing convalescent sera that may be effective in treating acutely ill individuals and for speeding
population-based studies to understand what proportion of the exposed population might have a degree of
protective immunity.
Herein, we report the development of a simple competitive serological assay using biotinylated Spike
protein antigens and a dimeric ACE2-Fc fusion construct. Use of the avidin-biotin interaction to coat plates with
biotinylated antigen versus simple adsorption permits the presentation of natively-folded protein for serum

antibody capture. Our assay is analogous to the widely-used RBD ELISA assay first reported by Amanat et al.15
and later expanded by Stadlbauer et al.11 However, we show here that the addition of ACE2-Fc competitor to
the sera allows us to also examine potentially neutralizing antibodies that block ACE2-RBD interactions. The
competition reactions are performed on the same plate, using the same detection protocol to enable rapid,
reproducible characterization of a patient’s anti-Spike antibody profile and whether the patient has generated
antibodies that compete with ACE2 for RBD binding. Importantly, when used in conjunction with anti-Spike
antibodies with known binding epitopes, this assay format can be further adapted to reveal Spike epitopes
targeted by patient antibodies at higher resolution, providing important insights for the development of biologic
therapies and vaccines.
RESULTS:
Biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigen constructs offer multiple formats to detect anti-Spike
antibodies in convalescent patient sera.
Recently, we reported the high-yield expression of a number of biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein
antigen and ACE2 formats that have broad utility for SARS-CoV-2 research.16 Given the importance of
serological testing to identify not only patients that have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also the
need to characterize the properties of anti-Spike antibodies generated by these patients, we developed a
serological assay using these biotinylated constructs (Table 1, Figure 1A, Supplemental Figure 1). Briefly,
plates are first coated with NeutrAvidin followed by incubation with biotinylated antigen similar to our
previously reported assays to characterize Fab-phage binding as part of our phage display recombinant antibody
generation pipeline17. Plates are then blocked using 3% nonfat milk and incubated with serum diluted in 1%
nonfat milk (Figure 1A). The use of a standard anti-IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a detection reagent is
precluded by our incorporation of a human Fc region into some of our Spike antigen constructs for dimeric
presentation of the RBD. Thus, our pilot studies first focused on testing multiple alternative detection reagents.
In all studies presented here, convalescent patients had prior RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and
sera were collected 14 or more days following resolution of COVID-19 symptoms. Healthy control serum was
collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. We found that anti-Fab-HRP, anti-IgM-HRP, and Protein LHRP all offered robust detection of anti-Spike antibodies in patient sera (Supplemental Figure 2). Protein LHRP was predominantly used in this study as it will detect any antibody subtype containing a kappa-light chain
(e.g. IgG, IgM, IgA). We observed slight reactivity of Protein L-HRP to Fc-containing antigens in buffer-treated
wells (Supplemental Figure 2C), so in subsequent assays the background signal in buffer-treated wells was
subtracted from the sample signal. Further pilot studies to optimize our workflow revealed that heat inactivation
of patient serum (56°C, 60 minutes) did not significantly reduce signal (P=0.4877, Supplemental Figure 3),
consistent with previous reports15. Additionally, these early experiments showed that coating with as low as 20
nM RBD-biotin still provided robust detection of anti-RBD patient antibodies (Supplemental Figure 4). In

summary, we converged on an optimal assay condition utilizing a 20 nM antigen coating concentration, 50-fold
diluted, heat-inactivated sera, and Protein-L-HRP as a detection reagent.
To profile the efficacy of our various antigens to directly detect anti-Spike antibodies in patient sera, we
performed a head-to-head comparison of all antigen constructs listed in Table 1. All biotinylated constructs
were immobilized on NeutrAvidin-coated plates and effectively captured anti-Spike antibodies from three
patient sera, whereas sera from two healthy controls were not reactive (Figure 1B-E). We observed a dosedependent decrease in signal with increasing serum dilution for all antigens. All three patients tested exhibited
strong reactivity to both RBD-biotin and biotinylated full-length (FL) Spike protein. Of note, the use of a
human (RBD-hFc) or mouse Fc-fusion (RBD-mFc) did not affect signal strength (Figure 1D-E). There also did
not seem to be a clear benefit of monomeric (RBD-biotin, Figure 1B) versus dimeric (RBD-hFc, RBD-mFc,
Figure 1D-E) presentation of the RBD, aside from slightly higher signal at a 1:250 serum dilution.
Interestingly, passive adsorption of RBD-biotin to the plate instead of utilizing the interaction with
NeutrAvidin resulted in loss of signal (Figure 1F). Conversely, adsorption of FL Spike-biotin did not affect
signal (Figure 1G). To further probe this observation, we tested adsorption of both 20 and 100 nM RBD-biotin
and found that adsorption with a low concentration of RBD-biotin (20 nM) and detection with Protein L-HRP
were not compatible, underscoring the importance of presenting antigens via NeutrAvidin in our experimental
design (Supplemental Figure 5). However, adsorption at a higher RBD-biotin concentration (100 nM) yielded
signal with Protein L-HRP. Furthermore, detection with anti-human IgG in a format analogous to previously
reported assays11,15 yielded robust signal when 100 nM RBD-biotin was adsorbed (Supplemental Figure 5D),
indicating RBD-biotin can also be used in an adsorption format.
Not surprisingly, we observed higher signal at all serum dilutions with FL Spike-biotin (413 kDa) than
RBD-biotin (28.5 kDa). However, the signal increase was less than two-fold, while the size difference between
these proteins by molecular weight is >14-fold. This observation suggests that a large proportion of anti-Spike
antibodies that patients develop specifically target the RBD domain.
ACE2-Fc competes with antibodies in a majority of patient sera tested.
We next adapted our assay to incorporate an ACE2 competition condition where patient antibodies
compete in the presence of ACE2 for binding to Spike antigen on the ELISA plate (Figure 2A). We first tested
the monomeric ACE2 and observed a modest, but consistent reduction in bound antibody signal across the four
patient samples tested (Supplemental Figure 6). We have previously shown dimeric ACE2-Fc binds ~4-fold
tighter to the monomeric Spike antigen.16 Therefore, we postulated the improved affinity and potential avidity
afforded with this dimeric construct may allow greater competition with patient antibodies. Indeed, we observed
a much greater decrease in RBD-binding of patient antibodies when serum was supplemented with 100 nM
ACE2-Fc (Figure 2B), a concentration of ACE2-Fc we found to saturate RBD on the plate (Supplemental
Figure 7). Pre-treating the antigen-coated plate with ACE2-Fc prior to adding serum produced slightly higher

signal compared to when ACE2-Fc was added to serum. This suggests that pre-treatment with ACE2-Fc allows
for some dissociation of ACE2-Fc during serum incubation, and consequently increased patient antibody
binding (Supplemental Figure 8). Therefore, we chose to supplement sera with ACE2-Fc to allow simultaneous
competition with the patient antibodies to bind immobilized Spike antigen.
To determine the patient-to-patient variability in our ACE2-Fc competition serology assay, and to test
our various antigen formats in this competition mode, we expanded our efforts to test a cohort of eight
convalescent patient sera and a healthy control using the antigens presented in Table 1. We observed a ten-fold
variation in the overall anti-Spike signal between patients, and trends were consistent between antigens (Figure
2C-F). When specifically examining the RBD-alone containing antigens (RBD-biotin, RBD-hFc, RBD-mFc,
Figure 2C, E-F), all patients exhibited a variable, but substantial degree of signal decrease when ACE2-Fc was
added to the serum (50-95%, Figure 2G). This finding suggests that the patients in this small cohort have all
generated anti-RBD antibodies that bind at the RBD epitope responsible for binding ACE2, and are therefore
potentially neutralizing.
Interestingly, when FL Spike-biotin was used as the antigen (Figure 2D), the signal for both direct
detection and ACE2-Fc competition were largely elevated relative to the RBD-alone containing antigens. The
average percent decrease in signal with ACE2-Fc competition was also lower than with the RBD-alone
containing antigens (Figure 2G). These observations likely represent anti-Spike antibodies that bind outside of
the RBD that are unaffected by ACE2-Fc competition. Taken together, these results demonstrate the utility of
our ACE2-Fc competition assay for the simultaneous determination of both baseline serum reactivity to Spike
antigens as well as whether a serum sample contains antibodies that compete for the ACE2-binding epitope on
the RBD.
DISCUSSION:
As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic escalates, there is a continued need for assays to profile patient
responses to infection, especially with respect to the anti-viral antibodies generated, and whether or not a patient
has acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we designed and employed an assay to identify potentially
neutralizing antibodies in convalescent patient sera that bind at the ACE2/Spike RBD interface. Using a variety
of biotinylated Spike antigens and presentation of natively-folded protein via avidin-biotin interactions, we
developed another ELISA format for directly measuring patient seropositivity to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein. Competition with ACE2-Fc clearly revealed the presence of potential neutralizing antibodies that bind
the RBD in all patients tested. This new assay represents a high-throughput and simple means of providing
additional resolution of the patient antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and further justifies efforts to
design therapies and vaccines that block binding of the Spike RBD to ACE2.
Our cohort of convalescent patients was small, but several interesting trends can be observed in our
results. There was remarkable consistency in detection using our various antigens. We were surprised to find

that presentation of monomeric RBD-biotin versus dimeric RBD found in RBD-hFc and RBD-mFc showed
little difference in signal strength. This may be a result of using tetrameric NeutrAvidin to present RBD-biotin,
which would mimic an avidity effect. Another interesting trend is the varying degree of anti-Spike antibody
seropositivity between patients. This variation is consistent with previous observations of heterogeneous
responses of patient sera in anti-Spike serology assays.15,18–21 We also saw anti-Spike seroconversion in all of
our patient samples, and reactivity to FL Spike-biotin was higher than that to antigens only containing the RBD,
consistent with earlier observations.15 Taken together, these data demonstrate that our biotinylated antigen
constructs can be effectively presented using immobilized avidin, and offer another option for serologic
screening of individuals for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity.
An important advance presented here is the implementation of a straightforward means to assess the
global capacity of a patient’s serum antibodies to compete with ACE2 for RBD binding. By simply adding
ACE2-Fc to the serum dilution buffer, we can modify our direct-detection ELISA to reveal the presence of
antibodies that bind at a potentially neutralizing RBD epitope in the ACE2/RBD interface. We found that all of
the patients in our cohort had antibodies that bound RBD at or near this interface, as indicated by reductions in
signal strength in the competition mode of our ELISA. These findings indicate that not only is this ACE2binding surface of the RBD highly immunogenic, but also suggests that recovered COVID-19 patients develop
antibodies against this potentially neutralizing epitope. In the context of previous findings that SARS-CoV-1
neutralizing antibodies bind the Spike RBD and block ACE2 binding22,23, our data suggest that this premise is
also true for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, our results indicate that in most of the patients tested here, a majority
of the anti-RBD antibodies bind at the ACE2 binding site on the RBD.
To our knowledge, only one other SARS-CoV-2 study has examined the ability of serum antibodies to
compete with ACE2 for RBD binding.18 Interestingly, in contrast to our findings, only 3 out of 26 patient tested
positive for ACE2-competitive antibodies. These divergent results are possibly a consequence of differing assay
designs and competitor concentrations, or differing selection criteria of patient cohorts. We found in our
experiments that ACE2 monomer could not efficiently compete with patient antibodies for binding, which
underscores the importance of using a strong, bivalent binder to block the Spike-patient antibody interaction in
such a competitive serology assay. We next plan to apply our competition ELISA in an expanded patient cohort
with concurrent viral neutralization assays to further understand the prevalence of ACE2-competitive antibodies
in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patient sera and correlate these findings with clinical outcomes. These studies
will build on our intriguing early results and help improve our understanding of the role binding epitope plays in
SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.
Although our use of Protein L to detect patient antibodies allows us to simultaneously detect IgG, IgM,
and IgA, it does not detect lambda light chain-containing antibodies. Testing of additional detection reagents
and designs of avid ACE2 constructs that lack an Fc may identify alternatives that will allow simultaneous
capture of antibody subtypes with either light chain. Another consideration is that the strength of ACE2

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.27.20114652; this version posted May 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

competition may not correlate with neutralization efficiency, and that our assay does not reveal if patients have
sufficient titers of these competitive antibodies to provide effective neutralization. This underscores the need for
additional experiments to perform the competition assay and serum neutralization experiments in parallel.
Lastly, it is possible that an antibody could bind outside of the ACE2 binding epitope on the RBD but still
prevent ACE2 binding via allosteric effects. Given the relatively small size of the RBD, this may be more
relevant for the FL Spike protein, but if such an antibody is identified, testing it under our competition
conditions would reveal if this binding would be detected in our assay design.
In conclusion, we developed a simple ELISA-based ACE2 competition serology assay to identify
individuals with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the ACE2-binding epitope on the Spike RBD. Addition
of ACE2-Fc to serum is straightforward, does not significantly lengthen the ELISA protocol, and could
potentially be an added step into other assay formats, such as lateral flow. This high-throughput assay could be
used to pre-screen convalescent serum for bulk quality of potentially neutralizing antibodies and also to better
inform recovered COVID-19 patients and their physicians whether their SARS-CoV-2 exposure has resulted in
protective immunity or not. This design also has the potential to screen engineered Spike-binding proteins with
potential therapeutic utility to determine if these constructs bind similar epitopes to antibodies generated in
convalescent patients. Future studies will focus on increasing the number of patients screened as well as
correlating results of the competition assay with clinical outcomes and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization
experiments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Antigen Generation
All antigens and ACE2 constructs were produced as previously described.16 RBD-mFc was generated by
subcloning the RBD DNA sequence into a vector containing a C-terminal mIgG2a-Fc with an Avi tag. The
sequence maps for all plasmids are available upon request. Briefly, proteins were expressed in Expi293 cells coexpressing BirA using the Expifectamine Expression System Kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s
recommended protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Biotinylated proteins were then purified using either NiNTA (RBD-biotin, FL Spike) or Protein A chromatography (RBD-hFc, RBD-mFc) and buffer exchanged into
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for storage at -80°C. Protein purity was assessed using SDS-PAGE and size
exclusion chromatography. Biotinylation was confirmed by NeutrAvidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) shift assay.
Patient Samples
All serum samples were obtained via antecubital venipuncture and collected into BD Vacutainer serum
collection tubes in using protocols approved by the UCSF Institutional Review Board and in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients had a positive clinical nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test to document
SARS-CoV-2 infection. At the time of their blood draw, more than 14 days had elapsed since their COVID-19

respiratory and constitutional symptoms had resolved. De-identified serum was aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at -80°C in single-use aliquots. Control samples were from healthy individuals obtained
before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Heat-inactivation of sera was performed by incubating the samples at
56°C for 60 minutes.
Competition ELISA Protocol
All assays were performed in 384-well Nunc Maxisorp flat-bottom plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
and each sample was run in duplicate. First, plates were coated with 50 µL of 0.5 µg/mL NeutrAvidin or 20 µL
of 20 nM antigen (for passively-adsorbed antigens) in PBS for 60 minutes at room temperature. For assays
using 100 nM biotinylated antigen, 10 µg/mL NeutrAvidin was used. Plates were then washed 3X with PBS
containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and were washed similarly between each of the following steps. Next, 20
µL of biotinylated antigens were added to NeutrAvidin-coated wells and allowed to bind for 30 minutes at room
temperature. After washing, plates were then blocked for 60 minutes with 100 µL 3% nonfat milk (Lab
Scientific) in PBST. Sera were diluted as indicated in 1% nonfat milk in PBST in the absence (direct detection)
or presence (competition) of 100 nM ACE2-Fc and 20 µL of these dilutions were incubated in the plates for 60
minutes at room temperature. Plates were again washed, and antibodies bound to the coated antigens detected
using 20 µL of anti-human Fab (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories 109-036-097, [1:5000]), anti-human
IgM (Sigma-Aldrich A6907, [1:3000]), anti-human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich A0170, [1:3000]), or Protein L
(Thermo Fisher Scientific 32420, [1:5000]) as indicated for 30 minutes at room temperature. All detection
reagents were conjugated to HRP. Following a final wash, plates were developed for 10 minutes at room
temperature using 20 µL of 50/50 TMB/solution B (VWR International). Reactions were quenched with 20 µL
1 M phosphoric acid and absorbance measured at 450 nm using a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro spectrophotometer.
Data Analysis and Statistics
Background from the raw ELISA signal was removed by first subtracting the signal measured in
NeutrAvidin-alone coated wells or empty wells (passively adsorbed antigens). Next, the signal measured in
antigen-coated wells incubated with 1% nonfat milk (direct detection) or 1% nonfat milk + 100 nM ACE2-Fc
(competition) was subtracted from the signal in serum-treated wells. As there is some detectable reactivity of
Protein L-HRP to Fc-containing antigens (RBD-hFc, RBD-mFc) and RBD-bound ACE2-Fc (competition
mode), this buffer subtraction step is necessary. All graphing and statistical analysis was performed in
GraphPad Prism (Version 8.4.2).
