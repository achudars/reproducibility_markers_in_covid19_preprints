Abstract

Background.

The unprecedented impact of the Covid-19 pandemics on modern society has ignited

a "gold rush" for effective treatment and diagnostic strategies, with a significant diversion of

economical, scientific and human resources towards dedicated clinical research. We aimed to

describe trends in this rapidly changing landscape to inform adequate resource allocation.

Methods

. We developed informatic tools (Covid Trial Monitor) to analyze in real time growth rate,

geographical distribution and characteristics of Covid-19 related trials. We defined structured

semantic ontologies with controlled vocabularies to categorize trial interventions, study endpoints

and study designs. Data and analyses are publicly available at

https://bioinfo.ieo.it/shiny/app/CovidCT

Results

. We observe a clear prevalence of

monocentric trials with highly heterogeneous endpoints

and a significant disconnect between geographic distribution and disease prevalence, implying
that most countries would need to recruit unrealistic percentages of their total prevalent cases to

fulfill enrolment.

Conclusions

. This geographically and methodologically incoherent growth sheds doubts on the

actual feasibility of locally reaching target sample sizes and the probability of most of these trials

providing reliable and transferable result. We call for the harmonization of clinical trial design

criteria for Covid19 and the increased use of larger master protocols incorporating elements of

adaptive designs. Covid Trial Monitor identifies critical issues in current Covid19-related clinical

research and represents a useful resource for researchers and policymakers to improve the quality

and efficiency of related trials

Introduction
Standard and effective approaches for Covid19 prevention and treatment are not available to

date, despite the magnitude of the pandemics and the similarities with past Coronavirus-

associated diseases SARS and MERS[1]. So far initial trials with antivirals or other potentially

effective drugs such as chloroquine have not yet clearly demonstrated superior efficacy over

alternative treatments [2–4] and the disease remains associated with devastating morbidity and

mortality. A wide variety of intervention strategies have been proposed, aiming for different

mechanisms (viral or host processes), disease stage (early, advanced or prevention), intervention

modality (medical or nonmedical).

As Covid-19-devoted resources grow, quantifying the potential impact of Covid19 trials becomes a

relevant matter for global and national health policies. However, quality research on clinical trials

is rendered difficult by the lack of standardized definition of trial parameters.

Data reporting in

trial repositories is notoriously plagued by internal inconsistencies, especially for “free text” fields

that contain key information like inclusion criteria or study endpoints [5]. General medical

ontologies like MeSH terms provide an all-encompassing framework but may be inadequate to

capture relevant distinctions for specific fields; Covid-related terms were only introduced in late

march, and their use is only recommended and not mandatory for trial definition.

In the present work we defined structured semantic ontologies with controlled vocabularies to

categorize trial interventions, study endpoints and study designs, and we conducted an analysis of

growth rate, geographical distribution and trial characteristics of Covid19-related trials,

highlighting a number of relevant features which may impair the possibility of obtaining reliable

and transferable results within the current framework. We formulate proposals for more rational

trial designs against this rapidly changing landscape

Results
Global growth rate
We identified 1756 relevant studies (including interventional, observational and other) combining
entries from the WHO and clinicaltrials.gov databases (figure 1A).
From 23 jan 2020 (date of first study posted), the cumulative increase of number of studies and

the projected enrolled patients have been growing logistically (figure 1B).

We analysed the funding source on the 519 interventional trials from clinicaltrials.gov for which
this information was available (table 1) and found a high percentage (397, 76.49%) are funded by
public agencies, 62 (11.95%) by industries and 52 (10.02%) by collaboration among public and
private. Comparison with a disease of comparable magnitude like influenza or cancer shows how
this ratio of industry vs non-industry is highly unusual (influenza 15/47, 31.91%, p=7.75x10-5,
cancer 735/3167, 23.21%, p<2.2x10-16).
For subsequent analyses, we focused on interventional trials (n= 1078), although data have been
collected for all trials and are available in supplementary table 1 and at
https://bioinfo.ieo.it/shiny/app/CovidCT

.

Geographical distribution
Trials were opened in 63 different countries. At the national level, United States was the nation with
the highest number of trial locations, followed by China (figure 2A, C, D).
We calculated a simple “trial per patient” index (TPP) by dividing the number of available trials by
the number of cumulative cases. Trials per patient (TPP) were unevenly distributed among and
within nations

(figure 2B, E, F), with a Gini coefficient equal to 0.76. Of the 392 trials with

available location information, the vast majority were monocentric (261, 66.58%), while 131 were
multicentric. Of those, just 32 were opened in more than 10 locations (figure 2G).

The correlation between the cumulative projected patient enrolment and the actual case

prevalence in each state was poor (Pearson=0.37). With current case prevalence, most countries

would need to recruit extremely high and possibly unrealistic percentages of their total prevalent

cases to fulfill enrolment (figure 2H).

Characteristics of interventional trials and types of intervention
Early phase studies (phase 1 and 1-2) were under-represented in both numbers and patients (figure
3A-B). To better describe and capture the semantic heterogeneity of trial characteristics, we defined
ontologies with controlled vocabularies for interventions, study designs (supplementary table 2),
inclusion criteria (supplementary table 3) and study endpoints (supplementary table 4).
Among trials aimed at active treatment, a significant share (86/1078) do not require PCR-confirmed
diagnosis as inclusion criteria (“suspected”, figure 3C). Primary endpoints are qualitatively (clinical
or virological, radiological or other laboratory variables) and quantitatively (411 proportion, 156
time-to-event, 261 quantity) heterogeneous; “hard” endpoints containing mortality either use the
incommensurable quantitative WHO ordinal scale or proportional measures (figure 3D).
We categorized all interventional treatments under 15 terms. Randomization is common but not
prevalent among most interventions (figure 3E); Chloroquine, immune-modulating agents
(expanded in figure 3F) and antivirals (expanded in fig 3G) are the most investigated with 220, 175,
and 165 studies respectively.

Discussion
We present quantitative, updated and semantically organized measures of Covid19-related trials.

We highlight a number of peculiar characteristics of this clinical research landscape: extremely

rapid growth, substantial geographical and methodological incoherence, unprecedented funding

pattern, prevalence of monocentric trials, extreme heterogeneity in the interventions tested. The

main limitation of our analysis is represented by the heterogeneity in quality and quantity of

available information. The source databases use often non-overlapping trial categorization

methods and many of the records have missing, mis-spelled or imprecise wording, potentially

causing relevant selection biases which we attempted to mitigate by forcing information through

controlled vocabularies, a procedure which may results in loss of information.

We argue that several of the planned trials are unlikely to provide high-quality results for the

following reasons.

First and foremost, the unrealistic percentages of total prevalent cases needed to fulfill planned

enrollment at the national level implies that several trials are unlikely to reach target sample sizes,

with severe loss of statistical power or study termination. This has in fact already been observed

with the recently published Remdesivir trial in China, which failed to complete enrolment and led

to conflicting interpretations[6].

Geographical fragmentation will magnify local and study-specific confounding in demographics,

comorbidities and the availability of healthcare resources, which are known to heavily impact on

Covid-19 outcome [7–9]. Variegated endpoints and inclusion criteria will inhibit the possibility to

adequately compare and meta-analyse treatments across trials. Proper dose-finding trials are

scarce, with the risk of under- or over-treating patients and of underestimating potentially risky

drug-interactions. Finally, the

scientific soundness of classical randomized designs in a scenario

where the control arm may be rapidly changing[10] is ethically and methodologically questionable
Our analysis provides quantitative grounds for concerns raised in the early days of the Covid19

pandemics in commentaries [11–13] that highlighted the difficulties in striking a balance between

the need to conduct sound clinical research and the need to rapidly take action.

This observed

disordered growth in clinical research is perhaps expected given the unprecedented medical and
socio-economical impact of the Covid-19 pandemics. However, we note that the scientific
community should prepare the grounds for a more ordered development, especially in light of the

expected persistence of SARS-CoV2 and the likely emergence of other Coronavirus- mediated
diseases in the long run.
A potential solution for some of the above issues is to favour the adoption of adaptive trial design
features (inclusion of predefined toxicity/efficacy stopping rules, biomarker-adjusted enrolment,
etc) and the inclusion of multiple phases, interventions and patient groups under the same
regulatory framework, using the so-called “master protocol” model[14]. Advantages of this model
include: i) the possibility to compare efficacy of multiple interventions against a single, wellstandardized control arm ii) the possibility to compare across multiple treatments, particularly
relevant in a scenario where time bias is likely to play a major role: mortality is likely to be subject
to time-dependent variables such as the ICU occupancy ratio or acquired physician experience iii)
the possibility to skew enrolment into more effective/less toxic arms as new data are accumulated
iv) the possibility to introduce novel treatment arms or stratification biomarkers as these are
identified in preclinical or translational studies v) the possibility to collect samples for translational
studies under a unified and homogeneous framework, increasing their informativeness. We
identified 18 trials with declared adaptive features in their designs (supplementary table 5), among
which most notable is the large SOLIDARITY trial promoted by WHO to test 4 treatment options
(Remdesivir; Lopinavir/Ritonavir; Lopinavir/Ritonavir with Interferon beta-1a; and Chloroquine or
Hydroxychloroquine) against standard of care.
Master protocols are themselves subject to specific biases, in particular the need to adjust for
multiple hypotheses testing [14, 15], and often require sophisticated monitoring and logistics which
can only be accomplished within large organizations. This calls for stronger interaction between
stakeholders like pharma companies, regulatory bodies, funding entities and patient organizations.
In the present rapidly changing scenario such frameworks may be of particular utility to efficiently
discard nonviable hypotheses and prioritize treatment that deserve proper testing on larger scales.
Experience gained in some fields where master protocols are increasingly adopted, such as
oncology [16, 17], may inform trial design.
