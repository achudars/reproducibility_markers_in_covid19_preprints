Abstract
With the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus since Fall 2019, public health confinement measures
to contain the propagation of the pandemic are taken. Our method to estimate the reproductive number
using Bayesian inference with time-dependent priors enhances previous approaches by considering a
dynamic prior continuously updated as restrictive measures and comportments within the society
evolve. In addition, to allow direct comparison between reproductive number and introduction of
public health measures in a specific country, the infection dates are inferred from daily confirmed cases
and death with the mean time between a case being declared as positive and its death estimated on
1430 cases at 10.7 days. The evolution of the reproductive rate in combination with the stringency
index is analyzed on 31 European countries. We show that most countries required tough state
interventions with a stringency index equal to 83.6 out of 100 to reduce the reproductive number below
one and control the progression of the epidemic. In addition, we show a direct correlation between the
time taken to introduce restrictive measures and the time required to contain the spread of the epidemic
with a median time of 8 days. Our analysis reinforces the importance of having a fast response with a
coherent and comprehensive set of confinement measures to control the epidemic. Only combinations
of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have shown to be effective.

Introduction

Since being first observed in Wuhan in late 2019, the outbreak of the 2019 SARS-CoV-2 virus is
strongly affecting societies and economies. The transmission rate, pressure on the healthcare system
and lack of effective treatment lead countries to take public health measures to limit the spread of the
virus. The confinement measures range from banning gatherings to complete lockdowns and closing
borders 1,2. Additional measures include individual protection with various levels of mask wearing
injunctions, and contact tracing with quarantine. This work has focused on developing reliable
modelling approaches to evaluate the impact of public health measures. Our method is based on
analyzing the reporting of European countries to evaluate the temporal influence of non-pharmaceutical

interventions (NPIs) on the effective reproduction number Rt. The effective reproduction number aims
to quantify the number of secondary infections caused by an individual over the time at which this
person is infected. It is important to make the distinction between the effective and basic reproduction
rate. The basic reproduction R0 refers to the evolution of the disease when the population is fully
susceptible to the disease while the effective reproductive rate Rt factors numerous parameters, such
as the susceptible population, the transmission, the immunity acquired within the population, amongst
others 3. The reproduction rate is a key parameter to evaluate the evolution of an epidemic. Any value
below one indicates that the spread is decreasing, any value above one indicates that the spread is
increasing. The reproductive number allows a direct comparison of the epidemiologic profiles observed
in different cohorts of population, such as specific risk factors driven cohorts, countries, etc. with
distinct characteristics (population, testing methods, etc). It allows thus to consider temporality and
populational or cohorts characteristics.
Numerous methods have been developed to compute the reproductive rate and its evolution over time
4
with the aim of identifying the most influential parameters and predicting the development of an
epidemic in a given environment. Initial methods derived the reproductive rate from transmission
model similar to the SIR model 5‚Äì9. However, these models require strong assumptions about the
epidemiology of the disease. Later models, including the Wallinga and Teunis approach 10, use a
likelihood-based estimation procedure to reconstruct infection patterns. These methods have shown
large variations when using daily data11. Most approaches aiming at correcting these fluctuations
appeared to be sensitive to smoothing parameters11,12. An additional method to mitigate these
drawbacks that is very robust to underreporting was later developed by Cori et al.13
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, various studies have looked at the impact of public health
interventions on the evolution at regional or national level. The first studies, on data from China,
proving the impact of NPI strategies to reduce the reproductive rate used mechanistic transmission
models to obtain the reproductive number, with the drawbacks associated with these models14,15.
Further studies focused on how state interventions prevented ICU capacity to be overwhelmed as well
as their impact on fatalities in the UK16, Germany17 and France18. While these researches focused on
individual country, a recent study aimed to demonstrate the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions
in 11 European countries19. This study assumed that the various interventions had the same effect
across countries and that their impact was independent of the timing of the measure. In addition, this
study assumed the reproductive number to be fixed between the different measures. However, a recent
research shows that community changes also play a role in slowing the evolution of the virus20.
The aim of this work is to extend previous researches by focusing on the effects of state interventions
in 31 European countries. As the evolution of the reproductive number is a function of at least three
important parameters: the type of the restrictive measures; the effect of these measures and changes in
behaviors with specific societal properties and the size of various compartmental cohorts involved, we
do not aim to quantify the effect of each measure. Instead, we aim to show how these combined
interventions and their temporality have influenced the spread of the virus.

Material and methods

The impact of public health measures to control SARS-CoV-2 is evaluated by analyzing the
reproductive number computed on incidence data. Our methodology is based on estimates of
incubation time, onset to confirmed, and onset to death distributions. The estimation of the reproductive
rate is a variation of the one proposed by Cori et al.13. While their method assumes a constant gamma

distribution for the prior distribution, the presented model takes advantage of the information gained
in time by updating the prior distribution for each window with the previous posterior.
2.1

Determining incubation time, onset to confirmed, and onset to death distributions

The method described below allows to compute the reproductive number without developing a
transmission model and hence only requires a hypothesis on the serial interval. The serial interval
measures the period between the symptoms onset in a primary care and the symptoms onset in a
secondary case infected by the primary case. The number of new infections on a given day can be
estimated as follows:
ùë°

ùê∏[ùêº(ùë°)] = ùëÖ(ùë°) ‚àë ùë§ùë† ùêº(ùë° ‚àí ùë†)
ùë†=1

where ùë§ùë† is the serial interval. The distribution of ùë§ùë† for the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found to have a
mean of 4.8 days and a standard deviation of 2.3 days 21.

Given the time at which an infection ùêº(ùë°) occurred is not available, the number of confirmed cases and
deaths on a given day are used as proxies, keeping in mind that the developed method is able to
deal with underreporting. A gamma distribution with a median incubation period at 4.4 days from
confirmed infection and diagnosis outside of the epicenter of Hubei Province, China, based on official
reports from governmental institutes was derived 22. The mean and deviation were then obtained by
fitting a gamma distribution to the quantile provided in this study. The period between the onset of the
symptoms and a case being confirmed in Switzerland was estimated to 5.6 days23. Incubation, onset to
confirmed, and onset to death periods were assumed to be gamma distributed and their mean and
standard deviation are summarized in table 1, where the onset refers to the symptoms onset.
From the latter periods it is possible to calculate a posterior distribution of Rt based on the inferred
infection dates extracted from the confirmed cases and deaths reported. For the daily cases declared
(incidence), a shift following a gamma distribution between the defined cases (confirmed or dead) and
the time of infection is randomly generated. For each case, the new date of infection is generated by
subtracting the shift to the reported date. This procedure is performed iteratively with the mean of daily
simulated number of infections stored. This approach increases the robustness of our method by
naturally smoothing the data. This step is critical in order to deal with data unregularly reported.
2.2

Correcting the number of infections

In addition, the infections for the most recent days are corrected (Scire et al.23) to factor delayed
reporting:

Estimation of the reproductive number using Bayesian inference with time-dependent
priors

The method presented in this report is a variation of the one proposed by Cori et al.13. Assuming the
incidence at time t ùêºùë° is Poisson distributed so that the likelihood of the incidence ùêºùë° given ùëÖùë° and
conditional on previous incidences ùêº0 , ‚ãØ , ùêºùë°‚àí1 :
ùëÉ(ùêºùë° |ùêº0 , ‚ãØ , ùêºùë°‚àí1 , ùë§, ùëÖùë° ) =

(ùëÖùë° Œõ ùë° )ùêºùë° ùëí ‚àíùëÖùë°Œõùë°
ùêºùë° !

with Œõ ùë° = ‚àëùë°ùë†=1 ùë§ùë† ùêºùë°‚àíùë† where ùë§ùë† is the serial interval.
The posterior of the reproductive number ùëÖùë° conditional on previous incidences is:
ùëÉ(ùëÖùë° |ùêº0 , ‚ãØ , ùêºùë°‚àí1, ùêºùë° , ùë§) ‚àù ùëÉ(ùêºùë° |ùêº0 , ‚ãØ , ùêºùë°‚àí1 , ùë§, ùëÖùë° )ùëÉ(ùëÖùë° )
While the method developed by Cori et al.13 assumes a constant gamma distribution for the prior
distribution, the presented model takes advantage of the information gained in time by updating the
prior distribution for each window with the previous posterior:
ùëÉ(ùëÖùë° ) = ùëÉ(ùëÖùë°‚àí1 |ùêº0 , ‚ãØ , ùêºùë°‚àí2 , ùêºùë°‚àí1 , ùë§)
The 95% CI is then derived by computing the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles.
The reproductive number Rt based on the confirmed cases is reported up to 9 days before the last date
at which results are available. This corresponds to the median time for confirmed cases to be reported.
Using the same method, Rt based on the cases reported as dead is reported up to 19 days before the last
day on which deaths were reported for a given country.
2.4

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The above described methodology is evaluated on European countries, with a full dataset available for
33 European countries. For our analysis, Russia and Ukraine were removed from our dataset as the
reported daily death are still increasing for these two countries when we are interested in countries
which have successfully contained the evolution of the pandemic before the 23rd of May 2020. We
were therefore left with a set of 31 European countries.

Results

3.1

Determining the period between a positive case and death

In this study, the period between a case being reported positive and the death of the individual was
extracted from 1430 cases provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). Our result
provides a distribution on a much larger dataset than the one built which used between 24 and 33 cases
22,29
. Three different distributions were tested: lognormal, Weibull and gamma with the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) being used to identify the best distribution. The results are summarized in
Table 3.

A gamma distribution with a mean and a standard deviation equal respectively to 10.7 and 6.73 days
was found to best fit the data from infection to death. The distribution along the extracted data are
shown in Figure 1. This distribution was then combined with the incubation period derived by Linton
et al.22 to obtain the period between onset and death shown in Table 1.

is applied in the top part for the estimated daily infections date inferred from these cases and in the
middle plot for the derived reproductive rates. These results are shown along the evolution of the
stringency index displayed in the bottom plot. Austria is a good analysis case. Indeed we can observe
that the reproductive rate started to decline before the introduction of restrictive measures between
March 13th and 17th, but the reduction was intensified by these measures. The reproductive rate then
plateaued at around 0.65 during the lockdown. Recently, the reproductive rate has been oscillating
around one. This last phase shows the difficulty to reduce the number of cases below a certain threshold
with the emergence of localized clusters, whose identification will be critical to avoid a second wave.

reported deaths and confirmed cases shown with bars, inferred estimated infection distributions shown
as solid lines. Middle: the solid lines represent the mean of the estimated reproductive rate and the
shaded area the 95% CI (see Methods). Bottom: the evolution of the stringency index is plotted.

The stringency index developed as part of the OxCGRT project28 was used to assess the role of state
interventions in controlling the epidemic. This index was compared with the evolution of the
reproductive rate, rather than the incidence of confirmed or dead cases. It helps comparing countries
that have heterogeneous testing or reporting policies. While the reproductive rate is also subject to
variations in these policies, it depends on the change in confirmed and death cases, therefore allowing
comparison between countries with different policies. For each country, the public health measures
and the stringency index are analyzed when reproductive number based on the confirmed cases dropped
below one. The hypothesis is that it can help identifying the most efficient set of public health measures.
The stringency indexes of the analyzed countries are presented in Figure 3. When countries managed
to reduce their reproductive rate below one, they had a mean stringency index of 83.6 out of 100 with
a standard deviation of 13.5. When Rt dropped below one, the median severity of the measures along
their individual severity out of 100 for each category defined in the OxCGRT dataset was the
following: a) School closed (100/100) ; b) Non-essential economic activities closed (100/100); c)
Public events were cancelled (100/100); d) Gathering of more than 10 people banned (100/100); e)
Mandatory at home policy with minimal exceptions (67/100); f) Movements in the country were
restricted (100/100).

Figure 3: Stringency index per country when Rt dropped below 1. The median value is indicated with
the dotted line.

In order to assess the impact of taking restrictive measures early in the crisis, the time taken to introduce
initial restrictive measures was compared to the period taken to control the epidemic. The time until
the introduction of restrictive measure was defined as the period between the fifth death in a given
country and the stringency index reaching a score of 35. The stringency index threshold at 35
corresponds to the lowest score observed when a country reached a Rt smaller than one which was
observed for Andorra. The time required to control the epidemic was then defined as the period between
the fifth death and the reproductive rate based on the confirmed cases dropping below one. The results
along a linear regression are presented in Figure 4. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.762 was
found between the two variables indicating that there is indeed a positive benefit of taking early
measures to control the epidemic.

Discussion

Confirmed cases and death are widely available in the public domain, but to estimate the infection
dates, the incubation period and the period between the onset of the symptoms and the person having
a positive test or dying is required. The incubation period was initially derived on Chinese cases22
and it was assumed that this property is intrinsic to the virus and is therefore relevant for European
countries. The period between the symptoms onset and a case being confirmed has been derived on
Swiss patient23. The period between the symptoms onset and the death of the patient was derived on
Chinese data22, but this period was not available for European patients. Based on 1430 Swiss cases,
we found this period to have a mean of 15.3 days compared to 16.3 days in Linton et al.22. It was then
assumed that this period was relevant for the European countries included in our study. It should be
noted that this period is not only critical to understand how infections evolved at a given time, but is
also very important to predict the occupancy of ICU units.
The method developed to estimate the effective reproductive number is based on the method
developed by Cori et al.13. This method only requires the serial interval and an initial assumptions of
the reproductive number. The advantage of the method presented in this report is that we are less
reliant on the initial assumptions of the basic reproduction number. While Cori et al.13 assumes the
prior is fixed in time, we constantly adapt it with new data. The initial assumptions will then
converge to the computed reproductive number as more data are available. This is important as it is
very difficult at the beginning of an epidemic to correctly evaluate the basic reproductive number R0
30
. In the future, our method will therefore be generalizable to new epidemics and provide reliable
data at the start of the epidemic by being less reliant on the initial estimation of the basic
reproduction number. However, as previous methods developed to estimate the reproduction number,
our method is sensible to change in testing policy within a given country. Indeed these changes will
most probably increase the number of positive cases without reflecting an increased seroprevalence
within the society. It is also important to note that as there is a delay between the infection of an
individual and the individual testing positive or dying, there is always a lag between the reproduction
number measured today and the actual reproduction number.
Our analysis shows that when Rt reduced below one, the median severity of the measures for each
category was important with a median stringency index of 83.6 out of 100. In addition the standard
deviation of the index, which is equal to 13.5, shows that most countries required similar measures to
control the epidemic. It is not possible to determine the impact of each individual measure as most
countries took them in different order and often a given country took multiples ones at the same time,
but the high stringency index reinforces the central idea that only important combinations of NPIs
allow to control the pandemic. It is interesting to analyze the measure individually, not to determine
their individual impact, but to determine which set of measures country had put in place when they
successfully controlled the epidemic. If we look at the median restrictions when countries managed to
control the epidemic, they were all at their maximum level apart from some exceptions on the closing
of public transport as well as people being allowed to go out of with minimal daily exceptions. The
two categories which had the strongest restrictions were the restrictions on public events and the

school closing. All countries required cancelling public events apart from Sweden and Andorra
which only recommended to cancel them. One limitation of the dataset used in this analysis is that it
does not measure whether people have to wear mask either in public transport or in all closed
environments. It would be important to include those data as more countries are introducing this type
of measures to prevent the resurgence of the virus.
Our analysis also looked at the timing of the NPIs introduction. We found that there is a strong
correlation (Pearson coefficient of 0.762) between the time at which NPIs were introduced and the
time at which a country managed to control the epidemic with a reproductive number reducing below
one. The United Kingdom can serve as an interesting example. The UK had initially planned to build
‚Äútargeted herd immunity‚Äù delaying the introduction of restrictive measure. As a result of this delay,
the UK were only able to contain the epidemic 30 days after the fifth death occurred in the country
when the median time for the countries included in our analysis was of eight days. There are three
outliers in our analysis being Andorra, Sweden and Iceland. Sweden has decided not to introduce a
complete lockdown and stands with one of the highest daily death incidence in Europe (May 23rd :
Sweden - 5.34 deaths per million people per day; other European countries analyzed 0.82 on the
same day 25 ).
A drawback of considering the evolution in the different countries at a national level and not at a
regional one is that the heterogeneity of the spread of the virus is disregarded. To evaluate not only
the effects of the NPIs but also the resurgence of localized clusters, it is important to look where the
cases are located at a more local level. There is therefore a trade-off where the reproduction number
is more reliable when evaluated on a larger amount of cases, but less representative as it does not take
into account local disparities.
Our study on the impact of health measures focused on European countries but can be extended to
other countries for which data on the daily incidence as well as the NPIs taken on a given day are
available. To extend this study to a larger set of countries, it would however be necessary to adapt the
period between the onset of the symptoms and a case being confirmed or the death of a patient.
However, while a sensitivity analysis would be required to assert the influence of these parameters,
the relatively small difference between the periods derived in Switzerland and in China (6.3%) in
regards to the incertitude on the other parameters (daily incidence, serial interval) lets us believe that
this factor is likely to play a marginal role if our analysis was to be extended to more countries.
Additional data could help refining our conclusions. First, hospitalizations data could be added as
those would not be influenced by changes in testing policies within a given country. In addition,
looking at the reproduction number within the different age groups could improve our understanding
of the impacts of the different NPIs on these various groups. This information would be crucial to
develop effective health policies protecting the most vulnerable while provoking minimal disruptions
to the society and the economy.
