ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine the association between smoking and progression of COVID-19.
Design: A meta-analysis of 12 published papers.
Data Source: PubMed database was searched on April 6, 2020.
Eligibility criteria and data analysis: We included studies reporting smoking behavior of
COVID-19 patients and progression of disease. Search terms included “smoking”, “smoker*”,
“characteristics”, “risk factors”, “outcomes”, and “COVID-19”, “COVID”, “coronavirus”, “sar
cov-2”, “sar cov 2”. There were no language limitations. One author extracted information for

each study, screened the abstract or the full text, with questions resolved through discussion
among both authors. A random effects meta-analysis was applied.
Main Outcome Measures: The study outcome was progression of COVID-19 among people
who already had the disease.
Results: We identified 12 papers with a total of 9,025 COVID-19 patients, 878 (9.7%) with
severe disease and 495 with a history of smoking (5.5%). The meta-analysis showed a significant
association between smoking and progression of COVID-19 (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.49-3.39,
p=0.001). Limitations in the 12 papers suggest that the actual risk of smoking may be higher.
Conclusions: Smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having
higher odds of COVID-19 progression than never smokers. Physicians and public health
professionals should collect data on smoking as part of clinical management and add smoking
cessation to the list of practices to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic.

What is already known on this topic
•

Smoking increases risk and severity of pulmonary infections because of damage to upper
airways and a decrease in pulmonary immune function.

What this study adds
•

Smoking is associated with COVID-19 severity.

•

Smoking history should be part of clinical management of COVID-19 patients and
cessation should be added to the list of practices to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
COVID-19, the coronavirus-transmitted infectious disease, has caused a worldwide
pandemic. Smoking1 2 and e-cigarette use3 increase risk and severity of pulmonary infections
because of damage to upper airways and a decrease in pulmonary immune function. In particular,
smokers have a higher risk of infection and mortality from Cov-MERS.4 Two reviews5 6 of the
first 5 papers presenting data on smoking and COVID-19 reached different conclusions. Another
review described 6 published case series presenting data on smoking among COVID-19 patients
but did not draw a conclusion about the association of severity of COVID-19 with smoking.7 We
reviewed and summarized 12 papers presenting data on the association between smoking and
severity of COVID-19.
Methods
We conducted a systematic search using PubMed database on April 6, 2020, with the
search term: ((smoking) OR (characteristics) OR (risk factors) OR (outcomes) OR (smoker*))
AND ((COVID-19) OR (COVID) OR (coronavirus) OR (sars cov-2) OR (sars cov 2)) for studies
published between January 1, 2020 and April 6, 2020. There were no language restrictions. A
total of 396 studies were retrieved through the search, of which 12, 10 from China,8-17 1 from
Korea,18 and 1 from the US,19 included data on smoking behavior and COVID-19 disease
progression (Table 1). Ten studies8 10-18 were based on hospitalized patients and two9 19 included
both hospitalized patients and outpatients.
The exposure group is those who had a history of smoking (current smokers or former
smokers) and unexposed group was never smokers. Five studies8 10 12 14 17assessed whether the
patient was a “current smoker,” three studies9 16 19 assessed whether the patient was a current or

former smoker (as separate categories), and four studies11 13 15 18 assessed whether the patent had
a “history of smoking” (current or former).
Outcome is progression of COVID-19 to more severe or critical conditions or death
(Table 1). Two studies14 16 categorized the outcome as severe (respiratory distress with
respiratory rate ≥30/min, or oxygen saturation ≤93% at rest, or oxygenation index ≤300 mmHg,
based on the diagnostic and treatment guideline for SARS-CoV-2 issued by Chinese National
Health Committee16) or mild, three8 11 12 categorized the outcome as progression or improvement,
two10 19 categorized the outcome as ICU admission or non-ICU admission, one9 categorized the
outcome as the primary composite end point (ICU admission, the use of mechanical ventilation,
or death) or not, two15 17 categorized the outcome as death or survivor, one13 categorized the
outcome as the occurrence of severe cases (without defining severe) or death or mild, and one18
categorized the outcome as clinical deterioration during the hospitalization and needed
supplemental oxygen therapy.
We computed unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each
study using the number of smokers (current and former) and never smokers with and without
disease progression. Random effects meta-analysis was performed using the Stata 14.0 metan
command and using metabias command with Harbord and Peters to test for the presence of
publication bias.
Patients or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting of our
research. We will widely disseminate our findings working with the media and interested
clinical and public health groups.

Results
A total of 9,025 COVID-19 patients included in our meta-analysis, 878 of whom (9.7%)
experienced disease progression and 495 with a history of smoking (5.5%). A total of 88 patients
with a history of smoking (17.8%) experienced disease progression, compared with 9.3% of
never smoking patients.
The meta-analysis showed an association between smoking and COVID-19 progression
(OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.49-3.39, p=0.001) (Figure 1). There was not significant heterogeneity
among the studies (I2=28.9%, p=0.162) or publication bias (Harbord’s p=0.155, Peters’
p=0.668).
Discussion
Our analysis confirms that smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with
smokers having 2.25-times the odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes than never smokers. This
finding contrasts with an earlier meta-analysis,6 which included only 5 studies and used a nonstandard method to compute the meta-analysis. The finding that smoking is associated with
COVID-19 progression is not surprising because of the adverse effects of smoking on pulmonary
immune function.1 2
Our study has several limitations.
The definition of “smoking” sometimes includes former smokers and sometimes does
not. Only three studies9 16 19 separated current and former smokers in different categories, which
was not enough data to do a meta-analysis for current and former smokers separately. Because
the lung recovers after someone stops smoking, including former smokers in the exposed group
biases the effect estimate to the null.

Reported smoking prevalence patients in all studies was substantially below smoking
prevalence in the corresponding populations. Smoking prevalence in the 10 studies in China
ranged from 3.8% to 14.6% vs 27.7% (52.1% for men and 2.7% for women) in the population in
2015,20 18.5% in the Korean patients vs. 21.1%21 (37.0% for men and 5.2% for women) in 2017,
and 3.6% in the US patients vs. 13.7%22 (15.6% for men and 12.0% for women) in 2018. It is
highly likely that many smokers were misclassified as nonsmokers, which also biases the risk
estimate toward the null.
We computed and assessed unadjusted odds ratios based on the numbers of patients
reported in the studies. Only one11 of the studies reported unadjusted and adjusted ORs using
multivariate analysis; after adjusting for confounding, the effect of smoking on disease severity
was higher (unadjusted: OR 12.19, 95% CI 1.76-84.31, p=0.011; adjusted: OR 14.29, 95% CI
1.58-25.0, p=0.018).
None of these studies assessed e-cigarette use.
All these limitations suggest that this analysis underestimates the risk of smoking in
terms of increasing COVID-19 severity.
All 12 studies were of patients who had already developed COVID-19, so the risk
estimate we report does not represent the effect of smoking on the risk of contracting COVID-19
in the general population. As population-level testing ramps up, it would be useful to collect data
on smoking and e-cigarette use to determine what risks these behaviors impose in terms of
infection.
Conclusions
Smoking is associated with COVID-19 disease progression. Physicians and public health
professionals should collect data on smoking and, given the pulmonary effects of e-cigarettes,3 e-
