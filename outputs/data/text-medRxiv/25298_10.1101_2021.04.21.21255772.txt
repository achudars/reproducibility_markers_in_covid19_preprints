How do we measure oxygen access?

ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted global oxygen system deficiencies and revealed gaps in how
we understand and measure “oxygen access”. We present a case study on oxygen access from 58
health facilities in Lagos state, Nigeria. We found large differences in oxygen access between
facilities (primary vs secondary, government vs private) and describe four key domains to consider
when measuring oxygen access.

Use: 8/58 (14%) of facilities had a functional pulse oximeter for detecting hypoxaemia (low blood
oxygen level) and guiding oxygen care. Oximeters were typically located in outpatient clinics (12/27,
44%), paediatric ward (6/27, 22%), or operating theatre (4/27, 15%), not suitable for children, and
infrequently used.
Availability: 34/58 (59%) facilities had a functional source of oxygen available on the day of
inspection, of which 31 (91%) facilities had it available in a single ward area, typically the operating
theatre or maternity ward.
Cost: Oxygen was free to patients at primary health centres, when available, but expensive in
hospitals and private facilities, with the median cost for 2 days oxygen 13000 ($36 USD) and 27500
($77 USD) naira, respectively.
Patient access: No facilities were adequately equipped to meet minimum oxygen demands for
patients. We were unable to determine the proportion of hypoxaemic patients who received oxygen
therapy with available data.
We highlight the importance of a multi-faceted approach to measuring oxygen access that assesses
access at the point-of-care, and ideally at the patient-level. We propose standard metrics to report
oxygen access and describe how these can be integrated into routine health information systems
and existing health facility assessment tools.

SUMMARY BOX
• Oxygen access is poorly understood and the most commonly used metrics (e.g. presence of
an oxygen source) do not correlate well with actual access to patients.
•

Pulse oximetry use is a critical indicator for the quality of oxygen services and may be a
reasonable reflection of oxygen coverage to patients with hypoxaemia.

•

Oxygen, and pulse oximeter, availability must be assessed at the point-of-care in all major
service delivery areas, as intra-facility oxygen distribution is highly inequitable.

•

Minimum functional requirements for oxygen sources must be assessed, as many oxygen
concentrators and cylinders may be present without being in working order.

How do we measure oxygen access?

BACKGROUND
Oxygen therapy is an essential medicine, required for stabilisation and treatment of severely ill
patients with conditions such as COVID-19, pneumonia, and sepsis, and safe anaesthetic care.1
Reliable oxygen services are therefore crucial for every health facility that cares for unwell
newborns, children, or adults, and every facility providing obstetric, surgical and post-operative care.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of hospital oxygen systems and exacerbated
existing deficiencies.2 The pandemic has also revealed gaps in how we understand “oxygen access”
and the tools we use to measure it.3
In this paper, we use an illustrative case study from Nigeria to describe four domains of data
required to meaningfully assess oxygen access. We aim to share lessons learnt about assessing
oxygen systems in a variety of facility contexts, to provide guidance for hospital managers, health
administrators, policymakers, funders, and supporting non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

What do we mean by “oxygen access”?

Access to medicines from a health systems perspective involves medication availability, affordability,
quality, and rational use.4 This means that oxygen access requires quality oxygen therapy to be
available and affordable to those who need it, when they need it, and used in a safe and rational
way.
While these four core domains apply to all essential medicines, oxygen systems are somewhat
unique. Medical oxygen must achieve high quality standards – including being ≥85% in purity. For
medical oxygen to be safely administered, delivery devices must be appropriate for the particular
patient and indication (e.g. nasal cannula, mask with reservoir bag) and guided by the clinical
situation and blood oxygen measurements (e.g. SpO2, peripheral oxygen saturation from a pulse
oximeter). Medical oxygen must be continually available at points-of-care throughout health
facilities – from emergency departments, to wards, and operating theatres. Achieving this depends
on a range of medical technologies and devices (e.g. oxygen concentrators, cylinders, piping), people
(e.g. technicians, nurses/midwives, doctors, administrators) and broader infrastructure and logistic
systems (e.g. power supply, maintenance and repair tools and systems) (Figure 1).
Current widely used routine facility survey tools focus on the binary question of “is oxygen
equipment available?”. This approach neglects many of these other important dimensions, as well as
whether the equipment is functional, what clinical areas it serves, whether healthcare workers can
recognise who requires oxygen therapy, or if patients can afford it. As such, this binary approach is a
poor reflection of whether patients who need oxygen are actually getting it.5

Case Study: INSPIRING project, Lagos, Nigeria
Nigeria is a populous lower-middle income country in west Africa with high child (2019: under-five
mortality rate 117.2 per 1,000 live births) and maternal mortality ratios (2017: 770 per 100,000 live
births)6. Lagos is the most populous state, located in the south-west on the Gulf of Guinea. The Lagos
population live in urban/peri-urban environments and have lower child mortality rates (50 per 1,000
live births) and poverty levels (1.1% live in severe poverty) compared to Nigeria as a whole.7
Recent studies in Nigeria have shown major deficiencies in existing hospital oxygen systems and
highlighted the importance of oxygen in improving pneumonia case management and preventing
deaths.5 8-12 To better understand the current oxygen capacity and needs of health facilities in Lagos,
we surveyed 58 health facilities in Ikorodu local government area (LGA), with an emphasis on

paediatric care. We included all government primary health centres (PHCs, n=28), all secondary
healthcare facilities (SHFs, n=3) and a random sample of private primary care facilities (n=27/148)
(Figure 2). There are no tertiary care facilities in Ikorodu LGA.
Trained data collectors conducted facility visits between January and August 2020, collecting data
from observation, equipment testing and staff surveys using a standardised form, input directly onto
tablet computers using CommCare (Dimagi, Cambridge MA, USA). We used Handi+ and UltraMax02
oxygen analysers (Maxtec, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) to test oxygen purity and ProSim SPOT Light
(Fluke Corporation, Everett WA, USA) to test pulse oximeter function. We cleaned and analysed data
using Stata 15 (StataCorp, College Station TX, USA), and report data descriptively under four broad
domains: patient access; oxygen availability; oxygen use; oxygen cost (Figure 3).

Patient and Public Involvement

This study was conducted to inform the “Integrated Sustainable childhood Pneumonia and Infectious
disease Reduction in Nigeria” (INSPIRING) program, implemented by Save the Children to improve
child health in Jigawa and Lagos states. INSPIRING involved civil society representatives in co-design
activities, including a co-design workshop in April 2019 involving representatives from civil society,
local and national government, and professional organisations, together with Save the Children, GSK,
and evaluation partners. Selection of the facilities was conducted in partnership with the Ikorodu
local government. Community perspectives were sought during the situational analysis but did not
contribute substantively to this study.

Oxygen Use
Pulse oximetry is the key to rational oxygen use, enabling health care workers to accurately detect
hypoxaemia (low blood oxygen level), guide oxygen treatment decisions, and subsequently reduce
mortality.9 13

Is a pulse oximeter present and functional?

We located pulse oximeters in all three SHFs–exclusively located in the paediatric wards; none of the
government PHCs, and 56% (15/27) of the private primary care facilities. In the private facilities,
oximeters were typically located in outpatient clinics (12/27, 44%), paediatric ward (6/27, 22%), or
operating theatre (4/27, 15%) (Table 1). The two government hospitals were the only facilities that
had paediatric oximetry probes available.

How do we measure oxygen access?
We tested 27 oximeters in 22 ward areas, including 4 desktop, 5 handheld and 18 fingertip
oximeters (Table 1, detail in online supplemental appendix). Models varied widely, half (14/27, 52%)
had visible CE markings. 22/27 (81%) oximeters turned on, and 19/27 (70%) provided an SpO2
reading. Testing with the Fluke device revealed 13/19 (68%) were within +/-2% of the correct SpO2
for a simulated healthy person (one read falsely low, five gave no reading). However, only 9/19
(47%) were within +/-3% for a simulated sick person (two read falsely high, 8 gave no reading).
Overall, one-third (9/27) of oximeters were demonstrably functional, including 3/4 (75%) desktop,
1/5 (20%) handheld, and 5/18 fingertip (28%) devices – all at private primary care facilities.

Is pulse oximetry a routine practice?

We found 17/27 (63%) of the oximeters had not been used in the previous day and only five (19%)
had been used ≥10 times (online supplemental appendix). Audit of routine case notes for children
presenting with acute illness to outpatients in a sub-sample of 12 participating clinics (AprilSeptember 2020) showed that pulse oximetry use was low in secondary care facilities (32%, 21/65
patients had SpO2 documented) and negligible in private facilities (2%, 3/177) and PHCs (<1%,
2/608). Thus, despite 31% of facilities having an oximeter, routine use was rare.

What is the capacity of healthcare workers to provide oxygen therapy?

We conducted knowledge and skills tests for 169 healthcare workers (HCWs) in 56 of the 58 facilities
(online supplemental appendix). Participants included doctors, nurses, midwives, health assistants,
and community health extension workers with varying levels of experience (median 12 years).
One quarter (40/169, 24%) of HCWs reported training on oxygen, and one-third of these had been
trained in the past 5 years (online supplemental appendix). Most HCWs (97/169, 57%) reported
experience using oxygen therapy, though only 13 (8%) had administered oxygen in the prior 2weeks. Experience with oxygen therapy was low in government primary care facilities (2/96, 2%, had
used in previous 2-weeks), despite regularly seeing children who required resuscitation (10/96, 10%,
had resuscitated a child in the previous 2-weeks).
Knowledge test results showed generally low appreciation of the fundamentals of oxygen therapy,
with many respondents lacking the confidence to answer questions – particularly in government
primary care facilities (online supplemental appendix). For example, 22% (37/169) of HCWs could
identify the core functions of pulse oximetry (i.e. heart rate and SpO2), and 28% (48/169) recognised
that a child with an SpO2 of 87% warranted oxygen therapy.

Oxygen Availability

Is an oxygen source present?

We found all SHFs (3/3) and private facilities (27/27), and half of PHCs (12/28, 43%), had an oxygen
source in the facility (Table 1). Similar numbers of facilities used oxygen cylinders and oxygen
concentrators (34 versus 32), and many facilities had both (24/58, 41%; Table 1).
Most oxygen cylinders (49/82, 60%) and concentrators (27/42, 64%) were in the operating theatre,
intensive care unit, or delivery room (online supplemental appendix). Seven facilities had cylinders in
store for distribution to wards on demand.

Is the oxygen source functional?

We visually inspected and tested 42 oxygen concentrators in 36 ward areas; 11 could not be fully
tested due to power failure (n=10) or active clinical use (n=1). Models varied greatly and one-third
(26/42, 62%) had visible CE markings. We found 5/42 (12%) were functional at the time of inspection

(Table 1, online supplemental appendix). All used mains power as the primary power source, but
only 4/42 (10%) used a voltage stabiliser to protect the device from power fluctuations.
We visually inspected 82 oxygen cylinders in 43 ward areas, finding 53/82 (65%) cylinders had a
regulator apparatus available (or manifold connection for piped supply) making them fit for use
(Table 1, online supplemental appendix). We did not obtain reliable data on leaks, oxygen purity, or
pressure.
Overall, 34/58 (59%) facilities had a functional source of oxygen available on the day of inspection, of
which 31 (91%) had it available in a single ward area (11 exclusively in the operating theatre, 10
delivery suite, 5 emergency, 2 clinic room, 1 ward, 2 store) (Table 1, online supplemental appendix).
We did not evaluate the presence of appropriate oxygen delivery devices.

What is the technical capacity for oxygen provision?

Five facilities (9%), including all three SHFs, had onsite biomedical engineers or technicians; but only
two of these facilities had staff who had been trained on oxygen equipment (Table 1). Three facilities
(5%) had routine maintenance schedules for medical equipment and reported performing oxygen
concentrator and/or cylinder maintenance in the past 6 months. One facility reported procurement
of concentrator and cylinder spare parts in the past year. We did not evaluate technician skills or
knowledge.

Oxygen Cost

What is the cost of oxygen services to patients?

We obtained patient oxygen cost data from 39/58 (67%) facilities, which variously billed for oxygen
using hourly or daily rates, or per admission, cylinder or episode of use. When available, oxygen was
typically free to patients at PHCs, but expensive in SHFs and private facilities. The median cost for 2days oxygen was 13000 Naira (USD $36) and 27500 Naira (USD $77), respectively, accounting for
two-thirds of the cost of a 3-day admission for a child with severe pneumonia. This is consistent with
previous findings of high out-of-pockets costs for oxygen services in Nigeria5 and reflective of
Nigeria’s relatively high out-of-pocket health expenditure (2018: 77% of total health expenditure14).

How do we measure oxygen access?

What is the cost of providing oxygen services to facilities?

We found no facilities that included oxygen-related items in their budgets, and few could provide
information on pulse oximeter, oxygen concentrator, or cylinder costs. Limited data from 7 facilities
suggested median oximeter purchase cost was 93,500 Naira (USD $260), range 7,000-180,000 ($19500); concentrator purchase cost was 160,000 Naira (USD $446), range 80,000-350,000 ($223-975);
and cylinder refill cost was 640 Naira per cubic metre (~USD $2), range 250-1470 ($1-4) (Table 1).

Patient Access

Is oxygen therapy provided to all patients who need it?

Triangulating the data from the 58 health facilities shows clear gaps between need and access with
the vast majority of facilities and ward areas lacking a functional oxygen supply and/or pulse
oximetry capacity (online supplemental appendix). At best, 10 facilities had oxygen supply adequate
to provide minimum services to at least one ward area but only the two government hospital
paediatric wards had both oxygen supplies and routine pulse oximetry. Without routine pulse
oximetry, the other facilities are likely to miss up to 50% of patients with hypoxaemia even with
adequate oxygen supplies.8
The capacity to deliver oxygen services does not tell us whether the patients who need oxygen are
actually getting it. The clearest metric to measure actual oxygen access to patients is the proportion
of patients with hypoxaemia (typically defined as SpO2<90%) who are provided with oxygen therapy.
We were unable to obtain this data via clinical audit as pulse oximetry coverage was too low and
hypoxaemia cannot be accurately determined using clinical signs alone.8 Alternative approaches to
measuring oxygen access to patients are using cross-sectional hypoxaemia and oxygen therapy
surveys,15 crude counts of patients who receive oxygen, or relying on HCW recall about oxygen
supply stock-outs.16 These approaches are problematic and provide a poor indication of whether
oxygen is actually reaching those who need it.9

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated the need to better measure access to oxygen therapy and
stimulated activity to respond.3 17 As part of a comprehensive response to the pandemic,18 the World
Health Organization (WHO) has released guidance on oxygen-related biomedical equipment,
including how to conduct facility surveys19 and technical specifications.20-22
Many other governmental and non-governmental organisations are also working to document
oxygen access capacity and needs in health facilities globally – including large scale facility surveys23
24
– and provide practical tools to improve access (e.g. UNICEF online repository at
https://bit.ly/OxygenResources).17 However, if these efforts count oxygen equipment without
assessing actual oxygen availability and patient access, they will overestimate the capacity of current
oxygen systems and condemn patients to sub-standard care – particularly those in smaller and more
remote facilities.
We tested strategies to obtain more meaningful data on oxygen access, identifying lessons learned
that can help HCWs, hospital managers, health administrators, policymakers, and funders who wish
to better understand and respond to the oxygen access crisis (Table 3). We included a wide variety
of health care facilities in Lagos state, Nigeria and while our specific findings reflect this urban
Nigerian environment, the broader lessons about measuring oxygen access are highly generalisable.
We focussed on oxygen access metrics that would be most widely applicable and broadly feasible

but recognise that some readers will also want additional detail on specific populations (e.g.
neonates), services (e.g. CPAP), or supply systems (e.g. cylinder distribution).
Table 3 Summary of Lessons Learned on Assessing Oxygen Access
Lessons learned: Patient Access
• Measuring the proportion of hypoxaemic patients receiving oxygen therapy is the single most
important indicator for evaluating patient access – but is only interpretable with reliable pulse
oximetry data to define the denominator.
• Pulse oximetry coverage (i.e. the proportion of patients who receive pulse oximetry and have SpO2
documented) is a critical indicator of the quality of oxygen services. Given that pulse oximetry is
essential to identifying who requires oxygen and routine pulse oximetry is rare without oxygen
supplies, pulse oximetry coverage may be a reasonable proxy for patient oxygen access.
Lessons learned: Oxygen Use
• The presence of a pulse oximeter correlates poorly with actual use. If clinical data on oximetry use is
unavailable, reported device use may be an acceptable proxy.
• Pulse oximeter presence must be assessed in all major service delivery areas – including availability
of appropriate oximeter devices and probes for patient populations being served (e.g. neonatal and
paediatric care).
• Simple functional testing of oximeters can be done by applying to your own finger. More detailed
testing requires specialised equipment calibrated to particular oximeters and may be most useful to
technicians managing large numbers of oximeters.
• Some low-cost oximeters, particularly fingertip devices, are not suitable for children or unwell
populations with low perfusion and/or dark or thick skin.
• Assessments of healthcare worker knowledge and skills are useful in the context of planning and
conducting training – but are a poor reflection of actual oxygen practices. Oxygen practices are
largely determined by individual motivators (intrinsic and extrinsic), attitudes and behaviour of
peers and seniors, and the culture of the work environment13.
Lessons learned: Oxygen Availability
• Oxygen availability must be assessed at the point-of-care and include all major service delivery
areas. Hospital-wide summary data on the availability of oxygen equipment can be very misleading,
as intra-facility oxygen distribution is highly inequitable (e.g. skewed towards anaesthetic care).
• Minimum functional requirements for oxygen sources must be assessed, as many oxygen
concentrators and cylinders may be present without being in working order. For oxygen
concentrators, this should include assessment of oxygen purity using an oxygen analyser. For
oxygen cylinders, this should include assessment of whether it is currently full or empty, and
whether it is fitted with a regulator and pressure gauge.
• These basic assessments can be carried out by trained non-experts, but more detailed equipment data
requires greater technical expertise.
• Efforts to improve hospital oxygen systems must involve hospital technicians and seek to
understand existing capacities and restraints without blame. Hospital technicians have valuable
skills, experience, and understanding of hospital equipment systems, but are too frequently
neglected by clinical and administrative decision-makers.
Lessons learned: Oxygen Cost
• Oxygen costs can be prohibitive to patients and exacerbate existing inequities. Understanding cost
structures and variation between facilities could help construct more efficient, equitable oxygen
systems.
• Many facilities do not keep clear records of their current oxygen expenditure, making it difficult to
demonstrate financially advantageous alternatives. Further, reliable cost data may be difficult to
obtain without high levels of trust. Assistance to health managers in understanding and forecasting
whole-of-system costs for oxygen could improve oxygen system efficiency and sustainability.

How do we measure oxygen access?
To aid readers in adapting our approach to local context and needs, we describe four domains of
oxygen access that should be considered when seeking to understand and respond to oxygen needs
(Figure 3, Table 3, Table 4).
Table 4 Summary of most useful indicators of oxygen access
Domain
Patient Oxygen
Access

Indicator
Proportion of patients with hypoxaemia receiving oxygen
therapy.

Potential sources
Clinical audit, or routine
health information system

Additional considerations:
- equity between populations (hospital department, age, sex, ethnic
background, socioeconomic status)
- rational use (oxygen provision with versus without indication)
- flow rates and duration of therapy (useful for quantification of
oxygen need and quality improvement)
Oxygen Use

Proportion of acutely unwell patients screened using pulse
oximetry.
Additional considerations:
- pulse oximeter presence and function
- oxygen clinical guideline
- equity between populations (hospital department, age, sex, ethnic
background, socioeconomic status)
- training and skills of healthcare workers

Oxygen
Availability

Proportion of wards/departments with functional oxygen source
and delivery equipment.

Clinical audit, routine health
information system , physical
inspection + device testing,
HCW survey

Physical inspection + device
testing, technician survey

Additional considerations:
- oxygen source presence and function (including oxygen purity
testing for oxygen concentrators)
- delivery devices (cannula, mask, CPAP, flowmeter assembly, etc.)
- maintenance personnel (local capacity and access to expert help)
- equipment inventory and preventive maintenance schedules
- spare parts: access and cost
Oxygen Cost

Daily cost of oxygen therapy to patients
Annual expenditure on oxygen equipment and
maintenance/repairs.

Patient accounts and general
finance ledger, administrator

Additional considerations:
- equity and non-payment action (hospital department, age, poor)
- whole of life cycle (capital and operating costs): oxygen source;
refill cost; spare parts and maintenance; power; consumables.

At the centre is patient oxygen access – evaluating whether patients who need oxygen actually
receive it. Evaluating patient oxygen access requires clinical data on pulse oximetry and oxygen use.
Recent studies from Nigeria and Malawi have shown that without routine pulse oximetry to guide
oxygen therapy, only around 20% of hypoxaemic patients receive oxygen – even if adequate oxygen
supplies are available.9 15 Given that pulse oximetry is essential to identifying who requires oxygen
and routine pulse oximetry is rare without oxygen supplies,5 13 pulse oximetry coverage (i.e. the
proportion of patients who receive pulse oximetry and have SpO2 documented) may be a reasonable
proxy for patient oxygen access.
High level metrics on pulse oximetry and oxygen use can be sourced via clinical audit but are ideally
integrated into health information systems and are essential for health service planning (Table 4).

How do we measure oxygen access?
More detailed data, including who receives oxygen-related care, where, with what, and for how
long, would be desirable for hospital-level quality improvement activities and improving oxygen
system efficiencies.
While measures of oxygen availability are important, existing surveys which contain this metric often
fail to assess functionality of equipment or address intra-hospital distribution, missing huge
deficiencies in oxygen availability at the point of care.5 12 Basic assessments of equipment
functionality and distribution are not difficult and could be integrated into existing surveys such as
the Service Provision Assessment (SPA) and Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA)
(Table 4). More detailed data on equipment types, locations, and access to spare parts is useful for
hospital-level decision-making and efficiency – particularly in facilities providing a wider range of
respiratory support services (e.g. CPAP, mechanical ventilation) across multiple service areas.
Measures of oxygen cost are important for planning purposes but were challenging to obtain in
practice. We propose metrics that address oxygen costs to patients, crucial in contexts where out-ofpocket health expenditure is high, and oxygen costs to facilities/governments obtained from
financial records and surveys (Table 4). However, we recognise the difficulties in obtaining sensitive
financial information and the limitations of relying on administrator or technician recall in the
absence of reliable financial records.
Finally, our case study highlights opportunities for priority improvements in existing oxygen systems.
First, pulse oximeters are low-cost devices that were grossly lacking and could substantially improve
rational use of existing oxygen supplies. Second, while many devices were not fit for use, support for
technicians could likely rehabilitate some of these and prevent future growth of equipment
graveyards (e.g. Open O2 in Malawi, www.openo2.org). Third, many devices did not have CE or
similar quality control markings, highlighting the ongoing challenge of inappropriate equipment
donation and procurement of consumer devices for medical purposes. Fourth, the differences
between government and private facilities highlights that oxygen access is fundamentally an issue of
equity, and efforts must include smaller, poorer, and more rural facilities that care for the most atrisk populations.

Conclusion
Data on oxygen access is lacking and makes efforts to improve oxygen systems for COVID-19 and
beyond clumsy and inefficient. We propose four data domains to assess oxygen systems: patient
access; use; availability; and cost. Measuring these four domains of oxygen access will support local,
regional, and global efforts to provide life-saving oxygen to those in need.
