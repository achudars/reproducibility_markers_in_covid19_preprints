The psychological impact of coronavirus on university students and its socioeconomic determinants in Malaysia

Abstract
This article examines the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) upon university
students’ anxiety level and finds the factors associated with the anxiety disorder in Malaysia. We
collected data from 958 students from 16 different universities using an originally designed
questionnaire. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale 7-item (GAD-7) was used to estimate the
anxiety. We find that 12.3% students were normal, whereas 30.5% were experiencing mild, 31.1%
moderate, and 26.1% severe anxiety. Surprisingly, only 37.2% of students were aware of mental
health support which was provided by their universities. Moreover, it was found that gender as
male (Odds Ratio (OR= 0.798, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)= 0.61 - 1.04)) and having internet
access (OR = 0.44, 95% CI= 0.24 - 0.80) were alleviating factors for the anxiety. Whereas, age
above than 20 years (OR= 1.30, 95% CI= 0.96 - 1.75), ethnicity Chinese (OR=1.72, 95% CI= 0.95
- 3.1), any other disease (OR=2.0, 95% CI=1.44 - 2.79), decreased family income (OR=1.71, 95%
CI=1.34 - 2.17), more time spent on watching COVID-19 related news (OR=1.52, 95% CI=1.17 1.97), and infected relative or friends (OR=1.62, 95% CI=1.06 - 2.50) were risk factors for anxiety
among students. We suggest that the government of Malaysia should monitor the mental health
of the universities’ students more closely and universities should open online mental health support
clinics to avoid the adverse impacts of the anxiety disorder.

The impact of the virus is different in various countries mainly because of the environment, herd
immunity, health system, government strategies, and public response. For example, San Marino
has maximum per million fatalities (1,237) followed by Peru, Belgium, and Andorra2. To avoid
the distressing impact of the COVID-19, every country has adopted numerous health, fiscal, and
public policies. So far, Malaysia has made tremendous progress in controlling the impact of
COVID-19. As a result of the better policies and public responses, as of 11th September 2020,
Malaysia has a total 9,628 confirmed cases out of which 9,167 recovered and 128 died (1.33%).
The first case of COVID-19 in Malaysia was confirmed on 25th January 2020 [1]but the cases
continued to rise steadily until the end of the February 2020. After the 14th of march the sudden
rise in the COVID-19 cases were noted which was believed to be associated with a religious
gathering in Kuala Lumpur (Capital city of Malaysia) [2]. Approximately, 16,000 people attended
that gathering, eventually leading to a rise in the total cases that were observed during the next two
months. The government of Malaysia immediately implemented the Movement Control Order
(MCO) commencing from 18th March 2020 to control the spread of the virus [3], which was
subsequently relaxed in August 2020. During the period of the MCO gatherings at all places were
prohibited including religious services and universities. This was the time when almost all the
universities in Malaysia shifted their mode of teaching from physical to virtual.
The sudden change in the mode of teaching due to the potential risk of death caused by
COVID-19, isolation, and lockdown have increased the anxiety level and created extreme stress
to the general public [4] and students alike [5] The abnormal stress and depression amongst
students not only affect their performance but also is associated with heightened self-injury and
suicidal attempts [6]. Therefore, it is immensely important to monitor the mental health of the
students and assess the risks coupled with preventive factors of the anxiety and associated mental
health issues. We selected Malaysia as a case country because of the better possibility of the data
collection. Secondly, to date, most of the studies have explored the impact of COVID-19 on
students in China, paramedical staff, patients, and even on the general public but the university
students in Malaysia are overlooked. Hence, this paper examines the impact ofCOVID-19 on
students’ anxiety in Malaysia. As well as it finds the socioeconomic factors which are associated
with students' anxiety. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 1.1 reviews the earlier

section 4 concludes the paper.
2. Literature Review
A handful of studies attempted to examine the association between COVID-19 and mental
health. For instance, Tian et al. (2020) [4] investigated the psychological symptoms of 1,060
Chinese citizens during COVID-19 using a symptoms checklist of 90 via an online questionnaire.
They found more than 70% of the total sample had a moderate and higher level of an obsessive
compulsion disorder, interpersonal sensitivity, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism. Interestingly,
people older than 50 years had relatively more symptoms than young people. Moreover, the
symptoms were higher among people who had an education level of undergraduate and below,
been divorced, or widowed.
Likewise, Cheng et al. (2020) [7] in Chinese Jiangsu province, measured the impact of
COVID-19 on the anxiety level amongst 534 pediatric medical staff. Using a self-rating anxiety
scale based upon the Pittsburgh sleep quality index, they found that the prevalence of anxiety was
14.0% amongst the medical staff. They applied stepwise multiple linear regressions to examine
the association between anxiety and other socio-economic factors. It was discovered that having a
physical condition and concerns relating to the epidemic were positively associated with anxiety
levels. Whereas, positional title, better living style, and education were negatively associated with
anxiety level. Similarly, another study conducted by Wang et al. (2020) [8] found that there was
significantly higher psychological distress amongst medical staff deployed to Hubei province
compared to other medical personnel in China.
Most of the studies have only focused on the general public and medical staff (such [as Pieh et
al. (2020), Ferrucci et al., (2020), and Huang and Zhao (2020) [9-11]) but ignored college and
university students. However, a few studies have attempted to estimate the impact of COVID-19
on the mental health of students. Such as, in China, Cao et al. (2020) [12] examined the
psychological impact of the COVID-19 on college students. Using cluster sampling, they collected
data from 7,143 students from Changzhi Medical College China. Using GAD-7, they found that
21.3% of respondents were experiencing mild, 2.7% moderate, and 0.9% severe anxiety.
Furthermore, they applied the ordered logit model and explored that living in urban areas, living
with parents, having a steady family income were protective factors against anxiety. Our study

uses the same methods for measuring the anxiety factors associated with this mental health issue.
However, our study covers around 16 universities, which produces more generalizable and
comprehensive estimates, because of the heterogeneity amongst the sample.
Moreover, Kaparounaki et al. (2020) [13] examined the impact of COVID-19 on the mental
health of university students in Greece. They collected the data from 1,000 university students and
found that 42.5% of the total sample population had anxiety and 74.3% depression. Using similar
data, Patsali et al., (2020) found that depression was present in 12.43% and severe distress was
present in 13.46% of the sample population. Of concern, they noticed a 2.59% increase in suicidal
thoughts. In Malaysia, we could only find one study by Sundarasen et al., (2020) [14] that was
conducted in a similar vein. Their study was the closest to us in terms of our research objectives.
However, they used Zung’s self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) to estimate the anxiety level. Quite
surprisingly, they found only 8% of students were experiencing mild to moderate and moderate to
severe anxiety, which is substantially different from the findings of other studies, hence this
requires further investigation. The basic reason for an extremely low number could be using
Zung’s self-rating anxiety scale. The anxiety scale has been criticized by earlier studies [15-17]
for producing unreliable results. Thus, our study covers a more comprehensive base of 16
universities and applies advanced methods to estimates the anxiety amongst students. We further
explored the factors which influence the anxiety level.
3. Methods
3.1 Data
We created a Google form which consists of 45 questions (including GAD-7) for collecting
data and sent the link through email, WhatsApp, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meetings,
WeChat, and other social media platforms. We collected demographic, social, and economic
information from the respondents such as living area, age, gender, education, current semester,
number of friends, family income, and so on. Whereas, the question related to anxiety was taken
from GAD-7. In total, 958 students from 16 different universities participated in the survey. The
respondents were requested to provide their consent to use their information for research purposes
only. The participation was voluntary and respondents had the option to exit the survey at any
point. Data were collected in July 2020 when the mode of teaching in most of the universities was
entirely virtual learning.

3.2 Variables
The dependent variable “Anxiety Level” was constructed using GAD-7 questionnaire. It is
gleaned from the practical self-reporting questionnaire which consisted of 7 items such as feeling
nervous, not able to stop worrying, worrying to much about different things, trouble relaxing, being
restless, being easily annoyed, and feeling afraid [18]. The GAD-7 is widely used in the literature
and its validity has been tested in numerous studies such as Löwe et al., (2008), Barthel et al.,
(2014), and Seo and Park, (2015) [19-21]. Depending upon the response of the students, four
categories of anxiety were created such as 1 means No anxiety, 2 = mild anxiety, 3 = moderate
anxiety, and 4 = severe anxiety. Hence, the variable has an order from 1 to 4, where 1 means no
anxiety and 4 means severe anxiety. After estimating the anxiety level among students, we applied
ordered logit modeling to examine the impact of various socio-economic and demographic
variables. The list of our variables of interest along with frequencies and percentages is given in
the table 1.

3.3 Model
The ordered logit model is suitable when the proportional odds assumption satisfies and the
coefficients are usually estimated by using the maximum likelihood method. The model has been
used in recent studies by [12,14] to estimate the odds ratios. In our case, we had an ordinal
dependent variable “Anxiety level” and our objective was to predict the odds ratios. The odds
ratios represent the constant effect of an independent variable on the likelihood that one outcome
(dependent variable) will occur.
We had four levels of our dependent variable such as no anxiety, mild anxiety, moderate
anxiety, and severe anxiety. The model can be characterized as follows,
𝑦 ∗ = ∑𝑘𝑖 𝛽𝑘 𝑥𝑘𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖 = 𝑧𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖

Where 𝑦 ∗ is our unobserved dependent variable and 𝑥𝑘𝑖 represents the list of independent
variables, 𝜀𝑖 is the error term, and 𝛽𝑘 shows the coefficients which we have estimated. Please note
that there is no intercept here it means we have estimated m-1 odds ratios that the dependent
variable takes on with respect to a particular value identified in equation 1.
4. Results and discussion
Table 1 shows the frequencies of anxiety levels among students. Surprisingly, almost 57% of
our sampled students were experiencing moderate or severe anxiety during COVID-19, whereas,
almost 62% of the students did not know whether their institutions were providing mental health
support. Perhaps, universities might not have anticipated the sudden surge in anxiety levels,
however, this might have serious repercussions on learning experiences.
The results of the ordered logit model are presented in Table 3. We have only elaborated the
significant results where p-value was less than 0.10. We found that the odds of being at the higherlevel of anxiety decreases (OR=0.798 95% CI = 0.61 to1.04) if the students were male. In other
words, male students were less likely to develop a higher level of anxiety in comparison with
female students. Perhaps, female students are more sensitive to the COVID-19 situation than
males. Furthermore, the odds of being at the higher-level anxiety increases by 1.3 times (95%CI =
0.96 to 1.75) if the students were above 20 years old in comparison to those whose age was below
20 years. Perhaps older students take the impact of coronavirus more seriously which may lead to
an upsurge in anxiety level. Interestingly, the odds of being at a higher level of anxiety increases
by 1.7 times (95% CI = 0.95 to 3.09) if the students were of Chinese ethnicity in comparison to
other ethnicities (Indian, Bengali, Arabian, and Indonesian).
Moreover, having internet access helps to reduce anxiety amongst students. We found that the
odds of being at a higher level of anxiety decreases (OR = 0.45, 95% C. I = 0.25 to 0.80) if students
have internet access. Perhaps, the students can have more entertainment options at home which
may lead to reduce anxiety. Secondly, due to the lockdown or MCO outdoor sports and other
activities were banned, hence, in this situation having internet access could be a significant factor
to control anxiety level. Most importantly, students during the MCO period were taking online
classes, therefore, having an internet connection helps them to concentrate on the study, which
means they would be thinking less of COVID-19.

Undoubtedly, COVID-19 has affected economic activities adversely and because of the
lockdown which has led to personal income reducing significantly. This might have a severe
impact on the welfare and the anxiety level of individuals. We found that the odds of being at the
higher-level of anxiety increase by 1.7 times (95% C.I = 1.34 to 2.17) if students’ family income
diminishes because of the coronavirus. Almost 52% of the students reported that their family
income has reduced because of the low economic activities and lockdown which was the result of
COVID-19.
Furthermore, having any other disease may increase the level of anxiety among students. Our
study found that the odds of being at the higher level of anxiety increase by 2.0 times (95% C.I =
1.44 to 2.79) if students have any other pre-existing disease. Perhaps pre-existing diseases have a
cumulative effect on fear and lead to a higher level of anxiety. Likewise, spending more than 30
minutes weekly on watching the coronavirus related news can significantly increase the anxiety
level among students (OR=1.51, 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.97). Additionally, having an infected friend or
relative can significantly increase the anxiety level amongst students. We found that the odds of
being at the higher level of anxiety increases by 1.62 times (95% C.I = 1.06 to 2.46) if students’
friends or relatives were infected by COVID-19. The likelihood of having anxiety decreases if the
students live with their parents and reside in urban areas. In addition, as the number of close friends
increases, anxiety decreases. However, these results were not significant. Perhaps, future larger
sample size studies may explore some more interesting exploratory discoveries in our study that
may lead to more definite and significant findings. Secondly, the data were collected in July 2020,
when the curve of the COVID-19 in Malaysia was getting flatter. Perhaps, data collection in some
other time periods may produce slightly different results.

5. Conclusion
The COVID-19 outbreak continues to create chaos in almost every country As of September
11th 2020, no vaccination against the virus is available in the market. However, several scientific
groups are in the process of developing a potential vaccine. In response to controlling the virus,
every country has taken various steps such as lockdowns, quarantines, social distancing, isolations,
and MCOs. The fear of death due to COVID-19 and government measures to control the spread
of the virus have affected the mental health of citizens and students in particular. The psychological
impact of COVID-19 in Malaysian students is a relatively unexplored phenomenon. We explored

the anxiety amongst students in Malaysia and found that around 57% of the students were
experiencing moderate to severe anxiety. Surprisingly, only 37% of students were aware of mental
health support services which are provided by their institutions. Additionally, gender as male and
internet access were a protective factor against anxiety, despite the potential for the internet to
increase anxiety through constant worrying news reports. Whereas, age above 20 years, ethnicity
as Chinese, decreased family income, a pre-existing disease, spending more than 30 minutes
weekly on watching or reading COVID-19 related news, and having an infected family or friends
were viewed as the major risk factors for anxiety.
Treatment of anxiety involves various interventions including the medication, counselling, and
therapy, the combination of all of these usually being more effective. We suggest higher education
institutions should assist universities to open mental health support (both psychiatric and
psychology based) clinics on every campus, with online access. These services should be provided
on both an informal and formal basis as well because those students who are unable to visit the
clinic physically can get mental support on call or chat. It is also important to regularly monitor
the mental health condition of the students. The financial packages or support can help families to
maintain their income which eventually lowers the anxiety level. It can also lead to greater
economic productivity in lockdowns. Hence, we suggest the government should also consider
providing financial support to the families working from home during lockdowns and higher
stringency regimes. Moreover, sports clubs and student societies can also reduce anxiety amongst
students by operating within the context of social distancing. These concerns should be addressed
by the Ministries of Education and Quality Control. Our policy suggestions can lower the anxiety
amongst students and can help the policy setters in formulating the adequate policies. Our results
are likely to be of interest to education policy setters around the globe as the majority of students
around the world have experienced very similar issues during Covid-19 lockdowns as teaching has
been online, and so they confront common issues.
