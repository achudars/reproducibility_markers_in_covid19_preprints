Abstract

26

Background: To accurately interpret COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys, knowledge of

27

serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 with a better understanding of patients who do not

28

seroconvert, is imperative. This study aimed to describe serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-

29

2 in a cohort of patients with both severe and mild COVID-19, including extended studies of

30

patients who remained seronegative more than 90 days post symptom onset.

31

Results: Forty-seven patients (mean age 49 years, 38% female) were included. All (15/15)

32

patients with severe symptoms and 29/32 (90.6%) patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19

33

developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in serum. Time to seroconversion was

34

significantly shorter (median 11 vs. 22 days, P=0.04) in patients with severe compared to

35

mild symptoms. Of the three patients without detectable IgG-responses after >90 days, all had

36

detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies and in two, spike-protein receptor binding domain-

37

specific IgG was detected with an in-house assay. Antibody titers were preserved during

38

follow-up and all patients who seroconverted, irrespective of the severity of symptoms, still

39

had detectable IgG levels >75 days post symptom onset.

40

Conclusions: Patients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higher

41

concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. Of those

42

patients who not develop detectable IgG antibodies, all have detectable virus-neutralizing

43

antibodies, suggesting immunity. Our results showing that not all COVID-19 patients develop

44

detectable IgG using two validated commercial clinical methods, even over time, are vital for

45

the interpretation of COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys and for estimating the true infection

46

prevalence in populations.

Introduction

51

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, causing considerable

52

morbidity and mortality worldwide. The severity of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to

53

fatal pneumonitis, with mildly symptomatic patients accounting for approximately 80% of all

54

cases according to current understanding (1). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

55

2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, gains entry to human cells by binding

56

the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with the receptor-binding domain

57

(RBD) of its spike (S) protein (2). Thus, antibodies targeting the S-protein may effectively

58

neutralize the virus (3). Seroprevalence studies usually measure SARS-CoV-2 S- and

59

nucleocapsid (N-) protein specific IgG antibodies; whether these antibodies correlate with

60

protective immunity is however still unknown.

61

The serological responses to other beta-coronaviruses vary. Whilst all patients infected

62

by SARS-CoV were found to develop IgG antibodies (4), some patients with mild symptoms

63

of MERS-CoV failed to develop detectable levels of IgG (5). Several short follow-up studies

64

of mostly hospitalized patients have reported the development of IgG in serum against SARS-

65

CoV-2 in the majority of patients (3,6–10). When patients remain seronegative, it is often

66

concluded that seroconversion would likely occur later; serological findings over a longer

67

period than 30 days post symptom onset (PSO) remain limited. Further investigation of

68

patients who fail to produce detectable levels of IgG is lacking and antibody responses in

69

patients with mild symptoms are also poorly described. Here, we investigated serum-IgG (S-

70

IgG) responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of patients with both severe and mild COVID-19,

71

profiling the patients who remained seronegative.

Materials and Methods

75

Patients and sample collection

76

A cohort of 47 patients were recruited between February 25th and March 25th 2020, at the

77

Department of Infectious Diseases, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.

78

The study protocol was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Registration

79

number 2020-01771) and patients were included after written informed consent. Disease

80

severity was divided into severe and mild: severe cases were defined as those requiring

81

invasive mechanical ventilation or high-flow nasal oxygen, and mild cases as not requiring

82

oxygen nor in-patient hospital care (11). Blood samples were collected during hospitalization

83

and/or during follow-ups. Seroconversion was defined as detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-

84

specific IgG antibodies in serum.

85

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay

86

All patients had been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR from the upper respiratory

87

tract (pooled nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) during acute phase of the infection. Nucleic

88

acid was extracted from clinical samples in a MagNA Pure 96 instrument using the Total

89

Nucleic Acid isolation kit (Roche). RT-PCR targeting the RdRP region was performed in a

90

QuantStudio 6 instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the primers and probe

91

described (12). Cycle threshold (Ct) values <38 were regarded as positive.

92

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific serum antibodies

93

Serum-IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed using two commercially available

94

serological assays: the qualitative Architect chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay

95

(Abbott Laboratories, USA), measuring IgG against SARS-CoV-2 N-protein, and the

96

quantitative iFlash 1800 chemiluminescent immunoassay (YHLO, China), which measures

97

IgG against both SARS-CoV-2 S- and N-proteins. All samples were analyzed using both

98

assays. IgG concentrations were obtained using the iFlash 1800 assay, and ≥10 AU/ml were

99

defined as positive. The time of seroconversion was defined as the time-point at which the

100
101

first positive serum-IgG result was observed.
RBD ELISA was performed as previously described (13) with some modification.

102

Briefly, plates were coated with 4µg/mL SARS-CoV2 RBD locally produced in 293F cells in

103

PBS and incubated overnight at 4°C. Blocking was done with 2% sterile filtered BSA in PBS

104

at RT. Plates were washed with PBS + 0.05% Tween and incubated with twofold serially

105

diluted sera, starting at 1:50. After washing, plates were incubated with secondary antibodies

106

diluted in PBS + 0.05% Tween: Goat Anti-Human IgG Fc-HRP (Southern Biotech

107

Associates, Birmingham, AL; 2048-05), Goat Anti-Human IgA-HRP (SouthernBiotech,

108

2050-05), Goat Anti-Human IgM-HRP (SouthernBiotech, 2020-05), all diluted 1:6000. Plates

109

were developed with 1-step Ultra TMB-ELISA (ThermoFisher, 34029), reaction stopped by

110

2M H2SO4 and read at 450nm. Ten sera obtained from volunteers prior to the COVID-19

111

outbreak were used for comparison.

112

Total concentrations of Ig A, G and M were determined using commercially available

113

reagents on the Alinity platform (Abbott Laboratories).

114

Flow cytometry

115

Blood was collected in EDTA Vacutainer tubes and was analyzed using Multitest 6-Color

116

TBNK reagent (337166) or anti-CD45-PerCP (345809)/anti-CD14-APC (345787) in

117

Trucount tubes (340334) according to normal procedures using FACSCanto II flow

118

cytometers (all from BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

119

SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing antibody assay

120

Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were determined after inactivation of the complement

121

in serum for 30 minutes at 56°C, by incubating 25µL of 2-fold dilutions (1/2 - 1/264) of each

122

serum in maintenance medium (MM) with 25 µL of 100TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 in duplicate

123

for two hours at 37°C. Thereafter the serum/virus mixture was added to confluent Vero cells

124

in 96 well microtiter plates with 175 µL MM and incubated at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. Ten-

125

fold serial dilutions of the virus, 10-1,000 TCID50, were added in duplicate. The plates were

126

examined daily, using an inverted microscope, and complete cytopathic effect (CPE) was

127

usually complete in the virus only control-wells after three days. CPE was then recorded in

128

the wells and the titer of the sera was calculated as previously described (14). Sera with

129

antibody titers ε4 were considered neutralizing.

130

Statistical analysis

131

Time to event analysis with interval censoring was used to compare time to seroconversion

132

between groups (15). Differences between groups were analyzed using Welch’s t-test and

133

longitudinal changes with paired t-test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

134

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc) and R

135

4.0.0.

SARS-CoV-2-specific serum-IgG antibodies in severe and mild COVID-19

139

Forty-seven patients provided a total of 156 serum samples (mean 3.3 per patient, range 1-7),

140

5-117 days PSO. Of the 47 patients, 15/47 (32%) had severe and 32/47 (68%) had mild

141

COVID-19 (Table 1). The patients with severe symptoms were older (mean age 58) and all

142

male, compared to patients with mild symptoms (mean age 45, 56% female).

143

All 15 patients with severe COVID-19 developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG

144

antibodies in serum, with seroconversion observed after median 11 (range 7–20) days (Fig.

145

1A). Of the patients with mild symptoms, 29/32 (91%) developed detectable IgG antibodies,

146

with seroconversion observed after median 22 (range 14–79) days (Fig. 1B). When

148

was still significantly shorter in patients with severe symptoms than in those with mild

149

symptoms (P=0.04). Furthermore, we found significantly higher concentrations of IgG

150

antibodies in patients with severe symptoms (mean 107 AU/ml) than in patients with mild

151

symptoms (mean 65 AU/ml) within 35 days PSO (Fig 1C). Within both groups, antibody

152

concentrations did not change significantly in patients >75 days, hence the differences

153

between the groups remained (though no longer significantly (P=0.235, Fig 1C) due to fewer

154

patients analyzed at this time-point).

155

Among patients with mild symptoms, 3/32 (9.4%) did not develop detectable IgG

156

antibodies as determined using the commercially available assays during the follow-up

157

period, 91–105 days PSO.

158
159

Analysis of patients without detectable IgG-responses

160

We assessed the three patients without detectable IgG-responses further (Table 2, Fig 2).

161

Lowest observed Ct values in the non-IgG patients were of a similar range as in the patients

162

who seroconverted (15.9–24.9 vs. 11.9–37.2). Flow cytometric analyses of peripheral blood

163

cells in two of the non-seroconverting patients available for additional testing (days 91 and

164

105 PSO) revealed no overt signs of immunodeficiency (Table 3). Total concentrations of

165

IgG, IgA and IgM isotypes in serum sampled at the same time-points were also within the

166

normal adult range, indicating no antibody deficiencies (Table 2).

173

3 patients had detectable NAb activity (Table 2), indicating that these patients had mounted a

174

functional humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2. To ascertain if the neutralizing

175

activity could be explained by low antibody levels against the RBD undetected by the

176

commercial assays, an in-house ELISA was used (Table 2, Fig 3). Indeed, the two patients

177

with highest levels of neutralization had measurable anti-RBD-IgG in the same samples

178

whilst the patient with low neutralizing activity lacked detectable anti-RBD-IgG (Table 2).

179

Compared to late serum samples (>75 days PSO, n=21) from patients with detectable anti-

180

SARS-CoV-2-IgG with mild and severe disease, these three patients had lower levels of anti-

181

RBD-IgG, IgA and IgM (Fig 3).

182
183

Discussion

184

In this study, we describe IgG antibody responses in 47 patients during and after severe and

185

mild COVID-19. Patients with severe disease seroconverted earlier and had higher maximum

186

concentrations of anti-viral IgG than those with mild disease. Whilst all of the patients with

187

severe symptoms seroconverted, three (9%) of the 32 patients with mild disease failed to

188

produce levels of IgG detectable with commercial assays, even more than 90 days PSO.

189

However, NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in all of these three patients.

190

Our results confirm previous findings that clinical severity of disease is associated

191

with higher SARS-CoV-2-specific serum-IgG antibodies (16–19). Studies comparing time to

192

seroconversion between these groups are still lacking and we show that clinical severity is

193

also associated with significantly earlier seroconversion. Due to the long follow-up period of

194

this study, we were also able to observe that all seroconverted patients with both mild and

195

severe symptoms still have detectable IgG levels after more than 75 days. A recently

196

published study reported that 97% of 37 patients with mild COVID-19 had decreased levels

197

of IgG 2-3 months POS (20). In contrast, our study shows that several patients with both mild

198

and severe symptoms had increased in IgG concentrations over time. Of note, all of the

199

patients in the severe group in this study were male. In a study comparing serum-IgG

200

responses between the sexes, no significant differences were found between women and men

201

with severe COVID-19 (21), suggesting that the differences in proportions of males within the

202

groups are unlikely to explain the concentration differences.

203

In this study, we found that almost 10% of patients with mild COVID-19 did not

204

develop detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum as evaluated by assays used in clinical

205

practice. Previous studies have similarly failed to detect IgG antibodies in patients with mild

206

disease (22,23), but due to short follow-up (less than 25–50 days) no conclusions regarding

207

the proportion of patients who do not seroconvert have been made in the belief that antibody

208

levels become detectable later in time. We show that despite 90 days or more PSO, not all

209

patients develop detectable levels of IgG in these assays. However, using a virus

210

neutralization assay, considered the golden standard of serology testing, all patients with

211

undetectable IgG using commercial methods had NAbs. Furthermore, when using an in-house

212

RBD ELISA, the two patients with highest levels of NAbs also had detectable anti-RBD-IgG.

213

Several other studies have seen a correlation between the magnitudes of NAbs and IgG

214

against viral S-protein epitopes (10,24). These results suggest that 100% of patients had in

215

fact seroconverted, compared to 91% detected when using commercial methods.

216

While none of the patients with undetectable IgG using the commercial assays had

217

anti-RBD-IgA, interestingly, the patients with detectable IgG also had detectable anti-RBD-

218

IgA >75 days PSO, with no difference in levels between mild and severe cases. Other studies

219

have found serum-IgA after mild COVID-19 to be transient and undetectable after only one

220

month post recovery (16,25), again highlighting the sensitivity of our in-house RBD-ELISA.

221

It is unsurprising that the validated SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays used in clinical practice

222

miss a proportion of positive samples which other assays may detect. In these situations, the

223

balance between assay sensitivity and specificity must be weighted to reduce the risk of false

224

positives. This study demonstrates the risk of false negatives, in which low serum antibody

225

levels may be detected with more sensitive assays.

226

We acknowledge several limitations in this study. The number and timing of serum

227

sampling differed between patients; detectable IgG may have occurred before sampling,

228

meaning that the exact timing of seroconversion is uncertain. Also, a larger proportion of

229

patients in the mild group than the severe group have been available for late follow-up

230

sampling.

231
232

Conclusions

233

We show that patients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higher

234

concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. That not all

235

COVID-19 patients develop detectable levels of IgG using two validated commercial

236

methods, even over time, are vital for the interpretation of COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys

237

and estimating the true prevalence in populations.
