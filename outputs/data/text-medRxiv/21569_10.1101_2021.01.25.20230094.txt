Abstract
Designing public health responses to outbreaks requires close monitoring of population-level
health indicators in real-time. Thus, an accurate estimation of the epidemic curve is critical.
We propose an approach to reconstruct epidemic curves in near real time. We apply this
approach to characterize the early SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in two Spanish regions between
March and April 2020.
We address two data collection problems that affected the reliability of the available real-time
epidemiological data, namely, the frequent missing information documenting when a patient
first experienced symptoms, and the frequent retrospective revision of historical information
(including right censoring). This is done by using a novel back-calculating procedure based
on imputing patients‚Äô dates of symptom onset from reported cases, according to a
dynamically-estimated ‚Äúbackward‚Äù reporting delay conditional distribution, and adjusting for
right censoring using an existing package, NobBS, to estimate in real time (nowcast) cases
by date of symptom onset. This process allows us to obtain an approximation of the timevarying reproduction number (ùëÖùë° ) in real-time.
At each step, we evaluate how different assumptions affect the recovered epidemiological
events and compare the proposed approach to the alternative procedure of merely using
curves of case counts, by report day, to characterize the time-evolution of the outbreak.
Finally, we assess how these real-time estimates compare with subsequently documented
epidemiological information that is considered more reliable and complete that became
available later in time. Our approach may help improve accuracy, quantify uncertainty, and
evaluate frequently unstated assumptions when recovering the epidemic curves from limited
data obtained from public health surveillance systems in other locations.

Introduction
Assessing the effectiveness of ongoing interventions during outbreaks requires a real-time
characterization of new infections. Epidemic curves, a monitoring tool frequently proposed to
characterize the dynamics of an outbreak, capture the number of individuals infected over
time. Reconstructing these curves appropriately is challenging for novel pathogens because
testing protocols and surveillance systems may not be repurposed quickly enough.
Ideally, epidemic curves should document new infections based on the date of exposure to
the infectious agent for each individual [1]. Because information on the date of exposure for
each patient is usually unavailable, epidemic curves are often reconstructed based on the
first detectable clinical event: onset of symptoms.
In practice, however, detected cases are rarely documented at onset of symptoms. Rather,
surveillance procedures tend to rely on confirmed diagnoses, which are typically reported
with a delay of days or weeks after symptoms onset [2‚Äì4]. As a result, the number of cases
based on the onset of symptoms in any given day is unknown until those cases are reported
days or weeks later. This problem is sometimes referred to as ‚Äúbackfill bias‚Äù, a term from
economics [5] that was later applied to infectious disease tracking [6,7].
Reporting delays complicate timely decision-making [8]. Further, similar populations with
different notification procedures may have different reporting delays [9] and the distribution
of delays may change over time [10,11]. One way to address the problem of delayed
notification is to statistically predict the number of cases with onset of symptoms today
based on historical observations of how the number of cases on a given day were later
revised to reflect updated information. This methodology is referred to as ‚Äúnowcasting‚Äù
[6,10]. A recently proposed approach to nowcasting, NobBS or Nowcasting by Bayesian
Smoothing [10], complements the estimated delay distribution and historical data with the
intrinsic autocorrelation from the transmission process. NobBS has been shown to perform
better than previous nowcasting methods for different infectious diseases [10].
Nowcasting requires that the date of symptom onset is collected for all cases that are
eventually reported. However, real-time surveillance systems cannot guarantee the
ascertainment of the date of the clinical event for all reported cases, even if all cases are
reported. Therefore, nowcasting the epidemic curve based on symptoms onset requires
imputation of the missing dates of symptoms onset.
The nowcast epidemic curve can then be used to estimate the time-varying reproductive
number, that is, the number of secondary infections arising from a single infection on a
particular day [12,13]. The estimation of the reproductive number requires also parametric
assumptions on the generation interval (the time between a primary and a secondary
infection).
Here, we present a three-step approach using existing computational tools to estimate in
near-real time the epidemic curve and the time-varying reproductive number (ùëÖùë° ) in the
presence of reporting delays and incomplete data on the date of onset of symptoms. First,
we impute the missing date of onset of symptoms data using historical distributions derived
from reported line-list data. Second, we use NobBS to estimate case counts up to the
present while adjusting for reporting delays. Third, we estimate the time-varying reproductive
number using the nowcasted epidemic curve. We apply the approach to data reported during
the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in two regions of Spain.

Methods
Surveillance data
We applied our methodology to Madrid and Murcia, two regions of Spain with very different
characteristics. Madrid has 6.7 million residents, is highly interconnected both nationally and
internationally, has the highest population density and urbanicity of the country, is situated in
the geographic (inland) center, and had a seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 of 11.5% at the
end of the study period [14]. Murcia has 1.4 million residents, average connectivity,
population density and urbanicity, is geographically situated in the coastal periphery and had
a seroprevalence of 1.6% at the end of the study period.
Each region reported daily counts of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases to the Spanish
Ministry of Health [15]. We also obtained individualized data on date of report (DOR) and, for
a proportion of cases, the date of symptoms onset (DOS) from the Spanish System for
Surveillance at the National Center of Epidemiology (RENAVE) through the Web platform
SiViEs (System for Surveillance in Spain) [16].
We conducted the analyses in each region using cumulative data available at three
overlapping periods in the outbreak: early analysis period when reported cases reached
maximum counts (spanning March 1-March 27), intermediate analysis period shortly after
the peak of the epidemic curve (March 1-April 9), and late analysis period when the epidemic
curve was close to zero (March 1-April 16). All analyses were implemented in R.
Step 1: Imputation of missing data
We imputed the missing DOS by randomly assigning values drawn from the distribution of
reporting delay (the period between DOS and DOR) in individuals with known DOS. Of note,
the reporting delay distribution conditional on the DOR is different from both the
unconditional delay distribution (the distribution of all reporting delays) and the ‚Äúforward‚Äù
delay distribution conditional on the DOS (if my DOS is today, how long do I wait until
DOR?). Inferring reporting delays from the unconditional delay distribution or the "forward"
delay distribution conditional on the DOS is known to generate biased reconstructed
epidemic curves [17] .
We assumed that missing DOS occur at random within region ùëñ and report date ùë° and that
reporting delays conditional on DOR can be modeled as a negative binomial with mean
parameter ùúáùëñ,ùë° and dispersion parameter ùúÉùëñ using maximum likelihood [9]. We resampled 100
times to generate 100 time series of cases with complete DOS-DOR for each region ùëñ. The
sum of the observed and imputed cases became the total cases used for nowcasting.
In sensitivity analyses, we first evaluated the main procedure after: a) masking DOS (hiding
original data as missing values) in a random 10% of reported cases, b) masking DOS in a
random 40% of reported cases, and c) masking DOS in a random 40% of cases as in b),
then simply subtracting the observed mean delay to the reported date, resulting in the same
imputed day for all cases reported at any given t [17].
Step 2: Nowcasting the epidemic curve
After imputation, all reported cases have a DOS. However, a number of cases with DOS
before day t will be reported after day t. We therefore used NobBS [10] to nowcast the
number of yet unreported cases with DOS at t that would be eventually reported under the

assumption that the delay conditional on DOS occurs as a negative binomial process.
Briefly, NobBS uses historical information on the reporting delay to predict the number of
not-yet-reported cases in the present using a log-linear model of the number of cases. The
implementation of NobBS requires the specification of 1) a sliding window for the timevarying reporting delay, 2) a maximum delay allowed for the window, and 3) a prior
distribution on the expected mean as a function of the ‚Äútrue‚Äù epidemiological signal (here, the
number of new cases with onset of symptoms) ùõºùë° and the probability of delay ùõΩùëë . We used a
moving window that represented 75% of the total period of analysis and a uniform prior
distribution for the parameters ùõºùë° and ùõΩùëë . The NobBS method can be implemented in R
using the NobBs package (v1.2), which compiles in JAGS using the rjags package (v4.10).
To assess uncertainty in the estimation, we produced a nowcast series with 10,000 posterior
samples for each time point of the 100 imputed case count series in each region. We then
pooled the samples and calculated the nowcast median and 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles for
each day, following the recommendation of Zhou and Reiter [18].
In sensitivity analyses, we varied the length of the window using the period comprising 50%
or 99% of the last date of report delays, and we generated nowcasts using the alternative
model proposed in sensitivity Step 1c (using cases by report day and backshift by the mean
reporting delay).
Step 3: Estimation of time-varying reproductive number ùëÖùë°
We estimated the time-varying reproduction number ùëÖùë° using two approaches implemented
in the R package epiEstim (v2.2.1): Wallinga and Teunis [13,19]) (WT) and Cori et al. (C)
[13,19]. We used the nowcast estimates and a mean generation interval (the time between a
primary and a secondary case infection) of 5 days with a standard deviation of 1.9 [20]. We
computed ùëÖùë° from the 10,000 NobBS samples to produce the mean and 95% credibility
interval of the ùëÖùë° (for computational ease, we used a random sample of size 100 from the
10,000 samples since results did not materially change with a greater sample). Because WT
and C use different forward and backward-looking computational approaches, respectively, a
relative delay approximating the mean generation interval of WT relative to C is to be
expected [17].
In sensitivity analyses, we used a significantly longer generation interval (mean=7.5,
SD=3.5) [21], and also used an epidemic curve generated using observed cases by DOR
backshifted by the mean reported delay.

Results
Imputation of missing data
The proportion of missing DOS among reported cases varied by region and epidemic phase.
In Madrid, the percentage of missingness was 53% of 32,723 reported cases in the early
analysis period, 37% of 50,745 in the intermediate analysis period, and 16% of 56,057 in the
late analysis period. The corresponding numbers in Murcia were 25% of 831, 23% of 1433,
and 11% of 1602. The distribution of the reporting delay was also region-specific and
changed over time (Supplementary material, Figure S1).

The first row of Figure 1 for each region shows the weekly counts of cases by DOR with
observed and missing DOS. The second row of Figure 1 shows the epidemic curve by DOS
after the median of imputed cases (grey) was added to the observed cases with available
DOS (blue). As expected, the uncertainty of the imputation increases with the proportion of
missingness (Supplementary material, Figure S2).
Nowcasting the epidemic curve
The second row of Figure 1 shows the epidemiologic curve after nowcasting (yellow line).
Nowcasting reconstructed the epidemic curve more reliably than unadjusted case counts,
either by DOR or DOS, even in earlier phases. This is more easily seen in Figure 2:
nowcasted case counts in the intermediate period represent more accurately those
estimated in the latest period, either compared with the curve of raw observed (not missing)
case counts (B and E) or the curve modeled by mean backshift (C and F). However, in the
early period of analysis for Madrid, with a high proportion of missing data, nowcasting
overestimated those observed later in time.
Nowcast curves are smoother than curves of case counts by report date because of removal
of noise related to the reporting process (such as weekday dependency). Also, the peak of
case counts by symptom onset was several days earlier in the nowcast curves (around
March 16 in both regions) than in the curves of reported cases (around March 25-26). The
nowcasted peak is more consistent with the implementation of the country-wide lockdown by
March 15 [22] (see Discussion). The uncertainty in the nowcast increases with uncertainty in
the imputation of DOS, as can be seen in the large uncertainty band in the early analysis in
Madrid.
The nowcast curves were relatively robust to missingness and different parameterizations of
the NobBS function, such as window of analysis. However, the time of peak of case-counts
can significantly vary with data availability and assumptions (Supplementary material, Figure
S2).
Estimation of the time-varying reproductive number
The third row of Figure 1 shows the Rt estimates using the nowcasted curve and including
uncertainty from previous steps. The precision of Rt increased over time when more
information became available, as seen in the third row of Figure 1 for both regions.
Estimates using nowcasted curves show an earlier reduction of Rt than those obtained from
raw case counts by DOR (Supplementary material, Figure S5) which mirrors the difference
between the nowcasted curve, and the observed curve of case counts by report date.
Though the WT and C approaches had similar trajectories, WT reached lower values earlier,
with a delay between them approximating the generation interval (5 +/- 1.9 days), the
rationale being described previously [17]. This led to a consistent 4-6 days difference in the
median estimated time for Rt becoming <1, which can be seen in Figure 1 lower row for both
regions. The validity of Rt estimates, especially using the WT method, appeared to decrease
towards the latest dates.

Discussion
We proposed a three-step approach to characterize an outbreak in near real-time by
adjusting for incomplete data and reporting delays. We applied this approach to the early
SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in two regions of Spain. Our findings showed that a country-wide
lockdown control led to a substantial decline in cases shortly thereafter, around March 14-20
in Madrid and around March 16-21 in Murcia. In contrast, a na√Øve approach based on

reported cases detected the decline in cases 10 days after the lockdown in Madrid and 8
after the lockdown in Murcia.
The Rt estimates obtained from nowcasted case counts were more consistent with true
transmission (as documented using complete data that became available after the study
period). For example, heterogeneity by day-of-the-week was more prominent in reported
case counts than in our reconstructions for Madrid, and the expected differences between
Cori‚Äôs and WT‚Äôs due to the generation interval were observed for the nowcast but not when
using reported case counts day in Murcia [17].
Our approach has several limitations. First, its validity relies on the assumption that the date
of symptoms onset is missing at random and that the available historical data were sufficient
to parameterize the unknown reporting delay. However, our sensitivity analyses indicate that
the overall trajectory of the epidemic curve was relatively robust to small departures from
these assumptions. Second, our approach underperforms well when little information is
available for training the nowcasting algorithm, including good estimates of the reporting
delay distribution. Our estimates were sensitive to the choice of imputation and nowcasting
procedures when the date of symptoms onset was unknown for a high percentage of
confirmed cases. Third, our approach requires that underdetection/underreporting of cases
does not change significantly over time; otherwise would adversely affect the estimates [23].
Finally, our estimates could be improved by reconstructing the epidemic curve by the date of
infection rather than that of symptoms onset, though this would require more complex
methods given that the temporal delay from infection to symptom onset is much harder to
characterize [17,24‚Äì27].
Development of ready-to-use tools for epidemic dynamics modelling help surveillance
services to appropriately present data for efficient epidemic control, but understanding the
limitations of the procedure and the impact of prespecified assumptions is critical for
interpretation. We believe that the contribution of our approach is twofold. First, we provide a
systematic analysis on the assumptions and implementation procedures frequently used to
characterize emerging outbreaks. Second, we propose a disease surveillance framework
that acknowledges and adjusts for biases arising from real-world observational challenges,
and is capable of providing objective, quantifiable, and systematic information, to aid the
decision-making process in real-time outbreak mitigation efforts.

Backshift vs late nowcast

Showing nowcast estimates (orange) in Madrid and Murcia for the early (A and D) and
intermediate (B and E) period analysis, observed cases with known date of onset of
symptoms for the same period (blue columns), and for comparison with more complete data,
those estimated in the late period of analysis (dashed grey line and ribbon); C and F
showing cases by date of report back shifted by the mean delay (red line) together with
nowcast estimates for the late period analysis and observed cases with known date of onset
of symptoms (shadowed blue columns). DOS: date of onset of symptoms; DOR: date of
report; Lines are median estimates, ribbons span 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles.
