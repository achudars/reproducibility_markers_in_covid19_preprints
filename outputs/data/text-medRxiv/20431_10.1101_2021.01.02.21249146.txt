Abstract
Background
School closures are associated with significant negative consequences and exacerbate inequalities. They were
implemented worldwide to control SARS-CoV-2 in the first half of 2020, but their effectiveness, and the effects
of lifting them, remain uncertain. This review summarises observational evidence of the effect of school
closures and school reopenings on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission.

Methods
The study protocol was registered on Prospero (ID:CRD42020213699). On 07 January 2021 we searched
PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, the WHO Global COVID-19 Research Database, ERIC, the British
Education Index, the Australian Education Index, and Google. We included observational studies with
quantitative estimates of the effect of school closures/reopenings on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission.
We excluded prospective modelling studies and intra-school transmission studies. We performed a narrative
synthesis due to data heterogeneity. We used the ROBINS-I tool to assess risk of bias.

Findings
We identified 7,474 articles, of which 40 were included, with data from 150 countries. Of these 32 studies
assessed school closures, and 11 examined reopenings. There was substantial heterogeneity between school
closure studies, with half of the studies at lower risk of bias reporting reduced community transmission by up
to 60%, and half reporting null findings. The majority (n=3 out of 4) of school reopening studies at lower risk of
bias reported no associated increases in transmission.

Conclusions
School closure studies were at risk of confounding and collinearity from other non-pharmacological
interventions implemented around the same time as school closures, and the effectiveness of closures remains
uncertain. School reopenings, in areas of low transmission and with appropriate mitigation measures, were
generally not accompanied by increasing community transmission. With such varied evidence on effectiveness,
and the harmful effects, policymakers should take a measured approach before implementing school closures;
and should look to reopen schools in times of low transmission, with appropriate mitigation measures.

Introduction
School closures have been a common strategy to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19
pandemic. By 2 April 2020, 172 nations had enacted full closures or partial ‘dismissals’, affecting nearly 1·5
billion children(1). As cases of COVID-19 started to fall, many countries looked to reopen schools, often with
significant mitigation measures in place(2). Over the northern hemisphere winter of 2020-21, many countries
again closed schools with the aim of controlling a second pandemic wave. School closures have substantial
negative consequences for children’s wellbeing and education, which will impact on life chances and long-term
health(3,4). Closures exacerbate existing inequalities, with greater impacts upon more deprived children
because those from higher income families have better opportunities for remote learning.

The role of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) collectively in limiting community spread is established.
However, the specific contribution of school closures remains unclear. Observational studies suggest that
school-aged children, particularly teenagers, play a role in transmission to peers and bringing infection into
households(5), although the relative importance compared to adults remains unclear(6). Younger children
appear less susceptible to infection and may play a smaller role in community transmission, compared with
older children and adults(7). Although some modelling studies have suggested that school closures can reduce
SARS-CoV-2 community transmission(8), others disagree(9,10).

A rapid systematic review published in April 2020 found a small number of studies of the effectiveness of
school closures in controlling the spread of coronaviruses(11). However, this review was undertaken very early
in the pandemic and included no observational data on SARS-CoV-2. Since then many studies on the effects of
closing or re-opening schools on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission have been published, but there has
been no systematic review of these studies. A clearer understanding of the impact of school closures and
reopenings on community transmission is essential to aid policymakers in deciding if and when to implement
school closures in response to rising virus prevalence, and when it is prudent to reopen schools. Here, we

synthesise the observational evidence of the impact of closing or reopening schools on community
transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Methods
The study protocol for this systematic review is registered on Prospero (ID:CRD42020213699).

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
We included any empirical study which reported a quantitative estimate of the effect of school closure or
reopening on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We considered ‘school’ to include early years settings
(e.g. nurseries or kindergartens), primary schools, and secondary school, but excluded further or higher
education (e.g. universities). Community transmission was defined as any measure of community infections
rate, hospital admissions, or mortality attributed to COVID-19. We included studies published in 2020 or 2021
only. We included pre-prints, peer-reviewed and grey literature. We did not apply any restriction on language,
but all searches were undertaken in English. We excluded prospective modelling studies and studies in which
the assessed outcome was exclusively transmission within the school environment rather than the wider
community.

Search strategy
We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, the WHO Global COVID-19 Research Database
(including medRxiv and SSRN), ERIC, the British Education Index, and the Australian Education Index, searching
title and abstracts for terms related to SARS-CoV-2 AND terms related to schools or NPIs. To search the grey
literature, we searched Google. We also included papers identified through professional networks. Full details
of the search strategy are included in Appendix A. Searches were undertaken first on 12 October 2020 and
updated on 07 January 2021.

Data extraction and risk of bias assessment
Article titles and abstracts were imported into the Rayyan QCRI webtool(12). Two reviewers independently
screened titles and abstracts, retrieved full texts of potentially relevant articles, and assessed eligibility for
inclusion.

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Data extraction was performed using a
pre-agreed extraction template which collected information on publication type (peer-reviewed or pre-print),
country, study design, exposure type (school closure or reopening), setting type (primary or secondary), study
period, unit of observation, confounders adjusted for, other NPIs in place, analysis method, outcome measure,
and findings. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I)
tool(13) to evaluate bias.

Discrepancies were resolved by discussion in the first instance and by a third reviewer where necessary.

Data synthesis
Given the heterogeneous nature of the studies, prohibiting meta-analysis, a narrative synthesis was
conducted. Schools often reopened with significant COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures in
place, meaning that the effect of lifting restrictions may have been different from the effect of imposing them.
We therefore considered the studies of school closures and school reopenings separately. We also aimed to
evaluate differential effects for primary and secondary schools if data allowed.

Results
We identified 7,474 studies (Figure 1). After removing 2,339 duplicates, 5,135 unique records were screened
for inclusion. We excluded 4,842 records at the title or abstract stage, leaving 293 records for full text review.
Of these, 40(14–53) met the inclusion criteria.

Description of studies
Included studies are described in Table 1, grouped by exposure type and study design. Of these, 32
studies(14,15,18–21,23,24,26,29–40,42–44,46–53) reported the effect of school closures on community
transmission of SARS-CoV-2, 11(16,22–25,27,28,35,43–45) examined school reopening, and 3(16,17,41)
investigated the effect of school holidays. Some studies considered more than one exposure. All studies used
data from national Government sources or international data repositories. A total of 15 studies were from
peer reviewed journals, whilst 24 studies were from pre-print servers, and one study was a conference
abstract.

All studies were ecological in nature, i.e. the unit of analysis was national or regional. Of the school closure
studies, 13 reported data from a single country or region (the USA (n=10)(14,19–21,33,37,42,47–49), Italy
(n=1)(23), Japan (n=1)(29), and Switzerland (n=1)(43)); four reported discrete estimates for several
countries(26,38,44,53); and 15 studies pooled data from multiple countries (globally (n=8)(31,34–
36,39,46,50,51), Europe only (n=2)(24,30), Europe and other high income countries (n=5)(15,18,32,40,52)). The
studies on school reopening generally reported on single countries (Germany (n=2)(22,28), USA (n=1)(25),
Switzerland (n=1)(43), Belgium (n=1)(27), Israel (n=1)(45), Italy (n=1)(23)), but one reported discrete estimates
for three countries (Denamrk, Germany and Norway)(44), two pooled data from multiple countries
globally(16,35), and one pooled data from multiple European countries(24). Of the three school holiday
studies, one reported on Germany(41), one pooled data from 24 countries globally(16), and one pooled data
from multiple European countries(17).

The majority of studies (n=24) did not specify the type of school setting being studied. However, eight studies
specified that they were reporting on primary and secondary schools only(14,16,18,19,27,29,37,49), and six
additionally include early years settings(22–24,44,45,48). The two remaining studies used the date of primary
school (n=1)(15) or secondary school (n=1)(43) closure as their exposure date, but did not indicate this was
temporally distinct from closure of the other setting. Very few studies reported independent effect sizes for
different setting types: two closure studies(24,48) and four reopening studies(16,22,24,44).

Studies that specifically sought to estimate an effect of school closure policy on SARS-CoV-2 transmission
included eight school closure studies(14,23,29,32,37,38,42,44), six school reopening
studies(22,23,25,28,44,45), and three school holiday studies. The remaining studies primarily sought to
estimate the effect of NPIs (but reported an independent estimate for schools, alongside estimates for other
NPIs within their analysis).

The studies utilised different analytic approaches: regression models (n=24)(14,17,19–
21,25,26,28,30,31,33,35,36,39–42,44,46,48,49,51–53), Bayesian modelling (n=3)(15,18,47), comparison to a
synthetic control group (n=4)(24,34,38,44), machine learning approaches (n=2)(43,50), time series analysis
(n=1)(29), and visual representation of changes in transmission over time compared against the timing of
school policy interventions, with or without formal statistical analysis (n=4)(16,22,37,45). We identified three
study designs used to estimate the effect of school closures: pooled multiple-area before-after comparisons
(n=22)(14,15,18–21,24,26,30,32–36,39,40,42,46–50), within-area before-after
comparisons(n=7)(23,29,37,38,43,44,53), and pooled multiple-area comparisons of interventions in place at a
fixed time point (n=3)(31,51,52).

In most instances of school closures, particularly in European countries, other NPIs were introduced at or
around the same time. Some studies dealt with this at the design stage, choosing to study places where school

closures were done in (relative) isolation(37) and some at the analytical stage (typically by undertaking
regression and having multiple comparator countries). Some studies did not appear to have a mechanism in
place to deal with this potential confounding(32,40,44,52). Studies which pooled data from multiple areas also
adjusted for other potential confounders, such as population factors (e.g. proportion of population aged 65,
population density) and SARS-CoV-2 testing regimes.

Among school closure studies, 18 studies(14,15,19,20,24,26,29,31–34,37,39,42–44,50,51) reported effects on
incidence, 11(14,19,21,30,38–40,42,46,52,53) on mortality, one(37) on hospital admissioins and mortality, and
eight(18,21,23,35,36,43,47,48) on an estimate of the effective Reproductive number (R) (derived from
incidence and/or mortality data). Of the school reopening studies, six reported effects on
incidence(16,22,24,28,44,45), two on hospitalisations(25,44), and four on R(23,27,35,43). Two school holiday
studies reported an effect on incidence(16,41), while the other reported on mortality(17). The assumed lag
period from school policy changes to changes in incidence rate varied between seven and 20 days, with longer
time periods of 26 to 28 days generally assumed for mortality.

Risk of bias is summarised in Table 2. Of the school closure studies, 14 were found to be at moderate risk of
bias(14,15,18–20,24,26,30,35–37,46–48), 14 at serious risk(21,23,29,31,33,34,38,39,42,43,49–51,53), and four
at critical risk of bias(32,40,44,52). Of the school reopening studies, four were found to be at moderate
risk(24,25,28,35), four at serious risk(23,27,43,44), and three at critical risk of bias(16,22,45). The school
holiday studies were found to be at moderate (n=1)(41), serious (n=1)(17), or critical (n=1)(16) risk of bias.

There was significant heterogeneity in the study findings (table 3): 17 studies(14,24,31,32,34–38,40,42–44,48–
51) reported that closing schools was associated with a reduction in transmission rates; nine
(15,18,20,23,26,29,30,39,47) found no association between school closures and transmission; five
(19,21,33,46,53) reported mixed findings with evidence of a reduction in transmission in some analyses but
not others; and one study(52) reported that school closures were associated with an increase in mortality. The

reported effect size of closing schools ranged from precise estimates of no effect(26) to approximately halving
the incidence(14); and from approximately doubling mortality(52), to approximately halving mortality(14). The
studies at the highest risk of bias generally reported large reductions in transmission associated with school
closures, while studies at lower levels of bias reported more variable findings (figure 2). Of the school
reopening studies, six(22–25,28,44) reported no increase in transmission associated with reopening of schools,
while two(16,43) reported mixed findings, and three(27,35,45) reported increases in transmission. Of the four
school reopening studies at lowest risk of bias(24,25,28,35), three(24,25,28) reported no association between
school reopenings and transmission.

Narrative Synthesis of Findings
School Closures
Pooled multiple-area before-after comparisons
We identified 22 studies(14,15,18–21,24,26,30,32–36,39,40,42,46–50) that analysed before-after data on
multiple geographical units, and then pooled the results into one unified estimate of effect (generally by using
regression analysis). These studies relied upon different timings of NPI implementation in different areas to
establish their independent effects, and were therefore at risk of collinearity if compared areas implemented
the same NPIs at similar times. These studies were also at risk of bias from sociocultural differences between
compared areas.

Of these studies, 11(14,24,32,34–36,40,42,48–50) reported that school closures were associated with
significantly reduced community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, seven(15,18,20,26,30,39,47) reported no
association, and four(19,21,33,46) reported mixed findings. Those studies found to be at higher risk of bias,
generally because they were judged not to have adjusted appropriately for NPIs, testing, or sociodemographic
data, tended to report reductions in transmission; whereas those studies at lower risk of bias were as likely to
report null effects as they were reductions (see figure 2).

Of the three studies(20)using this approach which were considered to be at the lowest risk of confounding,
two reported no association and one reported that school closures reduced transmission. Courtemanche et
al.(20) used a fixed effects model (to account for inter-area sociodemographic differences) in an event study
design to estimate the effect of NPIs (including school closures) on SARS-CoV-2 incidence in US counties
between March and April 2020. They adjusted for relevant NPIs, testing regime confounders, and underlying
trends in each counties’ growth rates, and reported a null effect of school closures on growth rate, applying a
lag of either 10 or 20 days. Hsiang et al.(26) used a reduced form of econometric regression to compare
changes in incidence in French regions, Italian regions, and US states (in three separate analyses) before and
after NPI implementation (including school closures) until early April 2020. Other key NPIs and testing regimes
were adjusted for. The authors report a null effect of school closures on growth rate of SARS-CoV-2 incidence,
with narrow confidence intervals for France and the USA, but a regression coefficient suggestive of a nonsignificant preventative effect in Italy (-0·11 (95% CI -0·25, 0·03)). Li et al.(54), used the’EpiForecast’ model of
R(54) to estimate the effectiveness of different NPIs (including school closures) over time in 131 countries
between January and June 2020. They identified time periods in which the NPIs in a given country were static,
and calculated the ‘R ratio’ by dividing the average daily R of each period by the R from the last day of the
previous period. They reported pooled estimates, regressed across all countries, for the first 28 days after
introduction/relaxation of each NPI. Though the confidence intervals for each daily effect size included 1, the
trend was clearly towards a reduction in transmission following school closure implementation.

Within-area before-after comparisons
We identified seven studies(23,29,37,38,43,44,53) that compared community transmission of SARS-CoV-2
before and after school closure for single geographical units, and did not pool the results with those of other
areas. This approach controls for confounding from population sociodemographic factors, but remains
vulnerable to confounding from other NPIs and temporal changes to testing regimes. As with the pooled
before-after comparison studies, those studies at higher risk of bias from confounding were more likely to
report reductions in transmission associated with school closures.

One study using this approach was found to be at moderate risk of bas. Matzinger et al.(37) identified the
three US states which introduced school closures first, and with a sufficient lag before implementing other
measures to assess their specific impact. They plotted incidence rates on a log2 scale and identified points of
inflexion in the period after school closure. This assumes exponential growth in the absence of interventions,
which may not have occurred given changes to testing regimes. The doubling time of new cases in Georgia
slowed from 2·1 to 3·4 days one week after closing schools. Similar results were observed in Tennessee (2·0 to
4·2 days after one week) and Mississippi (1·4 to 3·4 days after two weeks). The authors also noted inflexion
points for hospitalisations and mortality at later time points, although numerical changes were not reported.
Tennessee showed a slowing in hospitalisations one week after cases, and mortality one week after
hospitalisation. Mississippi showed a slowing in hospitalisations and mortality at the same time, one week
after cases – the authors do not comment on this discrepancy. Georgia lacked early hospitalisation data to
make such a comparison.

Pooled multiple-area comparisons of interventions in place at a fixed time point
Three studies(31,51,52) considered countries from around the world using a design in which NPIs were
considered as binary variables on a specific date (i.e. in place or not in place), and the cumulative incidence or
mortality to that point was compared to the number of new cases of COVID-19 over a subsequent follow-up
period; countries were then compared using regression analysis to elicit independent effect sizes for individual
policies including school closures. This approach reduces bias from different testing regimes over time and
between countries. However, the use of a single cut-off date for whether school closure was in place means
that that the effects of longer-standing and recent school closures were pooled, introducing misclassification
bias. Two of these studies(31,51) were at serious risk of bias and reported that school closures were associated
with lower incidence; and one study(52) was at critical risk of bias and reported that closing schools was not
associated with incidence but was associated with increased mortality. Each of these studies was at high risk of
confounding from other NPIs, in addition to the risk of misclassification bias described above.

School Reopening Studies
Eleven studies(16,22–25,27,28,35,43–45) considered the effect of school reopening on subsequent SARS-CoV2 community transmission(24). Of these, five were pooled multiple-area before-after comparison
studies(24,25,28,35,43), and six were within-area multiple-area before-after comparison
studies(16,22,23,27,44,45). These studies benefited from more staggered lifting of restrictions (compared to
their implementation), and more stable testing regimes.

Of the four studies at a lower risk of bias(24,25,28,35), three(24,25,28) reported that schools were reopened
without associated increases in transmission, whilst one(35) reported increased transmission. Garchitorena et
al.(24) compared incidence data, with adjustment for underdetection, from 32 European countries, using
multivariate linear regression models with adjustment for other NPIs and fixed effects to account for intercountry sociodemographic differences. They reported no association with incidence rates up to 16/09/20 of
reopening early years settings (0% mean change in incidence rate (95% CI -8%, 8%)), primary schools (2% (-7%,
10%)), or secondary schools (-1% (-7%, 9%)). Harris et al.(25) estimated the effect of school reopenings on
COVID-19 hospitalisation in the USA using an event study model, with analysis at the county-level. They
adjusted for other NPIs, and used fixed effects to account for calendar week effects and inter-county
differences. They applied a one week lag period, and compared data from ten weeks before, to six weeks after
school reopenings. They initially report null effects when pooling the effects across all counties, however, posthoc sensitivity analyses suggested that there were increases in hospitalisations for counties that were in the
top 25% of baseline hospitalisation rate at school reopening (compared to null effects for the bottom 75%).
Isphording et al.(28) compared changes to the COVID-19 incidence rate in German counties that were first to
reopen schools after the summer holidays, with those yet to reopen (noting that the timing of such decisions
was set years in advance, and not changed due to the pandemic). They considered data from two weeks
before to three weeks after school reopenings, and adjusted for mobility data, and used fixed effects to
account for inter-county sociodemographic differences. They reported no association between school
reopenings and incidence. One study, by You Li et al.(35), is described above as it reports on the effect of both

individual day in the 28-day period post-school reopenings were not always statistically significant, but the
data trend is clearly that of an increase in transmission associated with school reopenings.

The seven studies(16,22,23,27,43–45) at serious and critical risk of confounding are more difficult to interpret,
again predominantly due to the high risk of confounding. Three(16,23,44) reported no association between
school reopening and transmission, two(22,43) reported mixed findings, and two(27,45) reported increased
transmission following reopening of schools.

School Holiday Studies
Three studies(16,17,41) reported changes in SARS-CoV-2 community transmission associated with school
holidays. These holidays occurred according to pre-determined timetables and are therefore unlikely to be
influenced by background trends in infections. Two studies examined associations between timing of summer
holidays on incidence rates in Germany(41) and in multiple European countries(16), respectively. The other
study(17) reported on the timing of the February/March 2020 half-term break timing in countries that
neighbour the Alps. Of these, one reported mixed findings on the effect of summer holidays(16), and two
reported that school holidays were associated with increased transmission(17,41). The authors of these
studies considered the primary exposure to be increased social contact from international travel, rather than
decreases from the temporary closure or schools.

Different School Setting Types
One school closure study(48), three school reopening studies (16,22,44), and one study looking at closures and
reopenings(24) considered evidence of independent effects for different types of school closures.

Two studies reported independent effect sizes for different settings, but found considerable overlap between
the effect sizes, and noted high temporal correlation between the policy timings meaning that collinearity
limits the interpretability of the findings. Garchitorena et al.(24) (moderate risk of bias) reported the effect of
both school closures and school reopenings on changes to R in 32 European countries, with almost completely
overlapping estimates of transmission reductions associated with closures in early years settings, primary
schools and secondary schools; and equally null effects for each setting associated with reopenings. Yang et
al.(48) (moderate risk of bias) reported that school closures in US counties (presumed primary and secondary
combined) were associated with 37% (95% CI 33-40%) reductions in R, compared to 31% reductions for early
years settings (95% CI 26-35%).

Two studies reported staggered reopenings of different school settings, generally with younger children
students returning first, and a week or two between each reopenings. Both studies found null effects on
transmission overall, and therefore did not report any differential effect by setting type. Stage et al.(44)
(serious risk of bias) noted staggered reopenings in Norway, Denmark and Germany. Ehrhardt et al.(22)
(critical risk of bias) noted staggered reopenings of schools in Baden-Wuttemberg (a region of Germany)

Beesley(16) (critical risk of bias) noted that increases in the 7-day rolling average of new cases were greater in
the 40 days after secondary school reopening than they were in the 24 days following primary schools
reopening. However, this study is at high risk of confounding from other NPIs, and it is not clear why the
chosen (and different) lag periods were applied.

Discussion
We identified 40 studies that provided a quantitative estimate of the impact of school closures or reopening
on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The studies included a range of countries and were heterogenous
in design. Amongst higher quality, less confounded studies of school closures, 6 out of 14 reported that school
closures had no effect on transmission, 6 reported that school closures were associated with reductions in
transmission, and 2 reported mixed findings (figure 2); with findings ranging from no association to a 60%
relative reduction in incidence and mortality rate(14). Most studies of school reopening reported that school
reopening, with extensive infection prevention and control measures in place and when the community
infection levels were low, did not increase community transmission of SARS-CoV-2

The strength of this study is that it draws on empirical data from actual school closures and reopenings during
the COVID-19 pandemic and includes data from 150 countries. By necessity, we include observational rather
than randomised controlled studies, as understandably no jurisdictions have undertaken such trials. We were
unable to meta-analyse due to study heterogeneity. We were unable to meaningfully examine differences
between primary and secondary schools as very few studies distinguished between them, despite the different
transmission patterns for younger and older children. Data are also lacking from low-income countries, where
sociocultural factors may produce different effects of school closures on transmission to high income settings,
leaving a substantial gap in the evidence base. Data in these studies comes exclusively from 2020, and many
studies report only up to the summer months, it is therefore unclear whether our findings are robust to the
effects of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccines.

A major challenge with estimating the ‘independent’ effect of school closures, acknowledged by many of the
studies, is disentangling their effect from other NPIs occurring at the same time. While most studies tried to
account for this, it is unclear how effective these methods were. Even where adjustment occurred there is a
risk of residual confounding, which likely overestimated preventative associations; and collinearity (highlycorrelated independent variables meaning that is impossible to estimate specific effects for each) which could

bias results towards or away from the null. One exception was a paper by Matzinger et al.(37) which focused
on three US states that implemented school closures first and without co-interventions, and reported a twofold increase in the time for cases to double one week after school closures. However it is possible that the
benefits observed here may be attributable, at least in part, to a ‘signalling effect’ with other changes to social
mobility (e.g. working from home) being prompted by school closures. Another approach, though ineligible for
inclusion in our study, is to examine transmission data for breakpoints, and then work backwards to see what
NPIs were in place at the time. Two studies that did this found that transmission started to drop following
other NPIs, before school closures were implemented, and found no change in the gradient of decline after
school closures in Switzerland(55) and Germany(56). This may suggest school closures have different effects
when implemented first, or on top of other restrictions, perhaps due to a broader signalling effect that the first
implemented NPI has on societal mobility patterns. The true independent effect of school closures from the
first wave around the world may simply be unknowable.

In contrast, lifting of NPIs in the summer of 2020 (including school reopenings) generally occurred in a more
staggered way, and on a background of stable testing regimes and outcome ascertainment. Good-quality
observational studies considering data from across 32 European countries(24), Germany alone(28), and the
USA(25) all demonstrated that school reopenings can be successfully implemented without increasing
community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, where baseline incidence is low and robust infection prevention and
control measures are in place. However, the USA-based study did comment that those counties with the
highest 25% of baseline hospitalisations at the time of reopenings (above 40 admissions per 100,000
population per week) did see an increase in transmission following school reopenings, although the bottom
75% of counties did not see any effect. This may explain why the other school reopening study at lower risk of
bias(35) reported a clear, though non-significant, trend towards school reopenings being associated with
increases in transmission rates across 131 countries worldwide, with the authors noting “we were unable to
account for different precautions regarding school reopening that were adopted by some countries” before
citing Israel as an example where an uptick in transmission occurred following reopening, and where “students
were in crowded classrooms and were not instructed to wear face masks.”

The variability in findings from our included studies are likely to reflect issues with study design. However, this
may also suggest that there is no single effect of school closures and reopenings on community transmission
and that contextual factors modify the impact of closures in different countries and over time. If the purpose
of school closures is reduction in social contacts among children, the level of social mixing between children
that occurs outside school once schools are closed is likely to be a key determinant of their effect at reducing
community transmission. This will be influenced by other NPIs, and other key contextual factors including
background prevalence of infection, use of preventive measures in schools prior to closures, age of children
affected, as well as sociodemographic and cultural factors.

Different countries have adopted different approaches to controlling COVID-19. Early in the pandemic school
closures were common, and in some places were one of the first major social distancing measures introduced.
The effectiveness of the overall bundle of lockdown measures implemented is proven, but the incremental
benefit of school closures remains unclear. In contrast, only one of the four studies of school reopenings
assessed at a lower risk of bias reported an increase in community transmission. Collectively the evidence
around school re-openings, while more limited in size, tends to suggest that school reopenings, when
implemented during periods of low incidence and accompanied by robust preventive measures, are unlikely to
have a measurable impact on community transmission. Further research is needed to validate these findings
and their generalisability, including with respect to new variants. These findings are highly important given the
harmful effects of school closures(3,4). Policymakers and governments need to take a measured approach
before implementing school closures in response to rising infection rates, and look to reopen schools, with
appropriate mitigation measures in place, where other lockdown measures have successfully brought
community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control.

provinces

Lombardy and Campania closed
schools before the national school
closures in November. In both cases,
they find that Rt started to decline
around 2 weeks before school
closures, and the rate of decline did
not change after school closures

deaths

Changes to the doubling time of
the epidemic in each state,
following school closures

Georgia: 7 days after school closures
the doubling time slowed from 2.1

Only included Georgia,
Tennessee and Mississippi in
their explicit analysis of school
closure effect because these
were the only states where
the authors felt there was a
long enough gap between
implementation of school
closures and other NPI
measures. However, they
show several figures of other
states that initiated school
closures at the same time as
other lockdown measures. In
these states (Arizona, Florida,
Ilinois, Maryland,
Massachussetts, New Jersey,
New York, and Texas) a similar
pattern is observed for
doubling time of cases, with
time lags varying between 1
and 2 weeks. Patterns
appeared to be similar for
hospitalisations and deaths,
though these data were not
always reported, and more
difficult to interpret

The effect of individual weeks
increased during the holidays, such
that the first 3 weeks were not
