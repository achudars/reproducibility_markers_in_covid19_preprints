Abstract:

The Bronx was an early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. We conducted
temporal genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the Bronx from March-October
2020. Although the local structure of SARS-CoV-2 lineages mirrored those of New York City
and New York State, temporal sampling revealed a dynamic and changing landscape of SARSCoV-2 genomic diversity. Mapping the trajectories of variants, we found that while some have
become ‘endemic’ to the Bronx, other, novel variants rose in prevalence in the late
summer/early fall. Geographically resolved genomes enabled us to distinguish between a case
of reinfection and a case of persistent infection. We propose that limited, targeted, temporal
genomic surveillance has clinical and epidemiological utility in managing the ongoing COVID
pandemic.

Significance:

The ongoing emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants has highlighted the need for continual
genomic surveillance in order to track their spread and limit introductions into new areas. An
understanding of circulating viral strains also provides a powerful tool that can be used to make
clinical inferences. Here, we employ temporally and geographically resolved sequencing of
SARS-CoV-2 samples in order to describe the local landscape of viral variants in the Bronx and
to differentiate between cases of re-infection and persistent infection. We propose that local and
targeted sequencing of viral isolates is an underutilized approach for managing the COVID
pandemic.

Main text:

COVID-19 has had a devastating effect on the health of communities across the globe, with
over 79 million reported cases and greater than 1.7 million deaths since the start of the
pandemic (1). Until vaccines become widely available, understanding and interrupting SARSCoV-2 transmission to prevent infection is the mainstay of public health efforts. The Bronx, a
borough of New York City (NYC) has sustained the second highest rate of COVID-19 in New
York City with 6,035 cases per 100,000 people as of January 11, 2021 (2). To track the local
spread of SARS-CoV-2, we conducted a genomic epidemiologic study at Montefiore Health
Systems (MHS), which offers healthcare services to two million residents throughout the Bronx,
one of the most diverse and poorest urban communities in the United States.
The number of COVID-19 cases peaked in the Bronx in March–April 2020 and subsided
during the late spring into summer 2020. To characterize the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2,
we randomly selected nasopharyngeal samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR
testing at the MHS clinical laboratory between March and October 2020. Genomic viral RNA
was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs, and sequencing libraries were prepared using the
ARTIC Network protocol and analyzed on an Oxford Nanopore MinION (3, 4). The ARTIC
Network bioinformatics protocol was used to quality check and annotate SARS-CoV-2 genomes
with default parameterization (5). We called variants with the NextClade tool and annotated
lineages using the constructed PANGOLIN guide tree from 05/29/2020 (6, 7). Samples were
derived from patients who required hospitalization (48%), mild disease managed as outpatients
(26%) and asymptomatic carriers (8.9%) (Fig. 1A).
We collected 137 samples, and from these generated 104 high-quality genomes from
101 patients with >95% coverage (Fig. S1 and S2). Sequence data were derived from residents
throughout the Bronx and were associated with 22 of 25 zip codes (Fig. 1B). Genomic sampling

was greatest at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March and April, but intermittent
sampling continued as caseloads declined over the summer and fall (Fig. 1C).
Analysis of the resulting 104 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences revealed that B.1 and
B.1.3 lineages were the most prevalent during the early months of the pandemic in the Bronx;
however, several other lineages were also present at low frequencies (Fig. 2A). Although B.1.3
plateaued after the first wave, B.1 continued to be sampled, and a new lineage, B.1.1, arose in
late August. We observed no major differences between Bronx SARS-CoV-2 lineages and other
SARS-CoV-2 lineages in NYC and New York State (NYS) (Fig. 2B) (8, 9). We note that “A”
lineage SARS-CoV-2 viruses are less prevalent in the Bronx, NYC, and NYS compared to the
rest of the USA and the world. To determine how the Bronx sequences compared with those
sampled across the world, we created a downsampled SARS-CoV-2 tree from 613 high-quality
SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID with available location and collection dates. We
found that Bronx SARS-CoV-2 sequences represented subsets of different clades of the global
tree (Fig. 2C).
We next examined patterns in variant nucleotide positions observed in our data. We
found that variation is distributed across the SARS-CoV-2 genome and that some variants are
present in almost all Bronx genomes sequenced—these can be described as ‘core’ to the Bronx
at present (Fig. 3A). Core variants include the spike protein variant A23403G (D614G), as well
as variants C241T, C1059T (T265I), C3037T, C14408T (P314L) in Orf1ab, and G25563T
(Q57H) in Orf3a. We next examined the dynamics of individual SARS-CoV-2 variants. Although
the core variants continued to increase in prevalence as we sequenced new genomes, we also
observed variants novel to the Bronx whose prevalence is beginning to increase, whereas
others have plateaued or are in the process of plateauing (Fig. 3B).
In the spike protein, we found amino acid variants D614G (core), N501T in 5 patients,
and both N501Y and P681R in one patient. We note that P314L in Orf1b is also a core variant in
our dataset, reflecting observations in other studies that this variant is in linkage disequilibrium

with D614G (10). We did not observe the B.1.1.7 variant strain, first identified in the United
Kingdom in the fall of 2020 which also contains the N501Y variant and similarly the P681H, in
our samples. The N501 residue of the spike protein is part of the receptor binding domain and
the receptor binding motif, and variants at this position may influence ACE2 receptor binding
(11). In comparing Bronx variants to those found in the rest of the world, we find that some
variants, such as the spike protein D614G variant, are prevalent both in our set and in the world;
however, some ‘core’ Bronx variants such as C1059T (T265I in Orf1ab) and G25563T (Q57H in
Orf3a) are not as prevalent in the rest of the world (top bar Fig. 3A, Fig. 3C, Fig S3). The
geographic specificity of variants creates a fingerprint that can be useful for tracing the spread
of particular variants; a lineage containing the variant C2416T, linked to the Boston Biogen
COVID-19 outbreak, could be traced to infections around the world (12). The C2416T variant
was also observed in three patients in our dataset. We note that rare variants are uniformly
distributed throughout the sampling period (Fig. S4) and further that the functional impact of
these variants is not well resolved.
A phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 shows that strains collected earlier in the pandemic
are distinguishable from strains collected later, suggesting that new strains are being
continuously introduced into the Bronx (Fig. 4, inner ring, red indicates earlier samples, green
newer samples). In considering the lineages of SARS-CoV-2, there was evidence of ongoing
presence of some B.1 lineage-associated strains, throughout the study period, starting from the
onset of pandemic until the end of the study period (Fig. 4, outer ring indicates lineage). We
found that the B.1.1 lineage had increasing presence in the latter part of the study period and
that newer B.1 strains, which cluster away from older B.1 sequences, appear at later sampling
dates. Newer B.1 and B.1.1 lineages form a distinct clade from older B.1 lineages in the Bronx
SARS-CoV-2 tree. We posit that these two clades reflect two different types of SARS-CoV-2
isolates: those that are circulating locally and those that were newly introduced. We consider
SARS-CoV-2 isolates that group on the downsampled global tree and group on the local Bronx

tree with our first wave pandemic sampling to be ‘circulating.’ We continue to observe isolates
that fall into this ‘first wave’ clade during the summer, post-first wave, and therefore consider
these to have persisted in the Bronx. We consider ‘introduced’ isolates those that are newer
sequences in the local Bronx tree that are also spread out in different clades across the global
tree; it remains to be seen if these introduced isolates will form the basis of a second set of
circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains during a new wave of COVID-19 in the Bronx (Fig. 2C and 4).
This local phylogenetic framework of SARS-CoV-2 strains in the Bronx enabled us to
distinguish between a case of reinfection and a case of persistent infection in two pediatric
patients. The first case is a 10-15-y.o. female who was initially seen in April 2020 in the
emergency department with 3 days of fever, sore throat, anosmia, and ageusia. SARS-CoV-2
infection in this patient was confirmed by RT-PCR. She had a total of 6 days of symptoms and
was in general good health until the second presentation. In August 2020, she presented again
to the emergency department with two days of fever, severe postprandial abdominal cramps,
watery diarrhea and generalized body aches. All other reviews of symptoms were negative. The
patient had no known COVID-19 exposures and limited outside exposure. A respiratory
pathogen panel was negative but her SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive, as was her SARSCOV-2 IgM Immune Status Ratio (ISR) (2.1, with less than 1 considered negative). Her IgG ISR
was negative, 8.7 (normal range ISR < 9). The patient had a total of three days of fever with
complete resolution of all other symptoms by day four of illness.
The two SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced from this patient were 142 days apart and
differed in nucleotide sequence at 17 different positions. The first and second samples from this
patient fall in different local phylogenetic clades in the Bronx phylogenetic tree, supporting the
hypothesis that we are observing a new infection and not prolonged shedding from the original
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 4, purple arrows). To our knowledge, this is the first case of
symptomatic reinfection in a child who had prior symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the
history of limited exposures to high-risk activities for this patient between the two episodes and

the overall low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in New York at the time of the second
presentation in August, genomic and phylogenetic analysis provided key confirmatory evidence
in support of the clinical inference of a reinfection.
The second case involved a 15-20-y.o. female with an incompletely characterized
immunodeficiency who presented in July 2020 with an oral lesion. She had no fever, or
respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, and had neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 700
cells/ul). After admission for further evaluation, she was found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive.
During the admission, she was intermittently febrile and neutropenic and was treated with broad
spectrum antibiotics. She developed a buttock lesion that was biopsied, revealing a thrombotic
vasculopathy with infarction. Due to concern that the lesion could represent COVID-19–
associated vasculopathy, and in the setting of persistent fever and intermittent neutropenia, she
was treated with a 10-day course of remdesivir. The patient continued to have positive
nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 from early July to the end of September (Table S1 and
Fig. S5). Her SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Abbott) was negative in mid-August.
For this patient, the three sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled in July, August
and October fall in the same clade (Fig. 4, orange arrows). This clade is polytomic by
TimeTree, meaning that it is not possible to resolve the relationships between sequences within
this clade, but the clade itself is supported by a bootstrap value of 870/1000 for (SH-aLRT
replicates) (13, 14). We therefore posit that the three strains sequenced from this patient,
despite having some variation, are more likely to represent a single SARS-CoV-2 infection
rather than multiple infections. Together, these genomic, phylogenetic, and clinical observations
strongly suggest that this patient has been unable to clear a single infection of SARS-CoV-2, as
opposed to being reinfected with a distinct strain. Other examples of persistent infection with
SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, but not, to our knowledge, in children (15–17). A woman
diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who was sampled 5 times, had SARS-CoV-2
sequences displaying intrahost variation despite the SARS-CoV-2 being polytomic, similar to

what we observe here (18). The polytomy that encompasses this persistent case also contains
independent local strains of SARS-CoV-2 that do not separate on the global tree, suggesting
that some variants seen in this patient are also shared locally in the Bronx (Fig. 2C and 4).
Our work supports guiding principles for practical and clinical applications of SARS-CoV2 sequencing in the COVID-19 pandemic. How many genomes do you need to sequence for a
local community to resolve clinical questions? In our case, ~100 genomes were sufficient to
place new patients into the context of the variability of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic and to
be able to answer coarse-grained questions to determine reinfection vs. persistent infection and
community-level observations of older vs. newly introduced strains. The targeted utilization of
small numbers of stored swabs for temporally resolved viral genomic surveillance could thus
resolve clinical questions related to persistent vs. reinfection. With the introduction and spread
of recently identified United Kingdom and South African SARS-Cov-2 variants with potentially
different epidemiological features from existing strains, there has been speculation that we may
observe a selective sweep of existing viral genotypes in the months to follow (19, 20).
Temporally and geographically resolved sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes provides a
background against which introduction of these or other new genotypes into our local
community can be observed in real time. Given the lack of a national sequencing effort, we
suggest that decentralized, small-scale sequencing coupled with rapid data sharing to public
databases provides an alternative and more practical tool to monitor and curtail the introduction
and spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Material and methods

Ethics statement
Remnant nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and deidentified at Montefiore Medical Center.
This work was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Albert Einstein College of Medicine
under IRB number 2016-6137.

Data availability
All sequences generated in this study have been made publicly available through the GISAID
hCoV-19 sequence database. The source code used for sequencing, analysis, and figure
generation, is hosted on Github at https://github.com/kellylab/genomic-surveillance-of-the-bronx.

RNA isolation
Viral RNA was isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs using the MagMAX Viral RNA isolation kit
(Applied Biosystems, #AM1939) according to the manufacturer’s specification. 400 μl of viral
transport medium was used as input for each sample. Isolated RNA was then stored at -80C
prior to sequencing library generation.

Preparation of sequencing libraries
Sequencing libraries were prepared according to the protocol established by the ARTIC network
(3, 4). Briefly, cDNA was generated from viral RNA using SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase
(Thermo Scientific, #18090010). 400 nt tiled amplicons were generated using the V3 primer

pool, divided into 4 sub-pools for increased efficiency. Amplification was performed using Q5
High-Fidelity polymerase (New England Biolabs, #M0491S) with cycle numbers optimized for
each sub-pool. Following amplicon cleanup using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter,
#A63880), 5 ng of input DNA, quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit
(Invitrogen, #P7589), was natively barcoded using the Native Barcoding Expansion (Nanopore,
# EXP-NBD104). After another round of amplicon cleanup using AMPure XP beads, sequencing
adapters were ligated to pooled barcoded amplicons using NEBNext Quick Ligation Module
(New England Biolabs, #E6056). Following an additional step of cleanup and quantification, the
final libraries were sequenced.

Nanopore MinION sequencing
Sequencing libraries were diluted in elution buffer (Qiagen, # 19086) to a concentration
corresponding to approximately 20 ng of library per sequencing run. MinION flow cells (Oxford
Nanopore, #FLO-MIN106D were prepared using the Ligation Sequencing Kit (Oxford Nanopore,
#SQK-LSK109). Libraries were then loaded onto the flow cell and sequencing allowed to
proceed for 10 to 20 hours depending on library size.

Sequencing analysis
ONT MinION output files in fast5 format were processed using an implementation of the ARTIC
sequencing pipeline on Google Cloud Platform. Briefly, this pipeline consists of the following
steps: 1) Basecall reads using Oxford Nanopore’s Guppy tool; 2) Detect barcodes to sort out
reads from different samples using Guppy; 3) Remove chimeric reads and small contaminations
by filtering out all reads not within 400-700nt in length; 4) Align reads to the Wuhan reference
genome (NCBI identifier MN908947.3) using minimap2, generate a consensus genome, and

call variants using the nanopolish tool.
The pipeline was run using the workflow tool Argo running on a Kubernetes cluster in the
cloud. Data was stored on a cloud storage bucket between steps (see supplemental code).
Low-coverage sequences were improved by combining passed reads from multiple sequencing
runs before generating consensus sequences.
Quality control
We included in our analysis only sequences that had 95% or higher coverage, a criterion 104
out of 132 sequences satisfied (Fig S2). We also looked for signs of biases in the base calling
pipeline which would result in higher or lower likelihood of gaps in certain regions. We found that
the probability of a gap being present in the consensus is strongly correlated with the coverage
level in the BAM file generated by the pipeline. In particular, we found that a coverage of 20x
was almost always sufficient to result in a basecall being made at a given position but that the
majority of positions had coverage above 400x. Thus, any biases in the pipeline are more likely
to arise from biases in the nanopore sequencer itself or its basecaller rather than the consensus
generation software.

Variant annotation and global analysis of variants
We used the NextClade command line tool to assign variant calls to each of the samples. This
tool performs a pairwise alignment between an assembled genome and the Wuhan reference
genome and reports the differences as variant calls. NextClade was also used to determine the
amino acid changes implied by each variant. This method of variant calling was chosen over the
one provided in the ARTIC pipeline in order to maintain consistency with our comparative
analysis of global variant distributions.
We downloaded all of the 139676 genomes available from GISAID as of November 14,

2020 and used the NextClade command line tool to annotate each of their variants. This tool
automatically rejects sequences that it deems of low quality, and this yielded variant calls from
139590 genomes from around the world. We used this output to compute the frequency of a
variant as the percentage of samples in the world / AECOM dataset containing a given variant.

Creating the local phylogenetic tree
Individual FASTA files ≥ 95% coverage were collected after output by the ARTIC pipeline. The
multi-FASTA was aligned using MAFFT on the Nextstrain command line interface version 1.16.7
(6, 22). The resulting alignment FASTA generated was constructed into a maximum likelihood
tree with 1000 SH-aLRT bootstraps using a TIM + F + I substitution model via iqtree-2.1.1Windows (14). The tree was rooted on AECOM 90, the oldest outgroup sequence, and the
entire tree was branch length corrected based on a fixed mutation rate of 0.0008
nucleotides/site/year with a standard deviation of 0.0004 using treetime 0.7.6 (13). The tree was
visualized on iTOL and annotated with the iTOL annotation editor (21).

Creating the global phylogenetic tree
The GISAID database: GISAID - Initiative limited to 95% coverage and higher was used as an
input for this analysis. The multi-FASTA of 11/14/2020 was filtered using the Nextstrain
command line interface version 1.16.7 filter command. The specifications entailed and inclusion
criteria used to construct a globally and temporally representative multi-FASTA was adapted
from the criteria used to construct the Nextstrain global tree. An inclusion and exclusion text file
was used to remove and keep strains that Nextstrain deemed important and is located here:
https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov. The entire GISAID database was purged of any sequence
with inconsistent metadata and grouped based on the country sequenced, the year, and month

collected making 612 distinct groups from which 1 sequence was randomly chosen out of each
group. The resultant multi-FASTA was aligned using MAFFT on the Nextstrain command line
interface version 1.16.7 (6, 22). A maximum likelihood tree was constructed with 1000 SH-aLRT
bootstraps using a GTR substitution model via iqtree-2.1.1-Windows (14). The tree was
visualized on iTOL and annotated with the iTOL annotation editor (21).

Identifying lineages
To identify pangolin lineages, the pangolin command line tool 2.0.8 was used in legacy mode,
relying upon the 05/29/2020 update of the guide tree to assign lineages to local sequences via
bootstrapping. The browse function of the GISAID database was used to count the lineages
present in New York State. United States and global data were retrieved from SARS-CoV-2
lineages (cov-lineages.org) (7).

variants showing up at a position. The heatmap was generated by ordering our samples
by date of sample collection and coloring in on the x-axis wherever a variant was found
on a given position. Note that the x-axis is nonlinear in the sense that only positions
where a variant was found in at least one sample in our cohort are included (this also
holds true for the top histogram). We labeled on the x-axis all variants which showed up
at least four times in our dataset and in parentheses indicated what the amino acid
changes implied by those variants were. Some of the variants were in regions where
multiple open reading frames overlap, so we indicated amino acid changes for both
reading frames.
For all three subfigures, we separated our variants into three categories:
i)

Rare: Positions where a variant is found less than four times.

ii)

Uncommon: Positions where a variant is found at least four times but less than
26 times (25% of our samples that were used in the analysis). This was further
broken down into wave 1 and wave 2 categories, where a variant was considered
to be ‘wave-1-associated’ if it showed up at least four times in the first half of the
samples and at most once in the latter half (and vice-versa for wave 2). Samples
that showed up at least once in both halves were labelled as wave 1 + 2.

iii)

Common: Positions where a variant is found at least 26 times.

b) For the variants that showed up at least four times in our sampling, we constructed
rarefaction curves showing the cumulative count of those variants when samples were
ordered by collection date. Here, we did not have to consider if two samples might have
different variants at a given position, as that scenario did not occur after we only
considered uncommon and common variants. We color coded the rarefaction curves

based on if the variant was common, wave-1, wave-2, or wave-1+2. We labeled each
line by variant position using a Matplotlib extension called matplotlib-label-lines.
