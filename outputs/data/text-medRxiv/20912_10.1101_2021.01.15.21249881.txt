Abstract

12

The impact of variable infection risk by race and ethnicity on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread

13

is largely unknown. Here, we fit structured compartmental models to seroprevalence data from New

14

York State and analyze how herd immunity thresholds (HITs), final sizes, and epidemic risk changes

15

across groups. A simple model where interactions occur proportionally to contact rates reduced the

16

HIT, but more realistic models of preferential mixing within groups increased the threshold toward

17

the value observed in homogeneous populations. Across all models, the burden of infection fell dis-

18

proportionately on minority populations: in a model fit to Long Island serosurvey and census data,

19

81% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT was reached compared to 34% of non-

20

Hispanic whites. Our findings, which are meant to be illustrative and not best estimates, demon-

21

strate how racial and ethnic disparities can impact epidemic trajectories and result in unequal distri-

22

butions of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction

24

The dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread are influenced by population heterogeneity. This is especially

25

true for herd immunity, which occurs when susceptible individuals in a population are indirectly pro-

26

tected from infection due to immunity in others. The herd immunity threshold (HIT) is the fraction

27

of the population that is non-susceptible when an unmitigated epidemic reaches its peak, and esti-

28

mating the HIT for SARS-CoV-2 is important for forecasting the harm associated with letting the epi-

29

demic spread in the absence of interventions [1]. A population that has reached the HIT is protected

30

from a new epidemic occurring, until births or waning immunity reduce the proportion nonsuscep-

31

tible below the HIT, but existing cases will still lead to some onward transmission as the epidemic

32

declines and can often result in a final epidemic size that exceeds the HIT. In a population with ho-

33

mogeneous mixing, the HIT is 1-1/R0 , where R0 is the basic reproduction number; this translates to

34

an HIT of 67% using an R0 of 3.

35

However, population homogeneity is an unrealistic assumption, and models incorporating hetero-

36

geneity in social exposure and infection susceptibility (defined as the probability of infection given

37

exposure) generally result in lowered HITs [2–6]. The key idea behind these models is that sub-

38

populations important for epidemic spread (i.e., those with substantially increased susceptibility or

39

exposure) become infected – and thus develop immunity – early on in an epidemic’s course. Herd

40

immunity for the population overall is then achieved earlier because once these individuals are no

41

longer susceptible to infection, further epidemic spread is slowed.

42

Importantly, these models also imply that in locations where SARS-CoV-2 has spread, there may

43

be demographic sub-populations with particularly high cumulative incidences of infection due to

44

increased exposure, susceptibility, or both. Seroprevalence studies – which characterize past ex-

45

posure by identifying SARS-CoV-2 antibodies – can identify these sub-populations and are more

46

reliable and unbiased than case data, which suffer from under-reporting and other biases [7]. Iden-

47

tifying and building structured models with these groups in mind is important for understanding how

48

variation in exposure or susceptibility and social disparities are interconnected. These models are

49

also useful for designing interventions that can both reduce disparities and disrupt overall trans-

50

mission by focusing efforts on groups most affected by high transmission rates [8, 9]. Transmission

51

models in this space have incorporated subpopulation structure by focusing primarily on accounting

52

for variation in susceptibility and exposure by age [3, 10, 11]. Supporting this approach, susceptibil-

53

ity to infection, contact rates, and cumulative incidence in some locations all appear to vary by age

54

[10, 12]. Nonetheless, serosurveys in Belgium, Spain, Iran, New York City, Brazil, and other places

55

exhibit relatively low variation in seropositivity by age [13–17], indicating additional factors that gov-

56

ern transmission spread.

57

Substantial racial and ethnic disparities in infection rates, hospitalizations, and deaths have been

58

characterized across the US [18–24], but it is unclear how these heterogeneities in risk are expected

59

to change over time, and what implications – if any – they have on overall epidemic dynamics. Here,

60

we aim to address these questions by fitting compartmental SEIR transmission models structured

61

by race and ethnicity to seroprevalence data from New York City and Long Island [16]. We focus pri-

62

marily on building and analyzing variable exposure models because observed disparities in infection

63

rates in US cities are strongly attributable to differences in mobility and exposure [25–27]. Because

64

of the challenges in acquiring racial and ethnic COVID-19 data [28], including social contact data

65

that can be used in transmission models, we analyze a range of model structures that are compati-

66

ble with the data and assess how these assumptions affect estimates of HITs, final epidemic sizes,

67

and longitudinal trends in risk across groups. These results highlight the importance of develop-

68

ing socially-informed COVID-19 transmission models that incorporate patterns of epidemic spread

69

across racial and ethnic groups.

Methods

where S, E, I, R refer to the number of people in susceptible, latently infected, infectious, and recov-

79

as suggested by empirical studies [29, 30], we set the mean latent period 1/r to be 3 days to allow

for pre-symptomatic transmission and the mean infectious period 1/γ to be 4 days to coincide with

81

the observed serial interval. The per capita transmission rate is given by β = R0 γ/N , where N is

82

the total number of people in the population.

83

We extended this model to incorporate multiple racial and ethnic groups by including SEIR com-

84

partmental variables for each group, which interact through a social contact matrix that governs the

85

interactions between and within groups. In matrix form, the structured SEIR model is given by:

dS

89

where ◦ denotes element-wise multiplication and S, E, I, R are column vectors comprising the com-

90

partmental variables for each group (e.g., S = [S0 , ..., Sp ]T for p demographic groups). We let S0 de-

91

note non-Hispanic whites, S1 denote Hispanics or Latinos, S2 denote non-Hispanic African-Americans,

92

S3 denote non-Hispanic Asians, and S4 denote multiracial or other demographic groups, with similar

93

ordering for elements in vectors E through R.

94

We define contacts to be interactions between individuals that allow for transmission of SARS-CoV-

95

2 with some non-zero probability. Following the convention for age-structured transmission models

96

[31], we defined the p × p per capita social contact matrix C to consist of elements ci←j at row i and

97

column j, representing the per capita rate that individuals from group i are contacted by individuals

98

of group j. Letting Ni be the total number of individuals in group i, the social contact matrix M con-

99

sists of elements mi←j = ci←j ∗ Ni , which represents the average number of individuals in group

100

i encountered by an individual in group j. The susceptibility to infection can vary between groups,

101

which we modeled by allowing the probability of infection given contact with an infected individual to

102

vary: q = [q0 , ..., qp ]T . The transmission matrix B is then given by (q1T ) ◦ C, where 1T is a 1 by p

103

vector of 1s:

Given mean duration of infectiousness 1/γ, the next-generation matrix G, representing the average

105

number of infections in group i caused by an infected individual in group j, is given by (q1T )◦M/γ =

106

N ◦ B/γ. R0 for the overall population described by this structured model was calculated by comput-

107

ing the dominant eigenvalue of matrix G. The effective reproduction number Rt at time t was calcu-

108

lated by computing the dominant eigenvalue of Gt = (q1T ) ◦ Mt /γ = St ◦ B/γ, where the elements

109

in Mt are given by ci←j ∗ Si,t and Si,t is the number of susceptible individuals in group i at time t. To

110

hold R0 values across model types constant when calculating HITs and final epidemic sizes, we re-

111

scaled transmission matrices to have the same dominant eigenvalue. We also calculated the instan-

112

taneous incidence rate of infection at some time t for all groups by calculating the force of infection

113

λt = (BIt ) ◦ St . To account for the effects of social distancing and other non-pharmaceutical in-

114

terventions, we scaled the transmission rate by a factor α beginning when 5% cumulative incidence

115

in the population was reached, representing an established and expanding epidemic, for a variable

116

duration. We analyzed a range of α values to reflect the variation in NPIs implemented.

117

Structured model variants

118

Simplifying assumptions are needed to constrain the number of variables to estimate in B given

119

limited data. Under the variable susceptibility model, we set the contact rates ci←j to all be 1, in-

120

dicating no heterogeneity in exposure, but allowed the qj in the susceptibility vector to vary (i.e.,

121

B = q1T ).

122

Under each of two variable exposure models, in contrast, we set the susceptibility factors qj to be

123

equal. The simplest variable exposure model we analyzed was the proportionate mixing model,

124

which assumes that the contact rate for each pair of groups is proportional to the total contact rate

125

of the two groups (i.e., total number of contacts per unit time for an individual of group i) [32]. De-

126

noting ai as the total contact rate for a member of group i and a as the 1 × p vector of ai s, the ijth

127

entry in the transmission matrix is given by:

Finally, under the assortative mixing assumption, we extended this model by partitioning a fraction

Calculating the HIT and final epidemic size

134

We defined the herd immunity threshold (HIT) for all models as the fraction of non-susceptible peo-

135

ple when the effective reproduction number Rt first crosses 1. In the homogenous model, where

136

Rt = St β/γ, the analytical solution for the HIT occurs when the fraction of non-susceptible indi-

137

viduals equals 1-1/R0 . In the structured models of heterogeneous populations, the HIT was calcu-

138

lated via simulation: we took the dominant eigenvalue of Gt at each timestep to calculate Rt , and

139

identified the number of non-susceptible individuals when Rt first decreased below 1. For the het-

140

erogeneous models with mitigation measures, Rt was calculated at each timestep with respect to

141

the corresponding unmitigated epidemic; in other words, the mitigation scaling factor α was not in-

142

cluded in the Rt calculation. This identifies the point in the epidemic trajectory at which the popu-

143

lation reaches the HIT even if all mitigation measures were lifted (i.e. HIT due to population immu-

144

nity), as opposed to the point in the trajectory when the population transiently reaches the HIT due

145

to mitigation measures (see Supplementary Figure 17 for further explanation).

146

Final epidemic sizes were calculated by simulation by running the epidemic out to 1 year for R0

147

above 2, and 4 years for R0 below 2 to allow additional time for the slower epidemics to fully resolve.

148

The final time point was used as the estimate for the final epidemic size.

variable susceptibility models using maximum likelihood fits to a single cross-sectional serosurvey

153

from New York, which was collected from over 15,000 adults in grocery stores from April 19-28th

154

[16]. We assumed that the seroprevalence data (adjusted cumulative incidence estimates from Ta-

155

ble 2 in Rosenberg et al., 2020) were collected via a binomial sampling process: at a given time

156

point ts representing the time of the serosurvey, the number of seropositive cases Yi (ts ) in group i

157

is distributed Bin(mi , Ri (ts )/Ni (ts )), where mi is the number of people tested from group i in the

158

serosurvey and Ri /Ni is the fraction of recovered people from the SEIR model. The likelihood was

159

calculated jointly for all demographic groups, with ts set to 100 days and the initial number of in-

160

fected individuals set to 1 in each demographic group; see Supplementary Information for sensitivity

161

analyses on these assumptions.

162

We acquired total population numbers (i.e. Ni for i ∈ {0, ..., 4}) from the 2018 ACS census 1-year

163

estimates Table B03002 (Hispanic or Latino origin by race) subsetted to the following counties:

164

Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens, and Richmond Counties for New York City and Nassau and Suf-

165

folk Counties for Long Island. We acquired population numbers at the level of ”all block groups”

166

within the above counties from the 2018 ACS 5-year estimates Table B03002 (Hispanic or Latino

Results

204

We model the dynamics of COVID-19 infection allowing for social exposure to infection to vary across

205

racial and ethnic groups. Models incorporating variable susceptibility to COVID-19 are commonly

206

used when stratifying by age because children are thought to have decreased susceptibility to in-

207

fection [10]. Variable susceptibility to infection across racial and ethnic groups has been less well

208

characterized, and observed disparities in infection rates can already be largely explained by differ-

209

ences in mobility and exposure [25–27], likely attributable to social factors such as structural racism

210

that have put racial and ethnic minorities in disadvantaged positions (e.g., employment as frontline

211

workers and residence in overcrowded, multigenerational homes) [35–38]. In line with the notion

212

that variation in exposure could instead be the main driver of observed seroprevalence differences,

213

our primary focus is on analyzing variable exposure models; we have also analyzed variable sus-

214

ceptibility models for comparison (see Supplementary Information).

215

The simplest variable exposure models assume proportionate mixing, where the contact rate be-

216

tween groups is set to be proportional to the total contact rates (i.e., total number of contacts per

217

time period per individual) of the two groups [32]. We fit proportionate mixing models allowing for

218

variable contact rates across racial and ethnic demographic groups to serosurvey data collected in

219

late-April from New York City (NYC) and Long Island, comprising 5946 and 2074 adults, respec-

220

tively [16]. The serosurvey data were compatible with proportionate mixing models in which His-

221

panics or Latinos, non-Hispanic Black people, non-Hispanic Asians, and multiracial or other peo-

222

ple had 2.25, 1.62, 0.86, and 1.28 times the total contact rates relative to non-Hispanic whites in

223

NYC. Model fits to Long Island resulted in even more pronounced exposure differences because of

224

greater between-group differences in seropositivity (e.g., the seropositivity in Hispanics or Latinos

225

relative to non-Hispanic whites was 1.85 times higher in Long Island than in NYC). Under propor-

226

tionate mixing, Hispanics or Latinos, non-Hispanic Black people, non-Hispanic Asians, and mul-

227

tiracial or other people had 4.31, 1.96, 0.92, and 2.48 times the fitted total contact rates relative to

228

non-Hispanic whites in Long Island, respectively. These differences in exposure impacted herd im-

229

munity levels and final epidemic sizes relative to the homogeneous model across a range of R0 val-

230

ues (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 5); for example, for an R0 of 3, the HIT decreases to 58%

231

in NYC and 40% in Long Island, compared to 67% under the homogeneous model. The observed

232

contrast in HITs and final sizes between the proportionate mixing and the homogenous model is in

233

line with theoretical derivations (Supplementary Figure 4). The HIT overall is reached in this model

234

after cumulative incidence has disproportionately increased in certain minority groups: at the HIT,

235

panics or Latinos and non-Hispanic Black people, which is in line with studies using cell phone mo-

240

bility data [25]; however, the magnitudes of the ratios are substantially higher than one would expect

241

given the findings from those studies. This may reflect some of the limitations of the proportionate

242

mixing assumption, which does not allow for preferential within-group contacts and hence must fit

243

observed seropositivity differences solely by scaling total contact rates. To address this, we aug-

244

ment the model by partitioning a specified fraction  of contacts to be exclusively within-group, with

245

the remaining contacts distributed proportionately. This assortative mixing model captures more re-

246

alistic patterns of interactions due to neighborhood structure. After fitting the models across a range

247

of  values, we observed that as  increases, HITs and epidemic final sizes shifted higher back to-

248

wards the homogeneous case (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 5); this effect was less pronounced

249

for R0 values close to 1. This observation can be understood by comparing the epidemic cumula-

250

tive incidence trajectories (Supplementary Figure 6) and next-generation matrices (Supplementary

251

Figures 2 and 3): under proportionate mixing ( = 0), lower-risk demographic groups are protected

252

from further infection due to built-up immunity in higher-risk demographic groups, but the magnitude

253

of this indirect protection decreases as the proportion of exclusively within-group contacts increases

254

and groups become more isolated.

255

We assessed a range of values for  because the serosurvey data cannot be used to also fit the op-

256

timal  value; given limited numbers of data points, any value of  can fit exactly to the single sero-

257

prevalence time point we consider. To inform plausible assortativity levels, we instead used addi-

258

tional data on demographic population distributions from the American Community Survey US cen-

259

sus stratified at the census block group level, which represents a small geographic area and popu-

260

lation (Supplementary Figure 17). We first calculated the exposure index, which represents the av-

261

erage neighborhood’s demographic composition from the perspective of an individual from a given

262

racial or ethnic group; the proportion of contacts within group were elevated, suggesting assortativ-

263

ity in the census data (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). To directly fit  with these data, we assumed

264

proportionate mixing within census block groups and ran an iterative fitting approach to jointly fit 

265

and the ai total contact rates using both census and serosurvey data (see methods and Supple-

266

mentary Tables 4 and 5). This approach accounts for contacts based on geographic proximity us-

267

ing strong assumptions on mixing patterns, but may not capture contacts in other settings, such as

268

work, beyond one’s immediate neighborhood of residence. The models jointly fitted to serosurvey

269

and census data indicated that 46% and 39% of contacts were exclusively within-group in NYC and

270

Long Island, respectively. The same groups had elevated total contact rates as under proportionate

272

bility differences [25]: model estimates indicated Hispanics or Latinos, non-Hispanic Black people,

273

non-Hispanic Asians, and multiracial or other people had 1.62, 1.35, 0.90, and 1.17 times the to-

274

tal contact rate relative to non-Hispanic whites in NYC, respectively, and 2.60, 1.63, 0.93, and 1.90

275

times the total contact rate relative to non-Hispanic whites in Long Island, respectively. For an epi-

276

demic with R0 = 3, the HITs for NYC and Long Island using these census-informed assortativity

277

models were 61% and 45%, respectively. Similar to previous models, at the HIT, 76% of Hispanics

278

or Latinos and 66% of non-Hispanic Black people were infected compared to 50% of non-Hispanic

279

whites in NYC, and 81% of Hispanics or Latinos and 56% of non-Hispanic Black people were in-

280

fected compared to 34% of non-Hispanic whites in Long Island (Figure 2).

281

Using these census-informed assortative mixing models, we then considered how the relative inci-

282

dence rates of infection in demographic groups could change over the course of the epidemic. Early

283

comparisons of infection and mortality rates have helped to identify racial and ethnic groups at high

284

risk and the risk factors for infection [18–24], but these studies often rely on cross-sectional snap-

285

shots of epidemiological patterns. The challenge is that these metrics can change over time: for

286

instance, multiple studies indicate decreasing disparities in incidence rate over time across racial

287

and ethnic groups relative to non-Hispanic whites [39, 40]. The reasons for these changes are mul-

288

tifaceted, but even independent of the effect of interventions, behavioral changes, or differential ac-

289

cess to testing, models of epidemic spread in structured populations imply that incidence rate ratios

290

for high-risk groups can decrease substantially as the epidemic progresses because of depletion of

291

susceptible individuals from these groups [41, 42]. In line with this, we observe that instantaneous

292

incidence rate ratios are elevated initially in high-contact groups relative to non-Hispanic whites, but

293

this trend reverses after the epidemic has peaked and overall incidence is decreasing – a conse-

294

quence of the fact that a majority of individuals have already become infected (Figure 3). Similarly,

295

cumulative incidence ratios remain elevated in high-contact racial and ethnic groups throughout the

296

epidemic, but the magnitude decreases as the epidemic progresses (Supplementary Figure 8). Al-

297

though these trajectories are not meant to be taken as predictive estimates, these results highlight

298

the importance of controlling for dynamics-induced changes in epidemiological measures of disease

299

burden when evaluating the impact of interventions for reducing inequities in SARS-CoV-2 infections

300

[43]; otherwise, ineffective interventions – depending on their timing – might still be associated with

301

declines in relative measures of disease burden.

302

Finally, we assessed how robust these findings were to the impact of social distancing and other

303

non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We modeled these mitigation measures by scaling the

304

transmission rate by a factor α beginning when 5% cumulative incidence in the population was reached.

305

Setting the duration of distancing to be 50 days and allowing α to be either 0.3 or 0.6 (i.e. a 70% or

306

40% reduction in transmission rates, respectively), we assessed how the R0 versus HIT and final

307

epidemic size relationships changed. We found that the R0 versus HIT relationship was similar to in

308

the unmitigated epidemic (Supplementary Figure 9). In contrast, final epidemic sizes depended on

309

the intensity of mitigation measures, though qualitative trends across models (e.g. increased assor-

310

tativity leads to greater final sizes) remained true (Supplementary Figure 10). To explore this further,

311

we systematically varied α and the duration of NPIs while holding R0 constant at 3. We found again

312

that the HIT was consistent, whereas final epidemic sizes were substantially affected by the choice

313

of mitigation parameters (Supplementary Figure 11); the distribution of cumulative incidence at the

314

point of HIT was also comparable with and without mitigation measures (Supplementary Figure 12).

315

The most stringent NPI intensities did not necessarily lead to the smallest epidemic final sizes, an

316

idea which has been explored in studies analyzing optimal control measures [44, 45]. Longitudinal

317

changes in incidence rate ratios also were affected by NPIs, but qualitative trends in the ordering of

318

racial and ethnic groups over time remained consistent (Supplementary Figure 13).

319

Discussion

320

Here, we explored how incorporating heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 spread across racial and eth-

321

nic groups could affect epidemic dynamics using deterministic transmission models. Models incor-

322

porating variable exposure generally decreased the HIT and final epidemic size, but incorporating

323

preferential within-group contacts shifted HITs and final epidemic sizes higher, approaching the ho-

324

mogeneous case. Epidemiological measures of disease burden such as incidence rate ratios and

325

cumulative incidence ratios also changed substantially over the course of the epidemic, highlighting

326

the need to account for these trends when evaluating interventions [43]. These results illustrate the

327

varied effects of different structured heterogeneity models, but are not meant to be best estimates

328

given the limited seroprevalence data.

329

Across all model variants, the observed higher cumulative incidence among Hispanics or Latinos

330

and non-Hispanic Black people compared to non-Hispanic whites led to estimates of higher esti-

331

mated contacts relative to non-Hispanic whites, mirroring existing inequities in housing, education,

332

healthcare, and beyond [20, 38, 46–48]. The estimated contact rate differences also concord with

333

reports that frontline workers, who are unable to engage in physical or social distancing to the same

334

degree as other types of workers, are disproportionately from minority backgrounds [25, 27, 49].

335

The assortativity we observed in the census data has root causes in many areas, including residen-

336

tial segregation arising from a long history of discriminatory practices [46, 48, 50, 51]. Projecting

337

the epidemic forward indicated that the overall HIT was reached after cumulative incidence had in-

338

creased disproportionately in minority groups, highlighting the fundamentally inequitable outcome

339

of achieving herd immunity through infection. All of these factors underscore the fact that incorpo-

340

rating heterogeneity in models in a mechanism-free manner can conceal the disparities that under-

341

lie changes in epidemic final sizes and HITs. In particular, overall lower HIT and final sizes occur

342

because certain groups suffer not only more infection than average, but more infection than under

343

a homogeneous mixing model; incorporating heterogeneity lowers the HIT but increases it for the

344

highest-risk groups (Figure 2).

345

These results also suggest that public health interventions for reducing COVID-19 inequities can

346

have synergistic effects for controlling the overall epidemic [34]. For instance, from a transmission-

347

control perspective, age-structured models indicate that vaccination of high-contact age groups –

348

such as young adults – is optimal for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [9]. Similar interven-

349

tions are being explored for disadvantaged populations because of how increased exposure un-

350

derlies much of the higher infection risk that racial and ethnic minorities experience. For instance,

351

Mulberry et al. used a structured SEIR model to evaluate the impact of preferentially vaccinating

352

essential workers, finding that such a strategy was more effective in reducing morbidity, mortality,

353

and economic cost due to COVID-19 compared to age-only vaccination prioritization strategies [52].

354

Because racial and ethnic minorities are overrepresented among essential workers [25, 27, 49], fur-

355

ther modeling studies could evaluate the impact of such strategies on also reducing inequities in

356

COVID-19 infection rates. Wrigley-Field et al. took a different methodological approach, projecting

357

demographically-stratified death rates from 2020 into 2021 assuming various vaccination strategies

358

[53]. In line with the prior study, they found that vaccination strategies that prioritized geographic ar-

359

eas based on socioeconomic criteria or prior COVID mortality rates outperformed age-based strate-

360

gies in reducing overall mortality and inequities in mortality. Because populations here were con-

361

sidered independently, these results could be extended using a transmission modeling framework,

362

such as the one we have described, that accounts for interactions between racial and ethnic groups

363

and thus allows for synergistic benefits from vaccinating high-risk populations. All policy proposals

364

in this space should, of course, carefully consider the legal and ethical dimensions of vaccinations

365

or other interventions targeted by race or ethnicity [54].

366

We note several limitations with this study. First, biases in the serosurvey sampling process can

367

substantially affect downstream results; any conclusions drawn depend heavily on the degree to

368

which serosurvey design and post-survey adjustments yield representative samples [55]. For in-

369

stance, because the serosurvey we relied on primarily sampled people at grocery stores, there is

370

both survival bias (cumulative incidence estimates do not account for people who have died) and

371

ascertainment bias (undersampling of at-risk populations that are more likely to self-isolate, such

372

as the elderly) [16, 56]. These biases could affect model estimates if, for instance, the capacity to

373

self-isolate varies by race or ethnicity – as suggested by associations of neighborhood-level mobil-

374

ity versus demographics [27, 57] – leading to an overestimate of cumulative incidence and contact

375

rates in whites. Other sources of uncertainty, such as antibody test sensitivity and specificity, could

376

also be incorporated into transmission models in future work [56, 58]. Second, we have assumed

377

that seropositivity implies complete immunity and that immunity does not wane. These are strong

378

assumptions that can be revisited as empirical studies on the length of natural immunity are con-

379

ducted. Third, we have assumed the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as stay-at-

380

home policies, closures, and the like to equally affect racial and ethnic groups. Empirical evidence

381

suggests that during periods of lockdown, certain neighborhoods that are disproportionately wealthy

382

and white tend to show greater declines in mobility than others [27, 57]. These simplifying assump-

383

tions were made to aid in illustrating the key findings of this model, but for more detailed predictive

384

models, the extent to which contact rate differences change could be evaluated using longitudinal

385

contact survey data [59], since granular mobility data are typically not stratified by race and ethnicity

386

due to privacy concerns [60]. Fourth, due to data availability, we have only considered variability in

387

exposure due to one demographic characteristic; models should ideally strive to also account for the

388

effects of age on susceptibility and exposure within strata of race and ethnicity and other relevant

389

demographics, such as socioeconomic status and occupation [52]. These models could be fit using

390

representative serological studies with detailed cross-tabulated seropositivity estimates. Finally, we

391

have estimated model parameters using a single cross-sectional serosurvey. To improve estimates

392

and the ability to distinguish between model structures, future studies should use longitudinal sero-

393

surveys or case data stratified by race and ethnicity and corrected for underreporting; the challenge

394

will be ensuring that such data are systematically collected and made publicly available, which has

395

been a persistent barrier to research efforts [28]. Addressing these data barriers will also be key

396

for translating these and similar models into actionable policy proposals on vaccine distribution and

397

non-pharmaceutical interventions.

398

In summary, we have explored how deterministic transmission models can be extended to study the

399

dynamics of infection in racial and ethnic groups, and how the impact of heterogeneity on the HIT

400

and final epidemic size depends strongly on the details of how heterogeneity is modeled. We have

401

shown that due to early infections in individuals from the most at-risk groups, relative measures of

402

incidence may decline and even reverse, but inequities in the cumulative burden of infection persist

403

throughout the epidemic as the HIT is reached. These results describe a framework that can be ex-

404

tended to other cities and countries in which racial and ethnic disparities in seropositivity have been

405

observed [17, 61, 62] and are a step towards using transmission models to design policy interven-

406

tions for reducing disparities in COVID-19 and other diseases.

Variable susceptibility versus variable exposure models

414

The serosurvey data were compatible with variable susceptibility models in which Hispanics or Lati-

415

nos, non-Hispanic Black people, non-Hispanic Asians, and multiracial or other people had 2.25,

416

1.62, 0.86, and 1.28 times the susceptibility to infection relative to non-Hispanic whites in NYC, re-

417

spectively, and 4.32, 1.96, 0.92, and 2.48 times the susceptibility to infection relative to non-Hispanic

418

whites in Long Island, respectively. As with variable exposure models, these differences in suscep-

419

tibility lowered herd immunity levels and final epidemic sizes relative to the homogeneous model

420

(Supplementary Figure 1), but to a lesser extent; for instance, variable susceptibility models resulted

421

in HITs ∼10% greater than HITs under proportionate mixing for Long Island.

422

The difference between these models is that incorporating heterogeneity in susceptibility only af-

423

fects susceptible individuals, but heterogeneity in exposure impacts both susceptible and infectious

424

individuals: individuals from racial and ethnic groups with higher contact rates are both more likely

425

to be infected, and when infected, to infect a greater number of secondary cases. This contrast is

426

clear when comparing the next-generation matrices for each model, which lists the average number

427

of secondary infections caused by an infected individual from a given demographic group (Supple-

428

mentary Figures 2 and 3). The epidemic resolves at an earlier stage in variable exposure models

429

once these key transmission groups become immune because of this additional compound effect on

430

transmission.

431

Our results contrasting mechanistic variable exposure and susceptibility models are in line with the-

432

oretical studies, which also indicate that models incorporating heterogeneity in exposure have more

433

pronounced effects on HITs than models incorporating heterogeneity in susceptibility, assuming

434

comparable continuous distributions of exposure and susceptibility [4, 6]. Tkachenko et al. showed

435

that the HIT = 1 − (1/R0 )(1/λ) , where λ is either 1 + CV 2 for variable susceptibility models or

436

1 + CV 2 (2 + γs CV )/(1 + CV 2 ) for variable exposure models, and CV is the coefficient of variation

437

and γs is the skewness for the exposure distribution [6]. We calculated CV and skewness using the

438

susceptibility and total contact rate ratios and substituted those values into the HIT formula, which

439

is an approximation because our exposure and susceptibility distributions are discrete; nonetheless,

440

the approximations result in similar HIT curves to the simulation results (Supplementary Figure 4).

Sensitivity analyses

442

We conducted sensitivity analyses to assess whether assumptions on epidemic timing, and num-

443

ber and distribution of initial infected individuals affected parameter and HIT estimates. Varying

444

the timing of epidemic start did not substantially affect HIT estimates, as long as the time between

445

epidemic start and serosurvey ts was reasonable large (e.g., > 20 days) and assortativity was low

446

( < 0.8) (Supplementary Figure 14). The distribution and number of initial infected individuals also

447

did not substantially affect HIT estimates for low levels of assortativity ( < 0.8) (Supplementary

448

Figures 15 and 16). We limited our analyses to models with  less than 0.8.

Supplementary Figure 17: Rt calculation accounting for α (top) and without accounting for α

544

(bottom) for a mitigated epidemic trajectory. The model was fit to Long Island census and

545

serosurvey data, and mitigation was initiated on day 60 for 100 days with α = 0.4. The population

546

reaches the HIT due to mitigation measures in the top Rt trajectory at the circled time point and

547

remains above the HIT after mitigation measures are lifted. However, we are defining the HIT

548

relative to the unmitigated epidemic, which occurs when Rt crosses 1 in the bottom trajectory at the

549

circled time point. The interpretation is that even if all mitigation measures were lifted at this point,

550

the unmitigated population will still have reached the HIT.
