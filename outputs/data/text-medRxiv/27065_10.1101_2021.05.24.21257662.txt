Abstract
According to a report from the World Health Organization, the mortality and severity rates among
patients with cancer infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
are significantly higher than those of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 without complications.
Common and cancer-specific risk factors may be involved in the mortality and severity rates of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Various factors have been determined to contribute to the
aggravation of COVID-19 in patients with cancer. However, on the basis of current research, the
factors involved in the aggravation of COVID-19 in patients with cancer have not been fully
investigated. In the general course of treatment for patients with cancer, the detection of the formation
of metastases in other organs is common. Therefore, the present study investigates the association
between lung metastatic lesion formation and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. On the basis of the results
obtained, in the pulmonary micrometastatic niche of patients with ovarian cancer, alveolar epithelial
stem-like cells adjacent to the ovarian cancer were observed. Moreover, it was revealed that
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a host-side receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was expressed in alveolar
epithelial stem-like cells adjacent to the ovarian cancer in the pulmonary micrometastatic niche.
Furthermore, it was also observed that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain
binds to alveolar epithelial stem-like cells. In other words, it was suggested that patients with cancer
and pulmonary micrometastases may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. The prevention of de
novo niche formation in metastatic disease may be a new strategy for the clinical treatment of COVID19 for patients with cancer.
Introduction
The United States and other countries have found it difficult to contain the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic owing to the respiratory spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the inconsistent adherence to effective public health measures,
including wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. According to the reports of the World
Health Organization, the mortality rate of patients with cancer infected with SARS-CoV-2 is 7.6%,
which is a fairly high rate compared with the 1.4% mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2–infected
individuals without complications1. Among patients with cancer and COVID-19, the 30-day all-cause
mortality was high and associated with general and cancer-specific risk factors with a mortality rate
of 13.3%1,2. Moreover, the severity rate of patients with solid cancer infected with SARS-CoV-2 as
of August 2020 was extremely higher than that of all the SARS-CoV-2–infected patients according
to a report by the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare3. The reason why COVID-19
becomes more severe in patients with cancer is not fully understood. Consequently, immunity against
the virus may be reduced in patients with cancer receiving therapeutic anticancer agents4.
Lung stem cells that can regenerate lung tissue are used in research on lung disease, cancer, and
infectious diseases. Furthermore, preparing a lung culture model using lung stem cells in the
laboratory has become possible. However, the biological characteristics of human lung stem cells
have not been clarified. Therefore, research on the construction of a lung culture model, especially
the model of the most peripheral part of the lung where gas exchange is observed, has not progressed.
Research findings on human lung culture systems have been reported to model lung infections,
including SARS-CoV-2 infections that are responsible for COVID-19-associated pneumonia5,6.
Moreover, Kuo et al. succeeded in creating a human peripheral lung culture model using lung stem
cells5. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule-positive alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) stem cells
differentiate into AT2 progenitor cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which
plays a role as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, cytokeratin 5-positive lung stem cells
differentiate into bronchial and/or bronchiolar epithelial progenitor cells. In other words, the AT2
progenitor cells in a human peripheral lung culture model express ACE2, a host cell receptor for
SARS-CoV-25. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar epithelial stem cells.

In this study, it was shown that ACE2 was expressed in alveolar epithelial stem-like cells adjacent to
the ovarian cancer in the pulmonary micrometastatic niche. Furthermore, it was also observed that
the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to alveolar epithelial
stem-like cells. In other words, indicating that patients with cancer and pulmonary micrometastases
might be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Prevention of de novo niche formation in metastatic
disease may be a new strategy for the clinical treatment of COVID-19 for patients with cancer.
Materials and Methods
1. Case selection for immunohistochemical staining
To examine the biological and medical characteristics of pulmonary micrometastatic niche, four cases
(high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas) were selected from a total of 69 primary epithelial
ovarian cancers stained via immunohistochemical analysis with anti-human S100 calcium-binding
protein A4 (S100A4), which is used as a marker for ovarian cancer (Supplementary Table 1). Sixtynine consecutive patients with ovarian carcinoma visited Shinshu University Hospital (Matsumoto,
Nagano, Japan) between 1994 and 2003 and underwent surgery followed by combination
chemotherapy with taxane-based preparation and platinum preparation. The supplementary materials
show the detailed medical conditions of the patients.
2. Antibodies and immunohistochemistry (IHC)
IHC staining for S100A4, CD90(Thy1), ACE2, and RBD of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2
was performed on the tissue sections of pulmonary micrometastases of patients with high-grade
serous ovarian cancer. Tumor tissue sections were then incubated with the appropriate primary
antibodies at 4 °C overnight. These IHC experiments with human tissue sections were conducted
using standard procedures at Shinshu University (Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan) and National Hospital
Organization Kyoto Medical Center (Kyoto, Kyoto Japan) in accordance with institutional guidelines
(approval no. M192). The supplementary materials show the list of antibodies, which were used as
the primary or secondary antibody in our research experiments, as well as the detailed materials and
methods.
Results
Niches for promoting metastatic colonization were previously examined using the generation of
human-in-mouse ovarian cancer xenograft models in immunodeficient mice; i.e., CD34+ lineage
ovarian cancer stem-like cells sorted using the side population procedure were injected into the
mammary fat pads of BALB/c nu/nu mice. The cluster of differentiation 90 (CD90), which is also
called Thy1, is used as a marker for several stem cells7. S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4),
a member of the S100 calcium-binding protein family secreted by ovarian cancer cells, supports
tumorigenesis by stimulating angiogenesis7 (Supplementary Table 1). Pathological examinations
revealed the existence of S100A4-negative and CD90-positive stem-like cells in vimentin-positive
normal neighboring alveolar epithelial cells8. In the present study, our experiments demonstrate that
similarly, the initialization of mimicry represented the incomplete differentiation of normal alveolar
epithelial cells toward the stem-like lineage in the pulmonary micrometastasis of patients with ovarian
cancer (Figure 1).
The expression of ACE2, a host-side receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in CD90-positive alveolar epithelial
stem-like cells in the pulmonary metastatic niches of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer
is essential (Figure 1 and Table 1). Furthermore, histopathological analysis revealed that the RBD in
the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2-expressing CD90-positive alveolar epithelial
stem-like cells (Figure 1 and Table 1). Moreover, on the basis of such findings, SARS-CoV-2 is
deemed to infect the alveolar epithelial stem-like cells in the pulmonary micrometastasis of patients
with ovarian cancer.

From the results of previous studies, it has been reported that in the pulmonary micrometastatic niche
of other cancer types, the reprogramming of mimicry probably represents incomplete differentiation
of normal alveolar epithelial cells toward stem-like lineages. Presumably, pulmonary micrometastatic
niche is a target for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Discussion
The results showing that ovarian cancer cells form a metastatic niche near the alveolar stem cells is
reminiscent of a previous finding that demonstrates that when prostate cancer cells metastasize to the
bone, they settle near the stem cells in the bone marrow, which promotes the development of a
metastatic environment that supports tumor growth9. A recent report also described cancer-associated
parenchymal cells that exhibit stem cell-like features, the expression of lung progenitor markers,
multilineage differentiation potential, and self-renewal activity10.
Among patients with cancer and COVID-19, 30-day all-cause mortality has been reported to be high,
and various factors have been determined to contribute to COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer.
Within the pulmonary metastatic niche, alveolar epithelial cells adjacent to metastatic cancer cells are
initiated into alveolar epithelial stem-like cells. ACE2 has been expressed in alveolar epithelial stemlike cells, and the binding of alveolar epithelial stem-like cells to RBD of the spike glycoprotein of
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly observed. One of these factors is considered to be SARS-CoV-2 infection of
stem cells and/or epithelial progenitor cells present in the metastatic niche in patients with cancer. So
far, treatment aimed at reducing lung metastases has been limited to surgical treatment. However, in
clinical practice, the reduction of lung metastases has been observed in the treatment with immune
checkpoint inhibitors and/or PARP inhibitors. Furthermore, the efficacy of the anti-S100A4 antibody
drug in suppressing the metastatic ability of malignant tumors in other organs, including ovarian
cancer, has been investigated11. A longer follow-up is needed to better understand the effect of
COVID-19 on the treatment outcomes of patients with cancer, including the ability to continue
specific cancer treatments. In such a major intersection of cancer medicine and infectious diseases,
the prevention of de novo niche formation of metastatic disease may be a novel strategy for the clinical
treatment of COVID-19.

Figure 1. Binding of RBD in the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 to stem-like cells in normal
neighboring alveolar epithelial cells.
Immunohistochemical studies were performed using pulmonary metastasis tissue surgically excised
from a patient with serous ovarian carcinoma. The existence of human ACE2-positive (green) and
human CD90-positive (red) stem-like cells indicated by white arrowheads in human normal
neighboring alveolar epithelial cells was observed in pulmonary micrometastasis. Human CD90positive cells (red) are not detected in the metastatic colonies of human serous ovarian carcinoma.
Immunohistochemical studies were performed using an antibody for human ACE2 (green), a
monoclonal antibody for the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (green), and an antibody for human
CD90 (red) as a biomarker for stem-like cells. The binding of RBD in the spike glycoprotein of
SARS-CoV-2 (green) to CD90-positive (red) alveolar epithelial stem-like cells is observed, which
are indicated in yellow. Antihuman CD90 antibody (Abcam ab133350), antihuman ACE2 antibody
(ORIGENE, Rockville, MD, USA), anti-spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 antibody (GeneTex, Inc.,
CA, USA), and recombinant spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 protein (BioVision, CA, USA) are
used in immunohistochemistry studies. The experiments were performed five times with similar
results.
