Abstract:

The 2019 Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a single-stranded RNA virus
that has threatened the lives of humans all over the globe. Government officials, policy
makers and public health officials have been scrambling and struggling to “flatten the
curve” to decelerate the prevalence and spread of COVID-19 given the significant
economic destruction of the spread of the virus. Most “flatten the curve” models are
based on Compartmental Models. This preliminary research is based on six (6)
selected countries significantly impacted by COVID-19 and endeavors to build a new
model based on moving averages lagged at different time periods to better hone in on
the time the COVID-19 begins to decelerate using the date of first reported case and
date of first reported death. This new model, the Consistent Deceleration Model (CDM)
is based on each individual country’s date of Peak Increase in Mortality Rate (PINC
MR) and the Moving Average since the peak increase in mortality rate (MA POSTINC).
The CDM can be utilized of one of many quantitative tools to determine the strength of
the deceleration of an infectious outbreak.

Introduction
The 2019 Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a single-stranded RNA virus
that has threatened the lives of humans all over the globe (Cascella, Rajnik, Cuomo, Dulebohn &
Napoli, 2020). The new virus was confirmed a pandemic by the World Health Organization
(WHO) on March 11th 2020 and the primary symptom is a lower respiratory illness (WHO,
2020). The initial epidemiological investigations aimed the origin of COVID-19 in Wuhan,
China in December of 2019 and was officially reported to WHO on December 31, 2019 (World
Health Organization, 2020). The likely source of the virus is estimated at a 96% probability to
originate from bats with a potential but still unknown intermediate host between bats and humans
potentially being the pangolin (Andersen, Rambaut, Lipkin, Holmes, & Garry, 2020). The virus
is similar to previous viral outbreaks such as the 2012 to present Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that has a mortality rate of 35% and the 2002-2003 Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that had a mortality rate of 10% (Wu &
McGoogan, 2020).
COVID-19 is spread from human-to-human, and less understood from human-toanimal/animal-to-human via close contact, via direct contact with infected aerosols or touching
fomite that is why the practice of “social distancing” has been implemented in countries across
the world (CDC, 2020). While the virus has an incubation period of two (2) to fourteen (14)
days with a median of five (5) days for symptoms to show, the virus is unprecedented in its
asymptomatic group of carriers increasing unintentional spreading and proving difficult to track
both prevalence and incidence (Gandhi, Yokoe, & Havlir, 2020).
The first confirmed case in the United States was reported to have occurred on January
21st 2020 in Washington State when a 30 year old man returned from a trip to China who

initially had no symptoms until a fever the day of his hospital admission on January 16th 2020
(Holshue et al., 2020) and according to the CDC, the first COVID-19 death in the United States
occurred on February 29th 2019 in Washington State (CDC, 2020). However, Santa Clara
County in California was the first confirmed community infected with COVID-19, and
postmortem testing from February 6th through the 17th confirmed earlier COVID-19 infections
(Soucheray, 2020). The first reported case in China was on December 8th, 2020 (Wu &
McGoogan, 2020) and France reported the first COVID-19 case on January 24th, 2020, Germany
on January 27th, Italy on January 31st, and Spain on February 1st of 2020 (Johns Hopkins,
2020). Italy, Spain, France, and Germany surges in COVID-19 cases contributing to European
data reporting overall deaths to have increased 20-30% this year (Wu, McCann, Kat, & Peltier,
2020).
Pandemics and the Analytical Framework for “Flattening the Curve”
Politicians, policy makers and pubic safety officials have primarily deferred to public
health officials to “Flatten the Curve” to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and lessen the burden
on health care infrastructure (Branas, 2020) and prevent further spread and prevalence of
COVID-19. Flattening the curve is based on an epidemiological mathematical family of
Compartmental Models first discussed by Kermack, McKendrick and Walker (1927) and
Kermack and McKendrick (1933) and factors in the spread of disease and applied to epidemics
using time as a variable (Cooke, 1979). These models have evolved to include other variables
and vary in degree of statistical sophistication (Beretta, & Takeuchi, 1995) with the primary
variable as time and rate of infection, and using prior rates of infection over time to predict future
exposure and prevalence. The essential objective is to measure the spread over time and degree
of prevalence for the purpose of predicting the intensity of the increase in rate and if the increase

will continue in intensity or began to slow. This is critical for a number of reasons to ensure the
public safety and a healthy environment.
Methodology
The objective of this current exploratory analysis is to determine the moving average
change in mortality rate in three (3) day intervals of COVID-19 from initial onset of the
epidemic through peak increase while accounting for the changes over time. This analysis is
specific to six countries (the most consistent top five in terms of reported overall deaths from
COVID-19) and China, the country where the Index Case of COVID-19 was first reported
(World Health Organization, 2020). The top five (5) countries include the United States (US),
Italy, Germany, France, and Spain. This present analytical framework is an Integrated Moving
Average Model (IMAM) using time, and the preceding rate of mortality (MR) to determine when
the COVID-19 first displayed evidence of slowing in countries that remained in the top five (5)
for overall number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 and an added measure, the moving average
after the largest increase in change to predict the deceleration of the decrease.
The time series spans from March 15, 2020 (three days after COVID-19 was declared a
pandemic) through April 30, 2020. The time series data points were three (3) day intervals from
totaling seventeen (17) data points and sixteen (16) dynamic changes. The time series analytical
framework used was an Integrated Moving Average Model (IMAM) that tested the moving
average of the rate of mortality over time since the date the COVID-19 was declared a pandemic
by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 12th, 2020. The objective was to use the
accumulative mortality rate up to that moment and a dynamic measure on how that rate is
increasing or decreasing in each of the selected countries. This time span is critical when
comparing the six (6) countries to determine the overall rate of mortality, and how the rate of

mortality has decreased or increased in small units of time to accurately measure the prevalence.
The three (3) day time periods were selected to account for the lags in reporting deaths in each of
the countries, particularly with determining the cause of death as COVID-19 and the different
methods of reporting data in each country. Therefore, the three (3) day lag is intended to account
for these differences and standardize a time period in the series. The final variable to add a
predictive deceleration variable is the moving average since peak increase, the post peak increase
of mortality rate (MAPOST INC). This variable can determine the sustainability of the
deceleration of COVID-19 in the six (6) selected countries.
This model was constructed as a comparative analysis with several measures. The first
was the number of days from the first reported COVID-19 case to peak increase in mortality rate
(PINC MR). This measure is important for several reasons. The first is early recognition of a
new infectious disease and how and when the infectious disease is discovered, reported, and
addressed by authorities. Another important measure used is the number of days between day of
first reported death and PINC MR. This measure, and these two measures taken together can
formulate the speed, intensity, prevalence, and lethality of the infectious disease in a given
country.
Other measures in the analyses included the number of days between the date the
COVID-19 was first reported in each of the six (6) countries and peak increase in mortality rate
(PINC MR) and the number of days between the date of the first reported death in each of the six
(6) countries and PINC MR. These measures were added to determine the speed and intensity of
the spread of COVID-19 and to compare if there were significant differences in the expedience
of first reporting COVID-19 in the six (6) selected countries. The objective of this exploratory
analysis is to create and apply a time-series model to compare the time dimension of how the

initial outbreak of COVID-19 within the six (6) selected countries’ mortality rates began to show
signs of slowing and/or decelerating with the purpose to provide another analytical tool to assist
policy decisions.
These measures are particularly important for policy makers in determining emergency
response procedures such as shelter in place or suspending mass gatherings and public
transportation services. The last time series measure used to regress the IMAM is the rate of
mortality MA POSTINC since the day of the peak increase in mortality rate PINC MR. Once the
day of PINC MR is determined based on a lower rate of mortality in the next time interval, what
is the rate of mortality and how much is this rate of mortality decreasing. The model is designed
to establish a measure in that consecutive days or weeks of peak increase can signal a significant
deceleration of an infectious disease.

Results
The first day COVID-19 case was reported in the Index Country (China) was December
8, 2019. The next five (5) countries in chronological order are the United States (January 22,
2020), Germany (January 24, 2020), France (January 27, 2020), Italy (January 31, 2020), United
Kingdom (January 31, 2020) and Spain (February 2, 2020). The first reported COVID-19 death
in the Index Country (China) was January 21, 2020 followed by France (February 16, 2020),
Italy (February 23, 2020), United Kingdom (March 1, 2020),

deceleration in the change of rate of mortality. The model is designed to have the ability to
predict that a country must sustain three consecutive time periods of deceleration to consider a
decrease in COVID-19.
The Mean number of days from the first reported COVID-19 case from the day of peak
increase in mortality rate (PINC MR) was eighty-six (86) days. The number of days ranged
from forty-nine (49) (Spain) to 131 (China). The Mean number of days from the first reported
COVID-19 case from the day of the first reported death to PINC MR was fifty-one (51) days
ranging from twenty-five (25) days (Spain) to eighty-seven (87) days (China).

Peak Increase Change in Mortality Rate (PINC MR) and Moving Average Post Increase
(MA POSTINC) and evidence of Consistent Deceleration Model (CDM)
The most critical variables in the time series design was the day of peak increase in
change of mortality rate (PINC MR). The earliest PINC MR was experienced by Spain (25 days
from first reported death) and Italy (36 days from first reported death) on March 30th, 2020 in
that Spain’s mortality rate peaked at 19.3 and the PINC MR was 9.0. Italy’s mortality rate on
March 30th, 2020 was 20.5 and the PINC MR was 5.4. By contrast, the PINC MR for China
occurred on April 17th, 2020 (119 days after the first reported death), the United Kingdom was
on April 29th, 2020, (97 days from first reported death) and the PINC MR was not experienced in
the United States until May 2nd, 2020, 109 days after the first reported death. France (April 8th,
2020 PINC MR, 72 days after first reported death) and Germany (PINC MR, April 17th, 2020, 84

days after first reported death) were more aligned around the average days from first reported
death and PINC MR.
The overall of the objective was to create a tool to quantitatively predict deceleration of
reported cases of the virus based on a Moving Average since Peak Increase (MAPINC). The
MAPINC is the moving average of the reported deaths since the PINC MR. The Consistent
Deceleration Model (CDM) accounts for the PINC MR and the MAPINC and the MAPINC was
remain below the PINC MR for an extended period of time to display evidence that the virus is
slowing. For example, policy makers should adopt a decision that included at least four (4) or
more time periods (in the case of this analysis, 12 days) to determine if the virus has displayed
significant signs of deceleration. Based on the CDM used in this study period, Spain’s
MAPINC was 3.1 from March 30th, 2020 to May 2nd, 2020 and experienced four time periods of
a moving average death rate (MADR) on April 18th, 2020 and remained under 3.1 until May 2nd.
2020. Italy had a MPINC of 2.4 and on April 24th, 2020 started a four-time period CDM. As of
May 2nd, 2020, the United States and United Kingdom did not show signs of consistent slowing
based on the Consistent Deceleration Model (CDM).

Discussion
The Consistent Deceleration Model (CDM) is a work in progress using several moving
average models with dynamic and static data. Ideally, the CDM is also designed to be flexible
for each country and individual regions within countries where an outbreak is most susceptible.
The CDM is designed to predict consistent sustainable COVID-19 first starts to decelerate and
sustain deceleration based on individual occurrences and outbreaks in each country. This is
particularly important to determine given the intensive spread of the COVID-19 virus.
Additionally, this model was constructed to compare countries that were severely affected to
determine how the rate of acceleration and deceleration of the mortality rates varied by country.
This model should be utilized as one of many tools to determine the intensity and prevalence of
the outbreak and when there are quantifiable signs of a significant deceleration.
