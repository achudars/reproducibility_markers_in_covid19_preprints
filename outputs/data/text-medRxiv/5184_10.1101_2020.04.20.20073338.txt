Abstract
Estimates of the reproductive number for novel pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 are essential for
understanding the potential trajectory of the epidemic and the level of intervention that is
needed to bring the epidemic under control. However, most methods for estimating the basic
reproductive number (R0) and time-varying effective reproductive number (Rt) assume that the
fraction of cases detected and reported is constant through time. We explore the impact of
secular changes in diagnostic testing and reporting on estimates of R0 and Rt using simulated
data. We then compare these patterns to data on reported cases of COVID-19 and testing
practices from different United States (US) states. We find that changes in testing practices and
delays in reporting can result in biased estimates of R0 and Rt. Examination of changes in the
daily number of tests conducted and the percent of patients testing positive may be helpful for
identifying the potential direction of bias. Changes in diagnostic testing and reporting processes
should be monitored and taken into consideration when interpreting estimates of the
reproductive number of COVID-19.

Introduction
The initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States (US) were characterized by
difficulties in delivering and administering diagnostic tests (1). First, the real-time quantitative
PCR assay developed and distributed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) suffered from performance issues (2, 3). As a result, all initial and confirmatory testing
needed to be carried out by the CDC, which led to reporting delays and capacity issues early in
the epidemic (4, 5). Initially, tests were only administered to individuals with a history of travel
to certain countries or known contact with a positive case. By the time testing capacity
increased, state and local health departments were faced with heavy demand for COVID-19
testing. Only individuals meeting specific criteria could receive a test, and these criteria have
varied from state to state and over time (see Supporting Information (SI) Dataset).
Concurrently, mathematical modelers have been analyzing data on reported COVID-19 cases in
order to develop forecasts of future incidence and evaluate the potential impact of social
distancing and other control measures, often at the behest of policymakers and public health
officials. These models typically rely on estimates of the reproductive number of the virus. The
basic reproductive number (R0) is defined as the expected number of secondary infections
produced by an infectious individual in a fully susceptible population; this can be used to derive
the expected fraction of the population that will become infected in the absence of
interventions and the level of control and/or immunity that is needed to eliminate the
pathogen from circulation (6). The time-varying effective reproductive number (Rt) measures
the average number of secondary infections per case at each time-point in the epidemic (6),
and can be used for real-time monitoring of the impact of control measures (7–9). As control
measures are implemented and immunity increases in the population, Rt will decrease (6, 10).
The value of R0 can be estimated from the growth rate of the number of cases early on in the
epidemic and estimates of the distribution of the generation time (i.e. the time between
infection events of successive cases in a transmission chain) (11), whereas instantaneous values
of Rt can be estimated based on the time series of case notifications and the distribution of the
generation time (7). These methods have been shown to be robust to under-detection and
underreporting, so long as the probability that a true case is detected and reported remains
constant through time.
Here, we use simulations to explore the potential magnitude and direction of biases introduced
by changes in diagnostic testing and reporting practices similar to those occurring during the
early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US. We then compute preliminary estimates of R0
and Rt for different states, based on publicly available data from The COVID Track Project (12).
We examine changes in testing practices and trends of the cumulative number of tests reported
to evaluate the potential that these estimates are biased.
Results
Based on our simulations (Table S1, Fig. S1), the likelihood and degree to which R0 and Rt are
biased depends on the manner in which diagnostic testing practices and reporting changes over
time. When the fraction of incident cases detected and reported is constant over time and

testing capacity scales with the number of “true” cases, the number of confirmed positive cases
provides an unbiased estimate of R0, despite possible delays in the reporting process (Fig. 1A,
Fig. S2). In this instance, the percent of individuals testing positive is expected to be stable over
time. Estimates of Rt are also expected to be unbiased after the first 5-6 days (approximately
equal to the mean reporting delay), but lag 2-4 days behind in detecting a decrease in Rt below
the threshold value of 1 (i.e. when the epidemic is receding). If the fraction of true cases
detected and reported is increasing or decreasing linearly over time, estimates of R0 based on
the growth rate of confirmed cases will be over- or under-estimates, respectively, of the true R0
(Fig. 1B-C). The time-varying reproductive number, Rt, will also be slightly over- or
underestimated, especially early on when there is a reporting delay. A gradual increase or
decrease in the percent of individuals testing positive is a potential indicator of such bias.
However, the percent positive is also expected to decrease or increase over time if the testing
capacity expands more or less quickly than the number of true cases, respectively (Fig. 1D-E). In
this instance, estimates of R0 and Rt based on the number of confirmed cases are unbiased (Fig.
S2).

individuals per case between days 20 and 60. (E) The testing capacity decreases from 0.8 individuals per case to 0.2
individuals per case between days 20 and 60.

Abrupt changes to testing criteria, affecting the fraction of true cases detected and reported,
are also expected to bias estimates of R0 and lead to a large (up to two-fold) but temporary bias
in estimates of Rt (Fig. 2A-B). The potential for such bias may be indicated by a sudden change
in the percent of individuals testing positive, as well as a temporary change to the slope of the
log of cumulative cases. A similar change in the percent positive may also occur with an abrupt
change to the testing capacity (Fig. 2C-D). However, in this case, it is accompanied by a change
to the slope of the log of cumulative individuals tested, and estimates of R0 and Rt based on
fitting to the number of positive cases are not expected to be biased. The most difficult bias to
detect may be due to a change in the reporting delay distribution (Fig. 2E-F). In this case, the
percent positive is likely to remain roughly constant through time, but estimates of R0 and Rt
will be biased, especially when the reporting delay increases.

cases (green). (A) The fraction of true cases detected and reported increases from 5% to 15% on day 40. (B) The
fraction of true cases detected and reported decreases from 15% to 5% on day 40. (C) The testing capacity

0.8 individuals per case to 0.2 individuals per case on day 40. (E) The mean reporting delay increases from 6.6 days
to 13.2 days on day 40. (F) The mean reporting delay decreases from 6.6 days to 3.3 days on day 40.

When the bias is due to a change in the testing criteria, affecting the fraction of true cases
detected and reported, fitting models to the total number of individuals tested over time can
recover unbiased estimates of the reproductive numbers (Fig. S2-S3). Thus, when the percent
of positive tests is changing through time and there is uncertainty over whether it is due to
changes in the testing probability or the testing ratio, fitting models to both the number of
positive cases and the total number of tests may provide bounds on the uncertainty in
estimates of R0 and Rt. However, this approach cannot correct for bias due to changes in the
reporting delay distribution.
Based on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases across the US through March 24, 2020
(before any observable impact of social distancing measures, Fig. 3), and assuming a fixed serial
interval of 6.5 days, we estimate that R0 for the US is 3.45 (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.443.46, accounting only for uncertainty in the growth rate). Estimates of R0 for all 50 states and
the District of Columbia vary from 1.92 (95% CI: 1.61-2.27, South Dakota) to 5.17 (95% CI: 4.755.65, Missouri) (Table S2). Estimates of R0 based on the growth rate of the number of tests
performed are similar for the entire US, but are slightly larger on average for the individual
states (Table S2). Nationally, the percent of individuals testing positive for COVID-19 decreased
from 20-25% in early March to around 15% in mid-March. This early decline in the percent
positive is likely attributable to an increase in testing capacity, rather than a decrease in the
fraction of true cases detected and reported; therefore, estimates of R0 based on the number
of confirmed cases should be unbiased. However, trends in the percent of tests positive vary by
state (Fig. 4).

epidemic in late February/early March. In Washington and California, where COVID-19 cases in
the US were first recognized, estimates of Rt for early March were slightly lower (Fig. 4).
Nationally, Rt had decreased to less than 2 by March 24, 2020. In some states, Rt had already
declined substantially before stay-at-home orders were issued. As of April 5, 2020, which is the
last reliable day for which we could generate estimates, Rt was less than 1 (meaning the
epidemic was starting to decline) in 24 of 51 states, but was hovering around 1 in a number of
states (e.g. California) (Fig. 4, Fig. S4).

Nationally (and in most states), the percent of individuals testing positive for COVID-19 has
been gradually increasing since mid-March (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). This could be occurring either
because the fraction of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 detected and reported is
increasing, or because states are reaching their testing capacity and individuals more likely to

be infected are being prioritized for testing. If it is the former, our analysis suggests that the
more recent estimates of Rt may be upwardly biased. Moreover, temporary increases in Rt
around mid-March in states like New York and California might be due to early restrictions to
testing criteria. However, abrupt decreases in the percent of tests positive were generally due
to large increases in the total number of tests reported, and therefore should not reflect a bias
in estimates of Rt based on the number of confirmed cases.
Discussion
Over the first month and a half of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US, testing practices have
varied dramatically over time and from state to state (SI Dataset) (13). As of April 17, 2020, the
total number of tests reported per capita has varied from 5.7 tests per 1,000 people in Virginia
to 29.5 tests per 1,000 people in New York (12). Due to the limited availability of tests early on,
most states recommended that only those with a history of travel to affected countries or
known contact with a confirmed case be tested (4, 5). Since the disease has become more
widespread throughout the US and testing capacity has increased, testing guidelines have been
relaxed, but there are still considerable differences from state to state (SI Dataset). For
example, as of April 6, 2020, Washington state had no restrictions on who can be tested for
COVID-19, but prioritized hospitalized individuals and essential service providers exhibiting
symptoms (14). As of April 15, New York still recommended restricting testing to those with a
known positive contact or travel history, as well as symptomatic individuals who had tested
negative for other infections (15). As testing practices change over time, we have demonstrated
that these changes may introduce bias into estimates of R0 and Rt, affecting inference about
how much control is needed and when control measures have reduced transmission below the
critical threshold necessary to sustain the epidemic.
Our estimate of the mean R0 in the US of 3.45 is reasonably consistent with published
estimates. Early analyses from China report a range for R0 of 2.24-3.58, assuming a mean serial
interval of 8 days and a 2- to 8-fold increase in the reporting rate (16). However, more recent
analyses estimate a median R0 of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8, 8.9) (17). Analysis of data from Europe and
the US present a similarly high R0, with median values ranging from 4.0 to 7.1 when assuming a
serial interval of 6-9 days (18). Our estimated mean R0 is notably lower, but this was based on a
similar estimated growth rate of 0.275, suggesting the difference can be attributed to different
assumptions about the serial interval. Estimates of Rt have not been widely reported for the US,
but other studies have found that Rt decreased from 2-5 at the start of the epidemic to ~1
following travel restrictions in Wuhan and various European countries (19, 20), which is in line
with our findings.
Monitoring the number of tests performed and the percent of tests that are positive over time
can help to indicate the potential for bias in estimates of reproductive numbers. However, the
reporting of test results, particularly for negative tests, has been inconsistent in many states. In
California, for example, there was a more than eight-fold increase in the number of negative
tests reported on March 13, and another four-fold increase on April 4, 2020 (12). These large
increases in the number of negative tests were not accompanied by a corresponding increase in

the number of confirmed cases. Thus, while estimates of R0 and Rt based on the number of
confirmed cases are not expected to be influenced by these abrupt changes in the number of
reported tests, it becomes difficult to interpret the intervening gradual increases in the percent
of tests positive.
It is more difficult to detect whether the time between onset of infectiousness and the
reporting of test results (i.e., the reporting delay) has changed over time. Our simulations
suggest that such changes could bias estimates of R0 and Rt, but would not be reflected in the
percent of individuals testing positive over time. Individual-level data on the date of symptom
onset, date of testing, and date of reporting are needed to resolve this potential bias. Estimates
of Rt are also expected to lag behind true changes in the transmission rate due to reporting
delays. Now-casting approaches may be useful for resolving this by inferring the number of
infections occurring on each day based on the observed cases, hospitalizations and deaths, and
known reporting delays (21).
Imminent decisions regarding the lifting of stay-at-home orders and loosening social distancing
requirements, and when such measures may need to be reinstated, depend on having a good
understanding of current levels of transmission. Reliable estimates of the reproductive number
are essential for quantifying the impact of control measures on transmission and making
informed decisions about future interventions, e.g. (7, 19, 20, 22, 23). However, changes in
testing policies and practices, as well as delays in the reporting process, can lead to bias in
estimates of the reproductive number, as we have demonstrated. It important to carefully
document and track such changes in testing and reporting practices in order to make correct
inferences.

Methods
Examining the impact of changes in testing using simulated data
We simulated a stochastic SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model to explore the
potential impact of changes in testing practices on estimates of R0 and Rt. We modeled a
population of 1 million individuals and initialized the epidemic with 10 infectious individuals to
minimize the chances of early epidemic fadeout. We assumed everyone else was susceptible at
the start of the epidemic. New infections were assumed to arise according to a Poisson process
(approximate method); the state transitions and rates are described in Table 1, and model
parameters are given in Table 2. We simulated the model to day 70 using a time-step of
t=0.05 days, and assumed a decrease in the transmission rate occurring on day 50, consistent
with the impact of social distancing interventions. Models were run using MATLAB v9.3
(MathWorks, Natick, MA); code is available from
https://github.com/vepitzer/COVIDtestingbias.

(consistent with R0~3
and Rt~1)
(24)
(24)

We tracked the number of “true cases” on day d (Yd) as the number of individuals entering the
infectious period each day. We assumed that each true case occurring on day d had a
probability ptest(d) of being tested, and that for every true case that occurred on day d, there
were ntest(d) individuals with similar symptoms who were tested. Furthermore, we assumed
that testing and reporting of positive tests occurred with some delay d(t), which followed a
gamma distribution with parameters ad and bd. Thus, we calculated the number of individuals
tested (Td) and the number of positive cases (Cd) on day d as follows:
𝑑

𝑇𝑑 = ∑ 𝑛test (𝑖)𝑌𝑖 𝜌𝑖 (𝑑 − 𝑖)
𝑑

𝑖=1

𝐶𝑑 = ∑ 𝐵𝑖𝑛(𝑌𝑖 , 𝑝test (𝑖)𝜌𝑖 (𝑑 − 𝑖))
𝑖=1

We rounded the value of Td to the nearest integer and sampled Cd as binomial random variable.
We allowed for the observation of cases occurring up to day 95 (even though no new cases
were modeled after day 70) to examine the impact of the reporting delay on estimates of Rt.
As our base case, we assumed that the probability of a “true case” being tested was ptest=0.1
and the number of individuals tested for each true case was ntest=0.5; we assumed a mean
reporting delay between onset of infectiousness and testing results of 6.6 days (24). We then
modelled scenarios in which the fraction of true cases detected and reported (as indicated by
ptest) and the testing capacity (i.e. number of individuals tested for every true cases, ntest) either
increased or decreased linearly between days 20 and 60 of the epidemic. To examine the
impact of sudden changes to the probability of a true case being tested (e.g. associated with
changes in testing criteria) and testing capacity (e.g. associated with new companies entering
the market), we also explored scenarios in which ptest and ntest increased or decreased abruptly
on day 40 (Table S1). Finally, we examined the effect of a two-fold increase or decrease in the
average reporting delay.
Estimation of R0 from simulated data
We estimated R0 from the growth rate of the epidemic, as described by Lipsitch et al (11):
𝑅0 = 𝑟 2 𝑓(1 − 𝑓)𝑉 2 + 𝑟𝑉 + 1,
where r is the growth rate, V is the serial interval (also known at the generation interval), and f
is the proportion of the serial interval spent in the latent period. The growth rate (r) was
determined by fitting Poisson regression models to the cumulative number of “true cases” (Yd)
and reported cases (Cd) on days d=21 to 40. Thus, we implicitly assumed that cases occurring
over the first 20 days of the epidemic are unlikely to have been recognized. We assumed that
the serial interval is equal to the sum of the average latent period and the average infectious
period (V=1/ + 1/), and that the proportion of the serial interval spent in the latent period is
f=1/(V). We estimated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for our estimate of R0 by incorporating
uncertainty in the estimated growth rate, but did not incorporate uncertainty in f or V.
Estimation of Rt from simulated data
We estimated Rt using the Wallinga-Teunis method (7). This is a likelihood-based framework
that infers the estimated number of secondary cases per case at each point in time based on
information about the generation interval. First, the relative likelihood that case i was infected
by case j is estimated based on the probability distribution of the difference in the time of
symptom onset (ti – tj), over the probability that case i was infected by any other case k:
𝑝𝑖𝑗 = 𝑔(𝑡𝑖 − 𝑡𝑗 )⁄∑

𝑖≠𝑘

𝑔(𝑡𝑖 − 𝑡𝑘 )

where g(x) is the probability distribution function for the generation interval. We assume all
cases are equivalent in terms of infectiousness. Thus, to estimate Rt based on the number of
“true” cases, this can be rewritten as:
𝑡𝑖 −1

𝑝𝑖𝑗 = 𝑔(𝑡𝑖 − 𝑡𝑗 )⁄ ∑ 𝑔(𝑡𝑖 − 𝑡)𝑌𝑡 .
𝑡=1

We do not allow for values of the generation interval less than or equal to zero; thus, we
assume all cases were infected by a case that occurred on an earlier day. While this is not
necessarily true when accounting for possible reporting delays, we make the same assumption
when estimating Rt based on the number of reported cases. We assumed that the generation
interval was gamma distributed with a mean of 6.5 days and coefficient of variation of 0.62,
consistent with data from Flaxman et al (20):
𝑔(𝑥)~𝐺𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑎(4.79,1.357).
Second, the reproductive number for case j is estimated by calculated the weighted sum of pij
over all cases i:
𝑅𝑗 = ∑ 𝑝𝑖𝑗 .
𝑖

Again, assuming all cases are equally infectious, this becomes:
𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥

𝑅𝑡 = ∑ 𝑝𝑢𝑡 𝑌𝑢 .
𝑢=𝑡+1

To estimate Rt based on the number of true cases, we set tmax=70 and estimate Rt up to day 60.
We correct for right-censoring of the case data by dividing our estimates of Rt by the cumulative
distribution function of the generation interval (G(x)) for tmax – t:
𝑅𝑡 = 𝑅𝑡 /𝐺(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝑡).
To explore the potential influence of the reporting delays, we estimate Rt based on the
reported positive cases for tmax=70 and tmax=95.
COVID-19 testing data for the United States
Daily data on the reported number of positive and negative tests for COVID-19 in the US and by
state were downloaded from www.covidtracking.com on April 18, 2020 (12). The COVID
Tracking Project data comes from state/district/territory public health authorities, and
occasionally, from trusted news sources, official press conferences, or (rarely) social media
updates from state public health authorities or governors [12]. All data sources are
documented in a spreadsheet. We analyzed the data from March 4, 2020, onward, as this is the
first date that negative tests for COVID-19 were consistently reported for the entire US.
Testing practices vary considerably between states, and some states changed their guidelines a
few weeks into the outbreak, depending on test availability, outbreak intensity, and health
systems infrastructure. We extracted information on COVID-19 testing criteria from each state’s
website during the week of March 23 and again during the week of April 13. Data sources are
documented in the SI Dataset.
For example, as of March 13, Louisiana recommended testing for people with fever, respiratory
symptoms, and a negative influenza test, with priority given to the following categories:
• Hospitalized patients with a severe respiratory illness with no other known cause.
• Suspected outbreak of COVID-19 among associated individuals with recent onset of similar
fever and lower respiratory symptoms.

•

Recent fever and lower respiratory symptoms in a healthcare worker with direct contact to
a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case.
• Suspected COVID-19 in a patient associated with a high-risk exposure setting such as a longterm care facility or a correctional facility.
• Suspected COVID-19 in a homeless patient.
However, as of April 15, anyone with fever and respiratory symptoms was eligible to be tested,
regardless of influenza status, and pharmacists were given permission to order and administer
COVID-19 tests for the duration of the public health emergency.
Estimation of R0 from state-level testing data
To estimate R0 from data on the number of reported positive COVID-19 cases in the US and
different states, we fitted Poisson regression models to the first three weeks of data (March 4
through March 24, 2020) to estimate the growth rate. For states that did not report any cases
early on, the Poisson regression models were fitted to the data beginning the first day a
positive case was reported through March 24. This is approximately one week after the national
“15 Days to Slow the Spread” guidelines were announced (on March 16, 2020) (25). We
assumed that the mean serial interval was 6.5 days and that the average latent period was 4.6
days, based on (20). We calculated 95% CIs for the R0 estimates based on uncertainty in the
estimated growth rate, but did not account for uncertainty in the serial interval or latent
period.
Estimation of Rt from state-level testing data
Estimates of the time-varying reproductive number in each state were generated using the
Wallinga-Teunis method described above. We again assumed that the generation interval was
gamma distributed with a mean of 6.5 days and coefficient of variation of 0.62 (20). Estimates
after April 5, 2020, are increasingly uncertain because <95% of secondary cases are expected to
have occurred by the end of the available data (based on the cumulative distribution function
of the generation interval). For later dates, we present both the uncorrected estimates and
estimates corrected for right-censoring, as described above.

Fig. S2. Estimates of the basic reproductive number, R0, based on simulated data. Estimated
values of R0 based on the growth rate in the number of “true” cases (black), number of
confirmed cases (blue), and number of tests performed (red) are plotted for the modelled
scenarios described in Table 3. The mean value is represented by the open circle, vertical lines
represent 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on uncertainty in the growth rate. The grey
horizontal line represents the mean value of the “true” R0 across all scenarios.

Fig. S4. Estimated time-varying reproductive numbers for 50 US states and the District of
Columbia. Estimates of the time-varying reproductive number, Rt, based on the number of
confirmed cases (green) and the total number of tests performed (red) are plotted for each
state for March 4 to April 17, 2020, along with the percent of tests positive (purple). April 5 is
the last day that the value of Rt can be reliably estimated; uncorrected (grey) and corrected
(black) values of Rt are plotted for April 2 to April 16. Value of Rt based on the number of tests
are corrected for right-censoring.
