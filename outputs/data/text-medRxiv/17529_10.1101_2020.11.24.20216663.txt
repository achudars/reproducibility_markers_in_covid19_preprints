Summary

27

Humoral immunity to the Severe Adult Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus (CoV)-

28

2 is not fully understood yet but may be a crucial factor of immune protection. The possibil-

29

ity of antibody cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses

30

(HCoVs) would have important implications for immune protection but also for the develop-

31

ment of specific diagnostic ELISA tests. Using peptide microarrays, n=24 patient samples

32

and n=12 control samples were screened for antibodies against the entire SARS-CoV-2

33

proteome as well as the Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), VME1 (V), R1ab, and Protein 3a

34

(AP3A) of the HCoV strains SARS, MERS, OC43 and 229E. While widespread cross-reac-

35

tivity was revealed across several immunodominant regions of S and N, IgG binding to

36

several SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides provided statistically significant discrimination be-

37

tween COVID-19 patients and controls. Selected target peptides may serve as capture

38

antigens for future, highly COVID-19-specific diagnostic antibody tests.

Introduction

46
47

The COVID-19 pandemic hit the world unprepared. At the time of writing global cases

48

were in the millions and still rising [WHO, 2020]. Apart from social distancing, rapid testing

49

of suspected cases and contacts is the key measure helping to contain the infection. The

50

experience from many countries has shown that imprecise or incomplete knowledge of in-

51

fection prevalence and viral transmission rates may result in a wrong assessment of the

52

epidemiological situation, wrong predictions, and inadequate guidance and action with po-

53

tentially grave consequences for societies and national economies. These observations

54

underline the global need for reliable and highly specific tests.

55

SARS-CoV-2 infection is generally confirmed by RT-PCR on swabs taken from the nose

56

and throat, however, virus load quickly becomes unmeasurable following the acute infec-

57

tion. Reliable serological monitoring will therefore be instrumental in determining the

58

SARS-CoV-2 infection status of larger populations, determine existing immunity, and track

59

local outbreaks [Pollán et al., 2020]. In the near future it may also greatly contribute to as-

60

sessing vaccine-induced immunity at the population level. However, SARS-CoV-2 anti-

61

body testing is much more complex than appears at first glance. Currently available anti-

62

body tests are not very specific and may produce conflicting results [Krammer and Simon,

63

2020; Lisboa Bastos et al., 2020; Bond et al., 2020]. A plausible reason for that might be

64

that antibody tests have generally been validated by samples from clinically symptomatic

65

rather than mild or even asymptomatic cases. However, the reason for the overall unreli-

66

able performance of antibody tests is not fully understood. Interestingly, it has been sug-

67

gested that, particularly in mild and asymptomatic cases, IgG responses may not be de-

68

tectable until 3-4 weeks after infection [Fafi-Kremer et al., 2020] which may compound the

69

issue.

70

A large number of studies have examined antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 [Siracu-

71

sano et al., 2020]. Most of these used full-length proteins as capture antigens and thus

72

have not identified reactivity at the single epitope level. Only few references [Amrun et al.,

73

2020; Farrera-Soler et al. 2020; Poh et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Zhang1 et al., 2020]

74

including preprints [Zhang2 et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2020; Dahlke et al., 2020; Ladner et

75

al., 2020] provide more detailed information on antibody specificity. Most of these studies

76

comprise small sample numbers (n ≤ 10) and only one of them [Ladner et al., 2020] exam-

77

ined cross-reactivity with other HCoVs despite in silico analysis indicating that significant

78
5
6

cross-reactivity is to be expected [Ahmed et al., 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020].

Here we present a first study of the humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 at the

80

single linear peptide epitope level covering all SARS-CoV-2 antigens as well as the S, N, E

81

and M proteins of the pandemic/epidemic-related human Severe Adult Respiratory Syn-

82

drome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV

83

and MERS-CoV), and, in addition, the seasonal cold-related strains human coronavirus

84

OC43 and 229E. Our results provide deeper insight into the immune response to HCoVs

85

than previously published work which could pave the way to SARS-CoV-2 specific and reli-

86

able COVID-19 diagnostic test development.

Results

92

Identification of immunodominant epitopes

93

Serum samples from COVID-19 patients analyzed by peptide microarray technology ex-

94

hibited high levels of antibody reactivity, whereas almost no reactivity was detected with

95

control samples. Several immunodominant regions were identified. These were located

96

primarily on the SARS2 S and N proteins (Figure 1, Supplementary Figures 1-6). There

97

was also strong IgG reactivity to several peptides derived from the SARS2 M, AP3A and

98

R1AB proteins, however, immune dominance was less pronounced in these proteins

99

(Supplementary Figures 3, 5 and 6). All remaining SARS2 antigens demonstrated no or

100

only minor immunogenicity in terms of IgG response.

101

For quantitative characterization of the identified immunodominant regions, responses in

102

SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were compared to those in the control group for each

103

single peptide and for combinations of three, four and five peptides by the non-parametric

104

Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Results for selected peptide hits and the best combinations

105

thereof are presented in Figure 2. Table 1 shows a selection of identified epitopes repre-

106

sented either by single peptides or by common core sequences derived from two or more

107

overlapping peptides. To narrow down the identified immunodominant peptides to the po-

108

tential immunodominant epitope sequences, the peptides with the highest accuracy scores

109

(calculated as the sum of true positive and true negative divided by the total number of ob -

110

servations) were listed in the order of appearance in the corresponding antigens. If appli -

111

cable, sequence overlaps were marked in red. A complete list of peptides showing the

112

most significant discrimination between SARS-CoV-2 infected and the control group can

113

be found in Supplementary Table 2.

114
115

Microarray assay results strongly correlate with a commonly used diagnostic test

116

To evaluate the diagnostic potential of a peptide-based assay, a comparison with a com -

117

monly used diagnostic test utilizing a full-length viral antigen was performed. Figure 3

118

shows the quantitative results obtained for the SARS-CoV-2 infected group with a) the

119

commercial ELISA test (EUROIMMUN) and b) the peptide microarray. Both assays

120

demonstrated a strong correlation with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.88.

124

Antibody cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal common cold coronaviruses

125

may be highly important with respect to the clinical course of COVID-19 and at the same

126

time represents a challenge for the development of a specific test. We, therefore, analyzed

127

IgG reactivity to peptides derived from the S, N, E, and M proteins of SARS-CoV, MERS-

128

CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E (Supplementary Table 1) in both groups. This re-

129

vealed highly similar IgG binding profiles against the N and M proteins of SARS-CoV-2

130

and SARS-CoV, whereas the corresponding proteins of the remaining viral strains showed

131

only weak and scattered signals (Supplementary Figures 1 and 3). Most notably, pep-

132

tides derived from the S protein of all viral strains showed clear signal patterns among

133

SARS-CoV-2 positive patient samples, suggesting that this antigen contained cross-reac-

134

tive determinants (Supplementary Figure 2). IgG reactivity was directed at two sequence

135

regions in particular (Figure 4). Each of these regions was represented by overlapping

136

peptides containing highly conserved cross-reactive epitopes (Figure 4, right panel). One

137

consensus motif, R0815S-IED-LF0823 (numbers referring to the location of the epitope in the

138

SARS2 antigen) was present in all five viruses, and a second consensus motif, F1148--

139

ELD--FKN1158 was found in the viruses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-Cov and HCoV-

140

OC43, but not HCoV-229E.

141

To further analyze serologic cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients against com-

142

mon cold coronaviruses we performed a gapless alignment of the N and S sequences

143

from all coronaviruses (Figure 5). For each strain, this yielded the sequence regions that

144

were complementary to the previously identified SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Finally, for each of

145

the amino acid residues of the thus identified sequences, the median signal of all overlap -

146

ping peptides containing that residue was calculated and visualized by the same colour

147

coding as in the previously presented heatmaps (Figure 5). The immunodominant epi-

148

topes #6 and #7 of the N protein and #1 and #3 of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (see Ta-

149

ble 1 for a list of the sequences) displayed strong signals with samples from SARS-CoV-2

150

infected individuals compared to the control samples. At the same time, no signals were

151

found for the homologous sequences of the other coronavirus strains, indicating that IgG

152

responses to these epitopes may be truly specific for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5, Top).

153

SARS-CoV-2 epitopes #1-#5 of the N and #2 and #6 of the S protein showed a strong ho-

154

mology to SARS-CoV which resulted in serologic cross-reactivity to this virus (Figure 5,

155

Middle). Finally, epitopes #4 and #5 of the S protein were the least SARS-CoV-2 specific

156

and exhibited considerable cross-reactivity between all sequence variants (Figure 5, Bot-

157

tom).

Discussion

160

The work presented here used a systematic approach that provides deeper insight into the

161

humoral immune response to HCoVs and lays a fundament for the development of specific

162

serological tests of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The approach is based on four pillars: (i) pep -

163

tide microarray based analysis of the humoral immune response against the entire SARS-

164

CoV-2 proteome and other HCoV proteomes, (ii) identification of all immunodominant epi -

165

topes at high resolution, (iii) selection of SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are recognized by

166

serum antibodies of COVID-19 patients but not by serum antibodies from controls and (iv)

167

selection of SARS-CoV-2 peptides whose homologous peptides in other HCoVs are not

168

recognized by serum antibodies from COVID-19 patients.

169
170

Our analysis of IgG responses of COVID-19 patients against all peptides of the SARS-

171

CoV-2 proteome revealed that IgG binding was mainly focused on both the S and N pro-

172

teins, indicating that these two proteins are indeed immunodominant (Figure 1, Supple-

173

mentary Figures 1-6). The fact that the M, AP3A and R1ab proteins were also recog-

174

nized, however, shows that responses are not exclusive to S and N. It remains to be re-

175

solved in future studies if the most dominant immune responses against certain antigens

176

are also the most effective responses concerning disease protection.

177

Applying stringent bioinformatic criteria we identified several linear epitopes that were im-

178

munodominant among SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (Table 1). Previous analyses of anti-

179

body epitopes in SARS-CoV revealed that many such epitopes were indeed linear [Guo et

180

al., 2004; Shichijo et al., 2004]. Interestingly, some immunodominant regions in the N and

181

S proteins that have been previously reported in the literature [Poh et al., 2020; Amrun et

182

al., 2020] correspond closely to epitopes #3 from N and #1 and #4 from S (Table 1), re-

183

spectively. This confirms our findings and illustrates the potential of the peptide microar-

184

rays for epitope identification. Longer sequence stretches encompassing some of the epi -

185

topes identified here have also been described in published manuscripts [Wang et al.,

186

2020; Farrera-Soler et al., 2020; Zhang1 et al., 2020] or in non-peer-reviewed preprint

187

publications, however, without narrowing them down [Zhang2 et al., 2020; Smith et al.,

188

2020; Dahlke et al., 2020]. With our comprehensive peptide library we further completed

189

the list of the previously described immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 regions and specified

190

the corresponding epitopes.

192

The most important question with respect to developing a reliable diagnostic test was,

193

however, whether the IgG response to the identified SARS2-specific peptides can effec-

194

tively distinguish COVID-19 patients and controls. This was indeed the case, as a compari-

195

son of serum reactivity in COVID-19 patients versus the control group, peptide by peptide,

196

identified many peptides to which responses were significantly different between the

197

groups (Table 1, Figure 2A). The combination of selected peptides derived from different

198

SARS-CoV-2 antigens further improved the discrimination between the sample groups as

199

shown in Figure 2B, and also might increase sensitivity when applied in a diagnostic test.

200

As a further step to assess the diagnostic potential of the obtained data, the quantitative

201

results obtained with the peptide microarrays were compared with those generated by a

202

commercial ELISA test (Figure 3). We observed a very strong correlation what suggests

203

that a combination of short linear synthetic peptides may be used for the development of a

204

diagnostic test instead of full-length antigens. Moreover, as it was found that only a small

205

proportion of all peptides forms B cell epitopes, the selection of peptides must not neces -

206

sarily span the whole antigen, but might be limited to immunodominant regions identified

207

by a peptide microarray screening.

208
209

Multiple studies utilizing in silico prediction of SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity [Wang et al.,

210

2020; Yuan et al., 2020; Palm et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2020] postulated the existence of

211

cross-reactive immunity between different coronaviruses, in particular between SARS-

212

CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, because several known B-cell and T-cell target peptides in SARS-

213

CoV exist almost identically in SARS-CoV-2. Cross-reactive T cell epitopes were experi-

214

mentally confirmed by several authors [Braun et al., 2020; Mateus et al., 2020] and some

215

degree of B cell cross reactivity to HCoVs has been identified by western blot analysis of

216

full length antigens [Bonifacius et al., 2020]. However, there is still a lack of experimental

217

data identifying cross-reactive B cell epitopes. We found two immunodominant regions in

218

the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (1148-FKEELDKYFKN-1158 and 0815-RSFIEDLLF-0823)

219

which were highly cross-reactive with the prevalent seasonal "common cold" coron-

220

aviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E (Figure 4). A similar result obtained with a different

221

assay based on 30-mer peptide cDNA-fusion pools in a non-peer review publication con-

222

firms our findings [Ladner et al., 2020].

223

The identified cross-reactivity is of particular interest, as it suggests that exposure to com -

224

mon cold HCoVs may provide a degree of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. The presence of

225

such preexisting immunity may have a positive impact on the course and outcome of

226
15
16

COVID-19. Arguments against this hypothesis are, however, that it has been reported that

227

the common cold coronaviruses generate only a weak and transient humoral immune re-

228

sponse [Huang et al., 2020] and that reconvalescents from SARS1 – a virus that is struc -

229

turally more closely related to SARS2 than the common cold coronaviruses – did not have

230

SARS2 neutralization titers in plasma [Lv et al., 2020]. Of note, preexisting immunity could

231

also be detrimental, as it may inhibit production of antibodies with certain specificity, i.e. a

232

phenomenon called original antigenic sin. This phenomenon may be responsible for inef -

233

fective vaccine response to a recently developed Cytomegalovirus vaccine [Baraniak et

234

al., 2019]. Even worse, existing antibodies could promote infection of target cells by facili -

235

tating viral uptake, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement [Fierz et al.,

236

2020; Arvin et al., 2020]. Our results demonstrate that some of the patient sera, e.g. num-

237

bers SARS_20 to SARS_23, show stronger reactivity towards the HCoV-OC43 variant of

238

the cross-reactive epitope II than to the respective SARS-CoV-2 epitope (Figure 4). This is

239

an interesting observation as there is no other logical explanation for this than that the anti-

240

body was made in response to the HCoV-OC43 virus in a previous HCoV-OC43 infection.

241

A number of additional peptides that led to strong IgG responses (Figure 4) support the

242

notion of preexisting B cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in those exposed to other coron-

243

aviruses. It will be up to future studies with larger cohorts to determine whether preexisting

244

immunity has an effect on disease severity.

245
246

While the physiological effects of serologic cross-reactivity require further studies, it is ob -

247

vious that it makes the development of reliable antibody tests more difficult. Antibody

248

based ELISA tests that use full-length conformational antigens or parts thereof as capture

249

antigens might give false positive results in individuals with previous exposure to common

250

cold coronaviruses. In this regard, the usage of the S protein antigen in a diagnostic test

251

might be particularly problematic due to several known homologous regions between

252

SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. The detailed analysis of IgG reactivity against

253

SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E S and N proteins indeed revealed

254

widespread cross-reactivity in several immunodominant regions (Figure 4), which is most

255

probably a consequence of sequence homology. However, the observed cross-reactivity

256

could not be predicted by simple sequence alignment unless 100% homology was present.

257

With a view to develop a diagnostic test, our finding that epitopes #6 and #7 of N and #1

258

and #3 of S appear to provide a high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5) is of major in-

259

terest. A combination of such epitopes in a peptide ELISA may increase sensitivity without

260

increasing the risk of false positives.

262

In conclusion, our study experimentally confirms antibody cross-reactivity between SARS-

263

CoV-2 and other HCoVs, but at the same time reveals antibody reactivity to several epi-

264

topes that are unique to SARS-CoV-2. These epitopes are of particular interest for the de-

265

velopment of diagnostic tests. Additional, larger studies are required to confirm these re-

266

sults and accelerate the development of a sensitive and specific test for SARS-CoV-2 in-

267

fection that we urgently need in order to deal with the current and possible future waves of

268

this pandemic.

tein (N) and Spike glycoprotein (S) measured in human sera. Heatmaps represent two groups

292

of serum samples: SARS-CoV-2 infected and control groups. The two upper rows of the heatmaps

293

reflect signals obtained with detection antibody only (no serum). Columns represent peptide se-

294

quences, rows represent samples. Colours indicate the signal values obtained from triplicate spots

295

ranging from white (0 or low intensity) over yellow (middle intensity) to red (maximal intensity of

296

65535 light units). The two upper rows of the heatmaps reflect signals obtained with detection anti-

297

body only (no serum). The right column in each heatmap reflects the highest possible signal inten-

298

sity. Box plots show the signal distribution in each group for selected immunodominant regions.

The Spearman's correlation coefficient between the ELISA signal and the summed microarray sig-

310

nals for SARS-CoV-2 S and N peptides was calculated for sera from SARS-CoV-2 infected pa-

311

tients. In the ELISA assay, which used a recombinant S glycoprotein as capture antigen, the quo-

312

tient of the extinction of the patient sample in comparison to the calibrator was used as net assay

signal. The total microarray signals for each sample were calculated as a sum of all corresponding

314

signal intensities above the upper 10-16% quantile of the noise distribution.

METHOD DETAILS

345
346

Blood sampling. Following written informed consent peripheral blood samples were ob-

347

tained by vene puncture / from periperal venous catheters. Multiple samples were col-

348

lected into a Vacutainer Tube (Serum-separating tube) with a volume of 8 ml. Serum was

349

collected after centrifugation, samples were allowed to clot for 1 hour, and the clot was re-

350

moved by centrifugation. The samples were divided and stored in aliquots at −80°C until

351

use.

352
353

RT-PCR RNA collection according to Guidelines of the CDC. Samples were collected

354

from the upper respiratory tract using a nasopharyngeal (NP) with plastic by trained medi -

355

cal staff. In the case of the NP the swab was inserted deeply into the nostril until resis-

356

tance was encountered and the depth was equal to the distance from the nose to the ears

357

of the patients. The swab was gently rubbed against the nasopharynx and left there in or -

358

der to absorb enough secret. Swabs were then immediately placed into a sterile transport

359

tube. Samples were cooled and tested no more than 48 hours after collection.

360
361

Participants.

362

Controls: Controls consist of excess serum samples collected in accordance to the regula-

363

tions for the use of rest samples for scientific purposes at the KH Labor. All samples have

364

been collected from form patients hospitalized in April 2020. Sera in the control group

365

tested negative for COVID-19 infection in the EUROIMMUN IgG Elisa Test. We used sam-

366

ples from different specialties, including cardiology, gastroenterology, nephrology and the

367

intensive care unit.

368

SARS-CoV-2 infected group: COVID-19 patients (n=13 female, age range 23 to 70 years;

369

n=11 male, age range 35 to 70 years) were recruited across the spectrum of clinical sever -

370

ity, ranging from asymptomatic/mild to severe/SARS. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed

371

either by diagnostic PCR and/or commercial ELISA carried out 14 days or later after the

372

onset of symptoms. Detailed information on all patients and samples is provided in Sup-

373

plementary Table 3.

374

Inclusion/exclusion criteria were: Fully conversant in the German or English language, able

375

and willing to attend to the study requirements, written informed consent to participate in

376

this study / history of four or more infections with antibiotic treatment in the last year, se -

377

vere liver or kidney disease, patients with immunotherapy, patients that suffer from any on-

378

cological disease.

379

To ensure valid test results we screened patients according to the specified inclusion and

380

exclusion criteria. All Patients were interviewed systematically according to an anamnestic

381

questionnaire. To validate COVID-19 cases, RT-PCR, clinical diagnosis and the result of

382

the Euroimmune IgG Assay were used in conjunction. Patients were questioned about the

383

time of onset of symptoms. All Patients included in this study could precisely specify at

384

which date symptoms occurred. After the onset of symptoms, all but one Patient under-

385

went RT-PCR testing and tested positive for COVID-19. We ensured that no patient took

386

medicine or suffered from a disease that could potentially affect the development of anti -

387

bodies. The severity of COVID-19 was determined on the basis of WHO guidelines into

388

asymptomatic, mild (common cold-like symptoms), moderate (dyspnea, clinical signs of

389

pulmonary distress) and severe (requiring oxygen supplementation, intensive care with or

390

without ventilation) [WHO Global, 2020].

391
392

Peptide microarrays. Antibody response profiling was performed with a peptide microar-

393

ray (JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH) containing 5513 peptides covering the full pro-

394

teome of SARS-CoV-2 and, in addition, the S, N, E, and M proteins of the following

395

HCoVs: SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, HCov 229E, OC43. All proteins were represented by

396

overlapping peptides covering the entire protein sequence (15 aa length, 11 aa overlap).

397

All proteins covered by the peptide library are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

398
399

Peptide synthesis and microarray production. Peptides were synthesized and immobi-

400

lized on peptide microarray slides as described previously [Stephenson et al., 2015]. In

401

brief, the peptides were synthesized using SPOT synthesis [Wenschuh et al., 2000],

402

cleaved from the solid support and chemoselectively immobilized on functionalized glass

403

slides. Each peptide was deposited on the microarray in triplicates.

404
405

Microarray assay and data analysis. The peptide microarrays were incubated with sera

406

(applied dilution 1:200) in an HS 4800 microarray processing station (Tecan) for two hours

407

at 30°C, followed by incubation with 0.1 μg/mL fluorescently labelled anti human IgG deg/mL fluorescently labelled anti human IgG de-

408

tection antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, 109-605-098). Washing steps were performed

409

prior to every incubation step with 0.1% Tween-20 in 1x TBS. After the final incubation

410

step the microarrays were washed (0.05% Tween-20 in 0.1x SSC) and dried in a stream of

411

nitrogen. Each microarray was scanned using a GenePix Autoloader 4300 SL50 (Molecu-

412

lar Devices, Pixel size: 10 μg/mL fluorescently labelled anti human IgG dem). Signal intensities were evaluated using GenePix Pro 7.0

413

analysis software (Molecular Devices). For each peptide, the MMC2 value of the three trip-

414

licates was calculated. The MMC2 value was equal to the mean value of all three in-

415

stances on the microarray except when the coefficient of variation (CV) – standard-devia-

416

tion divided by the mean value – was larger than 0.5. In this case the mean of the two val -

417

ues closest to each other (MC2) was assigned to MMC2. Further data analysis and gener-

418

ation of the heatmapts was performed using the statistical computing and graphics soft-

419

ware R (Version 4.0.2, www.r-project.org).

420
421

RT-PCR test.

422

We used the protocol described by the centers for disease control and prevention for the

423

CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)–PCR

424

Diagnostic Panel.

425
426

ELISA test. To detect antibodies, we used the Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG),

427

which was manufactured by Euroimmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG, Lübeck, Ger-

428

many. The break-off microplate wells were covered with the antigen, a recombinant struc-

429

tural spike 1 (S1) protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in HEK293 [FDA, 2020]. First, the di-

430

luted patient samples were incubated in the wells which lead to specific IgG antibodies

431

binding to the antigens. In order to detect the bound antibodies, an enzyme-labelled anti-

432

human IgG antibody detected antigen-antibody complexes and catalysed a colour reac-

433

tion. By calculating the extinction of the sample over the extinction of the calibrator the re-

434

sults could be evaluated semi-quantitatively. A ratio below 0.8 was considered a negative

435

result. A ratio between 0.8 and 1.1 was considered a borderline result. A ratio above 1.1

436

was considered a positive result [Euroimmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG, 2020].

437
438

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

439

Data analysis and heatmap generation was performed using the statistical computing and

440

graphics software R (Version 4.0.2, www.r-project.org).

441

The data set used for statistical analysis of the microarray results and for generation of all

442

heatmap presentations was based on MMC2 values calculated from signals of the tripli-

443

cate spots of each individual peptide. The MMC2 value calculation is described in detail in

444
33
34

the Microarray assay and data analysis section.

445

The principle of the colour coding of all heatmaps is described in the corresponding figure

446

legends. The coloured fields in the heatmaps reflect the calculated MMC2 values of each

447

individual peptide.

448

The boxplots in Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the median of the corresponding sample

449

groups. The central rectangles span the first quartile to the third quartile (the interquartile

450

range or IQR). The whiskers represent the following values: upper whisker = min(max(x),

451

Quartile 3 + 1.5 * IQR); lower whisker = max(min(x), Quartile 1 – 1.5 * IQR). The points in

452

the boxplots show the MMC2 values for the individual samples.

453

Statistical comparison of two sample groups was done by the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (R

454

package stats, n=24 patient samples and n=12 control samples). ROC analysis was per-

455

formed using the R package ROCR. The selection of the peptide hits with significant

456

separation between the sample groups was based on the accuracy value calculated as

457

'(true positive + true negative)/total number of observations’. An accuracy value of ≥0.4

458

was considered to indicate immunogenicity (Supplementary Table 2). Immunodominance

459

was assigned to epitopes based on the highest accuracy scores and the sequences of the

460

corresponding overlapping peptides (Table 1).

461

The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient reflecting the relationship between the com-

462

mercial ELISA and the peptide microarray (Figure 3) was calculated as described in the

463

figure legend using the R package ggpubr.
