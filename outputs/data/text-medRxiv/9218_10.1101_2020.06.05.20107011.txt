Abstract
Objectives: To describe our experience with a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak
within a large rheumatology department, early in the pandemic.
Methods: Symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) had a nasooropharyngeal swab for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) and were followed clinically. Reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RTPCR) was repeated to document cure, and serological response was assessed. Patients with risk
contacts within the department in the 14 days preceding the outbreak were screened for
COVID-19 symptoms.
Results: 14/34 HCWs (41%; 40±14 years, 71% female) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and
11/34 (32%) developed symptoms but were RT-PCR-negative. Half of RT-PCR-positive
HCWs did not report fever, cough, or dyspnoea before testing, which were absent in 3/14 cases
(21%). Mild disease prevailed (79%), but 3 HCWs had moderate disease requiring further
assessment, which excluded severe complications. Nevertheless, symptom duration (28±18
days), viral shedding (31±10 days post-symptom onset, range 15-51) and work absence (29±28
days) were prolonged. 13/14 (93%) of RT-PCR-positive and none of the RT-PCR-negative
HCWs had a positive humoral response, with higher IgG-index in individuals over 50 years
(14.5±7.7 vs 5.0±4.4, p=0.012). Of 617 rheumatic patients, 8 (1.3%) developed COVID-19
symptoms (1/8 hospitalisation, 8/8 complete recovery), following a consultation/procedure
with an asymptomatic (7/8) or mildly-symptomatic (1/8) HCW.
Conclusions: A COVID-19 outbreak can occur among HCWs and rheumatic patients, swiftly
spreading over the presymptomatic stage. Mild disease without typical symptoms should be
recognised, and may evolve with delayed viral shedding, prolonged recovery, and adequate
immune response in most individuals.

Key messages
• High infection rates have been reported in healthcare workers (HCWs) dealing with
COVID-19 patients. Less is known about potential transmission by pre/asymptomatic
carriers, which may be important in the context of rheumatology practice, among both
HCWs and patients.
• A COVID-19 outbreak in a rheumatology department affected 41% of HCWs, with fast
spreading throughout the presymptomatic stage.
• Mild disease without typical symptoms was common, especially in early phases, evolving
with delayed viral shedding (unto 51 days), prolonged recovery (average one month), and
adequate immune response (93%) in most individuals.
• Transmission by mostly asymptomatic HCWs occurred to a minority of patients with
rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), who had a globally favourable outcome.
• Asymptomatic and mild disease forms among HCWs should be recognised. Assertive
infection control measures and testing strategies are warranted to prevent subclinical
contagion between HCWs and patients with RMDs.

Introduction
Following the initial descriptions in early January 2020 of a novel form of severe pneumonia
in patients from Wuhan, China,1–4 the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly spread
at a global level. On January 30, the World Health Organization declared it a public health
emergency of international concern,5 subsequently updated to pandemic on March 11.6 After
the first reported case in Portugal (March 2), exponential growth led to major restrictive
measures.7
Consistently high infection rates among healthcare workers (HCWs) have been reported in
several hard-hit countries such as China,8,9 Italy,10 Spain,11 or the United States,12 despite
adequate safety measures.13 One possibility is that in-hospital transmission, among patients
and HCWs, might be a key form of contagion.9,14,15 This is particularly relevant given the
transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
whereby presymptomatic/asymptomatic contamination is likely to play a major role in disease
spreading.14–19
In the early days of the pandemic, most focus was given to severe clinical pictures,2,8,9,20 while
reports on mild or asymptomatic disease were scarce.21,22 This may have contributed to an
initial oversight of more general, less severe manifestations, such as upper respiratory and
digestive symptoms.23 These milder disease forms might be easily undervalued, including by
HCWs responding to the pandemic. In healthcare facilities, this may facilitate the generalised
spread among HCWs, who can serve as disease-transmission agents.9,14–16 Such fact may be
particularly relevant in outpatient-oriented departments with a high volume of clinical activity
(e.g., rheumatology). In addition, rheumatology practice requires daily close physical contact

In the present report, we aim to describe our experience with a COVID-19 outbreak within our
department, upon the initial weeks of the pandemic, highlighting clinical, virological and
immunological outcomes of HCWs and RMD patients.

Methods
Outbreak characterisation
Over the week of 9-15 March, several HCWs of our rheumatology department developed mild
symptoms compatible with COVID-19. All staff (symptomatic/asymptomatic) underwent
screening for SARS-CoV-2 on 15-16 March. Double naso-oropharyngeal swabs were
obtained, and samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR; cobas®SARS-CoV-2 kit, cobas®6800 System, Roche Diagnostics, USA).
All the confirmed and suspected cases were quarantined and referred to public health
authorities. Daily remote clinical monitoring of HCWs was conducted by 2 asymptomatic
rheumatologists, in conjunction with public health and occupational medicine specialists.
Testing of HCWs was repeated (i) 7-14 days after the first negative test in subjects with
persisting symptoms; (ii) 5-7 days following the resolution of fever and improvement in
respiratory symptoms in confirmed cases.24 Two consecutive negative tests were required to
confirm viral shedding cessation and allow return to work.25 Immunological response to SARSCoV-2 was evaluated by chemiluminescent immunoassay (MAGLUMI®800 CLIA System,
MAGLUMI®2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) IgM/IgG-kits, Snibe Co., Ltd., China) in all HCWs,
following symptom resolution and double-negative RT-PCR in confirmed cases.
We contacted patients observed during the previous 2 weeks in the day care unit, outpatient
clinic and procedures room, who had possible contacts with confirmed RT-PCR-positive
HCWs. Each patient was screened for suggestive symptoms and requested to remain in

isolation for 14 days post-contact with the department. Patients with symptoms compatible
with COVID-19 were referred to the national health system hotline and signalled to health
authorities, who had also received the list of screened patients.

Study procedures
All HCWs of the rheumatology department who were working during 2-13 March, including
visiting fellows, were invited to participate in this study. A standardised questionnaire was
administered to collect demographic data, symptom characterisation, disease course and
outcome, treatment, comorbidities, and concomitant therapy. Results of laboratory and
imaging studies performed, including RT-PCR and IgG/IgM for SARS-CoV-2 were reviewed.
Disease course was classified as mild, moderate (requiring physical examination and
laboratory/imaging studies) or severe (requiring hospitalisation). Moreover, patients observed
in the department between 2-13 March who developed symptoms suggestive of COVID-19
had an appointment scheduled, upon definite resolution, for clinical observation. The same data
were collected as for HCWs, in addition to variables related to the RMD and associated
treatment. Patients observed in the period of interest who did not develop COVID-19
symptoms, or did so outside the 14-day window after the last contact with the department, were
excluded. All study participants signed a study-specific informed consent. This study was
approved by the Lisbon Academic Medical Centre Ethics Committee (reference 171/20).

Statistical analysis
Demographic and clinical characteristics were presented as frequency, mean±standard
deviation or median (interquartile range [IQR]), as applicable. Comparison of continuous
variables between HCW groups was performed using Kruskal-Wallis (3 groups) or Mann-

Whitney U-test (2 groups). Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square or Fisher’s
exact test. Agreement between RT-PCR and serological tests was done using Kappa-statistic.
Pearson correlation was applied to study the relation of IgG humoral response and clinical
variables. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata-12.1 for Mac (StataCorp, College
Station, USA) and GraphPad-Prism-7 for MacOS (GraphPad Software, USA). P-value was
considered significant at p<0.05.

Results
Clinical and virological course of HCWs
A total of 25/34 HCWs (17 rheumatologists, 8 residents, 4 visiting fellows, 1 nurse, 1 health
aid, 2 secretaries, 1 cleaning aid) developed symptoms suggestive of a viral infection, 14 of
whom had a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1, Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1).
Ten out of 14 (71%) positive cases were female or younger than 50 years old. Only 4/14 (29%)
subjects had a previous history of cardiovascular disease and/or metabolic syndrome, whereas
3/14 (21%) had a diagnosis of immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID; one of whom
treated with methotrexate 15mg/week). Importantly, 5/14 (36%) HCWs did not develop fever,
which lasted ≤3 days in 4/9 (44%) remaining cases. Cough was also absent in the same
proportion (36%). Of note, 7/14 (50%) subjects did not develop any of the manifestations of
the typical COVID-19 triad prior to the positive RT-PCR test, which were completely missing
in 3 cases (21%) throughout the disease. In turn, milder symptoms were already present during
the week prior to the outbreak identification in several instances. Anosmia and dysgeusia were
present in over half the cases, including 1 subject (HCW6) who did not develop fever, cough
or dyspnoea.

The majority of cases (11/14, 79%) had a benign course. There were no hospitalisations, but
3/14 HCWs (age category 40-70, with relevant comorbidities) underwent clinical, laboratory
and radiographic evaluation 7-12 days after symptom onset, due to persistent fever, cough,
chest pain and/or shortness of breath. Lymphopaenia (1/3), thrombocytopaenia (1/3), raised
lactate dehydrogenase (1/3), D-dimers (2/3), fibrinogen (2/3), and C-reactive protein (CRP;
2/3) were identified, but hypoxaemia and radiographic signs of COVID-19 pneumonia were
absent. Seven subjects (50%) were treated with hydroxychloroquine (400mg/day, median 9
days, range 7-14 days) and 4 received concomitant azithromycin (500mg/day, 5 days). One
HCW developed a bacterial sinus infection, treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate. Secondary
transmission to household members was confirmed in 7/14 (50%) cases, one of which to 2
relatives, all with mild disease.
Despite the favourable course of most cases, symptom duration was prolonged (median 24.5
days, IQR 15-39, range 2-58; Table 1, Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1). At the end of followup, 2 subjects had persistent symptoms (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1). Likewise, nasooropharyngeal RT-PCR remained positive on average for 31±10 days from symptom onset
(median 29.5 days, IQR 25-35, range 15-51; Figure 1). This resulted in the need to repeat RTPCR tests frequently, with a median number of tests per positive subject of 5 (IQR 4-6, range
4-9). Of note, 8/34 (24%) of repetition tests in completely asymptomatic subjects were positive.
Yet, this was less than in individuals who repeated testing while still showing some symptoms
(13/25, 52%, p=0.024; Figure 1). On average, HCWs were away from work for 29.2±9.8 days
(median 24.5, IQR 23-36, range 16-51).
Eleven subjects developed various symptoms but tested negative, even upon retesting (Table
1, Figure 1). These HCWs reported complaints of cough (55%), rhinorrhoea (45%), sore throat
(82%), and other symptoms in similar frequency and duration to confirmed cases, over the
same time frame. However, fever, fatigue, malaise, headache, myalgia, anosmia, and dysgeusia

were significantly less common. Notably, these HCWs had a comparable demographic and
comorbidity profile to those with positive RT-PCR and the 9 asymptomatic subjects with
negative RT-PCR (Table 1).
No HCWs reported travel from areas with active community transmission. A resident (HCW6),
wearing a surgical mask, observed a suggestive case in the emergency department 3 days before
symptom onset (March 8), who did not fulfil testing criteria at the time (travel from endemic
area). A consultant (HCW4) had a short, unprotected contact on the week preceding the
outbreak with an inpatient from another department, later found to have COVID-19. Of note,
7/14 of infected HCWs had a common link to our rheumatological procedures unit, having
spent there the most hours over the 2 previous weeks. Nonetheless, the remaining RT-PCRpositive HCWs had minimal exposure to this facility and 2 rheumatologists (HCW18/21), who
spent over 10h/week in the unit, tested negative. Finally, all but 10 HCWs (5 RT-PCR-positive,
5 RT-PCR-negative) were present, unprotected, in a 2.5-hour departmental meeting (March
10) addressing the local response to the pandemic. At the time, only 1 HCW (HCW7) had
symptoms (mild rhinorrhoea).

Immunological response
After a median (IQR) of 45 (40.5-48.5) days following symptom onset (or the first RT-PCR
test, for asymptomatic subjects), 32 HCWs had an assessment of the serological response
(Figure 2). A positive IgM and IgG index (>1.0AU/mL) was seen in, respectively, 2/14 (14.3%)
and 13/14 (92.9%) of the confirmed RT-PCR-positive cases and none of the
symptomatic/asymptomatic RT-PCR-negative subjects (Figure 2A,B). Both tests had a 96.9%
agreement in case classification (Kappa coefficient 0.936). Assessment timing was similar for
the HCWs with borderline-positive IgM (HCW11/12, 1.10-1.18AU/mL) or IgG (HCW12/14,

1.10AU/mL) compared to other RT-PCR-positive subjects. In addition, HCW10 had an IgG
index below the positive threshold, despite 2 positive RT-PCR tests, no immunosuppression,
and comparable evaluation timing and clinical course.
Within the RT-PCR-positive group, considerable variation was seen in the antibody response
(Figure 2B). Notably, subjects over 50 years had a higher mean IgG index (14.5±7.7AU/mL))
than younger individuals (5.0±4.4AU/mL, p=0.012; Figure 2C). Although the numbers are
small, the 3 older HCWs who had an IgG index above 10AU/mL presented a more severe
disease course, with high fever and cough, and 2 of them had raised D-dimers, fibrinogen and
CRP. In contrast, the remainder older HCW had a mild course with limited rhinorrhoea and
gastrointestinal symptoms, and developed a lower IgG index (4.99AU/mL). Nevertheless, a
positive trend was observed in the correlation between age and IgG index (Pearson r=0.53,
p=0.051; Figure 2D). No other clinical factor was associated with antibody response, including
sex, treatment, or presence/duration of fever, cough or dyspnoea.

Secondary transmission to patients with RMDs
A total of 617 patients were identified as having had a potential risk contact, 561 (91%) of
whom were contacted by telephone and screened for COVID-19 symptoms starting within the
14-day window (Figure 3). We identified 8 (1.3% of total) female patients (mean age 66.8±14.9
years) who developed symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (Table 2). Six patients had a
diagnosis of an inflammatory RMD, 3 were treated with conventional synthetic diseasemodifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and glucocorticoids and 2 with biologic
DMARDs (bDMARDs). All contacts took place within the same 2 days (9 and 11 March), all
but one were with a confirmed infected HCW, and patients denied additional suspicious
contacts. Contact tracing for Patient-1 within the department confirmed it to be limited to a

symptomatic physician with negative RT-PCR and serology (HCW24). Importantly, in 7/8
cases, the HCW was asymptomatic at the time of contact, and 1 patient (Patient-6) had a
consultation with a physician (HCW7) presenting only mild serous rhinorrhea. Of note, 5/8
contacts were in the context of diagnostic (ultrasound) or therapeutic procedures
(mesotherapy), which involved prolonged close physician-patient contact.
Patients developed symptoms on average 4.3±2.1 days (range 2-9) after the contact. Half
reported fever, 88% had cough, and only 1 patient reported dyspnoea. General and upper
airway symptoms were common, including anosmia (50%) and dysgeusia (63%).
Nasopharyngeal swabs were performed in 6/8 cases (8.8±3.1 days post-symptom onset), 2 of
which were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 1 was inconclusive. Two patients were not tested
due to difficulty in reaching health authorities or personal choice (self-isolation). Patients with
negative/unavailable test still had suggestive COVID-19 symptoms.
All but one patient had a mild-to-moderate course and were clinically recovered after an
average of 24.8±5.9 days. A woman in her 90’s with giant cell arteritis and relevant
cardiovascular comorbidities, exposed to long-term methotrexate and low-dose
glucocorticoids, was hospitalised after 6 days of fever and 3 days of worsening chest pain and
dyspnoea. She required oxygen therapy, received a combination of hydroxychloroquine
(400mg/day) and lopinavir/ritonavir (800/200mg/day), and was discharged after 10 days.
Importantly, none of the patients experienced a flare of the baseline RMD.

Discussion
Our study provides important lessons on the vulnerability and impact of a COVID-19 outbreak
within a large rheumatology department, at a time when universal surgical mask use was not
recommended. Over a single week, 41% of HCWs were confirmed to be infected by SARSCoV-2, and an additional 32% developed mostly overlapping symptoms. While we could not

detect the index case, the spread of the contagion was fast and occurred when almost all HCWs
were asymptomatic or exhibited only minor symptoms, easily dismissed or attributed to
another concurrent viral disease. These findings are in accordance with current concerns
around the presymptomatic or asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs and
patients.9,14–16 As viral shedding and infectiousness are higher in the 2-3 days prior to symptom
onset and rapidly decrease thereafter,26,27 a high proportion of contagion occurs during the
presymptomatic stage.18,26 In addition, asymptomatic17,22,28,29 and mild disease forms with
limited upper respiratory symptoms are now widely recognised,23,27 and may escape vigilance
protocols, more focused on the presence of fever, cough, and dyspnoea. This was certainly the
case in our cluster, where testing of all HCWs of the department, whether symptomatic or not,
was vital to identify cases and contain the outbreak. Therefore, in healthcare settings,
continuous mask use, social distancing, and mild-symptom monitoring should be adopted
among HCWs, together with proactive testing strategies, to account for potential
pre/asymptomatic carriers.15
The outbreak had a profound repercussion in the clinical activity of the department. Infected
subjects had protracted symptoms and were away from work for around 1 month. In addition,
prolonged viral shedding (up to 51 days) led to frequent RT-PCR repetition (median 5 tests)
until cure was confirmed, consuming substantial resources. Our findings regarding viral RNA
swab positivity are longer than previously reported,20,30–32 which may be related to differences
in specimen collection (double naso- and oropharyngeal swab in our study), study population,
or disease severity. Interestingly, similar nasopharyngeal viral load in patients with mild and
severe disease have been reported,30 although a separate study concluded otherwise.33
Moreover, some data suggest that a positive RT-PCR does not denote the actual presence of
viable virus, especially after the first week.27,34 However, this is not yet fully established, and
we would therefore advocate for 2 consecutive negative tests before HCWs return to work. In

effect, 21/59 (36%) of repeat tests were positive, and in 5 instances a positive or indeterminate
test followed a first negative result, highlighting the difficulties of interpretation.34
All HCWs had a mild-to-moderate disease course and there were no major complications. We
believe the positive outcome of the cohort is mainly related to the young mean age, with only
2 HCWs older than 60-years. Alternatively, a lower initial viral exposure load could also
explain an overall milder phenotype.33 Nevertheless, most of the infected HCWs (93%)
developed an immune response, which tended to be more robust in older individuals. This, in
turn, may be secondary to a more severe clinical course, known to be strongly associated with
age.20,35 A possible explanation for this finding could be a higher peak viral load, also
previously shown to be positively correlated with age.30 Indeed, we highlight that 2/13 (15.4%)
IgG-positive HCWs, both under 30-years and with a very mild disease course, had borderline
IgG indexes. Nevertheless, other factors, such as T-cell-mediated immunity,36–38 may be
involved, as 1 HCW in the 40-50-year-old range, who had cough and 2 positive RT-PCR tests,
did not develop IgG antibodies 47 days post-symptom onset. Concordance between serology
and RT-PCR was otherwise excellent, confirming previous reports.20,30,31 Although it cannot
be completely excluded, this suggests there were no false-negative RT-PCR results, including
in symptomatic HCWs.
Finally, secondary transmission to a minority of patients did occur, from 4 HCWs who were
asymptomatic (75%) or had mild upper airway symptoms (25%), mostly in a close proximity
contact. As one of the confirmed cases only contacted with HCW24 (negative RT-PCR and
serology), we cannot exclude undisclosed community contagion or nosocomial transmission
through fomites.39 Also, we admit patients with negative/missing RT-PCR could be falsenegative or undiagnosed cases, possibly due to a larger interval between symptom onset and
testing. Of note, all contacts occurred when preventive measures had already been adopted and
80% of face-to-face clinical activity had been deferred, which might explain the low number

of infected patients. We admit the possibility that contagion could have followed the opposite
route (pre/asymptomatic patients-to-HCWs), although symptom timing does suggest
otherwise. Notwithstanding the advanced age and long-term use of cs/bDMARDs and
glucocorticoids in half the cases, all patients had a favourable outcome. This is in accordance
with the largest series to date of patients with IMIDs, failing to show an increase in the
incidence of severe disease.40
Our study has some limitations. Due to its real-life nature, clinical assessment and RT-PCR
timing were clinically-based and differed slightly between subjects. As computed tomography
was not performed, we cannot completely exclude COVID-19 pneumonia. Two fellows could
not be tested for serology upon finishing their clerkship. Also, 9% of the identified RMD
patients could not be reached.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that a COVID-19 outbreak can occur among HCWs and

Figure 2. Immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers.

A. Percentage of healthcare workers (HCW) with a positive immunological response to severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, defined as an IgM or IgG index equal or
above 1.0AU/mL. Analysis differentiated by HCW group, depending on the presence of COVID-19
symptoms and the result of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). N=32 (RTPCR+, N=14; RT-PCR– symptoms, n=10; RT-PCR– no symptoms, n=8). B. Index of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies (IgG and IgM) according to RT-PCR result and COVID-19 symptoms. Dashed line
represents positive threshold (1.0AU/mL). Error bars represent mean with standard deviation. C.
Distribution of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in RT-PCR+ HCWs, according to age group (below
or above 50 years old). *p=0.012. D. Correlation between age and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in
RT-PCR+ HCWs. r, Pearson correlation coefficient.

Figure 3. Flow chart of RMD patient screening for symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.

Patients with possible contacts with healthcare workers with positive reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the period of
2-13 March 2020 were contacted by telephone and screened for COVID-19 symptoms starting within
the subsequent 14 days. See Methods for details.
