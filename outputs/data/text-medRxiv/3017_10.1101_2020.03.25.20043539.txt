Abstract

21

China reported a major outbreak of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, from mid-January till

22

mid-March 2020. The number of cases outside China is now growing fast, while in mainland

23

China the virus outbreak is largely under control. We review the epidemic virus growth and

24

decline curves in China using a phenomenological logistic growth model to summarize the

25

outbreak dynamics using three parameters that characterize the epidemic’s timing, rate and

26

peak. During the initial phase, the number of virus cases doubled every 2.7 (range 2.2 - 4.4)

27

days. The rate of increase in the number of reported cases peaked approximately 10 days after

28

suppression measures were started on 23-25 January 2020. The peak in the number of

29

reported sick cases occurred on average 18 days after the start of measures. From the time of

30

starting measures till the peak, the number of cases increased by a factor 39 in the province

31

Hubei, and by a factor 9.5 for all of China (range: 6.2-20.4 in the other provinces). Complete

32

suppression took up to 2 months (range: 23-57d.), during which period severe restrictions,

33

social distancing measures, testing and isolation of cases were in place. The suppression of

34

the disease in China has been successful, demonstrating that suppression is a viable strategy to

35

contain SARS-CoV2.

Introduction

39

The coronavirus SARS-CoV2 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in late 2019. From

40

there it spread, first in Hubei, then across China during the spring holiday, and finally across

41

the world. Currently (as of 8 April 2020), the virus has been reported from 212 countries areas

42

or territories and the cumulative number of cases outside China has exceeded 1.2 million[1].

43

In mainland China, few new cases have been reported since 18 March, and most new cases

44

have originated from outside China[2]. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China appears to

45

be, for now, under control.

46
47

Virtually the entire global population is susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection and no vaccine

48

is available yet. Unless a successful NPI (Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention) strategy is

49

implemented in the early stages of transmission, an exponential global proliferation threatens

50

to overwhelm the health care systems of many countries. Three NPI strategies are being

51

discussed for managing the current COVID-19 epidemic: (1) suppression, (2) mitigation, and

52

(3) containment[3]. In suppression, strict measures are taken to reverse the epidemic spread,

53

essentially by bringing the effective reproduction number Re (the number of new cases per

54

existing case) below one[4, 5]. Social distancing is a key factor in suppression[6]. In

55

mitigation the aim is not to necessarily stop all transmission, but rather to reduce the rate of

56

transmission and in effect lower the number of infected people at any given time[3, 7]. It has

57

been suggested that mitigation strategies might prevent inundation of the health care system

58

by “flattening” the peak of sick people”[3]. However, even in the most optimistic scenarios

59

for mitigation, healthcare capacity is likely to be still seriously overwhelmed, as it was in

60

Wuhan in February 2020 and in Italy in March 2020. Herd immunity has been suggested as a

61

component of mitigation, but is only a viable option once a vaccine is available because up to

62

20% of people with confirmed infection develops serious symptoms and needs hospitalization

or intensive care [8]. The proportion of unreported cases is uncertain (86% before measures

64

but 16-21% after measures in the whole of China according to Li, Pei (9); 59% or more in

65

Wuhan according to Wang, Liu (10)). If underreporting is accounted for, the proportion of

66

infected people requiring hospitalization is still in the order of 3% or more. Containment is

67

based on intensive surveillance of possible cases, testing, followed by isolation of infected

68

people and their contacts[11]. Containment is only possible if the virus is not freely

69

circulating in a population. Currently, because in many countries outside of China the virus is

70

circulating within the population, these countries are practicing suppression. Policy makers

71

may ask:

72
73
74

(1) How long will it take for the epidemic to peak after suppression measures have been
implemented?

75

(2) What will the peak number of sickness cases be?

76

(3) How long do suppression measures need to be maintained to suppress the virus to

77

sufficiently low incidence to allow containment (search and quarantine flare-ups of the

78

virus)?

79
80

Here we analyze with a phenomenological logistic model the epidemics of SARS-CoV2 in

81

China and 20 of its provinces that reported more than 150 cases. The logistic model is widely

82

used in ecology to analyze boom and bust population dynamics[12]. Logistic models are not

83

as widely used in human disease epidemiology as more mechanistic compartment-based SIR

84

and SEIR models[13-16] because the parameters lack a strict mechanistic interpretation in

85

terms of transmission rate and disease etiology (e.g. latency period, incubation period and

86

infectious period). However, this disadvantage is compensated by the usefulness of the

87

parameters for providing a simple and intuitive description of the outbreak dynamics in time.

88

We do not imply that logistic models can replace established epidemiological models, but we

89

do argue that phenomenological models, given the urgency and severe consequences of the

90

worldwide SARS-CoV2 outbreak for public health management, have a place along

91

mechanistic models to inform on disease dynamics[17] and support narratives on outbreak

92

dynamics with simple metrics like relative rate of increase, doubling time, and time to the

93

peak. Using data from China, logistic models shows the key disease dynamic parameters

94

before and after suppression policies were implemented[18].

95
96

Methods

97

All data were extracted from official reports from the National Health Commission of

98

China[19]. We obtained time series data of total confirmed, total recovered, and total death

99

cases for each provinces of China. We used the data starting on 21 January when reporting

100

daily infected cases started at the national level, and up to 10 March 2020 when almost no

101

new confirmed case in China[19]. We did not use data after 10 March to minimize the

102

influence of cases introduced from outside China.

103
104

We used three-parameter logistic models to fit the time series of the total confirmed and of the

105

total recovered cases. Parameters refer to the asymptotic value (a; number of cases),

106

the inflection point of the curve (b; date) and a scale parameter (c; days).

112

In addition, we assume a constant daily death rate k, which was calculated as the average of

113

number of deceased each day, divided by the infected cases on that day:

115

Where Dt and It are the number of daily death cases and active infected cases at day t. We

116

excluded data before 25 January and data where It < 50 in this calculation, as values are

117

poorly estimated at an early stage of the outbreak (under-estimated denominator) and at low It

118

(high variability in the outcome).

119
120

We then calculated the active infected cases, which can be expressed as
8" = !" − !6" − 1"

121
122

Of which TDt is the number of total death at day t, which equals
"

And therefore (see Appendix 1 for inference)

8" =

126

where Tt – Tt-1 is the daily change in the number of infected cases, and Ct – Ct-1 is the daily

127

change in the number of recovered cases.

128
129

Based on the fitted model, we then calculated the peak date of 1) active sick people, which is

130

also the date of peak number of daily death, 2) number of sick cases during the peak, 3) the

131

date of maximum increase in the number of infected cases and 4) the daily rate of increase on

132

this date, 5) total infected cases on this date, 6) the relative rate on this date, 7) the end date of

133

daily increase (<1) case (operationally the end of the epidemic), and 8) time from maximum

134

increase till sick peak. Taking the date of level 1 public health emergency action as the

implementation of suppression measures[20], which varied between 23 January to 25 January

136

across provinces[21] (we set the median date, 24 January as the date for entire China), we

137

then calculated 9) the delay from the action date until the sick peak, 10) the delay from the

138

action date until the date at which the rate of increase peaked, 11) the time from suppression

139

measure till the end date of daily increase in number of reported infections, 12) the ratio

140

between sick cases at peak and total infected case at the action date, as well as 13) the same

141

ratio considering a reporting delay of 6 days[9], i.e. by taking the ratio of

142

sick(tpeak)/sick(taction+6).

143
144

Calculations were made for 20 Chinese provinces with more than 150 reported cases, and also

145

for China excluding Hubei, by far the worst affected province. The built-in function “SSlogis”

146

in R[22] was used to fit logistic growth curves. Data were obtained using package

147

“nCov2019” [23, 24].

148
149

Results

150

The cumulative number of cases (confirmed by testing or based on clinical symptoms) was

151

described very well by a logistic growth pattern with R2 greater than 0.99 for all provinces,

152

except Shandong (R2>0.98, Table A1). Three provinces enacted suppression measures on 23

153

January, five implemented measures on 24 January, and the remaining 12 provinces started

154

measures on 25 January. The time scale for the increase was . = 3.91 d. for China

155

(excluding Hubei, range 3.13 - 6.39) and 4.13 d. for Hubei (Table A1), indicating doubling

156

times of c * ln(2) = 2.7 d. (range 2.2 – 4.4 d) and 2.9 d. for China (excluding Hubei) and for

157

Hubei, respectively, during the early epidemic. Some lack of fit during the early phase of the

158

epidemic (before measures) suggests the actual doubling times may be even shorter than these

159

estimates (Table A1).

160
161

The number of reported active sick cases (total infected minus recovered minus deceased) in

162

Hubei peaked 25 days after suppression measures were implemented, which in the model also

163

indicates the peak of number of deaths on the same day. Outside Hubei, the peak number of

164

reported sick cases (and peak of daily number dying) was on average reached 18 days after

165

the start of suppression (Table 1). The rate of daily increase in reported cases peaked 17 days

166

after the start of suppression measures in Hubei, and on average 10 days after the start of

167

measures in the other provinces (range: 8 to 15 days). When assuming a reporting delay of 6

168

days[9], the actual peak in the rate of increase occurred at 11 days after the implementation of

169

measures in Hubei and at 4 days after the implementation of measures in the other provinces.

170

The actual peak in the number of sick cases peaked at 19 days after the start of measures in

171

Hubei and at 12 days after the start of measures in the other provinces.

172
173

The relative rate of increase in the number of cases at the time of the peak rate was rather

174

consistent among provinces, with an average of 0.11 cases/case/day for Hubei and 0.12

175

cases/case/day for the rest of China (range: 0.08 to 0.15). Between suppression

176

implementation and the peak number of reported cases, the number of active cases in Hubei

177

increased by a factor 39, while in other provinces it increased by a factor of 9.5 with

178

considerable variation between provinces (range: 6.2 in Hainan and Chongqing to 20.4 in

179

Heilongjiang). If a 6-day reporting delay is accounted for in the estimate of the factor increase

180

from the start of measures to the peak, then this multiplication factor is diminished to a value

181

of 9.5 for Hubei and an average of 2.6 for the other provinces. The daily death rate of the

182

active sick people was 0.34 percent per day for Hubei, much higher than in other provinces

183

(on average 0.05 percent per day, ranging between 0 in Jiangsu Province (see also Sun, Qiu

184

(25)) and 0.18 percent per day in Hainan Province, Appendix 3), which indicates that on the

185

day of peak sick in Hubei (about 50,000 reported cases), 170 individuals died. Cumulative to

186

10 March, the modelled logistic curve showed that for China (excluding Hubei) 0.85% of the

187

reported cases died which is close to the actual value of 0.86%. The death rate was

188

overestimated in Hubei as 6.7%, compared to the actual 4.5%, due to the actual daily death

189

rate declining during the later stages of the epidemic.

190
191

Modelled logistic curves show that the total number of infected cases had plateaued by 21

192

March for Hubei and by 6 March for the rest of mainland China, i.e. 57 and 42 days (range:

193

23 to 46 days) after the start of suppression measures (Fig. 1, Table 1).

194
195

Discussion

196

Our results show compelling evidence for suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in

197

China, both in Hubei and the other provinces. No new cases were reported within mainland

198

China on 18, 19 and 20 March, 2020, with all new cases on those days from returning

199

overseas travelers, signaling the beginning of the end of the outbreak. However isolated cases

200

still occur, e.g. there was one new case on 24 March in Hubei. Thus, successful suppression

201

need to be followed by measures that will prevent a new outbreak[11].

202
203

Here we used logistic models to study the disease dynamic parameters. The analysis shown in

204

our results was continually updated from 1 February to 3 March while the epidemic was

205

progressing[26]. Based on the data up till 16 February 2020, a peak in sick incidence was

206

identified for 12 February, which was proven correct[27]. Thus, logistic models may be used

207

to determine early when suppression measures are expected to result in decreased rate of

208

epidemic growth and a decline in number of sick cases. However, any model shows lack of

209

fit[18]. The logistic model did not capture that the rate of increase in the early epidemic is

210

faster than the rate of decline during the tapering out of the epidemic (Appendix A1). Thus,

211

the logistic underestimates both the early relative growth rate and the increase of the number

212

of sick people from the start of measures till the peak for the Chinese data (Appendix A1).

213

Uncertainties in predictions also result from unknown reporting delay[9]. Improvements may

214

be possible by defining better tailored models, and especially, by collecting better data, e.g.

215

more (random) testing.

216
217

The results show that suppression can lead to (almost) complete removal of active virus

218

infected cases from the population, although given that not all active cases have recovered,

219

the outbreak is not completely over. The virus could still be present in asymptomatic

220

individuals or it could be re-introduced from unknown reservoirs. Re-entry of the virus from

221

countries outside China now needs to be prevented. Because the vast majority of the

222

population is not immune to SARS-SoV2, the virus can rapidly re-establish. Therefore,

223

suppression needs to be followed up by containment, a strategy based on strict surveillance,

224

testing of all individuals with symptoms, and followed by isolation of all infected individuals

225

and their recent contacts[11]. Currently, quarantine restrictions are gradually being lifted in

226

China, including Hubei Province, after no new cases have been detected for several weeks,

227

allowing people to return to work and businesses to start up again. Moreover, in China,

228

schools are preparing to reopen in April and normal social activities are slowly resuming[28].

229

These findings indicate that the implemented measures have been effective for controlling

230

SARS-CoV2 transmission in China[21, 29-31].

231
232

Many individuals infected with SARS-CoV2 show minimal or no symptoms. Due in part to

233

asymptomatic carriers, many infected individuals remain untested and unreported. Before 31

234

March, asymptomatic cases were not included in in the outbreak's daily report in China [32].

235

It is estimated that unreported cases were responsible for 77% of the reproduction number of

236

the disease before the start of measures in China and 16-21% thereafter[9, 10]. Moreover,

237

about half of infected individuals that develop symptoms do not show symptoms until 5 days

238

after infection, and some not up to 14 days, and maybe even up to 30 days[10, 33]. Cases with

239

a long incubation period, if they exist, could contribute to re-emergence of COVID-19 after

240

restrictions are lifted. Nonetheless, as the experience in China and several other

241

countries/regions (e.g. South Korea, Taiwan, Hongkong, Japan and Singapore) has shown, a

242

containment strategy can prevent the virus from uncontrolled spread if it re-emerges. Given

243

the worldwide pandemic spread of SARS-CoV2, it seems increasingly unavoidable that

244

worldwide containment will depend on a vaccine. Until a vaccine is ready and accessible, the

245

world population must confront the pandemic by combining suppression and containment in a

246

practical way that minimizes the human and economic costs. As noted by Wu and McGoogan

247

(8), “It is not only individual rights that need to be considered. The rights of those who are not

248

infected, but at risk of infection, must be considered as well.”

249
250

Important lessons from the outbreak and its control in China are in our opinion:

251

1. Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 is possible even after widespread community transmission.

252

2. Suppression can be achieved in one to two months if stringent measures are implemented

253

and maintained.

254

3. If implementation of stringent suppression measures is delayed, as was the case in Hubei,

255

the peak outbreak time is later, the increase in the number of sick people is greater, the

256

mortality rate is higher, and the necessary period of suppression is longer.

257

4. China provides compelling evidence that suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission can be

258

achieved within 60 days, even following widespread community transmission. It is the

259

opinion of the authors that addressing the widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission in other

Fig. 1. Fitted epidemic curves based on the observed data of SARS-CoV2 in China excluding

4

Hubei (thick solid lines), Hubei (dashed lines), and 19 other provinces (thin solid lines). The

5

y-axis of the top panel shows the number of cases relative to the maximum cumulative

6

infected for each region (the value a, see methods). The bottom panel shows the daily change

7

on the same relative scale. Red, green and grey colors indicate confirmed, recovered and

8

deceased cases. Orange color indicates the number of “active” sick cases (relative to total

9

infected, top panel), i.e. infected and not yet recovered or deceased, and the daily changes

10

(bottom panel), with negative values in the lower panel indicating that the number of active

11

cases is decreasing. Fitted and observed values for the true number can be found in Fig. A1

and Fig. A2.

Fig. A1 Observed and fitted epidemics of SARS-CoV2 in mainland China excluding Hubei
province for normal- (a) and log-scale (b) y-axis. Dots are observed cases and lines are model
fits. Top panel refers total cases and bottom panel refers to daily changes. For the normal
scale (A), the left y-axis is for infected, recovered and sick cases and the right y-axis for
deceased cases. Red colour indicates the total number of infected cases (confirmed and
suspected) (top panel) or the daily rate of increase in the number of cases (bottom panel).
Green colour indicate the recovered cases in both panels. Grey colour indicates cumulative
deaths in the upper graph and daily death cases in the lower panel. Orange colour indicates the
number of “active” cases (top panel), i.e. infected and not yet recovered or deceased, and the
daily change in the number of active cases (bottom panel). Negative values (in normal scale)
in the lower panel mean that the number of active cases is decreasing.

Fig. A2. Epidemics of SARS-CoV2 in 20 Chinese provinces with a minimum of 150 cases for normal- (a) and log-scale (b) y-axis. Dots are
observed cases and lines are model fits. Red, green and grey colors indicate confirmed, recovered and deceased cases. For the normal scale (a),
the left y-axis is for infected, recovered and sick cases and the right y-axis for deceased cases. Orange color indicates the number of “active” sick
cases (relative to total infected, top panel), i.e. infected and not yet recovered or deceased, and the daily changes (bottom panel), with negative
values (in normal scale) in the lower panel indicating that the number of active cases is decreasing. The upper panel for each province refers to
the total number of cases while the lower panel refers to the daily change in the number of cases.
