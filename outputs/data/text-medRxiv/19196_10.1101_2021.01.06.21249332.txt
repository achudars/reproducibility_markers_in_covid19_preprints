Abstract
As the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread in all countries, there is a growing
interest in monitoring and understanding the impact of emerging strains on virus transmission and
disease severity. Here, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences collected in the Eastern
Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries which, as of 12 November 2020. The majority (73.7%) of
these sequences originated from four out of 22 EMR countries, and 65.6% of all sequences
belonged to GISAID clades GR, GH, and G. We identified ten common non-synonymous
mutations represented among SARS-CoV-2 in the EMR and several country-specific ones. Two
substitutions, S_D614G and NSP12_P323L, were predominant in most countries. Contrary to
previous studies, these substitutions were not consistently associated with increased case fatality
rates across the Region. Our study identified critical data gaps in EMR highlighting the importance
of enhancing surveillance and sequencing capacities in the region.

Introduction
In early October 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 10% of the global
population has been infected with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 [1]. Since its declaration
as a pandemic seven months earlier, COVID-19 has inflicted substantial health and economic
burden around the world [2, 3]. As of 21 November 2020, there have been around 56 million
confirmed cases and 1.36 million deaths attributed to COVID-19 [4]. Specifically, 3,763,231
confirmed cases (of whom 3,096,119 have recovered) and 95,558 deaths were reported in the
Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) [5].
Prior to SARS-CoV-2 emergence, six human coronavirus (HCoV) strains were known to infect
humans: two of which caused fatal respiratory diseases (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV), while
the remaining four circulate annually and cause 15-29% of all common colds (HCoV-229E, OC43, -NL63 and -HKU1) [6]. SARS-CoV-2 gains access to the host cell by binding to the human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) through its spike (S) protein. SARS-CoV-2 S receptorbinding domain (RBD) has a 10- to 20-fold higher hACE2 binding affinity than SARS-CoV-1 [7].
Yet, SARS-CoV-2 RBD is less accessible such that the overall S-hACE2 interaction is similar or
weaker than that of SARS-CoV-1. Nonetheless, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein possesses a
polybasic cleavage site making it accessible to furin protease which enhances cell entry [8]. Similar
to other beta-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a positive-sense RNA genome that is around 30-kb
in length with six functional open reading frames (ORFs). ORFa and -b constitute nearly twothirds of the genome and produce 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs), including the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp or NSP12) and a helicase (NSP13). The structural nucleocapsid (N),
membrane (M), envelope (E), and S proteins are encoded by the remaining stretch of the RNA
genome along with other accessory proteins [9].

There has been a tremendous global surveillance effort to closely monitor SARS-CoV-2
circulating worldwide that enabled timely detection of emerging variants. SARS-CoV-2 evolves
at an estimated rate of around 6 x 10-4 nucleotides/genome/year [10]. Numerous variants have
emerged but only a handful of them have been fixated such as the S_D614G that has prevailed
globally. S_D614G was shown to alter infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and was
associated with an increase in mortality [10-14]. Recently, Sallam et al. reported in a preprint an
increase in the incidence of S_D614G variant between February and June 2020 in the Middle East
and North Africa [15]. However, a detailed genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 in EMR is
still lacking. It also remains not clear whether the case fatality rates (CFRs) in EMR are associated
with any of the prevailing SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 wholegenome sequences collected in EMR and examined the temporal and country-level associations
between the predominant variants and CFRs.
Methods
Sequence Retrieval and Analysis
SARS-CoV-2 sequences were downloaded from GISAID EpiCoVTM database [16] which were
submitted by 12 November 2020 for EMR countries. These are Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti,
Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and
Yemen (http://www.emro.who.int/countries.html). Only ‘high coverage’ sequences were selected,
i.e. “entries with <1% Ns and <0.05% unique amino acid mutations (not seen in other sequences
in the database) and no insertion/deletion unless verified by submitter”. These were then analyzed
by CoVsurver enabled by GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/covsurvermutations-app/) and compared with reference strain hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 (accession

number: EPI_ISL_402124). Sequence metadata corresponding to age, gender, and date of
collection were extracted from EpiCoVTM ‘nextmeta’ file. For clade analysis, we used the
Nextclade tool from the Nextstrain project (https://clades.nextstrain.org/) [17].
Country Data and Mortality Rate
Data on population size, total COVID-19 cases, and total deaths were retrieved from the
Worldometers website as of 14 November 2020 (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).
Data on daily cases and deaths per country were extracted from WHO Coronavirus Disease
(COVID-19) Dashboard (https://covid19.who.int/) [4]. CFR was calculated and adjusted for a 13day lag time from reporting to death, such that the denominator was designated as the cumulative
cases from 13 days earlier, while the numerator totaled the cumulative deaths till 13 days earlier
plus half the additional deaths recorded during the lag period [18].
Statistical Analysis
The data were checked for completeness, and responses were coded and entered into the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 20 for Windows, which was later used
for statistical analyses [IBM: Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. SPSS Statistics 2013,
20.]. Eight of the 15 EMR countries that have sequence data available were excluded from crosscountry fatality correlations for the following reasons: Egypt had a relatively high CFR (5.9%)
probably as a result of the low number of reported cases (1073 cases per million) likely due to
limited testing capacity; Iran had only 13 complete sequences (>25 kbp) out of 93 sequences and
was thus less comparable to other sequences; Iraq had only 1 complete out of 31 sequences
(Supplemental Figure 1); Pakistan, Tunisia, Lebanon, Kuwait, and Qatar had a relatively low
sequence count each (<20). For the summary of the data, descriptive statistics were presented to

summarize the study variables of interest as counts and percentages across countries. Pie charts
and bar plots were used to chart comparison in count and percentages of variants across all
countries. An independent t-test was used to chart the comparison of variants via gender (male vs
female), while one-way ANOVA was carried out for age distribution (0-9, 10-18, 19-49, 50-59,
and >60). Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to examine the association between variant
percentages and CFR for the seven countries considered in this study [19]. For all analyses done,
a p-value of less than 0.05 was used to detect statistical significance.
Results
We identified 1414 high-coverage SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from EMR countries – no
sequences were available for Afghanistan, Djibouti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.
Four countries accounted for 73.7% of the sequence count overall – Saudi Arabia (n=521), UAE
(n=186), Oman (n=185) and Egypt (n=150) (Figure 1A). Bahrain had the highest sequence to
population ratio (44.1 in 1 million), while Oman had the highest number of sequences per reported
COVID-19 cases (15.4 per 10,000 cases) (Figure 1B). When dates of collection were considered,
sequences from the top three represented countries (i.e., Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Oman) were most
evenly distributed, while those from Egypt showed a more abrupt pattern of sequence collection
(Figure 1C).
Using CoVsurver from GISAID, amino acid substitutions were identified in each viral protein
sequence and the top ten prevalent variants for each country were then plotted (excluding singleincidence variants) (Figure 2). In total, 1010 non-synonymous mutations were detected in EMR
countries, out of which ten common variants were found among the majority of sequences:
NSP12_P323L, S_D614G, NS3_Q57H, N_R203K, N_G204R, N_S194L, NSP6_L37F,
NSP2_V198L, NS8_L84S and N_S202N. Besides, many country-specific substitutions were

detected (here defined as found in 3 other countries or less, and not listed in other countries’ most
common mutations). For instance, NSP5_G71S was found in 67% of Oman’s sequences,
NSP12_G823S in 24% of Egypt’s sequences, and NSP12_M666I in 75% of Palestine’s sequences
(Figure 2). NSP12_P323L and S_D614G were predominantly detected in 10 out of 15 countries.
S_D614G was also dominant in Bahrain. In Kuwait and Iran, NSP6_L37F and NSP2_V198L were
the most frequently reported variants.
Next, we used the Nextclade tool from Nextstrain to assign clades (GISAID nomenclature) to the
sequences (Figure 3A) [20]. Of all sequences from EMR countries, 65.6% belonged to the G (20A
per Nextstrain clades), GR (20B), and GH (20C) clades, which emerged following the introduction
of the S_D614G variant (Figure 3B, [21]). Moreover, these clades were almost exclusively
represented as early as February and March in Saudi Arabia. In UAE and Egypt clade distribution
was heterogeneous with multiple clades cocirculating between February through August (Figure
3C). In Oman, multiple clades were introduced into the country in February and March, but GH
predominated as of April.
More specimens were sequenced from males in the EMR (2.05:1 male-to-female in top four
represented countries, independent t-test p < 0.004): Saudi Arabia (4.44:1), UAE (2.25:1), Oman
(1.42:1) and Egypt (1.49:1) (Figure 4A). No statistically significant difference in gender
distribution of the top represented SARS-CoV-2 variants were observed in these countries
(independent t-test for all variants, p > 0.270) (Figure 6B). By analyzing the age distribution of
the top variants in these countries, we observed a statistically significant underrepresentation in
the number of sequences of children (0-9 years) (3.43% ± 1.21 S.E.M.) and young adolescents
(10-18 years) (2.26% ± 1.16), while adults (19-49) were mostly represented (62.5% ± 8.84)
(ANOVA; F = 73.4, p = 1.15E-9) (Figure 4C). For the three remaining age categories (19-49, 507

59 and >60 years), we report no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of the Wuhanlike or any of the identified variants (multivariate ANOVA for all variants, F < 0.906, p > 0.487)
(Figure 4D)
We next sought to determine whether a correlation exists between the incidence of the ten most
common variants and countries’ CFRs. Only seven countries were included in this analysis – Saudi
Arabia, Oman, UAE, Bahrain, Palestine, Morocco, and Jordan, where none of the variants was
significantly correlated with an increase in CFR (Figure 5). Consistent with previous studies [22,
23], we confirm that NSP12_P323L seems to have quickly co-evolved following S_D614G
introduction, as they are more often co-detected among SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (Figure
6A). This double variant ‘D614G & P323L’ is found to be evenly distributed among different age
groups in the top four represented countries (Figure 6B). After repeating the correlation analysis
while accounting for the single versus double occurrence of D614G and P323L, we found that
neither single nor double variants were significantly correlated with CFR (Figure 6C).
Finally, since sequences of Saudi Arabia and Oman were preferentially collected before July and
those of Morocco and Jordan before May (Figure 1C), we reran our analysis but this time
accounting for the cumulative incidence of the ‘D614G & P323L’ double variant and the CFR at
the end of each month. We observed no association between these two variables from March
through September (Supplementary Figure 2). To further investigate this correlation, we
considered the cumulative monthly incidence of ‘D614G & P323L’ and the monthly CFRs (Figure
7A), where Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Egypt showed a positive correlation between the incidence
of ‘D614G & P323L’ and the monthly CFR (R=0.772, P=0.126; R=0.921, P=0.079; R=0.771,
P=0.072 respectively). In contrast, UAE had a significantly negative correlation between ‘D614G
& P323L’ incidence and the monthly CFR (R=-0.824, P=0.023). This suggests that by accounting

for the change in CFR for each country with time the correlation between ‘D614G & P323L’
incidence and higher fatality does not necessarily hold true in contrary to previous findings [11,
19, 24].
Discussion
In this study, we analyzed whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 collected in the EMR
countries. Significant data gaps are notable, whereby sequences were lacking for seven EMR
countries – the majority of which are in war conflict zones (e.g., Syria, Libya, and Yemen [25]).
In general, large disparities in the availability of sequences are observed across EMR. Only four
countries reported >100 sequences spanning several months of the pandemic, with Saudi Arabia
exceeding 500 sequence submissions. These data gaps highlight the challenges for monitoring the
pandemic in developing countries particularly in conflict zones. It also emphasizes the importance
of building regional sequencing capacities for timely and continuous monitoring of viral evolution
during the pandemic [26, 27].
Despite the diversity in the substitutions detected across countries, only a handful of variants
predominated. For instance, a mere 6 out of 260 non-synonymous mutations (2.3%) in Saudi
Arabia and 5 out of 138 mutations (3.6%) in Oman were detected in more than 10% of the
respective total of sequences (Figure 2). This suggests that consistent with other studies, most
SARS-CoV-2 mutations are neutral or deleterious [10]. Although a random founder’s effect cannot
be ruled out, the increased frequency of certain substitutions might be attributable to a fitness
advantage [12, 23, 28-30]. For instance, the S_D614G was found to predominate all viral strains
globally (78% of sequences by May 2020) and was associated with increased viral loads in the
upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients [31]. Along the same line, Plante et al. recently
demonstrated that S_D614G enhanced viral replication and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in human

lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues and increased infectious virus loads in
hamsters’ nasal cavities [12]. Hou et al. further showed that the S_D614G variant displayed faster
transmission and increased competitive fitness in vivo compared to wild-type virus in hamsters
[32]. These findings were also confirmed in hACE2 knock-in mice as well as in ferrets [33]. On a
molecular level, S_D614G allows for more efficient infectivity by shifting the spike protein to a
more ‘open’ conformation that is more favorable of ACE2 binding [30].
Several studies reported a positive correlation between S_D614G incidence and mortality (CFR)
[11, 19, 24]. However, a more recent study of 25,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences in the United
Kingdom did not associate the incidence of this mutation with higher COVID-19 mortality or with
clinical severity in patients [34]. Similarly, Korber et al. did no find an association between
S_D614G and increased disease severity or hospitalization [31]. In our sequence set, we saw no
association between any of the ten most common mutations, including S_D614G, and CFRs of
select EMR countries (Figure 5). However, our data as well as others’ [22, 23] show that the
S_D614G is frequently coupled with another substitution, NSP12_P323L, suggesting co-evolution
of these variants (Figure 6A). In contrast to the well-studied S_D614G, the effect of
NSP12_P323L on viral fitness is much less understood [35, 36]. One study speculated that it
negatively impacts NSP8’s association with RdRp leading to an attenuated polymerase activity
[22], while another suggests it enhances hydrophobic NSP8-RdRp interactions leading to
improved processivity of RdRp and enhanced viral replication overall [23]. In all cases, it is
speculated that the ‘epidemiological success’ of the GH, G, and GR lineages could be attributed
to the combined viral fitness advantage conferred by both NSP12_P323L and S_D614G [22].
Therefore, it makes more sense to consider the combined effect of the ‘D614G & P323L’ double
variant on mortality and disease outcomes. Nonetheless, we found no correlation between the

cumulative incidence of the ‘D614G & P323L’ variant and CFRs in the EMR countries (Figure
6C), which confirms earlier observations that found no association between D614G & P323L and
deaths per million, CFR and patient status [22].
Considering the limitations due to the discrepant number of sequences available (as mentioned
above) or to country-specific variations in managing the COVID-19 pandemic (such as testing
capacity, age stratification, enforcing/relaxing lockdown policies, etc.), we assessed the
association of ‘D614G & P323L’ incidence with CFR within each of the top four represented
countries over time. Interestingly, we found a positive, albeit non-significant, correlation between
‘D614G & P323L’ incidence and COVID-19 CFR in Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Egypt, but a
statistically significant negative correlation in UAE (Figure 7B). This suggests that the reported
correlation between these variants and increased CFR might be a mere coincidence rather than true
causation. Noteworthy, our method of calculating daily/monthly CFR is credited for accounting
for a 13-day lag between cumulative cases and deaths [18]. Yet, it overestimates the case fatality
risk early on in the pandemic [37], a limitation that would apply to our final analysis. Then again,
considering the overwhelming discrepancy in fatality correlations between countries (especially
in UAE versus Oman with similar sequence counts (Figure 7B)), it is unlikely that early bias in
CFR estimation would have altered our conclusion. Additionally, a more accurate method to
estimate COVID-19 mortality would be the infection fatality rate (IFR), inferred from
seroprevalence studies. However, such data is only available for Iran, Pakistan, and Qatar out of
all EMR countries according to a recent WHO review [38].
On a final note, other genomic mutations were associated with milder disease, such as a major
deletion (Δ382; nucleotide positions: 27,848 to 28,229), which results in truncated ORF7b and
arrested transcription of ORF8 [39]. Patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Δ382 variant had less

systemic release of proinflammatory cytokines and better clinical outcomes (i.e. lower frequency
of hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen) than wild-type [40]. This variant, however, was not
present in any of our sequence cohort (data not shown). Additionally, we did not detect an S_
N439K variant, which enhances spike binding to its protein hACE2 and results in immune escape
from a panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies [41].
Overall, our analysis reveals the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in EMR and emphasizes the importance
of considering temporal incidence and concurrent mutations in disease correlations. Our study is
limited by the relatively low number of specimens sequenced per country spanning ten months of
COVID-19 pandemic. There is a critical need for continuous and consistent surveillance of SARSCoV-2 genomic variations in the EMR region.
