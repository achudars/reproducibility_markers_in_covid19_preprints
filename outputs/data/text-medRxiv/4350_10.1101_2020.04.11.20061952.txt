Abstract
As the pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) rages throughout the world, accurate modeling of the
dynamics thereof is essential. However, since the availability and quality of data varies dramatically from region to
region, accurate modeling directly from a global perspective is difficult, if not altogether impossible. Nevertheless, via
local data collected by certain regions, it is possible to develop accurate local prediction tools, which may be coupled
to develop global models.
In this study, we analyze the dynamics of local outbreaks of COVID-19 via a coupled system of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). Utilizing the large amount of data available from the ebbing outbreak in Hubei, China as a testbed,
we estimate the basic reproductive number, R0 of COVID-19 and predict the total cases, total deaths, and other
features of the Hubei outbreak with a high level of accuracy. Through numerical experiments, we observe the effects
of quarantine, social distancing, and COVID-19 testing on the dynamics of the outbreak. Using knowledge gleaned
from the Hubei outbreak, we apply our model to analyze the dynamics of outbreak in Turkey. We provide forecasts
for the peak of the outbreak and the total number of cases/deaths in Turkey, for varying levels of social distancing,
quarantine, and COVID-19 testing.

Keywords: quarantine, social distancing, COVID-19 testing, novel coronavirus (COVID-19), reproductive number,
forecasting, ordinary differential equations.

Introduction

In late 2019, the city of Wuhan in the province of Hubei, China experienced an outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19), the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This outbreak quickly
spread to all states of China and across the globe, being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO)
on 11 March 2020. The authorities imposed a strict lock-down on the city of Wuhan and other cities of the Hubei
province on 23 January 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020b). In the face of over sixty-seven thousand cases
and over three thousand deaths, the authorities continued strict enforcement of these measures (Chinese physicians,
2020; Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by Johns Hopkins CSSE, 2020). Finally, on 23 March 2020, Hubei reached
a significant milestone as the province’s health commission reported no new cases for seven consecutive days (World
Health Organization, 2020b; The New York Times, 2020). Shortly thereafter, after over two months of severe restrictions
on the movements of the Hubei population, the “2020 Hubei Lockdowns" were relaxed as the Hubei outbreak began to
wane, inspiring hope that the global pandemic might be able to be controlled.
Previous studies of COVID-19 provided the evidence of human-to-human transmission and revealed its similarity and
differences from SARS (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). However, data-driven simulation-based
studies are needed to understand the dynamics of the ongoing outbreak. Indeed, it is of the utmost importance to use
these tools to investigate the effectiveness of public health strategies, such as the number of COVID-19 tests carried
out to detect the infected, the level of quarantine/social distancing, and its efficiency in the transmission of COVID-19.
Many (preprint) studies investigate dynamics of this pandemic from a global perspective (see, e.g., (Imai, Dorigatti,
Cori, Riley, & Ferguson, 2020; Read, Bridgen, Cummings, Ho, & Jewell, 2020; Riou & Althaus, 2020; Shen, Peng, Xiao,
& Zhang, 2020; Zhao et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020)). Nevertheless, the large variations in both quality and availability
of data from region to region make direct global modeling of the dynamics of this pandemic exceedingly difficult.
As a result, in this study, we develop a model for dynamics of the pandemic from a local perspective. The many
“hotspots" of COVID-19 combined with the many travel restrictions in place throughout the world further suggest that
local models might provide more practical insights into the dynamics than their global counterparts. Indeed, it stands
to reason that accurate models for local regions can be coupled to develop reasonable models for larger regions.
As of 23 March 2020, around one-quarter of the global COVID-19 cases and consequent deaths occurred in Hubei.
The large proportion of data available from Hubei combined with the region’s recent achievements toward managing
their local outbreak suggest that the data from this region presents an excellent picture of the lifetime of an outbreak
of COVID-19. Indeed, as countries worldwide close their borders, cities and regions, and impose their own “shelterin-place,” quarantine, or lockdown orders in the face of the pandemic, the large amount of data available from Hubei
provides an excellent testbed for modeling the dynamics of a local outbreak of COVID-19.
In this study, we start by developing a SEIQR type deterministic model which uses a system of ordinary differential
equations to analyze the dynamics of the outbreak, in particular highlighting the effect of testing and the effects of
quarantine and social distancing in Hubei. We present estimates of the basic reproductive number R0 of COVID-19
in Hubei and perform a sensitivity analysis to deduce which parameters play significant roles in the transmission and
control of the outbreak in Hubei. In addition, we also provide 15-day forecasts of the fatality rate of the outbreak, the
number of cases, and the number of deaths depending on the data (Chinese physicians, 2020; Coronavirus COVID-19
Global Cases by Johns Hopkins CSSE, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020b) and outputs of our SEIQR model.
Finally, building on knowledge obtained from the Hubei outbreak, we apply our model to the outbreak in Turkey. We
forecast the peak of the outbreak and the total number of cases/deaths in Turkey, utilizing the extant COVID-19 data
from Turkey ((Ministry of Health (Turkey), 2020)).

Model formulation

A deterministic compartmental model has been developed by using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to understand
the dynamics of COVID-19 in Hubei, China (Chubb & Jacobsen, 2010; Keeling & Rohani, 2008; Kot, 2001). In the
model, the total population N (t) at time t is divided into the following six compartments: susceptible S(t), susceptible

in quarantine (isolated class) Sq (t), exposed E(t), infected (asymptomatic or having mild symptoms) I(t), reported
(infected) cases (hospitalized if get severe symptoms or quarantined if get mild symptoms) Iq (t), and recovered R(t). Note
that all individuals who, upon testing, test positive are immediately isolated. The transition flows among compartments
are given in Figure 1. The rate of reported cases iq denotes the number of individuals who transition from the infected
class I to the reported class Iq per day; it is also directly related to the daily number of COVID-19 tests carried out
during the outbreak.

Figure 1: Flow diagram illustrating the disease transitions among the compartments

Susceptible individuals make the transition to the Sq (t) compartment with a rate of
sq (1 − e−Iq )S.
Note that the main indicator of quarantine is the number of reported cases Iq . When the number of reported cases
increases in a state or country, then the quarantine is imposed or naturally taken as an option. Thus, when the number of
reported cases increases, then percentage or amount of people quarantined will increase. If the number of reported cases
falls to zero, the transition rate from S to Sq is zero and from Sq to S is qs . The individuals in S and Sq compartments
transition to compartment E (exposed) with a force of infection given by
λ(t) =

I(t)
N (t)

and disease transmission rate β. Note that, since the individuals in Sq transition to E compartment less frequently, a
reduction factor r is taken into count in the model. After an incubation period of 1/α, the individuals in E compartment
transition to I compartment (infected) with rate α. The individuals in I compartment will either transition to R
compartment (recovered) with a rate of γi or Iq compartment with a rate of iq , or die due to the disease with a rate
of µi . The individuals in Iq (reported (infected) individuals, who are hospitalized or quarantined) compartment either
transition to R compartment with a rate of γq or die due to disease with a rate of µq . The following (ODEs) system
represents dynamical behavior of the system.

Diseases free equilibrium and stability analysis

One of major concepts in an outbreak is disease free equilibrium (DFE), where the entire population is susceptible
(Keeling & Rohani, 2008; Diekmann, Heesterbeek, & Roberts, 2010). For the system (1), the DFE can be denoted
x∗ = (S ∗ , Sq∗ , E ∗ , I ∗ , Iq∗ , R∗ ) = (S ∗ , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).
To able to get the DFE for the system (1), we set the right hand side of the system (1) to zero and substitute the DFE
into the system. Hence, the DFE is found as
Π
x∗ = (S ∗ , Sq∗ , E ∗ , I ∗ , Iq∗ , R∗ ) = ( , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).
d
We then analyze whether the DFE is stable or not. Next-generation matrix (NGM) is used (Van den Driessche &
Watmough, 2002; Diekmann et al., 2010; Van den Driessche & Watmough, 2008) to determine the stability of DFE. We
rewrite our system (1) as:

x0i = fi (x) = Fi (x) − V (x) = Fi (x) − (Vi− (x) − Vi+ (x))
where x = (S ∗ , Sq∗ , E ∗ , I ∗ , Iq∗ , R∗ ) and i = 1, ..., 6 and
• Fi (x):= Rate of appearance of new infections in compartment i
• Vi+ (x):=Rate of transfer of individuals into compartment i by all other means
• Vi− (x):= Rate of transfer of individuals out of compartment i by all other means.
Hence, F and V are calculated for the system of (1):

The spectral radius of the NGM is the basic reproduction number, R0 defined as the average number of secondary
cases arising from an average primary infected case in an entirely susceptible population. The DFE is locally stable if
R0 < 1 (Van den Driessche & Watmough, 2002; Diekmann et al., 2010). The spectral radius of the NGM given in (2)

ρ(FV−1 ) = R0 =

αβ
(α + d)(iq + γi + µi + d)

Since we do not consider the individuals in Sq compartment as a part of the DFE, we do not see any effect of
quarantine on R0 . However, sq indirectly changes the other parameter values such as β, iq , therefore, R0 value changes
with sq indirectly. Note that α, β are positively correlated with R0 and iq , γi , µi , d are negatively correlated with R0 for
the system (1). Note that we might control the disease with increasing quarantine rate of infected individual iq . Thus,
if
iq >

αβ
− γi − µi − d
(α + d)

then the DFE is locally stable and the disease dies out when sufficiently close to DFE. Biologically, if the infected
individuals can be detected in a sufficiently short time another word, the number of test to detect the number of cases
increase, then the disease can be controlled.

Parameter estimation

In this part, we estimate the parameters in the system (1), so we fit our model with the daily reported cumulative
number of cases and deaths, which are provided by (World Health Organization, 2020b) and (Chinese physicians, 2020).
We use the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method and minimize the sum of the squares of differences between the daily
reported data and those predicted by our model. The goodness of the fit is measured by computing the associated
relative error of the fit using the formula

where Ci and Ĉl are exact and estimated cumulative(infected) cases, and Di and D̂l are exact and estimated cumulative
deaths. To estimate the number of COVID-19 deaths, we sum the number of deaths coming from the infected class I and
the reported (infected) class Iq . Note that the natural deaths in the infected class I and the reported (infected) class Iq
are also included in the total number of deaths. We used an ode45 solver with fmincon from the Optimization Toolbox
of MATLAB. By using the initial conditions: S(0) = 59, 000, 000, Sq (0) = 0, Iq (0) = 258, and R(0) = 0, we estimate
all the parameters of the model together with estimating the initial number of exposed E and infected I, except the
natural death rate d, recruitment rate Π, and incubation period α. We used 4.2 days for the average incubation period

that is provided by (Nishiura et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Sanche et al., 2020). The natural death and recruitment
rate are provided by (World Health Organization, 2020a).
The simulation results obtained for the cumulative number of (infected) cases C and cumulative deaths D by fitting
the model with the data from January 20, 2020 to March 23, 2020 are depicted in Figure 2. These figures show a
reasonably good fit with the total relative error 0.06 (6%). Most of the error comes from the fit of cumulative cases,
especially around February 12, 2020. In February, China began to report clinically diagnosed cases in addition to
laboratory-confirmed cases, and on February 12, 2020, 13,332 clinically (rather than laboratory) cases reported even
though they were diagnosed in the preceding days and weeks. Due to the very small number of cases reported after
March 23, 2020, we chose to fit the model using only data from before this date.

Figure 2: Fitting the model to the data from January 20, 2020 to March 23, 2020 in Hubei: the cumulative number of
(infected) cases and deaths (Parameter values used are as given in Table 1 ).

Simulations

In this section, we discuss 15-day forecasting of the outbreak, the effect of quarantine, and the effect of testing in Hubei.
We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to see which parameters play important role in the dynamics of the outbreak.

5.1

Effect of quarantine (Self-isolation)

When we look at the change in the quarantine class, nearly the entire province of Hubei was quarantined by February 15,
2020 (See Figure 3, February 15 corresponds the day 25 in the figure). The percentage of the population transitioning
from the susceptible class to the quarantine class attains its maximum level between January 27, 2020 and February
10, 2020, and by February 15, almost all of the population were in quarantine. This result makes sense since the state
government imposed a quarantine in the state on January 23, 2020, initially recommending quarantine and finally forcing
the people into quarantine to guarantee social distancing. This action seems to have worked to great effect, reducing
the contact rate by about 98.9% (See Table 1 for the parameter, r, the reduction rate due to the quarantine).

Figure 3: Transitions from the susceptible class to the quarantine class during the outbreak in Hubei

When we reduce the quarantine rate, sq from 0.096 to 0.0864 (10% reduction) and do not change the remaining
parameters, the number of cases and deaths would be about 141090 and 6562, respectively. Similarly, when we increase
the quarantine rate, sq from 0.096 to 0.1056 (10% increase), the number of cases and deaths would be about 39334
and 1829, respectively. Thus, any change in the quarantine rate makes very significant change in total number of cases
and deaths. Furthermore, see the sensitivity analysis section below, the quarantine rate is a significant parameter in
the dynamics of the outbreak as well as its efficiency, which is explained by the parameter, r is also significant in the
dynamic of the outbreak.

5.2

15-day Forecasting

We used parameters in Table 1 for 15-day forecasting. Figure 4 shows the estimated number of infected cases for 80
days. The plot on the left depicts the estimated number of exposed and the right plot depicts the estimated number of
reported (infected) cases Iq . As it can be seen, the number of individuals in each of these classes tends to zero, which
implies that the outbreak is almost over, and so new cases may not be recorded in Hubei. As it can be seen from the
change in infected class, the outbreak reaches its peak about February 9, 2020. The infected class I also shows how
many people were out with no symptoms or mild symptoms during the outbreak.

Figure 4: The plot on the left depicts the number of exposed cases and the plot on the right depicts the number of
infected cases with initial conditions S(0) = 59, 000, 000, Sq (0) = 0, E(0) = 142, I(0) = 69, Iq (0) = 258, R(0) = 0 for 80
days
In Figure 5, the plot on the left shows the estimated number of cumulative reported (infected) cases and the right

plot shows the estimated number of cumulative deaths. As of 30 March 2020, there were no reported cases in Hubei in
the past week and the total number of cases and total number of deaths were 67801 and 3187, respectively. Our model
(1), predicts the number of cases and deaths with high accuracy with 6 percent relative error. We estimated the fatality
rate of the outbreak in Hubei as approximately 4.8% with the estimated number of cases, about 67994 and deaths,
about 3254.

plot on the right depicts the simulated cumulative number of deaths in Hubei

5.3

Sensitivity analysis

Several parameters play important roles in the model (1). These parameters were estimated with existing data as of
(Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by Johns Hopkins CSSE, 2020). In order to determine the set of parameters
that are statistically significant regarding the number of cumulative infected cases, we conduct a sensitivity analysis
of the model. We utilized a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC)
method (Marino, Hogue, Ray, & Kirschner, 2008). We use a range given in Table 2 to sample parameters from a
uniform distribution, then use these samples as input variables when we run the system (1) with initial conditions
S(0) = 1000, Sq (0) = 0, E(0) = 10, I(0) = 3, Iq (0) = 0, R(0) = 0 for 90 days. The number of cumulative infected cases is
the output variables in sensitivity analysis. Table 2 shows PRCC values, p-values and the range for each corresponding
parameters.

high PRCC values in the dynamics of the outbreak. Therefore, it is of interest to study how the number of cumulative
infected cases changes when sq , iq , r, and β are varied and other parameters are held the same as in Table 1 and the
initial condition same as before. Figure 6 shows the results of these experiments, how the number of cumulative cases
changes for different values of sq , iq , r, and β.

Figure 6: Number of cases at final time with respect to each parameters
Figure 6 shows that an increase in the quarantine rate, sq , sharply decreases the number of cumulative cases, in
range [0.005, 0.2] and the quarantine rate of infected individuals, iq , decreases the number of new cases mostly in range
[1.5, 4.5]. Increasing the reduction rate r, due to the quarantine, increases the number of cumulative cases mostly in
range [0.1, 0.6] and the disease transmission rate, β increases the number of cases mostly in range [4, 10].
It is also important to analyze how R0 value varies with β and iq . Thus, we vary β in the range [1, 10] and iq in
the range [0.1, 4] while keeping all other parameters the same in Table 1. Figure 7 shows the boxplot of β and iq . We
observe iq affects R0 in a wider range compare to β. Thus, the range of R0 will change roughly between 3 and 8. In
addition, the value of R0 drops below 1 when iq is above 5.1.

Figure 7: Change in R0 when we vary β with the rage [1,10], or iq with the range [0.1, 4].

The rate of reported (infected) cases, iq is related to the number of tests given during the outbreak to identify the
infected people. Thus, increasing the number of tests will increase the rate of case reporting iq . This will reduce the
number of cases (see Figure 6) and, consequently, the number of deaths due to the outbreak. When we increase the
rate of reported (infected) cases iq by about 10%, the number of cases and number of deaths are estimated to be 36040
and 1639, respectively. Decreasing the rate about 10%, the number of cases and number of deaths are estimated to be
14084 and 6724, respectively.

Forecasting the peak of the outbreak, number of cases/deaths in Turkey

In the part, we fit the model (1) with available COVID-19 data from Turkey ((Ministry of Health (Turkey), 2020)).
We fit the model (1) with Turkish data from March 10, 2020 to April 10, 2020, and get about 5.9% relative error
in the fit by using the equation (3). We estimate the four parameters iq , sq , β, and r, which are not only the most
significant parameters in the dynamics of outbreak, but also are specific to each country since they are related to the
number of COVID-19 tests administered iq , the number of individuals in quarantine sq , the contact rate of individuals
β, and the efficiency of quarantine r in each country. Therefore, by using the initial conditions: S(0) = 83, 000, 000,
Sq (0) = 0, Iq (0) = 1, and R(0) = 0, we estimate these four parameters together with the initial number of exposed and
infected individuals. We do not estimate the rest of the parameters, employing the parameters in Table 1. Therefore,
our results in this section will depend on observed dynamics of the outbreak in Hubei as well as the available Turkish
data (((Ministry of Health (Turkey), 2020)). Note that the quarantine rate and the rate of reported cases (which, we
stress, is related to number of COVID-19 tests) can be increased, and the increase still may have significant effect toward
the reduction of the number of cases (See Figure 6, sensitivity analysis), but increasing the reduction rate r does not
make very significant changes by way of the number of cases in Turkey since it is very close to its maximum level (See
Figure 6, sensitivity analysis part). Thus, we will vary only the quarantine rate sq and the rate of reported cases iq in
forecasting the peak of the outbreak and the number of cases/deaths in Turkey.

The rate of reported cases is about 1.8; this rate is larger than what we observed in Hubei. This implies that in
terms of numbers of COVID-19 tests conducted per day, Turkey is now doing a better job than Hubei, China at a
comparable time in Hubei’s outbreak. The efficiency of quarantine also seems to be very good in Turkey, given the
approximately 85% reduction in the contact rate of COVID-19 obtained by our parameter estimation. On the other
hand, the quarantine rate is about 0.088, which is small when compared with the quarantine rate in Hubei (the rate was
0.096 in Hubei). In Hubei, the population transitioned to quarantine class very quickly (almost in two weeks), but in
Turkey the movement to quarantine has been very slow in comparison (see Figure 8), suggesting why the contact rate
is higher in Turkey when we compare to the contact rate in Hubei (See Table 1 and 3 for these rates).

Figure 8: Transitions from the susceptible class to the quarantine class during the outbreak in Turkey after the first
cases reported on March 10, 2020

It is still possible to increase the quarantine rate (the rate, per day, of transition to quarantine class) and the number
of COVID-19 tests given each day in Turkey to make a reduction in the number of cases and deaths (See Figures 9 and
10). In Figures 9 and 10, the red curves are obtained using base parameters from Table 1 and 3, and the other curves
obtained by varying the quarantine rate sq and the rate of reported cases iq . When we use the base parameter values
which are obtained from our fitting, Turkey then will have about 203,700 cases and 8,269 deaths. If Turkey can increase
the number of individuals in quarantine and the number of daily COVID-19 tests, then, depending on the magnitude
of the increases, the number of cases and deaths can decrease significantly (see Figures 9 and 10). When we look at
trajectories of cumulative cases and deaths in Figures 9 and 10, in the worst-case scenario (the black curves) of the
study, Turkey will have about 281,500 cases and 11,430 deaths. These projections decrease to 148,100 cases and 6,005
deaths if Turkey can increase the number of individuals in quarantine and the number of COVID-19 tests.

The peak of the outbreak in Turkey is also very sensitive to the quarantine rate sq and the rate of reported cases iq .
Depending on the change in quarantine rate and the rate of reported cases iq , the peak of outbreak in Turkey can be
seen between the day 42 (April 20,2020) and day 48 (April 26, 2020), and the outbreak will almost die out by the day
150 (at the end of July 2020, see Figure 11).

Conclusion and Discussion

Our analysis suggests that quarantine greatly reduced the number of cases and deaths seen in Hubei’s COVID-19
outbreak. In addition, while quarantine does not appear in the representation of R0 , it still indirectly reduces R0 . We
also saw that the dynamics of the outbreak is very sensitive to the quarantine rate sq and contact rate β, as indicated
by our sensitivity analysis. The basic reproductive number is estimated as 5.49 and the study shows that any change in
β or iq directly affects the basic reproductive number.
The quarantine decidedly reduces the number of cases and deaths. Increasing (or decreasing) the speed of movement
from the susceptible class to the quarantine class by about 10% would double (or half) the number of cases and deaths
due to the outbreak (This speed of movement is controlled by the rate sq ). Of course, the efficiency of the quarantine is
also very important. In our model, the efficiency of the quarantine measured by the reduction rate, r. The reduction rate
shows how much reduction is effected in the contact of COVID-19 thanks to the quarantine. Based on our sensitivity
analysis, this parameter is very important (see Figure 6). Our model shows that the quarantine in Hubei was almost
perfect since it caused about 98.9 percent reduction in the contact rate of COVID-19.
Another important parameter that plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the outbreak is the rate of reported
(infected) cases iq which is directly related to the number of tests given to detect infected individuals. Similar to the
quarantine rate sq , the rate of reported (infected) cases iq could double (half) when we have 10% reduction (or increase)
in the rate.
As of 30 March 2020, there were no reported cases in Hubei in the past week and the total number of cases and total
number of deaths were 67801 and 3187, respectively. Based on our 15-days forecasting, the number of cases in Hubei
was projected to be about 67994 and the number of deaths was projected to be about 3254. Thus, we estimate the
fatality rate of the outbreak to be about 4.8% in Hubei. Our model gives about 6% relative error and we are confident
that using the model will be helpful for forecasting local outbreaks of the pandemic in other regions.
From existing COVID-19 data from Turkey and the dynamics of our model understood from the Hubei analysis, the
outbreak in Turkey is expected to reach its peak between April 20 and April 26 depending on the number of individuals
(amount of people) in quarantine and the number of COVID-19 tests carried out each day in Turkey. The daily number
of tests given in Turkey is large when we compare to the rates of reported cases in Hubei. As we showed in the sensitivity
analysis, increasing the number of COVID-19 tests and the number of individuals in quarantine will significantly reduce
the number of cases (and deaths). Based on our forecasting, the number of cases will be about 203,700 with the range
148,100 and 281,500, and the number of deaths will be about 8,269 with the range 6,005 and 11,430 depending on
quarantine rate, sq and the rate of reported cases, iq in Turkey. Thus, in any cases that are given in Figure 9 and 10,
the fatality rate of COVID-19 will be about 4.1% in Turkey.

Based on the results above, our main concern in Turkey is the proportion of people in quarantine. The quarantine
rate is 0.088 in Turkey, a low number when we compare with the quarantine rate in Hubei, China (it was 0.096 in
Hubei). If Turkey can increase the number of individuals in quarantine, then the number of cases and deaths may
decrease significantly (See Figure 9 and 10 to see the effect of quarantine in COVID-19 cases and deaths). Small changes
in quarantine rate make significant changes in the total number of cases and deaths in Turkey.
The efficiency of the quarantine in Turkey is about 85 percent, meaning that it causes 85 percent reduction in the
contact rate of COVID-19. Thus, the quarantine rate, sq and its efficiency is very important to be able to contain the
outbreak (See Table 3 for reduction rate, r and Figure 6 for the effect of reduction rate in the total number of cases).
As of April 10, 2020, the number of COVID-19 tests given each day in Turkey had increased to 30,000 ((Ministry
of Health (Turkey), 2020)). If the number is increased further, then it also will decrease the total number of cases and
deaths in Turkey (See Figure 9 and 10). Indeed, it is expected that the number of cases may drop below to 203,700 and
stay between 148,100 and 203,700. Similarly, this could cause the number of deaths in Turkey to decrease below 8,269
and stay between 6,005 and 8,269.
