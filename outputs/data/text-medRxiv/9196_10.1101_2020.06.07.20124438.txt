Abstract

Polymerase Chain reaction (PCR) is a key tool to diagnose Covid-19. Yet access to PCR is often
limited. In this paper, we develop a clinical strategy for prescribing PCR to patients based on
data from COVIDOM, a French cohort of 54,000 patients with clinically suspected Covid-19
including 12,810 patients tested by PCR. Using a machine learning algorithm (a decision tree),
we show that symptoms alone are sufficient to predict PCR outcome with a mean average
precision of 86%. We identify combinations of symptoms that are predictive of PCR positivity
(90% for anosmia/ageusia) or negativity (only 30% of PCR+ for a subgroup with
cardiopulmonary symptoms): in both cases, PCR provides little added diagnostic value. We
deduce a prescribing strategy based on clinical presentation that can improve the global
efficiency of PCR testing.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) epidemic started in China in December 2019 and has spread
worldwide, infecting more than 5.5 million people by May 25th (1). Making the diagnosis of
Covid-19 infection can be difficult, since the clinical presentation is versatile, including
associations of fever, myalgia, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, gastro-intestinal signs,
headaches, upper respiratory tract symptoms... (2). Several tests have proved helpful to diagnose
Covid-19 infection (3–5). The current reference test is reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), which attests the presence of viral RNA in the sample, usually nasopharyngeal
swabs (6).
There is a strong need for a practical strategy to approach diagnostic investigations. PCR is
costly and remains difficult to use in practice with a significant time from sampling to results (7).
Moreover, PCR is highly specific of the presence of viral nucleic acid in the sample, yet it lacks
sensitivity: a negative test does not negate the possibility that an individual is infected (4). This
creates a diagnostic doubt, and first-line alternative investigations, such as chest imaging, may
sometimes be more relevant.
We analyze the PCR usefulness as a diagnostic tool in different clinical presentations, in order to
develop and assess a strategy for PCR prioritization in patients with suspected Covid-19. For
this, we first provide a statistical description of the PCR positive population; we use propensityscore weighting to correct for the non-homogeneity of testing in the whole cohort. We then
identify combinations of symptoms that are predictive of PCR result, using decision trees, in a
supervised machine learning approach. We base our analyses on a large ambulatory cohort of
54,000 patients followed by an unique telemonitoring platform in the greater Paris region.

Methods
We first describe the access to PCR testing, based on patients’ characteristics and symptoms. We
study whether PCR-positive (PCR+) and PCR-negative (PCR-) patients have different clinical
profiles. We then perform a multivariate predictive study: we identify combinations of symptoms
that are predictive of either high or low chance of PCR positivity with weighting on the
propensity score for PCR testing. Based on these identified combinations, we propose a triage
strategy to target PCR testing in patients for whom PCR results will bring the highest additional
information for Covid-19 diagnosis.

Population - COVIDOM telemonitoring program
In France, a telemonitoring web-application called COVIDOM has been developed for home
management of suspected or confirmed Covid-19 patients. In this application, self-administered
daily questionnaires can trigger alerts that are handled in a regional medicalized control center. It
was launched in the Greater Paris area on March 9th and aims at efficiently detecting patients at
risk of deterioration while relieving the burden for healthcare professionals. Patients are included
in COVIDOM after seeking medical care in an outpatient setting (emergency services or general
practitioners) or after being discharged from hospital. We excluded all patients under 18.

Data
Patients in COVIDOM filled out questionnaires, specifying characteristics (age, sex, weight,
height), comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma,
heart failure, coronary heart disease, cancer under treatment, chronic kidney disease, other
chronic disease), smoking status, symptoms since the beginning of the suspected Covid-19
disease (fatigue, myalgia, breathlessness, ageusia, anosmia, anorexia, chest pain, chest
oppression, cough, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, shivers, rash, frostbites, conjunctivitis, other
symptoms), hospitalisation history, investigations that were performed (PCR, chest CT-scan,
chest X-ray), and PCR results. The questionnaire is available in Fig.S1. These patient-reported
data are completed with PCR results from the French Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris
(AP-HP) data warehouse, also known as Entrepôt de Données de Santé (EDS). AP-HP is the
network of all university hospitals in the greater Paris region. PCR were performed according to
international guidelines on respiratory samples, mainly nasopharyngeal swabs (6).
During registration, patients provided an electronic consent for the Covidom telemonitoring
program and they were informed of the potential use of anonymized data for research purposes.
This use was approved by the Scientific and ethical committee of APHP (IRB00011591).

Analyses
Access to PCR testing
In a retrospective analysis, we seek to identify patients who had PCR testing (Fig.1), and to
report associations of patient characteristics with PCR results (Fig.2). For this, we consider the
following covariates: sex; age (quantized in 5 groups); tobacco consumption (current smoker or
not); comorbidites: respiratory, cardio-vascular, diabetes or obesity; presence of symptoms:
breathlessness, anorexia, tiredness, digestive signs (diarrhea or vomiting), conjunctivitis,
cutaneous symptoms (rash or frostbites), shivers, myalgia, cough, fever, cardiopulmonary
symptoms (breathlessness associated to chest pain or chest oppression) or chemosensory
impairment (anosmia or ageusia); ambulatory status (has the patient been hospitalized or not).
Within the population of patients who answered the questionnaire, we evaluate the associations
between patient characteristics and PCR testing: for this, we estimate odds ratio for each variable
using univariate logistic regression models. We test whether the odds ratio significantly differs
from 1 using a Wald test.
Associations of patient characteristics with PCR results
Within the tested population, we evaluate the association of each covariate with PCR results. To
account for the lack of homogeneity in testing and correct for a possible indication bias, we use a
propensity score for weighting each patient: for this, we estimate the probability of being tested
using a multivariate logistic model (with all covariates introduced above). Weighting results in a
pseudo-population of size twice the number of tested patients, where covariates proportion are
similar within the whole cohort and the tested population.
We then estimate one univariate logistic regression model per covariate to predict PCR
positivity, and report associated pseudo-counts (i.e. counts weighted using the propensity score)
and odds ratios. Complementarily, we compare the weighted proportion of a given covariate
within the PCR+ and PCR- populations.
Predicting PCR results from patient symptoms
To prioritize patients due for a PCR test, we seek combinations of symptoms that are predictive
of the PCR result. For this, we estimate a multivariate decision tree (8) that, for each patient,
predicts the result of the PCR test based on his/her symptoms. A decision tree recursively splits
the population based on the presence or not of a given symptom, so as to progressively separate
PCR+ and PCR- into different groups. It thus automatically provides predictive combinations of
symptoms, whose importance is then verified on a set of patients not used for estimation. As in
the univariate analysis, we use propensity score weighting during estimation and evaluation.

We train a decision tree on 80% of the tested patients and evaluate its performance on the 20%
held-out group. We repeat the training procedure across multiple separations of training and
held-out data to evaluate the variance of the predictive model performance. Details on decisiontree parameters, architecture choices and weighting procedure are reported in the supplementary
material. We report precision-recall curves, average precision of the model, and a description of
the splits performed by the trained decision tree. We evaluate the importance of each symptom in
predicting the PCR outcome by measuring how hiding this observed variable from the decision
tree affects its performance (9).
Finally, in each group defined by the decision tree, we report the odds ratio of being PCR+, and
report PCR+ proportion. Odds and proportions are weighted by propensity scores. We simplify
the decision tree to propose actionable rules to prioritize PCR access.

Results
Cohort description
From inception to May 6th, 54,358 patients were registered in COVIDOM by a physician for
daily monitoring, 31,323 answered the questionnaire (flow-chart of Fig.1a). 3774 patients (12%)
were included after hospitalization. There was a median of 16 days (IQ9-23) after the first
symptoms and 10 days (IQ2-16) after the inclusion in COVIDOM when the patients filled up the
forms (Fig.S2).
The mean age of the patients is 43.6 (SD14.3) with 28779 (92%) under 65 year-old. As detailed
in Fig.2 and Table S1, the most frequent symptoms in the whole cohort were fatigue (86%),
cough (64%), myalgia (54%), fever (50%), breathlessness (50%), and digestive symptoms
(46%). Breathlessness associated with chest oppression or pain was mentioned by 61%. Anosmia
and ageusia are present in respectively 32% and 32% of patients, with 26% presenting both
symptoms. Anosmia or ageusia is more frequent in women (28% of women present both
symptoms versus 22% of men, p<0.0001), and the mean age of patients with chemosensory
impairment is 42.2 years (SD13.2), younger than the rest of the cohort (p<0.0001).
In total, 12,810 patients (41%) were tested by PCR, after we excluded 75 patients with
undetermined results (0.6%). Chest imaging was performed in 5,010 patients(16%). In patients
who had PCR, the mean number of PCR was 1.2+/-0.6 and the median time between PCR1 and
PCR2 was 7 days (IQ2-19) (Fig.1b and Fig.S3).

Differentiated access to PCR testing in the COVIDOM cohort
Studying PCR access in the COVIDOM cohort shows that the test is not systematically
performed for all symptomatic patients, as detailed in Fig.1c and Fig.S5. Patients more prone to
be tested are women (43% vs 37%, p<0.0001), elderly patients (p<0.0001), and non-smokers

(43% vs 32%, p<0.0001). Patients with comorbidities are tested more often (44% vs 37%,
p<0.0001), especially patients with diabetes (53%), cardio-vascular disease (48%) or obesity
(47%), but not patients with respiratory comorbidities. Concerning clinical presentation, patients
with anosmia or ageusia are more likely to be tested (respectively 51% and 50%). On the
opposite, patients with cardiopulmonary signs, i.e. breathlessness associated with chest
oppression or chest pain, are as likely to be tested as the whole cohort (40%). As expected,
patients who were hospitalized before or after their inclusion in COVIDOM were tested more
often than outpatients (3,134, 80%, against 10,724, 40%).

Associations of patient characteristics with PCR results
The remaining analyses are performed with propensity-score weighting; from now, we report
counts, proportions and odds ratios for the weighted population, unless specified otherwise.
Fig.S5 reports weighted counts and proportions in access to PCR testing: weighting ensures that
the characteristics of the tested population are similar to those of the whole cohort.
PCR is positive in 63% of tested cases. We report results on the tested population in Fig.2a and
2b, and Table S1. We do not find any significant effect of age and sex. Tested smokers are less
likely to be PCR+ (46% are PCR+ vs 66%, p<0.0001). Patients without comorbidities are more
likely to be PCR+ (66% vs 60%, p<0.0001), as well as patients with anosmia, ageusia, anorexia,
fever, fatigue, cough, myalgia (p<0.0001). In contrast, patients with breathlessness and
cardiopulmonary symptoms are less likely to be PCR+ (60% vs 63%, p<0.0001), suggesting that
PCR is less sensitive for patients with pulmonary symptoms than for other patients with
suspected Covid-19. In echo to this observation, patients with respiratory comorbidities are less
likely to be tested positive than other patients (52% vs 63%, p<0.0001). Other comorbidities
have no significant association with PCR results.
Hospitalized patients are more likely to be PCR+ than non-hospitalized patients (75% vs 61%,
p<0.0001), a potential cause of bias in our analysis; yet, as indicated in Fig.2c and Fig.S4, the
findings above also hold within the population of non-hospitalized patients. We note that PCR
tests performed more than 12 days after the first symptoms were 58% negative (4,2 times more
negative than average, Fig.S3b).

Anosmia/ageusia, cardiopulmonary signs and fever predict PCR result in
patients with clinically suspected Covid-19 infection
The strong association between symptoms and PCR result encourages us to verify how
symptoms effectively predict the PCR result. We focus on symptoms as predictive factors to
train a decision tree for PCR testing.

On the held-out group (2,562 patients), the decision tree (trained on 10,248 patients) achieves
0.83 mean average precision (Fig.3c, 0.63 chance level). It identifies combinations of symptoms
that efficiently separate PCR+ from PCR- patients (Fig.3a), and predict PCR results on newly
seen patients. Permutation importance (PI, Fig.3b) tests show that anosmia/ageusia is the most
important splitting criteria (PI=0.133 +/- 0.009), followed by cardiopulmonary symptoms
(PI=0.017 +/- 0.004) and fever (PI=0.016 +/- 0.004). As reported in Fig.3a, in the evaluation
cohort, 86% of the patients with anosmia/ageusia are PCR+ (OR 6.18, IC[5.89-6.47]). In the non
anosmic/ageusic group (1,403 patients), patients with fever are less likely to be PCR+ (OR 0.83,
IC[0.80-0.86]). Patients with cardiopulmonary symptoms and no fever are very unlikely to be
PCR+ (OR 0.18, IC[0.17-0.20]). The decision tree splits on the held-out data and on the whole
cohort are reported in Fig.S6 and Fig.S7, with associated values reported in tables S2 and S3.
Overall, the trained decision tree identifies combinations of symptoms that are predictive of high
chance of PCR positivation (anosmia or ageusia), or low chance of PCR positivation (no
anosmia or ageusia, no fever but cardiopulmonary symptoms). Those respectively correspond to
cases where Covid disease is very likely, and cases for which PCR has a low sensitivity. For
patients experiencing such symptoms, performing a PCR has a low marginal value to adjust
Covid-19 diagnosis.
The findings that we report hold for multiple training/held-out data separation (Fig.S8); they
remain similar without propensity score weighting (Fig.S9), and when performing the analysis
within the population of ambulatory patients only (Fig.S10).

Diagnostic strategy based on symptoms to target PCR testing in patients
suspected with Covid-19 infection
We adapt the estimated decision tree into an actionable testing strategy based on clinical signs
(Fig.4a), taking into account that PCR positivity establishes the diagnosis of Covid-19 infection,
but that PCR negativity is of little clinical help, due to his low sensitivity (4). The grouping of
patients that have answered the questionnaire based on the decision tree criteria is reported in
Fig.4b, among with the results of PCR in each group. Anosmia or ageusia (observed in 45% of
tested patients) are highly predictive of PCR+ (86% PCR+), which justifies establishing a
clinical diagnosis of Covid-19 infection without performing a PCR. In the absence of
ageusia/anosmia, the association of fever and cough (19% of patients) is not specific to Covid-19
infection: PCR is useful in this case (65% of the group is PCR+).
Cardiopulmonary symptoms, i.e. breathlessness with chest oppression or pain, are predictive of
negative PCR results (28% of the group is PCR+, 8% of tested patients). PCR thus has a poor
diagnostic value in this case, justifying the use of another diagnostic investigation, especially in
those patients who may be at high risk of complication. The rest of the patients is a
heterogeneous group presenting with flu-like illness, moderate breathlessness or digestive

symptoms and could benefit from PCR or other investigations depending on the physician
evaluation.
Fig.4c reports numbers without propensity-score weighting, with similar findings. Among
patients that have answered the survey, the decision tree validates the diagnosis of Covid-19
without any investigation in 11,760 patients (true counts, 38% of the whole cohort). It leads to
maintaining PCR as a first-line diagnostic tool in 19% of cases. Among patients without
anosmia/ageusia and with cardiopulmonary signs, chest imaging was only performed in 18%
(13% among the complementary group), where the decision tree recommends systematic testing.

Discussion
In this study, we estimate a model that predicts PCR results from clinical presentation, based on
12,810 symptomatic patients with suspected Covid-19 infection, in order to prioritize PCR
access. Until now, several tests have been used to confirm the diagnosis of Covid-19 infection,
and PCR is the closest to a gold standard. It is a very specific test for this disease, with a high
positive predictive value. Yet it is not sensitive to the disease in general (4), due to the possible
presence of virus in other localizations and to many biases in its realization (9). High priority
patients who should be tested include hospitalized patients, symptomatic healthcare workers,
symptomatic residents in congregate living settings, and selected contacts. Ideally, all
symptomatic patients, regardless of the symptoms, and all selected asymptomatic people should
be tested (10). Other investigations, especially chest imaging, improve the sensitivity of Covid19 diagnosis in some groups of patients (11). Serological tests are developing but turn positive
late for diagnosis (12). In this context, a diagnostic strategy combining clinical evaluation and
targeted investigations is necessary, to ensure effective identification of all cases and security of
patients at risk of severe disease. Artificial intelligence has been used to optimize diagnostic
testing in the epidemics context, based on CT-scan automatized interpretation, whereas our
approach is based on the clinical presentation (13).
The COVIDOM cohort is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest ambulatory population with
suspected Covid-19. Patients are younger than in the series of hospitalized patients and
predominantly women (2). Our clinical findings are congruent with data already published.
Focusing on the patients with chemosensory symptoms, who form an important clinical
subgroup in our decision algorithm, we found the same characteristics in the COVIDOM cohort
as in the literature: in comparison with Covid-19 patients in general, they are younger,
predominantly women, and they have fewer comorbidities, except for asthma which was more
frequent (14,15). According to recent discussions, anosmia is likely due to both mucosal
inflammatory reaction and central nervous system infection through the olfactory nerve (22), as
described for SARS-CoV in mice (23).
Access to PCR in the COVIDOM cohort does not follow the theoretical guidelines: PCR is
neither systematically performed on hospitalized patients (80%), nor on symptomatic patients
(41%). Some groups of patients, not supposed to be at high risk, including women and nonsmokers, are tested more often (both 43%). In addition to showing that PCR is not available for
all patients who should be tested, Fig.1c underlines that some patients with a priori higher
respiratory risk (any comorbidity, smokers) are less likely to be tested (p<0.0001), which was not
expected. This disparity in PCR testing is not due to explicit medical targeting, but to limited
access, which confirms the need for a strategy to prioritize those tests. Although political
decisions are being taken to make testing as widely available as possible, the number of PCR

will be limited. Moreover, performing PCR in some patients will not systematically help us to
correctly diagnose, isolate and treat.
We found that, in the Covid-19 epidemic context, the clinical presentation is predictive of the
positivity of PCR in some groups. Patients with anosmia or ageusia represent 50% of our cohort,
47% of symptomatic patients with PCR+ in Europe (14), and up to 86% of symptomatic patients
referred to an ENT clinic (15). We show that 90% of tested patients with these symptoms (OR
5.61-6.14) turn out to be PCR+, which is consistent with the high positive predictive values of
anosmia (84.7%) and ageusia (88.1%) for SARS-CoV-2 infection found by Fontanet et al. also in
France (16). In the current context, those patients can be considered as infected with Covid-19
with little approximation even without PCR testing. This validates with statistical rigor the
empirical recommendations found in the literature (17,18). In addition, the specific form that
these symptoms take for Covid-19 limits the risk of false positive diagnosis: although the
prevalence of olfactory and taste dysfunction in adults ranges between 3.8% and 13.5% (19,20),
with 39% of cases retrospectively attributed to an upper respiratory tract infection (21),
unexplained sudden onset anosmia or ageusia is extremely rare in clinical practice. Finally, our
analysis is based on a very coarse evaluation of anosmia or ageusia, defined as the recent onset
of loss of smell or taste, as reported by the patient in a multiple choice question. There is no
doubt that critical and precise medical history taking helps reduce the rate of false positive
diagnoses (10% of PCR- in our cohort, which means maximum 10% of differential diagnosis),
thanks to the descriptions of SARS-CoV2-associated olfactory and gustatory symptoms
published recently (14,15).
Our analysis then underlines that in patients without chemosensory symptoms but with cough
and fever, which are non specific symptoms, representing 19% of our cohort, PCR results cannot
be predicted and testing has a relevant clinical value. PCR has a useful positive value and seems
clinically relevant to separate differential diagnoses, although PCR+ is not systematically
evidence of Covid-19 and proves only SARS-Cov-2 presence in the sample (4).
Finally, our study singles out a third particular group, namely patients with breathlessness and
chest pain or oppression, among those without anosmia/ageusia and fever with cough, namely
11% of our cohort. PCR testing has a poor diagnostic value in this group, with only 30% of
positive results. Whether the remaining patients have Covid-19 with PCR- or a differential
diagnosis is not established in our series. In both situations, chest CT-scan, whenever available,
may be more reliable by showing specific pulmonary lesions, such as ground-glass opacities
(13). One physiopathological hypothesis in Covid-19 transmission is that the SRAS-CoV-2 is
transmitted through the upper respiratory tract, where it could either remain, after a general
efficacious inflammatory reaction, or spread to the lower respiratory tract, causing severe
pneumonia. In this scenario, anosmia and ageusia would not only be of high diagnostic value:
they may be predictors of good outcome (19). This finding is compatible with the findings in our

cohort: the non anosmic/ageusic group is more likely to be admitted in hospital. A positive PCR
thus appears to be an indicator of persistent virus in the nose and throat, whereas a negative PCR
may indicate migration of the virus and potential respiratory complications.
In the COVIDOM cohort, applying the diagnostic strategy would lead to making a purely
clinical diagnosis in 37% of symptomatic cases. This would allow better targeting of PCR
testing, particularly indicated in non anosmic/ageusic patients with fever and cough. The other
patients who additionally present breathlessness, chest pain or oppression will rather benefit
from another first-line investigation: 70% of PCR are negative in this case despite Covid-19
suspicion, which suggests a high false negative rate.
As PCR testing has a low sensitivity to Covid-19 infection,we may wonder how many times this
test should be replicated for reliability. In some studies, PCR testing was performed as many
times as necessary to confirm the infection when clinical suspicion was very high (22,23). In our
study, the mean number of tests was 1.20 (SD 0.64) and did not differ in particular population
groups. The clinical presentation would be a clue for the clinician to decide whether repeating
the test will be useful, and the evolution may also lead to alternative investigations. Moreover, as
already observed (10), the delay between the first symptoms and the PCR test has a significant
effect on the PCR result (odds of being PCR+ are 1.03-1.04 times lower on day J+1 than day J,
cf Fig.S3b), which prompts to perform PCR as early as possible, in the absence of chemosensory
symptoms.
There are a number of important limits in our study. First, the results of this study are to be
interpreted in the specific setting of the Covid-19 epidemics. The cohort is recruited in a region
with a high prevalence of the disease, with up to 26% of infected people in some areas of France
(16). The criterion motivating inclusion in the COVIDOM cohort is the clinical suspicion by a
physician of Covid-19 infection. This inclusion criterion is subjective, and highly depends on the
epidemiological context in the area. Some patients with a differential diagnosis have inevitably
been included in the cohort. PCR- may be due, in our series and in general practice, to a false
negative result or to a differential diagnosis, so that PCR- is actually considered as diagnostically
inconclusive, due to its low sensitivity (4).
Most parameters analyzed were harbored from self-reported questionnaires, with an inevitable
rate of mistakes. In particular, performance of the test partially relies on the patient's recollection,
whereas PCR results are verified by a medical database. In addition, our study falls short of
considering that symptoms appear progressively. We analyze symptoms present during the
course of the disease; those may not be present during the first medical evaluation. However,
anosmia/ageusia are early signs, developing on average 4.4 days after infection (14). They are
likely to have developed when the patient seeks medical care (median 5 days, IQ2-8, after the
beginning of the symptoms in the COVIDOM cohort). Less importantly, we only analyze the

symptoms provided by the forms submitted to the patients. These forms did not investigate all
possible clinical signs; additional symptoms were identified manually in the patients
commentaries, especially headaches, vertigo and upper respiratory tract symptoms. Preliminary
analyses show that these items are not key symptoms to predict PCR results; yet they should be
probed in future clinical investigations.
Finally, in the methods we used, our analysis of PCR results is based on the tested population,
which is not representative of all patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. We challenged our
reweighting strategy by reproducing the same analysis without this strategy and note that a
similar decision tree is obtained, which shows that the final diagnostic algorithm is reliable. It
could also be completed by adding the date of the beginning of the symptoms and the patient’s
characteristics as predictors, in addition to the clinical presentation.

Conclusion
In the context of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, we found that the clinical presentation is predictive of
PCR+ in anosmic/ageusic patients, allowing to make the diagnosis without any investigation. We
propose that patients with fever and cough be tested by PCR, and we show that PCR does not
provide useful results for patients with breathlessness and chest pain or oppression. In that group,
chest imaging as a first-line investigation may be more useful. Our findings will help target PCR
tests in the symptomatic population, and contribute to crafting the best strategy to manage the
pandemic.

Figure Legends:
Figure 1: Differentiated access to PCR testing in patients who answered the COVIDOM survey (N=31,323).
a) Description of the investigations in the COVIDOM cohort combining the survey and the EDS database: 54,358
patients are included in the web-application for daily monitoring, among which 31,323 answered the complete
survey.
b) Description of repeated PCR testing for patients included in the Corona OMOP database (N=6,621). Patients
benefited from 1 to 10 PCR tests each. Median time between PCR1 and PCR2 was 8 days, PCR1 and PCR3: 13
days, PCR1 and PCR4: 15 days, PCR1 and PCR5: 21 days.
c) Access to PCR testing in patients who answered the COVIDOM survey, as a function of various patient
characteristics. The size of the black bar indicates the proportion that has been tested of a given group.. The
population is stratified based on demographic characteristics, tobacco usage, comorbidities (“any” includes any of
the following or hypertension, chronic kidney disease, cancer under treatment or other as indicated by the patient,
“respiratory” indicates asthma or COPD, “cardio-vascular” indicates heart failure or coronary disease, obesity a
BMI above 30), symptoms experienced at some point of the disease (“cardiopulmonary” indicates breathlessness
associated to chest oppression or chest pain), need for admission in hospital before or after inclusion in COVIDOM.
The right column indicates the odd-ratios of being tested in each group, compared to the complementary group. We
test whether these odds ratios significantly differ from 1 using a Wald test.
Table.S1 provides all numerical data.

to remove the testing-propensity confound. We report weighted counts/proportions/odds-ratios.

b.PCR results as a function of different characteristics in the tested population (cf Fig. 1c for categories). Odds ratios

anosmia, ageusia, anorexia, fever, fatigue, cough, myalgia. On the opposite, comorbidities, in particular respiratory
diseases, and symptoms such as breathlessness and cardiopulmonary symptoms are associated with PCR-.

Table.S1 provides all numerical data.

Figure 3: Marginal value of PCR testing in patients with clinically suspected Covid-19 infection. Estimation
and evaluation using testing propensity-score weights.
a) Decision paths of the tree, applied to evaluation patients. A decision tree classifier is trained on 80% of the tested
patients. It predict PCR positivity using 12 features: breathlessness, anorexia, tiredness, digestive signs
(diarrhea/vomiting), conjunctivitis, cutaneous symptoms (rash/frostbites), shivers, myalgia, cough, fever,
cardiopulmonary symptoms (breathlessness + chest pain/oppression) and chemosensory impairment
(anosmia/ageusia). We evaluate the decision tree on 20% held-out patients and illustrate how it splits this
population.
Each node is a splitting criterion (presence of the symptoms to the top, absence to the bottom). The colour of each
node corresponds to the odds ratio of being PCR+ at this stage of the decision path. For each leaf, the probability
and odds ratio of being PCR+ are reported (see Fig.S6, Fig.S.8 and Table.S1 for details).
b) Permutation features importance on the evaluation set. The permutation importance is an indicator of the
relevance of a feature at predicting PCR positivity. It measures the decrease in the model score (here, average
precision) when a single feature is randomly shuffled. We report the permutation importance on the left-out

the importance through 50 different permutations.

Figure 4: Added value of PCR testing in patients with clinically suspected moderate Covid-19 infection based
on their symptoms
a) Proposal of a diagnostic strategy in medical practice, for patients with clinical suspicion of moderate Covid-19
infection by a physician. Anosmia or ageusia are predictive of PCR+ and these patients could be diagnosed based on
clinical symptoms only. In case of fever and cough, PCR testing has a good diagnostic value. Then, breathlessness
associated with chest pain or oppression is predictive of PCR-, although these symptoms may be signs of Covid-19
pulmonary infection. Therefore, PCR is little valuable in this group and an alternative investigation, such as chest
imaging, is indicated. For the remaining patients, PCR is of little added value, but this group is heterogeneous and
PCR or alternative investigations should be considered depending on the clinical presentation.
b) Description of the different clinical groups defined by the decision tree. The non-weighted numbers, proportions
and odds-ratios of being PCR+ in each group are provided. PCR testing has a different added value for each group:
it is less useful for groups with PCR+ odds ratios far away from 1.
c) Same description as Fig. 4b) with propensity-score weighting. Findings are similar.
