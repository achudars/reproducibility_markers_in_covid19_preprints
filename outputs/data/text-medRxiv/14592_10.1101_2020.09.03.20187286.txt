Introduction
Accumulating evidence indicates an association between SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia and
hypercoagulable state of patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who require intensive
care (severe infection)1. It becomes be more and more clear that infections with SARS-CoV-2 did
not meet the criteria of disseminated intravascular coagualation (DIC) according to the International
Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) and the patterns of coagulation seem to be different
to severe infections2. Only in patients with severe aggravation of disease an overt DIC occurred3. At
the same time, however, the incidence of acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis,
ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and/or systemic arterial embolism in COVID-19 patients
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) is as high as 49%4. The pathophysiology of COVID-19
associated-thromboembolic events seems to be complex and multifactorial, involving interplay
between cellular and plasmatic elements of the hemostatic system and components of the innate
immune response to the infecting pathogen. The phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization in
apoptotic platelets, as a substrate, might be an initiation for multiple coagulation factors5. So a
combination of several activation events initiated by exposure of the endothelium, platelets, and
leukocytes to pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns might be responsible for the
uncontrolled activation of the coagulation system in severely ill COVID-19 patients6,7.
To date most clinical reports on COVID-19-associated coagulopathy focused on an
increased activation of the plasmatic coagulation system1-3,7. Elevated D-Dimer levels were
consistently reported, whereas their gradual increase during disease course is particularly
associated with disease worsening8. Other coagulation abnormalities such as prothrombin time
(PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) prolongation, together with severe
thrombocytopenia have been found to be associated with life-threatening DIC9. Platelets have been
recently recognized as a mediator of inflammation and sensor of infectious agents through the
interaction of surface receptors and pathogens or immune system derivatives10. Viral infections elicit
the systemic inflammatory response that affects platelets, which become activated upon antigen
specific recognition and interaction with white blood cells11. While platelet activation plays a critical

role in the procoagulatory effect of viral infections12,13, platelets derived from patients with HIV as
well as secondary dengue virus infection have been shown to have increased upregulation of the
intrinsic pathway of apoptosis14-16. In addition, it is well known that the survival and lifespan of
platelets is finely regulated by the intrinsic or mitochondrial apoptosis pathway17,18.
We hypothesized that coagulation disturbances observed in ICU COVID-19 patients are
accompanied by platelet apoptosis with subsequent alterations of the coagulation system. In
platelets, apoptosis is mediated by the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP)
which is regulated by the members of the Bcl2 protein family that either promote (pro-apoptotic
proteins: Bak, Bax and Bim) or inhibit (anti-apoptotic proteins: Bcl-xL and Bcl-w) the apoptosis19.
The mitochondrial inner membrane potential (ΔΨm) collapse is followed by the efflux of cytochrome
c into the cytoplasm which forms a multi-protein complex called apoptosome. The latter triggers the
activation of the caspase 9 and the following downstream caspase cascade including caspase 3
and 7. Finally, the phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization on the extracellular membrane
represents one of the late stage of the apoptosis pathway20. In this study, we found evidence that
platelets from severe ICU COVID-19 patients have an upregulation of apoptotic markers. Most
importantly, sera and IgG-fractions isolated from COVID-19 patients were able to induce apoptosis
in platelets from healthy donors. Furthermore, our data indicate that platelet apoptosis might be
associated with thromboembolic complications and increased mortality in severe COVID-19.

Methods
Study cohort and evaluation of the clinical data
During the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Tuebingen (between March the1st and April the 30th 2020), 27
ICU COVID-19 and non-ICU patients were referred to our laboratory for extended investigations of
the coagulations system. Blood samples from healthy donors (n=18) and septic ICU non-COVID-19
patients (n=5) were collected to serve as controls.
Electronic medical records were used to collect demographical data, clinical treatments and
outcome. To estimate the status of critical illness, the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA)

score system was employed as previously described21. Data were independently reviewed by two
physicians (K.A. and S.H.). In case of disagreements, a third physician was consulted (M.M.). For
more details see supplemental material

Determination of apoptosis in patients’ platelets
Platelet isolation
Platelets were isolated from citrated blood and tested within 3 hours (h*). In brief, after one
centrifugation step (120g, 20 minutes [min*] at room temperature [RT], without brake), platelet rich
plasma (PRP) was gently separated and used for further analysis.
Assessment of the inner-mitochondrial-transmembrane potential (ΔΨm)
To detect changes in the ΔΨm, the tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) assay kit (Abcam,
Cambridge, United Kingdom) was used as previously described, with minor modification22,23. In
brief, PRP was stained with 10 µM TMRE (30 min* at RT) and directly measured by flow cytometry
(FC) (Navios, Beckman-Coulter, USA). The complete depolarization of platelet mitochondrial
potential was induced using the uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation carbonyl
cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone (FCCP) (10 µM, 1 h* at 37°C)16. Changes in the ΔΨm
were determined as ratio of the mean of fluorescence intensity (MFI) signal TMRE from healthy
donors’ PRP compared to the MFI signal of platelets from COVID-19 and ICU non-COVID-19
patients.
Quantification of cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) concentration
Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was determine using Fluo-3/AM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) as
previously described24, with minor modifications. In brief, PRP were incubated with Fluo3/AM (3 µM)
in TRIS (trisaminomethane) buffer (10 mM TRIS, 0.9% NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4) for 30 min* at
37°C. After washing once with TRIS buffer, cells were resuspended in TRIS containing 1 mM CaCl2.
Ca2+-dependent fluorescence intensity of samples was measured with an excitation wavelength of
488 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm by FC. PRP treated with ionomycin (2 μM, 30 min*

at 37°C, [Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA]) served as positive control. Test results were normalized to
the mean MFI of healthy donors tested in parallel.
Detection of phosphatidylserine externalization
PRP was stained with Annexin V-FITC (Immunotools, Friesoyhte Germany) and CD41-PE-Cy5
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA) in TRIS buffer (30 min* at RT) and directly analyzed by FC, as
previously described25. Cells incubated with 60 µM ionomycin (30 min* at RT) served as positive
control. Test results were determined as fold increase of the percentage of PS positive events in
PRP from COVID-19 or ICU non-COVID-19 patients compared to platelets from healthy donors
tested in parallel.

Assessment of antibody-mediated apoptosis
Sera and IgG incubation with washed platelets
To exclude unspecific effects like the activation of platelets via complement or non-specific immune
complexes, all sera were heat-inactivated (56°C for 30 min*), followed by a sharp centrifugation step
at 5,000g. The supernatant was collected.
All experiments involving patients’ sera were performed after incubation of 5 µL serum with 25 µL
washed platelets (7.5x106, see supplemental material for more information on the preparation of
washed platelets) for 1.5 h* under rotating conditions at RT. Afterwards, samples were washed once
(7 min*, 650g, RT, without brake) and gently resuspended in 75 µL of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS, Biochrom, Berlin, Germany).
When indicated, immunoglobulin G (IgG) fractions were isolated from serum (for more details see
supplemental material).
Detection of ΔΨm changes induced by patients’ sera
Washed platelets were stained with 10 µM TMRE (30 min* at RT) and directly measured by FC. As
positive control, cells were preincubated with FCCP (10 µM for 30 min* at 37°C). Serum-mediated
apoptosis was quantified as ratio of ΔΨm depolarization comparing the MFI of washed platelets

incubated with serum from healthy donors with sera from (non-ICU and ICU) COVID-19 or ICU nonCOVID-19 patients. Test results were normalized to the mean MFI of patients’ sera compared to
sera from healthy donors tested in parallel.
Quantification of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration after patients’ sera incubation
Upon incubation with patients’ sera washed platelets were incubated with Fluo3/AM (3 µM) in TRIS
buffer (30 min* at 37°C). After washing once with TRIS buffer, cells were resuspended in TRIS
supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2. Subsequently, Ca2+-dependent fluorescence intensity of samples
was measured by FC. Ionomycin (5 µM, 15 min* at RT) was used as positive control. Test results
were normalized to the mean MFI of patients’ sera compared to sera from healthy donors tested in
parallel.
Assessment of phosphatidylserine externalization induced by patients’ sera
Washed platelet (1x106) were resuspended into Hank´s balanced salt solution (137 mM NaCl, 1.25
mM CaCl2, 5.5 mM glucose [Carl-Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany]), stained with Annexin V-FITC
(Immunotools, Friesoythe Germany) and directly analyzed by FC. As positive control washed
platelets were incubated with ionomycin (5µM, 15 min* at RT). Test results were determined as fold
increase of the percentage of PS positive events in platelets upon incubation with patients’ sera
compared to cells incubated with healthy donors tested in parallel.

Western blot analysis
Protein levels of cleaved-caspase 9 were determined by western blot. In brief, washed platelet were
centrifuged (5 min*, 700g at 4°C) and the pellet was resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Paisley, UK). The proteins were separated by electrophoresis using 12%
SDS-PAGE. See the supplemental material for further details.

Institutional Review Board of the University of Tuebingen.

Statistical analyses
The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism, Version 7.0 (GraphPad, La Jolla,
USA). Because potential daily variations in FC measurements might result in bias in data analysis,
test results were normalized to two healthy donors tested in parallel at the same time point (raw
data are available in the supplemental data). For further information see the supplemental material.

Results
Study cohort
Blood samples were collected from 27 consecutive COVID-19 patients who were admitted to our
hospital with severe acute respiratory distress symptoms (ARDS) requiring intensive care (ICU,
n=23) and hospitalized patients (non-ICU n=4) without ARDS. Two blood samples were excluded
due to insufficient material. In total, 21 ICU COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the study, of whom
18/21 (86%) patients were male, Table 1. The mean age was 60 years (range: 29-88 years, Table
1). 15/21 (71%) patients had known risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection as described
previously26, including hypertension in 14/21 (67%), obesity in 4/21 (19%), coronary artery disease
4/21 (19%) and diabetes mellitus 5/21 (24%). 4 patients had only minor symptoms of COVID-19 and
did not require admission to the ICU. Samples from patients on ICU with sepsis were used as a
control group. Detailed information on the clinical manifestations of the 25 (non-ICU, n=4 and ICU,
n=21) COVID-19 patients and the 5 ICU non-COVID-19 patients (ICU control) are available in the
supplemental data (Supplemental Table 1).
On the ICU, all patients received controlled respiratory support and six of them had
additionally venous-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO). Anticoagulation with

heparin was administrated at prophylactic doses (400 IE/h) in 12/21 (57%) patients or at therapeutic
doses (2 to 3 fold aPTT) in 9/21 (43%) patients, depending on patient’s risk factors for thrombosis.
8/21 (38%) patients had additional antiplatelet therapy with aspirin. At the day of material
submission, patients had a median SOFA score of 8 (range: 2-17), median platelet counts of
151x109/L (range: 35-500x109/L), median aPTT 39 seconds (s*) (range: 20-98 s*), median
international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.0 (range: 0.9-1.5), median D-Dimer 4 µg/mL (range: 1-42
µg/mL) and median fibrinogen 551 mg/dL (range: 273-961 mg/dL), Supplemental Table 1.
During the 30-day follow-up, 7/21 (33%) deceased, 13/21 (62%) patients developed
thrombocytopenia (range platelet count: 9-149x109/L) and 12/21 (57%) patients had at least one
thromboembolic complication including kidney, spleen and liver infarction (n=7), catheter associated
thrombosis (n=2), clotting of extracorporeal circulation system (n=1), pulmonary embolism (n=1),
cerebral infarction (n=1) and myocardial infarction (n=1), Supplemental Table 1.

Severe COVID-19 infection is associated with platelet apoptosis
To evaluate the mitochondrial function in platelets from COVID-19 patients, the mitochondrial ΔΨm,
was assessed. As shown in Figure 1A, significantly increased ΔΨm depolarization was found in
platelets isolated from ICU COVID-19 patients compared to healthy donors (1.385 ±0.071 vs. 0,997
±0,050, p=0.0001) as well as to non-ICU COVID-19 patients (1.385 ±0.071 vs. 0.851 ±0.096,
p=0.0046, Figure 1A; Supplemental figure 1A). Of note, a comparable ΔΨm depolarization was
observed between ICU COVID-19 and ICU non-COVID-19 patients (1.385 ±0.071 vs.1.369 ±0.112,
p=0.921, Figure 1A; Supplemental figure 1A).
Next, we determined the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in platelets from COVID-19 patients
using the intracellular dye Fluo-3. Platelets from ICU COVID-19 patients showed a significant
increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration compared to healthy donors (2.729 ±0.314 vs. 1.007
±0.043, p<0.0001), to non-ICU COVID-19 patients (2.729 ±0.314 vs. 1.060 ±0.069, p<0.0001, as
well as to ICU non-COVID-19 patients (2.729 ±0.314 vs. 1.432 ±0.190, p= 0.0018, Figure 1B;
Supplemental Figure 1B) was found.

To further confirm the potential involvement of platelet apoptosis in ICU COVID-19 patients,
we evaluated surface PS externalization on platelets. The latter, was significantly higher on platelets
from ICU COVID-19 patients compared to healthy volunteers (2.051 ±0.476 vs. 0.865 ±0.088,
p=0.0290) as well as to non-ICU COVID-19 patients (2.051 ±0.476 vs. 0.993 ±0.064, p=0.0392,
Figure 1C; Supplemental Figure 1C) as well as ICU non-COVID-19 patients (2.051 ±0.476 vs. 0.869
±0.263, p=0.0404, Figure 1C; Supplemental Figure 1C). Moreover, western blot analyses showed
increased level of cleaved-caspase 9 levels in platelets from ICU COVID-19 patients compared to
healthy donors (7.94 ±2.61 vs. 1.00 ±0.00, p=0.0260; Figure 1D-E). In association with
mitochondrial dysfunction and increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, these data indicate an
activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in platelets during COVID-19 infection. Overall, as
shown in Figure 1F, platelets from 16/21 (76%) patients showed ΔΨm depolarization, 19/21 (90%)
had increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and 12/21 (57%) patients reveled enhanced PS
externalization Figure 1F.

Association of apoptosis markers with laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes
To draw conclusion on potential clinical impact of our findings, we limited the analysis of the
correlations apoptosis markers to platelet count, SOFA score and D-Dimer levels at the days of
blood sampling. We found that platelet count is negatively correlated with PS externalization (r= 0.6177, p=0.0028, Figure 2A) and with cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (r= -0.5666; p=0.0299, Figure
2B). Strong positive correlation was also observed for PS externalization with D-Dimer (r=0.4473;
p=0.0420; Figure 2C) as well as with the SOFA score (r=0.5635; p=0.0078, Figure 2D).
Next, we analyzed the markers of apoptosis in relation to the incidence of thromboembolic
complications and mortality during the 30-day follow-up. We found that ICU COVID-19 patients with
thromboembolic complications had significantly higher levels of PS externalization compared to
those without thrombosis (2.85 ±0.75 vs. 0.99 ±0.20, p=0.0340, Figure 2E). In addition, cytosolic
Ca2+ concentration was significantly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors (4.07 ±0.39 vs.
2.05 ±0.30, p=0.0012, Figure 2F).

Sera from ICU COVID-19 patients cause IgG-mediated platelet apoptosis via crosslinking Fc gamma receptor IIA
To explore the mechanism of platelet apoptosis in COVID-19, patients’ sera were incubated with
washed platelets from healthy donors. As shown in Figure 3A, COVID-19 sera induced a
significantly higher ΔΨm depolarization compared to sera from healthy donors (1.52 ±0.117 vs.
0.958 ±0.082 , p=0.0086) as well as to sera from ICU non-COVID-19 patients (1.52 ±0.117 vs. 1.099
±0.057, p=0.0036, Figure 3A; Supplemental Figure 2A). Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was also
significantly increased compared to healthy volunteers (1.372 ±0.074 vs. 0.984 ±0.055, p=0.0036,
Figure 3B; Supplemental Figure 2B) and to ICU non-COVID-19 patients (1.372 ±0.074 vs. 1.086
±0.066, p=0.0113, Figure 3B; Supplemental Figure 2B). Similarly, enhanced PS externalization was
found in platelet upon incubation with ICU COVID-19 sera compared to healthy donors (1.624 ±
0.126 vs. 0.969 ±0.100, p=0.0051, Figure 3C; Supplemental Figure 2C) as well as to ICU nonCOVID-19 sera (1.624 ± 0.126 vs. 0.953 ±0.169, p=0.0214, Figure 3C; Supplemental Figure 2C). In
addition, significantly higher levels of cleaved-caspase 9 were found after incubation with sera from
COVID-19 compared to healthy control (3.40 ±0.65 vs. 1.00 ±0.00, p=0.0030; Figure 3D-E). In the
whole cohort, sera from 13/21 (62%) patients induced enhanced ΔΨm depolarization, 8/19 (42%)
patients increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and 13/21 (62%) patient’s sera mediated increased
PS externalization on platelets of healthy donors (Figure 3F).
In order to further dissect the pathways of the antibody-mediated platelet apoptosis, IgGfractions were isolated from apoptosis-inducing sera tested in the absence or presence of an
FcγRIIA-blocking mAb (IV.3). Interestingly, IgG fractions from COVID-19 sera induced significant
upregulation in all three apoptosis markers, ΔΨm depolarization (1.54 ±0.14 vs. 1.00 ±0.00,
p=0.0051, Figure 4A), cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (1.36 ±0.05 vs. 1.00 ±0.00, p<0.0001, Figure 4B)
and PS externalization (1.70 ±0.27 vs. 1.00 ±0.00, p=0.0330, Figure 4C) compared to healthy
donors. In contrast, a significant reduction of platelet apoptosis was observed after blocking platelet
FcγRIIA: ΔΨm depolarization (2.23 ±0.25 vs. 1.22 ±0.12, p=0.0216, Figure 4D), cytosolic Ca2+

Discussion
COVID-19-infected individuals have a heightened risk for developing thromboembolic complications
and a link has been suggested between low platelet count and severity of disease and mortality27-29.
Here, we show that severe COVID-19 is associated with antibody-mediated upregulation of platelet
apoptosis. In addition, we found a correlation between platelet apoptosis markers and SOFA score,
plasma levels of D-Dimer as well as the incidence of thromboembolic complications in severe
COVID-19 patients. These data indicate that platelet apoptosis may contribute to sustained
inflammation and increased thromboembolic risk in COVID-19 patients and could potentially present
a potential therapeutic target.
A subpopulation with severe COVID-19 in our study had an increase in platelet apoptosis markers.
The exact mechanism of COVID-19 induced platelet apoptosis has not been studied so far. Our
data show depolarization of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential in a subgroup and
enhanced cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in most of the patients with severe (ICU) COVID-19.
Together with the increased PS externalization and cleavage of caspase 9, these results suggest
that platelet apoptosis in severe COVID-19 is activated via the intrinsic pathway. Apoptosis is also
described for septic patients30. But apoptosis seem to be different from apoptosis in septic patients.
Notably, we could find increased ΔΨm depolarization in platelets of septic patients, but we could not
show any increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration or in PS externalization patient platelets in the
ICU control group. After incubation of serum of healthy donors we see no effect of septic patients.
As a difference to platelet apoptosis in septic patients, there might be a serum factor for apoptosis in
COVID-19 patients.
While, no enhanced apoptosis was observed in patients, platelets or in healthy platelets after
incubation of sera isolated from ICU non-COVID-19 control patients suggesting that the activation of
the apoptotic pathway may be a specific effect induced by the COVID-19 infection through a serum

component. But it remain unclear whether apoptosis alone is sufficient to support thromboembolic
status in these patients or if it is linked to platelet activation as well, as increased cytosolic Ca2+ is
also a finding in increased activated platelets. In apoptotic platelets lifetime is shortened and platelet
function is also reduced. In our cohort severe thrombocytopenia was not common among COVID-19
patients, which was also described for the SARS-CoV-1 in 200831. In fact, SARS-CoV-1, which
caused the epidemic outbreak in 2003, has also been previously shown to induce apoptosis in Vero
cells in a virus replication-dependent manner32, despite missing thrombocytopenia. Downregulation
of Bcl-2, the activation of effector caspase 3, as well as the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein
Bax were detected, suggesting the involvement of the caspase family and the activation of the
mitochondrial signaling pathway. In fact, our data showed also that platelets from severe COVID-19
patients have higher levels of cleaved-caspase 9.
Prolonged exposure to higher concentrations of platelet agonists has been shown to induce
the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequent platelet apoptosis33. Enhanced
platelet activation leading to platelet deposition in damaged pulmonary blood vessels has been
demonstrated recently for COVID-1934. To exclude potential contribution of platelet hyperactive
status in our cohort, we assessed the impact of patients’ sera on platelet apoptosis. Recent data
showed that autoantibodies from patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) are able to
induce platelet apoptosis35. The incubation of sera as well as from IgG fractions from severe
COVID-19 patients with platelets from healthy donors induced significant changes in apoptosis
markers including ΔΨm depolarization, increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, caspase 9 cleavage,
and finally PS externalization. More importantly, the antibody-mediated platelet apoptosis was
inhibited by blocking the FcγRIIA receptors using a specifc mAb. It remains unclear, weather it is a
direct IgG-virus complex interaction like previously described for the influenza virus H1N1 infection36
and dengue fever or an indirect effect after binding to platelet non-specific targets.
Nevertheless, our data indicate that severe COVID-19 is associated with antibody-mediated
activation of the intrinsic pathway via crosslinking FcγRIIA receptors by IgG antibodies against tobe-identified target antigen(s). These findings might offer new therapeutic options like blockade of

the FcγRIIA receptor sginaling by tyrosinkinase inhibitors, which have suggested to have a potential
use to prevent platelet activation in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)37.
The clinical relevance of platelet apoptosis is supported by the significant negative
correlation between PS levels on platelet surface with platelet count, the positive correlation with DDimer plasma levels, and most importantly with the SOFA score. Meanwhile, it is well established
that COVID-19 is associated with increased risk for thromboembolic complications. During the 30day follow-up, 57% of our patients had thromboembolic complications. Platelet from ICU COVID-19
patients with thromboembolic events showed significantly increased externalization of the apoptosis
marker PS compared to those with no thrombosis. This finding suggests a link between
thromboembolism and platelet apoptosis in COVID-19 as has been suggested for acute pulmonary
embolism38.
Our study is subjected to limitations. First, as an observational study, we cannot conclude
that the reported associations between platelet markers and laboratory parameters as well as
clinical outcomes are causal or specific for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Second, we cannot exclude
the possibility of remaining residual confounding or unmeasured potential confounders. Third, the
low number of patients does not enable a final and robust multivariate statistical analysis. In
addition, we observed a small difference in age between ICU COVID-19 patients and controls.
However, age of the patient is not classically associated, and little is known on the impact of age on
platelet apoptosis.
It should also be emphasized that it is not clear whether the platelet apoptosis described
here are drivers of disease severity or a mere consequence of hypercoagulation in severe (ICU)
COVID-19 patients. Indeed, the definitive pathophysiology of COVID-19 and answering questions of
causality will likely await the development of model systems for the disease. We hope though that
our findings present another piece of the puzzle and will motivate further research into the role of
platelet apoptosis in COVID-19 associated thromboembolic complications.
Data presented in this study may build a basis for future studies to dissect platelet-mediated
pathological mechanisms involved in the progression of COVID-19 and a larger and multi-center
study is warranted to investigate the predictive power of platelet apoptosis markers in well12

phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. Furthermore, given the dichotomy we found here between PS
externalization and thromboembolic complications in our cohort, it is intriguing, especially in the
absence of antiviral and immunologic solutions to the current pandemic, to explore the benefit of
anti-apoptotic therapies. In particular, different caspase inhibitors that are currently tested in clinical
trials (Emricasan, identification number: NCT03205345 and IDN-6556, identification number:
NCT00080236) may represent a part of personalized strategy for some individuals affected by
COVID-19 who are at high risk for progression to cardiovascular complications.
In summary, we introduce the first description of platelet apoptosis in severe (ICU) COVID19 patients, suggesting a strong link between platelet apoptosis and thrombosis. These data may
indicate platelet apoptosis as a potential target of COVID-19 treatment as has been suggested for
ARDS39 and other platelet disorders35,40.
