Key Points
Abstract
Importance: To predict the diagnosed COVID-19 patients and the trend of the
epidemic in China. It may give the public some scientific information to ease the fear
of the epidemic.
Objective: In December 2019, pneumonia infected with the novel coronavirus burst
in Wuhan, China. We aimed to use a mathematical model to predict number of
diagnosed patients in future to ease anxiety on the emergent situation.
Design: According to all diagnosis number from WHO website and combining with
the transmission mode of infectious diseases, the mathematical model was fitted to
predict future trend of outbreak.
Setting: Our model was based on the epidemic situation in China, which could
provide referential significance for disease prediction in other countries, and provide
clues for prevention and intervention of relevant health authorities.
Participants: In this retrospective, all diagnosis number from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020
reported from China was included and downloaded from WHO website.
Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): We develop a simple but accurate formula to
!!

predict the next day diagnosis number:!

!"#

!

= (!!"# )" Ôºåwhere Ni is the total diagnosed
!"$

patient till the ith day, and ùõº was estimated as 0.904 at Feb 10.
Results: Based on this model, it is predicted that the rate of disease infection will
decrease exponentially. The total number of infected people is limited; thus, the
disease will have limited impact. However, new diagnosis will last to March.
Conclusions and Relevance: Through the establishment of our model, we can better
predict the trend of the epidemic in China.

Introduction
In December of 2019, the increasing number of patients with pneumonia of unknown
cause emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, Central China. Most of the
early patients had directly or indirectly related to wild animal source in the seafood
and wet animal wholesale market through epidemiological survey1-5. Then laboratory
tests found that the infection was caused by a novel coronavirus (now named as
COVID-19 6-7).
The spread of COVID-19 is expeditious. According to WHO statistics, the total
number of diagnosed people in China was 309 in Jan 218, but rapidly grew to 4537 in
Jan 279. Considering a simple constant exponential growth rate model10-11, the
diagnosis number will be unimaginable soon. This triggered a major concern and
motivated this study12-14. A mathematical model is required to predict the spread trend
and emergent situation.
Over the last few decades, mathematical models of disease transmission have been
useful to gain insights into the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and the
potential role of intervention strategies15. Epidemic transmission models focused on
the spread of an infectious disease through a population. But this spread can be
modeled in two fundamental ways: by looking at the entire population as a single
group or set of linked subgroups (population-based) or by considering everyone that
makes up the population and how interactions between unique individuals facilitate
disease spread (individual-based). Common models of infectious disease included
meta-population models, individual-based network models, and simple SIR-type
models that incorporate the effects of reactive behavior changes or inhomogeneous
mixing16.
Considering the limited number of data points and the complexity of the real
situation, a simple but robust model is expected to work better than sophisticated
epidemiology models. In this paper, we propose a robust model for next day diagnosis
number predict. This model had excellent performance on prediction of infected
patients in past few days. The prediction is expected to provide practical significance
on social and economic application.

manifests a random fluctuation around a constant center. It is reasonable to assume
that ùõº is a constant. The estimation of ùõº currently (Feb 10) is 0.904. A future

Previous numbers of diagnoses in China are used to predict the number for the next
day. The prediction is started from Jan 29 as several data points are needed to build

New Diagnosis Number Prediction
We predict the new diagnosis number in China according to our model as Fig.2. The
model predicts that new diagnosis will last to March.

Fig. 2|Observed (Blue) and Predicted (Orange) number of daily new diagnosis.
Conclusion
Our model indicates that the COVID-19 disease infection rate decreases exponentially.
This model converges to a maximum number as time increases, indicating a limited
impact of COVID-19. The model also predict that the new diagnosis number will last
to March, indicating that the COVID-19 disease will be well controlled.

Discussion
We only analyzed the total number of diagnoses in China. The province scale data is
available but is not as complete as total number. Here, we did not show these details
analyses.
Our model is attractive as it not only predicts data accurately but also is minimal.

The minimal number of parameters and robust statistics make our model robust in the
real-world scenario. We develop a formula to predict the next day diagnosis number:
!!

!

!!"#

= (!!"# )" Ôºåand estimate that ùõº is 0.904(ùõº <1) which shows that the diagnosis
!"$

number of COVID-19 patients will decrease. It is very effective in controlling the
spread of infectious diseases that the Chinese health authorities have taken
appropriate health care actions. If the outbreak is no longer controlled, the value of ùõº
will be around 1 indicating that the outbreak will wreak havoc.
We obtain this elegant formula with both curve plot visualization and
mathematical intuition. We plot ln (Ni/Ni-1) against time (Fig.3). First few
observations showed a linear decay of spread rate. However, later data points realized
us at Feb 4 that it is an exponential decay. Later data points further confirm our
model.

Methods
Data Download
Daily diagnosis number of China is download from WHO situation reports
(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports).
The data starts from Jan 21 and currently it ends at Feb 10.
Model
The following model is proposed based on our observations:
!!
!!"#

!

= (!!"# )" Ôºå
!"$

where Ni is the number of diagnosed patients in China according to WHO at the ith
day, ùõº is a parameter modeling the decay of diagnosis growth rate.
A simple estimation of ùõº at the ith day would be
ùëÅ
ln (ùëÅ # )
#$%
ùõº&# =
ùëÅ#$%
ln (ùëÅ )
#$&
As we have multiple days of observations, historical ùõº&# with the median statistic,
which is well known for its robustness, can be aggregated.
ùõº& = ùëöùëíùëëùëñùëéùëõ(ùõº&# )
