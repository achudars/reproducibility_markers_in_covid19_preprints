What is already known on this topic
—The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) imposes substantial burdens on
individuals, communities, health–care facilities, markets, governments, etc. globally.
—There is no specific treatment approved for COVID–19 or vaccine to prevent infection with the
novel coronavirus.
—During the urgent pandemic, media headlines the utility of drugs without solid evidence but
buries the side–effects of these drugs.
What this study adds
—In this randomized clinical trial of patients mainly with persistent mild to moderate COVID–19,
exposure to hydroxychloroquine led to a similar probability of virus elimination comparing to the
current standard–of–care.
—Adverse events, mostly gastrointestinal related, were significantly increased in patients who
received hydroxychloroquine.
—Overall, the results from our trial do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with
persistent mild to moderate COVID–19.

Abstract
Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plus standard–of–care
(SOC) compared with SOC alone in adult patients with COVID–19.
Design Multicenter, open–label, randomized controlled trial.
Setting 16 government–designated COVID–19 treatment centers in China through 11 to 29 in
February 2020.
Participants 150 patients hospitalized with laboratory confirmed COVID–19 were included in the
intention to treat analysis. 75 patients were assigned to HCQ plus SOC and 75 to SOC alone.
Interventions HCQ was administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days
followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration: 2
or 3 weeks for mild/moderate or severe patients, respectively).
Main outcome measures The primary outcome was whether participants had a negative conversion
of SARS–CoV–2 by 28 days, and was analyzed according to the intention–to–treat principle.
Adverse events were analyzed in the safety population in which HCQ recipients were participants
who actually received at least one dose of HCQ and HCQ non–recipients were those actually
managed with SOC alone.
Results Among 150 patients, 148 were with mild to moderate disease and 2 were with severe
disease. The mean days (± standard deviation, min to max) from symptoms onset to randomization
was 16.6 (±10.5 days, 3 to 41 days). The negative conversion probability by 28 days in SOC plus
HCQ group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the SOC
group 81.3% (95%CI 71.2% to 89.6%). Between–group difference was 4.1% (95%CI –10.3% to
18.5%). In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7 (8.8%) HCQ non–recipients
(N=80) and in 21 (30%) HCQ recipients (N=70). The most common adverse event in the HCQ

recipients was diarrhea, reported in 7 (10%) patients. Two HCQ recipients reported serious adverse
events.
Conclusions The administration of HCQ did not result in a significantly higher negative conversion
probability than SOC alone in patients mainly hospitalized with persistent mild to moderate
COVID–19. Adverse events were higher in HCQ recipients than in HCQ non–recipients.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV–2) has swept into 185 countries/regions within five months. As of 22
April, more than 2.5 million infections and 178 thousand deaths have been reported.1
Several agents or drugs including, remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir–ritonavir (used in
combination) and chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), have been highlighted based on
the promising in–vitro results and therapeutic experiences from another two coronavirus diseases
including the severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome.2
However, none of these promising results has yet been translated into clinical benefits of patients
with COVID–19, including lopinavir–ritonavir, reported from the most recently failed trial.3
CQ and its hydroxy–analog HCQ, best known as antimalarial drugs, are glaring on the list of
COVID–19 therapy, due to potent antiviral activity against SARS–CoV–2 from in–vitro studies,4,5
and promising results from news reports of some ongoing trials.6 Despite their unclear benefits, CQ
and HCQ are both recommended for off–label use in the treatment of COVID–19 by the Chinese
National guideline7 and recently authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
emergency use.8 HCQ was also recently recommended by the American president Donald Trump.
Such a presidential endorsement stimulates an avalanche of demand for HCQ, which buried the
dark–side of this drug. Deaths have been reported in Nigeria among people self–treating for
apparent COVID–19 with CQ overdoses.9 Retinopathy, gastrointestinal, and cardiac side effects are
well documented with the use of CQ or HCQ in the treatment of malarial and rheumatic diseases.10
HCQ is preferred in clinical applications due to its lower toxicity, particularly retinal toxicity,10 and
three times the potency against SARS–CoV–2 infection comparing to CQ in the recent in–vitro
study.5 Currently, there is no convincing evidence from well–designed clinical trials to support the

use of CQ/HCQ with good efficacy and safety for the treatment of COVID–19. Rapidly conduction
of such trials with high–quality is challenging in the face of a dangerous coronavirus outbreak, in
which, healthcare workers are under overwhelming work and highest risk of exposure to developing
COVID–19.11
Having encountered numerous challenges, we conducted a multicenter, open–label, randomized,
controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of HCQ sulfate in adult patients with COVID–19. A
clearer verdict will come from such a trial for the use of HCQ in patients with COVID–19.

METHODS
Trial oversight
The study was designed and initiated by the principal investigators after the protocol was approved
by the institutional review board in Ruijin Hospital on February 6, 2020. The protocol and approval
documents are available online with the full text of this article. Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients. Hospitals with the capability of providing the current standard–of–care
(SOC) for COVID–19 were invited to participate in the study by the principal investigators.
Minimum requirements for the SOC included the provision of intravenous fluids, supplemental
oxygen, regular laboratory testing, and SARS–CoV–2 test, hemodynamic monitoring, and intensive
care, and the ability to deliver concomitant medications. The trial was conducted urgently during
the outbreak of COVID–19 in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice
guidelines, and local regulatory requirements. The Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co.,Ltd
donated the investigated drug, HCQ, but was not involved in the study design, accrual, analyses of
data, or preparation of the manuscript. The principal investigators designed the study and made the
decision to submit the manuscript for publication. All authors vouch for the trial protocol and
fidelity of the study to the protocol, and veracity of the data and results. A contract research
organization, R&G PharmaStudies Co., Ltd., was hired to assist in the study design and data
collection, cleaning and statistical analyses. Data were recorded by clinical research coordinators
followed by queries from clinical research associates. Confirmed data were then entered into the
Web–based OpenClinica database for statistical analyses performed by the study statistician and
reviewed by the senior statistician in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Data
collection forms and statistical analysis plans are available online with the full text of this article.

An independent data and safety monitoring committee (IDMC) periodically reviewed the progress
and oversight of the study. The interim analysis was performed on March 14 and the results were
presented to the IDMC. The rapid decline in eligible new cases of COVID–19 at that time in China
precluded the recruitment of our targeted number of cases. After a two–round extensive review of
the efficacy and safety data generated from the interim analysis, the IDMC endorsed an early
termination of the trial. Members from the committee all agreed that the data from the trial is
important for clinicians, the public, and the government to avoid inappropriate use of HCQ in the
clinical management of COVID–19, particularly in overwhelming areas. The report of the trial
could potentially be an important resource to facilitate a better design of future trials. The results of
this clinical trial are reported in accordance with CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting
Trials) guidelines.
Trial design, Randomization, and procedures
This study was a multicenter, randomized, parallel, open–label, trial of HCQ in hospitalized patients
with COVID–19. Patients were enrolled by the site investigators in 16 government–designated
COVID–19 treatment centers from three provinces in China (Hubei, Henan and Anhui province).
No placebo was used and drugs were not masked. Stratified random sampling was applied to
stratify all eligible patients according to the disease severity (mild to moderate or severe) followed
by random assignment (in a 1:1 ratio) in each stratum to ensure a balanced distribution of disease
severity between treatment (HCQ plus SOC) and control (SOC only) groups. Randomization rules
were designed by Leshan Liu together with principal investigators and implemented by an
independent statistician who was not involved in data analysis. Equal numbers of cards with each
group assignment number randomly generated by computer were placed in sequentially numbered
14

envelopes that were opened as the patients were enrolled. All patients were managed with SOC
aligning with the indications from the updating National clinical practice guidelines for COVID–19
in China. Patients in the treatment group were administrated with HCQ within 24 hours after
randomization and were administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days
followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for remaining days (total treatment duration: 2
weeks or 3 weeks for mild/moderate or severe patients, respectively). The dose for HCQ was
adjusted when adverse events were related to HCQ as judged by investigators. Details for dose
adjustment were provided in the study protocol available online. Neither patients, nor investigators,
nor statisticians were masked to treatment assignment. Lab technicians who performed virologic,
chemistry, and other routine measurement were unaware of treatment information.
Patients
Inclusion criteria: 1) age >18 years; 2) with ongoing SARS–CoV–2 infection confirmed in upper or
lower respiratory tract specimens with real–time reverse–transcriptase–polymerase–chain–reaction
(RT–PCR); 3) willingness to participate; 4) consent not to be enrolled by other clinical trials during
the study period. Pneumonia on chest computed tomography was not mandatory for inclusion.
Exclusion criteria: 1) age <18 years; 2) with severe conditions including malignancies,
heart/liver/kidney disease or poorly controlled metabolic diseases; 3) not suitable to be
administrated through the gastrointestinal tract;4) pregnant or lactation; 5) allergy to HCQ; 6)
unable to cooperate with investigators due to cognitive impairments or poor mental status; 7) with
severe liver disease (e.g. Child Pugh grade C, alanine aminotransferase >5 fold of times upper
limit);8) with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or
receiving continuous renal replacement therapy, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis. In the original

protocol, patients with severe COVID–19 were excluded. Considering the anti–inflammatory
property of HCQ might favor disease regression, we decided to include patients with severe
COVID–19. (change approved by the Ethics Committee on February 17, 2020).
Definition for disease severity of COVID–19 was based on the 5th version of Chinese guideline for
the management of COVID–1912: Mild: patients with mild symptoms but no pneumonia
manifestation on imaging; Moderate: patients with fever, cough, sputum production, other
respiratory tract or non–specific symptoms along with pneumonia manifestation on imaging but no
signs of severe pneumonia defined as the presence of SaO2/SPO2 <94% on room air or PaO2/FiO2
ratio ≤300mgHg.
Assessment
Upper and/or lower respiratory tract specimens were obtained from each patient upon screening
(Day –3~1), during treatment and post–treatment follow–up at scheduled visits on days 4, 7, 10, 14,
21 and 28. SARS–CoV–2 was measured by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention or
authorized health institutions or hospitals at each site using assays that have been approved by the
National Medical Products Administration. Measurements were performed based on the
recommendations by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China)
(http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/ 202001/t20200121_211337.html). Methods for total RNA extraction
and amplification through RT–PCR were similar as described elsewhere.13 Instead of quantitative
data (cycle threshold value) reported from RT–PCR assay, we only collected qualitative data
reported from our trial sites. Based on national recommendation, a cycle threshold value less than
37 was defined as a positive test result, and a cycle threshold value of 40 or more was defined as a
negative test. Cycle threshold values between 37 and 40 confirmed by retesting were reported as

complete blood cells count with differential, blood chemistry, coagulation panel, pulse oximetry,
and respiratory symptoms. Administration records of HCQ and adverse events were reviewed daily
to ensure fidelity to the protocol and more importantly, patient safety. Chest computed tomography
was assessed upon screening and at the last visit of the treatment period (Day 14 for mild to
moderate and Day 21 for severe patients). Chest computed tomography examinations can be
exempted by the investigators if the participants can provide qualified examination results within 3
days before the initiation of the study. More details for data collection were provided in the protocol
available online with the full text of this article.
Outcome
The primary outcome for this trial was whether patients had a negative conversion of SARS–CoV–2
by 28 days and whether patients with severe COVID–19 had a clinical improvement by 28 days.
However, since the trial was stopped early and only 2 patients with severe disease were enrolled,
results on clinical improvement are not presented. We focused on the report of the primary outcome
in this paper. Negative conversion of SARS–CoV–2 was defined as two consecutive confirmation
of "Negatives" reported at least 24 hours apart without subsequent report of "Positive"
SARS–CoV–2 by the end of the study. The date of the first "Negative" report was considered as the
date of negative conversion. In the original protocol, the primary endpoint was prespecified as the
“Negative conversion rate by Day10” (approved on February 6, 2020, by the Ethics Committee).
However, with the increasing knowledge of COVID–19 from our clinical practice, we realized that

the duration of SARS–CoV–2 in respiratory samples of many patients was longer than 10 days,
recently highlighted by a detailed virologic study.14 We, therefore, modified our primary outcome to
test whether patients had a negative conversion of SARS–CoV–2 by 28 days (approved on February
17, 2020, by the Ethics Committee). Meanwhile, negative conversion probability at Day4, 7, 10, 14,
or 21 was specified as a secondary outcome as listed in the protocol but they do not appear on the
trial registration list. The listed secondary outcome in the trial registration was adverse events coded
using the latest version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities coding dictionary, recorded
in standard medical terminology and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.
Other pre–specified secondary outcomes not listed in the trial registration but included in the
protocol were the probabilities of 1) alleviation of clinical symptoms; 2) improvement of C–reactive
protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, tumor necrosis factor–α, Interleukin–6, and absolute blood
lymphocyte count; 3) improvement of lung lesions on chest radiology; 4) all–cause death; 5) disease
progression in mild to moderate patients. The time frame for these secondary outcomes were all
from randomization to 28 days. Pre–specified secondary outcomes for severe patients were not
listed here but in the protocol. Due to the early termination of our study, we could not able to justify
the results from these analyses with an underpowered sample size and therefore decided not to
emphasize them in this article to avoid misinterpretation. The only one presented here was the
alleviation of clinical symptoms within 28 day which is an important outcome of interest
prespecified in our protocol. Definition for the alleviation of clinical symptoms was 1) resolving
from fever to an axillary temperature of ≤36.6 and; 2) normalization of SpO2 (>94% on room air)
and; 3) disappearance of respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion, cough, sore throat,

sputum production and shortness of breath.
Statistical analysis
In the original protocol, the target number of enrollments was set to 200 without type–I error
control. In the updated protocol (approved on February 10, 2020, by the Ethics Committee), we
considered type–I and type–II error control and recalculated sample size. The sample size was
calculated based on the alternative hypothesis of a 30% increase in the rate of conversion to
negative of SARS–CoV–2 as defined by virus nucleic acid negativity. With the assumption that
time to conversion follows an exponential distribution, the median time to conversion in HCQ can
be reduced from 10 days to 7 days, therefore, a total of 248 events would provide a power of 80% to
detect Hazards Ratio (HR)=0.7 (SOC vs. HCQ) with a Log–Rank test. Additionally, we assumed a
75–day accrual period and a 7–day follow–up following the last patient enrollment, therefore,
approximately 360 subjects (180 per group) will be randomized in the study. An interim analysis
was planned when around 150 patients were treated for at least 7 days. O’Brien–Fleming
cumulative α–spending function by Lan–DeMets algorithm (Lan–Demets, 1983) was applied to
control family–wise type–I error =0.05.
The overall negative conversion probability was estimated by analyzing time to negative conversion
of SARS–CoV–2 using the Kaplan–Meier method in the intention–to–treat population and
compared with a log–rank test. Patients failed to reach the negative conversion of SARS–CoV–2
(see definition in Outcome section) by the cutoff date of the analysis (14 March 2020) was
considered as right–censored at the last visit date. All these patients remained in hospital and may
reach negative conversion after our last visit date, but the specific timing of the event is unknown.
Similar approaches were applied to the analysis of symptoms alleviation. Between–group rate

difference was used to show treatment effect size and 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated
by an approximate normal distribution and the standard error was estimated by the bootstrap
method (N=1000). The hazard ratio was estimated by the Cox model. HRs greater than 1 indicate
the rate of virus negative conversion or symptoms alleviation is higher in the HCQ plus SOC group
compared to the SOC group. Safety analyses were based on the patients’ actual treatment exposure.
Data analyses were conducted on SAS version 9.4.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they
involved in developing plans for recruitment, design or implementation of the study. No patients
were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There are no plans to disseminate the
results of the research to study participants or the relevant patient community.

RESULTS
Patient
A total of 191 patients admitted with COVID–19 from February 11, 2020, to February 29, 2020,
were assessed for eligibility, of which 41 did not meet eligibility criteria. The remaining 150
patients underwent randomization; Among them, 75 patients were assigned to SOC and 75 patients
to SOC plus HCQ group (Figure 1). The mean age of the patients was 46 years and 82 (55%) were
male. The mean days (± standard deviation, min to max) from symptoms onset to randomization
was 16.6 (±10.5 days, 3 to 41 days) and 90 (60%) patients had concomitant medication before
randomization; among them, 52 (34.7%) received antiviral treatment (Table 1). 148 (99%) patients
had mild to moderate COVID–19 and only 2 (1%) patients

were severe upon screening. Baseline

demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of the patients between the two groups
are shown in Table 1.
By 14 March 2020 (the cutoff date for data analysis), the median duration of follow–up was 21 days
(range, 2 to 33 days) in the SOC group and 20 days (range, 3 to 31 days) in the SOC plus HCQ
group with 9 patients in each group having complete 28-day follow-up. Of the 75 patients assigned
to receive SOC plus HCQ, 6 patients did not receive any dose of HCQ; of them, 3 patients
withdrew consent and 3 patients refuse to be administrated HCQ. The co–intervention including
antiviral, antibiotics, and systemic glucocorticoid therapy between the two groups were similar
(Table 2). One patient with the moderate disease in the HCQ group progressed to severe COVID–19
and no patients died during follow–up.
Primary Outcome
A total of 109 (72.7%) patients (56 in SOC and 53 in SOC plus HCQ) negatively converted well
before 28 days and the remaining 41 (27.8%) patients (19 in SOC and 22 in SOC plus HCQ) were

censored due to the failure of reaching virus negative conversion. The maximum duration for a
patient with positive SARS–CoV–2 was 23 days by the cutoff date of our analysis. Overall, the
negative conversion probability of SARS–CoV–2 among patients who were assigned to receive
SOC plus HCQ was 85.4% (95%CI 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that of the SOC group 81.3%
(95%CI 71.2% to 89.6%) by 28 days. The difference of negative conversion probability between
SOC plus HCQ and SOC alone was 4.1% (95%CI –10.3% to 18.5%). The median time to negative
conversion was also similar in the SOC plus HCQ group (8 days, 95%CI 5 to 10 days) with that in
the SOC group (7 days, 95%CI 5 to 8 days) (Hazard ratio, 0.846; 95%CI, 0.58 to 1.23; p=0.34 by
log–rank test) (Figure 2).
Safety
Six patients assigned to the SOC plus HCQ group but did not receive HCQ treatment were
classified as HCQ non–recipient in the safety population. One patient in the SOC group wrongly
received 14–day of HCQ treatment with an accumulative dose of 11, 600 mg. This patient was
classified as HCQ recipient in the safety population (Figure 1). Safety endpoints were compared
between HCQ recipient and non–recipient (Table 3). In HCQ recipients, the median duration of
HCQ treatment was 14 days (range, 1 to 22). Between randomization and final visit, a total of 21
(30%) patients in the SOC plus HCQ group reported adverse events, higher than those 7 (8.8%)
patients reported in the SOC group (Table 3). No serious adverse events were reported in the SOC
group. Two patients in the HCQ group reported serious adverse events due to disease progression
and upper respiratory infection. The case with upper respiratory infection discharged after finishing
the 14–day treatment of HCQ and developed throat–drying and pharyngalgia requiring
re–admission without evidence of pneumonia on chest computed tomography during the extended
follow–up period.

The most common adverse events in the SOC plus HCQ group were diarrhea reported in 7 (10%)
patients, which was not reported in the SOC group. HCQ was discontinued in one patient due to
blurred vision and was adjusted to give a lower dose in one patient who reported thirst. These two
adverse events were both transient with a period of 1–2 days.
Secondary Outcome
Negative conversion probability by a specific time–point, 4–, 7–, 10–, 14– or 21–day was also
similar between the two groups (Supplementary Table 1). The probability of symptoms alleviation
by 28 days was similar between patients with SOC with (59.9%, 95%CI 45.0% to 75.3%) and
without HCQ (66.6%, 95%CI 39.5% to 90.9%). Between–group difference was –6.6% (95%CI
–41.3% to 28.0%). The median time to alleviation of clinical symptoms was similar in the SOC plus
HCQ group with that in the SOC group (19 days versus 21 days, Hazard ratio, 1.01, 95%CI, 0.59 to
1.74, p=0.97 by log–rank test) (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
Principal findings
The present study (conducted during the outbreak of COVID–19 in China) is the first randomized,
controlled trial evaluating HCQ administration in COVID–19 patients. The findings do not provide
evidence to support an increase of negative conversion probability of SARS–CoV–2 conferred by
the addition of HCQ administration to the current SOC in patients hospitalized mainly with
persistent mild to moderate COVID–19.
Comparison with other studies
Our negative results on the antiviral efficacy of HCQ obtained in this trial are on the contrary to the
encouraging in–vitro results4,5 and the recently reported promising results from a non–randomized
trial with 36 COVID–19 patients.6 It should be noted that participants in our trial had mainly mild
to moderate disease with a median 16–day delay of HCQ treatment from symptoms onset.
Therefore, the negative results of our trial are only applicable to patients with persistently mild to
moderate COVID–19. The COVID–19 has overwhelmed hospital systems during the pandemic,
many of these patients may be treated in the community and may finally end up in hospitalization
because of oxygen needs or even rapid deterioration of the disease. Current data from our trial do
not provide evidence to support the use of HCQ in this particular population, particularly
considering the increased adverse events (discussed below). Our trial could not answer the antiviral
efficacy of HCQ at the earlier stage, e.g., within 48h of illness onset, the golden window for
antiviral treatment in influenza.16 However, it is challenging to conduct such a trial in hospitalized
patients and will be easier in outpatient or community settings. The fact that no restriction of
antiviral treatment in our trial should also be considered when interpreting our results. It would be
more conclusive to see the antiviral effects of HCQ when comparing a “pure” control arm. But in

the early dangerous outbreak of COVID–19 in China, it is not quite ethical to set a restriction on
drugs that could be potentially useful. Nevertheless, the usage of antiviral before and after
randomization between the HCQ and SOC groups was balanced and therefore might affect little on
our primary endpoint. Moreover, it is not likely to have additional antiviral effects by further
escalating the dosage of HCQ used in our trial, because that the dosage of HCQ we choose can
reach the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of HCQ against SARS–CoV–2,16 although we did
not monitor the concentration of HCQ in our study. Another important message from our trial is that
the K–M curve crossed over with time, suggesting a potential for a non–constant hazard ratio of
negative conversion conferred by the exposure to HCQ. Therefore, the HRs presented in our trial
should be interpreted as weighted results over time rather than a definitive constant. We will
investigate it in the future. Further trials might also need to combat this issue when using the Cox
regression method. Taken together, future studies could take advantage of our results to design trials
in more selective populations, at the earliest stage as possible (<48h of illness onset), and using
more sensitive endpoints, such as viral load shedding.
HCQ in our trial was given with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a
maintained dose of 800 mg daily for a total treatment duration of 2 weeks or 3 weeks for
mild/moderate or severe patients, respectively. Serious adverse events occurred in 2 patients and
both were reported from HCQ recipients. The overall frequency of adverse events was significantly
higher in HCQ recipients than non–recipients. Gastrointestinal events, particularly diarrhea, was
most commonly reported, similar to another report using a high dose of HCQ19 Transient blurred
vision was reported in one patient whose symptoms recovered 2 days after discontinuation of HCQ.
Early development of retinal damage with a daily dose of 800 to 1,200mg was detected using
sensitive retinal screening tests.20 Therefore, the retinal damage could be underestimated in our trial.

Events of cardiac arrhythmia, e.g., prolonged QT interval21 was not observed in our trial, possibly
due to the relatively mild/moderate patients investigated or the short–term period of follow–up.
However, with the increasing interest of the combined use of HCQ and azithromycin worldwide,
physicians should be cautious of the increased risk of QT interval prolongation and fatal ventricular
arrhythmia with azithromycin and other antimicrobials.22,23 Drug–drug interaction10 should be taken
into consideration when assessing safety and efficacy endpoints in future HCQ trials. The effects of
HCQ in causing increased levels of digitoxin and metoprolol17 would be particularly relevant in
severe COVID–19 patients and therefore would require close monitoring.
Strengths and limitations of this study
This study provides the first and timely evidence regarding benefit–risk of HCQ derived from a
multi–center randomized controlled trial, which was initiated during the most challenging time of
the COVID–19 outbreak in China.
Under such a situation, our study does have several limitations. First, the design of open–label, as
opposed to double–blind design, introduces biased investigator–determined assessments and
unbalanced dosage adjustment. Urgent production of placebos mimicking HCQ and the
management of a multi–center placebo–controlled trial remains challenging during the pandemic.
Second, the use of sequential envelopes is inferior to the interactive web response management
system for randomization. Third, the conduction of our trial in the setting of hospitalized patients
precludes us from enrolling patients at the early disease stage. In addition, we cannot provide
evidence on the utility of HCQ regarding disease progression or regression because 148 out of 150
(99%) patients in our trial are with mild to moderate disease. Fourth, the results on our main
pre–specified outcomes are not entirely conclusive based on underpowered sample size due to the
lack of enough eligible patients to enroll. The recruitment of eligible patients was unexpectedly

difficult with almost hundreds of clinical trials launched in the same period in response to the urgent
call for the exploration of effective treatment against COVID–19 by the national health authorities.
The rapid decline in eligible new cases owing to the successful containment of COVID–19 in the
mid of March 2020 in China precluded further recruitment to reach our targeted sample size. The
premature termination of our trial also led to increased censoring data on our primary outcome. The
probability of negative conversion between the two groups was therefore re–analyzed using
follow–up data by April 27, 2020 (Supplementary Table 2) and the results were consistent with our
current results. Fifth, it is difficult to ensure the fidelity to the protocol by site investigators under
highly challenging circumstances at the front lines in the COVID–19 treatment centers. Hiring a
contract research organization, as we did in our trial, can greatly support the conduct and oversight
of the trial. Sixth, population quarantine of Wuhan and neighboring cities, nationwide travel
restrictions, and case/contact isolation were also barriers to collect and transfer data and paper files.
Several prespecified secondary endpoints, including the imaging changes on chest CT, were
therefore not finished by the cutoff date of analysis. Finally, the specimens collected in our trial for
virus RNA determination are mostly from the upper respiratory tract rather than bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid, which introduced false–negative results.24 But the prespecified definition for virus
negative conversion was two consecutive negatives with at least 24 hours apart, which can reduce
false negativity.
Conclusion and policy implications
The results of our trial did not show additional benefits of virus elimination by adding HCQ to the
current SOC in patients mainly with persistent mild to moderate COVID–19. Adverse events,
particularly gastrointestinal events, were more frequently reported in patients receiving HCQ, who
were given with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of

800 mg daily for remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 weeks or 3 weeks for mild/moderate or
severe patients, respectively). Overall, these data do not support adding HCQ to the current SOC in
patients with persistent mild to moderate COVID–19 for eliminating the virus. Our trial may
provide initial evidence for the benefit–risk of HCQ and serve as a resource to support further
research.

test in SOC plus HCQ versus SOC in the intention–to–treat population. Shown are data for 75
patients assigned to SOC plus HCQ and 75 assigned to SOC. The overall negative conversion
probability was 85.4% (95% CI 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that of the SOC group 81.3% (95%CI
71.2% to 89.6%) by 28 days (p=0.34). Between-group difference was 4.1% (95%CI –10.3% to
18.5%). The median time to negative conversion was also similar in the SOC plus HCQ group (8
days, 95%CI 5 to 10 days) with that in the SOC group (7 days, 95%CI 5 to 8 days) (Hazard ratio,
0.846; 95%CI, 0.58 to 1.23; p=0.34 by log-rank test). Data from patients who did not have negative
