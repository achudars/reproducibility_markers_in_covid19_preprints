Abstract

31

The outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia

32

challenges the rapid interrogation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome

33

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human and environmental specimens. In this

34

study, we developed an assay using surface enhanced Raman scattering

35

(SERS) coupled with multivariate analysis to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 in an

36

ultra-fast manner without any pretreatment (e.g., RNA extraction). Using

37

silver-nanorod

38

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), we obtained strong SERS signals of

39

ACE2 at 1032, 1051, 1089, 1189, 1447 and 1527 cm-1. The recognition and

40

binding of receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on

41

SERS assay significantly quenched the spectral intensities of most peaks and

42

exhibited a shift from 1189 to 1182 cm-1. On-site tests on 17 water samples

43

with a portable Raman spectrometer proved its accuracy and easy-operation

44

for spot diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to evaluate disinfection performance,

45

explore viral survival in environmental media, assess viral decay in wastewater

46

treatment plant and track SARS-CoV-2 in pipe network. Our findings raise a

47

state-of-the-art spectroscopic tool to screen and interrogate viruses with RBD

48

for human cell entry, proving its feasibility and potential as an ultra-fast

49

diagnostic tool for public health.

1. Introduction

52

The outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia

53

since 2019 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

54

(SARS-CoV-2)

55

the world. Till 19th April 2020, there have been over 2 million confirmed cases

56

and 220,000 deaths globally, and the number is still increasing rapidly. As

57

there is clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 2, 4, 5,

58

6

59

interrogate SARS-CoV-2 in human and environmental specimens draws more

60

attentions for effectively confirming COVID-19 cases and identifying

61

transmission routes. It brings urgent requirement of developing diagnostic

62

tools that can rapidly and specifically recognize SARS-CoV-2 in tracking

63

patients.

64

Many approaches can detect SARS-CoV-2 with high specificity, e.g., real-time

65

reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and

66

serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). RT-qPCR targeted

67

viral specific RNA fragment with specific primers for the open reading frame

68

1ab (CDDC-ORF), nucleocapsid protein (CDDC-N), envelope protein,

69

membrane protein, or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)15,

70

RNA extraction from swab samples is necessary for RT-qPCR and requires

71

time-consuming pretreatment normally taking more than 4 hours19, 20, bringing

72

a barrier for rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Alternatively, ELISA is a

73

commonly used an enzyme immunoassay to detect a receptor using

74

antibodies directed against the antigen 21, targeting the immunological markers,

75

IgM and IgG antibodies, which are reported to increase in the blood of most

76

patients more than a week after infection

77

time-consuming and not feasible for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 in environmental

78

media which do not have immunological markers23, 24, 25. It is of great urgency

79

to develop a rapid, reproducible, cheap and sensitive assay detecting

80

SARS-CoV-2, especially applicable for different specimens.

81

Raman spectroscopy is a vibrational spectroscopy of ability to detect chemical

82

bonds via photon scattering, but the generated signals are extremely weak

1, 2, 3

and it has rapidly spread throughout 202 countries around

, e.g., direct contact, respiratory droplets 3, 7, 8 and stools 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, how to

. However, this method is still

83

comparing to the incident beam. Thus, surface enhanced Raman scattering

84

(SERS) is introduced to overcome such inherent limitation and interrogate

85

trace materials by exploiting the enormous electromagnetic field enhancement

86

resulted from the excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances at

87

nanostructured metallic surfaces, mostly gold or silver26, 27. It has been widely

88

applied for biological analysis, e.g., living cell classification28, cancer

89

detection29, biological imaging30 and virus detection31. For SARS-CoV-2, the

90

spike glycoprotein consists of S1 and S2 subunits, and S1 subunit contains a

91

receptor binding domain (RBD) directly recognizing the human receptor

92

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry

93

and binding might alter the structure of ACE2 and lead to changes in Raman

94

spectra. Additionally, the binding specificity allows ACE2 as an anchor to

ACE2@SN-SERS assay significantly quenches the spectral intensities of most

106

peaks and exhibits a red-shift from 1189 to 1182 cm-1.

107

In this study, we proposed a ‘capture-quenching’ strategy to rapidly detect

108

SARS-CoV-2 and developed a SERS assay introducing ACE2 functionalized

109

on silver-nanorod SERS substrates to capture and interrogate SARS-CoV-2

110

111

documented by either red-shift or whole spectral alterations in multivariate

analysis as biomarkers for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in real environmental

113

specimens.

2.1 Water samples and biological analysis

117

Seventeen water samples were collected from hospitals and pipe network in

118

Wuhan (China) from 24th March to 10th April, 2020 (Table 1). Around 2.0 L of

119

water was directly collected in a plexiglass sampler, placed in 4 °C ice-boxes

120

and immediately transferred into laboratory for RNA extraction following our

2.2 Preparation of silver-nanorod SERS array

151

The aligned silver-nanorod SERS (SN-SERS) array was fabricated in oblique

152

angle deposition (OAD) using a custom-designed electron beam/sputtering

153

evaporation system (Suzhou Derivative Biotechnology Co., LTD.) and formed

154

randomly on a 4-inch silicon wafer with increasing deposition time35. Briefly,

155

Si-wafer was immersed in absolute alcohol and blow-dried up using N2 gas

156

prior to loading on the substrate holder. The substrate holder was then fixed on

157

the specially designed Glancing Angle Deposition (GLAD) sample stage in an

158

e-beam evaporator. Deposition was performed at a base pressure lower than

159

3×10-4 Pa. The thickness of film growth was monitored using a quartz crystal

160

microbalance. Firstly, a thin layer of about 20 nm was deposited to assist the

161

adhesion of silver on Si-wafer, followed by the deposition of a base layer of

162

200 nm silver. The GLAD stage was then tilt to 84° with respect to the incident

163

vapor. A layer of 80 nm was then deposited with substrate rotation at 0.1 rev/s

164

to improve the seeding for nanorod growth. The deposition rate was 2 Å/s in

165

each stage and lasted about 3 h.

166

2.3 Fabrication of ACE2@SN-SERS substrate

167

ACE2 was purchased from Novoprotein (China) and stored in borate buffer

168

solution (0.1 M, pH=7.2) at -80°C before use. SN-SERS substrate was firstly

169

cleaned by thorough rinse with deionized water and dried using N2 gas flow.

170

Subsequently, 1 μL of ACE2 stock solution was loaded to SN-SERS substrate

171

and placed in an incubator under constant temperature and humidity

172

conditions (25°C; 75%, w/w) for 4 h. ACE2 was then bound onto the surface of

173

SN-SERS substrate, designated as ACE2@SN-SERS substrate, which could

174

be stored in 4°C for 2 weeks before use.

175

2.4 Raman spectral acquisition

176

For laboratory test, Raman spectra were acquired using a near-infrared

177

confocal Raman microscope (HR evolution, Horiba, USA) equipped with a 785

178

nm near-IR laser source, a 300 l/mm grating and a semiconductor-cooling

179

detector (CCD). All Raman spectra were collected with a 50× objective lens

180

(NA=0.7) at an exposure time of 10 seconds, 3 accumulations, and laser

181

power of 10 mW prior to lens. Raman spectroscopic system was calibrated

182

with a silicon wafer at Raman shift of 520 cm−1. At least five random regions

183

were measured for each sample, and a minimum of 9 individual spectra were

184

acquired per sample. A 785-nm portable Raman spectrometer (Finder Edge,

185

Zolix, China) was used for on-site diagnosis, and the ACE2@SN-SERS

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.02.20086876; this version posted May 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

186

substrate was placed on the probe of the portable Raman spectrometer with

187

the following parameters: 0.5 s acquisition time and 300 mW laser power. At

188

least five-time measurement was conducted for each sample. For both

189

laboratory and on-site test, all Raman spectra were recorded in the range of

190

100-3500 cm-1 in biological triplicates.

191

2.5 Multivariate analysis of Raman spectra

192

Raw spectral data were pre-processed by using the open source IRootLab

193

toolbox performed on MATLAB r2012

194

spectrum was cut to a biochemical-cell fingerprint region (900-1800 cm−1),

195

baseline corrected, wavelet de-noised, and vector normalized. Unlike

196

RT-qPCR and ELISA assay, our ACE2@SN-SERS assay generates Raman

197

spectral data, which are multivariate and difficult to generate an individual

198

variable for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we used two approaches to distinguish the

199

difference between positive and negative samples. Firstly, the ratio of Raman

200

intensity at 1182 cm-1 to that at 1189 cm-1 was calculated, designated as

201

1182/1189 ratio, as an indicator for diagnostic prediction. Alternatively,

202

multivariate analysis was applied to the pre-processed spectral data to reduce

203

data dimensions and extract key information. Principal component analysis

204

(PCA) is an unsupervised data analytical method reducing the dimensionality

205

of data, determining principal components (PCs) and extracting key features 37,

206

38, 39

207

selected spectral regions, were then inputted into linear discriminate analysis

208

(LDA), which determines the discriminant function line that maximizes the

209

inter-class distance and minimizes the intra-class distance to derive an optimal

210

linear boundary separating the different classes

211

plots and cluster vectors are generated, and the scores of the linear

212

discriminant 1 (LD1) provides the best classification39, 40.

213

2.6 Statistical analysis

214

One-way ANOVA was used to compare the difference between samples and

3. Results and discussions

217

3.1 Features of SN-SERS and ACE2@SN-SERS substrates

218

SEM images (Figure 2A) illustrated a successful fabrication of silver nanorods

219

on SERS substrate. The overall diameter and length of silver nanorods was

220

211±45 and 737±52 nm, respectively, and the uniform structure demonstrated

221

a density of 8 nanorods/μm2. After functionalization with ACE2 protein, clear

222

protein structures were observed on ACE2@SN-SERS substrate, exhibiting as

223

small islands with a diameter of 2 μm (Figure 2B).

224

The background Raman signals of SN-SERS substrate without ACE2

225

exhibited no significant peaks from 900 to 1800 cm-1 (Figure 2C), showing a

226

satisfactory

227

ACE2@SN-SERS substrate generated remarkable SERS signals, around 400

228

times stronger than SN-SERS substrate (Figure 2C). The featured Raman

229

peaks are probably assigned with phenylalanine (1032 cm-1)41, C-N stretching

bending was observed. It is possibly induced by the change in N-H vibration

256

mode or the bond length of N-H46, 47, in response to the interfered H-bond of

257

ACE2 after recognizing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The crystal structure of

258

SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD bound to the ACE2 receptor indicates the networks of

259

hydrophilic interactions at RBD/ACE2 interfaces

260

conceivable existence of hydrogen bond elucidating the strength change of

261

N-H bond

262

Thus, our results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can be recognized

263

and bound by ACE2@SN-SERS substrate, consequently changing ACE2

264

structure to induce the SERS signal quenching. Such significant Raman signal

265

change demonstrated that our designed ACE2@SN-SERS assay has a

266

satisfactory performance in SARS-CoV-2 interrogation.

269

In on-site test, Raman spectra of ACE2 acquired via the portable Raman

spectrometer exhibited coherent spectral peaks presented at 1032, 1052,

271

1089, 1189, 1447 and 1527 cm-1 comparing to those from the research-level

272

Raman spectrometer in laboratory (Figure 4A), although relatively high signal

noises were observed. It indicated the robustness of our developed

274

ACE2@SN-SERS array and feasibility for on-site diagnosis. Raman spectra of

275

water samples on ACE2@SN-SERS array exhibited different SERS spectra

276

(Figure 4A). Some of them illustrated significant signal quenching, e.g., JYTCC,

277

JYTCC2 and JYTCC3, whereas others possessing similar spectral patterns as

290

RT-qPCR results had separated all water samples into positive and negative

291

groups for SARS-CoV-2. To distinguish these two groups from SERS spectra,

292

we first used 1189/1182 ratio as a biomarker, as the red-shift from 1189 to 1182

293

cm-1 was the most remarkable spectral alteration. Figure 3C shows a

294

significant difference in 1189/1182 ratio between positive and negative groups

295

(p<0.001), averagely 1.311±0.446 and 0.766±0.218, respectively. Setting

296

0.900 or 1.000 as the threshold, the accuracy of 1189/1182 ratio reaches

297

93.33%, and the false-positive and false-negative percentage is 10% and 0%,

298

respectively (Figure 3E). Thus, 1189/1182 ratio is a satisfactory biomarker to

299

diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in water samples.

300

Nevertheless, the intrinsic SERS analysis provided convoluted Raman signals

301

derived from ACE2 proteins or complexes of ACE2 and spike protein of

302

SARS-CoV-2 located in plasmonic hot spot regions, it is crucial to employ

303

multivariate method to extract information in these complex multivariable

304

spectroscopic data for a better interrogation. Herein, the whole Raman spectra

305

from 900 to 1800 cm-1 acquired Raman data from on-site test were analyzed

306

by PCA-LDA in a hierarchical manner. PCA-LDA score plot clearly segregates

307

the positive and negative groups regardless some overlaps (Figure 3B). The

308

grey-labeled samples (HSSBC and JYTBC) are negative for SARS-CoV-2 by

309

RT-PCR but fall into the positive group in PCA-LDA, whereas HN06 in

310

PCA-LDA negative group had a Cq value of 31.61. Such contradictory results

311

might be explained by different principles between these two assays.

312

RT-qPCR targets SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment, whereas our ACE2@SN-SERS

313

assay recognizes SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. As RNA has a shorter half-life

314

and is more easily degraded than protein, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein occur

315

hypothetically longer time than RNA, particularly after disinfection could

316

breakdown viral envelops and RNA. Since LD1 scores derived from PCA-LDA

317

model provide the best classification, they are assigned as criteria and exhibit

318

significant difference between the positive and negative groups (p<0.001). The

319

accuracy by LD1 scores is 93.33% when the threshold is 0.370 or 0.380, while

320

the false-positive or false-negative percentage is 0% and 20%, respectively.

321

Together with 1182/1189 ratio, our findings proved the feasibility of the

322

developed ACE2@SN-SERS assay to on-site interrogate SARS-CoV-2 in real

323

water samples, and both indicators (1182/1189 ratio and LD1 scores) have

324

satisfactory performances.

3.4 Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in real water samples from Wuhan

326

Cq value of crude water from wards of Huoshenshan Hospital (HSSCC) and

327

Jinyintan Hospital (JYTCC) was 37.05 and 38.34, respectively, showing the

328

presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. The results became negative in the

329

biological treatment sector (HSSBC) and aerobic biodegradation sector

330

(JYTBC) in the wastewater treatment plants of Huoshenshan and Jinyintan

331

Hospitals (Table 1). However, both 1182/1189 ratios and LD1 scores by

332

ACE2@SN-SERS assay had contradictory results that SARS-CoV-2 was

333

present in all wastewater samples throughout in the treatment process despite

334

of slight decay (Figure 4A and 4E). It might be explained by higher stability of

335

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein than RNA after disinfection, and the residual spike

336

proteins were still detectable but the infectivity was of low risk. Our findings

337

indicated a decay of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA along wastewater treatment

338

process, consistent with previous reported facts that both RNA (Norovirus GGI,

339

GGII, sapovirus, and Aichi virus)

340

adenoviruses, JC polyomaviruses, BK polyomaviruses)

341

removed in conventional and biological wastewater treatment plants. The

342

presence of SARS-CoV-2 in adjusting tanks might pose threats to workers for

343

medical wastewater treatment, and their personal care protections are

344

suggested to prevent potential infection. The rapidness and easy operation of

345

this developed ACE2@SN-SERS assay offers a solution to monitor

346

SARS-CoV-2 in medical wastewater treatment plants, allowing on-site

347

assessment of potential spreading risks on workers and surrounding

379

results for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, and exhibited no SARS-CoV-2 spike

380

protein from clear Raman shifts at 1189 cm-1 in ACE2@SN-SERS assay

381

(Figure 3A). After receiving wastewater from Huanan Seafood Market, the

382

positive RT-qPCR results (Table 1, Cq=31.64), 1182/1189 ratios (Figure 4D)

383

and LD1 scores (Figure 4H) hinted the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into pipelines,

384

and it declined in downstream pipe network. Different from RT-qPCR assay

385

requiring RNA extraction and laboratory amplification, the developed

386

ACE2@SN-SERS assay allows onsite diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 with portable

387

Raman spectrometers, showing huge potentials for field practices to track the

388

presence and source of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage pipe network.

389

3.5 Prospective

390

In this study, our developed ACE2@SN-SERS assay provides good accuracy

391

and satisfactory performance for the rapid and onsite diagnosis of

392

SARS-CoV-2 in environmental specimens, meeting well with RT-qPCR results.

393

Compared with RT-qPCR and ELISA assays, this ACE2@SN-SERS assay

394

has three advantages. Firstly, ACE2@SN-SERS assay does not rely on RNA

395

extraction or immune biomarker, simplifying the sample preparation procedure

396

and shortening the measurement time. Secondly, spike protein is more stable

397

than RNA as the biomarker for SARS-CoV-2, hinting a more stable and

398

sensitive assay particularly for environmental specimens. Last but not the least,

399

we have proved that portable Raman spectrometers can provide satisfactory

400

signals with ACE2@SN-SERS assay and allows rapid interrogation of

401

SARS-CoV-2 on site.

402

There are some limitations in this work. Firstly, our ACE2@SN-SERS assay

403

cannot evaluate viral viability or infectivity as free spike proteins or viral

404

envelop are also recognizable by ACE2@SN-SERS substrates to quench

405

SERS signals, possibly overestimating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in human

406

or environmental specimens. Secondly, only limited real samples were tested

407

and the interference of other viruses targeting ACE2 for cell entry is still

408

questionable, owing to the restriction in sample collection and clinical tests

409

during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Nevertheless, the mentioned

410

advantages prove ACE2@SN-SERS assay as a reliable and for mobile

411

detection platform or screening system for clinal and environmental diagnosis

412

onsite under a variety of conditions. Our state-of-the-art work also raises a

413

concept to screen other viruses with RBD recognizing receptors of human cells

414

for entry and evaluate the recognition strength of SARS-like viruses across

415

mammalian species, when different RBD-containing viruses are tested or

416

human cell receptors are functionalized for substrate fabrication. As a possible

417

in-vitro assay, ACE2@SN-SERS substrate might also contribute to the

418

assessment of vaccine efficiency. Further studies need to address those

419

possibilities and establish robust databases and algorithms for a faster

420

interrogation, even down to 1 min, for clinical and environmental purposes.

421

4. Conclusion

422

A novel ACE2@SN-SERS assay was developed in this study by

423

functionalizing human cellular receptor ACE2 proteins on silver-nanorods and

424

generating strong SERS signals. The successful and significant quenching of

425

SERS signal intensities in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins proved

426

its capability in capturing and recognizing SARS-CoV-2. Onsite tests on 17

427

water samples using a portable Raman spectrometer achieved satisfactory

428

performance in interrogating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in environmental

429

specimens, although some inconsistent with RT-qPCR results. At the current

430

stage, the developed ACE2@SN-SERS assay had acceptable accuracy,

431

false-positive and false-negative percentages, which can be further improved

432

by fabrication implementation, database set-up and algorithm optimization. It

433

has a bright future and huge potential as a rapid and on-site diagnostic tool for

434

SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses to confirm patients, determine community

435

cases and track environmental viral sources in pandemics.
