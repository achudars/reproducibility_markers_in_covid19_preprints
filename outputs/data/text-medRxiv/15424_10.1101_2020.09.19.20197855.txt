Abstract
Objectives: The implementation of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) may enhance the efficiency
of SARS-CoV-2 testing, as RDTs are widely accessible and easy to use. The aim of this study
was to evaluate the performance of a diagnosis strategy based on a combination of antigen
and IgM/IgG serological RDTs.
Methods: Plasma and nasopharyngeal samples were collected between 14 March and 11 April
2020 at hospital admission from 45 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 and 20
negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) was assessed in nasopharyngeal swabs using
the Coris Respi-Strip. For IgM/IgG detection, SureScreen Diagnostics and Szybio Biotech
RDTs were used in addition to laboratory assays (Abbott Alinity i SARS-CoV-2 IgG and
Theradiag COVID-19 IgM ELISA).
Results: Using the Ag RDT, 13 out of 45 (29.0%) specimens tested positive, the sensitivity was
87.0% for Cycle Threshold (CT) values ≤ 25 and 0% for CT values > 25. IgG detection was
associated with high CT values and the amount of time after the onset of symptoms. The profile
of isolated IgM on RDTs was more frequently observed during the first and second week after
the onset of symptoms. The combination of Ag and IgM/IgG RDTs enabled the detection of up
to 84.0% of COVID-19 confirmed cases at hospital admission.
Conclusion: Antigen and antibody-based RDTs showed suboptimal performances when used
alone. However when used in combination, they are able to identify most COVID-19 patients
admitted in an emergency department.

Introduction

Reported for the first time in December 2019, COVID-19 has become a major public health
concern worldwide. Currently, clinical management of COVID-19 is mainly based on the
prevention of transmission, viral tests, and supportive care. Wide access to SARS-CoV-2
testing is one of the keys to protecting populations. To be efficient, diagnostic assays must be
accessible in different settings, ranging from the hospital to the community level, and from low
to high incomes countries 1. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for
the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens
(nasopharyngeal swab, throat swab, and sputum) is the gold standard to confirm COVID-19 2.
RT-PCR tests have an overall sensitivity estimated around 70.0% in nasopharyngeal
sampling3 with a high specificity. RT-PCR is ideal for the diagnosis of COVID-19 during the
first week after the onset of symptoms because the viral load is high during this period. Beyond
day 14, when the viral load is low or undetectable, the performance of RT-PCR diminishes 4.
In such situations, serological tests may help to confirm a COVID-19 diagnosis in individuals
with a high clinical suspicion but who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Both nucleic acid tests and automated serological tests require sample collection,
transportation, and laboratory analysis, leading to a delayed response and limiting the
efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies. Furthermore, insufficient access to nearby
laboratory facilities is a major concern in intermediate and low-income countries. A diagnostic
test is characterized not only by its analytical performance, mainly estimated by sensitivity (Se)
and specificity (Sp) but also by its overall accessibility 5. The implementation of rapid diagnostic
tests (RDTs) in the diagnosis of COVID-19 could have significant benefits by enhancing the
efficiency of large testing strategies 6. RTDs are useful devices that facilitate testing outside of
laboratory settings, a capability needed for hard to reach populations 7. In addition, RTDs
deliver results in a shorter amount of time than RT-PCR. This time saving is important for the
identification, isolation and provision of appropriate clinical care to patients with COVID-19.
RTDs also reduce overloads in emergency departments 8.

COVID-19 RDTs are based on the detection of either SARS-CoV-2 antigen in respiratory
specimens or anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in whole blood or plasma/serum. Experience with
RDTs used to detect antigens from other respiratory viruses in respiratory samples suggests
that the sensitivity of these tests is lower than that of nucleic acid tests, ranging from 34.0% to
80.0% 9. Recent publications have confirmed that COVID-19 RDTs are considerably less
sensitive than molecular tests, and may therefore generate false negative results

10

. Antigen

detection is mainly dependant on the viral concentration, hence most specimens with high viral
concentrations test positive for antigen 11–13. In contrast to RDTs based on Ag detection, RDTs
that detects anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are widely available, and a very large number have
been approved by the FDA and CE. Although weak or absent humoral responses have been
reported, especially in mild and moderate forms of COVID-19, most patients develops an
antibody response within the first two weeks of COVID-19 14–16. Serologic assays also can be
useful in conjunction with molecular assays for the clinical assessment of persons who present
themselves for testing long after the onset of symptoms. While RDTs might constitute a simple
screening method, they have shown limitations in the early phase of acute infections due to
the time required for an antibody response. Consequently, COVID-19 diagnosis based on IgM
and IgG detection is often delayed to the second phase of the disease, when some
opportunities for therapy and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission already have been lost.
Due to the overall performance of the tests, WHO and FDA do not recommend the use of Ag
or antibody-detecting RDTs as the sole basis for the diagnosis of infection, but are encouraging
research studies to establish their usefulness. Diagnostic algorithms based on Ag plus
antibodies detection using RDTs need to be compared to the molecular techniques which
currently are the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis 7. The aim of this study was to evaluate
the performance of a combination of antigen and serological RDTs to diagnose COVID-19 in
hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR.

Material and Methods

Plasma and nasopharyngeal samples were collected from patients admitted in Montpellier
University hospitals between 14 March and 11 April 2020 who tested positive for SARS-CoV2 RNA. Patient characteristics are detailed in Table 1. The estimated date of the onset of
symptoms was recorded and ranged from 1 day to 20 days before hospital admission. The
severity of COVID-19 was defined by WHO guidelines

17

. Controls consisted of samples

collected in the pre-COVID-19 period (2017-2018) in patients and stored at -80°C until used
(DC-2015-2473). The cohort received an institutional ethics committee approval (CPP Ile de
France III, n°2020-A00935−34; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04347850).

RT-PCR method
The Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) was used as the reference
method to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. This RT-PCR simultaneously amplifies three
different genes: the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene in the Cal
Red 610 channel, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene in the Quasar 670 channel, and
the Sarbecovirus envelope (E) gene in the FAM channel. The result represents the positive
result for the E gene of Sarbecovirus, the RdRP gene and the N gene of COVID-19,
respectively. Nasopharyngeal samples were tested prospectively within a few hours after
collection and without any cooling or freezing step. Swabs were collected in various transport
media (eSwab™ COPAN Amies 1 ml, ∑-Transwab® liquid Amies, viral transport medium
tube VTM-M 2.0ml). A 200µl nasopharyngeal sample was added in 200 µl Tissue Lysis
Buffer (ATL) to inactivate the virus. These 400µl of sample were extracted and amplified
by multiplex real time RT-PCR. COVID-19 confirmed-subjects were grouped according to
the average value of the Cycle Threshold (CT), CT ≤ 25, 25 < CT < 35 and CT ≥ 35.

Laboratory IgG and IgM immunoassays
Plasma samples were tested using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay on the Alinity i system
(Abbott, Illinois, USA). The SARS-CoV-2 assay is a chemiluminescent microparticule
immunoassay (CMIA) intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein IgG.
The cut-off value for a positive result was defined by the manufacturer’s instructions: a
ratio<1.4 calculated index (S/C) is considered negative and a ratio ≥ 1.4 is considered positive.
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM were not assessed by the Alinity i platform since the assay was not
available at the time of the study.
IgM directed against SARS-CoV-2 protein S were detected using the ELISA COVID-19
THERA02 IgM assays (Theradiag, Marne la Vallée, France). The IgM positive cut-off is ratio≥1.
All tests were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)
The Coris COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip (BioConcept®, Gembloux, Belgium), was used to test Ag
in nasopharyngeal specimens. The assay is based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens
in nasopharyngeal samples. This lateral flow assay uses colloidal gold nanoparticles sensitized
with monoclonal antibodies directed against highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein
antigens.
Two SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow assays were evaluated. These RDTs use a chromatographic
immunoassay format and are dedicated to the qualitative detection of IgG and IgM antibodies
directed against SARS-CoV-2 in human whole blood, serum and plasma. The SureScreen
Diagnostics Ltd (Derby, United Kingdom) COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test requires 10µl of
sample collected and 80µl of buffer. The Szybio Biotech Joint Stock Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China)
SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG Antibody Assay Kit requires 10µl of serum, plasma or 20µl of whole
blood sample and 60µl of buffer. During testing, the specimen reacts with SARS-CoV-2
antigen-coated particles in the test cassette. In the presence of a control signal, any signal
visible in the IgM and/or IgG position at 15 minutes on the test line, even a weak one, must be
interpreted as positive.

Statistical analyses
The experimental data were summarized by number and percentage for categorical variable,
i.e., positive and negative results. The analysis considers 45 patients; for each one we have a
nasopharyngeal sample and a plasma sample collected on the same day. The 45
nasopharyngeal samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The controls consisted
of 20 nasopharyngeal and plasma samples collected in the pre-COVID-19 period (2017-2018).
COVID-19 confirmed patients were grouped in three categories according to RT-PCR values:
CT ≤ 25, 25 < CT < 35 and CT ≥ 35. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0
(GraphPad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, California).

Results

RT-PCR CT results and SARS-CoV-2 serological results using laboratory assays.
CT values were compared with the amount of time following the onset of symptoms. The two
parameters were moderately correlated (R2= 0.3151, Fig.1).
The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG was retrospectively assessed on plasma
samples collected at admission in the emergency department using anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG
CMIA and IgM ELISA (Sup. Tables. S1. A and B).
A total of 24 out of 45 COVID-19 confirmed patients tested positive for IgG using the Abbott
assay, resulting in a sensitivity (95% CI) of 53.3% (38.8 – 67.9) (Sup. Tables. S1. A and B). All
but one patient tested two weeks after the onset of symptoms tested positive for IgG using the
Abbott assay (Fig. 2). Signal to cut-off values were moderately correlated with the amount of
time after the onset of symptoms (R² = 0.3139, Fig. 2). CT values were higher in patients who
tested positive for IgG than in IgG negative patients (median (IQR) = 33.1 (27.0 – 36.2); versus
25.5 (22.1 – 32.0), respectively (p=0.0073, Fig. 3). The IgG Abbott test had a sensitivity of
33.3% (9.2 – 56.8) for a CT value ≤ 25 at hospital admission, reaching 80.0% (59.8 – 100.0)
for a CT value ≥ 35.

IgM directed against the S protein were detected in 24 specimens using the Theradiag ELISA,
sensitivity (95% CI): 53.3% (38.8 – 67.9) (Sup. Tables. S1. A and B). Theradiag ELISA IgM
ratios were not correlated with the amount of time after the onset of symptoms (R2= 0.0413)
(data not shown). The CT values were higher in patients who tested positive for IgM, 32.8%
(25.7 – 35.2) versus 26.7% (20.6 – 32.2) in IgM negative patients (p=0.0209, Fig. 4). The
Theradiag IgM ELISA had a sensitivity (95% CI) of 33.3 % (9.2 – 56.8) for a CT value ≤ 25 at
hospital admission, reaching 80.0% (59.8 – 100.0) for a CT value ≥ 35. Furthermore, sensitivity
was 50.0% (29.1 – 70.9) when the estimated time since the onset of symptoms was ≤ 7 days,
reaching 67.0% (36.3 – 97.7) ≥ 14 days (Sup. Tables S1. A and B).

SARS-CoV-2 antigen and IgM/IgG testing using RDTs
Nasopharyngeal and plasma samples then were tested for SARS-CoV-2 Ag and IgM/IgG using
RDTs. All results of antigen and serologic RDTs were considered valid based on a visible
control band, although the intensity of the band was weak for some specimens. Clinical
samples collected from COVID-19 negative patients were used to assess the specificities of
the RDTs. All controls samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibodies
regardless of the assay (specificity=100.0%).
Among 45 nasopharyngeal samples collected in confirmed Covid-19 patients, 13 specimens
tested positive using the Ag RDT, resulting in a sensitivity (95% CI) of 29.0% (15.7 – 42.3)
(Fig.1 and Sup. Table S1. A). The median CT value was lower in Ag positive samples
compared to negative ones (median (IQR) = 21.4 (18.6 – 23.8) versus 32.5 (28.2 – 35.2),
p<0.0001, Fig. 5). The Ag RDT had a sensitivity (95% CI) of 87.0% (70.0 – 100.0) for CT values
≤ 25 and 0% for CT values > 25 (Sup. Table 1.A). The sensitivity was 41.0% (20.4 – 61.6) in
samples collected during the first week after the onset of symptoms, 29.0% (5.2 – 52.8) during
the second week, and 0% after 14 days or more (Sup. Table S1. B).
Among the 45 blood samples collected in confirmed COVID-19 cases, 31 tested positive for
IgM using the SureScreen RDT, resulting in a sensitivity (95% CI) of 68.9% (55.4 - 82.4).

Seventeen samples tested positive for IgM but negative for IgG using the serology RDTs.
Among these samples, IgM were also detected by ELISA in 11 out of 17 cases (Sup. Fig S4.
B). RT-PCR CT values were higher in patients who tested positive using the SureScreen IgM
compared to those who tested negative (median (IQR): 31.9 (5.5 - 35.1) versus 25.0 (18.8 –
29.0), p=0.0084, Fig. 4). Hence, the sensitivity (95% CI) of the SureScreen IgM RDT was
46.7% (21.5 – 72.0) for CT values ≤ 25, reaching 86.7% (69.5 – 100.0) for CT values ≥ 35.
Additionally, the SureScreen IgM RDT has a sensitivity (95% CI) of 64.0% (43.9 – 84.1) when
the estimated time from the onset of symptoms was ≤ 7 days, reaching 78.0% (50.9 – 100.0)
when ≥ 14 days (Sup. Table S1. A and B). Using the Szybio RDT, a total of 29 specimens
tested positive for IgM, resulting in a sensitivity of 64.4% (50.5 – 78.4). Seventeen samples
were IgM positive but IgG negative, and among these, IgM were also detected by ELISA in 11
samples (Sup. Fig S4. B). The CT value of the RT-PCR was higher in patients who tested
positive for IgM using the Szybio RDT compared those who tested negative (median (IQR):
31.9 (24.9 – 35.0) versus 26.0 (19.6 – 31.3), p=0.0304, Fig. 4). The sensitivity of the Szybio
IgM RDT was 46.7% (21.5 – 72.0) for CT values ≤ 25, and reached 80.0% (59.8 – 100.0) for
CT values ≥ 35. In addition, the Szybio RDT had a sensitivity of 64.0 (43.9 – 84.1) when the
estimated time from the onset of symptoms ≤ 7 days, reaching 67.0% (36.3 – 97.7) when ≥ 14
days (Sup. Tables S1. A and B).
All samples that tested positive for IgG using both the SureScreen and the Szybio RDTs also
tested positive for IgM. The proportion of IgG positive samples rises according to the CT values
and the time from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms (Sup. Tables S1. A and B).
COVID-19 diagnosis using the antigen and IgG/IgM-based RDTs
The combination of the Coris COVID-19 Ag and the SureScreen IgM RDTs detected 38 out of
45 specimens, resulting in a sensitivity (95% CI) of 84.0% (73.3 – 94.7), while the combination
of the Coris COVID-19 Ag and the Szybio IgM RDTs detected 36 specimens, resulting in a
sensitivity of 80.0% (68.3 – 91.7) (Fig. 6). The combination of RDTs based on Ag plus IgM
detection significantly improved the identification of COVID-19 cases at hospital admission

p=0.0142, respectively, Fig. 6).

Discussion

In this study, we observed that a majority of nasopharyngeal samples with high concentrations
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA collected in the early phase of the infection tested positive for COVID-19
using an antigen RDT, while IgM/IgG serological testing detected patients later in the course
of the disease. A combination of an antigen-based RDT that indicates the presence of the
virus, and an IgM-based RDT that determines whether or not a person has recently been
immunized against the virus, may be useful in settings where access to fast RT-PCR methods
is limited.
Our results using the Ag RDT on samples with high SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations are in
11

line with previous studies that have reported sensitivities of 74.2%

, 85.7%

13

, and 100%

12

for CT values below 25. For specimens which tested positive with CT values over 25, the Ag
RDT was not optimal because it was positive in only 12.5% of cases on a nasopharyngeal
swab

11

. Furthermore, according to Cochrane Library, the average sensitivity (95% CI) of the

point-of-care antigen test corresponds to 56.2% (29.5 – 79.8)

18

.

A. Scohy et al. have

estimated the lower limit of detection of the Coris Ag RDT to be equivalent to 1.8 × 105
copies/mL

12

. Success in SARS-CoV-2 isolation in nasopharyngeal specimens suggests that

infectivity is low at this level of CT values

4,19,20

. Data on the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA

indicate that the viral load peaks within the first days after the onset of symptoms 4. Hence, Ag
RDTs may be interesting in the early phase of the infection when the viral load is high and the
risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is at its maximum. SARS-CoV-2 Ag testing requires
nasopharyngeal collection and strict procedures with personal protective equipment to prevent
SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. Despite this drawback, our results show that Ag testing using the
Coris RDT can detect the virus before the development of a serological response, and Ag tests
might have some advantages when used as a triage test in a pandemic context. First, Ag

testing is simple and can be performed in about 15 minutes after the collection of samples.
Secondly, the Coris Ag RDT that targets the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved
nucleoprotein antigen does not cross-react with seasonal coronaviruses

11

. Hence, the

specificity of the assay appears close to 100% in all published studies 11–13 . Thanks to its high
specificity and positive predictive value, a positive result using the Coris RDT would make it
possible to avoid or delay the RT-PCR test 11. The two serological RDTs evaluated in this study
also showed a high specificity but a variable sensitivity according to antibody isotype, time from
onset of symptoms and RT-PCR CT values. The performances of the RDTs to detect IgG was
lower than that of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. While these RDTs had a lower capacity
to detect low IgG concentrations compared to the chemiluminescence immunoassay, both the
SureScreen RDT and the Szybio RDT had a good capacity to detect IgM (Sup. Figures S4. A
and B). Results of previous studies suggest that the performances of immunoassays to detect
IgM in the early phase of infection varies considerably according to the methods used. The
detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM have been observed several days before the detection of
IgG 21,22, but others studies reported IgM seroconversion at the same time or after IgG

23–27

. It

has been established that during the B cell response, IgM cells are present before IgG class
switching. However, during the course of COVID-19 infection, the peak of IgM may be low and
delayed compared to that of IgG. Data from a recent study comparing COVID-19 RDTs confirm
that the analytical sensitivity for IgM is highly variable depending on the assay whereas the
detection of IgG is more homogeneous 28, hence early IgM detection is strongly dependent on
the test used. Beside detection of seroconversion in the early phase of infection, assessment
of SARS-CoV-2 IgM may be of interest to distinguish between a recent versus a later
immunization since most COVID-19 cases become seronegative for IgM within two months
after symptom onset 29.
The overall efficiency of diagnostic strategies is not only characterized by the intrinsic
performances of in vitro assays, which are mainly estimated through sensitivity and specificity,
but also by their accessibility 8, effectiveness, speed of process, and period of time to obtain
results. Furthermore, diagnosis can benefit from a testing algorithm based on successive steps

of triage, screening, and confirmation. Tests performed at the point-of-care offer interesting
benefits, including rapid diagnosis and simplicity of use outside of laboratory facilities

18

. Our

results have shown that a combination of antigen and antibodies-based RDTs is highly specific
and detects most carriers of SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the hospital at different times over the
course of the COVID-19 infection. A synthetic representation of variation over time in biological
markers for COVID-19 diagnosis is proposed in Figure 7.

In conclusion, our results show that the Coris Ag immunochromatographic assay has
insufficient sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 when used alone, but it could be a
valuable tool when used in an integrative diagnostic strategy. Ag and IgM/IgG rapid diagnosis
assays are complementary, and when used in combination are able to identify most patients
with COVID-19 admitted in an emergency department. To be an effective alternative to nucleic
acid tests and have a significant place in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
RDTs must combine high sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens and early and specific
detection of IgM.

Figure 6: Performances of diagnostic strategies combining antigen and serological
RDTs at hospital admission in patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR. The
diagnostic test results correspond to the proportion of patients with COVID-19 detected by
RDTs. The p value was calculated using the Exact binomial’s test and compares the
performances of a combination of antigen and serological RDTs versus antigen and serological
RDTs use alone.

Figure 7. Variation over time in biological markers for COVID-19 diagnosis. High viral
load (RT-PCR CT value < 25) and antigen detection in nasopharyngeal specimens
characterize the first week after the onset of symptoms when the risk of SARS-CoV-2
transmission is at its maximum. The second week of COVID-19 infection is the period when
the absence of detectable Ag and IgM/IgG is the most probable. The eclipse phase of
antigen/IgM/IgG combined RDTs is most likely observable during this time period. A low level
or the absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA alongside IgG and IgM detection is observed two weeks
after the onset of symptoms in most patients.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG serological tests

Supplemental Figure S2: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection using rapid
serological diagnosis tests according to RT-PCR CT values. Cycle threshold (CT) values
recorded by RT-PCR methods Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay Seegene. The boxes represent
interquartile ranges with the horizontal line indicating the median CT values and the whiskers
showing minimal and maximal CT values. The p value was calculated using the Mann-Whitney
U test, and compares the distribution of CT values in serological diagnosis tests with positive
and negative results.

Days since Onset of Symptom

Supplemental Figure S3. A: Diagnostic test results (%) according to test used and days
since onset of symptoms. The diagnostic test results correspond to the proportion of patients
with COVID-19 detected by RDTs. Patients in the cohort were divided into three groups
according to the days since the onset of symptoms: ≤7 days (n=22); 7-14 days (n=14) and ≥14
days (n=9). The p value was calculated using Exact binomial’s test and compares, according
to the days since the onset of symptoms, the performance of a combination of antigen and
serological RDTs versus antigen and serological RDTs use alone.

RT-PCR CT value

Supplemental Figure S3. B: Diagnostic test results (%) according to test used and RTPCR CT value. The diagnostic test results correspond to the proportion of patients with
COVID-19 detected by RDTs. Patients in the cohort were divided into three groups according
to RT-PCR CT values: CT≤25; 25<CT<35 and CT≥35. The p value was calculated using Exact
binomial’s test and compares, according to the RT-PCR CT value, the performance of a
combination of antigen and serological RDTs versus antigen and serological RDTs use alone.

of the signal to control values (S/C) were reported. The dotted line indicates the positive
threshold (≥ 1.4). The boxes represent interquartile ranges with the horizontal line indicating
the median CT value and the whiskers showing minimal and maximal CT values. The p value
was calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test and compares the distribution of IgG (S/C)
