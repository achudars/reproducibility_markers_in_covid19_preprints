TITLE
Benefits and risks of zinc for adults during covid-19: rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of
randomised controlled trials.

ABSTRACT
Objective: To evaluate the benefits and risks of any type of zinc intervention to prevent or treat
SARS-CoV-2.

Design: A living, systematic review and meta-analysis, incorporating rapid review methods.
Data sources: 17 English and Chinese databases and clinical trial registries were searched in
April/May 2020, with additional covid-19 focused searches in June and August 2020.

Eligibility criteria and analysis: Randomized control trials (RCTs) published in any language
comparing zinc to a control to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2. Other viral respiratory tract infections
(RTIs) were included, but the certainty of evidence downgraded twice for indirectness. Screening,
data extraction, risk of bias appraisal (RoB-2 tool) and verification was performed by calibrated,
single reviewers. RCTs with adult populations were prioritised for analysis.

Results: 123 RCTs were identified. None were specific to SARS-CoV-2 nor other coronaviruses. 28
RCTs evaluated oral (15-45mg daily), sublingual (45-300mg daily), or topical nasal (0.09-2.6 mg daily)
zinc to prevent or treat nonspecific viral RTIs in 3,597 adults without zinc deficiency. Compared to
placebo, zinc prevented 5 mild to moderate RTIs per 100 person-months, including in older adults
(95% confidence interval 1 to 9) (number needed to treat (NTT)=20). There was no significant
difference in the rates of non-serious adverse events (AE). For RTI treatment, a clinically important
reduction in peak symptom severity scores was found for zinc compared to placebo (mean
difference 1.2 points, 0.7 to 1.7), but not average daily symptom severity (standardised mean
difference 0.2, 0.1 to 0.4). 19 fewer per 100 adults were at risk of remaining symptomatic over the
first 7 days (2 to 38, NNT=5) and the mean duration of symptoms was 2 days shorter (0.2 to 3.5),
however, there was substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 82% and 97%). 14 more per 100 experienced a
non-serious AE (4 to 16, NNT=7) such as nausea, or mouth or nasal irritation. No differences in illness
duration nor AE were found when zinc was compared to active controls. No serious AE, including
copper deficiency, were reported by any RCT. Quality of life outcomes were not assessed.
Confidence in these findings for SARS-CoV-2 is very low due to serious indirectness and some
concerns about bias for most outcomes.

Conclusions: Zinc is a potential therapeutic candidate for preventing and treating SARS-CoV-2,
including older adults and adults without zinc deficiency (very low certainty). Zinc may also help to
prevent other viral RTIs during the pandemic (moderate certainty) and reduce the severity and
duration of symptoms (very low certainty). The pending results from seven RCTs evaluating zinc for
SARS-CoV-2 will be tracked.

BACKGROUND
In response to the global covid-19 pandemic, the Cochrane Collaboration developed a list of review
priority questions1 and resources for conducting high quality rapid reviews.2 Available antiviral, antiinflammatory and anticoagulant pharmaceuticals are being evaluated.3 Other interventions also
being investigated include host-directed therapies and nutritional interventions.4 Zinc is one such
intervention. By May 2020, 19 clinical trials evaluating zinc for the prevention or treatment of SARSCoV-2 infections, either as a stand-alone therapy or combined with other pharmaceuticals or
nutraceuticals, had been registered on at least one international clinical trial registry.5
Many people are not waiting for definitive evidence. Both high and low income countries have
reported increased zinc supplement use and sales related to the covid-19 pandemic,6 7 including selfprescribing of prophylactic zinc by healthcare workers8 and some clinicians and hospitals using zinc
to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.9-19
Findings for zinc from five retrospective observational studies and a case series have reported mixed
results. In India, no added protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection was found for healthcare workers
who used various prophylactic nutritional interventions including zinc.8 In the United States, reduced
in-hospital mortality was reported when 50mg to 100mg of elemental zinc was used orally alongside
the zinc ionophore, hydroxychloroquine, but not when either intervention was used alone,16 and the
addition of 100mg of elemental zinc to a hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin protocol was also found
to reduce the risk of mortality or transfer to hospice care.17 Two other studies however, reported
minimal, if any, benefit from zinc use on the survival of adults hospitalised with SAR-CoV-2

infection.18 19 Regarding community treatment, in a case series of four adults with confirmed or
suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic recovery coincided with the administration of high
dose zinc lozenges of 115mg to 207mg elemental zinc daily.20
Most covid-19 prevention and treatment guidelines are yet to mention zinc.21-27 An exception is the
National Institute of Health (NIH) that in July 2020, stated there is insufficient evidence to make any
recommendations for acute treatment with zinc.28 Based on expert opinion, the NIH made a
moderately strong recommendation against the use of zinc in doses above the recommended daily
intake of zinc for the prevention of covid-19 (i.e. 8mg to 14mg of elemental zinc for adults). This was
due to concerns about secondary copper deficiency.29 30
The rationale for zinc has been reviewed in detail elsewhere.5 31 32 In summary, zinc has direct
antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.31-33 There is the potential for
broader multisystem effects via modulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 activity,
inflammation, immunity, haemostasis and hypoxic responses.5 31 32 34 Further, the risk factors for
severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as increasing age, obesity and chronic disease, are
also risk factors for zinc deficiency.5 32 35 Observational studies conducted in Germany, Spain, Japan
and Iran have reported that lower baseline zinc levels in hospitalised adults were associated with a
higher risk of mortality, severe illness, complications, and longer hospital stay following SARS-CoV-2
infection.33 36-38
In early 2020, the World Naturopathic Federation responded to a World Health Organization
initiative by calling for rapid evidence reviews to inform self-care and clinical practice during the
covid-19 pandemic. We published a rapid review protocol to evaluate zinc for the prevention and
treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs).39 40 The aim was to assess
the effects of zinc on the incidence, duration and severity of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections in people
of any age or zinc status, and to include the best available evidence. Indirect evidence was sought as
the risk of other viral RTIs remains relevant during the pandemic, zinc is often self-prescribed or
recommended prior to knowing the cause, and systematic reviews of zinc for non-specific RTIs were
either outdated, limited by population or administration route, or low quality.41-48 Ongoing
uncertainty makes it difficult to make informed decisions, either for or against the use of zinc for
SARS-CoV-2 or other viral RTIs in populations who are not zinc deficient.5 27

The scope of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving people of any age, published in English or
Chinese, along with the details of four RCT protocols evaluating the efficacy of zinc to prevent or
treat SARS-CoV-2 infections in adults were reported in August 2020.5 Of the 118 RCTs with indirect
evidence, the 25 RCTs that included adult populations were prioritised for analysis, as this was an a
priori subgroup population with a higher risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
This rapid review presents an updated search and meta-analysis of the RCTs investigating any type of
zinc intervention to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 or other viral RTI in adult populations.

METHODS
Protocol
This rapid review (RR) conforms with the Interim Guidance from the Cochrane Rapid Reviews
Methods Group,2 the Cochrane Handbook,49 and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).50 The protocol is registered with the International Prospective
Register of Systematic Reviews, number CRD42020182044.39 Following feedback from content
experts, the protocol was updated.40 The inclusion criteria was expanded from only including
respiratory infection likely to be caused by a coronavirus to those caused by any virus, the exclusion
criteria was tightened so that included studies only included respiratory illnesses mostly caused by
viral infections, and the planned database search was expanded. Post-protocol input from
consumer/patient advocate representatives who were blinded to the results, led to minor changes
to the outcomes and the rating of their importance (Table 1). The other post-protocol changes were
the decisions to stagger the analysis and periodically update the review for direct SARS-CoV-2
evidence.

Search strategy
The search strategy was developed in collaboration with an experienced research librarian (JB).
Subject headings and keywords were developed for coronaviruses, viral respiratory illnesses, zinc,
and randomised controlled trials in humans. The following databases were searched with no limits
on language nor date: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Academic Search Complete, Allied and
Complementary Medicine Database, Alt Health Watch, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Health Source,
PsycINFO, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI), medRxiv, bioRxiv, U.S. National
Library of Medicine Register of Clinical Trials (ClinicalTrials.gov), International Standard Randomized
Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN), World Health Organization International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), Global Coronavirus covid-19 Clinical Trial Tracker and Chinese

Clinical Trial Registry. Database searches were conducted between 29 April and 15 August 2020 and
supplemented by bibliography searches of included articles (Appendix 1 – available upon request).

Study selection criteria
Study design
Included were randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials. Excluded were systematic
reviews, non-randomised studies of interventions, and studies without a concurrent control.
Population
Direct evidence from adults in any setting who were at risk of, or had a laboratory confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection. In anticipation of the likely dearth of direct evidence so early in the pandemic,
indirect evidence from other viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs) were included due to zinc’s
known mechanisms of action,5 and in response to calls for the best available evidence, even if
indirect, to inform clinical decisions and research. As such, laboratory confirmed RTIs and nonspecific respiratory tract illness predominantly caused by a viral infection, such as the common cold,
non-seasonal rhino-sinusitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, flu-like illness and healthy adults with acute
bronchitis were included. Excluded were non-specific bronchitis in adults with concurrent chronic
lung diseases, pneumonia, otitis and acute or chronic respiratory distress/failure. Studies with
eligible and ineligible participants were included (e.g. adults or participants with viral RTIs) and when
possible, only the data for the eligible population was extracted.
Interventions and comparators
Included were interventions of any zinc conjugates, dose, duration, and administration route.
Excluded were co-interventions, including other nutraceuticals, herbs, or pharmaceuticals unless
both the intervention and control groups received the co-intervention. All types of controls and
comparator groups were included.
Outcomes
Critical and important outcomes were informed by core outcome sets,51-54 and a withdrawn
Cochrane protocol for zinc for the common cold,55and prioritised based on their importance to
patients and healthcare practitioners (Table 1). Studies were included regardless of the outcomes
reported and whether these were primary or secondary outcomes. Outcomes not of interest were
noted but not analysed.

Data collection and appraisal
In line with recommended RR methods,2 the first 30 title-abstracts and 5 full-papers were jointly
screened for calibration and consistency, the remaining were screened by single, experienced
reviewers. A high threshold for exclusion was applied and all studies excluded at full-paper screen
were rescreened by a second reviewer. Following calibration, a single reviewer extracted the data
and appraised the risk of bias that was verified by second reviewer. The exceptions were articles
published in Chinese where screening, data extraction and risk of bias appraisal were conducted by a
single reviewer and discussed with the other reviewers. Other review constraints included not
contacting study authors for further information.
Study design and funding, participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes measures, effect size
and direction were extracted into a piloted electronic spreadsheet. Data from graphical reports were
extracted with WebPlotDigitizer Version 4.257 with any rounding of decimal places and whole person
estimates favouring the null hypothesis.
Quality was appraised with the revised Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool (Rob-2).58 RCTs published prior
to 2002 were not penalised for not publishing a protocol. Rapid review constraints included only
appraising the outcomes that were meta-analysed. If no outcomes were analysed, the study’s
primary outcome was appraised. Only one reviewer appraised an outcome according to a prepiloted rubric. A seconder reviewer verified the appraisal with disagreements resolved through
consensus.

Evidence synthesis and statistical methods
The effect measures for dichotomous outcomes were risk ratios, calculated using the MantelHaenszel method. Events measured over different timeframes were calculated and reported as the
incidence rate per person-months, from which rate ratios and rate differences were estimated using
an inverse variance method. Studies reporting separate counts for different types of viral RTIs (e.g.
common cold, bronchitis, flu-like illness) were combined to calculate the total number of RTIs. When
no RTIs were reported in one study arm, 0.5 was recorded to facilitate analysis. For continuous data,
either the weighted or standardised mean differences were calculated using an inverse variance
method. Mean symptom severity scores were transformed to a modified Jackson common cold
scale.59 For time-to-event data, hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using an O-E and variance
method. Data extracted from survival curves was imputed for the first seven days using the direct
method 10 in the 'HR calculations spreadsheet' published by Tierney et al.60 For the purpose of

estimating an absolute effect from zinc use, the probability of remaining symptomatic on day-7 was
set at 33% for the placebo and active control comparators.56
Review constraints for non-SARS-CoV-2 RCTs included not imputing missing data for any outcome,
not imputing means or standard deviation (SD) for non-critical outcomes, and not contacting the
authors. Instead, additional information from previous systematic reviews was used.41-43
Due to the large number of RCTs that assessed symptom severity yet could not be included in the
meta-analyses, a basic count of the number of studies reporting significant and non-significant
findings were narrated to provide further context.
RevMan 5.4,61 R software,62 Microsoft Excel, and GRADEpro GDT63 were used for the statistical
analyses. Clinical and methodological diversity and statistical heterogeneity were considered prior to
pooling two or more studies reporting a measure of effect.64 The random-effects model was used
due to clinical and methodological diversity across the included studies. Statistical heterogeneity was
assessed using the I² statistic and homogeneity assessed with the chi² test.
A priori subgroup analyses were conducted for different ages groups, causes and severity of RTIs and
zinc interventions. Zinc doses were converted to milligrams (mg) of elemental zinc per day. To
investigate potential dose effects of oral or sublingual zinc, the chi² test comparing three categories
(<50mg daily, 50-200mg daily, >200mg daily) was used for dichotomous and time-to-event data. The
categories were based on a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 50mg and a higher risk of
more severe adverse effects, such as vomiting, with doses above 225mg.30
The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was
used to rate the certainty of the estimated effects and reported in Summary of Findings (SoF)
tables.65 Certainty was downgraded for indirectness by one level for SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and
other coronaviruses, and two levels for non-specific RTIs and other viral infections. Sensitivity
analyses investigated the point estimate change of significant results when studies with a higher RoB
or statistical outliers were removed, according to maximum days symptomatic prior to study
enrolment or different definitions of symptomatic recovery, and when an alternate method 11 was
used instead of method 1060 to impute the hazard ratios for individual studies. These sub-group and
sensitivity analyses were used to assess the degree to which statistical heterogeneity might be
explained by clinical or methodological diversity. When rating imprecision, the optimal information

size of effect estimates was based on single-study sample size calculations of included studies, or a
conventional 2-sided or equivalence sample size calculation, with an 80% power and a type 1 error
rate of 5%. When data from at least 10 studies were pooled, funnel plots were created, visually
inspected for publication bias and statistically analysed using Egger’s regression for continuous
outcomes and the Harbord score for dichotomous outcomes.66
The minimally important difference (MID) in symptom severity for mild RTIs on day-3 was set at 1
point on a standardized scale (Appendix 4 – available upon request). This was the half-way mark
between two proposed MIDs. Turner et al.67 proposed a 10% improvement for mild RTIs. Based on
the pooled mean scores for the control arms on day-3, a MID would be 0.5 points. Norman et al.68
proposed that for populations with at least moderately impaired quality of life scores, the MID is
approximately half the pooled standard deviation (SD) from the control arms, which for day-3
symptom severity would be 1.5 points. For standardised mean differences (SMD) the MID was set at
0.5 and a large effect size was 0.8.69 For duration of illness, a MID was at least twice as many
participants recovering70 or one day shorter duration.67

Patient and public involvement
The protocol was rapidly developed and published prior to patient advocate involvement.
Experienced patient advocates based in Australia have since provided input, including blinded
feedback on the importance of the outcome measures, and provided feedback on the presentation
of the results and discussion. Ongoing involvement will include translating the review findings for
consumers.

The characteristics of included studies are summarised in Table 2. Most were single-centre, 2-arm
RCTs and were conducted in the United States (US). None of the RCTs included participants at risk of,
or with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Twenty RCTs evaluated zinc for community acquired infections that
were mild to moderate severity.67 70 75-93 Six RCTs inoculated participants with a human rhinovirus
strain (HRV 2, 13, 23 or 39).67 72-74 Two RCTs only assessed tolerability and adverse effects of a zinc
lozenge designed to prevent or treat RTI.71 72
Most participants were younger than 65 years, with no SARS-CoV-2 risk factors (Table 2). However,
two RCTs included older adults from different ethnic backgrounds, many of whom had chronic
disease comorbidities and were taking long-term medication.71 89 In another RCT, around one third
of participants had a history of asthma.70
The most common zinc formulations were lozenges followed by nasal sprays and gels containing
either zinc acetate or gluconate salts (Table 2). The daily dose of elemental zinc from sublingual
lozenges and oral capsules ranged from 15mg up to 300mg, whereas the doses for topical nasal
applications were substantially lower (0.9-2.6 mg/day). Twenty-five RCTs compared zinc against a
placebo that was often matched or partially matched. Two 4-arm RCTs described the control lozenge
as a placebo,74 however, they were re-classified as an active comparator because they contained
quinine hydrochloride that has broad-spectrum antiviral effects.94 Two RCTs permitted the
concurrent use of paracetamol for temperature control and other cold medications for symptomatic
relief.76 83 The use of breakthrough medication was reported and applied to all study participants.
All but two RCTs71 72 reported at least one result that was used in a meta-analysis of a critical or
important outcome. None of the RCTs reported mortality nor quality of life outcomes. The details of
the meta-analyses, subgroup and sensitivity analyses, funnel plots, and any additional calculations
used for the analysis can be found in Appendix 4 – available upon request.
The certainty of the evidence for all outcome measures was downgraded for SARS-CoV-2
indirectness (Table 3). A high risk of bias for some outcomes, inconsistency, and imprecision
additionally undermined confidence. Concerns about the risk of bias included probable unmasking
due to the challenges with matching the placebo and higher rates of adverse effects from zinc
formulations such as nausea, taste changes and mouth or nasal irritation that could influence
participant reported outcomes (Figure 2 and Appendix 3 – available upon request). For symptom
severity, insufficient reporting on missing responses to the daily questionnaire amplified other
concerns about missing outcome data. Substantial heterogeneity lead to both measures of effect for

duration of illness being downgraded. At least 11 RCTs were industry funded, with a further seven
receiving partial industry support (Appendix 3 – available upon request). There was no obvious
evidence of publication bias (Appendix 4 – available upon request).

Zinc for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection

There were no data specific to SARS-CoV-2 nor other coronaviruses, consequently, confidence in all
estimated effects was downgraded to very low certainty (Table 3).

Community acquired infections
Prevention of community acquired viral RTIs was investigated in four RCTs that included 2,804
participants over a total of 3,565 person-months.88-91 Compared with placebo controls, zinc reduced
the risk of developing symptoms consistent with a mild to moderate RTI by 31% (Risk Ratio (RR) 0.69,
95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.80, very low certainty SARS-CoV-2, moderate certainty for
other RTIs) (Figure 3). The number needed to treat (NTT) to prevent an RTI was 20 adults using zinc
for one month (95% CI 11 to 100). The largest effect was an 88% reduction for moderately severe,
flu-like illnesses (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.37, very low certainty SARS-CoV-2, moderate certainty
other RTIs).89-91 However, due to the higher incidence of mild RTIs (e.g. common cold), even with a
lower risk reduction of 29% (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.80) the absolute effect was larger (Table 3).8891

Four mild RTIs (95% CI 7 to 1) might be prevented with 100 person-months of zinc use, compared

to one moderately severe RTI (95% CI 2 to 1). For the subgroup of older adults aged 55-87 years,
based on one RCT only (49 participants, 588 per-person months), the risk of RTIs was more than
halved (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.90, very low certainty SARS-CoV-2, low certainty other RTIs).89
Subgroup analysis found no significant differences according to zinc administration route or dose
(P=0.37) (Figure 3).
[INSERT FIGURE 3 – Prevention of RTIs and adverse effects]

Human rhinovirus inoculation
The effect of zinc compared to placebo for preventing RTIs symptoms following inoculation with
human rhinoviruses was evaluated in two RCTs that included 148 participants.72 74 Neither study
found a difference in the risk of infection nor in developing a clinical cold (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.69 to
1.60, very low certainty SARS-CoV-2 and other RTIs) (Figure 3).

Adverse effects
No serious adverse events were reported (very low certainty SARS-CoV-2, moderate certainty other
RTIs). Anosmia (loss of sense of smell) was not reported by the 1,447 participants who used a zinc
nasal spray nor the 1,354 participants who used a placebo spray for 1 month (very low certainty
SARS-CoV-2, moderate certainty other RTIs).90 91 Compared to placebo, no differences in copper

plasma concentration were found in the two smaller RCTs that evaluated 15mg of oral zinc for
younger adults over 7 months88 or 45mg for older adults over twelve months89 (very low certainty
SARS-CoV-2, low certainty other RTIs). Based on the pooled results of three RCTs that included 2,758
participants and 2,998 per person-months, there were no differences in the risk non-serious adverse
effects from zinc compared to placebo controls (RR: 1.56, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.34, very low certainty
SARS-CoV-2, low certainty other RTIs) (Figure 3).88 90 91
Zinc for treatment of SARS-CoV-2

There were no data specific to SARS-CoV-2 nor other specific coronaviruses, consequently,
confidence in all estimated effects was downgraded to very low certainty for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 3).

Symptom severity
Of the 23 RCTs that evaluated the effects of zinc on symptom severity for non-specific and other viral
RTIs,67 70 72-87 92 only seven reported results that could be extracted for a meta-analysis of an a priori
outcome (Figure 4).73-79
[INSERT FIGURE 4 – Symptom severity]
In five RCTs that included 392 participants, a clinically important reduction of more than 1 point in
the day-3 symptom severity scores for mild RTIs was found for zinc compared to placebo (mean
difference (MD) -1.21, 95% CI -1.74 to -0.66, very low certainty SARS-CoV-2, low certainty for other
RTIs).74-77 79 Subgroup analyses found no significant differences between zinc administered as a
topical nasal spray or gel compared to sublingual lozenges, nor were there any differences between
RTIs that were community acquired compared to those caused by rhinovirus inoculation.
Average daily symptom severity scores were no different for zinc compared to placebo controls
(standardized mean difference (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.13, very low certainty SARS-CoV-2, low
certainty other RTIs) in a pooled analyses of three RCTs, including a total of 195 participants.73 74 78
Similarly, the effect for zinc compared to placebo was unchanged by its administration route and by
the type of viral infection.
In two multicentre 4-arm RCTs, three different zinc lozenges were compared to an active control
containing quinine hydrochloride. In both RCTs, one with 272 participants who were inoculated with
human rhinovirus and the other with 279 participants who had a community acquired, non-specific

mild viral RTI, symptom severity was equivalent.67 Similarly, in another RCT that included 143
participants,92 symptom severity with zinc nasal spray use was equivalent to an active control nasal
spray containing naphazoline hydrochloride.
Of the remaining RCTs that evaluated the effects of zinc compared to placebo on symptom severity
according to various outcome measures, five RCTs including a total of 353 participants, reported
lower symptom severity from zinc,72 83-86 four RCTs that included 248 participants, reported no
differences between groups, 72 73 82 87 and three RCTs did not report their results.70 80 81

Duration of illness
Zinc was found to effectively reduce the duration of community acquired mild to moderately severe
RTIs in 14 RCTs that included 1,300 participants (Figure 5).70 75-87 The pooled results from 10 RCTs
that followed up 1023 participants for at least seven days,70 75-77 80-85 found that on any given day, the
risk of remaining symptomatic was 83% higher for placebo controls compared to zinc (HR 1.83, 95%
CI 1.07 to 3.13, very low certainty SARS-CoV-2 and other RTIs). The pooled results from 12 RCTs that
included 1,180 participants,75-79 81-87 found the duration of symptoms was reduced by an average of
two days with zinc compared to placebo controls (MD -2.03, 95% CI -3.50 to -0.59, very low certainty
SARS-CoV-2 and other RTIs), more than twice the minimally important difference of one day.
[INSERT FIGURE 5 – Duration of illness]
Results from the subgroup analyses that compared zinc salts, administration routes and zinc lozenge
doses were less consistent. A significant difference between the zinc salt subgroups was found for
mean duration (P=0.009) but not symptomatic risk (P=0.71). Similarly, a significant difference in the
subgroups according to daily zinc lozenge dose was found for mean duration (P=0.002) but not
symptomatic risk (P=0.27). No significant difference was found between the administration route
subgroups for either mean duration (P=0.60) or symptomatic risk (P=0.27). To further investigate
possible methodological explanations for the substantial heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were also
conducted according to the maximum number of days participants were symptomatic prior to
enrolment and different definitions of symptomatic survival, however, heterogeneity remained a
concern.
The pooled results from two multicentre 4-arm RCTs that included 551 participants, found zinc
lozenges were equivalent to an active control containing quinine (Figure 5). No differences were

SARS-CoV-2, moderate certainty other RTIs) from mild to moderately severe RTIs that were either
community acquired or caused by HRV inoculation nor the mean days duration of illness for
community acquired RTIs (MD -0.18 days, -0.93 to 0.56, very low certainty SARS-CoV-2, low certainty
for other RTIs).

Adverse effects
No serious adverse effects were reported in any of the RCTs that evaluated zinc for treating RTIs
(very low certainty SARS-CoV-2, moderate certainty for other RTIs). 67 70 73-86 92 The risks of nonserious adverse effects were 1.4 times more for zinc compared to placebo (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.17 to
1.69, very low certainty SARS-CoV-2, moderate certainty for other RTIs) in 11 RCTs including 1102
participants. 70 73 74 76 77 80-84 86 (Figure 6).The pooled results of three RCTs that included 979
participants that compared various zinc interventions and doses with active controls, found no
difference in the rates of non-serious adverse effects (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.53).67 92
[INSERT FIGURE 6 – Adverse effects from zinc used to treat RTIs]
Sixteen RCTs reported the incidence of individual adverse effect rates. Nausea or gastro-intestinal
discomfort was 1.3 times more likely with zinc compared to placebo (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.90)
found in 11 RCTs that included 957 participants. 70 73 75 77 79-81 84-87 Mouth irritation or soreness from
sublingual lozenges containing zinc, was 1.6 times more likely than placebo lozenges (RR 1.55, 95%
CI 1.05 to 2.29) in seven RCTs that included 505 participants.73 75 77 79 80 85 86 Sublingual lozenges were
more than twice as likely to cause taste aversion (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.04) compared to placebo
lozenges, in nine RCTs that included 719 participants.73 75 77 79 80 82 84 85 87 Zinc lozenges were more
likely than nasal sprays and gels to cause any non-serious adverse effect (P=0.02) and/or
gastrointestinal symptoms (P=0.04). Adverse effect incidence was inconsistent for comparisons of
different zinc doses and salts compared to placebo controls. Unlike the prevention studies, the
pooled results of three RCTs (328 participants) investigating zinc as a treatment,74 76 83 found no
difference in the rates of nasal irritation or pain from zinc topical nasal sprays or gels compared to
placebo controls (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.05).

DISCUSSION
Principle findings

This rapid review and meta-analysis considers the potential role of zinc in the prevention and
treatment of SARS-CoV-2, and advances the evidence on the effects of zinc for mild and moderate
RTIs in adults without zinc deficiencies.41-47 New evidence about the prophylactic effects of zinc
found that compared to placebo controls, zinc reduced the risk of developing symptoms that are
consistent with a non-specific viral RTI. This risk was substantially lower for moderately severe illness
compared to mild illness. When zinc was used to treat mild to moderate RTIs, there were clinically
important reductions in the symptom severity and duration, however, the higher rates of nonserious adverse effects from zinc may limit its acceptability for some people.
Confidence in the estimated effects of zinc for SARS-CoV-2 is very low, due to serious indirectness as
there were no data specific to SARS-CoV-2, nor other coronaviruses, and some concerns about bias
for most outcomes. From the perspective of the general population, the indirect evidence is still
relevant. The risk of other community acquired viral RTIs during the covid-19 pandemic remains
relevant, and zinc is likely to be self-prescribed either before or near the onset of symptoms prior to
knowing the cause.
Alongside potential benefits, consumers also seek detailed information about adverse effects and
tolerability. The review confirms that adverse stomach, mouth, and nasal symptoms are common,
particularly with doses above the NOEL of 40 to 50mg daily. No serious adverse effects were
reported, suggesting this risk is low. However, post marketing surveillance has identified cases of
long-lasting anosmia associated with a zinc gluconate nasal gel.98 99 It is unclear if the same risks
apply to nasal sprays. A loss of smell was not reported by any of the RCTs, including the 1,364 young
adults who used a zinc gluconate nasal spray twice daily for one month. As anosmia is an early SARSCoV-2 symptom, any use of topical nasal zinc formulations during the pandemic should be
considered and carefully monitored.100
Copper depletion is another potential risk, particularly with long-term zinc use,29 30 as might be the
case for people choosing to use zinc for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis. This risk is reflected in the
recommended upper limits of around 40 to 50mg daily.30 It was reassuring that plasma copper levels
were stable following 15mg of oral zinc for seven months88 and 45mg of oral zinc daily for 12
months.89 However, both RCTs were small and may be underpowered to detect a difference, only a
single marker of copper status was measured,29 and intestinal absorption of zinc is influenced by a

variety of factors including age, medication use, dietary phytates (found in whole grains, legumes,
nuts and seeds) and zinc status.5 32
Implications for SARS-CoV-2 research

The review findings align with calls for more immuno-nutrition research, particularly in populations
with a higher SARS-CoV-2 risk.32 35 Results from seven RCTs evaluating various zinc doses, salts, and
administration routes for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 are all pending. These RCTs will
continue to be tracked and the review periodically updated until there is moderate certainty in the
evidence or no further direct evidence is pending.
Future SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials should consider replicating the RCTs with positive results for other
viral RTIs and consider focusing on high risk groups. Based on the limited information reported in the
protocols, some of the choices for zinc interventions appear to be arbitrary. For instance, despite
sublingual and topical nasal zinc demonstrating effectiveness for other viral RTIs, none of the
registered SARS-CoV-2 trials plan to evaluate either administration route, and a relatively low dose
of oral zinc, 15mg daily for prevention and 20mg daily for treatment, will be evaluated in two other
RCTs despite neither dose demonstrating efficacy for other viral RTIs. Future studies could consider
evaluating higher doses of prophylactic oral zinc (45mg daily in a divided dose) for older adults and
people living in residential care, and low dose prophylactic zinc nasal spray for at risk younger adults,
such as healthcare workers and contacts of known SARS-CoV-2 cases. For short-term, acute
treatment of SARS-CoV-2, it would be reasonable to first investigate an oral or sublingual dose of at
least 50mg, or perhaps even 75mg daily,42 43 or include multiple zinc arms with different doses.
Regarding the choice of zinc salts to investigate, the largest body of evidence from other viral RTIs
comes from zinc gluconate and zinc acetate, suggesting these are both suitable choices. Trialists
should also ensure they classify zinc an active control and not an inert control.
The minimum time-frame in which zinc should be started following an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection
will also need to be investigated. Most of the RCTs included in this review commenced zinc within 24
hours from the onset of symptoms. Yet, in the post-hoc subgroup analyses we conducted to
evaluate methodological diversity the duration of illness was also reduced in the subset of RCTs in
which participants commenced zinc up to three days from the onset of symptoms. Further, in a
preliminary analysis for one of the included RCTs, the investigators briefly report that the significant
reduction in the duration of symptoms remained when a large number of participants with
symptoms of up to 10 days duration were added.77 Similarly, in an case series of four consecutive

adults with probable or laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who took high dose zinc lozenges
(115 – 207mg daily) as outpatients, only one person commenced zinc within 24 hours from the onset
of symptoms. The other three commenced zinc five, nine and 21 days later. Noticeable clinical
improvements over the next 24 hours were observed in all four cases.20 These findings suggest zinc
could be beneficial even when it is commenced later in the course of an illness. SARS-CoV-2 studies
will need to investigate if the duration of symptoms prior to commencing zinc impacts effectiveness.
Clues regarding timing and dose of zinc can be gleaned from a retrospective, open-label
observational study of adults hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2.17 The study observed that a daily zinc
dose of 100mg (zinc sulphate capsules, 220Gmg twice daily for 5Gdays), as an adjuvant to
hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was associated with a decrease in mortality and hospice care.
This association was strongest for adults who were not admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
Since patients in ICU are experiencing more severe cytokine storms, the investigators postulate that
zinc’s mechanism of action may be predominantly antiviral rather than anti-inflammatory. However,
neither the duration of symptoms nor baseline zinc status were reported, nor were they included as
explanatory variables. It should be considered that critically ill adults may have had a lower zinc
status or required a higher zinc dose or perhaps a different administration route (e.g. intravenous).
Along with investigating the potential effectiveness of various doses, formulations and
administration options, SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials should also determine if zinc requires a carrier or
an ionophore, such as hydroxychloroquine,16 and compare the risks and benefits. According to our
review findings and preliminary in vitro SARS-CoV-2 research,33 it is plausible that zinc may be
effective when used on its own.
Finally, except for one RCT that evaluated the effects of zinc on cognitive function,72 93 the
symptomatic and functional impact on the participants’ quality of life (QoL) was not assessed. Given
the importance of these outcomes to patients, patient-reported outcomes measures such as the
Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24) that assess both symptom severity and
quality of life are recommended.101
Strengths and limitations of this review

Consultation with consumer advocates helped focus this review on issues that matter to patients
and affirmed the relevance of indirect evidence. Notwithstanding, the indirectness to SARS-CoV-2 is
a major limitation that constrained the overall certainty of the evidence. The only direct evidence

that we are aware of comes from non-randomised studies of interventions.8 16-19 However, including
these studied would not have changed the conclusions. The certainty of the evidence would have
remained very low for all outcomes.
Other limitations to the certainty of the evidence included serious concerns about the inconsistency
of the estimates of effect for duration. Wide variations in the methodology, zinc interventions,
demographics of the study participants, and changes in the seasonal epidemiology of viral RTIs are
all likely to have contributed to this heterogeneity. We were more cautious than previous
reviewers,45 46 and downgraded the certainty of the evidence by two levels for inconsistency. A high
risk of bias for most of the RCT outcomes was another concern. Except for adverse effects, many RCT
outcomes has at least some concerns. Reassuringly, the estimates of effects for all critical outcomes
were robust following removal of RCTs with a high risk of bias. Nevertheless, were more cautious
than previous reviewers,42-46 and downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to risk of bias by one
level for all prevention, duration and severity outcomes.
Limitations of the rapid review methods included single reviewers conducting many of the tasks.
This may have increased errors and inconsistencies. Strategies to minimise these risks included
calibrating the reviewers prior to conducting single tasks, applying a high threshold for exclusion
when screening articles, and a second reviewer verifying data extraction and appraisal. Other errors
may have arisen from using second-hand information reported in other systematic reviews to
augment the analysis of non-critical outcomes and subgroup analyses.41-43 As this review is the first
to analyse hazard ratios, including this data meant the pooled results could be compared to the
alternate effect measure, mean days duration.
Rapid review limitations were counterbalanced by not restricting the search strategy and including
adults with viral RTIs following HRV inoculation that led to substantially more studies being included
compared to previous reviews.41-47 Notably, a concurrent systematic review published in 2020 only
included 1 of the 6 prevention RCTs and 9 of the 23 treatment RCTs.46 This in part was due to the
reviewers only searching four databases and affirms the importance of carefully considering which
review methods to restrict.102
The decision to use the RoB-2 tool increased the workload, as RCTs with multiple outcomes were
appraised more than once. Hence, only the outcomes included in a meta-analysis were appraised.
The trade-off of appraising bias at the outcome level rather than study level was the improved

specificity and relevance of RoB-2 to zinc interventions. For example, missing responses to
questionnaire items were more likely to bias symptoms severity score than symptom duration. The
signalling questions for Domain 2: Deviations from Intended Interventions, helped highlight bias
arising from contamination of the intervention, a notable challenge in the evaluation of nutritional
(dietary) interventions.
Flexibility in the rapid review protocol enabled a staged meta-analysis and more timely reporting of
priority conditions, populations, and outcomes. The 95 shortlisted RCTs evaluating zinc for the
prevention or treatment of viral RTIs in children are yet to be analysed, and will add to the findings
of the 2016 Cochrane review that included six RCTs evaluating zinc supplementation for the
prevention of pneumonia in children aged from 2 months to 59 months.48 In contrast to the RCTs of
adult populations, most RCTs evaluated zinc use in populations with a moderate or high risk of zinc
deficiency, and around one third were prevention studies.
CONCLUSIONS

This rapid review of RCTs confirms that zinc is a potential therapeutic candidate for preventing and
treating SARS-CoV-2, including high risk groups and adults without zinc deficiency. The seven trials
currently in progress, will provide important direct evidence for SARS-CoV-2. Pending these results,
the indirect evidence from this review points towards zinc being a viable alternative to other
unproven pharmaceutical options. Trials comparing standard care to zinc alone and as an adjuvant
to other interventions are both warranted. The choice of zinc interventions to investigate should be
guided by the findings of this review. Along with clinical outcomes, quality of life and adverse effects
should be assessed. Additional information about the relative availability, acceptability and costs of
therapeutic options will also be needed.
