Abstract
Background: Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to rage
worldwide, clinical and laboratory studies of this disease have been limited in many countries.
We investigated the epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory findings of COVID-19 infected
patients to identify the effective indicators correlated with the disease.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted at King Abdullah Hospital in Bisha Province,
Saudi Arabia, from March 20 to June 30, 2020. Patients of different age groups were confirmed
as having COVID-19 infection using a real-time polymerase chain reaction. The demographic,
clinical, and laboratory data of the patients were statistically analyzed.
Results: Of the 137 patients, 88 were male and 49 were female, with a mean age of 49.3 years
(SD±18.4). The patients were elderly (n=29), adults (n=103), and children (n=5). Of these, 54
(39.4%) had comorbidities, 24% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 12 (8.8%)
died. On admission, the main clinical manifestations were fever (82.5%), cough (63.5%),
shortness of breath (24.8%), chest pain (19.7%), and fatigue (18.2%).
In all patients, increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes were observed. Patients’ lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated. C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in 46.7%, D-dimer
in 41.6%, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in 39.4% of patients. The elderly showed
higher neutrophil (p=0.003) and lower lymphocyte (p=0.001) counts than adults and children.
Glucose, creatine kinase-MB, LDH, bilirubin, D-dimer, and ESR were significantly higher in the
elderly than in the adults. The COVID-19 death group had a higher leucocyte count (p = 0.043),

and higher urea (p=0.025) and potassium (p=0.026) than the recovered group but had a lower
hemoglobin concentration (p=0.018). A significant association was determined between COVID19 death (χ2(1)=17.751, p<0.001), and the presence of cardiovascular disease (χ2(1)=17.049,
p<0.001), hypertension (χ2(1)=7.659, p=0.006), renal failure (χ2(1)=4.172, p<0.04), old age
(t(135) = 4.747, p <0.001), and ICU admission (χ2(1) = 17.751 (1), p<0.001).
Conclusions: The common symptoms found in this study could be useful for identifying
potential COVID-19 patients. Investigating some of the laboratory and clinical parameters could
help assess the disease progression, risk of mortality, and follow up patients who could progress
to a fatal condition.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus designated as 2019-nCoV is a human pathogen discovered in China at the
end of 2019 during an outbreak of endemic pneumonia of unknown etiology [1,2].The World
Health Organization (WHO) named this new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and the disease
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2]. The disease continues to spread in more than 200
countries worldwide, with a high rate of infection and mortality, creating a significant dilemma
for global health [1,3].
The COVID-19 infection is represented by a spectrum of clinical severity. From no symptoms or
mild upper respiratory tract symptoms [4–6], the disease can develop to severe pneumonia
characterized by fever, cough, fatigue, dyspnea, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and acute
respiratory injury[4]. The clinical characteristics and severity of COVID-19 have been described
as similar to other coronaviruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [3]. Patients with severe illness can develop acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which requires extended care in an intensive care unit
[6,7] Recent studies have confirmed that critically ill patients develop severe complications such
as septic shock, severe metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, arrhythmias, and
multiple organ dysfunction syndrome[5,8,9].

In Saudi Arabia, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded on March 2, 2020, and the
number of discovered cases is increasing [10]. By September 27, 2020, the Saudi Ministry of
Health had reported a cumulative total of 332,790 cases and 4,655 deaths confirmed in Saudi
Arabia [11]. Such a large number of cases highlights the importance of analyzing the
characteristics of patients confirmed to have the disease[3]. Recent studies have noted that the
clinical and laboratory features of the disease are variable between populations because of their
distinct demographic features, comorbidities, and immune system responses [8,12]. However,
testing the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory elements correlated with COVID-19
infections is important for determining high-risk groups, mapping the disease, and designing
appropriate management [8]. To date, multiple studies have described the disease among various
population groups, but these have been mainly in China [4,7,12,13]. Published data concerning
the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings of the disease in Saudi Arabia are limited
[3,8,14]. This study investigated the potential role of the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory
findings of COVID-19 infected patients of different ages to identify the effective indicators
associated with the disease.
Methodology
Study design and setting
A retrospective single-center study was conducted at King Abdullah Hospital (KAH), Bisha
Province, Saudi Arabia. This hospital is a referral hospital with nearly 400 beds. It covers various
specialties, thus serving various patient groups and most of the population in different areas in
Bisha Province and surrounding villages[15]. KAH is the only hospital that admits COVID-19
patients in Bisha Province and the surrounding rural areas.

Patients having COVID-19 infection who were admitted to KAH between March 20 and June
30, 2020 were enrolled in this study. We categorized patients into three groups, namely children
(1 to 14 years), adults (15 to 64 years), and elderly (65 years or older). Patients who were less
than 1 year old were excluded from the study due to insufficient clinical and laboratory data. All
patients were confirmed as having the virus by positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid results using a
real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay on nasopharyngeal
swab specimens. The RT-PCR test for COVID-19 was carried out at the Aseer Regional
Hospital, Aseer region, Saudi Arabia, and the test results were available online within 24 h.
Collection of clinical and laboratory data
Data on the demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings were
obtained from patients' medical records and local health authorities, and were entered into data
collection form on admission. We also collected laboratory test results, including results for
complete blood count, glucose levels, coagulation tests, D-dimer levels, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR), renal and liver function tests, electrolytes, C-reactive protein (CRP),
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), and CK-MB.
Ethical clearance
This study was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Local Committee at the College
of Medicine, University of Bisha (UBCOM/ H-06-BH-087 (05/03)). The data were collected in
an anonymous format, without violating the personal privacy of the patients. The study was
carried out as part of the response by the University of Bisha to investigate the COVID-19
outbreak.

Statistical analysis
Data were entered and analyzed using the software Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS
version 22) (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Descriptive statistics were calculated to present the
baseline demographic data and clinical symptoms in terms of proportion and frequency.
Normally distributed continuous data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and
were compared using independent group t-tests. Non-normal distributed continuous variables
were examined by the Mann–Whitney U test and expressed as the median and interquartile
ranges (IQR). Non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis rank sum was applied for pairwise and multiple
comparisons between the groups, and was presented as the median and IQR. Categorical
variables were compared using the chi-squared test and displayed as numbers and proportions.
All p-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
One hundred thirty-seven confirmed cases of COVID-19 were admitted to the King Abdullah
Hospital during the period from March 18, 2020, to June 30, 2020. The average length of a
hospital stay was four days (IQR, 3–7 days). The total number of admitted cases per month was
six in March and four in April, which increased 31 in May and 96 in June. Of the137 patients, 88
(64.2%) were male and 49 (35.8%) were female, with a mean age of 49.3 years (SD ±18.4).
Most of the patients were adults (75.2%), followed by the elderly (21.2%), and children (3.6%).
Most of the patients (73.7%) were Saudi. One hundred and seven patients (78.1%) had direct
contact with infected individuals, and 30 (21.9%) had a history of travel outside the country.
Clinical presentation
Table 1 outlines the main clinical manifestations associated with the disease. On admission, the
most common clinical manifestation was fever (82.5%), followed by cough (63.5%), shortness of

breath (24.8%), chest pain (19.7%), and fatigue (18.2). Fifty-four (39.4%) of the patients had
chronic disease, including diabetes mellitus, renal failure, hypertension, liver disease,
cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease. Thirty-four (24%) of the cases were admitted to
the ICU. The mortality rate of the admitted cases was 8.8% (12/137).

Laboratory results
The results of the laboratory parameters obtained at the time of patient admission are displayed
in Table 2. The complete blood count results of all patients were recorded as average values, and
showed slightly increased neutrophil and decreased lymphocyte counts. Overall, the average
blood biochemistry parameters were normal, but elevated levels were detected for LDH (276
UL, normal values = 81–234). Regarding the inflammatory biomarkers, CRP was increased in
46.7% of the patients; D-dimer was elevated in 41.6% of the patients, and ESR was increased in
39.4% of patients.

Comparison of laboratory parameters by age group
Table 2 compares the laboratory findings of the three age groups of children, adults, and the
elderly. Neutrophil counts were significantly higher in the elderly group (median = 73.1, IQR
[67.6–81.8]) than in adults (median = 66.5, IQR [59–76.1]) or children (median = 56, IQR [50–
60.9]) groups. Lymphocytes were significantly higher in the children (median = 35, IQR [29.4–

40]) than in the adult (median = 23.9, IQR [16.6–30.3]) or elderly groups (median = 19.6, IQR
[14.15–23.05]). Platelet counts were significantly lower in the elderly than in adult patients (p =
0.014). There were no significant differences in other blood count parameters between the three
age groups.
In terms of blood biochemistry results, glucose, CK-MB, LDH, and bilirubin were significantly
higher in the elderly than in the adults (Table 2). Significant differences (p <0.001) in creatinine
levels were determined between the three groups, with the highest level in the elderly group
(median = 103, IQR [80–139.5]), followed by adults (median = 77, [IQR, 67–98]) and children
(median = 46, IQR [36.8–64]). There were no significant differences in alanine transaminase
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin, CK, and potassium levels among the three
groups (Table 2).

As shown in Table 2, the number of patients with increased D-dimer and ESR was significantly
higher in the elderly group compared with the adult group ([D-dimer: 65.6% vs. 36.9; p = 0.006],
[ESR: 62.1% vs. 35%; p = 0.009). The number of patients with increased CRP levels did not
significantly differ between the elderly and adult groups (58.6% vs. 45.6%; p = 0.216).

Factors associated with COVID-19 death
In Table 3, the analysis of several factors in relation to COVID-19 death is shown. There was a

be infected by the disease than women (n = 49).

Laboratory findings associated with COVID-19 death
Compared with the recovered group, the COVID-19 death group had significantly higher total
leucocyte count (median = 8.78, IQR [5.73–13.50] vs. (median = 6.39, IQR [4.7–8.45]; p =
0.043), urea (median = 7.05, IQR [3.90–12.93] vs. median = 4.5, IQR [3.3–5.7]; p = 0.025), and
potassium (median = 4.5, IQR [3.96–4.90] vs. median = 3.98, IQR [3.68–4.3]; p = 0.026). In
contrast, decreased levels of hemoglobin (median = 11.75, IQR [10.90–13.20] vs. (median =
13.7, IQR [11.9–15.15]; p = 0.018) were reported in the COVID-19 death group compared with
the recovered group. There were no statistical differences in the results of other tested laboratory
parameters between the recovered and death groups (Table 4).

Discussion
In this study, we described the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and laboratory parameters
of 137 confirmed patients with COVID-19 in Bisha, Saudi Arabia. We found that COVID-19
frequently infected the middle-aged group. This is in agreement with previous reports that
showed the middle-aged, from 40 to 60 years, were the most commonly infected group [16–19].
However, the virus can infect individuals of all age groups[17,18] The study reported a greater
number of men than women as having the infection, which is similar to the findings of other
studies [19–21]. A study conducted among 56 elderly patients found that more men than women

were infected by 2019-nCoV [13]. A singlearm metaanalysis showed that the men made up a
larger percentage of the gender distribution of COVID19 patients at 60% (95% CI [0.54,
0.65])[20]. Previous studies have documented more men than women to be infected with other
coronavirus infections, such as in SARS-CoV[22] and MERS-CoV[23]. The decrease in
women’s susceptibility to coronavirus infections could be attributed to sex hormones and an X
chromosome, which play an essential role in innate and adaptive immunity[19,20]
Our findings revealed that fever, cough, and shortness of breath were the most frequent
symptoms in COVID-19 patients, which is in agreement with many previous studies [13,24–26].
Research evidence suggests that the disease's complete clinical characteristics are nonspecific
and are not yet clear, as the associated symptoms range from mild to severe, with several cases
resulting in death[11,27] However, it is unclear whether the viral load affects the clinical
presentation [18]. It is well known that the clinical manifestations in symptomatic patients begin
to present with mild symptoms in less than 1 week, and that patients tend to recover within 1
week[14,27] Some patients may progress to severe disease with dyspnea, which may be
accompanied by pneumonia in the second or third weeks of the disease [9,27,28]. Severe cases
have been found to develop to progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage from the
virus, leading to death [14,27].
Regarding the hematological parameters, an estimation of white blood counts is essential to
predicting the outcomes of COVID-19 infection[8]. We found normal leucocyte counts in our
results, with a decreased level of lymphocytes and an upper limit of neutrophil counts. Similarly,
Jin et al. showed that in the early stage of the disease, the total number of leucocytes in
peripheral blood was normal or decreased, and the lymphocyte count was decreased [26]. Recent
reports have also found increased neutrophil counts and decreased lymphocyte counts associated

with COVID-19 [29,30] Lymphocytopenia could explain the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on T
lymphocytes, mainly on CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, resulting in a decrease in lymphocyte
numbers and IFN-γ production[19,30]. It is well known that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through the
respiratory mucosa and invades other cells, induces a series of immune responses, and causes
changes in peripheral white blood cells, including lymphocytes [19]. Studies suggest that a
substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronaviruses disrupt
many immune cells and suppress cellular immune function [31,32].
In comparing hematological findings, we detected significantly higher neutrophil levels among
elderly patients compared with adult or child patients. Similar findings have been reported by
others, where older patients with COVID-19 infections have shown high neutrophil counts and
decreased lymphocytes[13,29] The elevated neutrophil counts in this study could be explained
by the fact that elderly 2019-nCoV infected patients are more susceptible to bacterial
infection[13,25]. This study also found that lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in
elderly than in adult and child patients. In a retrospective study compared the clinical features of
COVID-19 in elderly patients with young and middle-aged patients, Liu et al. found that the
proportion of lymphocytes in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young
and middle-aged group (p < 0.001)[13]. The changes in the muscles that aid respiration, and the
anatomical changes in the lungs associated with an older age may lead to physiological changes
in the respiratory system, poor airway clearance and reduced lung reserve, and defense barrier
mechanisms[33].
In terms of blood biochemical findings, we also found that glucose, creatinine, and urea were
significantly higher in older patients with COVID-19 infection than in adults or children. In
contrast, studies have shown that there was no significant difference in serum creatinine when

the elderly were compared with young and middle-aged patients [13]. We showed that 40% of
the patients had various comorbid conditions, which might have explained the increased
creatinine and glucose levels in the older adults in this study. Likewise, a recent study indicated
that COVID-19 patients with severe conditions had high blood urea and creatinine levels, and
that their lymphocyte counts continued to decrease [25]. In our results, the LDH level was
elevated in all age groups, and indicated an adverse clinical outcome. Elevated LDH has been
found to be an independent risk factor for severe/critical COVID-19 in patients [7]. Research
data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may damage liver and myocardium tissues, lead to elevated
levels of AST, CK, and myoglobin to various degrees, and increased troponin in critical patients
[9]. Tsui et al. showed that LDH levels reflect tissue necrosis related to immune hyperactivity in
SARS, and thus relate to poor outcome [34]. Therefore, the monitoring of LDH levels and other
cardiac and liver enzymes could help predict severe COVID-19 in patients [12].
Determining the levels of D-dimer, CRP, ESR, and other inflammatory biomarkers is essential to
detecting bacterial infection in the lungs, and may help preliminarily evaluate patients' immune
status [26]. We found that most COVID-19 patients had elevated ESR rates, and over 40% of the
patients presented increased CRP and D-dimer levels. Likewise, studies have documented that an
increased D-dimer concentration is a common feature of COVID-19 infections, especially for
severe patients [9,25,26]. However, the elderly are more likely to develop a severe disease [21].
Our findings revealed significantly higher levels of ESR and D-dimer in the elderly than in the
adult group, while there were no significant differences in CRP levels between the two groups. A
recent study found that the CRP level in elderly patients was significantly higher than that in
young and middle-aged groups [13].

Our findings revealed that many patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 were older men and had
chronic underlying diseases. We found that diabetes mellitus, renal failure and hypertension were
present in 27.0%, 13.9% and 10% of the cases, respectively. This is in agreement with a previous
report, in which COVID-19 patients were reported to have comorbid conditions [4,19]. In
addition, research data show that patients ≥60 years old are at higher risk than children, who are
less likely to have an infection, or who show mild to asymptomatic infection [28]. The increased
risk of developing severe COVID-19 complications in older people with comorbid conditions
have been well documented in the literature [19]. In

multivariate analysis of 487 COVID-19

patients including 49 severe cases, Chi et al noted that elder age (OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.03–1.08],
p< 0.001), male (OR 3.68 [95% CI 1.75–7.75], p= 0.001), and presence of hypertension (OR
2.71 [95% CI 1.32–5.59], P=0.007) are independently associated with severe disease at
admission [4]. Chen et al. [19]suggested that 2019-nCoV is more likely to infect older adult men
with chronic comorbidities as a result of the weaker immune functions of these patients [19]. A
study indicated that COVID-19 infection progresses rapidly to acute respiratory distress
syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and leads to death in older
patients and those with comorbid conditions[25]. Therefore, identifying host risk factors
associated with severe COVID-19 infections may help in designing specific strategies to prevent
and treat the disease[4].
We found that 24% of the patients were admitted to the ICU. This proportion was much higher
than the 4.7% reported in a multi-center retrospective study that included 1519 cases from all
regions of Saudi Arabia[8]. The mortality rate of COVID-19 in our study was 8.8%, which was
higher than the 3.4 % reported in the literature [25]. The overall fatality rate of the disease as
found by others was in the range of 3% to 14%[35]. The high mortality rate and ICU admission

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.21.20217083; this version posted October 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

observed in this study could be explained by the fact that the study selected only confirmed cases
that were admitted to our hospital. Therefore, a further survey with a larger sample size could
show some differences. In comparing the death rate of COVID-19 with other coronaviruses, the
available data indicate that COVID-19 infection results in a lower mortality rate than that
reported for SARS (9.60%) and MERS (34.4%)[36]. Therefore, extensive studies of the
pathogenic and virulence mechanisms of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERSCoV are
needed to explain these variations.
We found that the mortality rate of COVID-19 infection was quite high among the elderly and
those admitted to the ICU, which resembled previous findings[13,29] However, patients in the
ICU were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation, surgical interventions, and prolonged
treatment, which might have increased the death rate[29]. In addition, the study also revealed
that hypertension, renal failure, and cardiovascular disease increased the risk of death in COVID19 cases. This agrees with previous reports, in which hypertension, coronary heart disease, and
diabetes were found to be risk factors that resulted in death[12,27,29,36]. Research evidence
indicates that the elderly and those with chronic underlying diseases develop severe and fatal
respiratory failure because of alveolar damage from the virus [17,19,21].
Limitations
Our study has several limitations: First, the sample size was relatively small, especially for the
children’s group, and may not fully reflect the characteristics of the disease for this group.
Therefore, a large sample size could give a more comprehensive understanding of 2019-nCoV.
Second, the study findings might have been biased by reporting only confirmed cases in a single
hospital center. Further studies that include suspected and undiagnosed cases may show some
differences. Third, we statistically analyzed the laboratory findings based on a comparison of

means, median, and proportions between different age groups that were not subdivided into
groups of patients with individual comorbid conditions. Finally, the study assessed the
epidemiological, laboratory, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 on admission of the
patients; more detailed information from other laboratory tests and clinical outcomes were
unavailable at the time of analysis.
Conclusions
In summary, this study revealed the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings of patients
of different age groups confirmed to have COVID-19. On admission, patients were most likely to
present with mild symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Increased LDH,
CRP, ESR, and D-dimer levels were common laboratory findings on patient admission.
However, glucose, CK-MB, LDH, bilirubin, D-dimer, and ESR levels were significantly higher
in the elderly than in adult patients. We found an increased disease mortality rate, which may be
attributed to the high percentage of patients with various comorbidities. This study revealed that
older age, ICU admission, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and renal failure were risk
factors for death. Increased levels of leucocytes, potassium, and urea, and decreased hemoglobin
concentration were frequent laboratory findings associated with death. The common symptoms
found in this study may help in identifying potential severe COVID-19 patients. Moreover, some
routine laboratory findings could help assess disease progression and manage patients who could
develop critical conditions and be at risk of mortality. These findings should be confirmed in
future studies coupled with testing other suitable clinical and laboratory indicators for evaluating
disease severity and outcomes.
