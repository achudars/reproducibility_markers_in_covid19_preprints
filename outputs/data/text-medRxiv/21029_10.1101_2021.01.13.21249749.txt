Mass Testing with Contact Tracing Compared to Test and Trace for
Effective Suppression of COVID-19 in the UK: A rapid review
Mathew Mbwogge1
Author Correspondence: Email: m.mbwoge@gmail.com

Abstract
___________________________________________________________________________
Background: Making testing available to everyone and tracing contacts might be the
gold standard towards the control of COVID-19, particularly when significant
transmissions are without symptoms. This study evaluated the effectiveness of mass
testing and contact tracing in the suppression of COVID-19 compared to conventional
Test and Trace in the UK.
Design: A rapid review of available evidence
Primary research question: Is there evidence that mass testing and tracing could
suppress community spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections better than Test and Trace?
Secondary research question: What is the proportion of asymptomatic cases of
SARS-CoV-2 reported during mass testing interventions?
Methods: Literature was searched in September through December 2020 in Google
Scholar, ScienceDirect, Mendeley and PubMed.
Results: Literature search yielded 286 articles from Google Scholar, 20 from Science
Direct, 14 from Mendeley, 27 from Pubmed and 15 through manual search. Altogether
35 articles were included, making a sample size of close to a million participants.
Conclusion: There was a very low level but promising evidence of 76.9% (95% CI:
46.2 – 95.0, P=0.09) majority vote in favour of the intervention under the primary
objective. The overall proportion of asymptomatic cases among those tested positive
and tested sample populations under the secondary objective was 40.7% (95% CI:
38.8 – 42.5) and 0.01% (95% CI: 0.01 – 0.012) respectively. Conventional test and
trace should be superseded by a decentralised and regular mass rapid testing and
contact tracing, championed by GP surgeries and low cost community services.
Keywords: COVID-19, test and trace, universal testing, mass testing, contact tracing

Introduction
________________________________________________________________
UK’s Test and Trace has been suboptimal in addressing the testing needs of those
infected with SARS-CoV-2, let alone handling its new variant(1). The panic over rising
cases and a potentially more dangerous second wave led to the creation of the
National Institute for Health Protection(2). Follow-up measures have been national
lockdown, increased testing, tier system, furlough scheme and approval of the Pfizer,
Oxford AstraZenaca and Moderna vaccines(3,4). As part of the above, about 56 million
tests have been performed as at January 10, 2021, with about 1.3 million
vaccinated(5). The plans to launch the 100 billion pound “moonshot” programme will
only sound as good if tests are delivered based on infections rather than on
symptoms(6,7). I concur with the Director General of WHO that “you cannot fight a fire
blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected”(8).
Infections could better inform public policy and facilitate equitable rollout of vaccines.
While hoping that vaccines will proof as effective as deemed in the development of
herd immunity, it is important not to lose sight of other control measures. Regular mass
testing combined with contact tracing could be a novel control strategy not just to inform
vaccination but also to guard against uncertainties arising from any new variant(9).

Research in Context
________________________________________________________________
Prior to this study
Three modelling studies implemented in
the UK dealing with mass testing were
found. One of the models did a feasibility
analysis of mass testing as a lockdown
exit strategy. One model compared mass
testing with symptom-based test and
trace, while another model compared
mass testing with symptom-based testing
and isolation. There have been no realtime study in the UK comparing mass test
and trace with the conventional test and
trace system, reason being that mass
testing and contact tracing was judged to
be impossible. One systematic review
was found, evaluating the effectiveness
of universal screening for SARS-CoV-2
compared to no screening.

In this study
This is the first review to the best of my
knowledge that sought to evaluate the
benefits of mass testing and contact
tracing (hybrid strategy) compared to test
and trace, in the control of COVID-19 in
the UK. The proportion of asymptomatic
cases has also been explored.
Way forward
There is urgent need for a strategy that
will identify SARS-CoV-2 carriers when
their viral load is high and are most likely
to be infectious. Real-time studies are
needed to (1) get a true picture of disease
burden, (2) validate various mass testing
options and (3) better inform vaccination
programme and other control measures.

Definitions
________________________________________________________________
Contact Tracing: The process of reporting, identifying, listing and follow-up of
individuals that have come in contact with those told to self-isolation due to positive
COVID-19 test results, in view of asking them to quarantine(10–12).
A Contact: A COVID-19 contact is defined as any person who has been in close
contact with a COVID-19 confirmed case either 2 days before symptom onset or before
sample collection and 14 days after the onset of symptoms or after the sample was
taken(10).
Isolation: The act of being restrained from social interaction for a period of 10 days
from symptom onset, as a result of either exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms or confirmed
positive test result(13).
Quarantine: To restrict the movement of contacts or people suspected to have come
in contact with COVID-19 cases for a period of 14 days from the time of last contact.
This includes contacts as defined herein, household members, passengers of inbound
flights from high-risk zones(13).
Test and Trace: The process of 1) testing COVID-19 symptomatic individuals in view
of asking them to stay in isolation and declare contacts, if with positive test results and
2) identifying, listing and follow-up of reported contacts so as to ask them to
quarantine(10,11). It is called Test and Protect in Scotland and Test, Trace and Protect
in Wales and Northern Ireland(14–16).
Mass testing: Also known as active case finding is the proactive approach of testing
individuals irrespective of symptoms so as to track the contacts of those infected and
break the transmission circuit of the virus early enough(17).
Effectiveness: The extent to which the rolling out of the intervention and/or control
benefits the public, economy and environment in terms of limiting the spread of SARSCoV-2/COVID-19, measured as the reduction in reproduction number-R(18).
Suppression: Implementation of a package of control measures in the middle of
differential community transmissions of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in view of reasonably
bringing the reproduction number (R) below 1, so as to safely reopen the economy(19).

Conventional Test and Trace (TT) System
________________________________________________________________
Figure 1 below shows the traditional “Test and Trace” system currently implemented
in the UK, with a number of possible implications. Kindly refer to www.gov.uk for further
details on how the Test and Trace system works(20). In the face of rising asymptomatic
infectivity, the present TT delivery strategy can be categorised as “the cake not worth
the candle”, since the programme fails to determine the true burden of the disease.

The following can generally be observed from the above conventional system;
1) Individuals who are asymptomatic and presymptomatic are missed out(21–23)
2) People are generally afraid of quarantine and may shy away from TT(24).
3) The decision of public safety about getting tested has been shifted to the public
4) Operational false positive estimates in the UK are currently unknown(25)

5) Proportion of daily asymptomatic cases is still not part of the national statistics
6) Test and trace depends on self-reported contacts which may be flawed
7) A proportion of the public is hesitant due to stigma surrounding data ethics(26)
8) TT is a shift away from Universal Health Coverage, amid a pandemic(27)
9) Long travel among others is a serious barrier to accessing test centres
The “Infectivity Problem” of COVID-19
The “infectivity problem” can be summarized into 1) Test ramp-up controversy, 2) TT
system leakages, 3) Time-to-test paradox and 4) Inequitable test delivery and delays.
Test Ramp-up Controversy: This is the heated discussion and lockdown-related
antagonism from the public, regarding the undesired positive correlation which was
presumed inverse, between testing capacity and COVID-19 cases. The supposed
endgame of test ramp-up was to contain the virus but countries have found themselves
in the “opposite-of-things”. This may be due to more cases now being detected as a
result of increased testing or because the testing is not comprehensive and early
enough to outweigh the viral shedding. This may culminate into the UK’s “operation
moonshot” controversy if testing rate continues to be less than infectivity rate(28).
Test and Trace System Leakages: Leakages refer to the infectious population that
apparently was supposed to be tested but end up not being detected. This includes
those with either unreported symptoms or not presenting for test, those sent home due
to unavailability of tests, asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals, unreported
and untraced contacts, false negatives as well as the non-compliant to isolation and
quarantine rules(29,30).
Time-to-test Paradox: This refers to the conflicting interest of whether to test prior to
symptoms or upon reported symptoms. The TT programme has been designed not to
test people at very early stages of infection for fear of missing out the very cases it is
meant to detect. The same is true when people are tested late(31,32). Research
suggest that the serial interval of Covid-19 is shorter than the incubation period,
indicating possible infectivity multiplier effect prior to symptom onset(33,34). This is
further compounded by operational false positives and false negatives(25).
Inequitable Test Delivery and Delays: This has to do with testing that is not delivered
at point-of-care thereby eliminating a certain group of persons, delays in testing those
reporting symptoms, test-to-results delay as well as contact tracing time lapse. The

aforementioned in addition to not testing those without symptoms led to increasing
infections in the face of delivering the highest number of tests in Europe(35). A disease
that is as deadly as the present gives no tolerance to turnaround time and mitigation
programme mistakes, the biggest of which has been the apparently neglected
asymptomatic infectivity.

How the Intervention Should Work
________________________________________________________________
The novel mass test and contact trace strategy is one that 1) extends the present Test
and Trace system to the general public and 2) moving it from laboratory based to pointof-care thereby enhancing acceptability, accessibility and equity. This framework is a
modification of that proposed by Lassi et al(36). Community ownership involves each
individual registering with a general practitioner (GP) surgery, capacitated to perform
routine open invitation testing irrespective of symptoms. The strategy necessitates the
availability of rapid easy-to-run cost effective tests and a succinct exit strategy. Inputs
include macro policies (fiscal, support schemes, PPE, hygiene and sanitation,
environmental, tier system etc.), messa policies (GP capacitation, social gathering, atrisk group, vaccination etc.) and micro policies (health status, personal hygiene,
compliance to national guidelines, tracing app acceptability). Routine health checks
with GPs have hardly raised concerns around privacy due to trust. It is more reliable
and confident for GPs to run testing programmes, offer direct vaccination and
therapeutic treatment to those that have tested positive, as well as request those with
positive test results to report contacts on the NHS contact tracing platform. Through a
shared platform, Contact Tracing Centre (CTC) could be granted access to a limited
dataset or transferred to the NHS Contact Tracing system. The CTC liaises with index
cases for any additional contacts, and calls all listed contacts for quarantine advice.
Based on data collected, the tier management team and environmental health officers
work in synergy with local councils towards local containment strategies, similar to how
the local outbreak in Leicester was managed. Figure 2 below shows the workflow of
proposed framework.

Objectives
________________________________________________________________
The study objective is twofold. Firstly to evaluate the evidence of Mass Test and Trace
compared to Test and Trace in the suppression of community transmissions of SARSCoV-2/COVID-19. Secondly to find out the proportion of reported asymptomatic
carriers during mass testing interventions.
The population of interest included symptomatic and apparently healthy individuals
within the UK setting. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recently emerged
acute respiratory disease caused by a highly pathogenic coronavirus called Severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in 2019 in
Wuhan China(37). SARS-CoV-2 shares more than 90% amino acid and 79% genome
sequence identities with SARS-CoV and 50% genome identity with the Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Symptoms of COVID-19 include
prolonged high fever (≥38°C), prolonged cough, dyspnea and loss of taste. The
intervention of interest is mass testing irrespective of symptoms and tracing contacts
of positive cases, while the control is symptom-based test and trace.
Primary research question
Is there evidence that testing irrespective of symptoms combined with tracing could
suppress SARS-CoV-2 infections better than symptom-based testing and tracing?
Secondary research question
What is the proportion of asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 reported during mass
testing interventions?

Search Strategy
A literature search was performed on September 9, 2020 and constantly refreshed
through December 22, 2020. The search involved all English articles published in 2020
including grey literature. Search terms in Google Scholar included “[UK] [Effectiveness
of mass testing] [COVID-19] [SARS-CoV-2] [Contact OR tracing] [Contact tracing]
[Effectiveness of test and trace] –Animals –Influenza –HIV –Cancer”. An advanced
search was performed in ScienceDirect for “[Test and trace] OR [contact tracing] AND
[COVID-19] AND [SARS-CoV-2] AND [asymptomatic] AND [symptomatic] OR
[screening for SARS-CoV-2] OR [mass testing for SARS-CoV-2]”, whose title included
“[UK] AND [test and trace] OR [contact tracing] OR [community screening for SARSCoV-2] OR [mass testing for SARS-CoV-2]” restricted to the year 2020. A search in
PubMed included “((((((((Mass testing for COVID-19 and "Contact tracing") OR (Mass
testing for SARS-CoV-2 and "Contact tracing")) OR ("Test and trace")) OR ("Mass
testing" and "symptom-based testing")) NOT (Animals)) NOT (HIV)) NOT (Influenza))
NOT (Ebola)) NOT (Cancer)”. Finally, a search for “Mass testing for COVID-19” AND
“contact tracing for COVID-19” OR “mass testing for SARS-CoV-2” AND “contact
tracing for SARS-CoV-2” was done in Mendeley.
Exclusion Criteria
All articles published before the year 2020, non-English articles, articles whose full
texts were not accessible, non-COVID-19 articles, articles on non-human subjects and
non-mass testing articles. Given that this review was about detecting people currently
infected, we excluded antibody studies. We also excluded editorials and protocols
Eligibility Criteria
Full text articles comparing testing irrespective of symptoms and contact tracing with
symptom-based test and trace, as well as any partial comparison between the above.

participants, strategies used, assumptions, data analysis, results, study limitations and
bias.
Criteria for Grouping Studies
In accordance with the study objective and logical framework, studies for synthesis
were grouped according to outcome. In order to capture the studies whose
interventions geared towards evaluating effects on outcomes of interest(38). This
made it easy to articulate synthesis to research questions.
Standardized and Synthesis Metrics
Direction of effect was used as the standardize metric because there was a lack of
precision specific to the effect of intervention and control in the results presented by
different studies. This did not permit the calculation of summary statistics(39). In light
of the above, vote counting was the best match in synthesising the results. A sign test
was used to indicate whether there was an evidence of effect. Equivocal effects
between the intervention and control were considered to be distributed around the null
hypothesis of no effect. This study made use of Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis
(SWiM) reporting guidelines to report review results(40).
Heterogeneity Assessment
Heterogeneity of studies was assessed following the GRADE risk assessment
factors(41). The lack of pooled effect size of modelling studies did not warrant us to
perform a methodological diversity(42). Regarding the second objective however,
variability was assessed by directly observing confidence intervals on plotted graphs.
Data Analysis
Review findings were synthesised thematically. The quality of studies was critically
appraised using most recent tools based on study design, in accordance with PHO
MetQAT 1.0 quality appraisal tool(43,44). The methodology and risk of bias of
modelling studies was assessed using Relevance and Credibility Assessment (RCA)
tool proposed by Caro and colleagues(45). Cohort studies were assed using Critical
Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool(46). Specialist Unit for Review Evidence
(SURE) tool was used to assess cross sectional studies(47). Studies were grouped
into 6 main categories according to outcome, as outlined in the methodology section
for easy analysis and synthesis. Quality of evidence generated by different studies was

assessed using the Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and
Evaluation (GRADE) tool(48).
Data Presentation and Visualization
Tabular and graphical methods were deployed in presenting results. The GRADE
summary of findings table was used to present certainty of evidence and a bar chart to
present the effect direction of studies for the primary objective. In the secondary
objective, forest plots were used to present the proportion of asymptomatic cases of
SARS-CoV-2, using an excel model proposed by Neyeloff et al(91)
Criteria for Prioritizing Results
In relation to the primary question, results of studies that evaluated the effectiveness
of the intervention and control within the UK, with low risk of bias were prioritized
because this was in line with the review objective. Real-time studies were also
prioritized as these are more likely to be close to reality.

Selection and Publication Bias
________________________________________________________________
Preferential publication was counteracted by including grey literature. Missing data
effect verification was performed by searching for grey literature that sought to
compare the effectiveness of the intervention to the control(49). Editorials, thesis,
protocols and news articles were excluded. This increased quality of included articles.

Search Results
________________________________________________________________
The search yielded 286 articles from Google Scholar, 20 articles from Science Direct,
14 articles from Mendeley, 27 articles from Pubmed and 15 articles from other sources
giving a total of 362 articles. Altogether 64 eligible articles were screened for inclusion.
Given the ambiguity in the use of contact tracing in most studies to include testing,
studies evaluating the effectiveness of contact tracing provided they had a component
of mass testing were included. Considering the novelty of the term Test and Trace
used in this study, it is common place to find contact tracing based on symptom testing
used in studies to be likened to Test and Trace in this review.

Methodological and Risk of Bias Assessment
________________________________________________________________
I went for whole study assessment and deployed study design specific tools due to the
lack of a standardized tool for non-randomised controlled studies(44,84). The critical
appraisal is also in accordance with PHO MetQAT 1.0 quality appraisal tool(43).
Modelling studies
A total of 12 modelling studies were included and assessed for bias, 5 (41.7%) of which
were rated at low risk, 4 (33.3%) at moderate risk and 3 (25%) at high risk of bias. The
main concerns for ratings are summarized in table 2 below;

Synthesis of Results
________________________________________________________________
Primary Question: Is there evidence that mass testing and contact tracing
could suppress community spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections better than
test and trace?
Vote counting was deployed as the method to synthesize results, in line with direction
of effect that was used. Studies were prioritized based on their degree of bias in the
reported evidence. The GRADE diagram for assessing the quality of evidence was
used to grade the evidence presented by the different studies(85). GRADE summary
of findings table of the different studies can be seen in Table 5 below.
Outcome 1: Effectiveness
Four of 12 studies (33.3%) under this outcome were at high risk of bias, three (25%)
were at moderate risk of bias and five (41.7%) were rated as low. Nine studies [75%,
95% Binomal Exact CI: 42.8%-94.5%, p=0.15] including Emery (2020), Tsou (2020),
Mizumoto (2020), Moghadas (2020), Pollmann (2020), Hill (2020), Gorji (2020), Alsing
(2020) and Hagan (2020) were voted in favour of the intervention. Three studies [25%,
95% BE CI: 5.5%-57.1%, p=0.15] including Grassly (2020), Sasmita (2020) and Bracis
(2020) showed an unfavourable direction of effect and were voted in favour of the
control. The body of evidence presented by the 11 modelling studies for this outcome
was downgraded by 3 levels to very low. Firstly, because studies were neither
randomized control trials nor real-time studies leading to one level down. An additional
2 levels downgrading was due to serious study bias, inter-study variation, imprecision
and indirectness. The evidence from the lone cross-sectional study (Hagan, 2020),
was downgraded by 3 levels to “very low” as well. It was downgraded by one level
because the study was not a randomized control trial. It was further downgraded by 2
levels due to methodological issues, imprecision and indirectness.
Outcome 3: Cost-Effectiveness
A single study found for this outcome (Paltiel, 2020), was voted in favour of the
intervention. This study was at high risk of bias. The quality of evidence was
downgraded by one level given that it is not a randomized control trial. Being a model

based on assumptions coupled with study limitations, imprecision and indirectness, the
evidence was further downgraded by 2 levels. Evidence was classed as very low.
Outcome 2: Safety
I found no study addressing this outcome. However, a body of literature exist regarding
safety and security concerns from the public with contact tracing(86–88). Also, both
nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swaps appear to be slightly invasive. The possible
harms of mass testing have also been analysed by some authors(89).
Outcome 4: Acceptability
Again, no study was found regarding this outcome. Altmann and colleagues found a
high level of acceptance for app-based contact tracing in their investigation across
different countries including the UK(90).
Outcome 5: Equity
There was no study for this outcome. It remains however clear that the test and trace
system is not equitable(27).
Binomial Test and 95% Confidence Interval
A total of 13 studies were retained for the primary objective. Statistical synthesis for
the primary objective was based on binomial probability test and binomial exact
confidence intervals performed in StataCorp 14.2 (Texas, USA) with input. Ten of the
studies favoured the intervention [76.9%: 95% Binomial Exact CI: 46.2% - 95.0%,
P=0.09], with just three [23.1%, 95% BE CI: 5.0%-53.8%, p=0.09] voted in favour of
the control. The above indicates that the intervention is a better strategy than the
control in the control of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 transmissions. The probability that the
above estimate is true if conventional Test and Trace programme was truly better than
Mass Testing and Contact Tracing is just 9%. The 76.9% favourable direction of effect
is a clear enough majority vote to say that mass test and trace is truly more beneficial.
Assuming that the true probability of both MTT and TT being equivocal is 0.5 under the
null hypothesis (H0: MTT=TT), this study observed 10 votes well above the expected
mean of 6.5 ± 1.803 votes. Four of 10 studies (40%) in favour of the intervention were
at high risk of bias, 3 at moderate risk and 3 at low risk of bias. Twenty three percent
of 13 retained studies were of representative sample and setting. Two of all 3 studies

The generated GRADE evidence profile was used to present the synthesis findings
regarding the primary objective as seen in table 6 below. Supplement 6 provides details
of how the evidence for different outcomes was graded.
The results of 6 studies including Emery (2020), Muzimoto (2020), Gorji (2020), Hill
(2020), Alsing (2020) and Paltiel (2020) were prioritized. These contributed more to
the conclusion that the intervention was better because they were judged to be at low
to moderate risk of bias. Three of the studies (Emery, 2020; Hill, 2020; Alsing, 2020)
were judged to be at low risk of bias. Two of these (Hill, 2020 and Alsing, 2020) were
both of the representative population and evaluated mass testing and contact tracing
as a hybrid strategy, in line with the primary objective. Emery (2020) failed to consider
contact tracing but compared the effect of testing based on symptoms and testing
irrespective of symptoms. The direction of effect will not be different if contact tracing
were to be integrated since contact tracing is contingent on testing.

Secondary Question: What is the proportion of asymptomatic cases of
SARS-CoV-2 reported during mass testing interventions?
A total of 21 cross sectional studies and 1 cohort study (33 reports and 9942828
participants) (Nishiura, 2020; Treibel, 2020; Brown, 2020; Graham, 2020; Abeysuriya,
2020; Arons, 2020; Jameson, 2020; Callaghan, 2020; Louie, 2020; Gudbjartsson,
2020; Reid, 2020; Lavezzo, 2020; Kimball, 2020; Olalla, 2020; Guery, 2020; Roxby,
2020; Lytras, 2020; Hoehl, 2020; Cao, 2020; Baggett, 2020; Imbert, 2020) were
retained under the secondary objective. Mean number of positive and asymptomatic
cases were 80.6±187.7 and 32.8±57.1 respectively. There was limited precision in
effect estimates with just 27% of studies providing data on confidence intervals useful
for the research question. Thirty two percent of studies were at low to moderate risk of
bias and 68% at high risk of bias. Risk of bias evaluation can be found in table 4 above.
Outcome among detected positive cases
The proportion of asymptomatic cases among those testing positive ranged from 28%
(95% CI: 25.9 – 30.2) in the general population to 96.6% (95% CI: 82.2 – 99.9) among
care home staff. The overall proportion was found to be 40.7% (95% CI: 38.8 – 42.5)
as can be seen in figure 5 below. Two studies (Jameson, 2020 and Callaghan, 2020)
neither detected any cases nor found asymptomatic carriers and so were excluded.

Outcome in tested sample population
Prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was highest among homeless shelter
residents [30.1%, 95% CI: 26.5-33.9], followed by care home residents [21%, 95% CI:
18 – 24) and lowest among hospital patients [0%, 95% CI: 0.0 – 1.2]. Besides
screening in the general population, overall asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 prevalence for
all other settings was 3.9% (95% CI: 3.6 – 4.2). Figure 6 below shows outcome

Figure 7: Proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers (outcome in %) in detected positive
cases and sampled population in different settings from 4 studies in the UK
CI: Confidence Interval

Overall prevalence of asymptomatic cases within the UK was found to be 3.76% (95%
CI: 3.1 – 4.5) with rates ranging from 2.2% (95% CI: 1.6 – 2.8) among hospital staff to
14.9% (95% CI: 11.5 – 18.8) in care homes. Figure 7 above clearly demonstrates a
higher overall rate among detected cases compared to that of all studies (z=4.53,
p=0.00001 at p=0.05). Asymptomatic cases were 1.4 times more likely to be detected
among positive cases in the UK than all studies put together. There was no significant
difference between overall prevalence rate in the UK (3.76%) and all studies put
together (3.9%), besides population screening (z = -0.37, p=0.71 at p=0.5)
All unreported confidence intervals were generated in SATA 14.2 (binomial exact) and
exported to excel. The rule of three was applied to all studies with no outcome event
(Jameson, 2020 and Callaghan, 2020).

Inter-study Variability
________________________________________________________________
Variations among studies included in the primary objective were mainly due to study
population and setting, assumptions together with model structure. Only 3 of 13 studies
synthesised under the primary objective were of the representative population. Apart
from deploying different model types, some studies made use of real-time COVID-19
dataset, others used historic datasets while others relied on hypothetical samples. This
increased variability and reduced the generalizability of results. However two of three
studies implemented in the UK were in favour of the intervention.
An observation of plotted graphs under the secondary objective, showed minimal
heterogeneity mostly stemming from the study implemented among pregnant women.
Also, a stratification by setting gave a better picture and produced similar rates for
studies in the UK and all studies pooled together, besides population level studies.

Discussion
________________________________________________________________
Albeit considered very low level evidence, review synthesis have shown a clear
enough majority vote of 76.9% (95% Binomial Exact CI: 46.2% - 95.0%, P=0.09) in
favour of the intervention. Studies that were in favour of the control (Kucharski et al,
2020; Grassly et al, 2020 and Bracis et al, 2020) failed to consider mass testing and
contact tracing as a hybrid strategy. These studies went on the assumption that mass
testing was not feasible, as acknowledged in an open letter by Peto (2020)(92).
Evidence from countries that embarked on mass testing including Taiwan, Germany,
Ireland, China and India support the fact that regular mass testing and contact tracing
could be the game changer. The analysis by Peto et al (2020) showed that mass
testing and contact tracing is by far more cost-effective than present test and trace, in
line with the second outcome. Maslov (2020) on the contrary shares an opposing view
in that even the slightest false positives will render random mass testing an unreliable
policy(93). While Maslov seem to be concerned with the inherent moral decadence of
unjust isolation, it is rather better to be on a safe side than in a pool of false negatives
and contented asymptomatic carriers. Identification of asymptomatic carriers is crucial
because Viswanathan and colleagues also acknowledged that strategies based on
symptom screening could miss between 40 – 100% of infected persons(94). Paying
attention to asymptomatic infectiousness no matter how small the proportion may be

has also been underscored in Byambasuren et al(2020)(95). This argument is also in
accordance with the key messages and objectives of European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control, that whole population be tested in high transmission
settings(96).
This review also found an overall proportion of asymptomatic carriers among detected
positive cases to be 40.7% (95% CI: 38.8-42.5) and 56.6% (95% CI: 49.6 – 63.4) within
the UK when stratified. Proportions across studies ranged from 28% among cases
detected in the general population to 96.6% among care home staff with positive tests.
Also, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was highest among residents in
homeless shelter (30.1%) and lowest among hospital patients (0.0%). The 40.7%
asymptomatic proportion among positive cases is in accordance with the 40 – 45%
proportion estimated by Oran et al(97). Clarke and colleagues reported a similar rate
of 40.3% among haemodialysis patients(98). This proportion is also concordant to that
reported in Spain (40.5%) by Albalate et al(99). The proportion of detected positive air
travellers (83.6%) found in this review is higher than the 76.6% reported in Al-Qahtani
et al(100) perhaps due to more awareness as the study was implemented at a much
later date. Yanes-Lane reported an asymptomatic proportion of positive cases among
care home residents (54%) just a little lower than the 60.2% reported in this
review(101). Notwithstanding the

overarching reported high infectivity from

asymptomatic individuals, this review reports rates ranging from 0.005 – 1.2% in the
population, similar to rates (1.5 – 2%) reported by Wu et al(102). The estimate that the
proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 among cases in the general population is
28% is in agreement with the community asymptomatic proportion of 28% in Beale et
al(103). In contrast, Petersen et al reported a community asymptomatic proportion that
was three times higher (76.5% to 86.1%)(104). This population level study was
undertaken in the UK, contrary to those included in this review (Iceland, Italy and
China). The largest population sample in this review (about a million) was a study done
immediately after lockdown which could be the reason behind the low rates.

Study Limitations
________________________________________________________________
A majority of included studies were modelling studies which normally rely on
assumptions that sometimes may hardly be achieved in real life. Expert knowledge

was needed to evaluate the validation process of models and it cannot be guarantee
that the conclusions on bias were as accurate as would have otherwise expected. The
fact that this review went through a single reviewer might have introduced some bias
in study selection and analysis. The variability in the understanding of mass testing by
different researchers might have had an effect on the analysis as well. This review was
language biased since the literature search was limited to English articles. Non peer
reviewed articles (preprints) were included in the review thereby reducing the quality
of evidence. This review was not registered with PROSPERO for standard systematic
review practice and will be erroneous to be considered as such.

Public Health Implications
________________________________________________________________
Controlling a virus whose manifestation is increasingly without signs is not about
number of tests but about who needs to be tested. An appropriate public health
strategy that will get the right people tested, at the right time and in the right place
requires a community based and participatory approach which will not be without a
greater cost burden. Among others, winning the quenched public confidence, ensuring
data privacy, acceptability of the NHS app and equity of testing and contact tracing,
use of rapid test, capacity building, effective monitoring of isolation and quarantine and
programme sustainability are some of the considerations that will have to be made.
More real-time research is needed regarding the effectiveness of mass testing and
contact tracing, for a better picture of disease burden and mitigation strategies.

Conclusion and Recommendations
________________________________________________________________
This review sought to critically evaluate the evidence that mass testing and contact
tracing is more effective in controlling local transmissions of COVID-19 in the UK,
compared to conventional Test and Trace. It has demonstrated a very low level of
promising evidence that mass testing and contact tracing could be more effective in
bringing the virus under control and even more effective if combined with social
distancing and face coverings. The implementation of test and trace has to be done at
mass irrespective of symptoms with the local community, through GP surgeries,
community health centres and local councils(105). The proposal is for the present Test
and Trace to be superseded by a decentralised and continuous mass testing

programme with rapid tests, championed by low-resource-need community
services(106). The following recommendations are therefore useful;
Capacitate GP surgeries and community health services to deliver mass testing at
point-of-care.
Government should work in synergy with local councils for robust surveillance, isolation
and quarantine(107). This showed major success in Germany(108,109)
Regular organizational and company-wide testing including the NHS, care homes and
schools for the safe return of workforce and students(71,74).
Coronavirus testing should be a boarder control measure for all travellers(111,112).
Testing of prisoners, detainees and all those in congested accommodations(55). The
Lesbos camp testing in Greece led to more than 240 positive cases(113,114)
Sewage and environment related testing should be part of mitigation strategies

Strategies

Reason for exclusion

- Symptomatic but not aware of exposure risk
- Aware of exposure risk but without detectable symptoms
- Symptomatic and aware that exposure may have
occurred
- Neither symptomatic nor aware of exposure risk

Lack of intervention

- Symptom-based contact tracing
- Test-based contact tracing
- Testing of asymptomatic contacts

Contact tracing limited to
symptom-based testing

- Isolation of RBKC residents from the rest of the city
- Removal of lockdown
- Weekly testing (business reopens but people work from
home)
- Shielding 60+ age group with lifting of lockdown
- Combined universal testing and use of face coverings
with no lockdown
- Universal testing, contact tracing and isolation, lockdown

Comments
1. Neither subjects nor outcome assessors were blinded
2. Ethnicity of healthcare workers might have been important
3. No report on whether there was loss to follow-up or not
4. Absolute risk reduction unreported
5. Limited applicability due to study population and contextual differences
6. Study highlights the importance of mass testing and contact tracing in a healthcare setting which can be applicable to any context

Control of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Transmissions
Emery(2020)(23)
53% (95% Posterior Interval, PI: 51-56%) of
asymptomatic carriers under symptom-agnostic testing
went undetected compared to mass testing.
Grassly(2020)(50)
Test and trace will reduce R by 8% (95% Uncertainty
Interval 5–11) for 50% coverage and 48 hour samplequarantine delay, compared to mass PCR testing
Tsou(2020)(51)
Symptom-based testing prevented no subclinical case
while symptom-based and at-risk group testing prevented
40%, 60% and 80% subclinical cases
Mizumoto(2020)(52)
A total of 634 detected due to mass testing compared to
306 symptomatic cases that would have been detected
through symptom-based approach
Sasmita(2020)(53)
Contact tracing (test trace) combined with other
measures showed to be more effective than mass testing
combined with other measures in outbreak prediction
Moghadas(2020)(54)
Symptom-based test and trace must be combined with
testing irrespective of symptomology
Bracis et al(55)
Symptom test and trace was more effective than mass
testing in reducing daily deaths and when aiming for 70%
post COVID physical interactions

Internal validation for most studies and treatment of parameter/structural uncertainties unclear for some studies
Differences in study populations and settings. Lack of confidence intervals and statistical significance

Population and settings in 5 studies not representative

Control of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Transmissions
Pollmann(2020)(56)
Mass random testing and contact tracing can control the
outbreak as oppose to contact tracing (test and trace)
Hill(2020)(57)
Regular mass testing and contact tracing reduced
infections by more than 50% compared to when there is
no mass testing
Gorji(2020)(58)
Mass testing (about 166 per 100,000) based on contact
counting is more effective, reducing reproduction number
from R = 2.4 to R = 1
Alsing(2020)(59)
Mass testing and contact tracing can contain 74% of the
outbreak and get R below 1 more than contact tracing
Hagan(2020)(60)
Mass testing identified 8,239 (Range; 10-2193,
Median=403) compared to 642 (Range: 2-181,
Median=19) during symptom-based testing
Paltiel(2020)(61)
Mass testing/screening (every 1, 2 or 7days) was found
to be more effective for R=3.5, 2.5 or 1.5 respectively,
compared to symptom-based screening
