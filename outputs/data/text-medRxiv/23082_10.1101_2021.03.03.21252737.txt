ABSTRACT

Introduction: As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, emerging
evidence suggests

that

individuals

from

ethnic

minority backgrounds

may be

disproportionately affected. The UK-REACH project has been initiated to understand ethnic
differentials in COVID-19 outcomes among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United
Kingdom (UK) through five inter-linked work packages. The ethico-legal work package
(Work Package 3) aims to understand and address legal, ethical and acceptability issues
around big data research; the healthcare workers’ experiences work package (Work Package
4) is a qualitative study exploring healthcare workers’ experiences during COVID-19 and; the
stakeholder engagement work package (Work Package 5) aims to provide feedback and
support with the formulation and dissemination of the project recommendations.

Methods and Analysis: Work Package 3 has two different research strands: (a) desk-based
doctrinal research; and (b) empirical qualitative research with key opinion leaders. For the
empirical research, in-depth interviews will be conducted digitally and recorded with
participants’ permission. Recordings will be transcribed, coded and analysed using thematic
analysis. In Work Package 4, online in-depth interviews and focus groups will be conducted
with approximately 150 HCWs, from across the UK, and these will be recorded with
participants’ consent. The recordings will be transcribed, coded and data will be analysed
using thematic analysis. Work Package 5 will achieve its objectives through regular group
meetings and in-group discussions.

Ethics and Dissemination: Ethical approval has been received from the London - Brighton
& Sussex Research Ethics Committee of the Health Research Authority (Ref No.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY

•

The dual approach of doctrinal and empirical research (Work Package 3) on the use of
personal data by UK-REACH will give a comprehensive understanding of the ethical
and legal implications of the study, and perceptions about its use of data.

•

Qualitative research with healthcare workers in the UK on their experiences during
the COVID-19 pandemic (Work Package 4) will provide insight into personal
behaviour, perceptions of risk and coping mechanisms adopted both inside and
outside of the work environment.

•

Stakeholder engagement (Work Package 5) from professional regulatory bodies and
staff groups is embedded within the UK-REACH study to provide feedback on project
activities and support with project recommendations.

•

The target participants (key opinion leaders) for Work Package 3 empirical study will
likely come from predominantly White backgrounds which may limit the breadth of
views obtained in interviews. This limitation will be mitigated by active recruitment
of opinion leaders from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds and active interaction
with Work Package 5.

•

Due to the pandemic restrictions, interviews and focus group discussions will be
conducted via online methods as a substitute for face-to-face meetings, posing
practical and technological challenges for dynamic interaction with participants.

INTRODUCTION

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019 in China, the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly to almost all parts of
the world, infecting officially and to date, more than 100 million people and claiming around
two million lives (1). As the world continues to grapple with this novel virus, there is
emerging evidence that ethnicity may be an important risk factor in COVID-19 infection,
disease, and mortality (2). In the United Kingdom (UK), people from ethnic minority
communities have been found to be disproportionately affected by COVID-19 (3-7). Ethnic
differences in COVID-19 outcomes have become significant not only because of the grave
medical and clinical concerns, but also due to accompanying issues of marginalisation and
health inequities affecting these communities, which predate the pandemic (8). Urgent calls
had, therefore, been made to mainstream ethnicity into COVID-19 research, albeit with
caution to adopt a holistic view of ethnicity (9, 10). While research on ethnicity and COVID19 has since progressed (11), its interplay with other crucial risk factors, such as occupation,
remains scantily explored.
Occupational risk has been identified as a contributing factor in COVID-19 morbidity and
mortality, with healthcare workers (HCWs) accounting for a large proportion of the total
caseload (12). The increased burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HCWs and their families,
particularly those from an ethnic minority background, has been reported, raising further
concerns about the protection of those most at risk (13-16). Potential explanations for
increased risk among HCWs have mostly been attributed to patient-facing roles, lack of
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), long working hours, and even lack of training (17).
While these reasons may offer partial explanation, they fail to explicate the high rates of
infection and deaths among ethnic minority HCWs. In their analysis of deaths from COVID6

19 among National Health Service (NHS) workers in the UK, Cook et al., point out that while
ethnic minority workers constitute about 21% of the NHS workforce, they have accounted for
nearly 63% of the total deaths (16). These differential outcomes make an urgent case for
exploring if, how, and why ethnicity affects COVID-19 diagnosis and clinical outcomes in
HCWs, with special reference to HCWs from ethnic minority groups.
The United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare
workers (UK-REACH), led by the University of Leicester, has been initiated to fill this gap,
and will rapidly examine differences in COVID-19 diagnosis, clinical outcomes, professional
practices, and physical and mental well-being among HCWs from different ethnicities
through five inter-linked work packages. In this article, we describe the doctrinal, qualitative
and stakeholder engagement protocol covering Work Packages 3-5 of the project, which will
explore questions of ethics, law, risk perception and behaviours of HCWs in relation to
COVID-19.
UK-REACH (Work Packages 3-5) Objectives:
The objectives of Work Packages 3-5 are to:
1.

Undertake research to understand and address legal, ethical, and social acceptability
issues around data protection, privacy and information governance associated with the
linkage of professionals’ registration data and healthcare data (Work Package 3).

2.

Undertake qualitative interviews and focus groups with HCWs to examine
experiences, knowledge, behaviour, and risk perceptions pertaining to COVID-19
(Work Package 4); and

3. Develop a multi-professional, national stakeholder group to inform the conduct of the
research, facilitate rapid dissemination and translation of the research findings into
policy (Work Package 5).

METHODS
Ethical and Legal Work Package (WP3)
Study Design
Research involving large datasets containing personal and health information raises legal,
ethical, and social issues surrounding the processing of such sensitive data, even when then
the data are putatively anonymised. Understanding healthcare workers’ concerns regarding
trust, engagement, risk perception, barriers to participation, and confidentiality are paramount
for a project like UK-REACH to succeed and be conducted in a way that both respects
participants’ rights and interests, and also holds ethics and law at the forefront of each
research activity. To do so, the legal and ethical work package will undertake two different
strands of research. First, we will undertake desk-based doctrinal research to identify the
relevant legal and ethical issues and provide a policy report with ongoing recommendations
for implementation within the project. Second, we will conduct empirical qualitative research
with key opinion leaders to explore their views on the ethical and legal implications of large
dataset analyses/cohort studies, such as risks of re-identification and identifying core
principles of information governance in the context of sensitive data and healthcare worker
datasets. We explore each of these research strands in more detail below.
Desk-Based Research
The legal and ethical work package will commence with a comprehensive literature and
doctrinal review to identify the legal framework and ethical issues pertinent to UK-REACH.
This will focus on concerns surrounding privacy, data protection, and human rights, and how
to ensure an ethical approach for UK-REACH, particularly in the context of linking data
concerning healthcare professionals’ employment, registration and health. Key issues we will
consider include, the limits of anonymisation, the risks of re-identification, particular ethical

concerns arising from the use of sensitive data concerning ethnicity, and what appropriate
safeguards can be considered.
From this, a comprehensive policy report will be formulated to outline the key legal and
ethical issues and provide recommendations for UK-REACH, to be delivered in month 3 of
the project.
Empirical Qualitative Research
Study Population
The proposed qualitative research component in this work package will have key opinion
leaders (≥16 years of age) working in a healthcare and biomedical research, or in healthrelated organisations (such as regulatory bodies, Royal Colleges, trade unions).
Approximately 15-20 participants will be purposively selected and recruited through
gatekeepers.
Data Collection
Data will be collected using a semi-structured topic guide, which has been developed by ED
in consultation with other investigators and the PPI group in UK-REACH. The topic guide
will include key areas of inquiry, such as participants’ past experiences of research or
knowledge of research processes, real or perceived barriers to research participation, views
on current safeguards in law, policy and regulation around participants’ rights and interests,
exploring how ethnicity and race may influence risks and stigmatisation in research, or
perceptions of the same and finally to gather views on protection measures that can or should
be put in place by law or policy to adequately protect research participants. Additionally, for
purposes of describing the cohort, basic demographic information such as age, gender, job
role, and geographic location will be collected using a short demographic data template.

Interviews will be conducted by a member of the research team via Skype, Microsoft Teams
(or similar videoconference platform), or via telephone, depending on the availability,
preference, COVID-19 limitations, and/or work requirements of the participant. The
interviews are likely to last between 45-60 minutes. Interviews will be recorded through the
relevant platform software where possible (e.g. using the recording feature in Teams) or on
encrypted digital dictaphones, always with participants’ express written permission. If
required, interviews will be conducted with interpreters using simultaneous translation where
preferred by the participant. If preferred, participants may also write their responses to the
questions in the topic guide, rather than orally. Where interviews are conducted orally, data
will be transcribed and then anonymised prior to data analysis. Where data are collected with
interpreters, only the English language data will be transcribed and analysed. Anonymised
written accounts and field notes will also be transcribed into Word documents for analysis.
Analysis Plan
Digital files of the recorded interviews will be immediately uploaded securely and transcribed
in intelligent verbatim by a transcription specialist company. The transcripts will be
anonymised by removing all identifying information that enabled indirect or inferential
identification. Once transcribed, we will compare the transcription with the recording to
ensure accuracy.
The data from the interviews will be coded using qualitative thematic analysis. The process
will consist of generating initial codes by comparing each of the transcripts. Coding is
expected to be done manually and in multiple stages. We will adopt an inductive, data-driven
approach and will begin with ‘open coding’, i.e. reading each transcript (word by word and
line by line). During the coding process, we will take notes in a memo-style format by writing
down words and thoughts considered to be of use during the data analysis and serve as a

reference for potential coding ideas. After completion of the open coding, initial codes will be
constructed based on what emerged from the text, and we will proceed to code the remaining
transcripts with those codes. When we encounter data that do not fit into an existing code, we
will add new codes. We will then group the similar codes and place them into categories.
These categories will be reorganised into broader, higher order categories, then grouped,
revised, and refined, and finally checked to determine whether the categories are mutually
exclusive. At this point, we will form final categories, identifying subthemes both within and
across the categories, which will then be organised into main themes.
Qualitative Research on Healthcare Workers’ Experiences Work Package (WP4)
Study Design
In Work Package 4, we will undertake qualitative research with HCWs to understand their
experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will engage with clinical and ancillary staff
from ethnic minority and White backgrounds working in healthcare settings (e.g. frontline
healthcare workers, ancillary staff working in hospitals, community practitioners) to gain
insight into their perceptions around risk factors, support, coping mechanisms, and their
mental and physical health during the pandemic in order to inform response strategies to
reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in these individuals. We will conduct semistructured interviews and focus groups, which will enable in-depth explorations of individual
participants’ experiences and perspectives (18), and also facilitate discussion between
participants to explore both shared and differing experiences and perspectives (19, 20).
Study Population
Participants in Work Package 4 will consist of adult individuals (≥16 years of age) with
capacity to consent, from ethnic minority and White backgrounds with experience of working
in healthcare settings during COVID-19, including both clinical and ancillary staff. We will

recruit a purposive sample and will aim for theoretical saturation, including approximately 50
in-depth semi-structured interviews and focus groups with a total of approximately 100
participants. Saturation describes the point at which no new data or insights are being gained
from interviews or focus groups (21), and so, it becomes methodologically unnecessary to
continue recruiting new individuals. In total, we aim to recruit approximately 150 participants
from different ethnicities, genders, job roles, hospital trusts and health boards, and UK
regions to obtain a diverse sample.
Data Collection
We will recruit participants through collaborators/partners, community organisations, and
NHS organisations throughout the country. We will promote our research through posters,
which will be advertised on site and digitally (e.g. online, by e-mail, and social media).
Interested individuals will be able to contact the research team directly via the information
provided on the poster. We will also work with gatekeepers in our partner and NHS
organisations, who will send out communications regarding UK-REACH Work Package 4 to
their networks or staff to facilitate recruitment. Additionally, a subset of cohort participants
from Work Package 2 who have given their consent to be contacted for further research will
be invited to participate in the interviews/focus groups.
Semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be conducted by the research team
informed by a topic guide. Key topics included in this guide are: exploring participants’
experiences of working during COVID-19; their fears and concerns at work and outside of
work; perceived risk factors; challenges faced in accessing information to keep themselves
safe; concerns around stigma, discrimination and racism; and identifying facilitators and
coping mechanisms. To accommodate multiple participants, approximately 1.5 hours will be
allocated to the focus groups compared to the 45-60 minutes for the one-to-one interviews.

Following their participation, a token payment will be given to HCWs in recognition of their
contribution to the research.
The topic guide will be the same when engaging healthcare staff through focus groups or
one-to-one interviews. As in Work Package 3, we will also collect basic demographic
information about the participants using a short demographic data template. Interviews and
focus groups will take place in a secure, virtual environment (e.g. Skype, Microsoft Teams)
or via telephone at a time that is convenient to the participants. Where prior consent is given,
interviews and focus groups will be recorded through the relevant software platform (e.g.
using the recording feature in Microsoft Teams). Interpreters may also be used if requested
by participants. Focus groups may also be conducted asynchronously using online platforms
(e.g. focusgroupit.com), which have been used by other researchers and found to be helpful
(22). Interview and focus group recordings will be transcribed by professional transcribers
and pseudonymised before start of analysis. The transcriptions will be supplemented with
notes taken by the researchers during the interviews and focus groups.
Analysis Plan
Interview transcripts will be analysed using thematic analysis. Thematic analysis involves
identifying themes or patterns in the data, lending coherence and order to it (23). Following
Braun and Clarke’s six stages of thematic analysis, we will read and re-read the transcripts to
build familiarity with the data, generate initial codes to develop a coding framework, collate
codes into broad themes, review the themes, define and name themes and finally write up the
themes in a report form (24). We will primarily adopt an open inductive approach to develop
codes out of our data, but codes may also be developed from existing literature and/or
previously conducted research (23). Coding of data will be performed by the research team
using NVivo software, and three/four different members of the research team will triangulate

the coding process for credibility and rigour. Coding and theme development will be carried
out until data saturation is reached and no new themes are emerging.
Stakeholder Engagement Work Package (WP5)
The rich diversity of the UK-REACH research will be complemented by a robust stakeholder
involvement and engagement strategy, which has been in-built into the project (WP5) and
conforms to the principles of (i) being receptive of public views and opinions, (ii)
collaborating and co-creating with the public, and (iii) involving the public in wider
dissemination of results. Within this work package, a Stakeholder Group (UK-REACH
STAG) has been created to provide feedback and insights, and support in the formulation and
propagation of the project recommendations. The group has membership from a range of
partner stakeholder organisations such as the General Medical Council, Nursing and
Midwifery Council, Filipino Nurses Association-UK (FNAUK), and Association of Pakistani
Physicians in Northern Europe (APPNE). The group will meet virtually, once a month, until
the end of the project, and will be governed by a set of terms of reference (TOR). Group
meetings will be chaired by a nominated healthcare worker Chairperson/Deputy Chairperson,
and a member of the research team will help with the coordination. Common email forums
may also be created for the group members to share their views, opinions, and feedback
amongst each other outside of the periodic meetings. Progress with the delivery of other work
packages, and where needed input from a stakeholder perspective is sought through these
meetings. The stakeholder group’s primary approach is through informal consensus building
during the monthly meetings. Formal consensus approaches such as Delphi may be used if a
more challenging decision need arises during the implementation of the project or for the
purpose of optimising dissemination.

Views and opinions expressed by the group members will be aggregated, and individual
names will not appear in any of the published documents. Meeting minutes will only be
shared with the respective group members and on a need-to-know basis with members of the
research team. The UK-REACH STAG will also provide support in the dissemination of the
project recommendations.
PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
Public involvement has been a central tenet in the UK-REACH project since its early stages.
The project was developed in consultation and collaboration with national stakeholders
including the General Medical Council, Nursing and Midwifery Council, Royal Colleges and
ethnic minority HCW associations like British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin
(BAPIO). The public involvement and engagement component has been further streamlined
into the project with the creation of the Professional Expert Panel (PEP) comprising of
healthcare professionals in various roles and from different ethnic backgrounds. The group
members provide unique insight - relating to their professions and ethnic groups by virtue of
their lived experiences - to certain aspects of the project. The PEP meets virtually and has
provided inputs on the participant recruitment strategies for the different work packages, as
well as questionnaire for the cohort study, topic guides for WP3 and WP4, and other studyrelated documents (e.g., text within participant-facing items). We will continue to consult the
PEP on other matters, such as data collection, analysis, reporting and even dissemination, as
the project progresses.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION
Informed Consent
Prior to focus groups and interviews, potential participants will be given participant
information sheets (PIS), which will detail the nature of the research, objectives, and any
15

risks involved with participation. In light of COVID-19 constraints regarding face-to-face
interaction, consent will be sought digitally (i.e., via a secure internet portal) from the
participants and a downloadable version of the completed form will be available to
participants for their record. The right to decline to participate, and to withdraw consent at
any stage of the research, will be explicitly stated on both the PIS and in discussion with
potential participants. It will be explicitly stated that their signing of the consent form at no
point supersedes their right to withdraw from the study. For potential participants who seek
information in languages other than English, prior to them giving informed consent, efforts
will be made, wherever possible, to orally explain all study information (including
information sheets and consent forms) with support from an interpreter. The opportunity will
also be given before every interview and focus group for participants to ask any questions
about the scope of the research, or their rights as participants throughout the consent process.
Psychologically or emotionally distressing conversations
Whilst this study is low risk, particularly with respect to Work Packages 3-5, we recognise
that exploring and discussing experiences around COVID-19 and ethnicity (including issues
of stigmatisation, structural injustice or racism) could be distressing to participants. We aim
to manage this risk through the consent process, clearly explaining to individuals what the
study entails, and giving ample opportunities to question the process and decline to take part
if individuals wish. We also aim to make the interview process as comfortable as possible,
and ensure participants know they may stop, take a break, or decide to withdraw from the
interview and/or study at any point. The interview will always proceed at the comfort and
discretion of the participant.
Confidentiality and data protection

We will inform participants that participation will be confidential, and any personal
information collected will be anonymised. Interview transcripts relating to individuals will
also be pseudonymised using a unique numerical and date reference as the means to identify
individual data sets. Such a system will ensure the anonymity of the participants and allow
identification of individual data sets should a participant wish to exercise their individual
rights (such as access, rectification, or erasure). Individual data and transcripts will be held in
secure digital drives, and original recordings will be deleted after transcription. Access to the
full data set will only be provided to the members of the research team. The only
circumstance in which individual level data will be released is in the form of de-identified,
anonymised excerpts within the final publication, which is a standard procedure in qualitative
research of this type (25). The excerpts will take the form of words, sentences, and phrases
the participants have provided which exemplify the coding framework and themes generated
through the analysis.
Dissemination of Results and Recommendations
We will ensure that the findings from the Work Packages are reported rapidly and published
on our public facing website (www.uk-reach.org). We have also enlisted the support of our
stakeholders in disseminating the findings and recommendations through their organisational
websites, newsletters, internal communications, blogs, or social media channels like Twitter.
Following suggestions from our STAG members, we will also endeavour to make
recommendations available in other languages such as Welsh, for greater uptake. In addition,
we will make our findings available to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies
(SAGE) and other policymakers in a timely manner so that policy decisions can be made in
near real-time. As a topic of immense public health significance, we will also endeavour to
make our results available through print and electronic media. We will also publish the
outputs of this research in peer-reviewed journals in line with the University of Leicester’s

Open Access publication policy to enable us to share the results widely with the academic
community. We will also make presentations at relevant academic conferences as well as
non-academic events organised by our collaborators.
DISCUSSION
UK-REACH, led by the University of Leicester, is one of the first studies in the world that
sets out to understand why HCWs from minority ethnic backgrounds are disproportionately
affected by COVID-19 as compared to their White counterparts. While emerging evidence
from epidemiological studies are pointing to varied COVID-19 outcomes among different
ethnic groups, not much is known about the reasons behind this variation. The qualitative
Work Packages of the project, i.e., WPs 3 & 4, are expected to generate evidence which will
be crucial in understanding some of the ethnicity-linked risk factors in COVID-19. The aim
of the stakeholder engagement work package is to disseminate this evidence widely and in a
timely manner. Additionally, our Ethico-legal Work Package will generate important
guidance on ways to minimise risks associated with research participation, and best practices
in protecting the rights and interests of participants. We aim to increase knowledge about
access to support, and key coping mechanisms, which in turn will enable stakeholders to
protect the mental and physical health of ethnic minority staff in healthcare settings. We
appreciate the insights that stakeholders can bring into our project and have enlisted their
support from early-on to maximise our reach and impact. It is the ultimate hope that through
this project that we will gain clear insight into the differences in COVID-19 clinical
outcomes, professional practices, and well-being among ethnic minority and White HCWs, in
turn leading to a robust evidence basis for policymaking to improve the effects of COVID-19
on all HCWs across the UK.
