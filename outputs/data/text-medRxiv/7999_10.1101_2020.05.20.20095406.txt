Abstract

We explore the advantage of age-stratifying the population as an improvement on the quarantine-modified SEIR

model. We hypothesize that this would project lower cases of infection for the Philippines because of our

country’s low median age. We introduce the variable

Introduction

25

As COVID-19 rages around the world, modeling of the epidemic must be continuously validated against the

26

actual number of cases to help decision makers plan healthcare resource allocations. This scenario underscores

27

the importance of massive, inclusive diagnostic testing to get to the real number of cases in a locality.

28

The Q-SEIR model [1] is a compartmental model that estimates the number of susceptible ( ), exposed ( ),

29

infectious ( ) and removed ( ) individuals during an epidemic in a community ( ) with quarantine factor ( ).

30

The dynamics of this epidemic can be described by a system of differential equations

33

Parameters needed to run the model include:

is the

34

transmission rate (number of individuals who contract the disease per unit time),

35

symptoms of the disease to manifest on an individual (expressed as 1 person per units of time) and

36

rate (expressed as 1 person per units of time). This model does not consider vaccination and ignores the

37

population’s vital statistics since the epidemic may not linger long enough for natural births and deaths to be

38

influential. It also assumes removed as either recovery with permanent immunity or death.

) is a parameter that represents the effectiveness of quarantine, which can change over time. A value of 1

40

means that there is no quarantine and we regain the original SEIR model, while a value of 0.4 means that it is

41

60% effective. Implementing quarantine effectively reduces disease transmission: less people will be exposed

42

consequently lowering the number of infected individuals, delaying the peak, and flattening the epidemic curve

43

as expected. Using the Age Stratification method, for Quezon City, the projected peak number of infected cases

44

is 9.95% of the total population, while Q-SEIR projected 13.99% with

45

The Q-SEIR model assumes a homogeneous population where all individuals have the same probability of

46

becoming infected. However, in Hubei, China, the report [5] indicates that number of infected individuals

47

disproportionately occurs in higher age groups. We treat the age-stratified occurrences in Hubei as good proxies

48

for the infection probabilities per age group in Quezon City, Philippines. Thus, we now combine the Q-SEIR

model and the presumed age-stratified infection probability. We hypothesize that this would project a lower

50

number of infections for Quezon City because of the Philippines’ younger population. The number of infected

51

cases at the peak and the time of peaking using this model (Age-Stratified Q-SEIR, ASQ) will be compared with

Q-SEIR.

An early report [5] showed that COVID-19 has a higher infection occurrence among the older age groups and

72

those with comorbidities. As an improvement to the Q-SEIR, an age-stratification component was added (we

73

now call as ASQ) where the relative proportion of infected cases per age group proxies the infection probability.

Compared to Q-SEIR, the peak number of infected cases decreased from 5.79% to 3.47%. However, the peak

115

number of exposed cases increased from 12.31% to 14.42%. Younger age seems to be protective (lowers

116

infection) yet the higher proportion of younger individuals in a population increases exposure. This is the age-

117

stratification effect on a young population if the older age groups are more vulnerable. This principle is well-

118

illustrated by COVID-19 tests (Fig 4) and confirmed cases (Fig 5) from Hospital X, a government hospital from

119

the Philippines, undisclosed for privacy concerns. A young population effectively prolongs the incubation period,

120

very likely because of their better immune status and fewer risk factors such as diabetes and cardiovascular

121

diseases.

Conclusion

129

The ASQ model gives a much lower estimate on peak number of infected cases by 65.2% (3.46% vs 9.95%)

130

compared with age-stratification alone; and by 75.2% (3.46% vs 13.99%) compared with Q-SEIR alone. We

131

think this is because the median age of the Quezon City population is at a distance younger from the most

132

vulnerable age group.
