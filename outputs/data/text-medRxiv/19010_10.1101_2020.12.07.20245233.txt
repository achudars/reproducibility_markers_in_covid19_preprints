Abstract
Introduction: Proactive prediction of the epidemiologic dynamics of viral diseases and
outbreaks of the likes of COVID-19 has remained a difficult pursuit for scientists, public
health researchers, and policymakers. It is unclear whether RT-PCR Cycle Threshold (Ct)
values of COVID-19—or any other virus—as indicator of viral load, could represent a
possible predictor for underlying epidemiologic changes on a population level.

Objectives: To investigate whether population-wide changes in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Ct
values over time are associated with the daily fraction of positive COVID-19 tests. In
addition, this study analyses the factors that could influence the RT-PCR Ct values.

Method: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 63,879 patients from May
4, 2020 to September 30, 2020, in all COVID-19 facilities in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Data
collected included number of tests and newly diagnosed cases, as well as Ct values, age,
gender nationality, and symptomatic status.

Results: Ct values were found to be negatively and very weakly correlated with the fraction
of daily positive cases in the population r = -0.06 (CI95%: -0.06; -0.05; p=0.001). The R-squared
for the regression model (adjusting for age and number of daily tests) showed an accuracy of
45.3%. Ct Values showed an association with nationality (p=0.012). After the stratification,
the association between Ct values and the fraction of daily positive cases was only
maintained for the female gender and Bahraini-nationality. Symptomatic presentation was
significantly associated with lower Ct values (higher viral loads). Ct values do not show any
correlation with age (p=0.333) or gender (p=0.522).

Conclusion: We report one of the first and largest studies to investigate the epidemiologic
associations of Ct values with COVID-19. Ct values offer a potentially simple and widely
accessible tool to predict and model epidemiologic dynamics on a population level. More
population studies and predictive models from global cohorts are necessary.

Introduction
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has ravaged the world by surprise over a
period of half a year. According to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) report on 7
November 2020, there were 48,534,508 confirmed cases and 1,231,017 deaths worldwide,
with 82786 confirmed cases and 328 deaths reported in Bahrain. When discussing the
epidemiology of a virus, a thorough understanding of its transmission is necessary. SARSCoV-2, the causative agent of Covid19, primary mode of transmission is through respiratory
droplets and direct or indirect contact routes1. This occurs when a person is in close contact
with infected person who has respiratory symptoms or exchanges in droplet-expelling
processes such as talking or singing. The non-infected individual thus exposes their mucosa
and conjunctiva to SARS-CoV-2 infected droplets. Indirect contact through fomites may also
be a source of infection when transferred from surfaces that have been contaminated with
infected droplets, to the mouth, nose, or eyes. Although the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2
doesn’t support airborne transmission in public settings, an increasing number of publications
are pointing to such route. Other less common routes for infection may include different
bodily fluids (e.g. sexual, faeces, and blood). The exact role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission in the COVID-19 outbreak is not fully comprehended as of yet, but
is believed to have an important contribution to the viruses’ rapid spread. SARS-CoV-2 RNA
may be detected 1-3 days prior to symptom onset. The viral load is highest around the day of
symptom onset, followed by a gradual decline over time. RT-PCR positivity may last for 1-2
weeks in the case of asymptomatic patients, and up to 3 weeks for those with mild to
moderate disease2.
It is important to differentiate between viral load and infectious dose, and the interrelated implications of both. The infectious dose of a virus is the dose at which if a person is
exposed to it would be sufficient to cause an infection. On the other hand, viral load is the
amount of virus particles that the infected patient carries in their system. The higher the viral
load of a patient, the more virus is shed, which therefore leads to a higher chance of others
being exposed to the infectious dose needed to acquire the disease. As with viruses in
general, the viral load of COVID-19 patient can be deduced from the Cycle threshold (Ct)
value of the RT-PCR test conducted on the obtained sample. The RT-PCR test amplifies the
viral RNA from the patient’s sample until it is at a detectable concentration that exceeds the
threshold value. The number of cycles necessary for that to take place is known as the Ct
value. Thus, the lower the Ct value of a patient’s sample, the higher the viral load, whereas

the higher it is the lower the viral load3. According to one study, patients with severe
symptoms presented with 60 times higher viral load and prolonged viral shedding than
patients with mild symptoms, which may indicate a role for viral load not only in diagnosis,
but rather prognosis and transmission/contagiousness. Studies showed that lower Ct values
were associated with a higher probability of a positive viral culture. In one study, infectivity
(defined as growth in cell culture) was significantly reduced when RT-PCR Ct values were
over 244. On the other hand, La Scola et al. (2020) have reported that patients with Ct values
≥34 are non-infectious and can be discharged from hospitals or care centers5. The
implications of Ct values or viral load, if any, on the collective population from an
epidemiologic perspective has not been adequately studied yet.
Proactive forecasting of the disease’s epidemiology has remained a distant desire and
puzzling enigma for scientists, public health researchers, and policymakers. Unlike previous
outbreaks, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has transcended the medical and clinical
setting, bringing forth major global disruption to public life in the social and professional
settings, as well as serious economic repercussions on national and global levels 6. Countries’
deployment of their health resources and response preparedness has also been a source of
concern, due to the unexpected nature and trajectorial development of the pandemic7. For
these reasons, the prediction or forecasting of an upcoming surge in COVID-19 cases is an
important item on the agenda of the scientific community and decision-makers. The daily
number of positive cases on a global level has been widely variable. For instance, September
1st, 2020, has witnessed the highest number of positive COVID-19 cases since the beginning
of the outbreak with 439,070 cases. The day previous, however, recorded 264,107 cases,
while the day after recorded only 170,846; the lowest since the 30th of June. Forecasting
attempts have been utilized to a fair degree of accuracy so far. The US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes multiple forecasts modelled by independent
institutions, predicting the daily number of new cases in the USA. The models use a variety
of data types besides those directly related to COVID-19, including demographic and
mobility data, as well as different methods and estimates of the impact of public health
interventions/policies and how these levels of precautions will change8. The previous
forecasts when compared to actual data do fairly well in terms of general trend and values to
be expected9. However; the multivariable models are fairly complex and may not be readily
available for use in other countries.

Therefore, this study objective is to investigate whether population-wide changes in
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Ct values over time, are correlated with the number of new COVID19 cases in the future. Our hypothesis is based on that higher viral load indicates increased
viral shedding, increased risk of exposure to an infectious dose, and thus a higher degree of
transmissibility. Hence, a decrease in Ct value could predict an increase or a surge in the
number of positive cases. In order to develop a predictive model, other epidemiological
factors associated with Ct values were also investigated. The ability to predict population
changes in the number of COVID-19 positive cases ahead of time using a widely available
and simple metric can be very helpful. Public health measures and policies can be proactively
tailored to control and manage the outbreak in an informed and prophylactic manner.

Methods
Study Population & Data Collection:
A retrospective study was conducted on 63,879 patients from May 4, 2020 to
September 30, 2020, in all COVID-19 facilities in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Data on the
number of tests and newly diagnosed cases were obtained from the National COVID-19 Task
force’s centralized database. Data collected included age, sex, nationality, symptomatic
status. Ct Values from newly diagnosed cases in this time period were obtained from the
corresponding medical records.

Diagnosis and SARS-Cov-2 RNA Amplification:
All cases were diagnosed as COVID 19 based on RT-PCR tests of nasopharyngeal
samples. The nasopharyngeal samples were transferred to a viral transport media immediately
after collection and transported to a COVID-19 laboratory for testing. Diagnosed cases were
a heterogeneous sample of tested patients, including symptomatic individuals, close contacts,
travelers, healthcare worker screening, and random population testing. The RT-PCR tests
were conducted using different kits : Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) TaqPath 1Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (catalog number A15299), SuperScript™ III Platinum™
One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (catalog number 11732020), LightMix1 Modular SARS-CoV
(COVID19) (TIB MOLBIOL, Berlin, Germany). The RT-PCR was conducted on the Applied
Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 7500 Fast Dx RealTime PCR Instrument, LightCycler® 480
Instrument II (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc). The assay used targeted the E gene. If

positive, the sample was confirmed by RdRP and N genes. The E gene Ct value was reported
and used in this study. Ct Values >40 were considered negative.

RT-qPCR Analytical Validation:
Positive and negative controls were included for quality control purposes. Linear range
was determined using serial log10 dilutions of standard RNA and was established between 3·5
x 103 to 3·5 x 1012 copies of RNA/mL, with amplification efficiency of 87% and with a
regression R2 value higher than 0.99.

3. Data Handling and Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The
sample size was not calculated as this was a pilot study. Mean and standard deviation (SD) for
all variables were given as descriptive statistics. Continuous variables were calculated between
groups by means and SDs and frequencies. Categorical variables were reported as frequencies
and percentages. The data was grouped into a daily set consisting of 150 days, and a weekly
set, consisting of 21 equal weeks starting on May 4th and ending on September 27th.
According to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test, all variables were normally
distributed. The main endpoint was assessed with the Pearson’s correlation analysis,
subsequently stratified for gender and nationality. Linear regression analysis was applied in
order to identify the best prediction model for identify the new daily cases, including as
regressors, Ct values, new daily tests and age.

Ethics Approval
The study was approved by the National COVID-19 Research and ethics committee, code
number: CRT-COVID2020-082.

Results
Characteristics of the Study Population:
The total number of positive cases identified between May 4, 2020 and September 30,
2020 (5-month period) was 63,883. Mean age of the individuals was 34.02 years (±16.403),
with a male-majority (67.24%, n=42953). Bahrainis represented majority of the cohort
(53.68%). Only 35.25% (n = 22,519) of the cohort was symptomatic. The mean number of
tests conducted per day was 9140 tests (± 1860), while the mean number of newly diagnosed

cases per day was 493 (± 142). Mean proportion of positive tests was therefore 5.43% (±
1.29). The mean Ct values of the population is 25.49 (95%CI: 25.45 - 25.52). Minimum
recorded Ct value was 10.16, while the maximum was 40.38. The weighted mean Ct value in
the 25th percentile was 22, and 28.89 in the 75th percentile. Table 1 summarizes the sample
characteristics.

Primary Endpoint: Relationship between Ct Value and New Dailey Cases:
Analysis of the association between Ct values and ratio of new daily cases to daily
tests (percentage of positive cases), reveals a significant correlation coefficient of -0.06
(95%CI: -0.06 to -0.05, p<0.001) (Figure1).

Factors Affecting Ct Value:
Analysis of the association between Ct values and patients’ age returned a nonsignificant Pearson correlation (r = 0.00, p = 0.455) (Figure 2). Nationality was found to be
significantly associated with Ct value as illustrated in Figure 3. Bahraini nationals had
significantly higher mean Ct values than their non-Bahraini/expat counterparts (25.53 vs
25.44, p = 0.014). As for gender, no association was found with Ct values (Figure 4).
However, males did report a lower Ct value on average compared to females (25.48 vs
25.510, p = 0.522). Finally, symptomatic status was found to be significantly associated with
lower Ct values (p = 0.001), when compared to asymptomatic status (24.93 vs 25.79) (Figure
5).

Predictive Model Parameter Identification:
A regression model on association between Ct values (predictor) and new daily cases
(outcome) was also conducted (Table 2, Figure 6). The covariates included age and daily
tests. Pearson’s correlation returned a strong r value of 0.673, and an r2 of 0.453. The model’s
level of prediction was 45.3%. Table 2 shows the regression model, where Ct value had a
significant negative correlation with new daily cases (coef = -1.82, p<0.001). Daily tests was
positively correlated with daily new cases (coef = 0.05, p<0.001). Age was not found to be
associated with new daily cases.

Development of the Predictive Model:
Based on the linear regression analysis, the equation for the prediction of the new daily cases
is:
New Daily Cases = 65.88+ (-1.81 x Mean Ct Value) + (0.05 x Mean Daily Tests)
When analyzing the relationship between Ct values and ratio of positive tests while
stratifying for nationality, the significance of the correlation varies. A negative correlation
was found between Bahraini cases (p = 0.001) only. Additionally, when stratifying for
gender, the relationship was found to be negative and significant in females (r = -0.1,
p=0.001), but lower and non-significant in men (r = -0.03, p = 0.459).

Discussion
The correlation between RT-PCR Ct values in an infected sample of the population
and a change in the overall number of positive cases over time, has not been reported in the
literature to date. In this study, Ct values were used as an indicator of viral load and
transmissibility. Considering that positive cases with low Ct values have a higher viral load
than cases with high Ct values, and that a higher viral load leads to an increase in viral
shedding and thus contagiousness in a population, it is reasonable to expect that a decrease in
population Ct values would correlate with a surge in cases.
To begin with, our study reported a male to female sex ratio of 2.05:1. This ratio is
much higher than the ratio of 1.03:1, reported by the WHO’s global case-based surveillance
system10. This is mainly due the fact that the 47% of infected cases during the studied period
were Non-Bahraini, with majority of whom belong to labor camps, which have a male
majority. Moreover, this may also be driven by cultural norms, with males more likely to
socially mix outdoors and thus be infected. This may also be related to the higher percentage
of males in the population (62.6%), with a male to female ratio of 1.67:111.
Of the cohort, only 35.25% were symptomatic, with 64.75% presenting
asymptomatically, one of the highest asymptomatic rates reported in literature to date12. The
symptom status for these cases was documented upon testing and upon triage; hence a subset
of the asymptomatic cases might be further classified as presymptomatic. The prevalence of
asymptomatic patients is very difficult to assert, a meta-analysis of 50,155 cases from 41
studies suggests that it may account for 15.6% (95% CI, 10.1%‐23.0%) of SARS-CoV-2
infections13. The prevalence reported in our cohort may be higher for a number of reasons,
including more open screening policies and comprehensive contact tracing. It may also be

associated with other factors inherent to cohort characteristics, such as age (which is on the
low-end of reported means14) and comorbidities. It is worth noting that our study found a
correlation between lower Ct values and symptomatic presentation, however the mean Ct
value difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic was 0.86 which may not be a
clinically significant difference. It may be suggested that a higher asymptomatic prevalence
could be indicative of more well-controlled isolation measures leading to a lower viral
transmission in the population. It must be noted however that since this is a cross-sectional
study of a specific point in time, that some of the cases may be pre-symptomatic rather
asymptomatic. Regardless, the prevalence would still be higher than that reported in other
cohorts15.
According to our findings, as hypothesized, RT-PCR Ct values seemed to be
negatively correlated with the number of daily cases. In other words, the lower the Ct value,
the higher the fraction of new positive tests in the population. Similarly, a recent populationbased study (pre-print) from Massachusetts, USA, has identified a relationship between the
population-level cross-sectional distribution of Ct values and the growth rate of the epidemic.
The data was used to successfully develop an accurate inference model of the outbreak’s
trajectory16. A surveillance study from Italy has also reported a significant increase in Ct
values over three different consecutive epidemic periods, indicating a possible association
with underlying epidemiologic dynamics17. Considering evidence showing that every 1-unit
increase in Ct values demonstrates a 0.64 odds ratio for positive viral culture (95% CI; 0.49–
0.84; P < .001)18, it would be reasonable to infer that the association of lower Ct with a surge
in cases is driven by increased viral infectivity in the population. In support of this
hypothesis, one study from Singapore found that surface contamination from admitted
patients declined with increasing Ct values and duration of illness. No correlation however
was found between Ct values of clinical samples and Ct values of environmental samples
across days of illness19.
Upon stratification by demographic factors, the association between lower Ct values
and increase in fraction of positive tests remains the case for all ages, females, and Bahraininationality, but does not apply to Males and Non-Bahraini nationalities in our cohort.
Possible justifications for these observations are multi-factorial. First, regarding Ct values not
being correlated with proportion of positive tests in non-Bahrainis, this may be attributed to
the unique characteristics and confounders of this sub-group and the associated targeted
public health measures. The large majority of non-Bahrainis in our cohort are composed of
migrant workers. A number of observations were made early on in the outbreak that made

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.07.20245233; this version posted December 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this

this sub-group stand out, keeping in mind the often-characteristic background of a lower
socioeconomic status. Notably, it was observed that the symptom threshold at which this subgroup would present to the healthcare services was much higher than the Bahraini subgroup.
Furthermore, living areas of migrant workers where targeted for COVID-19 screening, often
finding whole buildings of positive cases; this may have also been a major contributing factor
to the statistically significant higher prevalence of low Ct values in this subgroup. Keeping
both of these unique observations in mind, the identification of a correlation via comparison
of changes in Ct values and number of cases may have been diluted by the skewed
homogenous nature of this subgroup. Furthermore, this subgroup was exposed to unique and
intensive public health campaigns that attempted to reduce the household cluttering of
migrant workers, and provide health education and awareness. This was largely effective,
approaching a standardized state between Bahraini and non-Bahraini subgroups towards the
end of the study period. As such, it is clear from our observations that the non-Bahraini
subgroup presents with unique, multifactorial confounders and potential factors that may
have affected and differentiated the association between Ct value and number of cases. In
fact, biologic and genetic/epigenetic factors may have also been at play.
As for the finding regarding the male gender not being associated with Ct value and
number of cases, this may be attributed to three main possibilities. The first, and most likely,
is that the large majority of non-Bahraini migrant workers were male, which bring us back to
the confounders associated with this subgroup. The second possibility is related to the social
behaviors of males, who are more likely to mix outside and contract the virus, and less likely
to work from home; this may also provide an explanation to the higher prevalence of low Ct
values in this subgroup, although not statistically significant. Differences in health behaviors
between males and females may also have played a role. Finally, the third possibility would
be related to a biologic difference between both sexes. The mechanism of such factors and
how they may be related, if at all, remains unclear. More studies in different cohorts while
accounting for confounders may help develop a fuller picture.
It is also important to consider that the mean Ct value for the cohort was 25.49
(95%CI: 25.45 - 25.52). As such, the Ct values remained largely stable and within a very
tight confidence interval, with no statistically significant weekly changes over the time
period. The lack of major changes may have not allowed us to view all associations between
Ct values and positive cases to the extent to which they may be intertwined in reality, which
may have surfaced at a specific threshold or degree of difference. On the other hand, it is also
important to consider that the time between testing and acquiring of infection varies from

every individual. Therefore, a patient may have acquired a COVID-19 infection during a
period of low Ct values in the population clusters, but was only tested positive a while after,
when the corresponding Ct values had increased.
Although lower Ct values indicate a higher viral load and thus increased
infectiousness, which would be expected to be associated with a surge in cases as was shown
in our data, it is important to consider the confounding nature of symptomatic status. For one,
asymptomatic status can lead to increased transmission compared to symptomatic, because
symptomatic individuals are able to identify themselves self-isolate and get tested as soon as
possible. Since asymptomatic cases also had statistically significant higher Ct values
according to our findings, it is important to consider that the association between Ct values
and infectivity on a population scale may be even more significant than reported.
Furthermore, all COVID-19 cases had their Ct values reported to the COVID-19 taskforce.
Therefore, those with lower Ct values might have had more aggressive tracing and
management, which can indirectly contribute to lowering infectivity from that individual.
Regarding asymptomatic cases presenting with higher Ct values, this may be
attributed to a pathophysiologic mechanism whereas a higher Ct value, and thus lower viral
load, may decrease or dampen the symptomatic presentation of said infected patient. It is
important to also consider that asymptomatic individuals may have had higher Ct values due
to being identified at a later time since infection compared to symptomatic individuals. It has
been reported that Ct values increases over illness duration20.
Change in COVID-19 cases is largely multifactorial, affected by a number of factors
that include testing policies, public health measures, population behavior and compliance,
religious/cultural events/holidays, reopening strategies and viral factors21. For these reasons,
Ct values alone may not be useful in predicting a change in COVID-19 cases, despite our
study showcasing an association between these variables. However, they may still be of
benefit as part of a multivariable model: Especially one that takes into consideration
individual characteristics (e.g. symptomatic status, demographic conditions) as related to
individual behavior, and population characteristics (e.g. public health policies) as related to
population behavior (e.g. compliance to regulations). Additionally, meticulous contact
tracing, testing, and quarantining may have contributed to maintaining the Ct values in the
middle, with the majority being between Ct 20 and 30.
Regardless, whether these findings would be clinically relevant is debatable. This
reaffirms that disease progression is multifactorial. However, it may be more useful as a
metric to use as part of a more diverse tool. Additionally, since healthcare professionals

interact with infected patients, extra precautions may be justified in the case of patients with
lower Ct values, as they would shed more virus particles and are more likely to be more
infectious22. Additionally, this may help with deciding which patients are better isolated or
placed in negative pressure rooms. The main applications of Ct values however would be best
concentrated as epidemiologic/public health and forecasting efforts.
From a public health perspective, knowing that average viral loads may be associated
with surge in cases and with a more symptomatic presentation, supports the importance of
decreasing viral exposure and the gradual nature of infection. This is in contrast to adopting
an “all-or-none” attitude of completely eliminating potential exposure. For example, this
would translate to emphasizing that the more socially distanced people are, the lower the
chance of acquiring COVID-19, as opposed to 6-feet social distancing being reiterated. This
may especially be of importance in public campaigns, reinforcing the importance of
maximizing distance and minimizing contact and interaction, rather than only reiterating
specific instructions for what should and should not be done to avoid contacting COVID-19.
Despite this being one of the largest cohorts on COVID-19 in the region, and the
largest to investigate Ct values in relation to case trajectory, the limitations are important to
be addressed. To begin with, although this is a multi-center analysis, it remains a national one
in a small country. National public health measures and screening policies differ from one
place to the other, which necessitates the need for a global cohort when investigating the
macro-behaviors and characteristics of COVID-19. The Ct values as reported in our study
have been fairly stable throughout the five-month period from a statistical standpoint, which
would make it non-ideal to test for associations between Ct values and case trajectory. For
that reason, longer periods or cohorts from different populations may be more suitable to
investigate an association. Screening policies additionally play a vital role in determining the
cohort characteristics. Our study involved cases from varying screening approaches,
including admitted patients, symptomatic suspected cases in outpatient setting, contact
tracing, population screening in case of travel, random testing in the community and
individual-requested testing. In order to minimize bias and confounding factors, ideally only
cohorts from randomized population screening should be included. This would also help
control the number of tests conducted per day. The different frequencies of testing may have
impacted the proportion of positive cases identified per day, contributing to the change in
cases in a way that conflicts with Ct values as the intended independent variable.
Additionally, public health measures changed reactively throughout the study period, which

likely impacted the transmission of the virus in the population in a way that would be difficult
to account for.
Furthermore, human bias in tracking down the cases with lower Ct values may have
skewed the findings. Additionally, The Ct values can vary depending on how the sample has
been collected. For instance, a poorly collected nasopharyngeal swab can have very high Ct
values, thus leading to biased findings regarding infectiousness or disease severity. Ct values
are also determined by the technical competence of the person performing the test, calibration
of equipment, and analytical skills of the interpreters, all of which could have impacted the
results. Furthermore, inconsistency in Ct values can result from irregular amplification
efficiency which has been observed even when using the same commercial kit; hence, it is
recommended to locally determine the limit of detection (LoD) of our tests. To add to that,
double delta Ct values were not used in our study, which would have been a more
standardized method to report viral loads across different PCR kits and machines. The
retrospective observational study design is also in itself an important limitation. Time from
symptom onset is also an important variable that could be a confounding factor, however the
data on it was difficult to collect. Other confounding variables influencing both Ct values and
newly identified cases were difficult to completely account for in the analysis.

Conclusion
The spread of a viral disease of the like of COVID-19 in a population is
multifactorial. Public health measures, testing protocols, population compliance, and viral
factors all play a role in the degree of transmission, rate of positive cases, and epidemiologic
trajectory. Understanding the correlations of a simple, commonly available measure like Ct
values with epidemiologic variables and patient demographics may pave the road for the
development of tools to forecast a pandemic’s behavior. Our first-of-its-kind and largest-todate retrospective multicenter national study points towards a possible correlation between Ct
values and the ratio of positive tests in a population. Additionally, symptomatic status was
associated with a lower Ct value. This reaffirms the need to develop multivariable models to
forecast viral pandemics, possibly including Ct values. Similar studies of a large magnitude
in different countries may be able to shed more light on this top

Table 2. Regression model on the association between Ct values and New daily cases. Model
adjusted for regressors: age, new daily tests. The level of prediction of this model is 45.3%,
while the Pearson’s correlation coefficient is considered good r=0.673. In this regression
model, the age is not associated with the new daily cases, while the associated factors were the
Ct values and the number of daily tests. The linear regression equation for the prediction of the
new daily cases is: y = (new daily cases) = 65.88+ Ct value *(-1.81)+ daily tests*(0.05).
