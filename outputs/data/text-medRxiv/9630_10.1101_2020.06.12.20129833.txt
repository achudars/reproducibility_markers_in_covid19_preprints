Following successful widespread non-pharmaceutical interventions aiming
to control COVID-19, many jurisdictions are moving towards reopening
economies and borders. Given that little immunity has developed in most populations, re-establishing higher contact rates within and between populations
carries substantial risks. Using a Bayesian epidemiological model, we estimate
the leeway to reopen in a range of national and regional jurisdictions that have
experienced different COVID-19 epidemics. We estimate the risks associated
with different levels of reopening and the likely burden of new cases due to introductions from other jurisdictions. We find widely varying leeway to reopen,
high risks of exceeding past peak sizes, and high possible burdens per introduced case per week, up to hundreds in some jurisdictions. We recommend a
cautious approach to reopening economies and borders, coupled with strong
monitoring for changes in transmission.

emerged at the end of 2019, has to date caused a global pandemic with over 7 million confirmed
cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 408,000 deaths worldwide as of June 9,
2020 [1]. To date, there is no vaccine or cure, and it appears that asymptomatic individuals
can be infectious. Accordingly, wide-ranging non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such
as hand hygiene, face masks, physical (social) distancing, banning mass gatherings, and strict
lockdowns have been among the primary tools for reducing COVID-19’s spread [2–6].
As a result, incidence in many jurisdictions outside China followed a similar pattern
(e.g., Fig. 1B–M). After an initial phase of occasional detection (typically during late January
to February and commonly due to imported cases), case counts grew rapidly (typically during early March). At this point, NPIs were put in place, in the form of “lockdowns” or other
requirements for social and physical distancing. Case counts generally continued to rise for
several weeks until the impact of NPIs became observable as a flattening and then decline of
the epidemic curve. The economic, social, and health costs of NPIs have been significant.
Following declines in incidence, many jurisdictions are now beginning to partially lift restrictions, reopen their economies, and are allowing travel across regional and international
boundaries [7–9]. Here, care must be taken not to undo the benefits of widespread NPIs. This
is especially true given that large studies undertaken in high-prevalence settings do not indicate that herd immunity has been reached [10]. However, the degree of flexibility, or ”leeway”,
that exists to increase activity without causing a major resurgence or “second wave” of cases is
largely unknown. The flexibility that exists in a given location is dependent on the local circumstances governing transmission, as well as the restrictions that are currently in place [11, 12]. It
is essential to estimate the risk associated with increased social and economic activity, and to
understand this risk within and between particular jurisdictions, before making decisions around
reopening.
We propose that discussions of COVID-19 risk in the context of reopening local economic
activity, and of reopening borders and trade, should consider three aspects of transmission dynamics: (1) the probability that infections are rising at the current time in a jurisdiction, even if
reported cases are declining; (2) the probability that a given increase in social and economic activity in the general population will lead to a substantial growth in cases over the coming weeks,
and (3)—with regards to travel and border reopening—the number of introduced cases and their
likely impact in the destination. Using a mathematical model fit to local case data for a selection
of jurisdictions with differing epidemics, we estimate the leeway for reopening without causing
increasing COVID-19 cases, and the probabilities that reopening will lead to cases increasing
above thresholds after a fixed time. The model reflects a portion of the population engaging
in distancing and related measures: these individuals are at reduced risk of encountering infectious individuals, and are less likely to be encountered themselves—for example because they
are able to work from home, consistently wear masks, or avoid social situations (see Methods).
For each of 12 jurisdictions worldwide, selected for their diversity of epidemic trajectories
and NPIs, we first estimate the impact to date of widespread NPIs and then calculate how close
the estimated contact rate is to the threshold for epidemic growth (Figs 1, S2, S3). We estimate
this both in the period immediately following NPI measures (late March to the end of April)

and after May 1, as some jurisdictions have already begun to reopen as of the time of writing.
We refer to these time frames as “post-measures” and “recent” and use the idea of leeway to
describe the room between their current state and the threshold beyond which cases would begin
to grow.
We find that after initial NPI measures took effect, some jurisdictions had substantial leeway
to re-open (Japan, New Zealand, Germany, New York, British Columbia, and Belgium), with an
above-0.99 probability that contact rates were below 80% of the threshold for epidemic growth.
Japan and New Zealand had the most leeway, with contact rates well below half the threshold.
In contrast, some had little leeway (the United Kingdom (UK), Washington, and Ontario) and
some had none, as cases were still rising (Quebec, Sweden, and California). Estimates for the
period after May 1 find that some jurisdictions have little or no leeway for further re-opening
(California, Sweden, Washington, Ontario) as they are at or above the critical threshold. Some
have used part of their leeway already (Japan, Germany, and New York, and British Columbia;
Fig. 1A). Several have more leeway than they did immediately after NPI measures took effect
(Belgium, the UK, and Quebec, with Quebec now well below the threshold and the UK now
with > 0.99 probability of being < 80% of the threshold). New Zealand has so few cases that
estimation with this modelling framework leaves considerable uncertainty.
We forecast the impact of relaxing distancing measures by increasing contact rates, starting
from a baseline of the lower of the post-measures and recent estimates (Fig. 1B–M). The UK,
Belgium, and Quebec moved to stricter control after May 1. All have some leeway as of the
time of writing, though increasing contact beyond 60% above the recent estimate would likely
lead to a growing epidemic in the UK and Quebec. Belgium has substantial leeway to re-open.
The remaining jurisdictions have used some of their leeway already. Those with little to no
leeway to begin with now show rapid increases if contact is increased (California, Sweden,
Washington, and Ontario). British Columbia had some leeway to re-open and has done so; a
doubling of contact compared to the post-measures baseline would likely lead to rises in case
numbers. Germany, New York, New Zealand, and Japan show low risks of rising cases. These
results are robust to assumptions about the duration of infection and reasonable priors on the
fraction of individuals distancing (Fig. S4).
Rising case numbers may be tolerable, depending on the costs and severity of measures
needed to keep cases in check, the capacity of the health care system to cope with increases in
COVID-19 cases, and a population’s preference regarding the balance of widespread measures
vs. increases in incidence. Policy makers could factor into their decision-making the probability
and time frame of new cases that may arise following reopening. Fig. 2 shows our estimates of
the probability of exceeding the peak number of cases to date, and the probability of reaching
1 incident reported case per 20,000 individuals under different increases in contact rates (again
from a baseline of the time period in which control was stricter). Given similar increases in
contact rate, Ontario, Washington, Sweden, and California are most likely to exceed both 1
incident case per 20,000 and their historical peaks in the coming 6 weeks. The UK has a small
risk of exceeding its previous peak (probability of 0.06 with a doubling of contact rates from
the post-measures period). New York, the UK, and Quebec have some risk of exceeding 1 case

Figure 1: Projected cases given scenarios of relaxed control measures strongly depend on
the leeway between the estimated contact rate and the threshold for increase. A: Posterior
densities of the ratio between the contact rate and the threshold (the value above which exponential increases are expected). Darker violins represent the post-measures period and paler dotted
violins represent the recent (post May 1) estimates. Jurisdictions with contacts well below the
threshold have more leeway to relax control measures. B–M: Model fits and projections at 6
multiplicative contact rate increases, from a baseline from the lower of the estimates from the
two time periods. Solid lines represent posterior medians and ribbons represent 90% credible
intervals. Dots and thin lines represent reported case data. Vertical grey bands indicate 90%
credible intervals for the start and end times of initial control measures ramp. Dashed vertical
lines indicate the start of the “recent” period (May 1). The choice to project from a baseline of
the lower of the post-measures and recent estimates means that projections are based on measures at the stricter time period in all jurisdictions. Regions are arranged by decreasing mean
threshold ratio in the immediate post-measures period.

There is pressure to reopen borders to business and leisure travelers due to the social and
economic costs of travel restrictions. We modelled the impact of introducing imported cases at
a constant rate to estimate the impact on total cases in each jurisdiction, taking uncertainty in
the contact ratios (and other posterior estimated quantities; see Supplementary Information) into
account (Fig. 3). Our results illustrate the expected extra cases resulting from one imported case
per week over six weeks. Assuming independence of imported cases, these results can be scaled
to realistic rates of importation (e.g., for 100 imported cases, multiply expected extra cases by
100). In Japan, where the dynamics are well below the threshold in all posterior samples, each
importation results in few additional cases. Meanwhile, in California or Sweden, because there
is a high posterior probability that transmission is above the threshold, introduced cases are
more likely to cause extended chains of transmission and contribute large case volumes. The
result is that up to approximately 100 new cases may result (over six weeks) from a weekly
introduction of a single case. Fig. 3 is generated under the assumption that introduced cases
join the general population, have access to its testing and control procedures, and engage in its
broader distancing and NPI behaviors, making these conservative projections.

Extra cases after 6 weeks with
1 pre−symptomatic infectious
traveller per week

Figure 3: Cases resulting from one import per week over 6 weeks range from fewer than
ten to hundreds and depend on contact in the destination population. Dots represent medians and thick and thin line segments represent 50% and 90% credible intervals; the x-axis is
log distributed. Contact rate increases are based on the lower of the post-measures and recent
contact ratio estimates. Regions are ordered by the average extra cases across contact rate increases. Extra cases are compared to a projection that does not include weekly imports; travelers
themselves have not been removed from the totals.

To interpret these results with reference to borders and travel requires consideration of the
specific jurisdictions involved. Consider a border opening from jurisdiction A to jurisdiction B.
If both jurisdictions are well below their thresholds, then the probability of a large volume of
new cases resulting from introductions is low, primarily because general transmission will be
prevented in jurisdiction B, but also because prevalence is likely to be low in A, though this
depends on the epidemic, testing, reporting, and population dynamics in A. If the destination
is near its threshold, then introduced cases could result in exponential growth in B. This effect
could be amplified if travelers join a congregate setting or are less socially distanced than the

general population due to tourism or work activities, or if they have reduced access to local
health care and control measures such as contact tracing. In addition, if jurisdiction A is near its
own threshold, then there may be as-yet-unobserved exponential growth of cases in A, affecting
the rate of introduction to B. Furthermore, travel itself may result in additional transmissions.
The COVID-19 pandemic has seen an unprecedented number of travel restrictions and border measures, in spite of WHO recommendations against unnecessary closures, weak evidence
that these are effective in preventing pandemic influenza [13] (though they do reduce spread and
buy time [14]), and concerns about their impact on movement of medical supplies and personnel [15]. There is now some discussion of “travel bubbles” in which countries or jurisdictions
experiencing comparable levels of risk open borders to travel and commerce [16]. As jurisdictions with low case numbers move to reopen their economies (likely causing the epidemic
threshold as measures are relaxed), they will be at renewed risk of introductions. We suggest
that the highest-risk borders arise when a source jurisdiction has prevalent cases and the destination jurisdiction is near or above its threshold, or reopening to the extent that cases could now
spread widely despite earlier successes. Due to variations in testing, we cannot know the relative prevalence [17], but we would predict, among the locations in our study, that introductions
into California, Sweden, Ontario, and Washington carry the highest risk, followed by the UK.
Interactions among these jurisdictions would carry the highest risk, despite that by some indicators the overall COVID-19 control in several of these is similar. Interactions among the UK,
Quebec, BC, NY, Germany, and Belgium are lower risk but the probability of causing dozens
of new cases per introduced case per week remains considerable. Furthermore, jurisdictions
with small historical peaks (e.g., British Columbia, New Zealand) could easily be put in a position of exceeding their historical peak as a result of introduced cases from a region with higher
prevalence.
The model and underlying data have limitations. The data are provided by jurisdictions
and depend on testing protocols and capacity, delays to reporting, different base populations
being tested, and other variations [18]. Indeed, this motivates using inferred summaries like
the leeway, in lieu of direct comparisons of case counts. Our approach accounts as much as
possible for differences in testing through time, for the local dynamics of distancing behavior,
and different starting intensity and timing of different epidemics. However, our model estimates
are oriented towards widespread NPI and distancing measures, and implicitly attribute changes
in case dynamics to contact rates. In truth, transmission dynamics involve a complex function
of outbreak control, management of COVID-19 in health care settings, reduction in community
transmission, reporting, contact tracing and other public health measures. Our notion of contact
rates combines both rate of interaction and probability of infection during interaction; thus,
increased rates of interaction during reopening may, to a certain degree, be possible without
increased transmission if key public health measures (e.g., hand hygiene, physical distancing)
are strictly adhered to. Our model also assumes a simple population structure—data for more
complex populations being largely lacking. In addition, the numbers of reported cases per
prevalent case will change as testing is widened, and this is not modelled in our forecasts.
Amidst differing epidemics and control measures, each jurisdiction has a leeway—the room

between the current state and the threshold—and this is comparable from place to place. The
leeway, together with model fits that are informed by data and which describe the uncertainty
in how much leeway there is, can provide a quantitative basis for decisions about reopening.
We are at a unique time in this pandemic, with a so-called “first wave” receding not due to immunity, but due to widespread behavioural change. Given that reopening will occur, this leaves
populations vulnerable to resurgence of cases, driven both by local transmission and sparked
by introductions. Our results indicate that jurisdictions should proceed with great caution, particularly where there is a substantial probability that they are near the threshold already; rapid
monitoring should seek signs of increased community transmission and clustered outbreaks as
early as possible. To mitigate risks associated with imported cases and reopening borders, it is
important to account for the risk of growth in the general population together with the likelihood that imported cases will arrive in high-risk settings. We recommend that policy-makers
carefully consider (i) whether imported cases and seeded outbreaks are likely to be identified
and managed to the same degree as those in the local population; (ii) whether travellers will engage in high-risk or high-contact activities, especially within marginalized populations; and (iii)
whether local trace and test strategies have the capacity to manage imported cases and nascent
outbreaks.

We extend the SARS-CoV-2 susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model developed
in Ref. [19]. The model allows for self-isolation and quarantine through a quarantine compartment and a reduced duration of infection (compared to the clinical course of disease). We model
a fixed portion of the population that is able to participate in physical distancing; each of the
SEIR compartments has an analogous compartment in the distancing group (Fig. 4). We extend
our model [19] here by estimating additional parameters in a Bayesian context including the
timing of the physical distancing ramp, the scale of the initial cases, and multiple contact rates
through time for those practicing distancing.
The model describes the time dynamics of susceptible (S), exposed (E1 ) exposed and infectious (E2 ), symptomatic and infectious (I), quarantined (Q) and recovered or deceased (R)
individuals (see Fig. 4). It assumes that recovered individuals are immune to the virus. The
model has analogous states for individuals practicing physical distancing, given by Sd , E1d ,
E2d , Id , Qd , and Rd . Physical distancing is implemented by reducing the contact rate, thereby
lowering the spread of the virus. The model is fitted separately for each jurisdiction.

Figure 4: Schematic of the epidemiological model. Compartments: susceptible to the virus
(S); exposed (E1 ); exposed, pre-symptomatic, and infectious (E2 ); symptomatic and infectious
(I); quarantined (Q); and recovered or deceased (R). Recovered individuals are assumed to be
immune. The model includes analogous variables for individuals practicing physical distancing:
Sd , E1d , E2d , Id , Qd , and Rd . Solid arrows represent flow of individuals between compartments
at rates indicated by the mathematical terms. Dashed lines show which compartments contribute
to new infections. An individual in some compartment X can begin distancing and move to the
corresponding compartment Xd at rate ud . The reverse transition occurs at rate ur . The model
quickly settles on a fraction e = ud /(ud + ur ) participating in distancing, and dynamics depend
on this fraction, rather than on the rates ud and ur . Duplicated from Ref. [19] for clarity.

The force of infection for this population is a fraction f of that of the non-distancing population Eq. (1). In addition, note that the factor f appears twice in the force of infection. This is
due to the fact that physical distancing helps in reducing the rate that “distancers” move about
and contact others, and the rate at which they are contacted by anyone (distancing or otherwise)
who is experiencing population contact. This factor changes with time to model the introduction

where t1 and t2 are the start and end times of the initial implementation of physical distancing
measures such that f declines from 1 to f1 during this period, and f2 is the value of f after May

estimated (see below).
Our overall approach is to estimate f1 and f2 using Bayesian inference. We also estimate
the fraction of the population e = ur /(ud + ur ) engaged in NPI or distancing, the times t1
and t2 , the and starting introduction size (prevalence at the model starting time). We use data
from reported cases, despite the issues inherent in this [18], and compensate for variable testing
through time where possible (see below) and for the delay between symptom onset and case
reporting.

We let Cr denote the number of recorded cases on day r. The number of people who become
symptomatic on a given day n is the number moving from the exposed
pre-symptomatic (E2
Rn
and E2d ) to the symptomatic (I and Id ) compartments, namely n−1 k2 [E2 (τ ) + E2d (τ )] dτ.
The expected number of reported cases on day r is a weighted sum of those who become
symptomatic in previous days, where the weights are determined by the the delay between
symptom onset and reporting [19]:

where ψr represents the sampling fraction on day r and we use a Weibull distribution with shape
kMLE and scale λMLE for w(·). If ψr = 1, then all estimated infectious people are tested and
then become reported cases; ψr < 1 represents a reduction in expected cases on day r due to not
everyone being tested. See Ref. [19] for further details on fitting w(·) from data. We used kMLE
and λMLE as estimated for British Columbia in Ref. [19] for the other regions (due to a lack of
the necessary data), except for New Zealand for which A. Lustig and M. Plank (pers. comm.)
fitted non-public data using our code [20].

Data processing and regional fitting
We obtained reported case data from publicly available sources (Table S1). We used baseline
values of constant testing (0.2) where we were not aware of testing data indicating widened testing eligibility or steep increases in testing volume. Where these were indicated we increased the
sample fraction accordingly (see Table S2). A number of jurisdictions also required additional
data processing and/or modification to obtain regional fits:
• Several jurisdictions showed a strong weekly pattern in case reporting. In these cases
(Belgium, Germany, Japan, Washington), we implemented a 3-day running average.
• Quebec public health officials announced that a computer error resulted in 1,317 missing
positive COVID-19 cases between April 2nd–30th. As a result, we removed these 1,317
cases from the day they were eventually reported, and redistributed them evenly across
days April 2nd–30th
• April 1st was an outlier in the number of observed cases in Ontario, seeing more than
double the number of cases than other days during that week. To account for this, we
redistributed the difference in the number of cases between April 1st and April 2nd evenly
across the 5 days prior to April 1st.
• In the UK, April 11th was an outlier in the daily number of observed cases with almost
double any other day during the pandemic so far. We redistributed the difference in the
number of cases between April 10th and April 11th evenly across the 5 days prior to
April 11th. The UK also made a large increase in the daily number of completed tests
from April 30th onward, in line with the introduction of a government target of 100,000
tests per day by the end of April. We account for this in the model by increasing the
assumed sampling fraction from 0.2 to 0.3 for April 30th onward.

Table S2: Regional modelling initialization, data properties, and priors. Population numbers were obtained from local government websites. We set sampling fractions to 0.2 in most cases except for in British Columbia (BC) where the sampling
fractions represent means from a fitted model that also accounts for daily hospitalizations with an assumed hospitalization
fraction of 0.08 (changes on March 14, April 11, and April 21 due to known policy changes); New Zealand (NZ) where
we assumed a higher sampling fraction; and the United Kingdom (UK) where there was a large increase in the daily number of completed tests from April 30 onward. The assumed sampling fraction should only affect modelled prevalence until
substantial immunity is built up. See Fig. 2 for jurisdiction abbreviations.

• For British Columbia, we defined two change-points for the fraction of cases sampled.
From March 1st–14th the sampling fraction was set to 0.14, from March 14th to April 21st
it was set to 0.21 and from April 21st onward it was set to 0.37. These were obtained from
a separate model fit that included daily hospitalizations and an assumed hospitalization
fraction of 0.08.
• For New Zealand, we used a fixed sampling fraction of 0.4 under the assumption of a
higher level of case detection. We also removed all cases arising from international travel.

Mobility data
We informed the priors for the start and end dates for physical distancing measures using Google
mobility data [22] (Fig. S1). For each region, we use the daily average of the available public
transportation data. We then fit a piecewise linear regression with two breakpoints to the data
from each location using the R package ‘segmented’ [23]. We use the two fitted breakpoints
(rounded to the nearest day) as prior means on the start and end dates t1 and t2 for each jurisdiction (Table S2). Two exceptions to this were New Zealand and Sweden. In New Zealand,
mobility data suggested start and end dates of March 18th and March 30th, but an end date of
March 26th was found to provide an improved fit. Similarly, in Sweden March 9th to March
20th were suggested by mobility data but this resulted in poor fit. Instead, we used March 6th
to March 27th.

Bayesian estimation
44

The joint posterior distribution given the case counts {Cr } is
Pr (R0b , f1 , f2 , t1 , t2 , I0 , e, φ|Cr ) ∝
Pr (Cr |R0b , f1 , f2 , t1 , t2 , I0 , e) ×
Pr(R0b ) Pr(f1 ) Pr(f2 ) Pr(t1 ) Pr(t2 ) Pr(I0 ) Pr(e) Pr(φ),

where R0b , f1 , f2 , t1 , t2 , I0 , e, and φ are estimated parameters. We use a negative binomial likelihood for the observation component parameterized such that the variance scales quadratically
with the mean [24]. We describe the parameters here for clarity: R0b represents the basic reproductive number (without distancing but with quarantine), f1 and f2 represent the force of
infection for the post-measures and recent periods, I0 represents the incidence at 30 days before the first day of data, e represents the fraction distancing, and t1 and t2 represent the dates
that physical distancing starts and finishes ramping in, φ represents the (inverse) dispersion
parameter.
We fit our models with Stan 2.19.3 [25,26] and R 3.6.2 [27] using our R package ‘covidseir’
[21]. We sampled from 4 chains with 400 iterations per chain and discarded the first half of
each chain as warm-up. We initialized the chains at random values drawn from the priors. We

assessed chain convergence with trace plots and via R̂ < 1.05 (the potential scale reduction
factor) and ESS > 200 (the effective sample size) [26].
Some parameter values (Table S3) and prior distributions (Table S4) are the same for all
jurisdictions, whereas some differ between jurisdictions (Table S2). The rate of people moving
to physical distancing, ud , is calculated from the estimates of e = ur /(ud + ur ), because e is
estimated and ur is fixed. We used informative prior distributions on estimated parameters as
follows (Table S4). The prior on R0b encompasses values commonly published in the literature
for SARS-CoV-2 [35, 36]. The prior for f1 and f2 results in a mean of 0.4 and a standard
deviation of 0.2 to represent a moderately strong reduction in contact fraction while still being
broad enough to encompass a wide range of values. We use lognormal priors for t1 and t2 ,
with the means based on the piecewise regression analyses of the Google mobility data, and
standard deviations of 0.1, except for New Zealand and Sweden for which less tight priors
(standard deviation of 0.2) are needed. The prior on φ constrains the model to avoid substantial
prior mass on a large amount of over-dispersion (small values of φ). The initial conditions of the
state variables are defined consistently across jurisdictions, but depend on the each jurisdiction’s
population size N and estimated values of e and I0 (Table S5). For most jurisdictions, the prior
on I0 was set such that I0 has mean 1, representing a prior belief that the initial time point was

set to a time without substantial numbers of cases in that location. New Zealand, where the
total number of cases has been very small, required a smaller mean to obtain a satisfactory fit
(0.01). For British Columbia we instead set the mean for the I0 prior to 8, as in [19], and for
Germany and Japan (both having a more substantial number of cases prior to the initial time
point) we used a mean equal to the reported number of observed cases 30 days before the initial
time point: 5 and 14, respectively. These are summarized in Table S2.
To calculate the posterior distribution of the ratio between the contact rate and the threshold
(i.e., Fig. 1A), we apply the projection and regression approach described in Ref. [19]. We
use a projection period of 25 days and evaluate f values ranging from 0.3 to 0.8. We then
determine the threshold value and compare it to the estimated f1 or f2 for every posterior sample
independently.
