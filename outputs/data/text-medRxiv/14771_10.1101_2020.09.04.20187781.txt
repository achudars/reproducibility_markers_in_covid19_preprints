Research in context
Evidence before this study
Published trials and observational studies to date have shown no evidence of benefit of
hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for hospitalised patients who already have COVID-19. A
separate question remains: whether routine ongoing use of hydroxychloroquine in people without
COVID-19 protects against new infections or severe outcomes. We searched MEDLINE/PubMed for
pharmacoepidemiological studies evaluating hydroxychloroquine for prevention of severe COVID-19
outcomes. The keywords “hydroxychloroquine AND (COVID OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2)
AND (prophyl* OR prevent*) AND (rate OR hazard OR odds OR risk)” were used and results were
filtered to articles from the last year with abstracts available. 109 papers were identified for
screening; none investigated pre-exposure prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine for prevention of
severe COVID-19 outcomes. Clinical trials of prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine are ongoing;
however, the largest trial does not expect to meet recruitment targets due to “…unjustified
extrapolation and exaggerated safety concerns together with intense politicisation and negative
publicity.” In the absence of reported clinical trials, evidence can be generated from real-world data
to support the need for randomised clinical trials.

Added value of this study
In this cohort study representing 40% of the population of England, we investigated whether routine
use of hydroxychloroquine prior to the COVID-19 outbreak prevented COVID-19 mortality. Using
robust pharmacoepidemiological methods, we found no evidence to support a substantial benefit of
hydroxychloroquine in preventing COVID-19 mortality. At the same time, we have shown no
significant harm, and this generates the equipoise to justify continuing randomised trials. We have
demonstrated in this study that it is feasible to address specific hypotheses about medicines in a
rapid and transparent manner to inform interim clinical decision making and support the need for
large-scale, randomised trial data.

Implications of all the available evidence
This is the first study to investigate the ongoing routine use of hydroxychloroquine and risk of
COVID-19 mortality in a general population. While we found no evidence of any protective benefit,
due to the observational nature of the study, residual confounding remains a possibility. Completion
of trials for prevention of severe outcomes is warranted, but prior to the completion of these, we
found no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine for prevention of COVID-19 mortality.

Abstract
Background. Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, but early clinical studies found no benefit treating patients with
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We set out to evaluate the effectiveness of
hydroxychloroquine for prevention, as opposed to treatment, of COVID-19 mortality.

Methods. We pre-specified and conducted an observational, population-based cohort study using
national primary care data and linked death registrations in the OpenSAFELY platform, representing
40% of the general population in England. We used Cox regression to estimate the association
between ongoing routine hydroxychloroquine use prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in England and
risk of COVID-19 mortality among people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE). Model adjustment was informed by a directed acyclic graph.
Results. Of 194,637 patients with RA or SLE, 30,569 (15.7%) received ≥2 prescriptions of
hydroxychloroquine in the six months prior to 1 March 2020. Between 1 March 2020 and 13 July
2020, there were 547 COVID-19 deaths, 70 among hydroxychloroquine users. Estimated
standardised cumulative COVID-19 mortality was 0.23% (95% CI 0.18-0.29) among users and
0.22% (95% CI 0.20-0.25) among non-users; an absolute difference of 0.008% (95% CI -0.0510.066). After accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, use of other immunuosuppressives, and geographic
region, no association with COVID-19 mortality was observed (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80-1.33). We
found no evidence of interactions with age or other immunosuppressives. Quantitative bias analyses
indicated observed associations were robust to missing information regarding additional biologic
treatments for rheumatological disease. We observed similar associations with the negative control
outcome of non-COVID-19 mortality.

Conclusion. We found no evidence of a difference in COVID-19 mortality among patients who
received hydroxychloroquine for treatment of rheumatological disease prior to the COVID-19
outbreak in England.

Background
Hydroxychloroquine, a commonly used conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug
(sDMARD), is indicated for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE).1 Early in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, it
was suggested that hydroxychloroquine may benefit the treatment and prevention of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19).2–4 Hydroxychloroquine has since been investigated in numerous clinical
trials5–9 and observational cohorts10–12 with no evidence of therapeutic efficacy in treatment of
hospitalised patients with symptomatic COVID-19.

Evaluations of the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for prevention, as opposed to treatment, of
SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe COVID-19 outcomes are limited.13 One randomised, controlled trial
examining hydroxychloroquine as post-exposure prophylaxis did not demonstrate significant benefit
in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, though uncertainty in results could not exclude possible
benefit.14 Other trials for the prevention of COVID-19 outcomes are ongoing.5 In this large
population-based cohort study, we examined whether ongoing routine hydroxychloroquine use prior
to the outbreak in England was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 mortality.

Methods
Study design and population
We conducted an observational cohort study using electronic health record (EHR) data from primary
care practices using The Phoenix Partnership (TPP) software linked to Office for National Statistics
(ONS) death registrations through OpenSAFELY. This is a data analytics platform developed during
the COVID-19 pandemic to allow near real-time analysis of pseudonymised primary care patient
records at scale, covering approximately 40% of the population in England, operating within the
EHR vendor’s highly secure data centre.15,16 Pseudonymised structured data include demographics,
medications prescribed from primary care, diagnoses, and laboratory measures. Details on
Information Governance of the OpenSAFELY platform can be found in the Supplementary
Appendix.
We included all adults aged ≥18 years registered with a general practice for ≥1 year on 1 March
2020 (index date) with information on age, sex, and deprivation. Within this source population, we
identified people who were diagnosed with RA or SLE ≥6 months prior to the index date and
therefore had indication for hydroxychloroquine use prior to the outbreak in England.17 We studied
people with these conditions to minimise the potential for confounding by indication when estimating
the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine use rather than investigate how to prevent severe COVID19 in this population.

Exposure, outcome and follow-up
The exposure of interest was regular use of hydroxychloroquine (≥2 prescriptions in the 6 months
prior to index, “users”) compared to no regular use of hydroxychloroquine (“non-users”). The primary
outcome was COVID-19 mortality, defined by the presence of ICD-10 codes U07.1 (“COVID-19,
virus identified”) or U07.2 (“COVID-19, virus not identified”) on the death certificate.18 We followed
people from index date until earliest of: date of death, or seven days prior to last date of availability
of ONS mortality data to account for reporting lag. People not exposed to hydroxychloroquine before
index date were censored if prescribed it during follow-up. Study design is depicted in eFigure 1 in
Supplementary Appendix.

Covariates
Potential determinants of regular hydroxychloroquine use and COVID-19 mortality were identified by
reviewing existing literature and through discussions with clinicians. As this was a study of prevalent
hydroxychloroquine users, we included determinants that may have influenced the initial choice of
treatment and whether people remained on treatment. The full list of pre-specified variables
included age, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation quintile, other immunosuppressives (other
sDMARDs, oral corticosteroids), smoking status, prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), body mass index, hypertension, diabetes severity as measured by diagnostic codes and
glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), heart disease, liver disease, respiratory disease excluding asthma,
kidney disease as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), stroke, dementia,
cancer, and influenza vaccination in 2019/20 season. Our methodology for creating codelists has
been previously described.15 We developed a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to identify the minimal
set of covariates to adjust for the hypothesised confounding structure, which included age, sex,
ethnicity, geographic region, and other immunosuppressives (see eFigure 2 in Supplementary
Appendix).

Statistical methods
Patient characteristics were summarised using descriptive statistics, stratified by exposure status.
We used Cox regression models with days since the index date as the timescale to estimate hazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between regular
hydroxychloroquine use and COVID-19 mortality. The competing risk of death from causes other
than COVID-19 was accounted for by censoring non COVID-19 deaths; our analysis therefore
estimated cause-specific hazards.19 We sequentially adjusted for sex and age using restricted cubic
splines; for the minimal adjustment set informed by the DAG; and finally extended for all extracted
covariates listed above. Models were stratified by an indicator variable denoting patient population
(i.e., RA or SLE) and geographic region. Multiple imputation (10 imputations) was used to account

for missing ethnicity for 23% of the sample, with the imputation model including all extracted
covariates and an indicator for the outcome. Those with missing body mass index were assumed to
be non-obese, and those with missing smoking data were assumed to be never-smokers; we did not
use multiple imputation for these variables as they are expected to be missing not at random in UK
primary care.20 Proportional hazards were checked by examining the Schoenfeld residuals over
time.

We generated cumulative mortality curves standardised to adjust for different covariate distributions
in the exposed group. First, a flexible parametric Royston-Parmar model with the same covariates
as the DAG-Informed Cox model was fitted, with the baseline hazard modelled using a three
degrees-of-freedom spline. The survival function was predicted from this model for every individual
with regular hydroxychloroquine use and averaged to produce the curve for the exposed group. To
produce the standardised comparison curve, the survival functions were predicted and averaged
again for the same individuals, but with exposure set to zero. Patient population was included in the
flexible parametric model as a binary indicator variable since the model could not converge with
both patient population and geographic region as stratification variables. Comparisons between Cox
and Royston-Parmar models can be found in the Supplementary Appendix.

We evaluated pre-specified interactions to determine whether the association between regular
hydroxychloroquine use and COVID-19 mortality varied by age, exposure to other sDMARDs, oral
corticosteroids, and NSAIDs. Two-sided p-values were calculated from Wald tests on interaction
terms.

Sensitivity analyses
We adjusted for ethnicity in a model excluding people with missing ethnicity and compared results
with those from multiple imputation. In primary analyses, <2% of the comparison group had one
prescription of hydroxychloroquine in the six-month exposure window. We re-defined exposure as

≥1 prescription in the three months prior to the index date. We compared results from primary
models stratified for patient population (RA or SLE) to a model that included patient population as a
binary indicator variable as well as modelling each population separately.

We calculated bias-adjusted hazard ratios to evaluate how adjustment for biologic DMARDs
(bDMARDs), including targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs), which were not available for this
analysis, may have produced different results under differing assumptions of prevalence and effect
on COVID-19 mortality.21 Prevalence of bDMARDs in each exposure group was estimated from preexisting literature (18% among users and 21% among non-users);22,23 however, we also examined

more extreme values of prevalence (see Supplementary Appendix). We assumed a range of
potential associations between bDMARDs and COVID-19 mortality from 0.8 to 1.2.

We conducted analyses using non COVID-19 mortality as a negative control outcome, censoring at
COVID-19 death. We hypothesized that If associations observed in primary analyses were due to
confounding by indication, we would observe a similar association with non COVID-19 mortality.

Of these, 30,569 (15.7%) demonstrated regular use of hydroxychloroquine in the six months prior to
index date. Hydroxychloroquine users were younger (median: 63 years for users, 66 years for nonusers) and more likely to be female (76% women for users; 70% for non-users); other demographic
characteristics between exposure groups were broadly similar (Table 1). Hydroxychloroquine users
were more likely to be on other sDMARDs (52% vs 34%), oral corticosteroids (23% vs 16%), and
NSAIDs (22% vs 16%). Distributions of characteristics in RA and SLE populations are shown in

Between 1 March 2020 and 13 July 2020, there were 547 COVID-19 deaths among people with RA
or SLE, 70 of which were among regular users of hydroxychloroquine. Estimated standardised

and non-users, respectively, at the end of follow-up (Figure 2). The absolute cumulative risk
difference was 0.008% (95% CI -0.051, 0.066). In unadjusted analyses, regular users of
hydroxychloroquine had a decreased risk of COVID-19 mortality (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.60-1.00,
Figure 3). After adjusting for age and sex, there was no longer any evidence of association (HR
1.08, 95% CI 0.84-1.40). Additionally adjusting for variables identified in the DAG (HR 1.03, 95% CII
0.80-1.33) or extending to all covariates (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80-1.33) did not alter conclusions.
There was no evidence of interaction by age, exposure to other sDMARDs, oral corticosteroids, or
NSAIDs (eTable 3).

Sensitivity analyses
Results from all sensitivity analyses provided similar findings to primary analyses (eTable 4). In
quantitative bias analyses, values of the bias-adjusted association ranged from HR 0.97 (95% CI
0.75-1.26) to HR 1.09 (95% CI 0.84-1.40) (eTable 5). Hydroxychloroquine use was not associated
with the negative control outcome of non COVID-19 mortality after adjustment for age and sex (HR
1.00, 95% CI 0.87-1.15, Figure 3).

Discussion
Key findings
In this national, population-based study of hydroxychloroquine users, we found no evidence that
hydroxychloroquine was associated with either a beneficial or harmful impact on COVID-19
mortality. The confidence intervals around the relative risk suggest that we could exclude substantial
benefit, though a modest benefit or harm on a relative scale could not be ruled out. However, even if
hydroxychloroquine provided a benefit, our results demonstrate a maximum absolute risk reduction
of 0.05% in the context of an absolute risk of 0.22% of COVID-19 mortality among non-users. Taken
together, our findings do not provide any strong support for a protective effect from ongoing routine
hydroxychloroquine use as has been previously hypothesised. Our estimates were robust to
multiple sensitivity analyses. We have demonstrated in this study that it is feasible to address
specific hypotheses about medicines in a transparent manner in response to speculation, using
OpenSAFELY, and to inform regulatory bodies decision making in the absence of high quality,
randomised trial data. However, due to the observational nature of the study, a degree of
uncertainty persists that can only be addressed through large-scale randomised trials.

Comparison with other evidence
A randomised trial examining hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis did not
demonstrate a significant benefit in preventing infection, although the findings were compatible with
an absolute risk reduction as much as 7% in the context of an absolute risk of about 14% in the
placebo arm.14 As we await the reporting of ongoing clinical trials of prophylactic use of
hydroxychloroquine, related evidence of drug effectiveness among existing users can be generated
from observational data. Previous investigations of hydroxychloroquine using observational data24
had limitations in their design and analysis,25 including relatively small sample sizes and focusing
only on hospitalised patients, which may produce spurious associations.26
Numerous randomised trials5–9 have failed to find any clinical benefit of hydroxychloroquine for
treatment of COVID-19. Studies to date have also not demonstrated substantial harm, though the
RECOVERY trial have shown some evidence of harm looking at death and ventilation as a
composite outcome.27 While hydroxychloroquine has been approved for use in treatment of RA and
SLE for many years, recent evidence has suggested potential short-term harms (when coprescribed with azithromycin).28 While we were underpowered to investigate co-medication with
azithromycin, results of our study showed no evidence of an association with mortality from COVID19 or other causes. This suggests justification to continue trials of hydroxychloroquine for prevention
of COVID-19 to confirm our findings from observational data.

Strengths and limitations
The greatest strengths of this study were the statistical power and the detailed longitudinal, routinely
collected data to ascertain routine hydroxychloroquine use prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 in
England. We were able to focus analyses on patients with indications for the use of
hydroxychloroquine, a key component to mitigate confounding by indication in
pharmacoepidemiological research of real-world data. Prior to starting analysis, we developed a
DAG to identify a minimal set of covariates to adjust for the hypothesised confounding structure. We
also fitted models adjusting for additional characteristics suggested as potentially important in
consultation with clinicians. We performed informative sensitivity analyses including quantitative
bias analyses to test key assumptions about missing data on bDMARD treatments. Lastly, the
optimal timing29 and dose30 of hydroxychloroquine for therapeutic and prophylactic use for COVID19 has been debated. Our population included regular users of hydroxychloroquine, in doses
routinely used in clinical practice, with clarity that hydroxychloroquine administration occurred before
exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we pre-specified our study protocol and have shared all
analytical code.

We also recognise possible limitations. One is the risk of residual confounding by use of
medications not prescribed in general practice, namely bDMARDs. While the majority of
prescriptions in England are supplied by general practitioners in primary care, some medicines,
including biologics, may be supplied by hospitals for various reasons including cost. We have
advocated for these data to be more widely shared but, at present, they are not available.31,32
Although recent nationwide information on the prevalence of concomitant use of bDMARDs and
hydroxychloroquine were unavailable, we demonstrated that our results were robust to a wide range
of plausible assumptions about the use of these drugs and their potential relationship with COVID19 mortality in quantitative bias analysis. A further potential source of confounding is severity of
rheumatological disease, which is not captured in primary care records. However, the addition of a
number of chronic comorbidities and proxies for health status in extended adjustment did not alter
our findings. Another important consideration is the potential for exposure misclassification, whereby
people prescribed hydroxychloroquine were not taking it as directed. In some reportedly rare cases
in March, local shortages of hydroxychloroquine may have occurred due to inappropriate
stockpiling; however, the United Kingdom has not suffered major shortages during the COVID-19
outbreak.33 An additional limitation in primary care prescribing data is drug exposure
misclassification, whereby people may not adhere to medications as directed. Finally, COVID-19
mortality as an outcome reflects the risk of exposure to and acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well
as the risk of developing severe disease and subsequent death. We were not able to explore the
risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the current study due to the lack of complete or representative
testing data. However, if hydroxychloroquine had a strong protective effect on the risk of SARSCoV-2 infection, we would have expected to see this reflected in lower risk of COVID-19 mortality.

Summary
We carried out a large study of patients who were prescribed hydroxychloroquine for its licensed
purpose and followed them up to look for clear signals of benefit in mortality from COVID-19 and
other causes. We found no evidence of benefit after adjusting for important differences in those who
had received hydroxychloroquine. Completion of randomised trials for prevention of severe
outcomes is warranted to confirm these observational findings. The use of hydroxychloroquine for
prevention of COVID-19 mortality outside trial settings is currently not justified.
