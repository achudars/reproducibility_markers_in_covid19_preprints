Abstract

24

Introduction: COVID-19 affected worldwide, causing to date, around 500,000 deaths. In

25

Mexico, by April 29, the general case fatality was 6.52%, with 11.1% confirmed case

26

mortality and hospital recovery rate around 72%. Once hospitalized, the odds for

27

recovery and hospital death rates depend mainly on the patients' comorbidities and age.

28

In Mexico, triage guidelines use algorithms and risk estimation tools for severity

29

assessment and decision-making. The study's objective is to analyze the underlying

30

conditions of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Mexico concerning four severity

31

outcomes.

32

Materials and Methods: Retrospective cohort based on registries of all laboratory-

33

confirmed patients with the COVID-19 infection that required hospitalization in

34

Mexico. Independent variables were comorbidities and clinical manifestations.

35

Dependent variables were four possible severity outcomes: (a) pneumonia, (b)

36

mechanical ventilation (c) intensive care unit, and (d) death; all of them were coded as

37

binary

38

Results: We included 69,334 hospitalizations of laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized

39

patients to June 30, 2020. Patients were 55.29 years, and 62.61% were male. Hospital

40

mortality among patients aged<15 was 9.11%, 51.99% of those aged >65 died. Male

41

gender and increasing age predicted every severity outcome. Diabetes and hypertension

42

predicted every severity outcome significantly. Obesity did not predict mortality, but

43

CKD, respiratory diseases, cardiopathies were significant predictors.

44

Conclusion: Obesity increased the risk for pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, and

45

intensive care admittance, but it was not a predictor of in-hospital death. Patients with

46

respiratory diseases were less prone to develop pneumonia, to receive mechanical

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 is in the family of viruses called coronavirus, characterized for

55

causing mild symptoms like the common cold to severe respiratory syndrome (SR) to

56

susceptible humans [1]. As the cause of an emerging highly transmissible agent,

57

COVID-19 was identified as the cause of severe, fatal respiratory disease in Wuhan

58

China by the end of 2019 [2]. By February 28, imported cases were confirmed in

59

Mexico [3].

60

COVID-19 has to date, affected worldwide population involving approximately

61

216 countries, with 11 million confirmed cases and around 500,000 deaths [4]. In

62

Mexico, by April 29, 245,000 confirmed cases, and 29,843 deaths had been reported;

63

based on these data, the national incidence rate was 13.89 / 100,000 inhabitants. General

64

case fatality is 6.52%, and 11.1 % confirmed case mortality and hospital recovery rate

65

around 72%. [3]. Once hospitalized, the odds for recovery and, therefore, the hospital

66

death rates depend mainly on the patients' underlying health conditions and the clinical-

67

pathological manifestations that they may develop.

68

According to epidemiologic data, men are more prone to develop severe cases

69

than women are; smoking abuse may relate to adverse outcomes among COVID-19

70

hospitalized patients [5, 6]. Furthermore, comorbidities have been associated with a

71

higher mortality rate, including hypertension, respiratory diseases, cardiac pathologies,

72

diabetes, and CPK [7-9]. Additionally, smoking habits may relate to adverse outcomes

73

among COVID-19 hospitalized patients due to an overexpression of angiotensin

74

converter enzyme [10]. The mechanical impairment of respiration in COVID-19

75

patients is due to a nervous alteration associated with damage to the solitary and

76

ambiguous tract nuclei. They are responsible for the innervation of the muscles, glands,

77

and blood vessels, causing death due to dysfunction of the cardiorespiratory system [11,

4

78

12]. Another cause of mechanical alteration is related to acute respiratory distress

79

syndrome, caused by excessive recruitment of immune cells, producing an increase in

80

pro-inflammatory factors, ending in dysfunction of the pulmonary circulation, and

81

increased cardiac output [13]. Therefore, immune impairment and uncontrolled diabetes

82

may inhibit the proliferation of lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils,

83

favoring viral replication, and translating in morbidity that is more significant and

84

mortality proneness [14]. Additionally, patients with long term uncontrolled diabetes

85

may also sum an unknown kidney function impairment.

86

Obesity is a chronic disease resulting from the storage of energy as fat cells

87

causing hypertrophy and hyperplasia with an increase in adipose tissue and free fatty

88

acids resulting in endocrine and mechanical alteration. The latter is a factor causing

89

dyspnea due to decreased lung volume and ventilator capacity associated with the

90

increased abdominal pressure in the diaphragm [15]. High blood pressure (HBP) and

91

insulin resistance or diabetes often accompanies obesity; therefore, obesity and its

92

associated chronic conditions have more than one pathophysiological pathway of

93

enabling severe manifestations in COVID-19 patients.

94

Even when asthma has not been identified as a strong risk factor for acquiring

95

coronavirus disease, asthma patients, mainly those poorly controlled, could be at the highest risk

96

of developing severe COVID-19 due to yet unknown immune networks that involve

97

inflammatory cytokines [16]. Acute exacerbations of asthma require early recognition and

98

intervention before a severe and life-threatening course of the condition [17]. Therefore, in the

99

presence of COVID-19, people with asthma may require in-hospital assistance to the possible

100

development of severe outcomes in the acute asthma exacerbations [18]. On the other hand,

101

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) may involve a combination of small airway

102

disease and parenchymal destruction [19]. Therefore, acute exacerbations of COPD may as well

103

derive to respiratory failure that may require treatment with mechanic ventilation in patients in

104

the intensive care unit (ICU) [20]. The triage strategy for COVID-19 involves and defines the

105

allocation of in-hospital services, intensive therapy management, and even mechanical

106

ventilation with respirators. The triage and risk assessment tools have incorporated

107

questionnaires that estimate the complication's risks, age, gender, gestational status, lifestyle,

108

and chronic comorbidities. Those include obesity, diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney

109

disease (CKD), cardiopathies, immune impairment, COPD, and asthma. Even when such

110

indicators of complications are based on existing worldwide early evidence, assessing them is

111

vital in clinical practice when deliberating to which patient should need the resource based on

112

the odds of complications or even death.

113

In Mexico, the health system delivered self-applied risk assessment estimation tools and

114

comprehensive triage guides with clinical practice algorithms. Both kinds of instruments are

115

based on age and comorbidities, which are grouped by the affected system or organ (such as

116

COPD and asthma, grouped as respiratory diseases). That practice may or may not be of

117

independent prognostic importance for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 severe cases [21].

118

Therefore, analyzing the severity of the events that occurred in hospitalized patients with severe

119

COVID-19 can help to identify the characteristics and comorbidities that represent increased

120

odds for a poor outcome. The objective of the study is to analyze the underlying conditions of

121

patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Mexico concerning four severity outcomes (a)

122

pneumonia, (b) mechanical ventilation (c) intensive care therapy, and (d) death.

124

Materials and methods

125

This study is a retrospective cohort based on the epidemiologic case of all

126

laboratory-confirmed patients with the COVID-19 infection that required hospitalization

127

and complemented with the medical records of in-hospital assistance until discharge. In

128

Mexico during the contingency, public hospitals in all 32 states were reconverted to

129

receive and provide attention to COVID-19 patients specifically, and all hospitalizations

136

A standardized epidemiological case study form for each patient, including

137

comorbid conditions, is generated, including clinical manifestations for triage. The in-

138

hospital clinical course section is added if patients are hospitalized. Once updated,

139

verified, and ratified, case studies are uploaded to the website of the department of

140

health information as open access data sets. For the present study, we used the

141

anonymized, open-access datasets. Data sets were coded, transformed into dependent

142

and independent variables.

143

Independent variables were grouped as sociodemographic, comorbidities, and

144

clinical. The dependent variables represented four possible severity outcomes that

145

occurred during hospitalization including (a) pneumonia, (b) mechanical ventilation (c)

146

intensive care unit, and (d) death; all of them were coded as binary. The frequencies,

147

means, and percentages are presented and compared between groups for severity

148

outcome distribution. The hospitalization rates are presented by 100,000 inhabitants,

149

and for each severity outcome, percentages were calculated, while interstate variability

150

was also assessed for each variable.

151

Severity outcomes were analyzed in separate binary logistic regression models

152

adjusted by age and gender. For statistical significance, a p-value <0.05 was considered

153

significant, while odds ratios were compared to 1.00 as a reference value, where

154

significant values <1.00 were indicators as protective and >1.00 as of increased risk;

Results
To July 30, 2020, 69,334 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2

160

infection were hospitalized in Mexican reconverted hospitals; male patients represented

161

62.61%, and the mean age was 55.29 years. Adjusted for age groups, Pediatric patients

162

(age <15) represented 0.11% (N=804) and older adults (age >65) 27% (N=18,780) of

163

hospitalized patients; median hospital stay was of five days. One-fourth of

164

hospitalizations related to patients with obesity (23.56%), more than half of the patients

165

had at least one previously diagnosed comorbidity. Diabetes was present among 30% of

166

all hospitalized patients, hypertension was the most common comorbidity in 34% cases,

167

cardiovascular diseases were present in 0.42%, CPK 0.5%, immune impairment 0.25%,

168

and respiratory diseases 0.56%. Additionally, 0.82% were active smokers, and 1.7%

169

(N=442) of hospitalized women were pregnant.

170

Around two thirds of patients developed pneumonia 66.5% (N=46,107); 9.6%

171

(6,706) received mechanic ventilation; 8.56% (5,937) were located at the ICU and

172

35.72% (N=24,770) died. Regarding the interstate variability, the median rate of

173

hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants was 39.7 (Range = 16.4-137.6); the median of

174

pneumonia percentage among hospitalized patients was 63.6 (Range=42.1-79.6), the

175

median of mechanical ventilation percentage was 8.8 (Range=3.3-14.9), the interstate

176

median percentage for intensive care was 9.3 (Range=2.1-28.5), and the median

177

percentage of in-hospital deaths was 33.5 (Range=18.6-47.7). (See supplemental

178

material for maps describing severity outcome distribution in Mexican states).

§ Presence of any of the following comorbidities: diabetes, respiratory diseases, hypertension, cardiovascular disease,
and CKD.
¶ Presence of asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
** Diagnostic presence of any cardiovascular disease not including hypertension.

When comparing the proportional distribution of comorbidities among patients

196

with or without severity outcomes (Table 2), it is noted that among patients who

197

developed pneumonia, the percentage of active smokers, obesity prevalence, diabetes,

198

hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases were higher than among those who did not

199

develop pneumonia. Proportionally, among patients who needed mechanical ventilation

200

during their hospitalization, pregnancy was less frequent, while obesity, diabetes,

201

hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases were more frequent.

In the group of patients who received treatment at the intensive care unit, the

prevalence of smoking, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, CPK, and immune impairment

211

prevalence of all other comorbidities, including CPK and respiratory diseases (COPD

212

and Asthma) were significantly higher.
After analyzing the association between the comorbidities and the odds for

213
214

severity outcome occurrence (Table 3), it was found that the male gender and increasing

215

age predicted every severity outcome. Pregnant women were significantly less prone to

216

develop pneumonia and lower risk for in-hospital death. Diabetes and hypertension

217

predicted every severity outcome significantly. Even when obesity increased the risk for

218

pneumonia, more susceptible to receiving mechanical ventilation, and admitted at the

219

ICU, obesity was not a predictor of in-hospital death.

Discussion
The present study has provided an overview of the severity outcomes among

232

hospitalized patients due to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in Mexico

233

between February 28 and June 30, 2020. Nationwide, to the studied date, a

234

hospitalization rate of 58.3 per 100,000 inhabitants was observed. By the end of April

235

2020, the in-hospital mortality rate was 27.85%. By July 30, we observed that 33.5%

236

died while assisted in hospitals. The national in-hospital mortality rate increased during

237

May and June.

238

The average age of the population of hospitalized patients in Mexico is between

239

55 years, with males' predominance (62.62%). However, it changes concerning the

240

population. In different studies, the median is at 41 years with a higher proportion in

241

men (56.5%) and a wide range of patients who coexist with some medical comorbidity

242

(12-67%), adding that the prevalence of hypertension (16%), diabetes (10.1%) and

243

respiratory diseases (2%) in other populations was lower in comparison to this study

244

[23]. In a follow-up and surveillance of cases study in the United States, the median was

245

48 years with similar proportions between the genders, thus indicating that the

246

frequencies of comorbidities were different in contrast to this study, since there is a

247

lower rate of patients with diabetes (30.2%) and cardiovascular diseases including

248

hypertension (32.2%) in this population. However, the percentages of patients with

249

respiratory diseases (17.5%), CPK (7.6%), and immunocompromised (5.3%) were

250

higher in comparison to the hospitalized patients in the present study [5].

251

Concerning the pediatric patients, the average age in our population varies in

252

comparison to other studies that had reported six years as the median age of pediatric

253

patients. However, this differs according to the age range, determined to consider a

254

pediatric patient in systematic reviews [24, 25]. Patel NA reported in a systematic

255

review that the most common underlying clinical conditions in pediatric patients with

256

COVID-19 disease were asthma, immunosuppression, and cardiovascular diseases, this

257

conditions being prevalent in 21% of the patients, however, in our study, only 10% of

258

patients had any comorbidity, adding that there were also cases of patients with

259

diabetes, hypertension and CKD [26]. Concerning mechanical ventilation and ICU

260

admission, the evidence reported that 0.7% of patients avoided both, which is lower

261

than what we found in this study, with 11.57% of patients requiring mechanical

262

ventilator assistance and 22.29% of patients admitted to the ICU. Even when we

263

observed lower mortality (9.08%) among pediatric patients, compared to other groups

264

of patients distributed by age, the pediatric mortality is almost ten times greater than the

265

one reported by Meena J in 4,476 patients, of which five individuals died [27].

266

In the present study, patients aged >65, had a proportion of death (51.99%) that

267

surpassed the frequency of survival when hospitalized. It is not surprising that all

268

comorbidities were more prevalent among male elderly patients and that every severity

269

outcome was more frequent. Odds of developing pneumonia, receiving mechanical

270

ventilation, being assisted at the ICU, and having a fatal outcome during hospital stay

271

were higher among men and tended to increase with age. These findings are consistent

272

with similar clinical series from China [23, 28]. Still, they are discordant with the

273

conclusions of the Martín-Sanchez, et al. study [29], where advanced age predicted not

274

being admitted at the ICU. These findings from the Spain series may also have

275

underlying explanations from non-clinical nature, partially derived from resource

276

administration and hospital decision-making.

277

Comorbidities distribution among patients in this study is congruent with the

278

high prevalence of chronic diseases among adult Mexican men, which reached 75.2% of

279

the adult population according to the latest national health survey; additionally, 10.3%

280

of the population has diabetes [30]. Mexico has been identified as the second country

281

with the largest population affected by obesity [31].

282

Yang J et al., in their systematic review noted that hypertension and diabetes

283

were the most common comorbidities followed by cardiovascular and respiratory

284

diseases; they also mention that the severity and clinical course of COVID-19 disease

285

were related to these health conditions. Furthermore, Du RH et al. indicate that patients

286

over 65 have a higher risk of dying from the disease [7,32]. In the present study,

287

hypertension and diabetes were also the most common comorbidities among

288

hospitalized patients, and consistent with our results, the advanced age and those with

289

pre-existing cardiovascular disease, were significant predictions of hospital mortality.

290

A study by Vardabas et al. reports that smoking is also associated with a

291

negative progression of the disease since it presents a more significant probability (RR

292

1.4) of showing worsening of the symptoms to 2.4 times the likelihood of requiring

293

mechanical ventilation, admission to the ICU, and risk of death [6]. However, in this

294

study, that was not the case since smoking was not found to be a risk factor for severity

295

outcomes.

296

We have presented how obesity was related to higher odds of developing

297

pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, and assisted in the ICU. Still, we found that obesity

298

was not a predictor of death. To some degree, our findings are similar to those reported

299

by Tamara A, et al. where it was found that obesity predicted mechanical ventilation

15

300

and that a higher degree of obesity was a more reliable predictor [33]. Mexican triage

301

guidelines and official national algorithms for clinical practice describe the route of

302

action and clinical care peculiarities of patients with pneumonia, diabetes, immune

303

impairment, and CPK, consisting of individualized, isolated, or ICU management [21].

304

Based on our findings, we believe that these algorithms may have had a positive

305

impact on patients' decision-making with the mentioned comorbidities. Still, we

306

consider that updates to such guidelines, including specific evaluation for asthma and

307

COPD ungrouped, could benefit Mexican patients. Our findings showed that patients

308

with respiratory conditions did not proportionally receive more frequently mechanical

309

ventilation or admittance to intensive care unit even when they were significantly more

310

susceptible to die, even after adjusting for age and gender.

311
312

Limitations

313

Limitations of the present study derive from its retrospective design: first are

314

those resulting from data obtained from the epidemiologic surveillance system Open

315

Access datasets that may or may not include reporting or coding defects. Nevertheless,

316

all information is validated and ratified at different administrative levels. The study does

317

not allow us to analyze any acute comorbidities that could have happened

318

simultaneously in hospitalized patients. Lastly, as in any other health system with

319

COVID-19 sentinel surveillance, we may have unintentionally excluded patients

320

hospitalized but were not tested for COVID-19.

321
322
323

Implications and recommendations
Clinical practice guidelines, triage instruments, and algorithms have been

326

resource allocation for patients with algorithms for respiratory conditions, including

327

asthma and COPD.

328
329

Conclusions

330

Overall, in-hospital mortality in Mexico due to COVID-19 up to June 30 was

331

35.72%; among pediatric patients, it was 9.11%, and more than half of patients aged

332

>65 died. The most common comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes. Male

333

gender, age, hypertension, and diabetes predicted pneumonia, mechanical ventilation,

334

attention in ICU, and death. Obesity increased the odds of pneumonia, of receiving

335

mechanical ventilation and admittance at the ICU, but did not increase death risk.

336

Contrastingly, patients with CPOD and/or asthma had increased risk for death but did

337

not receive mechanical ventilation nor were assisted at the intensive care unit more

338

frequency.
