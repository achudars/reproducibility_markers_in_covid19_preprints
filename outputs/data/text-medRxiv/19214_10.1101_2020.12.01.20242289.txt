Commentary

10

The time course and burden of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on the herd

11

immunity threshold (HIT) of the virus, which is the fraction of the population that needs to be

12

immunized for an epidemic to slow in the absence of mitigation efforts. Estimates for the

13

COVID-19 HIT range from 6% to over 60%1,2. Given that roughly 10% of the global population

14

has been infected3, the low end of this range implies that the pandemic should soon burn out on

15

its own, while the high end paints a grim picture of future morbidity and mortality, in the absence

16

of pervasive non-pharmacological interventions, efficacious vaccines, or life-saving drugs.

17

The recent publication of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD), which calls for

18

relaxing all public health interventions on young, healthy individuals, has brought the question of

19

herd immunity to the forefront of COVID-19 policy discussions4,5. The authors state that

20

“immunity in the population is playing a substantial role in controlling the spread,” tacitly

21

referencing preprints by multiple GBD authors that posit HITs of 10-20%2,6. Evidence against

22

this claim is mounting, including pandemic resurgences throughout Europe and the US and

23

attack rates exceeding 50% in the hardest hit regions and congregate living settings7–9.

24

Given that this unpublished work is fundamentally shaping public discourse and global

25

policy, reconciling its claims with the rapidly evolving state of the pandemic is paramount. To

26

this end, we reevaluated the core model from the study and have identified a fundamental flaw

27

that leads to underestimation of the COVID-19 HIT. The authors sought to identify the cause of

28

the summer slowdown in four European countries by fitting an SEIR-like model of COVID-19

29

transmission to case count data up to July of 2020. The analysis is structured so that one of two

30

explanations are possible. Either the pandemic is self-limiting (i.e., the HIT is low) or social

31

distancing and other community mitigation efforts slowed transmission. However, teasing apart

32

the contributions of these factors from the case data alone is statistically impossible. In other

33

words, one cannot estimate the HIT without making assumptions about the efficacy of

34

community mitigation, and vice versa (See supplement).

35

So the researchers made a strong assumption about community mitigation efforts in

36

Europe in the spring and summer of 2020. Roughly, they assume that Europe locked down

37

throughout April and then returned to normal (linearly) by the end of August (Figure 1A - Blue).

38

By assuming that interventions disappear steeply, the model concludes that the pandemic must

39

be fading due to immunity buildup, and thus estimates low HITs. As it turns out, the derived HIT

40

is highly sensitive to the assumed timeline of mitigation (Figure S2-S3) and we have good

41

reason to believe their assumption is flawed. The authors use mobility traces to justify their

42

pattern2, but other precautionary policies like school closures, wearing of face coverings, and

43

social distancing have likely kept transmission repressed far below the pre-April baseline

44

(Figure 1A - Black). When we plug this plausible scenario into the Aguas et al. model2 (Figure

45

1A - Green), the COVID-19 HIT estimate increases six-fold for Belgium, three-fold for England,

46

ten-fold for Portugal, and six-fold for Spain (Figure 1B). A range of alternative scenarios produce

47

similar estimates (Figure S2-S3). If policymakers were to adopt a herd immunity strategy, in

48

which the virus is allowed to spread relatively unimpeded, we project that cumulative COVID-19

49

deaths would total almost 650,000 (95% CI: 500,000 - 780,000) across all four countries

through the end of the pandemic under the revised HIT estimates, roughly five-fold higher that

51

projected under the original low HIT estimates (Figure S4).

52

The fragility of the Aguas et al. study2 undermines a key premise of GBD and other

53

recent calls for “herd immunity” strategies. To their credit, the authors clearly demonstrate that

54

population heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection can dramatically lower the herd immunity

55

threshold10. However, their model can only disentangle the impacts of heterogeneity versus

56

interventions on COVID-19 transmission when approached with sufficient data and validated

57

assumptions. Our rough, but arguably more plausible, re-estimates of the COVID-19 HIT

58

corroborate strong signals in the data and compelling arguments that most of the globe remains

59

far from herd immunity. Moreover, abandoning community mitigation efforts would jeopardize

60

the welfare of communities and integrity of healthcare systems.

Overview

27

The low COVID-19 herd immunity thresholds (HITs) of 6-21% estimated in
Aguas et al. [1] are inconsistent with other model-derived estimates [5, 9, 2] and
seroprevalence-based estimates from some of the hardest hit regions around the
world [3]. To explain this apparent discrepancy, we conducted a thorough review
of their methods and code. We identified key assumptions about the timing and
extent of community mitigation efforts that shift the COVID-19 HIT estimates
downward. As their code was made openly available (https://github.com/
mgmgomes1/covid), we apply their exact model structure and fitting procedure
to evaluate the sensitivity of the HIT estimates to these assumptions.
Below, we detail our: (1) slight modification to their model fitting procedure, (2) sensitivity analyses with respect to the assumed mitigation curves (i.e.,
timing and magnitude of transmission reduction via non-pharmacological interventions), (3) derivation of alternate plausible mitigation curves from the Oxford
COVID-19 Government Response Tracker response index data, (4) long-range
COVID-19 mortality projections depending on the estimate HIT, and, finally (5)
mathematical argument regarding the statistical non-identifiability the model
(i.e., inability to simulataneously estimate the impact of community mitigation and population heterogeneity). The code used for the primary analyses
along with the data can be accessed here: https://github.com/pratyush16/

Modification to the Aguas et al. model

We slightly modified the modeling framework of Aguas et al. [1] to include
an additional month of COVID-19 incidence data (through August 7th, 2020)
for Belgium (https://epistat.wiv-isp.be/covid/) and England (https://
coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/about-data). For Portugal and Spain we

analyzed data through July 10th, 2020 as in [1]. We made this adjustment to
address a strong tendency of the model to estimate a low HIT without evidence
of increased transmission following intense mitigation during the initial stay at
home orders.

Sensitivity of COVID-19 HIT estimates to mitigation curves

We analyzed the sensitivity of the HIT estimates from Aguas et al. to variations
in the assumed temporal progression of the mitigation curves within their modeling framework. Specifically they assume a general shape of mitigation where
mitigation begins, increases until it reaches a maximum level, remains at the
maximum for some time, and then slowly returns to a baseline of no mitigation.
In this shape there are five key parameters governing the progression: (1) the
time that mitigation begins, (2) the time it takes for mitigation to take full
effect, (3) the maximum impact of mitigation, (4) the duration that mitigation
remains at maximum, and (5) the time for mitigation to be completely removed.
The modeling framework fits the timing that mitigation begins and the maximum impact it will have, but makes assumptions about the remaining parameters. Their framework assumes that once mitigation begins it will take 21 days
to reach a maximum level, will remain there for 30 days, and will subsequently
return to the original baseline level after 120 days. They test sensitivity to
slight deviations of the time to return to baseline and find minimal change in
HIT estimates looking at 150 or 180 days. As noted in the manuscript and
seen in Figure 1, we believed their assumptions about mitigation progression
were driving their low HIT estimates, so we tested the sensitivity of the low
HIT estimates to a wide-range of values for the maximum mitigation duration
(Figure S2) and times to return back to baseline (Figure S3). It’s clear that
the model is sensitive to the assumed shape of mitigation, with HIT estimates
ranging from almost 5% to 85% depending on the country and assumed shape.
It is clear that the estimated HITs are extremely sensitive to these assumptions, and that there are many combinations of heterogeneity and mitigation
progression that can give similar fits (described in the next section), so it is
extremely important that the assumed mitigation curves match reality. While
Aguas et al. matched their mitigation shapes to mobility data, these data are not
an accurate picture for total transmission mitigation, as decoupling of mobility
and transmission has been previously noted as populations adopt precautionary
behavior like mask wearing and social distancing [12].
Instead, we focused on the government response index developed by researchers at the University of Oxford [7]. This index captures 18 policy indicators widely implemented around the world, and produces an overall value
that captures the strength of government responses through time as shown in
Figure 1A. We found that the Aguas et al baseline assumptions did not match
the actual progression of mitigation policies, and instead chose to fit the esti-

sponse index. We assumed the baseline assumptions of 21 days to implement
mitigation and 30 days at maximum mitigation impact, and fit the timing to
completely remove mitigation based on the trends in the government response
index. Fitted estimates for the time to return to normal can be found in Figure
S3 for each country, and are almost an order of magnitude larger than assumed
in Aguas et al (120): Belgium (828 days), England (1,130 days), Portugal (981
days), and Spain (1,033 days). While the government response index also likely
doesn’t capture the full progression of community mitigation, because it doesn’t
capture adherence to policies, we feel that it likely captures general countrywide
trends better than mobility data alone.

procedure as Aguas et al. using either their assumed mitigation curve or our
revised version, we then calculated the mortality cost of following a “herd immunity strategy” using the estimated parameters from each European country.
For each European country we used the estimated final epidemic size estimated
for that scenario as the total infection count and an infection fatality rate of
0.68% (95% CI: 0.53%-0.82%) [10]. For the US, we assumed average final epidemic sizes based on the average of the estimates for the four countries for each
assumed mitigation curve scenario, which suggests final epidemic sizes of 13.9%
and 79.2% for the Aguas et al. and alternative scenarios respectively. Estimates
for both scenarios can be seen in Figure S4. Country population sizes were assumed to be 56,286,961 (England), 11,607,113 (Belgium), 10,186,314 (Portugal),

Non-identifiability of the model

The model fitting procedure from Aguas et al. explains transmission dynamics
between mitigation and population heterogeneity, which impacts herd immunity thresholds. In Aguas et al., they begin with assumed mitigation curves and
estimate the herd immunity threshold. Here we describe mathematically why
their estimation procedure is only identifiable with strong assumptions about
the shape of the mitigation curves. We first break down the model structure
into component parts to make clear the tension between mitigation and herd
immunity. Then we use this analytical framework to flip their estimation procedure around to show how one can estimate mitigation curves that fit epidemic
trajectories for any assumed herd immunity threshold.
To start, consider an SEIR model with variable susceptibility St (x) and
time-dependent mitigation Mt due to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs),
as given in Aguas et al.:

where R0 is the basic reproduction number,
Rt = Reff (t) is the effective reproR
duction number at time t, and S̄t = x0 St (x0 )dx0 is the mean susceptibility at
time t. More generally, we can consider time-dependent effective reproduction
numbers of the form
Rt = R0 Ft (S)Mt ,
(1)
where Ft (S) is some functional of the variable susceptibility St (x) as a function
of x (notice that the functional itself does not change over time, but that the
resulting function has a time dependence since St (x) does). The model of Aguas
et al. corresponds to the case when Ft (S) = S̄t . From this equation it is already
clear that given a time series Rt , we can for every t only infer the combined
impact of heterogeneity and mitigation (the product Ft (S)Mt ), but not each
separately.
Now consider R̃t = Rt /Mt = R0 Ft (S), the effective reproduction number if
there wasnno intervention at all (i.e.,
o if Mt ≡ 1). Herd immunity is reached at
T = min t0 : R̃t ≤ 1 for all t ≥ t0 (i.e., the first time after which R̃t remains
at or below 1), and the corresponding herd immunity threshold is

Deriving mitigation curves from herd immunity thresholds
We now show how it is possible to derive a mitigation curve Mt that is consistent
with the dynamics under Gamma-distributed variable susceptibility for a given
herd immunity threshold.
To begin, let us reparameterize time in terms of the proportion of susceptibles
St to make our calculations simpler. First, Note that St is strictly monotone
decreasing so long as λt Mt > 0 for all t (i.e., both the force of infection and
mitigation curve are strictly positive), and that S0 = 1 and St → 0 as t → ∞.
Let σt = 1 − St . Then, we can reparameterize time by t 7→ σ (i.e., [0, ∞) 7→
[0, 1]). That is, Equation (1) becomes
Rσ = R0 Fσ Mσ .

155

Assume that Ft and Rt are given. Then Mσ can be calculated as
Mσ =

Rσ

R0 Fσ

Let us write script letters for log of the values:
Mσ = log(Mσ ) = log(Rσ ) − log(R0 ) − log(Fσ ) = Rσ − R0 − Fσ .

157
158

Since Ft (S) = (St )(a+1)/a , we have that Fσ = (1 − σ)(a+1)/a . Therefore, Fσ =
a+1
a log(1 − σ) and
Mσ = Rσ − R0 −

log(1 − σ).

As before, herd immunity is reached at the value S∗ of S at which no growth
occurs in the absence of intervention, i.e., Rt /Mt ≡ R∗ /M∗ = 1. That is,
1 = R0 F∗ (S∗ ),

161
162

and therefore F∗ (S∗ ) = R0−1 . Let σ∗ = 1 − S∗ = HIT. Since F (S) = S (a+1)/a ,
this implies

This gives us a formula for calculating a mitigation curve Mt that is consistent
with the underlying variable susceptibility model of Aguas et al., for any chosen
value of a herd immunity threshold.

Computing mitigation curves as a function of herd immunity threshold
We can see from the previous section that the model is attempting to match the
dynamics seen in the data through a combination of mitigation and herd immunity as impacted through population heterogeneity. To further show why strong
mitigation assumptions are needed to estimate the herd immunity thresholds,
we show how one can craft mitigation curves to match dynamics for a wide
range of herd immunity thresholds for each of the four countries investigated
(Belgium, England, Portugal, and Spain).
Using Equation (2), we can estimate daily mitigation impacts for a given herd
immunity threshold (HIT) given the necessary data. To do so, one only needs
estimates for the basic reproduction number (R0 ), daily effective reproduction
number (Rt ), and the proportion of the population still susceptible to the disease
(St ). For each of the four countries we first estimated Rt using the available
case data and a common method for measuring the instantaneous reproduction
number assuming a mean serial interval of 5.8 days and standard deviation of
4.48 days [4, 8]. We took the largest value of Rt as our rough estimate for the
R0 . Finally, we used the case data and the estimated country-specific reporting

rates estimated in Aguas et al. to estimate the true incidence of disease each
day, which we converted to St using St = St−1 − Ct /ρ. Here, Ct is the number
of the reported cases in that country at time t, and ρ is the country-specific
reporting rate from Aguas et al: Belgium (0.06), Portugal (0.09), Spain (0.059),
England (0.024).
In Figure S5 we show the calculated mitigation curves for each country across
a range of potential HITs from 20% to 70%.
