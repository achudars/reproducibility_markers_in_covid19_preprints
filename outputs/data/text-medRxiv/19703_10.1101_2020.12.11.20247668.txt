Abstract
Aberrant mucosal immunity has been suggested to play a pivotal role in
pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most common form of
glomerulonephritis worldwide. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causal pathogen of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a global concern. However, whether
the mucosal immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 influences the clinical
manifestations of IgAN patients remains unknown. Here we tracked the
SARS-CoV-2 anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody levels in a cohort of
88 COVID-19 patients. We found that 52.3% of the COVID-19 patients
produced more SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgA than IgG or IgM, and the levels of
the IgA were stable during 4-41 days of infection. Among these IgA-dominated
COVID-19 patients, we found a severe COVID-19 patient concurrent with IgAN.
The renal function of the patient declined presenting with increased serum
creatinine during the infection and till 7 months post infection. This patient
predominantly produced anti-RBD IgA as well as total IgA in the serum
compared to that of healthy controls. The analysis of the IgA-coated microbiota
as well as proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, which was mainly produced in the
intestine, reveals intestinal inflammation, although no obvious gastrointestinal
symptom was reported. The mucosal immune responses in the lung are not
evaluated due to the lack of samples from respiratory tract. Collectively, our
work highlights the potential adverse effect of the mucosal immune response
towards SARS-CoV-2, and additional care should be taken for COVID-19
patients with chronic diseases like IgAN.

Introduction
IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of glomerulonephritis
worldwide [1-3], characterized by deposition of IgA or IgA-containing
circulating immune complexes in glomerular mesangium [3, 4]. Although the
cause of IgAN remains unclear, IgA was suggested to play a key role in the
disease pathogenesis. Evidence from genetic, experimental and clinical
studies has suggested the involvements of genetic predisposition and infection
[5]. Etiologic factors may trigger an aberrant mucosal immune IgA response
either in lung, or in intestine, interacting with genetic predisposition, leading to
the onset and progression of IgAN [5-8]. For example, seasonal flu infections
were reported to trigger the pathogenesis of IgAN [9-11]. Currently, the highly
contagious, rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic.
However, whether and how the mucosal immune response caused by
SARS-CoV-2 influences the progression of IgAN remains unknown.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor required for
cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 [12, 13], which was highly expressed in both lung
and intestine [14, 15]. Consistently, although pneumonia is the most common
symptom in patients with moderate to severe illness [16-21], 17.6% of
COVID-19 patients developed gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea,
anorexia and nausea [22-25]. It was reported that 12 out of 173 patients who
recovered from COVID-19 were re-detectable positive in SARS-CoV-2 RNA
test, which was found to be associated with the potential intestinal infection of
SARS-CoV-2

in

these

patients

[26-29].

Moreover,

besides

direct

gastrointestinal infection, recent studies reported SARS-CoV-2 results in
intestinal dysbiosis of the microbiota, along with the increase of the
opportunistic pathogens in the intestine [30-32].
IgA is the most abundant antibody isotype in the mucosal immune system
such as intestine and lung to offer humoral protection against microbial
pathogens [33]. Ejemel et al. showed human anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA efficiently
neutralize the virus at mucosal surface by binding to the spike protein of

SARS-CoV-2 [34]. Several studies also demonstrated the role of serum
anti-SAR-CoV-2 IgA in diagnosing of recovered COVID-19 patients [34-38].
However, mucosal IgA responses may also promote the disease pathogenesis
of IgA vasculitis with nephritis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) and Kawasaki
disease (KD) [39-42]. Thus, this study was designed to systemically evaluate
the mucosal humoral immune response towards SARS-CoV-2 and its potential
role in disease progress of IgAN.
Intriguingly, we found more than half of COVID-19 patients showed an
IgA-dominant phenotype, suggests that SARS-CoV-2 induced strong mucosal
immune response. One of the IgA-dominant patients, who was diagnosed with
IgAN before, was found to get a declined renal function during and after
recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to high levels of IgA in both serum
and feces. Besides the severe pneumonia, this patient also produced higher
pro-inflammatory cytokine from the intestine. Thus, we speculate that mucosal
immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 in intestine and lung may worsen the
renal function and promote the IgAN progression in IgAN patients. Extra care
should be taken for COVID-19 patients with chronic diseases like IgAN.

Material and Method
Patient cohort
88 COVID-19 patients with average age of 47.35±15.69 years (range 21-91)
were enrolled, including 88 patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC
and the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University [43] and one
patient concurrent with IgAN who underwent kidney transplant (hereafter
referred as COVID-19 IgAN case; Supplementary Note 1) from People’s
Hospital of Wuhan University. Specifically, all patients had positive testing for
viral nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 (Real-Time Fluorescent RT-PCR Kit, BGI,
Shenzhen). Among them, six were critically ill and admitted to intensive care
unit, one of which was died of cerebral hemorrhage after stroke. Seventeen
patients

were severely infected and

all

of them received oxygen

supplementation treatment. Fifty-six patients showed moderate illness and
nine patients showed mild infection. Underline symptoms were found in
thirty-seven (42.0%) patients; hypertension in eighteen (20.5%) was the most
common one.
A total of 218 serum samples collected during the hospitalization and after
discharge were tested for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein specific antibodies.
31 (35.2%), 19 (21.6%), 16 (18.2%), 12 (13.6%), 8 (9.1%), 1 (1.1%), and 1
(1.1%) patients’ blood were collected for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 times,
respectively. This cohort contains 50 archived sera from healthy donors
collected before October 2019 as healthy controls to evaluate the reliability of
the measurements. Besides, urine and fecal samples from the COVID-19 IgAN
case at 5-month (day 160) and 7-month (day 209) after discharge were also
collected. Serum, urine and fecal samples from 5 matched healthy controls
were correspondingly collected for the COVID-19 IgAN case.
This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee
of the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC (approval number: 2020-XG(H)-014)
and the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (approval number:
Quick-PJ 2020-04-16).

Measurement of serum immunoglobins
SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA, IgM and IgG detection kits using chemiluminescent
method were developed by Kangrun Biotech (Guangzhou, China), in which the
receptor binding domain of spike was coated onto magnetic particles to catch
SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA, IgM and IgG in patient samples. A second antibody
that recognizes IgA, IgM, or IgG conjugated with acridinium (which can react
with substrates to generate a strong chemiluminescence) was used for
detecting IgA, IgM and IgG, respectively. The detected chemiluminescent
signal over background signal was calculated as relative light units (RLU). It
has been validated in a large cohort of serum samples showing high
sensitivities and specificities [44]. Serum samples were collected by

centrifugation of whole blood in test tubes at room temperature for 15 min,
1000 x g. Prior to testing, a denaturant solution was added to each serum to a
final concentration of 1% TNBP, 1% Triton X-100. After adequate mixing by
inverting, the samples were incubated at 30°C for 4 hours to completely
denature any potential viruses. Virus-inactivated serum samples were then
diluted 40 times with dilution buffer and subjected to testing at room
temperature. Then RLU was measured using a fully automatic chemical
luminescent immunoanalyzer, Kaeser 1000 (Kangrun Biotech, Guangzhou,
China).

Measurement of total IgA and IL-18
For the COVID-19 IgAN patient, total IgA and IL18 were also detected. The
total IgA in the serum, urine and fecal was measured using a human
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) ELISA kit (CUSABIO, CSB-E07985h) according to
manufacturer’s instruction. The serum IL-18 was detected by ELISA Kit (Sino
Biological) according to instructions of the vendor.

Fecal IgA flow cytometry
Fecal samples of the COVID-19 IgAN patient were stored at -80 °C until the
time of following analyses. Fecal pellets collected directly from frozen human
fecal material were placed in Fast Prep Lysing Matrix D tubes containing
ceramic beads (MP Biomedicals) and incubated in 1 mL Phosphate Buffered
Saline (PBS) per 100 mg fecal material on ice for 15 min. Fecal pellets were
homogenized by bead beating for 5 seconds and then centrifuged (50 x g, 15
min, 4°C) to remove large particles. Fecal bacteria in the supernatants were
removed (100 µL/sample), washed with 1 mL PBS containing 1% (w/v) Bovine
Serum Albumin (BSA, American Bioanalytical; staining buffer) and centrifuged
for 5 min (8,000 x g, 4°C). After an additional wash, bacterial pellets were
resuspended in 100 µL blocking buffer (staining buffer containing 20% Normal
Mouse Serum for human samples, from Jackson Immuno Research),

incubated for 20 min on ice, and then stained with 100 µL staining buffer
containing PE-conjugated Anti-Human IgA (1:10; Miltenyi Biotec clone
IS11-8E10) for 30 minutes on ice. Samples were then washed 3 times with 1
mL staining buffer before flow cytometric analysis.

Statistical analysis
The sample size chosen for our experiments in this study was estimated based
on our prior experience of performing similar sets of experiments. For all the
bar graphs, data were expressed as mean ± SEM. A standard two-tailed
unpaired Student’s t-test was performed using GraphPad Prism 7. P values ≤
0.05 were considered significant. The sample sizes (biological replicates),
specific statistical tests used, and the main effects of our statistical analyses
for each experiment were detailed in each figure legend.

Results
More than half of COVID-19 patients produced more anti-RBD IgA than
IgG or IgM during SARS-CoV-2 infection
Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD antibodies in the serum of the 88
COVID-19 patients showed that 46 (52.3%) patients were IgA-dominated
during the infection (Figure 1a). The IgA level was the highest in

virus, and mycoplasma pneumoniae virus, were all negative. Computer
tomography (CT) of chest showed infectious lesions in both lungs. During 16th
Jan to 20th Jan, her body temperature fluctuated between 36.9 and 38 °C.
White blood cells (4.24×109/L, reference: 3.5~9.5×109/L) was within the normal
range; Lymphocyte count was low (0.60×109/L, reference: 1.0~3.2×109/L);
CD4+ T cell count was 186×109/L (reference: 404~1,612×109/L). On 20th Jan
(day 1), a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
assay via nasopharyngeal swab confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the
infection period, serum creatinine of the patient increased to 197 μmol/L.
Worse proteinuria was also reported but 24-hour urine protein was not
measured due to medical limitations at the very moment. The patient condition
deteriorated into respiratory failure and required ventilatory support. Specific
COVID-19 management with immunosuppression reduction (mycophenolate
withdrawal and tacrolimus withdrawal) was attempted immediately, including
methylprednisolone (40 mg/d) injected intravenously for anti-inflammation,
human blood gamma globulin (10 g/d) injected intravenously for immunity
enhancement, moxifloxacin hydrochloride (4.5 g/d) and sulfanilamide (6
pieces/d) for anti-microbial infection, Posaconazole (30 ml/d) for anti-fungi
infection, and Aciclovir (250 mg/d)/Oseltamivir (150 mg/d) for antiviral
treatment. The patient’s condition was obviously improved and stable
afterwards. However, the serum creatinine levels went to the top (208 μmol/L)
at 4 months and remained high (190-195 μmol/L) even after 7 months post
infection. Clinical and laboratory characteristics are shown in Table 1, Figure 2.

Figure 2. The clinical manifestations, medications and parameters of renal functions
of the COVID-19 IgAN case.

Intestinal inflammation was observed in the COVID-19 IgAN case
We first tracked the SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgA, IgG, IgM antibodies in the
serum, urine, and feces of this COVID-19 IgAN case and compared with those
from healthy controls. Results revealed that all the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA,
IgG and IgM responses were higher in the serum of the case compared to
healthy controls, with the IgA increase being the most significant (Figure 3a).
To our surprise, the IgA antibody retained high even though it was 7 months
post infection (anti-RBD IgA RLU: 138475±26834, anti-RBD IgM RLU:
18084±967, anti-RBD IgG RLU: 36991±7665). However, the increase of
anti-RBD IgA, IgG, IgM antibodies was not observed in urine or fecal samples
of this COVID-19 IgAN case. (Figure 3a). The anti-RBD IgA, IgG, IgM levels in
respiratory samples and mucosal samples in both intestine and lung were not
measured due to the limitations to collect these samples.
Interestingly, total IgA was much higher in both serum and fecal samples
of this patient compared to that of healthy control (Figure 3a), leading to the
hypothesis that the infection in the intestine may contribute to the production of
IgA. Therefore, accompanied by increased IgA-coated microbiota (Figure 3b),

higher serum IL-18, a primary mediator of the inflammation [45], also reflects a
more inflamed gut (Figure 3a).

Discussion
Herein, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 as an infectious agent activated
aberrant mucosal humoral response both in lung and intestine, which may
have a long-term side-effect on renal function in an IgAN patient recovered
from COVID-19. By focusing on the humoral response towards SARS-CoV-2
in a cohort of COVID-19 patients, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgA
was the leading functional isotype in the patients’ serum during the infection
and the ratio of patients presented with IgA-dominant response is as high as
52.3%. Further, among these COVID-19 patients with IgA-dominant humoral
response, we found a patient who had a history of IgAN showed severe
pneumonia. An increased serum creatinine and worse proteinuria were
observed during and even after the patient recovered from the SARS-CoV-2
infection. In addition to severe pneumonia, the patient developed intestinal
dysbiosis and produced higher pro-inflammatory cytokine from the intestine.
Collectively, our work revealed that aberrant mucosal IgA against SARS-CoV-2
may contribute to kidney pathogenesis and IgAN progression.
The hit1 of the classic “Four Hits theory” of IgAN pathogenesis begins with
IgA production and abnormalities in circulating IgA [46]. The response of the
mesangium and the deposited IgA is crucial to the development of IgAN [47].
The source of these pathogenic IgA in IgAN has been an emerging area of
study.

Both mesangial IgA and the increased fraction in serum IgA are

polymeric, which is normally produced at mucosal surfaces, leading to the
suspicion that IgAN was intimately linked with abnormal mucosal immune
response against microorganisms [47]. For example, episodic macroscopic
hematuria after upper respiratory infections was common in IgAN patients [48].
Tonsillectomy can improve urinary findings and IgA deposits, thus have a
favorable effect on long-term renal survival in some IgAN patients [49, 50].
Since IgA is widely found in the gut mucosal immune system, gut microbiota
dysbiosis has also been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of IgAN
[51-53]. Exclusive differences in gut microbiota composition has been

investigated in patients with IgAN and healthy controls [52]. Targeted release
of budesonide to the distal ileum was reported to reduces proteinuria and
stabilize renal function in IgAN patients [54]. In addition, recent studies
reported that the gut microbiota signature of COVID-19 patients was different
from that of healthy controls [31]; COVID-19 patients showed a significant
dysbiosis of fecal microbiome, characterized by enrichment of opportunistic
pathogens and depletion of beneficial commensals [30]. Results from our
experiments showed that total IgA was also much higher in the serum and
fecal of this patient compared to that of healthy control; the gut microbiota
dysbiosis and higher level of proinflammatory cytokine were also identified in
this patient.
Mucosal humoral response protects human from viral infections. IgA
responses were detected in patients infected with influenza A(H1N1) pdm09
virus and a >4-fold increases in IgA response to A(H1N1) pdm09
hemagglutinin (HA) was found in 67% of A(H1N1) pdm09-infected persons
[55]. In the current pandemic, research found that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA
dominates the early neutralizing antibody response against SRAS-CoV-2 [56].
The IgA level was higher in critically ill patients compared to those with mild to
moderate illness [43, 57]; and it peaked at the first to third weeks of onset and
declines after one month [43, 56]. Based on an estimated decline rates of
virus-specific antibodies using a previously established exponential decay
model of antibody kinetics after infection, researchers reported that the
predicted days when convalescent patients' anti-RBD IgA reaches to an
undetectable level are approximately 108 days after hospital discharge [58]. A
preprint by Gaebler et al. reports that in a longitudinal analysis of
SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses in 87 patients, memory B cells
potentially generating anti-RBD IgA persisted up to 6 months after infection
and displayed with increased neutralization potency and breadth [59]. Further,
study reported peripheral expansion of mucosal-homing IgA-plasmablasts
cells at the early onset of the symptom and peaked during third week of the

infection [56]. Reliable evidence has been provided in supporting that the
SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgA titer in the serum would accurately reflect that of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 sIgA [60, 61]. These evidences suggested that assessment
of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgA can yield reliable information of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 mucosal immunity. In the current study, the COVID-19 IgAN
patient produced predominately anti-RBD IgA and the level was still high until
month 7, during this time the kidney function was found to be reversely
associated with serum IgA level. Therefore, the mucosal immune response
against SARS-CoV-2 might have contributed to the progression of IgAN in this
patient.
Nearly one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected nearly
69,000,000 people globally and caused over 1,600,000 deaths by December,
2020, there is still much that we do not understand. However, we shall be
better prepared in handling the COVID-19 patients comparing to that in the
initial unexpected exposure. The impact of COVID-19 on glomerular disease
has been largely contracted to acute kidney injury, which occurred in nearly 46%
of hospitalized patients [62]. Like the majority of kidney diseases, the
mechanisms are mostly likely the direct viral infection, inflammatory
syndrome-mediated injury, hemodynamic instability and the hypercoagulable
state, all of which may have happened during infection. However, presentation
of one case reporting concurrent IgAN after SARS-CoV-2 recovery raised
great concerns regarding to the hidden and prolonged impact SARS-CoV-2
infection may have caused [63]. Most concerning is the persistence of IgA
antibody and memory B cells with the IgA-generating potency in patients who
have already recovered from COVID-19. We have yet to fully appreciate their
potential for progression to IgAN or even end-stage kidney disease. Thus,
additional care should be taken for especially COVID-19 IgAN patients. For
example, a complete medical history needs to be taken for newly diagnosed
COVID-19 patients to alert doctors with additional aspects of disease
progression. Further, like the COVID-19 IgAN case we reported here, others

who recovered from the infection and are prone to develop IgA-related disease
are suggested to complete a regular follow-up, so as to monitor disease
conditions properly. Least but not least, it is important to avoid all forms of
infections that might result in IgA abnormalities.
We acknowledge that the limitation of the study is the shortness of patient
and a lack of evidence from kidney biopsy in the only COVID-19 IgAN case.
Nonetheless, the long-term regular follow-up, strict supervision of the patient’s
kidney condition, and our laboratory evidence suggest that the high level of
mucosal IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the declined
renal function.
In conclusion, our study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates
aberrant mucosal humoral IgA in the lung and intestine against SARS-CoV-2
and may have contributed to kidney damage and potentially promoted IgAN
progression. Thus, our work highlights the potential adverse effects of the
humoral immune response towards SARS-CoV-2, and additional care should
be taken for COVID-19 patients with chronic diseases like IgAN.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Supplementary Note 1.
The COVID-19 IgAN case is a female, 39-yesr-old. She developed
proteinuria 19 years ago, taking traditional Chinese medicine for treatment,
and the urinary protein was around 2.0 g/L; no kidney biopsy was performed.
About 14 years ago, she observed massive proteinuria, and urinary protein
was increased to 5.0 g/L, kidney biopsy was performed. Pathological diagnosis
indicated IgAN, including diffused mesangial hyperplasia with focal nodular
sclerosis and mild renal tubulointerstitial lesions. She underwent kidney
transplantation 25 months ago. Prednisone (5 mg/d), tacrolimus (5 mg/d), and
mycophenolate (0.5 g/d) were applied for after surgery treatment. Urinary
protein reduced to 0.22 g/L and 0.15 g/L, 22.5 months and 24 months after
surgery, respectively. Serum creatinine was around 170 μmol/L. No other
abnormal indicators were reported.
