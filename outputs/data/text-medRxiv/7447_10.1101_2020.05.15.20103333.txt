MD

ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious
illness caused by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). There is growing evidence regarding the imaging findings of COVID-19, in Chest
X-ray and CT scan, however their availability in this pandemic outbreak might be
compromised. At this moment, the role of Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS)
has yet to be explored.
OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study is to describe the POCUS findings of
the disease in COVID-19 patients admitted to the emergency department (ED).
Determining the correlation of these parameters with vital signs, laboratory results
and chest X-ray, as well as, therapeutic decisions and prognosis.
METHODS: Prospective study carried out in the emergency department (ED) of two
academic hospitals. High suspicion or confirmed COVID-19 patients were subjected
to the ultrasonographic measurement of the inferior vena cava (IVC), focused cardiac
ultrasound (FOCUS), and Lung Ultrasonography (Lung POCUS).
RESULTS: Between March and April 2020, ninety-six patients were enrolled. The
mean age was 68.2 years (SD 17.5). The most common finding in Lung POCUS was

an irregular pleural line (63.2%) followed by bilateral confluent (55.2%) and isolated
B-lines (53.1%), which was associated with a positive RT-PCR (OR 4.729, 95% CI:
1.989-11.246; p<0.001), and correlated with IL-6 levels (rho = 0.622; p = 0.002). The
IVC moderately correlated with levels of pO2, expiratory (rho = -0.539; p =0.014)
and inspiratory (rho = -0.527; p =0.017), with troponin I (rho = 0.509; p=0.03). After
POCUS exam, almost 20% of the patients had an associated condition that required a
change in the treatment or management.
CONCLUSION: In this pandemic era, as the shortage of resources constitutes an
undeniable public health threat, POCUS presents the potential to impact in diagnosis,
management and prognosis of our confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.

INTRODUCTION:
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious illness caused by the
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The 11th of March
of 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic caused by a novel
coronavirus, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), with the spread to more than 180 countries (1), 2.274.800 cases confirmed and
156.140 deaths caused (2).
In this emergency, is critical the ability to quickly characterize a confirmed or
suspected case, moreover as almost any emergency department will struggle to keep
up with the increasing number of patients and the shortage of health resources.
The main diagnostic method is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) of the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs (3).
However, it has many limitations such as the low sensitivity or the technical
difficulties to perform it (4).
There have been different studies suggesting that CT abnormalities had a highly
sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, and should be considered as a
screening tool (4). Moreover, different clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters
have been associated with prognosis (5) and to guide therapy (6).
However, since these diagnostic, laboratory and therapy resources may not be
ubiquitously available, we need alternative modalities to quicker characterize our
patient.
Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) is ubiquitous, is quickly completed following
simple and easy to apply protocols (5), therefore it can be performed in mild or even
unstable patients, in different settings. The presence of subpleural consolidations,

thickened pleural lines and B-lines are highly specific for interstitial syndrome and in
these cases suggest the presence of COVID-19 pneumonia (7-8).
The role and impact of this technique in this pandemic has not been explored yet.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:
Prospective study carried out in the emergency department (ED) of two academic
hospitals. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki,
and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of each University Hospital
involved. Informed consent was obtained from each enrolled patient.

Patient selection:
Patients admitted to the ED with the clinical suspicion of COVID-19 (temperature
above 37.2ºC or acute respiratory symptoms or gastrointestinal symptoms or fatigue)
requiring X-ray for evaluation. We excluded patients <18 years or who refused to
participate. A convenience sample of patients who met these inclusion criteria were
consecutively enrolled and prospectively studied.
Subjects were followed during the following week, either during hospitalization or
after hospital discharge, which occurred first.

Initial patient assessment:
Initial evaluation of the patients included recording medical history: demographic
data, comorbidities, medications; symptoms; physical exam: temperature, blood
pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation; Chest X-ray and
laboratory tests: hemogram, basic metabolic panel (glucose, electrolytes, kidney
function, liver enzymes, etc.), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Ferritin, Interleukin-6

(IL-6), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Procalcitonin, blood gasses (lactate and pH) and
coagulation (D-dimer, INR, PTT, Fibrinogen).

Ultrasound data collection:
Two emergency physicians with long-standing experience in POCUS (experienced
sonologists on the basis of the American College of Emergency Physicians
ultrasonographic guidelines and more than 10 ultrasound exams performed per week,
5 years of experience in performing and interpreting POCUS (9)) performed all
ultrasound exams. Therefore, an opportunity sampling method was implemented for
patient selection.
Participants were subjected to ultrasonographic measurement of the inferior vena cava
(IVC) and a focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS). A Lung Ultrasonography (LUS)
was performed following a 12-zone protocol (10). Each intercostal space of upper and
lower parts of the anterior, lateral, and posterior regions of the left and right chest wall
was carefully examined, and findings (pleural effusion, confluent and isolated B-lines,
irregular pleural line, small and lobar consolidations) were recorded (7).
The examinations were performed using a GE LOGIQ-e ultrasound system fitted with
a phased and curvilinear array transducer (1.5–4.5 MHz) (General Electrics
Healthcare, Madrid, Spain) as a cart-based device and a Butterfly IQ, as a hand-held
device.
The physicians were blinded to the patient past medical history, vital signs, symptoms
or laboratory measurements.

Outcome measures and definitions:
The main purpose of this study is to describe and characterize the POCUS findings of

the disease in COVID-19 patients admitted to the emergency department (ED). The
primary outcome was to determine the impact of POCUS parameters to predict the
prognosis of patients with high suspicion or confirmed COVID-19. The secondary
outcome was to correlate these parameters with the physical exam, laboratory markers
and chest X-ray.
We defined a confirmed case any patient with clinical symptoms and positive RTPCR, and high suspicion case to any patient with negative RT-PCR but compatible
clinical symptoms and typical X-ray, CT scan or Lung POCUS.

Statistical analysis:
Baseline characteristics are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) for
continuous variables and count and proportions for categorical variables. For group
comparisons, we used t-test for continuous variables and the Chi-square or Fisher
exact test for categorical one. The correlations between continuous variables were
tested using Spearman’s rho test for categorical variables. Mean values were reported
along with 95 % confidence intervals. Statistical significance was set at p value <
0.05.
Statistical analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS software v20.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA).

RESULTS:
Ninety-six patients were enrolled between March and April 2020 (summarized in
Table 1). The mean age was 68.2 years (SD 17.5). Fifty patients (52,1%) were female.
Nearly half of the patients were hypertensive (49%, 47 patients), being most of them
on Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or Angiotensin receptor

blockers (ARB) therapy. The most common presenting symptom was dyspnea
(67.7%) and fever (65.6%), and the mean onset symptoms were 6 days (SD 5.0). The
patients were normotensive and had low oxygen saturation (91.8%, SD 6.1), with a
respiratory rate of 15 rpm (SD 4.2), needing supplemental oxygen (69.7%). The mean
lymphocyte count was 1.34 x10^9 (SD 1.8), C-reactive protein (CRP) of 106.5
(96.8%) and Lactate dehydrogenase of 304 U/L (SD 157.1) at admission. The main
therapy was hydroxicholoquine (50 patients, 60.4%). At the end of the first week
follow-up, 6 patients had died (6.3%) and 17 were discharged to home (17.1%).

- Imaging modalities: Chest X-ray and Ultrasound studies
All included patients went through a Point-of-Care ultrasonography (POCUS) study
and almost all of them had a chest X-ray (see Table 2).
The most frequent pattern in chest X-ray was an interstitial pattern (56.4%), and more
than a third had ground-glass opacities (GGO). Almost 30% of them had a normal
chest X-ray.
Regarding the Lung POCUS, the most common finding was an irregular pleural line
(63.2%) followed by bilateral confluent (55.2%) and isolated B-lines (53.1%). 4
patients had a completely normal lung ultrasound. 22 patients (23%) had pleural
effusion. The expiratory and inspiratory average diameters of the inferior vena cava
(IVC) were 14.1 (6.4) and 6.8 (6.2) mm, respectively. The focused cardiac ultrasound
(FOCUS) revealed a low ejection fraction in 10 patients.
After POCUS exam, almost 20% of the patients had an associated condition that
required a change in the treatment or management.

The presence of bilateral confluent B-lines was associated with a positive RT-PCR
(Odds Ratio - OR: 4.729, 95% Confidence Interval - CI: 1.989-11.246, p< 0.001),
with a sensitivity (S) of 71.7% and a specificity (Sp) of 65.1%, positive predictive
value (PPV) of 61.5% and negative (NPV) of 71.7%. Whereas for chest X-ray had a S
of 62.2%, Sp of 71.4%, PPV 88.5% and NPV 34.9% (OR: 4.107, 95% CI: 1.42711.818, p= 0.006).
The presence of isolated B-lines was associated with a positive RT-PCR (OR: 3.172,
95% CI: 1.145-8.792, p= 0.023), with a S of 86.8% and a Sp of 32.6%, positive
PPV of 61.3% and NPV of 66.7%. When considering positive and indeterminate RTPCR it was associated with a S of 81.7%, Sp of 42.9%, PPV 89.3% and NPV 28.5%
(OR: 3.350, 95% CI: 1.012-11.094, p= 0.04).

- Correlation of POCUS and Chest X-ray
The presence of confluent B-lines was associated with pathological findings in the
chest X-ray with a S 83.8, Sp 66.7, PPV 89.9 and NPV 53.8 (OR: 10.333, 95% CI:
3.447-30.976, p<0.001). The presence of consolidations (small and lobar) was
associated with a pathological X-ray, with a S 73, Sp 61.9, PPV 87.1 and NPV 39.4
(OR: 4.388, 95% CI: 1.583-12.158, p= 0.003).
Bilateral confluent B-lines was associated with the finding of an interstitial pattern
with a S 75.5%, Sp 70,7%, PPV 76.9% and NPV 69% (OR: 2.392, 95% CI: 1.0125.654, p< 0.001), and ground-glass opacities (GGO) with a S 32.4%, Sp 53.4%,
NPV 72.1% and PPV 48.1% (OR: 2.392, 95% CI: 1.012-5.654, p= 0.045).
However, we did not find any significant association with isolated B-lines and
interstitial pattern (p=0.156), GGO (0.928) or any pathologic X-ray findings
(p=0.831).

- Correlation of POCUS and Laboratory Parameters
The number of affected areas on Lung POCUS was moderately to strongly correlated
to interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels: confluent B-lines (rho = 0.622; p = 0.002), irregular
pleural line (rho = 0.509; p = 0.013); as well as a high inspiratory IVC (rho = 0.550;
p=0.007). A pathologic Chest X-ray showed a lower correlation (rho = 0.442;
p=0.035). Other laboratory and inflammatory markers showed a good correlation with
IL-6: CRP (rho = 0.604; p=0.002), Procalcitonin (rho = 0.504; p=0.024), Ferritin (rho
= 0.579; p=0.005), AST (rho = 0.635; p=0.001) and LDH (rho 0.695; p<0.001). The
highest correlation was found with the respiratory rate (rho = 0.789; p<0.001) and
NT-proBNP (0.990; p=0.001). These patients were more prone to receive an anti-IL-6
therapy (rho = 0.612; p=0.002).
The IVC moderately correlated with levels of pO2, expiratory (rho = -0.539; p
=0.014) and inspiratory (rho = -0.527; p =0.017), with troponin I (rho = 0.509;
p=0.03).
Patients with more comorbid diseases were more prone to have apical lungs

poor outcome (rho = 0.217; p=0.034), such as mortality or need of mechanical
ventilation, it was comparable to lymphocyte count (rho = -0.273; p=0.009),
creatinine (rho = 0.267; p=0.011) and Procalcitonin (rho = 0.367; p =0.002).

- Correlation of POCUS and Therapy
Patients with confluent B-lines had higher chances to receive anti-IL-6 therapy (rho =

0.206; p=0.045), and lobar consolidation with hydroxicholoroquine (rho = 0.810;
P=0.001). Remarkably this correlation was much lower when small consolidations
(rho = 252, p=0.013), confluent (rho= 0.262; p=0.01) or isolated (rho = 0.279,
p=0.006) B-lines were present.

DISCUSSION:
Safety and quality are vital components in ED patient’s management. Many hospitals
are struggling to reduce ED o ve r crowding and increase patient safety through
multimodal interventions on patient flow in the ED, especially with laboratory and
diagnostic imaging departments (11).
There is growing literature regarding the prognostic factors (5), diagnosis (3-4) and
therapeutic challenges (6) in COVID-19 patients.
- Diagnosis:
The positivity rate of RT-PCR has been quantified as 63% in nasal swab and 32% in
pharyngeal swab (12), similar to our results, we found a positive rate of only 59.5%.
Due to its limitations, diagnostic imaging plays a key role in the management of these
patients.
A study of 1049 patients undergoing chest CT scan and RT-PCR testing determined
that CT abnormalities had a highly sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (4),
suggesting that CT scan should be considered as a screening tool, especially in
epidemic areas with high pre-test probability. However, the use of CT scan in the ED
has many limitations, such as the radiation exposure, especially for mild illness, the
low availability and the contraindication of its use in unstable patients.

Therefore in many centers CT scans have been replaced for chest X-ray. However, as
we have seen, chest X-ray has shown to have a very low NPV (34.9%). In a study of
patients undergoing an initial screening for COVID-19, they found a sensitivity of
25% and a specificity of 90% (13).
In our study we found that 27 patients with normal chest X-ray, 23 (85.1%) had a
pathological POCUS finding. A previous study found that a normal chest X-ray was
present in 31% of COVID-19 RT-PCR positive patients (14), which is similar to our
results (28.4%). We hypothesize that this is due to the low accuracy of X-ray for
detecting interstitial abnormalities (5), represented in our study as isolated B-lines on
Lung POCUS, and becoming apparent on X-ray as the disease progresses, with the
appearance of confluent B-lines and other findings.
- Therapy:
By adding POCUS to our protocol, we could safely exclude the probability of other
synchronous or comorbid diseases, such as deep vein thrombosis, pericardial effusion,
heart failure or lobar pneumonia (highly suggestive of bacterial origin), in our study
seen in approximately 1 out of 5 patients (18.8%). These findings should trigger the
initiation or adjustment of therapy (i.e. antibiotics, anticoagulants, diuretics or, even,
colchicine).
Moreover, we showed that that the number of affected lung areas correlates with
inflammatory markers, such as IL-6, which in turned could serve as a guide to start
therapy with an anti-IL-6 therapy (i.e. tocilizumab). Remarkably, but probably
expected, this marker was associated with a higher respiratory rate, acute phase
reactants (CRP, Procalcitonin, Ferritin) and LDH, which according to previous studies
are also prognostic markers (5). Although we did not see a correlation with ICU

admission, therapeutic or invasive procedures or death, this could be due to the short
follow-up (one week).
- Follow-up and prognosis:
There has been proposed that changes in the proportion of CT scan GGO lesion, crazy
paving pattern and consolidation varies with time and disease progression (15-16),
which could be a marker of the stage of the disease. As this disease tends to rapid
progression, CT scan may not be available or the patient condition does not allow to
perform it (14). As previously reported in COVID-19 era, there is a correlation of
Lung POCUS findings to those of the CT scan (17-18), therefore follow-up could be
more easily replaced with POCUS as it would be more accessible, and should be
explored in future studies.
The presence of apical lung involvement on POCUS correlates in our study with
different comorbid diseases (hypertension, cardiomyopathy, dementia) comparable to
that yield by different laboratory markers (creatinine, lymphocyte count or
procalcitonin), and as expected, in the prognosis (5).
The IVC, as a marker of fluid status, moderately correlated with levels of pO2 and
troponin I, which could represent a situation of hemodynamic congestion and worse
oxygenation. Therefore, we believe that integrating the IVC in our current practice is
appropriate as it addresses more physiologically the assessment of the volume status.
In our study we found a higher prevalence of pleural effusion (23%) than previously
reported (14, 16), this could be due to the accuracy of the technique, compared to CT
scan or chest X-ray (19), therefore its mere presence should not be considered as a
prognostic factor.

- Strengths:
To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the potential impact of POCUS in
COVID-19 patients, with diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications.
We want to share our study findings, given the urgent need for different strategies in
order to better manage COVID-19 patients, and diminish the SARS-CoV-2 spread
and its prognosis in the current pandemic context. As the shortage of resources
constitutes an undeniable public health threat, we consider POCUS to be a potential
solution, and recommend that it should be performed as a first-line imaging test for
COVID-19 patients.
- Limitations:
There are several limitations to consider. The main limitation is that Lung POCUS
findings overlap with those from other pneumonia etiologies. However, in epidemic
areas, positive Lung POCUS features, even in negative RT-PCR or chest X-ray can
still be highly suggestive of COVID-19 infection, which could preclude that the
sensitivity and specificity reported of Lung POCUS might be higher, and therefore
more studies should be carried, comparing with other techniques (i.e. CT scan). Many
COVID-19 patients in our ED, with negative RT-PCR or chest X-ray, do not always
get a chest CT performed, and therefore there is a chance of misdiagnosis.
Mini mized, as the pat ients were followed-up, by reviewing their electronic history,
and any complication was recorded.
Another limitation is that selection bias might have occurred. Two experts
sonographers performed all ultrasound scans on a consecutive sample selected based
on their availability (during their working hours), which limits the generalizability of
our results. The impact of this limitation is minimized by the variable schedule and

changing shifts, unpredictable a priori (in continuous care). Additionally, false
negative ultrasound might be found in the initial stage of the disease, before lung
involvement.
Thus, the results from this study open an opportunity to further investigate the use of
ultrasound in different settings and clinical scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS:
In this pandemic era, as the shortage of resources constitutes an undeniable public
health threat, Point-of-Care Ultrasonography presents the potential to impact in
diagnosis, management and prognosis of our confirmed or suspected COVID-19
patients.
