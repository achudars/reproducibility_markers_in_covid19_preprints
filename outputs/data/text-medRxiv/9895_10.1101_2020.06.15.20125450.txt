Abstract:
The novel coronavirus pandemic is posing significant challenges to healthcare
workers (HCWs) in adjusting to redeployed clinical settings and enhanced risk to
their own health. Studies suggest a variable impact of COVID-19 based on factors
such as age, gender, comorbidities and ethnicity. Workplace measures such as
personal protective equipment (PPE), social distancing (SD) and avoidance of
exposure for the vulnerable, mitigate this risk. This online questionnaire-based study
explored the impact of gender and religion in addition to workplace measures
associated with risk of COVID-19 in hospital doctors in acute and mental health
institutions in the UK.
The survey had 1206 responses, majority (94%) from BAME backgrounds. A quarter
of the respondents had either confirmed or suspected COVID-19, a similar
proportion reported inadequate PPE and 2/3 could not comply with SD. One third
reported being reprimanded in relation to PPE or avoidance of risk. In univariate
analysis, age over 50 years, being female, Muslim and inability to avoid exposure in
the workplace was associated with risk of COVID-19. On multivariate analysis,
inadequate PPE remained an independent predictor with a twofold (OR 2.29, (CI 1.22-4.33), p=0.01) risk of COVID-19.
This study demonstrates that PPE, SD and workplace measures to mitigate risk
remain important for reducing risk of COVID-19 in hospital doctors. Gender and
religion did not appear to be independent determinants. It is imperative that
employers consolidate risk reduction measures and foster a culture of safety to
encourage employees to voice any safety concerns. (240 words)

Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a global threat affecting people from all
backgrounds (1). Healthcare workers (HCWs) inevitably carry a high risk of
contracting the disease (2,3). Several studies have shown significant disparity in the
severity of COVID-19 and outcomes based on ethnicity, among other factors (4-8).
Multiple factors including comorbidities and social deprivation have been proposed to
contribute to high mortality in Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) people (5-8).
Even after adjusting for inherent differences, people of BAME backgrounds are twice
as likely to die from COVID-19 as compared to their white counterparts (9). This is
also seen in HCWs in the UK National Health Service (NHS), where the BAME
community makes up 20% of the overall workforce but accounts for two-thirds of
COVID-19 related deaths (10). Furthermore, BAME doctors form 44% of NHS
doctors, and 94% of the mortality statistics (11).
Population based data from China and Italy has shown that men appear to be at a
higher risk of COVID-19 infection (12,13). However, studies from HCWs in other
countries suggest a higher proportion of females (average 70%) in COVID-19
(14,15). This may be due to a higher number of frontline HCWs being female. At
least one analysis of HCW who died in the UK showed that 39% of nurses and 94%
of doctors were male. In addition, among those who died, 71% of nurses and 94% of
doctors were from BAME backgrounds. (11). Gender differences have been
observed in other outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and
Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, where significantly higher fatality rates were
reported in males (16,17). The disproportionately high death rate from COVID-19 in
HCWs from BAME background appears to be only partially explained by age,
gender, socio-demographic features and underlying health conditions (6,8).
Thirteen percent of respondents in the NHS Staff survey in 2019 reported
discrimination; due to ethnicity (45%), gender (22%) and religion (6%) (18,19). The
same survey showed 31% staff experienced bullying or harassment at work. A
survey conducted by the British Medical Association (BMA) during this pandemic
suggested 64% of staff from BAME background felt pressured to work in settings
with inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) as compared to 33% of their
white colleagues (20,21). Studies from our group have previously shown that,
amongst HCWs, BAME background and adverse workplace measures were
predictors of higher risk of COVID-19 (22,23).
A meta-analysis has confirmed that viral spread is reduced with the use of eye
protection, face masks and social distancing (of greater than one metre) in
healthcare settings and supports their use in minimising exposure to healthcare staff
(24). Various risk assessment frameworks and scores now include ethnicity and
gender as variables (25,26,27), however these appear to be mostly based on
extrapolation of data obtained from population studies, rather than specific data on
HCWs. This study explores the contribution of gender and religious identity in
addition to workplace measures, as well as being reprimanded (for asking or wearing
PPE) in risk analysis for hospital doctors who have self-reported COVID19.

Aims:
An online survey was designed to explore the hypothesis that hospital doctors had a
variable risk of COVID-19, due to differential treatment based on their gender or
religion.
This would manifest in differential rates of (a) access to PPE, (b) compliance with
social distancing (SD) at work and (c) access to employer supported self-isolation
(SI) when identified as ‘vulnerable’ based on Public Health England (PHE) guidance
(28,29).
Primary outcome was a self-reported diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by a positive
viral swab test or self-isolation with symptoms of COVID-19 as per PHE guidance
where a test was not undertaken.
Method:
An anonymous, online survey using Survey Monkey® was undertaken which was
open to hospital doctors from acute and mental health NHS Trusts in the United
Kingdom. The survey was designed and distributed by British Association of
Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO) Institute for Health Research (BIHR) &
Education subcommittee of the Association of Pakistani Physicians of Northern
Europe (APPNE). The survey questions are available in the appendix. Data variables
collected are shown in Table 1. The study was reviewed by institutional review
board, BIHR; and no formal ethics review was required to conduct this survey.
The online survey link was sent to all members of both the organisations and doctors
from wider communities in the UK, using email and social media. The survey
specified an implied consent to share the data and results with appropriate agencies
or organisations involved directly or indirectly in HCWs and COVID-19 pandemic
measures. No personal identifiable information was collected. Data was stored at
the BAPIO/BIHR office in compliance with UK General Data Protection Regulations.
Study population & Statistical Analysis
A convenience sample of survey responses was planned to be collected over a fourweek period; similar to previous surveys (22,23). The survey results are reported as
cross-tabulation of proportions between the different primary categorical variables
(based on gender and religion). Descriptive statistics were used for primary
categorical variables. Univariate analysis was conducted between groups of
categorical variables using Fisher Exact 2-tailed test (GraphPadPRISM®).
Multivariable model was constructed including demographic (age-group and number
of household members, ethnicity, gender, religions), clinical setting (teaching, nonteaching or mental health trusts) and exposure to COVID-19 (areas caring for
COVID-19 patients, PPE, SD). Non-significant variables from univariate analysis
were excluded from final models. Regression analysis was conducted using SPSS
v26 software (IBM Inc., USA) and reported as odds ratio (OD), 95% confidence
interval (CI) and significant when p-value <0.05 (non-significant values were reported
as ‘ns’).

Results
(i) Population
The survey received 1206 responses between 26 April and 29 May 2020. Table 2
shows the characteristics of the respondents and Table 3 summarises the status of
workplace measures reported by the respondents. Majority (65.6%) were working in
a teaching hospital setting, 38.8% were over 50 years of age, 70.9% were male,
93.7% were from BAME background and their religious identities were Hindu
(44.5%), Muslim (32.1%) or Christian (10.4%).
About a quarter identified themselves as ‘vulnerable’ according to PHE defined
criteria. Age distribution of the respondents is shown in Figure 1. COVID-19
diagnosis was confirmed in 104 (8.6%) and, 213 (17.7%) were in self-isolation due to
symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (suspected COVID-19) as shown in Figure 2.

with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Only 61.3% reported (strongly or somewhat)
adequate access to PPE, 35.7% were able to comply with SD (most or all times) and
68.9% were able to negotiate different working environment to reduce risk. There
was an incremental rise in COVID-19 with inadequate PPE and inability to comply
with SD at work (Figures 3 and 4).

(ii) The Impact of Gender
In our survey, 1202 responses were included for analysis to explore gender
differences in risk of COVID-19. Female respondents were of a younger age (73.2 %
versus 56.3 %; p <0.0001) and a lower proportion identified as ‘vulnerable’.
Our analysis showed no gender differences in accessing to PPE, ability to comply
with SD, redeployment or working in high risk areas (Table 3). A higher proportion of
female respondents reported confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (30% versus 25%; p
=0.04). Male respondents had a higher proportion of confirmed cases (9.6% versus
6.3%, p =0.07).
(iii) The Impact of Religion
The majority of respondents identified themselves as Christians (n=125, 10.4 %),
Muslim (n=387, 32.1%) or Hindu (n=537, 44.5%). The remaining respondents (n =
157, 13%) who identified themselves as Sikh, Jewish, Buddhist, or with no religion
(see Table 3) were in small numbers and thus were excluded from analysis.
Amongst Christians, 95 were from BAME background, whilst 30 were white.
Access to PPE was significantly lower (24% versus 30.5%, p = 0.0133) amongst
Muslims. A higher proportion of Muslims (35 % versus 28%, p =0.01) reported being
reprimanded for wearing or asking for PPE. There was no difference between Hindu
or Muslim respondents in other workplace variables, such as working with COVID-19
patients, ability to practice SD or redeployment compared to either overall Christian
or BAME-Christian respondents.
In this cohort, Muslims had a higher prevalence of suspected or confirmed COVID19 compared to Hindus (34.6 % versus 19.3%, OR 2.18; 95% CI 1.52 - 2.95, p
<0.001); but not to ‘all Christians (29.6%)’ or ‘BAME-Christians (28.4%)’.
(iv) Risk of COVID-19
Univariate analysis:
All variables related to workplace measures (except re-deployment) were
significantly associated with higher risk of COVID-19 (Table 4). There was a higher
self-reported COVID-19 in respondents below the age of 50 years. Other variables;
such as number of household members, ethnicity or vulnerability were not significant
(Table 4).
Multivariate analysis
(a)
Model I: This model included Hindu and Muslim respondents only, thus
excluding 282 respondents (125 Christians and 157 ‘others’ and with ‘no religious’
identity). In this model, none of the demographic variables were significant predictors
of COVID-19. Out of the six variables determining occupational risk, inadequate
PPE was an independent predictor for COVID-19 (OR 2.22 (95% CI 1.31 - 3.76, p =
0.003).
(b)
Model II: This model compared Hindu (547), Muslim (387) and ChristianBAME respondents (95) (excluding 30 white respondents) (Table 5). In this model,
none of the demographic variables were found to be significant predictors of COVID19. Inadequate PPE remained the only independent predictor for self-reported
COVID-19 (OR 2.29 (95% CI 1.22-4.33, p =0.01)).

Discussion
COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a major public health challenge. As far as we
are aware, that this is the first survey that has studied gender and religion in the
context of hospital doctors and risks of self-reported COVID-19. Hospital doctors are
at an increased risk due to a higher exposure while caring for COVID-19 patients but
also due to inconsistent access to appropriate PPE and compliance to SD at work
(22,23,24). This is in addition to any applicable population-based risk factors (such
as age, gender and comorbidities (4-9,12,24).
Many researchers have suggested risk assessment frameworks to minimise harm to
those at highest risk (25,26) but these appear to be based on models of clinical risks
and extrapolation of general population data. More recently, there has been a
suggestion to include occupational factors in such a framework (27). We have
previously reported data on HCWs including hospital doctors from the UK,
demonstrating workplace measures and ethnicity were independent predictors of
COVID-19 (22,23). The current study further explores additional characteristics such
as gender and religion as risk factors COVID-19.
We found that women were more likely to report a diagnosis of COVID-19 but this
was not found to be significant on multivariate analysis. Our study population
included a higher proportion of women under 40 years of age (32% versus 17%),
who were more likely to report a diagnosis of COVID-19. This may be representative
of the demographics of the NHS frontline workforce (18,19). We found that gender
and age were not independent predictors of COVID-19 in our study, in multivariate
analysis. There is an excess risk of intensive care admissions and mortality from
COVID-19 in men and those above 70 years (4). Some NHS trusts have already
started risk stratification and are selectively redeploying BAME staff above 55 years,
away from high risk areas (30,31).

This survey was open to all hospital doctors in the UK, however most responses
received are likely from members of the two organisations representing doctors from
Indian sub-continent heritage. Hence, it is not surprising that a significant majority of
our respondents were from a BAME background and from three major religions
practiced in the Indian sub-continent. Religious identity was not found to be
statistically significant in determining risk, when adjusted for other factors in the
multivariable analysis (Table 5).
Compliance with social distancing remains a challenge. Almost 2/3rd of hospital
doctors reported not being able to comply with social distancing and this was
associated with increased risk of COVID-19. In the home, overcrowding and multigenerational households are also factors linked to higher exposure and hence
increased risk to people from BAME background. Our survey in hospital doctors did
not support this hypothesis. Data presented in the paper using a cut-off of five
household numbers, but it was not significant even when analysing for a threshold of
2 and 3 (similar to average household numbers in UK (32). This could be because
the socio-economic backgrounds of BAME hospital doctors are not comparable to
the general population.
PPE is known to be one of the key measures ensuring safety of staff from
occupational risk of COVID-19. There has been continued debate in the profession
regarding the supply and timely delivery of appropriate PPE. We, and others have
previously reported that many healthcare workers were not getting access to PPE as
per PHE or WHO recommendations.[ref] In this survey, 61% hospital doctors
reported appropriate access to PPE which is an improvement from 22%
demonstrated previously (22,23). However, after adjusting for confounding variables,
inadequate PPE remained an independent predictor with two-fold increased risk of
COVID-19, in this cohort.
Lack of PPE may be associated with a degree of anxiety and stress for staff, in high
risk clinical settings. In a previous survey by BMA, 64% of BAME staff felt pressured
to work in settings with inadequate PPE (20). We found almost 30% hospital doctors
reported being reprimanded for requesting PPE or risk avoidance measures (such as
social distancing or redeployment in lower risk areas) and this was more commonly
reported by Muslims. It would not be surprising that doctors facing discrimination are
unlikely to raise concerns about inadequate workplace measures. The 2019 NHS
staff survey and data from workforce race relations standards 2019 report (WRES)
(18,19) indicates that overall 13% staff reported discrimination and another 31%
reported facing bullying and undermining behaviour. The proportions were higher for
BAME staff. Ethnicity was reported as the most common reason (eight times higher
compared to the religious identity).
Our survey cohort is not directly comparable with the NHS staff survey as all our
respondents were doctors and majority were male and BAME background,
compared to 7.9% doctors 76% female and 20-40% from a BAME background). The
fact that one-third of hospital doctors’ reported being reprimanded is deeply
concerning. If hospital doctors (who have a more favourable educational and socioeconomic background) report facing this degree of discrimination, it is likely that the
experience may indeed be worse in other HCWs, more so from BAME backgrounds.
This needs to be addressed by NHS organisations and staff support groups.

This study has a few limitations. A key comparator to workplace measures would
have been between Caucasians and black ethnic respondents which had lower
representation in our survey. General limitations to online surveys are also
applicable to our survey.
Conclusions:
This survey contributes to the growing evidence of risk factors for COVID-19
amongst BAME doctors. Although the NHS has introduced risk assessment
frameworks, these are based on demographics, and the scored on individual
characteristics but not occupational or organisational influences. Access to PPE,
although improved compared to results from April, still remains prevalent and
inadequate access resulted in doubled the risk of COVID-19 for hospital doctors.
Inability to comply with SD at work poses a similar challenge. Gender and religion
did not contribute to additional risk, after adjusting to other variables in this study.
The unfortunate culture in the NHS, of being reprimanded or experiencing bullying
and undermining contributes to an unsafe workplace for staff and where mistakes
are more likely to lead to harm for patients. Hence, the focus needs to be on
developing a culture of openness where the concerns can be raised safely and
appropriate measures are taken to mitigate risks for staff and patients alike.
