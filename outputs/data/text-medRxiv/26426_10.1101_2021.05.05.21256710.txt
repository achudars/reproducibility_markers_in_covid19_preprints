Abstract
Background
Few longitudinal data on COVID-19 symptoms across the full spectrum of disease severity are
available. We evaluated symptom onset, severity and recovery up to nine months after illness onset.

Methods
The RECoVERED Study is a prospective cohort study based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
Participants aged>18 years were recruited following SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis via the local Public
Health Service and from hospitals. Standardised symptom questionnaires were completed at
recruitment, at one week and month after recruitment, and monthly thereafter. Clinical severity was
defined according to WHO criteria. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare time from illness
onset to symptom recovery, by clinical severity. We examined determinants of time to recovery
using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.

Results
Between 11 May 2020 and 31 January 2021, 301 COVID-19 patients (167[55%] male) were
recruited, of whom 99/301(32.9%) had mild, 140/301(46.5%) moderate, 30/301(10.0%) severe and
32/301(10.6%) critical disease. The proportion of symptomatic participants who reported at least
one persistent symptom at 12 weeks after illness onset was greater in those with severe/critical
disease (81.7%[95%CI=68.7-89.7%]) compared to those with mild or moderate disease
(33.0%[95%CI=23.0-43.3%] and 63.8%[95%CI=54.8-71.5%]). Even at nine months after illness
onset, almost half of all participants (42.1%[95%CI=35.6-48.5]) overall continued to report ≥1
symptom. Recovery was slower in participants with BMI≥30kg/m2 (HR 0.51[95%CI=0.30-0.87])
compared to those with BMI<25kg/m2, after adjusting for age, sex and number of comorbidities.

Conclusions
COVID-19 symptoms persisted for nine months after illness onset, even in those with mild disease.
Obesity was the most important determinant of speed of recovery from symptoms.

Evolution of COVID-19 symptoms during the first 9 months after illness onset

Manuscript

Introduction
The clinical spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), ranges from asymptomatic presentation to fatal illness.
Although the acute symptomatology of hospitalised patients has been well documented[1-4], less is
known about the symptomatology of milder cases. In addition, robust longitudinal data on the longterm persistence of symptoms and factors that may affect recovery are scarce.

A growing body of evidence suggests that post-COVID syndrome (i.e. long COVID or Post-Acute
Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection [PASC]) may negatively affect both individual quality of life and
the economic productivity of society [5-7]. A recent cross-sectional study from Wuhan, China, for
example, reported that the vast majority (76%) of previously hospitalised patients still suffered from
at least one symptom, most commonly fatigue, six months after symptom onset[7].

The RECoVERED study is a prospective cohort study of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection
across the full spectrum of disease severity. We evaluated the incidence, severity and duration of
symptoms in participants with mild, moderate, severe and critical COVID-19, and examined
determinants of time to recovery from symptoms.

Methods
Study design and participants
The RECoVERED study is an ongoing cohort study of individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The study aims to describe the immunological,
clinical and psychosocial sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recruitment of study participants began
on 11 May 2020. Non-hospitalised participants were identified from notification data at the Public
Health Service of Amsterdam (PHSA) and approached by telephone up to 7 days after SARS-CoV-2
diagnosis. Prospectively-enrolled hospitalised participants were approached on the COVID-19 wards
of two hospitals in Amsterdam. A limited number of hospitalised patients were enrolled retrospectively
until 30 June 2020 up to 3 months following SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. For the present analyses we
included all participants with a follow-up of at least one month by 28 February 2021.
Eligibility criteria included laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR, antigen testing
or serology; aged 16-85 years and adequate understanding of Dutch or English. Patients residing in
a nursing home prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection and those with mental disorders that would interfere
with adherence to study procedures were excluded.
The RECoVERED study was approved by the medical ethical review board of the Amsterdam
University Medical Centre (NL73759.018.20). All participants provided written informed consent.

Study procedures
At enrolment and at day 7 and month 1 of follow-up, a standardised questionnaire (based on the
World Health Organisation Case Report Form [8]) on the presence, start and stop dates, and severity
of 18 symptoms was completed by interviewing the participant (Figure S1). Participants subsequently
completed monthly questionnaires on the presence of symptoms.
Biological specimens were collected at each monthly study visit (Figure S1). Heart rate, respiratory
rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were measured at enrolment and at day 7 of follow-up, or
retrieved from hospital records for retrospectively-enrolled participants. Past medical history and
socio-demographic data were collected during the first month of follow-up, and data on COVID-19related complications, treatment, and investigations were collected at month 1 of follow-up and threemonthly from month 3. Self-reported data were verified with hospital electronic medical records when
available.

Definitions
Illness onset was the first day on which symptoms were experienced; for asymptomatic patients, this
was defined as the date of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Complete recovery was defined as resolution of
all COVID-19 symptoms. As per National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
guidelines[9], the acute phase of disease was defined as the first 4 weeks after illness onset, and
post-COVID syndrome as symptoms persisting at least 12 weeks after illness onset.
Clinical severity groups were defined based on WHO COVID-19 disease severity criteria[10]. Mild
disease was defined as having a RR<20/min and SpO2>94% on room air at both enrolment and day
7 study visits; moderate disease as having a RR20-30/min, SpO2 90-94% and/or receiving oxygen
therapy at enrolment or day 7 study visits; severe disease as having a RR>30/min or SpO2<90% at
enrolment or day 7 study visits; critical disease as requiring ICU admission as a result of COVID-19
at any point.

Symptom severity was measured on a four-point scale, with the exception of dyspnoea, measured
using the 6-point modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) breathlessness scale[11].
Comorbidities at illness onset were those listed by the WHO as associated with severe COVID-19[12]:
cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic lung disease (CLD), severe liver
disease, chronic kidney disease, immunodeficiency, cancer and/or cerebrovascular disease. Obesity
was excluded from the comorbidity variable because body mass index (BMI) was defined separately,
categorised in kg/m2 as: <25, underweight or normal weight; 25-30, overweight; >30, obese. Ethnicity
was based on the participant and their parents’ country of birth [13].
Loss to follow-up (LTFU) was defined as active withdrawal from the study or two consecutive no-show
appointments despite 3 attempts to establish contact. Date of LTFU was defined as the date of last
contact with the participant.

Statistical analyses
Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of participants were compared between clinical
severity groups.
The incidence proportions for 18 different symptoms at illness onset and one and four weeks after
illness onset were calculated as the number of participants reporting each symptom over the total
number of participants in follow-up at that point, and was compared by clinical severity group.
Asymptomatic participants contributed to the denominator. Given the potential recall bias in reporting
symptom onset, we restricted this analysis to prospectively-enrolled participants. For symptoms
reported by >20% of participants at 12 weeks in any severity group (the most persistent symptoms),
changes in self-reported symptom severity over time during the acute phase were visualised using
alluvial plots, both overall and by clinical severity group.
The proportion of participants with ongoing symptoms (firstly, with at least one symptom and secondly,
for each symptom separately) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and compared by
severity group using the log-rank test. The at-risk period began at illness onset and continued until
symptom recovery, loss to follow up, 9 months after illness onset, or last study visit prior to 28

February 2021 (i.e. administrative censor date), whichever occurred first. Asymptomatic participants
were excluded from all symptom survival analysis.
We assessed the effect of age, sex, BMI, and number of comorbidities at illness onset on time to
complete recovery from symptoms using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards
models in which these four variables were included. Interactions between BMI and the other variables
were assessed. Clinical severity was not included in the multivariable model due to collinearity with
the other variables. Two sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the impact of recall bias:
firstly, restricting the analysis to prospectively-enrolled participants and secondly, left-truncating
participants at the date of study entry (ignoring any recovery event occurring prior to enrolment).
A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata
(StataCorp LLC, v.15.1) and R (RStudio, v.1.2.5033).

Results
Study population
Between 11 May 2020 and 31 January 2021, 301 participants were enrolled, of whom the majority
(210/301;70.0%) prospectively. Of these 301 participants, 99 (33%) experienced mild, 140 (46%)
moderate, 30 (10%) severe and 32 (11%) critical disease (Table 1). Participants with severe or critical
disease were older than those with mild or moderate disease (p<0.001) and had higher BMI
(p=0.006). CVD, CLD, DM and immunosuppression were significantly more common among
participants with severe or critical COVID-19 compared to those with mild or moderate disease (Table
1). Median time from illness onset to recruitment was 8 days (IQR=5-12) for prospectively enrolled
and 85 days (IQR=73-94) for retrospectively enrolled participants. Until 28 February 2021, 42
participants were lost to follow-up. One death, due to COVID-19, occurred during follow-up.

Incidence proportions and severity of symptoms during the acute phase of infection
During the acute phase of infection, fatigue and cough were the most frequently reported symptoms
(Table 2). The incidence proportion for fatigue and cough as well as for fever, myalgia, loss of appetite,
diarrhoea, and nausea (part of the WHO COVID-19 case definition[14]) did not differ between clinical
severity groups during the acute phase (Table 2). By four weeks after illness onset, the incidence
proportion for dyspnoea was higher in participants with moderate and severe/critical disease (65%
and 67%, respectively; severe and critical participants combined due to small numbers) compared to
participants with mild disease (43%). Within the first week after illness onset, a significantly greater
proportion of patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 reported loss of smell and/or taste,
headache, rhinorrhoea and sore throat compared to the severe/critical COVID-19 group and, with the
exception of sore throat, this difference remained at one month after illness onset.

Transition plots showed that while most participants transitioned to a lower level of severity over time
across the five persistent symptoms (fatigue, cough, dyspnoea, loss of smell and/or taste and
myalgia), some transitioned to a higher severity level over time (Figure 1). Among those with mild

disease, the majority of participants reported loss of smell and/or taste as severe at baseline, although
most reported improvement within the first week of follow-up (Figures S2a-e).

Time to recovery from symptoms
Time to complete recovery was longer in symptomatic participants with moderate and severe/critical
disease than in those with mild COVID-19 (log-rank p<0.001; Figure 2). At least one ongoing symptom
was reported at 12 weeks after illness onset, by 33.0% (95%CI=23.0%-43.3%) of participants with
mild, 63.9% (95%CI=54.8-71.6%) with moderate and 81.7% (95%CI=68.7-89.7%) with severe/critical
disease. Among participants with mild disease, median time to complete recovery was 57 days
(Figure 2), although 20.3%(95%CI=11.4-30.9%) continued to report at least one ongoing symptom at
nine months after illness onset. Among participants with moderate and severe/critical disease, more
than half reported at least one ongoing symptom at nine months after illness onset
(53.0%[95%CI=43.2-61.8%] and 52.9%[95%CI=38.1-65.6%], respectively). Supplementary Figures
3a-e show Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the individual 18 symptoms, by clinical severity group.

Determinants of time to recovery from symptoms
BMI at illness onset showed the strongest association with time to complete recovery in multivariable
analyses: obese participants had a 46% (aHR 0.54, 95%CI=0.32-0.90]) and overweight participants
a 23% slower recovery (aHR 0.77, 95%CI=0.52-1.14]) compared to those of normal weight (p=0.046)
(Figure 3). No statistically significant interactions were identified between BMI and the other
covariates. Results were comparable in both sensitivity analyses (Figures S4a-b).

In multivariable analysis of time to recovery from each of the five most persistent symptoms (Table
S1a-e), being obese at illness onset was associated with slower recovery from cough (aHR 0.56,
95%CI=0.35-0.89) and loss of smell and/or taste (aHR 0.44, 95%CI=0.25-0.76). Increased age was
associated with slower recovery from cough (aHR 0.81, 95%CI=0.72-0.92), dyspnoea (aHR 0.82,
95%CI=0.70-0.96), and myalgia (aHR 0.74, 95%CI=0.65-0.85). Number of comorbidities at illness
onset was only associated with recovery from fatigue, where those with one comorbidity recovered
more than twice as slowly as those without comorbidities (aHR 0.45, 95%CI=0.28-0.72). When we

Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first to report detailed longitudinal data on the evolution of COVID19 symptoms in a cohort of individuals with mild to critical disease. We observed that the incidence
of certain hallmark COVID-19 symptoms were comparable between clinical severity groups during
the acute phase of illness. Despite an overall improvement in severity of the most persistent COVID19 symptoms during the first month of illness, one-third of the mild group, nearly two-thirds of the
moderate group and more than four-fifths of patients with severe/critical disease met NICE criteria for
post-COVID syndrome. Even at nine months after illness onset, one-fifth of those with mild disease
and over half of participants with either moderate or severe/critical disease experienced at least one
ongoing symptom. Obesity at illness onset was the strongest determinant of slow recovery from
symptoms.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, avoiding the immediate consequences of hospitalisation
and mortality has been the primary goal. Longer term sequelae of COVID-19 have received relatively
little attention, especially among non-hospitalised patients. In our study, the proportion of participants
reporting fatigue, fever and cough during the first month of illness were as high in mild COVID-19
patients as they were in moderate, severe or critical patients. Although time to recovery from
symptoms was shorter in those with mild disease, as many as one in three participants with mild
COVID-19 still reported symptoms 12 weeks after illness onset. Indeed, the proportion of participants
meeting the NICE definition of post-COVID syndrome in our cohort (57.8% overall) was comparable
to other prospective cohort studies[15, 16], but higher than estimates by the UK Office for National
Statistics and among healthcare workers [17, 18]. Although this could be partly explained by the fact
that we limited our analysis to symptomatic participants, the consequences of these proportions when
extrapolated to a global level may be substantial. As new viral variants and challenges in vaccination
programmes worldwide continue to hinder effective control measures, the number of people with postCOVID syndrome will only continue to increase.

Although patient advocacy groups have helped in making post-COVID syndrome a research
priority[19], studies to date have differed in study population, follow-up time and symptoms evaluated
[9], making it difficult to synthesize all available evidence. Moreover, the symptom profiles that falls
under post-COVID syndrome are diverse [20], resulting in a heterogenous patient group requiring
different management strategies. A universally accepted and evidence-based definition of postCOVID syndrome is key to comparing findings across studies and settings, and to develop syndromespecific interventions. Moreover, an validated risk score for post-COVID syndrome could help
prevention and identification of those requiring support. Our study, for example, suggests that obese
individuals, regardless of sex, age and number of comorbidities at illness onset, may benefit from
early intervention. In addition to its independent effect on recovery, obesity is associated with having
a lower socio-economic status and reduced access to health and care services[21], both of which
may also be associated with a slower recovery from symptoms. Over and above the impact of on
acute COVID-19 hospitalisation and mortality [4, 22], reducing the prevalence of obesity may also
help reduce the future burden of post-COVID syndrome.

Fatigue was the most commonly reported symptom both during the acute phase and at 12 weeks
from illness onset, including among individuals with mild or moderate disease. Previous analyses
have estimated that the societal impact of fatigue can be significant, due to both direct healthcare
costs and indirect financial losses resulting from reduced economic productivity[23]. As those with
mild COVID-19 represent the majority of COVID-19 cases worldwide in terms of absolute numbers,
developing strategies to prevent, diagnose and manage post-COVID fatigue should be an urgent
research priority. Among participants with moderate and severe/critical disease, dyspnoea and
myalgia additionally persisted beyond 12 weeks in a large proportion of participants. Similar results
have been reported in other settings: previously-hospitalised COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China still
had abnormal chest imaging findings and pulmonary diffusing capacity at 6 months after illness onset
[7], whilst a cross-sectional study of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the UK reported that the
majority of participants reported myalgia at a median follow-up of 16 weeks after discharge from
hospital[24]. In our multivariable analysis, older age was the most important determinant of slower

time to recovery from both of these symptoms. Exploring the underlying mechanism as to why these
symptoms persist in older patients may help identify interventions that could be beneficial in the
recovery process.

This study has several strengths. Frequent symptom questionnaires collected longitudinally since
illness onset allowed the natural progression of COVID-19 symptoms to be described to a level of
detail not previously reported. We were able to enrol patients with mild symptoms (underrepresented
in other studies) as well as those who were critically ill, so that the full spectrum of COVID-19 disease
could be represented. Several limitations must be recognised. Survival bias among the
retrospectively-enrolled hospitalised participants may have caused an underestimation of time to
complete recovery in those with severe/critical disease, although results were comparable when
restricting our analyses to prospectively identified participants. Questionnaires in languages other
than Dutch and English were not offered, therefore individuals with a migration background, who have
been disproportionally affected by COVID-19, also in Amsterdam[25, 26], were underrepresented in
this cohort. Furthermore, misclassification bias may have resulted from using ICU admission as a
proxy for critical disease; suitability for ICU admission is also judged by the patient’s chance of
survival; indeed, those with critical disease tended to be younger and have a lower BMI than those in
the severe group. Finally, the natural progression of disease may differ between SARS-CoV-2
variants[27] and treatments received. Therefore, our results may not be representative for future
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, especially as the treatment landscape for COVID-19 changes
and new variants continue to arise.

We demonstrated that post-COVID syndrome is common, even after mild disease. Symptoms
persisted for nine months after illness onset in one-fifth of participants with mild disease and in more
than half of participants with moderate and severe/critical disease. Obesity was the most important
predictor of slow recovery and thus creating an environment which facilitates healthy living behaviours
is of utmost importance, even during a pandemic. Next steps in post-COVID syndrome research must
include assessing the public health and socioeconomic impact, identifying further predictive and

Severe and critical groups combined due to low numbers of prospectively-enrolled critical patients (n=1). Groups compared using the Pearson χ 2 test (or Fisher exact test if n<5). Illness
onset defined as date of diagnosis for asymptomatic participants, who contributed to the denominator of the incidence proportion. No loss to follow-up occurred between day 1 and day 7
after illness onset. Loss to follow-up between day 7 and 28 after illness onset was minimal: n=3 in mild group, n=3 in moderate group, n=1 in severe group.

Figure 1a-e. Transition between levels of self-reported presence and severity of fatigue, cough,
loss of smell and/or taste, myalgia and dyspnoea over time among prospectively-included
participants
Median time from illness onset to recruitment was 8 days (IQR=5-12), therefore visit days in transition plots
approximately correspond to day 8, day 15 and day 36 since illness onset. Vertical bars represent the number
of participants per severity level of the symptom at each day of follow-up. Severity level was defined as the
maximum severity experienced by the study participant since the last study visit, i.e. the severity level reported
at day 7 of follow-up represents the maximum severity experienced between recruitment and day 7 of followup. The size of the streams encodes the number of study participants who transitioned from one severity level
to another; transitioning from any severity level to “none” represents recovery from that symptom.

†mMRC Score: Grade 0 = breathlessness only on strenuous exercise; Grade 1 = shortness of breath when hurrying on the
level or walking up a slight hill; Grade 2 = walks slower than people of same age on the level because of breathlessness or
has to stop to catch breath when walking at their own pace on the level; Grade 3 = stops for breath after walking ∼100 m or
after few minutes on the level; and Grade 4 = too breathless to leave the house, or breathless when dressing or undressing.

Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier plot of time from illness onset to complete recovery from symptoms,
by clinical severity group

Clinical severity groups of severe and critically severe COVID-19 combined due to small numbers in the critical severity
group. Dashed red line denotes cut-off point of 12 weeks (as per NICE definition of post-COVID syndrome); black vertical
lines indicate time-points at which participants were censored.
