A semi-empirical model, based on the logistic map approach, was developed and applied
to forecast the different phases of the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic. This model
can be used to make predictions of the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in different
spatial scales: from a world scale to a country or even a smaller scale. Predictions on persons
hospitalized, number of ventilators needed at ICUs and potential numbers of deaths were
successfully carried out in different countries using this approach. This paper shows the
mathematical basis for the model together with a proposal for its calibration on the different
phases of the epidemic.
Specific results are shown for the COVID-19 epidemic in Spain. For predicting the evolution of the epidemic four phases were considered: non-controlled evolution since the 20th of
February; total lock-down from the 15th of March; partial easing of the lock-down from the
13th of April; and a phased lock-down easing from the 1st of May.
In a first phase, if no control is established, the model predicted in Spain 12 millions of
infected people of a total of 46.6 millions inhabitants. From those infected nearly 1 million
people would need intensive care and around 700,000 deaths would be directly produced by
the disease. However, as these numbers would occur in a brief period (few months), the
number of deaths would have been higher due to the saturation of the health system.

For a second phase, considering a total lock-down of the whole country from the 15th of
March, the model predicted for the 17th of April 194,000 symptomatic infected cases, 85,700
hospitalized, nearly 8,600 patients with needs of an ICU and 19,500 deaths. The model also
predicted the peak to be produced between the 29th of March and the 3rd of April. Although
the data are still under revision, the accuracy in all the predictions was very good, as the
reported values by that day were 197,142 infected, 7,548 inpatients needing an ICU and
20,043 deaths. The peak was produced between the 31st of May and the 2nd of April.
For the third phase, the ease of the lock-down which began the 13th of April, early
predictions were made by the beginning of April [Mora et al., 2020]. Assuming conservatively
an infection daily rate of a 3% (r = 1.03) the model predicted 400,000 infections and 46, 000±
15, 000 deaths by the end of May. The predictions overestimated the real values, due to a
stricter reduction of the infection daily rate which lead to values of r < 1% and a revision
of the whole series of data by the health authorities carried out along the month of May.
A new prediction performed with updated parameters at the beginning of May provided a
prediction of 250,000 infected and 29, 000 ± 15, 000 deaths. The reported values by the end
of May were 282,870 infected and 28,552 deaths.
After the total easing of the lock-down many uncertainties appear, but the model predicts
that the health system would not saturate if the daily rate of infections r is kept below 1.02
(2% of daily increase in the number of symptomatic infected).
This simple model provides a system to predict the evolution of epidemics with a good
accuracy, even during epidemics development, where other systems have difficulties in their
calibration. As the parameters involved in the model are based in empirical values of the
different quantities (e.g. number of inpatients or deaths, related with the number of infected
persons) it can be dynamically adjusted and adapted to sudden changes in the statistics.
As other models, the results provided by this model can be used by the authorities to
support decision making in order to optimize resources and to minimize the consequences of
epidemics, including the future outbreaks of the COVID-19 which will occur.

A new respiratory disease, initially dominated by pneumonia, and caused by a coronavirus,
was detected at the province of Hubei, in China, at the end of 2019. It was initially named
by the World Health Organization (WHO) as 2019-nCoV [Zhu et al., 2020] and renamed in
February 2020 by the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), recognizing it as a sister of the SARS-CoV
viruses [Gorbalenya et al., 2020a, Gorbalenya et al., 2020b]. The same day the WHO [World
Health Organization, 2020] named the disease as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Many efforts have been made since then to mathematically model the spread of the disease
in the whole world and in the different countries where the infection arrived. Modelling the
epidemics has many practical uses: preparation of national health systems; make provisions
of the necessary sanitary material; predict whether and when a saturation of the health system could occur; when and to what extent Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) [Feng
et al., 2010] should be applied; predict the day when those countermeasures can be relaxed,
etc. These theoretical approaches to predict the evolution of epidemics often use compartment models as simple as the SIR model (Susceptible, Infectious and Recovered – sometimes
called Removed) [Kermack et al., 1927], but this model can be increased in complexity to
include different characteristics of an infectious epidemics. For example the model can include individuals who can infect others, without presenting symptoms, what is known as the
SEIR model (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed); the model can also assume that
people who have recovered from the disease lose the immunity after a given time, and therefore they could be infected again, giving rise to the SEIRS models (Susceptible, Exposed,
Infected, Removed and Susceptible); also the deaths and births can be included for long
term epidemics, as is the case in the influenza; and many times compartments to distinguish
deaths, recovered, hospitalized, and other situations, are included by using empirical ratios
(see for instance [Brauer, 2008, Munz et al., 2009] for further information).
Since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak many efforts have been carried out to adapt these SIR type
compartment models to the behaviour of this particular virus. For example, a conceptual
representation of a compartment model for COVID-19 disease’s spread, developed by the
authors of this paper, is shown in figure 1, where immunization of recovered is assumed to be
lost after a given period of time, as happen in other infectious diseases (typically immunity
is lost after less than 12 months in the case of the coronavirus causing common cold). Due to
the difficulty of developing and calibrating these models at the early stages of an epidemics,
wrong conclusions are often reached, for instance predicting the timing of the epidemic, and
many times the uncertainties associated with the results of the models are so wide that are not
well accepted by the public. Sometimes the authors of such predictions blamed the quality of
the statistical data [Caudill, 2020,Roda et al., 2020]. However, this quality is severely affected
by the urgency of the epidemic and could not probably be avoided in this or future outbreaks
of epidemics. The continuous publications of medical and epidemiological studies on the
COVID-19, and the associated virus, don’t make it easy to extract good quality information
to adapt the models. But it must be accepted that this situation will be always the case – or
even worst - when new diseases appear.
One clear example of problems associated with future predictions of the COVID-19 behaviour
is the uncertainty about the influence of ambient temperature or humidity, which would
influence the seasonality of the disease [Wang et al., 2020]. In the early stages many aspects
of the behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were associated with previous studies on similar
viruses as the SARS virus, as could be the resilience in fomites (Kampf et al., 2020) or the
immunization of patients recovered from it [Prompetchara et al., 2020]. While writing this

paper many aspects are still under investigation, but in this respect it is believed that, as
happens with other human coronaviruses causing diseases, like the 15% of the common cold
cases [Pelczar JR. et al., 2010], immunity will remain for a brief period, of the order of months.
During the outbreak of the epidemic in Spain several models were tested and a follow-up of
the published results were performed to support Spanish national authorities in the decisionmaking process [Mora, 2020], producing a preliminary work covering all the phases which
was published as a preprint [Mora et al., 2020]. The best results were obtained by using a
semi-empirical approach presented herein, which has the advantage of performing accurate
predictions with the minimum amount of information available during this epidemic which,
very likely, will be the situation in future outbreaks.
This paper presents the mathematical development for a proposed semi-empirical model and
the results obtained using it, focusing the results into the Spanish case. Some results obtained
for other countries are also presented.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The semi-empirical model presented in this paper, with a proper calibration, produces accurate results at every stage of the epidemic: during the first spread of the disease, after the
application of NPI (specifically total lock-down) which were applied in many countries, and
after the ease of the lock-down.
Although the instant reproduction number (Rt) used by the epidemiologists for estimating
the severity of an epidemic is not used in this model, the basic reproduction number (R0) was
derived for 10 different countries, ranging from 2.0 to 9.3, which is in a good agreement with
previous estimations [Liu et al., 2020]. The R0 derived from real data are found in table 1,
giving an average of 5.8 ± 2.4, a value almost doubling early estimations [Velavan and Meyer,
2020].

The model proposed in this paper applies the well-known logistic map, often used for describing the growth of populations and mentioned as an example of chaotic behaviour. This
chaotic behaviour depends on a single parameter r (figure 2 shows a fractal created with the
logistic map as a function of r). In this equation values of r < 1 would make an epidemic to
extinguish. Any r greater than 1 but below 3 will provide an equilibrium in the size of the
population for the long term, while values of r higher than 3.56995 would produce a chaotic
behaviour on the size of the population.

Therefore to determine the number of infected diagnosed cases equation 1 is used:

Where I(t) is the number of infected diagnosed cases at day t, I(t − 1) the infected diagnosed
cases of the precedent day t-1, r is the growth parameter of the logistic map (named hereafter
daily infection rate), and N the number of individuals susceptible to be infected (in figure
2 a simplified example of this function, with constant parameters, is shown). It should be
noted that the number of susceptible individuals used here is not necessarily the same as the
number used for modellers applying SIR type models. The sub-index n will be used below to
indicate the n-th day after the outbreak.
The behaviour of this function gives rise to the logistic function and the typical sigmoid shape
of its cumulative distribution if r < 2, while it shows a chaotic behaviour if r > 3.56995 (see
figure 3). Other authors have studied the behaviour of this logistic function applied to the
COVID-19 epidemics [Fokas et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020].
In order to compare with the values of the basic reproduction number in table 2 the empirically
determined values of the growth parameter r are shown for the same countries in table 1.
This r parameter is simply measured by dividing the new infected in a given day by the
infected in the previous day. To avoid statistics biases r was taken for each country as an
average for the first 7 days after the initial detections of infected at each country. The r in
these countries was equal to 1.9 ± 0.5, ranging from 1.3 to 3.0. In this approach a value of
r < 3 implies that, in absence of countermeasures, and independently of the initial value I(0)
there would be reached an unique equilibrium on the number of infected: I(∞) = N · r−1
r .
Worldwide, in average, an equilibrium value of 3.65 billions of infected would be reached
applying r = 1.9 and N = 7.7 · 109 to the equation. The equilibrium values which would be

reached, if no intervention was applied for each country, are shown at the table 2.
Therefore the basic quantity used to make predictions is the number of infected I(t) reported
by each country or region. This model does not need considering asymptomatic infected or
questions what is the real number of infected, but makes use of the data reported. However,
as demonstrated in the case of the ”Diamond Princess" cruise, nearly the 70% of the infected
would be asymptomatic and undiagnosed [Emery et al., 2020].
Other quantities needed to provide advice to the authorities are the number of inpatients
who would need medical attention at the hospital (Hn ), the number of those who would need
intensive care (Cn ) and the number of deaths (Dn ), all of them at each time t. Hn and Dn are
calculated as a fraction of the number of the diagnosed infected cases at time t (In ), and Cn
as fraction of Hn . Obviously the number of recovered patients (Rn ) is given by the fraction
(1 − Dn ). The fraction used to calculate Dn in this way is referred to as the case fatality
n
rate (CFR), determined as CF R = DnD+R
. This is proved to be more practical during the
n
outbreak than other approaches as the mortality rate for the whole population which can be

A delay must be included to represent the time elapsed between a death and its report to the
authorities, including the time needed to perform the diagnoses (usually by using polymerase
chain reaction - PCR - technique).

178

All of these numbers are crucial to policy makers in order to take well founded decisions.
However, to perform reliable predictions an appropriate calibration of the model is needed
which will depend on the specific situation of each phase of the epidemics.

All the parameters of the model are empirically calibrated by averaging the available information in a studied region. This calibration is feasible at the early stages, when the data
available cover only few days, but it can also be dynamically adjusted during the whole
evolution of the epidemics. For performing reliable predictions at the very beginning of the
outbreak, the information from previously infected countries can be used as initial calibration
of the model.
SARS-CoV-2 is assumed to infect with the same probability to every human, disregarding
sex or age. Being a new human virus, no immunization was previously acquired, by natural
or artificial (vaccine) means. For that reason the number of people which can be infected,
N , was initially assumed to be the whole population of the studied region, whatever the size
of that region is. For the sake of simplicity the total population of a country (or a region,

as are the so-called autonomous communities in Spain) is initially used. In the case of Spain
the total population N = 46.6 · 106 was initially used.
The daily infection rate, r, can be dynamically determined - using all the data collected to
average a given period - dividing the number of infected the day n+1 (In+1 ) by the number
of infected at day n (In ). For Spain, averaging the daily infection rate during the first 7 days
of the outbreak, from the 26th of February to the 3rd of March, an r = 1.5 was obtained.
Following the same method r values were obtained for 10 countries (see table 2). This
parameter however with the actions taken by the governments and the population, as the
social distancing, the frequent hands washing or the use of masks.
The fraction of the infected who need to be hospitalized (H = HInn ) is dynamically determined
using the data acquired at each region (or state, or country), averaged for the whole period
since the beginning of the epidemic. The same was done for the fraction of inpatients needing
Cn
an ICU (C = Hn
). An initial factor of patients needing an ICU from the number of infected
cases H · C = 0.05 to 0.15 was computed from the studies in Eastern countries.

As the reported data for the infected patients were given as accumulated since the beginning
of the epidemic, all the other quantities were also obtained as cumulative functions. Due to
its special configuration of the health system, this was a problem in Spain, as different regions
decided to report different quantities and then initially was impossible to obtain accumulated
data for hospitalized persons, or patients which needed an ICU for the country. Daily rates

were interesting to calculate, for instance, the day where the maximum of infections or deaths
(peak of the curve) would occur.

For the CFR, the value measured near the equilibrium in China was used (CF R = 0.0578,
as measured the 4th of March - see figure 4 to see the evolution of the CFR in China 1 .).
This parameter presented a similar behaviour in many other countries, reaching a value at
equilibrium of nearly a 5%. The high CFR values observed at the beginning of the epidemics
in every country are probably due to several joint factors, including the weakness of the more
vulnerable population (very old, already sick, people), or the lack of knowledge on which
medical treatments were more effective. Those factors improved with time. In the cases of
European countries a similar evolution was observed, although the decrease was slower than
happened in China (at the beginning of April 2020 the CFR for USA was 0.3998, for Italy
was 0.3557, and for Spain was 0.2052). The time delay, from the diagnose of an infected
patient to the possible death, was adjusted at each country using real data. In the initial
stages the observed delay was of 5 to 10 days for all the countries and reduced after some
days.

A non pharmaceutical intervention used in China and many other countries, included Spain,
was the so called ’lock-down’ in which the population is required to stay at home and only
leave if essential. This NPI has been partially implemented in some regions and totally in
others, including the region of Hubei in China (58.5 million inhabitants), Spain (46.6 million
inhabitants) or Italy (60.4 million inhabitants).

In each region or country the initial value used for N was its total population, but after
the lock-down, the number of people already infected, or in contact with infectious people,
is fixed and therefore N would be smaller. This number cannot be determined before the
lock-down but can be calculated the same day that the lock-down is implemented by using
the number of infected measured at that exact time. A first estimation was made using the
number of infected, estimated with the model, 14 days after beginning the lock-down (14 days
was assumed to be the incubation period for the COVID-19) and multiplying that number
by a factor of 10, which would provide the total infected. This method provides a rough
estimation which needs further refinements when new data are obtained, however it provided
valid estimations for forecasting the time when the maximum (peak) for daily new cases of
diagnosed cases or deaths would be expected.

As expected, the daily infection rate r was observed to decrease, from the rate the day before
the NPI was applied (typically around 1.3) to a number slightly higher than 1.0, as observed
at South Korea. The same behaviour was observed in every country and at every scale. After

determined at the location. Table 3 shows some values for A and α adjusted for different
countries after a lock-down was implemented and examples of smaller scale regions within
Spain (Andalusia and Catalonia were chosen for this example because they are the two more
populated regions in Spain). Those values were obtained by fitting the equation 2 to the
experimental data in different regions or countries. (*Experimental data from worldometer

The number of individuals infected before the lock-down (N ), and the constants A and α
cannot be determined prior to the lock-down, as different groups of individuals or societies
behave differently under the same exact government instructions, and also different governments provided slightly different instructions. So the only chance to obtain good predictions
after the lock-down is to wait for several days to obtain experimental data to be used to fit
the curve under the equation 2 . It should be also pointed out that, some sources of information provided data shifted in time or simply just different and consequently the fitting could
provide different values for the parameters.

The parameters H and C were determined by averaging the empirical values from the studied
region. In Spain the values obtained as an average up to the 6th of April were H = 0.467 and
C = 0.1497, which indicates that a high rate of diagnosed infected needed to be hospitalized,
or more likely, that only severe cases were diagnosed at the hospitals, needing half of them
to be admitted. Also a high percentage of the inpatients (almost a 15%) needed intensive

care using ventilators, which was in agreement with the observed pattern in China and other
countries. In this case H ·C = 0.07 (7%) which was in a good agreement with the initial range
observed for the inpatients needing an ICU. As all parameters were dynamically calculated
every day, the predictions were slightly calibrated daily.

276

Also for the CFR empirical values were used, as the equilibrium value taken from China was
well surpassed in the initial stages in many European countries, although it tended to the
same equilibrium value (nearly 5%). Although initially it reached values of even a 50%, the
experimental CFR in Spain, as in UK, Belgium, or Italy, was 0.12 (12%) by April. The delay
applied from reporting the positive diagnose of a patient to the death (when produced) was
reduced to 3 days.

When a region or a country decides to relax the confinement, the parameters need a new
calibration to take into account the situation.
When the lock-down is completely abandoned N would return to be again the whole population of the region or country. However, this was not the situation in every country.
For example, in Spain the lock-down was established the 15th of March. Although the ideal
situation would be to maintain the total lock-down until r reached a value close to 1, value
expected to happen by the end of April according with the model, the 13th of April some
relaxation was adopted, allowing most of the workers to return to their normal activities.
A large part of the population remained confined, but a graded approach was established
to remove it before the end of May. This being the situation, the parameters can be only
inferred after some data are collected, following the same methodology established during
the lock-down. Therefore r should be fitted to an exponential decrease, following the same
equation 2 after obtaining enough data. To perform initial conservative estimations a value
of r = 1.03 can be used.
r = 1.01 + B · e−β·t

In the final stages of the easing of the lock-down, equation 3 was used for r, considering
impossible to achieve a value r < 1.01 (as the experience in other countries showed that
reducing the level of daily infections below that value was, at least, very difficult). AB and
β are again constants empirically determined at the location
The rest of parameters: H, C or the CFR remain being averaged along the whole period
with real data.
This parametrization can be used to assess the evolution of the situation after easing the lockdown or to design the strategy to optimize the number of infected, hospitalized or inpatients
needing an ICU, to avoid the saturation of the health system of a country.

RESULTS

302

As pointed out, 3 phases were considered:

303

1.- An initial phase of the outbreak where no severe restrictions were applied.

304

2.- A second phase where severe non pharmaceutical interventions (confinement) were applied.

305
306

3.- A last phase where relaxation of the more severe NPI is assumed, although some keep
being used.

309

As an example the application of the model with the appropriate parametrization in Spain is
presented to show the performance of the model. The same methodology was also used for
some of the regions in Spain, and can be used to any other region or country of any size.

reported data (in red) are shown against modelled values (in green). The schools closing was
established from the 11th of March and the total lock-down the 15th of March.
As explained, during this initial stage, r = 1.05 was calculated as an average of the values
measured during the initial days of spread of the epidemics; N was the total population in

Spain (46.6 · 106 inhabitants); and the CF R = 0.0578 was taken from the Chinese experience.
In this phase the only parameter dynamically calibrated, to adjust the data reported daily,
was the delay from the number of infected to the number of deaths, as was explained before,
from an initial value of 7 days that was reduced up to a 2 days delay applied the 5th of March.
In this specific case, the forecast indicated a number of infected cases of 26, 600 ± 500 and
a number of deaths of 1, 230 ± 150 to occur 6 days later (11th of March). The real number
of reported infected was 21,571 (19% difference), and the number of reported deaths was
of 1,093 (11% difference). The number of inpatients needing an ICU and a ventilator was
calculated as I(t) · H(t) · C(t), providing a range of [1,330 - 3,990]. The reported number
of inpatients which needed an ICU the 20th of March was of 1,630 (within the calculated
range). Although in this initial stage many factors altered the real numbers the accuracy was
reasonably good.
Predictions of the likely number of infected, hospitalized inpatients and total deaths were
carried out using these conditions for the initial phase (uncontrolled spread of the disease).
The model predicted that, if a severe NPI (total lock-down) was not adopted, but on the
contrary the virus was left to spread without control, at the end of the epidemic in Spain 12
million people would have been infected, of which nearly 1 million people would need intensive
care and about 700,000 infected would die directly because of the COVID-19 disease. However
the number of deaths would likely be higher due to the saturation of the health system, as
these numbers would occur in a very short period.

341

These results could provide an early idea of the urgent necessity of applying extreme NPIs
like the total lock-down, they could be also used to predict the consequences of not applying
the severe NPIs, and also to prepare for the capabilities of the ICUs, including the number
of ventilators.

In Spain closing of schools began on 11th of March and lock-down was established the 15th
of March. All factors were re-calibrated for this second phase as stated, including a fitting
of the daily infection rate to the curve given in equation 2. For the number of susceptible
individuals N an initial estimation (N = 1.1 · 106 ) was carried out using the results of the
model 14 days after the lock-down. An average value r = 1.32 was used. Results of these
early predictions are presented in figure 6. These values were later calibrated dynamically to
r = 1.20 and N ' 9 · 106 using data up to the 15th of March. Results of the predictions are
presented in figure 7.
The application of the total lock-down to the model reduced the predictions carried out the
26th of March to a total of 194,000 infected, 85,700 hospitalized, nearly 8,600 with needs of
an ICU and 19, 500 ± 1, 400 deaths to occur by the 17th of April. The real numbers reported
at that date were 197,142 infected (1.6% difference), 7,548 inpatients needing an ICU (12%

difference) and 20,043 deaths (2.7 % difference). The model predicted the peak for the rate
of daily deaths to occur between the 29th of March and the 3th of April. In reality the peak,
after the administration revised the data (two months later), occurred the 31st of March.

The last phase is the ease of the lock-down. In this case, predictions based on some hypothesis,
carried out during April, are presented in this paper and compared with the real evolution.
Again the case of Spain is presented as example. Using the models presented in this paper
recommendations were provided to ease the lock-down around 21st of April [Mora, 2020]. In
reality a partial unlock was decreed the 13th of April for non-essential workers, and a phased
total unlocking from the 30th of April, where some activities were allowed gradually each week
until the 21st of June, where normal activity was restored, although the population should
follow NPI health countermeasures, as social distance, use of masks, washing of hands, etc.

368

After the unlocking many uncertainties appear, but the results of the model depend largely
on the daily rate of infections r.

In order to obtain conservative figures an initial forecast was carried out with the data
available the 16th of April [Mora et al., 2020]. At that point only some reasonable hypotheses
could be applied to calibrate N and r.
For N it was assumed that about a 20% of the total workforce (in Spain 20 million workers on
2020) went back to work, as only some industries were allowed to begin again their activities,
after that day. As those people could also infect their families, 2 further members on average,
an initial N = 1.2 · 107 was taken. In order to carry out conservative predictions r = 1.03 (a
daily increase of the infected of a 3%) was taken. Results in figure 8 were obtained for those
conservative assumptions.
Using these conservative values of N and r, some consequences in the partial ease of the lockdown could be extracted. First of all, the number of diagnosed infected people would increase
continuously beyond May. In fact there would been a peak in the daily rate of infected by
the 28th of May and a peak in the daily rate of deaths by the 1st of June. The total number
of deaths in Spain by the end of April would reach the 46,000 ± 15,000 under this scenario.
That was the conservative value we published in April [Mora et al., 2020]. If this would have
been the case (r > 1.03) a saturation of the health system would have occurred again in
Spain. So that value of r could be regarded as an upper bound which should be avoided.

From the 4th of May a total unlock was applied in Spain, with a progressive increase in the
mobility of the people since then, and therefore a recalibration was needed. For this phase
N was again considered the total population (46.6 millions inhabitants).
Obtaining some more data a least squares fit was performed using an initial daily infection
rate r = 1.02 (2% daily increase of infected) the day before the unlocking, and the equation
3 to fit r. The calibration resulted in B = 0.03 and β = 0.153, what gives the equation
r = 1.01 + 0.03 · e(−0.153·t) . The results obtained with this fit is shown in figure 9.
The series of data finishes at the end of May, as official aggregated data for Spain were no
longer provided. In fact least squares fit was extremely difficult as there was an attempt
to homogenize the data between the different regions in the country which made the whole
series of data to be revised almost every day. That is one of the reasons why in this occasion
the fitting was not as good as in previous phases for the total number of infected and the
total number of deaths, as the focus was put in the daily number of deaths to obtain a good
fitting. Daily number of deaths was the main endpoint in this phase because this indicator
is the best one to perform future surveys of the situation of the epidemic.
The results obtained using this calibration for this final stage was that the number of diagnosed infected people would slowly increase continuously beyond May. This is a logical
result, as the infection would be always present in a slow rate until the virus is eradicated
or there is a vaccine to control the spread of the disease. The predicted number of total
infected is of 317, 500 ± 1, 700 and the total number of deaths would be 37, 100, with a huge
uncertainty, by the 1st of August. The real numbers that day were 335,602 reported infected
(5.7% difference) and 28,445 deaths (23% difference).
During the summer the situation was controlled, however if the good practices in the application of NPIs are abandoned: hands washing, social distance, use of masks, etc., r could easily
reach values above 1.03, surely another increase in the number of infected will occur. This will
be the case also when borders are reopened and new infectious people (even asymptomatic)
enter inadvertently from countries in the initial phase of the epidemics.
Of course, these predictions did not consider important changes, as the discovery of a vaccine which seems extremely difficult in a short period of time - , or the increase in the temperatures
in the summer which could reduce the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2, or a higher isolation
which could reduce the severity of the COVID-19 due to a higher production of vitamin D [Ilie
et al., 2020, Panagiotou et al., 2020], or any other unforeseen circumstance. During that
summer time, of course, the treatment of hospitalized patients has improved and therefore a
smaller fraction of inpatients need an ICU or even die.

Percentage of infected population in the regions
There was an additional result extracted from this model. The need to recalibrate it during
the locking phase by fitting the parameter N , the number of people susceptible to be infected
in that phase, offers the possibility of using that number to infer the percentage of the
population in a country or region which could have been infected, for this particular virus,
most of them showing no symptoms.
As an example these numbers were extracted for the autonomous communities (administrative
regions) in Spain and transformed to three levels of infection (low – below 5% -, medium –
from 5% to 10% and high – above 10%), giving rise to the result shown in figure 10a.
This qualitative result has an important use for the authorities, as the population which
have a high level of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 did probably developed immunity against
the virus (at least temporarily as discussed before), and therefore there is no chance for
them to be infected again in the close future. And on the contrary, there is a bigger chance
of developing further outbreaks of the disease in those regions where the percentage of the
infected population was smaller.
The model provided some counter-intuitive results. For example, the capital of Spain, Madrid,
presented ”medium level” of infection of the population, whereas Catalonia showed ”high
level”, while both, the number of diagnosed cases and the number of deaths in Madrid was
higher, and this would imply a higher level of infection in Madrid. However this could be
explained in the different criteria followed by the different regions for reporting the numbers.
For example Catalonia decided by mid of May to include in the statistics the deaths of people
occurred out of the hospitals, while it was unknown if Madrid was including those deaths
already in the statistics. The same occurs with the number of diagnosed infected cases, as
there is observed an increase in the number of tests performed on people who finally did
not need a hospital in Madrid, the percentage in Catalonia of diagnosed population finally
needing a hospital was still around 65% by May.
These predictions were compared against the extensive statistical program of immunity prevalence carried out on the Spanish population from April to June 2020, published at early
July [ISCIII, 2020] (see figure 10b). This study measured the percentage of people infected
during the epidemic, taking account of asymptomatic infected persons, while the previous reported numbers included just the hospitalized inpatients showing severe symptoms on which
a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test returned a positive result. The results of both studies
can be compared in figure 10.
As can be seen the results provided by the model in April were accurate in most of the
regions were low infection occurred, as in the south (Andalucia, Extremadura, Ceuta, Melilla,
Canary Islands, Balears Islands, Valencia and Murcia) or north-west (Galicia, Asturias and
Cantabria) of Spain. However the model predicted a medium to high infection level at the
whole north and north-east, whereas the measured levels of seroprevalence obtained low levels

As it is unlikely that a vaccine to the SARS-CoV-2 or a cure of the associated disease COVID19 is developed in the next few months, the only way of reducing the consequences of the
epidemic at this moment is an optimum application of the available NPIs.
A methodology based on the application of the logistic map in different phases of the COVID19 epidemic was shown and applied to the different phases to Spain. This methodology
provided good results in the forecast of the evolution of the disease in every country and
situation where it was applied.
The use of extreme non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as the total lock-down, showed
their effectiveness during the period they were applied. However, easing the countermeasures
allow new outbreaks of the infection to appear. This situation forces the need of applying
many simultaneous techniques to reduce the effect of the disease if that is the case. One
of those techniques could be the application of the methodology described in this paper to
provide early alerts of the outbreaks in countries or smaller units of population, allowing an
optimization of sanitary resources and reducing the economic and social impact of future
NPIs applied locally.

As was shown, reasonably accurate results can be produced by using the model presented
in this paper to the different phases of an epidemic. In a previous preprint, assuming an
infection daily rate r of 3%, a total number of 400 000 diagnosed infected and a total number
of 46 000 ± 15 000 deaths were forecasted in Spain by the end of May [Mora et al., 2020].
Those predictions overestimated the real values due to a more strict reduction of the infection
daily rate in the country, reaching values below 1%.
The forecasts covered from the number of infected, hospitalized, inpatients needing an ICU
or deaths, to the time where the peak of daily deaths would be produced or the level of
infection in a given region. In the last prediction, carried out for the beginning of August,
317,500 ± 1,700 infected and a total number of deaths of 37,100 were predicted, with a
huge uncertainty, to be compared with the real numbers of 335,602 reported infected (5.7%
difference) and 28,445 deaths (23% difference).
The aim of any policy dealing with the application and withdrawal of NPI should carefully
consider daily infection rates. In the case of the COVID-19 a daily infection rate r lying within
the range of 1.01 to 1.02 (1% to 2% daily increase), as was shown in countries like South
Korea, would produce a manageable level of people needing an ICU in hospitals, avoiding the
saturation of national healthcare systems and therefore unnecessary deaths.
Also a qualitative prediction of the percentage of the population infected in the different regions of Spain was performed by using the suggested semi-empirical model. These predictions
were compared against the extensive statistical program of immunity prevalence carried out
on the Spanish population from April to June 2020, published at early July, showing that the
model provided in April reasonable results in most of the regions, although the model predicted a medium to high infection level at the whole north and north-east, while the measured
levels of seroprevalence obtained low levels. Some results obtained with this methodology were
not intuitive according to the official information. The more counter-intuitive result probably
being the higher level of infection of Catalonia compared with Madrid region. As said, in
general the forecast provided a good forecast of the infection level.
The COVID-19 epidemic is still ongoing and the knowledge will increase with time. In the
next future new outbreaks are foreseen in the countries where the first one was controlled,
unless a vaccine or a cure are developed in the next future. Therefore models will be needed
to forecast again the evolution and to advice the authorities in the needs of the country’s
health system. Some characteristics of the virus, needed to perform better predictions, are
still unknown, as the lost of immunity of cured individuals or the influence of vitamin D in
the severity of the disease.
A continuous watch of the disease is still needed to provide proper advice which can be used
by policy makers.
