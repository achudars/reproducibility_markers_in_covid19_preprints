Abstract
Background Patients with chronic renal insufficiency on intermittent hemodialysis face an increased
risk of COVID-19 induced mortality and impaired vaccine responses. To date, only few studies
addressed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicited immunity in this immunocompromised population.
Methods We assessed immunogenicity of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 in at risk dialysis patients and
characterized systemic cellular and humoral immune responses in serum and saliva using interferon γ
release assay and multiplex-based cytokine and immunoglobulin measurements. We further compared
binding capacity and neutralization efficacy of vaccination-induced immunoglobulins against emerging
SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.429 and Cluster 5 by ACE2-RBD competition
assay.
Findings Patients on intermittent hemodialysis exhibit detectable but variable cellular and humoral
immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern after a two-dose regimen of
BNT162b2. Although vaccination-induced immunoglobulins were detectable in saliva and plasma, both
anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralization efficacy was reduced compared to controls. Similarly, T-cell
mediated interferon γ release after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides was significantly
diminished.
Interpretation Quantifiable humoral and cellular immune responses after BNT162b2 vaccination in
individuals on intermittent dialysis are encouraging, but urge for longitudinal follow-up to assess
longevity of immunity. Diminished virus neutralization and interferon γ responses in face of emerging
variants of concern may favor this at risk population for re-vaccination using modified vaccines at the
earliest opportunity.

Research in the context
Evidence before this study: Patients on dialysis tend to have a reduced immune response to both infection
and vaccination. We searched PubMed and MedRxiv for studies including search terms such as
“COVID-19“, “vaccine”, and “dialysis” but no peer-reviewed studies to date assessed both SARS-CoV2 specific B- and T-cell responses, mucosal immunoglobulins, and considered the impact of SARSCoV-2 variants of concern in this at risk population.
Added value of the study: We provide a comprehensive functional characterization of both T- and Bcell responses following a two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 in at risk patients on maintenance
hemodialysis. More importantly, to the best of our knowledge, we assess for the first time binding and
neutralization capacity of vaccination-induced circulation and mucosal antibodies towards emerging
SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in an immunocompromised population.
Implications of all the available evidence: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis develop a substantial
cellular and humoral immune response following the BNT162b2 vaccine. These findings should
encourage patients on intermittent hemodialysis to receive the vaccine. However, we suggest continuing
additional protection measures against variants of concern in this at risk population until longevity of
the vaccine response is fully evaluated.
1. Introduction
Since its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has become a global pandemic with more than 166
million confirmed cases and 3·46 million deaths (as of 24.05.21) (1). Vulnerable populations such as
the elderly, immunocompromised or those suffering from chronic conditions or requiring continual
medical intervention such as dialysis are at risk of severe COVID-19 disease and associated death (2).

Although a series of vaccines have been developed, tested and approved at unprecedented speed, only
one vaccine study for NVX CoV2373 has enrolled patients with chronic diseases such as chronic kidney
disease to assess efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination within this vulnerable population (3).
Patients on maintenance dialysis are a particularly high-risk group, as renal disease has been identified
as a key risk factor for severe COVID-19 (4-7), while at the same time their regular need for therapy
does not allow them to self-isolate and reduce contacts to avoid infection. A recent study also suggested
that seroreversion following natural SARS-CoV-2 infection is faster in dialysis patients compared to the
general population further increasing the risk of re-infection (8). Other studies have also identified that
vaccine efficacy is reduced in dialysis patients, as seen by the attenuation of antibody titers following
vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (9-14). Additional data on the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2
vaccination is urgently needed not only for risk mitigation but also to assess whether additional
protective measures during therapy must be put in place as seen by the impaired infection and
vaccination-induced responses for influenza A and hepatitis B (15-17). While antibody titers have
already been characterized within vaccinated dialysis patients, little is known about their neutralization
potential, particularly in light of the increasingly appearing SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC)
which threaten the success of vaccination programs (18).
To assess efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in dialysis patients, we characterized cellular and
humoral immune responses in serum and saliva of dialyzed and non-dialyzed individuals after
vaccination with the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2. Considering the increasing presence of mutated SARSCoV-2 strains, we further compared binding capacity and neutralization efficacy of vaccination-induced
immunoglobulins against emerging variants of concern (VoC) such as B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.429 and
Cluster 5.
2. Methods
2.1 Study design and sample collection
Following written informed consent, heparinized blood samples from hemodialysis patients were taken
before start of dialysis using the vascular access which was either an arterio-venous fistula or a central
venous catheter or by venipuncture from health care workers (control). Details about the study
population are listed in Table 1, Table S2 and S3. One hemodialysis patient was previously tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 by routine PCR screening. As subsequent antibody testing was negative for
SARS-CoV-2 IgG, this patient received BNT162b2 and was not excluded from our study. The standard
two-dose regimen of Pfizer was given 21 days apart, followed by blood collection for analysis 21 days
after the second dose. Plasma was obtained from lithium heparin blood (S-Monovette, Sarstedt,
Germany) and stored at -80°C until use. Whole blood samples were used immediately for interferon 
release assay (IGRA). For saliva collection, all individuals spat directly into a collection tube. To
inactive saliva samples, Tri(n-butyl) phosphate (TnBP) and Triton X-100 were added to final
concentrations of 0·3% and 1%, respectively (19). Saliva samples were then frozen at −80°C until
further use.
2.2 Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Internal Review Board of Hannover Medical School (MHH, approval
number 8973_BO-K_2020).
2.3 Bead coupling
Coupling of antigens to spectrally distinct MagPlex beads was done by EDC/s-NHS coupling for all
standard MULTICOV-AB antigens (20). RBDs from variants of concern were coupled using Anteo
coupling (#A-LMPAKMM-10, Anteo Tech Reagents, Australia) following the manufacturer’s
instructions (21).
2.4 MULTICOV-AB
Antibody titers and binding was analyzed using MULTICOV-AB, a multiplex immunoassay which
simultaneously analyses 20 antigens, as previously described (20). The full list of antigens included in

this study can be found in Table S1. Plasma samples were diluted 1:400 while saliva samples were
diluted 1:12 (21). Briefly, antigens were immobilized on spectrally distinct populations of MagPlex
beads (as above) and combined into a single bead mix. Samples were combined with the bead mix,
incubated for 2 h at 21°C and then washed using a microplate washer to remove unbound antibodies.
Bound antibodies were detected following a 45 min incubation at 21°C with R-phycoerythrin labeled
goat-anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, United Kingdom, Cat# 109-116-098, Lot#
148837, RRID: AB_2337678, used at 3 µg/mL) or IgA (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, Cat# 109-115011, Lot# 143454, RRID: AB_2337674, used at 5 µg/mL) as secondary antibodies. Following another
washing step, beads were re-suspended and then measured using a FLEXMAP3D instrument (Luminex,
Texas, US) using the following settings: Timeout 80 sec, Gate: 7500-15000, Reporter Gain: Standard
PMT, 40 events. Each sample was measured once. As a control, three quality control (QC) samples were
included on each plate. Raw median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values or normalized values (MFI/MFI
of QC samples (21)) are reported.
2.5 ACE2-RBD competition assay
To determine neutralization, an ACE2-RBD competition assay was carried out as previously described
(21) Briefly, biotinylated ACE2 was added to the assay buffer to final concentration of 500 ng/mL for
all samples. Samples were then mixed with MULTICOV-AB bead mix (see above) and incubated for 2
h at 21°C, 750 rpm. After washing, ACE2 was detected using Streptavidin-PE (2 µg/mL, #SAPE-001,
Moss, Maryland, US) by incubating the sample for 45 min at 750rpm. After an additional wash step and
resuspension, samples were measured on a FLEXMAP3D instrument (same settings as MULTICOVAB). As control, 500 ng/mL ACE2 was used. For analysis, MFI values were normalized against the
control wells. All samples were measured once.
2.6 Euroimmun ELISA QuantiVac
To further validate plasma IgG levels measured by MULTICOV-AB, samples were further analyzed
using the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-QuantiVac-ELISA IgG (Euroimmun, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Plasma samples were diluted 1:400 to achieve assay linearity.
2.7 Interferon  release assay (IGRA)
SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were determined by measuring IFN production upon SARSCoV-2 antigen stimulation using the SARS-CoV-2 Interferon Gamma Release Assay IGRA
(Euroimmun, Germany). Briefly, 0·5 mL full blood were stimulated with peptides of the SARS-CoV-2
S1 domain of the Spike protein for a period of 20-24 h. Negative and positive controls were carried out
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Following stimulation, supernatants were isolated through
centrifugation and IFNγ measured using ELISA. The remaining supernatant was stored at -80°C.
Background signals from negative controls were subtracted and final results calculated in mIU/mL using
standard curves. IFNγ concentrations >200 mIU/mL were considered as reactive, the upper limit of
reactivity was 2000 mIU/mL.
2.8 Cytokine measurements
Supernatants of SARS-CoV-2 antigen stimulated blood cells were prepared and isolated as explained
for the detection of IFN-γ by SARS-CoV-2 Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) and analyzed by
LEGENDplex™ using the Human Essential Immune Response Panel (Bio Legend, California, US) for
L-4, IL-2, CXCL-10 (IP-10), IL-1β, TNFα, CCL-2 (MCP-1), IL-17A, IL-6, IL-10, IFNγ, IL-12p70,
CXCL-8 (IL-8), TGFβ1) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Analysis was performed using an
LSR II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Germany) and data analyzed using the LEGENDplex™ Data
Analysis Software Suite.
2.9 Data Analysis
RStudio (Version 1.2.5001), with R (version 3.6.1) was used for data analysis and figure generation.
The additional packages “beeswarm” and “RcolorBrewer” were used only for data depiction purposes.

calculated in order to determine correlation between IGRA results and antibody responses or
neutralization using the “cor” function from R’s “stats” library. Mann-Whitney U test was used to
determine difference between signal distributions between dialyzed and control groups using the
“wilcox.test” function from R’s “stats” library. Pre-processing of data such as matching sample metadata
and collecting results from multiple assay platforms was performed in Excel 2016.

3. Results
3.1 Dialyzed patients have reduced antibody titers following vaccination
To characterize the vaccination response in patients on maintenance dialysis, we measured IgG and IgA
levels in plasma 21 days after the second dose of Pfizer BNT162b2 using MULTICOV-AB, a multiplex
immunoassay containing antigens from Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins of both SARS-CoV-2 and the
endemic human coronaviruses (hCoVs) (20). As a control group, 34 samples from healthcare workers
vaccinated at the same time points as the 81 patients on hemodialysis were used. (Detailed information
on the study population can be found in Table 1, Table S2 and S3.) As indicated by the lack of a
significant anti-Nucleocapsid (N) IgG or IgA response, none of the study participants had been
previously infected or seroconverted after a SARS-CoV-2 infection (data not shown). IgG responses
towards the original B.1 isolate in vaccinated dialysis patients were significantly reduced (p<0·0001)
and more variable (Fig. 1a.) than in the control group, which reached the upper limit of detection of the
assay, as seen previously (21). Interestingly, plasma IgA responses in the dialysis group were
comparable to the control group (Fig. 1b, p=0·38). Overall, within our dialysis population, four from 81
vaccinated individuals (4·92%) were classified as serologic non-responders with antibody titers below
the cut-off. As an additional control, S1 IgG titers were measured using a commercial assay (Fig. S2),
which identified the same pattern of a significantly diminished antibody response in dialyzed patients
(272·3 RU/mL) compared to non-dialyzed individuals (456·8 RU/mL, p<0·0001). As SARS-CoV-2 is
a mucosal-targeted virus, we also collected saliva from our vaccination cohort and assessed IgG and
IgA levels using MULTICOV-AB. When examining antibody titers found in saliva, dialyzed individuals
had significantly lower IgG titers (p=0·0007) but similar IgA titers (p=0·70) to the control group (Fig.
1c and d). To examine responses towards emerging variants of concern (VoC), Spike-receptor binding
domains (RBD) of the B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South African), Cluster 5 (Mink) and B.1.429 (LA)
variants were included as part of MULTICOV-AB (21). As expected (18, 21), antibody binding towards
B.1.1.7 in both dialyzed and non-dialyzed individuals was comparable to B.1 (original isolate), while
binding was clearly reduced for B.1.351 (Fig. 1a). Antibody binding for Cluster 5 and B.1.429 was
similar to the B.1 isolate for both groups (Fig. S1). As part of the MULTICOV-AB antigen panel, we
also analyzed the humoral response towards endemic CoV S1 and N protein, but found no general
significant difference between control group and dialysis patients (Fig. S3).
3.2 Neutralization is reduced in dialysis patients after vaccination
To assess neutralizing potency of plasma towards both the original B.1 isolate and VoC RBDs, we used
a previously described ACE2-RBD competition assay (21). Neutralization across both wild-type and all
VoCs measured was significantly reduced in dialyzed individuals compared to non-dialyzed (all
p<0·0001) (Fig. 1e, Fig. S4). As expected, there were differences between the variants of concern
themselves, with B.1.351 having the lowest neutralization for both control and dialyzed individuals.
However, responses were comparably low for all VoC tested for patients on intermittent dialysis and

additional immunosuppressive medication in the dialysis group further reduced neutralizing potency
with all samples located in the 25th quartile (Fig. 1e).

3.3 T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is diminished in dialyzed individuals
As clinical studies have suggested that both cellular and humoral response can confer protection from a
SARS-CoV-2 infection (22), we also assessed vaccination-induced T-cell responses by IFN release
assay and characterized cytokine and chemokine responses after stimulation with a Spike S1-derived
peptide pool by multiplex cytokine measurements. Consistent with reduced anti-Spike S1 IgG and antiRBD IgG levels (Fig. 1a, Fig. S2), IGRA showed significantly lower levels of IFN released in the
supernatants of stimulated T-cells from vaccinated patients on maintenance dialysis (p<0·0001, Fig. 2a).
In addition, within the control group, all but one T-cell sample were classified as reactive by IGRA
whereas only 71·6 % were within the hemodialyzed group. Of the 12 analyzed cytokines beyond IFN,
only IL-8 and CCL-2 (both p<0·0001) were significantly different between the two immunized groups,
whereas no other Th1 type cytokines such as TNF or IL-2 accompanied the IFN response (Fig. 2b-f,
Fig. S5).
As of now there are no defined correlates of protection against a SARS-CoV-2 infection and relative
importance of cellular versus humoral response is equally undefined (23, 24), so we correlated B- and
T-cell responses in our vaccination cohort. Comparable to other studies examining vaccination
responses of BNT162b2 in a similar setting (25), we observed a moderate correlation between T-cell
responses measured by IGRA and B-cell responses determined by RBD B.1-specific IgG levels (ρ=0·56,
Fig. 3a) and RBD B.1 IgG-neutralizing potency (ρ=0·55, Fig. 3b) and a skew towards increased B-cell
reactivity in both control group and individuals on hemodialysis.
4. Discussion
In order to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, efficient vaccination to create herd immunity
without the infection-induced mortality will be key. We initiated this study to further increase
information, including neutralization and response to variants of concern, on vaccination-induced
immune responses in at risk immunocompromised populations such as renal dialysis patients. Similar
to other groups, we found robust efficacy of the vaccine within dialyzed patients (9, 13), confirming that
our results are comparable to other studies. Overall, 95% of our dialysis patients showed a humoral
immune response to vaccination, higher than what other studies with similar time points had found (1012, 14, 25). We can only speculate about potential reasons such as difference in renal replacement
therapies, composition of the patient cohort or co-morbidities. It should be noted that titers were
significantly reduced in dialysis patients compared to control individuals, which could result in reduced
vaccine efficacy within this group. We also observed differences in humoral IgG and cellular T-cell
response in our dialysis group, with four non-humoral responders and 23 non-T-cell responders,
respectively. Overall, it is apparent in our data that in both groups vaccination response was skewed
towards secretory immunity. This is in line with exploratory studies using BNT161b1 and other mRNA
vaccines, which induce a B-cell response peak around two weeks after the boosting dose to then decline
before reaching a memory plateau phase (26, 27). Future studies will be needed to determine the
longevity and relative contribution of both T- and B-cell responses towards vaccination-induced
protection. Interestingly, we found no significant differences in vaccination-induced IgA levels in both
saliva and plasma between our study groups. Although several studies reported lower protective IgG
titers over time following hepatitis B, influenza A or SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, IgA levels were not
analyzed here (9-17). Interestingly, a monoclonal IgA antibody capable of recognizing both the SARSCoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and blocking ACE2 receptor interaction combined with an
increased neutralization ability over its IgG equivalent has been described (28). .Some studies even
report a higher neutralizing capacity of purified serum IgA monomers from early convalescent sera
compared to IgG and increased saliva IgA titers and neutralization versus IgG in recovered hospitalized
COVID-19 patients (29). We identified a clearly reduced neutralizing capacity towards all VoC RBDs
tested in our dialyzed individuals compared to controls. Taking into account that SARS-CoV-2

infections were increased in vaccinated dialysis patients compared to vaccinated control individuals
(11), further monitoring is urgently needed to determine if vaccine-induced protection prevents infection
with increasingly circulating and diverse SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains or if additional protection
measures still need to be put in place throughout therapy session despite a completed vaccination
scheme.
Individuals with kidney failure are at increased risk of infections and malignancies and the uremic milieu
may trigger a chronic inflammatory state, which promotes T-cell exhaustion and suppression of IFN
production (30, 31). Indeed, patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) had significantly higher
serum levels of cytokines such as IFN, TNF, IL-8, and CCL-2 compared to healthy controls. After
mitogen stimulation, both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in ESKD group demonstrated a pro-inflammatory
phenotype, more exhausted and anergic CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and a reduced frequency of follicular
helper T-cells, which are important for humoral immunity (32). In the light of these immunological
changes, our results about diminished SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses and increased
proinflammatory cytokine release may account in part for impaired vaccine-induced IgG responses in
these patients.
Our study has several limitations. While we have a reasonable sample size (81 dialysis patients), which
is similar or even larger compared to several other studies (12, 13, 25), our control group is not age- and
gender-matched. In addition, we evaluated only one of the currently approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
with samples from a single dialysis center and did not perform in-depth immune phenotyping or
assessment of SARS-CoV-2 responsive T-cell frequencies. We also lack paired saliva and plasma
samples pre- and post first dose to characterize B- and T-cell response kinetics or assess potential crossreactivity of endemic CoV antibodies in immunocompromised individuals across the dosing scheme.
However, all of our samples were collected at the same time and following an identical dosing regimen,
allowing us to make a direct comparison between our two groups of interest (dialyzed versus nondialyzed). Additionally, the lack of previously infected samples within our study groups, means we are
studying only the vaccine-induced response.
Taken together, we provide robust evidence that a completed two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 elicits
both antibody and T-cell responses in patients on maintenance dialysis towards the SARS-CoV-2 B.1
isolate. Future studies are needed to assess the lifespan and long-term kinetics of the vaccination
response. As neutralization is reduced in dialyzed patients towards all VoCs examined, our data also
highlights the need to monitor if infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern occur more frequently
in this vulnerable population compared to vaccinated healthy individuals.

Figure Legends
Fig. 1. Humoral immune response in hemodialyzed individuals after vaccination with Pfizer BNT162b2.
IgG (a, c), IgA response (b, d) and neutralizing capacity of IgG (e) towards the indicated SARS-CoV-2 WT (B.1),
UK (B.1.1.7), South African (B.1.351) in plasma (a, b, e) or saliva (c, d) from controls (red circles, n=34),
individuals on maintenance dialysis (blue circles, n=71) and hemodialyzed individuals on immunosuppressive
medication (yellow circles, n=10) 21 days post second vaccination was measured using MULTICOV-AB (a, b, c,
d) or an ACE2-RBD competition assay (e). Data is displayed as median fluorescence intensity (MFI) (a-d).
Neutralization capacity is displayed as ratio where 1 indicates maximum neutralization and 0 no neutralization (e).
Saliva (c, d) was collected from 33 controls (red circles), 65 individuals on maintenance dialysis (blue circles) and
from 9 individuals on maintenance dialysis and immunosuppressive medication (yellow circles). Boxes represent
the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, whiskers show the largest and smallest non-outlier values. Outliers were
determined by 1·5 times IQR. Statistical significance was calculated by Mann-Whitney-U (two-sided).
Significance was defined as *<0·01, **<0·001, ***<0·0001 or n.s.>0·01.
Fig. 2. Cellular immune response in hemodialyzed individuals after vaccination with Pfizer BNT162b2.
Whole blood from vaccinated controls (red circles, n=34), individuals on maintenance dialysis (blue circles, n=71)
and hemodialyzed individuals on immunosuppressive medication (yellow circles, n=10) 21 days post second
vaccination was ex vivo stimulated using a SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 specific peptide pool. Supernatant fractions
were analyzed by interferon γ release assay (IGRA, a) or bead-based multiplex-cytokine assay for CCL-2 (b), IL8 (c), TNFα (d), IL-2 (e) and IL-1β (f). Data is shown in mIU/mL for IGRA or pg/mL for the multiplex-cytokine
assay. T-cells were classified as reactive if IFNγ was >200 mIU/mL. IGRA (a) was carried out with samples from
all study participants. Bead based-cytokine measurements (b-f) were performed with samples from 29 control, 42
hemodialyzed and 8 hemodialyzed individuals on immunosuppressive medication. Samples that were classified as
above upper or below the lower limit of detection of the cytokine assay or the IGRA are shown at the respective
limit. Boxes represent the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, whiskers show the largest and smallest non-outlier
values. Outliers were determined by 1·5 times IQR. Statistical significance was calculated by Mann-Whitney-U
(two-sided). Significance was defined as *<0·01, **<0·001, ***<0·0001 or n.s.>0·01.
Fig. 3. Relationship of cellular and humoral immune response after vaccination with Pfizer BNT162b2.
T-cell responses assessed by IGRA for IFNγ (mIU/mL) and B-cell responses assessed by MULTICOV-AB IgG
binding to WT RBD B.1 (a) or ACE2-WT RBD (B.1) competition assay (b) were plotted for correlation analysis
in the vaccinated control group (red circles, n=34), in the vaccinated hemodialyzed group (blue circles, n=71) and
in hemodialyzed individuals on additional immunosuppressive medication (yellow circles, n=10). Correlation was
calculated using Spearman’s coefficient.
