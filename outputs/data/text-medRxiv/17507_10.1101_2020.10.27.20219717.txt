Abstract:
We examined Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) mortality following 5 mass gatherings at
outdoor rallies in the United States, during August 2020. We found that COVID-19 mortality
started increasing 19-24 days after the mass gathering. In a 50-mile radius there was a 2.1-fold
increase in COVID-19 mortality, and in a 51-100 miles radius there was a 1.4-fold increase. Our
results suggest that precautions should be taken in mass gatherings and in at least a 50-mile
radius, in order to limit COVID-19 mortality.

Introduction:
Mass gatherings have been linked to Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) deaths at the start of
the pandemic, which led governments to temporarily limit most mass gatherings.1 This makes it
difficult to determine the effect of mass gatherings on COVID-19 mortality in the later stage of
the pandemic, which has more testing and treatments.2

If mass gatherings are followed by increased mortality, there is a need to estimate the radius of
this effect in order to increase precautions in that region.

Methods:
Five mass gatherings occurred in August 2020 at outdoor rallies, in the states of Minnesota
(August 17th), Wisconsin (August 17th), Arizona (August 18th), Pennsylvania (August 20th), and
New-Hampshire (August 28th). We retrospectively extracted the daily COVID-19 mortality of
each county in those states in the 30 days following each mass gathering.3

We aggregated the counties based on distance from their center coordinates to the coordinates of
the mass gathering in their state, with groups of 0-50 miles, 51-100 miles, above 100 miles.4 We
also extracted the mortality in all the states that did not have those mass gatherings in August
2020, and we defined their control mass gathering date as the median date of the August mass
gatherings (August 18th).

We calculated the mortality rate per 100,000 capita with a 7-day moving-average, and examined
its trend using the JoinPoint Regression Program (National Cancer Institute), and a 2-tailed
statistical test with a significance level of 0.05. Lastly, we examined the rate and 95% confidence
interval (CI) of the incidence when the gatherings are expected to have effects on deaths (20 days
post-gathering)5, and compared it with the rate at 30 days post-gathering.

Results:
At 0-50 miles from the mass gathering, the COVID-19 death rate decreased from gathering day
to day 24 (-1.6% daily-change, 95% confidence interval -2.4% to -0.9%), followed by an
increase until day 30 (7.8% daily-change, 95% confidence interval 1.4% to 14.6%). At day 20
the rate was 0.07/100,000 capita (95% confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.1), and at day 30 it
increased to 0.15/100,000 capita (95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.2, 2.1-fold increase; Figure
1).

mass gathering who were 50 miles or less from the gathering location. The line indicates the

At 51-100 miles, the COVID-19 death rate decreased from gathering day to day 19 (-1.9% dailychange, 95% confidence interval -2.3% to -1.5%), followed by an increase until day 30 (3.9%
daily-change, 95% confidence interval 2.9% to 4.8%). At day 20 the rate was 0.1/100,000 capita
(95% confidence interval, 0.08 to 0.12), and at day 30 it increased to 0.15/100,000 capita (95%
confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.17, 1.4-fold increase; Figure 2).

At over 100 miles, the COVID-19 death rate decreased from gathering day to day 25 (-2.7%
daily-change, 95% confidence interval -3.3% to -2.1%), followed by a daily change of 7% (95%
confidence interval -0.4% to 15%). At day 20 the rate was 0.18/100,000 capita (95% confidence
interval, 0.15 to 0.2), and at day 30 it increased to 0.22/100,000 capita (95% confidence interval,
0.2 to 0.25, 1.2-fold increase; Figure 3).

In states without the mass gatherings, the COVID-19 death rate decreased from control gathering
day to day 20 (-1.1% daily-change, 95% confidence interval -1.4% to -0.8%), followed by an
increase until day 30 (1.1% daily-change, 95% confidence interval 0.2% to 2.1%). At day 20 the
rate was 0.27/100,000 capita (95% confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.27), and at day 30 it increased
to 0.3/100,000 capita (95% confidence interval, 0.29 to 0.31, 1.1-fold increase; Figure 4).

Discussion:
Our analysis showed an increase in COVID-19 mortality following mass gatherings, with the
highest increase at 0-50 miles from the mass gathering (2.1-fold), followed by 51-100 miles (1.4fold), 100+ miles (1.2-fold), and in states without the mass gatherings (1.1-fold).

The mortality increase in states without mass gatherings could stem from unrelated factors,6,7 or
relate to out-of-state participants in the mass gatherings, such as the Georgia resident who died of
COVID-19 after attending an Oklahoma mass gathering without a mask or distancing.8 States
could promote masks and distancing in mass gatherings, and in at least a 50-mile radius from the
mass gathering, which may limit COVID-19 mortality.
