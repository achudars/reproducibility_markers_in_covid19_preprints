Abstract

28

SARS-CoV-2 infects multiple organs including the respiratory tract and gut. Whether regional

29

microbiomes are disturbed significantly to affect the disease progression of COVID-19 is largely

30

unknown. To address this question, we performed cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of throat

31

and anal swabs from 35 COVID-19 adults and 15 controls by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results

32

allowed a partitioning of patients into 3-4 categories (I-IV) with distinct microbial community types

33

in both sites. Lower-diversity community types often appeared in the early phase of COVID-19, and

34

synchronous fast restoration of both the respiratory and gut microbiomes from early dysbiosis towards

35

late near-normal was observed in 6/8 mild COVID-19 adult patients despite they had a relatively slow

36

clinical recovery. The synchronous shift of the community types was associated with significantly

37

positive bacterial interactions between the respiratory tract and gut, possibly along the airway-gut

38

axis. These findings reveal previously unknown interactions between respiratory and gut

39

microbiomes, and suggest that modulations of regional microbiota might help to improve the recovery

40

from COVID-19 in adult patients.

Introduction

45

COVID-19, a severe respiratory disease caused by a novel virus SARS-CoV-21,2, has led to a devastating

46

global pandemic. It typically presents as asymptomatic infection and mild respiratory symptoms, but

47

in those older than 60 years or having comorbidities, COVID-19 can develop into severe pneumonia

48

and cause death3,4. The biological mechanisms behind the varied clinical presentation of disease are

49

not fully understood. Because the microbiota plays a major role in the maintenance of human health

50

by shaping the immune system and maintaining homeostasis5, and the microbial composition in the

51

respiratory tract and the gut have been linked to the occurrence and severity of various respiratory

52

viral infections, and affects subsequent respiratory health6,7, such as increased airway susceptibility

53

to infection by other RVs and/or colonization of pathogenic bacteria8-10, it is reasonable to posit that

54

the new respiratory infection COVID-19 may also interact with microbiota.

55

Recent studies show that SARS-CoV-2 infects human gut enterocytes and causes diarrhea11,12,

56

and COVID-19 patients have altered gut microbiota featuring an enrichment of opportunistic

57

pathogens and a depletion of beneficial bacteria13,14. However, the effect of COVID-19 on respiratory

58

microbiome has never been evaluated. Although one study reported persistent alterations in the gut

59

microbiota using longitudinal stool samples collected during COVID-19 patients’ hospitalization13,

60

but no study has been performed to simultaneously investigate the temporal dynamics of both the

61

respiratory and gut microbiota at various stages of disease. In this study, we investigated the dynamics

62

of both the respiratory and gut microbiomes in a cohort of COVID-19 patients and controls, and

63

presented a consistent pattern of changes in these two organs from early dysbiosis towards late

64

incomplete restoration in the majority of COVID-19 adults.

Results

66

Study cohort

67

The study subjects included 35 adult COVID-19 patients from 17 to 68 years of age, 15 healthy

68

adults, and 10 non-COVID-19 patients with other diseases. All COVID-19 patients (except patient

69

p09) had mild clinical symptoms. A total of 146 specimens including 37 pairs of both throat and anal

70

swabs were collected from COVID-19 patients (Supplementary Fig. S1). High-throughput

71

sequencing of the V4-region of bacterial 16S rRNA gene was performed for all samples (See

72

Supplementary Methods).

73
74

Respiratory microbiome dynamics in COVID-19

75

The 16S-rRNA gene sequences of all throat swabs were resolved into 3,126 amplicon sequence

76

variants (ASVs) representing 17 known phyla including 209 known genera (Supplementary Table

77

S1). Six throat microbial community types (or clusters) were identified using the Dirichlet

78

Multinomial Mixtures (DMM) modelling based on lowest Laplace approximation (Fig. 1a) and

79

visualized by Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) based on Bray-Curtis distance (Fig. 1b).

80

Healthy adults (H) and non-COVID-19 patients (NP) formed independent clusters. The vast majority

81

of the specimens of COVID-19 patients were divided into four community types, called I-IV, and 6

82

specimens were included in the NP type (Fig. 1a). All COVID-19-related community types, as well

83

as the NP type, were significantly separated from the H type. Community types III and IV were not

84

only significantly separated from the types I and II, but also from each other (Fig. 1b). Consistently,

85

significantly lower richness and evenness were observed in community types III and IV, compared

86

with the H type (Fig. 1c).

87

To more directly demonstrate that the variation of throat microbial composition is an indicator

88

of COVID-19 disease stages, the community type-specific indicator taxa were identified based on the

89

top 30 microbial genera (Fig. 1d). The type H was characterized by bacterial genus Bacteroides

90

(predominant taxa in the lung of healthy individuals) and unclassified Comamonadaceae, whereas

91

the NP type was marked by pro-inflammatory Enterobacteriaceae members. In contrast, the indicator

92

bacteria of four COVID-19-related community types were Alloprevotella in I, Porphyromonas,

93

Neisseria, Fusobacterium and unclassified Bacteroidales in II, Pseudomonas in III, and

94

Saccharibacteria incertae sedis, Rothia and unclassified Actinomycetales in IV (Fig. 1d). It is clear

95

that the indicators in the types III and IV belong to putative pathogenic (e.g. Pseudomonas) and

96

opportunistic pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Rothia). Community type I contained Alloprevotella genus, as

97

well as abundant Bacteroides and Prevotella that typically present in the H type (Fig.1a). Pathogenic

98

bacteria Pseudomonas, Saccharibacteria incertae sedis and Rothia that are associated with

99

pneumonia and various human diseases were significantly enriched in community types III and IV,

100

reflecting an impaired microbiome (dysbiosis) in the respiratory tract15-17. Apart from beneficial

101

commensals (e.g. Bacteroidales), some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria such as Porphyromonas,

102

Fusobacterium, and Neisseria that typically exist in the nasopharynx, and are associated with

103

pneumonia or chronic periodontitis18-20, were over represented in type II, possibly reflecting an

104

intermediate state between the normal and dysbiosis in the respiratory microbiota (Supplementary

105

Table S1 and Fig. S2). According to indicator characteristics, community types I to IV reflected a

106

progressive imbalance of the respiratory microbiome.

107

Longitudinal analysis showed that lower-diversity community types often appeared in early

108

specimens (Fig. 1e), and throat microbiota was dominated by few putative pathogenic and

109

opportunistic bacteria at the early phase of COVID-19 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Prominent

110

microbiome community type shifts from early lower-diversity community types (NP, IV or II)

111

towards later higher-diversity types (II or I) were observed in 9/24 COVID-19 adults who had

112

specimens at two or more time points. For example, an obvious throat microbiome progression from

113

type (IV or II) in early specimens to type I in late specimens was observed in five patients (p17, p25,

114

p13, p11 and p05) with 4 or more consecutive specimens (Fig. 1e). Accompanied with the restoration

115

of throat microbiota, beneficial commensals appeared to occupy the niches, and the bacterial diversity

116

increased accordingly (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, a reversed pattern was observed in four

117

patients who had microbiome composition shift from early higher-diversity types (I or II) to later

118

lower-diversity type (II-IV), implying a worsening of the throat microbiome. For example, in the only

119

severe case (p09), the community type II on day 10 was shifted to type IV on day 27, and sustained

120

to at least day 33 after symptom onset (Fig. 1e), and pathogenic bacteria Saccharibacteria incertae

121

sedis and Rothia were significantly enriched at late stage (Supplementary Fig. S2). Furthermore, a

122

persistent Pseudomonas-dominated throat microbiota (community type III) was observed in three

123

patients (p02, p03 and p04). These results indicate that the change of the respiratory microbiome

124

might be closely associated with the disease progression in COVID-19 patients.

126

Gut microbiome dynamics in COVID-19

127

To expand the scope of this research, a total of 1,940 ASVs were recovered from the 16S-rRNA

128

gene sequences of all anal swabs, representing 13 known phyla including 182 known genera

129

(Supplementary Table S1). The gut microbial communities of COVID-19 patients formed three

130

distinct community types I-III (Fig. 2a-b). The richness and evenness of the gut microbiome

131

decreased from type I to III (Fig. 2c). Indicator analyses showed that type I was primarily

132

characterized by healthy gut bacteria including Bacteroides genus and several known butyrate-

133

producing bacteria (e.g. Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Blautia, and Coprococcus) and one

134

opportunistic pathogenic bacterium (Finegoldia) (Fig. 2d)21-27. The indicators of type II mainly

135

contain various pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Neisseria and Actinomyces). In

136

community type III, the gut microbiota was dominated by Pseudomonas, implying a severe dysbiosis.

137

We also used the gut community types I-III to reflect the progressive worsening of the microbiome.

138

A shift of the gut microbiome from the lower-diversity community type (II or III) towards a

139

higher-diversity type (I or II) was observed over time in 8/10 patients who had anal swabs at different

140

time points (Fig. 2e). Accompanied with the shift, a clear trend of increase of bacterial diversity and

141

the relative abundance of beneficial commensals (e.g. Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium) was

142

observed in the gut microbiota from early to late stages of COVID-19 (Supplementary Fig. S3),

143

indicating the restoration of gut microbiota. Only one patient had a reverse shift from higher-diversity

144

type II to lower-diversity community type III.

145
146

Association between the respiratory and gut microbiomes in COVID-19

147

Most paired throat and anal swabs showed the same or similar community type levels (Fig. 3a).

148

In particular, the direction of shift over time of the microbiome appeared to match between the throat

149

and the gut in 7/8 patients who had two or more paired specimens at different time points (Fig. 3a).

150

Synchronous improvements of both the respiratory and gut microbiomes from early lower-diversity

151

community type towards late higher-diversity type occurred in six patients (p05, p17, p13, p11, p25

152

and p29). One patient (p33) showed an improved respiratory microbiome but a stable gut community

153

type on day 24. Only one case (p07) had a worsen gut microbiome from day 24 to day 35 but remained

154

a stable respiratory community type. These results suggested that the microbial community dynamics

155

of either niches may reflect disease development and flora restoration. Because of no available anal

156

specimens, we were unable to assess whether the gut microbiota, like the respiratory microbiota,

157

shifted from higher-diversity type to lower-diversity type over time in this severe case (p09) (Fig. 1e).

158

Except for the duration of COVID-19, the respiratory and gut microbial community divergence

159

seemed not to be significantly correlated with age, gender, antibiotics use, and detection of SARS-

160

CoV-2 RNA (Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5).

161

We further assessed the changes of the relative abundance of several representative bacteria,

162

including two probiotics (i.e. Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium), and five pathogenic bacteria

163

(Fig. 3b). The relative abundances of Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium appeared to be

164

negatively correlated with the relative abundance of the five pathogenic bacteria. An obvious decrease

165

in the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria was accompanied by the restoration of the respiratory

166

and gut microbiome over time in five patients having three or more longitudinal samples (Fig.3b

167

upper panel and Supplementary Fig. S2-S3). Moreover, significantly decreased abundance of

168

Pseudomonas was observed in both organs in another two patients (p23 and p29). The relative

169

abundance of Pseudomonas increased in the only patient (p07) who had a worsening gut microbiome.

170
171

Bacteria–bacteria co-occurrence networks

172

There were four indicator bacteria genera (Porphyromonas, Neisseria, and Fusobacterium in

173

type II and Pseudomonas in type III) in the throat microbiomes that had been identified as the

174

indicators of gut microbial community types II and III in COVID-19 patients (Supplementary Fig.

175

S6). Apart from the shared indicators, oropharyngeal pathogenic bacteria Capnocytophaga and

176

Actinomyces were also identified as indicators of the gut microbial community type II (Figs. 1d and

177

2d)28,29. Because community types II and III often appeared in the early stage of COVID-19 (Figs. 1e

178

and 2e), the appearance of these oropharyngeal bacteria in the gut suggested that a cross-talk between

179

the respiratory and gut microbiomes occurred by frequent bacterial translocation during the early

180

stage.

181

To further investigate the association between the respiratory and gut microbiomes, we

182

performed co-occurrence network analysis using paired specimens from 13 patients. Significantly

183

positive interactions between the respiratory and gut microbiota were observed (FDR-adjusted

184

P<0.05 and spearman correlation r > 0.7), despite obvious separations of co-occurrence patterns

185

between different community types (Fig. 4). There were four patterns of co-occurrence networks

186

(Throat-IV, Throat-III, II-II and I-I) that had been identified, and only bacteria from the same

187

community types formed significant co-occurrence networks regardless of whether they were in the

188

throat or gut. Under the dysbiosis condition, a few dominant pathogenic bacteria (e.g.

189

Saccharibacteria incertae sedis, Rothia and Pseudomonas) mediated the bacterial interactions, and

190

drove the oropharyngeal bacterial translocation to the gut possibly due to increased mucosal

191

permeability of the damaged airway and gut (Fig. 4: Throat-III and Throat-IV). Some beneficial

192

bacteria from Firmicutes are the primary colonizers to prevent immune-mediated diseases21.

193

Accompanied with the increase of bacteria diversity, more gut bacteria started to interact with throat

194

microbiota, and some beneficial commensals (mainly Firmicutes) occupied the niches of the throat

195

and gut mucosa to compete with the pathogenic bacteria (Fig. 4: II-II), leading to a possible restoration

196

of the damaged microbiota in both organs. At the late stage of COVID-19, the species from Firmicutes

197

and Bacterioidetes dominated the bacterial community in both organs (Fig. 4: I-I). In particular, the

198

appearance of various probiotics (e.g. Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium) in both the throat and

199

gut implied further improvement and restoration of the respiratory and gut microbiomes25,30.

Discussion

201

Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection alters microbiota to affect COVID-19 disease progression is an

202

important question that needs answers. In this study, we made three major observations. First, the

203

respiratory and gut microbiota compositions of COVID-19 adults can be characterized by four (I- IV)

204

and three (I-III) community types, respectively, and these types reflect different levels of balance

205

between the near-normal microbiota (type I) and dysbiosis (type III/IV). Second, lower-diversity

206

community types III/IV often appears in the early phase of COVID-19, and a consistent pattern of

207

shift from early dysbiosis towards late near-normal coincides with the recovery of both the respiratory

208

and gut microbiomes in most patients with mild COVID-19. Third, the shift of community types is

209

synchronous in the respiratory tract and gut.

210

SARS-CoV-2 infects cells through ACE2 receptor2, which is highly expressed in respiratory and

211

intestinal epithelial cells31. SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger the cytokine storm, cause local

212

pathological damage32,33. As an open system with direct contact with environment and the primary

213

site for respiratory infections, the respiratory tract microbiota is more easily affected by SARS-CoV-

214

2 infection, but has not been examined yet. We observed alterations of the respiratory microbiota in

215

COVID-19 adults, and presented data on the dynamic change of the respiratory microbiome

216

composition over time. The respiratory microbiome of the COVID-19 adults was characterized by

217

four bacterial community types I-IV, which reflect the different levels of the normal microbiome to

218

dysbiosis. The community type III dominated by Pseudomonas and type IV enriched for other three

219

pathogenic bacteria often appeared in early throat specimens (e.g. first several days after symptom

220

onset), indicating SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a very rapid dysbiosis in respiratory tract. A

221

restoration of the respiratory microbiome from dysbiosis towards near-normal was observed over

222

time in some with mild disease, whereas prolonged or worsening microbiome appeared in a few

223

others including the only one severe case (p09). The inconsistency indicates that the diversity

224

characteristics of the respiratory microbiome had been affected by COVID-19.

225

Intestinal enterocytes that express ACE2 are also the target of SARS-CoV-2 which further up-

226

regulates the expression of ACE2, leading to a longer viral RNA shedding time in the gut than

227

respiratory tract11,31. The baseline microbiome composition with abundant pathogenic bacteria (e.g.

228

Coprobacillus, Clostridium ramoaum and Clostridium hathewayi) had been associated with the fecal

229

levels of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity in a previous study31. However, the sampling time

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.21.20158758; this version posted July 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

230

was relatively late in that study (about 14 days after symptom onset), therefore unable to determine

231

whether the baseline microbiome status is a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or a cause of

232

disease severity. We also observed alterations of the gut microbiota during COVID-19 in adults, and

233

found some pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Streptococcus, Rothia, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Bacteroides

234

and Actinomyces) similar to those reported in the previous observations13,14. However，distinct from

235

the previous studies, three community types I-III were identified to characterize the changes of gut

236

microbiome over time, and low-diversity community types II and III often appeared in early

237

specimens, supporting the early effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the microbiome. A fast restoration with

238

the community type shifted from low-diversity type II to high-diversity type I over time was observed

239

in at least 4 patients. Moreover, the Pseudomonas-dominated community type III appeared in earlier

240

specimens of patients, and showed a slow improvement towards community II in three patients. Of

241

particular importance is that temporal dynamic changes of the respiratory and gut microbiomes

242

matched with each other extremely well, indicating a close association in microbiota between both

243

body sites, possibly via the “airway-gut axis”34.

244

The reason for the fast dysbiosis in both the respiratory tract and gut of patients with COVID-

245

19 might be that the early-stage inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection damages the

246

mucosal tissues in airway, lung and gut7,35, and results in a fast loss of beneficial commensals, which

247

then augments the colonization and growth of pathogens (Supplementary Fig. S7). The use of

248

empirical antibiotics in some patient during the early stages of the pandemic may exacerbate the

249

dysbiosis in the respiratory tract and gut. Therefore, the microbiome composition with enrichment of

250

pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas and Neisseria) was observed in both throat and gut

251

microbiomes during the first several days after symptom onsets. Because the respiratory tract is more

252

receptive to both exogenous and indigenous microbes than the gut7,36, the dysbiosis of respiratory

253

microbiome appeared to be worse and occurred earlier than that of the gut microbiota, as manifested

254

by lower diversity and richness and more indicators of presumed pathogenic bacteria in the former

255

than in the latter. During this early phase, the damaged respiratory tract mucosa enables some invasive

256

respiratory pathogenic bacteria to be translocated to the gut, worsening the gut bacterial community

257

(Supplementary Fig. S7).

258

Gut microbiota plays an important role in human health by shaping local immunity and

259

remodeling mucosal tissues37. It is relatively more stable and plastic than the respiratory microbiota,

260

and it may affect the latter by cross-talk between these two organs along the airway-gut axis34,36, as

261

determined by the significantly positive co-occurrence relationship between the bacteria of the gut

262

and respiratory tract. In spite of longer duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the gut than in the

263

respiratory tract, gut microbiota appeared to have a faster restoration with an increased bacterial

264

diversity and enrichment of beneficial commensals than the respiratory microbiota. The former then

265

promoted the restoration of the latter via bacterial cross-talk, and resulted in a synchronous restoration

266

of both organs (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3).

267

There are at least three major stages reflecting the restoration or worsening of the microbiome

268

in COVID-19 adults. The restoration of the microbiome seemed to be independent of early

269

microbiome community types. For example, several patients remained microbiome community type

270

II for a long time. Age, gender and antibiotics use seemed not to be linked to restoration of the

271

microbiome (Supplementary Fig. S4-S5), implying potential contributions from other factors such as

272

diet and genetic background.

273

We noted that Pseudomonas-dominated bacterial community type III was difficult to restore

274

towards higher-diversity community types in the respiratory tract. Pseudomonas is a well-known

275

pathogenic bacterium, and rarely found in healthy individuals. The identification of early microbiome

276

dysbiosis community type III or IV dominated by Pseudomonas, Rothia, and Saccharibacteria in

277

COVID-19 patients might imply a need for microbiota-based personalized antibiotics treatment

278

against these specific pathogens. The community type II represents a crucial intermediate stage during

279

the restoration of the microbiome from dysbiosis towards near-normal. It was characterized by

280

Neisseria, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas. Fusobacterium. Porphyromonas are the common

281

commensals in the oropharynx and the gut18,20, while Neisseria generally presents in the lung. The

282

appearance of lung Neisseria in both the respiratory tract and the gut, implying bacteria translocations

283

along the “airway-lung-gut axis”. The bacteria translocations may be the consequence of increased

284

permeability among these organs caused by local inflammation38. The Bifidobacterium and some

285

butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g. Faecalibacterium) can improve the inflammatory conditions and

286

regulate innate immunity by down-regulating ACE2 expression, and activating the corresponding

287

signaling pathways25,30. During the restoration of the microbiota, these probiotics started to occupy

288

the ecological niches in the gut and respiratory tract in the type II stage, and governed the microbial

289

communities in both organs by mass replacement of pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Rothia and Neisseria)

290

in the type I stage (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. S7). However, a progressively worsening in the

291

respiratory and gut microbiome might be associated with severe cases of COVID-19.

292

In summary, we revealed for the first time the associations between the respiratory and gut

293

microbiota and COVID-19 disease progression, and observed early dysbiosis towards later restoration

294

to near-normal microbiota in a proportion of adults with mild COVID-19. In the absence of specific

295

antiviral drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, our findings have important clinical implications. First,

296

some indicator bacteria (e.g. pathogenic pseudomonas and beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria)

297

can be used as crucial biomarkers for clinical treatment decision making and prognostic markers. The

298

measurement of predominant short-chain fatty acid (especially butyrate) concentration in fecal

299

samples will be particularly useful in early clinical diagnosis. Second, apart from the routine treatment

300

efforts (e.g. non-specific antiviral and supportive treatments)39, precision intervention and modulation

301

of the gut and respiratory microbiota may open up novel therapeutic alternatives, such as personalized

302

antibiotics therapy to inhibit certain pathogenic bacteria (e.g. pseudomonas). Third, COVID-19

303

tailored probiotics (e.g. Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium), prebiotics (e.g. xylooligosaccharide)

304

treatment, or symbiotic treatments might be applied to modulate the gut and respiratory microbiota

305

to facilitate the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Lastly, fecal microbiota transplantation may be

306

considered as another treatment choice.

Methods

308

Study population

309

A total of 63 subjects, including 35 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, 10 SARS-CoV-2

310

negative patients with various diseases (non-COVID-19) and 15 healthy adults were enrolled in this

311

study. Demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients were provided in Supplementary

312

Table S2 and S340. Specimens including throat swabs and anal swabs were collected from the patients

313

during hospitalization (10-40) at Nantong Third Hospital Affiliated to Nantong University and from

314

healthy adults when they visited the same hospital for physical examination. Sampling was performed

315

using flexible, sterile, dry swabs, which can reach the posterior oropharynx and anus easily

316

(approximately 2 inches) by the professionals at the hospital. At least two throat swabs at different

317

days were available for 32 of 38 COVID-19 patients (Supplementary Fig S1).

318

The study was approved by Nantong Third Hospital Ethics Committee (EL2020006: 28

319

February 2020). Written informed consents were obtained from each of the involved individuals. All

320

experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.

321
322

Confirmation of COVID-19 patients

323

COVID-19 was diagnosed in adult patients according to the National Guidelines for Diagnosis

324

and Treatment of COVID-19. The virus RNA was extracted from all samples using a Mag-Bind RNA

325

Extraction Kit (MACCURA, Sichuan, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then the

326

ORFlab and N genes of SARS-CoV-2 was detected using a Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real

327

Time RT-PCR Kit (Liferiver, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Only the

328

individuals who had at least two consecutive throat swabs been positive for both ORFlab and N genes

329

of SARS-CoV-2 were defined as COVID-19 patients. All positive specimens of COVID-19 patients

330

were confirmed by Nantong Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using recommended

331

real-time RT-PCR assay by China CDC.

332
333

16S rRNA gene sequencing

334

Bacterial DNA was extracted from the swabs using a QIAamp DNA Microbiome Kit (QIAGEN,

335

Düsseldorf, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and eluted with Nuclease-free

336

water and stored at -80℃ until use. The V4 hypervariable region (515-806 nt) of the 16S rRNA gene

337

was amplified universal bacterial primers41. To pool and sort multiple samples in a single tube of

338

reactions, two rounds of PCR amplifications were performed using a novel triple-index amplicon

339

sequencing strategy as described previously42. The first round of the PCR (PCR1) amplification was

340

performed with a reaction mixture containing 8 μL Nuclease-free water, 0.5 μL KOD-Plus-Neo

341

(TOYOBO, Osaka Boseki, Japan), 2.5 μL of 1 μM PCR1 forward primer, 2.5 μL of 1 μM PCR1

342

reverse primer, and 5 μL DNA template. The products of the PCR1 reactions were verified using a

343

1.5% agarose gel, purified using Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,

344

MA, USA), and quantified by a Qubit® 4.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Equal

345

amounts of purified PXR1 products were pooled, and subjected to the secondary round of PCR (PCR2)

346

amplification. The PCR2 was performed with a reaction mix containing 21 μL Nuclease-free water,

347

1 μL KOD-Plus-Neo (TOYOBO, Osaka Boseki, Japan), 5 μL of 1 μM PCR2 forward primer, 5 μL of

348

1 μM PCR2 reverse primer, and 5 μL pooled PCR1 products. The PCR2 products were verified using

349

a 2% agarose gel, purified using the same Gel Extraction Kit and qualified using the Qubit® 4.0

350

Fluorometer. The amounts of the specific product bands were further qualified by Agilent 2100

351

Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Equal molars of specific products were pooled and

352

purified after mixing with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, CA, USA) in a ratio of

353

0.8:1. Purified amplicons were paired-end sequenced (2x250) using Illumina-P250 sequencer.

354
355

Bioinformatic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data

356

Sequenced forward and reverse reads were merged using USEARCH11 software43, then de-

357

multiplexed according to known barcodes using FASTX-Toolkit44. After trimming barcode, adapter

358

and primer sequences using USEARCH11, 19,096,003 sequences were retained with an average of

359

105508 sequences per sample. Samples with sequence <1000 were excluded from the following

360

analysis.

361

Because traditional OTU (operational taxonomic units) picking based on a 97% sequence

362

similarity threshold may miss subtle and real biological sequence variation45, several novel methods

363

such as DADA246 and Deblur47 were developed to resolve sequence data into single-sequence

364

variants. Here, the DADA2 was employed to perform quality control, dereplicate, chimeras remove

365

on Qiime2 platform48 with default settings except for truncating sequence length to 250bp. Finally,

366

an amplicon sequence variant (ASV) table, equivalent to OTU table, was generated and then spitted

367

into gut ASV table (2348 ASVs) and throat ASV table (4050 ASVs). The taxonomic classification of

368

ASV representative sequences was conducted by using the RDP Naive Bayesian Classifier

369

algorithm49 based on the Ribosomal Database project (RDP) 16S rRNA training set (v16) database50.

370

To eliminate sequencing bias across all samples, both the gut ASV table and throat ASV table were

371

subsampled at an even depth of 4700 and 3000 sequences per sample, respectively. The ASV coverage

372

of 82.6% (gut) and 77.2% (throat) were sufficient to capture microbial diversity of both sites.

373
374

Identification and characterization of microbial community types

375

Dirichlet multinomial mixtures (DMM)51 is an algorithm that can efficiently cluster samples

376

based on microbial composition, its sensitivity, reliability and accuracy had been confirmed in many

377

microbiome studies52-54. DMM clustering were conducted with bacterial genus abundance from throat

378

and gut microbiota using the command “get.communitytype” introduced by v1.44.1 of mothur55. The

379

appropriate microbial community type numbers (DMM clusters) were determined based on the lowest

380

Laplace approximation index. According to sample counts per cluster, the fisher exact test was applied

381

to discover significant associations between each cluster and host conditions (such as healthy controls,

382

COVID-19 patients, and Non-COVID-19 patients) under P values that are below 0.05 adjusted by

383

the False Discovery Rate (FDR). Conjugated with the Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM), the

384

reliability of DMM clustering was further validated and then visualized by the Non-metric

385

multidimensional scaling (NMDS) based on the Bray-Curtis distance under bacterial genus level.

386

“The ANOSIM statistic “R” compares the mean of ranked dissimilarities between groups to the mean

387

of ranked dissimilarities within groups. An R value close to “1.0” indicates dissimilarity between

388

groups, whereas an R value close to “0” indicates an even distribution of high and low ranks within

389

and between groups”. The ANOSIM statistic R always ranges between −1 to 1. The positive R values

390

closer to 1 suggest more similarity within sites than between sites, and that close to 0 represent no

391

difference between sites or within sites56. ANOSIM p values that are lower than 0.05 imply a higher

392

similarity within sites. Richness (Observed OTUs/ASVs) and Pielou's or Species evenness for each

393

community type were calculated for estimating the difference of alpha diversity. The analyses of alpha

394

diversity, NMDS and ANOSIM were performed using R package “vegan” v2.5-6. Dynamic change

395

of community types was showed according to collected dates of specimens with R package ‘P

396

heatmap’. For association between community types and potential confounding factors such as sex,

397

age, virus existence and antibiotic use, the fisher exact test based on sample count was performed and

398

the association with FDR-corrected p value <0.05 was considered significant.

399
400

Indicator analysis in throat and gut community types

401

According to the definition given by the United Nations Environment Programme (1996), the

402

indicator species are a group of species whose status provides information on the overall condition of

403

the ecosystem and of other species in that ecosystem, reflecting the quality and changes in

404

environmental conditions as well as aspects of community composition. To obtain the reliable

405

indicator genus that is specific to each community type, we performed the Indicator Species Analysis

406

using the indicspecies package (ver.1.7.8) 57 in R platform with top 30 genus contributing to DMM

407

clustering in both throat (accounting for 66% cumulative difference) and gut (68% cumulative

408

difference). Dynamic changes of indicator genera corresponding to each throat community type were

409

showed in all COVID-19 patients using the pheatmap package in R and only gut indicator genera

410

with indicator values that were above 0.05 were presented in the patients.

411
412

Co-occurrence network analysis of a crosstalk between throat and gut microbiota

413

Based on microbial genus abundances of both throat and gut samples collected from 13 COVID-

414

19 patients at the same time point, we calculated the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (Pearson’s r)

415

among the throat & gut microbial genera. The Pearson’s r with P values that were below 0.05 after

416

the FDR adjustment were considered significant correlations. Co-occurrence network of significantly

417

correlated microbial genus pairs was visualized using Cytoscape v3.8.058.

Pearson correlation was employed to calculate correlation coefficient (r) between bacterial genus

616

pairs based on their relative abundances. Co-occurred pairs with r > 0.7 under FDR-adjusted P < 0.05

617

were shown and visualized by Cytoscape version 3.8.0. Negative correlations that were not significant

618

were not shown. Edges were sized based on r values. The stars represented unclassified bacteria

619

genera. Four co-occurrence patterns mediated by throat-IV indicator, throat-III indicator, throat-II &

620

gut-II indicators, and throat-I& gut-I indicators, respectively. The bigger squares or circles were

621

indicators in Figs. 1d and 2d.

Supplementary Figure S7. Putative restoration model of the respiratory and gut microbiomes

655

over time in adults with mild COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in a fast dysbiosis in

656

both the respiratory tract and gut at the very early phase of the disease. A fast restoration of both the

657

respiratory and gut microbiomes from early dysbiosis towards late near-normal status was observed

658

in most adults with mild COVID-19 albeit they seemed to have a relatively slow clinical recovery.

659

This model reflects the major microbiome dynamic change in most adults with mild COVID-19 but

not all features in all patients, especially in those with severe disease.
