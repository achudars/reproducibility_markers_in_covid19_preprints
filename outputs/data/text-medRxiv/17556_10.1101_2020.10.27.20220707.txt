Abstract:
We examined COVID-19 hospitalizations following mass gatherings in
Wisconsin and Minnesota, United States (September 17-18, 2020). We found
that the hospitalization rate increased 15-fold in the Minnesota gathering
county, and 12.7-fold in the Wisconsin gathering county. On the state level, it
increased 2-fold in Minnesota, and 2.3-fold in Wisconsin, while not increasing
significantly in states without gatherings. Our findings suggest that mass
gatherings are followed by increased COVID-19 hospitalizations, and that
precautions should be taken.

Introduction:
In march 2020, at the start of the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic, most countries and organizations recommended to avoid mass
gatherings.[1] In September 2020, there have been policy makers that brought
back mass gatherings under the assumption that it can now be done safely.
One such gathering was in an outdoor rally in Minnesota, United States, which
was followed by COVID-19 hospitalization of two of its participants.[2] It is
not known if they were infected in the gathering, and if the rate of
hospitalizations changes following mass gatherings.[3,4]

Methods:
We extracted COVID-19 hospitalization by date at the county and state level for
the mass gatherings in outdoor rallies in Beltrami, Minnesota (gathering on
September 18, 2020), and Marathon, Wisconsin (gathering on September 17,
2020).[5]
Those counties had a combined population of 182,880 residents based on the
U.S. Census data. We analyzed the county incidence rate per 100,000 capita and
utilized a weekly moving average. We compared the change from the gathering

day to 21 days later, since that was the most days of data we had on both
counties, and since most infections reach hospitalizations during that period.[6]
We also examined the change in the relevant states of the gathering counties
(Wisconsin, Minnesota). We compared that change with the change in states
who did not have a mass gathering rally since April 2020 and had daily
hospitalizations counts in COVID-tracking project.
These states were Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii,
Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine,
Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New
York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. For non-gathering states, we used
a comparison date that was the date of the Minnesota gathering (September 18,
2020). Statistical significance was evaluated based on the 95% confidence
interval.

Results:
In Beltrami, on the gathering day the hospitalization rate was 0.3/100,000 (95%
confidence interval -0.2 to 0.8). By day 21 the hospitalization rate increased to
4.5/100,000 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 7.6; 15-fold).

In Marathon, on the gathering day the hospitalization rate was 0.3/100,000
(95% confidence interval 0 to 0.6). By day 21 the hospitalization rate increased
to 3.8/100,000 (95% confidence interval 2.5 to 5.1; 12.7-fold; figure 1).

In Minnesota, on the gathering day the hospitalization rate was 0.6/100,000
(95% confidence interval 0.5 to 0.7). By day 21 the hospitalization rate
increased to 1.2/100,000 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.3; 2-fold; figure 2).
In Wisconsin, on the gathering day the hospitalization rate was 0.8/100,000
(95% confidence interval 0.7 to 0.9). By day 21 the hospitalization rate
increased to 1.8/100,000 (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 2; 2.3-fold; figure 2).
In states without mass gatherings, on the comparison day the hospitalization rate
was 0.6/100,000 (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 0.8). By day 21 the
hospitalization rate increased to 0.8/100,000 (95% confidence interval 0.5 to
1.1; 1.3-fold; figure 2).

Discussion: Our analysis showed that mass gatherings were followed by an
increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations on the county and state levels. The
gatherings occurred in late September, and during this period the
hospitalizations in states without a mass gathering did not increase significantly.
Our main limitation is that both Wisconsin and Minnesota had mass gatherings
a month before the analyzed gatherings, which could have caused a second
wave of infection that would affect their hospitalizations a month later.
Minnesota also had a mass gathering two weeks after the analyzed mass
gatherings, which could explain why its rate started rising again in early
October.
Our findings suggest that precautions such as masks, should be taken in mass
gatherings such as political rallies, large school assemblies and cultural events,

to reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations.[7] Since these precautions are often not
taken by participants of the gatherings, there is also a need for the state’s policy
makers to increase public health measures such as social distancing and face
masks wearing in the geographic area close to where the rally takes place.[8]
Also, it is advised to prepare the healthcare infrastructures (including the
hospitals) to prepare for the possible increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations.[9]
