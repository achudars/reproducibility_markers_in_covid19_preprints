ABSTRACT
Background
Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been
increasing demand to identify predictors of severe clinical course in patients infected with severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human leukocyte antigen alleles
(HLA) have been suggested as potential genetic host factors. We sought to evaluate this
hypothesis by conducting an international multicenter study using HLA sequencing with
subsequent independent validation.

Methods
We analyzed a total of 332 samples. First, we enrolled 233 patients in Germany, Spain, and
Switzerland for HLA and whole exome sequencing. Furthermore, we validated our results in a
public data set (United States, n=99). Patients older than 18 years presenting with COVID-19
were included, representing the full spectrum of the disease. HLA candidate alleles were
identified in the derivation cohort (n=92) and tested in two independent validation cohorts
(n=240).

Results
We identified HLA-C* 04:01 as a novel genetic predictor for severe clinical course in COVID-19.
Carriers of HLA-C* 04:01 had twice the risk of intubation when infected with SARS-CoV-2
(hazard ratio 2.1, adjusted p-value=0.0036).

Importantly, these findings were successfully

replicated in an independent data set. Furthermore, our findings are biologically plausible, as
HLA-C* 04:01 has fewer predicted bindings sites with relevant SARS-CoV-2 peptides as
compared to other HLA alleles. Exome sequencing confirmed findings from HLA analysis.

Conclusions
HLA-C* 04:01 carriage is associated with a twofold increased risk of intubation in patients
infected with SARS-CoV-2. Testing for HLA-C* 04:01 could have clinical implications to identify
high-risk patients and individualize management.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan,
China, at the end of 20191,2. It rapidly spread to Europe, the United States, and the rest of the
world, manifesting as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)3,4.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, a striking clinical spectrum has been described among
patients with COVID-19. Some patients remain asymptomatic, others may become “super
spreaders” or “super emitters5, while yet others have a severe clinical course leading to
respiratory or multiorgan failure with potentially lethal outcome 6. Various clinical risk factors for
severe clinical course have been described such as age, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity4,6.
On the genomic level, it has been suggested that blood groups7,8, as well as genes involved in
antiviral defense mechanisms and inflammatory organ damage, may affect clinical outcomes9.
In addition to blood groups, the HLA system plays a crucial role in immune response10,11.
Genetic polymorphisms of HLA have been reported to affect the clinical course of patients
infected with various ribonucleic acid viruses (e.g. H1N1 12, Hantaan virus13, and SARS-CoV114).
Therefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that specific HLA alleles predispose patients to a
severe clinical course in COVID-19. Severe clinical course was defined as acute respiratory
failure, requirement for intensive care, or death. In addition, we sought to evaluate if specific
HLA alleles predispose patients to acute cardiac injury.
Data from the SARS-CoV pandemic suggest that this was a plausible hypothesis. HLA-B* 46:01
has been shown to be associated with a severe clinical course in patients infected with SARSCoV.

Furthermore, a recent in silico analysis of HLA data from an international database

suggested that HLA-B* 46:01 appears to predispose patients to a more severe clinical course of

SARS-CoV-215, similar to that found in actual clinical samples from patients with SARS-CoV-114.
While HLA-B* 46:01 frequency is 17% in Asia, where these data were obtained, the allele
frequency is 0.05% in Germany and <0.01% in Spain, where the largest part of our study was
conducted (http://www.allelefrequencies.net)16. Therefore, we suspected that if an HLA risk
allele was identified, it would differ from the one discovered during the SARS-CoV pandemic in
Asia.
To test our hypothesis, we collected blood samples from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 for
HLA sequencing during the first peak of the European COVID-19 pandemic. Enrollment centers
included hospitals in Germany, Switzerland, and Spain. Furthermore, we leveraged the extant
RNA-Seq data sets available from the Gene Expression Omnibus, which contained samples
from the United States to validate our findings.

METHODS
Study participants and recruitment
We recruited a total of 233 patients with mild to severe symptoms of COVID-19 for HLA
sequencing analysis. In addition, we validated our findings in data from a public data set
containing RNA sequencing data for a total of 99 patients with COVID-19 containing phenotypic

nasopharyngeal swabs and/or detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in the blood through
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sample collection took place during the first
peak of the pandemic at five European Hospitals: Germany: Charite Universitätsmedizin Berlin
(3 sites, total 92 patients, data set 1, DS1)18,19; Spain: Hospital Universitario de Valme, Sevilla
(total 120 patients) and Switzerland: Kantonsspital Baden AG, Baden (total 21 patients, data set
2, DS2). All patients with COVID-19, who provided informed consent and were 18 years or older
were included.

Whole-blood samples, buffy coats, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells

(PBMCs) were collected from all patients for DNA extraction during routine diagnostic
venipuncture. In addition to clinical and laboratory data, we had access to first measured viral
load data for the cohort from Germany (obtained by RT-PCR)20.
We used requirement for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, or death as well as a
combined endpoint of all three outcomes as categories for HLA analysis.
We used the standard reference range for troponin T hs (<14ng/l) to define troponin elevation.
Acute cardiac injury was defined as elevation of troponin T hs (>14ng/l) without obvious signs
for acute coronary syndrome. Furthermore, we directly used the troponin T hs levels to test for
association. Troponin T hs levels were available for 66 patients.

Ethics committee approval
Our protocol included blood samples obtained during routine clinically indicated venipunctures,
which were then frozen at -80°C for subsequent deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction and
sequencing. A minimal set of deidentified clinical data was collected to protect data privacy. At
Charite Universitätsmedizin Berlin procedures were performed within the framework of the PaCOVID-19 protocol18.

Given the exceptional situation of the pandemic and the international character of this study,
there were differences amongst local ethics committees in consent procedures7. At each center,
written informed consent was obtained from patients when possible, sometimes retrospectively
if the patient was not able to give consent at the moment of sample collection.
This study was approved by the ethics committee of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin,
Germany (EA2/066/20), the Ethikkommission Nordwest- und Zentralschweiz, Basel, Switzerland
(2020-00952), and the Ethics Committee of the Hospital Universitario de Valme, Sevilla Spain
(1346-N-16).
Data sets differ in the depth of clinical annotation and sites used different criteria, e.g. for
admitting patients to the ICU.

DNA extraction, HLA sequencing, and quality control
DNA extraction
DNA was extracted either manually using the Quick-DNA™ Miniprep Plus Kit (Zymogen, number
D4068) or automatically on a Roche LC2 robot according to the manufacturer’s instructions. On
the robot The MagNA Pure LC DNA Isolation Kit - Large Volume (Roche, number 03310515001)
was used. DNA concentration was measured using either Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher) for the
Zymogen extracted samples and Qubit™ dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher, number
Q32851) for robot-extracted samples.

HLA typing by PacBio SMRT sequencing, PCR Amplification of Full-Length HLA Genes
Aliquots of patient genomic DNA samples were diluted to the same concentrations in 96-well
plates. To meet the challenges of a high-throughput project, further pipetting steps were
performed with multichannel pipettes or on the epMotion 5075 pipetting robot (Eppendorf).
For each patient sample, eleven HLA genes were amplified using NGSgo®-AmpX v2
HLAGeneSuite kit (#7371662, GenDx). According to the design of this protocol, amplicons cover
all class I HLA genes (HLA-A, -B, -C) and the most relevant parts of the class II HLA genes
(HLA-DRB* 1, -DRB* 3/4/5, -DQB* 1, -DPA* 1, -DPB* 1, -DQA* 1), which have very long introns.
Amplification

was

performed

according

to

the

manufacturer’s

instructions

(https://www.gendx.com/product_line/ngsgo-ampx-v2). To improve PCR efficiency, the starting
amount of template DNA was increased from 45ng to 80ng per reaction for loci HLA-DRB* 1, DQB* 1, -DPA* 1, -DPB* 1 and –DQA* 1. In addition, elongation time for HLA-DQA* 1 was
extended to 5min. Nevertheless, assay performance differed between the loci. Amplification was
typically unproblematic for HLA-A, -B, -C, and DQA1 genes and less consistent in terms of output
for other loci.
Amplicons were purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (#A63881, Beckman Coulter). Quality
and quantity of purified PCR amplicons were checked using D5000 Screen Tape assay (#50675593, Agilent) on TapeStation (Agilent) and Qubit dsDNA assay kit (#33120, Thermofisher) on
FLUOStar Omega microplate reader (BMG Labtech), respectively. Confirmed amplicons were
equimolar combined into two– for HLA class I and HLA class II –
pools per patient.

HLA SMRTbell Library Preparation and Sequencing
Single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing libraries were prepared according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Procedure & Checklist -Preparing SMRTbell™ Libraries using PacBio®
Barcoded Adapters for Multiplex SMRT® Sequencing PacBio®)21. Barcoded Adapters were used to

label patient amplicon pools. Up to 72 amplicon pools were combined per HLA class I and HLA
class II libraries. Libraries were validated using 12000 DNA Assay (#50697-1508, Agilent) on
Agilent Bioanalyzer and quantified using Qubit dsDNA assay on Qubit Fluorometer.

Libraries were loaded on SMRT cells and sequenced on Sequel instrument (Pacific Biosciences)
using 10h / SMRT Cell 1M sequencing runtime. Loading setup and run design was planned with
SMRTLink v9.0 (https://www.pacb.com/wp-content/uploads/Quick-Reference-Card-Loading-and-PreExtension-Recommendations-for-the-Sequel-System.pdf). In total, HLA genes amplicons for 229

patients were sequenced on 12 SMRT cells.

Circular consensus sequence (CCS) data analysis and demultiplexing was performed within
SMRT Link 9.0.0.92188 GUI.

Validation with RNA-Seq data (data set 3, DS 3)
Publicly available data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO identifier
GSE157103) and analyzed using the arcasHLA package, version 0.2.021.
Ulitmately, correlation analysis was performed to compare HLA allele frequencies between all
three data sets.

Exome sequencing
Genomic DNAs were quantified by Quant-iT™ dsDNA Assay Kit, broad range (ThermoFisher
Scientific) with a FLUOStar Omega microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Illumina-compatible
libraries were prepared on a Bravo NGS Workstation Option B according to the manual KAPA
HyperPrep/HyperPlus Automated Workflow for Agilent Bravo B NGS Instructions for Use, v3.0
(Roche Sequencing) using the KAPA Hyper Plus workflow with the reagents included in the
KAPA Hyper Plus kit (Roche Sequencing). In short, 100 ng of genomic DNA was fragmented at
37°C in an Eppendorf Mastercycler Plus S for 25 minutes with subsequent end repair. Following
end repair, fragments were ligated to the KAPA Universal Adapter (Roche Sequencing) and
purified by KAPA HyperPure Beads (Roche Sequencing). Purified libraries were amplified by 6
cycles of PCR utilizing the KAPA UDI Primer Mix* (Roche Sequencing) and again purified using
KAPA HyperPure Beads*. Amplified sample library concentration and size distribution was
determined by Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) with a Qubit™ 3 Fluorometer
(ThermoFisher Scientific) and D5000 ScreenTape assay (Agilent Technologies) with a 4200
TapeStation system (Agilent Technologies). Eight amplified sample libraries were pooled prior
to enrichment. For this purpose, 187,5 ng of each library was pooled into one well and the final
volume was adjusted to 45 µl with nuclease-free water as designated by the manual KAPA
HyperCap Workflow v3.0 (https://pim-eservices.roche.com/eLD/web/pi/en/home) and all further
steps were performed following the recommendations of that manual.
These included hybridization of the amplified sample library pool to KAPA HyperExome Probes
(Roche Sequencing) washing and recovery of the captured multiplex sample library, as well as
amplification and purification of the enriched multiplex sample library. Final library pools were
quantified by Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit with a Qubit™ 3 Fluorometer and correct size

distribution was validated by High Sensitivity D5000 ScreenTape assay (Agilent Technologies)
with a 4200 TapeStation system. A total of 12 multiplex enriched sample libraries were pooled
equimolar utilizing the NextGen HyperCap Pooling Guide and Calculator template (Roche
Sequencing) and diluted to 1.3 nM. Each final pool was sequenced on two lanes of an S4
FlowCell (Illumina, Inc.) for 2x 151 cycles on a NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina, Inc.)

Exome analysis
Exome data was aligned using BWA-MEM to the reference GRCh37 (hs357d.fa). Samples were
identified as being KIR2DS4f positive by screening the GATK HaplotypeCaller v3.7 22 variant
calls for presence of an insertion of CCCGGAGCTCCTATGACATGTA in exon 4 of KIR2DS4.
For a more detailed description of the analysis please see methods in the data supplement.

Statistical analysis

Composite disease score
DS1 consisted of patients of the Charite cohort. For patients in DS1, we defined a composite
score, including troponin T hs levels, death, ICU and intubation status (binned in five categories).
Then, we used multiple correspondence analysis (MCA; R package FactoMineR23, v. 2.3) to
obtain a score derived from the selected variables, defined as the first dimension of the individual
coordinates.

HLA association testing
Dominant model of association with the selected response variables was tested using Fisher’s
exact test (for categorical variables) or t-test (for continuous variables). The logarithm of
Troponin T hs levels was used for the association test. In the analysis, we only considered alleles
with a frequency in the given data set above 5% and with at least 5 individual carriers of the
allele present. Other alleles were retained for the purpose of association testing, but not directly
evaluated for association. The response variables differed between the three data sets analyzed.
DS 1 (Berlin) included the following continuous variables: Troponin T hs, maximum WHO ordinal
scale for clinical improvement score, maximum troponin T hs levels, and viral load, as well as
categorical: Troponin T hs elevation above 14ng/l, ICU and intubation status, and death. For
Data Sets 2 and 3 (Switzerland/Spain and US, respectively; DS 2 and 3) we tested for
association with ICU and intubation status (categorical). To calculate the effect size, we have
used Cramer’s v for categorical variables and Cohen’s d for continuous variables.

Randomization test
To obtain an empirical p-value of our selection / validation process, we have used a
randomization test. We replicated the process 10,000 times, each time randomly assigning the
real genotypes within a given data set to the patient identifiers. Then, for each allele, we
calculated how many times the best p-values obtained in each of the three data set for
associations with the different response variables within the randomization test are all lower than
the p-values obtained with the non-randomized data set. The p-values obtained with
randomization test were then recalculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control
for false discovery rate (FDR)24.

Genetic structure of DS1 and DS2
To test presence of subpopulations in DS1 and DS2, we leveraged exome derived variants. We
used the R package SNPrelate, version 1.2.1, to process the VCF file and perform a principal
components analysis. Next, we tested whether any of the principal components were associated
with either intubation or ICU status or with the presence / absence of the identified risk allele.

RESULTS

Patients
Descriptive data on age, sex, intensive care management, maximum respiratory support during
hospitalization and relevant comorbidities (hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes) of
patients included in the primary and second data set are illustrated in table 1.
The median age was similar in the derivation cohort (DS1) and the two validation cohorts (DS 2
and 3), ranging from 57 to 61 years. The Spanish cohort consisted of more women (63%) than
the German (33%) and the Swiss (24%) cohorts. In the Spanish cohort the prevalence of
hypertension and diabetes was lower and patients were less likely to get intubated.
The genetic structures of DS1 and DS2 showed no indication of existing subpopulations based
on principal component analysis of variants derived from whole exome sequencing data. None
of the components was significantly associated with ICU or intubation status, even though few
individuals were of different genetic background.

Stepwise analysis of HLA associations
Given the relatively small, but well-annotated DS1, we decided on a step-wise validation
approach (Figure 1). In essence, we used DS1 as a discovery cohort to propose candidate
alleles which then were validated using DS 2 (Switzerland/Spain) and DS 3 (United States).
Calculation of overall associations on a combined data set of all three cohorts (see
Supplementary table 1) is prone to discovery of false positives, due to varying allele frequencies
and percentages of apparently severe disease cases in the three data sets. To avoid this, as
well as other potentially incorrect assumptions regarding variable distribution, we decided to test
the obtained results using a randomization approach. In short, we repeated the whole selection
/ validation procedure 10,000 times, each time randomly assigning the obtained HLA genotypes
to patients (separately in each cohort) and used the smallest p-values for associations in each
data set as our test statistics. Such a randomization test allowed us to estimate how often the
obtained combination of p-values from discovery and validation cohort occurs when there is no
real association between alleles and response variables.

Candidate alleles from DS1
For selecting candidates, we defined a cutoff allele frequency of >5% and a minimum number of
carriers (5) in the study population to ensure the relevance of the potential findings. Next, we
tested the associations of the remaining alleles in DS1 after filtering with each of the proposed
response variables considered to be proxies of disease severity: ICU and intubation status,
troponin T hs levels, maximum WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement score and a
composite score. We selected alleles as candidate alleles, if they showed at least one
association at p < 0.05 (not adjusted for multiple testing). We found 16 significant associations

of 11 alleles (Figure 2; Supplemental Table 2); the association between allele HLA C*03:03 and
the composite score was significant after correcting for FDR.
Overall, the most frequent significant (p < 0.05) associations were with maximum WHO ordinal
scale for clinical improvement score, intubation status, and troponin, while there were only two
associations with ICU status and one with composite score.
Several of the test results indicated that the allele candidates were associated with greater
disease severity. For example, while on average one third of the patients were intubated, 15 out
of the 21 patients who carried the HLA-C* 04:01 allele were intubated. However, there were
also alleles associated with milder disease course. The type II allele DQA1 *05:01 (present in
10 patients) was associated with lower troponin T hs levels; the common type I allele HLA-A*
01:01 (present in 25 patients) was weakly associated with lower WHO ordinal scale for clinical
improvement score and lower fraction of intubated patients (24 vs 49%).

Validation in DS 2 and DS 3
For DS 2 and DS 3, two response variables were generally available for all samples: ICU and
intubation status. We therefore tested the association with ICU and intubation status for all
candidate alleles. Furthermore, we tested association with troponin T hs levels in the Swiss
cohort in DS2, for which this information was available. To determine whether a confirmation in
one or both of DS2 and DS3 truly validates the allele candidates from DS1, we have used a
randomization test, in which the selection/validation procedure was mimicked using resampled
genotypes.

In DS2, there was a significant (at FDR < 0.05) association between the allele HLA-DRB1* 11:04
and intubation status. Notably, amongst the 137 patients of DS 2, only 13 were treated in an ICU
and 10 were intubated. Out of the 10 patients who were intubated, three were carrying the HLADRB1* 11:04 allele. This association was not confirmed by the randomization test. In DS3, the
only significant associations were between the allele HLA- C* 04:01 and both ICU and intubation
status (Figure 3; Supplemental Figure 1). The p-value obtained from the randomization test for
this allele was < 0.004 after correcting for FDR (Supplemental Table 3), even though no
association between HLA-C*04:01 could be detected in DS 2.
Finally, correlation analysis of allele frequencies overall revealed that HLA alleles had
comparable frequencies between Germany, Switzerland, Spain, and the United States
(Supplemental Figure 2).

Association of alleles with viral load
For DS1, first measured viral load data were available. Notably, measured viral load was not
associated with severity of symptoms such as ICU/intubation status or troponine levels
(Supplemental Figure 3, Supplemental Table 1).

There were five significant associations of

initial viral load with HLA alleles at p<0.05, none of which were significant after correction for
false discovery rate. The HLA-C* 04:01 allele was not significantly associated viral load. Given
that viral load was not associated with disease severity in DS1 and that viral load data were not
available for DS2 or DS3, we did not attempt to confirm whether the lack of association between
HLA and viral load in DS1 was mirrored in the two other datasets.

Association between HLAs and other covariates in DS 1
One possible explanation of the association between HLA alleles and COVID-19 severity is that
these alleles occur at different frequencies in different risk groups. Therefore, we sought to
evaluate if HLA-C* 04:01 occurs with higher frequency amongst older patients, who are at
greater risk of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19. Indeed, patients who were intubated
or admitted to the ICU were older overall (p-values from a two-sided t-test, were 0.003 and 0.014,
respectively). However, HLA-C* 04:01 had an overall frequency of 0.12 and 0.14 in patients
younger than 65 and a lower frequency, 0.067, in the high-risk group of patients older than 75
years.
To exclude other potential confounding effects, we tested the associations of all alleles in DS 1
with the covariates gender, age, weight, and body mass index (BMI). While there were
seven alleles which showed a significant association at p < 0.05 (Supplemental Table 5), no
association was significant after correction for multiple testing.
Furthermore, we tested if HLA-C* 04:01 is associated with higher CRP levels as a surrogate for
systemic inflammation. However, there was only a trend that was not significant (Supplemental
Figure 4). CRP correlated with the risk of intubation.

Affinity analysis
A possible explanation for the effect of an allele on disease severity might be abnormal binding
affinity to SARS-CoV-2 peptides. To test that hypothesis, we used a previously described data
set of putative (computed in silico) binding affinities.15 Following an approach described by

20

Iturrieta-Zuazo and colleagues25, we calculated the number of SARS-CoV-2 peptides, which
bind either “tightly” (at < 50 mM) or “loosely” (at < 500 mM) for each allele. Using this approach,
we discovered that HLA C*04:01 is among the ten alleles with the fewest predicted binding
SARS-CoV-2 peptides (Figure 4). Therefore, we sought to systematically test the hypothesis
that the putative affinity to SARS-CoV-2 peptides is a correlate of disease severity. First, for
each of the response variables (ICU and intubation status, troponin T hs levels, composite score)
we tested whether the effect size is correlated with the number of potentially-binding peptides.
We included all alleles (not filtered for frequency) in this comparison. While in all data sets
combined there were no large effects in alleles with many potential binding peptides, negative
correlation was only significant in DS3 (Spearman test, p < 0.007, 𝜌=0.27).
Next, for each patient, we calculated how many SARS-CoV-2 peptides can the type I alleles in
that patient potentially bind, and tested whether there is an association between disease severity
(using troponin T hs levels, intubation and ICU status and composite score as proxies) and that
number. However, none of these tests showed a significant association.

Exome sequencing data
Since polymorphisms in the KIR2DS4 gene in combination with the HLA*C 04:01 allele have
been reported to increase viral load and lead to severe clinical course in patients with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)26, we evaluated if presence of the KIR2DS4f variant was
associated with our outcome variables (e.g. viral load, intubation).

However, no association

was identified. A combination of a KIR2DS4f variant with HLA*C 04:01 was identified in only
four patients, of which only one was homozygous at the KIR2DS4 locus. This patient had a

severe clinical course, was intubated, and had highly elevated troponin T hs and maximum WHO
ordinal scale for clinical improvement score.

DISCUSSION
In the beginning of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe in spring 2020, an
international collaboration of European centers was established to address the question,
whether there were potential genetic host factors associated with severe clinical course in
SARS-CoV-2. Samples were collected in Spain, Switzerland, and Germany18 and subsequently
processed in Germany for full-length sequencing of HLA genes in DNA samples.
We identified HLA-C* 04:01 as the most relevant risk allele, which was associated with a twofold
risk of intubation when present in the form of at least one allele.
Importantly these findings were reproduced in an independent public data set obtained from
patients

Center,

using

RNA

sequencing17. Using this approach, we demonstrated broad applicability of our findings and
confirmed reproducibility and robustness of our results in data gathered through a distinct
method – the analysis of the transcriptome27.

This is particularly relevant in the context of

regional differences in allele frequencies28,29. In that regard, HLA-B* 46:01 was shown to be
associated with severe clinical course in SARS-CoV in Asia14. However, this allele is very rare
in Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the United States16. In line with that, HLA-B* 46:01 was not
represented in our European data set. In a correlation analysis we demonstrated that the
frequencies of most alleles of the German cohort were similar to those in the cohorts from
Switzerland, Spain, and the United States.

After completing our stepwise analysis of data sets, final randomization and multiple
comparisons of all three data sets confirmed that HLA-C* 04:01 was strongly associated with
requirement of intubation. While this allele was not found to be significantly associated with
disease severity in DS2, this data set included only a small number of patients with severe
clinical course (13/133 patients treated at the ICU; 10/133 intubated, figure 3). Therefore,
detecting an existing association of HLA-C*04:01 was unlikely due to low statistical power,
considering the observed effect size and allele frequency. Nonetheless, the combined effects
observed in DS1 and DS3 were sufficient to reach a robust conclusion during randomization.
Another factor in which DS 2 differed from DS1, in particular the Spanish population, was that it
consisted of a larger percentage of women (63% in Spain vs 33% in Germany). Importantly,
DS2 was a representative sample of patients in Sevilla, where our recruiting center collected
samples consecutively at the peak of the pandemic and by now has seen a similar proportion of
women (60%) in all patients, who have been recruited since then (n=842). While our analysis
did not reveal any association of specific HLA alleles with sex (supplemental table 5), it has been
shown that female sex is associated with better outcomes30. This effect of sex may have masked
the effect of HLA-C*04-01 validation in DS 2. Future research is necessary to investigate this
hypothesis.
In addition to the strong and robust association of HLA-C* 04:01 and intubation with a hazard
ratio of 2.1, there is also evidence in the literature suggesting a potential biological role of HLAC* 04:01 in the defense of viral infections. In that regard, it has been shown that in patients
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HLA-C* 04:01 in combination with
polymorphisms in the KIR2DS4 gene was associated with high viral titers and severe clinical

course26. Moreover, HLA-C* 04:01 has been reported to occur at a higher frequency in COVID19 patients than in the healthy population31.
The allele frequency of HLA-C* 04:01 is approximately 13% in Germany overall and 19% in
German residents of Turkish origin16, suggesting that the presented findings may impact a
relevant fraction of the German population. Similar numbers are found in Switzerland, where
the allele frequency is about 16% and Spain, where an allele frequency of 15% has been
reported16.
On the broader scale, it is notable that the highest allele frequencies of HLA-C* 04:01 worldwide
have been observed in Oaxaca, Mexico (38%); Baloch, Iran (29%); Australian Aborigines (28%);
and African Americans (21%), while countries such as Japan and South Africa have very low
frequency (4% each)16. While socioeconomic and classical risk factors, such as population age
and comorbidities, are most likely the strongest predictors for severe clinical outcomes in
patients with COVID-19, our data raise speculation that disease severity may be exacerbated
in populations with high HLA-C* 04:01 frequency.
Since HLA-C* 04:01 is associated with viral load in HIV, we sought to evaluate if this was true
for Sars-CoV-2. We did not find any association of HLA-C* 04:01 with first measured viral load
of patients during their hospitalization. In addition, the first measured viral load in intubated
patients did not differ from patients with mild disease. We support the common hypothesis that
by the time the patients present with severe respiratory failure, the virus may have been already
partially cleared from the body in some of them and the disease may be maintained through
inflammatory or autoimmune mechanisms similar to other viral respiratory illnesses.32 The
dynamics of viral load in SARS-CoV 2 have been reported comprehensively in the

literature20,33,34. It may be beneficial to test for HLA-C* 04:01 in clinical trials to identify from
which drug class this high-risk population benefits most.
It is also possible that viral load of patients with HLA-C* 04:01 may have been higher during the
very first days of infection35, but since most patients only become symptomatic after
approximately a week36,37, this time window may have been missed in some patients of our
cohort to see a potential relationship of HLA-C* 04:01 and viral loads measured during early
infection.

In general, there was no association of any specific HLA allele with first measured

viral load in our cohort.
Exome sequencing revealed a combination of a KIR2DS4f variant with HLA*C 04:01 in only four
patients. One of those patients was homozygous at the KIR2DS4 locus and had a severe clinical
course. While these findings are interesting, the sample sizes of these subgroups are too small
to draw any conclusions.
Notably, HLA affinity analysis revealed that HLA-C* 04:01 binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2
peptides was amongst the ten lowest HLA alleles. The effect size for the association between
the allele and intubation status was strong. Delayed immune response due to low HLA binding
affinity may be one potential biological explanation for the severe clinical course observed in
patients with HLA-C* 04:01.
Alternatively, HLA-C* 04:01 may have led to worse outcomes by predisposing patients to a
cytokine storm. To test that, we evaluated for a potential association of HLA-C* 04:01 with CRP
serum levels as a surrogate for cytokine storm. Indeed there was a trend of higher CRP levels
in HLA-C* 04:01, albeit this finding was not significant. CRP correlated with the risk of intubation,
as shown in prior studies38,39.

HLA-DQA1* 05:01, HLA-B* 08:01, and HLA DPB* 02:01 were associated with higher troponin T
hs levels in DS1. However, this effect was not reproduced in the final validation in DS2 and
DS3.
A major strength of this study was the execution of full-length sequencing of HLA alleles, as
phasing of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is frequently not feasible with the short
reads typically used in full genome sequencing40. In that regard, any two alleles that differ only
at regions that are further apart than the longest read length of the method used cannot be
phased, resulting in ambiguity of HLA typing or miscalled alleles40. In addition, certain HLA
regions, in particular structural variants and insertions, can only be covered with long reads as
used in this study. We have confirmed findings from HLA full-length sequencing with HLA calls
derived data from full exome sequencing data.
Our study is an important addition to prior HLA research in the field of COVID-19 that provided
cumulative evidence for a potential predisposing susceptibility of HLA alleles for infection with
COVID-19. It has been previously shown that specific HLA alleles were more common in
patients infected with COVID-19 as compared to healthy individuals (e.g. HLA-DRB1* 15:01,
HLA-DQB1* 06:02, HLA-DRB1*08, HLA-C*04:01) and it was extrapolated that these alleles may
predispose to infection31,41-43. It is not surprising that some of these alleles differed from ours,
as we identified a genetic predictor specifically for severe clinical course amongst patients with
COVID-19, while other groups compared healthy vs diseased.

A recent genome wide

association study (GWAS) identified blood group A as a major risk factor for COVID-19, but did
not detect associations of the classical HLA loci with either COVID-19 infection or disease
severity7. This study used target short read sequencing of HLA regions for a sub-cohort and
investigated association with HLA C:04 only on a 2-digit rather than on the 4-digit level used in

this study. Both factors may contribute to a reduced power that made it impossible to detect the
association that our approach finds supported in three data sets from different studies and in
different populations.
In addition to host factors, it has been shown that genetic factors of the virus may affect affinity
of host HLA to viral structures. In that regard, de Sousa and colleagues have shown that a single
mutation in the wild type sequence of SARS-CoV-2 could affect peptide binding of the virus to
HLA Class II alleles44.

In summary, we applied full-length HLA sequencing to patients with COVID-19 to enable
identification of HLA alleles with high precision in a large international data set and validated our
findings successfully in an entirely independent cohort.

We used analysis of clinical and

laboratory parameters, viral load data, and whole exome sequencing to evaluate for biological
plausibility.
A limitation of this study was that in order to promptly respond to the COVID-19 pandemic with
an international multi-center study, even patients with limited metadata were enrolled in this
study. However, risk factors and clinical outcomes that we considered most relevant based on
prior literature were collected and analyzed for all patients included in our cohorts.
Reproducibility of our data in an entirely independent cohort in Albany, United States supports
the robustness of our data despite this limitation.

DATA SUPPLEMENT
SUPPLEMENTAL METHODS

Primary Exome Data Analysis
Exome base call data was converted to FASTQ using bcl2fastq v2.20.0.422. Reads were aligned
using BWA-MEM v0.7.1545 to the reference GRCh37 (hs37d5.fa), separate read groups were
assigned for all reads from one lane, and duplicates were masked using Samblaster v0.1.24.46
Standard QC was performed using FastQC.47 The variants were then called using GATK
HaplotypeCaller v3.7.22

Secondary Exome Data Analysis: HLA Typing
Exome data was analyzed using OptiType v1.3.5.48

Secondary Exome Data Analysis: KIR2DS4f Typing
Unlike HLA, no ready-made bioinformatics tool is available for accurately haplotyping the genes
in the KIR family, only KPI49, which requires whole genome sequencing data. We thus limited
the analysis of the functional variant of KIR2DS450 being present (KIR2DS4f+) in the data as
follows: The non-functional variant is the major allele of KIR2DS4 that is present in the human
reference

GRCh37.

KIR2DS4f

positive

samples

thus

show

an

insertion

of

CCCGGAGCTCCTATGACATGTA in exon 4 of KIR2DS4 (dbSNP rs138504928). Therefore, we
screened the variant calling results for this variant being present in the data and used the
genotype called by GATK HaplotypeCaller for subsequent analysis (0/0 = KIR2DS4f negative,
0/1 = KIR2DS4f het. positive, 1/1 = KIR2DS4f hom. positive).

Supplemental Figure 4 Evaluation for correlation of HLA* C 04:01 status with CRP serum levels. There
was a trend of higher CRP levels in patients with HLA* C 04:01. However, these findings were not
significant. CRP correlated with the risk of intubation.
