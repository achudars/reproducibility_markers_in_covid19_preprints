We model the evolution of the number of individuals that are reported to be sick
with COVID-19 in Germany. Our theoretical framework builds on a continuous
time Markov chain with four states: healthy without infection, sick, healthy after
recovery or after infection but without symptoms and dead. Our quantitative solution matches the number of sick individuals up to the most recent observation
and ends with a share of sick individuals following from infection rates and sickness
probabilities. We employ this framework to study inter alia the expected peak of
the number of sick individuals in a scenario without public regulation of social contacts. We also study the e¤ects of public regulations. For all scenarios we report
the expected end of the CoV-2 epidemic.
We have four general …ndings: First, current epidemiological thinking implies that
the long-run e¤ects of the epidemic only depend on the aggregate long-run infection
rate and on the individual risk to turn sick after an infection. Any measures by
individuals and the public therefore only in‡uence the dynamics of spread of CoV2. Second, predictions about the duration and level of the epidemic must strongly
distinguish between the o¢ cially reported numbers (Robert Koch Institut, RKI)
and actual numbers of sick individuals. Third, given the current (scarce) medical
knowledge about long-run infection rate and individual risks to turn sick, any prediction on the length (duration in months) and strength (e.g. maximum numbers of
sick individuals on a given day) is subject to a lot of uncertainty. Our predictions
therefore o¤er robustness analyses that provide ranges on how long the epidemic
will last and how strong it will be. Fourth, public interventions that are already
in place and that are being discussed can lead to more and less severe outcomes of
the epidemic. If an intervention takes place too early, the epidemic can actually be
stronger than with an intervention that starts later. Interventions should therefore
be contingent on current infection rates in regions or countries.
Concerning predictions about COVID-19 in Germany, we …nd that the long-run
number of sick individuals (that are reported to the RKI), once the epidemic is

over, will lie between 500 thousand and 5 million individuals. While this seems to
be an absurd large range for a precise projection, this re‡ects the uncertainty about
the long-run infection rate in Germany. If we assume that Germany will follow the
good scenario of Hubei (and we are even a bit more conservative given discussions
about data quality), we will end up with 500 thousand sick individuals over the
entire epidemic. If by contrast we believe (as many argue) that once the epidemic is
over 70% of the population will have been infected (and thereby immune), we will
end up at 5 million cases.
De…ning the end of the epidemic by less than 100 newly reported sick individuals
per day, we …nd a large variation depending on the e¤ectiveness of governmental
pleas and regulations to reduce social contacts. An epidemic that is not in‡uenced
by public health measures would end mid June 2020. With public health measures
lasting for few weeks, the end is delayed by around one month or two. The advantage of the delay, however, is to reduce the peak number of individuals that
are simultaneously sick. When we believe in long-run infection rates of 70%, this
number is equally high for all scenarios we went through and well above 1 million.
When we can hope for the Hubei-scenario, the maximum number of sick individuals
will be around 200 thousand “only”.
Whatever value of the range of long-run infection rates we want to assume, the
epidemic will last at least until June, with extensive and potentially future public
health measures, it will last until July. In the worst case, it will last until end of
August.
We emphasize that all projections are subject to uncertainty and permanent monitoring of observed incidences are taken into account to update the projection.

Introduction

There is no need to stress the importance of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) for public
health, economic consequences and well-being of individuals. Yet, there is a need for more
knowledge about objective information and reliable predictions of how the pandemic will likely
evolve in the months to come. How large is the risk of any individual to get infected on a
particular day or within a week? How does this risk change over time? How large is the expected
number of individuals ever infected and how large is the number of individuals infected at any
point in time? The latter question is the main concern of the public, politicians and health
practitioners to ensure su¢ cient provision of health services. Finally, what are the e¤ects of
policy interventions that are already implemented and that are being discussed?
This paper starts by describing what we know quantitatively about the spread of the Corona
epidemic in the Chinese province of Hubei and in South Korea. This o¤ers insights from two
episodes of epidemics that seem to be coming to an end and that help in making predictions
for other countries. We then compare the time-series evidence from Hubei and South Korea
with cross-sectional information in European countries.

Section 3 develops an epidemiological Markov model. We start from individuals that can
be in four states: healthy (the initial state, state 1), infected and sick (state 2), infected and
recovered or infected and never having displayed symptoms (state 3) and dead (state 4). Individuals move between these states with endogenous transition rates that depend on population
characteristics. This model allows to make predictions, inter alia, about all the quantities of
interest that appeared in the questions raised initially.
We apply this model to Germany. We choose parameter values such that the time series of
the number of sick (and reported) individuals in Germany since 24 February is matched by our
model. Our data source is the Robert Koch Institute (RKI, 2020). In order to predict the future
evolution, we build on various evidence from epidemiology like individual sickness probability
and long-run infection rates of the population as a whole. We emphasize the scarce medical and
statistical knowledge on these parameters. Any predictions therefore must be subject to large
variations. We therefore undertake robustness checks with respect to our central parameters.
Given our calibration for the epidemic without public intervention, we predict the number
of sick individuals at each point in time. We compute when the peak will be reached and
whether medical services are in su¢ cient supply. We also undertake counterfactual analysis
to understand when drastic policy measures (like shutting down educational institutions or
canceling big public events) are most e¤ective.
There is an exploding literature on these issues, especially in medical science. The classic large-scale spatial model is described in Balcan et al. (2010). It is applied in Chinazzi et
al. (2020) to study the e¤ect of a travel ban on China and the world. Akbarpour and Jackson
(2018) study a general model of infection, but cannot provide applications to the current epidemic. The widely discussed study by Ferguson et al. (2020) focuses on the US and the UK.2
An insightful study on the usefulness of isolation strategies for COVID-19 based on a stochastic
transition model similar to ours is by Hellewell et al. (2020). Wilder-Smith et al. (2020) discuss
the similarities and di¤erences between the SARS 2003 (severe acute respiratory syndrome)
epidemic and COVID-19. One big issue is the large number of “quiet infections”in COVID-19
as opposed to SARS 2003, an aspect we will capture in our model below.
The analyses which come closest to ours are two notes by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für
Epidemiologie (DGfE, 2020) and by an der Heiden and Buchholz (2020). DGfE (2020) o¤er
predictions based on a model similar to ours (so called SEIR models, see e.g. Anderson et al.,
1992). We present our model in detail, including the stochastic foundation, and discuss the
implications of the modelling assumptions.3 Modelling assumptions turn out to be crucial for
evaluating public policy measures. We also implement in detail the e¤ects of policy measures
and discuss the trade-o¤s with respect to length and strength of the evolution of the epidemic.
The match of the model with the data also di¤ers. While DGfE (2020) seem to use summary
statistics for their calibration, we determine the parameters of our model by …tting our model
predictions to the data. This o¤ers the advantage that we can update our predictions whenever
new data is available.
The study by an der Heiden and Buchholz (2020) is, to the best of our knowledge, the most
elaborate study at this point for Germany. We share their belief that mathematical models
help in studying the e¤ects of policy measures. Many parameters of their analysis are derived
from knowledge on the epidemic in China and especially the city Shenzen. We calibrate many
of our central parameters such that the model …ts the observations in Germany. We also share
with them the approach of using SEIR models. Our paper emphasises the implications of the

There are also various internet pages that o¤er projections for parameter models that can be chosen by

approach is therefore di¢ cult.

fundamental model assumptions for the prediction. We …nd below that the evaluation of policy
measures crucially depends on these model assumptions. We make these model assumptions
explicit in our paper and discuss the e¤ects of variations in these assumptions.
Why should economists work on an epidemic? The economic costs of COVID-19 are huge
and seem to be larger than those of the …nancial crisis starting in 2007.4 This paper provides
a model that allows to understand the spread of the disease. We employ a model in the
tradition of search and matching models originating from Diamond (1982), Mortensen (1982)
and Pissarides (1985). The basic structure of these models (continuous time Markov chains)
is identical to epidemiological models (as becomes clear very quickly when reading overviews
like e.g. Hethcote, 2000). Compared to standard search and matching models, we do allow for
four states, however. We extend the typical matching framework from a technical perspective
by taking the stochastic nature of transitions and their prediction for the probability to be in
various states into account. These probabilities are described by forward Kolmogorov equations.
As we work with a discrete number of states, we obtain an ordinary di¤erential equation
system.5 The conclusion discusses various next steps that should be undertaken to understand
economic consequences of COVID-19 better. We believe that our framework can form the basis
for an understanding of economic costs of the pandemic.

Data

This section describes what we know quantitatively about the spread of reported infections.
We start with Hubei and its capital Wuhan in China. We afterwards look at South Korea and
very brie‡y at Japan. We focus on the evolution of the number of individuals that were ever
reported to be sick during the current epidemic. This number, by construction, can only rise.
We chose Hubei and South Korea as the epidemics seem to come to an end in these countries.
Given the huge uncertainty about long-run infection rates and individual risk to get sick after
an infection with CoV-2, we consider the long-run ratios of sick reported individuals to the
overall population a benchmark that allows us to judge the credibility of our predictions for
Germany. We are aware that we compare very di¤erent countries with very di¤erent cultural
and political habits and medical systems. For reference, we also look at a cross section of
infections for European countries. See the appendix for a description of data sources.6
Hubei
Since the onset of the outbreak in the Hubei province in China, the number of con…rmed
cases has risen dramatically, peaking at 67,801 (WHO Situation Reports, 2020).7 Reporting
began in January 2020 and we note that in mid-February, the WHO changed its classi…cation
methodology by reporting both clinically and lab con…rmed cases rather than only lab con…rmed
cases. In terms of cumulative numbers, the total reported cases of infected individuals rose

Eichenbaum et al. (2020) study the e¤ects of the CoV-2 epidemic on economic decisions of households. They
emphasize the household decisions to reduce labour supply exacerbate the recessionary e¤ects of the epidemic.
They apply their model to the US. Barro et al. (2020) employ mortalities and economic consequences of the
“Spanish Flu” to provide estimates of the world wide consequences of COVID19. They do not o¤er a detailed
projection for Germany. The costs for Germany are estimated by Dorn et al. (2020). Atkeson (2020) provides
esitmates of economic consequences of COVID19 for the US.

When working with continuous states like e.g. wealth or labour income, partial di¤erential equations result.
See e.g. Bayer and Wälde (2010a), Achdou et al. (2020), Kaplan et al. (2018) or Khieu and Wälde (2020).

continuously since January, since there have been continuous in‡uxes of new cases and very
little communication about individuals transitioning back to being healthy.
When reporting began, the ascension of new cases seemed to follow an exponential curve,
with the number of new cases constantly increasing, however in early February, this trend
stopped. Indeed, another trend then took over following a more S-shaped pattern, i.e. that
of a sigmoidal function. The total number of reported cases over time is shown in Figure 1.
The …gure shows a clear explosive trend at the start of the outbreak before slowing down and
approaching what appears to be an asymptote around 70,000.

Figure 1 Total cases in Hubei seem to converge to a constant
To make this comparable to other countries, we take the population of around 59.17 million
individuals in Hubei into account. This implies an infection rate of about 0.11% or 1 person in
873 being infected in the long-run. While this is only one province, it does provide us with a
reference point for what to expect in other regions of the world.

when it comes to infection outbreaks. Indeed, while South Korea has seen the number of con…rmed cases rise to 9,241, Japan only has 1,307 con…rmed cases (or 14% that of South Korea).
The question remains to know whether these countries are also experiencing a convergence to
a stable number of (cumulative) con…rmed cases. Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of
con…rmed cases in South Korea (left) and Japan (right).
The data from South Korea shows a reduction in the slope of the curve for total con…rmed
cases, indicating a signi…cant drop in the number of new infections reported. Assuming the
tendency continues, this would point toward South Korea progressively converging to a constant, similarly to the Hubei province in China. Japan on the other hand (as well as all other
countries at this point) does not appear to slow down signi…cantly. Relating South Korean
infections to population size, we get a long-run infection rate of 1 in 5,337, with a peak number
of con…rmed cases of ca. 9,606.
Europe
In Europe, however, the situation continues to deteriorate, with new cases being reported
by authorities on a daily basis numbering in the thousands (WHO Situation Reports, 2020).
However, bearing in mind the lessons learned from the case of the Hubei province, and to a
lesser extent from the case of South Korea, this current period of explosive growth should, in
theory, be followed by a slow tapering leading to a plateauing of the total number of cases. We
report in Table 1 the current infection rates in some European countries. The sample below
represents 58% of the total EU population, including Norway and Switzerland. This sample is
by no means intended to be representative and is for illustrative purposes only by considering
some of the most a¤ected economies.

Table 1 Current infection rates and risks in a sample of European countries
As we can see from Table 1, the degree of infection per country varies from 1 in 4,050 to
1 in 784, a …vefold ratio. Other countries fare better, the UK for example has a risk of 1 in
6,914, however we can clearly see that these …gures are not yet as low as those in Hubei, with
the exception of Italy and Switzerland, which are now below the 1 in 873 rate observed in the
Chinese province, and Spain, which is approaching it fast. If this case is to be repeated, then
things will likely worsen before they improve. However, with measures taken by governments,
and progress being made on the medical front for an e¤ective vaccine, there is still room for
governments to curb these rates despite the rapid rise in cases.

The model
The structure

The model builds on a continuous time Markov chain with 4 states. We look at health of an
individual i that can be in four states S = f1; 2; 3; 4g. Healthy without infection (s = 1), sick
(s = 2), dead (s = 3), healthy with or after infection (s = 4). State 1 is the initial state for
all individuals, thus si (0) = 1 for all i = 1:::N where N is initial population size.8 There are
individual transition rates rs (with r 2 S and s 2 S) between these states as illustrated in
…gure 3.

Figure 3 Transitions between the state of health (initial state), sickness, death and health
despite infection or after recovery

3.2

Transition rates

Starting with the transition from being healthy to sick, each individual in state 1 has a certain
average number of social contacts per day. We capture this by an exogenous arrival or contact
rate a. Once a contact takes place, there is a certain probability that the contact is with an
individual that can infect the healthy individual. If we assumed random contacts with healthy
and sick individuals, this probability would be (N2 (t) + N4 (t)) = (N1 (t) + N2 (t) + N4 (t)) ;
where Ns (t) is the (expected) number of individuals in state s at t: This probability assumes
that all N2 (t) individuals that are sick can infect healthy individuals and a constant and
exogenous share of healthy individuals in state 4 can also infect healthy individuals from
state 1: This parameter captures the idea of “quiet infections”as emphasized e.g. by WilderSmith et al. (2020). As opposed to SARS 2003 (or the common ‡u), individuals infected with
the CoV-2 do not necessarily display symptoms but can nevertheless infect others. There is
also …rst evidence (Xing et al., 2020) that even recovered individuals (i.e. those that came from
state 2) can carry the CoV-2, also supporting our use of a positive :
In practice, individuals do not encounter sick individuals with this probability being equal
to the share of sick individuals in society as sick individuals might stay at home or behave
di¤erently (not shaking hands or similar) than non-sick individuals. We do assume, however,
that the probability (t) to encounter a sick individual rises in N2 (t) and N4 (t) and falls in
N1 (t) ; i.e. (t) = (N2 (t) ; N4 (t) ; N1 (t)) with @ =@N2 > 0; @ =@ ( N4 ) > 0 and @ =@N1 <

In our quantitative solution below, the initial state follow from the number of reported sick individuals on
24 February 2020.

0:9 These contacts can lead to infections. Hence, we have an individual sickness rate of 12 (t)
a (t) : Finally, when there are N1 (t) healthy individuals, the aggregate ‡ow from state 1 to
state 2 is 12 (t) a (t) N1 (t) :10
A further property an infection rate should re‡ect is the fact emphasized by many virologists
and epidemiologists that once an epidemic is over, around two thirds of the entire population
will be infected. This includes individuals that had symptoms at some point and asymptomatic
cases. We capture this fact by introducing the infection rate which is simply the ratio of the
number of infected individuals (sick and in state 2 or without symptoms in state 4) to individuals
that are alive,
N2 (t) + N4 (t)
:
(1)
(t) =
N1 (t) + N2 (t) + N4 (t)
The infection rate is zero initially at t < 0: Illustrated for Germany in a somewhat too simple
way but perfectly …ne for our projection, = 0 on 23 February 2020 (and before) when the
number of reported sick individuals was zero. On 24 February 2020, a number of N2 (0) = 16
are introduced into the system and infections and sickness start occurring. The sickness rate
12 (t) is zero also in the long-run when this infection rate equals the long-run infection rate,
which we denote by : This captures the above mentioned fact that some individuals will never
be infected during the epidemic and will always remain in state 1, lim t!1 N1 (t) > 0:
Summarizing our discussion, an example for the individual sickness rate that captures insights from epidemiology and virology would be

where 0 < ; ; < 1 allows for some non-linearity in the process and a > 0: The …rst term
N1 (t) captures the idea that more healthy individuals reduce the individual sickness rate.
The second term (N2 (t) + N4 (t)) increases the sickness rate when there are more infectious
individuals. The third term in squared brackets makes sure that the arrival rate is zero when
a share of society is sick (state 2) or healthy after infection (state 4). The sickness rate
satis…es “no sickness without infected individuals”, 12 (a; N1 ; 0; 0; ) = 0 and “end of spread at
su¢ ciently high level”, 12 (a; N1 ; N2 ; N4 ; ) = 0: In between these start- and endpoints, the
infection rate will …rst rise and then fall. This speci…cation makes sure that in the long run a
share of around 1
will not have left state 1; i.e. will never have been infected.11
As is widely documented and reported (see e.g. Nishiura et al., 2020), there is also a ‡ow
of individuals that are infected but do not display any symptoms. We denote this ‡ow by
14 (a; N1 (t) ; N2 (t) ; N4 (t)) and the corresponding individual rate by 14 : The arguments can
be rationalized in the same way as the ‡ows into sickness.
Is it possible to obtain data for 14 ? One would need a cohort of inhabitants of a region
(and not just those that contact medical services to get tested) to understand the share of
individuals that are infected but do not display symptoms. Good data is not available (let alone
time series) and might never be available, given the currently still large costs per individual
tests (between 80 Euro and 120 Euro). We therefore assume that a constant share r of infected
individuals display symptoms. This is a quantity many epidemiologists also work with. Hence,

Individuals that have died no longer play a role in social interactions. Hence, N3 (t) does not appear as
argument in the sickness rate.

A parallel can be drawn between and a matching function, and 12 and the job …nding probability in
search and matching frameworks in the tradition of Diamond (1982), Mortensen (1982) and Pissarides (1985).

We employ “around” as some individuals will have ended up in state 3 whose number does not enter the

Finally, there is an individual mortality rate and a recovery rate. Both rates depend on many
individual characteristics. At the aggregate level, they rise in the stock of sick individuals. We
specify them as 23 (N2 (t)) and 24 (N2 (t)) with corresponding rates 23 and 24 ; respectively.12
For our analysis below, we will assume that both rates are constants. Concerning recovery, we
are aware that it strongly varies across age (e.g. Guan et al., 2020) and that recovery is not
a state that is identical for each individual. As we abstract from ex-ante heterogeneity, we
assume a recovery rate that is identical across individuals and that it takes on average nrec days
until recovery. Given the exponential distribution of duration in each state, this means that
1= 24 = nrec or
1
(5)
24 = nrec :
Death is an absorbing state. We also consider the …nal healthy state to be absorbing, i.e. we
abstract from relapses.

3.3

Probabilities and means
The evolution of probabilities, shares and expected numbers

We can express the transition across health states of an individual by a stochastic di¤erential
equation similar to the transition across states of employment (see e.g. appendix B:1 to Bayer
et al., 2019 or Khieu and Wälde, 2020). We can also directly write down ordinary di¤erential
equations for an individual to be in a certain state s at t: Let us denote this probability by
ps (t) =Prob(si (t) = sjsi (0) = 1) ; i.e. as the probability to be in state s at t conditional on
having started in state 1 at t = 0: The ODEs have the following general form (see Ross, 1993
for background),
p_1 (t) =
p_2 (t) =
p_3 (t) =

and are completed by the identity p4 (t) = 1 p1 (t) p2 (t) p3 (t) : For brevity, individual
transition rates are represented by rs : We stress that these equations hold for arrival rates
that can take any functional form with arguments N1 ; N2 , N3 and N4 :
As death is an absorbing state, 3i = 0 for all i. Given the assumption that infected means
being immune to further infection and that the mortality rate is negligible in symptom-free
12

One could plausibly argue and …nd support in micro studies that the death and recovery rate also depend
on the number of healthy individuals (that are required to take care of sick individuals). These considerations
are not crucial for our macro analysis and are therefore neglected.

A standard law of large numbers tells us that individual probabilities also give shares in
the population. Hence, when we solve this system, we can think of the time paths of ps (t)
also as the shares of society in the di¤erent states. When we compute the expected number of
individuals in state s at t, denoted by Ns (t) ; we would also obtain an identical ODE system
where the probabilities are replaced by the expected numbers.13 As the interest of our analysis
lies in the (expected) number of individuals in certain states (are there su¢ ciently many beds
in hospital for severe cases?), we will also refer to the variable ps (t) as the (expected) number
Ns (t) of individuals.
The probability to get sick per day
For our quantitative predictions it will be useful to present the probability for an individual
to get sick over a period of one day or one week. So far, we only talked about rates rs . We
denote the probability to get sick over a period of one day, starting in t; by pgs
day (t) : This
probability is one minus the probability to stay healthy. The probability to stay healthy is,
given the exponential distribution of duration in a state, a simple exponential function of the
transition rate. We therefore obtain

The second probability pgs

7 days to come. We will plot them below to provide a measure of how risky social interactions
are during the evolution of the epidemic.

3.4

The number of individuals who get and ever got sick and deaths

As recovery is a process that enters additional measurement problems, a more reliable data
source for our calibration purposes is the number of individuals that have been reported to
be sick since the onset of the epidemic. This is also the time series that is typically reported
by countries and regions (such as those reported by the RKI in Germany or the WHO more
generally). In our model, the corresponding number follows from the in‡ows from state 1 to 2
and is given by
N_ 2ever (t) = 12 (t) N1 (t) = 12 (t) p1 (t)N:
(9)
When we are interested in the number of individuals that are newly reported to be sick at
some point in time t (incidences at t in short), we should not employ N2 (t) : The change of
the latter, described in (7b), is determined by the newly reported (in‡ow) minus the out‡ow,
i.e. those that recovered (and those who died). Hence, when data provides incidences on a
~s (t) where N
~s (t) is the
Let us denote the expected number of individuals in state s at t by Ns (t) = E0 N
stochastic process for the number of individuals in state s at t: As the expected share of individuals in state s
equals the probability to be in this state, Ns (t) =N = ps (t) ; we can write Ns (t) = ps (t) N for the expected
number of individuals in this state. Replacing the probabilities ps (t) by Ns (t) would yield an ODE system in
Ns (t) : Our system employed for predictions below in (15) is expressed in this way.

Model properties

Before we calibrate our model, we brie‡y discuss its theoretical predictions. This illustrates
the plausibility of our assumptions and also the ‡exibility of the model. Our model consists of
the ODE system (7) where we replace the probabilities ps (t) by the expected number Ns (t) as
described in footnote 13. The sickness rate 12 is from (2), the other arrival rates 14 and 24
are from (4) and (5), respectively. The death rate 23 is a constant. We start the solution of our
ever
model with N2ever (0) = Nobserved
(0) : We set N3 (0) = N4 (0) = 0 and N1 (0) = N N2ever (0).
One can easily understand the plausible structure of our ODE system (7). The number N1 (t)
of healthy individuals in state 1 (i.e. the probability or share p1 (t)) can only fall. Individuals
either get sick with rate 12 or get infected without symptoms with rate 14 : Both transitions
imply an out‡ow from state 1. The same is true, mutatis mutandis, for state 3 and 4: For state
3, there are only in‡ows from state 2 implying that N3 (t) increases over time. State 4 only
experiences in‡ows from state 1 and 2 implying that N4 (t) increases over time. The number
N2 (t) of sick individuals can rise or fall, depending on the di¤erence between in‡ows with 12
and out‡ows with 23 or 24 .
In the long-run, i.e. when the epidemic is over, individuals will be distributed across states
1; 3 and 4: Some individuals will never get infected. They therefore remain in state 1 all
throughout the epidemic. This …nding follows from the fact that the sickness rate 12 from (2)
falls to zero when the infection rate (t) from (1) equals its long-run value : Note that 12 = 0
implies from (4) that 14 = 0 as well, hence out‡ows from 1 to 4 end as well. The ratio is a
widely accepted quantity in epidemiology and will be quanti…ed below. Some individuals that
turn sick and are in state 2 die. They end up in state 3 in the long-run. Most individuals will
be in state 4 in the long-run, either after having transitioned through state 2 or directly from
state 1.
The model also displays a long-run property that is extremely useful to judge its quantitative
property in a very simple way. With a population of N individuals and a long-run infection
rate discussed after (1), the number of individuals that will have been infected is N: When
a share r of all infected turns sick, the long-run number of individuals that were sick at some
point, described in (9), is
lim N2ever (t) = r N:
(12)
t!1

The long-run number of reported sick individuals therefore only depends on the long-run infection rate and the share r of individuals that turn sick and are reported. We will exploit this
property when we discuss the e¤ects of policy measures below.

Calibration
Data

Our most important data source is the number of individuals that is reported to be sick. We
obtain these out‡ows from state 1 to 2 from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI, 2020). These
data …x the left-hand side of our time path for the number N2ever (t) from (9) of individuals that
are ever reported to be sick. To …x notation, t = 0 stands for the 24th February 2020 and T is
the day of our …nal observation.
It seems reasonable to assume that parameters are not constant throughout the entire
epidemic. Most centrally, the contact rate a employed in the sickness rate (2) will change as
a function of governmental regulations. The …rst major e¤ects consisted in cancelling sports
events (14 March) and closing schools (16 March). Other measures followed.14 Given a median
incubation of 5.2 days (Linton et al., 2020, Lauer et al., 2020) and a certain delay between
feeling symptoms, contacting a doctor and getting reported at RKI (say, 2-3 days), we employ
T = 21 March 2020 as our last observation to …x the contact rate a:
Data to compute the death rate from Corona are also taken from the RKI (2020). We
…nally employ various sources, to be discussed in what follows, to …x the share r of infected
individuals that turn sick and the long-run infection rate :

Targets and parameters
Parameters

Some model parameters are straightforward to be …xed. Concerning the recovery rate (5),
we set nrec equal to an average of 14 days despite strong heterogeneity in the course of disease
(Guan et al., 2020). The death rate follows from (11). As we want to match the number of
reported deaths from COVID-19 by T; the constant death rate for the period from 0 to T can
be computed from
N3obs (T )
;
(13)
23 (T ) = R T
p
(s)
dsN
2
0

where N3obs (T ) is the number of dead individuals at T: Employing this equation yields the value
of 1=500 in table 2.
A more open parameter for this epidemic but for which there is a lot of information for
other epidemics is the long-run share of infected individuals, i.e. the limit of (1). We set
this equal to 0:67 meaning that once the epidemic is over, two thirds of the population will
have been infected and one third are still in the original healthy state 1. As there is a lot of
uncertainty concerning this value, we consider this widely employed value of 2=3 initially. We
will then also consider one tenth of 0:67 as a lower bound further below. This lower bound
is motivated by observations from Hubei and South Korea discussed in section 2.15 Another
parameter which is hard to pin down is the share of healthy individuals in state 4 (i.e. they
14

See https://www.macro.economics.uni-mainz.de/corona-blog/ for more details.
One might conjecture to employ so-called reproduction numbers to get an idea about : A reproduction
number gives the number of infections in a non-immune population when one infected individual is introduced.
Riou and Althaus (2020) estimate this value to lie in the range of 2.0 to 2.5 for Wuhan from December 2019 to
January 2020. The WHO (2020) reports it in the same range. These reproduction numbers change over time
(as our sickness rate 12 (t) changes over time) when the population becomes more and more immune. One can
therefore not draw conclusions from these estimates about long-run values like . We return to this point when
discussing the robustness of …ndings with respect to r after …gure 7 and the e¤ects of policy measures in …gure
9.

We also undertake robustness analyses with respect to this parameter.
The most interesting parameters are those that allow us to match data reported by RKI.
To do so, we minimize the Euclidean distance between the reported data and the predicted
values of the model. We target a weighted sum of the squared di¤erence between N2ever (t) from
(9) and observation and the newly-sick N2new (t) from (10) and observation. More precisely,

Table 2 Parameters for the epidemic without public health measures
We …nally need to quantify r: A generally accepted benchmark says that around 80% of
infected individuals do not display any or only weak symptoms.16 The remaining share of 20%
turns sick. One crucial question for equation (4), but also for our long-run prediction from (12),
is therefore the issue of reporting. If a large share of sick individuals show up at the general
practitioner who does not test all individuals that display symptoms that might be caused by
CoV-2, then the share r of individuals that are sick and reported is much lower than these
20%: We therefore set r = 0:1 and undertake robustness analyses further below.

Figure 4 New incidences (reported) in the model (N2new (t) ; curve) and in the data (dots) (left
…gure) and the number N2ever (t) of sick in model and data (right …gure) for the epidemic without
public health measures
The left part of …gure 4 shows the number of individuals that were ever reported to be sick.
The observations from RKI are depicted as circles. It shows that our parameter choices are
su¢ ciently good to use this model for projections into the future.17 This impression is also
con…rmed from the right part of this …gure. Obviously, …tting daily values is more demanding
due to the greater variance in the data.
The …gure also shows where, in the case of no public health measures, Germany would be
heading to. Under the assumption that the share of sick and reported individuals out of the
infected individuals is r = 0:1; the …nal number of reported sick individuals will be (right part
of …gure) 5.5 million. This level will be reached towards the end of June.18 Hence, towards the
end of the epidemic, at stable parameter values, around 7 in 100 inhabitants will have been
sick (and reported).
Note that this long run value does not only come out of the solution of our calibrated system
(15). It can also be directly read from the long-run prediction in (12), which can be written as
limt!1 N2ever (t) =N = r . When we assume that two thirds of the population will be infected
after the epidemic, = 2=3, and 20% turn sick of which the half is reported such that r = :1;
we immediately see from (12) that the long run share is 6:7%, i.e. around 7 in 100.
17

Appendix A.3 provides an enlarged version of this …gure.
This …gure intuitively shows that in the medium-run, the long-run sickness share r from (12) will be
predictable from these observed time paths. At this point, there are too few observations and this is not yet
feasible.

Figure 5 The number of sick individuals (s = 2) by day starting on 24 February 2020 in the
absence of public health measures
The number of sick individuals rises strongly initially. This is the consequence of infections.
As recovery sets in only after 2 weeks, the initial period sees this strong increase. Once the
number of new sick cases reduces (as the number of individuals in state 1 decreases) and recovery
sets in, the number of sick individuals falls again. The peak will be reached mid May. We note
that this is a prediction for the case where individual contacts, as captured by the parameter
a in (2), remain unchanged over time. If the policy measures in place as of 14 March have an
e¤ect, we would expect a slowdown in the rise of N2 (t) : This picture therefore shows what
would have happened if no interventions had taken place. In this case, the number of sick (and
reported) individuals on a given day, taking recovery into account, will rise above 1 million end
of April.
This …gure also provides the maximum number of infected individuals over the epidemic.
This allows to understand whether the number of extreme cases is always below the level that
can be handled by the German health system. The peak of the number of sick individuals mid
April is close to 220,000. According to the Deutsche Krankenhausgesellschaft (2020), there are
28,000 beds available in intensive care units (ICUs) in Germany. A fraction of these are currently
available for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. In addition to that, an unde…ned number of
hospital facilities allowing ventilation might be available in due time by reorganization activities.
By contrast, a large fraction of COVID-19 patients might be treatable on regular wards. While
it is therefore di¢ cult to pin down the precise number of beds available for COVID-19 patients,
a peak of more than 1 million on a given day is de…nitely beyond any level that can be handled
by the health care system. The prevention of such a scenario is the key issue of all measures
currently taken by federal and state governments. We therefore point to our assessment of
theses measures further below.
If one would like to point out one advantage of this scenario without public health measures:
the epidemic is fast. As the infection rate is very high, the out‡ow from the state of being
healthy is fast. Hence, a large share of individuals, 1 r = 90%; are infected without showing
symptoms (or weak symptoms such that they are not reported) and they are immune (in state
4) quickly. Both …gure 4 (left) and …gure 5 show that the epidemic would be over end of June.

Figure 6 The probability per day (dotted) and per week (solid) to get sick in the absence of
public health measures
As this picture shows, the risk to get sick for each individual from (8) is very low throughout
the entire epidemic. At the peak, the probability to get sick on a given day (red curve) is around
10 4 . In words, 1 person in 10,000 inhabitants turns sick per day. The probability to turn sick
within a week (blue curve) is of course larger and lies at the peak at around 7 in 10,000
individuals. We emphasize again that this is the number of sick individuals that are actually
reported to the RKI.
We compare the daily risk of 1 in 10,000 or the weekly risk of 7 in 10,000 with the long-run
risk of 7 in 100 by the end of the epidemic to be or have been sick (as discussed after …gure
4), it seems that at the individual level, the daily or even weekly risk of the epidemic is not
really a major health risk.19 It is clear, however, that at the level of society, the epidemic is a
major issue. This di¤erence between the individual risk and aggregate outcomes is the result
of a classic negative externality. Even individuals that take into account the overall risk of 7 in
100 to turn sick might not be concerned. If the risk of infecting others was taken into account,
individual behaviour would look di¤erently. This is why governmental interventions have a
clear justi…cation from the perspective of market failure and public economics.

5.3

Robustness check
The long-run sickness rate r

Given uncertainty about the share r of individuals that turn sick from an infection, we
undertook robustness checks. Instead of our value of 0:1, we also solved our model for an r ten
times lower up to twice as large –as the left column of the next table shows. For each of these
new values for r, we recalibrate the values for a and to match the initial observations of sick
individuals.
19

This might explain behaviour of some individuals who seem to ignore governmental pleas to reduce social
interactions.

Table 3 Varying the long-run sickness rate r
The model predictions are very reasonable from a qualitative perspective. The larger the
individual risk r to get sick, the higher the number N2 (t) of simultaneously sick individuals
and the later the peak tmax of the epidemic.

Figure 7 The number N2 (t) of sick individuals as a function of assumptions on the probability
r to get sick after an infection
We also …nd, as was to be expected, that a larger r implies a longer duration of the epidemic.
If we de…ne the end of the epidemic by the day tnew
100 where only 100 new incidences are reported
per day, we see that the end of the epidemic lies between 19 May and 25 June. Interestingly,
the end of the epidemic is not monotonic in r: When the end of the epidemic is de…ned by the
point in time t1000 where 1000 sick individuals are left (N (t1000 ) = 1000), the epidemic ends
between 15 July and 27 September. Note that the t1000 de…nition implies much later endpoints
(of one and the same epidemic) than the tnew
100 de…nition.
Why are these numbers important from a public health perspective? The data section shows
that Hubei and South Korea seem to have managed to keep the long-run ratio r from (12) at 1
in 1000 (Hubei) or 1 in 5000 (South Korea). If we believe that these values are long-run values,
then either the individual probability r to get sick after infection of the long-run infection rate
must be much lower than the standard values shown in 2 or sickness probabilities r must be
lower.
As no information is available at this point about the share of individuals that are already
immune to CoV-2 in Germany, one might well hope that Germany is heading towards a Hubei
long-run equilibrium. As data quality was often argued to be an issue, our long-run ratio r
with r = 0:01 would correspond to 6.7 in 1000 individuals that were sick at some point in the
long-run (N2ever ). This would imply that –in the case of no public intervention –the peak in
the number of sick individuals would only be around 180 thousand individuals (as the …rst row
of table 3 shows). The blue time path of N2 (t) of …gure 7 would be relevant.

Infections via individuals without symptoms
We also inquired into the e¤ect of ; i.e. into the share of healthy individuals that can
infect other individuals. The value of in table 2 is 0.4 and we now varied it between .25 and
.75. While there were qualitative changes (…gures are available upon request), there are no
quantitative change that would be of interest for any public health questions.

The e¤ect of policy measures

Given that an undamped spread of CoV-2 in society leads to high reported incidences N2 (t),
public health measures are attempting to reduce social contacts. The fewer social contacts, the
lower infections per day. These contacts are captured by the parameter a in (2). Now assume
the number of contacts per individual is restricted in some exogenous manner. Individuals are
not allowed to watch soccer matches, go to conferences or move around freely in their region
or country. What is the e¤ect of these measures? We also ask whether it makes a di¤erence
whether such measures are taken at the beginning of the outbreak of infections or when the
measures are delayed for 1 month.

6.1

The experiments

We model policy measures by assuming a time path for a. The …rst major policy measure,
’shut down’for simplicity, took place as of 14 March 2020. Sports events from professional to
amateur leagues and schools were closed. This measure is planned to continue until 19 April
2020. As our quantitative analysis starts on 24 February, we employ parameters from table
2 for the unrestricted epidemic. We especially keep the value for the contact intensity a of
individuals. After 20 days, we reduce a to a lower level alow for the duration of this policy
measure. After 37 days, i.e. on 20 April, we return to the original level, assuming that sports
events and schooling resumes. Formally,

Restrictive policy starts

For this baseline analysis, we do not recalibrate the model as a in our scenarios changes after
T; the day providing the last observation used for calibration. Parameter values are therefore
given by the values in table 2. The e¤ect of various forms of shut downs are captured by a drop
of the contact rate a by 50% to alow , as shown in (16).
The results are shown in the next …gure. Our main variable for judging policy measures is
the number N2 (t) of individuals that are simultaneously sick.

Figure 8 The e¤ect of a shut down
First, the policy is e¤ective. Reducing contacts reduces the speed of infections and new
cases of sickness –but also the transition from healthy in state 1 to healthy (with infection) in
state 4: The case without shut down is illustrated by the red curve in this …gure. It is identical
to the curve in …gure 5. The shut down from (16) which re‡ects the planned closing of schools
in Germany until mid April is drawn as the green curve. It reduces the rise of the number
of sick individuals until mid April. Afterwards, the number of sick individuals will rise more
quickly again. The peak is reached in June and this peak is lower than the one without the
shut down. In this respect the shut down is a good policy measure. When the shut down is
extended (the black curve), the peak is further shifted to the right and also smaller.20
Quantitatively speaking, the shut down prolongs the epidemic in terms of its end as de…ned
by tnew
100 also employed in table 3 (100 or fewer new incidences are reported per day). For the
shut down currently in place and for the delayed shut down, the end is beginning of July. For
the longer shut down, the end is beginning of August. Concerning the peak demands on the
health system, the shut down as currently in place, and also an extended shut down, hardly
have any e¤ect. There is a certain delay –which helps the health sector to prepare for higher
numbers in the future. But the level of the peak, as the …gure shows, hardly changes. This
looks like a bleak outlook.
To be fair, we should stress at this point that the assumption that a shut down reduces
the contact rate and thereby the infection rate by 50% is open to empirical investigation. At
this point, this is a model assumption for which empirical evidence is still lacking. Hartl et
20

If we had a sequence of shut downs with breaks in between, it would qualitatively look like a combination
of the green and the blue curve. The green curve represents a shut down that ends end of April where the
green curve starts rising quickly again. Then when a new shut down takes place as of mid May, the number of
sick individuals would follow the blue curve. When the “blue shut down” ends end of May, the number of sick
individuals starts rising again as shown by the blue curve.

al. (2020) show that statistically convincing evidence will be available at the earliest beginning
of April. It seems fair to say, however, that it can hardly be expected at this point that current
measures reduce the infection rate by 50%. Hence, the above evaluation of the shut down might
even be too optimistic.21
Is a delayed shut down a good idea?
Interestingly, a delayed shut down (blue curve) is almost as good as an extended shut down
and in some respect is even better: A delayed shut down reduces the peak in the number of sick
individuals. Hospitals are therefore less crowded with a delayed shut down as opposed to an
immediate shutdown. This implies, more generally speaking, that there is an optimal timing
for a shut down.
Why is there an optimal point for a shut down? Imagine the shut down takes place early
(our curve). Then the number of sick individuals does not increase that quickly. The downside
is that, once the shut down is over, there are a lot of healthy individuals left that can turn sick.
The number of new incidences jumps up and the peak is reached quickly. When the shut down
takes place later (the blue curve), the number of sick individuals is larger at the moment the
shut down starts. Once the shut down is over, the number of healthy individuals that are left
to turn sick is not as large as in the case of an early shut down. As a consequence, the peak is
less high.
In a perfect world with complete knowledge about the number of sick individuals, the long
run infection rate ; the individual risk r to turn sick from an infection and other parameters
employed in this model, policy makers should therefore choose the optimal point in time for
an intervention. In the world we live in, this information is not available, neither from a
medical, nor from a statistical and data processing perspective. The …nding nevertheless makes
the strong point that policy interventions should be conditioned on the current situation in a
country or region. Ideas that policy measures must be the same for all regions in Germany at
all points in time are strongly contradicted.22
The policy e¤ects with lower
Let us now return to the uncertainty about the value of the long-run share of infected
individuals. We varied r in table 3 such that we could also study a “data-quality adjusted
Hubei-scenario” where r implies that there are 6.7 in 1000 (ever) sick individuals. This was
discussed after …gure 7. We now study changes in at unchanged r = 0:1 such that we end
up at r = 6:7=1000: We therefore reduce by a factor of 10. We do recalibrate our model for
this scenario as a¤ects the calibration outcome. The …t is similarly good to the one discussed
after …gure 4. Given the new parameter values, we change the contact rate according to the
shut down (16) and the extended shut down (18).
Let us start with the long-run e¤ects. As we know from (12), the long-run e¤ects with
reduced by a factor of 10 are 10 times lower. This is visible in the right part of …gure 9
displaying N2ever (t) : Once the epidemic is over, there will be 550 thousand individuals that
were sick at some point, one tenth of the level in …gure 4. This is again independent of policy
measures as the latter do not a¤ect r :
21

All of our scenarios could look much more optimistic if we had a vaccine. To the best of our knowledge,
this will not be available over the next 6 months.
22
We understand that from a policy perspective it is simpler to “sell a measure”that is the same for everybody
than measures that di¤er across individuals. Yet, treating unequals as equals has rarely been a convincing idea.

Figure 9 The e¤ect of changes in the long-run infection rate
Concerning short-run e¤ect, we see that in the case of no intervention (or interventions that
do not have an e¤ect), the peak comes earlier for N2 (t). The red curve in …gure 9 peaks in
mid April in contrast to early to mid May for the higher long-run infection rate of …gure 8.
The e¤ect of the shut down currently in place looks qualitatively similar to the e¤ect when
is higher. By contrast, the extended shut down in …gure 9 does not display a strong rise in
growth rates of N2 (t) once it is over. It is directly followed by the decline in the number of sick
individuals.
Most importantly, however, theses two …gures display a strong quantitative di¤erence. If
the long run infection rate in Germany is in the “data-quality adjusted Hubei range”, the
peaks are at a much lower level. In the case without policy measures and in the case where the
current shut down (16) is the only policy measure, the peaks of the simultaneously sick number
of individuals is just above 200 thousand. This strongly contrasts to earlier values above 1
million. Another di¤erence consists in the quantitative di¤erence here between the extended
shut down and the shut down. In the scenario with a lower long-run infection rate, an extended
shut down implies that the peak of N2 (t) will be much lower than the peak of the normal shut
down. This was not the case in …gure 8. This points to the fact that shut downs need to be
su¢ ciently strong relative to the overall potential number of sick individuals.
When the long-run infection rate is in this Hubei-range, then the epidemic is also over more
quickly than in the case of an infection rate of two thirds. In any case, the epidemic will last
until June, in the case of extended shut downs (or other measures) it can even last until mid
July.

Conclusion

We have developed a model that allows to study the spread of an infection in a society. We
have solved this model and calibrated it to Germany. We employ the observed number of
reported infections to match the initial increase of the number of sick individuals. In addition,
we employ parameter values from the medical literature to quantify e.g. long-run infection rates
or individual risks to turn sick after an infection. Given uncertainty about the precision of these
parameter values, we undertook robustness checks with respect to this long-run measure.
When we studied the e¤ect of policy measures, we found that any intervention that reduces
the contact rate of individuals reduces the strength of the epidemic. Both the peak of the
number of simultaneously sick individuals as well as the individual sickness risk go down. This
decrease is stronger, the longer the policy measure lasts.

We also …nd, however, that there is an optimal point in time when an intervention, e¤ective
for a …xed length of time (say, 3 weeks), should start. When the intervention starts too early,
there are “too many” healthy individuals left at the end of the intervention. The rise in the
number of sick individuals would be accelerated. When the intervention starts later, the number
of sick individuals is larger initially. Once the intervention is over, there are, as a consequence,
not so many healthy individuals left and the peak is smaller. While implementing optimal
schemes for real world societies probably requires too much information, this …nding points
towards implementing policy measures which are contingent on the current situation (number
of sick individuals per capita) of a region or country.
In the long-run, for given parameters, the number of sick individuals is not a¤ected by policy
measures when the latter only reduce contact rates of individuals. All …ndings are subject
to large uncertainty given little knowledge about long-run infection rates following a CoV-2
epidemic and individual sickness rates. It seems to be certain, however, that the epidemic will
last at least until July, given the public health measures in place. Even in the case of a good
scenario with extremely low long-run infection rates, the peak of the number of simultaneously
sick individuals will lie above 200 thousand individuals.
A lot of extensions of this framework are worth being undertaken. First, optimal behaviour
of individuals could be taken into account. The activity parameter a is like the outcome of
decisions of individuals on how much to work and how much to enjoy social interactions. One
can imagine a trade-o¤ between reducing the risk of getting infected by lowering a and working
fewer hours and thereby experiencing lower labour income. The same trade-o¤ is present at the
aggregate level to be tackled by a government. Such a trade-o¤ might also include behavioural
features like anxiety as in Caplin and Leahy (2001), potentially in a simpli…ed way as presented
in Wälde and Moors (2017). These extensions will help to better understand the challenges
posed by this pandemic.
A more detailed modelling of the long-run infection rate would also be useful. The path of
social contacts over time should have an in‡uence on the share of infected individuals in the
long-run. A more detailed matching mechanism than the one employed here – borrowed in
spirit from search and matching models –should be developed.
Finally, the calibration process employed here can be extended to full structural estimation. Further, the e¤ects of the policy measures in place since 14 March can be estimated or
calibrated. The calibration in this paper employs data up to the point where measures of 14
March should start having an e¤ect. As of end of March, the intervention regime discussed
above and the corresponding (reduced) contact rate could be quanti…ed. This would provide a
good idea of the e¤ects of these policy measures.

Data sources
Data sources and calculations

The data used in this note is taken from two sources: (i) the World Health Organisation’s
Situation reports on the progress of COVID-19, and (ii) the dataset put together by the nCoV2019 Data Working Group (Dong et al. (2020)). In particular, wherever available the data from
the nCoV-2019 Group is used instead of the data from the WHO, in an e¤ort to remain as
consistent as possible by using only one source at a time. Data from the nCoV-2019 Group is
used as it provides a centralised and standardised repository of multiple o¢ cial sources.
The …gures showing the number of new con…rmed cases at a date t were produced by
computing the di¤erence between the cumulative total number of con…rmed cases at t minus
the cumulative total number of con…rmed cases at t 1, i.e.
new casest = total casest

total casest 1 :

As detailed in the Table 1, the infection rate is computed by dividing the cumulative total
number of con…rmed cases as of the time of writing by the population of the corresponding
