Abstract

22

COVID-19 pandemic has been evolving in Pakistan since the UK, South African and Brazilian

23

variants have started surfacing which are known for increase transmissibility and can also be

24

responsible for escape from immune responses. The gold standard to detect these variants of

25

concern is sequencing, however routine genomic surveillance in resource limited countries like

26

Pakistan is not always readily available. With the emergence of variants of concern and a dearth

27

of facilities for genomic scrutiny leaves policy makers and health authorities an inconsistent and

28

twisted image to make decisions. The inadvertent detection of B.1.1.7 by target failure because

29

of a key deletion in spike Δ69-70 in the UK by commercially available COVID-19 PCR assay helps

30

to understand target failures as an alternative approach to detect variants. It was ascertained

31

further that a deletion in the ORF1a gene (ORF1a Δ3675-3677) found common in B.1.1.7, B.135

32

and P.1 variants of concern. The Real Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay for detection of

33

emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants, by these target failures is used here. The

34

positive samples archived in respective labs were divided in two groups used in the present

35

study. Group I constitutes 261 positive samples out of 16964 (1.53%) collected from August till

36

September 2020. Group II include 3501 positive samples out of 46041 (7.60%) from November

37

2020 till January 2021. In positive samples of group I, no variant of concern was found. A

38

staggering difference in results was noted in group II where positivity ratio increased

39

exponentially and the variants of concern started appearing in significant numbers (53.64%

40

overall). This is indicative that the third wave in Pakistan is due to the importation of SARS-CoV-

41

2 variants. This calls for measures to increase surveillance by RT-qPCR which would help

42

authorities in decision making.

Introduction

44

The global outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2),

45

causative agent of COVID-19 disease, has ravaged the world by surprise. As of March 28, 2021

46

the SARS-CoV-2 related infections have surpassed over 128,247,719 and 2,804,719 deaths

47

globally. In Pakistan, the virus has affected more than 659,116 individuals, with more than

48

14,256 reported deaths till date [1]. SARS-CoV-2 has been responsible for overwhelmed health

49

care systems, coerced shutting down of schools and gatherings, and pulling the planet into an

50

economic recession. Despite the fact that 2020 was a challenging year, 2021 seems to be not

51

easy with the surfacing of multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2.

52

One of the notorious variants of SARS-CoV-2 characterized as 501Y.V1 (lineage B.1.1.7)

53

becomes known in the United Kingdom in December 2020, [2]. Spreading like a wildfire B.1.1.7

54

variant has reported to be rapidly expanding to 101 countries as of March 18, 2021 [3]. A

55

similar pattern of staggering rise in SARS-CoV-2 related infections was observed in South Africa

56

mainly due to the emergence of 501Y.V2 (lineage B.1351) [4]. The increased transmission rates

57

of both the variants are attributed to the mutation in receptor binding site (N501Y) of spike

58

protein [5]. The 501Y.V2 variant presents a possible immune escape to antibodies by having

59

two additional mutations in the spike protein (E484K and K417N) [6]. Moreover, It was reported

60

in a concerning development that a different set of mutations (N501Y, E484K, and K417T)

61

started surfacing in a new 501Y.V3 (P.1) variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil [7].

62

First cases of Covid-19 in Pakistan were reported on Feb 26, 2020 which was the beginning of

63

the arbitrary first wave that reached its peak on June 14 with 7000 cases per day and touched

64

the low 264 cases on August 29, 2020 with trough maintained till Oct 14, 2020 which

65

hallmarked the beginning of so called second wave. Peak of the second wave reached on

66

December 7 with 3795 reported new infections followed by a trough on February 16, 2021 with

67

747 new cases per day which was not a true trough and this decline was followed by a gradual

68

rise in daily new cases arbitrarily labeled as the third wave (Fig 1) with its new spike of 4767

69

cases on March 28, 2021 [8].

Fig 1: Daily record of cases of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Fig 1 representing three peaks

71

of SARS-CoV-2, first achieved in June 2020 followed by trough from Aug to Oct 2020. Second

72

peak started from November and after a brief stagnant phase, the cases started to increase

73

exponentially in March due to emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

74

The current emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants following the phase of genetic stability of the

75

virus is a matter of great concern since numerous new escape variants could surface in future

76

and can head to epidemic resurgence, as seen in other countries. Increase in transmission of

77

the virus augment chances for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. While sequencing is the

78

gold standard to ascertain, it cannot always be scaled right away in limited resource countries

79

for detection of variants of concern. Therefore a multiplex qPCR assay reported earlier to

80

detect variants of concern is used here, this can be helpful in rapid mapping of SARS-CoV-2

81

variants in countries like Pakistan (9).

Sampling of SARS-CoV-2

87

Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens collected for testing of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse

88

transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). This was achieved in Molecular

89

pathology section of Advanced Laboratories, Hashmanis Laboratories, and Citilab Diagnostic

90

Centers in Karachi. The samples which came positive were archived in respective labs and were

91

used in the present study for variant detection. Briefly, positive samples were extracted using

92

viral Nucleic acid kit (Systaac) according to manufacturers’ instruction. The extracts were then

93

subjected to RT-qPCR. The samples before extraction were divided in two categories, samples

94

collected and archived from August to October 2020 (group I) and the samples collected from

95

November 2020 to January 2021 (group II) respectively.

96

Primers/ Probes

97

The primers/ probes set CDC_N1, ∆69/70 del, and ∆ORF1a-del (Table 1) were used in the assay

98

to detect all the three variants by targeting the Δ3675-3677 SGF deletion in the ORF1a gene

99

(not been reported in other SARS-CoV-2 lineages) and by targeting the Δ69/70 HV deletion in

100

the spike gene. This protocol can discriminate B.1.1.7 from B.1.351 and P.1. The 100 µM stock

101

solutions of primers/ probes were prepared for further processing.

for PCR reaction a probe qPCR master mix along with hot start RT enzyme mix (Thermo

109

Scientific) is used. For PCR reaction 20 µM of working stocks of primers/ probes mix was

110

prepared using 100 µM stocks. After preparation of mix, the thermal cycler was set for FAM,

111

HEX, and Cy5 fluorophores while the thermal cycling conditions were slightly modified for

112

optimized results (Table 2).

154

Discussion

155

The PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection in UK during September 2020 have shown unusual

156

SARS-CoV-2 strain that prevents amplification of spike gene, also known as spike gene target

157

failure (SGTF), in a commercially available kit [10]. The failure to detect spike gene is attributed

158

to a ∆69/70 HV deletion as in the lineage 501.YV1 (B.1.1.7) or commonly known as the UK

159

variant. Moreover, the P.1. lineage in Brazil and the B.1.351 lineage described in South Africa

160

share a common set of mutations ORF1a deletion 3675-3677 SGF [11]. Therefore, a sample with

161

∆69/70 HV deletion is not enough for discriminative detection of B.1.1.7 from other variants of

162

concern i.e501.YV2 and 501.YV3 (B.1351; South African and P.1; Brazilian variant), which does

163

not possess ∆69/70 HV deletion. Therefore, a multiplex PCR assay reported earlier targeting

164

∆3675-3677 SGF deletion in ORF 1a gene along with ∆69/70 HV deletion is used in the present

165

study to discriminate B.1.1.7 from B.1351 and P.1 variants of SARS-CoV-2[9]. We have used

166

CDC_N1 primer and probe as a control to ensure that target failures were due to these

167

mutations. In resource limited countries like Pakistan the present study can therefore be

168

helpful to rapidly scale up the prediction of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

169

These SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1) are the cause of concern globally not only

170

because of their ability to transmit rapidly but also because of antigenic changes due to

171

multiple mutations in spike protein region unfavorable to monoclonal antibody (mAB) therapies

172

and protection by vaccines [7, 12]. The variant P.1 or 501Y.V3 is spreading at a rapid pace in

173

Brazil and spreading globally. N501Y is the common mutation shared between these three

174

SARS-CoV-2 lineages of concern. This particular mutation may result in augmented binding to

175

ACE231 which exhibit no significant escape value from emergency use authorized mAB

176

therapies and vaccines [13]. However, E484K mutation present in B.135 and P.1 variants has

177

been attributed for impairing many mABs and vaccines under development and also

178

responsible for re-infection [10]. This threat has been augmented by the recent observation

179

from the Novavax vaccine trial in South Africa which showed that exposure to B.135 in placebo

180

recipients’ exhibit to be un-protective against prior SARS-CoV-2 infection [12-14]. Even in Brazil

181

the same mutation in P.1 is reported to be responsible for spreading of the virus in a population

182

that was already 76% seropositive due to past infection [14]. This highlights the importance of

183

this study of mapping viral variants by RT-qPCR which could be adopted by limited resource

184

countries worldwide. This mapping would be helpful in effective development of therapies and

185

vaccines targeting antigenically distinct epitopes.

186

We demonstrate the presence of UK (B.1.1.7; 27.04%) and South African and Brazilian (B.135

187

and P.1; 29.94%) variants of SARS-CoV-2 from the positive samples collected in group II. the

188

present study positive samples archived before November 2020,i.e in group I, did not exhibit

189

variants of concern. Noteworthy, in group I (Aug to Oct 2020) the positivity ratio was 1.538%

190

which later increased to 7.60% in group II (Nov 2020 to Jan 2021) which clearly indicate the

191

importation of cases from countries where these viral strains were spreading before and during

192

November 2020. The spread of pandemic globally provides opportunity for variable strain types

193

to thrive. One of the reasons of this spread could be the unmonitored international flights and

194

no quarantine on arrival in Pakistan from any country, which lead to a rapid introduction of

195

variants of concern in Pakistan [15-16]. Pakistan is in second wave which could not be truncated

196

due to variants entry which prevented decline to base line following the first wave and second

197

peak of second wave is labeled as 3rd wave affecting Prime minister, First Lady and President of

198

Pakistan. Not only the notables of the country have been affected in this notorious second

199

wave, but our results also revealed that positivity ratio in female has significantly increased

200

from 22.15% to 27.01%. This clearly indicates that variants are more transmittable.

201

At present, the significance of the surveillance of variants has increased globally as the

202

vaccination jabs have started and countries are in race to vaccinate. Limited resources countries

203

are lagging behind and with the emergence of these variants in these countries it is of high

204

possibility that an escape variant could evolve which could hinder the vaccination process

205

globally. The limited resource countries might act as the breeding ground for the variants of the

206

virus that could be detrimental to global efforts for ending the pandemic.

207

The striking part of our study is the presence of variant with ∆3675-3677 SGF deletion in ORF 1a

208

gene which implied the presence of South African and Brazilian variants in Pakistan. The most

209

detrimental part of the present study is that South African and Brazilian variants are

210

comparable in numbers in December 2020 and January 2021 as compared to its counterpart UK

African and Brazilian variants calls for strict measures to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The

214

lucidity in this situation of darkness can only be attained by arrangement of non-

215

pharmaceutical interventions and scaling up-of vaccination program, which could lead to fewer

216

infections, in turn leads to fewer variants. Both strategies are important until population

217

immunity is achieved globally.

218

The current pandemic should nudge the developed countries that infectious diseases have a

219

profound impact on lives and economies and rapid distribution and implementation of useful

220

vaccines against these infections should remain priority. The cooperation of the globe to make

221

certain the justness and responsiveness to local contexts is necessary on the complex trail

222

forward to ending the COVID-19 pandemic.
