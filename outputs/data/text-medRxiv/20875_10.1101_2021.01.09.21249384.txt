Abstract: A fast-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variant identified in the United Kingdom in December
2020 has raised international alarm. We estimate that, in all 15 countries analyzed, there is at
least a 50% chance the variant was imported by travelers from the United Kingdom by
December 7th.

The United Kingdom (UK) has detected a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 from samples initially
taken in Kent on September 20th and London on September 21st, 2020 (1), which was found
associated with increased transmissibility (2). The UK government tightened measures in
London and southeast England in mid-December to mitigate the transmission of the fastspreading virus variant that includes deletions at amino acid sites 69 and 70 of the spike protein

(3). On January 5th, 2021, England initiated a national lockdown including closure of all schools
and non-essential businesses until mid-February (4). By December 20th, over 40 countries had
implemented travel restrictions on travellers from the UK (5). The new variant was subsequently
reported worldwide, including in the USA (6), Spain, Sweden and France, and might be
spreading without detection in countries with limited virus sequencing capacity (5).

We collected the data from 15 countries and estimated the probability of introduction of this new
variant by travellers from the UK to each of these countries and the extent of local transmission,
based on the changing proportion of the new variant among infections identified in the UK (2)
and population mobility from UK to each country, as estimated from Facebook Data for Good.
Ireland had the highest importation risk between September 22 and December 7, 2020. By
October 22 (a month after its first detection in the UK), 10 of the 15 countries had at least a 50%
chance of receiving one imported case from the UK (Figure 1), except for Romania, Portugal,
Cyprus, India, and United States, while they all had exceeded this risk threshold by November 1.

Using COVID-19 hospital admission data, we further estimated the local prevalence of the new
virus variant in 11 of the 15 countries, assuming that the new variant is 50% more transmissible
than the circulating 501N strain (Figure 1). The variant appears to have ascended fastest in
Ireland before slowing in mid November and is expected to be spreading rapidly in many of the
other countries. As of December 7, Cyprus has the highest expected prevalence of the variant (13
[95% CI: 0-79] cases per 100,000) and Ireland has the highest expected proportion of COVID-19
cases caused by the new variant (6% [95% CI: 0-38%]) (Figures 1, S1 and S2).

These projections suggested that countries with substantial population movement from the UK
were likely to harbor cases of the new variant by late October, 2020. Our conclusions were based
on several key assumptions. The mobility data, which includes ~3 million trips from the UK to
the 15 focal countries, might be demographically biased by the user profile of Facebook, a major
social media company with ~2.7 billion monthly active users in the third quarter of 2020 (7). We
assume that all introductions during this early period occurred via asymptomatic travelers from
the UK and ignore possible importations from other countries or by symptomatic cases traveling
to seek healthcare. A sensitivity analysis suggests that these assumptions may cause a downward

bias in the estimated rates of global expansion (Figure S3). Furthermore, we assume a 10-day lag
between infection and hospitalization based on estimates from the United States (8) and Europe
(9) and estimate the daily prevalence of the new strain using the method introduced in ref. (2),
under the assumptions that the two variants (501Y and 501N) share the same natural history (2)
and symptomatic proportion (10,11). Should future studies reveal significant epidemiological
differences between the variant and wildtype, then these estimates can be readily updated using
the full equations provided in ref. (2).
