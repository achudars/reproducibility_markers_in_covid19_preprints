The role of climate in the population dynamics of COVID-19
remains poorly understood, and a true seasonal signature has
remained elusive. Data from both hemispheres and the second
wave provide opportunities to further examine climatic drivers.
With a statistical method designed to detect transitory associations, we show consistent negative effects of temperature and
absolute humidity at large spatial scales. At finer spatial resolutions we substantiate these connections during the seasonal rise
and fall of COVID-19. Strong disease responses are identified
between 12-18°C for Temperature and 4-12 g/m³ for Absolute
Humidity. These results classify COVID-19 as a seasonal lowtemperature infection, and point to the airborne pathway as an
important contribution to transmission for SARS-CoV-2, with
implications for control measures we discuss.

Introduction
With the periodic influenza pandemics in the 20th century,
the Spanish flu in 1918, the Asian flu in 1957, Hong Kong
flu in 1968, the medical community has been apprehensive
about the emergence of novel pathogens with an extensive
reach in a more connected world (1). Apart from influenza
with its well appreciated ability to mutate (2), the few relative
benign corona viruses have not caused alarm. That was until the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,
SARS-CoV-1 (SARS) in China (3), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (4) with
severe symptoms and high mortality. Both outbreaks were
short-lived and isolation of cases proved sufficient to overcome the restricted ability of these pathogens to transmit between humans. The emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2
with a similar geographic and zoonotic origin as SARS (5)
was declared a pandemic by WHO in February (6) and has
rapidly spread over extensive regions, with morbidity often
overwhelming regional healthcare capacity. So far, over 63
million cases have been recorded, with over 1,4M deaths (7),
and a high mortality, not unlike influenza, in the older age
groups (8).
The initial propagation of COVID-19 emerged in a latitudinal band between 30°N and 50°N with low humidity levels and temperatures between 5°C and 11°C (9), and these
weather sensitivities were reported from China, with absolute humidity (AH) negatively associated with daily death
counts of COVID-19 (10). SARS-CoV-2 further resembled

influenza with respect to its winter appearance. These initial observations suggested SARS-CoV-2 could be a seasonal
disease, a possibility that was not advanced for the short-lived
outbreaks of SARS and MERS. Recent perspectives have reviewed and evaluated the evidence for climate-driven seasonality, indicating contradictory results and confounding effects
of other factors at these early stages of the pandemic (11).
Mathematical modelling further addressed the potential for
seasonality in the population dynamics of COVID-19 by parameterizing a humidity-dependent transmission rate on the
basis of seasonal influenza models and time series data for
other coronaviruses (12). Results indicated an inability of
climate forcing to establish seasonality given the large number of available susceptible, non-immune, individuals fueling
transmission.
At a more mechanistic level, some observations on long
range transmission of SARS in 2003 (13), raised the scope
for aerial transmission and a role of aerosols (3), which would
bypass the short-range control measures that dominate current control response. The intangible connection between
airborne transmission and seasonal transmission has been implicit in the scientific interest that followed the SARS 2003
outbreak, particularly for influenza. Both the nature of seasonality and the plausible significant contribution of airborne
transmission were explored (14–16) and attempts were made
to mechanistically connect temperature, humidity to environmental persistence of bio-aerosols and seasonality. Strikingly, the results of these influenza studies on aerosols are
similar to those of initial SARS-CoV-2 investigations (17),
implying a possible contribution of aerosols to long range
transmission. With the second pandemic wave now underway in the Northern Hemisphere, the question of COVID-19
being a genuine seasonal disease is acute, with implications
for what would be judicial intervention measures.
This second wave makes now possible the further analysis of
climate drivers, in a way that takes advantage of consistent effects across countries and regions, and the rising and waning
phases of the epidemic. Further weight to pattern analyses is
given here by consistency of results across temporal and spatial scales, with a statistical method for transient correlations
that identifies similar variation in time series over localized
windows of time.

Results
To address the association of temperature (T) and absolute
humidity (AH) on the initial phase of the invasion by SARSCov2 and before changes in human behavior and public
health policies came into place, we first considered a measure
of the initial growth rate of cases across countries. For this,
we relied on an estimate of the reproductive number of the
disease, R0 , in the 20 days after the first 20 cases of COVID19 were officially notified for each of 162 countries spanning
5 continents (Fig. 1A, Methods, SI). The global maps for the
climate variables at those corresponding times in each country and for population density are shown in Fig. S1.
A negative relationship is observed between R0 and T, as
well as AH, at the global scale on the basis of linear pairwise regression models (Fig. 1B,C and Fig. S1). Although
these regressions account for 10%-25% of the variance in R0 ,
the two regressions are consistent and statistically significant
(p<0.001), irrespective of the COVID-19 measure employed
(e.g. R0 or cumulative cases; see also sensitivity tests in Fig.
S2).
To address whether the negative relationship with both T and
AH is merely the result of a coincident timing between trends
in epidemic spread and wintertime conditions in temperate
regions, we analysed the evolution of the disease-climate associations locally in time and at several disaggregated spatial scales for groups of countries in all five continents (Fig.
2). To this end, we relied on a statistical method, ScaleDependent Correlation Analysis or SDC, specifically developed to identify similar patterns of variation by means of local or transitory (linear) correlations between two time series given a moving window of time (Methods, and (18–20)).
Application of this analysis to other diseases known to be
climate sensitive has successfully shown that (linear) associations can be discontinuous in time, alternating temporal intervals with high significant correlations and those with low
or non-existent ones(21, 22). Such transient coupling can be
expected in the response of nonlinear systems to an external
driver, especially when the functions relating particular parameters to the driver are themselves nonlinear, so that effects
are more evident in particular ranges of the forcing variable.
SDC is essentially a pattern-recognition tool which allows
one to consider the scale over which to evaluate correlations,
as the window size can be systematically varied to focus for
example on increasingly local patterns of variation.
Figure 2A shows the results of SDC for COVID-19 cases and
T for time windows of two months and a half (e.g. scale of
s=75 days) when grouping countries according to region and
latitude in the two hemispheres. Similar patterns are found
for cases and AH (Fig. S3). Strong negative transient associations are obtained for short time lags between the disease
and climate time series, with consistent patterns worldwide.
Interestingly, the negative relationship is seen during both the
first and second waves of the pandemic, and for both the rising and declining phases, with a break during summertime in
all continents (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3). Transient positive correlations of varying intensity are also detected during the warmer
months across location, which are later discussed. These vary

in intensity and are not consistently high.
To further examine the association patterns, we next considered the reported cases at the smaller spatial scale of individual countries in Europe (Fig. 3 for France, Great Britain,
Italy, Spain and Germany), the first most affected continent
following the emergence of the virus in China. SDC results
show similar transient and negative associations for T and AH
with COVID-19 cases (s=75 days). The negative relationship
occurs largely in synchrony across the different countries, for
the same time intervals during the waning of the first epidemic wave as T and AH rise, and also during the rise of the
second wave in the Fall as T and AH fall, with a break in
between (Fig. 3). For this same temporal window (s=75),
a similar negative relationship holds also for individual regions within three of these highly affected European countries for which data at the higher spatial resolution of individual provinces are available (namely, Lombardy, Thüringen
and Catalonia, Fig. S4). These results are also shown separately for the first and second waves in Lombardy (Fig. S4A),
Thüringen (Fig. S4B) and Catalonia in Spain (Fig. S5C). Locally in time, these associations account for large fractions of
the variability in COVID-19 cases in the three regions (over
80% at scales of s=21 days). Their discontinuity explains
the lower values obtained with the traditional correlation coefficient, since by definition this quantity averages over the
whole length of the time series (20).
We can also inspect how these transient couplings change as
a function of the temporal lag in days between the two time
series. As the magnitude of the change in the climate variable
T or AH increases, the lag tends to shorten (see boxes in Fig.
3B and Fig. S6). This behavior is seen for the direction of
change that is presumably relevant for influencing transmission (increasing T and AH in the fall of the first wave, and
decreasing T and AH in the rise of the second wave). The
shorter lags may reflect a faster speed of community transmission, concomitant with a more intense effect of the meteorological factors.
Zooming in even more locally in time with a window of about
two weeks (s=14), SDC reveals limited intervals of very high
significant correlations at these regional levels for Lombardy
(Italy; Fig. 4) and for Catalonia, Spain (Fig. S7). Intervals
where the climate covariate accounts for over 80-90% of the
variability in cases alternate with complete decoupling between the time series. Interestingly, the strongest negative
associations are observed during the on-going rise of the current second wave in these European regions. Positive associations are weaker and infrequent at this scale.
Finally, we interrogate our results to address the existence
of threshold values in T and AH for the spread of COVID19. To this end, we examine whether intervals of coupling
become more frequent depending on the range of the climate covariate. This behavior would indicate the existence
of a critical range within which responses are heightened,
and conversely outside which the forcing becomes ineffective. A meta-analysis was performed for Italy where detailed
regional data on cases are available. We jointly analysed
all SDC correlations obtained between COVID-19 cases and

each of the climate covariates (T or AH), by pooling together
the results for all the individual regions of Italy (Fig. 5; Fig.
S8; Methods). The resulting distributions in Fig. S8(A,B)
show the proportion of the total possible comparisons (pairs
of time intervals between the two time series) that fall into a
given range of the climate covariate, with those proportions
subdivided into significant positive and negative correlations
(Fig. 5A,B) and including non-significant ones (Fig. S8).
Distributions are also shown for only the positive and negative correlations along the range of climate intervals (Fig.
5A,B), and for the two waves separately (Fig. S9, Fig. S10).
The mode in these distributions indicates preferential intervals for T and AH respectively, where the climate effects are
most evident and beyond which decoupling is likely (12-18
°C and 4-12 g/m³, respectively; Fig. 5C-D). Similar results
are obtained for the first and second waves separately (Fig.
S10).

Discussion
In summary, we observed consistent negative correlations between COVID-19 and weather conditions, T and AH, for
regions and individual countries. This consistency across
scales is observed for the rise of the first wave, its decline
towards the advancing summer in both hemispheres, and the
second wave after the summer. These associations remain
robust and become stronger on finer temporal scales within
countries during the seasonal rise and fall of cases, reflecting
similar patterns of temporal variation between disease incidence and climate factors. The strong correlations become
more frequent where and when seasonal mean temperatures
fall between 12°C - 18°C, and AH levels, between 4g/m312g/m3, conditions that diverge from those observed for the
mid-winter global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (9), suggesting permissive temperatures above 5°C. Our results are also
consistent with earlier studies more limited in scope (23–25).
Taken together, the findings support the existence of strong
external drivers of transmission intensity, as suggested by a
uniform summer recession despite a variety of intervention
measures across countries (26). They also support the view of
COVID-19 as a true seasonal infection, similar in that sense
to the more benign circulating corona viruses (27). Concomitant temporal variation of ecological conditions, human behaviour and disease incidence over the annual cycle can produce true but also spurious correlations with climate parameters (19). Our analyses were formulated to circumvent the
spurious correlations arising from such coincident seasonal
variation, as well as effects of potential confounders. The
global correlation between Ro and climate covariates across
countries specifically considered the timing of initiation of
the first epidemic in each location to avoid the confounding
effects of later interventions. Then, by addressing correlation patterns locally in time and zooming in for finer scales,
the SDC analysis detected time intervals with similar patterns
of variation that are not simply the result of ups and downs
over the seasons or the typical durations of intervention policies. Identification of significant correlations between temporal patterns at different and embedded window lengths is conFontal et al.

sidered an efficient way to infer plausible causality with this
multiscale approach (18, 28). The implemented randomizations indicated that the spurious occurrence of the described
correlations from noisy fluctuations is highly unlikely (e.g.
see Fig. S11). Together with the above-mentioned consistency, these methodological considerations add weight to the
findings.
The problem of co-linearity in climate factors has challenged
the search for environmental drivers of influenza in the past,
and very similar issues now apply to COVID-19. Both T
and AH appear here equally capable of accounting for the
observed COVID-19 variation. It is well-known that rising
air-temperature can contain more water, and for geophysical reasons these two parameters are usually strongly coupled
over extensive spatial scales. Also, both parameters can act
in the same direction in their biological effects. For example, the environmental persistence of an exhaled infectious
virus particle, associated with a small (<5 micron) or a larger
(100 micron) droplet (29), increases under laboratory conditions with lower temperatures and humidity for both influenza (30), SARS (31) and SARS-CoV-2 (32). Although
prolonged environmental survival at lower temperatures applies to most of the viruses that have been studied (33), a
less humid environment shortens the survival for most upper
airway infections such as the rhino- and adeno-viruses that
cause the common cold (34). Importantly, however, these
viruses lack an envelope and are not seasonally defined (35).
In contrast, enveloped viruses, including measles, variola and
varicella are infections reaching the lower airways, prevalent
during the cooler seasons and predominantly or substantially
airborne. It seems plausible that some viruses have adapted
to this phase in the seasonal cycle and their concomitant features of temperature and humidity, ruling out the identification of a single or dominant driver of transmission. Our
results point to SARS-CoV-2 as belonging to this cluster of
viruses.
This membership suggests the importance of airborne transmission even though it has remained controversial so far.
Low humidity levels can reduce the size of bio-aerosols
by evaporation when these cool-weather viruses are exhaled
(36). “Droplet nuclei” smaller than 5 microns in size, can bypass the nasal zone defenses and enter the deeper parts of the
lungs. SARS and SARS-CoV-2 specifically target the ACE-2
protein for cell entry (37) where this protein is most abundant in alveolar tissue (38). During the cooler winter months
in higher latitudes, indoor heating generates a micro-climate
with low levels of RH, a parameter that better reflects the drying power of air than AH. However, both indoor AH and RH
in heated accommodations correspond well with the routinely
measured outdoor AH in colder climates (16), and therefore,
to the gridded climatology used here for this parameter. The
permissive role of low temperatures for the transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 appears to contradict the warm-weather related
transmission of the second wave in the US for July-August
2020 (not shown). The cooled indoor micro-climate during
these months would accommodate transmission, similar to
the many outbreaks observed in the meat-processing plants in

the US (39), South America and Europe (40), where cooled
air is mechanically re-ventilated. The positive correlations
we found for the summer months (e.g. Fig 2) during the seasonal low of cases may too reflect community transmission in
public temperature-controlled buildings such as care homes
(40, 41). They may also result from social clustering and increased contact due to warm weather activities (42). Indeed,
air conditioning in the subtropics was also proposed to explain SARS transmission (31), a situation bearing similarities
with influenza (43). Regardless of explanation, these positive
associations were less frequent overall, and less robust and
weaker when zooming into smaller temporal window sizes.
Weak climate forcing has been proposed to account for pronounced seasonal variation in models for the population dynamics of influenza (44). A formulation of forcing by specific humidity similar to that used in epidemiological models of seasonal influenza (14) has been recently applied to
COVID-19 based on the observed seasonality of other corona
viruses (12, 45). Numerical results suggested that the large
fraction of the population lacking immunity would override
any such environmental forcing, and this “virgin soil” pandemic was projected to continue unabated, throughout the
summer. Weak forcing leading to seasonal dynamics was further proposed (10), and the summer recession interpreted as
a vindication of effective intervention. Our results support
a strong climatic forcing influencing the transmissibility of
COVID-19 despite an ample supply of susceptible hosts.
Public health interventions to curb transmission of COVID19 have focused on reducing the contact rate between people through social distancing, and on handwashing, decontamination of infected surfaces and face-covering. With the
exception of face- covering, these measures have emphasized the significance of short-range transmission, the default assumption on respiratory diseases caused by exhaled
droplets (46) with a restricted spatial range (47). The role of
smaller exhaled droplets that become airborne as bio-aerosols
or “droplet nuclei” for extended periods and may cover long
distances in a viable state, has been proposed for COVID-19
but has remained unresolved (48–51). Seasonality and the
role of low temperatures and associated low humidity, can be
mechanistically linked to viable SARS-CoV-2 aerosols, supporting the significance of the airborne transmission route
implicated in other studies (52). This link warrants an emphasis on “air-hygiene” through improved indoor ventilation
(54)(53) to more effectively intervene in the unfolding pandemic. It also underscores the need to include appropriate
meteorological parameters in the evaluation and planning of
pharmacological and behavioural control measures.

Methods
Data Collection. Data on Covid-19 daily incidence counts

were retrieved from the ECDC dataset (54) for the nationally aggregated data and from the COVID19 Data Hub (55)
for the NUTS2-disaggregated incidence data. National and
regional boundaries were obtained from shapefiles provided
by GISCO services by Eurostat (56). Meteorological data
were retrieved from ERA5 reanalysis through API requests

to the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) (57). We obtained temperature (at 2m), sea level pressure, total precipitation and dew point temperature data for a 0.5x0.5° grid
for the country-wise analysis and at a 0.25x0.25° grid for the
rest. From the 2m and the dew point temperature, we derived
relative humidity, and used the atmos Python package (58) to
calculate absolute humidity.
The Gridded Population of the World (GPWv4), developed
by the Center for International Earth Science Information
Network (CIESIN) at Columbia University, was obtained
from (59) at a 2.5 min resolution. We did not include data
from the USA in our analyses given the large geographical
extension of this country which includes different climatic
zones, and the largely asynchronous implementation of intervention policies across its different states.
Global Statistical Analysis. Our first attempt to identify

plausible effects of meteorological covariates on Covid-19
spread applied a comparative regression analysis. To this end,
we focused on the exponential onset of the disease, as it is the
epidemic phase that allows for a better comparison between
countries or regions, without the confounding effect of intervention policies. We first determined for each of the spatial
units (either countries or NUTS2 regions), the day in which
20 or more cumulative cases were officially reported. We
then fitted the first-order polynomial function f (t) = x0 + rt
for the next 20 days of log-transformed data. The r parameter
can be understood as the exponential growth rate, and is then
used to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0 ) using
the estimated serial interval T for COVID19 of 4.7 days (60)
such that R0 = 1 + rT (61). (We note that we are interested
here in the relationship between the reproductive number and
not in the actual inference of R0 ). Once R0 was obtained
for all our spatial units, we filtered our meteorological data to
match the same fitting period (with a 10-day negative delay to
account for an incubation and reporting lapse) for every spatial unit. To compute a single average of the meteorological
variables per regional unit, we computed a weighted average
on the basis of the population contribution of each grid cell
to the total population of the region. We did so to have an
aggregated value that would better represent the impact of
these factors on the population transmission of COVID19, as
the same variation in weather in a high density urban area
is more likely to contribute to a change in population level
transmission than that of an unpopulated rural area. We then
averaged the daily values of temperature and absolute humidity for each country and computed univariate linear models
for each of these variables as predictors of R0 . Given the
somewhat arbitrary criteria to select the dates to estimate the
R0 in each country, a sensitivity analysis was run to test the
robustness of the regressions to changes in the related parameters. We tested 70 different combinations of two parameters: the total number of days used for the fit (18 to 27), and
the threshold of cumulative COVID19 cases used to select
the initial day of the fit (15 to 45). We also calculated the
weather averages by shifting the selected dates accordingly.
Then, a linear model for each of the estimates was fitted for
both T and AH. A summary of the distribution of parameter

models) is shown in Fig. S2.
Bivariate time series analysis with scale dependent
correlations. To examine associations between cases and

climate factors in more detail, a Scale-dependent Correlation
Analysis (SDC) was performed on the daily time series of
both COVID-19 incidence and a given meteorological variable. SDC is an optimal method for identifying dynamical
couplings in short and noisy time series (see (18, 19)). In
general, Spearman correlations between incidence and a meteorological time series assess whether there is a monotonic
relation between the variables. SDC analysis was specifically
developed to study transitory associations that are local in
time at a specified temporal scale corresponding to the size
of the time intervals considered (s). The two-way implementation (TW-SDC) is a bivariate method that computes nonparametric Spearman rank correlations between two time series, for different pairs of time intervals along these series.
Different window sizes (s) can be used to examine increasingly finer temporal resolution. The results are sensitive to
the value of this window size s, with expected significant and
highest correlation values at the scale of the transient coupling between variables. Correlation values decrease in magnitude as window size increases and averages are computed
over too long a time interval. Values can also decrease and
become non-significant for small windows when correlations
are spurious. Here, the method was applied for windows of
different length (from s=75 to 14 days), and despite a weekly
cycle shows up in some cases for small s, results removing
this cycle were robust. We therefore did not remove this cycle.
Results are displayed in a figure with the following subplots:
(1) the two time series to the left and top of the matrix of
correlation values, respectively; (2) the matrix or grid of correlation values itself in the center, with significant correlations colored in blue when positive and in red when negative,
with rows and columns corresponding to the temporal localization of the moving window along the time series on the
left and top respectively; (3) a time series at the bottom, below this grid, with the highest significant correlations for a
given time (vertically, and therefore, for the variable that acts
as the driver, here the meteorological time series). To read the
results, one starts at the diagonal and moves vertically down
from it to identify a given lag for which significant correlations are found (the closest to the main diagonal). In some
of the SDC figures, the time intervals with high local correlations are highlighted with boxes. These intervals alternate
with other ones left blank for which no significant correlation is found. All colored areas correspond to significance
levels of at least p<0.05. Significance is assessed with a nonparametric randomization test. (see (18) for further details,
and for examples illustrating the method).
Time series approaches do not present the typical problems
of comparative spatial regression studies, which might be biased by uncontrollable confounding effects across spatial locations. Our approach focuses on analyzing temporal associations in one such location at a time, and comparing across

these locations the patterns of association themselves, including their timing (e.g. in the waning or rising phase of epidemic waves). This allows comparison of results among distinct regions, despite differences in control measures and disease epidemic state.
One reason why couplings between two variables in ecological or epidemiological systems may be transient couplings is
the existence of thresholds above or below which responses
to forcing are weak or absent. To interrogate our analyses for
the existence of critical thresholds/ranges for optimal transmission of the virus (inferred from COVID-19 disease outcomes), we pooled all negative and positive significant correlations performed at a size s=21 days between each meteorological variable and COVID-19 cases. We then computed the
proportion of those negative correlations among all possible
correlations for a given fragment size obtained for each bin
of T or AH values and plotted their distribution (e.g. Fig. 5,
Fig. S8 and Fig. S9), for all individual regions in Italy.

Fig. 1. Estimated basic reproduction number (R0 ) during the initial phases of the pandemic for all countries included in the study (n=162). (A) To focus on the initial rise
of the first wave, these estimates are based on the cumulative COVID-19 cases during the first 20 days following the 20th confirmed case in each country (see Methods).
Scatterplots showing the variation of the estimated R0 for the different countries as a function of their average temperatures [°C] (B) and absolute humidities [g/m³] (C) during
the initial phase of the pandemic. Black lines and R2 values correspond to the estimates of an univariate linear model in both cases, fitted by Ordinary Least Squares
(p<0.001 in both cases). Of the 162 countries included globally, the numbers corresponding to each continent are the following: Africa (n=50), Asia & Oceania (n=45), Europe
(n=38), North America (n=16), and South America (n=12). For comparison, the R0 estimates obtained after the first 100 reported cases (rather than 20) are shown in Fig. S1.
Similar spatial patterns are observed. The spatial distribution of average temperatures and absolute humidities, as well as the national weights based on relative population
density, used to compute these averages, are shown in Fig S1(B-D).

COVID19 and Climate

Fig. 2. Two-way Scale-Dependent Correlation (SDC) analyses for the time series of COVID19 daily new cases vs. mean temperature (A) in groups of contiguous countries. These daily climate conditions are weighted averages based
on the relative population of the relevant countries from March to October 2020. The temporal scale or window size s used for the local correlations is 75 days, and the lag between the placement of the windows in the two time series
varies from 0 to 21 days. In the SDC plots, the two time series are shown respectively to the left and top of the central correlation grid, for reported cases with time running down and for the climate factor with time running right. Each
cell of the grid is coloured according to the Spearman correlation coefficient, with the row and column corresponding to the position of the two respective time windows s along each of the time series, with the lag between these position
corresponding to the distances from the diagonal (lag 0 to +21 days). The panel below shows the maximal correlation coefficient obtained at each time point (vertically, and therefore, relative to the time of the climate time series). Only
correlations found as significant in a non-parametric randomized test (α=0.05) are shown and colored. Red (blue) points in the grid correspond to negative (positive) correlations, according to the specified scale (top right).

Fig. 3. Panels from SDC analysis for the maximum absolute correlations between daily time series for the meteorological variable (AH, left; T, right) and COVID-19 new
cases, as a function of time (the position of the local window of time). These panels correspond to those shown below the SDC grid of local correlations in Figure 2, but here
at the country level for 5 European countries (Germany, France, Italy, Spain and UK). As before, s=75, and the maximum correlation is chosen for lags from 0 to 21 days.
The colors correspond to maximum negative (red) and positive (blue) correlations for each day. Resulting maximum correlations for the Spanish region of Catalonia with the
corresponding time lag indicated (B). This dominant lag (the one for the maximum ρ value among the significant comparisons between a lag 0 and +21 days) is overlaid on the
temperature time series for each time point, with shorter lags being represented with lighter colours and longer lags with darker ones. The fragment size (s) used in this panel
is 21 days, which allows us to localize and identify multiple shorter transient couplings between COVID19 incidence and meteorological factors. C) Idem as B) but for the
Italian region of Lombardy. Similar figures for the German region of Thüringen can be found in Fig. S6. Note that in panels B and C when the meteorological factor appears
to be more related to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the spread of COVID-19 in the population, the lag shortens, indicating a more intense and fast association.

Fig. 4. Short-term transient correlations over time intervals of two weeks at the spatial resolution of region, here for Lombardy in Italy. As for Figure 2, the graphical results
of SDC analysis are shown for the correlations between daily Covid19 cases and T (top row) or AH (bottom row) and for the different parts of the pandemic. Here, a smaller
window size is used (s=14 days) to examine even shorter-term transient associations. The left side panels (A, C) showcase the results for the waning phase of the first wave
(from late February to July), and the right side panels (B, D), those for the rising phase of the second wave (from August to late October). The time intervals of significant
correlations are indicated with boxes within the central grid, with the corresponding timings in the two time series highlighted with red arrows for the meteorological factor, and
with black ones for the response variable, the COVID-19 cases. The pairs of arrows for a given box show clear patterns of opposite temporal change (negative correlation)
in the climate and epidemiological variables. For clarity, in this case the bottom panels below each plot show only the maximum negative correlation values obtained as the
analysis window is slided in time (with red dots indicating negative correlations).

Fig. 5. Frequency distribution of negative and positive correlations as a function of range of the climate covariate, for temperature (A) and absolute humidity (B). The frequency
of windows with negative (or positive) correlations is obtained from SDC analysis of COVID19 cases and the given climate factor in all italian regions (n=20) (for s=21 days).
The distributions are non-uniform with a mode in a particular range of the climate variables. This is indicative of a nonlinear relationship where the negative associations are
most likely to be observed in a particular meteorological range. The bottom panels show this same frequency distribution but across the different italian regions (C,D). As it
can be seen, there is an overrepresentation of significant negative monotonic relationships in temperate conditions (AH [4-12] g/m³, T [12-18] °C).

Spain (Catalonia), and their daily population density-weighted averages of (A) T and (B) AH from March to October 2020. In the figures, each cell of the grid is coloured according to the Spearman correlation coefficient for two s-day
centred windows for each of the time series, with distances from the diagonal indicating the temporal lag across the two time series compared. Panels above and left display the time series and panels below show the maximum correlation
coefficient obtained for each data point in time. Only those comparisons with a significant p-value at an α=0.05 from a non-parametric randomized test are shown.

Fig. S 5: SDC analyses performed at a high temporospatial resolution. The time series are broken down in two intervals: from March to June 2020 to represent the first wave
(left), and from August to October 2020 to represent the second wave (right). Fragment sizes used in these analyses are s=21 days, which allows to identify multiple short-term
transient couplings between the COVID19 incidence and meteorological factors. Three subnational regions are shown (A-Lombardy in Italy, B-Thüringen in Germany and, CCatalonia in Spain).

Fig. S 11: Line plot showing the smallest value of Spearman ρ which yields a significant estimate (at α=.05) as a function of the fragment size s when running a non-parametric
permutation test. Here, the permutation test computes the Spearman coefficient ρ between two white noise time series, with each permutation randomly shifting the indices
of the series, breaking their temporal shape. This permutation test enables to estimate the probability of finding spurious significant correlations, and can thus be used as a
non-parametric test of significance for pairs of time series of interest. The threshold decays rapidly as the fragment size grows, with high ρ values being rarer the longer the
time series compared. As indicated by the colour of each line, estimation of the significance threshold becomes more stable as the number of permutations used to estimate
it increases.
