Abstract

Objective
To assess the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in
healthcare workers and subsequent transmission to their close contacts within their
household. To assess changes in immunoglobulin (Ig) and neutralising antibodies (nAbs)
in exposed participants.

Setting
Two acute National Health Service (NHS) hospitals within the East Midlands region of
England.

Background
The UK has been one of the most severely affected countries during the COVID-19
pandemic. Transmission from healthcare workers to the wider community is a potential
major vector for spread of SARS-CoV-2 which is not well described in the current
literature.

Methods
Healthcare workers (HCW) were recruited from two Hospitals within the East Midlands of
England and underwent serial blood sampling for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (both
nucleocapsid and spike protein for IgG, IgM and IgA) between 20 April and 30 July 2020,
with the presence of neutralising antibodies (nAbs) assessed for positive participants.
Cohabitees of the volunteers were invited to attend testing in July -August 2020 and
underwent identical serological testing as the HCWs.

Results
633 healthcare professionals were recruited. 178 household contacts of 137
professionals volunteered for the study. 18% of healthcare professionals (115 out of
633) tested as seropositive during the study period, compared to an estimated
seroprevalence of 7% within the general population. The rate of symptomatic COVID-19
was 27.5% compared to an asymptomatic rate of 15.1%. Rates of positivity declined
across the study period for all immunoglobulins (overall positivity from 16.7% to 6.9%).
7.2% of the cohabitees tested as seropositive. 58 cohabitees lived with a serologically
positive HCW; this group had a seropositive rate of 15.5%, compared to 2.5% of
cohabitees without a seropositive HCW, a six-fold increase in risk (Odds ratio 7.16 95%
CI 1.86 to 27.59), p = 0.0025). Given the observed decay rates and data from Public
Health England, we estimate that the proportion of seropositive cohabitees living with a
seropositive HCW at the height of the first wave could have been as high as 44%.
110 out of 115 (95.7%) HCWs and 12 out of 13 (92.3%) cohabitees who tested positive
developed detectable nAbs. 56.5% (65 out of 115) of SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs
developed a neutralising titre with an IC501/300; no cohabitee achieved this level..

Conclusions
Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare professionals and their home contacts
appears to be a significant factor of viral transmission, but, even accounting for the
decline in seropositivity over time, less than 44% of adult cohabitees of seropositive
healthcare workers became seropositive. Routine screening and priority vaccination of
both healthcare professionals and their close contacts should be implemented to reduce
viral transmission from hospitals to the community.

SUMMARY BOXES
Section 1: What is already known on this topic
 Healthcare workers (HCWs) have increased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the
general population due, at least in part, to high levels of occupational exposure.
 IgA, IgM and IgG are detectable for most patients after 11 days post SARS-CoV-2 infection but
all decline in the weeks following SAR-CoV-2 exposure.
 Rates of transmission to healthcare workers, and therefore subsequent transmission to their
close contacts, may be reduced with effective PPE.
Section 2: What this study adds





The amount of neutralising antibodies formed may be dependent on IgG response as it is
much lower among seropositive cohabitees than seropositive healthcare workers.
NHS Healthcare workers had a far greater seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared
to the general population.
Cohabitees of positive healthcare workers have a 6-fold increased risk of developing
serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population.
Despite this increased risk, transmission at home is less than 50% even from highly exposed
healthcare workers, but remains an important potential vector of transmission from hospitals
to the wider community.

Research into context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published between January 1 2020 and January 27, 2021 with the
terms “Covid-19”, “healthcare workers”, and “transmission” “home {NOT nursing} or household”. We
did not restrict our search by language or type of publication. We identified 38 studies of which only
one assessed the prevalence among HCW households using Canadian national databases. Our
PubMed search yielded only one serological study within the German Healthcare system, which
suggested very low transmission from healthcare workers to their close cohabitees.

Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the largest longitudinal serological cohort study assessing transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 infection from the UK healthcare environment to the home (n = 633 healthcare workers,
178 cohabitees). Our findings showed that serological evidence within the HCW was high with 18% of
healthcare professionals (115 out of 633) tested as seropositive during the study period, compared to
an estimated seroprevalence of 7% within the general population. A cohabitee of a seropositive HCW
had a six-fold increase of being seropositive themselves compared to a baseline rate of 2.5%. Despite
this increased risk, transmission at home is less than 50% even from highly exposed healthcare
workers, but remains an important potential vector of transmission from hospitals to the wider
community. Rates of positivity declined across the study period for all immunoglobulins (overall
positivity from 16.7% to 6.9%). Given the observed decay rates and data from Public Health England,
we estimate that the proportion of seropositive cohabitees living with a seropositive HCW at the
height of the first wave could have been as high as 44%.

Implications of all available evidence
Understanding the transmission during the first wave from the healthcare setting into the home and
the extent of such transmissions is essential to understand containment strategies of novel SARS-CoV2 variants or to understand viral transmission of future respiratory viruses. NHS workers appeared to
be at an increased risk of contracting of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the HCWs of other nations;
we hypothesise that this may be related to a scarcity of appropriate personal protective equipment
during the initial wave of SARS-CoV-2. Healthcare workers (HCWs) have increased rates of SARS-CoV2 infection compared with the general population. An infected HCW, whether symptomatic or not,
appears to be a significant bridge for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to their close home contacts.

Background
The United Kingdom (UK) has been severely affected by both the first and current
second wave of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which
causes COVID-191.
The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly considered to occur via person-to-person
close contact by droplet infection 2. Front line healthcare workers (HCWs) responding to
the current pandemic have many more close contacts with potential COVID-19 patients
and so are at an elevated risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to the general
population 3. Published studies suggest that front-line healthcare workers could account
for up to 20% of all COVID-19 diagnoses 4 5. A lack of adequate personal protection
equipment (PPE) and delays in setting up an effective contact tracing system during the
first wave of the pandemic may also contribute to this increased risk 6 7.
Current UK guidelines advise household contacts to isolate within the same home as the
index case for 10 days following a positive test8. Despite guidance advising household
members to socially distance, cohabitees of the affected household are likely to interact
repeatedly, including in the use of shared facilities such as bathrooms or kitchens, and
therefore be exposed to potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission9. Household cohabitees
make up the majority of close contacts for infected individuals and may account for up to
70% of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions when widespread community measures, such as local
lockdowns, are in place 10. As healthcare providers are designed as key workers who
attend their job despite COVID-19 restrictions, asymptomatic transmission within this
group may also undermine the effects of nationally instituted “lock-downs”. Hospitals,
healthcare workers and their cohabitees may therefore provide an ongoing reservoir of
SARS-CoV-2 infection 3 11.
Studies assessing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have so far focused on symptom trackers
and single serology samples 12. However, these studies may miss asymptomatic
infections. Few prospective longitudinal serological studies of healthcare workers have
been performed to date.
The primary aim of this study was to assess rates of both symptomatic and
asymptomatic seropositivity within a patient-facing healthcare worker (HCW) population
and subsequent transmission from HCW to their household cohabitees. The longitudinal
design of the study also allowed for the characterisation of Ig response and formation of
neutralising antibodies during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2.

Methods

Recruitment
The PANdemic Tracking of Healthcare workers (Panther) prospective cohort began in
April 2020. Between April 24th and July 10th 2020, patient-facing healthcare professionals
were recruited from the Queen’s Medical Centre and City Hospital located in Nottingham,
UK and formed the “Healthcare workers Cohort”. Participants included asymptomatic
healthcare workers and support staff working at these hospitals who were required to
complete a health questionnaire (attached as a Supplementary file) and provide blood
samples at 9 study visits (baseline, weeks 1 ,2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and at month 4 and month
6 following recruitment). All participants provided written informed consent prior to
completing the questionnaire and providing blood samples. Blood samples at each visit
was collected using BD Serum Separator Tubes (SST-II) for serum. PAX gene Vacutainer

tubes for RNA and EDTA tubes for DNA were collected at baseline. Bloods collected for
serum were processed within 30 minutes of collection and stored at -80C until further
analysis. Bloods for RNA and DNA extractions were collected and stored immediately at 20C for the first 24 hours and then transferred to -80C. Our study website
(https://pantherstudy.org.uk/) was primarily developed as the gateway to increase
participation rate by providing background information on the aims and objectives of the
study and how participants could enrol into the study.
In September 2020, study participants were invited to bring their household contacts
(aged over 18) for a single blood sample. These participants were invited at the earliest
opportunity when they could safely attend the hospital for blood testing. These recruits
formed the “Household contacts” cohort.
The PANTHER protocol is available online (www.pantherstudy.org.uk). Samples were
collected and stored under a Human Tissue Authority licence in Nottingham Tissue Bank
(Licence number: 11035). The study protocol was approved by North West - Greater
Manchester South Research Ethics Committee (reference 20/NW/0395).

Serological processing

Anti-S1 and anti-nucleocapsid ELISA
Serum samples were serially diluted in 3% skimmed milk powder in PBS containing
0.05% Tween 20 and 0.05% sodium azide. All assays were performed on Biotek
Precision liquid handling robots in a class II microbiological safety cabinet. For endpoint
dilution ELISAs, sera were progressively 4-fold diluted from 1:150 to 1;38,400. ELISA
was performed by coating 384 well Maxisorp (NUNC) assay plates with either 20 µL per
well of 0.5 µg.mL-1 of Wuhan strain SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (His tagged,
HEK293 expressed; Sino Biological) or SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (His Tagged,
baculovirus expressed; Sino Biological) in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (CBC; Merck), or
human IgG at 1 µg.mL-1 in CBC buffer as controls. Plates were sealed with foil film and
incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were then washed with PBS with 0.05% Tween 20
(PBS-T) 3 times using a ThermoFisher Wellwash Versa plate washing robot. Wells were
immediately filled with 100 µL of 3% skimmed milk powder (w/v) in PBS and 0.05%
sodium azide (PBS-MA) and blocked overnight at 4 °C. Assay plates were then washed 3
times and 20 µL of pre-diluted serum sample (including SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive
and negative serum controls) added in duplicate wells. After one hour at 21 °C, the plate
was washed 3 times in PBS-T, followed by addition of 20 µL of gamma chain-specific
anti-human IgG-HRP conjugate (Sigma A0170-1ML) at 1:30,000 dilution, incubating for
one hour at 21 °C. Following a final three washes with PBST, 40 µL One-step UltraTMB
substrate solution (ThermoScientific) was added to each well. After incubating for 20
minutes at room temperature, 40 µL of 2N H2SO4 was added to each well and
Absorbance was measured at 450nm using a GlowMax Explorer microplate reader
(Promega).

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype neutralization assay
Participants found to be seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 were assessed for the presence of
neutralising antibodies. The latest positive time point was utilised for each participant for
neutralising antibody assays to standardise results in evolving immunity. Human
Embryonic Kidney 293T and VeroE6 cell lines were purchased from ECACC. Both cell

lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM; Invitrogen),
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 0.1mM nonessential amino
acids (GIBCO) at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cell lines were tested to verify the absence of
mycoplasma. No assays were performed to verify the identity of the cells in culture
following receipt of the cells.
Pseudotypes were produced as previously described 13. Briefly, 1.5 × 106 HEK293T cells
were seeded overnight in a 10 cm diameter Primaria-coated dish (Corning).
Transfections were performed by mixing 2 µg of murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag-Pol
packaging vector (phCMV-5349), 2 µg of luciferase encoding reporter plasmid (pTG126)
and 2 µg Wuhan strain SARS-CoV-2 spike plasmid with 24 µL polyethylenimine
(Polysciences) in Optimem (Gibco). Mixtures were added to cells for 6 hours, after which
they were replaced with complete DMEM. A no-envelope control (nude pseudotype) was
used as a negative control in all experiments. Supernatants containing SARS-CoV-2
pseudotype viruses (pv) were harvested 72 h post-transfection and filtered through 0.45
μm membranes. For infectivity and neutralization testing of SARS-CoV-2 pv, 2 × 104
VeroE6 cells/well were plated in white 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning) and
incubated overnight at 37 °C. The following day, SARS-CoV-2 pv-containing
supernatants were incubated with 1/300 dilution of sera (pre-treated with 1% Triton X100/heat-inactivated for 1 hr at RT), before being added to VeroE6 cells for 4 h. Infection
inocula were then discarded and 200 µL DMEM added to the cells. After 72 h, media was
discarded, cells lysed with cell lysis buffer (Promega) and relative luciferase activity (in
RLU) measured using a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech). Each sample was
tested in triplicate.

Statistical analysis
Univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression was performed to identify covariables contributing to a positive sample. The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)
decile for their geographical area was assigned using the participant’s post code. Other
variables for adjustment include age, sex, ethnicity, symptoms of COVID-19 and job
role. Participants were classified as seropositive if they had a positive titre to either the
NC or the S1 protein at any of the time-points sampled. Participants were classified as
having reported symptoms if at any time point during the period of assessment if they
complained of a symptom attributable to suspected viral infection (headaches, fever,
cough, loss of sense of smell or taste, fatigue, difficulty breathing) or they had to selfisolate with suspected COVID-19. Estimates of seroprevalence for the general population
were obtained using data from Public Health England14]. Seropositive cohabitees with a
negative HCW were used as a “control” to estimate the likely decay in positivity and the
likely “true” rate of cohabitee infection earlier during the pandemic.
Neutralising antibodies were stratified based on achieving a neutralising percentage of
50% or greater at 1/300 dilution. The relationship with peak IgG, IgA or IgM and
neutralisation percentage was assessed using multiple linear regression, and predictors
influencing neutralisation percentage was assessed using binary multivariable logistic
regression / multiple linear regression. Lastly, neutralising percentages were correlated
between HCWs and cohabitees using Spearman’s rho.
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Version 24. A p value of <0.05 was
deemed statistically significant. Figures were produced using Graphpad Prism version 8.

Sample

633 healthcare professionals (HCWs) were recruited across the two acute hospitals. 178
household contacts from 137 HCWs volunteered for the study. The recruitment is shown
in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Study recruitment, seropositivity and estimated seropositivity of population of
the Midlands 14. (see end of manuscript).

22 HCWs (3.48%) reported testing positive on a nasal swab COVID PCR either during
the study period or immediately before. HCWs inviting their contacts to attend the study
had a greater rate of seropositivity, with a rate of 37%. The cohabitee contacts had an
overall 7.2% seropositivity. Of the 58 cohabitees of seropositive HCW had a seropositive
rate of 15.5%, compared to 2.5% of cohabitees without a seropositive HCW (p =
0.0025, Fishers Exact). While 12 out of 13 samples demonstrated detectable neutralising
antibodies, no cohabitee displayed neutralising antibodies of greater than 50%.
No participant required hospital treatment for COVID-19 during the study, however the
spouse of one participant died of COVID-19 before the start of the study. The
demographic characteristics of the cohorts are summarized in table 1.

Serology
Overall, 18% of healthcare professionals (115 out of 633) tested as seropositive during
the study period. 149 participants reported symptoms consistent with a viral infection;
41 had serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infected (27.5%). The rate of SARS-CoV-2
for HCWs without symptoms was 15.1% (73 out of 484). There was considerable
variability within the exact immunoglobulin response generated by the participants after
exposure to SARS-CoV-2. While the total number of people who had serological evidence
of SARS-CoV-2 increased during the study period, rates of IgG, IgM and IgA positivity all
showed significant decay, as shown in Figure 2.

110 out of 114 (96.5%) HCWs who had tested positive for any immunoglobulin had
detectable neutralising antibodies at least two months following seropositivity. With our
threshold of 50% neutralisation at a 1:300 triton dilution 57% (65 out of 114) of SARSCoV-2 positive participants developed an effective neutralising antibody response.
Univariate analysis suggested that a higher peak of IgM Spike protein was associated
with an increased chance of a sustained neutralising percentage of greater than 50%;
this was not significant after multivariable adjustment (see figure 3).
Multiple linear regression was carried out to investigate whether peak spike protein Ig
and ethnicity could significantly predict levels of neutralising antibodies. The results of
the regression indicated that the model explained only 22.7% of variance and that the
model was a significant predictor of neutralising antibody status, F =3.22, p = 0.021.
Only peak IgG and white ethnicity contributed significantly to the model (see figure 4).

Association with % neutralization (β coefficient)

While regression modelling suggested a potential link between peak IgG and neutralising
antibodies, several volunteers who had a high and sustained IgG response did not go on
mount a neutralisation response of 50% or greater at 1/300 dilution (see figure 5).

178 household contacts from 137 HCWs volunteered for the study. HCWs inviting their
contacts to attend the study had a greater rate of seropositivity, with a rate of 37%. The
cohabitee contacts had an overall 7.2% seropositivity. Of the 58 cohabitees of
seropositive HCW had a seropositive rate of 16%, compared to 2.5% of cohabitees
without a seropositive HCW (p = 0.0025, Fishers Exact). This represents a six-fold
increase in risk (unadjusted Odds ratio 7.16 95% CI 1.86 to 27.59, p = 0.0025, adjusted
OR for ethnicity 6.86, CI 1.74 to 27.02).
While 12 out of 13 samples demonstrated detectable neutralising antibodies, no
cohabitee displayed neutralising antibodies of greater than 50% (see figure 6). There
was no strong correlation in neutralising antibody percentage between paired HCWs and
cohabitees (Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient 0.311, p=0.301).

Discussion

Healthcare worker and cohabitee SARS-CoV-2 infection
Health care workers are at an elevated risk of infection as they work on the frontline of
the response to the current pandemic. This study found that 18% of healthcare workers
had antibody evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is higher than the estimated
seropositive rate of the overall Midlands population during the same time period, which
was between 6.5 and 7.2% throughout our study period15. Currently, few longitudinal
serological studies of HCWs have published. Behrens et al and Herzberg et al found a
lower serological rate of infection within German HCWs of between 1.8% and 4%
respectively, which was attributed to effective infection control protocols 16 17. Consistent
use of appropriate PPE has been shown to reduce the risk of transmission to healthcare
workers when caring for an infectious patient 18. This may explain why ITU staff in our
study (2.7% vs 19.1%, RR 0.1418 95% CI 0.0204 to 0.9869, p 0.0485) had a lower risk
of infection, as higher rated PPE was initially recommended for these areas compared to
a standard ward. Shortages of masks and inadequate PPE within the NHS during the first
wave of COVID-19 were well documented may have contributed to the increased

seropositivity of healthcare workers and turned hospitals into reservoirs of potential
nosocomial infection19.
While transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households is known to be high, few studies
have assessed the particular risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to family members of
health care workers 9. Lorenzo et al 20 found 32.1% of tested family members of
healthcare workers were positive for SARS-CoV-2, compared to only 5.3% healthcare
workers. They concluded that family members were a greater transmission risk than
healthcare professionals. Our study found the opposite, with cohabitees with a positive
HCW contact being six times more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, compared to those
without. This suggests that the infection control policies in place at the time were failing
to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the hospital to the wider community.
We were only able to invite cohabitees to attend blood sampling at the end of the
national lockdown. As a result of the observed decay in Ig seropositivity seen in the
healthcare workers, we have likely underestimated the true rate of SARS-CoV-2
transmission to cohabitees. Using an assumed 2.84 fold decrease in Ig positivity (from
an estimated 7% prevalence within the general population during the early phase of the
study to the 2.5% rate seen in our “control” cohabitees), we can estimate that the true
proportion of positive cohabitees living with a seropositive HCW at the height of the first
wave could have been as high 44%.
There was no significant difference in the mean neutralising percentage for participants
with symptoms compared to asymptomatic (55.58% vs 51.55%, p =0.405, Independent
Samples T Test).
In total, there were 56 seropositive HCWs whose cohabitees donated a serum sample. Of
these, nine had a seropositive cohabitee and 47 had one or more seronegative
cohabitees. We found no significant differences in the levels of neutralization between
those seropositive HCWs who presumably transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to their cohabitee
(52.8% neutralization (95% CI 46-143%)) and those whose cohabitees remained
seronegative (48.9% (95%CI 32-111%)).
A higher proportion of individuals reported COVID-19 symptoms among the seropositive
HCW whose cohabitees seroconverted (55.6 % (95%CI 27-81%)) than those whose
cohabitees remained seronegative (37.5% (95%CI 25-52%)) but the difference did not
achieve statistical significance.
Based on our study findings, we would recommend that both HCWs and their cohabitees
are included in early vaccination programmes when they are available. Universal
screening of healthcare workers may also be beneficial. Apart from the cost and
manpower implications of this, the current swabs have a false negative rate of between
2 and 33%21. While the majority of COVID-19 cases were symptomatic, the majority of
people with symptoms were not seropositive. As the majority of participants that
reported symptoms were not COVID-19 positive, excluding them from a caring role on
symptoms alone would deprive the NHS of staff needlessly during a time of increased
resource need.

Serological response to SARS-CoV-2
Due to the only recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, our understanding of antibody
responses and its clinical implications with regards to possible immunity following repeat
exposure is limited. The longitudinal nature of our study allowed for the assessment of
the seroconversion event after exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Our study demonstrates

reasonable rates of antibody formation despite many of the participants being
asymptomatic. Our study demonstrated a decay in rates of IgG, IgA and IgM in positive
participants. Rates of IgG, IgA and IgM were similar.
Promisingly, the majority, but not all, of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2
developed measurable neutralising antibodies several weeks after their initial exposure.
While the vast majority of positive cohabitees had detectable neutralising antibodies, no
cohabitee mounted a neutralising response of over 50% compared to over half of the
HCWs. It is probable that the level of neutralising antibodies fell with time, as the
cohabitees were tested for neutralising antibodies approximately two months after most
of the HCWs. Wajainberg et al found that 90% of patients who were positive at 1:320
mounted a detectable neutralising antibody response for at least 3 to 5 months at
identical titres to our study after contracting SARS-CoV-222. We still do not know the
required neutralising response to provide longstanding immunity from recurrent SARSCoV-2 infection. Animal models have suggested protection is gained from SARS-CoV-2 if
neutralising antibodies are able to neutralize 50% of the virus at a serum concentration
of 1:200 23; further work is required to delineate the response needed to provide
immunity in humans.
Peak levels of IgG (spike protein) and white ethnicity may be associated with increasing
levels of neutralising antibodies. We were however unable to demonstrate a significant
predictor of who goes on to develop a substantial neutralising antibody response of over
50%. We found variation in antibody response between participants, with some
participants with a high and sustained antibody titre failing to develop a correspondingly
high neutralisation titre. The current global vaccination programmes could provide a
further opportunity to assess who develops long-term neutralisation antibodies. While
long-term data is lacking, the presence of neutralising antibodies does appear to decline
by three months post exposure 24. Long term data regarding potential immunity
following exposure, including the long term efficacy of the current vaccinations being
deployed, remains lacking 25. Further work will be urgently needed establish how long
this response lasts, and whether this translates to immunity from repeat SARS-CoV-2
infection.

Risk factors for seropositivity
The evidence defining who is at the greatest risk of contracting and suffering a negative
outcome from COVID-19 is rapidly expanding, with both environmental, viral and patient
factors being reported26 27. The majority of studies have focused on patients and
healthcare workers with serious infections requiring hospitalisation, or focused on
population level data relying on positive swabs3. Few studies have described the
incidence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 within healthcare workers and their close
contacts using serological data. Other studies have demonstrated risk factors for
developing a more severe COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalisation. Identified risk
factors for negative outcomes have included black ethnicity, age and male gender28. In
our study participants presented were largely either asymptomatic or had minimal
symptoms. We identified that participants of a black ethnic background were at an
increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, independent of social deprivation, gender,
age, medical comorbidities and ITU role. This supports the observation that NHS workers
of an ethnic minority background are at an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 29.

Limitations

There are limitations to this study. A major drawback in terms of assessing the factors
affecting transmission is the number of seropositive cohabitees, i.e., putative
transmission events. Although we found a considerably larger proportion (55.6%) of
symptomatic seropositive HCW has seropositive cohabitees than those who had
seronegative cohabitees (37.5%) there are only n=9 pairs where both the HCW and
cohabitee were seropositive. This highlights the need for larger HCW-cohabitee pair
studies to investigate the risks of transmission. In addition, no single assay has perfect
sensitivity and specificity30. Few participants had tested positive on nasal SARS-CoV-2
PCR. Routine screening of staff members was not in force during the study period so our
results could not be compared to swab or other independently collected results. Our
cohort was largely asymptomatic or had low-level symptoms; further study is needed to
confirm the generalisability of our results to patients with more severe cases of COVID19. The cohabitee cohort also only donated a single sample. We were therefore unable to
confirm the direction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission as it is possible that the positive
cohabitees actually transmitted the virus to the HCW. This raises an additional risk of
viral spread, as healthcare workers infected by their cohabitees may transmit the virus
into “green” COVID-19 free areas of the hospital. In addition, as the single blood sample
was taken later in the study for the cohabitees; based on the observed decay of
immunoglobulin levels seen in our study, it is possible that a greater proportion of
cohabitees were seropositive earlier during the first wave of the pandemic. We have
generated a range of estimates for the likely “true” rate of cohabitee seroprevalence
taking into account the observed decay in Ig levels seen in both the healthcare worker
cohort and in other studies31. Lastly, other immunity pathways may contribute towards
immunity to recurrent infection. Further work on the cohort will include assessment of Tlymphocytes and genotyping of both seropositive and seronegative participants.

Conclusion
Healthcare workers and their cohabitees appear to be an important factor for
transmission from hospital to the community. As asymptomatic transmission was
common, these groups should be viewed as a priority for regular screening and
vaccination.
