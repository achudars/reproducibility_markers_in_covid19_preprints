ABSTRACT
Objective: To describe the clinical profile and factors leading to increased mortality in
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients admitted to a group of hospitals in India.
Design: A records-based study of the first 1000 patients with a positive result on real-time
reverse transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay for SARS-CoV-2 admitted to our
facilities. Various factors such as demographics, presenting symptoms, co-morbidities, ICU
admission, oxygen requirement and ventilator therapy were studied.
Results: Of the 1000 patients, 24 patients were excluded due to lack of sufficient data. Of the
remaining 976 in the early phase of the epidemic, males were admitted twice as much as
females (67.1% and 32.9%, respectively). Mortality in this initial phase was 10.6% and
slightly higher for males and steeply higher for older patients. More than 8% reported no
symptoms and the most common presenting symptoms were fever (78.3%), productive cough
(37.2%), and dyspnea (30.64%). More than one-half (53.6%) had no co-morbidity. The major
co-morbidities were hypertension (23.7%), diabetes without (15.4%), and with complications
(9.6%). The co-morbidities were associated with higher ICU admissions, greater use of
ventilators as well as higher mortality. A total of 29.9% were admitted to the ICU, with a
mortality rate of 32.2%. Mortality was steeply higher in those requiring ventilator support
(55.4%) versus those who never required ventilation (1.4%). The total duration of hospital
stay was just a day longer in patients admitted to the ICU than those who remained in wards.
Conclusion: Male patients above the age of 60 and with co-morbidities faced the highest
rates of mortality. They should be admitted to the hospital in early stage of the disease and
given aggressive treatment to help reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with
COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
An unprecedented disease hit the world some time ago. The World Health Organization
(WHO) declared this a corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic on 11th March 2020. It
has affected over 21,756,357 and killed 771,635 people by 19/08/2020(1) when this report
was prepared Many hospitals are now flooded with patients suffering from the COVID-19,
presenting with a wide array of symptoms ranging from fever and respiratory distress to
gastrointestinal symptoms. The death count been rapidly rising though the level (5.6%) has
not reached the infliction by the other members of the coronavirus family causing human
illnesses such SARS (13%) and MERS (35%)(2).However, COVID is far more transmissible
with an estimated reproduction number (R0) 3.32. (3)
India too now is in the grip of the pandemic and, in terms of absolute numbers, the 3rd worst
affected country after USA and Brazil. Early countrywide lockdown helped in delaying the
spread and shift the peak, and gave time to create infrastructure to face the surge. Despite this
a total of 2,768,670 cases and 53,026 deaths have been reported in India as of 19/08/2020 (4).
This enormous number has overwhelmed the medical system and has resulted in shortages of
medical equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE) (5,6,7). Many hospitals across the
country were designated as COVID-19 hospitals. Some hospitals in our group were
recognized as official sites for managing COVID-19 patients on 27/03/2020 when the disease
started to occur in the epidemic proportion in India. Multiple changes were made since then
in our infrastructure to accommodate the large inflow of the cases.
Despite the swift spread and the rapidly increasing number of people getting affected, the
complete clinical course of this disease is still unclear for Indian patients. Reports describing
demographics, clinical characteristics, hospital course, morbidity, and mortality in patients in
the Indian setting have been published (8,9,10) but they are based on limited numbers of cases.
We report a relatively large study of 1000 patients with known outcome to better understand
the disease process and progression of COVID-19 cases, and to study the factors affecting the
outcome. This may help in triaging the rapid rise of patients and streamlining resources for
better management of cases with optimal efficiency and better outcomes.

Study Design and Population
This is a multi-center, record based, observational study of patients admitted to 5 multispecialty hospitals across Delhi and Mumbai that are designated as COVID-19 hospitals by
the State Governments. All these are private hospitals and cater to generally well-to-do
sections of the society. Over 7000 patients have been admitted to these hospitals till the
middle of August 2020. We retrieved electronic and paper based medical records for the first
1000 hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. These were
admitted between 1st April 2020 and 31st May 2020.
The inclusion criteria were defined as:
1) Positive result on real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RTPCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens for Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
2) Age > 18 years.
3) Closed cases with known outcome.
The Government testing guidelines changed twice during our study and has been mentioned
in Box 1 for record. Although most of the mild cases now are being asked to home
quarantine, at the time of this study, many with a positive RT-PCR were unable to quarantine
and were admitted in the hospital. This the study includes mild as well as moderate and
severe cases. The classification of cases into these different categories was based on the
characteristics given in Box 2.
Data Collection
The extracted data included basic demographics (age and gender), symptoms, co-morbidities,
admission pathway (ward or ICU), treatment, transfer to ICU, oxygen therapy, ventilator
requirement, duration of hospitalization, and the outcome. The study investigators checked
the collected data independently. A separate dedicated quality control abstractor reviewed
records with missing data or with inconsistent values and did corrections as much as possible.
The signs and symptoms included those seen in influenza-like illness (ILI)(11), pneumonia
(chest pain, dyspnea, wheezing, lower chest wall in drawing, history of TB), gastroenteritis
(nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea), ear pain, altered consciousness, and seizures.
The co-morbidities included hypertension (HTN), diabetes with and without complications,
obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), moderate or severe liver disease, asthma, chronic
pulmonary disease other than asthma, and chronic cardiac disease including congenital
anomalies but excluding HTN. We also analyzed the outcome based on the route of
admission (ICU or ward), oxygen therapy and ventilator requirement.

Statistical Analysis
The primary end point was death or discharged alive. The collected data was processed using
different cross-tabulations to analyze which characteristics were highly linked to mortality.
Chi-square test (χ²) and Fisher exact test (for small cell frequencies) were used for checking
statistical significance of the association. Another chi-square test for linear trend was used to
assess the statistical significance of the trend. Duration of hospital and ICU stay was
evaluated in terms of median and interquartile range (IQR) because of their highly skewed
distribution. Difference in these was assessed using Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. The level
of significance was 5%. SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US) was used for all the
calculations.

RESULTS
Demographics and Baseline
Out of the 1000 patients in the study, 24 were excluded due to incomplete data. Median age
was 47.5 years (interquartile range: 34.5-59.9 years). Nearly one-fourth (24.7%) of the
patients were of the age 60 years or more (Table 1) against around 10% population of this age
in this area. Thus, disproportionately higher percentages of old-age patients were admitted
with COVID-19.

Of these 976 cases, 655 (67.11%) were males and 321 (32.89%) were females. Males were
significantly (P < 0.001) higher and the male-female ratio was nearly 2:1. In the age group
45-59 years, the ratio for males was slightly less but for the age group 75+ years the ratio for
males was significantly higher than the overall average. If the admissions were in proportion
of the cases in the community, our data suggests that the older age males were more
commonly affected.
Details of the specific symptoms and co-morbidities are provided later. Of the total
admissions, 8.61% were asymptomatic and this percentage remained nearly the same across
all age groups. Nearly one-third (35.76%) reported two symptoms and another one-third
(34.63%) reported more than 3 symptoms (Table 1). The number of symptoms was not
associated with age (P = 0.469). More than half (53.59%) had no co-morbidity and 12.19% of
the admitted patients had 3 or more co-morbidities (Table 1). Against only 2.49% with 3 or
more co-morbidity in the age-group less than 45 years, more than 10 times (29.59%) of the
age 75 years or more had 3 or more co-morbidities. This difference is statistically highly
significant (P < 0.001). Nearly 30% had to be admitted to ICU and nearly 17% had to be on
ventilator. Both significantly (P < 0.001) increased with the age of the patients.
Correlates of Mortality
The main outcome under study is death or discharged alive. Of the 976 patients with a known
outcome, 873 (89.45%) were discharged alive and 103 (10.5%) died in the hospital. Age is
significantly associated with outcome (P < 0.001) in both males and females. Higher the age
the more was the mortality. More importantly, mortality in patients 75 years and above was 4
times the mortality in age 45-59 in both the sexes (Table 2). Sex on the other hand as an
individual characteristic failed to be significantly associated with mortality (P = 0.127)
although mortality was slightly higher in males than females (11.60% vs. 8.41%).

The highest (46.15%) mortality was seen in females of age 75+, followed by males (39.39%)
of the same age group. However, this difference in mortality between males and females in
this age group is not statistically significant (P = 0.675). In the age-group 60-74 years, the
mortality was 27.94% in males and 15.00% in females, and this difference is significant (P =
0.05).

More than one-half (53.58%) admitted patients reported no co-morbidity. The most common
co-morbidities in admitted patients with COVID-19 were hypertension (23.67%), diabetes
without macrovascular complications (15.37%), diabetes with macrovascular complications
(9.63%), chronic cardiac disease (5.64%), and chronic kidney disease (5.43%) (Table 3).
Less common co-morbidities were chronic pulmonary disease (7 cases), obesity (4 cases),
chronic neurological disorder (3 cases), and liver disease (2 cases). Mortality was highest
amongst those with chronic kidney disease (49.06), diabetes with complications (38.30%),
followed by those with chronic cardiac disease (32.73%). Mortality steeply increased from
2.68% in those with no co-morbidity to 36.13% with 3 or more co-morbidities (P<0.001)
(Table 4). Old age and high number of co-morbidities together substantially increased the
rate of mortality (Figure 1). Requirement of admission to ICU (P < 0.001) and ventilator (P <
0.001) also steadily increased as the number of co-morbidities increased.

Figure 1 Mortality in relation to the age-group and the number of co-morbidities
Less than one-tenth (8.61%) of the admitted patients reported no symptom. The most
common presenting symptoms were fever (78.28%), productive cough (37.19%), dyspnea
(30.64%), and sore throat (25.9%). Mortality was disproportionately higher (24.41%) in those
who were admitted with the complaint of dyspnea compared to the overall average. Cases
with sore throat had less (3.95%) mortality than the overall average (Table 5). Mortality
increased with the number of symptoms (Table 6) but the trend was not statistically
significant (P = 0.072).

An increase in the number of symptoms resulted in increased chances of ICU admission and
need for ventilator support. It also resulted in more deaths (Table 6). A similar trend was
observed with increasing number of co-morbidities with mortality. However, the difference
was statistically significant (P < 0.001) only for the number of co-morbidities, pointing to the
increased risk of ICU admission, ventilator requirement and eventual death in patients with
increasing co-morbidities and not with the number of symptoms.
Hospital Course
Of the 976 patients, 292 (29.92%) were admitted to the ICU at least once during their stay in
the hospital – 184 (63.01%) of them were directly admitted to the ICU and 108 (36.99%) had
to be shifted from ward to ICU (Figure 2). Mortality is significantly (P < 0.001) and steeply
higher (31.84%) in patients who are admitted to the ICU compared to the mortality (1.46%)
in those not admitted to ICU (Table 7). However, no such significant (P = 0.949) difference
in mortality is observed between those directly admitted to ICU (58/184) versus those who
were shifted from ward to the ICU (35/108). In both these cases, the mortality was nearly
32%.

Oxygen therapy was required in a total of 233 (23.87%) patients. Oxygen information in ICU
was available for 288 cases out of 292, and 679 out of 684 ward cases. A total of 178
(61.81%) of 288 in ICU required oxygen therapy, whereas 55 (8.10%) out of 679 ward
patients required this therapy. Mortality (33.91%) was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in
those requiring oxygen therapy compared to those requiring no oxygen (3.23%). Those
requiring oxygen therapy had nearly 10 times mortality.
A total of 166 (17.1%) required ventilator support – 57 invasive and 109 on non-invasive
ventilator. Mortality was much higher (P < 0.001) in patients requiring ventilator support,
even more so in patients requiring in invasive ventilation (82.46%) versus those requiring
non-invasive ventilator (41.28%) (Table 7).

Ata time when no approved treatment was available, our study observed lower mortality
amongst people receiving HCQ+/- azithromycin (8.27%) compared to the overall mortality of
10.55%. Only 3.48% of the patient received Ivermectin, with 100% recovery in all cases. For
steroids, the mortality is 47.11%. Similarly, for tocilizumab and convalescent plasma therapy,
the mortality was 25.00% and 14.29%, respectively
Duration of Hospital Stay
Overall median duration of stay in the hospital was 8 days (IQR: 5-11 days) and the most
common (mode) was 6 days. Those in ICU stayed nearly a day longer (median 9 days) than
those who never went to the ICU (median 8 days). A Mann-Whitney U test revealed that
median duration of stay was significantly (P = 0.004) higher in those who were admitted to
the ICU compared to those who were not.

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study to be conducted on hospitalized
patients with confirmed COVID-19 in India.
Our main findings are disproportionately higher admissions of male patients. The ones with
the highest risk of mortality were elderly (60-74 years) males. The most common existing comorbidity leading to mortality was CKD, followed by diabetes with macrovascular
complications and chronic cardiac diseases. Thus, these are the patients who need to be extra
careful. Nearly one-tenth had no symptoms, implying that some of those without symptoms
may also require admission. Those who had usually presented with fever, productive cough,
sore throat and dyspnea. Very few patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms (11%),
however this could be an under-representation since these patients fell outside the criteria for
testing (12,13).
Nearly 30% required admission to ICU. The main reason for ICU admission was hypoxemia.
The mortality was 32.1% compared to 1.46% in patients who did not have a ICU stay. There
was no difference in mortality in those who went straight to ICU versus those shifted from
ward to ICU. Thus, the prognosis of these two groups of patients was the same.
Amongst those requiring a high dependency unit, mortality was higher in those requiring
some form of ventilation compared to those who did not. This information can help anticipate
the clinical course that can be expected in a patient depending upon the presentation and comorbidities. It can also help to identify those at higher risk of severe infections and mortality,
and triage them accordingly.
Our study found lower mortality rates in patients receiving HCQ+/- Azithromycin. However,
this can be misleading as only the mild and moderate cases received this drug. According to
the treatment guidelines, HCQ was not administered in the severe cases where mortality was
expected to be much higher. Thus, the lower mortality in this group is most likely due to
milder disease rather than the drug itself. For ivermectin, the sample size is too small to
arrive at any conclusion regarding the efficacy despite 100% recovery in the 34 patients. The
mortality rate in steroid group was 47.1%, which was higher compared to that of the study
population (10.55%). This high rate can be attributed to steroids being given to more severe
cases at that time. However, in subsequent patients we incorporated steroids much earlier for
patient care and they have shown significant mortality benefit. In the initial phase of COVID19 in India (April-May 2020), the use of treatment modalities like steroids, tocilizumab and
convalescent plasma therapy were generally restricted to late stage when the condition
becomes critical, hence the mortality is much higher in these groups. Subsequent patients
received these drugs much earlier in the course of the disease and have shown significant
decrease in mortality.

Comparison with Other Studies
Our patients had a lower prevalence of hypertension (23.6%), diabetes without macrovascular
complications (15.3%), with macrovascular complications (9.6%) and CKD (5.4%) when
compared to patients in USA, UK, Italy and China (14,15,16,17), despite these higher prevalence
of this disease in the general Indian urban population as per the National Family Health
Survey 2015-16. (18) This could be attributed to precautionary measures taken by the
Government of India in terms of strict lockdown, ban on international and domestic travel,
along with mandatory quarantine for all passengers from rescue flights before they were
allowed to go home and the adherence to these rules by the general public. Being
geographically closer to China may have instilled a greater fear in the people. It was
surprising that not many patients admitted with COVID-19 had COPD, although this is
consistent with those reported from USA and China(19,20).
Overwhelming disease in developed nations like the USA, Spain and Italy possibly fostered
the need to be extra cautious amongst our people. Our study subjects may represent the
segment of the urban Indian population who are generally conscious about their health and
have easy access to modern medical facilities. In addition, most of the doctors were available
for video or telephonic consultations, minimizing the need for hospital visits. This
combination of vigilance and access to healthcare from home, may have led people with comorbidities less affected compared to some other countries.
The number of patients admitted to the ICU at our centers was higher (29.9%) when
compared to USA, UK and China, however the mortality (31.8%) was less in these cases than
seen in USA and UK, but more than reported from China (14,15,17). The higher admission rate
to ICU could be a result of late presentation, with people trying to home quarantine in case of
mild/moderate symptoms and only coming to the hospital when their condition worsened.
Being tertiary care hospitals, a significant proportion of our ICU patients were from Tier – 2
& Tier – 3 cities and these patients usually came with more severe disease due to late
presentation.
India was affected later than the western countries, giving us the advantage of learning how
other countries dealt with the pandemic. This gave us ample time to improvise our
infrastructure and adapt to the inevitable need of increased ICU beds, ventilators, and PPE
kits. Also, we had the advantage of well-defined guidelines created both at the central level
by the government and at the respective hospital level. A large number of therapies such as
use of convalescent sera, anti-viral drugs like remdesivir (21,22,23) and antibody against IL-6
receptors (Tocilizumab (24,25)) were already tried and proven to be efficacious in multiple
centers across the globe. Since this data is only for the first 1000 patients, remdesivir was not
used due to unavailability. Out of the total 6000 patients treated at our center thus far (by
September 2020) many received remdesivir as soon as it became available in the country.
Tocilizumab was initiated and 9% of the patients received them in this series. Due to high
demand, there were shortages in the drug supply in the initial period, but now it is widely
available and all the patients requiring it have been administered the drug henceforth.
One of our centres was among the first in the country to provide plasma therapy through a
randomized controlled trial, and though these numbers were very few in the first 1000
patients, it showed better outcome amongst some sections of the patients. Convalescent
plasma therapy has been administered to over 500 patients subsequently.
Amongst the patients admitted to the ICU, the requirement of ventilation in our cases
(48.2%) was much lower than in USA (85%) and Italy (71%). (16,27)

The overall mortality in our inpatient hospital cohort was 10.5%, which was also much lower
than those reported for the USA (21.1%) and UK (26%) at that time (14,15)This favorable
outcome again may be ascribed to the ability of our healthcare system to adapt and ensure
availability of resources. The recovery rate in India was 73.5% at the time of this report
compared to 53.2% in the USA and 74.9% in Brazil(28). However, the recovery in Delhi was
high at 90%, pointing to availability of healthcare resources – both personnel and
infrastructure. However, if the number of cases increases exponentially as feared, there might
be a shortage of beds, ventilators, and other vital resources. Our guidelines are constantly
updated to ensure best possible care for patients in an evolving situation.
The overall median duration of stay in the hospital both for ward and ICU was considerably
less in our patients when compared to US (9 days in discharged and 28.5 in still admitted)
and China (12 days) (14,17). This can be attributed both to a younger population in our cohort
and early aggressive treatment that obviated the need for ICU admission and eventually
mechanical ventilation. The reason for the low absolute difference between the median
duration of stay seen between the ward patients (8 days) and the ICU patients (9 days) was
due to government guidelines of continued admission until the patient tested negative twice.
Beginning May, these guidelines allowed discharge after 3 days of being afebrile without
being retested. Currently, our facility has a much lower duration of stay amongst ward
patients in comparison to ICU patients.
Implications for Clinical Practice
A pandemic is a time when every country is bound to face shortage of resources. Our study
provided evidence that elderly males and people with co-morbidities to have significantly
higher ICU admission rates, ventilator requirement and mortality rates. With the rising
numbers and evident need for cautious resource allocation, this information can help us triage
patients; ensure timely hospitalization and a watchful eye on these high-risk groups. We also
noticed fewer deaths in our ICU as compared to other countries owing to early aggressive
treatments and resource availability (ventilator). This helped us to ensure the appropriate use
of treatment modalities like steroids, tocilizumab, and plasma therapy in patients with
increasing need for oxygen therapy. This clinical management strategy reduced the mortality
rate even further in subsequent patients. This also reduced ICU admission and should
therefore be used early on especially in the high-risk group and people with dyspnea and
fever. Our experience suggests that every institution should create a standard protocol
incorporating latest evidence-based treatment and should be followed for every patient. We
are now analyzing the next 5000 COVID positive admissions depending upon the type of
treatment they were given and the outcome thereafter, and the time from increased oxygen
need to aggressive treatment initiation that will probably give us more detailed information
on the use of different pharmacomodalities and when to start them.

LIMITATIONS
Not all of our centers have Electronic Medical Records and tracking of written records was
challenging and led to some missing information. We removed 24 patients for whom a lot of
information was missing, however, even in the 976, there were a few missing entities.
Secondly, our patients had limited access at that time to therapies like convalescent plasma

due to the challenge of securing voluntary plasma donation and short supply of drugs like
tocilizumab and remdesivir (which became available in late June). No follow up was done
post discharge to check for any post COVID illness, signs or resurgence of symptoms in this
cohort; however, we are now conducting telephonic follow up on our patients for upto 6
weeks post discharge with a plan to further study recovery post discharge. We had
insufficient data regarding weight and height hence body mass index (BMI) and obesity,
which have shown strong association with COVID-19, could not be studied in our patients.
Our study subjects are mostly drawn from an urban setting and the findings might be specific
to urban areas only. COVID 19 is entirely a new disease that has become rampant worldwide,
and we may have missed unforeseen factors.

CONCLUSION
The study observed that the elderly male population is at considerably higher risk of
mortality from COVID-19. Also, the patients with co-morbidities have increased chances of
worse outcomes. These are powerful predictors for requirement of hospital admission in these
patients instead of outpatient care. We strongly believe that appropriate triaging of patients
depending upon age, presence of co-morbidities and severity of disease followed by early
institution of treatment as per the standard guidelines, adequately trained man force, adequate
PPE supply and good critical care services can go a long way in bringing down the mortality
in this disease.
