Abstract
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage across the globe and take millions of lives and
like many parts of the world, the second wave of the pandemic hit Bangladesh, this study aimed
at understanding its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2 at the genomic and proteomic level and provide
precious insights about the pathogenesis, evolution, strengths and weaknesses of the virus. As of
Mid-June 2021, over 1500 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced across the country. From
our analyses, it was discovered that the wave-2 samples had a significantly greater average rate of
mutation/sample (30.79%) than the wave-1 samples (12.32%). Wave-2 samples also had a higher
frequency of deletion, and transversion events. During the first wave, the GR clade was the most
predominant but it was replaced by the GH clade in the latter wave. The B.1.1.25 variant showed
the highest frequency in wave-1 while in case of wave-2, the B.1.351.3 variant, was the most
common one. A notable presence of the delta variant, which is currently at the center of concern,
was also observed. Comparison of the Spike protein found in the reference and the 3 most common
lineages found in Bangladesh namely, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617 in terms of their ability to form
stable complexes with ACE2 receptor revealed that B.1.617 had the potential to be more
transmissible than others. Importantly, no indigenous variants have been detected so far which
implies that the successful prevention of import of foreign variants can diminish the outbreak in
the country.

1. Introduction
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of
Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), has already infected > 177,000,000 people and
caused >3,800,000 deaths till mid-June, 2021) [1]. Since the influenza outbreak of 1918 COVID19 is the biggest pandemic of zoonotic origin that we are facing at a global scale [2]. The first
wave of the pandemic has passed and subsequent waves have already started in many countries
[3]–[7]. Insights regarding the transmission and evolution of the virus during these waves are
essential to break the chain of infections [8], [9]. Genomic data can provide some of these crucial
insights which can help make pragmatic public health policies [10], [11]. Besides, genomic
surveillance can deliver a deep understanding of the virus’ mechanism of survival and reduce
fatality during new waves of infection [11]–[14]
The onset of SARS-CoV-2 occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December, 2019 [15]–
[17]. Initially, clinicians diagnosed this disease as virus-induced pneumonia based on blood tests
and chest radiographs. Later, genomic and phylogenetic data analysis led to the recognition of the
pathogen as a member of the Coronaviridae family [18]. Coronaviridae family encompasses the
largest known enveloped, single stranded RNA viruses with a genome size ranging from 25-32
kilo base pairs (Kb) [19], [20]. The family is divided into two subfamilies, the Coronavirinae and
the Toronavirinae. The subfamily Coronavirinae is further organized genotypically and
serologically into 4 genera: α, β, γ, and δ-CoVs [21]. The betacoronavirus genus is comprised of
the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV which had been identified for the first time
in 2002-2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV in 2012. The genome
sequences of SARS-Cov-2 has a 79.6% identity with SARS-CoV/ SARS-CoV-1 and 67.06%

identity with MERS-CoV, indicating that they belong to the betacoronavirus genus [22]. All
human coronaviruses are considered to be of zoonotic origin, with Chinese bats being the most
likely host for SARS-CoV-2 [23]–[25]. Genetically, about 96% identity was observed between
SARS-CoV-2 and bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13)[18]. However, since bat habitats remain
distanced from human life, an intermediate animal such as pangolin might have acted as an
intermediate shuttle before transmitting to its human hosts [26]–[30].
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) primarily suggested the Huanan
local seafood market as the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak [31]. Despite this claim, none of the
animals in the area were tested positive for the virus. This indicated that the virus had already
moved out of Wuhan, long before the outbreak came under spotlight. Since then the control of
viral transmission through non-therapeutic interventions suggested by the World Health
Organization (WHO) had been attempted [32]. However, the violation of these preventive
measures and absence of proper antiviral therapeutics and vaccinations led to an uncontrollable
global transmission of the disease. The virus proliferated rapidly both inside and outside of China
and finally reached each and every county of the world. In March 2020, the disease was declared
as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) [15]. Although, at the beginning
of the pandemic, the intensity of the disease was higher in the Europe and the America but later it
also spread to Asian and South-East Asian countries [33]–[35].
Previously, the world went through three waves of the deadly Spanish flu until it subsided in 1919
while the second wave being the deadliest. The reason behind this fatal phenomenon was the rapid
dispersion of the virus to every corner of the world [36] . A similar pattern can be observed in the
case of COVID-19. By late 2020s and early 2021, a resurgence of infections was experienced by
most countries including the United States, Brazil, Belgium, France, UK, Germany, as well as

most of the Asian countries [37]–[39]. Remarkably India, which survived the first wave relatively
unscathed, is currently suffering from a spine-chilling situation with a higher mortality rate than
most other countries seeing more than 2000 deaths per day [40].
A well-established fact is that all viruses undergo genetic drift over time due to selection pressure
and give rise to a number of variants that challenge any pandemic response [41], [42] Therefore,
understanding the current variants are crucial in restricting the mode of transmission and
developing new therapeutics against them. Multiple variants have been identified around the world
so far including B.1.1.7 [43], B.1.351 [44], P.1 [45], B.1.427/B.1.429 [46] and B.1.617[47]. The
B.1.1.7 variant was first detected in the United Kingdom around September, 2020. Three different
types of mutations were observed in this variant which were present in the receptor binding domain
of the spike protein, the 69/70 deletion and the P681H mutation near the S1/S2 furin cleavage sites.
The alpha or kent variant turns out to be mutating again. In December 2020, B.1.351 was spotted
as the predominant variant in South Africa [48]. The variant, sharing some mutations with B.1.1.7
also had multiple mutations in their spike proteins such as K417N and E484K [49]. The P.1 variant
was first identified in Japan in a few travelers coming from Brazil in early January, 2021 [50].
B.1.427 and B.1.429 variants were first detected in California in February 2021 [46]. B.1.617.2 is
the daunting variant of coronavirus that originated in India and has been circulating globally in at
least 62 countries including the United States and United Kingdom [51]. About 70% of the
genome sequences submitted from India to GISAID constitute this variant. The major mutations
in the delta variant includes substitution in the amino acid sequences of the spike protein [52],
[53].
Bangladesh, being one of the most densely populated countries of the world with over 160 million
people and sharing a porous border with India, remains one of the most vulnerable countries for

the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The country with limited resources and scarce
healthcare facilities experiences major challenges while combating this transmission. The first case
of this virus in the country was confirmed in two men coming from Italy and a female relative by
the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) on March 7th, 2020 [54]
Although many Bangladeshi citizens came from Wuhan beforehand, they were reported to be
negative for SARS-CoV-2. As a response, the Bangladesh government took a number of
preventive measures including nationwide lockdowns, imposing restrictions on international
flights, strengthening of screening procedures, and shutting down of educational institutions and
so on [55]. Despite several rounds of lockdowns, the rate of infections continued to reach high
levels. Correspondingly, it became the second most affected country in Southeast Asia. Near the
end of the first wave, it began to drop gradually since November 2020. Although the rate declined
to its lowest during January and February, 2021, the cases began to rise again [56].
The first complete genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh was announced by the
Child Health Research Foundation on 12th May, 2020 [57]. Soon after, the National Institute of
Biotechnology announced the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genome by Sanger sequencing method
[58]. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing effort in Bangladesh flourished afterwards and as a
result, 1569 genomes have been sequenced by June 6, 2020.
The goal of this study was to probe all these sequences and find some crucial answers regarding
the genomic evolution of the virus, predominant variants, difference between the first and the
second wave and so on which would make it easier to comprehend the trajectory of the pandemic
and suggest appropriate counter measures.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Retrieval of the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequences
Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates were retrieved from the Global Initiative on Sharing All
Influenza Data (GISAID) database (www.gisaid.org) [59]. Isolates collected since the beginning
of the COVID-19 pandemic till 31 Jan 2021 were considered as wave-1. (Supplementary file 1).
and those collected between Feb 1, 2021 and Jun 6, 2021 were considered as wave-2 samples
(Supplementary file 2).
2.2 Wave-1 and Wave-2 Mutation Analysis
The Wuhan genome reference sequence (NC_045512.2) was retrieved from NCBI GenBank [60].
A GFF3 annotation file of the reference sequence (Supplementary file 3), generated by Giorgi
was used for extracting the genomic coordinates of SARS-CoV-2 proteins [61]. The sequences
from wave-1 and wave-2 were aligned separately against the reference sequence using the
NUCMER (version 4.0.0rc1) command line tool [62]. A SARS-CoV-2 annotation algorithm,
developed by Mecatelli and Giorgi [61], was employed to convert the outputs of alignments into
lists of mutational events. Frequency and the rate of mutation per sample was calculated. All the
SARS-CoV-2 sequences from both waves were classified based on the type of mutation. Specific
coordinates of the mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 genome were also identified. Finally, alterations
in the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 as a result of genomic variation were investigated.
Supplementary file 4 contains a detailed report on this mutation analysis for both COVID-19
pandemic waves in Bangladesh.

2.3 Clade and Variant Analysis for Wave-1 and Wave-2
For this analysis, both complete and incomplete sequences for wave-1 and wave-2 in the
Bangladesh region were obtained from GISAID. The number of sequences for different clades was
counted directly from this database. Assignment of different lineages for each sample from both
waves was performed by pangolin (version v3.0.5, lineages version 2021-06-05) web server
(https://pangolin.cog-uk.io/). For all sequences, Greek Alphabet names of relevant lineages, as
well as their classes (VOC for variants of concern, VOI for variants of interest and Unclassified
for other variants), were also ascribed. Percentage of occurrences for different clades and top ten
variants were calculated via R commands. Finally, comparative plots were generated by using the
ggplot2 package in R [63] to describe the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 clades and variants in
Bangladesh.
2.4 Molecular Docking between Spike Protein and ACE2
The reference sequence of the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein (S) was taken from UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/) (UniProt ID: P0DTC2) and
was manually mutated to generate the sequence of the variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617
which were most common in Bangladesh. 3D models of all the sequences were built using Robetta
[64]⁠. The structure of the human ACE2 receptor was extracted from the RCSB PDB (PDB ID:
6M0J). Docking between S-RBD and ACE2 was conducted by GalaxyTongDock_A server [65].
Following protein-protein docking, the generated models with the highest docking scores and
cluster size were selected and submitted to PROtein binDIng enerGY prediction (PRODIGY) to
calculate the binding affinity of the protein-protein complexes at physiological temperature (37 °C)
[66]⁠.

2.5 Molecular Dynamic Simulation of ACE2-Spike Protein Complex
In order to evaluate the evaluate the stability of the complex between the ACE2 receptor and the
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (Reference and the variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617) under
physiological conditions, 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was executed with GROningen
MAchine for Chemical Simulations aka GROMACS (version 5.1.1) [67]. The GROMOS96 43a1
force-field was used for the simulation [68]. 300 K temperature, pH 7.4, and 0.9% NaCl solution
was used to define the physiological condition of the system. A dodecahedral box with its edges
at 1 nm distance from the protein surface was drawn and the system was solvated with SPC (simple
point charge) water model . Using the genion module inherent to GROMACS, the overall charge
of the system was neutralized by adding 23 NA ions. The steepest descent minimization algorithm
was utilized to carry out energy minimization of the system. Isothermal-isochoric (NVT)
equilibration of the system was carried out for 100 ps with short-range electrostatic cutoff value
of 1.2 nm. Then the Isobaric (NPT) equilibration of the system was carried out for 100 ps as well
with short-range van der Waals cutoff fixed at 1.2 nm. Finally a 50 ns molecular dynamic
simulation was done using periodic boundary conditions and time integration step of 2 fs. After
every 100 ps, the energy of the system was recorded. The Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method was
employed for calculating the long range electrostatic potential. The short-range van der Waals
cutoff was set to 1.2 nm. The simulation temperature was maintained using modified Berendsen
thermostat while the pressure was made constant using the Parrinello-Rahman algorithm. An
interval of 100 ps was used each snapshot for analyzing the trajectory data. Eventually the
trajectory information gathered throughout the simulation were concatenated to calculate and plot
root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration
(Rg) and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) data. MD simulations were performed on the

“bioinfo-server” running on Ubuntu 18.4.5 operating system located at the Bioinformatics
Division, National Institute of Biotechnology.
In order to evaluate structural stability, Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) calculation was
performed. The “rms” module built into the GROMACS software was utilized to extract RMSD
information throughout the course of the simulation. The result can be plotted graphically using
the Xmgrace package.
Room Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) measurement was used to determine the flexibility of
local structures within the ACE2-Spike protein complex. The higher RMSF values corresponded
to higher flexibility of a region. RMSF calculations were carried out using the “rmsf” module and
the figures were generated using Xmgrace.
To determine the degree of compactness, the radius of gyration of the complex was calculated. A
relatively steady value of radius of gyration means stable folding of a protein. Fluctuation of radius
of gyration implies the unfolding of the protein. The “gyrate” module was used to generate the
radius of gyration graphs for our proteins.
Hydrophobic interactions composed of non-polar amino acids are crucial for maintaining the
stability of the hydrophobic core of proteins. They do so by covering the non-polar amino acids
within the hydrophobic cores and keeping them at a distance from the solvent. Solvent Accessible
Surface Area (SASA) is used in molecular dynamic simulations to predict the hydrophobic core
stability of proteins. In this study, SASA was calculated using the “sasa” module and the resulting
graph was visualized using Xmgrace.

3. Results
3.1 SARS-CoV-2 Genomes from Bangladesh
From the first instance of SARS-CoV-2 genome submission from Bangladesh (May 12, 2020) to
the time of the present study (June 6, 2021), the GISAID database recorded 1569 SARS-CoV-2
isolates from Bangladesh. According to our analysis, a total of 1074 samples belonged to wave-1
and 495 samples to wave-2.
3.2 Frequency of SARS-CoV-2 Mutations in Bangladesh
In comparison to the Wuhan reference sequence, all sequences from both waves appeared to have
two or more mutations (Supplementary file 5). The average number of mutations per sample was
found to differ significantly between the two waves (Fig 1) based on two sided t-test 𝑝 = 2.2 ×
10

−16

. The average rate of mutation in wave-2 samples (30.79%) was substantially higher than

the wave-1 samples (12.32%). In the case of wave-1 (1074 samples), most of the sequences
possessed 6 to 17 mutations per sample, while the majority of the sequences in wave-2 (495
samples) tended to have 28 to 38 mutations (Fig 2).
3.3 Type of SARS-CoV-2 Mutations in Bangladesh
The occurrence of several classes of mutations, as well as the percentages of each class for both
waves, are documented in the Supplementary file 6. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
seemed to be highly prevalent in both cases (58.89% in wave-1 and 61.5% in wave-2) (Fig 3).
Extragenic mutations were also found to some extent, but all were either in 5'-UTR or in 3'-UTR
regions. Wave-2 cases (943 events, 6.19%) had considerably more deletion events than wave-1
instances (115 events, 0.87%). During the first surge of the pandemic, the insertion (0.03%),

deletion_stop(0.01%), or insertion_stop(0.01%) events took place in a small fraction of cases, but
not at all in the second phase.
All mutational events were also classified into different variant types to explain the higher
frequency of SNPs (Supplementary file 7). Though both SNP transitions (purine > purine,
pyrimidine > pyrimidine) and transversion (purine > pyrimidine and vice versa ) were observed
among all samples, C>T transition was the most frequent mutation in both waves (Fig 4). The
percentage of occurrence of this transitional event was 45.75% in wave-1 and 42.44% in wave-2.
While A>G transition is the second most common event in wave-1(12.53%), G>T transversion
possessed this place in the case of wave-2(13.57%). Oligonucleotide deletion was also commonly
present in the samples from wave-2. In the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in
Bangladesh, two oligonucleotide deletion events (TCTGGTTTT and CTTGCTTTA) appeared to
be much more pervasive (2.46% and 1.63% respectively).
3.4 Genomic Location of the SARS-CoV-2 Mutations
The presence of mutational changes in specific coordinates of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences
was also analyzed in this study (Supplementary file 8). In both waves, the A23403G, C3037T,
C14408T, and C241T mutations showed a similar pattern of abundance (Fig 5). Although the
GGG28881AAC trinucleotide substitution was the 5th most prevailing event in the case of Wave1, its existence was much lower in the case of Wave-2 ( only 0.75%). Rather TCTGGTTTT11288
deletion was substantially more common in the second phase, which is consistent with previous
findings of this study.
3.5 Impact of Mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 Proteome
We also summarized the impacts of these mutations on the protein sequence of SARS-CoV-2 in
12

the final step of this mutational investigation (Supplementary file 9). The D614G (aspartate to
glycine in the 614th amino acid) mutation in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is caused by the
most predominant nucleotide transversion (A > G) in the 23,403rd position. This mutation, a
characteristic feature of the G-clade of SARS-CoV-2 genome, was observed in the highest
frequency in the samples of both waves (Fig 6). From this observation it can be said that the Gclade of this virus was ubiquitous in Bangladesh in the case of both waves, which we have also
explicated later through the clade distribution analysis. Despite sorting by frequency, the pattern
of dominance of S:D614G, NSP3:F106F, NSP12b:P314L and, 5'UTR:241 mutations was identical
in both waves, however in wave-1, these mutations were at a somewhat greater percentage (8.01%,
7.82%, 7.70% and, 7.48% respectively ) than other modifications. On the other hand, these
mutations accounted for 3.24%, 3.22%, 3.11%, and 2.93% of total amino acid alteration events
from wave-2 samples.
3.6 Distribution of SARS-CoV-2 Clades in Bangladesh
Furthermore, the distribution of various SARS-CoV-2 clades and most frequent variants was also
compared across two waves in Bangladesh (Supplementary file 10). Throughout the pandemic in
Bangladesh, the G-clade and its derivatives (GH, GV, GR, GRY) continued to be dominant (Fig
7). Although the GR clade was predominant during wave-1(75.86%), in wave-2 the GH clade took
the lead (61.26%). However, the percentage of other G-clades was pretty much similar in both
phases of the pandemic. On the contrary, in wave-1, the L, O, and S clades had a very low
frequency, and in wave-2, the L and S clades disappeared. The variants from the B lineage were
extremely common in wave-1, with B.1.1.25 accounting for 72.46% of the total (Fig 8). Besides,
the alpha variant (B.1.1.7), a variant of concern, also showed up to some extent. In the scenario of
wave-2, however, the B.1.351.3 (57.44%) variant dominated throughout the entire time frame.

During this wave, there was also a progressive increase of VOC variants (alpha, beta, delta).
3.7 Molecular Docking between the ACE2 and Spike Protein
Molecular docking between human ACE2 receptor and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of
Spike protein found in the reference and the 3 most commonly found variants namely, B.1.1.7,
B.1.351, B.1.617 revealed that the variants B.1.351 and B.1.617 had the two highest binding
affinities respectively. Notably, the variant B.1.617 exhibited the highest docking score (Table 3).
3.8 Molecular Dynamic Simulation of the ACE2-Spike Protein Complex
Protein backbone RMSD analysis of reference spike protein and the variants exhibited marked
differences. The reference protein periodically showed large deviations until it attained stability at
around 42 ns. The variant B.1.1.7 was much more stable. Despite some initial fluctuations it
assumed stable conformation gradually after 20 ns. B.1.351 on the other hand was very stable since
the beginning. However there were a number of spikes in between 34 and 40 ns after which the
complex stabilized again. Among the four complexes tested, the one involving the variant B.1.617
was the most stable of all. It remained highly stable throughout the simulation except there was a
rise in RMSD at 36-46 ns period. However it maintained a steady value within this period as well
(Fig 9a).
Upon evaluation of the detailed residual atomic fluctuations through RMSF calculation of the
protein Cα atoms, it was apparent that both the reference and the variants B.1.351, and B.1.617
were very similar in the sense that the atoms near the end of the complex were more flexible than
the rest of the complex (Fig 9b).
The Rg graphs revealed a very similar pattern found in the RMSD graphs. The variant B.1.617
remained in compact state throughout the simulation with a period of unfolding at 36-46 ns. The

reference protein unfolded at regular intervals and often to a high degree. The variant B.1.1.7
folded steadily while B.1.351 unfolded abruptly several times from 34-40 ns and remained
otherwise rest of the time (Fig 9c).
SASA values provided a measure of the complex's susceptibility to disruption of their hydrophobic
core by water . For all four complexes, the SASA declined gradually over time. However, the
greatest reduction took place in the case of the variant B.1.617 (Fig 9d).

4. Discussion
The first case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was identified on migrants returning from Italy at the
beginning of March [69]. Since then, according to the official record (as of Jun 15, 2021) about
829K people have been affected and over 13K died of this virus in Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the
virus has affected over 177 million individuals globally, with over 3.8 million deaths [1]. Since
the first patient had been identified, COVID-19 cases were found regularly in Bangladesh
throughout the year 2020. The number of COVID-19 cases in neighboring India has been rising
rapidly since March 2021. Inevitably, the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Bangladesh is also on
the upswing. In this study, a comparative genomic analysis was performed to track the dynamics
of SARS-CoV-2 evolution between the two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.
The rate of mutation in SARS-CoV-2 (~2 nucleotides/month) is far lower than that of influenza (4
nucleotides/month) or HIV (8 nucleotides/month), yet its distinct genomic regions and proteins are
mutating at significantly variable rates [70], [71]. The frequency of these mutations alters
considerably depending on the geographical location with time as well. In this study, a significant
rise in the rate of mutation was observed in wave-2 samples of Bangladesh compared to the wave1. A similar pattern was observed in the instance of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic waves in Hiroshima,

Japan [72]. Although both waves in Bangladesh had a higher incidence of amino acid altering
SNPs, wave-2 tended to have a higher number of deletion events (Fig 3). Such recurring recurrent
deletion events in the SARS-CoV-2 genome had been reported to facilitate its transmission with
altered antigenicity and antibody escape mechanism [73]. Furthermore, despite the fact that C>T
transitions prevailed in both waves, G>T transversion was rather frequent in wave-2 (Fig 4). This
transversion provoked the G25563T nucleotide mutation event (ORF3a:Q57H in protein level) in
the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which was a marker variant for GH clade [74]. This might explain why
the GH clade was observed to be more apparent in Bangladesh during Wave 2. Different marker
variants for GISAID clades and lineages have been listed in Table 1. The phylogenetic clusters
derived from the statistical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 genomic distances have been used to
define these clade classifications in GISAID [75].
The second and third most common SNPs in Bangladesh were silent and extragenic SNPs,
respectively. Even though these SNPs do not alter the protein sequence directly, they have a major
impact on the efficiency of translation and transcription. SNPs in the 5'-UTR, in particular, can
influence the virus's transcription and replication processes by altering the folding of genomic
RNA [75]. The A23403G, G3037T, C241T nucleotide variants as well as S: D614G,
ORF3a:Q57H, N:G204R protein variants were equally abundant in both waves (Fig 6). All of
these are marker variants for the G clade and its derivatives (Table 1), which explains why
Bangladesh experienced a greater distribution of these clades (Fig 7).
In May 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended adopting Greek Alphabet
letters to name several important SARS-CoV-2 variants (Table 2). The most widely available
B.1.351.3 variant in wave-2 in Bangladesh is a sublineage of beta, a VOC variant first detected in
South African samples. On the other hand, the delta variant, which is driving a catastrophic

pandemic in neighboring country India, is the third most frequent variant in this wave in
Bangladesh (Fig 8).
The importance of the interaction between the ACE2 receptor and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
is paramount in understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection [76]. Molecular docking
and dynamics simulations are one of the key tools for getting in-depth insights into these
interactions [77]–[79].
Molecular docking experiment showed that the Spike protein of the variants B.1.351 and B.1.617
bound most tightly to the ACE2 receptor. From the 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation carried
out in GROMACS, the complex between the ACE2 receptor and the Spike protein variant of
B.1.617 was found to be most stable considering its structural deviation, local area flexibility, state
of folding, and susceptibility to disruption by solvents (Fig 9). These findings coincide with those
reported in other studies and the enhanced Spike protein stability of the B.1.617 is likely to
contribute to the efficiency of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [80]–[82].

5. Conclusions
The current study revealed significant genomic and proteomic differences in the SARS-CoV-2
viral isolates circulating within the perimeters of Bangladesh between the first and the second wave
of the COVID-19 pandemic. They differ in terms of distribution of clades, mutations, variants, rate
of mutations, and even in terms of their interactions with the host ACE2 receptor. The study found
evidence that the B.1.617 lineage of the virus is likely to be more infectious than others. Notably,
any existence of a domestic variant is yet to be detected. Therefore, if Bangladesh can shield itself
from the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 variants from outside for a substantial period, the COVID-19
pandemic in the country is likely to come to an end.

Fig 1: Density plot of average mutations per sample in case of wave-1 and wave-2. The Red
line and Blue line represent the average value of mutation per sample for wave-1 and wave-2
respectively. Wave-2 samples generally possessed a higher number of mutations per sample than
wave-1.

Fig 2: Number of mutations per sample for wave-1 and wave-2. The majority of sequences
from wave-1 had 6 to 17 mutations per sample. On the other hand, most of the samples of wave-2
possess on average 28 to 38 mutations.

Fig 3: Distribution of mutation classes between two waves of COVID-19 in Bangladesh.
SNPs, silent SNPs, and extragenic mutations were similarly abundant in both waves. But,
sequences of wave-2 had a significant amount of deletion events.

Fig 4: Most frequent mutational events per type between the two waves. The C>T transition
was highly prevalent in both waves. While A>G transition is the second most abundant event in
wave-1, samples from wave-2 had G>T transversion event.

Fig 5: Most frequent mutations at the nucleotide level in wave-1 and wave-2. The first four
nucleotide events were the most widespread for both waves in Bangladesh. Among them,
A23403G, C3037T, and C241T mutations are characteristic features of G clade and its derivatives.
Wave-2 showed a substantial frequency of the TCTGGTTTT oligonucleotide deletion at 11288
position.

Fig 6: Number of most frequent protein level alterations among two waves in Bangladesh.
The four most frequent amino acid substituting events had the same type of distribution for both
waves. Besides, some mutations in spike and nucleocapsid protein (e.g., S:N501Y, N:T205I,
S:D80A ) were found in a significant amount in wave-2. Furthermore, the ORF3a:Q57H variant,
which is a marker variant for GH clade, was also very common in this case.

Fig 7: Comparative distribution of different clades in two waves of COVID-19 pandemic in
Bangladesh. G clade and its descendants dominated throughout the pandemic. But GR clade in
the case of wave-1 and GH clade in the case of wave-2 were the most prevalent ones. In the second
wave, the L, O, and S clades were almost completely lost.

Fig 8: Prevalence of different variants (in percentage) observed in wave-1 and 2 of COVID19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Almost all SARS-CoV-2 variants of wave-1 were from B lineage.
On the other hand, wave-2 had an increased number of VOC variants. The most prevalent
B.1.351.3 variant of this wave is a derivative of the beta (B.1.351) variant. Number of people
infected with SARS-CoV-2 remained low in between late January to late February (Fig 9).
