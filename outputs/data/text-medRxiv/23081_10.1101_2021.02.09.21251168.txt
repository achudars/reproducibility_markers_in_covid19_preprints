Abstract
Background
The emergence of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern called B.1.1.7 lineage sparked
global alarm due to evidence of increased transmissibility, mortality, and uncertainty about
vaccine efficacy, thus accelerating efforts to detect and track the variant. Current approaches
to detect lineage B.1.1.7 include sequencing and RT-qPCR tests containing a target assay
that fails or results in reduced sensitivity towards the B.1.1.7 variant.
Aim
Since many countries lack robust genomic surveillance programs and failed assays detect
multiple unrelated variants containing similar mutations as B.1.1.7, we sought to develop an
RT-qPCR test that can accurately and rapidly differentiate the B.1.1.7 variant from other
SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Methods
We used bioinformatics, allele-specific PCR, and judicious placement of LNA-modified
nucleotides to develop a test that differentiates B.1.1.7 from other SARS-CoV-2 variants. We
validated the test on 106 clinical samples with lineage status confirmed by sequencing and
conducted a surveillance study of B.1.1.7 lineage prevalence in Slovakia.
Results
Our multiplexed RT-qPCR test showed 97% clinical sensitivity at detecting lineage B.1.1.7.
The assay was used in a country-wide surveillance of B.1.1.7 lineage spread in Slovakia.
Retesting nearly 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples obtained during three campaigns
performed within a one month period, revealed pervasive spread of B.1.1.7 with an average
prevalence of 82%.

Labs can easily implement this test to rapidly scale B.1.1.7 surveillance efforts and it is
particularly useful in countries with high prevalence of variants possessing only the
ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion because current strategies using target failure assays incorrectly identify
these as putative B.1.1.7 variants.

Introduction

In Dec 2020, Rambaut et al. [1] reported the genomic characterization of a distinct
phylogenetic cluster named lineage B.1.1.7 (also referred to as 20I/501Y.V1 by Nextstrain
(https://nextstrain.org/sars-cov-2/) or Variant of Concern (VOC) 202012/01), briskly spreading
over the past four weeks in the United Kingdom. The new lineage has 23 mutations: 13 nonsynonymous mutations, 4 deletions, and 6 synonymous mutations. The spike protein contains
ten mutations at the amino-acid level (ΔH69/ΔV70 and ΔY144 deletions, N501Y, A570D,
D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H) that could potentially change binding affinity of the
virus [2–4] and consequently virus-host interaction. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests
lineage B.1.1.7 has enhanced transmissibility [3, 5–8], results in higher viral loads [9, 10], and
causes increased mortality [11]. These data highlight the need for tools to facilitate enhanced
surveillance of lineage B.1.1.7 as well as other variants that may harbour spike gene mutations
that alter viral dynamics.
The dominant approach used to putatively detect lineage B.1.1.7 involves conducting
multigene RT-qPCR tests that result in positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in one or more gene
sets together with a so-called S gene target failure (SGTF), which is used as a proxy for the
B.1.1.7 variant. This approach permits widespread, rapid screening, but is limited by the fact
that other variants, in addition to lineage B.1.1.7, produce SGTFs. Thus, the SGTF screening
method depends on the presence of other variants in a region and how they vary over time.
Whole genome sequencing is the gold-standard for detection of the B.1.1.7 variant. This
provides direct confirmation of the variant and identification of emerging variants; however, it
is expensive, time consuming, low throughput, and many countries lack a robust genomic
surveillance program, making this approach unwieldy to adopt for tracking and mitigating the
spread of the B.1.1.7 variant.
Here, we report the development of a novel, multiplexed RT-qPCR test for
differentiating lineage B.1.1.7 from all other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. We validated the test using

a selected set of 106 clinical samples collected during routine testing with the lineage status
verified by sequencing. Unlike other tests that rely on indirect detection via SGTF, this test
contains primers that target the ΔH69/ΔV70 and ΔY144 deletions in the spike gene that permit
the direct detection of lineage B.1.1.7. This assay was used in three rounds of a country-wide
screening of the prevalence of B.1.1.7 in Slovakia, which included 6,886 SARS-CoV-2 positive
samples, revealing increasing prevalence of lineage B.1.1.7 over time in Slovakia. This RTqPCR assay provides a useful tool for countries to rapidly identify hot spots of this new B.1.1.7
variant and implement test, trace, and isolate strategies to prevent this variant from becoming
widespread. Countries currently experiencing extensive circulation of variants carrying only
the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion may find this test particularly useful as these would be falsely
identified as the B.1.1.7 variant via SGTF tests.

Materials and Methods

Identification of RT-qPCR targets by bioinformatic analysis
To identify suitable targets for primer/probe design, we downloaded 1,136 sequences
from the GISAID repository filtered during a collection time spanning 1 - 21 December 2020.
We focused on the spike gene because lineage B.1.1.7 contains a number of spike gene
mutations, including two deletions (ΔH69/ΔV70 and ΔY144) that are ideal for designing a
specific assay. We cut the locus encoding the spike protein and used the MAFFT alignment
tool (with the parameter - auto)[12] to align all the sequences against the WUHAN reference
(NCBI ID: NC_045512.2). Twelve sequences (1.06 %) contained ambiguous signal in the loci
of deletions and were not used in the downstream analysis. We separated sequences into two
groups: 1) those with the ΔH69/ΔV70 and ΔY144 deletions and 2) those without the deletions
(Supplementary Table S1). Using SeaView [13], we called 95% consensus sequences for

the ΔH69/ΔV70 and ΔY144 group and the No deletions group that were subsequently used to
design primer and probe sets specific to either B.1.1.7 or all other SARS-CoV-2 variants,
respectively.
In a separate analysis to determine the prevalence of the ΔH69/ΔV70 and ΔY144
deletions in lineages other than B.1.1.7, we downloaded 633,137 spike protein sequences
with the most recent data description file collected from the beginning of the pandemic through
2 March 2021. Using regular expressions (bash pattern matching command grep with the
option -P for Perl-compatible regular expression), we searched for loci with both ΔH69/ΔV70
and ΔY144 deletions and for loci without these deletions. In the regular expression, we kept
fixed a few amino acids downstream and upstream from the deletions to omit any miscalling

Primer design and synthesis
We designed primers and probes using the 95% consensus sequences to target the S
gene of the common SARS-CoV-2 (called SARS-CoV-2 S gene assay). To differentiate the
B.1.1.7 variant from all other SARS-CoV-2 variants, we also designed primers and probes to
target the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 variants containing either the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion or the
ΔY144 deletion, or both deletions (called B.1.1.7 assay). As an internal control, we
synthesized a primer/probe set for human RNase P published by the US CDC [14]. We
incorporated locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified bases into some primers and probes
following general guidelines in order to normalize melting temperatures, increase sensitivity,
and enhance specificity [15–17]. Following primer/probe design, we conducted in silico
analyses

B.1.1.7 were labelled with a 5’-FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) reporter dye and 3’-BHQ-1 (black

Positive controls
For primer/probe set optimization, we used the following positive controls: 1) RNA
extracted from a patient confirmed positive for a common variant of SARS-CoV-2 that does
not contain any deletions in the spike gene (named wild type template), 2) RNA extracted from
a patient confirmed positive for a common variant of SARS-CoV-2 that contains the six base
pair deletion (bp: 21765-21770) resulting in the deletion of two amino acids at the 69/70
position of the spike protein (named ΔH69/ΔV70 template), and 3) RNA extracted from a
patient confirmed positive by whole genome sequencing for the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7
(named B.1.1.7 template). The SARS-CoV-2 control samples were confirmed by whole
genome sequencing of tiled ~ 2-kbp long amplicons on a MinION device (Oxford Nanopore
Technologies, Oxford, UK) essentially as described by Resende et al. (2020) [19].

RT-qPCR
We optimized RT-qPCR reactions and conducted clinical validations using both an
AriaMx (Agilent, CA, USA) and QuantSudio 5 (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA) real-time

in a 20 µl total volume. One-step RT-qPCR assays were conducted with the following cycling
conditions: 55 °C for 10 min for reverse transcription, 95 °C for 10 min for initial denaturation,
and 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Concentrations for primers and probes
were as follows: SARS-CoV-2 S gene (forward and reverse primer = 500 nM, probes = 200
nM for each probe (single and dual); B.1.1.7: forward primer = 600 nM, reverse primer = 800
nM, probes = 200 nM for each probe (single and dual); RNase P (forward and reverse primer
= 250 nM, probe = 80 nM).

Analytical sensitivity (limit of detection)
To assess the analytical sensitivity of both our common SARS-CoV-2 S gene (S gene)
and B.1.1.7 primer/probe sets, we used RNA isolated from a patient sample infected with the
B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 as confirmed by sequencing. This RNA was diluted to 200
copies/μl and then serial dilutions were prepared by diluting the stock with a synthetic matrix
"SARS-CoV-2 Negative" (Cat. No. COV000, Exact Diagnostics, TX, USA) containing genomic
DNA at a concentration of 75,000 copies/ml, resulting in samples with concentrations of 8
copies/μl (= 40 copies/reaction), 2 copies/μl (= 10 copies/reaction), 0.8 copies/μl (= 4
copies/reaction), 0.4 copies/μl (= 2 copies/reaction) and 0.2 copies/μl (= 1 copy/reaction) that
were used in the analytical sensitivity test. The assay was performed in 8 replicates for each
prepared dilution.

Clinical performance evaluation

We evaluated the clinical utility of our SARS-CoV-2 S gene and B.1.1.7 primer/probe
sets using a selected set of 106 clinical samples, which were confirmed by an RT-qPCR

reference method used for routine testing by regional public health authorities of the Slovak
Republic. Further sequencing revealed 67 of these samples belonging to the B.1.1.7 lineage,
24 samples belonging to the B.1.258 lineage (contains only the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion), and 15
samples belonging to other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. The SARS-CoV-2 sequences were
determined by sequencing of tiled ~ 2-kbp long amplicons on a MinION device (Oxford
Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) as described by Resende et al. (2020) [19].

We conducted a detailed assessment of potential biases and applicability judgements
of the clinical validation using the QUADAS-2 tool [20] (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/populationhealth-sciences/projects/quadas/quadas-2/; Supplementary Table S3). Inclusion criteria for
the selected set of samples consisted of a positive result from a reference standard RT-qPCR
test as well as available sequencing information to confirm lineage. No SARS-CoV-2 negative
samples were included in the clinical evaluation because in practice this test was to be used
only as a tool to identify lineage status in samples previously identified as SARS-CoV-2
positive. The clinical validation was conducted by the Biomedical Research Center, Institute
of Virology, Slovak Academy of Sciences (BMC-SAS). BMC-SAS received clinical samples
previously identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive by local laboratories, then extracted RNA and
performed the index test (rTest COVID-19 qPCR ALLPLEX KIT; MultiplexDX) and the B.1.1.7
test in parallel. All samples were processed and tested in a timely manner to minimize the
effects of RNA degradation. For the clinical evaluation, researchers used a prespecified
criterion to interpret test results (Supplementary Table S4) and were blind to the sequencing
outcome.

Surveillance of lineage B.1.1.7 prevalance throughout the Slovak Republic
This test (rTest COVID-19 B.1.1.7 qPCR kit) was used to assess the prevalence of
B.1.1.7 throughout the Slovak Republic over a period of one month. Multiple laboratories of
the Public Health Authority of the Slovak Republic retested 6,886 samples that were identified

as SARS-CoV-2 positive by a standard RT-qPCR test. Retesting occurred over a one month
period on February 2nd, 2021 (1,962 samples), February 17th, 2021 (2,382 samples), and
March 3rd, 2021 (2,542 samples). To ensure sufficient sample size for smaller geographic
regions, we grouped districts based on the jurisdictions of the regional public health offices
(there are 36 public health offices each covering 1-8 districts) and distributed tests accordingly.
Laboratory personnel determined lineage status using the predefined criteria outlined in
Supplementary Table S4. For comparison wth our observed B.1.1.7 prevalances, we also
used the prevalences obtained on the first screening round (February 2nd, 2021) to estimate
historical and future prevalences using a range of two weeks and applying spread factors (3.3
and 5.4) that were derived from estimated reproduction numbers from the UK [5, 8]. Data from
the surveillance screening can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/Institut-ZdravotnychAnalyz/covid19-data/tree/main/PCR_Tests.

Results

Identification of RT-qPCR targets by bioinformatic analysis
Our analysis of 1,136 spike gene sequences (spanning 1 - 21 December 2020)
revealed 228 sequences (20%) that contained both the ΔH69/ΔV70 and ΔY144 deletions (for
country of origin, see Supplementary Table S1). The shorter deletion (ΔY144) always cooccurred with the longer deletion (ΔH69/ΔV70), whereas the (ΔH69/ΔV70) deletion occurs
independently in 17 sequences (1.5%). Pearson's correlation coefficient of the deletions is
0.953.
We analysed over 600,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes to determine the prevalence of both
ΔH69/ΔV70 and ΔY144 deletions in lineage B.1.1.7 and lineages other than B.1.1.7 and found
a total of 103,529 sequences that possess both deletions. Based on the metadata file, we

identified SARS-CoV-2 lineages across all called sequences with both deletions. Only 108
sequences (0.10%) out of 103,529 sequences are not labelled as B.1.1.7. In other words,
99.90% of sequences containing both deletions belong to lineage B.1.1.7, highlighting the
notion that these two deletions are highly specific for the B.1.1.7 variant and make ideal targets
for primer/probe design (Table 1).

Development of a multiplexed RT-qPCR assay to distinguish lineage B.1.1.7 from all
other SARS-CoV-2 variants

To develop a multiplexed RT-qPCR test to distinguish lineage B.1.1.7, we designed
two assays targeting either the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike gene or the ΔH69/ΔV70 and
ΔY144 deletions that are highly specific to lineage B.1.1.7 (for primer/probe locations and
sequences see Figure 1 and Table 2, respectively).

We began by designing a general S gene primer/probe assay (SARS-CoV-2 S gene)
that could be used for screening purposes and would detect the most common strains of
SARS-CoV-2 as well as variants containing the ΔH69/ΔV70, including lineage B.1.1.7. We
assessed the performance of a series of primers flanking the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion
(Supplementary Figure S1A, B; for primer/probes sequences, see Supplementary Table
S2.). After selecting the optimal primer/probe combination, we introduced an additional
hydrolysis probe, identically labelled with the same reporter and quencher dyes, that would
hybridize in tandem (i.e., on the same strand) with the first hydrolysis probe. Consistent with
other reports [21, 22], this dual probe approach enhanced sensitivity and specifity
(Supplementary Figure S1C, D).
For our assay targeting lineage B.1.1.7, we leveraged the highly specific cooccurrence of the ΔH69/ΔV70 and ΔY144 deletions in lineage B.1.1.7 (99.90%, Table 1). By

designing a series of forward primers to target the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion, we differentiated wild
type template from ΔH69/ΔV70 template (Supplementary Figure S2A). Since other SARSCoV-2 variants share the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion (e.g., B.1.1.298, B.1.160, B.1.177, B.1.258,
B.1.375, B.1.525), we designed a series of reverse primers to target the second, three base
pair deletion (bp: 21991-21993; ΔY144) and utilized allele-specific PCR approaches [23–25]
and judicious placement of LNA-modified nucleotides to enhance the specificity of the assay
(Supplementary Figure S2B and C). This approach enabled us to differentiate B.1.1.7
variants that contain both the ΔH69/ΔV70 and ΔY144 deletions from SARS-CoV-2 variants
that contain only the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion, provided that a second reaction is ran in parallel
using the SARS-CoV-2 S gene set that can be used as a benchmark to assess the relative
sensitivity. If the B.1.1.7 primer set amplifies the sample within five Ct cycles of the SARSCoV-2 S gene primer set, then the sample is B.1.1.7 positive. Alternatively, if the B.1.1.7
primer set amplifies the sample in 8 or more Ct cycles relative to the SARS-CoV-2 S gene
primer set, than the sample likely belongs to a variant that contains the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion,
but not the ΔY144 deletion, and hence is B.1.1.7 negative.
We compared three different versions of B.1.1.7 primer/probe sets using a selected
set of 46 samples, some of which were sequenced to confirm lineage status. Given our
interpretation criterion (Supplementary Table S4), we determined that the V3 primer/probe
set performed the best since it correctly identified all B.1.1.7 and ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion
samples, with the exception of one ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion sample that was interpreted as
inconclusive (Supplementary Figure S3).

Analytical sensitivity and clinical evaluation of lineage B.1.1.7 S gene primer/probe set
With our final primer/probe sets for SARS-CoV-2 S gene and B.1.1.7 (Table 2), we
multiplexed each assay with the US CDC human RNase P primer/probe set (for sequences,
see [14]) as an internal control to assess RNA extraction and assay performance. We then
determined the analytical sensitivity using serial dilutions of RNA extracted from a B.1.1.7

gene and B.1.1.7 assays reliably detecting down to only 2 copies/reaction (0.4 copies/μl) and
10 copies/reaction (2 copies/μl), respectively, placing them among the most sensitive SARSCoV-2 RT-qPCR assays available.

We evaluated the clinical performance of our SARS-CoV-2 S gene and B.1.1.7 assays
on 106 clinical samples that underwent sequencing to identify lineage status using
interpretation criterion outlined in Supplementary Table S4. Our SARS-CoV-2 S gene assay
detected all 106 clinical samples regardless of lineage (Table 3) confirming its utility as a
general screening assay for the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants. Out of 67 clinical
samples classified as lineage B.1.1.7 by sequencing, our B.1.1.7 assay positively identified
65 samples, while one sample (Sample 75) was not detected by the B.1.1.7 assay and another
sample was deemed inconclusive. The ΔCt of this sample was slightly greater than five cycles
(e.g., Sample 40, ΔCt = 5.7) relative to the Ct value for the SARS-CoV-2 S gene assay, which
exceeded our cut-off for a positive identification (Figure 2B).

Notably, our assay was also capable of identifying samples carrying the ΔH69/ΔV70
deletion such as those belonging to the B.1.258 lineage, provided that the sample contains
sufficient viral load as other ΔH69/ΔV70 variants yield ΔCt values greater than 8 Ct cycles.
For the 24 samples that carry only the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion and belong to lineage B.1.258,
our B.1.1.7 assay correctly identified 20 out of 24 samples. Three samples were not detected
by the B.1.1.7 assay possibly due to relatively high Ct values in the SARS-CoV-2 S gene
assay for two samples (Sample 33, Ct = 30.1 and Sample 65, Ct = 28.9), making confirmation
of the ΔH69/ΔV70 status impossible with our cut-off criterion. One sample had a ΔCt outside
the criterion for ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion confirmation and was deemed inconclusive. Overall, the
clinical evaluation confirmed the diagnostic utility of both our SARS-CoV-2 S gene and B.1.1.7
assays, which showed 100% (106/106) and 97% (65/67) diagnostic sensitivity, respectively.
The assay also showed diagnostic utility for identifying variants containing only the
ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion by detecting 83.3% (20/24) of lineage B.1.258 samples. When
considering B.1.258 samples containing high viral loads (Ct ≤ 28), which is necessary to
identify variants with only the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion, the diagnostic sensitivity reached 91.7%
(22/24). For an overview of the clinical evaluation data, lineage of each sample, and GISAID
information, see Supplementary Table S5. We have provided a decision tree (Figure 2C)

variant.

Surveillance of lineage B.1.1.7 reveals increasing prevalence throughout the Slovak
Republic
To determine the prevalence of lineage B.1.1.7 and its spread throughout the Slovak
Republic, regional public health authorities used this test to screen nearly 7,000 samples
previously identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive during three screening rounds over a one month
period. The first surveillance screening for lineage B.1.1.7 on February 2nd, 2021 revealed a
region-specific prevalence of B.1.1.7 ranging from 52% (Žilina) to 85% (Trnava) with an overall
B.1.1.7 prevalance of 75% (Figure 3A-C; Supplementary Table S6). During the second
round of screening held on February 17th, 2021, the majority of regions (5 out of 8) showed
increased prevalence, although due to reduced prevalence in Banská Bystrica, Košice, and
Nitra, the overall prevalence remained at 74%. Closer scrutiny of the data suggests the
reduced prevalence in some regions was caused by samples originating from several “nonB.1.1.7 clusters” (e.g., in social care homes), where all positive samples were likely derived
from a common infection source. Exclusion of these clusters results in a slight increase in
prevalence of 78%. A final screening on March 3rd. 2021 showed increased B.1.1.7 prevalence
in all regions and an overall prevalence of 85%. Taking into consideration estimates of growth
rates (i.e., reproduction number) for lineage B.1.1.7 in the UK [5, 8], we used the prevalences
obtained on the first screening round (February 2nd, 2021) to estimate historical and future
prevalences using a range of two weeks and applying spread factors (3.3 and 5.4) estimated
in other countries (Figure 3D). Although the expected data did not fit with our observed data,
a number of factors likely influence regional spread, including the presence and virulence of
competing SARS-CoV-2 lineages and selection biases from cluster outbreaks.

Discussion

The recent emergence of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant called lineage B.1.1.7 has
sparked global consternation as it has now been confirmed in over 70 countries and threatens
to exacerbate an already dire pandemic. To mitigate the spread of the B.1.1.7 variant, it is
imperative that countries have diagnostic tools that can quickly and accurately detect and track
the prevalence of the variant in order to implement the appropriate epidemiological measures.
Here we report a novel RT-qPCR test to differentiate the B.1.1.7 variant from other SARSCoV-2 lineages. The test consists of running two S gene target assays, one specific for B.1.1.7
and the other for all SARS-CoV-2 strains, and performing a simple comparison of relative Ct
values that allows the user to differentiate the B.1.1.7 variant from other variants that have the
ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion. We validated this test on clinical samples that were sequenced to
determine the exact SARS-CoV-2 lineage and the results demonstrated a high level of
sensitivity in distinguishing the B.1.1.7. variant. Moreover, we retested nearly 7,000 samples
previously confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive by a reference method in three screening
rounds over a one month period, revealing widespread and increasing prevalence of lineage
B.1.1.7 throughout the Slovak Republic. This RT-qPCR test allows a positive identification of
the B.1.1.7 variant, providing countries with a powerful tool to detect and track lineage B.1.1.7,
especially countries that have considerable prevalence of variants carrying only the

ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion [26–29], which are mistakenly identified as B.1.1.7 variants by currently
used SGTF assays.
Although there are hundreds of approved RT-qPCR tests for the detection of SARSCoV-2, few of them are capable of directly differentiating the B.1.1.7 variant from common
variants of SARS-CoV-2. Paradoxically, failed RT-qPCR tests have been instrumental in
identifying putative B.1.1.7 positive samples and tracking its prevalence [26, 28, 30–33]. These
RT-qPCR tests contain multigene assays, with at least one assay targeting the spike gene,
and during routine testing a “drop-out” in the spike gene assay may occur (often termed as S
gene target failure, or SGTF), while other gene targets yield positive signals. This SGTF can
indicate the presence of the B.1.1.7 variant and flag samples for confirmation by sequencing.
It is important to note, however, that SGTPs are produced by other variants that contain the
ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion, including the B.1.1, B1.258, B.1.525, and B.1.1.298 (the mink cluster V)
lineages, as well [7]. This highlights the importance of follow up sequencing of SGTF samples
to determine lineage status.
Indeed, an analysis of SGTFs and corresponding sequencing data by Public Health
England revealed that SGTF assays were poor proxies for the presence of B.1.1.7 in early
October with only 3% of SGTFs assays positively identifying a B.1.1.7 variant. The SGTF
assays only became useful proxies when the variant spread and became more dominant in
late November when the assays then detected over 90% of the variant [34]. Others have
reached a similar conclusion [5, 27, 28, 31, 32, 35], suggesting that the success of SGTF
assays depends on the location, time, and frequency of other variants that contain the
ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion. This is particularly problematic, since the SGTF assays are the least
accurate at the time when the B.1.1.7 variant is at low prevalence, precisely the time when an
accurate test is needed most in order to establish effective mitigation strategies. Our test
outlined here makes significant strides in this effort by accurately differentiating the B.1.1.7
variant with a test that does not rely on a SGTF, thus providing a rapid, accurate test that
eliminates the need to conduct expensive and laborious sequencing to confirm lineage status.

Besides the SGTF tests, a number of commercially available SARS-COV-2 variant
tests are emerging and have been used as surveillance strategies to monitor the prevalence
of variants such as B.1.1.7 [35–40]. These tests are largely based on classical SNP
genotyping methods using either probe-based genotyping or melting curve analyses and
typically focus on mutations that are shared between many variants (e.g., N501Y, E484K, and
ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion), making it difficult to distinguish between variants unless running multiple
SNP assays and then making complex comparisons of melt curves. Similar to SGTF tests,
these approaches, while providing a rapid snapshot of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants,
often require follow up genomic sequencing to identify the particular variant.
Several groups have described publicly available RT-qPCR protocols for detection of
lineage B.1.1.7 that can be divided into SNP genotyping assays using either SYBR- [41] or
probe-based [42] melting curve analyses, multiplexed probe-based RT-qPCR [43–46], and a
combination of target drop-out tests [47]. While these open source RT-qPCR protocols offer
cost-effective, rapid strategies to directly detect multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, some are
limited by only assessing a small number of mutations that preclude identification of specific
variants and most have yet to be tested in real world surveillance scenarios.
To differentiate B.1.1.7, we took an alternative approach by targeting both the
ΔH69/ΔV70 and ΔY144 deletions using allele-specific PCR methods combined with judicious
placement of LNA oligonucleotides. Together, these modifications provided us with a
primer/probe set that retained specificity for B.1.1.7 variants and reduced specificity to other
variants containing only the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion. To highlight the specificity of this assay, our
analysis of all GISAID sequences containing both the ΔH69/ΔV70 and ΔY144 deletions
revealed that a staggering 99.90% of all these sequences belong to lineage B.1.1.7, ensuring
that users can have high confidence that a positive B.1.1.7 assay result is a true positive. Our
test, instead of relying on target failures to identify putative variants, provides a positive signal
in the presence of B.1.1.7 and ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion variants that can easily be differentiated

by comparing their relative Ct values to a common SARS-CoV-2 S gene primer/probe set that
serves as a benchmark.
We successfully monitored the dynamics of lineage B.1.1.7 prevalence by retesting
nearly 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in three successive testing campaigns in
Slovakia. This mass surveillance effort provided invaluable information about the spread and
prevalence of lineage B.1.1.7 without having to conduct expensive and time-consuming
genomic sequencing. Although our observed data did not fit models of previously established
replication numbers for lineage B.1.1.7 [5, 8], we attribute this discrepancy to region specific
presence of other competing SARS-CoV-2 variants. Indeed, a recently described B.1.258
variant that was extensively circulating throughout the Czech Republic and Slovakia [29]
contains mutations in the spike protein (N439K and ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion) that result in higher
viral loads and increased transmissibility [7, 29, 48]. It is plausible that the reproduction
number of B.1.1.7 is altered in a time and region-dependent manner that is associated with
circulation of B.1.258.
The B.1.1.7 RT-qPCR assay described here was also used to screen for B.1.1.7
prevalence in 122 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in the city of Trenčín, Slovakia in December
2020. While we observed 81-85% prevalence of B.1.1.7 in the region of Trenčín in February
2021, Brejová and colleagues [29] reported only 4% prevalence of B.1.1.7 and 41%
prevalence of variants containing only the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion back in December 2020. This
highlights two key points: 1) when considering the B.1.1.7 prevalence in Trenčín in December
2020, the extrapolated historical data using estimated reproduction numbers matches our
observed prevalence seen in Trenčín region on February 2nd, 2021 (Figure 5C). 2) SGTF tests
utilized early on in a scenario like Trenčín would result in many false positive B.1.1.7 samples.
Overall, these data provide real-world evidence of how this B.1.1.7 RT-qPCR assay can be
used in mass surveillance screening to capture critical epidemiological information about the
dynamics of B.1.1.7. It is also important to note that the outcome of the B.1.1.7 RT-qPCR
assay-based screening and the observed trend is greatly in line with the sequence data from

Slovakia available in the GISAID repository (https://www.gisaid.org/). From the clinical
samples collected in Slovakia in February 2021, 83.8% (n=210) were identified as B.1.1.7
lineage while in the samples from March 2021, 97.1% (n=1336) belonged to the B.1.1.7
lineage.
We have provided interested users with the primer and probe sequences to implement
this B.1.1.7 assay in their own laboratories with the hope this can rapidly scale the ability of
countries to identify the B.1.1.7 variant and implement epidemiological measures to mitigate
its spread. This test can provide labs with a powerful tool to directly confirm the presence of
the B.1.1.7 variant in a sample previously determined SARS-CoV-2 positive by an approved
screening test, thus avoiding the use of target gene failure assays that can be plagued with
low specificity and obviating the need to conduct burdensome and costly genomic sequencing.
This is particularly important for countries that are experiencing extensive circulation of
variants harbouring only the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion as current RT-qPCR assays that rely on
SGTFs erroneously classify these samples as presumptive B.1.1.7 variants.

A, B) Heatmaps illustrate oligonucleotide primer and probe combinations designed to target conserved
sequences within the spike gene, including all SARS-CoV-2 variants that were contained in our
bioinformatics analysis. Combinations of forward (F1-F4) and reverse primers (R1-R2) and hydrolysis
probes (P1-P2) were tested using two separate SARS-CoV-2 variants, a common SARS-CoV-2 variant
(Wild type, panel A) and a variant containing the ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion (B). Green rectangle boxes
indicate best performing primer/probe combinations. C, D) Bar graphs compare RT-qPCR performance
of a single probe versus an additional identically labelled dual probe using three 10-fold (101, 102, 103)
dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 template ran in triplicates. Evaluation of the performance was done by
comparing raw Ct values (C) and fluorescence intensity values (D). Statistical analysis was performed
using paired t-test (***p ≤ 0.001, **p ≤ 0.01, *p ≤ 0.05).

located at either the 3’- or 5’-end of the reverse primer. LNA-T displays the number (1-3) of LNAmodified thymine bases for each reverse primer. Mismatch base represents design modifications to

Three different versions (V1, V2, V3) of B.1.1.7 primer/probe sets that varied according to the reverse
primer (V1, V2, and V3 use reverse primers R14, R23, and R36, respectively) were directly compared
on a selected panel of 46 SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical samples, some of which were confirmed B.1.1.7
and B.1.258Δ variants by sequencing. ΔCt values correspond to B.1.1.7 assay Ct − SARS-CoV-2 S gene
assay Ct. Coloured boxes within the plot define boundaries for corresponding variant interpretation, red
(ΔCt ±5) for B.1.1.7, blue (ΔCt 8-20) for ΔH69/ΔV70, grey (ΔCt 5-8) for inconclusive samples. N/A
represents samples which were detected only in SARS-CoV-2 S gene assay and therefore are interpreted

Were the reference standard results
interpreted without knowledge of the results of
the index test results?

Yes

10.

Applicability: Are there concerns that the
target condition as defined by the reference
standard does not match the review question?

No

11.

Was there an appropriate interval between
index test(s) and reference standard?
