Abstract:
Drug target prioritization for new targets and drug repurposing of existing drugs for COVID-19
treatment are urgently needed for the current pandemic. COVID-19 drugs targeting human
proteins will potentially result in less drug resistance but could also exhibit unintended effects on
other complex diseases. Here we pooled 353 candidate drug targets of COVID-19 from clinical
trial registries and the literature and estimated their putative causal effects in 11 SARS-CoV-2
related tissues on 622 complex human diseases. By constructing a disease atlas of drug targets
for COVID-19, we prioritise 726 target-disease associations with evidence of causality using
robust Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization evidence (http://epigraphdb.org/covid19/ctda/). Triangulating these MR findings with historic drug trial information and the druggable
genome, we ranked and prioritised three genes DHODH, ITGB5 and JAK2 targeted by three
marketed drugs (Leflunomide, Cilengitide and Baricitinib) which may have repurposing
potential with careful risk assessment. This study evidences the value of our integrative approach
in prioritizing and repurposing drug targets, which will be particularly applicable when genetic
association studies of COVID-19 are available in the near future.

Introduction
Drug development is expensive and time-consuming. To address this, studies have begun to
promote the development of disciplined pipelines for early therapeutic Research and
Development (R&D) (1) and support the role of genetics in predicting drug trial success (2). In
recent work we have demonstrated the value of proteome-wide and tissue-specific transcriptomewide studies in prioritizing target-indication pairs that are more likely to be successful in clinical
trials (3)(4).
The recent outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
the causative agent of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has become a global pandemic.
The current treatment strategy is focused on maintaining life and organ functions of patients.
Drug development is a component of our response to both COVID-19 and potential future
coronavirus epidemics. At this time, 153 clinical trials have been set up (information from
ClinicalTrial.gov), including Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine and Baricitinib. However, in this
rapidly developing situation, only preliminary results of some early stage trials (5) and
observational studies (6) have been reported, and the efficacy of these drugs against COVID-19
is as yet unproven (7). In addition to COVID-19 trials, alternative evidence for COVID-19 drug
target development has been provided in two ways: i) by determining the host proteins which
interact with SARS-CoV-2; and ii) by exploring the potential translation of SARS-CoV targets to
SAR-CoV-2 therapeutics. The first of these has been addressed by a recent study which
identified 332 human proteins interacting with 26 SARS-CoV-2 proteins using affinity
purification-mass spectrometry in HEK293 cell line. This gives the potential means for an
important potential anti-coronavirus approach—blocking the interaction between human proteins
and SARS-CoV-2 (8). The second relevant strand of evidence comes from SARS-CoV (2003), a
closely related coronavirus, which may provide drug targets for general coronavirus
interventions. One such study has identified 59 mouse genes associated with SARS-CoV using
mouse models (9), of which 44 could be mapped to human genes. The above potential drug
targets, including DHODH as the target gene for Leflunomide, may offer anti-virus therapeutic
mechanisms through inhibiting human proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 rather than the
virus itself, which will potentially result in less drug resistance and generalisability to other
coronaviruses (8). However, they could also exhibit unintended beneficial or adverse effects on
other complex diseases. Systematic assessment of the putative causal effects of these drug targets
on the human phenome using genetics will provide key information on the on-target beneficial
and adverse effects of these COVID-19 targets.
To inform the COVID-19 drug development process, we applied our drug prioritization
pipeline to 353 drug targets which are believed to potentially interact with SARS-CoV-2. We
attempted to test their causal effects on other viral infection phenotypes and explore their
potential on-target beneficial and adverse effects on complex diseases. To achieve these aims,
we built a disease atlas for human proteins and genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 using
plasma proteome-wide and tissue-specific transcriptome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR)
studies, which includes 372,482 unique estimates of target effects on disease. This represents 353
targets versus 49 viral infection phenotypes, 501 complex diseases and 72 disease related
phenotypes evaluated using target gene expression data from 11 SARS-CoV-2 related human
tissues. We further triangulate the estimates of target effect on disease with drug trial information
and the druggable genome to prioritise the most promising drugs targets with good repurposing
potential and few predicted adverse effects. To enable rapid queries, results of all analyses are
available in an open access online platform (http://epigraphdb.org/covid-19/ctda/).

Results
Characteristics of genetic instruments for COVID-19 drug targets
We retrieved drug targets potentially relevant to COVID-19 from three resources (Figure 1): 1)
target genes of 11 drugs under trials for COVID-19 treatment from ClinicalTrials.gov
(Supplementary Table 1); 2) 332 human proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins in
human cell lines (8); 3) 44 genes associated with SARS-CoV in a mouse model (9). After
removing duplicates, 380 unique targets were selected (Supplementary Table 2).
The genetic predictors (instruments) for the 380 target genes in 11 SARS-CoV-2 related tissues
were extracted from 4 recent expression and protein quantitative trait locus (eQTL and pQTL
respectively) studies (3)(10)(11)(12). From these studies 1493 instruments for 353 drug targets
were available for our proteome/transcriptome-wide association analysis (Supplementary Table
3), while the remaining 27 targets have no robustly associated genetic variants.
Disease atlas of COVID-19 drug targets
The target-disease atlas of the 353 drug targets was built using two-sample MR (13)(14) and
colocalization analysis (15), evaluating evidence for their causal effects on 49 viral infection
phenotypes, 501 complex diseases and 72 disease related phenotypes (Supplementary Table 4).
45,590 target-disease associations were tested in plasma proteome and transcriptome in whole
blood (P< 1.1x10-6 at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold). Where data was available, we also
tested the tissue-specific effects of gene expression of the same targets on the outcome
phenotypes. Overall, 372,482 target-disease associations were estimated in the 11 COVID-19
relevant tissues (see the list of tissues in Methods). Overall, we observed 833 target-disease
associations with robust MR evidence in the 11 tested tissues. 726 of the 833 (87.2%)
associations also showed strong colocalization evidence (colocalization probability > 70%)
(Supplementary Table 5, 6, 7 and 8), making these the most reliable findings of this study. Of
these, 366 associations were obtained using a single cis instrument in a Wald ratio model (16),
327 were obtained using a single trans instrument and 33 were estimated using multiple
instruments in an inverse variance weighted (IVW) model (17). The remaining 107 (12.8%)
associations had evidence from MR but did not have strong evidence of colocalization
(probability<70%; Supplementary Table 9), emphasizing the importance of this approach to
address confounding by linkage disequilibrium (LD) in phenome-wide association studies.
Findings from our target-disease atlas can be used to conduct hypothesis-driven
investigations of tissue-dependent effects of target expression on certain diseases. Figure 2
illustrates the effects of target expression in different tissues on four diseases from our atlas:
Crohn's disease (A); hypertension (B); hay fever, allergic rhinitis or eczema (C); and diabetes
(D). Tissue-specific associations were observed between 11 to 17 of the target genes and these
four diseases (Supplementary Table 10). Since these target genes that encode COVID-19interacting proteins also appear to have causal effects on these diseases, it would be important to
carefully assess their potential beneficial and/or adverse effects on these complex diseases in any
future drug target prioritization for COVID-19.
Target – viral infection phenotype associations
In the analysis of the association between the 353 drug targets and 49 viral infection phenotypes,
we identified 2 associations with robust MR (P<1.1x10-6) and colocalization evidence
(probability >70%) using gene expression data in whole blood, including NEU1 associated with

chronic hepatitis and DPY19L1 associated with viral enteritis. Three additional drug targets were
suggestively associated with 3 viral infection phenotypes (P<1x10-3) (Supplementary Table 5).
This included JAK2 (the target gene for a marketed drug, Baricitinib) associated with chronic
hepatitis.
Target – complex disease associations in blood
In the primary analysis in plasma proteome and whole blood transcriptome, we identified 45
potential causal effects of protein levels on disease traits (Supplementary Table 6) and 430
potential causal effects of transcript levels on disease traits (Supplementary Table 7), with both
MR and colocalization evidence. These 475 causal estimates included 95 targets on 105 diseases
and disease related phenotypes. Figure 3 illustrates the MR results of gene expression level of
the JAK2 gene on 501 complex diseases and 72 phenotypes using whole blood data from the
eQTLGen consortium. In this example, the gene expression level of JAK2 was predicted to
influence 9 diseases/phenotypes (Supplementary Table 7), such as atopy, Type 1 diabetes,
inflammatory bowel disease and obesity, which suggested that this target gene is potentially
pleiotropic.
Target-complex disease associations in SARS-CoV-2 related tissues
As a follow-up analysis, we further identified 249 potential tissue-dependent causal effects of
target on disease with robust MR and colocalization evidence. This covered 52 unique genes
based on instruments for expression in 7 tissues against 47 unique diseases (Supplementary
Table 8). Among the 29 tissue-dependent effects of target on disease with robust MR and
colocalization evidence in more than one tissue, 27 of them showed the same direction of effect
across whole blood and multiple other tissues. Only the genetically instrumented gene expression
level of KPNA1 and SRP19 in whole blood and in testis showed opposite direction of effects
against diastolic blood pressure and heel bone mineral density respectively. Figure 4 illustrates
an example of the tissue-dependent effect of DHODH gene on low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C). Inhibition of DHODH gene is the functional mechanism of a marketed
drug, Leflunomide. This drug has been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19
(18)(19). In our MR analysis, we observed that the expression level of DHODH was specifically
associated with LDL-C, which means it did not suffer a major issue of pleiotropy across the
phenome. Moreover, the expression level of DHODH in a wide range of tissues (e.g. lung, testis
and colon, in which the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) is also
highly expressed) were all found to be positively associated with LDL-C.
Drug targets prioritised
We further integrated the 726 target-disease MR associations with clinical trial information from
Open Targets (20), ChEMBL (21), DrugBank (22), Drug-gene-interaction (DGI) (23), the
druggable genome (24) and ClinicalTrial.gov to prioritise drug targets against COVID-19. The
726 associations were further scored based on their putative causal evidence across multiple
tissues and their druggability. More specifically, 4 categories of scores were setup for the
prioritisation, including omics score, infection score, trial score and druggability score. Each of
the scores was scaled between 0 and 1 (Supplementary Table 11). Of the 726 target-disease
associations, only 499 of them were unique target-disease pairs (due to the same pair appearing
in multiple tissues). Two of the 499 associations received high scores in three of the four

categories (making these the highest priority targets), while 77 scored highly in two categories,
and 97 scored highly in one category. 323 of the original 499 associations had low scores in all
categories and are therefore lowest priority (Supplementary Table 12). The top 5 target genes
were DHODH, ITGB5, JAK2, TFRC and POR, scoring 1 in at least two categories and more than
zero in at least one other category. ITGB5 is the target for Cilengitide, which was primarily
developed for treating cancers such as glioblastoma. Our study prioritised this target in three
categories (omics score=1, druggable score=1, trial score=0.75, infection score=0), which
implies that it merits further investigation as a potential target for COVID-19 treatment. In
addition, genetically predicted ITGB5 transcript levels across multiple tissues showed a
consistent negative association with three blood pressure phenotypes, which suggests antihypertensive potential. None of the 5 top targets were strongly associated with potentially acute
comorbidities for COVID-19 treatment such as cardiac dysrhythmias or allergic diseases
(excepting the potential beneficial effect of JAK2 on allergic diseases), which would have raised
concerns about their suitability as COVID-19 targets.
As a contrasting example, TLR9, the target for a marketed drug, Hydroxychloroquine,
showed druggable evidence (druggable score=1, trial score=1) but with a low score for MR
evidence across omics/tissues (omics score=0, infection score=0). Despite the reported antiviral
activity of Chloroquine against COVID-19 in vitro (25), a recent study emulating a target trial
suggested no evidence of any antiviral activity or clinical benefit combining
Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients (26). A
recent systematic review and meta-analysis of observational evidence also suggested no clinical
benefits of Hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 patients (27). In addition to the
efficacy concerns previously raised for Hydroxychloroquine, our phenome-wide MR results
further suggested that reduced TLR9 expression increases risk of cardioembolic stroke, asthma
and some immune related diseases (Supplementary Table 13), consistent with some concerns
previously expressed in the literature (28).

Discussion
Genetic methods such as MR and colocalization provide a rapid and cost-effective approach to
prioritise drug targets in the early stages of drug development (3)(29), providing an indication of
efficacy and potential on-target beneficial or adverse effects (30)(31). In this study, we integrated
a list of 380 coronavirus-related drug targets from COVID-19 trials and in vitro experiments. We
pooled data on genetic associations with these drug targets from 4 recent molecular phenotype
genome-side association studies (GWASs) (3)(10)(11)(12), identifying 353 drug targets for
which there were reliable genetic predictors which could be used as instruments in MR. By
applying tissue-specific MR of gene expression and plasma protein levels, we were able to
estimate the causal effects of these targets on 49 viral infection phenotypes, 501 complex
diseases and 72 disease related phenotypes, in total estimating 372,482 effects. Of these,
potentially causal effects in 726 target-phenotype pairs were estimated with robust MR and
colocalization evidence. These results provide evidence of on-target safety issues and/or
beneficial effects of the COVID-19 drug targets. To enable this evidence to be widely accessible
for drug target research, we constructed an open access browser allowing rapid queries of the
drug targets, genetic predictors of the target genes and the disease atlas
(http://epigraphdb.org/covid-19/ctda/).
This study supports drug target prioritization for treatment of COVID-19 and other diseases
in three ways: 1) investigating potential on-target safety issues for approved drugs under trials
for COVID-19 treatment; 2) prioritizing drug targets that merit further evaluation for COVID-19;
3) identifying tissue-specific effects of the drug targets on the human phenome.
First, our study provides evidence of the potential on-target safety issues of marketed drugs
in trials for COVID-19 treatment. For example, Baricitinib, a cyclin G-associated kinase
inhibitor, has been suggested as a drug for COVID-19 treatment (32) and is now in trials for
efficacy evaluation (CTID: NCT04320277). It was proposed to reduce systemic inflammation by
inhibiting JAK2 protein. In our study, we observed a putative causal effect of JAK2 expression
on chronic hepatitis, which aligned with literature evidence of hepatitis B reactivation following
ruxolitinib treatment (inhibitor of JAK2) (33). Our phenome-wide association analysis further
suggested that reducing the gene expression of JAK2 was not strongly associated with increased
risk of acute conditions (cardiac dysrhythmias or allergic diseases). Although JAK2 reduction
may increase weight and risk of inflammatory bowel disease, potential Baricitinib use for
COVID-19 treatment will be short-term, and these side effects are probably inconsequential.
Second, our prioritization approach highlighted three drugs with potential for COVID-19
treatment, including Leflunomide (target: DHODH), Cilengitide (target: ITGB5), and E2.3
(under Phase I trial, target: TFRC). Leflunomide is an immune suppressive drug used for
autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (34). It also showed antiviral effect against a
wide range of DNA and RNA viruses, such as herpes simplex virus (35), human
cytomegalovirus (36)(37), polyoma BK virus (38)(39), Junín virus (40), influenza A virus, Zika
virus and Ebola virus. Recent studies also suggested its anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect (18)(19). In
addition, our MR finding suggested the lipid lowering potential of Leflunomide use, which
merits further investigation. For Cilengitide (ITGB5), our MR analyses suggested that reduced
gene expression level of ITGB5 showed a consistent effect on lowering systolic and diastolic
blood pressure level and lowering hypertension risk. This implies its potential anti-hypertensive
effect. Hypertension has been suggested as a potential risk factor for complications of COVID-

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.20093286; this version posted May 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

19 (41). Cilengitide could be a promising candidate drug for COVID-19 treatment with antihypertensive potential as well.
Third, the tissue-specific results suggested that expression levels of some targets across
multiple tissues were associated with the same phenotypes, while some other targets showed
apparent tissue-specific effects on diseases/phenotypes. For example, expression levels of
DHODH and ITGB5 in multiple tissues showed similar causal effects on LDL-C and blood
pressure respectively. When designing trials based on these drug targets, careful pre-clinical
investigation is needed to understand the tissue-specific mechanisms of the targets on tested
indications.
Some limitations of our analysis are worth noting. Whilst initiatives are underway to collect
genetic information for COVID-19 patients (e.g. the COVID-19 host genetics initiative,
https://covid-19genehostinitiative.net/) and in the UK Biobank (42), no such GWAS of COVID19 phenotypes has yet been performed. Our evaluation of potential targets therefore excludes
estimated effects of these targets on COVID-19 disease risk or progression. In the near future
such data is likely to become available in a number of large-scale population-based biobanks
across the world, including the UK Biobank, China Kadoorie Biobank (43), HUNT study (44),
FinnGen (https://www.finngen.fi/fi), DeCODE (https://www.decode.com/) and the Million
Veteran Program (45). These biobanks are designed to study long-term health conditions, but
with data linkage between these biobanks and electronic health records and/or COVID-19 data
(as has recently happened with UK Biobank), these biobanks could be tremendous resources to
rapidly generate genetic association data in epidemic and pandemic situations. The recent initial
GWAS of COVID-19 found no GWAS hits, which highlight the importance of seriously
considering potential bias of the data. When the unbiased data are available, the drug target
information and the genetic predictors of the 353 drug targets we curated in this study as well as
the drug target prioritization pipeline could provide even more valuable insights into the
potential drug targets for infectious disease treatment. A second limitation is that the drug targets
evaluated in this study were proxied using a limited number of instruments, which means the
putative causal effects rely on one or two genetic instruments. Even though our results suggest
some biological links between the target and diseases, these only provide evidence for the very
first step of the drug development process. Finally, whilst these are plausible targets for COVID19, we can’t predict whether successful intervention would impact on risk of infection,
progression/severity of disease or other disease characteristics relevant to public health (e.g. viral
shedding).
In conclusion, this study identified 726 putatively causal effects between the 353 COVID-19
related targets and the human phenome using MR and colocalization approaches. These
associations support causality but do not prove it, as horizontal pleiotropy remains an alternative
possibility. Our study provides both a statistical genetics pipeline and an openly available
platform to prioritise potential COVID-19 targets on the basis of MR and existing trial evidence.
The platform also evaluated repurposing opportunities for approved drugs on other indications.
Our approach and platform will provide additional value once genetic association studies of
COVID-19 are available in the near future.

Materials and Methods
Selection of drug targets of COVID-19
In this study, drug targets against COVID-19 were selected from three resources: i) a list of 11
drugs under trials for COVID-19 treatment were extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19;). 10 of these 11 drugs were mapped to
their target genes using Drug-Gene-Interaction (DGI) database (http://dgidb.org/) (23) and
CHEMBL database (21) (Supplementary Table 1); ii) 332 human proteins interacting with
SARS-CoV-2 proteins from Gordon et al. (8); iii) 44 genes associated with SARS-CoV from
Gralinski et al. (9). After de-duplicating these, 380 unique drug targets were selected for our
study (Supplementary Table 2).
Selection of genetic instruments for the target genes
Next, gene and protein expression levels of these targets were looked up from four resources:
protein expression levels in plasma from four studies (29)(46)(47)(48) implemented in Zheng et
al. (3), gene expression levels in whole blood from eQTLGen consortium (10), tissue specific
gene expression levels in 7 tissues from the GTEx consortium (11) and gene expression levels in
two kidney tissues from Gilles et al. (12). After the mapping step, 353 drug targets with genetic
variants robustly associated with the transcripts and/or proteins were included as the start point
of the instrument selection (Supplementary Table 2).
The genetic variants, genes and proteins were further mapped to genome build GRCh37.p13
coordinates and we used the following criteria to select genetic instruments:
1. We selected SNPs that were associated with any protein or gene expression (using a Pvalue threshold ≤5x10-8) in at least one of the four GWASs, including both cis and trans
instruments.
2. We then conducted LD clumping for the instruments with the TwoSampleMR R package
(14) to identify independent instruments for each protein/gene. We used r2 < 0.001 as the
threshold to exclude correlated instruments in the cis (or trans) gene region.
After instrument selection, 1493 instruments were kept for the genetic analyses of this study
(Supplementary Table 3).
Identifying cis and trans instruments
We split instruments into two groups: 1) 1269 cis-acting instruments within a 500Kb window
from each side of the leading pQTL of the protein/gene; 2) 224 instruments outside the 500Kb
window of the leading pQTL were designated as trans instruments. Whilst trans instruments may
be more prone to pleiotropy, their inclusion could increase statistical power as well as the scale
of the study. Therefore, for the proteins and genes with cis instruments or trans instruments, we
conducted MR analyses using both sets of instruments (Supplementary Table 3).
Association of genetic variants with human phenotypes
We obtained effect estimates for the association of the proteins and genes with viral infection
phenotypes and complex human phenotypes using GWAS summary statistics which were
obtained from the GWAS Catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/downloads/summary-statistics)
(49), IEU GWAS database (http://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/) (14) and SAIGE UK Biobank data release

(https://www.leelabsg.org/resources) (50). We used the following inclusion criteria to select
complex phenotypes to be analysed:
1. The GWAS with the greatest expected statistical power (e.g. largest sample size or
number of cases) when multiple GWAS records of the same disease or quantitative
phenotype were available.
2. GWAS with effect sizes, standard errors and effect alleles for all tested variants (i.e. full
GWAS summary statistics available).
After selection, 49 viral infection phenotypes and 501 complex diseases were defined as primary
outcomes. 72 quantitative phenotypes were defined as secondary outcomes (Supplementary
Table 4).
Causal inference and sensitivity analyses
Mendelian randomization analysis
In the initial MR analysis, 55 instruments of 39 plasma proteins (N=3,301) and 833 instruments
of 331 gene transcripts in whole blood (N=31,684) were used as the exposures to proxy the
effect of the 353 drug targets for COVID-19 (Supplementary Table 3), which maximized the
statistical power of the study and supported us to obtain an overall view of the target-phenotype
associations across multiple disease areas. 49 viral infection phenotypes, 501 complex diseases
and 72 quantitative phenotypes were used as the outcomes. Due to missingness of available
exposure or outcome data, the causal relations of 353 targets on 622 human phenotypes were
tested in this study. We selected a P-value threshold of 0.05, corrected for the number of
independent tests, as our threshold for prioritising MR results for follow up analyses (number of
tests= 45,590; P< 1.1x10-6). The Wald ratio (16) method was used to obtain MR effect estimates
for targets with only one instrument, where the Wald ratio MR effect estimates were sensitive to
the particular choice of instrument. For targets with two or more instruments, the IVW method
(17) was used to estimate the causal effects.
Colocalization analysis
Results that survived the Bonferroni corrected threshold (P< 1.1x10-6) in the MR analysis were
evaluated using colocalization analysis, which estimates the posterior probability of each
genomic locus containing a single variant affecting both the target and the phenotype (15). The
prior probabilities that a variant is equally associated with each phenotype (p1=1×10-4; p2=1×104
) and both phenotypes jointly (p12=1×10-5) were used for this analysis. A posterior probability
of > 70% for the colocalization hypothesis in this analysis would suggest that the two association
signals are likely to colocalize within the test region (noted as “Colocalised”). The same
colocalization approach was applied to cis- and trans- instruments. In addition, we conducted an
approximate colocalization analysis (called LD check), in which the LD between the sentinel
variant of each target and the 30 strongest SNPs in the region associated with the phenotype were
checked. LD r2 > 0.7 between the sentinel variant and any of the 30 SNPs associated with the
phenotype was used as evidence of colocalization (noted as “LD Check”). The rest of the targetphenotype associations were noted as “Not colocalised”.
Tissue Specificity analysis
The functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 (51), is highly expressed in multiple organs,
including gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, testis, and kidney. This is consistent with the fact

that whilst SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily manifests with acute respiratory illness, SARSCoV-2 can also be detected in faeces (52) and kidney tubules (53). The presence of SARS-CoV2 in the alimentary tract for longer than in the respiratory system (54) suggests that the intestine
may be a hidden reservoir of SARS-CoV-2. We therefore set out to explore differences in
potential target effects in different tissues. In order to understand the tissue specific effects of the
candidate targets of COVID-19 on human phenotypes, we selected the 9 tissues in which ACE2
is highly expressed, including testis, lung, kidney cortex, kidney glomerular, kidney
tubulointerstitial, stomach, colon transverse, small intestine terminal ileum and colon sigmoid.
Tissue specific gene expression data of the 353 targets in each selected tissue were obtained
from two studies: GTEx V8 and Gillies et al (11)(12). After selection, 580 instruments of 218
gene transcripts were selected in the 9 tissues, which included 141 instruments for 132 gene
transcripts in testis, 125 instruments for 115 transcripts in lung, 20 instruments for 20 transcripts
in kidney cortex, 6 instruments for 6 in kidney glomerular, 8 instruments for 8 transcripts in
kidney tubulointerstitial, 71 instruments for 67 transcripts in stomach, 84 instruments for 81
transcripts in colon sigmoid, 98 instruments for 96 transcripts in colon transverse and 41
instruments for 39 transcripts in small intestine terminal ileum (Supplementary Table 3). The
same MR and colocalization analysis pipeline were applied for the tissue specific analysis.
Analysis software
The MR analyses (including Wald ratio, single SNP MR, IVW) were conducted using the MRBase TwoSampleMR R package (github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR) (14). The MR results
were plotted as Manhattan plots and forest plots using code derived from the ggplot2 package in
R (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html).
Triangulation of evidence with drug trial information
For the 154 drug targets with suggestive MR and colocalization evidence (P of MR < 1x10-5 and
colocalization probability >70%), we mapped the drug targets with related drug names using four
platforms: OpenTargets (20), ChEMBL (21), DrugBank (22) and DGI platforms (23). After this
analysis, we mapped 40 targets to their targeted drugs (Supplementary Table 14). The trial
information of these 40 drugs were further looked up from ClinicalTrial.gov or WHO ATC
(https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/) websites, which includes the indication, the trial status
(recruiting or completed), the action type of the drug (inhibitor or antagonist), the
ClinicalTrial.gov ID (CTID) or ATC ID and maximum trial phase.
We further mapped the targets to the previously reported “druggable genome” (24). This
study stratified the potential drug targets from across the genome into three tiers. Tier 1 (1427
genes) included efficacy targets of approved small molecules and biotherapeutic drugs, as well as
targets modulated by clinical-phase drug candidates; tier 2 was composed of 682 genes encoding
proteins closely related to drug targets, or with associated drug-like compounds; and tier 3
contained 2370 genes encoding secreted or extracellular proteins, distantly related proteins to
approved drug targets. For the COVID-19 drug targets, 16 targets were mapped to tier 1, 4
targets to tier 2 and 17 targets to tier 3 (Supplementary Table 12).
Evidence-based drug targets prioritisation
For the 726 target-disease associations with suggestive MR and colocalization evidence, we
prioritised the COVID-19 related drug targets by four separate categories of scores: 1) Omics

score (0 or 1), which estimates whether a specific target-disease association showed robust MR
evidence in both proteome and transcriptome levels or in more than one tissue; 2) Infection score
(0 or 1), which refers to whether the target showed strong association with at least one of the
viral infection phenotypes we tested; 3) Druggable score (0 to 1), which refers to the druggability
of the target (data from Finnan et al); 4) Trial score (0 to 1), which refers to the trial stage of the
target (e.g. Pre-clinical to Phase 4). More details of the score system is listed in Supplementary
Table 11.
COVID-19 Target-Disease Atlas (CTDA) browser of the EpiGraphDB platform
We have made all results openly available to browse or download at the COVID-19 TargetDisease Atlas (CTDA) browser within the EpiGraphDB platform (http://epigraphdb.org/covid19/ctda/). This includes 372,482 unique target-disease associations evidence for 353 targets on
622 diseases/phenotypes in 11 SARS-CoV-2 related tissues. Users are able to query the study
results by the targeted gene name, outcome disease name, and the tissues via the online platform,
and the results are presented in searchable tables as well as volcano plots. In addition, users can
programmatically access the results using the /covid-19/ctda endpoints in the application
programming interface (API) of EpiGraphDB via http://api.epigraphdb.org/.
