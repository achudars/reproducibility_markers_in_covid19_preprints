ABSTRACT
College reopening decisions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represent a trade-off between competing
risks to students, faculty and staff, and college finances. Additionally, risks taken in reopening colleges
can impose significant burdens on individuals living in surrounding communities. Many colleges that
reopened for in-person instruction have reported frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. La Crosse County,
Wisconsin experienced a substantial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (2,002 cases in September 2020) that
coincided with the return to in-person instruction at three local academic institutions. Genomic
sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 cases in La Crosse during that period found rapid expansion of two viral
substrains. Although the majority of cases were among college-age individuals, from a total of 111
genomes sequenced we identified rapid transmission of the virus into more vulnerable populations.
Eight sampled genomes represented two independent transmission events into two skilled nursing
facilities, resulting in two fatalities. Our study highlights the very significant risks imposed by college
administrator reopening decisions, not just on college-associated populations, but on vulnerable
individuals in surrounding communities.

INTRODUCTION
The SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus is a novel respiratory pathogen which emerged in Wuhan, China in late
2019 (1). Numerous teams around the world have produced a rapidly increasing number of publicly
available sequences (116,650 in GISAID on 9/28/20) with obvious sequence diversification as viral
replication and spread has continued. These sequence variants, inherited in each cycle of viral
replication, allow the generation of phylogenetic trees through which the evolution of the virus can be
traced. Individual viruses acquire mutations during replication at an approximate rate of 1-2 sites per
month (2). This mutation rate provides good resolution for both global and local tracking of viral
substrains. Because viral replication occurs in individuals, tracking these inherited variants acts as a
proxy for tracking the spread of the virus through populations of individuals.
Starting in late March 2020, we have monitored the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 to the
service area of the Gundersen Health System, an integrated healthcare system headquartered in La
Crosse, WI and providing care in 21 counties in southwestern Wisconsin, northeastern Iowa and
southeastern Minnesota. We have performed whole viral genome sequencing on 514 positive cases
from this region, spanning three states which have adopted mitigation approaches of differing intensity.
In September 2020, La Crosse County (Wisconsin) experienced a rapid increase in cases, strongly driven
by infections among the 10-19 and 20-29 age groups. The period coincided with the return of college
students to three institutions of higher education in the city of La Crosse: University of Wisconsin La
Crosse, Western Technical College and Viterbo University, with total enrollments of 10,558, 4,004 and
2,592, respectively (3). Our regional SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and sequencing program captured many of
these genomes, allowing assessment of the substrain contributions to the outbreak and analysis of the
speed with which vulnerable non-student populations were affected.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens
Specimens were nasopharyngeal swabs taken for diagnostic purposes and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2
positivity at the Gundersen Medical Foundation’s Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory using the CDC 2019nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic assay. This study includes positive cases diagnosed between

3/18/2020 and 9/23/2020. Ethical approval was obtained from the Gundersen Health System
Institutional Review Board (#2-20-03-008; PI: Kenny) to perform additional next-generation sequencing
on remnant specimens after completion of diagnostic testing. Samples for this study include only those
testing positive in Gundersen Healthcare System’s diagnostic laboratories and, as such, do not include
other cases from the region which may have been tested in other healthcare systems and/or public
health laboratories.

RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Nasopharyngeal swabs were immersed in liquid medium. RNA was isolated using QIAmp Viral RNA Mini
kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). cDNA was synthesized from 5 μl of purified RNA using ProtoScript II First
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) with random hexamers.

Next Generation sequencing
We used the Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Panel (Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA) to sequence 237 viral
specific targets encompassing the complete viral genome from cDNA derived from SARS-COV-2-positive
clinical specimens. Barcoded multiplexed libraries were prepared in batches of eight on the Ion Chef
(Thermo-Fisher) and sequenced on the Ion Torrent S5 (Thermo-Fisher).

Bioinformatics
Demultiplexed Tmap-aligned bam files were produced by the Ion Torrent S5. To overcome difficulties
caused by read soft-clipping by this non-splice aware aligner, individual sequence reads were extracted
using samtools (4) and re-aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 genome using a splice-aware aligner, hisat2 (5).
These bam files were subjected to QC review in IGV. Samples passing QC had a consensus sequence
computed according to the method of Cavener (6). Consensus sequences were reported to GISAID (7).
For phylogenetic inference (i.e. to determine the hierarchy of case relationships) samples were
integrated with associated metadata and aligned on a local implementation of NextStrain (8) using
augur and displayed via a web browser using auspice. Choropleth maps were generated using folium.

RESULTS
The cumulative history of SARS-CoV-2 cases, stratified by age, for La Crosse county is shown in Figure 1.
Notable events along this timeline include the reopening of bars in Wisconsin (5/14/2020) and the onset

of warm summer weather (first day above 80’F was on Memorial Day Weekend on 5/24/2020) which
preceded a rapid rise in cases in early-mid June. Case growth continued at a slower rate for much of the
summer before abruptly increasing in the second week of September, coinciding with the return of
students to three colleges located in the city of La Crosse. Analysis of cases by census tract showed that
the most rapid case growth was occurring the immediate vicinity of the three colleges, an area of high
density student housing (Figure 2).
Between 3/18/20 and 9/23/20 we obtained 514 high quality genomes (Figure 3A) from surveillance in a
21-county region of western Wisconsin, southeastern Minnesota and northeastern Iowa. Clades are
colored for ease of visualization and include several epidemiologically relevant outbreaks. Significant
examples include (i) an outbreak originating in a meatpacking plant in Postville, IA (9) and (ii) a large
outbreak associated with a cluster of bars in downtown La Crosse in June/July. Figure 3B highlights
newly sequenced genomes in our region in September 2020. The overwhelming majority of case growth
in La Crosse county was explained by two clusters, designated “College A” and “College B”. The small
light-blue cluster at the 11 o’clock position represents a substrain detected in the city of Holmen, which
did not involve college students, while the other highlighted clades represented case growth in our
region outside of La Crosse county. Here we focus on the analysis of the College A and College B clusters.
During this period, all three academic institutions posted “COVID19 dashboards” on their websites,
analysis of which indicated that the majority of cases were associated with the largest institution
(University of Wisconsin – La Crosse, “UWL”), followed by Viterbo University and with relatively few
cases affecting students enrolled at Western Technical College. UWL ran its own surveillance and
diagnostic program for students living in dormitories (approximately 3000 students), but did not deploy
resources sufficient to provide any surveillance for its large off-campus student population. Our
sequencing program captured all positive tests conducted at the Gundersen Health System molecular
diagnostic laboratory, a service availed of by many members of the off-campus population. Accordingly,
while we generally lack genomes from the student dorm populations, our considerable coverage of the
off-campus population and the presumably large amount of intermixing that occurred between the on
and-off campus student populations due to the prevalent “party culture” (10,11) makes it unlikely that a
substantial outbreak comprising an unrelated substrain might have occurred in and been restricted to
the dorm-dwelling population.

Demographic details of the 111 individuals carrying the College A and B substrains are shown in Table 1.
In total, 40.5% of the specimens were obtained from individuals aged between 17 and 24, with a further
16.2% from the 25-29 age group. For the entire cohort, 57.7% of cases affected females, although cases
were more evenly distributed between sexes among the 17-29 year old group. 19 cases (17.1%) affected
individuals aged over 60, including 4 cases among individuals in their 90s. This pattern of spread from
clusters of younger age individuals into more vulnerable age groups is consistent with observations of a
time-lag in which cases among older individuals tend to rise after outbreaks among young individuals
(12). Although this statistical trend is evident from a nationwide analyses (12), our ability to establish
direct genetic links using sequencing between the two age groups provides compelling evidence that
risks of rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 among college-age individuals are not limited to college environs but
pose a direct threat to older persons in the surrounding community.

Detailed phylogenetic trees for both College A and B clusters are shown in Figure 4. Trees are scaled to
show genetic divergence of the virus, such that samples aligned vertically are genetically identical and
placement of a sample one increment to the right indicates acquisition of a single new mutation. Within
both clusters, we found evidence of subgroups sharing identical viruses which typically reflect
individuals infected in quick succession from a common source (e.g. at one or more parties). Groups of
cases containing five or more genetically identical genomes are highlighted in orange, and the median
age of individuals in these four groups were 20.5, 21, 25 and 29. This pattern is consistent with rapid
spread of SARS-CoV-2 among the younger age group. Although both College A and B clusters included
older individuals (See Table 1), analysis of the College B cluster indicated that this particular substrain
had been transmitted into two skilled nursing facilities. The sequencing data revealed independent
clusters affecting three patients in one facility and two staff and five patients in the second facility. Two
of these patients died from COVID-19.

DISCUSSION
This study provides an interim yet comprehensive look at a still-ongoing outbreak centered on the
neighborhoods surrounding college campuses in a midwestern city, La Crosse, WI. While the 111
genomes sampled represent a fraction of the total cases in La Crosse county in this September outbreak,
the data appear sufficient to draw some important conclusions about the nature of the outbreak and
early consequences for vulnerable populations, as well as prompting consideration of whether various
mitigation strategies adopted elsewhere could have been helpful.
Firstly, this large outbreak was overwhelmingly driven by just two substrains of SARS-CoV-2 which was
quite surprising. Restarting of in-person education involved the return of many thousands of students
from a wide range of cities and small towns throughout the Midwest at a time when SARS-CoV-2 cases
in Midwestern 18-22 year olds were increasing at a rate more than twice the national average for that
age group (13). Accordingly, we had expected greater viral diversity consistent with multiple
independent viral introductions. In contrast, the major signal detected was for just two substrains which
spread very rapidly among an at-risk population which socialized repeatedly at high-density alcoholfueled indoor and outdoor gatherings. We cannot exclude the possibility that there were additional
contemporaneous viral introductions and that these two substrains fortuitously happened to be the
earliest to be exposed to large susceptible populations at events favoring rapid SARS-CoV-2 spread such
that other potential substrains did not have the opportunity to access such a large susceptible

population. Nevertheless, our data imply that the overwhelming majority of students were SARS-CoV-2negative upon return to the campus environs and that rapid local spread, rather than imported cases,
was the primary cause of the local outbreak.
Nationally, several universities made very considerable financial investments in pre-testing all students
before their return to campus, a mitigation strategy that was not attempted in La Crosse. Our data
suggest that, had that strategy been employed in La Crosse, it would have had a negligible impact on
preventing the outbreak. At best, it might have delayed an inevitable outcome by a few days. Clearly,
introduction of just two viral substrains was sufficient to fuel this very significant outbreak. In a setting
where students from multiple colleges interact with each other and with other residents of a city with
pre-existing SARS-COV-2 cases, student behavior will likely lead to significant outbreaks whether the
initial student-imported viral input is large or small.
Testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic students after college opening is likely a more useful
intervention, if performed at a sufficient frequency. When modeling multiple scenarios to mitigate
SARS-CoV-2 spread during college re-opening for an 80-day fall semester, Paltiel and colleagues
estimated that testing the entire student population every two days could limit cumulative infections to
4.9% of students, while weekly testing would result in 37% of students becoming infected (14).
Importantly, both estimates involved assumptions of strong adherence to mask-wearing, handwashing,
social-distancing, de-densifying classrooms and limiting bathroom sharing. The UWL plan for its 10,500
student body involved asymptomatic testing of its dormitory resident population (3000 students) once
every 14 days with no surveillance testing among the much larger off-campus population. Considering
that Paltiel estimated that testing 100% of an idealized guideline-adherent student population weekly
would still lead to a cumulative infection rate of 37%, it seems likely that testing only 28% of an actual
student population at half that frequency would be utterly inadequate to manage inevitable outbreaks.
Success in Paltiel’s model also required efficiently functioning quarantine and isolation dormitories, a
situation at variance with the chaotic situation at UWL where student reporters described individuals
quarantined while the results of their tests were pending, partying in the quarantine dorm with
COVID19-positive individuals, and then being released when their pre-quarantine test returned negative
(15).

We detected these student-amplified infection clusters as part of a 21-county surveillance program in
the Gundersen Healthcare System’s service area. Because this program was not student focused, we
were collecting and sequencing other community cases in parallel. This allowed us to quickly detect the
overspill from the college-age population in older adults. While these findings were consistent with
public health expectations about risk to older population in settings of wide community spread and with
epidemiological studies showing a statistical association in which case increases in young adults are
typically followed by cases among older adults (12), our ability to genetically link these groups of cases
provides direct evidence of transmission between these different age groups. Of particular concern, was
the rapid transmission of one of these SARS-CoV-2 substrains into two skilled nursing facilities, causing
sustained outbreaks with two fatalities so far. Our first case of what we came to call the “College B”
cluster was collected on 8/27/20, a time when cases were slowly but steadily rising (Figure 1). The
inflection point on the curve when cases began to rise more rapidly was on 9/10/20 (Figure 1) and the
first skilled nursing facility patient specimen associated with this cluster was detected on 9/14/20.

CONCLUSIONS
For college clusters, much concern has focused on higher risks to older faculty/staff as well as less
frequent but significant adverse outcomes in younger individuals. In addition, university leaders clearly
face a range of concerns including very significant financial pressures. Given the described testing
strategy, the highly contagious properties of SARS-CoV-2, news reports of widespread outbreaks in
other college communities that had attempted return to in-person instruction at earlier dates (16,17)
and the well-understood risk-embracing nature of college students (18), the outbreak that occurred in
La Crosse in September 2020 was likely inevitable once the decision to return to in-person instruction
was taken. Our study highlights the very significant risks imposed by college administrator reopening
decisions, not just on college-associated populations, but on vulnerable individuals in surrounding
communities. Although our primary focus has been on using viral genetics to track introduction and
spread of these substrains, we note that the adverse effects of college-amplified clusters are not limited
to the morbidity and mortality of infected individuals and the substantial associated healthcare costs.
Rapid case growth, as experienced in La Crosse, intensifies the magnitude of the multifaceted adverse
effects of the pandemic upon communities. These effects include significantly extending the period
during which children are unable to attend in-person K-12 schooling (19), further exacerbation of the
many psychosocial stresses affecting both individuals and families (20), extending the ongoing
unemployment crisis (21), placing more families at risk of losing health insurance (22) and harming small

colleges and universities.
