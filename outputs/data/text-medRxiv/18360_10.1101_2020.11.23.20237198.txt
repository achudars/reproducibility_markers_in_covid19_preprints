Abstract

2

Objectives: Antigen tests have recently emerged as an interesting alternative to SARS-CoV-

3

2 diagnostic PCR, thought to be valuable especially for the screening of bigger communities.

4

To check appropriateness of the antigen based testing, we determined sensitivity of two

5

point-of-care antigen tests when applied to a cohort of COVID-19 symptomatic, COVID-19

6

asymptomatic and healthy persons.

7

Methods: We examined nasopharyngeal swabs with antigen test 1 (Panbio Covid-19 Ag

8

Rapid Test, Abbott) and antigen test 2 (Standard F Covid-19 Ag FIA, SD Biosensor). An

9

additional nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab of the same individual was checked with

10

PCR (Allplex SARS-nCoV-2, Seegene). Within a 4-day period in October 2020, we collected

11

specimens from 591 subjects. Of them, 290 had COVID-19 associated symptoms.

12

Results: While PCR positivity was detected in 223 cases, antigen test 1 and antigen test 2

13

were found positive in 148 (sensitivity 0.664, 95% CI 0.599 - 0.722) and 141 (sensitivity

14

0.623, 95% CI 0.558 - 0.684) patients, respectively. When only symptomatic patients were

15

analysed, sensitivity increased to 0.738 (95% CI 0.667 - 0.799) for the antigen test 1 and to

16

0.685 (95% CI 0.611 - 0.750) for the antigen test 2. The substantial drop in sensitivity to

17

12.9% (95% CI 0.067 - 0.234) was observed for samples with the PCR threshold cycle above

18

> 30.

19

Conclusions: Low sensitivity of antigen tests leads to the considerable risk of false

20

negativity. It is advisable to implement repeated testing with high enough frequency if the

21

antigen test is used as a frontline screening tool.

Introduction

2

Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is a key factor for making the

3

containment measures effective. Since the beginning of the pandemic, a nucleic acid

4

detection by PCR has become a gold standard of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

5

diagnostics (1). However, not fast enough turnaround time, a need for laboratory equipment

6

and the shortage of reagents and plastic consumables raised concerns over the time about

7

the PCR as the only frontline tool for testing, especially in surveillance regimes where great

8

numbers of people need to be tested in relatively short time frames (2).

9

To overcome technical barriers associated with the use of PCR, point of care tests have

10

been considered to complement diagnostic PCR tests and to be used for fast and onsite

11

examination in various settings with suspected outbreaks of COVID-19. These include not

12

only institutions and semi-closed communities such as schools and care homes (WHO

13

interim guidance (3)), but even whole districts and countries, screened in the way of

14

population-wide testing (ECDC Report (4)).

15

An attractive candidate which meets the logistic criteria for mass testing is an antigen-based

16

detection of SARS-CoV-2 on the principle of immunochromatography. The test is

17

inexpensive, rapid, ready and easy to use. Nevertheless, rapid antigen tests have potential

18

limits in terms of low sensitivity that had been repeatedly documented for other respiratory

19

viruses (5). First reports on the performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection indicated

20

similar findings (6-8), although the manufacturers of commercially available SARS-CoV-2

21

antigen tests commonly claim sensitivities over 90%. However, these values reflect results of

22

studies done on individuals who meet the criteria for the intended use of the kits, i.e.

23

diagnostics of COVID-19 in patients with clinical symptoms, not in a mixed population of

24

symptomatic, asymptomatic and healthy persons.

1

In our pilot study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of two antigen tests in a scenario

2

close to the population-wide testing. In this regard, we tested a group of nearly 600 people

3

who had no common epidemiological link between each other.

Methods

6

Subjects. Within a 4-day period in October 2020, we tested 591 individuals of 10 years of

7

age or older, who attended a single collection site, dedicated to the SARS-CoV-2 specimen

8

collection at the Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic, and consented to the

9

study. The main reasons for their SARS-CoV-2 collection site visit were either the suspicion

10

of COVID-19 infection (273 patients) or contact tracing (290 cases). While 511 persons were

11

referred by general practitioner or public health officer, 54 individuals were self-payers. The

12

mean age of the cohort was 40 years (age range 12 to 78 years), 44.7% were males. Nearly

13

one half of the population (290 subjects) self-reported presence of one or more of the

14

following symptoms: cough, pain of muscles and/or joints, chills, diarrhoea and/or vomiting,

15

elevated body temperature, loss of smell and/or taste. The study was approved by the

16

hospital Ethics Committee (ref no EK-1286/20).

17

Antigen tests and PCR. Upon the subject's consent, we sampled three separate

18

nasopharyngeal swabs and one additional swab from the oropharynx. Two nasopharyngeal

19

samples were used onsite for two antigen detection assays according to the manufacturers'

20

instructions: Panbio Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott, Germany; hereafter referred to as "Ag

21

test 1") and Standard F Covid-19 Ag FIA (SD Biosensor, Republic of Korea; hereafter

22

referred to as "Ag test 2"). Briefly, the swab was first inserted into an extraction buffer

23

provided with the kit, then the amount of 5 (Ag test 1) or 4 drops (Ag test 2) was loaded on

24

the test device. The results were read after 15 minutes incubation at room temperature by a

25

naked eye (Ag test 1) or after 30 minutes incubation at room temperature on the bench (Ag

26

test 2) in the Standard F200 Analyser ('read-only' mode). In order not to unnecessarily lose

the sensitivity of the assays, we ran antigen tests immediately upon collecting the sample

2

and without the optional step of inserting the swab into the viral transport medium that may

3

lead in undesirable antigen dilution.

4

The remaining nasopharyngeal swab along with the oropharyngeal swab were sampled in

5

accordance with the international specimen collection guidelines (CDC, (9)). They were both

6

inserted into the viral transport medium (10) and transported to the hospital microbiology

7

laboratory for the PCR analysis. RNA extraction was performed with Viral Nucleic Acid

8

Extraction kit (Zybio, China) on the EXM3000 instrument (Zybio, China). The extracts were

9

subjected to the reverse transcription PCR, targeting N, E and RdRP/S genes (Allplex SARS-

10

nCoV-2; Seegene, Republic of Korea), run on the CFX96 PCR cycler (Bio-Rad, USA). The

11

sample was deemed positive if at least one of the genes was detected with a threshold cycle

12

(Ct) value < 40; to define a single Ct for a respective sample, we used the lowest Ct out of

13

the three detected targets.

Results

2

The PCR positivity was detected in 223 cases (37.7%). Out of them, 168 people had one or

3

more COVID-19 related symptoms (57.9% of all individuals with symptoms and 75.3% of all

4

PCR positive cases), while 55 PCR positive subjects reported no symptoms at the time of

5

sampling. Ag test 1 and Ag test 2 were found positive in 148 and 141 cases, respectively

The likelihood of detecting the SARS-CoV-2 antigen in a PCR positive person increased with

results with Ct > 30 also comprised mostly the symptomatic patients (38 of 62 cases).

Sensitivity of Ag tests was found greater than 80% only for samples with Ct < 30; a

Discussion

2

With the surge of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave in autumn 2020, novel testing strategies

3

to tackle the community transmission are being sought, including the option of population-

4

wide screening with the aid of antigen tests (4). In our study, we mimicked a situation of

5

mass screening in that we tested each individual, attending the hospital COVID-19 collection

6

site, regardless of the presence or absence of clinical symptoms. Within 4 days, we enrolled

7

nearly 600 individuals out of 800 eligible people who were 10 years or older. Our PCR

8

positivity rate was almost 38% which was well in accordance with over 30% observed on a

9

national level at the time of the study performance (daily reports on (11)).

10

In our study, we worked with two different antigen tests out of which one enabled europium

11

fluorescence-based detection (Ag test 2), the detection that was believed to improve

12

sensitivity. However, this mode of result visualisation did not have any impact on the change

13

of sensitivity. Overall mean sensitivity values were 66.7% for Ag test 1 and 62.6% for Ag test

14

2. If the parameter of the presence of clinical symptoms is a criterion for performing the test,

15

sensitivity increased only modestly to 73.8% for Ag test 1 and 68.5% for Ag test 2, while it

16

dropped below 50% if asymptomatic, but PCR positive persons are tested.

17

Our findings fit well with the known sensitivity characteristics of antigen tests for other

18

respiratory viruses like influenza or respiratory syncytial virus where rapid

19

immunochromatography tests reach the sensitivity of 54.4% and 80%, respectively (12, 13).

20

Such discrepancies between sensitivity values reported in research articles and

21

manufacturers' leaflets come from differences in selection of tested samples. For instance, a

22

clinical evaluation of the Ag test 2 with the claimed sensitivity of 100% was performed on a

23

positive spiked material, not on real subjects. Interim data on Ag test 1 showed the sensitivity

24

of 85.5% (95% CI 78.2, 90.6), based on testing of 535 patients with suspicion of COVID-19

25

(14). Of them, 77% were checked by the antigen test within three days from the onset of the

26

symptoms, and 75% had their Ct < 25.

1

Similarly to Scohy et al. (8), we found out that the main attribute affecting the antigen test

2

sensitivity is a viral load as estimated by the Ct. Lower viral load, represented in our study by

3

high Ct values above 30, became hardly detectable by any of the two antigen tests used.

4

Thus, patients with samples of late Ct values would be largely left undiagnosed, although

5

many of them also presented with clinical symptoms in our study. Regardless of their clinical

6

state, it is important to point out that they all might be also infectious as documented in

7

studies on asymptomatic and presymptomatic persons (15, 16).

8

Because of the recent findings on infectivity (17), we can speculate that patients with low Ct

9

were actually at the end of their infection stage and no longer posed the risk to others.

10

However, our patient records show that only 5 of 62 patients with Ct > 30 visited the

11

collection site to monitor the course of their infection (3 of them had still clinical symptoms),

12

so we can assume that most of them were near the onset of the disease and cannot rule out

13

their infectivity. In reference to the aim of our study, i.e. to check the effectiveness of the

14

mass testing with antigen tests, another limitation of the study is the bias in selection of the

15

subjects who were in most cases indicated for the examination due to symptoms or contact

16

tracing. One can expect that the population-wide screening would include higher rate of

17

asymptomatic people with low viral loads as well as healthy persons which in turn would lead

18

in even higher false negativity and false positivity rates (18).

19

To conclude, in our opinion, the risk and rate of false negativity of antigen tests may have a

20

significant negative impact on the effectiveness of outbreaks containment as it is crucial to

21

early identify any positive person, including the ones with initially low viral load. Not to miss

22

them, a single round of testing, which is likely the case when a population-wide screening is

23

ordered, seems insufficient and inadequate. Instead, the strategy based on repeated testing

24

with high enough frequency (2) needs to be implemented if the antigen test is used as a

25

frontline screening tool.
