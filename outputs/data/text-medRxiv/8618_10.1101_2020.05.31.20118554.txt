Abstract
Serological assays can detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, but their sensitivity often comes at
the expense of specificity. Here we developed a Tripartite Automated Blood Immunoassay
60

(TRABI) to assess the IgG response against SARS-CoV-2. Calibration was performed with 90
prepandemic and 55 virologically and clinically confirmed COVID-19 samples. Posterior probabilities were calculated from 3x8 measurements of logarithmically diluted samples against the ectodomain and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein. We
then performed 948’528 assays on 5’503 prepandemic and 34’019 copandemic samples from

65

hospital patients and healthy blood donors. The seroprevalence increased in March 2020 (0.3%;
CI95%: 0.1% - 0.5%) among hospital patients but plateaued in April at 1.1-1.3%, and dropped to
0.3-0.7% in July. A dynamic transmission model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and seroconversion in the general population of the Canton of Zurich yielded an infection fatality ratio of
0.6% (CI95%: 0.4%-0.8%), similarly to other European areas. While the evolution of seropreva-

70

lence points to a high effectiveness of containment measures, our data highlight that antibody
waning warrants a continuous seromonitoring to reliably estimate the prevalence in a population.

Introduction
Within just a few months of the onset of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) pandemic, several million cases and hundreds of thousands of fatalities from coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been registered. It has also indirectly caused many more deaths
by hijacking healthcare resources, thereby making them unavailable to patients suffering from

80

other diseases. In addition, COVID-19 has created profound economic distress for most travelrelated industries. Finally, it has disrupted a plethora of industrial supply chains, resulting in a
massive worldwide unemployment crisis that will cost many more human lives.
In order to alleviate the direct consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, governments and
public healthcare agencies need granular and reliable data on the prevalence of infection, the

85

incidence of new infections, and the spatial-temporal oscillations of these parameters within regions of interest. The acquisition of such data, however, is daunting and data are prone to misinterpretation (1). Firstly, data needs to be acquired extremely rapidly. Secondly, their usefulness
is dependent on being representative of large populations, meaning that they need to be acquired
in massive numbers. Finally, the tolerance of false-positives and false-negatives must be ex-

90

tremely low in order to ensure an accurate estimation of the prevalence; the estimation is particularly challenging in low-prevalence areas.
Intuitively, PCR-based diagnostics would seem suitable to fulfill the above criteria. However, practical experience has shown that this is not the case. The acquisition of representative diagnostic
material for PCR has proven challenging, with deep nasal swabs being difficult to perform, un-

95

comfortable for patients and potentially hazardous for medical personnel. Accordingly, the sensitivity of PCR diagnostics is often disappointing, with reported false-negative rates of 25% even
under the best conditions (2).
Serological assays, on the other hand, address the adaptive immune responses of the host which
are fundamental to limiting viral spread within individuals and populations. While they lag behind

100

the viral infection, they can serve as both powerful epidemiological tools as well as useful clinical
aids. Firstly, antibodies can be easily retrieved from many biological fluids, notably including venous and capillary blood. Secondly, antibodies typically persist for several months whereas the
viral load in the upper respiratory tract frequently wanes within weeks (3). Importantly, immunological assays can be largely automated, and are thus suitable to mass screening of extremely

105

large cohorts.

Representative testing of entire populations mandates fully automatable assays capable of outputting reliable results at extremely high rates and very low cost. Here we describe an assay that
fulfills these criteria. We have screened 39'522 samples for antibodies against three SARS-CoV110

2-related antigens: the ectodomain of the spike protein (S), its receptor-binding domain (RBD)
and the nucleocapsid protein (NC), using SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA)
(4-6). Samples included patients entering the University Hospital of Zurich (USZ), Switzerland,
from December 2019 to the present (defined as “copandemic”; n=24’830), a cohort of patients
treated at USZ between 2016 and 2018 (“prepandemic”; n=4’407), as well as 1’096 prepandemic

115

and 9’102 copandemic samples from blood donors in Zurich. Our test cohorts were completed by
virologically and/or clinically confirmed cases with SARS-CoV-2 infections (31 annotated USZ
samples and 56 additionally recruited samples for blood donation service). Our results paint a
detailed picture of the spread of the pandemic within the greater Zurich area from February to
July 2020, and may be representative of other metropolitan areas that have been weakly affected

120

by SARS-CoV-2 despite a highly mobile population served by large international airports.

Results
TRABI: a miniaturized high-throughput ELISA for multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens.
The goal of this project was to assess the rate of seroconversion throughout the course of the
125

pandemic in tens of thousands of individuals who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. This
requires high specificity of the assay procedure in order to avoid false-positive results, while not
compromising its sensitivity and risking to underestimate the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Equally crucial is the ability to maintain a throughput of >4’000 samples/24h, and to
minimize the costs of reagents and labor. We achieved these goals (1) by testing for multiple viral

130

antigens, (2) by employing extensive automation including contactless fluid-handling, (3) by reducing the sample volumes to the nanoliter scale, and (4) by combining multiple antigen measurements via statistical techniques. The TRABI assay described below utilizes contactless acoustic dispensing (7, 8) to transfer droplets (2.5 nl each) of plasma into high-density 1536-well plates
(total volume: 3 µl) and measures the IgG response against viral proteins in an immunosorbent

135

format (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A for detailed procedure).
In order to identify the most suitable viral targets for TRABI, we infected Vero cells with wild-type
SARS-CoV-2 virus. Cell lysates were then subjected to Western blotting using the plasma of patients with confirmed COVID-19 (n=7). The bands corresponding to the S and NC proteins were
prominently visible in infected cells, but were undetectable in non-infected cells and were sup-

140

pressed by adding soluble S and NC antigen to the patient plasma before incubation with the
Western blot (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, we selected the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (9), the receptor
binding domain (RBD, amino acids 330-532 of the S protein), and the nucleocapsid protein (NC,
amino acids 1-419) as target antigens for TRABI. Each sample was tested at eight consecutive
two-fold dilution points (1:50 to 1:6400), and the resulting data were fitted to a sigmoidal curve by

145

logistic regression. The inflection point (or –log10(EC50)) of each sigmoid was defined as the respective antibody titer.
As reference samples for assay establishment, we utilized a collective of 55 venous plasma samples drawn at various days post onset of symptoms (dpo) from 27 RT-qPCR confirmed patients
suffering from COVID-19 and hospitalized at the University Hospital of Zurich (USZ, true posi-

150

tives), as well as 90 anonymized USZ samples from the prepandemic era (true negatives) (see
Table S1). We then constructed receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) curves to assess the
assay quality for each antigen individually. Finally, we created a composite metric that integrates
S/RBD/NC measurements using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). While each single antigen showed excellent discrimination of negatives and positives on samples drawn at ≥14 dpo, the

155

compound models outperformed the individual antigen measurements at 7-13 dpo, where the
emergence of an IgG response is expected to be variable (Fig. 1C, upper panel). We therefore
used the QDA modeling assumptions to infer the prevalence in large cohorts based on the distributional information of true negatives and true positives (details in Methods) using information
gained from all three antigens.

160

To benchmark TRABI, we compared the results with a high-throughput assay under development
at the University of Oxford as well as assays commercialized by Roche (Elecsys), DiaSorin, EuroImmun, and Abbott (Fig. 1C, lower panel). This comparative assessment was based on 136 of
146 samples (10 samples were removed from the analysis because of insufficient sample volume
to perform all tests). While all assays displayed 100% specificity/sensitivity at late time points,

165

TRABI scored best at early time points, also when additionally compared to a lateral-flow assay
(Fig. S2A). When these results were plotted as a function of dpo, a temporal pattern emerged
consistent with the gradual emergence of IgG antibodies within 14 dpo (Fig. 1D).
Temporal evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the greater area of Zurich
Due to supply-chain bottlenecks, but also because of the intrinsically narrow window of infectivity,

170

testing of individuals for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids has been limited to those at
elevated risk before and after the peak of the epidemic. During that time, individuals with mild
symptoms were asked to isolate at home, often without being tested for the presence of SARSCoV-2 RNA. Thus, the true number of people who underwent an infection with SARS-CoV-2 may
at best be a rough estimate modelled on data of numbers of hospitalizations and deaths (10). We

175

are therefore using TRABI to screen a large sample of Swiss urban populations. To date, we have
screened 39'522 samples from a University Hospital cohort of Zurich (USZ patient cohort) with
diverse diseases (Table S1) and from the blood donation service (BDS, see Table S1) of Zurich
(healthy group), starting from December 2019 (Fig. S3A, B).
To reliably measure the prevalence of seroconversion, we used known positives and negatives

180

as internal calibrators for each cohort. These condition-positives/negatives were screened simultaneously to all other samples using exactly the same procedures. Their annotation as condition
positives/negatives was performed post-hoc using USZ and BDS databases in the absence of
serological data. First, we identified all USZ samples with known positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR
results (n=175). Condition-positive samples (n=31) were defined as those with (1) clinically man-

185

ifest COVID-19 pneumonia and (2) positive RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 and (3) venipuncture occurring ≥ 14 days after the positive qPCR. To avail of condition-positives from the cohort of blood

donors, 56 samples from convalescent individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
recruited for a plasmapheresis study were included.
To determine potentially unspecific results, e.g. due to cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses,
190

we screened 5’503 prepandemic samples (condition-negatives). For the BDS cohort, we enriched
the condition-negatives with 2‘100 samples from December 2019 and January 2020 to increase
the numbers of the assumed negatives and to obtain a more reliable baseline. We tested two
models: the first model assumes that both the condition-positive and negative data follow distinct
multivariate Gaussian distribution with unequal covariances (QDA) (Fig. 2A, B), whereas the sec-

195

ond model is based on Gaussian distributions with equal covariances (LDA) (Fig. S3C, D). LDA
was additionally performed because it allows to verify the distributional assumptions more readily
(Fig. S3E, F). Using the distributions of the condition negatives and the condition positives, we
computed the posterior probability (i.e. the probability of an individual to be seropositive as modeled via the distribution of the known condition-negatives and known condition-positives) for all

200

data points (see Fig. S3A, B). The respective ROC curves were then plotted (Fig. S3H, I). At
100% specificity, we identified 27/31 of the annotated true positives for the USZ (Fig. S3G) and
37/56 annotated true positives for the BDS cohort (Fig. S3H). For the BDS cohort, the sensitivity
increased rapidly with a slight decrease in specificity (at a false-positive-rate of 0.001, we identified 52/56 condition positives). We then applied this model to estimate the prevalence in the pop-

205

ulation. No substantial shift above baseline was inferred for samples screened from January and
February (Fig. 2C and Fig. S3I, USZ cohort). A sudden increase in prevalence manifests in March
(QDA: 0.3% (95% confidence intervals: 0.1%-0.5%) and LDA: 0.3% (CI95%: 0.1%-0.5%)) and
peaks in April 2020 (QDA: 1.4% (CI95%: 1.0%-1.7%) and LDA: 1.3% (CI95%: 1.0%-1.7%)), in accordance with the virologically and clinically reported rise in SARS-CoV-2 infections in these

210

months. After that, the estimated prevalence started to decline (average value May to beginning
of July 0.9% and 0.8% of QDA and LDA, respectively) with variations on a low level. The BDS
collective showed a comparable but slightly delayed time course of seroconversion, with the prevalence approximating 1.2% in April (QDA: 1.2% (CI95%: 0.7%-1.8%) and LDA: 1.1% (CI95%: 0.6%1.7%) and 1.6% in May (QDA: 1.6% (CI95%: 1.0%-2.3%) and LDA: 1.6% (CI95%: 1.0%-2.2%)) (Fig.

215

2C and Fig. S3I). After a minimal decrease in June, it drops to 0.7% in early July ((CI95%: 0.3%1.2%) and LDA: 0.7% (CI95%: 0.27%-1.2%)).
In order to address the epidemiological implications of these findings, we employed a dynamic
transmission model that describes infection, hospitalization, recovery, death and seroconversion

due to SARS-CoV-2 in the Canton of Zurich (1.5 million). Assuming the BDS samples are repre220

sentative of the general population in the Canton of Zurich, the model accurately describes the
rapid rise in seroprevalence during the second half of March and the month of April (Fig. 2D and
Fig. S4). Using a maximum likelihood framework, we estimated a seroprevalence of 1.6% (95%
prediction interval, PI95%: 1.0%-2.2%) by the end of May, and an infection fatality ratio (IFR) of
0.6% (CI95%: 0.4%-0.8%) for the general population in the Canton of Zurich.

225

To challenge the technical reproducibility of TRABI, we selected 210 high-score samples and 122
random samples from known seronegatives and repeated the assays. The screens proved to be
highly replicable when comparing the duplicates from the same screen (S: R2 = 0.85 among samples where both could be adequately fitted, see Fig. 2E) and the values from the follow-up screen
with the values initially derived from serology (for example, 87% among re-screened samples with

230

a -logEC50 for S above 2.5 had a -logEC50 value above 2 in the second screen, see Fig. S5).
Antibodies against the RBD of SARS-CoV can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (11). We therefore
tested whether samples with high anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD titers display cross-reactivity with
SARS-CoV RBD. For visualization, we binned samples into groups of absent, moderate and high
SARS-CoV-2 RBD titers (–log[EC50] <1.5, 1.5-2, and > 2.5, respectively) and computed their re-

235

spective QDA-derived posterior probability. For individuals with SARS-CoV-2 RBD titers < 2, a
small fraction showed binding to SARS-CoV RBD at –log(EC50) > 2 (Fig. 2F). However, those
with strong binding properties to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (> 2.5) clustered at high values for SARSCoV RBD, indicating that some anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies were cross-reactive to SARSCoV RBD.

240

In summary, TRABI identified first cases of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in April 2020, consistent
with first infections reported in the Zurich area towards the end of February 2020. While data
obtained from healthy individuals suggest that around 1.5% of blood donors have been infected
despite the absence of anamnestic COVID-19, the serological prevalence was about 5-fold higher
than that of RT-qPCR confirmed cases for the same time point. We conclude that at the time of

245

writing, seroconversion within the greater area of Zurich is still exceedingly rare and very far from
herd immunity.
Clinical and demographic characteristics of serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected hospital
patients and healthy donors.
Approximately 22% of the USZ samples stem from repeat venipunctures of patients. For the pur-

able, the one with the highest posterior probability was used). Seropositivity was defined as having a posterior probability > 0.5. USZ cohort had a median age of 55 years (40 – 68) lower and
upper quartile respectively) with a median for seropositives of 56 years (42 - 65) (Fig. 3A and
Table S1). BDS cohort for April to July had a median age of 43 years (29 - 54), and seropositives
255

had a median age of 32 (26 - 46) (Fig. 3B and Table S1). The majority (88%) of patients in the
USZ cohort stemmed from the Canton of Zurich (including the city of Zurich), with smaller contributions by Cantons Aargau, Schwyz, St. Gallen, and Thurgau (Fig. 3C). Inhabitants of the city of
Zurich constituted a comparatively larger proportion of SARS-CoV-2 seropositives than the rest
of the Canton of Zurich.

260

The blood of USZ patients was drawn in 39 clinical departments (Fig. 3D), 24 of which treated
patients with a posterior probability > 0.5. In absolute counts, most SARS-CoV-2-positive samples
were obtained from the Infectious Disease and Hospital Hygiene ward, followed by the departments of Internal Medicine, Medical Oncology and Hematology, and Cardiology. The wide range
of medical departments suggests that SARS-CoV-2 seropositive patients do not solely enter the

265

hospital for the treatment of COVID-19 but for any condition that requires the attention of a USZ
physician. Seropositivity can be found across all age groups and in both genders (Fig. 3A, B,
Table S1) and stays relatively stable for a longer time up (up to 100 days) (Fig. 3E), at least in
hospital patients with known SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR status. Long-term monitoring of SARSCoV-2 seropositive individuals will be important to identify comorbidities potentially associated

270

with SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in prepandemic samples.
5’503 prepandemic plasma samples (4’407 USZ hospital patients and 1’096 healthy BDS donors)
were examined for the presence of cross-reactive antibodies against S, RBD and NC of SARSCoV-2. Several individuals had a strong antibody response against a single antigen and an ab-

275

sence of binding to other antigens, reflected in a low posterior probability but high -log(EC50)
value (Fig. S3A, B). We then directly compared prepandemic and copandemic samples in the
USZ cohort on the basis of single antigens and their respective posterior probabilities. When focusing on samples with high values for single assays, we observed an enrichment of high posterior probabilities in pandemic but not in the prepandemic group (Fig. 4A). Among samples with

280

individual –log(EC50) values above 2 in May and June 2020, 76% (S), 80% (RBD), and 24% (NC)
had a posterior probability > 0.5. In the prepandemic samples, maximally 1 sample with an individual assay level above 2 had a posterior probability above 0.5. This enrichment is suggestive
of a substantial performance improvement when using the combined metric in the USZ cohort.

We then compared the immunochemical properties of six prepandemic samples with high binding
285

to S, RBD or NC to two samples of confirmed COVID-19 (COVID 1 and 2, see annotation in Fig.
4A). The COVID-19 samples, but not the prepandemic samples, recognized in Western blots the
S and NC antigens of SARS-CoV-2 expressed by Expi293F (Fig. 4B and Fig. S6A). Additional
ELISAs performed on the same samples confirmed the initial findings (Fig 4C and Fig. S6B)
including intact binding to the RBD. The discrepancy between ELISA and Western Blot suggests

290

that the RBD is a highly conformational epitope lost upon boiling and SDS denaturation.
To further probe the specificity of the findings, we also carried out competitive ELISAs on prepandemic and COVID patients. First, we determined plasma concentrations close to the EC50.
Then we pre-incubated appropriately diluted samples with various concentrations of S and RBD
(0.04-88 and 0.7-1350 nM, respectively). Samples were then transferred onto ELISA plates

coated with S, RBD, and NC. The concentration-dependent displacement of the measured optical
density was then visualized (Fig. 4D and Fig. S6C). We found that both soluble S and the RBD
caused a concentration-dependent depletion of the RBD in COVID samples. The S signal could
not be depleted with RBD, indicating the presence of epitopes other than the RBD. One prepandemic sample (#1, see Fig. S6C) displayed competition of the S signal with soluble S but not

300

with soluble RBD. Other prepandemic samples did not show competition at all, suggesting that
their reactivity was due to high concentrations of low-affinity antibodies cross-reacting with SARSCoV-2 S.
Identification of seropositives in healthy donors and clonality of anti-S immune response.
TRABI enabled the identification of 57 blood donors that underwent regular blood donation at the

305

blood donation service of Zurich (Fig. 2B, C) despite clear serological indications of past infection
and antibody titers in the same range as those of PCR-confirmed convalescent individuals (Fig.
5A). We assessed IgG and IgA antibodies to S, RBD, and NC as well as responses to multiple
control antigens, in 4 healthy blood donors and 4 convalescent individuals recruited to the BDS.
We observed binding of IgG antibodies in blood donors and convalescent individuals against S,

310

RBD, and NC, with usually lower IgA titers. No binding against the SARS-CoV-2 non-structuralprotein 1 (NSP1), or against bovine serum albumin (BSA) was observed.
To further validate the seropositivity in healthy blood donors, we employed an orthogonal methodology which allows antibody/antigen interactions to be probed in solution, without any immobilization of antigens to a surface. Samples of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals, healthy do-

solution upon complex formation with an antibody present in the patient sample. This was
achieved by measuring the associated decrease in its molecular diffusion coefficient upon binding
using a microfluidic platform. While no change in diffusion coefficient or the associated hydrody320

namic radius was observed in control samples, all ELISA-positive samples from convalescent and
healthy donors indicated a clear binding of antibodies to RBD (Fig. 5B). We confirmed these
findings by using the samples of several healthy blood donors and convalescent individuals as
primary antibodies in Western Blot and detected bands for both S and the NC in the Expi293 cells
overexpressing the viral proteins but not in the Expi293 control lysate (Fig. 5C).

325

To obtain a rough estimate of the clonality and epitope specificity of the immune response raised
against the S protein, we conducted an ELISA-based soluble antigen competition. Competition
with the RBD lead to a decrease in ELISA signal for RBD but not for S or NC in both convalescent
individuals and healthy blood donors (Fig. 5D and Fig. S7). Conversely, competition with S decreased the signal for both S and the RBD (Fig. 5D), suggesting the presence of antibodies tar-

330

geting multiple S epitopes, including RBD. Therefore, the immune response against S was polyclonal and involved multiple viral epitopes.

Discussion
The high-throughput pipeline for SARS-CoV-2 serology described above has enabled us to study
335

a cohort of nearly 40’000 samples from the greater area of Zurich over the time span of the pandemic. In view of the critique levelled at past serological studies (1, 12), we have gone to great
lengths to assess and validate our technology. For the initial assay calibration, sensitivity was
measured using a panel of clinically and RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 sera (n=55) at various
time points after onset of clinical signs and symptoms and 90 negative controls. A blinded com-

340

parison with commercial test kits showed that our approach, which combines three individual assays into one single score, was suitable for large-scale epidemiologic studies.
A key question of relevance to public health is the proportion of the population that has already
contracted the virus. As a proxy for the estimation of the underlying infection attack rate in the
greater area of Zurich, we have used two independent cohorts: (1) unselected patients coming

345

from all clinical departments of USZ and (2) healthy individuals donating blood to local blood
banks (BDS). The availability of known positives and negatives in both cohorts allowed us to
model the posterior probability from the multiple available antigen measurements, using the respective distributions of these intrinsic controls. Combining the metrics did indeed lead to a power
gain, as shown by the enrichment of samples with high posterior probabilities in excess of the

350

single assays during the epidemic. As a possible drawback, the direct modeling of the multivariate
distribution of antigen measurements may hinder the detection of deviations from the modeling
assumptions. We explored the robustness to modeling assumptions by employing a mixed univariate Gaussian distribution and saw generally good agreement for prevalence estimations. The
extent of our sampling bolsters our confidence in the representativity and validity of our results.

355

In both cohorts, the prevalence of seropositives climbed over the baseline in late March 2020 and
peaked at 1.6% in April, with indications for a slight decrease in prevalence. But are our cohorts
representative for the population of the greater area of Zurich? On the one hand, the USZ cohort
consists mostly of individuals suffering from disparate diseases, some of which may be a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. On the other hand, individuals with acute infections are typi-

360

cally excluded from donating blood. As a consequence, the BDS cohort may be biased against
individuals who may have experienced COVID-19 symptoms and refrained from donating. Yet,
despite these fundamental differences in their composition, seroprevalence estimates from both
cohorts are in good agreement. This observation underscores the presumption that the prevalence reported here is truly representative of the population under study. Clearly, our study would

365

benefit from the inclusion of cohorts with different age architectures, such as e.g. school children

or individuals staying in retirement homes. While such cohorts have not been introduced in this
study, the workflow established here could easily be adapted to the investigation of more focal
populations.
The low prevalence and the early plateau of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in the greater area of
370

Zurich is in stark contrast to harder hit metropolitan areas in Switzerland (Geneva) or Spain (Madrid) that have reached a seroprevalence above 10% (13, 14). The low prevalence between 1%
and 2% might be somewhat surprising when considering that Switzerland borders Northern Italy
whose prevalence of infection was reported to reach 43% in healthcare workers (15), and no
travel restrictions were imposed between the more severely affected areas of Switzerland (Ticino

375

and the Romandie) and Northern Switzerland (16). This illustrates that the implementation of
strong non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) around mid-March (‘lockdown’) successfully prevented further spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland (10).
When set in relation to the regional numbers of RT-qPCR-positive cases, our cohort-based estimates of the seroprevalence (1.6% (CI95%: 1.0%-2.2% in May 2020 for BDS) are in line with those

380

of more affected regions of Switzerland such as Geneva (seroprevalence: 10.8% (CI95% 8.2–
13.9%) beginning of May 2020 (13)) and are about 5-10 times higher than the respective incidence of overt COVID-19 (10, 16). Likewise, the estimated IFR is in excellent agreement to what
was found in the Canton of Geneva, and for Switzerland overall (17, 18). All these estimates
reflect a best-case scenario where hospital capacities have never been exceeded and quality of

385

care for critically ill patients could always be ensured.
If the seropositive status is long-lasting, the evolution of anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence should
reflect the cumulative incidence of new infections with a delay of ≤13 DPO. The data presented
here are in agreement with hospital surveys suggesting that few transmission events took place
in Zurich between April (approx. 2 weeks after the enactment of ‘lockdown’ measures) and July.

390

The early peak and subsequent decline of seroprevalence in June-July indicates rapid waning of
antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This decline was robust, occurred in both the
USZ and BDS cohorts, and is congruent with observations by others (19-21). Assuming that a
negligible number of infections occurred in June-July, the population-wide half-life of the TRABI
titer is no longer than 2 months, although individual antibody responses may be a function of

395

disease severity (19). If however a significant number of transmissions took place, waning would
be considerably more rapid.

This has far-reaching implications for epidemiological assessments. For example, the immunity
profile of a population several months after the peak of infections might underestimate the underlying infection attack rate, thereby skewing inferences on the IFR. Consequently, serosurveys
400

repeated over short time windows and extended over multiple months will be necessary to acquire
a realistic picture of the immunity status of a population.
A recent publication (22) has shown pre-existing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in unexposed humans. Our affinity determinations and immunoblots, however, point to fundamental differences
between prepandemic seropositivity and the immune responses of SARS-CoV-2-infected individ-

405

uals. While the latter consistently showed high-affinity responses that were clearly visible in Western blotting, the few seropositive prepandemic sera were unanimously negative in Western blotting, and equilibrium displacement ELISA of one prepandemic plasma sample suggested a much
lower affinity despite similar antibody EC50 titers. We conclude that any immune response in uninfected individuals, whether it represents cross-reactivity with common-cold coronaviruses or

410

something else, is of inferior quality and may less likely be protective.
It has been proposed that asymptomatic individuals entail a different, weaker immune response
to SARS-CoV-2 (23). While follow-up studies including affinity determinations, epitope mapping,
and in-depth analyses of the B-cell and T-cell receptor repertoires (described in (24-26)) will paint
a more detailed picture, our data suggests that asymptomatic individuals – identified in the col-

415

lective of healthy blood donors – entail an antibody response comparable to the one seen in
individuals with clinical signs of SARS-CoV-2.
Our population-wide screen allows us to address several crucial questions that have been controversially discussed. What is the frequency of truly asymptomatic cases? What is the complete
spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms with which SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals present?

420

Many SARS-CoV-2 patients present with monosymptomatic anosmia caused by olfactory neuritis
(27), and it is conceivable that other illnesses may represent hitherto unrecognized signs of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Stratifying the results of our screens by clinical parameters (including international classification of diseases (ICD) codes as well as hematological clinical-chemistry values) will become increasingly important in the years to come, e.g. to protect those at risk, to

425

evaluate immune defenses and their possible waning, and to plan vaccination campaigns.
Our study is conceived as a long-term exercise which, given appropriate funding, will be continued
for the next several years. In addition to allowing precise monitoring of the population, it will also
enable the determination of titer decays in seropositive individuals as a function of demographic
indicators and of comorbidities. However, there are societal concerns linked to antibody testing,

430

and scientists must not downplay them. Serology is a powerful medical and epidemiological instrument, but it can also be misused to stratify the workforce, to discriminate against the nonimmune, and even for far more nefarious deeds. Let's study immune responses, but let's not
create a dystopian society based on them.

Materials and Methods
435

Human specimens and data
All experiments and analyses involving samples from human donors were conducted with the
approval of the local ethics committee (KEK-ZH-Nr. 2015-0561, BASEC-Nr. 2018-01042, and
BASEC-Nr. 2020-01731), in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and the
Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation. Specimens

440

were denoted according to the following conventions: prepandemic samples: samples collected
before December 2019; COVID samples: samples from patients with clinically and/or virologically
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; copandemic samples: any samples collected in December
2019 or thereafter.
Sample acquisition and biobanking

445

Small volumes (< 100 µL) of heparin plasma samples were obtained from the Institute of Clinical
Chemistry at the University Hospital of Zurich as unique bio specimens, biobanked over recent
years in a high-throughput liquid biobank. We received a maximum of one sample per patient per
month. After one month, another sample from the same individual would be included if the patient
visits the hospital and if blood is sent to the Institute of Clinical Chemistry. EDTA plasma from

450

healthy donors was obtained from the Blutspendedienst (blood donation service) Kanton Zürich
and Kanton Luzern from donors who signed the consent that their samples can be used for conducting research.
High-throughput serological screening.
In order to test the samples for the presence of IgG antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2

455

antigens, high-binding 1536-well plates (Perkin Elmer, SpectraPlate 1536 HB) were coated with
1 µg/mL S or RBD or NC in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by 3 washes with PBS-T (using Biotek
El406) and by blocking with 5% milk in PBS-T (using Biotek MultifloFX peristaltic pumps) for 1.5
h. Three µL plasma, diluted in 57 µL sample buffer (1% milk in PBS-T), were dispensed at various
volumes (from 1200 nL down to 2.5 nL) into pre-coated 1536-well plates using contactless dis-

filled up to 3 uL total well volume using a Fritz Gyger AG Certus Flex dispenser. Thereby, dilution
curves ranging from plasma dilutions 1:50 to 1:6400 were generated (eight dilution points per
patient plasma sample). After the sample incubation for 2 h at RT, the wells were washed five

washes with PBS-T, the addition of TMB, an incubation of three minutes at RT, and the addition
of 0.5 M H2SO4 (both steps with Biotek MultifloFX syringe technology). The final well volume for
470

each step was 3 µL. The plates were centrifuged after all dispensing steps, except for the addition
of TMB. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured in a plate reader (Perkin Elmer, EnVision) and
the inflection points of the sigmoidal binding curves were determined using the custom designed
fitting algorithm described below.
Counter screening using commercial and custom-designed platforms

475

We used the following commercial tests for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 55
plasma samples of 27 patients who were diagnosed by RT-PCR to be infected by SARS-CoV-2
as well as 83-90 plasma samples which were collected before December 2019 and, hence, before
the start of the COVID-19 pandemics: The double-antigen sandwich electro-chemiluminescence
immunoassay from Roche diagnostics (Rotkreuz, Switzerland) was performed with the E801 of

480

the COBAS8000® system (Roche diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The test detects any antibody against the nucleocapsid antigen. The fully automated LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 chemiluminescence immunoassay from DiaSorin (Saluggia, Italy) detects IgG against the S1/S2 antigens.
The SARS-CoV-2 chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay from Abbott (Abbott Park, IL,
USA) detects IgG against the nucleocapsid antigen and was performed on an Architect™ ana-

485

lyser. Two ELISAs from EUROIMMUN (Lübeck, Germany) detect IgA or IgG against the S1 antigen and were performed by the use of a DSX™ Automated ELISA System (DYNEX Technologies
(Chantilly, VA, USA). The high-throughput serology assay in Oxford (under development) was
carried out in the Target Discovery Institute, University of Oxford. High-binding 384-well plates
(Perkin Elmer, SpectraPlate) were coated with 20 µL of 2.5 µg/mL S o/n at 4°C, followed by 3

490

washes with PBS-T and by blocking with 5% milk in PBS-T for 2 h. Blocking buffer was removed
and 20 µL of 1:25 sera diluted in sample buffer (1% milk in PBS-T) was dispensed into S-coated
wells then incubated for 2 h at RT. The wells were washed five times with wash buffer and the
presence of IgGs directed against S was detected using an HRP-linked anti-human IgG antibody

Data analysis.
Data fitting. Data fitting. Eight-dilution points equally spaced on a logarithmic scale are fitted with
an equation derived from a simple binding equilibrium. The inflection point (-log10EC50) is extracted
from the fit. Baseline and plateau values are fixed by the respective positive and negative controls

505

in a plate-wise fashion and the signal is fitted following these equations:
1

𝑐𝑐𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 = 1 − �𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎 𝑐𝑐 + 𝑘𝑘𝑑𝑑 + 1 − �(𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎 𝑐𝑐 + 𝑘𝑘𝑑𝑑 )2 + 2(𝑘𝑘𝑑𝑑 − 𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎 𝑐𝑐) + 1� ,

respectively.

Data preprocessing. All samples that yielded an –log10EC50 of below –3 on any antigen were
labelled as non-fittable and non-detectable. Their dilution curves cannot be differentiated from
baseline and therefore only an upper bound for the –log10EC50 can be determined. These samples
were therefore excluded from data fitting but were of course included in ROC analysis and prevalence estimation.

QDA, LDA, and Prevalence estimation. Assume that we have data for 𝑚𝑚 samples with known

serostatus and antibody measurements, that is, we have (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 , 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 ), 𝑖𝑖 = 1, . . , 𝑚𝑚, where 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 is the vector
of size 𝑝𝑝 (in our case our antigen measurements) and 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 is a Boolean variable defining group

membership (in our case, whether the individual is seropositive or not). The QDA model assumes

520

multivariate normal distributed 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 given 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 :
(𝑋𝑋|𝑌𝑌 = 𝑗𝑗)~𝒩𝒩𝑝𝑝 �𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 , Σ𝑗𝑗 �.
Further, the model assumes that the prior, that is, distribution of 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 , is known s. t. 𝑃𝑃[𝑌𝑌 = 𝑗𝑗] = 𝜋𝜋𝑗𝑗

The quadratic discriminant classifier simply assigns each sample to the group which has the larger
525

posterior 𝑃𝑃[𝑌𝑌|𝑋𝑋], which is proportional to the joint probability 𝑃𝑃[𝑌𝑌, 𝑋𝑋].
Therefore, we assign sample 𝑖𝑖 to group 1 if

log(𝑓𝑓𝑥𝑥|𝑦𝑦=1 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 )) + log(𝜋𝜋1 ) > log(𝑓𝑓𝑥𝑥|𝑦𝑦=0 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 )) + log(𝜋𝜋0 ),

530

And to group 0 otherwise. To set the prior, one option is to take just the mean of the group sizes.
However, this is not an ideal option in our case, where we have an additional 𝑛𝑛 samples with

unknown serostatus to classify: The prevalence in the 𝑚𝑚 samples with known serostatus might

deviate substantially from the prevalence in population with unknown serostatus. We therefore

535

estimate 𝜋𝜋1 directly from the data of unknown serostatus using a simple expectation maximization

scheme. Proceeding in an iterative fashion, from a given estimate 𝜋𝜋1𝑘𝑘 , we define the posterior (E

step):

𝑡𝑡1𝑘𝑘 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ) =

540

𝜋𝜋1𝑘𝑘 𝑓𝑓𝑥𝑥|𝑦𝑦=1 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 )

.
𝜋𝜋1𝑘𝑘 𝑓𝑓𝑥𝑥|𝑦𝑦=1 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ) + (1 − 𝜋𝜋1𝑘𝑘 )𝑓𝑓𝑥𝑥|𝑦𝑦=0 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 )

Then, we update our estimate of 𝜋𝜋1 (M step):
𝜋𝜋1𝑘𝑘+1 = �
𝑖𝑖

545

𝑡𝑡1𝑘𝑘 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 )
.
𝑛𝑛

After convergence, this yields our estimate of the positive serostatus prevalence in the samples.
Note that the sample ordering according to this classifier is independent of the prior and therefore
has no impact on an analysis via ROC curves. Further, note that evaluating QDA via ROC analysis, an out of sample scheme should be employed to avoid biased estimates of performance; we
chose 10-fold cross-validation throughout. Lastly, note that the strategy does not critically depend

550

on the normality assumption but just requires an estimate for the density functions, 𝑓𝑓𝑥𝑥|𝑦𝑦=𝑗𝑗 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ).
Even nonparametric estimates could be an option.

For the LDA approach, we first collapse the antigen measurements per samples according to the
linear discriminant classifier:
𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖 = 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑇𝑇 Σ0 (𝜇𝜇1 − 𝜇𝜇0 ),

555

Where Σ0 is the covariance estimated from the known negatives only and 𝜇𝜇1 , 𝜇𝜇0 are the means

of the known positives and negatives respectively. The above algorithm is then applied on the

Epidemiological modelling. We adapted a previously described deterministic, population-based
model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Switzerland (28). Using a maximum likelihood framework,
we fitted the model to aggregated daily numbers of hospitalized and ventilated patients, and
deaths in the Canton of Zurich from 27 February 2020 to 31 May 2020 (Fig. S3). Data were

565

provided by OpenZH, the specialist unit for open government data from the Canton of Zurich (29).
In contrast to the earlier description of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Switzerland overall, we assumed the daily numbers of hospitalized and ventilated patients in the Canton of Zurich to be
negative binomially distributed. We also included monthly seroprevalence data from BDS for
model inference assuming the positive samples are binomially distributed. We assumed the rate

570

of seroconversion after onset of symptoms to be 1/6 days, i.e., 90% of infected individuals will
have detectable antibodies by day 14 after onset of symptoms. All data and code files are available on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/calthaus/swiss-covid-epidemic.
High-throughput validation screen
For the validation screen, we picked 60 and 150 samples from BDS and USZ, respectively, that

575

had the high average values when summing -logEC50 for both Spike and RBD. Additionally, we
added 52 and 70 randomly selected prepandemic samples for the BDS and the USZ cohort respectively. We supplemented the three antigens used in the first screen (NC, S, RBD of SARSSARS-COV-2) with a SARS-CoV RBD antigen. Unlike for the primary screen, we ran all samples
in duplicates spread over two independent plates.

Yale, New Haven. Human codon optimized SARS-CoV (2003) RBD (pEZT containing H7 leader
sequence; aa. 306-527, C-terminal Avi- and 8His tags) was transiently transfected into Expi293TM
cells (Thermo Fisher) using the ExpiFectamineTM 293 Transfection kit (Gibco) according to the

605

manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were cultured in a 37˚C incubator with 8% humidified CO2 for 4
days after transfection. Culture supernatant was collected by centrifugation (500 x g for 10
minutes) and RBD was captured using Ni-NTA Superflow resin (Qiagen), washed, and eluted in
buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 350 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole. RBD was further
purified using an ENrichTM SEC 650 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 1X PBS (Thermo Fisher).

Peak fractions were pooled and the protein concentration was determined by 280 nm absorbance
with a NanodropTM One Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Protein was snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and shipped on dry ice prior to experiments.

RIPL and cells were grown in 2xYT medium at 30 °C. At an OD600 of 0.8, cultures were shifted
to 18 °C and induced with IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. After 16 h, cells were harvested
by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 500 mM KCl, 5 mM
MgCl2, 40 mM imidazole, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP and protease inhibitors) and lysed
using a cell disrupter (Constant Systems Ltd). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 45 min

620

at 48.000 xg and loaded onto a HisTrap FF 5-ml column (GE Healthcare). Eluted proteins were
incubated with TEV protease at 4 °C overnight and the His6-tag, uncleaved NSP1 and the His6tagged TEV protease were removed on the HisTrap FF 5-ml column. The sample was further
purified via size-exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex75 (GE Healthcare),

40 mM MgCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP). Fractions containing NSP1 were pooled, concentrated in an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter (10-kDa MW cut-off), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored until further use at -80 °C.
Details of viral proteins used for this study
For high-throughput serology, the following proteins were used: SARS-CoV-2 S (pHL-Sec; aa. 1-

630

1208, C-terminal 8His-Twin-Strep) and RBD (pOPINTTGNeo; aa. 330-532, C-terminal 6His) produced at the SGC in Oxford and the nucleocapsid protein from AcroBiosystems (AA Met 1 - Ala
419, C-terminal his-tag, NUN-C5227). For competitive ELISA, we used: The prefusion ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Lausanne, EPFL SV PTECH PTPSP), the RBD from Trenzyme (C-terminal his-tag, P2020-001) and the nucleocapsid protein from AcroBiosystems (AA

635

Met 1 - Ala 419, C-terminal his-tag, NUN-C5227). For additional ELISAs following the highthroughput serology, we used: The prefusion ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Lausanne, EPFL SV PTECH PTPSP), the RBD from Trenzyme (C-terminal his-tag, P2020-001) and,
nucleocapsid protein from AcroBiosystems (AA Met 1 - Ala 419, C-terminal his-tag, NUN-C5227),
the SARS-COV-2 NSP1 protein (from Nenad Ban, ETH Zurich), the CMV pp65 protein (Abcam,

640

ab43041), and BSA (Thermo Scientific).
Western Blotting
Expi293F cells were obtained as a gift from Prof. Maurizio Scaltriti (Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center, New York). Non transfected control cells and cells overexpressing either Histagged S, His-tagged NC or His-tagged RBD domain were lysed in 0,1% Triton X-100/PBS. Total

645

protein content in the cellular fraction was quantified using bicinchoninic protein assay (Pierce
BCA Protein Assay Kit, ThermoFisher). For Western Blotting, 30 µg of ECD-expressing lysate,
10 µg of NC-expressing lysate and 10 µg of RBD-expressing lysate were loaded all in the same
well of NU-PAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (ThermoFisher). 50 µg of non-transfected cell lysate were
loaded as negative control. Gels were run at a constant voltage (150 V) in MES running buffer for

650

50 minutes, then transferred onto PVDF membrane with a dry transfer system (iBlot 2 Gel Transfer Device, ThermoFisher). The membranes were blocked with 5% SureBlock (Lubio Science) for
1 hour at room temperature, and then incubated overnight with a 1:100 dilution of patients’ plasma
in 1% SureBlock, at 4 degrees. The day after, membranes were washed four times with PBS-T
and incubated for 1 hours with an anti-human secondary antibody, HRP-conjugated, diluted

655

1:10000 in 1% SureBlock. The membranes were then washed four times with PBS-T and acquired

using Immobilon Crescendo HRP Substrate (Merck Millipore) and Fusion SOLO S imaging system (Vilber). As a positive control, one membrane was incubated overnight with mouse anti-Histag
antibody (ThermoFisher, dilution 1:10000 in 1% SureBlock) and subsequently with anti-mouse
secondary antibody, HRP-conjugated (Jackson, dilution 1:10000 in 1% SureBlock).
660

Competitive ELISA
To perform competitive ELISAs, high-binding 384-well plates (Perkin Elmer, SpectraPlate 384
HB) were coated with 1 ug/mL S or RBD or NC in PBS at 37°C for 1 h, followed by 3 washes with
PBS-T and by blocking with 5% milk in PBS-T for 1.5 h. Meanwhile, plasma samples were diluted
to a final concentration close to the EC50, incubated with either RBD (50 ug/mL) or S (12.5 ug/mL)

665

and serially diluted (11 dilution points per patient sample, 25 uL per dilution) in a low-binding 384well plates (Perkin Elmer, high binding SpectraPlate). After 2 h of incubation at RT, 20 uL of all
the samples were transferred to the previously coated plates and incubated for additional 2 h at
RT. Then, the plates were washed five times with PBS-T and the presence of IgGs was detected
using an HRP-linked anti-human IgG antibody (Peroxidase AffiniPure Goat Anti-Human IgG, Fcγ

670

Fragment Specific, Jackson, 109-035-098, at 1:4000 dilution in sample buffer). The incubation of
the secondary antibody for one hour at RT was followed by three washes with PBS-T, the addition
of TMB, an incubation of 5 minutes at RT, and the addition of 0.5 M H2SO4. The absorbance at
450 nm was measured in a plate reader (Perkin Elmer, EnVision) and the inflection points of the
sigmoidal binding curves were determined using a custom designed fitting algorithm.

675

Microscale diffusional sizing
For the microfluidic binding measurements, 40% of human plasma was added to 10 nM antigen
and PBS was added to give a constant volume of 20 µL. The antigen used was RBD labelled with
Alexa Fluor 647 through N-terminal amine coupling. These samples were incubated at room temperature for 40 minutes and the size, hence molecular weight of the formed immunocomplex, was

680

determined through measuring the hydrodynamic radius, Rh with microfluidic diffusional sizing
(32) using a Fluidity One W platform (Fluidic Analytics, Cambridge, UK). Following correction of
fluorescence intensities for serum autofluorescence, the fraction, fd, of RBD to diffuse into the
distal channel is defined by:

𝑓𝑓𝑑𝑑 =

[𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴](1 − 𝜌𝜌𝑏𝑏 ) + ([𝑅𝑅]0 − [𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴](1 − 𝜌𝜌𝑓𝑓 ))

Fig. 1. Study overview and establishment of serological pipeline. A. To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in the population, prepandemic and copandemic samples
from two independent cohorts were analyzed by high-throughput microELISA (TRABI). IgG titers
against S, RBD and NC were determined and the –log(EC50) was inferred by regression analysis.
B. Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (lane 2), but not uninfected cells (lane 1), showed signals

840

corresponding to S (black arrow) and NC (blue arrow, pointing at two bands) when immunoblotted
with COVID-19 patient plasma. NC protein undergoes a proteolytic cleavage in SARS-CoV infected VeroE6 cells, resulting in two distinct bands of around 46 and 43 kDa. We confirmed the
identity of the two bands by probing with an anti-NC antibody (Sino Biologicals, data not shown).
Spiking of COVID-19 patient plasma with recombinant S and NC led to the disappearance of all

845

signals. C. Upper panel: Using 53 samples from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients and 83 prepandemic samples, we assessed the specificity-sensitivity relationship for all antigens individually
and after combining all results into a single score (TRABI) using QDA-based posterior probability.
Between 7 and 13 dpo, approximately 60% of samples were positive (posterior probability >0.5)

850

at 100% specificity cutoff, whereas 100% sensitivity was reached at ≥ 14 dpo. Lower panel:
COVID and prepandemic samples were used to assess the performance of TRABI, commercial

tests (Roche, DiaSorin, Abbott, Euroimmun) and an assay developed at the Target Discovery
Institute (Oxford). While all tests scored equally at ≥14 dpo, TRABI outperformed all other assays
at ≤13 dpo. D. Time course of IgG response in 55 samples from 27 COVID patients. IgG antibodies were reliably detectable at ≥13 dpo. Colors represent individual patients.

Fig. 4. Characterization of prepandemic samples. A. Posterior probability were calculated assuming a Gaussian distribution and visualized for individual antigens (S, RBD and NC) for prepandemic samples vs. copandemic USZ samples drawn in May and June 2020. Prepandemic
samples exhibited a low posterior probability as they typically reacted against single antigens,
leading to low rankings in a composite metric. For further testing, comparative samples were

885

chosen from the prepandemic era and from May and June 2020. Arrows point to samples of
individuals used in (B), (C), (D). P1-6: prepandemic 1-6; C1-2: COVID1-2. B. Western Blot analysis of two samples from May/June 2020 (“COVID 1” and “COVID 2”) and several prepandemic
samples (denoted with 2, 4 and 5). Anti-his-tag antibody was included as a positive control. Lane
1 = non-transfected Expi293F cell lysate; Lane 2 = Expi293F cell lysates expressing his-tagged

S, NC and RBD proteins. Black arrows: S; blue arrows: NC; purple arrow: RBD. C. ELISA assays
on the same samples as in B, using SARS-CoV-2 S, NC, RBD and NSP1 as well as control
proteins (BSA, CMV pp65). D. Soluble recombinant S or RBD were spiked into plasma at 0.0488 nM (S) and 0.7-1350 nM (RBD), in the same samples as in B and C, and ELISA was then
performed with immobilized RBD or S. Data points represent averages of duplicates. Soluble

895

antigens suppressed the ELISA signal in the COVID samples but not in the prepandemic sample,
showing that the antibodies present in the latter had lower affinities for SARS-CoV-2 targets.

binding between an Alexa 647-labelled RBD antigen and antibodies in solution. No change in
diffusion coefficient or the associated hydrodynamic radius was observed in control samples,
while all ELISA-positive samples from convalescent and healthy donors indicated a clear binding
of antibodies to RBD, confirming the ELISA-based results. C. Western Blot analysis of the same

for S and the RBD for the USZ (C) and the BDS (D) cohort. Posterior probability were calculated
using LDA. E. and. F. Q-Q plots to check the Gaussian distributional assumption of the LDA
model. For USZ (E) and the BDS (F) cohort respectively, we collapsed the 3 measures per sample
according to the linear discriminant classifier. We then scaled known positives and negatives to
mean zero and unit variance and compared their distributions to the univariate Gaussian distribu-

925

tion via Q-Q plot. We saw that for the relevant upper tail, the distribution of known negatives
followed the normal distribution with only a mild deviation, such that, for instance, the upper one
percent quantile is reached at 2.04 (E) and 2.00 (F) rather than at their theoretical value of 2.32.

the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was calculated in prepandemic samples and then
from December 2019 to July 2020.
