Keywords: Pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, B.1.1.7, transmission advantage

Abstract
Background. In December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of
Concern (VoC) which is now coined B.1.1.7. Based on the UK data and later additional data from
other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant [1, 2, 3].
Aim. The goal of this study is to estimate the transmission fitness advantage and the effective
reproductive number of B.1.1.7 through time for data from Switzerland.
Methods. We collected genomic surveillance data from 11.8% of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed
cases across Switzerland between 14.12.2020 and 11.03.2021. It allows us to determine the relative
proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis and to quantify the transmission advantage of the
B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale.
Results. We propose a transmission advantage of 43-52% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other
circulating variants. Further, we estimate a reproductive number for B.1.1.7 above 1 for Jan. 1, 2021
until now while the reproductive number for the other variants was below 1. In particular, for the
time period up to Jan. 17 we obtain a reproductive number of 1.24 [1.07-1.41] and from Jan. 18 until
March 1 we obtain 1.18 [1.06-1.30] based on the whole genome sequencing data. For March 10-16, we
obtain 1.14 [1.00-1.26] based on all confirmed cases among which B.1.1.7 is dominant at this stage.
Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021 and released measures on 01.03.2021.
Conclusion. In summary, the dynamics of increase in the frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected
based on the observations in the UK. B.1.1.7 increased in absolute numbers exponentially with the
point estimate for the doubling time being around 2-3.5 weeks. Our plots are available online and
are currently regularly updated with new data to closely monitor the spread of B.1.1.7.

Introduction

Reports of an increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 (501Y.V1) were released in
mid-December 2020 [4, 5, 6]. This variant carries the N501Y mutation in the spike protein which may
increase the ACE2 receptor affinity [7]. Within only a few months, the variant was able to become
the dominant lineage in the UK.
Since these first reports, great efforts were made in Switzerland to detect and trace B.1.1.7 [8].
The first cases of B.1.1.7 were confirmed on 24.12.2020 and retrospective analyses identified B.1.1.7
in samples dating back to October [8]. In total, 1370 infections with B.1.1.7 were confirmed up to
05.02.2021 [8].
An increase in prevalence does not necessarily imply a transmission fitness advantage of the virus.
For example, a variant termed 20A.EU1 spread rapidly during summer 2020 across Europe. However, data suggests that extended travel and superspreading events rather than a viral transmission
advantage caused that spread [9].
However, the variant B.1.1.7 rapidly increased in frequency in many high-prevalence regions across
the UK. Such re-occurring patterns are hard to explain without a transmission advantage. Analyses of
the B.1.1.7 variant in the UK suggest that the variant has a transmission fitness advantage anywhere
between 40 and 80% [1, 2, 3]. Davies et al. [3] further use data from Denmark obtaining again similar
estimates. Quantitative analysis of data on the spread of the 501Y mutation in Switzerland also
suggests a transmission advantage in roughly that range [10].
In this paper, we collected whole-genome sequencing data based on samples from Viollier AG
to determine the proportion of B.1.1.7 through time. Further, we used data from the diagnostic
laboratory Dr Risch which screens all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. Finally, all patients who
tested positive with CT values below 32 at the University Hospital Geneva (HUG) were sequenced
starting 23.12.2021 to provide a detailed view on the situation in the Lake Geneva region. We then
used this data to quantify the transmission fitness advantage of B.1.1.7 for Switzerland as well as for
the seven Swiss economic regions (Grossregionen). We further calculated the reproductive number
for B.1.1.7 and show how the B.1.1.7 case numbers developed through time.
The core plots presented here are currently updated regularly on [11] and part of it is currently
incorporated into the Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force website [12]. The code and data

Data

The main source of data is the whole-genome sequences based on samples from Viollier AG – a large
diagnostic lab processing SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Every week, SARS-CoV-2
samples were randomly selected for sequencing among all positively tested samples at the Viollier
AG. For each sample, we know the date of the test and the canton in which the test was performed.
The sequencing protocols and bioinformatics procedures are described in the supplementary materials
(section A.1).
In the time frame of interest – from 14.12.2020 to 11.03.2021, a total of 9772 sequences were
generated and checked for the B.1.1.7 variant. Thus, per week we produced around 780 sequences. In
the same time period, 184’165 people were confirmed with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus we provide
sequences for 5.3% of all cases. We define a sequence to be a B.1.1.7 sample if at least 80% of the
lineage-defining, non-synonymous nucleotide changes according to [4] are present.
Additionally, we have data from the Dr Risch medical laboratories. In our considered time period, Dr Risch screened 12019 samples for B.1.1.7. Details about the procedure are described in the
supplementary materials section A.2.
Taking both datasets together, 11.8% of all SARS-CoV-2 cases across Switzerland during our
considered time period (14.12.2020 to 11.03.2021) were screened for the B.1.1.7 variant. While Viollier
processes samples from all over Switzerland, the intensity varies across regions. The set of sequenced
samples inherits this uneven geographical distribution with the result that, relatively to the number
of all cases, over eight times more samples were sequenced from the region Nordwestschweiz than from
the region Ticino (Table S1). Dr Risch’s data has a different geographic distribution than Viollier
and, for example, much better coverage of Eastern Switzerland (Table S2). In summary, both datasets
differ in their geographic biases.
In order to obtain a detailed view on the Lage Geneva region, we additionally obtained a dataset
from the University Hospital Geneva (HUG). All patients who tested positive there were sent for
whole genome sequencing (section A.1). Between 23.12.2020 and 04.03.2021, HUG sequenced 2074

samples from Lake Geneva region which cover 7% of all cases in that timeframe.
In what follows, the analyzed data is the number of sequences per day and the number of identified
B.1.1.7 variants per day. We present results on the different datasets and compare these results.

2.2

Statistical inference

We fit a logistic model to the data to estimate the logistic growth rate a and the sigmoid’s midpoint
t0 . From that, we derive an estimate of the transmission fitness advantage under a continuous (fc )
and discrete (fd ) model which we consider as two extremes with the actual dynamics being described
by a process in between. Further, we estimate the reproductive number R for the B.1.1.7 and nonB.1.1.7 cases. The mathematical derivations are described in the supplemantary materials in the
sections A.3 and A.4.
We finally display the expected number of confirmed cases in the future under the continuous
model. We initialize the model on 01.01.2021 with the estimated number of B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7
cases on that day. We assume a reproductive number for the non-B.1.1.7 as estimated on the national
level for 01.01.2021-17.01.2021. Further, we assume that the expected generation time is 4.8 days and
the fitness advantage is the estimated fc for the region and dataset of interest (Table 1).

Results

We estimate the logistic growth rate a and the sigmoid’s midpoint t0 based on the Viollier and
Risch data (Table 1). Taking the estimates of both datasets together, we obtain a growth rate a of
0.07-0.09 per day for Switzerland. For each economic region, the estimated uncertainty interval of a
overlaps with the Swiss-wide uncertainty. We have little data for two out of seven regions (Ticino and
Central Switzerland; <1100 sequences in total) resulting in very wide uncertainty intervals. From the
t0 estimates, we observe that the Geneva region were about 2 weeks ahead of the rest of Switzerland
with respect to the spread of B.1.1.7, which confirms estimates from [10]. Our initial analyses of the
data in January projected that B.1.1.7 will become dominant in Switzerland in March 2021. Indeed,
our latest data points suggest a frequency of B.1.1.7 in confirmed cases of around 80% for March 11.
In Fig. 1 and 2, we graphically illustrate the logistic growth in frequency of B.1.1.7 and show the
daily data together with an estimate of the proportion of B.1.1.7 under the logistic growth model.

As a validation, we additionally analyzed HUG data. The estimates for the Lake Geneva region
based on Viollier data agree very well with independent estimates based on HUG data (Table 1 and
Figure S2).
Next, we estimate the reproductive number for B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 on a national scale (Fig. 3).
We note that measures were strengthened on January 18, 2021, and then relaxed on March 1, 2021.
During 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, the reproductive number for B.1.1.7 was significantly above 1 (Viollier:
1.24 [1.07-1.41], Risch: 1.46 [1.21-1.72]) while the reproductive number of non-B.1.1.7 was below 1
(Viollier: 0.83 [0.65-1.00] , Risch: 0.81 [0.67-0.96]).
Based on the Viollier data, the reproductive number for B.1.1.7 did not change drastically after
18.01.2021 (1.18 [1.06-1.30]) and agrees well with the Risch estimate (1.15 [1.01,1.29]). We note
though that the doubling time for a reproductive number of 1.24 is 15 days while it is 20 days
for a reproductive number of 1.18 which makes a substantial difference in the overall dynamics.
The reproductive number for non-B.1.1.7 did not change much either after 18.01.2021 (Viollier: 0.80
[0.68-0.91], Risch 0.85 [0.76,0.93]).
As expected, the ratio of the reproductive numbers for B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 for the Viollier
data stays roughly constant throughout January and February. For the Risch data, the ratio of the
reproductive numbers for B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 dropped in January. This is not expected under
our models. We suspect the reason is a bias in data (such as preferential inclusion of B.1.1.7 in early
January) as all estimates but the Risch estimate for B.1.1.7 in early January agree.
Our data does not allow us to estimate the variant-specific reproductive number for March yet.
However, for the time period March 10-16, we can estimate the reproductive number based on all
confirmed cases [14] (1.14 [1.00-1.26]). Since this estimate is based on confirmed cases from the
second part of March when we project around 90-95% of all confirmed cases being B.1.1.7 infections,
this estimate is only slightly underestimating the reproductive number of B.1.1.7. In summary, the
reproductive number for B.1.1.7 was above 1 since January while the reproductive number for the
other variants was below 1.
Next, we use the average reproductive number during 01.01.2021-17.01.2021 to calculate the transmission fitness advantage fc of B.1.1.7 under our continuous-time model. Further, we calculate the
transmission fitness advantage fd under a discrete-time model. In both cases, we assume a generation
time g of 4.8 days (which is the mean generation time assumed in the estimation of the reproductive

number). The fitness values are shown in Table 1. On a national level, we estimate a fitness advantage
of 43-52% across methods and datasets. The regional estimates have an overlap with this interval.
We note that we use the national reproductive number for the regional fc estimate. Since Ticino had
a lower and the Lake Geneva region a higher reproductive number averaged over all variants [14],
the fc for Ticino may be an underestimate, and the fc for Lake Geneva an overestimate.
Next, we show the expected dynamics of the epidemic under the continuous model using parameter values based on epidemic conditions in the first half of January (Fig. 4 and 5). We show the
development of confirmed case numbers based on this model in the blue (B.1.1.7) and green (nonB.1.1.7) areas. In particular, in January, the model projects a decline in overall case numbers due
to a decline in non-B.1.1.7 variants. However, the B.1.1.7 variant is increasing. Under this model,
once B.1.1.7 becomes dominant, the total number of cases will be increasing again. It is important to
note that this simple model is intended to highlight if dynamics changed compared to early January
2021, and thus it assumes that the transmission dynamics did not change since then. In particular,
the model does not include effects of tightening of measures on 18.01.2021, relaxing measures on
01.03.2021, vaccination, immunity after infection, and population heterogeneity.
We investigate if our empirical data follows this trend (lines in Fig. 5). Throughout January, the
model and the empirical data follow the same trends across datasets and regions with the exception of
Ticino and the Lage Geneva region (see supplementary materials, section A.5). Based on the Viollier
data, for the national level and the five regions with a good match in January, we observe that the
empirical total case numbers are below the model projections starting early February. This is in line
with a slight reduction of the reproductive number after 18.01.2021.
The Risch data follows the model very well until March. Thus, changing the model from the
Viollier parameters (R-value 0.83, fitness advantage 0.48) to the Risch parameters (R-value 0.81,
fitness advantage 0.45) leads to a very good fit until mid-March highlighting that in a phase of
overall exponential growth, slight changes of the parameters can have large consequences on the
total number of cases. In other words, a slight reduction of transmission in late January and / or a
slight misspecification of the Viollier parameters can explain the recent mismatch of the total number
of cases and the Viollier projections.

by the proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant for that day. If the empirical data develops as the model,
the dark blue line follows the upper end of the blue area and the dark green line follows the upper

Discussion

We have quantified the transmission fitness advantage and the effective reproductive number of
B.1.1.7 for two Swiss-wide datasets. One dataset also allows us to obtain estimates for the seven
Swiss economic regions. Swiss-wide estimates point towards a transmission fitness advantage of 4352%. Based on our early sequencing data, we already projected in January that B.1.1.7 will become
dominant in March. The same conclusion was reached by [10] in January based on Swiss data tracking
501Y mutations. On 11.03.2021 indeed around 80% of analyzed confirmed cases carry the B.1.1.7
variant. Since cases are confirmed 8-11 days after the time of infection in Switzerland, actually almost
all new infections may already be caused by B.1.1.7 as of today, March 26. Thus, the Swiss epidemic
is now a B.1.1.7 epidemic.
The increase in the frequency of B.1.1.7 in Switzerland occurred as expected given the large
transmission advantage. Unless measures such as contact tracing target in particular B.1.1.7, this
increase in relative frequency will occur given a transmission advantage. However, variables such as
implemented measures, the adherence to measures, or levels of immunity in the population determine
how fast the variants increase in absolute numbers.
We show that in the first half of January, the absolute numbers of B.1.1.7 increased (R-value 1.24
[1.07-1.41] for 01.01.2021-17.01.2021) based on our Swiss-wide sequence dataset from Viollier) while
the absolute numbers of all other cases decreased (R-value 0.83 [0.65-1.00] ). For the second half of
January, the reproductive number for B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 only decreased slightly according to
the Viollier data. The Risch estimates agree very well with this pattern with the exception of B.1.1.7
in early January where a higher reproductive number is estimated. We speculate that the large drop
in the reproductive number for B.1.1.7 based on the Risch data is due to a bias in the B.1.1.7 data,
possibly early data contained samples preferentially stemming from B.1.1.7 infections.
The reproductive number averaged over all confirmed cases in Switzerland (among which B.1.1.7
is projected to cause 90-95% of all infections) for March 10-16 is estimated to be 1.14 [1.00-1.26].
Taken together, this highlights that B.1.1.7 was spreading exponentially since early January with the
point estimate for the doubling time to be around 2-3.5 weeks.
When looking at the Viollier data, we observe that the total number of confirmed cases in February
is lower compared to our model scenario using parameter estimates from the first half of January.

This may reflect an overall small slow-down in transmission as also suggested in the reproductive
number. However, as observed from the reproductive number calculation, the slowdown was not large
and uncertainty intervals are wide. The Risch data agrees very well with the model. We suggest that
either a slight reduction of transmission in late January and / or a slight misspecification of the
Viollier parameters in the model can explain the recent mismatch of the total number of cases and
the Viollier projections (assumed parameters are: reproductive number of non-B.1.1.7 for Viollier is
0.83 and for Risch is 0.81; transmission advantage for Viollier is 0.48 and for Risch is 0.45.) This
highlights that the 11.5% of characterized confirmed cases in our dataset is not sufficient to quantify
the change in dynamics precisely enough to evaluate the effect of the strengthening of measures on
the reproductive number.
Our data reveal that different regions from Switzerland were sampled with different intensities.
Thus, we also performed analyses for the seven economic regions in Switzerland. Here, we expect that
the homogeneous sampling intensity is met better compared to the national level. We may observe
cases though which are imports from other economic regions compared to local transmission (the
same problem of course exists on a national level, though the smaller the scale, the more imports
we expect). However, the economic regions represent well-defined regions where we expect a lot of
mixing within and less mixing across regions. The estimates of the transmission fitness advantage
for the economic regions are largely in line with the national estimates, though of course with larger
uncertainty. Two of the regions (Ticino, Central Switzerland) have too little data to make precise
statements. Geneva is estimated to be around 2 weeks ahead in the B.1.1.7 dynamics compared to
Switzerland as a whole. One explanation may be the large number of UK travelers in ski resorts in
the Valais in December 2020.
Overall we see a consistent signal for a large transmission advantage of B.1.1.7 in Switzerland.
This confirms estimates from studies from the UK [1, 2, 3], Denmark [3], and Switzerland ([10];
looking at 501Y mutations). The strengthening of measures did not result in stopping the spread of
B.1.1.7. This resulted in overall exponentially growing case numbers once B.1.1.7 became dominant
in March. Our core plots are available on [11] and [12] for real-time monitoring. Further, we will add
new Variants of Concern to our webpage once they spread in Switzerland.

Sequencing Protocols for Viollier samples and HUG samples

We perform whole-genome sequencing of the Viollier samples in three facilities. The HUG samples are
processed in one of them, the Health 2030 Genome Center. The sequencing protocol for the samples
sequenced at the Genomics Facility Basel and the Functional Genomics Center Zurich is described
in [15]. Samples processed at the Health 2030 Genome Center used the Illumina COVIDSeq library
preparation reagents following the protocol provided by the supplier [16]. These reagents are based
on the ARTIC v3 multiplex PCR amplicon protocol [17]. When sufficient volume was available, 8.5ul
of RNA extracted from patient nasopharyngeal samples were used in the cDNA synthesis step; if

8.5ul were not available, the maximum volume possible was used. Pooled libraries were sequenced on
the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 using a 50-nucleotide pair-end run configuration. Post-sequencing library
read de-multiplexing was done using an in-house developed processing pipeline [18]. The downstream
bioinformatics procedure to obtain consensus sequences is described in [15, 19].

A.2

Screening procedure at Dr Risch

Dr Risch medical laboratories used the Taqpath assay from Thermofisher for their diagnostic and
recorded the S gene target failure (SGTF). SGTF samples are potential B.1.1.7 variants, as the
B.1.1.7 variant causes a SGTF due to its deletion at positions 69-70 in the spike protein. Further,
Dr Risch medical laboratories screen their samples for the 501Y mutation by a variant-specific PCR
test. If a sample is identified as a potential VoC by these procedures, it was initially sent for wholegenome sequencing to the University Hospital Basel in order to confirm the B.1.1.7 variant. The
sequencing protocol is described in [20]. For recent samples, the confirmation may still be outstanding
or not conducted due to B.1.1.7 now being dominant. However, since typically a SGTF plus a 501Y
mutation corresponds indeed to a B.1.1.7 variant, we consider these samples as B.1.1.7 variants even
when whole genome sequencing confirmation is lacking.

A.3

Estimating the transmission fitness advantage of a new variant

In what follows, we define two models describing the dynamics with which a new variant with a
transmission fitness advantage spreads in a population. The first model is based on the assumption
of discrete-time, while the second model is based on the assumption of continuous-time. Both models
have been considered extensively in the literature to estimate fitness advantage (see e.g. [21, 3]). While
in an epidemic, a generation does not end after a fixed time span (discrete-time model), generations
are typically less variable than modeled under an exponential distribution (continuous-time model).
Thus we view the two models as two extremes with the actual dynamics being described by a process
in between. We provide estimates based on both models and suggest that the true parameter may
be anywhere within the ranges spanned by the two models. In the next sections, we provide details
of how we estimate the transmission fitness advantage of B.1.1.7 based on daily data of the total
number of samples and B.1.1.7 samples under these two models.

A.3.1

Discrete time model

We call X the common (non-B.1.1.7) variants and Y the B.1.1.7 variant. The process starts in
generation 0 with x0 cases caused by variant X and y0 cases caused by variant Y . Let the number
of cases in generation n be x(n) and y(n) for variants X and Y .
Let the reproductive number Rd of variant X in generation n be Rd (n). Let the transmission
advantage of variant Y be fd . Then the reproductive number of Y in generation n is (1 + fd )Rd (n).
Thus, we assume a multiplicative fitness advantage.
We have x(n) = x(0)×Rd (0)Rd (1) . . . Rd (n−1) and y(n) = y(0)×Rd (0)Rd (1) . . . Rd (n−1)(1+fd )n .
If Rd is constant through time, we have

x(n) = x(0)Rdn and y(n) = y(0)((1 + fd )Rd )n .

Let the proportion of variant Y at generation n be p(n). We have,

y(0)(1 + f )n
y(n)
=
x(n) + y(n)
x(0) + y(0)(1 + f )n
p(0)(1 + fd )n
=
1 − p(0) + p(0)(1 + fd )n

p(n) =

Thus, p(n) is the logistic function. It does not depend on Rd .
If we write time in days t rather than generations n and assume a generation time of g days, we
get

p(t) =

for parameter estimation from daily data. Parameter a is the logistic growth rate and parameter t0
the sigmoid’s midpoint.
The two free parameters, a and t0 , are related to the two free parameters in Equation 1, fd and
p(0), as follows:

ln(1 + fd )

In particular, we get fd = eag − 1.
A.3.2

Continuous time model

In continuous-time, instead of Rd and generation time g, we define the transmission rate β and the
recovery rate µ. Under this model, the reproductive number is Rc = β/µ. Further, since an individual
in the discrete model recovers after a generation of duration g (during which they left Rd offspring),
we note that g is related to the expected time to recovery 1/µ in the continuous model, and in fact
assume g = 1/µ in what follows. Again our initial numbers of the variants X and Y are x(0) and
y(0). Calendar time is denoted by a continuous parameter t. We then have in expectation,

x(t) = x(0)e(β−µ)t .

(3)

We note that β − µ is coined the Malthusian growth parameter [3].
Further, we again assume that variant Y has a transmission fitness advantage of fc , with transmission rate β(1 + fc ) and recovery rate µ. The population size of the variant at time t is thus
y(t) = y(0)e(β(1+fc )−µ)t .

The proportion of the variant in the population at time t is
y(0)e(β(1+fc )−µ)t
x(0)e(β−µ)t + y(0)e(β(1+fc )−µ)t

where we again recognize the logistic function. We turn again to the more common parameterization,

p(t) =

e−a(t−t0 )

where we thus have fc = βa .
The reproductive number is Rc = β/µ and the mean time to recovery, 1/µ, is equaled to g. Then,
β = Rc /g. Thus,

a=

In particular, we have fc =

Note that the estimated fitness advantage under this model

depends on the reproductive number Rc and is thus changing if Rc is changing through time.
A.3.3

Connection between discrete and continuous time

The discrete and continuous models are very similar. Both have the intitial conditions x(0) and
y(0). For the dynamics, the discrete model has parameters Rd and g while the continuous model has
parameters β and µ. We have Rc = β/µ and we further assumed that g = 1/µ (1/µ is the expected
time until recovery in the continuous setting while g is the time to recovery in the discrete setting).
The different parameterizations of fitness advantage are coined fc and fd . We now determine how fc
and fd are related.
To compare the two models, we now assume that their overall dynamics for the variant X are
the same. After n generations of duration g, we have for variant X,

x(0)e(β−µ)ng = x(0)Rdn
⇐⇒ e(β−µ)g = Rd
⇐⇒ Rd = eRc −1

Using a Taylor expansion for β/µ close to 1, we obtain that indeed Rd = Rc .

For the two models to produce the same growth also for variant Y , we require,

y0 e(β(1+fc )−µ)ng = y0 ((1 + fd )Rd )n
⇐⇒(β(1 + fc ) − µ)g = ln((1 + fd )Rd )
⇐⇒(β − µ)g + fc βg = ln(Rd ) + ln(1 + fd )
⇐⇒fc βg = ln(1 + fd ))
ln(1 + fd )
βg
ln(1 + fd )
.
⇐⇒fc =
Rc
⇐⇒fc =

In the last step, we make use of Rc = β/µ and g = 1/µ.
This is equivalent to fd = eRc fc −1. Using a Taylor expansion we get fd = 1+Rc fc +O((Rc fc )2 )−1
and thus fd = Rc fc for small Rc fc .
A.3.4

Maximum likelihood parameter estimation

Next we explain how we estimate a and t0 of the logistic functions (Eqn. 2 and 5) from our data
using maximum likelihood. We consider that we have data at times t1 , ..., td . At time ti , we obtained
ni samples, where ni is fixed, non-random.
We assume that the true number of B.1.1.7 variants at time ti is a random variable, Ki which is
binomially distributed with parameter p(ti ), i.e.

Ki ∼ B (ni , p(ti )) ,

where p(ti ) =

ea(ti −t0 )
.
1 + ea(ti −t0 )

In particular, we assume here a deterministic logistic growth model for the increase in the proportion of variant Y (Eqn. 2 and 5), on top of which only the drawing process is random. This model
simplifies naturally to a very popular logistic regression. This is an instance of a Generalized Linear
Model, where the natural parameter of the binomial distribution is a linear function of predictors,
the only predictor considered here being the time t.
We use the Python library statsmodel [22] to recover maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) and
confidence intervals based on an asymptotic Gaussian distribution for the parameters of the logistic
regression based on our data, i.e. the fixed values t1 , . . . , td , n1 , . . . , nd as well as the numbers of

samples at each time point being the variant B.1.1.7, k1 , . . . , kd . Parameters a, t0 , fd , fc as well as
the proportions of variant B.1.1.7 p(t) through time are simple transformations of the parameters
of the logistic regression. Their MLEs are the same transformations applied to the MLEs of the
logistic regression parameters. The difference between the MLEs and the true parameters are again
Gaussian, with a covariance matrix found by applying the delta method. This is used to construct
confidence intervals for all these quantities.

Estimation of the effective reproductive number

We use the number of confirmed cases per day from the Federal Office of Public Health, Switzerland,
for 14.12.2020 to 11.03.2021. Then, for each day, we estimate the number of B.1.1.7 variants by
multiplying the total number of confirmed cases by the proportion of B.1.1.7 in our dataset (Viollier
or Risch). We then estimate an effective reproductive number of the B.1.1.7 variant and of the nonB.1.1.7 variants using these data. For this estimation, we use the method developed in [23]. This
method consists of two main parts: first, the observed case data is related to the corresponding time
series of infections. We smooth the observations using LOESS smoothing to remove weekend effects.
Then, we deconvolve with the delay of infection to symptom onset (gamma distributed with mean
5.3 and sd 3.2) and the delay from symptom onset to case confirmation (gamma distributed with
mean 5.5 and sd 3.8). Second, we estimate the effective reproductive number from the time series of
infection incidence using EpiEstim [24]. The reported point estimate is the estimate on the original
case data. To account for uncertainty in the observation process, the observed daily case incidences
are additionally bootstrapped 1000 times, resulting in an ensemble of alternative case incidence time
series and corresponding estimated effective reproductive numbers. These are used to construct the
95% confidence interval around the effective reproductive number, and to calculate the standard
deviation of the ratios of effective reproductive number estimates (see below).
We perform the estimation of the reproductive number in two different ways. First, we estimate
smooth changes in the reproductive number, by estimating it across the entire time series using a 3day sliding window. Second, we assume the reproductive number was constant during time intervals
in which the non-pharmaceutical interventions did not change. Since 18.01.2021, Switzerland has
implemented a set of tighter measures (in particular, shops are closed and the size of gatherings is
restricted to five people [25]). Thus we fix the reproductive number to be constant between 01.01.2021

and 17.01.2021. Then the reproductive number is allowed to change and again fixed to be constant
from 18.01.2021 onwards.
To compare the effective reproductive number R of the B.1.1.7 variant (Y ) to that of non-B.1.1.7
variants (X), we take the ratio ρ =

Discrepancy for Ticino and Lake Geneva

The discrepancy for Ticino and Lake Geneva is not surprising: they had a reproductive number
which was different from the national reproductive number in the first half of January. For Ticino, the
empirical case numbers drop faster than the model, which is in line with a lower reported reproductive
number compared to the national level[14]. For the Lake Geneva region, the empirical case numbers
drop slower than the model, which is in line with a higher reported reproductive number compared
to the national level[14]. For all regions but Ticino, we have enough data to estimate a reproductive
number for the non-B.1.1.7 variants for 01.01.2021-17.01.2021. While for Switzerland, we obtained
a point estimate of 0.83, the point estimates for all regions but Lake Geneva are between 0.81-0.83.
Thus using the point estimate for all of Switzerland for the regional plots - with the exception of
Lake Geneva and Ticino - in Fig. 5 is justified. For Geneva, we obtain a point estimate of 0.88. We
use this point estimate in a Lake Geneva specific model (Fig. S1). Again we observe that the total
number of confirmed cases dropped recently faster compared to the model. For a discussion on the
discrepancy see main text.
