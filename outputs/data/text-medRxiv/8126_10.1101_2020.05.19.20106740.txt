Abstract
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic is creating significant challenges for healthcare
infrastructure for countries of all development and resource levels. Low-and-middle resource
countries face even larger challenges, as their resources are stretched and often insufficient
under normal circumstances. A village in the Papuan highlands of Indonesia; small, isolated,
accessed only by small plane or trekking has experienced an outbreak typical of COVID-19.

Methodology/Principal Findings
This description was compiled from patient care records by lay healthcare workers in M20 (a
pseudonym) during and after an outbreak and from medical doctors responding to online
requests for help. We assume that, for reasons given, the outbreak that has been described
was COVID-19. The dense social structure of the village resulted in a rapid infection of 9095% of the population. Physical distancing and isolation measures were used, but probably
implemented suboptimal and too late, and their effect on the illness course was unclear. The
relatively young population, with a majority of women, probably influenced the impact of the
epidemic, resulting in only two deaths so far.

Conclusions/Significance
This outbreak pattern of suspected SARS-CoV-2 in a village in the highlands of
Papua (Indonesia) presents a unique report of the infection of an entire village population
over five weeks. The age distribution, common in Papuan highland villages may have
reduced case fatality rate (CFR) in this context and that might be the case in similar remote
areas since survival to old age is already very limited and CFR among younger people is
lower.

Author summary
A village in the Papuan highlands of Indonesia; small, isolated, accessed only by small plane
or trekking has experienced an outbreak typical of COVID-19. The outbreak affected 90-95%
of approximately 200 residents between 20 February 2020 and 31 March 2020. Lay health
workers, consisting of trained local volunteers, without healthcare facilities and limited
medication options reached out for help online and managed with what they had available.
Their experience is relevant to others in similar settings. This report describes the village,
outbreak, timeline, symptoms and treatments, and outcomes.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is creating significant challenges for healthcare infrastructure for
countries of all development and resource levels. Low-and-middle resource countries face
even larger challenges, as their resources are stretched and often insufficient under normal
circumstances [1,2]. One such country, Indonesia, is struggling to devise a strategy to manage
the COVID-19 pandemic.
The first official SARS-CoV-2 case in Indonesia was detected on 2 March 2020,
relatively late, given its close links to the original epicenter, Wuhan. At that time, models had
already estimated that there would be more cases [3], and estimated 1-30 directly imported
cases from Wuhan [4,5]. In fact, early reports of suspected cases date back to January 2020
[6] Given Indonesia’s health infrastructure challenges, specifically in the remote rural areas
of the vast archipelago [7], many predicted that remote spread of SARS-CoV-2 may have
severe health effects for these populations.
This case report describes the case of the spread of COVID-19 like illness in one
village, M20, in the rural highlands of Papua, Indonesia.

Methods
This description was compiled from patient care records by lay healthcare workers in M20
during and after an outbreak and from medical doctors responding to online requests for help.
We use a pseudonym to disguise the location of the village to protect data of the patients
involved, and patient data were analyzed anonymously. The research has been approved by
the Research Ethical Review Board of the School of Business and Economics, Vrije
Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Symptoms of villagers asking for medical help
were recorded by lay health workers, so initial, mild symptoms were not systematically
recorded. In most cases the exact onset of infection is not clear. A major caveat is that PCR
testing for COVID-19 was not possible due to the lack of tests. The team repeatedly
contacted the government health services, but PCR testing, or testing using reliable antibody
tests, was not possible till the time of this report.

Results
Context
M20 is severely isolated at an altitude of 6.700 feet in the central mountain range of
Indonesia’s easternmost province, Papua. It is typically served on request by a small 6-8 seat
aircraft, or reached by trekking on foot from other villages. The village consists of seven
hamlets of 2-6 huts, separated by 5-10 minute walks. Villagers are closely related to
inhabitants of other villages in the area, and visit each other often. In Papuan highland
villages the men and/or families sleep together in one hut, and children sleep with their
mothers or families (sometimes up to 30 people in one hut with visitors). The closest village
geographically is about a 1.5 hour hike down the mountain, with social interaction multiple
times a week. The actual population varies with these interactions ranging between 150-200

people. Approximately half of the population is under 12 years of age. There are 4-6
matriarchs and the rest are teenagers, young adults and adults in their 30s-50s. M20 gender
distribution is estimated at 60% women, and 40% men, due to higher life expectancy of
women (66.8 compared to 63.0 for men)[8] and men spending the majority of their time in
towns.
The closest government health center is about three hours hike away, but the trained
health worker is typically absent, as is common in this region [9]. Lay health workers do
daily clinics with basic medicine. They report that common health problems include ear
infections and pneumonia as the main sicknesses. The village altitude is too high for endemic
malaria, but some malaria is imported from towns and villages at lower elevation. Most men
smoke, and most people live in huts with central fire pits, which are used throughout the day
for cooking and during the evening and night for heating [10] TB and HIV have not been
diagnosed by the lay health workers in M20.

Epidemiologic timeline
The index patient in this outbreak reported for care on 20 February, with symptoms of what,
in hindsight, is suspected COVID-19. This patient might have been the first to bring it to the
village, as he had traveled to a neighboring area reporting similar symptoms. Alternatively,
airplane visitors with links to Jakarta or Jayapura are suspected to have transmitted the virus
(in both cities COVID-19 symptoms have been reported in February). Two weeks after this
index case, the medical workload for the local healthcare workers rose steeply (see Figure 1).

The illness started with several days of sore throats, followed by stomach complaints
(diarrhea and vomiting), and next fever within 24 hours of stomach complaints. Fever and
fatigue were constant, lasting 3-5 days. In severe cases, fevers above 40 oC often
accompanied shortness of breath and chest pain. Severe symptoms generally occurred after
day five of illness. Two villagers died on 9 March. Both were male, over 40, and had
apparent underlying chronic illness (most likely kidney problems). They had 48 hours of
extreme shortness of breath.
Since testing was not available, the following differential diagnoses were considered
based on clinical characteristics. 1) COVID-19, symptoms and rapid spread of the illness
match best with known symptoms of COVID-19. 2) Influenza: symptoms were consistent. In
influenza spread is typically less rapid [11,12] 3) RSV (or other virus): RSV usually hits
babies the hardest. which was not true in this illness. 4) Bacterial pneumonia, which is
common, especially in children [13,14] expect low human to human transmission, also
antibiotics did not affect speed of recovery. 5) Pertussis: epidemic pertussis had affected this
village in 2019 with a subsequent vaccine campaign. The characteristic cough in this illness
was less intense than typical pertussis.
The healthcare team treated symptoms with paracetamol, up to four times a day.
Temperatures were checked daily. Patients considered ‘very sick’, with climbing

temperatures, diminished or crackling lung sounds, or ear infections (which are very common
in Papua’s highland population anyway) were given empiric Amoxicillin treatment (49% of
101 patients) to prevent/treat secondary pneumonia. Those with fevers over 40 oC received a
different antibiotic (Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid (2% of the patients) or Azithromycin (3%
of the patients)). The relationship of antibiotics to recovery is not clear.
Because of the increased medical workload, and two deaths in the village, workers
reached out online for medical support to physicians specialized in tropical medicine on 13
March. Suspecting a virus, maybe SARS-CoV-2, consulting physicians advised them to
implement physical distancing measures. Implementation was suboptimal with exposure
already significant in the community.
Upon learning that chloroquine might help stop coronavirus from attaching to the
receptors [15], people in the ‘very sick’ group and high risk people (ages 40 + and those that
were often sick), were given 150mg chloroquine (250mg pill) twice a day for seven days
(14% of the patients). Two older ladies (2% of the cases) were ‘very sick’ and were also
given Azithromycin (500mg initially, 250mg the next four days) based on reports that it
might help. Except the two who died, all patients are recovering or have recovered.
As Figure 1 shows, the entire epidemic curve covers five weeks. The healthcare team
treated 101 patients (half the village). Informal questioning in the community revealed that
only about 10 villagers denied any symptoms yielding a presumptive infection rate of 9095% of all residents within that 4-week period. Table 1 shows that 5 of the 12 patients over
age 40 were very sick, and two of them died. This yields an overall 41% severe and 17%
mortality rate among patients over age 40 and roughly corresponds with other reports [16–18]
This very young age for elderly members of the community reflects the inherent difficulty of
survival in this region. Approximately 50% of villagers experienced mild or no symptoms.

Discussion and conclusion
This outbreak pattern of suspected SARS-CoV-2 in a village in the highlands of
Papua (Indonesia) presents a unique report of the infection of an entire village population
over five weeks. We assume that, for the reasons given, the outbreak that has been described
was COVID-19. The dense social structure of the village resulted in a rapid infection of 9095% of the population. Physical distancing and isolation measures were used, but probably
implemented suboptimal and too late, and their effect on the illness course was unclear.
The M20 population is uniquely young with a mean patient age of 21.7. This might
partially explain the unexpectedly low overall death rate of 1% in the context of minimal
health facilities and no mitigating measures. Two women, over age 50, got severely ill and
were critically affected by the disease but survived. This age distribution, common in Papuan
highland villages may reduce case fatality rate (CFR) in similar remote areas since survival to
old age is already very limited and CFR among younger people is lower. However, the lives
and wisdom of these surviving elders needs to be carefully protected and guarded for tribal,
cultural, and social survival. Treatment with chloroquine phosphate and azithromycin were
used, but caution and further research are needed [19].
A high proportion of women in the demographics may explain that in this village
women were affected more often by the disease than men, but in the older age groups, men
tended to be very sick more often and had higher mortality than women in their age cohorts,
similar to general epidemiologic data of COVID-19.
