ABSTRACT
Importance: Reliable estimates of COVID-19 mortality are crucial to aid control strategies and
to assess the effectiveness of interventions.
Objective: Project COVID-19 mortality trends to October 1, 2020, in 12 countries or regions that
constitute >90% of the global COVID-19 deaths reported as of April 12, 2020.
Design, Setting, and Participants: The Global COVID-19 Assessment of Mortality (GCAM) is an
open, transparent, and continuously updated (www.cghr.org/covid) statistical model that
combines actual COVID-19 mortality counts with Bayesian inference to forecast COVID-19
deaths, the date of peak deaths, and the duration of excess mortality. The analyses covered a
total of 700 million population above age 20 in 12 countries or regions: USA; Italy; Spain;
France; UK; Iran; Belgium; a province of China (Hubei, which accounted for 90% of reported
Chinese deaths); Germany; the Netherlands; Switzerland; and Canada; and six US states: New
York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana, California, and Washington.
Results: Forecasted deaths across the 12 current high-burden countries sum 167,000 to
593,000 (median 253,000). The trajectory of US deaths (49,000-249,000 deaths; median
86,000)—over half of which are expected in states beyond the initial six states analysed in this
study—will have the greatest impact on the eventual total. Mortality ranges are 25,000109,000 (median 46,000) in the UK; 23,000-31,000 (median 26,000) in Italy; 21,000-37,000
(median 26,000) in France and 21,000-32,000 (median 25,000) in Spain. Estimates are most
precise for Hubei, China—where the epidemic curve is complete—and least precise in
California, where it is ongoing. New York has the highest cumulative median mortality rate per
million (1135), about 12-fold that of Germany. Mortality trajectories are notably flatter in
Germany, California, and Washington State, each of which took physical distancing and testing
strategies seriously. Using past country-specific mortality as a guide, GCAM predicts surge
capacity needs, reaching more than twice existing capacity in a number of places., In every
setting, the results might be sensitive to undercounts of COVID-19 deaths, which are already
apparent.
Conclusion and Relevance: Mortality from COVID-19 will be substantial across many settings,
even in the best case scenario. GCAM will provide continually updated and increasingly precise
estimates as the pandemic progresses.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has already caused over 115,000 deaths, with
global deaths doubling every week.1-3 Mortality is less biased than case reporting, which is
affected by testing policies. However, the daily reporting of COVID-19 deaths is already known
to undercount actual deaths, varying over time and place.4-6

Reliable estimates of total COVID-19 mortality, the date of peak deaths, and of the duration of
excess mortality are crucial to aid responses to the current and potential future pandemics. We
have developed the Global COVID-19 Assessment of Mortality (GCAM), a statistical model to
project COVID-19 mortality trends to October 1 2020 in 12 countries or regions that constitute
>90% of the global COVID-19 deaths reported as of April 12th. We report also on six US states
that account for 70% of the American totals to date (Supplementary Appendix).1 We quantify
the COVID-19 mortality trajectory ranges in each setting. A semi-automated website
(www.cghr.org/covid) provides daily updates. GCAM is open, transparent, and uses a
reasonably simple method that employs publicly reported mortality data to make plausible
projections. The method is designed to improve as more mortality data become available over
longer time periods.

METHODS
The goal of the University of Toronto’s GCAM is to provide medium-term mortality forecasts.
For each country, US state, and for Hubei Province in China, GCAM uses non-linear regressions
to fit a five parameter model to the observed daily mortality counts. We used Bayesian
inference, via the algorithm from Carpenter et al.,7 of several thousand posterior (“prior”)

probabilities of potential epidemic curves for each country. The model builds on observed daily
mortality counts for places that have already reached the peak of their epidemic (such as
Hubei, China), or are near their peak (e.g. Italy and Spain), where the posterior probabilities are
less relevant. For the majority of settings where the epidemic is still accelerating, death counts
are currently less predictive, since a variety of curves can fit any particular series of increasing
counts. In these cases, GCAM relies on Bayesian prior distributions, which are quantifications of
expert knowledge of the underlying process expressed as probability distributions for model
parameters. Bayesian prior distributions allow use of past epidemiological knowledge from
China where COVID-19 has already declined, as well as the mortality trajectories of diseases
caused by similar coronaviruses causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)8 or the
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).9

Mortality Data Sources
We systematically collected COVID-19 mortality data for all countries with more than 100
deaths. We examine the top ten countries ranked by the total number of COVID-19 deaths as of
April 12th: USA; Italy; Spain; France; UK; Iran; Belgium, Hubei province, China (as this accounted
for 90% of reported Chinese deaths); Germany and the Netherlands. We also included
Switzerland, Canada and the US States of New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana, California,
and Washington. We collated daily mortality data (where reported by age and sex) from the
World Health Organization (WHO), country reports,10 and from online data collections.1-3
Definitions of COVID-19 mortality vary across countries. The WHO has created a new
International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, ICD-10 code, U07.2,11 but this has been

applied inconsistently across countries. In some countries (e.g., the Netherlands), only deaths
of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19, are counted as
definitely due to the virus.12 We deemed each setting’s epidemic to have begun on the day
after the first death is recorded. We forecast deaths until October 1, 2020, but most deaths will
have occurred by July 1.

To enable contrasts with current COVID-19 mortality (which is nearly always from acute
respiratory failure), we examined the WHO Mortality database13 to quantify the average
baseline pneumonia and influenza deaths during 2015-17. For the US, we used the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mortality database,14 and for China, we used the Global
Burden of Disease.15 We obtained age- and sex- specific population denominators from the
United Nations Population Division,16 and for Hubei, China, and for US states, from national
vital statistics.14,17

Statistical modelling of mortality
We assumed the mean number of daily deaths for each setting to follow the shape of a skewnormal density function, which resembles a typical “bell-shaped” normal distribution with
added skewness to permit an epidemic to rise fast but fall slowly (as has already been observed
with COVID-19 deaths).1-3 The observed deaths Yi(t) in region i on day t follows a negative
binomial distribution with mean λi(t) and overdispersion parameter τ, or more specifically:
Yi(t) ~ Neg Binom [λi(t), τ]
λi(t)= Ei Ci f(t; Ai, Bi, Ki) + Di.

The Ei are age and sex standardized death counts, obtained from each country’s population
data and age-specific mortality risk calculated from Italian data on 29 March 2020.18 The model
parameters which determine the shape of the epidemic curve are: Ci, the expected total deaths
relative to the Italian rates on 29 March; Ai, the location of the peak of the epidemic; Bi, the
duration of the epidemic (roughly the standard deviation); Ki, the skewness parameter
specifying the steepness of the growth phase of the epidemic relative to the decline phase; and
Di, a ‘spark’ term allowing for occasional deaths outside the range of the main epidemic.
We used the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm within the Stan software.7 From each
posterior sample of the model parameters, we computed the intensity λi(t) and simulated
potential future death counts from the negative binomial distribution. We calculated
predictions envelopes, which contain the entire true epidemic curve from the samples by
applying the methodology of Myllymäki et al.19 We chose probability distributions to generate
simulated epidemic curves consistent with data from Italy and Hubei, China,1-3 and with SARS
and MERS outbreaks.8,9 The Supplementary Appendix provides the prior distributions for all
parameters, as well as simulated epidemics for a population with Italy’s demographic structure.
As model validation, we fitted the model to training data of deaths on or before March 20 and
compared the projections with data observed up to April 12.

For each country, we present the actual mortality daily totals, projected daily and totals, the
date of peak mortality and derive credible intervals (CI), at various probability levels. We
calculated age-specific mortality rates at age 20 years or more for influenza and pneumonia,
and present totals for both sexes, as COVID-19 deaths are only rarely reported in children and

RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the results for six European countries with over 2,000 COVID-19 deaths to date
and the USA. Each blue dot indicates daily actual deaths. The dark line is the median model
projection and the red shaded area represents credible intervals. Mortality has already peaked
in Italy and Spain (March 29 and April 1, respectively). The Netherlands and France next peaked
on April 5 and 7, respectively, followed by Belgium (April 9) and Germany (April 13). The USA
and UK will reach their peaks on April 18 and 21, respectively. Figure 2 provides these results
for Hubei, China and Iran, where peaks occurred earlier, on February 12 and March 28,
respectively. The peak date for Switzerland is April 7, and, with less certainty, for Canada, May
4. For the US states, Louisiana has likely peaked first (April 8), followed by Washington state
(April 10), New York and Michigan (April 11), New Jersey (April 14), and with less certainty,
California (April 14). By July 1, all epidemics will be effectively over.

Current COVID-19 deaths, the credible ranges of forecasted deaths, the death rate per 1 million
(M) population, and the percentage of national deaths over a whole year for all 18 countries or
states/provinces are provided in Table 1. The USA can expect 49,000-249,000 deaths (median
86,000). Mortality ranges are 25,000-109,000 (median 46,000) in the UK; 23,000-31,000
(median 26,000) in Italy; 21,000-37,000 (median 26,000) in France and 21,000-32,000 (median
25,000) in Spain. Ranges for other countries are as shown. Collectively, across the 12 countries,
the range of deaths is 167,000 to 593,000 (median 253,000). The lowest value would be

approximately a 50% increase in COVID-19 deaths over totals as of April 14 in these countries.
The maximum would represent more than 500% increase of deaths. As a proportion of all
annual mortality, the median estimate of excess COVID-19 mortality ranges from 1.0% in Hubei
to 8.1% in Belgium. Median deaths in the USA and the UK represent 3.2% and 7.8%,
respectively of total non-COVID-19 deaths in 2020.

The column called precision represents the ratio of upper to lower uncertainty estimates. The
most precise estimates are in settings where the epidemic has peaked or nearly peaked: Hubei,
China (1.1), Italy (1.3), and Spain (1.5). The least precise estimates are for Canada (11.1) and
California (10.6). The USA and the UK show moderate precision 5.1 and 4.4, respectively.

Table 2 provides an estimate of the maximal daily totals, ranging from median values of 4,787
in the USA to 114 in Switzerland, and within the USA, individual states ranging from 1,303 in
New York to 49 in Washington state. We used the average annual deaths in previous years from
pneumonia and influenza in both sexes above age 20 years as a crude indicator of existing
hospital and ventilator capacity. We compare these totals against the median COVID-19 deaths,
and this ratio provides an estimate of the “surge” capacity needed to deal with the excess
COVID-19 deaths. The highest ratios are in France and Spain (each 2.1). We estimate the
number of days in which COVID-19 deaths will exceed the daily death total of pneumonia in
earlier years to be highest in Canada at 73 (39-104) with other settings averaging 62 days (4883).

A crude approximation of which jurisdictions have had some success in “flattening the curve” is
shown in Figure 3, which contrasts the trajectories expressed as deaths per 1 million population
in Italy, France, and Germany. All three countries reported their first case almost
simultaneously, but Germany took the most aggressive steps to expand testing. Compared to
the other two countries, the German peak is lower with fewer peak day deaths. Similarly, the
rapid and early increase in deaths in New York state (mainly in New York City), which accounts
for about 25% of the forecasted USA death totals, contrasts with the flatter trajectory in
Washington and California, which both adopted reasonably aggressive efforts in physical
distancing and other control measures. The upper credible interval of rates per million in
Washington and California is below the lowest credible interval in New York. The contrast in
cumulative rates per 1 M population across the countries with rising totals, and the US states
(Figure 4) also illustrate marked divergence in mortality trajectories. New York has the highest
cumulative median mortality rate per million (1135) which is about 12-fold that of Germany
(96).

DISCUSSION
Our forecasting predicts that in 12 early high-burden countries, the minimum number of
COVID-19 deaths will be about 50% higher than current, reaching about 167,000 deaths.
However, a worst case scenario would be just under 593,000 deaths, or a 500% increase over
current totals. Much of the trajectory across these countries depends on what happens in the
USA, which accounts for 30-40% of the cross country forecasted totals. Within the USA, COVID19 deaths will be a minimum of 49,000 or about 2 fold over current, but could reach 249,000.

Within the US, most of the increase will be from outside the initial six states we examined, and
in these settings micro epidemics with different trajectories are likely to occur, as has been
observed in sub-parts of Italy and Spain.1-3

The wide variation in forecasted mortality suggests interventions might help reduce the
eventual total. Reassuringly, our analyses is sufficiently robust to fit actual death patterns in
Italy and Spain, and confirms that Germany, Washington and California, which have taken
testing, isolation and other strategies seriously have flatter trajectories and lower daily totals
than areas with looser measures. This has allowed valuable time to scale up acute bed and
ventilator capacity.

An acute excess of hospitalizations and deaths, clustered over short time periods, can swamp
any health system, as indeed happened in northern Italy. Italy faced more pressures in one
month on ventilator and critical-care bed supply than the usual annual burden.21 Model-based
estimates for the USA suggest that above age 55 years, ten people will need hospitalization for
every COVID-19 death.22 For each country, GCAM provides additional details of when these
deaths will peak and the duration of excess deaths, which will average about 62 days but with a
wide range (Indeed suggesting that California already has sufficient capacity to meet the surge
of cases). Such information should aid planning and help avert an overwhelming of health
systems.

Initial infectious disease models estimated total COVID-19 deaths in the USA of 1 to 2.2 million
(roughly 40% to 80% over and above the usual annual total of 2.8 million deaths) if no action
were taken.23 These same projections suggested 510,000 COVID-19 deaths in the UK, roughly
doubling the current annual total. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model
considers physical distancing through May 2020 and has median death estimates lower than
ours (Supplementary Appendix). However, the IHME model has some implausible results like
suggesting that Netherlands will have 16,000 deaths which is only slightly below their estimate
for France and Spain, despite being at least three times larger in population.22 Moreover, the
IHME analyses assumes a symmetrical bell-shaped mortality curve, whereas a skewed curve
(which we use) is observed in the actual data.1-3 Our totals for the USA fall broadly within the
range projected by the White House Task Force of 100,000 to 240,000 deaths,24 and our
Canadian estimates are consistent with infectious disease dynamic model results.25

There is little doubt that some of GCAM forecasts are wrong as undercounts of COVID-19 and
delayed reporting are common.4-6 For example, the undercount in UK COVID-19 deaths might
have been about 70% for some weeks.4 For France, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK, we could
find some record of undercounts and correcting for these substantially raised the total deaths
in each country (Supplementary Appendix). However, systematic examination of undercounts
across settings is needed to establish if the undercounts have accelerated during the epidemic,
which would mean that we have underestimated the speed of the upward trajectory, or if they
are more random, in which case our results would mostly be unaffected. Future iterations of
GCAM will incorporate undercounts in as many countries as document these. Differences in

reporting across countries does not bias the results for any one country however, as mortality
forecasts rely on actual counts within each country. Third, in settings with few deaths over
many days, the model becomes highly sensitive to the assumed prior distributions. However,
the model validation (Supplementary Appendix) showed reasonably good performance with
actual death counts in several countries. As with all models, ours emphasizes the need to obtain
additional days of observation and rerun the analyses as data improve, and as additional
epidemiological research results become available.26 The GCAM is set up to be do so, hence its
results improve constantly.

In a time of crisis, open data sharing is particularly important, hence the full input details and
code of GCAM are freely available (www.cghr.org/covid) and we welcome criticisms and
suggestions on how to refine our estimates. We provide a simple metric of precision that can be
used to gauge improvements over time. Future iterations will also provide estimates for subnational regions of the USA and other countries, particularly for Asian and African countries
with weaker health systems and mortality surveillance capacity.27
