Abstract

28

29

Cognitive impairment is increasingly recognized as a sequela of COVID-19. It is unknown how

30

cognition changes and relates to functional gain during inpatient rehabilitation. We administered

31

the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at admission to 77 patients undergoing inpatient

32

rehabilitation for COVID-19 in a large U.S. academic medical center. 45 patients were

33

administered the MoCA at discharge. Functional gain was assessed by change in the Quality

34

Indicator for Self-Care (QI-SC). In the full sample, 80.5% of patients exhibited cognitive

35

impairment on admission, which was associated with prior delirium. Among 45 patients with

36

retest data, there were significant improvements in MoCA and QI-SC. QI-SC score gain was

37

higher in patients who made clinically meaningful changes on the MoCA, an association that

38

persisted after accounting for age and delirium history. Cognitive impairment is frequent among

39

COVID-19 patients, but improves over time and is associated with functional gain during

40

inpatient rehabilitation.

Introduction

43

Cognitive impairment is increasingly recognized as a sequela of mild and severe COVID-

44

19 infection(1–4). However, it is still unclear how cognitive impairment after COVID-19 evolves

45

and relates to functional outcomes. Cognitive may improve in COVID-19 patients undergoing

46

rehabilitation(5,6), but existing studies have not evaluated the association between cognitive

47

change and functional gain, particularly in inpatient rehabilitation when early interventions can

48

be implemented. Cognition is associated with functional gain in rehabilitation in other

49

illnesses(7–9). Determining whether such an association exists in the inpatient rehabilitation

50

phase after COVID-19 could provide additional targets for early treatment to optimize outcome.

51

The primary goal of the present study was to evaluate change in cognition and its relation

52

to functional gain among COVID-19 patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. A secondary

53

goal was to add to a growing body of literature that describes the frequency, severity, and

54

predictors of cognitive impairment after COVID-19.

55

Methods

56

Participants. 94 patients with COVID-19 admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation unit in a

57

United States medical center from March-August 2020. Patients were medically stable and able

58

to tolerate 3 hours/day of occupational, physical, and speech-language therapy.

59

Seventeen patients were not administered our cognitive measure because (1) they were

60

admitted prior to knowledge of COVID-19-related cognitive deficits and the implementation of

61

our screening protocol; (2) clinicians deemed it could not be reliably administered due to

62

language barriers; or (3) clinicians deemed patients were cognitively intact.

Data were extracted from retrospective chart reviews under approval of the Weill Cornell

63

64

Medicine Institutional Review Board. 19/77 patients underwent a separate neuropsychological

65

evaluation during their admission, the results of which have been published5; the results

66

described here are novel.
Outcome Measures. We extracted included age, gender (male or female), prior level of

67

68

function (independent or not), intubation history (yes or no) and length (in days), delirium

69

history (yes or no), and inpatient rehabilitation and acute hospitalization lengths of stay (Table

70

1).

71

The MoCA (10) was administered within 72 hours of admission to inpatient

72

rehabilitation. Scores on the MoCA range from 0-30 and ranges indicate ≥26=normal, 18-

73

25=mild impairment, 11-17=moderate impairment, and ≤10=severe impairment. The minimal

74

clinical important difference (MCID) of 3 points was used(11). Three patients received the Blind

75

MoCA, which was converted to 30-point scale per established guidelines. Discharge MoCA was

76

administered to 45/77 patients. 32 patients did not receive a discharge MoCA as they either

77

scored normal on the initial assessment, were unavailable, and/or declined.

78

The Quality Indicator for Self-Care (QI-SC) (12) is a standard functional assessment in

79

the United States. Items scored on a scale of 1 to 6 include eating, grooming, toileting, bathing,

80

upper body dressing, lower body dressing, and donning/doffing footwear. Total score ranges

81

from 7 (total assistance) to 42 (independent). Occupational therapists assigned admission and

82

discharge QI-SC scores to all patients.

83

84

Statistical Analyses. We used descriptive statistics to describe the frequency of cognitive
impairment. We used independent and paired-samples t-tests with effect sizes (Cohen’s d), and

Spearman rank-order correlations, to evaluate associations between clinical characteristics and

86

admission MoCA, change in MoCA and QI-SC from admission to discharge, and QI-SC change

87

in patients who met or did not meet the MoCA MCID. To adjust for age and to account for the

88

effect of multiple variables, we used multivariable linear regression models.

Results

91

Table 1 provides demographic and clinical data. Patients with discharge MoCA scores

92

(n=45) did not differ from those who were not administered the MoCA at discharge (n=32) in

93

age, gender, prior neurologic history, prior delirium, prior intubation, or prior hypoxia (all

94

p’s>.05).

95

Cognitive Impairment at Admission to Rehabilitation. 62/77 patients (80.5%)

96

demonstrated cognitive deficits on the MoCA at admission: 39/77 (51%) had mild deficits, 20/77

97

(26%) had moderate deficits, and 3/77 (4%) had severe deficits.

98

99

Correlates of Cognitive Impairment at Admission to Rehabilitation. Admission MoCA
scores were lower for patients who previously had delirium (Mean Difference=3.08, 95% CI:

100

.58-5.58, t=2.45, p=.02, d=.58). Admission MoCA scores were not correlated with age (‫ݎ‬௦ =-.15,

101

p=.19), length of intubation (‫ݎ‬௦ = -.04, p=.72), or acute hospitalization length of stay (‫ݎ‬௦ =-.08

102

p=.50). In a multivariable linear regression predicting admission MoCA from age, history of

103

delirium, length of intubation, and length of acute care hospitalization, the overall model was

104

significant (R2=.13, F=2.53, p=.049). Among predictors, only history of delirium had a

105

significant association with admission MoCA (β=-3.67, t=2.35, p=.02).

106

Change in Cognition and Association with Functional Gain. The 45 patients with

107

admission and discharge MoCA scores improved on the MoCA (Mean Difference=4.02, 95% CI:

108

2.92-5.13, t=7.35, p<.001, d=1.10) and QI-SC (Mean Difference=12.16, 95% CI: 10.3-14.01,

109

t=13.19, p<.001, d=1.97) (Figure 1). 32/45 patients (71%) met the MoCA MCID. There was a

110

greater increase in QI-SC scores in patients who met the MoCA MCID than those who did not

111

(Mean Difference=4.41, 95% CI: 0.49-8.34, t=2.27, p=.03, d=0.75; Figure 2). To evaluate the

112

robustness of this association, we conducted a multivariable linear regression with the outcome

113

of QI-SC score change and predictors of MoCA MCID (met or did not meet/declined), age, and

114

history of delirium. While the overall model was not statistically significant (R2=.13, F=2.03,

115

p=.125), among individual predictors, improvement by the MoCA MCID continued to have a

116

significant association with QI-SC score change (β=4.74, t=2.31, p=.03) after adjusting for age

117

and history of delirium. Despite overall improvement, at discharge, 35/45 (78%) continued to

118

exhibit cognitive impairment on the MoCA.

119

120

121

Discussion
Our main findings are (1) cognitive impairment is common in COVID-19 patients

122

undergoing inpatient rehabilitation and associated with a history of delirium; (2) cognition and

123

function (self-care) improves significantly during inpatient rehabilitation; and (3) clinically

124

meaningful gains in cognition are associated with improved functional gains.

125

COVID-19 patients exhibited significant improvement in cognition with a large effect

126

size. Cognitive improvement over time may reflect natural recovery, improvement in residual

127

effects of prior delirium, and/or rehabilitation intervention effects. Our results indicate that

128

cognition evolves after COVID-19 and suggests that it may be beneficial to implement cognitive

129

interventions to facilitate functional recovery(5). Despite recovery, a majority of our sample

130

continued to demonstrate cognitive impairment at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation,

131

highlighting the importance of continued management of cognition post-discharge(6).

132

COVID-19 patients also experienced a significant improvement in their functional self-

133

care skills. Notably, significantly greater functional improvement was seen in patients who

134

exhibited a clinically meaningful improvement in cognition. Although we cannot make causal

135

conclusions, these findings suggest that addressing cognitive impairment after COVID-19 may

136

improve functional outcomes.

137

Consistent with prior research, we replicate findings of a high frequency of cognitive

138

impairment, predominantly mild impairment, in recovering COVID-19 patients. Also consistent

139

with the literature on the negative consequences of delirium after COVID-19(13–15), delirium

140

during acute hospitalization was associated with greater cognitive impairment at admission to

141

rehabilitation. This emphasizes the potential importance of early detection and management of

142

delirium after COVID-19.

143

Among limitations of this study, discharge cognitive data were not available for 32/77

144

patients, which may have biased findings. However, there were no demographic or clinical

145

differences between the 45 patients with and 32 patients without discharge cognitive data.

146

Missing data highlight challenges of administering objective cognitive assessments in an acute

147

inpatient setting, particularly during a time in which the cognitive sequelae of COVID-19 were

148

relatively unknown and hospital policies and procedures were rapidly evolving at the initial

149

surge of the pandemic. Prospective longitudinal research is necessary to estimate the true

150

prevalence of cognitive dysfunction, its evolution post-hospitalization, and to ascertain
