Abstract
Objective:
To estimate surge capacities and demands of Brazil’s health system in view of severe cases of
the novel coronavirus disease.
Methods:
Three types of hospital equipments demanded by severe COVID-19 patients are considered:
available intensive care unit (ICU) beds, existing surgery operating rooms and respirators
located in other hospital areas. They are taken into account on a cumulative basis forming
three levels of hospital equipment usage. Based on a mean duration of hospitalization for the
disease, it is estimated the daily admission capacity of infected patients per state and for the
entire country for each level of hospital equipment usage. Furthermore, an exponential
regression model is fitted by means of the daily national number of new documented patients.
The prediction intervals for the number of new patients for certain days in the immediate
future are then calculated and compared to the admissible daily demand for the three
incremental groups of equipments. The data are made publicly available by the Brazilian
federal government and are gathered and analyzed by means of the Python programming
language.
Results:
41% of the (adult) ICU beds in Brazil were available during 2019, indicating that this hospital
equipment has not been on average operating near capacity in national numbers. Nevertheless,
there is a marked heterogeneity in the absolute and relative numbers of available and existing
ICU beds and existing surgery operating rooms and extra respirators between its states.

Conclusions:
The remarkable differences between states’ hospital resources directly reflect into the number
of possible daily admissions of COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure for the three
considered levels of hospital equipment usage. In national numbers, Brazil’s health system is
estimated to be capable of daily admitting 693, 1243 and 2166 severe patients under the three
studied scenarios. The fitted model predicted that only the first limit, if any, would be
reached.

Introduction
Starting in the state capital of Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the novel coronavirus
(SARS-COV-2) has been spreading rapidly all over the world and the World Health
Organization (WHO) declared its disease, COVID-19, as a pandemic on 11th March 2020.
One and a half month later the number of confirmed infections neared the three millions mark
and 200000 deaths and reached almost every country and territory across the world, according
to the Johns Hopkins University tracker (https://www.jhu.edu/).
Like the pandemic influenza in 1918, COVID-19 is associated with respiratory spread, an
undetermined percentage of infected people with presymptomatic or asymptomatic cases
transmitting infection to others, and a high fatality rate1.
Ji et al., after performing analysis of 70641 confirmed cases and 1772 deaths due to COVID19 and assuming that average levels of healthcare are similar throughout China, consider that
higher numbers of infections in a given population can be considered an indirect indicator of a
heavier healthcare burden. By plotting the mortality rate against the incidence of the disease
(cumulative number of confirmed cases since the start of the outbreak, per 10000 population)
they have found a significant positive correlation, suggesting that mortality is correlated with
healthcare burden and, consequently, with healthcare resource availability in an inverse
correlation2.
In this fashion, the present work mainly proposes to estimate surge capacities of Brazil’s
health system associated with severe cases of COVID-19. Three incremental levels of hospital
equipment usage are considered: (1) in terms of available intensive care unit (ICU) beds; (2)
in terms of available ICU beds and existing surgery operating rooms; and (3) in terms of
available ICU beds and existing surgery operating rooms and respirators located in other
hospital areas. Based on a reference mean duration of hospitalization for the disease, it is
estimated the daily admission capacity of infected patients per state and for the entire country
for each level of hospital equipment usage.
To the best of the authors’ knowledge it is the first public attempt to estimate (without
mathematical simulation) the average availability of critical care beds in hospitals of the entire
country deducting from the existing beds the equivalent number of beds that has been
occupied during 2019 on a monthly average3,4. Two even more recent studies than the ones
performed by Moraes3 and Goldwasser et al.4 also do not address the occupancy of ICU
beds5,6.

Moreover, an exponential regression model is fitted using the available data for the daily
national number of new patients who have been documented as infected. The prediction
intervals for the number of new patients for certain days in the immediate future are then
calculated and compared to the admissible daily demand for the three incremental groups of
equipments.

Modeling capacities
The data sources for estimating the hospital equipments available to treat severe COVID-19
patients are two health information systems: the National Registry of Health Facilities of
Brazil (CNES) and the Hospital Information System of the Brazilian Public Health System
(SIHSUS). The CNES data, obtained per facility, concern: (1) the number of existing ICU
beds dedicated to the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) (

The types of ICU beds taken into account are the ones that are designed for adults, including
the ones for burned, coronary and isolated patients and excluding the neonatal and pediatric
beds6. It has been taken into account only the healthcare facilities that have at least one ICU
bed dedicated to SUS and that remained as such during all months of 2019. Each one of the
five healthcare facility quantities considered and mentioned on the previous paragraph have
been arithmetically averaged through the months of 2019, leading to:

Modeling predictions
The daily number of documented COVID-19 infections in Brazil between 26th February 2020
and 22th April 2020 is provided by DATASUS at https://covid.saude.gov.br/, and it has
allowed to fit, using ordinary least squares, a two-degree exponential regression model to
represent the trained part of this dataset comprised in total of 51 observations:

   #.

$%#.!&'(#.##!#(మ

8

where n is the nth day since 26th February 2020 and y is the number of new COVID-19 cases
on the nth day. Equation (8) represents the best fit among one to eight-degree exponential
regression models and one to eight-degree polynomial regression models using the R2 score as
statistical measure. Each model has been trained on 70% of the randomly chosen observations
and the test R2 score is 0·98 and it has been computed on the 30% remaining observations.

Results
The scatter plot of the daily new number of COVID-19 cases and the curve of the best model
(8) are illustrated in Figure 1. In an informative capacity, it is also shown the scatter plot of
the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases against the date in Figure 2.
Four vectors (of size 1937) that represent quantities of hospital equipments and are defined in
the “Modeling capacities” section are vertically aligned and gathered as Table 1, which thus
contains: the monthly mean of available and existing (adult) ICU beds (excluding neonatal
and pediatric units), the monthly mean of existing surgery operating rooms and the monthly
mean of extra respirators per healthcare facility (only listed six facilities). It can be seen that,
during the year of 2019, 9021 ICU beds were on average available in Brazil out of 21908 that
are appropriate to accommodate adult COVID-19 patients. It is as if at any given instant of
2019 41% of the ICU beds in the country were available, indicating that this hospital
equipment has not been on average operating near or at capacity in terms of national numbers

and it is worth mentioning that this ICU availability rate is 7·6 percentage points larger than in
the United States7. Table 2 aggregates the data of Table 1 per state (including the federal
capital territory Distrito Federal (DF)).
Table 3 depicts the equivalent quantities of Table 2 in terms of 10000 inhabitants. The 2019
population data that allow calculate these rates are present in the website of the Brazilian
Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) (https://www.ibge.gov.br/). Comparing Table 2
and Table 3 it can be seen that the Roraima state (RR) is the most precarious in terms of
available and existing ICU beds and existing operating rooms (20; 40; 18), and the most
precarious in terms of available ICU beds per 10000 inhabitants is the state of Mato Grosso
do Sul (MS) with 0·23. On the other hand, the São Paulo (SP) state has the largest absolute
number of existing ICU beds (4838), but the state of Tocantins (TO) appears as the most
equipped in terms of available ICU beds per 10000 (0·65). The Brazilian national rate of
existing (adult) ICU beds per 10000 (1·04) is less than a third of the United States rate in the
year of 2009 (3·47)8.
Table 4, also constructed based on Table 2, illustrates the available capacity of Brazil’s health
system to face severe COVID-19 cases considering three incremental levels of hospital
equipment usage: (1) in terms of available ICU beds (named Level 1;  ); (2) available ICU
beds and existing surgery operating rooms (Level 2;   ! ); and (3) available ICU beds and
existing surgery operating rooms and respirators located in other hospital areas (Level 3;




 !  & ). It is thus assumed that all existing surgery operating rooms and respirators

located in other hospital areas (computed accordingly to equation (7)) can be allocated to
attend the critically infected by COVID-19.
Assuming the mean duration of hospitalization as 12·8 days, one can estimate the possible
daily admission of patients with respiratory failure for each of the three incremental groups of
hospital equipments considered in Table 49. Such rates are shown in Table 5 as Scenario 1,
Scenario 2 and Scenario 3, respectively. The Brazilian state that can admit the least number of
severe COVID-19 patients considering only the usage of available ICU beds is RR (1 per day)
and, in the worst-case scenario (demand of the available ICU beds and existing operating
rooms and respirators located in other hospital areas), the state with the worst number is
Amapá (AP): 3 possible admissions per day. On the other extreme, it is the state of SP, which
can daily admit the largest number of severe patients for all scenarios (130, 251, 544), but also
is the most populated state, and has the biggest Italian community of Brazil, the most
internationally connected Brazilian airport and the two most busiest Brazilian airports in

terms of domestic passenger traffic10-12. It is worth noting that, at least up until 22th April
2020, Italy was one of the three countries most impacted by COVID-19 and the SP state had
the fifth largest number of documented cases of the coronavirus disease per inhabitant.
It can be argued from Table 5 that if it reaches a point at which Brazil’s health system is daily
admitting more than 693, 1243 and 2166 patients with respiratory failure the system may
demonstrate stress under Scenario 1, Scenario 2 and Scenario 3, respectively. In this way,
assuming that 15% of documented COVID-19 infections result in severe disease the daily
numbers of new COVID-19 cases would have to be at maximum 4620 (693/0.15), 8287
(1243/0.15) and 14440 (2166/0.15) in order to not demand Brazil’ health system beyond the
limits of Scenario 1, Scenario 2 and Scenario 3, respectively13.
According to the fitted exponential regression model (8), the lower bound values of its 90%
predictions intervals indicate that the admissible numbers of daily new infected people of
Scenario 1 (4620), Scenario 2 (8287) or Scenario 3 (14440) would not be reached in April
2020. Conversely, the upper bounds revel that only the limit of Scenario 1, consisted of
available ICU beds, would be first reached on the 14th of April 2020. The 90% prediction
interval for this date is [915, 4633], which means that 90% of intervals of these forms will
contain the true number of new COVID-19 cases for this date. Along with the uncertainty that
resides in the own definition of prediction intervals, their ranges for the fitted model are quite
significant, expressing another source of uncertainty regarding the true number of new
COVID-19 cases for a certain date.

Discussions
Acknowledging, as suggested by Ji et al., the potential negative association of COVID-19
mortality rate with healthcare resource availability might help Brazil to be better prepared for
its outbreak2. In this way, it has been estimated that 41% of the (adult) ICU beds in Brazil
were available during 2019, indicating that this hospital equipment is not on average
operating near or at capacity in terms of national numbers and it is worth mentioning that this
ICU availability rate is 7·6 percentage points larger than in the United States7. On the other
hand, the Brazilian rate of existing (adult) ICU beds per 10000 (1·04) is less than a third of the
United States rate in the year of 2009 (3·47)8.
Moreover, there is a marked heterogeneity in the absolute and relative numbers of available
and existing ICU beds and existing surgery operating rooms and extra respirators between the
states of Brazil (including its federal capital territory). The remarkable differences between

states’ hospital resources directly reflect into the number of possible admissions per day of
COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure for each of the three levels of hospital equipment
usage.
In national numbers, Brazil’s health system is estimated to be capable of daily admitting at
maximum 693, 1243 and 2166 patients with respiratory failure under the three studied
scenarios and the fitted exponential growth model indicates that Brazil’ health system will not
reach the limit of Scenario 2 and Scenario 3 in April and might or not reach the limit of
Scenario 1 on April 2020.
This work concern data of 2019 and, consequently, takes into account only hospital
equipments available previously to the COVID-19 disease outbreak. Additionally, it does not
include hospitals that do not have at least one critical care bed dedicated to SUS.
