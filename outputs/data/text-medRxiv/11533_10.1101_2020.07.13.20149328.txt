Abstract

Objectives:

Critically ill patients with COVID-19 may suffer from a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) characterized by
remarkably high levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6). We assessed the effects of tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor
antagonist, on intra-hospital mortality and development of positive cultures in patients with COVID-19 admitted
to the ICU.

Design:

Patients with COVID 19 admitted in the ICU who were treated with tocilizumab plus standard care were
enrolled and compared to controls.

Setting

COVID-19 severe disease

Patients

Patients with severe COVID-19 disease admitted in the ICU.

Interventions

Tocilizumab 400 mg IV two doses. Standard and intensive medical care as per institutional clinical protocol.

Measures and Main Results

Main outcome: 1) intra-hospital mortality; Secondary Outcomes: 1) the need for renal replacement therapy, 2)
use of antibiotics and positive culture, and 3) inflammatory and oxygenation markers. There was no difference
in mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, use of antibiotics or positive cultures between the two groups.
The use of corticosteroids was more frequent in the treatment group. Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and
WBC (white blood cells) counts declined significantly faster in the treatment group. Oxygenation markers rose
significantly higher in patients in the tocilizumab group as compared to controls.

Conclusion:

Tocilizumab was associated with rapid improvement in oxygenation and a faster decrease of CRP and WBC
counts in patients with COVID-19 and should be evaluated as rescue therapy for patients with progressive
disease

Introduction

In 2019, an outbreak of a new virus known as SARS-CoV-2 has spread into a pandemic. On July 2020,
Brazil has been the second most hit country in the world, accounting for almost 2 million cases. (1) The
COVID-19 disease may vary from asymptomatic disease to a multiorgan systemic failure syndrome. Some
studies have shown an association between patterns of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with remarkably high
levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and worse outcome in critically ill patients. (2,3) Tocilizumab is a recombinant
humanized monoclonal antibody which antagonizes the IL-6 receptor. (4) Preliminary reports suggested that the
use of tocilizumab in patients SARS-CoV-2 was associated with significant clinical and laboratory
improvement. (5,6) This drug is not already labeled for use in this disease.

We evaluated the effect of tocilizumab on the intra-hospital mortality and other clinical and biomarker
parameters of critically ill patients with COVID-19, as compared to controls. We also examined temporal
changes in the inflammatory response of treated patients.

Material and Methods

Patients with COVID-19 disease who met the inclusion criteria and were admitted to the ICU of our
institution between 21st March and 31st May 2020 were recruited. All the patients received standard intensive
medical care, as per institutional clinical protocol which includes hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
Physicians were also able to use corticosteroids according to specific clinical indications (eg. acute respiratory
distress syndrome). In addition, arterial blood gases analysis, complete blood count, CRP, lactic dehydrogenase,
d-dimer, ferritin, and inflammatory biomarkers were collected daily.

Study Design and Patients

This is a single center study. All the patients admitted to the ICU with suspected COVID-19 underwent
diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 through nasopharyngeal swabs. The patients admitted to the ICU also
received respiratory support with either oxygen through a nonrebreather mask or non-invasive or mechanical
ventilation. Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were managed with neuromuscular

blockade and a protective ventilation strategy that included low tidal volume (6 mL/kg of predicted body
weight) and driving pressure (less than 15 cmH2O) as well as optimal PEEP calculated based on the best lung
compliance. In those with moderate to severe ARDS and P/F ratio below 150, despite optimal ventilatory
settings, prone position was initiated.

After IRB approval and availability of tocilizumab, all consecutive adult patients (age > 18 years)
admitted to the ICU with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection plus fever (axillary temperature >
38ºC) or elevated CRP (≥ 5 mg/dL) and ventilatory or oxygenation deterioration or need for ventilatory support
(non-invasive or mechanical ventilation) received two doses of intravenous tocilizumab 400 mg. Patients treated
with tocilizumab were compared to controls admitted to our ICU before tocilizumab availability. Follow-up
continued through June 7th or a minimum of 14 days for all patients.

The study protocol was approved by the National Ethics Committee (4.059.207), who waived the need
for informed consent. The study protocol was registered at the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC)
with the identification RBR-3zdynp.

Exclusion criteria

Patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency, using immunosuppressive drugs, pregnant
women, those without respiratory symptoms and in palliative care.

Main Outcomes

Main outcomes analyzed were intra-hospital mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, positive
cultures and use of antibiotics

Statistical Analysis

Univariate associations were tested by using the chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for categorical
variables, the two-tailed t-test for normally distributed continuous variables, and the Mann–Whitney U test for
non-normally distributed continuous variables. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine if there was
any association of the variables of the study and mortality or positive microbiological sample.

Non-linear logistic regression was used to test the difference between trends and slopes of the curve of
the oxygenation markers (P/F ratio and SpO2/FiO2 ratio) and of inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein

and white blood cells count). The daily progression was assessed from the day of the start of tocilizumab in the
treatment group (index day) through day five, and from the 3rd day after admission on the control group through
day seven - the 3rd day was chosen since it is the median day of the start of tocilizumab in the treatment group.
To make the analysis of the slope more precise, P/F ratio and SpO2/FiO2 ratio were normalized by dividing
each daily value by the index day, which made possible to analyze the actual trend. The significance was set to
0.05 for all analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23.0 (Chicago, IL,
USA) and Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA)

Results

Baseline characteristics

Fifty-three patients were enrolled in the study, twenty-nine in the treatment group and twenty-four in
the control group. The median age was 55 (44-65) years in the tocilizumab group and 58.5 (51-70.8) years in the
control group and most patients were male (62% x 75%, respectively). Corticosteroid use was more frequent in
the treatment group (83% x 37%, p=0.001). The clinical and demographic characteristics on admission are
detailed in Table 1. In-hospital mortality was 17% in both groups.

Outcomes: univariate and multivariable analysis

In the univariate analysis, tocilizumab was not associated with any of the outcomes assessed: mortality,
positive cultures, use of antibiotics or need for renal replacement therapy (Table 2). In the multivariable
analysis, after adjusting for age and mechanical ventilation, use of tocilizumab was not associated with mortality
(OR 3.97, 95% CI 0.28-57.2, p=0.3) or positive cultures (OR 1.73, 95% CI 0.22-13.82, p=0.6) (Table 3). No
adverse events were reported that could be directly related to the administration of tocilizumab.

Daily progression of inflammatory and gas exchange markers

Though not different at baseline, on the index day, the tocilizumab group had both higher inflammatory
response markers (median CRP 20.8 mg/dL x 13.5 mg/dL in the control group, p=0.0005) and lower gas
exchange ratio (165 x 264 in the control group, p=0.000, as seen in Table 4 (daily progression of variables)

The CRP curve slope (Figure 2) is significantly different in the two groups, with a markedly decrease
in the tocilizumab group (p=0.009), as well as the WBC curve slope (p=0.02) (Figure 3). The slope of the rise of

oxygenation, in normalized values, is also significantly different, being higher in the tocilizumab group (p=0.02)
(Figure 1).

Discussion

Although patients in the tocilizumab group were more severely ill, there was no difference neither inhospital mortality nor secondary infections. Furthermore, similarly to other studies (5-9), use of tocilizumab was
associated with a faster improvement of oxygenation (slope of normalized P/F and SpO2/FiO2 Ratio; p = 0.02)
and a decrease of CRP levels (slope of the CRP curve; p = 0.009).

Considering that Tocilizumab and corticosteroid tend to reduce the inflammation and immune
response, and these effects could last for weeks, it is reasonable to expect a higher number of infections in the
tocilizumab group.(6) There was a non-significant increase in the number of positive cultures in the treatment
group (38% vs 17%), although there was no difference either in the use of antibiotics or in clinical changes
suggesting secondary infections such as the increased need for vasoactive amine, worsening of the PaO2/FiO2
ratio, changes in pulmonary secretion (quantity and quality), or signs of inflammation on catheter sites.
Moreover, just one patient (3.4%) developed refractory septic shock and died. These results are similar to an
Italian cohort, which reported two deaths by septic shock (2%) during the 10-day follow-up (7). In this sense,
the number of positive cultures in the intervention group suggests that these patients possibly are more
susceptible only to colonization and not secondary infections, as expected.

Therefore, the improvement in oxygenation and inflammatory markers with no increase of infections
suggests that tocilizumab could be an option as rescue therapy for patients with progressive COVID-19 after
initiation of systemic dexamethasone, as shown in RECOVERY trial (10). Furthermore, the administration of
tocilizumab seems to reduce ICU admission, making, along with dexamethasone, an option of treatment in
selected cases of critically ill patients (8). However, our study has some limitations. Corticosteroid use was not
balanced between groups, limiting the determination of the real benefit in oxygenation and CRP reduction of
tocilizumab in patients who used corticosteroid; the number of patients was limited; it was a single center study,
neither blind nor randomized. Nevertheless, this study generates an interesting hypothesis on the safety of
concomitant use of tocilizumab and corticosteroid in COVID patients. This hypothesis should be evaluated in a
larger clinical trial.

Conclusions

The improvement in oxygenation and inflammatory markers with no increase secondary infections or
intra-hospital mortality suggests that tocilizumab could be an option for patients with progressive COVID-19
after initiation of systemic corticosteroids.
