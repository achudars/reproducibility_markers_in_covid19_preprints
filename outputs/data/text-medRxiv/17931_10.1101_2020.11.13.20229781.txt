Abstract
Age is a major risk factor for severe outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
but it remains unclear if this is rather due to increased chronological age or biological age.
During lifetime, specific DNA methylation changes are acquired in our genome that act as
“epigenetic clocks” allowing to estimate donor age and to provide a surrogate marker for
biological age. In this study, we followed the hypothesis that particularly patients with
accelerated epigenetic age are affected by severe outcomes of COVID-19. Using four
different age predictors, we did not observe accelerated age in global DNA methylation
profiles of blood samples of nine COVID-19 patients. Alternatively, we used targeted
bisulfite amplicon sequencing of three age-associated genomic regions to estimate donorage of blood samples of 95 controls and seventeen COVID-19 patients. The predictions
correlated well with chronological age, while COVID-19 patients even tended to be
predicted younger than expected. Furthermore, lymphocytes in nineteen COVID-19
patients did not reveal significantly accelerated telomere attrition. Our results demonstrate
that these biomarkers of biological age are therefore not suitable to predict a higher risk
for severe COVID-19 infection in elderly patients.

Introduction, Results and Discussion
Coronavirus

disease

2019

(COVID-19)

with

severe

or

even

fatal

outcome

disproportionately affects elderly people (Mueller et al., 2020). The infection fatality rate
(IFR) exponentially increases with age: while the IFR is zero in children it starts to increase
at approximately 55 years (0.4 %) and finally leads to an IFR of 15 % in 85 year old adults
(Levin et al., 2020). Chronological age is thus one of the major risk factors to develop
severe symptoms during an infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this risk is independent of other age-related
comorbidities like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity (Mueller et al., 2020), or the
detection of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) (Hameister et al.,
2020). Recently, it has been suggested that particularly elderly people with accelerated
biological age are susceptible to severe disease outcomes (Kuo et al., 2020).
The process of biological aging is reflected by molecular hallmarks of aging, which include
epigenetic modifications (Lopez-Otin et al., 2013). There are highly reproducible DNA
methylation changes during aging that are acquired at specific CG dinucleotides, so called
“CpG sites”. The DNA methylation levels of several age-associated CpGs can therefore
be combined into “epigenetic clocks” to predict donor age (Bell et al., 2019; Koch and
Wagner, 2011). Notably, various diseases have been associated with accelerated
epigenetic aging and accelerated epigenetic age predictions for blood samples are
indicative for higher all-cause mortality (Marioni et al., 2015). Thus, epigenetic age of blood
does not only reflect chronological age but also aspects of biological age (Field et al.,
2018). We therefore followed the hypothesis that accelerated epigenetic age increases
susceptibility to severe COVID-19 infections (Mueller et al., 2020; Santesmasses et al.,
2020).

In this study, we used blood samples of 20 patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection
either with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; Supplemental Table
S1). All samples were collected at the University Hospital of RWTH Aachen, after written
informed consent, and were provided by RWTH cBMB, the biobank of the Medical Faculty
of RWTH Aachen University. The mean age was 66 years (32 – 85 years) and 13 of the
20 samples suffered from ARDS.
Since DNA methylation profiles of COVID-19 patients have so far hardly been addressed,
the initial nine samples were tested with the Illumina EPIC methylation microarray that
investigates approximately 850,000 CpG sites across the genome as part of a pilot study.
For comparison we utilized publicly available DNA methylation profiles of 185 healthy
blood control samples, which were generated before the first outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A
direct comparison of these studies was hampered by different Illumina BeadChip platforms
(450k and EPIC) and batch effects, which despite quantile normalization become apparent
in principle component analysis (PCA; Supplemental Figure S1). However, despite batch
effects, the results of Illumina BeadChip profiles usually provide relatively robust results
for epigenetic signatures, which are based on multiple CpGs (Han et al., 2020; Horvath,
2013; Lin et al., 2016). For orientation, we initially estimated the cellular composition of
leucocytes based on DNA methylation profiles, as described by Houseman et al. (2012).
We observed significantly lower predictions for CD4 T cells in COVID-19 patients as
compared to controls (p = 0.0024, Welch’s t-test; Supplemental Figure S2A), which is in
line with results of other groups that investigated leukocyte subsets by flow cytometry
(Diao et al., 2020). Furthermore, for our 18 COVID-19 samples with available blood counts
the percentage of lymphocytes was significantly lower than in healthy control samples (p
< 10-08, Welch’s t-test; Supplemental Figure S2B).

We used four different epigenetic age predictors for the Illumina BeadChip profiles: 1) a
frequently used aging signature that has been trained for multiple tissues by Horvath
(2013) with 353 CpGs; 2) a more recent skin and blood clock of Horvath et al. based on
391 relevant CpGs (Horvath et al., 2018); 3) a frequently used aging signature by Hannum
et al. (2013), which was trained on blood samples and utilizes 71 CpGs; and 4) our recently
described age-predictor for blood that was trained on 65 CpGs (Han et al., 2020).
Signatures 1 and 3 comprise CpGs that were not measured by the EPIC BeadChip (19
and 6, respectively), and this might result in a moderate offset of age-predictions.
Nevertheless, with all four signatures the epigenetic age-predictions of the nine COVID19 samples correlated clearly with chronological age (Figure 1A) and there was a mean
absolute error of 6 years, 5 years, 7 years, and 6 years, respectively. Notably, in
comparison to controls the COVID-19 samples did not reveal accelerated epigenetic age:
the difference between epigenetic age predictions and chronological age, referred to as
“delta age”, centered around zero years with the different predictors (Figure 1B).

Figure 1. Epigenetic ageing clocks based on Illumina BeadChip data are not accelerated in COVID-19
patients. A) Genome wide DNA methylation profiles of nine COVID-19 patients (Illumina EPIC array) and 185
healthy controls of publicly available datasets (EPIC or 450k array) were analyzed with four different predictors
of epigenetic age as described by Horvath (2013), Horvath et al. (2018), Hannum et al. (2013) and Han et al.
(2020). B) Boxplots present the deviation of epigenetic age prediction and chronological age (delta age).
Overall, the DNA methylation profiles of the nine COVID-19 samples (indicated in red) did not show consistent
age-acceleration across the different aging signatures.

Subsequently, we tested these and additional COVID-19 samples with a targeted bisulfite
amplicon sequencing (BA-seq) of age-associated regions. We have recently described
BA-seq for nine CpGs that provide robust and reliable age predictions (Han et al., 2020).
To further ease applicability of the method we have meanwhile refined the signature to
focus on the three regions with highest correlation with chronological age and with a
combination of hyper- and hypomethylated CpGs to reduce the PCR bias. The three
relevant CpG sites are associated with the genes Coiled-Coil Domain-Containing Protein
102B (CCDC102B), Four And A Half LIM Domains Protein 2 (FHL2) and
Phosphodiesterase 4C (PDE4C), as described before (Han et al., 2020). We utilized BA6

seq data of 40 healthy blood samples of our previous work to derive the following
multivariable model:
Epigenetic age (years) = -0.34 DNAmCCDC102B + 0.83 DNAmFHL2 + 1.18 DNAmPDE4C + 3.86
We initially validated this method with 78 blood samples of healthy donors (18 – 83 years)
that were collected before the begin of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The epigenetic age
predictions revealed a mean absolute error of 4.23 years and a coefficient of determination
with chronological age of R² = 0.83. Subsequently, we processed blood samples of 17
COVID-19 patients in parallel with 17 age-matched healthy controls (Figure 2A). There
was no evidence for accelerated epigenetic aging in the COVID-19 samples, even if we
stratified into samples with or without ARDS (Figure 2B). There was also no evidence for
accelerated DNA methylation changes when we analyzed the age-associated CpGs
individually (Supplemental Figure S3).
Telomere attrition is another hallmark of aging and correlates with age in peripheral blood
cells (Brümmendorf and Balabanov, 2006). A recent study indicated that in leukocytes of
COVID-19 patients telomere attrition below the 10th percentile is more frequent than in
healthy controls (Froidure et al., 2020), however the results of this study might be affected
by the lymphopenia observed in COVID-19 patients (Benetos et al., 2020). To further
investigate if this alternative biomarker for biological age is accelerated, we analyzed
telomere length in lymphocytes of 19 COVID-19 patients with Flow-FISH, as described in
detail before (Ferreira et al., 2020; Kirschner et al., 2020). In comparison to the telomere
length distribution of 356 healthy controls (Werner et al., 2015) there was overall no
evidence for significant telomere attrition in COVID-19 patients (Figure 2C,D).

Figure 2. Epigenetic age predictions with amplicon sequencing and telomere length analysis in COVID19 patients.
A) Three age-associated CpGs in the genes CCDC102B, FHL2, and PDE4C were analyzed with targeted
bisulfite amplicon sequencing (BA-seq). A multivariable model for epigenetic age-predictions was validated
with 78 controls (grey). Subsequently, we analyzed 17 blood samples of COVID-19 patients with (n = 12, red)
or without ARDS (n = 5, light red) and 17 age-matched controls (blue). B) The deviation of chronological and
predicted epigenetic age (delta-age) is presented (no significant differences; Welch’s t test). C) Telomere
lengths in kilo bases of 19 COVID-19 patients. Lines indicate percentiles of the telomere lengths of 356 healthy
controls. D) The telomere length difference of no ARDS and ARDS patients to the respective age-adapted
telomere length.

Taken together, despite of the limitations of a rather small sample size, our results do not
provide evidence that severe outcome of COVID-19 is associated with accelerated
epigenetic age or significantly shortened telomere length. Thus, we did not observe signs

of premature biological aging in our COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, the infection
with SARS-CoV-2 did not directly impact on epigenetic age-predictions. It has recently
been demonstrated that HIV infection leads to an average aging advancement of 4.9
years, linking molecular aging, epigenetic regulation and disease progression in this
retroviral disease (Gross et al., 2016). Furthermore, coronavirus infections have been
suggested to mediate DNA methylation at antigen-presentation-associated gene
promoters (Menachery et al., 2018). It is still unclear if the different tissues of a human
organism reveal the same pace of epigenetic aging and hence it is conceivable that
nasopharyngeal and bronchial epithelium, which is preferentially infected by SARS-CoV-2,
reveals higher delta-age with epigenetic age-predictions. A recent study suggested that in
airway epithelial cells of healthy controls there is age-associated hypomethylation at a
CpG site (cg08559914) located near the transcription start site of the receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that permits cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 (Corley and Ndhlovu,
2020). Thus, specific age-associated DNA methylations may be functionally relevant to
increase susceptibility to fatal COVID-19. A follow up study with a larger sample size would
be required to ultimately rule out a predictive value of either telomere length or ageassociated methylation changes in defined subpopulations of patients affected by COVID19. Either way, our results demonstrate that age-associated DNA methylation changes
are not generally accelerated in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Analysis of
epigenetic age in blood is therefore not suitable to stratify elderly patients that are
potentially even more susceptible to severe COVID-19 infections.
