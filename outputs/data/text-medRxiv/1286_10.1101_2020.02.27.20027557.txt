Abstract: The human coronavirus HCoV-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome

48

(ARDS), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. Effective

49

antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the

50

overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent

51

dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited

52

potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In

53

analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found

54

that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts

55

and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP

56

treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the

57

hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time

58

of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19

59

infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication,

60

suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. Larger scale clinical trials of DIP

61

are needed to validate these therapeutic effects.

Introduction

66

The novel coronavirus HCoV-19 (also known as SARS-CoV-2) outbreak had emerged from Wuhan,

67

Hubei Province, China in December 2019.1,2 As of February 24, there had been 77,787 confirmed

68

COVID-19 cases including 2,666 deaths in China. Over 2,500 infections have also been reported in

3

69

28 other countries, such as Japan, South Korea, Italy, Singapore, Iran, Thailand, and U.S.A; this

70

rapid spread threatens to become a pandemic. To date, no agents have been reported to be effective

71

against this infection. Identification of readily available drugs for repurpose in COVID-19 therapy

72

avail a relatively rapid way to clinical treatment.3

73
74

HCoV-19, together with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, belong to the Beta-coronovirus genus, which

75

are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with approximately 30,000 nucleotides.4,5 Angiotensin

76

I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor that engages the Spike surface glycoprotein of

77

SARS-CoV and HCoV-19.6,7 ACE2 is expressed in many organs, including the lung, heart, kidney,

78

and intestine. Notably, in experimental models of SARS-CoV infection, Spike protein engagement

79

decreases ACE2 expression and activates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).6 RAS activation

80

promotes platelet adhesion and aggregation and increases the risk for pulmonary embolism,

81

hypertension and fibrosis.8-11 It also accelerates cardiac and kidney injury by increasing local

82

angiotensin II concentrations.12-14 Apart from affecting the classic RAS pathway, ACE2 deficiency in

83

the intestine is associated with malnutrition and colonic inflammation.15

84
85

Infection from SARS-CoV can result in severe lymphopenia, prolonged coagulation profiles, lethal

86

acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), watery diarrhea, cardiac disease and sudden death.9,16-18

87

Many of these features have also been reported for COVID-19: prolonged coagulation profiles,

88

elevated D-dimer levels, severe lymphopenia, ARDS, hypertension, and acute heart injury in

89

ICU-admitted patients.2,19 Given that angiotensin II levels were highly elevated in the HCoV-19

90

infected patients,

91

anti-coagulation therapy should be considered for mollifying the multi-organ damage during severe

92

COVID-19.

20

RAS was likely activated in HCoV-19 infected patients, Thus, prophylactic

94

After viral entry to the host cells, the coronavirus messenger RNA is first translated to yield the

95

polyproteins, which are subsequently cleaved by two viral proteinases, 3C-like protease (3CLP, aka

96

nsp5 or Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLP, or nsp3), to yield non-structural proteins essential for

97

viral replication.21 Inhibitors that suppress the activity of these proteases may inhibit viral replication

98

and offer a revenue for the HCoV-19 therapy.

99
100

Dipyridamole (DIP) is an antiplatelet agent and acts as a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor that

101

increases intracellular cAMP/cGMP.22 Apart from the well-known antiplatelet function, DIP may

102

provide additional therapeutic benefits to COVID-19 patients. First, published studies,23-28 including

103

clinical trials conducted in China,29-31 have demonstrated that DIP has a broad spectrum antiviral

104

activity, particularly efficacious against the positive-stranded RNA viruses.24 Second, it suppresses

105

inflammation and promotes mucosal healing.

106

acute injury and progressive fibrosis of the lung, heart, liver, and kidney. 33 Here we provide three

107

levels of evidence advocating DIP as a therapy. In silico and in vitro, we demonstrated that DIP

108

possessed anti- HCoV-19 effects. In a VSV-induced pneumonia model, we also confirmed that DIP

109

elicited potent antiviral immunity and significantly improved the survival rate. In a small clinical

110

cohort, we found that DIP adjunctive therapy led to increased circulating lymphocyte and platelet

111

counts and lowered D-dimer levels, and markedly improved clinical outcomes.

32

Third, as a pan-PDE inhibitor, DIP may prevent

Methods

114

Free energy perturbation and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay

115

We virtually screened an FDA-approved drug database using the HCoV-19 protease Mpro as a target

116

and validated the binding affinity by the SPR assay. DIP (PubChem CID: 3108, Figure S1) was

117

identified as a lead drug. In order to obtain the binding pattern and calculate the binding free energy

between DIP and Mpro, DIP was firstly docked onto Mpro by using Glide, and the optimal binding

119

pose was further assessed by absolute binding free energy calculation with free energy perturbation.

120

121

was similar to that used by Matteo et al.35 In the calculation, the ligand electrostatic and van der

122

Waals interactions were decoupled using a linear alchemical pathway with Δλ = 0.10 for the van der

123

Waals and Δλ = 0.20 for electrostatic interactions. To add the restraints, 12 λ values were used.

124

Therefore, a total of 28 windows for complex and 16 windows for ligand systems were employed,

125

and 4 ns simulations were performed for each window. The relative position restraints consist of one

126

distance, two angles, and three dihedrals harmonic potentials with a force constant of 10 kcal/mol/Å2

127

[rad2]. The distance and angles for the restraints were determined by the values of the last 2 ns of the

128

4 ns preliminary MD simulations. The sampled ΔU in the simulations were fitted by Gaussian

129

algorithms and the free energy estimates were obtained by using the Bennet acceptance ratio (BAR)

130

method.36

The calculations were carried out in Gromacs 2019, and the thermodynamic cycle and procedure

134

chromatography and cleaved with FXa. The purity of recombinant protein was greater than 95% as

135

judged by SDS–PAGE. The binding of DIP to Mpro was measured by the Biacore 8K system (GE

142

over the immobilized Mpro at the flow rate of 30 µL/min and the contact time was set to be 200 s. A

143

Fluorescent focus assay

148

Vero E6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with different dosages of dipyridamole or

149

chloroquine for an hour before infected with HCoV-19. After 24 hours of incubation, cells were

150

fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD), incubated with a rabbit anti-HCoV-19

151

nucleocapsid protein polyclonal antibody (Sino Biological), followed by a HRP-labelled goat

152

anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson). The foci were visualized by TRUEBlue reagent. Foci in

Patients and study variables

186

As of February 8, 2020, 124 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been identified from Zhongnan

187

Hospital of Wuhan University (Table S1). All patients met the diagnostic criteria of "Diagnosis and

188

Treatment Scheme of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia (trial 6th)" formulated by the General

189

Office of National Health Committee.37 A retrospective review of the medical records of these

190

patients was conducted to retrieve coagulation indexes and platelet parameters, including

191

prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), plasma fibrinogen (FIB),

192

D-dimer, platelet (PLT) count, and mean platelet volume (MPV). Systemic inflammation was

193

assessed according to the C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin 6 (IL-6)

194

levels.12

Study design

197

Patients were enrolled from the isolation ward in Dawu County People's Hospital, a medical

198

treatment alliance of Zhongnan Hospital, Hubei province in China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 22,

199

2020 to determine the effect of DIP to improve the coagulation profile. The condition of the patients

200

was monitored daily by attending physicians. Routine laboratory test of the coagulation variables,

201

blood indexes, liver and kidney function indices, and chest CT were carried out before, during, and

202

after the treatment. Clinical symptoms and laboratory data were independently validated by two

203

independent investigators for assurance of data accuracy. The diagnosis of severe case was made if

204

patients met any of the following criteria: (1) respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min; (2) SpO2 ≤ 93%

205

while breathing room air; (3) PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg. A critically ill case was diagnosed if any of

Results

DIP suppresses HCoV-19 replication in Vero E6 cells

230

We virtually screened an FDA approved drug library and found that DIP bound to the HCoV-19

231

protease Mpro (Figure S1). Hydrophobic and hydrogen bond (H-bond) interactions are the main

232

driving forces for the binding between DIP and Mpro. According to the free energy perturbation

233

calculation, the binding free energy of Gpred was -6.34 kcal/mol. An SPR assay was carried out to

234

validate the in silico result. This has revealed that DIP bound to Mpro with an experimentally

235

confirmed affinity of 34 µM (KD,eq) (Figure 1A-B).

236
237

To demonstrate directly that DIP suppresses HCoV-19 replication, we measured the viral titers using

238

a susceptible cell line, the Vero E6 cells. Chloroquine was used as a positive control. 38,39 Remarkably,

239

at 0.1 M DIP suppressed more than 50% of HCoV-19 replication (Figure 1C). Human DIP

240

administration can achieve a 3 µM serum concentration.40 Thus, therapeutic dosages of DIP may

241

effectively suppress HCoV-19 replication in the infected patients. Notably, however, the

242

dose-dependent suppressive effect of dipyridamole was less apparent in comparison to Chloroquine,

243

which suggested that DIP may employ a different mode of suppression.

244
245

DIP promotes type I interferon (IFN) responses and protect mice from viral pneumonia

246

Published studies have shown that DIP possessed broad spectrum activity to a wide range of viruses,

247

indicating that it may elicit antiviral immunity from the host cells. We examined these using two

248

single-stranded RNA viruses (Sendai virus, SeV and Vesicular stomatitis virus, VSV), as well as

249

intracellular poly (I:C) that stimulates the RIG-I and MDA5 mediated IFN immunity, in the human

250

lung epithelial cell line A549 cells.41,42 Our results demonstrated that DIP (5 μM) treatment

251

significantly increased IFNB, IFIT1, and ISG15 messenger RNA expression and promoted IFN-

252

secretion (Figure 2A) by increasing TBK1 and IRF3 phosphorylation (Figure 2B).

253
254

To validate the antiviral effects of DIP in vivo, we established a VSV-induced pneumonia model. DIP

255

administration significantly prolonged the survival rate of VSV-infected mice (Figure 2C), and

256

substantially alleviated pulmonary pathology (Figure 2D). Thus, therapeutic doses of DIP can elicit

257

potent and broad-spectrum antiviral immunity to single-stranded RNA viruses.

258
259

A remarkable improvement of coagulation profile in COVID-19 patients receiving DIP

260

adjunctive therapy

261

To assess the coagulation profile, we first retrospectively analyzed a randomly collected cohort of

262

124 COVID-19 patients (Table S1). Decreased platelet counts were observed in 25 (20.2%) patients,

263

prolonged prothrombin time (PT) was observed in 77 (62.1%) patients, fibrinogen (FIB) levels were

264

increased in 27 (21.8%) patients, and D-dimer levels were increased in 26 (21.0%) patients. This

265

suggest that hypercoagulability is common in COVID-19 patients.

266
267

To evaluate DIP as a therapy to reduce the risk of hypercoagulability, 22 additional patients including

268

10 control patients and 12 patients who received DIP were recruited. Baseline characteristics of the

269

two groups were similar (Table 1). The average ages of the patients were 53 and 58 years in the DIP

270

group and the control group, respectively. All patients manifested cough and most of them felt

271

shortness of breath, and 60.0% patients had nausea and vomiting. Chest CT scan revealed bilateral

272

pneumonia in all patients. Comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and

273

cerebrovascular diseases, were found in 4 and 5 of the patients from the DIP and control group,

274

respectively. All patients received ribavirin, glucocorticoids, and oxygen therapy, but none received

275

antifungal treatment. Other treatment included mechanical ventilation (16.7% vs 10.0%), antibiotics

276

(33.3% vs 30.0%), and intravenous immunoglobulin (16.7% vs 20.0%) in the DIP group and the

277

control group, respectively.

278
279

Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (50%) and all 4 of the mild cases

280

(100%) were discharged from the hospital. One of the critically ill patient with extremely high levels

281

of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in

282

clinical remission. In comparison, the discharge and remission rates of the mild and severe cases

283

were inferior in the control patients (Table 2).

284
285

The baseline temperature was higher and the oxygenation status was worse in the DIP-treated group

286

than those in the control group, however, temperature and oxygenation were stabilized in the mild

287

and severe patients from both groups after one day of treatment (Figure S2). Furthermore, we

288

observed a continuously increased trend in lymphocyte counts and significantly increased platelet

289

numbers in patients receiving DIP treatment in comparison to the control group (Figure 3A). Given

290

that lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia are common in the severe and critically ill patients,

291

immune recovery may contribute to infection resolution in DIP-treated patients. It should be noted

292

that 4 patients from the DIP-treatment group and 2 patients from the control group had increased

293

baseline levels of D-dimer when they were admitted to the hospital (Table 1). We measured dynamic

294

changes in reference to the respective baseline levels for all patients, and found that the levels of

295

D-dimer continuously rose in the control group, whereas they were decreased and stabilized in the

296

DIP-treated group (Figure 3A, Figure S2).

297
298

We then examined the two critically ill patients who received DIP adjunctive therapy. A 70-year-old

299

man with very low oxygen saturation and has suffered from hypoxia and multiorgan dysfunction at

300

hospital administration has passed away. He had extremely high levels of D-dimer (16.2 mg/L) and

301

very low lymphocyte count (0.37X109/L) at the time of receiving DIP adjunctive therapy. His

302

oxygen saturation remained low and has unfortunately passed away 5 days since initiation of DIP

303

treatment. In contrast, the other severely ill patient also had very low oxygen saturation and high

304

D-dimer level (8.83 mg/L) at administration. His D-dimer level had gone up to as high as 15.72

305

mg/L, but gradually declined to 3.69 mg/L following DIP adjunctive therapy. The patient has since

306

been in clinical remission. This reinforces that high levels of D-dimer and low lymphocyte counts are

307

associated with poor prognosis and suggest that that DIP treatment should be initiated before the

308

progression to critical illness (Figure 3B).

309
310

All patients had chest CT scans and showed typical multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in the

311

lungs before the treatment. In the DIP treated patients, the lesions had varied degree of absorption.

312

Typical findings following DIP treatment was illustrated in one of the severe COVID-19 patient who

313

had taken sequential CT scans (Figure 4).

Discussion

317

Despite the enormous threat of HCoV-19, no drugs have been claimed to be effective including the

318

existing drugs used to treat other viruses. In reference to SARS-CoV- infection, we hypothesized that

319

the HCoV-19 Spike protein engagement may activate RAS in the lung.6,43 This hypothesis was

320

supported by published clinical characteristics and biochemical indices of the severe and critically ill

321

COVID-19 patients, who showed ARDS, hypertension, acute heart, kidney injury, and positive

322

D-dimer results.2,19,20 In searching for available anticoagulants, we focused on DIP because of its

323

broad-spectrum antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects. We confirmed that DIP

324

possessed potent antiviral immunity to single-stranded RNA viruses in vitro, and in a VSV-induced

325

viral pneumonia model in vivo. Most importantly, a laboratory confirmed EC50 of 0.1 M to

326

suppress HCoV-19 replication highly suggested that the therapeutic dosage of DIP may potentiate

327

effective antiviral responses in infected patients . These findings are in concordance with the overall

328

remarkable outcomes in patients receiving one week of DIP adjunctive therapy, seven of the twelve

329

patients were discharged from the hospital and four achieved clinical remission.

330
331

We found that DIP adjunctive treatment was effective in preventing hypercoagulability if applied

332

early in the severe COVID-19 patients. DIP treatment blunted the increase in D-dimer levels and

333

increased circulating platelet and leucocytes counts, and thus was associated with overall remarkable

334

clinical cure and remission rates. High levels of D-dimer closely correlated with pulmonary

335

embolism,44 vascular thrombosis, and renal dysfunction.45 It is an important prognostic factor of

336

whether ICU-patients may recover from severe infections.46,47 As such, the antiviral,

337

anti-inflammatory, and anti-hypercoagulability effects of DIP could reduce the risk of micro-vascular

338

thrombosis in HCoV-19 infected patients. This could in turn improve vascular circulation and restore

339

vital functions of important organs such as heart and kidney.

340
341

In summary, we suggest anti-coagulant therapy for COVID-19 patients with early signs of elevated

342

D-dimer levels. DIP is an attractive anti-coagulant adjunctive therapy due to its safe clinical profile

343

as an anti-platelet agent. It also holds additional benefits as a pan-PDE inhibitor in eliciting

344

broad-spectrum antiviral immunity, as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. Moreover,

345

the wide availability, safety and affordability of DIP argue for further investigation into its

346

therapeutic use in COVID-19, particularly in the event of its rapid spread into the developing

347

counties.

sensorgram from Biacore 8K between dipyridamole (DIP) and Mpro, color points overlaid with a 1:1

495

Langmuir binding model kinetic fit (black). (A) Relative response from injection of DIP at 5, 10, 20,

496

40, 80, and 100 μM. Global analysis of the shape of the response curves yielded the parameters of

497

on-rate (Kon = 3.20E+3), off-rate (Koff = 2.19E-1) and the ratio of Koff divided by Kon (KD = 68 µM).

498

（B）Equilibrium binding responses plotted versus DIP concentration and fitted to a simple binding

499

isotherm to yield an affinity of 34 µM (KD,eq). (C) Suppressive effects of DIP and chloroquine on

500

HCoV-19 replication. P values were calculated by Student’s t test.
