ABSTRACT
COVID-19 is now widely spreading around the world as a global pandemic. In this
report, we estimated the global tendency of COVID-19 and analyzed the associated
global epidemic risk, given that the status quo is continued without further measures
being taken.
Based on official data of confirmed and recovered cases until May 21, 2020, the
results showed that the global ùëÖ0 , excluding China, was estimated to be 2.76 (95% CI:
2.57 ‚Äì 2.95). The United States, Germany, Italy, and Spain have peak values over
100,000. Using dynamical model and cluster analysis, we partition the globe into four
regional epicenters of the outbreak: Southeast Asia extending southward to Oceania,
the Middle East, Western Europe, and North America. Among them, Western Europe
would become the major center of the outbreak. The peak values in Germany, Italy, and
Spain were estimated to be 228,000, 291,000, and 298,000, respectively. Based on the
current control measures by May 21, 2020, the peak value in the United States will
reach 2,114,000. The cumulative number of 51 mainly researched countries' patients
might finally attain 6,542,000 (95% CI: 4,772,000 ‚Äì 40,735,000). We also estimated
the diagnosis rate, recovery rate , and infection degree of each country or region, and
used clustering algorithm to retrieve countries or regions with similar epidemic
characteristics. Several suggestions have been proposed for countries or regions in
different clusters.

1. INTRODUCTION
On Dec. 8, 2019, the first case of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) was
confirmed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, caused by a new type of coronavirus
named '2019 new coronavirus [1] (SARS-CoV-19)' [2]. The disease spread across
China during the traditional Chinese Spring Festival. At 24:00 on March 14, China had
passed the peak of the epidemic, and started to recover gradually, with a total of 80,844
confirmed cases reported [3]. However, new cases of disease began to appear in other
parts of the world and increased rapidly. Because of the rapid spread of the disease, the
World Heath Organization (WHO) has assessed COVID-19 as a pandemic [4], which
is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. As of March 14, 2020, the cases of
COVID-19 have been reported in 135 countries and regions worldwide, with a total of
142,539 confirmed cases (61,518 outside of China) and 5,393 deaths (2,199 outside of
China) [5]. Among them, a total of 17,660 cases were confirmed in Italy, 11,364 in Iran,
8,086 in the Republic of Korea, 1,678 in the United States. Furthermore, Europe
became the epicenter of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the
rest of the world combined, apart from China [6].
With the outbreak of COVID-19, countries or regions have been taking different
measures to cope with the spread of the pandemic, but the number of infected people is
still increasing. Meanwhile, the spread of the pandemic has also caused a huge impact
on the trade flows and economic affairs of the world. These situations raised many
urgent problems. How will this epidemics spread in countries or regions around the
world? When will the spread of epidemic arrive at the peak or turn to stabilize? How
many people will be at risk of infection? Therefore, it is of great significance to analyze
the trend of COVID-19 and predict the arrival of peaks for the prevention and control
of the pandemic all over the world .
Based on global data [7], we perform an analysis of epidemic status in 51 countries,
which had the number of confirmed cases over 100 in Mar. 27, 2020. Section 2 of this
paper briefly discusses the most up-to-date literature related to the COVID-19 epidemic
status. Section 3 describes the transmission dynamics model in detail. Section 4
presents the simulation and analysis of the estimated trend. Section 5 analyzes the four
epidemic transmission clusters with different characteristics and give error analysis for
confirming the rationality of the results. Finally, the conclusion and discussion are
respectively presented in Sections 6 and 7.
2. RELATED WORK
With the further spread of the epidemic, many scholars analyzed the characteristics
of covid-19. On March 1, 2020, Li Y et al [8], used the outside-China diagnosis number
released by the WHO and built a mathematical model to capture the global trend of
epidemics outside China. They found that 34 patients outside China were not found.
The worldwide epidemic trend is approximately exponential, and may grow 10 folds
every 19 days. Zhuang Z et al [9], used a stochastic model to simulate the transmission
process of South Korea and Italy under two corresponding assumptions of exponential
growth periods. The results indicated that the reproductive number of South Korea and
Italy were 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3-2.9) and 3.3 (95% CI: 3.0-3.6), respectively. On March 17,

Darwin R et al [10], used the progression of the epidemic curve and defined frame work
to estimate the instantaneous reproductive number. They divided the epidemic into
different serial interval scenarios, and estimated the R values, average number of
secondary transmissions per patient. The R value in Japan, Germany, Spain, Kuwait,
and France are over 2; in Italy, Iran, and South Korea are even over 10, however, the R
will be low after the social distancing intervention.
The correlation analysis of COVID-19's various factors is also an important topic.
Cody Carroll, Satarupa Bhattacharjee, Yaqing Chen, et al [11] established a framework
for quantifying and comparing cases and deaths across countries longitudinally. They
found that decreased workplace mobility is associated with lower doubling rates with a
roughly two week delay, and case fatality rates exhibit a positive feedback pattern.
Alessio Notari, Giorgio Torrieri [12] analyzed risk factors correlated with the initial
transmission growth rate of the recent COVID-19 pandemic in different countries on
May 8, 2020 and found moderate evidence for positive correlation with: CO2 (and SO)
emissions (p-value 0.015), type-1 diabetes in children (p-value 0.023), vaccination
coverage for Tuberculosis (BCG) (p-value 0.028).
In addition, many scholars have also discussed different models. Andrey
Gerasimov, Georgy Lebedev, Mikhail Lebedev and Irina Semenycheva proposed a
heterogeneous model [13] on May 7, 2020 to assess the effects of different measures
for infection risk control. They found that after this heterogeneity is incorporated in the
model, several characteristics of the epidemic are estimated more accurately. For higher
accuracy, Sina F. Ardabili, Amir Mosavi, Pedram Ghamisi, et al [14] used multi-layered
perceptron and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system to analyze COVID-19,
which got better results than traditional methods. On May 1, 2020, Kevin L et al [15]
proposed a dynamic SEIR epidemiology model with a time-varying reproduction
number, which they identify using machine learning and uncertainty quantification.
This new dynamic SEIR model provides the flexibility to simulate various outbreak
control and exit strategies to inform political decision making and identify safe
solutions in the benefit of global health.
The prediction of pandemic was also a hot spot. Zhang Z et al [16] estimated that
the peaks of infectious cases in South Korea, Italy, and Iran are expected to occur at the
end of March, and the percentages of population infections will less than 0.01%, 0.05%,
and 0.02%, respectively. On March 10, 2020, Zhang Z et al [17] estimated that the
inflection point arrival time will be March 6-12 for South Korea, March 10-24 for Italy
and March 10-24 for Iran, and the cumulative number of cases will reach 20k in South
Korea, 209k in Italy and 226k in Iran, respectively. Li L et al [18] thought that the
epidemic in South Korea will be basically under control at the end of March, and the
inflection day is January 7, before the control the reproductive number is 4.2, and 0.1
after the control. Epidemic size in Italy and Iran will reach 200,000 and 20,000,
respectively at the end of March. On May 8, 2020, Athanasios S et al [19], found that
the rate of deaths reaches a maximum, their models provide estimates for the time that
a plateau will be reached signifying that the epidemic is approaching its end, as well as
for the cumulative number of deaths at that time. The plateau is defined to occur when
the rate of deaths is 5% of the maximum rate.

In our previous work [20], we predicted the time and value of the inflection point
and peak point in both Hubei and outside Hubei of China. Inspired by it, we conducted
a worldwide prediction of the value of the peak point and analyzed the main
characteristics and appearances of COVID-19 in the world. The predicted results are
based on the current medical situation, if there is specific medicine for COVID-19 in
the future, the time and value of peak point of all countries will be advanced and
shrinking compared with non-medicine situations.
3. COVID-19 TRANSMISSION MODEL: TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS
3.1. Transmission Dynamics Model
We constructed a transmission dynamics model to infer the epidemiological
characteristics and the peak size and trend of COVID-19 based on the existing
infectious data and recovered data about various countries or regions. The population
of this paper are divided into four main categories based on the SEIR model, i.e. S, E,
I, and R referring to [21]: the Susceptibles, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered,
respectively [22][23]. In the study of China's epidemic situation, many factors such as
Spring Festival and control policies and so on are taken into account, but in contrast,
this paper will analyze the heterogeneity of each country or region on the basis of the
common spread of infectious diseases. Although these countries have different policies
and customs, their basic spread pattern of the epidemic still meets the principle of
dynamics [24]. S, the susceptibles, is equal to the total population (N in equation (3.1))
in the research of COVID-19 due to the general susceptibility of the population. The
main assumptions of this model are as follows:
(1) Because the difference in infectivity between the exposed and the infectious
population is unknown, both groups of E and I are set to follow the same coefficient
Œ≤ to represent the average infection level of COVID-19.
(2) In the predicted time scale, the existing influences of policies or culture of the target
object will be unchanged.
(3) During the transmission of virus, the probability of infection in contact with each
person is equal in the same target group.

the state transition diagram in Figure 1. The direction of the arrow in Figure 1 represents
the transition relationships between different states with time. All parameters and
physical interpretations of the model are shown in Table 1.
3.2 Practical Consideration
We divided the spread of the COVID-19 into three phases according to the
evolution of the size of the confirmed cases, and the schematic diagram of each stage
for the number of patients is shown in Figure 2.
Phase one: the time range of this phase starts from the beginning of COVID-19
transmission and ends when the number of patients begins to increase significantly.
COVID-19 spreads during the incubation period at this phase, but the confirmed cases
officially counted remain at a low level, and the public's awareness of defense is light.
Phase two: the main feature is that a large number of patients have been diagnosed,
and the statistical data of confirmed cases increase significantly. But there still has no
policy intervention and large-scale quarantine measures.
Phase three: As the intensity of policy intervention increases, the spread of COVID19 is effectively suppressed, and growth rate of confirmed cases is gradually controlled
until the end of the epidemic. The main feature of this phase is strong human
intervention.

It is crucial to get as much information as possible from the data in three stages.
Because this paper aims at the analysis of the peak size and its arrival time in each
country or region, two latter transmission phases will be our focus in this paper.
In phase two, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly. The infection rate remains at a high
level, and the recovery level is low because the government had not carried out
obviously effective policy control. From phase three, the infection rate decreases and
the recovery rate begins to increase. Through the study of reported data of COVID-19
in China, we used the power law to simulate the trend of infection rate and recovery
rate in phase three, as shown in equation (3.2). Since the coefficient c plays a role in
inhibiting the growth of the number of confirmed cases, we define c as the incremental
inhibition ratio.

{
(3.2)
ùõæ(ùë°) = ùõæ0 (1 + ùëê)ùë°
where ùõΩ0 and ùõæ0 are the initial values of Œ≤ and Œ≥, and t is time from the beginning
of phase three.
3.3. Estimation of ùëπùüé
The basic reproduction number, ùëÖ0 , refers to the average value of how many
people an infected person can transmit the virus through natural transmission without
external intervention [25]. From the second generator approach in [26], the equation (3.3)
is derived as follows:
1

ùëÖ0 = ùõΩ (ùõº+ùõæ )
1

(3.3)

where ùõº , ùõΩ , and ùõæ1 are the transfer variables of the SEIR model. (1/ ùõº + ùõæ1 )
represents duration of virus transmission. Considering that the calculation of ùëÖ0 is in
the case of natural transmission, so we use the parameters of the starting time of
epidemic spread in each country or region to estimate ùëÖ0 to avoid the impact of human
intervention.
3.4. Data Source
In this study, we used open dataset from Johns Hopkins University
(https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The details of the data source are shown

for academic and scientific research. We have compiled their open data into a
chronology of confirmed data for prediction and visualization use.
4. MAIN RESULTS OF THE SEIR MODEL
4.1. Estimate of ùëπùüé
While estimating the ùëÖ0 of the epidemic globally, we ignore the countries whose
ultimate cumulative number of confirmed cases are less than 5000 by May 21, 2020
and focus on the remaining 51 countries (please refer to appendix). Parameters were
estimated by minimizing the least square loss function of the estimated number of
confirmed cases and the observed number of confirmed cases. The average basic
reproduction number of these countries was 2.76 (95% CI: 2.57 ‚Äì 2.95). As we can
notice, COVID-19 is lashing a great part of the world, and the sufferings are not likely
to end soon. By estimating the average value of ùëÖ0 , we obtain the objective information
of current situations as well as the importance of epidemic prevention.
Among these 51 mainly researched countries, the R0 of Switzerland, Austria, China
and Brazil are higher than 3.5, suggesting the great potential of a destructive outburst.
France is one of these countries with a basic reproduction number of 3.61, much higher
than the global average(See Appendix 2 for more details). The number of the United
States is 2.59, which is slightly below the global average, revealing the urgency of the
current outbreak in the United States. The lowest value of R0 is 1.77 in Korea, still
greater than 1.

exceeding 100 by May 21, 2020. Blue means the higher the value of ùëÖ0 , while white means the
lower the the value of ùëÖ0 .

4.2. Estimate of the Peak of Confirmed Cases in Country-Level
The peak value is defined as the cumulative number of confirmed cases. After this
peak point, the temporary number of cases gradually decrease or slightly fluctuate, and
the epidemic subsides [20]. The estimated trends of 51 countries are all listed in
Appendix 2 for details.
Thirteen countries will have a peak value over 100,000, including the United States,
Russian Federation, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Turkey,
Iran, India, Peru and Canada. And 34 of the 51 countries including Belgium, Saudi
Arabia, Mexico will have peak values between 10,000 and 100,000.
We also compared peak arrival time in countries whose peak values are higher than
10,000, and find that most of the countries will reach their peak value in June. The
United States is the country with the highest exposure to the COVID-19 risk of the
coronavirus. According to our estimation, the peak number of real-time confirmed cases
of the United States is predicted to reach 2,114,000 after June 18, 2020, provided the
present coping strategy is not changed. It is the only country in our prediction that the
number of confirmed cases will exceed 2,000,000.

Spain, Italy, and Germany monopolize one category, out of all 51 countries, due to
its high risk of coronavirus. The peak number of real-time confirmed cases of Italy,
Spain are respectively predicted to reach 291,000, and 298,000. The trend of COVID19 in Italy is expanding, though efforts had been taken by the government of Italy. The
other countries whose peak values are estimated to reach over 50,000, such as the
Bangladesh, Pakistan, Netherlands, Chile, etc., are all in severe situation at present.
4.3. Geographical Distribution Analysis of the COVID-19
The estimated final epidemic scale is visualized on the world map to show the
geographical characteristics of the predicted epidemic peak of confirmed cases. The
cumulative number of 51 countries' patients might finally attain 6,542,000 (95% CI:
4,772,000 ‚Äì 40,735,000). According to [27], geographic proximity transmission is very
prominent in epidemic transmission, which means that the regional transmission is
popular. This opinion can also be confirmed on the map shown in Figure 5. The
outbreak shows multiple epicenters. It can be found that North Korea is geographically
close to South Korea, Japan, and China, which has the worst situation.
The choropleth map indicates that the spread of COVID-19 will form four major
regional clusters. The first epicenter ranges from East Asia to Oceania, including China,
South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia, etc. Norway, Australia,
Malaysia, Finland will have peak values over 7,000.

Figure 5. The peak value of confirmed cases in 51 countries or regions over the world, which has
the number of confirmed cases exceeding 5000 by May 21, 2020. Red means the higher the
diagnosis cases peak, while white means the lower the diagnosis cases peak.

The second outbreak epicenter occurs in Western Europe, including Spain, Italy,
The United Kingdom, France, Germany, and many other neighboring countries, as well
as Turkey. Belgium, Switzerland, Netherlands, Ireland are all expected to have peak
values of over 30,000. Considering the number and density of European countries, there
would be a serious cross-border phenomenon. Under the current transmission
environment and control measures as of May 21, 2020, the estimated number of patients
is likely to be at least 2,984,000, with 740 million population in Europe.
The third epicenter was in the Middle East. According to the current trend, the peak
number of confirmed cases in Iran will reach to 104,000. According to the current trend,
the epidemic situation in Iran has gradually slowed down. In addition, the peak value
of Saudi Arabia is estimated to be over 25,000. Estimated by the current situation, the
peak of diagnosis in the Middle East will come in early May this year.
The last epicenter occurred in North America. Given that the epidemic has spread
in the United States (1,634,000 cases in total, as of May 21, 2020), if the current
situation is maintained, the peak number of cases in the United States will reach
2,114,000, which may have a huge impact on American people's livelihood and social
economy. If the United States follows the existing policy as of May. 21, 2020, the peak
arrival time of COVID-19 in the United States will be after Jun. 18, 2020. In addition,
Canada is expected to have a peak value of 106,000, making it the second most affected
country in North America.

4.4. Error Analysis of Proposed Model

Figure 6. The comparison between the predicted cumulative diagnosis data of 6 countries, including
Arabia, Russia and Qatar, and the data reported by the government. The data before April 25, 2020
is used for model training, and the data in the next seven days are predicted.

In this section, the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) was used to test
the accuracy of prediction level of the model. We used the confirmed data as of April
25, 2020 to estimate the data for the following week. The error between predicted value
ùë¶ÃÇ and real value y is calculated according to the equation (4.1):
1

ùëÅùëÖùëÄùëÜùê∏ = ‚àöùëá ‚àëùëáùë°=1 (

ùë¶ÃÇùë° ‚àíùë¶ùë° 2
ùë¶ùë°

)

(4.1)

Figure 6 shows the visual display of the error. From a quantitative perspective, the
nrmse of the target country or region is 12.85% on average when t = 7. The minimum
is 0.42%, while the maximum is 36.97%. And the average error will increase with the
increase of prediction time, which is mainly because the longer the time is, the less
relevant information is needed for prediction, the more difficult it is, and the higher the
cumulative error is.

5. CLUSTER ANALYSIS OF EPIDEMIC CHRACTERISTICS
To further analyze the characteristics of epidemic transmission among different
countries or regions, we took the five parameters, i.e. ùõº, ùõΩ, ùõæ1, ùõæ2, ùëê, of the SEIR
model obtained in the simulation as feature vectors. Then, the BIRCH (Balanced
Iterative Reduction and Clustering Using Hierarchies) algorithm was used to perform
clustering based on these feature vectors to retrieve countries or regions with similar
epidemic patterns, see Figure 8, and Appendix 3. The average of parameters in each
cluster is shown in Table 4. To visualize the proximity relationship of the epidemic
characteristics of these countries or regions, t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding) algorithm is used to reduce the dimension of data to a 2-dimensional
plannar, while preserving sample proximity in the 5-dimentional parameter space, see

Figure 8.
The number of clustering countries or regions indicates the universality or
particularity of the epidemic pattern reflected by the cluster. Cluster one is represented
by the United States, Italy, Spain, Germany, etc. Their ùõΩÃÖ are of the highest level, 1.59.
However, ùõæÃÖ1 was the lowest at 0.65% , which shows that the epidemic situation in
such countries or regions is the most serious, but has not yet got an effective recovery
level. It is necessary to remind them to take timely prevention and control measures for
the flow of people and invest in medical treatment, otherwise, the epidemic will be
likely to further spread.
Cluster two contains only three countries: China, Austria, and Switzerland.
Because of the high ùõΩÃÖ , their epidemic spread quickly. But the three countries are
excellent at diagnosing and treating patients. ùõæÃÖ1 and ùõæÃÖ2 are the highest at 1.14% and
1.16% respectively, which makes their epidemic situation be better suppressed. For
example, intervention measures such as traffic blockade and quarantine taken in time
at the beginning of the outbreak in China are very effective and have successfully
restrained the further growth of confirmed cases. This is also recommended for other
countries to learn from.
Cluster three accounts for 59% of the total number of studies, and had the lowest
risk among the four clusters. ùõΩÃÖ =1.43 indicates the lowest level of virus transmission,
while ùõæÃÖ1=1.03% and ùëêÃÖ=5.5% are both higher than the average. Their epidemic spread
is very light, and is more easily suppressed. The diagnosis rate, ùõΩÃÖ =0.54, is the most
close to the overall average. This includes Australia, Japan, and Belgium, etc.
Cluster four has only one country, South Korea. The diagnosis rate, ùõºÃÖ=0.81, is the
highest, which indicates the high demand for diagnosis level. Other parameters were
basically very close to the overall average, although the transmission degree is on
average, in order to prevent the further spread of COVID-19, the policy of intervention
and medical treatment for the confirmed cases still needs to be improved.
It should be noted that clustering is only used to help us find out similar epidemic
patterns. It is not that any country or region is fixed as the description of the above four
clusters. Figure 8 shows that some countries are at the edge of clustering. The cluster
assignments of these countries might be sensitive to the estimated SEIR parameters. We
have reason to believe that Peru located at the edge of Cluster Two and Cluster Three
also have good epidemic control status. Canada, Ireland, Netherlands, and other
countries in cluster three are very close to the first cluster, which indicates the
possibility of further outbreaks of COVID-19.
The high risk areas of the outbreak are concentrated in the Americas, Europe, and
the Middle East (cluster one). The severity of the epidemic in South Africa is very
prominent on the geographical map. On the one hand, we once again call for timely
treatment and isolation measures, on the other hand, it is necessary to remind Southern
African countries of the prevention of COVID-19 geographic proximity transmission.

relationship between ùõº and ùõΩ, and there is a linear relationship between ùõæ1 and ùõæ2 . This shows
that countries with rapid COVID-19 transmission are also more efficient in diagnosis, so as to reduce
the burden of increasing patients. China not only keep the diagnosis rate at a high level, but also
effectively reduce the spreading speed of the epidemic. Most of them have adopted a more timely
travel restriction and contact precaution in face with COVID-19.

6. CONCLUSION
We performed a simulation analysis of COVID-19 using SEIR model assuming
that the current policies by May 21, 2020 remain. From the analysis, we draw the
following conclusions:
(1) We simulated the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in 51 countries. The average
basic reproductive number R0 of these countries was estimated to be 2.76 (95% CI:
2.57 ‚Äì 2.95).
(2) Thirteen countries will have a peak value over 100,000, including the United States,
Russian Federation, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, France, Germany,
Turkey, Iran, India, Peru and Canada. And 34 of the 51 countries including Belgium,
Saudi Arabia, Mexico will have peak values between 10,000 and 100,000.
(3) Western Europe, Southeast Asia to Oceania, the Middle East, and North America
will be the four epicenter with the most severe situation. The epidemic situation in
North America and Western Europe is estimated to far exceed that in China. In
addition, North America will be the worst-hit epicenter.
(4) The 51 countries or regions were divided into four clusters by using clustering
algorithm based on epidemiology related parameters ùõº , ùõΩ , ùõæ1 , ùõæ2 , ùëê . The
discovered four clusters represent low risk, medium risk, high risk, and effective
control respectively. Based on the similarity of epidemic characteristics, we gave
early warnings to many countries, including Canada, Ireland, etc.
7. DISCUSSION
In this paper, we mainly estimated and analyzed the transmission trend of COVID19 based on the daily updated data of confirmed cases and recovered cases. In fact, the
trend of COVID-19 is related to multiple factors. China's prior data were used in the
third phase of the epidemic (see Figure 2); however, the testing policies and standards
in each country and region are different, which is highly related to the governance
system and safety consciousness. In addition, in the second phase of epidemic
transmission, community transmission plays an important role. The intensity of people
flow directly affects the infection degree of the virus. Some factors, such as subway
traffic, catering facilities, and customs or habits of each region remains to be studied.
All the analyses above are based on the assumption that the official statistics of
confirmed cases and of recovered cases reflect the real status quo of epedemics. As a
matter of fact, there may be deviations in the norms of statistical data in various
countries, which may also lead to bias in our results.
