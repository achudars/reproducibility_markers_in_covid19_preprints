Workplaces deploy internal guidelines to remain operational during the ongoing COVID19 pandemic. It is challenging to assess whether those interventions will prevent superspreading events, where an infected individual transmits the disease to 10 or more secondary
cases. Here we provide a model of infectious disease at the level of a workplace to address
that problem. We take as input proximity contact records based on bluetooth technology
and the infectious disease parameters from the literature. Using proximity contact data for
a case-study workplace and an infection transmission model, we estimate the SARS-CoV2 transmission rate as 0.014 per proximity contact, going up to 0.041 for the SARS-CoV-2
B.1.1.7 variant first detected in the UK. Defining super-spreading as events with 10 or more
secondary infections, we obtain a super-spreading event rate of 2.3 per 1000 imported SARSCoV-2 cases, rising up to 13.7 for SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7. This methodology provides the means
for workplaces to determine their internal super-spreading rate or other infection related
risks.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has tested our ability to control an infectious disease outbreak at multiple
scales 1 . Air traffic was almost completely shut down at the earlier stages 2 . Lockdown or curfews
followed in cities, regions and countries where the COVID-19 incidence rose to alarming levels 3 .
After the airborne nature of the SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) virus was confirmed, mask use and social
distancing were introduced 4 . These non-pharmaceutical interventions were successful, where and
when applied, reducing the reproductive number and mortality 5 . Vaccinations have started in
several countries but we still have a challenging year ahead. The relaxation of lockdowns has lead
to secondary outbreaks worldwide. More alarmingly, a new variant of SARS2 has been identified
in the United Kingdom (lineage B.1.1.7 6 ) with a higher reproductive number

7, 8

. The SARS2-

B.1.1.7 variant is already spreading worldwide.

The economic and psychological impacts of lockdowns have changed our response to the
pandemic 9 . The alternative to lockdowns is a distributed approach where workplaces deploy
containment measures to remain operational. In the distributed scenario workplaces, households
and individuals are responsible to carry out the containment measures. Each workplace must do
their part for this distributed approach to work. To achieve this goal, workplaces need support with
knowledge and tools. The focus of most studies on COVID-19 transmission dynamics has been
either at the city/country wide level 10–16 or at the level of aerosol transmission in one room 17, 18 .
More work needs to be done at the level of workplaces, taking into account the temporal network
of proximity contacts.

Here we investigate the generation of SARS2 outbreaks within a workplace, using as input
proximity contact data gathered with bluetooth technology. Our main results are an estimate of
the SARS2 rate of transmission per proximity contact, a generative model to simulate infectious
disease outbreaks within workplaces, estimates of the rate of super-spreading events per imported
case and an evaluation of mask use as an example of non-pharmaceutical interventions within the
workplace.

Results

Proximity contact alarm system

We have collected anonymous proximity contact data from a workplace. The workers wore
button devices that reported a distance alert when the distance between two coworkers was less than
1.5m for 15 seconds (Fig. 1A). The buttons communicated with gateway beacons using bluetooth
technology, which sent data to a backend server. Overall we recorded 21182 proximity contacts
between 605 workers for a period of 44 days. The total number of contacts between any two pairs
of individuals fluctuates over time, from values close to zero during weekends to as high as 20
contacts per individual during working days (Fig. 1B).

The fluctuations between weekdays introduce uncertainty in the expectation of spreading
outbreaks size. An individual becoming infectious on Monday has more potential to infect other
individuals at the workplace than one becoming infectious on Friday and going home during the
infectious period. Furthermore, the correlation of events happening within the same day will be

shown to be important below.

Disease transmission model

The proximity contact records provide a temporal network to model the spread of airborne
viruses. Using the language of infectious diseases, a primary case is an infected individual who
is the focus of our attention and secondary cases are individuals becoming infected after contact
with the primary case. We will use the term imported to specify that the primary case has been
infected outside the workplace. A typical scenario is an imported primary case that comes to
work (Fig. 2A, red individual). During workdays the primary case will get in proximity contact
with other workplace members. These other individuals could get infected and therefore they are
potential cases. The number of potential cases will depend on who is the primary case and how
many contacts he/she makes during the infectious period. Among those potential cases, some will
become infected and they will be counted as secondary cases.

The more frequent the contacts between a primary case and a potential case are, the higher
the chance of disease transmission. We model this aggregate risk of infection using a disease transmission rate per proximity contact p and the probability of disease transmission after c proximity
contacts with an infectious individual
pc = 1 − (1 − p)c .

(1)

The latter equals 1 minus the probability of no transmission in any of the c contacts. In principle
we could develop mechanistic models of disease transmission to estimate the transmission rate per

contact 17 . However, that would require us to have a precise knowledge of the environment where
these contacts took place (volume, ventilation, temperature), as well as more detailed data of the
proximity contacts. Instead, we determine the transmission rate per contact as the value that is
consistent with the infectious disease reproductive number.

We developed a procedure to simulate the disease transmission given the proximity contact
data, the disease infectious period and the probability of disease transmission after repeated contacts (1). Using this procedure we calculate different statistics characterizing the disease outbreaks
within the case-study workplace with the contact records shown in (Fig. 1B). Figure 3 reports
the expected reproductive number as a function of the disease transmission rate per contact for
infectious periods of 1 or 3 days, which corresponds to the infection periods of the 2019 influenza
20

and SARS2 21 , respectively. We can invert this relationship to determine the transmission rate

per contact that is consistent with a reported reproductive number. Table 1 contains reports of
the reproductive number of SARS2, the 2019 influenza and the SARS2 B.1.1.7 variant, together
with our estimates of the associated transmission rates. It may sound counterintuitive that the
2019 influenza has a higher estimated transmission rate than SARS2. However, the 2019 influenza
generates its reproductive number in a shorter infectious period, which implies a higher transmission rate. More importantly, we estimate a dramatic increase of the transmission rate for the new
SARS2 variant, going from 0.014 to 0.041 transmissions per contact.

With the estimated disease transmission rate we can run simulations to compare different
infectious diseases and to assess the impact of intervention strategies. Mask use is simulated

by reducing the transmission rate in proportion to the mask efficiency

22, 23

. Social distancing is

modelled by removing a fraction of the proximity contacts in proportion to the degree of social
distancing. The latter yields the same reproductive number as mask use (see Methods) and will not
be discussed further.

Distribution of secondary cases

The distribution of secondary cases contains the information to quantify the rate of superspreading events. The number of secondary cases is constrained by the number of potential cases,
which is determined by the temporal proximity contact network and the infectious period. The
distribution of the number of potential cases has an exponential tail (Fig. 4A). The average number
of secondary cases generated by an individual is proportional to his/her average number of potential cases (Fig. 4B). This proportionality together with the exponential tail of the distribution of
potential cases ultimately results in an exponential tail for the distribution of the number of secondary cases as well (Fig. 4C). The exponential tail is in agreement with reports for the observed
distribution of the number of SARS2 secondary infections 15 . The observed data is best fitted by a
negative binomial distribution that is characterized by an exponential tail 15, 24 .

Focusing on the number of secondary cases, there is not much difference between the distributions for SARS2 and the 2019 influenza (Fig. 4C). These diseases have a similar propensity to
generate super-spreading events. Therefore, the occurrence of super-spreading events is a general
property of all infectious diseases transmitted by proximity contacts. The super-spreading events
are rooted in the broad distribution of potential cases (Fig. 4A).

Next, we tested the relevance of the temporal structure of the proximity contacts. To this
end, we shuffled the data in two different ways. In the most complete randomization, we shuffled
the days assigned to all the contacts recorded (mixed-all). In the second approach we keept the
temporal cluster within days intact. We permuted days as a block, keeping contacts happening on
the same day together (mixed-day). The distributions of the number of potential and of secondary
cases have a faster decay for the mixed-all data than for the original records (Fig. 4A,C, circles
vs triangles-down). In contrast, the mixed-day shuffling leads to a slight shift from the original
distributions (Fig. 4A,C, circles vs triangles-left). The temporal clustering of proximity contacts
within days is therefore crucial to obtain the correct distribution of the number of secondary cases.
This observation highlights the importance of working with the actual proximity contact records
of the target workplace.

S-index

From the distribution of secondary cases we determine the statistics of super-spreading
events. Super-spreading events are defined in different ways in the literature, with different publications having different criteria for how many secondary cases are required for such an event 24–28 .
Here, we define a super-spreading event as an event where the number of secondary cases equals or
exceeds 10. Therefore the super-spreading events are associated with the tail of the distribution of
the number of secondary cases. The weight of the tail quantifies the rate of super-spreading events
per imported case. We name this quantity the super-spreading index (S-index). The S-index will
be reported in units of super-spreading events per 1000 imported infectious-disease cases. The S-

index is determined by both the infection disease and the temporal network of proximity contacts.
For example, a pub may have a higher S-index than a workplace for the same infectious disease,
because proximity contacts are more frequent in a pub than in a workplace.

The legend in Fig. 4C reports the S-index for each distribution. The workplace from where
the proximity contact data originated has a S-index of 2.3 per 1000 imported SARS2 cases. The
2019 influenza has an estimated S-index of 1.7, slightly lower than the 2.3 value for SARS2. We
also noticed that the full randomization of the day labels (mixed-all) reduced the S-index to 0.2
super-spreading events per 1000 imported SARS2 cases. In contrast, the randomization of days
keeping records within the same day together (mixed-day) lead to a smaller decrease of the Sindex from 2.3 to 1.2 super-spreading events per 1000 imported SARS2 cases. Once again, the
latter highlights the importance of working with the actual proximity contact records to get the
correct estimate of super-spreading rate.

SARS2-B.1.1.7 variant

The SARS2 B.1.1.7, first detected in the UK, is raising concerns because of its relatively
higher reproductive number

7, 8

. Based on our estimate using the transmission model described

above, the transmission rate of the SARS2-B.1.1.7 variant is 0.041 per proximity contact, 3 times
larger than the previous SARS2 strain (Table 1). As the transmission rate increases, more potential
cases are at risk of becoming actual secondary cases. Therefore, the higher transmission rate
results in a wider distribution of the number of secondary cases (Fig. 4D, triangles vs circles).
The estimated S-index goes up to 13.7 super-spreading events per 1000 imported SARS2-B.1.1.7

cases for the case-study workplace, 6 times higher than the S-index for the previous variant. The
introduction of mask use, with a simulated mask efficiency of 50% 29 , brings the estimated S-index
to 4.9 per 1000 imported SARS2-B.1.1.7 cases, still 2 times larger than the S-index for SARS2.

Discussion

This work highlights the importance of each workplace having an understanding of the proximity
contact patterns among its members. The data collection can be conducted without linking the
devices’ identification numbers to the individuals’ names to assure anonymity. Given the proximity
contact information, each workplace can build its tailored generative model to simulate the spread
of SARS2 and the impact of containment strategies. In our opinion this is a requirement to manage
infectious disease outbreaks using a distributed approach.

We have estimated the SARS2 transmission rate as 0.014 per contact. We cannot determine
if this estimate is specific for the case-study workplace or whether it applies to other workplaces as
well. We will be able to answer this question once data from other workplaces is obtained. We also
estimated the super-spreading rate in the workplace to be as low as 2.3 super-spreading events per
1000 imported SARS2 cases. The numbers for the SARS2-B.1.1.7 variant are more alarming if
the reports regarding the increase in reproductive number prove to be true. The estimated SARS2B.1.1.7 transmission rate goes up to 0.041 per proximity contact. The super-spreading rate goes up
to 13.7 super-spreading events per 1000 imported SARS2-B.1.1.7 cases. Simulated mask use, with
50% mask efficiency, brings the S-index down to 4.9 per 1000 imported SARS2-B.1.1.7 cases, still

2 times larger than what is estimated for SARS2.

Our simulations indicate that the 2009 influenza has similar infectious parameters to SARS2.
The difference in the reproductive number of SARS2 and the 2009 influenza is rooted in the infectious period, 3 days for SARS2 and 1 day for the 2009 influenza. The applicability of the proposed
infection model and the S-index extends beyond the ongoing SARS2 outbreak. Our methodology
can be applied to simulate the spread of other airborne infectious diseases. The necessary requirements are anonymous proximity contact records and estimates of the disease infectious period and
the basic reproductive number in the absence of interventions.

Methods

Proximity contact data

The proximity contact data were collected with the social distance monitoring application
from the companies Secufy GmbH and Safefactory GmbH. Battery-powered sensors by Secufy
are attached to the clothing of individuals and act autonomously without storing data locally. Once
activated, each sensor uses Bluetooth Low Energy to measure the signal strength from other sensors. The signal strength is then used to estimate the relative distance to other sensors in its vicinity.
If a distance threshold of 1.5 meters is exceeded for a time interval of 15 seconds, the involved sensors beep, directly alerting the affected users that the distance is too close. In addition to this, any
shortfall of the minimum distance that lasts longer than 15 seconds is sent to a backend solution
from the company Safefactory GmbH, which logs all proximity alarms. The data was collected in

The infectious disease transmission model takes as input the proximity contact records for a
workplace with n individuals over a period of m days. Let Cijd be the number of contacts between
a pair of individuals (i, j) on day d, where i ∈ [1, . . . , n] and d ∈ [1, . . . , m]. Following our main
model assumption (1), the probability of disease transmission from i to j, given that i becomes

Therefore, social distancing is equivalent to a reduction in the transmission rate from p to pq, which
is mathematically equivalent to the mask use model above.

Estimation of the transmission rate per contact

The transmission rate per contact was estimated as the solution of the equation RM (p, C, T ) =
R0 , given C, T and R0 .

The percentage of contacts at the work place is reported as 21% 30 , 25% 31 , 16% 32 , and 20%

. We assume a value of 20%.

The basic reproductive number of SARS2 in the absence of interventions is reported as 2.4 21 .
The workplace basic reproductive number therefore equals R0 = 0.2 × 2.4 = 0.48. The infectious
period of SARS2 is 3 days 21 .

The basic reproductive number of the 2009 influenza in the absence of interventions is reported as 1.7 19 . The workplace basic reproductive number therefore equals R0 = 0.2×1.7 = 0.34.
The infectious period of influenza is 1 day 20 .

The basic reproductive number of the SARS2-B.1.1.7 variant is reported to be 1.74 8 or 2.24
7

higher than for SARS2. We use a factor of 2, which is the average between the two reports,

resulting in the reproductive number R0 = 2.24 × 2.4 = 5.4 and the workplace basic reproductive
number R0 = 0.2 × 2.24 × 2.4 = 1.1. The infectious period of SARS2-B.1.1.7 is assumed to be
the same as for SARS2, 3 days.

Acknowledgements

This project was supported by DLR project ResTAT. We thank Secufy GmbH, safefactory GmbH
and ISA S.p.A. for providing the proximity contact data and additional information about the study
design.

Author information

DL and EB conceived the project. AV developed the infection transmission model with recommendations from all authors. AV and MS performed data analysis. All authors worked on the
manuscript.

Ethics declaration

ES has indirect shares and convertible loans in Secufy GmbH.

The data we received from ISA contained anonymous identification numbers, one for each
individual wearing the buttons. DLR does not have a key to trace back to persons, therefore data
for DLR is anonymous. We therefore only process anonymized data.
