Abstract
Background: In severe cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) with alveolar tissue injury occurs. However, the time course and specific
contributions of alveolar epithelial and endothelial injury to the pathogenesis of COVID-19
ARDS remain unclear.
Methods: We evaluated the levels of a circulating alveolar epithelial injury marker (soluble
receptor for advanced glycation end-products: sRAGE) and an endothelial injury marker
(angiopoietin-2: ANG-2), along with an alveolar permeability indicator (surfactant protein D:
SP-D) in 107 serum samples from nine patients with ARDS and eight without ARDS, all
with COVID-19. We compared the initial levels of these markers between ARDS and
non-ARDS patients, and analysed the temporal changes of these markers in ARDS patients.
Findings: All the initial levels of sRAGE, ANG-2, and SP-D were significantly higher in the
ARDS patients than in the non-ARDS patients. The peak sRAGE level in the ARDS patients
was observed at the very early phase of disease progression. However, the peaks of ANG-2
and SPD were observed at a later phase. Moreover, the ANG-2 level was significantly
correlated with the arterial oxygenation and the SPD level, but the sRAGE level was not.
Interpretation: Evaluation of circulating markers confirms that COVID-19 ARDS is
characterised by severe alveolar tissue injury. Our data indicate that the endothelial injury,
which continues for a longer period than the epithelial injury, seems to be the main

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is a novel strain
of Coronavirus that has been spreading worldwide following its origin from Wuhan, China
since late 2019, and its outbreak has provoked a public health emergency. Infection with
SARS-CoV-2 causes Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), pneumonia, and in the most severe
cases, the infection leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that is characterised
by severe pulmonary oedema with increased alveolar permeability[1]. The alveolar barrier is
composed of alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells and separates the alveolar air space from
pulmonary circulation[2]. Damage to the alveolar epithelial or endothelial cells is generally
the main pathological signature of ARDS[3]. Several previous reports have demonstrated that
the lungs from patients with ARDS with COVID-19 show diffused alveolar damage along
with alveolar epithelial and endothelial injury[4,5] and the presence of viral RNA in epithelial
and endothelial cells[6,7]. However, the time course and specific contribution of alveolar
epithelial and of endothelial injury to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 ARDS remain unclear.
Better clarity regarding these issues will help in improved understanding of the disease, and
tell us what should be focused on for improved treatment possibilities.
There are several established circulating alveolar tissue injury markers[8–10]. The
receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is primarily expressed in alveolar
type-1 cells, and the level of circulating soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE) correlates with
type-1 alveolar epithelial injury[11,12]. Angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2) is a growth factor expressed

in endothelial cells and its elevation indicates endothelial injury in patients with
ARDS[13,14]. Surfactant proteins, including surfactant protein D (SP-D), are secreted by
type-2 alveolar epithelial cells into the alveolar space. In the case alveolar barrier is disrupted,
SP-D leaks from the alveolar space into the blood stream, and increase in the concentration of
circulating SP-D indicates the alveolar barrier permeability[15,16]. Evaluating the
characteristics of these alveolar tissue injury markers can provide insights regarding the
alveolar endothelial and epithelial injuries during COVID-19 ARDS progression[17].
Here, we investigated the levels of a circulating alveolar epithelial injury marker;
soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE), an endothelial injury marker;
angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2), and an alveolar barrier permeability indicator; surfactant protein D
(SP-D) in serum from COVID-19 patients with or without ARDS. Although both the alveolar
epithelial and endothelial injury markers were markedly elevated in the COVID-19 ARDS
patients, our data indicate that the endothelial injury, which continues for a longer period than
the epithelial injury, seems to be the main contributor to alveolar barrier disruption.

Methods
Study Design
In this single-centre, retrospective observational study, we analysed the serum
concentrations of sRAGE, ANG-2, and SP-D in serum from adult patients with COVID-19,

admitted to Yokohama City University Hospital from January to July 2020.

The inclusion

criteria were: 1) a diagnosis of COVID-19 by positive results of real-time polymerase chain
reaction, 2) age 18 years old or over, 3) the residual serum samples were available. ARDS
was diagnosed according to the Berlin Definition. The study protocol was reviewed and
approved by the institutional review board of Yokohama City University Hospital
(B200700100). Informed consent was waived in view of the retrospective observational
nature of the study.

Clinical data collection
Clinical data were retrospectively collected from the medical charts of each patient. We
collected data on patients’ basal characteristics, vital signs, laboratory tests, and blood gas
analysis during the first 14 days after hospital admission.

Quantification of alveolar tissue injury markers in serum
Residual serum samples from the patients with COVID-19 were collected after daily
laboratory tests and frozen. Serum sRAGE, ANG-2, and SP-D concentrations were measured
using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (human
RAGE: DY1145, human ANG-2: DY623, human SP-D: DY1920, R&D systems, MN, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

We compared the initial concentrations of these markers on the first or second hospital
day between ARDS and non-ARDS patients. Moreover, we analysed the temporal changes of
these markers in ARDS patients.

Statistical analyses
The median ± interquartile range (IQR) values of the data were used for analyses.
Comparisons of the serum levels of circulating alveolar tissue injury markers and various
basal laboratory and physiological values between patients with ARDS and those without
ARDS were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. To analyse the correlation of serum
levels of sRAGE or ANG-2 with SP-D levels or PaO2/fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F) ratios,
the values of the serum markers were log-transformed to obey normal distribution, and the
correlations were evaluated by linear mixed model analysis with random intercepts for
individual patients. All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.0.3).
Statistical significance level was set at P < 0.05.

Results
Clinical characteristics of patients
Nine ARDS and eight non-ARDS patients, all with COVID-19, were included in the
study. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The median ages of the ARDS and
non-ARDS groups were 67 (IQR: 63–75) and 48·5 (30–73) years, respectively. All patients in
the ARDS group were men, and six of eight patients in the non-ARDS group were men.
Three of the nine in the ARDS group (33·3%) died and all in the non-ARDS group survived.
APACHE-2 scores at admission were significantly higher in those in the ARDS group than
those in the non-ARDS group. Moreover, PaO2/fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F) ratios at
admission were lower in the ARDS group than in the non-ARDS group. However, creatinine
and total bilirubin levels were not significantly different between the ARDS and non-ARDS
groups. Laboratory data at admission demonstrate significantly lower lymphocyte count and
higher C-reactive protein and D-dimer values in the ARDS group than those in the
non-ARDS group, indicating that severe inflammatory and coagulation responses
accompanied with acquired immunosuppression are hallmarks of ARDS with COVID-19.
Temporal changes of the organ function indicators of lung (P/F ratio), kidney (serum
creatinine), and liver (serum total bilirubin) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment

days starting from admission are shown in Fig.1. Among patients with ARDS, only one
patient developed acute kidney injury, and some patients showed only a small increase in
total-bilirubin concentration. Thus, organ dysfunction in the patients was primarily limited to
the lungs.

Circulating alveolar tissue injury markers
The initial serum levels of all markers; sRAGE, ANG-2, and SP-D, were significantly
higher in the ARDS group than in the non-ARDS group (sRAGE: median: 2680 pg/mL,
IQR:1522–5076 vs. median 701 pg/mL, IQR:344–1148.0, p=0.0152, ANG-2: median 699
pg/mL, IQR: 410-2501 vs. median 231 pg/mL, IQR: 64-584, p=0.0464, SP-D: median: 17542
pg/mL, IQR: 7423-22979 vs. 1771 pg/mL, IQR: 458-204, p=0.0274) (Fig.2).
The temporal changes in these markers in COVID-19 ARDS patients are shown in
Fig.3A–C. The peak for serum sRAGE level was observed just after admission (median: day
1, IQR: day 1–3.5) (Fig.3D). In contrast, the peak timings of serum ANG-2 (median: day 4,
IQR: day 2.5–6) and SP-D (median: day 5, IQR: day 3–7.5) and SP-D (median: day five after
admission, IQR: day 3–7·5) levels were during a later phase of the disease (Fig.3D).
Linear mixed effect model analysis revealed that the serum ANG-2 levels had a
significant negative correlation with P/F ratios (fixed effect: -29.9, 95%CI: -56.6–-3.3,
p=0.030) (Fig. 4A) and a significant positive correlation with the SP-D levels (fixed effect:

0.490, 95%CI: 0.184–0.797, p=0.002) (Fig. 4B) during first 14 hospital days; however, the
sRAGE levels had no significant correlation with P/F ratios (fixed effect: -19.9, 95%CI:
-51.2–11.3, p=0.215) (Fig. 4D), and an opposite correlation with SP-D levels (fixed effect:
-0.557, 95%CI: -0.925–-0.189, p=0.004) (Fig. 4C).

Discussion
In ARDS with COVID-19, circulating alveolar epithelial and endothelial injury markers
were markedly elevated, but not in the case of non-ARDS COVID-19, indicating that
alveolar barrier tissue injury is a hallmark of COVID-19 ARDS pathogenesis. Interestingly,
time courses of changes in alveolar epithelial and in endothelial injury markers were different
from each other. The observed serum sRAGE level was highest on admission in most patients
with ARDS. In contrast, ANG-2 level reached a peak at later time points. These data suggest
that the alveolar epithelial injury in the COVID-19 ARDS already reached the maximum
level before hospital admission. Meanwhile, the endothelial injury seems to continue to
deteriorate for several days after admission. Therefore, it is expected that there is a potential
therapeutic time window to alleviate the endothelial injury even after hospitalization.
Moreover, the ANG-2 levels were significantly correlated with the P/F ratios and the SP-D

levels, suggesting endothelial injury, rather than alveolar epithelial injury, might be a main
contributor that leads to deterioration of alveolar permeability during ARDS with COVID-19.
Several previous reports evaluating lung tissues obtained from patients who died from
severe COVID-19 revealed diffused alveolar damage accompanied by epithelial and
endothelial injuries [4,5] along with the presence of viral RNA in these cells [6,7]. Moreover,
several studies demonstrated the blood levels of endothelial injury markers at admission were
significantly increased[18–23]. However, the underlying mechanisms of alveolar epithelial
and endothelial injury has not been fully elucidated. SARS-CoV-2 can infect alveolar type 1
and 2 epithelial cells and endothelial cells[24], and causes multiple cellular responses[25],
which are potentially cytotoxic[26]. On the other hand, inflammatory responses caused by
SARS-CoV-2, rather than the SARS-CoV-2 infection itself to the targeted cells, may be the
main driver of the alveolar tissue injuries[27,28]. The present study clearly demonstrates the
difference in the peak timing of epithelial and endothelial injury markers, indicating that there
are distinct mechanisms for injury to each type of cell. Future studies to clarify each of the
injury mechanisms, especially focusing the endothelial injury, can be a promising approach to
find efficacious therapeutic targets for COVID-19 ARDS.
Only a small number of studies have evaluated the temporal kinetics of circulating
alveolar epithelial and endothelial injury markers during ARDS caused by aetiologies other
than COVID-19. Two reports have previously demonstrated that sRAGE levels in the blood

of ARDS patients with bacterial sepsis peak on the initial day after admission[29,30]. Thus,
based on previous findings as well as our results, alveolar epithelial injury seems to occur
during the initial phase of ARDS progression irrespective of the aetiology. On the other hand,
the time course of circulating ANG-2 levels during ARDS has not been previously reported.
Kumpers et al. have reported that circulating ANG-2 levels in patients with bacterial sepsis,
72 hours after intensive care unit admission, increased from the baseline level only in the
non-survivors, not in the survivors[31]. In our study, the ANG-2 levels increased from
baseline in most patients, including survivors, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 induces more
severe endothelial injury than other aetiologies for injury, such as bacterial infection. Several
reports have demonstrated that lung vascular thrombosis is a pathological feature of ARDS
caused by SARS-CoV-2[4,5,32]. Moreover, the occurrence of systemic thrombotic
complications in patients with COVID-19 has been reported[33]. Endothelial injury caused
by SARS-CoV-2 infection might be the basal mechanism of thrombosis formation[34].
Circulating markers of alveolar tissue injury can be easily measured in clinical settings.
Our data suggest that initial levels of RAGE can be a prognostic marker of COVID-19.
Moreover, patterns of these tissue injury markers might be useful for predicting or evaluating
the responses to treatment for ARDS in the case of COVID-19. Recently, it has been shown
that circulating biomarkers can distinguish sub-phenotypes among patients with
ARDS[17,35]. It is possible that ARDS caused by COVID-19 also has several

sub-phenotypes, and different treatment strategies for each sub-phenotype might be necessary.
Further studies to evaluate the utility of these circulating markers are, thus, warranted.
There are some limitations to our study. First, the sample size was small because of the
factor of availability of daily serum samples from patients with COVID-19 ARDS. This may
have affected the statistical strength of our analyses. It is, hence, necessary to confirm our
results using samples from large cohorts to obtain insights into the pathogenesis of alveolar
tissue injury during COVID-19. Second, because of the observational nature of the study
design, treatments for COVID-19 were not standardized. Therefore, it is possible that the
treatment strategies might affect the kinetics of circulating alveolar tissue injury markers.
In conclusion, our evaluation of circulating alveolar tissue injury markers indicates that
the alveolar epithelial and endothelial injury have distinct time courses and pathogenic
contributions in ARDS with COVID-19. The injury to endothelial cells, which continues for
a longer period than the epithelial injury, seems to be the main contributor to alveolar barrier
disruption. Targeting the endothelial injury rather than the epithelial injury, may be a
potential efficacious approach to overcome ARDS with COVID-19.
