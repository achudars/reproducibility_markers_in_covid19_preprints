Abstract
In this paper, a new Susceptible-Exposed-Symptomatic Infectious-Asymptomatic InfectiousQuarantined-Hospitalized-Recovered-Dead (SEID IU QHRD) deterministic compartmental model has been proposed and calibrated for interpreting the transmission dynamics
of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The purpose of this study is to give
a tentative prediction of the epidemic peak for Russia, Brazil, India and Bangladesh
which could become the next COVID-19 hotspots in no time by using a Trust-regionreflective (TRR) algorithm which one of the well-known real data fitting techniques.
Based on the publicly available epidemiological data from late January until 10 May, it
has been estimated that the number of daily new symptomatic infectious cases for the
above mentioned countries could reach the peak around the beginning of June with
the peak size of ∼ 15, 774 (95% CI, 13,814-17,734) symptomatic infectious cases in
Russia, ∼ 26, 449 (95% CI, 23,489-29,409) cases in Brazil, ∼ 9, 504 (95% CI, 8,37810,630) cases in India and ∼ 2, 209 (95% CI, 1,878-2,540) cases in Bangladesh. As
of May 11, 2020, incorporating the infectiousness capability of asymptomatic carriers, our analysis estimates the value of the basic reproduction number (R0 ) as of May
11, 2020 was found to be ∼ 4.234 (95% CI, 3.764-4.7) in Russia, ∼ 5.347 (95% CI,
4.737-5.95) in Brazil, ∼ 5.218 (95% CI, 4.56-5.81)in India, ∼ 4.649 (95% CI, 4.17-5.12)
in the United Kingdom and ∼ 3.53 (95% CI, 3.12-3.94) in Bangladesh. Moreover,
Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) which is a
global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method is applied to quantify the uncertainty of our
model mechanisms, which elucidates that for Russia, the recovery rate of undetected
asymptomatic carriers, the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and
the transition rate from quarantined class to susceptible class are the most influential
parameters, whereas the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the
inverse of the COVID-19 incubation period are highly sensitive parameters in Brazil,
India, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom which could significantly affect the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. Our analysis also suggests that relaxing
social distancing restrictions too quickly could exacerbate the epidemic outbreak in the
above-mentioned countries.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved as a global public health
emergency affecting 212 countries and territories around the world as of May 12, 2020
Worldometer, (2020). COVID-19 is one kind of respiratory disease by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that was first spotted around late December 2019, in Wuhan,
Hubei province, China Li et al., (2020); Zhou et al., (2020). This novel virus started
transmitting around the world rapidly, and on 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Later, WHO
Director-General announced COVID-19 as a global pandemic. As of May 11, 2020,
an outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in 4,271,689 confirmed cumulative cases with
reported deaths of 287,613 worldwide Worldometer, (2020). In most of the countries,
infected patients are struggling to get the proper treatment due to highly transmissible and virulent nature of the virus. Nevertheless, numerous COVID-19 mitigation
strategies has been adapted so far such as quarantine, isolation, promoting the wearing
of face masks, travel restrictions, and lockdowns with a view to reducing community
transmission of the disease.
In the absence of either established effective treatment or a vaccine, the already
fragile health care systems of different developed and developing countries can be overburdened due to the overwhelming surge of infections in in the coming months provided
that the spread is not controlled. This pandemic is giving an upsurge to multifarious
noteworthy socio-economic and public health impacts and has highlighted the significance of detecting the evolution of the disease and prediction of disease future dynamics for designing infectious disease prevention and control strategies, effective public
health policies and economical activity guidelines. Different mathematical paradigms
have always played a notable role in providing deeper understanding of the transmission
mechanisms of a disease outbreak, contributing considerable insights for controlling the
disease outbreak. One of the familiar models for human-to-human transmission which
is reasonably predictive is Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) epidemic model proposed by Kermack-Mckendrick in 1927 Calafiore et al., (2020); Nesteruk (2020). After
that, the SIR epidemic model has been extended to Susceptible-Exposed-InfectiousRemoved (SEIR) model and many of its variants to explore the risk factors of a disease
or predict the dynamics of a disease outbreak Wu et al., (2020); Calafiore et al.,
(2020); kucharski et al., (2020); Simha et al., (2020); Anastassopoulou et al., (2020);
Nesteruk (2020). It is really challenging in population based model to incorporate
certain real-world complexities. In fact, analysis and prediction could go wrong in the
absence of adequate historical real data. On the other hand, various agent-based often
stochastic models where individuals interact on a network structure and get infected
stochastically, have been treated as useful tools for tracing fine-grained effects of heterogeneous intervention policies in diverse disease outbreaks Ferguson et al., (2020);
Chang et al., (2020); Wilder et al., (2020); Ruiz et al., (2020). However, accuracy of
this approach can be a vital issue due to the time-varying nature of network-structure.
Since the outbreak of the virus, incorporating travel between major cities in China,
Li et al., (2020) proposed an SEIR-model incorporating a metapopulation structure for
both reported and unreported infections. It has been discovered in their studies that
around 86% of all cases went undetected in Wuhan before travel restrictions imposed
on January 23, 2020. According to their estimation, on an individual basis, around

55% asymptomatic spreaders were contagious who were responsible for 79% of new
infected cases. Other studies Ferguson et al., (2020); Verity et al., (2020) solidified
the significance of incorporating asymptomatic carriers with a view to understanding
COVID-19 future dynamics appropriately. Later, Calafiore et al., (2020) estimated
that around 63% cases went under-reported in Italy by analyzing a modified SIRmodel. Anastassopoulou et al., (2020) apply the SIRD model to Chinese official
statistics, estimating parameters using linear regression and predict the COVID-19
pandemic in Hubei province by using these models and parameters. Nonetheless, longterm forecasting is debatable while using a simple mathematical model. Diego Caccavo,
(2020) and Peter Turchin, (2020) independently apply modified SIRD models, in which
parameters change overtime following specific function forms. Parameters govern these
functions are estimated by minimizing the sum-of-square-error. However, using the
sum-of-square method causes over-fitting and always favors a complex model, therefore
it is not suitable to access policy effectiveness. Moreover, fitting the SIRD model in
the early stage of infection is questionable as well.
In the light of above shortcomings of several established mathematical models,
a more refined deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, considering
all possible interactions, a Susceptible-Exposed-Symptomatic Infectious-Asymptomatic
Infectious-Quarantined-Hospitalized-Recovered-Dead (SEID IU QHRD) model has been
proposed, which can give more accurate and robust short-term as well as long-term
predictions of COVID-19 future dynamics. This model could be considered as a generalization of SEIR, which is based on the introduction of asymptomatic infectious
state, quarantined state in order to understand the effect of preventive actions and
hospitalized (isolated) state. Based on similar studies performed over SEIR dynamical
systems some assumptions are taken into account Wu et al., (2020); Calafiore et al.,
(2020); Anastassopoulou et al., (2020). As of May 11, it is evident that how the early
stage mathematical model parameters have changed drastically as detection rate was
really low until middle of February, however the outbreak situation has improved comprehensively in several countries due to massive scale testing Qianying et al. (2020).
We have considered the nominal values of the model parameters understanding the
characteristics of the coronavirus infection, quantitatively estimated in the literature
or published by health organizations Read et al., (2020); Li et al., (2020); Wu et al.,
(2020); Verity et al., (2020). In sequence, a rigorous process of model calibration
which is known as Trust-region-reflective algorithm is applied to determine the bestfitted parameter values of the model. Our analysis was based on the publicly available
data of the new confirmed daily cases reported for the future probable COVID-19
hotspots which are Russia, Brazil, India and Bangladesh from late January until May
09, 2020 Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University,
(2020). Further, we have validated our model for the United Kingdom using same
time frame. Based on the released data, we attempted to estimate the mean values of
the crucial epidemiological parameters for COVID-19, such as the infectiousness factor
for asymptotic carriers, isolation period, the estimation of the inflection point with
probable date, recovery period for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals,
case-fatality ratio and mortality rate in those potential hotspots. Perfect data-driven
and curve-fitting methods for the prediction of any disease outbreak have always been
question of interest in epidemiological research. Trust-region-reflect algorithm is one of

the robust least-square data-fitting techniques that can promote a fine relation between
the model driving mechanisms and model responses. This real-time data fitting approach could be efficient providing considerable insights on disease outbreak dynamics
in different countries and designing worthwhile public health policies in curtailing the
disease burden. Calibrating our model parameters by using the above algorithm, we
have provided probable forecasts for the newly evolving COVID-19 hotspots.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the mathematical model is described
and the background of choosing baseline parameter values for the model is discussed. In
section 3 and 4, the model has been analysed and model calibration technique has been
discussed respectively. In section 5, model prediction accuracy has been illustrated by
representing a graphical comparison between model responses and real-time data. In
section 6, one of the robust global sensitivity analysis techniques is used to quantify
the most influential mechanisms in our model. This paper ends with some qualitative
and quantitative observations and discussions.

In this work, we use a compartmental differential equation model for the spread
of COVID-19 in the world. The spread of the infection starts with the introduction
of a small group of infected individuals to a large population. In this model we focus our
study on eight components of the epidemic flow, i.e. {S(t), E(t), ID (t), IU (t), Q(t), H(t), R(t), D(t)}
which represent the number of the susceptible individuals, exposed individuals (infected
however not yet to be infectious, in an incubation period), symptomatic infectious individuals (confirmed with infectious capacity), asymptomatic infectious individuals (undetected but infectious), quarantined, hospitalized (under treatment), recovered cases
(immuned) and death cases (or closed cases). Then the entire number of population in
a certain region or country is N = S + E + ID + IU + Q + H + R + D. The following
assumptions are considered in the formulation of the model:

121

• Emigration from the population and immigration into the population have not
been taken into account in model formulation as there is negligible proportion of
individuals move in and out of the population at a specific time frame.

122

• Births and natural deaths in the population are not considered.

123

• The susceptible population are exposed to a latent class .

• Hospitalized patients cannot spread disease while in isolation treatment after
confirmed diagnosis.
• Recovered individuals do not return to susceptible class as they develop certain
immunity against the disease. Hence they cannot become re-infected again and
cannot infect susceptible either.
Figure 1 is the flow diagram of the proposed model, where susceptible individuals (S) get infected at a baseline infectious contact rate β, via contact with either
symptomatic infectious individuals (ID ) or at a rate βλ of asymptomatic infectious
carriers and move to exposed (E) class. The relative infectiousness capacity of asymptomatic spreaders is λ (related to symptomatic infectious individuals). Susceptible

individuals can be quarantined with contact tracing procedure and the rate of getting
home-quarantined or self-quarantined of S is q, whereas κ is the rate of progression
of symptoms of COVID-19 (hence κ1 is the mean incubation period of COVID-19).
Detected symptomatic infected individuals are generated at a progression rate σ1 and
undetected asymptomatic infectious cases are generated at a rate σ2 from the exposed
class. In addition, individuals who are exposed to virus can be quarantined with contact
tracing procedure at a rate (1−σ1 −σ2 ). γ is the rate of confirmation and isolation after
symptom onset in detected infectious individuals and 1/γ is the time period when the
infection can spread. The proportion of individuals from quarantined to symptomatic
infectious, asymptomatic infectious and susceptible are r2 η, r1 η and (1 − r1 − r2 )η
respectively. δU is the disease-induced death rate for undetected asymptomatic patients and δU is the death rate for hospitalized patients. φD , φU and φH are recovery
rates for the symptomatic patients, asymptomatic carriers and hospitalized patients
respectively. In addition, 1/φD , 1/φU and 1/φH represent the mean period of isolation
for the detected symptomatic infectious individuals, undetected asymptomatic carriers
and hospitalized patients. Based on these assumptions, the basic model structure for

2.1. Baseline epidemiological parameters
In the study of Lauer et al., (2020), the average incubation period of COVID-19
was calculate to be 5.1 days and similar model-based studies also justified the above
finding Li et al., (2020); Ferguson et al., (2020); Tang et al., (2020). Moreover, within
11.5 days (i.e. κ = 1/11.5 day −1 ) of infection, the individuals who were exposed to the
virus started developing symptoms Lauer et al., (2020); Verity et al., (2020) and 20.0
days was the mean duration of viral shedding observed in COVID-19 survivors Zhou et
al., (2020). The time duration from symptoms onset to recovery was estimated to be
24.7 days, whereas from onset of symptoms to death,the average mean duration was
estimated to be 17∆8 days Verity et al., (2020). In previous modeling studies,Shen
et al. (2020); Read et al., (2020); Li et al., (2020), the novel coronavirus effective
transmission rate, β ranges from around 0.25 − 1.5 day −1 , which gradually follows a
downward trend with time Tang et al., (2020). In sequence, we have considered this
parameter as a time-varying parameter in our fits. Table 1 illustrates the list of baseline
model parameters with brief description, probable ranges presented on clinical studies
and calibration, and default base value selected for our study.
2.2. Dataset
The recent epidemic data of five different countries which are Russia, Brazil, India,
Bangladesh and the United Kingdom is accumulated from authoritative and genuine
sources which are Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the COVID
Tracking Project (testing and hospitalizations). The data repository is handled by the
Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)
and supported by ESRI Living Atlas Team and the Johns Hopkins University Applied
Physics Lab (JHU APL). The repository is publicly available and easy to compile

3. Analysis of the Model
3.1. Disease Free Equilibrium (DFE)
The disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of (1) can be obtained easily by setting S =
E = ID = IU = Q = H = R = D = 0. Therefore the DFE of (1) is :
∗
E0 = (S0∗ , E0∗ , ID
, IU∗ 0 , Q∗0 , H0∗ , R0∗ , D0∗ ) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
0

3.2. Basic Reproduction Number for Proposed Model
Using the next generation operator method Van den Driessche et al. (2002) the
local stability of the DFE is investigated. According to the notation in Diekmann et
al., (1990), the associated non-negative matrix, F represents new infection terms, and
the non-singular matrix, V denotes remaining transfer termswhich can be described as
follows:


0 β βλ
F = 0 0 0 

and

V = −σ1 k γ + φD
−σ2 k

φU + δ U


The associated basic reproduction number, denoted by R0 is then given by,
R0 = ρ (FV −1 ), where ρ is the spectral radius of FV −1 . It follows that,
R0 =

193
194

β [δU σ1 + (γ + φD ) λσ2 + σ1 φU ]
(γ + φD ) (δU + φU )

(2)

Thus, by Theorem 2 of LaSalle (1976), the following result is established.
Lemma 1. The DFE, E0 of the system (1), is locally-asymptotically stable (LAS) if
R0 < 1, and unstable if R0 ≥ 1

199

The threshold quantity, R0 , estimates the mean number of secondary cases generated by a single infected individual in an entirely susceptible human population
Hethcote (2000). The above result implies that a small influx of infected individuals
would not generate large outbreaks if R0 < 1, and the disease will persist (be endemic)
in the population if R0 > 1.

The proposed epidemic model (1) is a continuous-time non-linear system of differential equations together with a suitable set of initial conditions. In this study,
Trust-region-reflective (TRR) algorithm has been used to determine the best-fitted parameters for our proposed model. We have used lsqcurvefit function in MATLAB to
calibrate our model. The optimization process can be expressed as follows:

In this section, we have used dynamically calibrated compartment model for realtime analysis and real-time prediction of COVID-19 outbreak for five different countries
which are Russia, Brazil, India, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom. Figure 2, 4, 6,
8, 10 illustrates the best real-time data fitting results using the baseline parameters
from Table 1 as initial inputs for our proposed model. The ranges of the parameters
and have been set compatible with the clinical studies and illustrated 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 along
with the parameters resulted from the calibration (“TRR output”). To ensure a huge
number of susceptible individuals at the initial stage of an outbreak, 0.9 N has been
set as a lower bound for S.
5.1. Analysis and prediction for Russia
With much of Europe now easing itself out of confinement, Russia could become
the continent’s new Covid-19 hotspot according to our analysis. The model fitting and
projection results for Russia from early February to late August are shown in Figure 2
and 3. We collected real data from February 01 to May 08, 2020 to calibrate the model
parameters.
As we can see the results from the proposed model match the real data very well.
Based on the proposed model, we want to project that from Figure 3, the number of
daily detected symptomatic infectious cases in Russia will reach the peak at May 27
with about 15.774K cases. As time progresses, our estimated daily projected mean
error drops to 10% for the cumulative cases and daily new cases which represents the
robustness of the model forecasting. The basic reproduction number is 4.234 as of May
08, which lies in prior established findings 2 − 7 for COVID-19 Liu et al., (2020). The
number of cumulative infected cases is projected to reach 970K around August 30, and
the estimated total death cases will reach to about 35K in the end. To date, Russia’s
official death toll of 1,827 is relatively low because not all deaths of people who have
contracted the virus are being counted as Covid-19 deaths. Table 2 illustrates the key
features used to calibrate this scenario which are compatible with the previous clinical
studies and relevant literature.

5.2. Analysis and prediction for Brazil
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic headed toward Latin America
later than other continents. On Feb 25, 2020, the first infected case was documented
. But now, Brazil has surpassed the records in Latin America in terms of deaths and
new infected cases (155939 cases and 10627 deaths as of May 9). This is probably an
underestimated scenario in comparison to real severity in Brazil. Our analysis projects
that Brazil is developing as one of the world’s next coronavirus hotspots. The model
fitting and projection results for Brazil from late February to late August are shown
in Figure 4 and 5. We took real data from February 25 to May 08 to calibrate the
model parameters. As we can see the results from the proposed model fit the real data
very well. Based on the proposed model, we project that from Figure 5, the number of
daily detected symptomatic infectious cases in Brazil seem reaching the peak around
June 11 with about 26.449K cases. The basic reproduction number is estimated about
5.3467 as of May 11, which is in between the observed basic reproduction number
for COVID-19, estimated about 2-7 for COVID-19 Liu et al., (2020). This crucial
epidemiological parameter could blow up because of scant diagnostics and impermanent
non-pharmaceutical interventions. The case-fatality rate is hovering around 9.3% as of
May 11, which is necessary to assess how much community transmission has occurred

and its burden. According to our projection, this ratio could be doubled within two
months. The number of cumulative infected cases is projected to reach 1800K around
August 30 if current trend is held, and the estimated total death cases will reach
to about 108K in the end. Table 3 illustrates the key features used to calibrate this
scenario which are compatible with the previous clinical studies and relevant literature.
5.3. Analysis and prediction for India
Some people might think about the possibilities of the presence of a less virulent
strain of the virus in India, along with the possibility that its hot weather could diminish the contagion. Nevertheless, our mathematical analysis suggests that India
could become the new Covid-19 hotspot in South Asia. According to our projection,
India could continue seeing spikes in the number of cases as it time progresses despite of following lockdown and other disease mitigation measures. The first case of
the COVID-19 pandemic in India was reported on 30 January 2020, originating from
China. But now, India has the most cases and deaths in South Asia (62,808 cases
and 2,101 deaths as of May 9), and these are probably substantial underestimates.
Figure 6 and 7 illustrate COVID-19 disease modeling and prediction for India from
late January to late August. We took real-time data from January 30 to May 8 to
calibrate the model parameters. As we can see, our proposed model match well for
the historical real data. Based on our prediction from Figure 7, the number of daily
detected symptomatic infectious cases in India seem reaching the peak around June
15 with about 9.504K cases. The basic reproduction number is 5.218 as of May 11,
which lies between the studied observations Liu et al., (2020). This estimation may
be considered as an overestimation of this critical parameter. Notwithstanding, this is
owing to the infectiousness factor of the asymptomatic spreaders. Minimally or reasonably symptomatic infectious and the asymptomatic spreaders should be quarantined
to avoid the transmission of the virus, with the critically symptomatic patients isolated

in proper health care settings. By carrying out massive scale contract tracing, risky
individuals could be identified by means of their exposure. The number of cumulative
infected cases is projected to reach 730K around August 30 if current pattern is held,
and the estimated total death cases will reach to about 43.8K in the end. Table 4
illustrates the key features used to calibrate this scenario which are compatible with
the previous clinical studies and relevant literature. Interestingly, we have found in our
analysis that India’s case-fatality rate is at 3.5% and the country’s recovery rate is at
33% which commensurate with real reported statistics precisely.

5.4. Analysis and prediction for the United Kingdom
Our analysis indicates that the United Kingdom could face risk of a second wave of
coronavirus infections as the United Kingsom gradually eases a nationwide lockdown.
According to Worldometer, (2020), by 11 May there had been 223,060 confirmed cases
and 32,065 deaths overall a rate of 465 deaths per million population . The outbreak in
London has the highest number and highest rate of infections, while England and Wales
are the UK countries with the highest recorded death rate per capita. Recently, The
prime minister of the UK has expressed his plan to unveil a coronavirus warning system
as an intervention strategy, while he was planning to ease the lockdown gradually in
the UK. For the UK, the modeling and projection results from January 31 to August
31 are shown in Figure 8 and 9. As we can see from Figure 9, the number of daily
detected symptomatic infectious cases reached the peak around April 10. Since then
the curve has been maintaining a plateau which is a really unusual scenario. This
phenomenon has closely been captured by our proposed model. This case study was
really important for the validation of our model. In fact, this guarantees the fact that
this model is capable of providing more precise and vigorous short-term predictions of
COVID-19 dynamics. According to our calculation, the basic reproduction number is
around 4.649 as of May 09, which lies in the prior studies of COVID-19 Anastassopoulou
et al., (2020); Liu et al., (2020). The number cumulative infected cases is projected to
reach 618K around August 30, and the estimated total death cases will reach to about
63.48K in the above mentioned period. Importantly, as of May 11, we have found in
our analysis that the UK’s case-fatality rate is at 17.2%, which is the worst among our
five studied cases. This could exacerbate as time progresses in the absence of proven

5.5. Analysis and prediction for Bangladesh
For Bangladesh, the calibration and projection results from early March to late
August of are shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11. On 22 March, with an aim to curtail the spread of the novel coronavirus in the wake of four deaths and at least 39
infections, Bangladesh government deployed a nationwide lockdown effective from 26
March, 2020. Notice that, there are some jumps in the number of confirmed daily
new infected cases data from 16 april to 20 april due to the increase of limited testing
system (from 2000 samples to 2700 samples per day) Institute of Epidemiology, Disease
Control and Research (IEDCR). Bangladesh is still struggling (around 6700 samples
per day) Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) to design
a massive scale testing program as of May 11, 2020. Despite the fact, as we can see
from Figure 10, our proposed model fits well for the historical real-time data. As time
progresses, the estimated error declines and is hovering around 10% for the cumulative cases and daily new cases according to our calculated daily projected mean error.
The estimated case-fatality rate in Bangladesh is at 2.7% which is kind of satisfactory,
however without massive scale testing this rate could rise sharply incoming days. Moreover, the country’s estimated recovery rate is at 24% which again complements the real
statistics precisely. Importantly, without an aggressive level mass-testing program it
is impossible to portray the real outbreak scenario in Bangladesh. Table 6 illustrates
the key features used to calibrate this scenario which are compatible with the previous
clinical studies and relevant literature.
On 4 May, Bangladesh authorities intended to open up more factories, shopping
malls and logistics operations, as they could diminish the economic impact of a coronavirus lockdown which they extended to May 16 Ministry of Health & Family Welfare
of Bangladesh, (2020). This ease of lockdown could worsen the ongoing community
transmission drastically. As we can see form Figure 11, the daily detected symptomatic
infected cases (confirmed) will reach the peak (about 2209) around June 11, 2020 and

then start to de-escalate. However, the probable peak time could occur in no time due
to easing the coronavirus lockdown too quickly and this could bring a second wave of
infections in the outbreak after post-peak period. The effective reproduction number is
around 3.5 as of May 11, which again lies in prior established ranges Anastassopoulou
et al., (2020); Liu et al., (2020). Our estimation is reasonably high which due to the
fact that we have considered the infectiousness factor of the asymptomatic carriers.
Massive level testing is highly required and recommended to identify the asymptomatic
spreaders quickly. Unlike other mitigation strategies like reporting contacts, putting on
face masks, and maintaining physical distancing, a massive test-and-isolate approach
could control the disease burden of COVID-19. Otherwise, this basic reproduction
number could increase upto 5.7 within 20 days and inhabitants of Bangladesh could
see a disease catastrophe in near future. In near future, owing to various changing
factors such as mitigation measures and mass people awareness such estimation and
projection could differ significantly.

6. Global Sensitivity Analysis
PRCC analysis which is a global sensitivity analysis method that calculates the
partial rank correlation coefficient for the model inputs (sampled by Latin hypercube
sampling method) and outputs Marino et al., (2008); Blower et al., (1994); Nabi et
al., (2020). The PRCC method assumes a monotonic relationship between the model
input parameters and the model outputs.
The calculated PRCC values are between -1 and 1 and they are comparable among
different model inputs. Quantitative relationship between the model input and model
response can be determined by calculating the PRCC values. A positive PRCC value
depicts that the model output can be increased by increasing the respective model
input parameter or vice versa. In addition, a negative PRCC value indicates a negative correlation between the model input and output. The magnitude of the PRCC
sensitivity measures the significance of the model input in contributing to the model
output.
As our proposed epidemic model contains a moderate number of empirical parameters, uncertainty analysis can give considerable insights regarding the quantitative relationship between model responses and model input parameters. However, it is really
challenging for complex models to determine the relationship with sufficient accuracy.

Importantly, we have got startling yet realistic results from our sensitivity analysis.
As we can see from Figure 12, we found nearly the same qualitative and significant
quantitative relationship between the number of symptomatic infectious individuals
(one of the crucial model responses) and three parameters which are rate of getting
quarantined of susceptible individuals (q), transition rate from exposed to infectious
or quarantined (κ) which can also be referred as the inverse of the average incubation period of COVID-19 and recovery rate of undetected asymptomatic (undetected)
infectious carriers for our proposed model.
In case of Russia, from Figure 12a recovery rate of undetected asymptomatic carriers (φU ) is the most negatively influential parameter when the number of detected
infectious individuals is our selected model response. The PRCC index is found to
be −0.585. In addition, rate of entering into home-quarantine or self-quarantine of
susceptible individuals (q) and the fraction of wrongly quarantined people who become susceptible after certain latent period (r1 ) are the other two influential empirical
features with PRCC indexes are −0.5672 and 0.567 respectively.
In case of Brazil, rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined of susceptible individuals (q), the fraction of quarantined people who become susceptible due
to avoiding home-quarantine (r1 ), and the inverse of the COVID-19 mean latent period are the most influential parameter on the symptomatic infectious population size
(ID (t)). The corresponding PRCC indices are −0.62, 0.53 and −0.499. The figure 12b
qualitatively elucidates that a high quarantine rate of the susceptible individuals can
curtail the number of symptomatic infected individuals. In broader view, high efficacy
of home or self-quarantine and a lower unlockdown rate could flatten the ID (t) curve
in Brazil.
In case of the India, rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined of susceptible individuals (q) and the inverse of the COVID-19 incubation period are the
most influential parameter on the symptomatic infectious population size (ID (t)) and
the corresponding PRCC indexes are −0.64 and −0.62. Both the parameters are negatively sensitive to the size of detected infected individuals which is illustrated in the
figure 12c. This elucidates that a higher quarantine rate of the susceptible individuals
can reduce the number of symptomatic infected individuals. Therefore, it is obvious
that early unlockdown in India could worsen the outbreak situation in the blink of an
eye.
In case of the UK, rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined of susceptible individuals (q) and the inverse of the COVID-19 incubation period are the most
influential parameter on the symptomatic infectious population size (ID (t)) and the
corresponding PRCC indices are −0.58 and −0.499. Both the parameters are negatively sensitive to the size of detected infected individuals which is illustrated in the
figure 12d. This elucidates that a higher quarantine rate of the susceptible individuals
can curtail the number of symptomatic infected individuals. Nevertheless, early easing
lockdown measures could bring a second wave of infection in the UK in no time.

For Bangladesh, it has been found in our analysis, home-quarantine rate is the most
negatively sensitive parameter on the size of symptomatic infectious individuals and the
corresponding PRCC index is −0.68 which is the highest among our five studied cases.
The result in Figure 12e elucidates that if the people in Bangladesh start breaking
social distancing restrictions extensively, then it would be difficult to control the disease
outbreak there. As of May 11, when Bangladesh is seeing continuous spikes in COVID19 infections every day, the government has announced an easing of movement for all
on a limited scale with a view to reviving the country’s economy. Moreover, the length
of the inverse of the latent period is the another negatively sensitive parameter with
PRCC index lying at −0.43.

We have proposed a methodology for the calibration of the key epidemiological
parameters as well as forecasting of the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic
in Russia, Brazil, India, Bangladesh and the UK, while considering publicly available
data from late January 2020 to early May 2020 with an introduction of an real-time
differential SEID IU QHRD epidemic model which can give more accurate, realistic and
precise short-term predictions. Baseline parameter ranges are chosen from the recent
clinical studies and relevant literature concerning the COVID-19 infection. Trustregion-reflective algorithm which is one of the robust least-squares fitting techniques,
has been deployed to calibrate the proposed model parameters. Numerical results on
the recent COVID-19 data from Russia, Brazil, India, Bangladesh and the UK have
been analyzed with an aim to determine probable peak dates and sizes for the above
mentioned countries. Based on the projection as of May 11, 2020, Russia will reach
the peak in terms of daily infected cases and death cases around end of May. Brazil
and India will reach the peak in terms of daily symptomatic infectious cases and death
cases around beginning of June. In addition, the United Kingdom might face a second
wave of infection provided that lockdown is lifted quickly. Global sensitivity analysis
results depict that home-quarantine or self-quarantine is the most effective measure for
controlling the transmission and spread of the novel coronavirus infection. To fade out
the pandemic, it is compulsory to identify potential carriers and asymptomatic infectious spreaders through and massive scale testing scheme and without sufficient level
of evidence of controlled low transmission rate of COVID-19 in any certain territory,
we cannot afford lifting up physical distancing measures.
