ABSTRACT
Background: Nasopharyngeal sampling has been the standard collection method for
COVID-19 testing. Due to its invasive nature and risk of contamination for health care
workers who collect the sample, non-invasive and safe sampling methods like saliva,
can be used alternatively.
Methods: A rapid systematic search was performed in PubMed and medRxiv, with the
last retrieval on June 6th, 2020. Studies were included if they compared saliva with
nasopharyngeal sampling for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the same RTqPCR applied on both types of samples. The primary outcome of interest was the
relative sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva versus nasopharyngeal samples
(used as the comparator test). A secondary outcome was the proportion of
nasopharyngeal-positive patients that tested also positive on a saliva sample.
Results: Eight studies were included comprising 1070 saliva-nasopharyngeal sample
pairs allowing assessment of the first outcome. The relative sensitivity of SARS-CoV2 testing on saliva versus nasopharyngeal samples was 0.97 (95% CI=0.92-1.02). The
second outcome incorporated patient data (n=257) from four other studies (n=97
patients) pooled with four studies from the first outcome (n=160 patients). This resulted
in a pooled proportion of nasopharyngeal positive cases that was also positive on
saliva of 86% (95% CI=77-93%).
Discussion: Saliva could potentially be considered as an alternative sampling method
when compared to nasopharyngeal swabs. However, studies included in this review
often were small and involved inclusion of subjects with insufficient information on
clinical covariates. Most studies included patients who were symptomatic (78%,
911/1167). Therefore, additional and larger studies should be performed to verify the
relative performance of saliva in the context of screening of asymptomatic populations
and

INTRODUCTION
Adequate testing for tracking and tracing of COVID-19 cases, is an effective strategy
to mitigate the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.1 Currently, collecting and testing
samples from lower respiratory tract (i.e. sputum or endotracheal aspirate) or upper
respiratory tract (i.e. nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs), are recommended for COVID-19
testing by the (European) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World
Health Organization.2,3 The collected specimen, preferably stored in a liquid storage
medium, is then sent to a laboratory for the detection of viral RNA using reverse
transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Before the SARSCoV-2 outbreak, studies related to SARS-CoV and other respiratory viruses, have
reported the potential use of saliva as a source for viral RNA testing.4–6 Biologically,
this can be explained by the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
receptors to which SARS-CoV-2 binds and that are present in epithelial cells of the oral
mucosa.7,8
The non-invasive nature of collecting saliva samples from suspected individuals
provides an advantage when compared to NP sample collection. Collection of saliva
samples requires individuals to either spit in a cup or swabbing the mucosa of the oral
cavity or tongue. This offers more comfort, ease and is quicker when compared to NP
swabs as the latter often leads to discomfort, pain and may sometimes lead to
bleeding.9 Furthermore, saliva sampling methods may be less aerosol-generating and
thereby reduces the risk of infection to health care workers responsible to take the
sample.10,11 Additionally, patients can collect saliva samples themselves without the
need of a physician or nurse.12 All these advantages make saliva collection more
suitable for repeated testing and may overcome certain barriers inherent to NP
sampling. To assess the diagnostic sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva
compared to NP swabs, we conducted a rapid systematic review.
METHODS
Study selection criteria
Studies were included if subjects were tested using a RT-qPCR method detecting RNA
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on saliva samples and NP samples. Covariates of interest
were: study design, severity of symptoms, hospitalization status, and timing of testing
(days after onset of symptoms). We only selected paired studies, where the two types
of specimen were collected from the same patients.
Systematic search
A rapid systematic search was performed using public bibliographic databases
containing peer-reviewed and non-peer reviewed articles from PubMed and medRxiv,
respectively. The reference lists from the included articles were also screened. In
addition, we verified the reference lists of other relevant reviews.10,12–19

Data analysis
Patient-paired data was used to construct 2x2 contingency tables (see template in
Table 1). The primary outcome of interest was the relative virological sensitivity of
SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva vs NP swabs. This relative sensitivity was calculated by
dividing the sensitivity of testing on saliva (SEN saliva+ =[a+b]/[a+b+c]) by the sensitivity
on NP swabs (SEN NP+ =[a+c]/[a+b+c]), assessed in populations where both types of
samples were collected at the same time. Given the paired design, the denominators
of the two proportions are the same and cancel each other out. Therefore, the relative
sensitivity SEN saliva+ / SEN NP+ resumes to the ratio=[a+b]/[a+c].The relative sensitivity
can take values from zero to infinity. A value below one indicates lower sensitivity on
saliva than on NP samples; a value above one indicates that testing on saliva is more
sensitive than on the NP swab.

A second outcome to be assessed, was the proportion of saliva-positive samples
among NP-positive swabs. The inclusion was restricted to patients being enrolled
based on a previous NP-positive swab or based on laboratory confirmed COVID-19
disease (a/[a+c], see Table 1). This proportion can take values from zero to 100%.
Meta-analytical pooling using random effect models was performed in Stata (Stat
version 16, StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). The procedure metan was
applied to pool ratios (i.e. relative sensitivity) and metaprop to pool proportions.20,21 A
continuity correction was applied when a cell of the contingency Table 1 contained a
zero value. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed by Cochran’s Q-test (p-value
below 0.05 was defined as statistically significant) and by the I² index that describes
the proportion of total heterogeneity due to inter-study variation.22 Possible influencing
covariates were: severity of symptoms, hospitalization status, confirmation status of
COVID-19 disease at enrollment and method to collect saliva (swabbing or spitting).
Patients who presented respiratory symptoms without dyspnea were categorized as
mild whereas patients admitted to an ICU (Intensive Care Unit) with or without the need
for oxygen treatment or who died, were categorized in the severe group.
RESULTS
Study selection and study characteristics
The last literature search on June 6th, 2020 yielded 12 studies of which 9 studies were
published in peer-reviewed journals and 3 studies in pre-print journals. In total 1167

patients were included, and 8/12 studies fulfilled the selection criteria for the first
outcome.11,23–29 Figure 1 summarizes the study selection process. The sample size of
these eight included studies varied from 11 to 501 (median=56) and comprised 1070
patients in total. Three hundred and sixteen patients were hospitalized of which 37
were admitted to an ICU (for the study of McCormick-Baw et al.25, this information was
unknown) and 754 were non-hospitalized. For the second outcome, we pooled the
data of eight studies from the first outcome (n=160 patients)23,24,27,28 together with the
data of four other studies (n=97 patients)30–33. Among these patients, 218 were
hospitalized and 39 were ambulant. More study characteristics are described in
Supplementary Table 1 and Table 2.

Outcome 1: relative sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva versus
nasopharyngeal samples
The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing was not significantly lower on saliva compared
to testing on NP swabs (pooled relative sensitivity was 0.97, 95% CI=0.92-1.02,
I²=24%) (Figure 2). The relative sensitivity did not differ significantly (p=0.242) by

method of saliva collection: 0.98 [95% CI=0.91-1.06] for spitting in vials and 0.94 [95%
CI=0.84-1.04] for oral swabbing (Figure 3).
The influence of the severity of disease on the relative sensitivity could not be assessed
appropriately by lack of strata-specific data. One study found a higher sensitivity in
saliva samples than in NP samples, although the 95% CI included unity (1.19, 95%
CI=0.96-1.46]. This study included only severe patients of which 43% were admitted
to ICU.27 The study of Jamal et al.24, which included patients with mild or severe
symptoms of which 34% was admitted to ICU, found that the sensitivity in saliva
samples was 14% lower compared to NP samples, although this was not significant
(0.86, 95% CI=0.71-1.03). In three studies, enrolling non-hospitalized patients with
mild symptoms, the pooled relative sensitivity was 0.98 (95% CI=0.92-1.04, p=0.476,
I²=0%).11,26,29 A small study enrolled paired samples from eight symptomatic and three
asymptomatic individuals all younger than 17 years, with an overall relative sensitivity
of 0.74 [95% CI 0.50-1.08]. The sensitivity on saliva in the symptomatic population was
75% (=6/8) versus 67% (=2/3) in the asymptomatic population.23 For two studies, there
was no clinical information on disease severity and they had a pooled relative
sensitivity of 0.97 (95% CI=0.91-1.03, I²=0%).25,28
Outcome 2: proportion of SARS-CoV-2 saliva-positive samples among
nasopharyngeal-positive samples
SARS-CoV-2 saliva positivity was reported in four studies that enrolled only NPpositive patients30–33. Four other studies from the first outcome that enrolled only
COVID-19 confirmed patients23,24,27,28 were also included in this assessment. The
pooled proportion of saliva-positive samples among NP-positive cases was 86% (95%
CI=77-93%, Figure 4). There was substantial heterogeneity among the studies
(I²=66%, p<0.05). The highest proportion was found in the group with exclusively
severe disease (93%, 95% CI=85-98%). A lower proportion was found in the mixed
group with mild and severe disease (73%, 95% CI=63-83%) which was similar to the
proportion of the other mixed group with symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (73%,
95% CI=43-90%). The results of To et al.31 could be further separated between mild
and severe disease which resulted in a slightly higher proportion of saliva-positive
samples among severe cases (88%, 95% CI=53-98%) compared to mild cases (85%,
95% CI=58-96%, p=0.85).

average 14% of patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 using NP swabs tested
negative when a saliva sampling method was used.
Limitations of the systematic review
The retrieved literature focuses mainly on the virological sensitivity to detect a SARSCoV-2 infection in different specimens. Additionally, there may have been implicit
differences in method of collection, laboratories and equipment used that could not be
investigated thoroughly due to limited information available. Besides, specificity to
exclude an infection was rarely reported. Specificity is also an important parameter to
consider particularly in situations where the pandemic is less prevalent and testing is
used primarily for screening and contact-tracing purposes.
The estimation of the virological accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva is only
reliable when the RT-qPCR assays themselves are properly validated. This will further
be evaluated in the VALCOR (“VALidation of SARS-CORona Virus-2 assays”) study
which is currently ongoing in Belgium.34 The included studies comprised a
heterogeneous case mix of subjects (from asymptomatic to patients with severe
symptoms admitted to ICU). However, the sources of heterogeneity could not be
assessed by lack of separate test results stratified by covariates. Furthermore, we
encountered a lack of data for the second outcome with regard to the specifications of
the RT-qPCR assays (i.e. manufacturer’s name and target genes) that have been used
for the confirmation of on NP samples. Therefore, it might be possible that the RTqPCR that has been used a priori on NP samples was different from the assay applied
on saliva samples and hence causes biases.
Certain studies23,32 showed that the viral load was lower in saliva than on NP, whereas
Wyllie et al.27 found a higher viral load in saliva. In order to extend our findings with
information on the timing of collection, we propose to investigate the difference in viral
load and duration of viral shedding between saliva and NP swabs when more studies
with larger sample sizes are published.
Our study results must be interpreted with caution. In particular, we cannot assure that
SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva is sufficiently sensitive among recovering patients or
among asymptomatic individuals.
Inherent to meta-analyses based on pooling of aggregated information published in
papers, the role of covariates often cannot be evaluated precisely by the lack of
homogenously stratified data.35 It might be worthwhile to perform individual-patient
data (IPD) meta-analyses. However, obtaining IPD is difficult and biases may occur
when only a limited number of authors consent to sharing data.
More studies with alternative procedures for sample collection and specimen handling,
spanning a wide range of patient groups, including asymptomatic individuals,
preferentially with similar protocols are needed in order to facilitate future pooling and

enhance our understanding of using different samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing. The
number of studies contributing to our meta-analyses is small, precluding formal
statistical assessment of publication bias. However, given the very high desirability to
find quicker, safer and more comfortable collection procedures, publication bias can
be presumed. In line with this, preliminary results in the Belgian federal task force led
study on saliva (n=2000) indicates that viral load is lower in saliva than in NP swab
transport medium (using Cq as a proxy for viral load), and that good correspondence
between saliva and NP swab is only observed for medium to high viral loads in NP
(manuscript in preparation).
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we found that SARS-CoV-2 testing by RT-qPCR on saliva appears to
be as sensitive as NP swabs. However, the quality of included studies often was low
and lacked stratified data, which impeded assessment of the sources of heterogeneity.
Therefore, results from our study should be interpreted with caution. More information
is needed before saliva can be recommended as a valid diagnostic alternative for NP
samples.
