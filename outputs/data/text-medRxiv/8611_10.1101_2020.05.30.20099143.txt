ABSRACT
The COVID-19 disease, a respiratory disease transmitted by a new betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
As for other viral respiratory agents, SARS-CoV-2 spreads by person to person through respiratory
droplets and direct contact and potentially by indirect contact through fomites. The goal of the
current study is to evaluate whether the increase of temperature can influence the environmental
endurance of SARS-CoV-2.
We tested SARS-CoV-2 environmental stability in parallel at room temperature (RT, 20°C-25°C)
and at average maximum temperature of June (JT) estimated at 28°C in Italy. The virus inoculated on
plastic surface was harvested at predefined time-points and tested to evaluate viral titres on Vero cells
by TCID50.
Our results confirm that fomite transmission of the emerging SARS-CoV2 is possible, since the virus
remains viable on surfaces up to 84 hours at both RT and JT. Moreover, a remarkable difference
between the two temperatures exists, suggesting that virus vitality can be influenced by the
environmental temperature.
Our results support the hypothesis that in the hot season the increase of temperature could influence
the environmental endurance of SARS-CoV2 and reduce Covid-19 transmission probability.

OBJECTIVES
Corona VIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
COVID-19 is caused by the enveloped betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, transmitted person to person
through respiratory droplets and direct contact, and potentially by indirect contact through fomites
(1).
Clinically, patients with COVID-19 present with respiratory symptoms, which is very similar to the
presentation of other respiratory virus infections. Radiologically, COVID-19 is characterized by
multifocal ground-glass opacities, even for patients with mild disease. The case-fatality rate of this
disease has been calculated as 7% (2).

As of 17 May 2020, 4,534,731 cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, including 307,537
deaths. In Europe, 1,870,545 cases have been reported, with United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany
and France as the five most reporting countries. In Italy, 224,760 cases were reported and 31,763
deaths, with a 14.1% mortality rate higher rates among elderly patients and patients with
comorbidities.
Lockdown restrictions have been introduced in many countries in response to the spread of SARSCoV-2 to control this emerging global health threat. In Italy, the lockdown started on March 9, 2020,
when Italian citizens were strictly encouraged to take preventive measures and maintain social
distancing. The lockdown measures have permitted hospitals and medical centers successfully
handling patients flow to local hospitals, and addressing issues about hospital beds, overcrowding in
emergency departments, and patients transfer to other specialized facilities. All the national
administrators of websites have encouraged companies to offer free online services, and educational
institutions and universities adopted e-learning methods. Moreover, any data or updates on COVID19 have been made available for free to general public. As of 4 May 2020, Italy entered phase two of
the COVID-19 emergency, with the start of the gradual relaxation of the lockdown measures, but the
contagion risk remains high.
Several studies have shown that viral spread could be influenced by climatic conditions since
enveloped viruses tend to reduce their circulation in summertime owing to high temperature and solar
radiation (3, 4). No wonder, current spread of COVID-19 along the equator and tropics has been
significantly less (5). The world is waiting the summer with the hope that the increase of temperature
will influence the environmental endurance of SARS-CoV-2.
In Italy, phase two of the emergency is close to the summer, and the increase of temperature may
reduce COVID-19 prevalence. In order to try to predict the effect on the epidemic dynamic of
COVID-19 during the next months, we decided to test SARS-CoV-2 environmental stability in
parallel at room temperature (RT, 20°C-25°C) and at average maximum temperature of June (JT)
estimated at 28°C in Italy.

METHODS
The strain BetaCov/Italy/CDG1/2020|EPI ISL 412973|2020-02-20 (6) was used to test SARS-Cov-2
stability on plastic surface (polypropylene).
The viral preparation was spotted in droplets of 10 μl on 24-well plates and let 30 minutes to dry.
Then, plates were incubated at both RT and JT for 7 days at relative humidity of 35–45%
(airconditioned room). The virus was harvested at t= 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96 hours by
adding 1 ml/well of MEM + 2% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) and quantified by end-point titration on
Vero cells by TCID50,. In brief, 96-well plates were inoculated with two-fold dilutions of each viral
sample (100 μl), and 22,000 cells/well in MEM + 2% FCS were added (100 μl). Plates were left in
incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 6 days and checked daily to observe the cytopathic effect (CPE).
The 50% endpoint titers have been determinate using the Spearman-Karber method. Both the
experiments were conducted in three independent replicates.
Viral titre of the daily collections (0, 24, 48, 72 hours) at RT were determined also by plaque assay in
Vero E6 cells. Briefly, 12-well plates were plated with Vero E6 cells (150,000/well in MEM +10%
FCS) and inoculated with logarithmic dilutions of each sample. Plates were incubated 1 hour at 37°C,
and 4 ml/well of a medium containing 2% Gum Tragacanth + MEM 2.5% FCS were added. After 5
days at 37°C with 5% CO2, titres were calculated by crystal violet dyeing in plaque-forming units per
milliliter (PFU/ml).
Standard deviation (SD) of three wells at different time from 0 to 84 hours was performed in order to
visualize the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean.

RESULTS
The strain BetaCov/Italy/CDG1/2020|EPI ISL 412973|2020-02-20 used to test SARS-Cov-2 stability
in vitro had an initial viral titre of 106.8 TCID50/ml, a comparable viral load of symptomatic,
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients (7). Contaminated surfaces are known to be
significant vectors in the transmission of infections and survival of viruses on a variety of fomites has

been demonstrated for influenza viruses, paramyxoviruses, poxviruses, and retroviruses (8, 9). Our
study confirms that fomite transmission of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 is possible (10), since the
virus remains viable on plastic surfaces up to 84 hours at both RT and JT. In both the experimental
conditions, the virus is not detectable anymore at 96 hours.
Results by end-point titration show that the virus vitality on plastic surface rapidly declined by more
than 1 log10 in TCID50 during the first 24-36 hours, at RT. This trend is confirmed by titration by
plaque assay (Appendix). At JT the same decay was observed more rapidly (between 8 and 12
hours), indicating that viral infectivity can be influenced by higher temperature. A remarkable
difference between the two temperatures exists, suggesting that virus vitality can be influenced by the
environmental temperature (Figure). In this study, 95% of confidence interval (CI) was considered
statistically significant (Appendix).

CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study support the hypothesis that in the hot season the increase of temperature may
influence the environmental endurance of the SARS-CoV-2 and reduce COVID-19 transmission
probability. Accordingly, we can assume that the incoming summer might help decline of the number
of infected people limiting the risk of new outbreaks of Covid-19.
However, these results should be interpreted with caution and do not influence the need of
maintaining social distancing measures.
