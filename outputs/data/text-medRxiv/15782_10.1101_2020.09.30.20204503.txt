Abstract
Background
Since its emergence in December 2019, the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic resulted
in a profound impact on the health care system worldwide. We propose herein to evaluate the
impact of implementing conservative management as an alternative approach to surgical
appendectomy in the treatment of proven acute appendicitis during COVID19 pandemic.
Methods
Our study is a prospective multicenter study that includes a cohort of 160 patients admitted to the
surgical departments in both Tawam Hospital and Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City, Abu Dhabi,
UAE, for the period from February 2020 till July 2020.
Results
Our results showed that 56 of our patients (35%) were treated conservatively, while the other 104
(65%) underwent operative management. There was a significant decrease in length of hospital
stay (LOS) (2.32±0.83 days) among the first group compared to the second (2.8±1.47 days).
Also, short term follow-up showed that 90% of those patients did not require further operative
intervention or developed any serious complications. Out of the 110 patients that were swapped
for COVID19, nine (8.18%) were confirmed to be positive. Our protocol was to avoid surgical
management for COVID19 positive patients unless indicated. This resulted in (8/9) of COVID19
positive patients to be treated conservatively. Follow up was achieved by using telemedicinebased follow-up with the aim of empowering social distancing and reducing risk of viral
exposure to patients as well as the health care providers. In conclusion, our results showed that
the implementation of conservative management in treating patients with acute appendicitis who
were COVID19 positive is a safe and feasible approach that maybe essential in reducing viral
transmission risks as well as avoiding operative risks on COVID19 positive patients.

Introduction
The pandemic of COVID-19 and its associated massive inflow of patients affected many aspects
of life with special impact on the health care system(1). The overload of hospitals with COVID19 patients resulted in changing priorities for the benefit of patients as well as health care
providers (2). Also, due to the nature of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) that was
found to spread during aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) including surgeries, many
concerns were raised on infection control and safety on patients as well as health care providers'
(3, 4). For that reason, changes in the management protocols and implementations of new
guidelines along with novel practices were recommended with the aim of reducing the risk of
infection as well as establishing more efficient use of the available resources. One of the
strategies proposed to relieve the burden on the health care system is to avoid hospitalization and
defer other non-urgent surgeries.
Acute appendicitis represents one of the most common cause of surgical emergencies and acute
abdomen with a lifetime prevalence reaching to 7%(5). The golden standard management plan
for such patients is surgical appendectomy (6). However, emerging evidence showed that the
conservative non-surgical alternative management by antibiotic therapy might have same impact
on the patient's outcome(6-9). Such approach might have additional advantages compared to the
surgical approach including the omission of surgery associated mortality and morbidity including
pain, infections and bowel obstruction as well as risks and complications associated with
anesthesia and hospitalization(10).
Implementation of conservative management in acute appendicitis may represent an optimal
option during the COVID19 pandemic due to its advantages in reducing the length of hospital
stay (LOS) and avoiding surgical management with all its risks(11). In addition, patients
diagnosed with novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may also benefit from such
approach due to the fact that they are more vulnerable to the complications owing to their
compromised lung functions as well as suppressed immunity and multiple organ
dysfunction(12). Moreover, such approach might impact the safety of the staff and health care
providers through reduction of their exposure to COVID19 patients.

Here we investigate the effects of implementing conservative approach for the management of
acute appendicitis on patient's outcomes including, length of hospital stay (LOS), duration
ofantibiotics use, cost, complications and recurrence, during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Patients and methods
Our study is a prospective multicenter study that included recruitment of patients admitted to the
surgical departments in two tertiary referral university hospitals ( Tawam Hospital and Sheikh
Shakhbout Medical City ) in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, for the period
from February 2020 till July 2020. All the epidemiological, clinical as well as the laboratory data
of the patients were retracted from Abu Dhabi Health Services Co. (SEHA)electronic file
system. This research obtained ethical approval from Abu Dhabi COVID19 Research IRB
Committee with reference no. DOH/NCVDC/2020/1045. Our study was performed according to
the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines
for observational studies.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive patients' data including demographic and laboratory parameters were tabulated and
presented as mean and standard deviation in the case of continuous variables. In contrast,
frequencies and percentages were used in case of categorical variables. SPSS 26.0
(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) software was used for statistical analysis. A p-value of <0.05
was used as a cut-off value to differentiate between significant and non-significant differences.
Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test, in addition to student's t-test as well as analysis of
variance (ANOVA) test were used whenever needed.

Results
Patients demographic features
Our cohort consists of 160 patients. The mean age of our patients was 29.61± 10.33, with the
majority of them being male patients (63.12%) and female patients representing (36.87%). The
mean duration of hospitalization was 2.7± 1.42 days. In addition to clinical evaluation, CT scan
was the most common imaging method to confirm the diagnosis (71.15%), followed by US
(19.23%). Other demographic and clinical features are described in table 1.
Management option
Out of the 160 patients, 56 patients (35%) were treated conservatively, the other 104 (65%)
underwent surgical management. Analysis of the demographic features of both groups revealed
no significant difference in the age and sex distribution between both groups (Table 1). Worth
mentioning that the group with initial conservative treatment was shown to have smaller size of
the appendix (9.78±2.79mm) compared to the surgical management group (11.14±3.82) (P=
0.045). Appendicolith was confirmed to be present in 32.09% of the surgical managed group
compared to only 16% in the conservatively managed group (P=0.04). As expected, patients with
conservative management plan had a significant decrease in length of hospital stay (LOS)
(2.32±0.83 days) compared to patients that underwent surgical management (2.8±1.47 days). In
contrast, the conservatively managed group had longer duration of antibiotic coverage that
reached in total to 9.6±1.65 days compared to only 1.08±0.63 days for patients who were
surgically managed (P=<0.000001). Moreover, the mean total cost per patient for the
conservative approach was significantly lower (5804±6254 United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED)
compared to (9423±5812 AED) for the surgical approach.

COVID19 status
During the initial phase of COVID19 pandemic (period from February-March, 2020), only 2% of
the patients were swabbed for COVID-19. This rate increased to 99.12% in the period from April
2020 onward (Figure1). In total, out of the 160 patients, COVID19 PCR swab test was
performed for 110 patients. Nine of those patients (8.18%) were confirmed to be COVID19
positive and the other 101 (91.81%) were confirmed to be negative. Our policy was to avoid
surgical management for COVID19 positive patients unless indicated. For that reason, the
majority (8/9) of patients that were confirmed to be COVID19 positive, were treated
conservatively (Table 1).

Patients discharge and short outcome
Monitoring of patients from the time of admission until discharge revealed that both groups of
patients showed a similar pattern of improvement that was evident in the improvement of the
clinical exam as well as laboratory profile (Table 2). Among the inflammatory markers, our
results showed that white blood count (WBC) count was a more sensitive parameter in predicting
the clinical improvement compared to the C-reactive protein (CRP) (Table 2). Indeed, WCC was
found to be reduced in the operative group from 12.425±4.636 at time of admission to
8.542±2.553 at the time of patient’s discharge (P=0.00006). Similarly, the WCC was also found
to be significantly reduced in the conservatively treated group from 11.929±4.313 to 5.331±
1.516 at time of discharge (P=9.32587e-15).

Discussion
Since its emergence in December 2019, COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a profound impact on
the health systems worldwide(13). The impact of this disease on surgical practices was also
significant. This includes its effect on the surgical workforce and hospitals' infrastructures(14).
Many actions were implemented to improve our response to the disease pandemic with the aim
of protecting our patients as well as our health-care providers in addition to increasing hospitals
bed capacity to insure a more dynamic use of the available resources(15). One of the main
actions taken was surgical prioritization with delaying and deferring hospitalization of nonurgent procedures(15). For that reason, we investigated the effects of implementing conservative
approach and compare it to the classical surgical approach in the treatment of confirmed acute
appendicitis and its impact on patient’s outcome during COVID-19 pandemic. Our results
showed that the implementation of the non-surgical approach resulted in a significant
improvement in the clinical presentation and the inflammatory profile of patients, in addition to
the reduction in the length of hospital stay (LOS)indicating high success rate. Furthermore, short
term follow up of those patients showed that the majority (90%) did not need further operative
intervention or develop serious complications. Indeed, this correlates well with other reports
implementing conservative management in acute appendicitis to be associated with shorter
hospital stay and a low risk of late recurrence(16-18). This clearly demonstrated that the
conservative approach for the management of acute appendicitis represents a feasible, safe and
effective alternative to the surgical approach. In addition, our finding revealed that the mean
cost of conservative management was around half of the cost of the surgical management. This
compares well with other reports that also showed less financial cost of conservative approach
compared to the surgical one(16-21). It helped in reducing the financial burdens on patients as
well as the healthcare system. Our results showed that (8.18%) of the swapped patients in our
cohort were confirmed to be COVID19 positive without classical respiratory symptoms like
cough and fever highlighting the importance of our modified protocol that includes testing all
patients admitted to our department during the COVID19 pandemic. In addition, our approach
resulted in reduction in the number of patients presenting with acute abdomen, who tested
positive for COVID19 and needed surgical intervention to only 1 patient (11.11%) out of the 9
COVID19 patients. This is essential in reducing the possible preoperative, intraoperative and

postoperative viral transmission risks(14). Conservative approach is also essential in reducing
the risk of surgery related complications in COVID19 patients who were found to suffer from
higher mortality rates following different types of surgeries including minor procedures(22). This
is attributed to their compromised lung functions, in addition to multiple organ dysfunction(12).
Interestingly, our protocol also included the implementation of telemedicine-based follow-up as
a feasible and safe approach for follow up and evaluation of patient outcome. Such practices
might be beneficial for both patients and healthcare providers through empowering social
distancing to reduce the risk of viral transmission as well as reducing the pressure on the health
care system.

In conclusion, our results showed that the implementation of conservative management in
treating patients with acute appendicitis who were COVID19 positive is a safe and feasible
approach that maybe essential in reducing preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative viral
transmission risks as well as avoiding operative risks on COVID19 positive patients. Longer
follow-ups to determine the true recurrence rate among the conservatively treated group as well
as a larger number of patients might be needed in future studies.
