Questions: What is the pooled diagnostic accuracy of FDA authorized serology tests to detect

49

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies?

50

Findings: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of seven reports from FDA authorized

51

serology tests to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV2 antibodies (3336 patients/ samples)

52

pooled sensitivity was 87%, and pooled specificity was almost 100%. There was a wide variation

53

in test performance based on the duration between the onset of symptoms and the tests.

54

Meaning: FDA authorized tests are highly accurate to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2

55

antibodies if tests are performed under a similar condition, as presented in the original report.

56

There is a wide variation in the test performance based on the time interval between the onset of

57

symptoms to the tests.

Abstract:

71

Importance: Serology tests are diagnostic and complementary to molecular tests during the

72

COVID-19 pandemic.

73

Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FDA authorized serology tests for the

74

detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

75

Data sources: A search of MEDLINE, SCOPUS, CINAHL Plus, and EMBASE up to April 4,

76

2020, was performed to identify studies using the "COVID 19 testing" and "meta-analysis." FDA

77

website was accessed for the list of tests for emergency use authorization (EUA).

78

Study Selection: Manufacturer reported serology tests published in the FDA website were

79

selected. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the selected reports.

80

Data extraction and synthesis: The meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the

81

PRISMA guidelines. A bivariate analysis using the "random-effects model" was applied for

82

pooled summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and the summary receiver operating

83

characteristic curves.

84

Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the serology

85

test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subgroup analysis of the diagnostic accuracy with lag

86

time between symptom onset and testing were studied.

87

Results: Seven manufacturer listed reports were included. The pooled sensitivity was 87% (95%

88

CI, 78% - 93%), the pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI, 97% - 100%), and the area under the

89

hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.97. At ≤ 7 days, sensitivity

90

was 44% (95% CI, 21% - 70%), and for 8-14 days, sensitivity was 84% (95% CI, 67 % - 94%).

91

For blood draws ≥ 15 days after the onset of symptoms, sensitivity was 96% (95% CI, 93% -

92

98%). Heterogeneity was substantial, and the risk of bias was low in this analysis.

93
94

Conclusions and relevance: FDA authorized serology tests demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy

95

for SARS-CoV-2 infection (certainty of evidence: moderate). There is a wide variation in the test

96

accuracy based on the duration between the onset of symptoms and the tests (certainty of

97

evidence: low).

Background:
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a current global threat, and diagnostic tests are

118

critical. COVID-19 was discovered in Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, caused by a

119

pathogen of unknown origin,1,2 which was subsequently named severe acute respiratory

120

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 has currently caused a pandemic. 3, 4 The

121

genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was added to the GenBank sequence repository on January

122

10, 2020, 2,5 which enabled laboratories across the world to develop and use reverse

123

transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for the diagnosis. Both the World Health

124

Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend an

125

RT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 6,7

126

SARS- CoV-2 is a new pathogen in humans, so there are no antibodies found in a person

127

not exposed to this virus. 7 The rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent-phase sera

128

tested in parallel is definite evidence of the viral infection. 7 Seroconversion after SARS-CoV-2

129

infection appears as early as the fourth day after the onset of symptoms, 8 but can be delayed

130

beyond 15 days. 9 Previous publications have supported the use of serological tests for the

131

detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 9,10 WHO has affirmed the use of seroconversion or an

132

increase in antibody titer for the diagnosis of SARS- CoV-2. 7 However, the CDC does not

133

recommend serological tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Nonetheless, the Food and Drug

134

Administration (FDA) has authorized emergency use authorizations (EUA) for diagnostic

135

serological tests for COVID-19 6, 11 as a valuable tool for the management of this pandemic.

136

Serological tests offer several advantages including (1) contact tracing; (2) serologic

137

surveillance; (3) identification of those who have already had the virus infection and thus may (if

138

there is protective immunity) be immune; 12 (4) to identify individuals as a potential source for

139

convalescent serum treatments (currently an experimental treatment or prophylaxis); 13, 14 (5) to

140

do epidemiological researches; (6) theoretically to diagnose a person in a late stage of disease

141

when RT- PCR may be false negative; 15 and (7) evaluation and development of a vaccine. 15,16

142

With the novel Coronavirus surge, testing brings challenges with variability in

143

performance, including sensitivity and specificity. 15 Therefore, the purpose of this review was to

144

evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the FDA authorized diagnostic serological tests for SARS-

145

CoV-2 infection.

146

Methods

147

Literature search

148

We used the FDA website to search for all FDA authorized, under emergency use

149

authorization (EUA), in-vitro serology diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2. We performed a search

150

for systematic reviews up to April 4, 2020, using the term "COVID 19 testing" and “meta-

151

analysis” in the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. This

152

search was limited to publication in the "English" language.

153

Inclusion criteria

154

We included all FDA authorized diagnostic serological tests (before April 26, 2020)

155

available to use in the United States of America. We collected information from the

156

authorization reports, either the manufactures' instructions/package insert. 11 Inclusions also had

157

the following criteria: index test must include qualitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2

158

antibodies [Immunoglobulin G (IgG) or Immunoglobulin M (IgM), or both], and target condition

159

must be confirmed by RT-PCR (the reference standard).

160
161

Exclusion criteria

162

(1) Serology tests not authorized by the FDA; (2) serology tests not authorized for diagnostic

163

use; (3) molecular tests authorized by the FDA.

164

Data extraction and quality assessment

165

Two authors (RP and AG) reviewed all eligible reports and extracted the data

166

independently. Disagreements between the researchers were resolved by consensus. We

167

extracted the following data: (1) manufacturer of the test; (2) settings including sample size,

168

disease status at the time of specimen collection, other clinical contexts available in the report;

169

(3) information regarding test-assay methods, specimens used; and (4) data on a true positive,

170

false positive, false negative and true negative. There was a complete agreement on the final data

171

used in the analysis.

172

We assessed the methodological quality of each study by following the guidelines from the

173

Cochrane Screening and Diagnostic Test Methods Group, a tool adapted from the QUADAS-2.

174

The four domains assessed for risk of bias were patient selection, index test, reference standard,

175

and flow and timing. We assessed the applicability concerns in the first three domains. In each

176

domain, we answered the signaling questions with 'Yes,' ‘No,’ or ‘Unclear.’ For each domain,

177

the risk of bias was judged as ‘Low,’ ‘High,’ or ‘Unclear’ risk. One review author assessed study

178

quality, which a second review-author verified. We summarized the overall quality of evidence

179

using the GRADE methodology recommended for diagnostic tests. The assessment of

180

publication bias was not applicable based on our research design.

Data synthesis and analysis
We constructed 2x 2 tables for all reports based on dichotomous data from the reference

184

standard (positive or negative). We performed data analysis using methods described in the

185

Cochrane Handbook of Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) Reviews. 17 We created forest plots

186

with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for sensitivity and specificity for each study using Review

187

Manager 5. 18 Summary statistics of four sets of primary data, namely true positive (TP), false

188

positive (FP), false negative (FN), and true negative (TN), were analyzed. Seroconversion,

189

which determines the accuracy of tests, after SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the time interval

190

between the onset of disease and testing. 9, 19, 20 To address the test accuracy and variation in

191

sensitivity of tests with the lag time, we performed subgroup analysis for tests done at (1) at or

192

before 7days; (2) between 8-14 days and (3) at or after 15 days after the onset of symptoms. A

193

bivariate random-effects model was used for summary effect size, and Area under curve (AUC)

194

using R software version 3.2. 21, 22 This bivariate model takes account into binomial distribution

195

for directly modeling sensitivity and specificity for within-study variations, and assumes

196

bivariate normal distribution for between-study variation. 23 We used inverse variance when

197

calculating the weights of individual studies. The DerSimonian-Laird estimator was used when

198

calculating between- study variations for statistical assumptions and conservative estimates. The

199

confidence interval was estimated by the Clopper-Pearson method. Heterogeneity was

200

categorized as follows: not important (0% - 40%); moderate (30% - 60%), substantial (50% -

201

90%); and considerable (75% - 100%). 24 In addition to ROC, the Spearman’s correlation

202

coefficient (Rho) between the sensitivity and false-positive rates was calculated for the presence

203

of “cut-off” point (≥ 0.6). 25 GRADEpro software was used to create a summary of findings

205

published by the FDA.

206

Results

207

The systematic literature search yielded no meta-analysis on serological tests for SARS-

208

CoV-2 infection as of April 4, 2020. A total of 48 EUA summaries were identified from the FDA

209

website accessed on April 25, 2020, of which seven reports which met eligibility criteria were

210

included (eFigure 1 in the supplement).

211

Characteristics of the included reports

212

All seven studies are exclusively obtained from the FDA website. Information was

213

collected from the information for use (IFU) documents. The characteristics of the included

214

reports are summarized in Table 1.

215

The sample sizes in each report ranged from 70 to 1166 (total n = 3336). Five reports

216

used a qualitative detection of IgM, IgG, or both antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2, while the

217

remaining two used qualitative detection for the detection of IgG only. Demographics such as

218

age, ethnicity, gender were not available. Comorbidities of the patients who tested positive for

219

SARS-CoV-2 infection were unknown. As the cases are rising rapidly, there was no information

220

available regarding the prevalence of the disease.

221

There was an incomplete and variable reporting of the time interval between the onset of

222

symptoms and the test. Autobio® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Test had information on the timing

223

of the test relative to the onset of symptoms while Cellex® qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test

224

did not have such information. Chembio DPP® COVID-19 IgM/IgG System test had information

225

on days of blood samples collected from symptom onset in COVID patients. LIAISON® SARS-

226

CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG had information on the lag time between the onset of symptoms and the tests.

227

They performed serial tests, up to three times, for negative results. We used only the first of the

228

serial measurements in this review. Mount Sinai Laboratory COVID-19 ELISA IgG Antibody

229

Test had information on the timing of sample collection (7 to 14 days after onset of symptoms

230

and retested at 21 days if the initial test was negative). VITROS® Anti-SARS-CoV-2G had

231

information on all patients. But we did not include in our sub-group analysis as their reported

232

time did not fit into our proposed analysis. VITROS®Anti-SARS-CoV2T had information on 15

233

out of 30 subjects. The characteristics of included reports are summarized in table 1. We believe

234

the seven studies provided overall good methodological quality and low risk of bias (Figure 1).

235

See supplemental material for details of the risk of bias assessment (eFigure 2 in the

236

supplement).

237

Diagnostic performance of serology tests

238

The sensitivity of the individual tests ranged from 54% to 94% and specificity ranged

239

from 90% to 100%. We created a coupled forest plot with 95 % confidence interval for

240

individual reports with sensitivity and specificity (Figure 2). The total effect size sensitivity

241

(pooled sensitivity) of all seven studies by the random-effects model was 87% (95% CI, 78% to

242

93%) (eFigure 3 in the supplement). The Higgins’ I2 was 86%, and the Cochrane Q statistic was

243

60; p < 0.001, which suggests substantial heterogeneity. The total effect size specificity (pooled

244

specificity) of all seven studies by the random-effects model was 100% (95% CI, 97% to 100%)

245

(eFigure 4 in the supplement). The Higgins’ I2 was 93%, and the Cochrane Q statistic was 26; p

246

< 0.002, which suggests considerable heterogeneity. AUC for the SROC was significant (0.97)

247

(Figure 3). The Spearman’s correlation coefficient between the sensitivity and specificity was

248

negative 0.6, also indicating the presence of an implicit cut-off points. Overall, the diagnostic

249

accuracy of the test was 96% (95% CI, 95% to 97%). The number needed to diagnose was 1.2

250

(95% CI, 1.1 to 1.2). Around 12 persons need to be tested to return 10 positive tests.

251

Subgroup analysis

252

Subgroup analysis detected a notable variation on test sensitivity depending on the timing

253

of blood drawn after the onset of symptoms (lag time). At ≤ 7days (51 samples, 4 reports),

254

sensitivity was 44% (95% CI, 21% to 70%), for 8-14 days (152 samples, 5 reports), sensitivity

255

was 84% (95% CI, 67% to 94%). For blood draws ≥ 15 days after the onset of symptoms (329

256

samples, 3 reports), sensitivity was 96% (95% CI, 93% to 98%) (Table 2).

257

Discussion

258

Pooled sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 100 % support that the FDA authorized

259

serology tests are useful in ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection if the tests are done under similar

260

conditions as conducted in the reports. We noticed variations in testing time from the onset of

261

symptoms as well as serial measurements on some reports. Although heterogeneity of specificity

262

was higher (93%) compared to those of sensitivity (86%), SROC curve with less scattering of

263

test values and moderate Spearman’s correlation coefficient of negative 0.59 validates these

264

studies. The diagnostic accuracy and the number needed to diagnose reflect the strength of the

265

serology tests.

266

After the onset of infection with SARS-CoV-2, seroconversion occurs variably, ranging

267

from days to weeks. 27 Zhao J et al. 9 showed empirical evidence for the role of antibody titers

268

with a lag time similar to our study findings. In that study, among 173 patients, the median

269

duration for IgM and IgG antibodies seroconversion was 12 days and 14 days, respectively.

270

Moreover, less than 40% had antibody detected within the first week of illness. In another study

271

of 285 patients, median seroconversion was 13 days for IgG, with 100% positive within 19 days

272

of symptoms. 19 IgM antibodies are detectable earlier than IgG antibody (208 plasma sample:

273

IgM median 5 (IQR, 3-6 days) versus IgG median 14(IQR, 10-18 days). 20 We found an increase

274

in test sensitivity with an increase in time between the illness and the test [sensitivity 96% for

275

tests done ≥ 15 days from symptom onset (Table 2)]. This high sensitivity finding from only

276

three reports warrants validation from more extensive studies. Negative tests, on appropriate

277

clinical settings, should be interpreted with caution, mostly if the tests are done early in the

278

courses of the disease.

279

Cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with other proteins in the blood is under

280

investigation. Reports of false-positive test results are published. 28 29 Cross-reactivity between

281

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with other known antibodies were tested in all reports. Chembio DPP®

282

COVID-19 IgM/IgG System reported cross-reactivity against human coronavirus HKU1 and

283

human coronavirus 229E. LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG reported cross-reactivity against

284

the Hepatitis B Virus, Anti-Influenza A, and rheumatoid factors. These cross-reactivity

285

limitations should be considered while interpreting positive tests.

286

Limitations

287

Information on the study population is not available to critically appraise individual

288

reports. We could not verify the spectrum bias. Per protocol, we limited our search to FDA

289

authorized serology tests for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. None of the serology

290

tests have been independently verified for accuracy by the FDA. Five reports used detection of

291

IgG or IgM or both, and the remaining two used detection of IgG only for the diagnosis of

292

SARS-CoV-2. We accepted the threshold detection of antibodies as defined by individual

293

reports.

294

Heterogeneity could not be explained by threshold as the serology tests were qualitative.

295

Heterogeneity was substantial. We could not perform meta-regression or sensitivity analysis as

296

limited information was available. Higher heterogeneity in this review can arise from chance,

297

patient selection, and the type of diagnostic test.

298

We found a significant area under the curve (AUC), which represents the global summary

299

performance of the test. The symmetric shoulder of SROC represents the variability in the

300

studies and the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

301

Conclusions

302

WHO and CDC recommend RT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both

CDC and WHO agree that serology tests play a pivotal role in the COVID-19 pandemic

304

considering cost, diagnostic accuracy, and relatively quick results. The overall sensitivity and

305

specificity of the FDA authorized serological tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection are high

306

(certainty of evidence: moderate). There is a wide variation in the test accuracy based on the

307

duration between the onset of symptoms and the tests (certainty of evidence: low).

COD – Country of development
RDT – Rapid Diagnostic test, ELISA – Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay
TP – True Positive, FN – False Negative, FP - False Positive, TN – True Negative
Autobio® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Test: Included 717 patients (405 PCR positive and 312 PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection), done January to Mid- March 2020. They
reported information on the time of testing after onset of symptoms.
Cellex® qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test: included 378 (98 samples collected from individuals, who exhibited mild or no clinical symptoms, 30 samples were collected
from hospitalized, with severe symptoms, 250 negative samples collected prior to September 2019. The day of sample collection relative to the onset of illness was
unknown.
Chembio DPP® COVID-19 IgM/IgG System: They had 31 (RT PCR confirmed positive) symptomatic subjects, in New York or East Asia during COVID -19 pandemic, 41
symptomatic subjects who were confirmed negative by PCR. They reported information on the time of testing after onset of symptoms.
LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG: 76 European patients (44 patients hospitalized with moderate symptoms and 32 severe symptoms), 1090 presumed SARS-CoV-2
negative samples from a European laboratory routine (n=90) and European blood donors (n=1000) were collected prior to COVID-19. They performed a serial antibody
measurement based on testing time after days of diagnosis
Mount Sinai Laboratory COVID-19 ELISA IgG Antibody Test: Total 114 samples reported on table (58 samples (collected between 7 and 14 days after onset of symptoms.
Fifty-five presumed true negative samples collected prior to the onset of the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic (that adds to 113)
VITROS® Anti-SARS-CoV-2G: 48 samples collected from patients confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive by PCR were tested. Of the 48 PCR positive samples 42 were
reactive in the VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and 6 were non-reactive 407 PCR negative control. They reported information on the time of testing after onset of
symptoms in test positive subjects. They were not included in our subgroup analysis because the time frame did not fit in to our proposed protocol.

VITROS ®Anti-SARS-CoV2T: 36 samples collected from patients confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive by PCR were tested, 400 presumed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
negative healthy blood donor. They reported information on the time of testing after onset of symptoms in 15/30 test positive subjects.
Cross reactive to: Human coronavirus HKU1 and Human coronavirus 229E
Cross reactive to: Hepatitis B Virus, Anti-Influenza A and rheumatoid factors
