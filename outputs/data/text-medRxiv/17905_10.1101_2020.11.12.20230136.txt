ABSTRACT
Background: In March 2020 South Africa implemented strict non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs) to contain Covid-19. Over the subsequent five months NPIs were eased in stages
according to national strategy. Covid-19 spread throughout the country heterogeneously, reaching
rural areas by July and peaking in July-August. Data on the impact of NPI policies on social and
economic wellbeing and access to healthcare is limited. We therefore analysed how rural
residents of three South African provinces changed their behaviour during the first epidemic
wave.
Methods: The South African Population Research Infrastructure Network (SAPRIN) nodes in
Mpumalanga (Agincourt), KwaZulu-Natal (AHRI) and Limpopo (DIMAMO) provinces
conducted longitudinal telephone surveys among randomly sampled households from rural and
peri-urban surveillance populations every 2-3 weeks. Interviews included questions on: Covid-19
knowledge and behaviours; health and economic impact of NPIs; and mental health.
Results: 2262 households completed 10,966 interviews between April and August 2020. By
August, self-reported satisfaction with Covid-19 knowledge had risen from 48% to 85% and
facemask use to over 95%. As selected NPIs were eased mobility increased, and economic losses
and anxiety and depression symptoms fell. When Covid-19 cases spiked at one node in July,
movement dropped rapidly, and missed daily medication rates doubled. Economic concerns and
mental health symptoms were lower in households receiving a greater number of governmentfunded old-age pensions.
Conclusions: South Africans reported complying with stringent Covid-19 NPIs despite the threat
of substantial social, economic and health repercussions. Government-supported social welfare

BACKGROUND
Shortly after the global epidemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was declared a
Public Health Emergency of International Concern, South Africa was identified as highly
vulnerable due to: i) extensive transport and airlinks [1]; ii) burden of infectious and noncommunicable health conditions [2, 3]; and iii) large socioeconomically vulnerable population
[4]. National government rapidly announced strict nationwide non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs) (“Level 5 lockdown”) on 26th March, 2020. Under these NPIs leaving home was only
allowed for groceries, medicines/medical care or to conduct permitted essential work, tobacco and
alcohol sales were banned and from 1st May facemask use was mandatory in public spaces. These
regulations were accompanied with guidance on enhanced use of hand washing or sanitizer and
surface cleaning.
The lockdown was intended to: (i) reduce Covid-19 transmission through strictly restricting
physical interaction; (ii) avoid rapid epidemic growth and allow healthcare providers to prepare
for a subsequent rise in demand for care; (iii) promote widespread educational campaigns to
reduce Covid-19 transmission; and (iv) initiate an ambitious, country-wide, community-based
Covid-19 screening and testing programme [5]. Between May and September the lockdown was
gradually eased, allowing return to work, school, and limited public gatherings.
While cumulative Covid-19 cases grew slowly during April, the incidence curve accelerated from
May onwards, peaking between June and August. By 1st September 2020, South Africa had
reported over 625,000 confirmed cases and over 14,000 deaths [6], among the 10 largest reported
epidemics worldwide at that date [7]. The true impact of epidemic appears to be even greater,

with 42,396 excess deaths reported between January and August nationally, compared to 2018-19
[8].
Relaxation of lockdown regulations, even as the epidemic curved upwards, reflected competing
health and economic vulnerabilities and priorities, alongside sustained popular pressure. Concern
was widespread that the lockdown was substantially affecting the national economy and
individual household livelihoods, as well as access to education, healthcare and medication [4, 9].
Additionally, some expected lockdown to be futile since much of the population could not
maintain physical distancing or implement NPIs, due to household and community overcrowding
and limited access to running water and sanitation [10].
Robust data are essential to evaluate these competing hypotheses, and to target resources where
they are most needed. Although South Africa has effective national healthcare surveillance
systems, there is limited capacity to monitor social and behavioural effects of NPIs on the Covid19 epidemic at a local level. NPIs such as those implemented in South Africa might be expected
to bring differing risks and benefits across socioeconomic settings. For example, in rural areas
unease surrounded water access for hand hygiene and “imilindo” (funeral night vigils held in
crowded rooms) [11], while urban areas worried about dwelling proximity and shared ablutions
[12]. To date, most data collected on these impacts have been limited to online or urban settings,
with only one including longitudinal follow-up [13-16]. Robust comparison between urban and
rural settings is limited yet vital if public sector responses are to be effectively aligned with
prevailing conditions.

We leveraged an existing research infrastructure in three South African provinces to evaluate how
health, social and economic behaviours changed as regulations and the national epidemic changed
from April to August 2020.

METHODS
Study site
The South African Population Research Infrastructure Network (SAPRIN) is an initiative hosted
by the South African Medical Research Council and funded long-term by the National
Department of Science and Innovation. SAPRIN integrates three Health and Demographic
Surveillance System (HDSS) nodes for population and health surveillance: (i) the MRC/Wits
Rural Public Health and Health Transitions Research Unit (Agincourt) in Ehlanzeni district,
Mpumalanga [17]; (ii) DIMAMO Population Health Research Centre in Capricorn district,
Limpopo [18]; and (iii) the Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI) in uMkhanyakude district,
KwaZulu-Natal [19]. Further urban nodes are under development. The nodes, each containing
over 100,000 individuals residing in approximately 20,000 households, vary in settlement
structure and density. The three districts are rural or peri-urban, located in the east of South Africa
(Supplementary Figure 1) and poor relative to the country. Nodes conduct multiple in-person and
telephonic surveys per year to update health and sociodemographic data, although DIMAMO had
only partially captured socioeconomic data for the first time before Covid-19 arrived.
Study design
In March 2020, SAPRIN initiated plans for each HDSS node to implement a high-intensity,
longitudinal telephonic survey covering at least 750 randomly selected households in each setting,

using telephone numbers extracted from each node’s most recent census. This sample was
selected to provide estimates of survey- and wave-specific proportions with precision of no less
than 4 percentage points, assuming 80% response rate in line with past SAPRIN surveys. Every
2-3 weeks, a primary respondent was called from a central call centre at each node and invited to
answer questions on behalf of the household. Individual-level questions could be answered by
other household members if they were present; otherwise, the primary respondent served as a
proxy. The questionnaire included Covid-19 symptom screening. Individuals meeting Department
of Health symptom criteria for Covid-19 were referred for further investigation, possible testing
and care. Telephone calls continued from April to August with continuous quality monitoring.
Implementation at AHRI has been described in detail elsewhere [20].
Measures
This analysis focuses on questions relating to responses to Covid-19 and NPIs in three key
domains: 1) Covid-19 knowledge and behaviour; 2) health and economic impacts of NPIs; and 3)
mental health. For behaviour, the primary respondent was asked about their perceived knowledge
about Covid-19 on a five-point scale; we separated respondents into those self-reporting less than
enough knowledge vs. those reporting enough or more. Respondents were then asked about
household behaviour change in response to the Covid-19 epidemic. Questions included whether
any resident household member had left the house in the past seven days, and whether any nonhousehold members visited the house during the preceding day; we divided respondents into
those reporting any vs. those reporting none for each question. Respondents were also asked if
household members had avoided crowded areas or social events, travel (using local minibus taxis
or long-distance travel) and if they used facemasks when going out.

For health and economic impact, primary respondents were asked about household members’
ability to: (i) access all needed daily medications; (ii) access needed healthcare; and (iii) earn
money. Finally, for mental health we asked primary respondents the Generalized Anxiety
Disorder 2-item (GAD-2) and Patient Health Questionnaire 2-item (PHQ-2) questions. We scored
both GAD-2 and PHQ-2 as positive for scores of 3 or higher using standard, South African
validated, cut-offs [21].
We linked data from this high-intensity survey to routine individual and household sociodemographic data collected in 2019 on household: number of children, working-age adults and
pension-age adults; maximal educational attainment; node-specific asset index quintile; level of
employment and unconditional social grant receipt.
Statistical analysis
We included in this analysis anyone interviewed before 1st September 2020. We first described
survey response rates across each node and time period, as well as key pre-Covid-19 household
characteristics. We next described change by node and month of data collection for each of eleven
measures across the three domains (behaviour; health and economic impact; mental health).
We then ran multivariable regression models to assess independent predictors of our outcomes of
interest, using complete case analysis. For each outcome we fitted a Poisson model with
household-level random effects and robust standard errors (generating prevalence ratios). Initially
we included node, interview round and month of interview as covariates, and then added
household characteristics. Data analysis was conducted in Stata v15.1 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX, USA) and R v4.0.2 [22].

Ethical considerations
All households had previously given consent to be contacted by phone and each primary
respondent gave recorded, verbal consent. All study procedures were discussed with each nodes’
existing community advisory groups and approved by Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZuluNatal’s provincial Department of Health Research Ethics Committees (REC), the University of
KwaZulu-Natal’s Biomedical REC, the University of the Witwatersrand’s Human REC (Medical)
and the University of Limpopo’s Turfloop REC.

RESULTS
Between 15th April and 31st August 2020, AHRI completed six waves of data collection,
MRC/Wits-Agincourt five and DIMAMO two (Figure 1). These waves covered almost the entire
period of the first Covid-19 epidemic wave in South Africa, including outbreaks of varying sizes
in the three provinces under observation. Response rates averaged 78.7% with variation from
65.6% to 90.3% by wave and node (Figure 1). Direct refusal was rare (3.1% of all attempts),
while unanswered calls were more common (10.7%) and numbers were quite often out of service
or claimed to be wrong numbers (7.6%). In total, 10,966 household interviews were completed
with 2,662 unique households between April and August.

All interviews up to 31st August 2020. Last round at each node is incomplete, hence lower total numbers. 464 of the
2,225 households initially sampled by Agincourt, and 119 of the 1,000 households initially sampled by DIMAMO
did not have valid telephone numbers and are excluded here. From wave 2, Agincourt only sought to reach the 1159
households that participated in wave 1, although in waves 2 and 3 some households were unintentionally not
contacted and in wave 5 seven households were intentionally not contacted due to either involvement in other
intensive studies or having left the area.

Descriptive statistics for all sampled households with a valid telephone number are shown in
Supplementary Table 1. In one-sixth (16.4%) of households no-one had completed secondary
education, while in 14.7% a household member had completed a post-secondary qualification.
Wealthier households were more likely to have a valid telephone number and more likely to
participate at AHRI and Agincourt. Households were large (median of six resident and nonresident members, of whom two were under age 18). Households had a mean of 1.6 employed
members, 38% of all households received one or more old-age pensions and 63% received any
other government grant.
Figure 2 describes questionnaire response over time and by location. In terms of knowledge and
behaviour, self-reported satisfaction with knowledge about Covid-19 rose over time at all three
nodes, from around 48.3% in April and May to 84.5% in August. Daily visitors to the house were
consistently low, peaking at 11.9% of households having one or more visitors in the previous day
in May. The proportion of households with members going out increased over time, from 28.2%
in April to a peak of 79.5% in June. There was, however, a notable drop at AHRI in KwaZuluNatal, concurrent with reports of local Covid-19 transmission, from 76.2% in June to 31.7% in
July and 18.0% in August. Facemask use rose rapidly to become almost universal at all three
nodes by June.

Reported inability to access healthcare remained low and relatively stable over time. However,
around half of households reported missing daily medication, and while levels were stable at
Agincourt and DIMAMO, they almost doubled at AHRI from 37.4% in June to 65.0% as the
epidemic arrived locally in July. The proportion of households reporting lost earnings due to
Covid-19 regulations dropped substantially as lockdown was reduced from Level 5 to Level 4,
and again when it was lowered to Level 3, remaining steady thereafter. Finally, the proportion of
individuals screening positive for possible anxiety and depression fell over time at AHRI and
DIMAMO and stayed low at Agincourt throughout the period.
After accounting for study node and month of interview, and despite variation in household
composition, no household characteristics were substantively associated with self-reported
satisfactory Covid-19 knowledge, residents having left the home in the past week, avoiding travel
or facemask use (Table 2). Households with more educated individuals were more likely to report
having had visitors the previous day and less likely to have avoided crowded spaces, perhaps
reflecting urban location. Households with older and more pension-recipients were nonsignificantly more likely to have a recent unmet health need, but less likely to have been unable to
access medicine (Table 3). These same two factors, as well as having a member who had
completed secondary but not post-secondary education, all predicted less lost earnings. Finally,
symptoms of depression and anxiety were non-significantly lower in households receiving
pension grants.

DISCUSSION
Using rapid, repeated, telephonic interviews across three provinces in South Africa, we observed
how households in rural and peri-urban areas responded to, and were affected by, national NPIs
enacted to minimize the epidemic spread of Covid-19. As both NPIs and the epidemic spread
across the country, our longitudinal surveillance programme captured the impact of both
processes.
Our first key finding was that the national public health measures and messaging were effective in
several ways. Respondents across three provinces showed consistent improvements in satisfaction
with their understanding of the epidemic. There was early concern that South Africa’s public
health messaging was insufficiently contextualized to the country’s varying social and economic
conditions. However, both politicians and scientists conducted televised national press
conferences, supported by provincial and local follow-up. While causality cannot be proven, in
line with evidence elsewhere [23], our respondents reported rapid and comprehensive compliance
with communicated messages, including facemask use, and active avoidance of crowds and
transport. Several of these behaviours remained prevalent even as formal lockdown NPIs were
relaxed.
Second, we identified substantial behaviour change as Covid-19 arrived locally. This was
particularly noticeable in KwaZulu-Natal, where rapid epidemic expansion in the local district in
early July coincided with rapid decline in household members leaving home and concomitant
increases in missed daily medications and inability to access needed healthcare. This response
reflected local epidemic dynamics – the national epidemic started in the Western Cape, extending
first to the adjacent Eastern Cape, then to densely populated Gauteng and eThekwini in KwaZulu18

Natal, before expanding to more the rural east and north of South Africa captured in this study.
The impact of regulations and epidemic trajectories on travel is particularly pertinent in our study
settings: medium- and long-distance circular labour migration to urban areas is highly prevalent
and vital to economic wellbeing for rural and peri-urban South African households [24]. Bans on
long-distance travel had potentially substantial economic implications for people not able to
return to work, although such travel bans might also explain in part the limited epidemics seen in
these rural areas even as NPIs were relaxed.
Third, mental health findings are reassuring. At all three nodes we observed declining depression
and anxiety symptoms over time, based on validated screening scales. Symptom frequency was
notably higher at the DIMAMO peri-urban node, perhaps reflecting concern of greater risk arising
from the nearby city of Polokwane. Encouragingly, even when Covid-19 arrived locally at AHRI,
depression and anxiety rates did not increase. Comparisons are complex, but our findings align
with national South African data suggesting lower Covid-19 mental health impact in poorer and
more rural areas [23]. Longitudinal surveillance across a range of settings using harmonised
measures will help unpick how much mental health is affected directly by Covid-19 disease fears,
and indirectly by secondary social and economic effects.
Our analysis raises concern about unmet need for healthcare. Almost half of households reported
that members had recently missed daily medication doses, and 5-10% of households reported that
a member wanted but been unable to access healthcare in the past seven days, levels similar to
other South African surveys [13]. Notably, epidemic arrival at AHRI had diverging effects: unmet
healthcare need changed little, but missed medication rates almost doubled. Such patterns suggest
that households may be calculating trade-offs between Covid and non-Covid risks, being willing
to risk physical proximity to attend clinic [25], but not collect medicine [26]. Additional

information is needed to determine whether unmet healthcare needs represent operational,
mobility, transport costs/availability or other issues – and to what extent they were the result of or
exacerbated by the Covid-19 epidemic or regulations. Data covering pre- and post-Covid-19
would help unpick these effects, as would qualitative investigation of household decision-making
during lockdown.
Finally, we found that households with greater numbers of older members and pension-recipients
reported greater unmet healthcare needs, but were less affected by lost earnings and had fewer
mental health concerns. South African non-contributory pensions – broad national government
support schemes that are often the largest household income source in these relatively rural
settings with very high unemployment rates – have previously been linked to positive physical
and mental health outcomes [27, 28]. Our study suggests that such government support structures
likely play an essential role maintaining household security in crisis contexts such as Covid-19,
providing a guaranteed income to vulnerable populations. The government’s temporary
supplementation of grant programmes early in the epidemic may have additionally helped [29],
however it will be important to observe if the ending of supplementation in October 2020 reverses
effects.
This analysis presents an overview of key insights across time from multiple sites across South
Africa. However, there are several follow-on analyses to consider that would further contextualize
our findings. First, data can be analysed longitudinally at the household or individual level to
evaluate trajectories of behaviour and impact as the COVID-19 epidemic continues to play out in
rural and peri-urban environments. For example, it will be important to evaluate the impact of
new government policies such as the ending of temporary increases in non-contributory grants.
Second, these behavioural data can be linked to experience of Covid-19 symptoms and individual

and population health outcomes to evaluate how risk perceptions and reactions were associated
with health outcomes. Third, more in-depth analysis of how households’ historical and current
age, gender, employment and migration composition, as well as pre-existing co-morbidities,
affects current Covid-19 and NPI impact will help identify those most in need of support during
such crises. The ongoing SAPRIN Covid-19 surveillance programme will allow measurement of
these factors longitudinally throughout the epidemic’s course.
Strengths and limitations
This study has limitations. As with all observational studies, generalizability beyond our study
population, in this case rural and peri-urban areas of eastern South Africa, is uncertain. This
concern is tempered by our ability to compare and combine data across multiple sites and to
triangulate with other studies of Covid-19 impact in South Africa and sub-Saharan African. While
household cellphone ownership is high, there was evidence that poorer households in these areas
were somewhat less likely to participate, which will affect response levels although less so the
trends we focus on. Our data are self-reported, and thus represent perceived needs and impacts,
and reported behaviour change may reflect desirability biases. However, even with such biases,
findings provide insight into the perceptions and lived experiences of these communities. Again,
triangulating our findings with digital data sources can help. Finally, we do not have data on
identical questions from the pre-Covid period, however, we are able to leverage similar
information on many topics from earlier surveillance.
Nevertheless, the study also has several strengths, notably a clearly defined sampling base, high
response and low attrition rates, frequent follow-up and linkage to pre-Covid household data.
Many of these benefits arise from the nature of the existing SAPRIN surveillance infrastructure,

reinforcing the importance of long-term population-based surveillance systems that collect social,
demographic and health data. This work demonstrates that surveillance systems can be rapidly
repurposed to answer emergency health needs, including: (i) rapid pathogen data acquisition; (ii)
identification of susceptible populations; (iii) assessment of behavioural and biomedical
interventions; and (iv) development of mitigation strategies [30].
SAPRIN nodes have been working with their local communities for 20-28 years. Such long-term
engagement ensures deep understanding and community buy-in allowing rapid implementation
and sustained high-intensity follow-up with minimal dropout. The network nature of SAPRIN
also allowed each node to flexibly implement an overarching protocol. Furthermore, use of
telephonic call centres at each node enabled rapid survey roll-out based on previously provided
informed consent for personal calls and substantially reduced Covid-19 infection risk for study
staff and research participants. Since these call centres employ locally recruited staff, we were
able to reach population segments that online surveys (in a country with limited access to internet
in rural areas), and even random-digit dialling approaches (in a country with 11 official spoken
languages and numerous dialects) struggle to capture. Additionally, we could link self-response
survey data to other data sources within the SAPRIN databases. These include the previously
collected sociodemographic data used in this study and biological samples collected as part of the
Covid-19 surveillance project. SAPRIN can also link to data on public sector healthcare
utilization and laboratory test results through memoranda of understanding with government
departments. SAPRIN’s ongoing expansion will also allow comparisons to be made in the future
to well-characterised urban sites.

Conclusion
South Africans in three rural and peri-urban areas were to a great extent willing and able to
comply with national government regulations and recommendations on social interaction and
other risk behaviours relating to Covid-19, despite limited resources and substantial economic
need to travel. This rapid uptake of preventative behaviours reflects clear government messaging
and population willingness to comply even in settings where enforcement measures were limited.
The arrival of the epidemic locally, even as official NPIs were relaxed, led to further self-imposed
behavioural restrictions, some of which led to difficulties with healthcare access. However, the
economic and mental health effects of NPIs continued to decline as the measures were eased. Our
findings highlight the importance of monitoring the possible deleterious secondary impacts of
NPIs in epidemic conditions. Our results reinforce the principle that NPIs should be adjusted
based on epidemic cycle and that mitigating measures will be required against anticipated and
unanticipated secondary impacts. All these factors should be considered when setting, adjusting
and relaxing NPIs in lower-income settings, especially as urgently established national policies
give way to differentiated, decentralised approaches across diverse subnational environments.

Data are medians (IQR) for continuous measures, and percent for categorical measures. Percentages are of all
households for ‘participation’ and of all non-missing values for ‘node’ columns. P-values are for difference between
groups within characteristics using ߯ ଶ tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum (participation
comparison) or Kruskal-Wallis (node comparisons) for continuous variables. Continuous variable data were missing
for three households. Categorical variables data are missing for Education: 0.7% at AHRI, 1.4% at Agincourt,
51.0% at DIMAMO; Wealth: 0.8% at AHRI, 3.8% at Agincourt, 45.2% at DIMAMO.
