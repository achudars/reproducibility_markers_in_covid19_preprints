Abstract:
Background: In late December of 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in
the Chinese city Wuhan among a cluster of pneumonia patients. While it is known that pregnant
women have reduced immunity and they are at risk for COVID-19 infection during the current
pandemic, it is not clear if the disease manifestation would be different in pregnant women from
non-pregnant women.
Objectives: To describe the maternal and neonatal clinical features as well as outcome of
pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods: In this retrospective national-based study, we analyzed the medical records of all
SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant patients and their neonates who were admitted to New-Jahra
Hospital, Kuwait, between March 15th 2020 and May 31st 2020. The outcomes of pregnancies
were assessed until the end date of follow-up (June 15th 2020).
Results: A total of 185 pregnant women were enrolled with a median age of 31 years
(interquartile range, IQR: 27.5-34), and median gestational age at diagnosis was 29 weeks (IQR:
18-34). The majority (88%) of the patients had mild symptoms, with fever (58%) being the most
common presenting symptom followed by cough (50.6%). During the study period, 141 (76.2%)
patients continued their pregnancy, 3 (1.6%) had a miscarriage, 1 (0.5%) had intrauterine fetal
death and only 2 (1.1%) patients developed severe pneumonia and required intensive care. Most
of the neonates were asymptomatic, and only 2 (5%) of them tested positive on day 5 by
nasopharyngeal swab testing.
Conclusion: Pregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk to the COVID-19 than the
general population. The clinical features of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were
similar to those of the general population having SARS-CoV-2 infection. Favorable maternal and
neonatal outcomes reinforce the existing evidence and may guide healthcare professionals in the
management of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
In late December of 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in the Chinese city
Wuhan was identified among a cluster of pneumonia cases [1]. The outbreak of coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) rapidly spread to become a global pandemic as declared by the World
Health Organization in March 2020 [1-3]. This advent and remarkable widespread SARS-CoV-2
reflects a new public health crisis [4].
SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronavirus family, and other pathogens from this family have
inflicted a range of viral infections, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [5]. The main route of transmission is through
respiratory droplets and direct contact. While the spectrum of the disease severity ranges from
mild to critical, most are mild. Most of the fatal cases occurred in patients with advanced age or
underlying comorbidities [6]. However, to this date, the SARS-CoV-2 mortality rate is greater
than MERS and SARS combined and have a global Case Fatality Rate of about 6.4% [1].
Although it is known that pregnant women have a reduced immunity [5], and they are at risk for
COVID-19 infection during the current pandemic, it is not clear how the disease manifestation
would be different in pregnant women from non-pregnant women. It is known that the body's
immune system and response to viral infections might be changed as a result of pregnancy, and
this explains the cause of more severe symptoms [7]. However, there is currently no evidence
that pregnant women are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than non-pregnant women [8 – 11] ].
They may present with severe diseases that include hypoxia, hypotension, electrolyte
disturbances, placental hypo perfusion, which can provoke fetal distress, preterm labor,
miscarriage, or fetal death [12 – 18] .
Preliminary evidence from the diseases caused by H1N1 virus (H1N1 influenza) and other
coronaviruses (SARS and MERS) have suggested that pregnant women are more likely to have
severe manifestations of the disease, morbidity, and mortality as compared to non-pregnant
women [19 – 22] . Moreover, some studies have shown an association between the risk of these
critical illnesses and later stages of pregnancy [23 – 25] .
To date, information about the different routes (transplacental, perinatal, intrapartum and
postnatal) and risks of transmission of COVID-19 to newborn infants is based on case series
[13]. In consideration of the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, the risk of vertical
transmission is supposed to be very low or absent. This supposition is supported by the evidence
that there was no vertical transmission detected in other members of the coronavirus family:
SARS and MERS [19].

The risk of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. Additionally, since the risk of
postnatal transmission remains to be elucidated, it is debatable whether the newborn should be
immediately separated from the COVID-19 positive mother [8]. A study comprised of outcomes
of 7 newborns necessitates the separation of newborns to avoid potential threats of SARS-CoV-2
infection [26]. In another study, contrary to the previous one, it is concluded that separation may
not prevent infection, and early separation might increase neonatal risk of pneumonia [27].
However, the severity of postnatally acquired disease in the newborn is unknown. A case series
of 10 COVID-19 negative neonates born to COVID-19 positive mothers reported fetal distress,
premature labor, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function,
and even death among neonates [12]. This may indicate a possible association, but not
necessarily a causal effect.
We believe that the information on outcomes of such pregnancies could continuously update
guidance and management procedures for COVID-19 positive pregnant mothers and their
neonates. Therefore, the study aimed at describing the maternal as well as neonatal clinical
features and outcome of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods:
Study Design
We performed a retrospective national-based analysis of medical records from all SARS-CoV-19
positive pregnant patients and their neonates who were admitted to New-Jahra Hospital, Kuwait
between March 15th, 2020 and May 31st, 2020, and the outcomes were assessed till the end date
of follow-up (June 15th, 2020). New Jahra hospital was designated as a national hospital for the
management of COVID-19 infected pregnant patients and neonates born to infected mothers in
Kuwait. As part of Kuwait’s national COVID- 19 policy, all pregnant women were tested if they
had SARS-CoV-2 symptoms or had been in contact with infected patients. Moreover, all
confirmed COVID-19 positive pregnant women were admitted to the maternity department for at
least 14 days or till resolution of symptoms. Patients management was based on local and
international guideline protocols (Appendix 1).
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health of Kuwait
(2020/1420)
Patient selection criteria
We enrolled all pregnant women admitted to the maternity department due to SARS-CoV-2
infection, as confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
assay of nasopharyngeal swab specimens (Cobas 6800 Systems, Roche, Switzerland) / (Taq
Path, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA). Patients who had equivocal or negative testing results
were excluded from the study.
Assessment of neonates

The neonatal team assessed neonates after delivery. They were isolated immediately and
admitted to a designated neonatal intensive care unit. All neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 positive
mothers were admitted to a negative pressure isolated single room, cared by health care
providers wearing full personal protective equipment, and were fed artificial formula. Moreover,
nasopharyngeal swab testing was performed for all neonates on day 5 and then on day 14.
Data collection
Maternal and neonatal data were extracted from the electronic medical records or medical charts
using a standardized data collection sheet. For maternal data, we recorded the information on
gestational age at diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, parity (nulliparous or multiparous), pre-existing
medical condition (i.e., including hypertension, diabetes, bronchial asthma, hypothyroidism, and
autoimmune diseases) and presenting symptoms prior to admissions, such as fever, sore throat/
nasal or sinus congestion, cough/chest pain, vomiting/diarrhea, and fatigue/myalgia).
Information on current pregnancy was also collected, including gestational diabetes, pregnancyinduced hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and multiple pregnancies. We collected the laboratory and
chest x-ray results upon admission to the hospital. Information on patient-specific therapies, such
as antenatal steroids for lung maturation, administration of antibiotics, antivirals, and
thromboprophylaxis (i.e. low molecular weight heparin was also collected. For patients admitted
to intensive care unit, we obtained data on maximum respiratory support (i.e. intubation and
mechanical ventilation), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as defined according to the
Berlin criteria and duration of ventilation [28]
For neonatal data, we collected gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, birth weight, 1 and
5 minutes Apgar score, and the results of nasopharngeal swabs. Data entry and quality were
checked and reviewed independently by two investigators (AE and AB).
We defined gestational age as the number of weeks calculated according to the last normal
menstrual period or expected date of delivery according to an early ultrasound scan. Gestational
diabetes was defined as high blood sugar (glucose) using the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test as a
screening method (fasting blood sugar ≥ 5.1 mmol/L or 1 hour postprandial ≥10 mmol/L or 2
hours postprandial ≥8.5 mmol/L) that developed during pregnancy and usually disappeared after
giving birth. Preeclampsia was defined as new onset of hypertension (over 140 mmHg systolic
or over 90 mmHg diastolic) after 20 weeks of pregnancy and significant proteinuria. Pregnancyinduced hypertension (PIH) was defined as a new hypertension presenting after 20 weeks of
pregnancy without significant proteinuria.
Statistical analysis
We reported continuous variables as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile
range [IQR]) and categorical variables as number and percentage. Statistical analysis was
performed using STATA/IC 14 software (STATA Corp, College Station, Texas).

During the study period, 185 pregnant women were identified with confirmed SARS-CoV- 2
infection with a median age of patients was 31 years (IQR: 27.5-34), and 19.5% were
nulliparous. The majority of patients were healthy, 19 (10.3%) patients had gestational diabetes,
and 4 (2.3%) had PIH. The median gestational age at diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was 29 weeks
(IQR: 18 to 34), and half of the women were in their 3rd trimester. Additionally, the majority of
the patients (88.6%) were symptomatic. The most common symptom was fever in 105 (58%)
patients followed by cough in 90 (50.6%) patients, and the median duration of symptoms prior to
hospital admission was 2 days (IQR:1-4). Table 1 presents the characteristics of pregnant
women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The laboratory findings of pregnant women are shown in Table 2. Seventeen (9.2%) of the
pregnant patients had leukopenia, and 29 (15.7%) had lymphopenia. Forty-six (37%) patients
had elevated C-reactive protein and 12 (11%) had elevated procalcitonin. Elevated alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) , aspartate aminotransferase (AST), D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase
(LD) were observed in 24.2%, 11.2 ,10% and 42% , respectively of the patients in which the test
was ordered. Eight (15.4%) patients had a chest x-ray diagnosis of pneumonia.
Maternal treatment and outcomes are shown in Table 3. Two (1.1%) patients required critical
care for worsening respiratory conditions. The majority (97.3%) of the patients received
Oseltamivir, and only 2 (1.1%) received Lopinavir-ritonavir. Ceftriaxone was given in 24.3% of
the patients, and 96.7% received low molecular weight heparin.
Two patients requiring Intensive care unit (ICU) were at 37 and 38 weeks’ gestation. One
developed hypoxia (oxygen saturation, 88%) and shortness of breath due to worsening
pneumonia necessitating intubation and emergency C-section, while the second patient had
worsening respiratory condition 24 hours post-delivery (Table S1). None of them required
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and both got discharged subsequently. At the
time of follow-up, most of the patients (98.9%) were discharged, and the median duration of
hospital stay was 15 days (IQR:14-22).

Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes are shown in Table 4. At the time of the analysis, out of the
185, 141 (76.2%) of the women had ongoing pregnancies, 40 (21.6%) gave live birth, 3 (1.6%)
had a miscarriage, and 1 (0.54%) had intrauterine fetal death, which was not related to COVID19. Details of the cases resulting in spontaneous miscarriages are shown in Tables S2. Among
those who continued their pregnancy and got discharged 55 (39%) women were followed up by
either telehealth or in-person at the feto-maternal clinic at median weeks post-diagnosis 3 [2-6

weeks], 25 (45.4%) patients in their 3rd trimester, 17 (31%) in 2nd trimester, and 13 (23.6%) in
the first trimester. All these patients had a healthy pregnancy.

The median gestational age at delivery was 38 (IQR: 36-39) weeks. Among those who delivered,
11(26.8%) had preterm birth. One of the preterm deliveries was iatrogenic (due to pathological
cardiotocography) and the second preterm delivery due to premature rupture of membrane. Nine
patients delivered between 33 and 36 weeks, either spontaneous delivery or due to other obstetric
causes.
Forty-one neonates were delivered with one set of twins. Seventeen (42.5%) of neonates were
born by cesarean section. Of these, one of the neonates was delivered by emergency cesarean
due to maternal hypoxia as a result of worsening pneumonia, and the other 16 were due to either
fetal distress or obstetrical indication. Median birth weight was 3006 grams (IQR:2750-3215),
and only 2 (4.9%) neonates required intubation and surfactant due to hyaline membrane disease
of prematurity. Two (4.9%) of the neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and there
was no neonatal death.
Clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 positive neonates are shown in Table S3. The first
positive neonate was born at 31 weeks by vaginal delivery; the mother presented with preterm
premature rupture of membrane and developed intrapartum fever (38.20). The obstetrical cause
of fever was ruled out, and the COVID-19 was suspected that was later confirmed on RT-PCR.
The second positive neonate was born at 39 weeks’ gestation by spontaneous vaginal delivery,
similar to other positive newborns; the mother also had premature rupture of membrane. One
newborn was asymptomatic apart from being born prematurely at 31 weeks. The second
newborn developed tachypnoea and increase work of breathing on day 4 of age and required
humidified high flow nasal cannula for 5 days. The neonate’s clinical condition improved, and a
chest x-ray showed complete resolution of the bilateral streaky lung infiltration.

Discussion:
This is a descriptive study on the maternal as well as neonatal clinical features and outcome of
pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus far, the majority of the preliminary
research articles reported with a small sample size [12, 13, 15, 18]. This study is among the first
to report COVID-positive maternal and neonatal clinical characteristics and outcomes with a
comparatively large sample size.
In this study, 185 pregnant women were identified with confirmed SARS-CoV- 2 infection with.
Around 88% were symptomatic, with the most common symptom being fever in 58% of patients
followed by cough in 50.6% of patients. These findings are in accordance with a number of

preliminary studies [14, 15, 18, 29]. A prospective cohort study using the UK Obstetric
Surveillance System (UKOSS) found fever and cough as common symptoms in pregnant women
having COVID-19 [29]. A systematic review revealed that the most dominant initial symptoms
in pregnant women with COVID-19 were fever and cough [18]. Similarly, a retrospective study
found that common symptoms in pregnant women in the wake of SARS-CoV-2 infection are
cough and fever, and less common symptoms include shortness of breath, diarrhea, and myalgia
[13]. On the contrary, a study found the majority of women being asymptomatic and afebrile at
presentation [17]. However, the majority of the studies have supported the evidence of fever and
cough as the most common symptoms [14, 15, 30 – 35]
Data from the preliminary studies found that majority of pregnant women with COVID-19 were
in the late second or third trimester [29]. In our study, the median gestational age on diagnosis
was 29 weeks, and half of the women were in their 3rd trimester. Likewise, a prospective cohort
study using UKOSS found that most women were hospitalized in the 3rd trimester [8, 29].
Moreover, in our study, 10% of the patients had gestational diabetes. Evidence of an association
between gestational diabetes and pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV- 2 is well
documented [29].
With reference to the laboratory findings, in our study, 15.7% of the pregnant patients had
lymphopenia, and elevated ALT and AST were observed in 24.2% and 11.2% of the patients,
respectively, and 10% had elevated D-dimer. Several studies have reported lymphopenia in both
the general population affected by COVID-19 [36] and also in pregnant women affected by
COVID-19 [17, 37]. Similarly, a retrospective study found the likelihood of lymphopenia as well
as increased concentrations of ALT or AST as one of the clinical manifestations [13]. Pregnancy
is widely accepted as a hypercoagulable state [38], and monitoring of D-dimer is also necessary.
A case series study has reported elevated D-dimer in pregnant women with COVID-19 and its
association with increased mortality rate [39].
Preliminary studies on pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested a low
rate of admission to the ICU, maternal, and neonatal death [40]. Moreover, the rate of severe
pneumonia in pregnant women was also not greater than the general population [41]. In our
study, 15.4% had a radiological diagnosis of pneumonia, and only 2 patients required critical
care for worsening respiratory conditions, which are in accordance with the preliminary records.
A case series published by the clinicians in New York reported a similarly low rate of around 5%
of the pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring critical care [14]. Likewise, a
prospective cohort study using UKOSS reported that one woman per 2400 giving birth required
critical care, and the maternal mortality rate was roughly about one in 18000 women undergoing
delivery [29].
The rates of ICU admission and mortality among pregnant women admitted to hospital with
COVID-19 are proportional to the rates among the general population [29, 41]. In our study, we

found favorable outcomes among pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most of the
patients had mild symptoms, with only a few ICU admissions and zero mortality. The clinical
features of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar to those of the general
population having SARS-CoV-2 infection, as reported in previous studies [42].
In our study, 26.8% of neonates were born preterm, and 42.5% of neonates were delivered by
cesarean section. These findings are supported by similar findings in the past, in the data from
the UKOSS study, where 59% of the neonates had cesarean births, and 27% had preterm births
[29]. Another study reported that the majority of pregnant women had a cesarean section planned
delivery to prevent neonatal transmission of the virus [34]. Similarly, a systematic review finds
out that the frequent mode of delivery in cases reported was cesarean section [18].
Newborns born to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers are most likely to be asymptomatic [12].
Similarly, in our study, 73.1% of the neonates, born full-term, were asymptomatic. The findings
of our study propose that neonatal outcome is reassuring, keeping with other studies [29, 43-46].
However, in our study, two neonates tested positive for COVID-19 on day 5 of nasopharyngeal
swab testing. According to Shah’s classification, the diagnosis of congenital or intrapartum
infection could not be confirmed [47]. Some studies from the past reported inconsistency with no
evidence of vertical transmission [13, 34]. Nevertheless, vertically acquired infection is still
reasonable and cannot be ruled out as supported by preliminary studies and emerging evidence
[8]. Further investigations around the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV- 2 infections is
needed.
In our study, the mothers of two COVID-19-positive neonates presented with preterm premature
rupture of membrane (PROM). PROM is known to be linked to neonatal sepsis, and duration of
PROM and viral infection in neonate, especially with herpes simplex and HIV, is well
documented, however, it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion here [48, 49]
A major strength of this study is its large sample size, whereas preliminary studies [12, 15, 18]
were comprised of small sample size and could not draw a firm conclusion. The findings of the
study may aid clinicians and patients in the effective management of the pregnancies
complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there are also some inherent limitations to
this study due to its retrospective study design.
In conclusion, the clinical features of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar
to those of the general population infected with COVID-19. Favorable outcomes among pregnant
women with SARS-CoV-2 infection suggest that pregnant women are not at higher risk to the
COVID 19 than the general population, nor are they susceptible to severe pneumonia. Moreover,
the neonatal outcome is also reassuring.
