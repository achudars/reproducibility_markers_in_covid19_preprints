Abstract
Aims. Due to a prolonged period of national and regional lockdown measures during the coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic, there has been an increase reliance on informal care and a consequent
increase in care intensity for informal carers. In light of this, the current study compared the
experiences of carers and non-carers on various mental health and wellbeing measures across 5 key
time points during the pandemic.
Methods. Data analysed were from the UCL COVID -19 Social Study. Our study focused on 5 time
points in England: (i) the first national lockdown (March-April 2020; N=12,053); (ii) the beginning of
lockdown rules easing (May 2020; N=24,374); (iii) further easing (July 2020; N=21,395); (iv) new
COVID-19 restrictions (September 2020; N=4,792); and (v) the three-tier system restrictions (October
2020; N=4,526). We considered 5 mental health and wellbeing measures- depression, anxiety,
loneliness, life satisfaction and sense of worthwhile. Propensity score matching were applied for the
analyses.
Results. We found that informal carers experienced higher levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety
than non-carers across all time points. During the first national lockdown, carers also experienced a
higher sense of life being worthwhile. No association was found between informal caring
responsibilities and levels of loneliness and life satisfaction.
Conclusion. Given that carers are an essential national health care support, especially during a
pandemic, it is crucial to integrate carers’ needs into healthcare planning and delivery. These results
highlight there is a pressing need to provide adequate and targeted mental health support for carers
during and following this pandemic.

Introduction
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were around 1 in 8 adults (approximately 6.5 million people)
providing some form of informal care in the UK, estimated to have a replacement value of £132 billion
a year (1). Informal care is defined as unpaid care and support for others (typically family, relatives,
friends or neighbours) who may have a disability, chronic illness, mental health problem or other care
needs. This can include providing supervision, practical or instrumental care (e.g. shopping,
household chores) and personal care (e.g. dressing, bathing, eating, using the bathroom, emotional
support) (2,3). With population ageing where the life expectancy for people with long term health
conditions has improved, the demand for informal care has increased to meet the needs and to
support the sustainability of health and social care system (3). As such, informal care is becoming
increasingly important within society.
However, informal care, especially personal care, can be physically and mentally demanding.
According to Carers UK (1,4), nearly 1 in 7 of informal carers juggle their caring responsibilities with
work, 15% provide over 50 hours of care per week, and 17% care for more than one person. In
addition, 3% of the UK general population (approximately more than 1.3 millions people) are
‘sandwich’ carers – people with the dual responsibility of caring for elderly or disabled/sick family
members and young children. Often, carers are faced with challenging tasks and stressful situations
and are required to maintain high levels of vigilance; this can create chronic stress (5). This is likely to
have a negative impact on carers’ personal and social life, and physical and mental health and
wellbeing. A substantial literature shows that caring responsibilities have an adverse effect on
physical and mental health and health-related behaviours. For instance, it has been shown that
people who provide informal care experience higher levels of depression and anxiety, inadequate
sleep, higher levels of loneliness, and a higher risk of stroke (1–3,6–8). However, there are also some
reported benefits of caregiving, such as self-esteem and sense of meaning (9–11).
During the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, members of the public faced prolonged periods of
social distancing, reduced access to local services and community facilities, and restricted face-toface contacts. Particularly, people considered clinically vulnerable (e.g. older adults aged 70 or above
and people with specific medical conditions) faced greatest social restrictions as they were advised
to follow stricter advice, often not leaving their homes (“shielding”). For many, this led to an increased
reliance on informal care and a consequent increase in care intensity for informal carers (12). Indeed,
a report from Carers UK has shown that there were an additional 4.5 million informal carers during
2020 whilst the outbreak of COVID-19 was ongoing (13). Also, limited access to health services means
that many carers faced more stressful situations related to care recipients’ medical conditions
(14,15). Moreover, to protect those they were caring for, carers themselves had to shield, facing the
same tougher restrictions on their social lives and disrupting usual social support networks. There
are, consequently, concerns that the mental health of carers was adversely affected during the
pandemic. However, whilst there has been wide-spread concern for the negative impact of COVID19 pandemic on mental health of the public (16–19) and formal carers and other healthcare
professionals (20,21), with results suggesting worsening mental health during the pandemic
compared with before, less attention has been paid to the mental health and wellbeing of informal
carers during the pandemic (13–15,22–25).
Amongst the studies that have been conducted, it has been shown that, since that start of the
pandemic, people who providing informal care were likely to be women, younger adults, have
children under the age of 18 and have paid work (13). These individuals often experienced a double
burden of working or childcare and providing informal care. Some preliminary research has already

shown the negative impacts of the pandemic on informal carers. These include increased levels of
depression (especially for those who spend 20 hours or more per week on caring) (14), increased
mental strain (e.g. the concerns of risk of COVID-19 infection in family (24), increased alcohol
consumption and use of illegal drugs (22), increased feelings of frustration (25), and feelings of loss
of control and uncertainty (23). However, to date these studies have generally relied on relatively
small sample sizes and focused on one time point rather than looking at the evolution of experiences
across the pandemic. Further, there has been little research on the impact of informal caring on
positive wellbeing during the pandemic.
In light of this, the present study compared the experiences of carers and non-carers on a number of
mental health and wellbeing measures, namely depression, anxiety, loneliness, life satisfaction, and
a sense that life is worthwhile across various time points during the COVID-19 pandemic. As caring
responsibility are socially patterned, with the demographics of carers (e.g. middle-aged adults and
females (1)) already linked to less favourable mental health and wellbeing outcomes, this study aimed
specifically to disentangle whether the negative impacts of informal caring responsibilities on carers’
mental health and wellbeing were attributable to individual demographics or the role of being an
informal carer itself. Whilst direct experimental studies in this context were not feasible or practical,
we sought to mimic experimental conditions and to effectively account for the effects of observed
confounding factors by using the statistical technique of propensity score matching (PSM).
Methods
Participants
This study analysed data from the UK COVID-19 Social Study run by University College London, a
longitudinal study that focuses on the psychological and social experiences of adults living in the UK
during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study commenced on 21st March 2020 and involves weekly
online data collection from participants for the duration of the pandemic. The study is not random
and therefore is not representative of the UK population. However, it does contain a heterogeneous
sample that was recruited using three primary approaches. First, convenience sampling was used,
including promoting the study through existing networks and mailing lists (including large databases
of adults who had previously consented to be involved in health research across the UK), print and
digital media coverage, and social media. Second, more targeted recruitment was undertaken
focusing on (i) individuals from a low-income background, (ii) individuals with no or few educational
qualifications, and (iii) individuals who were unemployed. Third, the study was promoted via
partnerships with third sector organisations to vulnerable groups, including adults with pre-existing
mental health conditions, older adults, carers, and people experiencing domestic violence or abuse.
The study was approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee [12467/005] and all participants gave
informed consent. A full protocol for the study is available online at www.COVIDSocialStudy.org.
This study focused on mental health and wellbeing amongst respondents with caring responsibilities
across 5 key time points during the pandemic. Given that there were variations in rules and
restrictions and the time points that changes to these rules came in across different nations in the
UK, we only considered participants who lived in England. We also restricted our sample for each
time-point to participants who completed the survey within 7 days of each time point and provided
responses to all measures. Participants who opted not to provide details on their demographic
background (e.g. gender and household income) were additionally excluded from the analysis.
Specifically, our 5 time points were the 5-7 days following the introduction of each of these measures:
(i) the first national lockdown (data captured 28 March-04 April 2020; N=12,053); (ii) the beginning

of lockdown rules easing (data captured 16-22 May 2020; N=24,374); (iii) further easing (data
captured 11-17 July 2020; N=21,395); (iv) new COVID-19 restrictions (data captured 19-25 September
2020; N=4,792); and (v) the three-tier system restrictions (data captured 17-23 October 2020;
N=4,526).
Measures
Caring responsibilities: Participants were asked whether they had caring responsibilities for elderly
relatives or friends, people with long-term conditions or disabilities, or grandchildren. A binary
variable was created to indicate if they had any of the responsibilities.
Outcome variables: Five mental health and wellbeing variables were considered. Depression was
measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); a standard instrument for diagnosing
depression in primary care which consists of 9 items with responses ranging from “not at all” to
“nearly every day”(26). Higher overall scores indicate more depressive symptoms. Anxiety was
measured using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder assessment (GAD-7); a well-validated tool used to
screen and diagnose generalised anxiety disorder in clinical practice and research (27). The
assessment includes 7 items with 4-point responses ranging from “not at all” to “nearly every day”,
with higher overall scores indicating more symptoms of anxiety. Loneliness was measured using the
3-item UCLA-3 loneliness, a short form of the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-R) (28). Each item
is rated with a 4-point rating scale, ranging from “never” to “always”, with higher score indicating
greater loneliness. Life satisfaction was measured using the Office for National Statistics (ONS)
personal wellbeing question “overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?”; a 10-point
scale. Sense of that life is worthwhile was measured using the ONS personal wellbeing question
“overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile?”; a 10-point scale
(29).
Covariates: This study considered a set of covariates that could be associated with both caring
responsibilities and/or mental health/wellbeing outcomes based on previous empirical research
(30,31). These included age groups (age 18-29 vs 30-59 vs 60+), gender (male vs female), ethnicity
(white vs ethnic minorities), living arrangement (living alone vs not living alone & not living with
children vs not living alone & living with children), marital status (single, never married vs single,
divorced/widowed vs in a relationship/married but living apart vs in a relationship/married and
cohabiting), education (up to GCSE levels vs A-levels or equivalent vs degree or above), employment
status (full-time employment/self-employed vs part-time employment vs economic inactive e.g.
students/retires/homemakers/unable to work vs unemployed & seeking work), household income
(<£30,000 vs >£30,000 per annum), whether living in an overcrowded household, whether the
participant identified as a keyworker, living area (a city vs a large town vs a small town vs a remote
area e.g. village/hamlet/isolated dwelling), whether being diagnosed a long-term mental health
condition, whether being diagnosed a long-term physical health condition, whether having minor or
major stress about COVID-19, whether or not being confirmed or suspected of contracting the COVID19 virus (confirmed/suspected vs not confirmed/not suspected), perceived social support (measured
using an adapted version of the 6-item short form of Perceived Social Support Questionnaire (F-SozU
K6); each item is rated on a 5-point scale from “not true at all” to “very true”. Minor adaptations were
made to the language in the scale to make it relevant to experiences during COVID-19. Higher scores
indicate greater perceived social support; see Supplementary Table 1 for a comparison of changes)
(32,33), personality (measured using the Big Five Inventory (BFI-2), which measures 5 domains and
15 facets: neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness.

Each item uses a 5-point scale ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”. Higher scores
indicate greater levels of each domain), and empathy (measured using the Interpersonal Reactivity
Index (IRI). Two scales were the focus in the COVID-19 Social Study, empathetic concern/”emotional
empathy” and perspective-taking/”cognitive empathy”. Both scales consist of 7 items with a 5-point
measure ranging from “does not describe me well” to “describe me very well”, and were
standardised. Higher scores indicate greater levels of empathetic concern/perspective-taking).
Statistics
Our analysis used PSM, a technique that stimulates an experimental setting in an observational data
set and creates a treatment group and a control group from the sample (34). One advantage of using
PSM over regression approaches is that it controls more effectively for the effects of observed
confounders, and hence while results remain observational, bias attributable to confounding can be
minimalised significantly. We used PSM to estimate the average treatment effect for the treated
(ATT), which is the difference between the average mental health/wellbeing outcomes of participants
who had caring responsibilities (carers) and the average outcomes for the same group under the
hypothetical scenario that they did not have any caring responsibilities (non-carers).
Specifically, the PSM was performed on an unweighted data, with the kernel matching method with
0.05 bandwidths to perform the matching. Kernel matching uses weighted averages of all individuals
in the control group to create the counterfactual outcome, and matches participants in the treatment
group to those in the control groups based on the distance of their propensity score. Higher weight
is given to the matches whose propensity scores are closer to each other and lower weight to those
whose propensity scores are distal from each other (35). A common support condition was imposed
to ensure the quality of the matches (31). 95% confidence intervals were computed using
bootstrapping techniques with 100 replications. Missing values were handled with list-wise deletion.
High quality of matching was achieved; all analyses show Rubin’s B<25%, Rubin’s R of 0.5-2, and a
percentage bias of <10% for each covariate (36) (Supplementary Table 2). This suggests that the
unobservable heterogeneity reduced significantly after matching. All analyses were carried out using
Stata/MP 16.1.
Sensitivity analyses were performed through assigning propensity scores using logistic regression
model on a weighted data. Results were very similar but the matching quality was lower. Results are
available from the authors upon request.
Results
Descriptive statistics
In our complete sample (participants who responded to all measures and who responded in any of
the 5 time points ), respondents who were informal carers in general were older (age 30-59: 59% vs
47% of non-carers), female (56% vs 50%), not living alone (88% vs 79%), living with a partner (71% vs
64%), had lower educational levels (degree or above: 27% vs 37%), not in full-time employment/selfemployment (59% vs 55%), were more likely to be keyworkers (29% vs 20%), not living in a city (72%
vs 65%), had a long-term mental health diagnosis (22% vs 19%), and were more likely to be
experiencing minor/major stress about COVID-19 (49% vs 42%) (Descriptive statistics were generated
from weighted data to show the representative of the demographics of the sample; Table 1).

Depression (PHQ-9)
Our results show that carers had more depressive symptoms than non-carers across all time-points
during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the estimated average treatment effect of being carers on the
levels of depression being the strongest during the first national lockdown in March and the most
modest during when lockdown measures were most relaxed in July (March: ATT=0.53, 95%CI=0.28,
0.77, p<0.001; May: ATT=0.43, 95%CI=0.27, 0.59, p<0.001; July: ATT=0.39, 95%CI=0.20, 0.59,

Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)
Similar to depression, we found that caring responsibilities were also associated with higher levels of
anxiety across all time-points during the pandemic. The estimated treatment effect of being carers
on the anxiety levels were the strongest during the first national lockdown in March and the threetier system lockdown in October, and were more modest when the restrictions were lower in May
and July (March: ATT=0.50, 95%CI=0.28, 0.72, p<0.001; May: ATT=0.38, 95%CI=0.23, 0.52, p<0.001;

Discussion
This study examined the differences in mental health and wellbeing between carers and non-carers
across different time points (March to October 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic using data from
England. Results showed that informal carers experienced higher levels of depression and anxiety
than people without caring responsibilities consistently across different time points during the
lockdown. The relationship between being a carer and poorer mental health was strongest during
periods of stricter social restrictions. There was no evidence that carers differed from non-carers in
loneliness and life satisfaction. However, we found that carers experienced a greater sense of their
lives being worthwhile at the beginning of the first lockdown in England, but no difference was found
at later time points when lockdown measures were eased in May and July 2020 or when new
restrictions were introduced in September and October 2020.
Our findings that carers had higher levels of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic
are consistent with existing literature before the pandemic highlighting the mental health burden of
informal caring (5,7) and with qualitative and small-scale cross-sectional studies during the COVID-19
pandemic (13,14,23,24). The negative effects of caregiving is commonly explained by the chronic
stress model. Care provision creates physical and psychological strain over extended periods of time,
which is accompanied by high levels of unpredictability and uncontrollability, frequently requires high
levels of vigilance, and creates secondary stress due to competing demands in other roles (5). Chronic
stress can lead to psychosocial distress and worsening mental health. The negative experiences
associated with caregiving were likely intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of cuts to
formal care, reduced paid working hours, reduced informal support from other relatives or friends,
restricted access to health care services, and fear of virus infection (12,14,15,25). Whilst these
results, therefore, are not especially surprising, they are still of particular concern in the context of
the pandemic. Many vulnerable individuals have been more reliant than ever before on their informal
carers. So if poor mental health leads to carer burnout, either affecting care during the pandemic or
the willingness and capacity to provide care in the aftermath of the pandemic, this could have
substantial implications for those individuals but also for the wider health and social care sector,
leaving more work to be carried out by formal carers. In light of this, it is critical that informal carers
are provided with adequate targeted mental health support so that they are psychologically able to
continue their caring responsibilities.

Aside from the negative psychological impacts, our study has shown that carers may also have
experienced a greater sense of life being worthwhile compared to non-carers in the early part of the
pandemic. This is in line with previous studies that show the positive experience of caregiving, such
as gratification, companionship, meaning, sense of purpose, personal growth and so forth (9–11).
Our findings on worthwhileness provide empirical support for the view that both negative and
positive experiences may emerge as independent dimensions as a result of caregiving (37). However,
it is important to note that the difference in worthwhileness between carers and non-carers was only
significant at the beginning of the lockdown. A potential explanation is that as the difficult situation
unfolded, the initial greater sense of worthwhileness and appreciation by those they were caring for
and others within communities may have been gradually eroded by the stresses of providing that
care but also by the decreasing social recognition of the roles carers were playing during the COVID19 pandemic. Similar patterns have been noted for formal carers, who experienced greater societal
appreciation in the early part of the pandemic (including with the national “clap for carers”) but who
simultaneously reported decreasing appreciation from the government as the pandemic continued
contributing to poorer morale (38).
It is also notable that we found no evidence that carers differs from non-carers in other wellbeing
measures, namely loneliness and life satisfaction, which seems to contradict to previous studies that
show the correlation between being an informal carer and higher levels of loneliness and lower levels
of life satisfaction (although results on life satisfaction are less conclusive as it varies across the types
of care, the health conditions of the care recipients, the length of care, etc.) (15,37,39,40). Previous
studies have suggested that the reasons for these higher levels of loneliness and lower levels of
wellbeing are that care provision is a time and energy consuming task that can restrict carers’
personal and social life. Indeed, a report from Carers UK showed that nearly half of the carers
reported not having time to spend on social activities and difficulties being able to leave the house
(40). However, such feelings may have changed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, even
though reports suggest loneliness and social isolation remained a challenge for many carers (15). Due
to the lockdown and social distancing measures, face-to-face social activities were greatly restricted
for the whole population. As a consequence, caring responsibilities may have reduced feelings of
isolation amongst carers as others experienced some of the same social restrictions that they faced
before the pandemic, and carers may have felt less of a sense of missing out. As carers had some
exemptions from the “stay at home” orders to visit the people they cared for, they might also have
been able to maintain companionship during these difficult times. This is supported by a report
showing that 2 in 5 young carers and 1 in 5 young adult carers built a stronger relationship with the
person they were caring for during the pandemic (22) and nearly 3 in 5 carers reported being able to
keep in touch with family and friends despite the lockdown measures (15). It is also possible that the
gap between loneliness and wellbeing levels amongst carers and non-carers was reduced as a
number of studies have shown that loneliness and poor wellbeing increased for the general
population (19).
This study had several limitations. First of all, the UCL COVID-19 Social Study did not use a random
sample, therefore our sample is not representative of the population. However, the study does have
a large sample size with wide heterogeneity, including good stratification across all major sociodemographic groups, and analyses were weighted based on population estimates of core
demographics, with the weighted data showing good alignment with national population statistics
and another large scale nationally representative social survey. But we cannot rule out the possibility
that the study inadvertently attracted individuals experiencing more extreme psychological

experiences, with subsequent weighting for demographic factors failing to fully compensate for these
differences. Secondly, the UCL COVID-19 Social Study did not collect any information before the
pandemic. Therefore, we were not able to compare the average treatment effect of being a carer
before and during the pandemic. Further work is needed to understand if the pandemic has
heightened the mental health risk for carers compared with usual times. Thirdly, this study treated
carer status as a binary variable, without further exploring the intensity of caregiving, which has
important implications for carers’ mental health and wellbeing. It is unknown whether individuals
took on new informal caring responsibilities during the pandemic or withdrew from usual informal
caring roles. Therefore, future work is needed to examine the role of care intensity and how
fluctuating patterns of care affected mental health (14). Relatedly, while PSM can effectively control
for observed confounding factors and can stimulate an experimental study on an observational
dataset where an experimental setting is not feasible, it is unable to capture unobserved confounding
factors. Therefore, future studies are needed to ascertain how experiences of carers vs non-carers
varied depending on the type of care provided, the quality of the relationship between carers and
the care recipients, and the health conditions of the care recipients. Finally, our analysis focused on
comparisons between carers and non-carers at different time points in the pandemic, using PSM to
control for confounding variables. However, this analysis did not show how the trajectories of mental
health and wellbeing changed for carers vs non carers, and this topic could be the focus of future
research.
Conclusions
The severe lockdown and social distancing measures implemented to control the spread of Covid-19
led to increasing burden for informal carers. The results of this study support some previous literature
suggesting that carers were more likely to experience higher levels of depression and anxiety during
the pandemic, as in non-pandemic circumstances. But they build on these findings by quantifying this
difference and showing how the trajectories of mental health experiences changed in line with
changing social restrictions during Covid-19. Carers were also more likely to feel a higher sense of life
being worthwhile compared to non-carers, but this effect was attenuated after the first lockdown. In
contrast to the existing studies, we found no differences in loneliness and life satisfaction between
carers and non-carers, suggesting either that the companionship provided through caring during
lockdown and social solidarity in experiencing social restrictions may have offered some emotional
benefits to carers, or that worsening levels of personal and social wellbeing amongst non-carers (as
documented in previous studies) closed the gap between the experiences of carers and non-carers.
As carers are an important support to the national health care support, it is therefore crucial to
integrate their needs into healthcare planning and delivery, especially when the health service is
stretched as during this pandemic. While there is some existing support available to carers, the results
presented here highlight the importance of ensuring adequate and targeted mental health provision
to support carers during and following this pandemic so that they are able to continue their vital
work.
