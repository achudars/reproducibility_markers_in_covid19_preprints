ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND. Neurological complications occur in COVID-19. We aimed to examine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of
COVID-19 subjects with neurological complications and determine presence of neuroinflammatory changes implicated
in pathogenesis.
METHODS. Cross-sectional study of CSF neuroinflammatory profiles from 18 COVID-19 subjects with neurological
complications categorized by diagnosis (stroke, encephalopathy, headache) and illness severity (critical, severe,
moderate, mild). COVID-19 CSF was compared with CSF from healthy, infectious and neuroinflammatory disorders
and stroke controls (n=82). Cytokines (IL-6, TNFa, IFNg, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A), inflammation and coagulation
markers (high-sensitivity-C Reactive Protein [hsCRP], ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, Factor VIII) and neurofilament light
chain (NF-L), were quantified. SARS-CoV2 RNA and SARS-CoV2 IgG and IgA antibodies in CSF were tested with
RT-PCR and ELISA.
RESULTS. CSF from COVID-19 subjects showed a paucity of neuroinflammatory changes, absence of pleocytosis or
specific increases in pro-inflammatory markers or cytokines (IL-6, ferritin, or D-dimer). Anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies
in CSF of COVID-19 subjects (77%) were observed despite no evidence of SARS-CoV2 viral RNA. A similar increase
of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNFa, IL-12p70) and IL-10 in CSF of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 stroke
subjects was observed compared to controls. CSF-NF-L was elevated in subjects with stroke and critical COVID-19.
CSF-hsCRP was present almost exclusively in COVID-19 cases.
CONCLUSION. The paucity of neuroinflammatory changes in CSF of COVID-19 subjects and lack of SARS-CoV2
RNA do not support the presumed neurovirulence of SARS-CoV2 or neuroinflammation in pathogenesis of neurological
complications in COVID-19. Elevated CSF-NF-L indicates neuroaxonal injury in COVID-19 cases. The role of CSF
SARS-CoV2 IgG antibodies is still undetermined.

INTRODUCTION
Central and peripheral nervous system disorders can develop in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection, during acute and/or postinfectious phases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19).(1, 2) These disorders are influenced by patient age, sex and pre-existing comorbidities and are mainly represented
by cerebrovascular pathologies and encephalopathies (3-7). The so-called “COVID-19 encephalitis”(8), acute
disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)(9), cranial neuropathies(10) and Guillain-Barré syndrome(11, 12) have also
been described as well as a high frequency of headache(13-15). There are several unanswered questions regarding the
pathogenesis of these neurological complications including concerns about the neuro-invasiveness or neurovirulence of
SARS-CoV2, the role of neuroinflammation and the effects of the “cytokine storm” on the central nervous system (CNS).
Studies focused on the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in COVID-19 infection have outlined a diversity of CSF
findings that lack specific profiles associated with the neurological symptoms(16-21). Interestingly, IgG antibodies
against SARS-CoV2 spike protein have been found in the CSF of eight patients with encephalopathy(22), and other
case reports have described changes suggestive of an inflammatory process(23, 24) and neuronal damage(25, 26). In
the present study, we explore the possible pathogenesis of COVID-19 associated neurological complications by
investigating for markers of neuroinflammation, the presence of SARS-CoV2 RNA and antibodies to SARS-CoV2. We
additionally compared the CSF from subjects with COVID-19 associated neurological complications with CSF of nonCOVID-19 patients with stroke, neurological infections and neuroinflammatory disorders, to compare the immune
profiles which may allow the recognition of common pathogenic pathways.

RESULTS
Patient clinical characteristics
A cross-sectional study to investigate immune and neuroinflammatory changes which may be associated with
pathogenesis of neurological involvement was performed in the CSF of 18 adult COVID-19 patients with neurological
manifestations and compared to those of 14 age matched healthy and 68 non-COVID-19 neurological disease controls.
Neurological manifestations in COVID-19 were categorized in three diagnostic groups: stroke (N=7),
encephalopathies (N=6) and headaches/others (N=5). The clinical and neuroimaging features, and systemic
inflammatory markers for all COVID-19 subjects are described in Table 1. The temporal profile of infection and
neurological symptoms, the time of diagnosis by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV2
in nasopharyngeal swab (NS) [NS-NAAT], CSF sampling and clinical events such as intubation/extubation are
outlined in Figure 1. The median age of the patients was 56 years (IQR 32-69). Ten patients were male (56%). Eight
(44%) patients were classified with critical illness, 5 (28%) with severe illness, 4 (22%) with moderate illness and 1
with mild illness. Six patients (33%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 hyperinflammatory syndrome (C-HIS)(27) of
whom four had encephalopathy. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was established by NS-NAAT in 16 patients, and two
patients were diagnosed based on positive serum anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG and IgA antibodies. The NS-NAAT CT value,
a presumptive indicator of the magnitude of viral infection(28, 29), was established in 12 patients, 7 of them with CT
<30. Four (22%) of the 18 patients died, while 13 (72%) improved. Of the 18 patients, 7 (39%) were diagnosed with
stroke, 6 (33%) had encephalopathy and 5 (27%) were diagnosed as headache/ other. Six of 18 (33%) patients had 3 or
more comorbidities while 9 (66%) had at least one comorbidity. Overall, the median time from onset of COVID-19 to
neurological symptoms was 0.5 days (IQR 0-10.5). Interestingly, in nine patients (50%), neurological manifestations
were part of the initial clinical presentation of COVID-19 symptoms (3 stroke, 4 encephalopathy and 2 headache). CSF
control samples were classified as: 1) healthy controls (n=14); 2) acute meningitis (n=12), 3) acute viral encephalitis
(e.g., herpes simplex, varicella-zoster encephalitis)(30) (n=11), 4) autoimmune encephalitis(31) (n=14), 5)
neuromyelitis optica (NMO)(32) (n=11), 6) neurosarcoidosis (33) (n=12), and 7) stroke (n=8), which included subjects
with ischemic stroke (34) preceding the COVID-19 period. Demographic characteristics for the control groups are
described in supplemental Table 1.

CSF characteristics
CSF features for the COVID-19 subjects are summarized in Table 2. The CSF was collected within 8 days of the first
positive NS-NAAT in 8 patients (44%, median 4 (IQR 1 - 6) while other 10 patients (56%, median 20 (IQR 13 - 27)
had a CSF collection 9 days or more after COVID-19 diagnosis. There was no evidence of CSF pleocytosis except in 4
subjects in which the increase of white cell count (WCC) was likely due to cross contamination with blood. In 8
subjects, the CSF protein was elevated, four of them likely influenced by an excessive number of red blood cells
and/or stroke. The CSF IgG index and CSF/albumin ratio (Qalb) were within normal range in 7 patients where these
indexes were tested. No evidence of oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in CSF or corresponding serum was found in 5 subjects
where this test was obtained.

SARS-CoV2 testing in CSF
We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV2 in all CSF samples from the COVID-19 group. None of the 18 CSF
samples from COVID-19 was positive for SARS-CoV2 RNA by RT-PCR. A subset of 7 CSF samples were also tested
with Reverse Transcription Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) with negative results. We also determined the presence of
anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG and IgA antibodies against subunit 1 of the trimeric SARS-CoV2 spike protein. IgG antibodies
to SARS-CoV2 spike protein were detected in 13 of 17 (77%) CSF tested while the anti-SARS-CoV2 IgA antibody
was detected in 4 of those CSF samples (Table 2, supplemental Figure 1). The titer of the IgG antibody did not
correlate with the period between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and CSF sampling (p=0.53) or period between
NS-NAAT diagnosis and CSF sampling (p=0.45). The presence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV2 in CSF was
observed in all COVID-19 diagnostic groups or disease severity categories. None of the 20 control samples tested for
COVID-19 antibodies were positive. In 6 COVID-19 subjects with IgG antibodies, there was almost complete absence
of WCC or RBC, although in 7 subjects RBC>50 was noted in CSF as result of either stroke (n=3) or possible
traumatic lumbar puncture (n=4)(supplemental Table 2).

Laboratory findings in CSF of COVID-19 and control groups
To determine the role that immune and pro-inflammatory factors may play in the pathogenesis of COVID-19
neurological complications, we quantified in the CSF the concentrations of cytokines (IL-6, TNFa, IFNg, IL-10, IL-

12p70, IL-17A), inflammation and coagulation markers (high-sensitivity-C Reactive Protein (hsCRP), ferritin,
fibrinogen, D-dimer, Factor VIII) and neurofilament light chain (NF-L). We compared the CSF from subjects with
COVID-19 associated neurological complications with CSF of non-COVID-19 subjects with neurological infections,
neuroinflammatory disorders and stroke to compare the immune profiles which may allow the recognition of common
pathogenic pathways. The description of CSF analytes in the COVID-19 diagnostic groups and control groups are
included in Table 3. Comparative analysis and statistical outcomes for all CSF analytes is shown in Figure 2. A
representative heat map of the P value significance for all analyte comparisons between the COVID-19 diagnostic
categories, disease severity and timing of CSF collection with the control groups are described in Figure 3. No
significant differences in the CSF WCC and protein concentrations between the three diagnostic categories of the
COVID-19 neurological problems were found. As compared with healthy controls, there were no significant
differences in the WCC and protein concentration with exception of the COVID-19 headache group which had a
significantly lower protein concentration. Overall, the WCC and protein concentrations were lower in COVID-19
cases as compared with neuroinflammatory controls. No significant differences were seen between COVID-19 and
non-COVID-19 stroke cases.

Markers of neuroaxonal degeneration: Quantification of neurofilament light chain (NF-L) in CSF was used as
indicator of neuroaxonal damage in COVID-19 and control subjects. When comparing based on severity, CSF NF-L
levels were significantly elevated in the critical COVID-19 group compared to the other severity categories. CSF
concentrations of NF-L were also markedly elevated in the COVID-19 stroke group as compared with healthy controls
(P=< 0.001) and the COVID-19 headache group (P=< 0.01). Although the COVID-19 encephalopathy group had an
elevated median NF-L concentration of 8408 pg/mL, compared to 1105 pg/mL of the healthy control group, this
difference was not statistically significant. As expected, NF-L concentrations were significantly elevated in the acute
encephalitis, autoimmune encephalitis and NMO controls groups as compared with COVID-19 encephalopathy.
However, the concentrations of NF-L were equivalent in the COVID-19 stroke group and the control stroke group.

Cytokine profiles: To establish the role of cytokines in pathogenesis of COVID-19 neurological complications, we
determined the CSF concentrations of selected cytokines IL6, TNFa, IFNg, IL-10, IL12p70 and IL17A described to be

involved in severe and critical COVID-19.(35-38) The concentrations, comparative analysis and statistical significance
between COVID-19 groups and controls for all 6 cytokines analyzed are described in Table 3, and Figures 2 and 3.
The sensitivity of the assay for detection of the of the six cytokines across all CSF diagnostic groups is described in
supplemental Table 3. Analysis of cytokines levels within the COVID-19 diagnostic categories showed that only
TNFa in the COVID-19 stroke group was significantly increased compared to the headache group (P=0.03). When the
COVID-19 diagnostic groups were compared with controls, the COVID-19 stroke group had significant elevated
concentrations of IL-6, TNFa, IL-10 and IL-12p70 as compared with the healthy control group. None of the COVID19 diagnostic groups, including the stroke group, showed any significant increase of cytokines as compared with
neuroinflammatory or non-COVID-19 stroke control groups. Instead, significant increased concentrations of selected
cytokines such as TNFa and IFNg were noted in neuroinflammatory groups such as acute meningitis and encephalitis
as compared with the COVID-19 stroke and encephalopathy groups. IFNg and IL-17A concentrations were reduced in
COVID-19 CSF as compared with inflammatory control groups such as acute meningitis, encephalitis and
neurosarcoidosis (Figure 3A). To determine whether such pattern of cytokines was specific to the COVID-19 stroke
group, we analyzed separately the cytokine profiles of the non-COVID-19 stroke group with other control groups. We
found the non-COVID-19 stroke group had significant increases in the concentrations of IL6, TNFa, IL-10 and IL12p70 as compared with the healthy control group, and reduced levels of IFNg and IL-17A as compared with acute
meningitis groups (Figure 3D), a profile similar to the one observed in the COVID-19 stroke group. Cytokines profiles
as related with COVID-19 disease severity and timing of CSF collection are summarized in the statistical significance
heatmap illustrated in Figure 3. When COVID-19 subjects were categorized by disease severity, the critical illness
group (n=8) had significantly increased levels of IL-10 and IL-12p70 when compared with healthy controls (Figure
3B). The timing of CSF collection did not show any significant change in the profile of COVID-19 cytokines with
exception of an increased IL-12p70 in the “early” COVID-19 CSF sampling group as compared with healthy controls
(Figure 3C). Interestingly, analysis of the COVID-19 subjects with C-HIS (n=6), which is characterized by marked
systemic inflammatory response or “cytokine storm”(27), showed that CSF cytokine levels did not have any significant
differences with the healthy control group. However, an analysis within the COVID-19 group showed levels of IL-6
and IL-10 were significantly elevated (P=0.02 and 0.01 respectively) while concentrations of INFg and IL-12p70 were

significantly lower (P=0.04 for both cytokines) in the COVID-19 C-HIS cases (n=6) when compared with other nonH-CIS COVID-19 cases (n=12). Interestingly, the concentration of IL-6 in the CSF of COVID-19 cases did not
correlate with the corresponding serum IL-6 (P=0.27). The effect of specific treatments (e.g., steroids, antivirals) on
CSF inflammatory markers was also evaluated. Of the 18 patients included in our cohort of COVID-19 subjects, only 2
subjects (1 and 2, Table 1) had received steroids during the 5 days preceding the lumbar puncture. None of the
COVID-19 patients received any of the experimental drugs used during the period prior to CSF collection.

Acute phase reactants and coagulation markers:
Acute phase reactants such as ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and coagulation markers including D-dimer,
fibrinogen and factor VIII, have been associated to be markers of severe and critical COVID-19. (39-42) To
investigate if they are associated with mechanisms of neurological involvement in COVID-19, we quantified such
markers in the CSF of COVID-19 subjects and controls. Using a high-sensitive CRP (hsCRP) assay, we found that
CRP was present almost exclusively in the CSF of COVID-19 subjects as it was detected in 7/18 subjects, 4 COVID19 encephalopathy and 3 COVID-19 stroke, while only one CSF (from an autoimmune encephalitis subject) of the 82
CSF controls had detectable hsCRP (P= 0.001). CSF hsCRP levels strongly correlated with CRP serum levels
(P=0.001, Spearman’s r 0.765). CSF hsCRP was present only in critical or severe COVID-19 subjects and was
elevated in 5 of 6 subjects with COVID-19 C-HIS. In contrast, while the CSF ferritin had a 100% detection rate in the
CSF of all COVID-19 and comparison groups (Table 3), there was not significant difference between the
concentrations of CSF ferritin when COVID-19 diagnostic groups were compared with healthy, neuroinflammatory or
stroke controls. However, an analysis within the COVID-19 diagnostic categories showed the stroke group had
significantly elevated levels of CSF ferritin as compared with the headache group (P=0.04). Interestingly, analysis of
COVID-19 categorized by disease severity showed that CSF ferritin levels in severe COVID-19 subjects were
significantly increased as compared with healthy controls and NMO cases (Figure 3). Similar findings were observed
in the “late” CSF collection group. However, those observations were likely biased by the inclusion of cases of
subarachnoid hemorrhage and ICH (e.g., cases 1,3 and 9), clinical situations well known for an increased CSF
ferritin(43). Importantly, CSF ferritin levels did not parallel serum ferritin levels (r 0.206, P=0.46), one of the most
important markers of systemic immune activation in COVID-19.(42, 44) Among markers of coagulation, CSF D-dimer

was present in 4 COVID-19 stroke subjects and in 25 of the CSF controls (P=0.06). CSF D-dimer was not significantly
different between COVID-19 groups and healthy controls. Instead, CSF D-dimer in cases of acute meningitis and
neurosarcoidosis was significantly increased as compared with COVID-19 encephalopathy cases. Markers of
coagulation such as fibrinogen and Factor VIII were undetectable in the CSF of COVID-19 subjects and comparison
controls.

DISCUSSION
In contrast with prevailing assumptions, our study reveals a paucity of neuroinflammatory changes as reflected by the
lack of specific increases in CSF pro-inflammatory cytokines or markers of systemic inflammation such as IL-6,
ferritin, or D-dimer as typically seen in serum of COVID-19 patients. These findings paralleled a lack of cellular
responses like pleocytosis or other markers of immunological activity within the CNS such as increase in IgG index or
OCBs. The absence of meaningful neuroinflammatory changes in the CSF of COVID-19 cases is further demonstrated
when it is compared to CSF from acute infectious or autoimmune neuroinflammatory pathologies that show
significantly greater inflammatory changes. Our study also reveals: 1) a prominent presence of SARS-CoV2
antibodies in absence of SARS-CoV2 viral RNA in the CSF of subjects with COVID-19 neurological complications;
2) elevated levels of CSF hsCRP in a subset of subjects with critical and severe COVID-19 illness; 3) marked increase
in CSF NF-L, a marker of neuroaxonal injury in cases of critical COVID-19 illness and stroke; 4) an essentially
equivalent increase of a subset of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CSF in cases of COVID-19 stroke and nonCOVID-19 stroke subjects.

The lack of CSF pleocytosis in COVID-19 subjects, normal protein, and absence of abnormalities in IgG index or
Q(Alb), concurs with other studies (16-20). This paucity of CSF inflammatory changes undermines the hypothesis that
conventional neuroinflammatory or encephalitic processes play roles in the pathogenesis of the most common
neurological complications associated with COVID-19 that were studied here. Furthermore, our case-control study
approach of CSF immune markers showed that in subjects with COVID-19 who experienced complications such as
stroke or encephalopathy, most of the CSF changes appear to be determined by other pathologies such as ischemic
disease likely driven by systemic or vascular factors that influence the development of such brain pathologies rather
than primary neuroimmune mediated processes. An important caveat is that we did not test the full spectrum of
reported neurologic complications in COVID-19, including multiple cranial neuropathies, ADEM, or GBS, and CSF
analysis in those conditions may show different results.
We failed to detect SARS-CoV2 viral RNA in the CSF of all COVID-19 subjects examined, concurring with other
studies(16, 18-21). The lack of SARS-CoV2 RNA in the CSF may be interpreted as lack of neuro-invasiveness,
absence of active viral replication or simply a relatively low viral trafficking into the CNS. Although the detection of

RNA viruses in CSF has been historically challenging in some viral disorders of the CNS,(45) the absence of viral
RNA along with the lack of pleocytosis and other inflammatory changes in the CSF of COVID-19 patients supports
the conclusion that there is not an active trafficking of SARS-CoV2 into the CNS causing neuroinflammation. This
distinguishes it from other RNA viruses like poliomyelitis, enterovirus, West-Nile virus that are difficult to detect but
produce blatant signs of neuroinflammation in the CSF(45-47).

A noteworthy observation in our study is a high prevalence (77%) of SARS-CoV2 spike IgG antibodies in the CSF of
COVID-19 cases. Given the absence of viral RNA in the CSF, the lack of pleocytosis which may facilitate B-cells
trafficking into the CNS, and absence of intrathecal IgG production (e.g., IgG index, OCBs), CSF antibodies to
SARS-CoV2 likely originate from serum and then transfer into the CNS despite an otherwise intact blood-CSF barrier,
as occurs in other CNS pathologies .(48) Alternatively, stroke or ischemic changes may have altered the CSF-blood
brain barrier to facilitate permeability of IgG antibodies. Presence of SARS-CoV2 antibodies in CSF has been also
reported by previous studies which raises the possibility that they are directly pathogenic in the neurological
complications of COVID-19(22, 49). In a prior study of eight encephalopathic or comatose patients with COVID-19, a
high titer of SARS-CoV2 IgG was observed in 50% of them, with one patient showing an increased IgG index(22).
Another study of 3 patients with COVID-19 critical illness found evidence of SARS-CoV2 IgM in the CSF(49). In our
study, the presence of SARS-CoV2 antibodies was not associated with specific COVID-19 diagnostic group or disease
severity. Although 7 of 13 COVID-19 subjects with positive SARS-CoV2 antibodies in the CSF had potential
“contamination” from blood derived from SAH, stroke or a traumatic lumbar puncture, six - did not exhibit any
meaningful WCC or RBC presence. Future studies looking for sites of SARS-CoV2 antibody cross reactivity in the
CNS, potential neurological effects or pathologic potential in animal models, would be helpful to clarify this question.

Notably, our study showed an impressive lack of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CSF of subjects with COVID-19
neurological problems. With the exception of COVID-19 stroke cases, COVID-19 encephalopathy or headache cases
did not show a noticeable pro-inflammatory cytokine response in the CSF as compared with controls. This observation
suggests that local increases of pro-inflammatory cytokines are unlikely the pathogenic factors associated with the
neurological symptoms observed in COVID-19 encephalopathy or headache. Only the CSF of the COVID-19 stroke

group appeared to have significant increase in IL-6, TNFa, IL10 and IL-12p70 as compared with the healthy control
group and the COVID-19 headache group. However, these cytokine increases were largely equivalent in the nonCOVID-19 stroke controls, suggesting that the cytokine increases in the brain of COVID-19 stroke subjects are likely
driven by stroke and ischemic pathology (50-52) rather than specific neuroinflammatory changes associated with
COVID-19. Furthermore, CSF from subjects with C-HIS showed not increases in proinflammatory cytokines as
compared with healthy controls although increases in IL-6 and IL-10 and lower IFNg and IL12p70 differentiate them
from non-C-HIS subjects. NF-L, a marker of neuroaxonal injury, was increased in stroke and critical COVID-19
cases, and within the COVID-19 cases, it was elevated in stroke and encephalopathy compared to the headache group.
Such observation emphasizes the fact that in critical and severe COVID-19 encephalopathy cases, a process of
neuronal injury occurs even in absence of neuroimaging evidence of stroke or ischemic injury and may suggest that
such neuronal damage is associated with ischemia, hypoxia and systemic illness. Such finding concurs with previous
observations of elevation of neuronal and glial proteins in the CSF in the setting of critical COVID-19 illness and
support the approach for using such proteins as potential biomarkers of disease process and outcome in future
serological studies. (53, 54)

Remarkably, our study demonstrated absent parallel increase in CSF of markers such as IL-6, ferritin, D-dimer or
coagulation factors as it has been observed in the serum of COVID-19 patients. A notable exception was the presence
of detectable levels of CSF hsCRP in a subset of subjects with critical and severe COVID-19 illness, stroke and
encephalopathy, which correlated with the magnitude of corresponding serum increase. The upsurge of CSF hsCRP in
COVID-19 subjects suggests that such acute phase reactant is linked to the mechanisms of stroke and ischemia during
acute and subacute stages of COVID-19. It is uncertain if CRP in CSF is actively or passively transported from serum,
due to brain endothelial pathology or from brain disease processes, as neurons may have capability to produce such
pentraxin. (55) Future studies should focus on determining the role of CRP in CSF, establishing the outcome of
neurological disease in COVID-19 subjects when CSF hsCRP is detected as its presence may have long-term
implications in mechanisms of neurodegeneration(55). Surprisingly, levels of CSF ferritin and D-dimer, showed no
significant increase and/or did not mirror the marked elevation observed in the serum levels in COVID-19 subjects.
CSF ferritin and D-dimer levels were elevated in COVID-19 cases mostly due to the presence of cases of SAH or

stroke with ICH. Remarkably, standard assays for quantification of fibrinogen and factor VIII in CSF failed to detect
such analytes in both COVID-19 and control cases including stroke cases, findings that suggest either the absence of
such molecules in the CSF or the lack of sensitivity of the assay for their detection.

Although the prospect of a consensus for common CSF signatures in patients with neurological manifestations of
COVID-19 is challenged by the diversity of clinical presentations, patient heterogeneity, overlapping risk factors and
co-morbidities, our study has further implications for the understanding of the neuropathogenesis of these neurological
complications. The paucity of neuroinflammatory changes in COVID-19 CSF rejects the prevailing assumption that
pro-inflammatory cytokines, primary neuroinflammation or SARS-CoV2 neurovirulence are the main drivers of
neuropathogenesis in COVID-19. We believe the few identified “neuroinflammatory” processes in the CSF of
COVID-19 (23, 24, 56) are mostly derived from homeostatic neuroglial responses by microglia and astroglia to
systemic pathology such as ischemia, hypoxia or systemic critical illnesses(57, 58) rather than active inflammation or
neurovirulence. However, in critical COVID-19 and some encephalopathy cases there are increased CSF markers of
neuroaxonal injury such as NF-L, supporting the view that CNS damage does occur in subsets of patients with
COVID-19. The pathologic mechanisms underlying this CNS damage remain unknown, though may be secondary to
microischemic injuries, severe systemic inflammation, and/or systemic metabolic dysfunction. Future postmortem and
animal studies will be helpful to elucidate these mechanisms. Another interesting future direction will be to investigate
the potential role of SARS-CoV2 antibodies in the pathogenesis of acute, subacute or even long-term consequences of
COVID-19 and effect on CNS function including in those cases of the reported “brain fog” and other neurological
symptoms in the so-called “long term haulers” (59).

The strengths of this study include a comprehensive analysis of markers of disease immunopathogenesis in the CSF
from COVID-19 subjects as compared with CSF from healthy controls, stroke and neuroinflammatory disorders
subjects, and a comprehensive clinical, neuroimaging and laboratory phenotyping of the subjects, but a few limitations
are important to mention. First, we mainly evaluated cytokines and immune factors which were selected based on their
previously reported relevance to COVID-19. This was a limited study of paired CSF-serum samples for cytokine and
antibody profiling. This was a necessary impediment because the limited availability of CSF and blood samples for

research purposes during the emergency situation as well as the financial constraints for expanding the scope of
testing. Moreover, during the period of the study, blood sampling in many patients with COVID-19 in a critical or
severe stage was restricted to standard diagnostic testing. Second, this study is limited to the clinical experience in a
tertiary referral center, a relatively small cohort of patients accrued during a short period of time and a small sample
size for the relatively high number of comparisons. Finally, and more generally, future multi-center studies should
include well acquired and phenotyped CSF repository samples that allow the expansion of analytical approaches of the
CSF to determine pathogenic factors involved in the neurological complications during acute and long-term
consequences of COVID-19.

METHODS
Study design: The CSF characteristics of a cross-sectional cohort of 18 hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients with
neurological manifestations, were compared to those of 14 age matched healthy and 68 non-COVID-19 neurological
disease controls to investigate immune and neuroinflammatory changes in the CSF which may be associated with
pathogenesis of neurological involvement. The sample size of the COVID-19 group was determined by convenience and
it corresponds to all COVID-19 patients that underwent CSF analysis during the period of study at our institution. The
COVID-19 CSF was collected from patients undergoing standard of care evaluation for COVID-19 neurological
complications at a tertiary care academic center during the period April 1 -July 31 2020. Only patients with complete
record of neurological examination by a neurologist, neuroimaging and NS-NAAT and/or immunological diagnosis of
COVID-19 were included. The CSF was examined for 1) the presence of SARS-CoV2 virus, 2) antibody responses
against SARS-CoV2, 3) selected cytokines associated with the systemic inflammatory response in COVID-19,(35-38)
4) markers of coagulation and acute phase reactants, and 5) NF-L, a marker of neuroaxonal damage. COVID-19
diagnosis was based on a positive NS-NAAT or demonstration of serum anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG or IgA antibodies.
Clinical information was gathered through standardized interviews with patients or patient surrogates, or through
electronic medical record (EMR) review if no interview was possible. Complete neurological examination, neuroimaging
and laboratory data were recorded in a REDCap database of the Johns Hopkins Division of Neuroimmunology and
Neuroinfectious Diseases-CSF Biorepository (NINI-CSFBiorep).

Clinical definitions for COVID-19 group: Neurological manifestations in COVID-19 were categorized in three
diagnostic groups: stroke, encephalopathies and headaches/others. COVID-19 stroke cases included subjects with
ischemic stroke from intracranial atherosclerosis, cardioembolic, small vessel disease and other causes (34) and/or
hemorrhagic stroke including intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages confirmed by clinical and neuroimaging
assessment. COVID-19 encephalopathy diagnosis included subjects with diffuse neurological dysfunction with altered
consciousness with change in cognition and/or with a perceptual disturbance not better accounted for by a pre-existing
or evolving chronic dementia (60) or sedation without evidence of stroke. Subjects with headache without mental status
changes, with or without cranial nerve involvement without evidence of stroke or other structural lesions were classified
in the group of headaches/other. COVID-19 disease severity was based on National Institutes of Health (NIH)

Guidelines (61) and defined as follows: 1) Critical illness: respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ
dysfunction 2) Severe illness: respiratory frequency >30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SaO2) ≤93% on room
air at sea level, a ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300 mmHg or
lung infiltrates >50%; 3) Moderate illness: Evidence of lower respiratory disease by clinical assessment or imaging and
SaO2 >93% on room air at sea level and 4) Mild Illness: Individuals who had any of various signs and symptoms (e.g.,
fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain) without shortness of breath, dyspnea, or abnormal imaging.
We determined the presence of COVID-19 hyperinflammatory syndrome (C-HIS) based on the clinical profile and
combination of markers of systemic inflammation (e.g., ferritin, D-dimer, CRP and IL-6)(27). To determine the effect
of time to CSF sampling as related with period of infection, two groups were established: An “early” CSF collection
group for samples obtained within 8 days of the first positive NS-NAAT, and a “late” CSF collection group for samples
obtained 9 days or after(62).

Clinical definitions for control groups: Convenience CSF control group samples collected prior to the COVID-19
pandemic were used. The CSF samples were derived from newly diagnosed, treatment naïve and well characterized
subjects available at the NINI-CSFBiorep and selected with the best attempt to match by age (+/- 5 years) the COVID19 CSF samples. CSF control samples were classified as: 1) healthy controls, comprised by subjects with normal
neurological examination and normal brain MRI who underwent evaluation for headaches or pseudotumor cerebri; 2)
acute infectious meningitis, 3) acute viral encephalitis (e.g., herpes simplex, varicella-zoster encephalitis)(30), 4)
autoimmune encephalitis (31), 5) NMO (32), 6) neurosarcoidosis (33), and 7) stroke, which included subjects with
ischemic stroke (34) preceding the COVID-19 period.

Laboratory studies:
SARS-CoV2 virus and anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody detection in CSF: NAAT of SARS-CoV2 RNA in CSF was
performed by RT-PCR. Two regions of the nucleocapsid (N) gene (N1 and N2) were used as assay targets per the FDA
Emergency Use Authorization package insert (https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download). ddPCR was used to
confirm the results on a subset of the specimens (https://www.fda.gov/media/137579/download). The human RNase P
gene (RP) was the internal control for both assays(63). Quantification of anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG and IgA antibodies used

a previously validated ELISA kit (Euroimmune, Germany)(64) which identify antibodies against subunit 1 of the trimeric
SARS-CoV2 spike protein. The cutoff for positivity was 1.23 units for IgG and 5 units for IgA as established previously
(64).
Cytokine profiling: Quantification of the cytokines IL6, TNFa, IFNg, IL-10, IL12p70 and IL17a was performed using
the Simoa™. Cytokine 6‐plex panel array assay using a Quanterix HD‐X ® analyzer. CSF NFL was measured using the
Simoa™ NF-Light Kit (Quanterix Corporation, Lexington, MA, USA) on the Quanterix HD-X® platform.
Acute phase reactants and coagulation markers: Ferritin and hsCRP were measured on Roche Diagnostics Cobas c
701 and e 801 analyzers, respectively. Fibrinogen quantification used a clot-based assay (Siemens, Marburg Germany).
D-dimer was measured by an immunoturbidimetric assay (Innovance D-Dimer, Siemens, Marburg, Germany). Factor
VIII assessment used a chromogenic Assay (Chromogenix, Bedford, MA).

Statistics: Continuous variables were described using medians and interquartile ranges, while categorical features with
percentages. Planned comparisons between COVID-19 and control groups were performed using Mann-Whitney test.
All 3 COVID-19 diagnostic categories were compared with each control group and with each other. For CSF hsCRP and
D-dimer, outputs were dichotomized with 0.2 mg/L as the cut-off considering the bimodal concentrations found; An
initial global test assessed differences in groups and was followed by individual Fisher’s exact tests for comparison
among groups. For analysis of cytokines, values with a coefficient of variation higher than 30% were disregarded.
Missing concentration values below the lower limit of detection were calculated by dividing the lower limit of
quantification (LLOQ) corresponding for each cytokine by the square root of 2. Spearman’s correlation coefficient (Rho;
ρ) was evaluated as well for relating NF-light concentrations with the other immunomarkers. Significant p values were
set below 0.05. We specified our primary analyses as global tests comparing COVID-19 groups versus healthy and
neurologic disease controls, and we considered our study to be exploratory in nature. As a result, we did not adjust for
multiple comparisons. Analytes other than cytokines were analyzed with the obtained raw data. Statistical analysis was
performed in Stata v.14. (StataCorp, Texas, USA).
