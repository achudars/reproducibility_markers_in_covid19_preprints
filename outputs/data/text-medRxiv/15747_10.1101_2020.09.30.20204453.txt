Abstract

Background: Age and gender are often the only considerations in determining risk of severe
COVID-19. There is an urgent need for accurate prediction of the risk of severe COVID-19
for use in workplaces and healthcare settings, and for individual risk management.

Methods: Clinical risk factors and a panel of 64 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were
identified from published data. We used logistic regression to develop a model for severe
COVID-19 in 1,582 UK Biobank participants aged 50 years and over who tested positive for
the SARS-CoV-2 virus: 1,018 with severe disease and 564 without severe disease. Model
discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC).

Results: A model incorporating the SNP score and clinical risk factors (AUC=0.786) had
111% better discrimination of disease severity than a model with just age and gender
(AUC=0.635). The effects of age and gender are attenuated by the other risk factors,
suggesting that it is those risk factors – not age and gender – that confer risk of severe
disease. In the whole UK Biobank, most are at low or only slightly elevated risk, but onethird are at two-fold or more increased risk.

Conclusions: We have developed a model that enables accurate prediction of severe COVID19. Continuing to rely on age and gender alone to determine risk of severe COVID-19 will
unnecessarily classify healthy older people as being at high risk and will fail to accurately
quantify the increased risk for younger people with comorbidities.

Introduction

The current COVID-19 pandemic is a dominating and urgent threat to public health and the
global economy. While COVID-19 can be a mild disease in many individuals, with cough
and fever the most commonly reported symptoms, up to 30% of those affected may require
hospitalisation, and some will require intensive intervention for acute respiratory distress
syndrome.1,2

Globally, public health responses have been aimed at limiting new cases by preventing
community transmission through mask wearing, social distancing, curtailing non-essential
services and broad travel restrictions. The economic and social impacts of these interventions
have been devastating, with foundational damage to local economies3 and unprecedented
increases in mental health diagnoses being reported.4

As the protracted strain of the pandemic increases pressure to re-open economies, there is an
urgent need for tests to predict an individual’s risk of severe COVID-19. In the community, a
risk prediction test could enable workplaces to confidently manage employees who are at
increased risk of severe disease and should work from home or avoid client-facing roles. In
the healthcare setting, a risk prediction test could inform patient triage when hospital
resources are limited and be useful in prioritising pathology tests and vaccination (when one
becomes available). On a personal level, knowledge of individual risk can empower
individuals to make informed choices about day-to-day activities.

Age, gender and comorbidities are frequently cited as risk factors for severe COVID-19,5 but
these have generally been considered independently without accurate knowledge of the
magnitude of their effect on risk, potentially resulting in incorrect risk estimation. Early
epidemiological analyses of the factors associated with COVID-19 severity and death have

now appeared, including an analysis of a cohort of 17 million people by Williamson et al.6
and a prospective cohort study of 5,279 people in New York,7 both based on the analysis of
electronic health records.

The analysis of human genetic variation that may affect response to viral infection has been
slower, largely due to the lack of available data. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 Host Genetics
Initiative has undertaken meta-analyses of the genetic determinants of COVID-19 severity
and has made the summary statistics publicly available.8,9 In addition, Ellinghaus et al.10
identified two loci (3p21.31 and 9q34.2) that are strongly associated with severe disease.

We used the UK Biobank to develop a comprehensive model to predict risk of severe
COVID-19 by integrating demographic information, comorbidity risk factors and a panel of
genetic markers.

Methods
UK Biobank data
The UK Biobank is a population-based prospective cohort of over 500,000 participants from
England, Wales and Scotland who were aged 40 to 69 years when recruited from 2006 to
2010.11 The UK Biobank has extensive genotyping12 and phenotypic data obtained from
baseline assessment and from linkage to hospital and primary care databases and to cancer
and death registries.11

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK Biobank made available up-to-date SARSCoV-2 testing, hospital, primary care and death data for use in COVID-19 research by
approved researchers.13 We extracted testing and hospital records from the UK Biobank
COVID-19 data portal on 15 September 2020. We extracted single-nucleotide polymorphism

(SNP) and baseline assessment data from files previously downloaded as part of our
approved project. At the time of data extraction, primary care data was only available for just
over half of the identified participants and was therefore not used in these analyses.

Eligibility
Eligible participants were those who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and for whom SNP
genotyping data and linked hospital records were available. Of the 18,221 participants with
SARS-CoV-2 test results, 1,713 had tested positive and 1,582 of those had both SNP and
hospital data available.

COVID-19 severity
We used source of test result as a proxy for severity of disease: outpatient representing nonsevere disease and inpatient representing severe disease. For participants with multiple test
results, we considered the disease to be severe if at least one result came from an inpatient
setting.

Selection of SNPs for risk of severe COVID-19
We identified 62 SNPs from the (release 2) results of the meta-analysis of non-hospitalised
versus hospitalised cases of COVID-19 conducted by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative
consortium.8,9 We used P<0.0001 as the threshold for loci selection and variants that were
associated with hospitalisation in only one of the five studies in the meta-analysis were
removed. We pruned for linkage disequilibrium using an r2 threshold of 0.5 against the 1000
Genomes European populations (CEU, TSI, FIN, GBR and IBS) representing the ethnicities
of the submitted populations.14 Variants that had a minor allele frequency of ≥0.01 and beta
coefficients from −1 to 1 were then retained.15 Where possible, SNP variants were chosen
over insertion–deletion variants to facilitate laboratory validation testing. We also included

the two lead SNPs from the loci found by Ellinghaus et al.10 that reached genome-wide
significance. Therefore, we used a panel of 64 SNPs for severe COVID-19 in this study
(Table S1, Supplementary Appendix).

SNP score
While we would normally construct a SNP relative risk score using published data to
calculate population-averaged risk values for each SNP and then multiplying the risks for
each SNP,16 the size of the odds ratios for the 64 SNPs meant that this approach could result
in relative risks of several orders of magnitude. Therefore, for this study, we calculated the
percentage of risk alleles present in the genotyped SNPs for each participant. We used the
percentage rather than a count because some of the eligible participants had missing data for
some SNPs (9% had all SNPs genotyped, 82% were missing 1–5 SNPs and 9% were missing
6–15 SNPs).

Imputation of ABO genotype
Blood type was imputed for genotyped UK Biobank participants using three SNPs (rs505922,
rs8176719 and rs8176746) in the ABO gene on chromosome 9q34.2. A rs8176719 deletion
(or for those with no result for rs8176719, a T allele at rs505922) indicated haplotype O. At
rs8176746, haplotype A was indicated by the presence of the G allele and haplotype B was
indicated by the presence of the T allele.17,18

Clinical risk factors
Risk factors for severe COVID-19 were identified from large epidemiological studies of
electronic health records6,7 and advice posted on the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention website.19 Rare monogenic diseases (thalassemia, cystic fibrosis and sickle cell
disease) were not included in these analyses.

Age was classified as 50–59 years, 60–69 years and 70+ years. This was based on the
participants’ approximate age at the peak of the first wave of infections (April 2020) and was
calculated using the participants’ month and year of birth. Self-reported ethnicity was
classified as white and other (including unknown). The Townsend deprivation score at
baseline was classified into quintiles defined by the distribution in the UK Biobank as a
whole. Body mass index and smoking status were also obtained from the baseline assessment
data. Body mass index was inverse transformed and then rescaled by multiplying by 10.
Smoking status was defined as current versus past, never or unknown. The other clinical risk
factors were extracted from hospital records by selecting records with ICD9 or ICD10 codes
for the disease of interest (Table S2, Supplementary Appendix).

Statistical methods
We used logistic regression to examine the association of risk factors with severity of
COVID-19 disease. We began with a base model that included SNP score, age group and
gender. We then included all the candidate variables and used backwards step-wise selection
to remove those with P values >0.05. We then refined the final model by considering the
addition of the removed candidate variables one at a time. Model selection was informed by
examination of the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion, with
a decrease of >2 indicating a statistically significant improvement.

Model calibration was assessed using the Pearson–Windmeijer goodness-of-fit test and model
discrimination was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC). To compare the effect sizes of the variables in the final model, we used the odds per
adjusted standard deviation20 using dummy variables for age group and ABO blood type.
Sensitivity analyses were undertaken by including participants with no hospital records.

We used the intercept and beta coefficients from the final model to calculate the COVID-19
risk score for all UK Biobank participants.

All statistical analyses were conducted by GSD. We used Stata (version 16.1)21 for analyses;
all statistical tests were two-sided and P values <0.05 were considered nominally statistically
significant.

Ethics approval
The UK Biobank has Research Tissue Bank approval (REC #11/NW/0382) that covers
analysis of data by approved researchers. All participants provided written informed consent
to the UK Biobank before data collection began. We conducted this research using the UK
Biobank resource under Application Number 47401.

Results

Of the 1,582 UK Biobank participants with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and hospital
and SNP data available, 564 (35.7%) were from an outpatient setting and considered not to
have severe disease (controls), while 1,018 (64.3%) were from an inpatient setting and
considered to have severe disease (cases). Cases ranged in age from 51 to 82 years with a
mean of 69.1 (standard deviation [SD]=8.8) years. Controls ranged in age from 50 to 82 years
with a mean of 65.0 (SD=9.0) years. Mean body mass index was 29.0 kg/m2 (SD=5.4) for
cases and 28.5 (SD=5.4) for controls. Body mass index was transformed to the inverse
multiplied by 10 for all analyses and ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 for both cases and controls. The
percentage of risk alleles in the SNP score ranged from 47.6 to 73.8 for cases and from 43.7
to 72.5 for controls. The distributions of the variables of interest for cases and controls and
the unadjusted odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are shown in Table 1.

The adjusted odds ratios for the variables included in the final model are shown in Table 2.
This model included SNP score, age group, gender, ethnicity, ABO blood type, and a history
of autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or psoriasis), haematological cancer, nonhaematological cancer, diabetes, hypertension or respiratory disease (excluding asthma) and
was a good fit to the data (Windmeijer’s H=0.02, P=0.88). The SNP score was strongly
associated with severity of disease, increasing risk by 19% per percentage increase in risk
alleles. The effect of age was only evident in the group aged 70 years and over, and while
gender was not statistically significant (P=0.26), it was retained because it was one of the
three variables considered the base model to which other variables were added. Ethnicity
showed a 43% increase in risk for non-whites but was only marginally statistically significant
(P=0.06). The AB blood type was protective (P=0.007), but the protective effect of blood
type A and the increased risk for blood type B were not statistically significant (P=0.10 and
P=0.41, respectively). Table 2 also shows the odds per adjusted standard deviation for the
final model. This allows direct comparisons of the strength of the associations for each
variable, regardless of the scales on which they were measured. The SNP score was, by far,
the strongest predictor followed by respiratory disease and age 70 years or older. Sensitivity
analyses including those with no linked hospital records did not change the conclusions
presented here (Table S3, Supplementary Appendix).

The receiver operating characteristic curves for the final model and for alternative models
with clinical factors only (Table S4, Supplementary Appendix); SNP score only (Table 1);
and age and gender (Table S5, Supplementary Appendix) are shown in Figure 1. The SNP
score alone had an AUC of 0.680 (95% CI, 0.652 to 0.708). The model with age and gender
had an AUC of 0.635 (95% CI, 0.607 to 0.662), while the model with clinical factors only
had an AUC of 0.723 (95% CI, 0.698 to 0.749). Given that the minimum possible value for
an AUC is 0.5, the model with clinical factors only was a 65% improvement over the model

with age and gender (χ2=57.97, df=1, P<0.001). The full model had an AUC of 0.786 (95%
CI, 0.763 to 0.808) and was an 28% improvement over the model with clinical factors only
(χ2=39.54, df=1, P<0.001), a 59% improvement over the SNP score (χ2=71.94, df=1,
P<0.001), and a 111% improvement over the model with age and sex (χ2=113.67, df=1,
P<0.001).

Figure 2 illustrates the difference in the distributions of the COVID-19 risk scores in cases
and controls. The median score was 3.35 for cases and 0.90 for controls, with inter-quartile
ranges of 6.70 and 1.34, respectively. Sixteen per cent of cases and 53% of controls had
COVID-19 risk scores of less than 1, and 18% of cases and 25% of controls had scores ≥1
and <2. COVID-19 risk scores ≥2 were more common in cases than in controls, with 13% of
cases and 9% of controls having scores ≥2 and <3, 8% of cases and 4% of controls having
scores ≥3 and <4, and 45% of cases and 9% of controls having scores ≥4.

Figure 3 shows that the distribution of the COVID-19 risk score in the whole UK Biobank is
similar to that for the controls in Figure 2b. The median COVID-19 risk score in the whole
UK Biobank was 1.32 and the inter-quartile range was 1.80. Thirty-eight per cent of the UK
Biobank have COVID-19 risk scores of less than 1, while 29% have scores ≥1 and <2, 13%
have scores ≥2 and <3, 6% have scores ≥3 and <4, and 14% have scores of ≥4.

Discussion

One of the main issues of the COVID-19 pandemic is that of susceptibility to severe disease.
We have shown that a comprehensive risk prediction test that quantifies the varying effects of
clinical risk factors and a SNP risk score has an AUC of 0.786 and improves risk
discrimination of severe COVID-19 by 111% compared with a model using age and gender
(P<0.001). Examination of the odds per adjusted standard deviation (Table 2) shows that the

SNP score is the strongest risk factor for severe COVID-19. While the SNP score explains
more variance in disease severity than all of the other risk factors in the model combined, the
full model discriminates better than the clinical factors alone or the SNP score alone (both
P<0.001).

The strong associations observed in the model consisting of just age and gender (Table S4,
Supplementary Appendix) are attenuated by the inclusion of other risk factors. This is due to
the comorbidities in the full model being more prevalent in older people and in men, and it is
the comorbidities – not age and gender – that are associated with severe disease. Relying on
age and gender alone to determine risk of severe COVID-19 will unnecessarily classify
healthy older people as being at high risk and will fail to accurately quantify the increased
risk for younger people with comorbidities.

Our study does have some limitations. We used source of test result as a proxy for severity of
disease. Therefore, there is considerable opportunity for misclassification of disease severity
but this would be likely to attenuate the magnitude of the associations. Townsend deprivation
score, BMI and current smoking status were taken from the baseline assessment data and may
not represent the participants’ current status. This may have contributed to these variables not
being statistically significant. Until mid-May, testing for COVID-19 in the UK was limited to
those who had recognisable symptoms and were essential workers, contacts of known cases,
hospitalised or had returned from overseas.22 Therefore, many asymptomatic or very mild
cases from the first wave of the pandemic will not have been identified in this dataset.
Nevertheless, our results remain applicable to those who develop symptoms that warrant
medical attention.

While the vast majority of UK Biobank participants are at low or only slightly elevated risk
of severe COVID-19 (Figure 3), we can identify those who are likely to be at substantially
increased risk. Our risk prediction test for severe COVID-19 in people aged 50 years or older
has great potential for wide-reaching benefits in managing the risk for essential workers, in
healthcare settings and in workplaces that seek to re-open safely. The test will also enable
individuals to make informed choices based on their personal risk. However, key to
understanding the performance of our risk prediction test will be validation in independent
data sets, work that we are planning to undertake in the near future.
