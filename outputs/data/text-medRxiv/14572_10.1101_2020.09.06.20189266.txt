Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks have been used to investigate the influence of
SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins on the function of human cells, laying out a deeper understanding
of COVID–19 and providing ground for drug repurposing strategies. However, our knowledge of (dis)similarities between this one and other viral agents is still very limited. Here we
compare the novel coronavirus PPI network against 45 known viruses, from the perspective
of statistical physics. Our results show that classic analysis such as percolation is not sensitive to the distinguishing features of viruses, whereas the analysis of biochemical spreading
patterns allows us to meaningfully categorize the viruses and quantitatively compare their
impact on human proteins. Remarkably, when Gibbsian-like density matrices are used to
represent each system’s state, the corresponding macroscopic statistical properties measured
by the spectral entropy reveals the existence of clusters of viruses at multiple scales. Overall,
our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits similarities to viruses like SARS-CoV and Influenza A at small scales, while at larger scales it exhibits more similarities to viruses such as
HIV1 and HTLV1.

The COVID–19 pandemic, with global impact on multiple crucial aspects of human life, is

2

still a public health threat in most areas of the world. Despite the ongoing investigations aiming

3

to find a viable cure, our knowledge of the nature of disease is still limited, especially regarding

4

the similarities and differences it has with other viral infections. On the one hand, SARS-CoV-

5

2 shows high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV 1 — the virus causing 2003 coronavirus outbreak

6

— and its infection shares a number of symptoms with some other respiratory diseases, such as

7

flu caused by Influenza virus. On the other hand, according to a number of studies

8

usually used to treat different infection types, like AIDS caused by Human Immunodeficiency

9

Virus (HIV), can effectively mitigate COVID–19, suggesting an unexplored parallel between the

10

function of other viruses and SARS-CoV-2. Characterizing these (dis)similarities can result in a

11

deeper understanding of the novel coronavirus and facilitate the search for reliable treatments.

Here, we use statistical physics to analyze 45 viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. We consider

the virus-human protein-protein interactions (PPI) as an interdependent system with two parts,

22

its structural properties barely change after being merged with viral components. Consequently,

we show that percolation analysis of such interdependent systems provides no information about

the distinguishing features of viruses. Instead, we model the propagation of perturbations from

26

spreading patterns and compare the average impact of viruses on human proteins. Finally, we

27

exploit Gibbsian-like density matrices, recently introduced to map network states, to quantify the

28

impact of viruses on the macroscopic functions of human PPI network, such as von Neumann

29

entropy. The inverse temperature β is used as a resolution parameter to perform a multiscale

30

analysis. We use the above information to cluster together viruses and our findings indicate that

31

SARS-CoV-2 groups with a number of pathogens associated with respiratory infections, including

32

SARS-CoV, Influenza A and Human Adenovirus (HAdV) at the smallest scales, more influenced

33

by local topological features. Interestingly, at larger scales, it exhibits more similarity with viruses

34

from distant families such as HIV1 and Human T- cell Leukemia Virus type 1 (HTLV1).

35

Our results shed light on the unexplored aspects of SARS-CoV-2, from the perspective of

36

statistical physics of complex networks, and the presented framework opens the doors for further

37

theoretical developments aiming to characterize structure and dynamics of virus-host interactions,

38

as well as grounds for further experimental investigation and potentially novel clinical treatments.

Here, we use data regarding the viral proteins and their interactions with human proteins for 45

41

viruses (see Methods and Fig. 1). To obtain the virus-human interactomes, we link the data to the

comprehensive public repositories (see Methods and Fig. 2).

certain property of the system, instead of selecting the nodes randomly, they can be sequentially

removed following that criteria. For instance, if we want to find out what is the relevance of the

most connected elements on the functionality, we can remove a fraction of the nodes with largest

degree 21, 22 . Technically, the criteria can be whatever metric that allows us to rank nodes, although

60

in practical terms topologically-oriented protocols are the most frequently used due to their ac-

61

cessibility, such as degree, betweenness, etc. Therefore percolation is, at all effects, a topological

62

analysis, since its input and output are based on structural information.

63

In the past, the usage of percolation has been proved useful to shed light on several aspects

64

of protein-related networks, such as in the identification of functional clusters 23 and protein com-

65

plexes 24 , the verification of the quality of functional annotations 25 or the critical properties as a

66

function of mutation and duplication rates 26 , to name but a few. Following this research line, we

67

perform the percolation analysis to all the PPI networks to understand if this technique brings any

68

information that allows us to differentiate among viruses. The considered protocols are the random

69

selection of nodes, the targeting of nodes by degree – i.e., the number of connections they have –

70

and their removal by betweenness centrality – i.e., a measure of the likelihood of a node to be in

71

the information flow exchanged through the system by means of shortest paths. We apply these

72

attack strategies and compute the resulting (normalized) size of the largest connected component

73

S in the network, which serves as a proxy to the remaining functional part, as commented above.

74

This way, when S is close to unity the function of the network has been scarcely impacted by the

75

intervention, while when S is close to 0 the network can no longer be operative. The results are

76

shown in Fig. 3. Surprisingly, for each attacking protocol, we observe that the curves of the size of

77

the largest connected component neatly collapse in a common curve. In other words, percolation

78

analysis completely fails at finding virus-specific discriminators. Viruses do respond differently

79

depending on the ranking used, but this is somehow expected due to the correlation between the

80

metrics employed and the position of the nodes in the network.

81

We can shed some light on the similar virus-wise response to percolation by looking at

82

topological structure of the interactomes. Despite being viruses of diverse nature and causing such

83

different symptomatology, their overall structure shows a high level of similarity when it comes

84

to the protein-protein interaction. Indeed, for every pair of viruses we find the fraction of nodes

85

fN and fraction of links fL that simultaneously participate in both. Averaging over all pairs, we

86

obtain that fN = 0.9996 ± 0.0002 and fL = 0.9998 ± 0.0007. That means that the interactomes

87

are structurally very similar, so the dismantling ranks. If purely topological analysis is not able

88

to differentiate between viruses, then we need more convoluted, non-standard techniques to tackle

89

this problem. In the next sections we will employ these alternative approaches.

Analysis of perturbation propagation. PPI networks represent the large scale set of in-

binding and the formation of complexes. The analytical treatment of these processes is described

132

With Ii not being dependent on the source degree, these results support the idea that with these

133

specific forms of dynamical processes on the top of the interactome, the overall impact of a pertur-

bation generated by a virus is proportional to the amount of human proteins it interacts with.

135

Results shown in Fig. 5 highlight that propagation patterns strongly depend on the sources

136

(i.e., the affected nodes V), and strong similarities will generally be found within the same family

137

and for viruses that share common impacted proteins in the interactome. Conversely, families

138

and viruses with small (or null) overlap in the sources exhibit low similarity and are not sharply

139

distinguishable. To cope with this, we adopt a rather macroscopic view of the interactomes in the

140

next section.

Analysis of spectral information. We have shown that the structural properties of human

144

contrast, the propagation of biochemical signals from viral components into human PPI network

145

has been shown successful in assessing the viruses in terms of their average impact on human

146

proteins. Remarkably, the propagation patterns can be used to hierarchically cluster the viruses,

although some of them are highly dependent on the choice of threshold (Fig. 5). In this section,

we use statistical physics of complex networks to go beyond the microscopic details provided by

149

propagation patterns and analyze the macroscopic features of virus-human PPI networks.

150

A variety of methods have been introduced to analyze the information content of complex

151

networks 32, 33 . Since networks can be viewed as collections of entangled entities, a density matrix

152

can be used to describe their state as in quantum statistical mechanics. While some choices of the

density matrix have been shown to be unphysical

The density matrix is defined in terms of the combinatorial Laplacian matrix L = D − A,

where D is defined as Dii = ki δij and ki =

matrix governs the diffusion dynamics on top of the network and is involved in the linear stability

analysis of many complex dynamics, such as synchronization. Here we use the Gibbs state given

Figure 6: Perturbation analysis of the virus-host interactome. On the top, the BIOSTR human
interactome G is targeted by viral proteins, considered as microscopic perturbations (δG), to build
the virus-human interactome G 0 . Here, the SARS-CoV-2 interactome is shown, while excluding
the 10% human proteins with the highest degree, for clarity. The interdependence is reflected in the
macroscopic functions of the network (right-hand side tables), including the thermodynamic and
dynamic features considered in this study. Interacting with the viral nodes perturbs the macroscopic
properties of the human PPI network (bottom-left panel), captured by the von Neumann entropy
S(β, G), the Massieu function Φ(β, G) and the energy βU(β, G). Based on the von Neumann
entropy and Massieu function perturbations, k-means algorithm is used to cluster the viruses at
different scales corresponding to distinct choices of β (bottom-right panel). The trajectories at the
bottom indicate how the perturbation changes with β and their colors are set by the clustering plot
given at β ≈ 3.

encoding the information content of graph G. Finally, the difference between von Neumann en-

169

tropy and the Massieu function follows
S(β, G) − Φ(β, G) = βU(β, G),

(7)

170

where U(β, G) is the counterpart of internal energy in statistical physics. In the following, we

171

use the above quantities to compare the interactomes corresponding to different virus-host interac-

172

tomes. In fact, as the number of viral nodes is much smaller than the number of human proteins,

173

we model each virus-human interdependent system G 0 as a perturbation of the large human PPI

174

network G (See Fig. 6).

175

After considering the viral perturbations, the von Neumann entropy, Massieu function and

176

the energy of the human PPI network change slightly. The magnitude of such perturbations can be

177

calculated as explained in Fig. 6, for von Neumann entropy and Massieu function, while the per-

178

turbation in internal energy follows their difference βδU(β, G) = δS(β, G) − δΦ(β, G), according

179

to Eq. 7. The parameter β encodes the propagation time in diffusion dynamics, or equivalently

180

an inverse temperature from a thermodynamic perspective, and is used as a resolution parameter

181

tuned to characterize macroscopic perturbations due to node-node interactions at different scales,

182

from short to long range 40 .

183

Based on the perturbation values and using k-means algorithm, a widely adopted clustering

184

technique, we group the viruses together (see Fig. 6, Tab. 1 and Tab. 2). At small scales, SARS-

Discussion

189

Comparing COVID–19 against other viral infections is still a challenge. In fact, various approaches

190

can be adopted to characterize and categorize the complex nature of viruses and their impact on

191

human cells.

192

In this study, we used an approach based on statistical physics to analyze virus-human

193

protein-protein interactions outlining 45 different viral infections. Our findings suggest that viral

194

components have negligible effect on the structural properties of the human PPI network, therefore

195

classical topological analysis is not able to unravel distinctive patterns. Alternatively, we analyzed

196

the propagation of perturbations from viral components into the human PPI network, allowing us

197

to compare viruses in terms of their average impact on human proteins and their corresponding bio-

198

chemical spreading patterns. While this analysis provides microscopic details about the complex

199

interactions between viral and human proteins, it is not sufficient to identify distinctive patterns

200

relating SARS-CoV-2 and existing viruses. Finally, from the analysis of macroscopic features in

201

terms of information-theoretic and thermodynamic-like quantities, such as the von Neumann en-

202

tropy, the Massieu function and internal energy, we have been able to cluster the viruses across

203

multiple scales, determined by the resolution parameter β. According to our results, SARS-CoV-2

204

shows similarity with SARS-CoV, influenza A and a number of other viruses causing respiratory

205

infections, as one could plausibly expect. At larger scales, where the interplay between the topol-

206

ogy of virus-host interaction and information flow dynamics becomes more relevant, SARS-CoV-2

207

appears to be more similar to viruses like HIV1 and HTLV1. As mentioned earlier, the response

208

of COVID–19 patients has been shown to be positive to drugs used for treating HIV infections,

209

like lopinavir-ritonavir 2–5 . Our findings, in parallel with such a clinical evidence, suggests a rather

210

unexplored relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV1, motivating further theoretical and ex-

211

perimental investigations.

212

Overall, our framework opens the doors for further analyses of viral agents from the perspec-

213

tive of statistical physics, highlighting the sensitivity of macroscopic functions, such as spectral

214

entropy, to small variations across interaction networks and, more specifically, virus-host interac-

215

tomes. Even though the analysis of perturbation propagation patterns lacks the same sensitivity,

216

according to our results it provides microscopic details about the interactions between viral and

217

human proteins that complement the macroscopic view, together enhancing our understanding of

218

this novel coronavirus from a new perspective which can provide a mathematical ground for the

219

exploration of further clinical treatments and biological understanding.

220

Methods

221

Overview of the data set. The human interactome used in this study combines protein-protein

222

interactions (PPI) from two of the largest repository publicly available to date, namely STRING

223

v11.0

224

BIOGRID v3.5.182 42, 43 — publicly available at https://downloads.thebiogrid.org/

225

BioGRID/Release-Archive/BIOGRID-3.5.182/). For a consistent analysis, all pro-

226

tein names and aliases have been standardized to follow the common nomenclature of official

227

symbols of NCBI gene database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/GENE_

228

INFO/Mammalia/ (Accessed: 28/03/2020)

229

hensive network, in standardized format, as BIOSTR.

41

— publicly available at https://string-db.org/cgi/download.pl — and

44

). In the following we will refer to this compre-

230

The virus-host interactions for 45 viruses are collected from the STRING database — pub-

231

licly available at http://viruses.string-db.org/. We consider interactions of any type

232

as long as their confidence (score) is equal or larger than 0.25. For Influenza C, Yellow fever, Hu-

233

man Hepatitis A, Dengue virus type 4 and Swinepox virus, due to the unavailability of data with

234

score 0.25, we consider the minimum available value 0.4, instead. For each virus, we record

235

the targeted human proteins and build a virus-host interactome by merging this information with

236

BIOSTR. However, for the subsequent analyses, which are focused only on the human interactome,

237

we discard virus-virus interactions.

238

It is worth noting that to build the COVID–19 virus-host interactions, a different procedure

239

had to be used. In fact, since the SARS-CoV-2 is too novel we could not find its PPI in the STRING

240

repository and we have considered, instead, the targets experimentally observed in Gordon et al 13 ,

241

consisting of 332 human proteins. The remainder of the procedure used to build the virus-host PPI

242

is the same as before. See Fig. 1 for summary information about each virus.

243

Figure 2 shows a visualization of the human interactome where proteins targeted by viruses

244

are highlighted. Remarkably, viruses tend to preferentially target similar regions related to specific

245

functions of the human interactome. In fact, based on our dataset, TP53 (Tumor Protein p53, NCBI

246

Gene ID: 7157) is the most targeted node: it is responsible for inducing changes in metabolism,

247

DNA repair, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and its mutations are associated with several human

248

cancers. Other relevant targets (See Fig. 2) include GK (Glycerol Kinase, NCBI Gene ID: 2710),

249

an important enzyme contributing to regulate metabolism and glycerol uptake, and its mutations

250

are associated with glycerol kinase deficiency; TBP (TATA-box Binding Protein, NCBI Gene ID:

251

6908), which composes the transcription factor IID, which coordinates the activities of more than

252

70 polypeptides to initiate the transcription by RNA polymerase II; TLR4 (Toll Like Receptor 4,

253

NCBI Gene ID: 7099), relevant for recognizing pathogens and activating innate immunity; STAT2

254

(Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 2, NCBI Gene ID: 6773), acting as a tran-

255

scription activator within the cell nucleus: it is likely that it contributes to block interferon-alpha

256

response by adenovirus; PTGS2 (Prostaglandin-endoperoxide Synthase 2, NCBI Gene ID: 5743),

257

a key enzyme involved in the process of prostaglandin biosynthesis; IFIH1 (Interferon Induced

258

with Helicase C domain 1, NCBI Gene ID: 64135), encoding MDA5, an intracellular sensor of
