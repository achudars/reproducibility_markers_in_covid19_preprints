Abstract
Objective: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in
Wuhan, China in December 2019 and is now pandemic all over the world.
Previous study has reported several COVID-19 cases with conjunctivitis.
However, the complete profiling of COVID-19 related ocular symptoms and
diseases are still missing. We aim to investigate the ocular manifestations and
clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients.
Methods: A total of five hundred and thirty-four patients were recruited at
Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital. We collected information on
demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, systemic
concomitant symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, radiologic
findings, and SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR
from questionnaires and electronic medical records.
Results: The median age of patients was 40 and 50 years at Mobile Cabin
Hospital and Tongji Hospital, respectively. Of 534 COVID-19 patients, 25
patients (4.68%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 3 patients had
conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. The average duration of
conjunctival congestion was 4.9 ± 2.6 days (mean [SD]), ranging from 2 to 10
days. Dry eye (112, 20.97%), blurred vision (68, 12.73%), and foreign body
sensation (63, 11.80%) ranked as the top three COVID-19 related ocular
symptoms. Notably, a total of 332 COVID-19 patients (62%) had a hand-eye
contact history. We also found that some COVID-19 patients had a history of
eye disease, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.18%), dry eye (24, 4.49%), keratitis
(14, 2.62%), cataract (9, 1.69%), and diabetic retinopathy (5, 0.94%). In
consistent with previous studies, the most common clinical symptoms were
fever, cough, and fatigue. Patients, 60.5% in Mobile Cabin Hospital and 67.5%
in Tongji Hospital, respectively were confirmed with positive SARS-CoV-2
detection.

Conclusions: Conjunctival congestion was one of the COVID-19 related
ocular symptoms, which may have clinical diagnostic significance. It is
essential to provide eye-care equipment and strengthen education on eye
protection, as dirty hand-eye contact might be a high risk factor of COVID-19.
Further detailed and comprehensive ophthalmological guidance is needed for
COVID-19 control.

Introduction
The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has
been declared by WHO as a global public health emergency. COVID-19 was
first reported in Wuhan, China, in December, 2019, followed by an outbreak
across Hubei Province, other parts of China, and now all over the world,
particularly in South Korea, Iran, Italy, and Japan. A study in the New England
Journal of Medicine by Zhong Nanshan and colleagues1 reported nine cases
with conjunctival congestion among the 1,099 cases enrolled. However, other
ocular manifestations of COVID-19 are unknown, such as increased
conjunctival secretion, epiphora, and diminution of vision. Several infected
cases2, 3 presented firstly with conjunctivitis before the onset of pneumonia,
implying that the ocular route might be the potential transmission route of
SARS-CoV-2 virus under certain conditions. A recent study revealed that
SARS-CoV-2 also uses the cell entry receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme
2 (ACE2),4, 5 similar to SARS-CoV. Moreover, the expression and activity of
ACE2 can be detected in the ocular surface, including the cornea and
conjunctiva,6 which provides transocular entry potential for SARS-CoV-2.
Several urgent questions need to be addressed, including 1) What are the
detailed profiles of COVID-19–related ocular symptoms and diseases? 2) Do
COVID-19 patients with ocular symptoms progress differently from patients
without ocular symptoms? and 3) Can COVID-19 spread through the ocular
route or present as the primary infected site? To answer these questions, it is
essential to perform ocular screening among patients with COVID-19. To our
knowledge, comprehensive ophthalmological data on COVID-19 is still
missing.
Hence, the present cross-sectional study was designed to describe the
ophthalmic characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, aiming to get a
complete ocular screening of COVID-19, which may provide clinical clues for
the diagnosis and treatment of the disease and a theoretical basis for

appropriate protection guidelines in the population.

Methods
Patients
Five hundred and thirty-four patients diagnosed with novel coronavirus
pneumonia (COVID-19) were recruited from February 1 to March 1, 2020, at
Mobile Cabin Hospital of Optical Valley and Tongji Hospital of Huazhong
University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. The ethics committee
of Tongji Hospital and the China Ethics Committee for Registering Clinical
Trials (ChiCTR2000030489) approved the study. Written informed consent
was obtained from the patients involved. An electronic questionnaire were
designed to collect demographic, clinical, and ophthalmic data from patients. If
data were missing from the questionnaire or clarification was needed, we
communicated directly with the patient by telephone after obtaining informed
consent. Diagnosis and classifications of COVID-19 were made according to
the novel coronavirus infection pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guideline,
7th edition, published by the National Health Commission of China.7
Data collection
For the inpatients at Tongji Hospital, demographic, epidemiological, clinical,
laboratory, radiologic, and outcome data were obtained from patients’
electronic medical records. Data about ocular signs and symptoms and the
use of eye drops were obtained by ophthalmologists via telephone. For the
patients at Mobile Cabin Hospital of Optical Valley, all the data mentioned
above were collected via face-to-face survey and an electronic questionnaire
completed by patients on a smartphone. Two researchers independently
reviewed the data collection forms to double-check the data collected. For
uncertain epidemiological and symptom data, the researchers directly

Continuous variables were expressed as medians and ranges. Categorical
variables were summarized as counts and percentages. No imputation was
made for missing data. The statistics were descriptive only because the
enrolled patients in our study were not derived by random selection. All the
analyses were performed using Empower (R) (www.empowerstats.com,
X&Ysolutions, Inc. Boston MA) and R (http://www. R-project.org).

Results
Demographics and baseline characteristics of COVID-19 patients in
Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital Hospital
A total of 263 COVID-19 patients in Mobile Cabin Hospital and 271
COVID-19 patients in Tongji Hospital were enrolled in the study. The
demographic data, exposure history, and past medical history are summarized
in Table 1.
The median age of patients in Mobile Cabin Hospital was 40 years,
ranging from 16– 68 years. The majority (167, 63.5%) were aged 15–44 years,
and 94 (35.7%) were aged 45–64 years. The inpatients in Tongji Hospital were
older, with a median age of 50 years (19–65 years); more than half (55.4%)
were aged 45–64 years. There was a similar number of men and women
(134/129 and 134/137, respectively) in the two hospitals. Half (49.4%) of the
patients in Mobile Cabin Hospital were employed, and eight (3.0%) infected
cases were medical staff; 25 (10.7%) patients in Tongji Hospital were

agricultural workers, and eight (3.4%) inpatients were medical staff. Among all
the subjects in Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital, most had a contact
history with a person with a fever (40% and 19.9%, respectively) or with a
confirmed COVID-19 case in the family or community (41.8% and 34.3%,
respectively). Since Mobile Cabin Hospital was established for patients with
mild symptoms and the ability to provide self-care, less than half of these
patients had underlying diseases, including hypertension (9.1%), respiratory
system disease (6.8%), chronic liver disease (5.3%), and diabetes mellitus
(3.4%). More severe COVID-19 patients were admitted to Tongji Hospital.
Thus, nearly half (49.8%) of the inpatients at Tongji Hospital had chronic
medical illness, including hypertension (17.0%), diabetes mellitus (10.7%), and
respiratory system (7.0%), cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases
(5.9%).
Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Mobile Cabin Hospital
and Tongji Hospital
The clinical characteristics, including the common symptoms of COVID-19,
the radiologic findings of chest CT, and the PCR results of SARS-CoV-2
detection in nasopharyngeal swabs are summarized in Table 2.
The clinical symptoms of the patients in the two hospitals were similar, but
the percentages of involvement were various. The most common symptoms
were fever (40.7% and 81.2% in Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital,
respectively), cough (48.7% and 81.2%, respectively), and fatigue (28.5% and
49.8%, respectively). Of the patients in Tongji Hospital, 59.8% had a
temperature over 38.1° C, and 43.2% of them had diarrhea. Only 6.5% of the
subjects in Mobile Cabin Hospital suffered from dyspnoea, while 38.0% of the
inpatients in Tongji Hospital developed dyspnoea while hospitalized. With
regard to radiologic findings of the lung, most patients had bilateral
involvement (58.6% and 90.6% in Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital,
respectively). No radiologic feature of pneumonia was found in 21 (9.5%)

patients in Mobile Cabin Hospital. All patients underwent SARS-CoV-2
detection via nasopharyngeal swabs several times. Respectively, 60.5% and
67.5% of patients were confirmed with positive SARS-CoV-2 detection.
Ocular characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Mobile Cabin Hospital and
Tongji Hospital
The ocular characteristics, including ocular symptoms, recent use of eye
drop medication, eye protections, and previous eye diseases are summarized
and presented in Table 2.
In Mobile Cabin Hospital, many patients suffered from ocular discomforts
including conjunctival congestion (3.8%), increased conjunctival secretion
(10.6%), ophthalmalgia (5.7%), foreign body sensation (19.0%), and tearing
(13.3%). Eighty-two (31.2%) patients complained about dry eye. To relieve
ocular symptoms, local treatments of ofloxacin (3.8%), tobramycin (1.1%),
ganciclovir (0.4%), and artificial tears (2.7%) were given to the patients. A total
of 36.5% patients in Mobile Cabin Hospital wore glasses or goggles. Most of
them spent a lot of time on short-distance reading, especially on smartphones.
A total of 33.5% patients spent 4–8 hours per day, and 33.8% of patients spent
8–12 hours per day reading. A few people had a history of eye diseases,
including conjunctivitis (7.6%), keratitis (4.2%), and xerophthalmia (8.0%).
Among 271 patients in Tongji Hospital, 15 (5.5%) had conjunctival
congestion during hospitalization. In addition, a total of 8.9% had increased
conjunctival secretion, 2.6% had ophthalmalgia, and 4.8% had foreign body
sensation. According to the evaluation by ophthalmologists, 11 (4.1%) and one
(0.4%) inpatients received eye drops of ofloxacin and tobramycin, respectively.
Local treatment of ganciclovir was given to three (1.1%) patients. Similar to
patients in Mobile Cabin Hospital, 56 (20.3%) inpatients wore glasses or
goggles. More than half (50.6%) of patients never touched their eyes with their
hands. A total of 35.4% inpatients spent less than two hours per day on
short-distance reading. A minority of inpatients had previous eye diseases,

including conjunctivitis (4.8%), keratitis (1.1%), xerophthalmia (1.1%), cataract
(2.6%), macular disease (0.4%), diabetic retinopathy (1.5%), and other retinal
disease (0.7%).
Ocular profiles and clinical characteristics of patients with conjunctival
congestion
Figure 1 summarizes the ocular symptoms, eye drop medications, eye
protections, history of eye disease, and clinical characteristics of all twenty-five
patients with conjunctival congestion
Seven patients had conjunctival congestion and increased conjunctival
secretion (cases 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14 and 19). Five patients had tearing (cases 2,
4, 6, 11 and 16). Four patients also had ophthalmalgia (cases 1, 7, 10 and 21),
and four patients had foreign body sensation in the eyes (cases 4, 7, 17 and
21). Eighteen patients had touched their eyes with their hands, and twelve
(cases 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 18, 22, 23 and 24) of them did not wash their
hands before touching their eyes. Most of these patients had bilateral lung
involvement indicated by chest CT (68%) and positive PCR results in
SARS-CoV-2 detection (64%).
The duration of conjunctival congestion, onset date of clinical symptoms,
and SARS-CoV-2 detection in patients with conjunctival congestion are
summarized in Figure 2. The duration of conjunctival congestion ranged from
two days to 12 days. Conjunctival congestion appeared mostly (72%) after the
first clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Four patients (cases 11, 20, 23 and 24)
had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs at the same
time as the conjunctival congestion appeared. Three patients (cases 17, 21
and 25) had conjunctival congestion as an initial symptom.

Discussion
To date, the epidemiologic data on the incidence of conjunctivitis in
COVID-19 patients ranges from 0.82% to 4.76%.1, 3, 9, 10 However, the precise

incidence of ocular manifestations relative to COVID-19 is unclear. In our
present study, we found that 1) of a total of 534 COVID-19 patients identified,
25 patients (4.68%) presented with conjunctival congestion; 2) the incidence of
dry eye (112, 20.97%), blurred vision (68, 12.73%), and foreign body sensation
(63, 11.80%) ranked in the top three ocular symptoms; and 3) simultaneously,
we also found that some COVID-19 patients had a history of eye diseases,
among which the top five were conjunctivitis (33, 6.18%), dry eye (24, 4.49%),
keratitis (14, 2.62%), cataract (9, 1.69%), and diabetic retinopathy (5, 0.94%).
Recent research has reported three cases of conjunctival congestion in 63
COVID-19 patients or suspected cases.9 Nine patients had conjunctival
congestion among the 1,099 cases in Zhong and colleagues’ study.1
Consistent with their results, our previous single-center cross-sectional study
showed that only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis were identified from
72

patients

with

COVID-19.10

However,

these

epidemiological investigations did not observe other ocular manifestations
besides conjunctival congestion. Therefore, the present epidemiologic study
summarized the manifestations present on the ocular surface. We enrolled
534 patients and found that COVID-19 patients exhibit ocular manifestations
including conjunctival congestion (25), secretion (52), foreign body sensation
(63), blurred vision (63), dry eye (112), itching (53), photophobia (15), and
tearing (55). The incidence of conjunctival congestion in our study is 4.68%,
which is higher than that in Zhong’s large sample report (9/1,099, 0.82%) and
Xia’s study (1/30, 3.33%). Zhong and colleagues1 extracted data from 552
hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China,
while 21 common-type and nine severe-type COVID-19 patients were
observed by Xia3 in Zhejiang province. However, the COVID-19 patients in our
study mainly came from Tongji hospital (271) and Mobile Cabin Hospital (263)
in Wuhan (the center of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak), which may be the cause
of the higher incidence of conjunctival congestion in the present study.

Given that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was not detected in patients’
conjunctival swab sample, we did not diagnosis them with conjunctivitis
directly. However, only four patients reported a history of eye disease among
the 25 cases—two reported conjunctivitis and two reported dry eye. These 25
patients did not report any other eye disease history nor any symptoms
associated with intraocular diseases (such as iritis, choroiditis, and retinal
disease), which suggests that the possibility of endophthalmitis is very small,
and conjunctivitis may be the primary cause of the conjunctival congestion.
Moreover, conjunctival congestion and positive RT-PCR in pharyngeal swabs
were found at the same time in four COVID-19 patients (cases 11, 20, 23, 24)
who reported no eye disease history. Therefore, we suggest that the
conjunctival swab test for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in patients with
conjunctival congestion. Our study also found that the average duration of
conjunctival congestion was 4.9 ± 2.6 days (mean [SD]), ranging from 2 to 10
days. Two patients diagnosed with COVID patients had an initial symptom of
conjunctival congestion, which reminds us that ocular manifestations occur
early in the course of COVID-19. Therefore, healthcare workers should pay
attention to patients’ ocular symptoms and manifestations in the early stage of
disease and should perform a conjunctival swab test for SARS-CoV-2 in
patients with conjunctival congestion.
SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be transmitted from person to person mainly
through respiratory droplets or close contact.11 The ocular surface is exposed
to the outside environment, which may become a potential gateway for
pathogens such as viruses to invade the human body.12, 13 Thus, hand-eye
contact should be avoided as much as possible. We found that a total of 332
COVID-19 patients had a history of hand-eye contact, including 286 cases who
reported seldom hand-eye contact and 46 who reported frequent hand-eye
contact. Among the 25 cases with conjunctival congestion, 18 (72%) had a
history of hand-eye contact, 13 with frequent contact and 12 who never

washed their hands, suggesting that hand-eye contact is possibly a high risk
factor. Correlation analysis is warranted in future large-scale studies.
The present study also found that the incidence of dry eye, foreign body
sensation, and blurred vision were the top three ocular symptoms in patients
(20.9%, 11.8%, and 13.9%), which could be due to the fact that COVID-19
patients are more likely to have a lot of time to use electronic products. Our
results showed that 321 of 534 COVID-19 patients (60.11%) spent more than
four hours per day on short-distance reading. Time spent reading exceeded 12
hours per day in 43 patients (35 in Mobile Cabin Hospital and 8 in Tongji
Hospital). Because of this, healthcare workers (particularly in Mobile Cabin
Hospital) should propose that patients engage in some moderate physical
exercise.
A portion of COVID-19 patients had a history of eye disease, among which
the top five were conjunctivitis (6.18%), dry eye (4.49%), keratitis (2.62%),
cataract (1.69%), and diabetic retinopathy (0.94%). As a result of the
SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, it is difficult to provide rapid and effective treatment for
concomitant eye disease in these COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we should
attempt to take common eye disorders into consideration and pay more
attention to these special patients to delay the progress of common eye
diseases.
Consistent

studies,

SARS-CoV-2–infected

patients

developed respiratory disorders with initial symptoms of fever, cough, chest
stuffiness, and fatigue, which quickly progress to pneumonia and even
shortness of breath.8,14-16 However, extra-pulmonary manifestations were also
observed in a number of patients at the onset of the illness, including
headache, myalgia or arthralgia, and diarrhea,16 and some even presented
with asymptomatic infection.17 We also found that most of the enrolled
COVID-19 patients had bilateral lung accumulation (371/524), and the
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test was positive at least once in 342 patients. However,

the relationship between the ocular manifestations and the extra-ocular
manifestations needs to be further studied.
The present study has some limitations. First, the sample size was small
and the covered population consisted mainly of patients with mild disease; this
is because only patients with mild symptoms and cured patients could
complete our questionnaire survey. Second, this is a descriptive study, and no
correlation analysis was performed; however, we present the ocular
manifestations that we observed during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in detail. To
date, this is the most comprehensive survey with the largest sample related to
the eyes. Third, no normal population was observed in our study, therefore, a
normal control group should be included for comparison in future studies.
In conclusion, although ophthalmology is not the main battlefield among all
kinds of major infectious diseases, the significance of understanding the ocular
manifestations of our present study lies in 1) helping to deepen the
understanding of COVID-19–associated eye diseases; identify ocular
symptoms, manifestations, and clinical outcomes; and enrich the symptom
spectrum of COVID-19; 2) observing the incidence of eye diseases during
COVID-19 treatment in hospital; and 3) providing a clue that patients with eye
diseases are not being effectively treated during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our
findings may provide useful information for the diagnosis and treatment of
COVID-19 and indicate the need for effective eye protection for COVID-19
patients. Simultaneously, it also provides useful clues for the treatment of eye
diseases in COVID-19 patients.
