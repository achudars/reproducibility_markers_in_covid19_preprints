Abstract
AIM
To investigate the associations of meteorological factors and the daily new cases of coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) in nine Asian cities.
METHOD
Pearson’s correlation and generalized additive modeling were performed to assess the relationships
between daily new COVID-19 cases and meteorological factors (daily average temperature and relative
humidity) with the most updated data currently available.
RESULTS
The Pearson correlation showed that daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 were more correlated with
the average temperature than with relative humidity. Daily new confirmed cases were negatively correlated
with the average temperature in Beijing (r=-0.565, P<0.01), Shanghai (r=-0.471, P<0.01), and Guangzhou
(r=-0.530, P<0.01) , yet in contrast, positively correlated with that in Japan (r=0.441, P<0.01). In most of
the cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, and Kuala Lumpur), generalized additive
modeling analysis showed the number of daily new confirmed cases was positively associated with both
average temperature and relative humidity, especially in lagged 3d model, where a positive influence of
temperature on the daily new confirmed cases was discerned in 5 cities except in Beijing, Wuhan, Korea,
and Malaysia. Nevertheless, the results were inconsistent across cities and lagged time, suggesting
meteorological factors were unlikely to greatly influence the COVID-19 epidemic.
CONCLUSION
The associations between meteorological factors and the number of COVID-19 daily cases are inconsistent
across cities and lagged time. Large-scale public health measures and expanded regional research are still
required until a vaccine becomes available and herd immunity is established.
Keywords: COVID-19, coronavirus, meteorological factors, temperature, humidity.

Significance statement:
With increasing COVID-19 cases across China and the world, and previous studies showing that
meteorological factors may be associated with infectious disease transmission, the saying has it that when
summer comes, the epidemic of COVID-19 may simultaneously fade away. We demonstrated the
influence of meteorological factors on the daily domestic new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in
nine Asian cities. And we found that the associations between meteorological factors and the number of
COVID-19 daily cases are inconsistent across cities and time. We think this important topic may give
better clues on prevention, management, and preparation for new events or new changes that could happen
in the COVID-19 epidemiology in various geographical regions and as we move towards Summer.

Introduction
In December 2019, several cases of pneumonia with an unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei
province, China (1). A novel strain of coronavirus was identified from the nasopharyngeal swab specimens
of the infected, which was later designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), and the resulting pneumonia as coronavirus disease (COVID-19). With the number of the infected
soaring up, on 31st January, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of
COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) (2).
SARS-CoV-2, pertaining to the Coronaviridae, is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA
virus, which is closely related to SARS-like coronaviruses, and based on the phylogenetic analysis, these
coronaviruses have a common ancestor that resembles the bat coronavirus HKU9-1 (3, 4). Evidence has
shown that the SARS-CoV-2 can transmit between human through respiratory droplets, fecal-oral route,
direct contacts, and aerosols(5-7). Moreover, the long incubation period (1 to 14 days) increases the
difficulty of controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. Studies have shown the mean incubation period was 5.1
days (ranged from 2.2 to 11.5 days, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.5–5.8) (8), and another study
estimated the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (ranged from 2 to 14 days)(9). By March 28, 2020,
more than 199 countries had confirmed cases, with more than 571,678 confirmed cases and 26,494
mortalities globally, among which 489,337 (85.6%) confirmed cases and 23,188 (87.5%) mortalities were
reported outside of China (10).
Human respiratory pathogens (bacterial pathogens like pneumococcus and viruses like rubella and
influenza) usually exhibit an annual pattern showing an increase in incidence during winter, and decrease
during the summer (seasonality). Despite much data on influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and the
SARS 2003 outbreak following the pattern, it is difficult to predict whether COVID-19 would follow the
trend and will be eliminated in the coming summer, as our understanding of the forces driving the
seasonality of infectious diseases remains limited. Since influenza is a common viral disease, a proportion
of the population already possesses some levels of immunity and when more patients recover, herd
immunity constrain the transmission of the virus. The low or absent prevalence trend of SARS or MERSCoV in the summer was also mentioned to be strongly relied on the use of effective therapeutic treatment
and strict public health measures(11, 12). However, SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus to humans, immunity to
this ongoing virus pandemic is limited and an effective pharmaceutical therapy or vaccine prevention is yet
to be found.
The seasonality in the outbreak of respiratory infectious diseases might be due to the seasonal variation of
host physiology (susceptibility, individual immunity and herd immunity)(13), genetics(14), viral
stability(15, 16) and infectivity(17-20), latent infectors constantly shedding viruses(21, 22), and the
atmospheric dispersion and trans-ocean inter-continental migration (23-26), which are mainly driven by
the meteorological factors, including the temperature and humidity (27). Geological features and latitude
play a major role in forming a meteorological pattern. Lowen et al. assumed the seasonality of influenza
and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) epidemics in temperate climates mainly attributable to the low
absolute humidity (19), and the following factors associated with it, namely the low temperature, increased
population, and low micronutrient levels (such as low vitamin D levels) (28, 29). During the winter in
temperate zones, the temperature and humidity are low, characterized by dryness and coldness, and viruses
are more easily to be transmitted via aerosols than direct or indirect contact, where the low temperature

renders the virus viable and stable in aerosols, and on the surface. However, in the rainy seasons of tropical
regions, where the weather is hot and wet, the aerosol transmission decreases but the transmission by direct
contact increases(30); although the high temperature can decrease the stability of the virus and reduce the
level of aerosolization of the viral droplet, with the increased temperature, the amount of virus deposited
on surfaces increases(31).
Because of the relatively stable structure of the coronaviruses, the infectivity of the coronavirus would not
be affected upon circumstances of a relative humidity >95% and a temperature of 28 - 33˚C (31). For
example, the transmission of SARS is more efficient in the temperature between 16 ˚C and 28˚C, the
widely use of air-conditioning also provides a shelter for the breeding and transmitting of SARS, where the
virus is stable for 3 weeks at room temperature (31). SARS-CoV-2 has many similarities with the SARSCoV-1, but whether meteorological factors influenced the viral transmission have not been established.
Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to examine the relationship between meteorological factors and
the number of COVID-19 daily cases in Asian cities at different latitudes.
Method
Meteorological data
We obtained daily meteorological data from the National Meteorological Information Center
(http://cdc.cma.gov.cn/). The data were collected from meteorological stations in Beijing, Wuhan,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Where data from the
national meteorological stations were not available, we obtained data from the Timeanddate
(https://www.timeanddate.com/). We retrieved the highest and lowest temperatures and humidity in four
different quarters of the day and computed the average values of temperature and humidity for that day.
Surveillance data of COVID-19
The daily number of domestic COVID-19 cases in five cities in China (namely Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, and Hong Kong) and Singapore were obtained from the Ministry of Health in China and
Singapore, respectively. Given that the daily number of domestic cases at the city level in Japan, Korea
and Malaysia were not available from the corresponding Ministry of Health, as an alternative, we used the
number of domestic cases at the national level in these three countries for analysis. The clinical criterion
for the diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the high-throughput sequencing or RT-PCR assay by
nasopharyngeal swab.
Statistical analysis
We evaluated the normality of the daily new cases and meteorological data by examining their skewness
and kurtosis. We also estimated the Pearson correlation and covariances between the daily COVID-19
new cases and daily meteorological factors using STATA 14.0.
Generalized additive models (GAMs) with a Poisson family and logarithm link function were used to
estimate the associations of daily COVID-19 new cases with average temperature and relative humidity.
GAMs are useful for identifying exposure-response relationships from various types of data, particularly in
exploring nonparametric relationships (32). The GAM analysis was performed in R software (version
3.6.0) using the package “mgcv”. We first established a basic temporal model for COVID-19 cases without
including meteorological variables. To adjust for long-term trends and seasonality, we included penalized
spline functions of time in the model. The degree of freedom (df) for time was optimized by minimizing of

the absolute values of the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) of residuals for lags up to 30 days (3336). Additionally, the selection of an optimal model was based on the lowest Akaike’s Information
Criterion (AIC). Secondly, we built meteorological models based on the temporal models to account for
the lagged effect of meteorological variables and the incubation period of COVID-19 (7, 37). Specifically,
we examined the effect of meteorological variables with different time lags including one-day lag (Lag
1d), three-day lag (Lag 3d), five-day lag (Lag 5d), single-week lag (Lag 7d), and two-week lag (Lag 14) to
capture immediate effects and lagged effects, respectively. Automated penalized splines were used to fit
the association between the daily new cases and each of the meteorological variables. The date when the
accumulated cases exceeded 30 in each city or country was selected as the inception of the date
incorporated in the model to equalize the starting speed of outbreak and thus avoid miss-interpretation and
overfitting.
To control for the autocorrelation, the model’s residuals were examined for serial correlation using PACF.
Default plots showing the smooth components of a fitted GAM were produced. The percentage of
deviance explained by each variable was calculated, which represents the scale of a linear predictor that
contributes to the component smooth functions. At last, the graph of smooth components were grouped
based on similar latitudes to mitigate the influence by latitude.

Results
Descriptive statistical results
The daily new cases of COVID-19 and meteorological data from January 20 to March 18, 2020 (61 days)
in nine different cities are shown in Table 1. During the study period, the temperature in the five cities in
China ranged from -9 to 26.25℃, with that ranging from -9 to 26℃ in Beijing, from 0 to 22℃ in
Shanghai, from 8.75 to 26.25 ℃ in Guangzhou, from 1 to 21.75℃ in Wuhan, and from 11.25 to 26.25℃
in Hong Kong. The temperature in Singapore ranged from 25.5 to 32.75℃, in Seoul from -9.5 to 12.25℃,
in Tokyo from 0.75 to 18.5℃, and in Kuala Lumpur from 24.5 to 33.5℃. Figures 1 and 2 show the
distribution of daily COVID-19 new cases associated with average temperature and average relative
humidity over time, respectively.
Pearson’s correlations between daily COVID-19 cases and meteorological factors are shown in Table 2.
Daily confirmed new cases were negatively correlated with average temperature in Beijing (r = -0.565, P <
0.01), Shanghai (r = -0.471, P < 0.01), and Guangzhou (r = -0.530, P < 0.01), and, in contrast, positively
correlated with that in Japan (r = 0.441, P < 0.01). The correlation between average temperature and
relative humidity was found positive in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Korea, and Japan, and
negative in Beijing, Wuhan, Singapore, and Malaysia according to the pairwise Pearson correlation test
(Table 2).
GAM analysis of daily COVID-19 new cases with meteorological factors
The final GAM model of daily COVID-19 new cases incorporated date (time-series), average temperature,
and mean relative humidity.

where the terms f1 to f2 are the smoothing functions, and β0 is the intercept. All estimates and significance
levels were listed in Supplementary Table 1. The models with the best performance (lowest AIC) for each
city is as follows: No-lag model for Shanghai and Singapore, Lag 1d model for Beijing and Wuhan, Lag
5d model for Guangzhou, Korea, and Kuala Lumpur, and Lag 14d model for Hong Kong and Japan (Table
3).
GAM results were reported using the smoothing components plot for temperature and relative humidity in
Figures 3 and 4, respectively. The smoothing components plots demonstrated the estimated smoothing
spline functions with the linear effect subtracted out, and each panel represented the weighted sum of basis
functions for each time-varying covariate and is corresponding to the hypothesized model.
The significant smoothers indicated that the correlations between new cases of COVID-19 and explanatory
variables were non-linear. As shown in Figure 3, the no-lag model suggested that holding all linear and the
other nonlinear terms fixed, daily new cases of COVID-19 tended to show no influence by the
temperature, but the cases number decreased when temperature reached 5, 18, and 29, in Beijing, Hong
Kong, and Singapore, respectively (P < 0.01 for all, Figure 3). While the magnitude of results might look
small relative to the base rate of case accrual, these plots were on the log-case scale, so the effect on the
case number is multiplicative. The distributions of COVID-19 cases displayed greater uncertainty at lower
temperature in Beijing and Wuhan. Beijing and Wuhan has fluctuating patterns throughout the six models

both regarding temperature and relative humidity except in lag 5d and lag 4d model for Wuhan, which
might be due to the change of diagnostic method on February 12, when a total of 13,436 cases were added.
Nevertheless, the relationship between relative humidity and new cases were less evident in the No-lag
model, and the distributions of COVID-19 cases displayed greater uncertainty in Wuhan.
Nevertheless, in the Lag 1d model, distribution of COVID-19 in Beijing, Wuhan, Hong Kong and
Malaysia revealed great uncertainty and high non-linearity. A hump of the increase was observed at around
28℃ in Singapore. After the hump, the cases started to decrease in Singapore when temperature increases.
A liner increase can be found in Guangzhou. Likewise, a significantly non-linear pattern was found in
Wuhan between the relative humidity and COVID-19 cases. Figure 4 shows that during the study period,
relative humidity has a positive effects for Singapore, Hong Kong as well as Malaysia constantly, with a
linear pattern, yet a negative effects were discerned in Seoul when humidity greater than 90% in a nonlinear way.
In Lag 3d model, the temperature has a positive influence on the daily new cases in Shanghai and
Singapore in a linear pattern, and in Guangzhou when the temperature was greater than 20℃, in Hong
Kong when temperature was greater than 15℃, and in Japan when temperature was between 2-4℃ and 1216℃ in a non-linear pattern. Specifically, the distribution of the COVID-19 new cases in Beijing, Wuhan,
and Kuala Lumpur was greatly fluctuating. Regarding the relative humidity, in Lag 3d model, Wuhan,
Guangzhou, and Kuala Lumpur showed significant curvilinearity. A positive association between relative
humidity and new cases can be found in Singapore, while a negative pattern was observed in Hong Kong
when relative humidity greater than 65% (Figure 4).
In the Lag 5d model, COVID-19 new cases in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Singapore when temperature less
than 22℃ were negatively correlated (Figure 3). A positive pattern can be discerned significantly in Tokyo
when temperature was lower than 4℃, and in Hong Kong as well as in Kuala Lumpur. Regarding the
relative humidity, except for Wuhan and Guangzhou that displayed highly fluctuating pattern, no evident
effects could be discerned.
In the Lag 7d and Lag 14d models, Beijing, Wuhan, and Kuala Lumpur (only in Lag 14d model) showed
great uncertainty of the relationship between temperature and daily new cases. Moreover, Shanghai and
Singapore have different and inverse effects between Lag 7d and 14d models, where, in the Lag 7d model,
Shanghai showed a negative pattern and Singapore showed a positive pattern while in the Lag 14d model,
Shanghai showed a positive pattern and Singapore showed a negative pattern. Concerning the relative
humidity, likewise, Beijing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou (only in Lag 14d model) displayed great uncertainty
and curvilinearity (Figure 4). Hong Kong shows a positive pattern in both two model. Nevertheless,
Shanghai and Singapore still showed inverse effects in the Lag 7d and 14d models, where in the Lag 7d
model, both Shanghai and Singapore showed positive patterns while in the Lag 14d model, Shanghai and
Singapore showed negative patterns.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated the associations between meteorological factors and patterns of daily new
cases of COVID-19 across nine Asian cities. Our analyses suggest a positive relationship between
temperature and daily new cases of COVID-19 in Guangzhou, Singapore (except in the lagged 14d
model), Hong Kong (except in the lagged 7d and 14d model) and Beijing (high curvilinearity). Relative
humidity positively with the number of daily new cases in Singapore (except in the lagged 14d model),
Hong Kong (except in the lagged 3d model). Negative association between relative humidity and the
number of daily new cases was only observed in Shanghai consistently. Associations of temperature and
relative humidity on the daily new cases were less evident in Tokyo, Seoul and Kuala Lumpur. The
relationships in Wuhan presented a great fluctuating pattern. Therefore, our analysis suggest, unlike
influenza, seasonality of COVID-19 may not be expected, and the epidemic is unlikely to fade out itself
when summer comes.
Researchers have long been investigating how meteorological factors affect the viral infectivity, where the
GAM has been frequently used, as it allows smooth components to be estimated for time, meteorological
factors and other covariates, together with a non-smoothed period effect. Experiments in the last century
reported that the influenza virus is more stable in cool and dry air (15, 16). And with increasing
temperature, the viability of the influenza virus in aerosol or droplets(38), and the aerosol transmission
diminishes (27). Lowen et al. reported that aerosol transmission of influenza between Guinea pigs was
completely blocked at temperature higher than 30°C despite evidence of continuous viral shedding from
infectious individuals; nevertheless, the direct contact transmission was not influenced, which was equally
efficient at 30° C and 20° C (19). Chan et al. reported that the viability of SARS virus was rapidly lost (>3
log 10) at high temperatures (38◦C) and high relative humidity (>95%)(31). The better stability of the
SARS coronavirus at low temperatures and low humidity environment might facilitate its transmission in
the community in subtropical areas (such as Hong Kong) during the spring and in air-conditioned
environments. This might also explain why some Asian countries in tropical areas (such as Malaysia,
Indonesia or Thailand) with high temperatures and high relative humidity environment did not have major
community outbreaks of SARS. However, such an explanation is not currently convincing regarding the
results in the present study, where the increase of the temperature increases the daily new cases of COVID19 in some of the investigated communities. The high temperature and high relative humidity in the
tropical Asian countries like Singapore, and Malaysia also seems to have little influence on the expanding
daily new cases (Figure 3). However, this could have been confounded by multiple factors.
There are several reasons underlying the continuously expanding COVID-19 cases in Singapore and
Malaysia, such as the high population density, massive gatherings, the use of air-conditioning and shortage
of medical resources(31). The SARS-CoV-2 can persist at room temperature for up to 9 days, and its heat
sensitivity rendered it susceptible to increased temperature, affecting its persistence in the outdoor
environment. However, coronavirus was still found to be infective up to two weeks in the air-condition
environment(31). As air-conditioners may increase the probability of spreading, it may be advisable to
reduce the use of air-conditioners and keep ventilation. Moreover, during low temperature and high
humidity, it is advisable to avoid massive gathering, as evidences are also supporting transmission by
direct contact or close contact at the tropical area .

Humidity can influence aerosol transmission via altering the proportion of respiratory droplets undergoing
aerosolization, and influencing the stability and viability of the virus within these aerosols. Respiratory
droplets are generated in the high humidity of the respiratory tract. On entering an environment with low
humidity, respiratory droplets reduce in size within seconds due to evaporation. At higher environmental
humidity, respiratory droplets evaporate more slowly, and hence are larger and settle faster, and less
aerosol nuclei are produced (39, 40). Previous studies have shown that influenza transmission between
mice reduced as relative humidity increased from 47% to 70%(13, 41). Moreover, humidity can also
influence indirect transmission by changing the mass of respiratory droplets accumulating on surfaces, and
affecting the survival of the virus on surfaces. While increased humidity reduces the number of droplet
nuclei formed, the same mechanisms (reduced droplet evaporation and faster droplet settling) result in a
greater mass of respiratory droplets on surfaces (39, 40). Area with relatively low temperature and
humidity has a higher infection rate comparing with tropical areas because the cold and dry weather is
suitable for virus to survive and transmit (42). Viability of influenza virus appears greater at lower
humidity, and progressively reduced influenza survival with increasing relative humidity over the range
from 27% to 84%, with an increase in survival at 99% relative humidity, the mechanisms underlying
which may be due to the low evaporation from droplets at high relative humidity maintain the solute
concentration thus protecting the virus(27, 43). Alongside, 30-50o N zone has become a zone for
transmitting COVID-19 with similar average temperature of 5-11 ℃ and 47-79% humidity, which may be
influenced by transoceanic migration of virus, but the underlying mechanism is still not understood (44).
Moreover, under laboratory conditions with constant humidity and temperature, circadian and circannual
rhythms in variation of susceptibility of hosts (mice) have been observed(13, 45). Mice were substantially
more susceptible to invasive pneumococcal disease in early morning hours than any other time of day(45),
and more susceptible to influenza in winter than in summer (13) which was thought to be attributable to
the daily and seasonal variation of melatonin (46). In addition, even in areas where many spend summers
in air-conditioned spaces, marked annual variations in incidence constantly exist, and similar strains of
virus appear almost simultaneously across vast stretches of oceans in areas of similar latitude around the
globe(23, 24).
Therefore, although a higher temperature is associated with lower effectiveness of virus transmission, yet it
does not necessarily suggest a lower chance for virus to survive. The natural fading out of the virus in
summer is unlikely given the widespread use of air conditioners in developed areas and the dense
population in the city area. Until an effective vaccine becomes widely available for the establishment of
herd immunity and the discovery of efficient pharmaceutical therapies, strict public-health measures
should be implemented, including social distancing, quarantine, tracing, facemask wearing, and promotion
of hand washing.
Strength and limitations:
This is the first study to statistically analyze the relationship between meteorological factors and the daily
new cases of COVID-19. Because of the non-linear nature of the data, we also performed GAMs to
quantitate and visualize the relationship using splines functions. However, there are several limitations.
Firstly, numbers of cases in Malaysia, Korea, and Japan were obtained from the epidemiologic reports
released by the Department of Health in the corresponding countries, instead of a daily update of case
numbers, which is not available for these countries. Hence, some cases might be missing. Secondly, the

duration of the study period was short and the number of cases in Malaysia, Singapore and Japan were
small. Thirdly, we only considered two meteorological factors (temperature and humidity) in this study.
Other covariates such as wind speed, pollutant concentration, population density, air conditioning use,
rainfall, which could also influence the spread of COVID-19, were not included. Moreover, while we
collected the meteorological data from the capital cities of Malaysia, Japan, and Korea, the number of
domestic cases at the national level in these three countries was used for analysis due to lack of available
data at their city level. Most importantly, we did not incorporate the public health measures into the
modelling, which may greatly confound the results, but we chose the date when accumulated confirmed
cases exceeding 30, based on the postulation that a certain level of public health measures had been carried
out at that time, thus the confounding effects can be mitigated at some point.
Conclusion:
In this study, we found inconsistent associations between temperature and relative humidity and the
number of COVID-19 daily cases across cities and time. Therefore, unlike influenza, seasonality of
COVID-19 may not be expected, and the epidemic is unlikely to fade out when summer arrives. Strict
public health measures such as social distancing, quarantine, tracing, facemask wearing, and promotion of
hand washing are needed until a vaccine becomes widely available and induce the herd immunity among
the community.
