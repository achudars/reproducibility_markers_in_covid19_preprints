Abstract:

25

We evaluated saliva (SAL) specimens for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing by comparison of 459 prospectively

26

paired nasopharyngeal (NP) or mid-turbinate (MT) swabs from 449 individuals with the aim of using

27

saliva for asymptomatic screening. Samples were collected in a drive-through car line for symptomatic

28

individuals (N=380) and in the emergency department (ED) (N=69). The percent positive and negative

29

agreement of saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swab were 81.1% (95% CI: 65.8% – 90.5%) and 99.8%

30

(95% CI: 98.7% – 100%), respectively. The sensitivity increased to 90.0% (95% CI: 74.4% – 96.5%) when

31

considering only samples with moderate to high viral load (Cycle threshold (Ct) for the NP <=34). Pools

32

of five saliva specimens were also evaluated on three platforms: bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG with

33

ABI 7500Fast (CDC assay), Hologic Panther Fusion, and Roche COBAS 6800. The median loss of signal

34

upon pooling was 2-4 Ct values across the platforms. The sensitivity of detecting a positive specimen in

35

a pool compared with testing individually was 100%, 93%, and 95% for CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-

36

PCR, Panther Fusion® SARS-CoV-2 assay, and cobas® SARS-CoV-2 test respectively, with decreased

37

sample detection trending with lower viral load. We conclude that although pooled saliva testing, as

38

collected in this study, is not quite as sensitive as NP/MT testing, saliva testing is adequate to detect

39

individuals with higher viral loads in an asymptomatic screening program, does not require swabs or

40

viral transport media for collection, and may help to improve voluntary screening compliance for those

41

individuals averse to various forms of nasal collections.

Introduction:

44

A coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) that was first reported in late December 2019 rapidly spread

45

worldwide resulting in a pandemic. There are > 29 million SARS-CoV-2 infections and > 900,000 related

46

deaths worldwide, with >6 million infections and >194,000 deaths in the United States (1). Screening,

47

testing, and contact tracing are essential for patient management and to reduce further spread of

48

disease. Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been challenging throughout the course of the pandemic

49

for numerous reasons such as supply shortages. For symptomatic patients, a highly sensitive, specific,

50

and reliably accurate assay is important, and the choice of specimen type can impact assay performance

51

(2). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently lists the following upper respiratory

52

specimen types as acceptable: nasopharyngeal swab, anterior nares, mid-turbinate, oropharyngeal (OP),

53

and NP/nasal wash/aspirates, with the NP swab often considered the preferred method for diagnostic

54

testing and the collection method to which other specimen types have been compared (3-5). However,

55

there is inconvenience associated with NP and OP swab collection including patient discomfort (3, 6),

56

some risk of exposure to healthcare personnel, the requirement for swabs, and the need for personal

57

protective equipment (PPE). Alternative specimen sources, such as anterior nares, have been listed as an

58

acceptable specimen type since early in the pandemic even though reported sensitivity is only about

59

86% (2). Saliva, however, which can be easily self-collected by patients and is non-invasive has not been

60

studied adequately. The goals for SARS-CoV-2 testing in asymptomatic vs symptomatic individuals

61

differ, with high participation rate and ease of collection being important considerations for screening

62

an asymptomatic population. This is particularly relevant as there is an urgent desire to open schools

63

and businesses and to promote economic recovery. At our institution, we have had frequent requests to

64

offer saliva testing for employees who did not voluntarily agree to NP or MT collection because of a

65

medical condition or personal aversion. We hope to engage these individuals in our voluntary screening

66

program by providing a suitable alternative specimen type. When this study began, saliva was not an

67

accepted specimen type, an Emergency Use Authorization was required by the Food and Drug

68

Administration for testing saliva, and procurement of saliva collection devices with stabilizers was

69

limiting. Previously published studies on saliva testing for COVID-19 vary from 71 to 100% in their

70

reported percent positive agreement or sensitivity of saliva compared with NP (Table S1) (2-4, 6-19).

71

Importantly, the tested population, the saliva collection method, and the processing protocol have

72

varied between the studies, making comparison of results challenging. The number of individuals tested

73

in some studies was relatively low; therefore, performance of saliva warrants additional study to

74

determine the robustness of saliva testing. Here, in a low-prevalence geographical region, we collected

75

samples from a drive-through collection center for symptomatic or exposed employees and during ED

76

visits to evaluate saliva for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a goal to add saliva as an option at

77

our institution for asymptomatic employee screening. We also demonstrated that pooled saliva testing

78

provides acceptable sensitivity on three separate platforms, two of which are high-throughput

79

instruments.

81

Methods:

82

Study Subjects: Subjects were enrolled at two sites. At the NIH, adult employees presenting to a drive-

83

through testing center due to symptoms or exposure were invited to provide SAL at the time of the NP

84

collection. Criteria for referral to the car line included symptoms consistent with potential COVID-19

85

after review by occupational medicine service or recent high-risk exposure to an individual known to be

86

infected with SARS-CoV-2. After giving informed consent, participants were instructed to provide 3-5 mL

87

of saliva using the drooling method into a sterile tube without any stabilizer or solution. Participants

88

were asked to avoid coughing or clearing the throat, if possible, during the collection. Saliva was

89

collected without restriction on timing or intake of food. Following the saliva collection, the NP swab

90

was collected by a healthcare provider. Six participants who were known to be positive returned on

91

subsequent dates and provided paired MT and SAL samples, avoiding the need for the potentially

92

uncomfortable NP collection with an aim to improve study participation, for a total of seven MT

93

specimens. At the Washington Hospital Center, subjects who presented to the emergency department

with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were invited to participate. The study was approved by the

95

institutional review boards for both participating institutions.

96
97

Specimen Collection and Processing:

98

Saliva samples collected in sterile containers without additives were stored at 4°C until testing, and were

99

tested within 36 hours of collection with residual volume from the samples being frozen at -70°C. NP

100

samples were collected with flocked swabs (Puritan) into 3 mL of viral transport media (Corning) and

101

were tested within 12 hours of collection. Saliva/NP/MT specimens (200 μL) were extracted using the

102

NucliSENS easyMAG platform (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) resulting in 50 μL of eluate. All saliva

103

samples were tested only at the NIH laboratory. If a saliva sample was thick and hard to pipet, it was

104

treated with Mucolyse (ProLab Diagnostics, Richmond Hill, ON, Canada) 1:1 with heating at 35°C for 15

105

minutes. Following digestion, 400 μL was extracted by easyMAG for a 50 μL eluate. After testing of the

106

specimens collected in the ED, the remaining NP samples were sent to the NIH laboratory for retesting

107

on easyMAG/ABI 7500 platform, if specimen was available.

108
109

SARS-CoV-2 Assay:

110

Nucleic acid from individual specimens was extracted from 200 μL of Saliva/NP/MT specimens using the

111

NucliSENS® easyMAG® platform (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) with an elution volume of 50 μL.

112

PCR was performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher

113

Scientific, Waltham, MA) (20). The assay utilized primer/probe sets for nucleocapid protein, 2019-

114

nCoV_N1 and 2019-nCoV_N2, and the human RNase P (RP) as an internal control to ensure that

115

extraction and amplification was adequate as described. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were recorded for

116

N1, N2 and RNAse P for each sample. Samples were considered positive for SARS-CoV-2 when both N1

117

and N2 targets were detected with Ct count <40. The positive signal for N1 or N2 alone was defined as

an indeterminate result. The Panther Fusion® SARS-CoV-2 Assay is a real-time RT-PCR assay with

119

detection of two conserved regions of the ORB1ab gene in the same fluorescence channel and was

120

performed on the Panther Fusion (Hologic, Inc., San Diego, CA). The cobas® SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-

121

PCR test was performed on the cobas 6800 instrument (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA).

122

Amplification of SARS-CoV-2 target nucleic acid is achieved by the use of a two-target RT-PCR, one from

123

the SARS-CoV-2 specific ORF1 a/b non-structural region (target 1) and one from a conserved region of

124

the envelope E-gene common to all SARS-like coronaviruses (pan-Sarbecoviruses) (target 2). The pan-

125

Sarbecovirus detection sets will also detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Specimens collected in the ED were

126

tested on one of the platforms at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center Laboratory: BioGX SARS-

127

CoV-2 Reagents for BD MAX™ System (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2, Cepheid’s

128

GeneXpert® Systems (Sunnyvale, CA, USA), DiaSorin Molecular Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct real-time RT-

129

PCR, LIAISON® MDX instrument (Stillwater, MN, USA) or sent to a reference laboratory that uses the

130

QuantStudio (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).

131
132

Pooling Saliva:

133

Equal volumes of saliva from five subjects were pooled into a single tube. Proteinase K, 20 mg/mL

134

(Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was added at a ratio of 12.5 μL per 100 μL

135

volume, followed by vortexing, heating for 5 minutes at 95°C, and brief centrifugation. The following

136

volumes of supernatant were loaded onto three different platforms: 400 μL onto NucliSENS easyMAG

137

(bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France), 500 μL onto the Panther Fusion (Hologic, Inc., San Diego, CA), and

138

600 μL onto the COBAS 6800 (Roche, Pleasanton, CA). Individual samples that were thick were excluded

139

from pooling and run as individual samples only, so none of the samples in the pool were treated with

140

mucolyse prior to pooling.

142

Statistical Methods:

143

Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the cycle threshold (Ct) values. The 95% confidence

144

intervals were calculated using the hybrid Wilson/Brown method. The correlation of Ct values between

145

NP/MT and saliva was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient and represented graphically with

146

linear regression. A two-tailed T test with p <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The negative

147

RT-PCR of the target gene was set at the Ct value of 40 for the statistical analysis. The NP swab test

148

result was used as the reference method for the assessment of test agreement. For analysis of age

149

range, 448 subjects of 449 were included because one subject’s age was not available. All statistical

150

analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Only Ct

151

values derived from testing on a single platform at NIH were included in the statistical analysis, with the

152

only exception being the one calculation of percent positive agreement for the subset of higher viral

153

load specimens (Ct <=34) for which the results from all platforms were considered, if the NP specimen

154

was not also tested at NIH.

155
156

Results:

157

This study includes a total of 918 specimens (459 pairs) collected from 449 individuals between July, 13,

158

2020 and September 18, 2020. Of the total, 390 paired sets were collected from the NIH drive-through

159

testing center and 69 were collected from the MedStar Washington Hospital Center ED. Participants in

160

the drive-through testing center were symptomatic or had a recent high-risk COVID-19 exposure, and all

161

patients in the ED had symptoms suggestive of possible COVID-19. The median age of participants was

162

42 (range 21 – 88 years), with 59% female, 41% male (Table S2). Of the 459 saliva samples, 75 were

163

thick (57/390 (15%) from the drive-through and 18/69 (26%) from the ED) and were treated initially with

164

mucolyse prior to individual testing. A total of 18 failed the initial extraction (13/390 (3%) from drive-

165

through and 2/69 (3%) from the ED) and testing was repeated (Tables S3, S4). The percent positive and

166

negative agreement of saliva compared to reference collection of NP/MT swab (440 NP and 7 MT) were

167

81.1% (95% CI: 65.8 % - 90.5%) and 99.8% (95% CI: 98.7% - 100%) respectively (Table 1). When

168

considering samples with moderate to high viral load only, excluding the lower viral load specimens

169

(defined as Ct of NP/MT <=34), the percent positive agreement increased to 90.0% (95% CI: 74.4% –

170

96.5%). See Table S5.

171
172

A comparison of the Ct of N1 for NP/MT and SAL for all samples tested on the NIH platform showed a

173

higher viral load in the NP/MT samples compared to the SAL samples with median Ct of 26 for NP/MT

174

compared to 31 for saliva (Figure 1A, 1B). Similar results were obtained upon comparison of N2 results

175

for NP and SAL (Figure S1). There was a moderately good correlation of NP/MT Ct values with matched

176

saliva (Figure S2). There was very good correlation for the N1 and N2 Ct values for both NP/MT and SAL

177

(Figure S3A, S3B). Our analysis of the Ct values for the control RP gene indicates that the samples of

178

different specimen types were adequate and the difference in Ct values of saliva vs NP/MT are not due

179

to differences in human material obtained during the collection as saliva had slightly lower median Ct,

180

meaning slightly stronger RP signal even though the SARS-CoV-2 signal is slightly less for saliva (Figure

181

1C).

182
183

To evaluate the pooling approach to testing, equal volumes of saliva were combined into a single tube,

184

excluding samples too thick to pipet well, followed by treatment with proteinase K (21, 22). Three

185

different platforms were tested to increase our options for automated workflow for screening, the CDC

186

assay on the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG/ABI 7500Fast platform, the Hologic Panther Fusion, and

187

Roche COBAS 6800. For pooled testing on any platform, the results of the pool were compared to the

188

individual saliva samples tested on the easyMAG/ABI 7500 platform, as that was our gold standard in

189

the lab for individual saliva testing. For a pooled sample, the average loss of signal was 2-4 Ct values

190

when compared with the individual sample for each platform (Figure 2A-C, Table S6). The sensitivity of

191

detecting a positive specimen in a pool compared with testing individually was 100%, 93%, and 95% for

192

easyMAG/ABI 7500, Hologic Panther Fusion, and Roche COBAS 6800 respectively, with decreased

193

detection of samples with lower viral load as expected. The correlation of Ct values for individual

194

samples versus pooled samples was slightly better for the CDC assay than for the Panther or COBAS

195

assays (Figure S4 A-C). It is possible that future optimization of the processing steps for the automated

196

platforms may lead to improved sensitivity.

197
198

Discussion:

199

With the unprecedented number of deaths worldwide due to a coronavirus infection, screening, testing,

200

and contact tracing for SARS-CoV-2 are essential. Developing new diagnostic measures for detection of

201

COVID-19 is of critical importance to meet the global public health needs of COVID-19 testing. Because

202

saliva can be self-collected, specimen collection can be simplified whereby the number of health care

203

professionals in PPE in special collection centers can be reduced (4, 6, 23). Beginning May 2020, the

204

NIH instituted a program to test asymptomatic employees weekly, but voluntary participation rate was

205

far lower than desired. Some individuals found the NP or MT collection too uncomfortable for routine

206

testing on a weekly basis. The goal of this study was to evaluate and add saliva as an alternative testing

207

option for NIH employee asymptomatic screening only; not to replace our existing test algorithm for

208

symptomatic patients. However, given the low rate of infections identified through our asymptomatic

209

testing program (0.1% positivity rate), we enrolled symptomatic and high-risk exposed individuals

210

through our drive-through collection site (5% positivity rate) and from a local ED (23% positivity in our

211

study set). During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, individual laboratories have been required to

212

validate many different platforms due to supply shortages, multiple collection devices, and various

213

specimen types. Although there are a number of published studies comparing specimen types, each

214

study has a limited number of subjects and there are variations in collection methods, participant

215

characteristics, and testing platforms. In order to be approved to conduct saliva testing, based on

216

regulatory guidelines at the time, we were required to compare paired NP and saliva collections from

217

the same individuals, not only to validate saliva as an acceptable specimen type on our instrument.

218
219

The range of reported sensitivity or percent positive agreement of the saliva collection method, most

220

often compared to NP swab, varies widely from 71 to 100% and is too broad to make a specific guideline

221

without further refinement of the analysis (2-4, 6-19). While our study and others show the

222

acceptability of testing saliva, important variables need to be considered when reviewing various

223

reported conclusions. These include severity of disease (asymptomatic to severe disease in hospitalized

224

patients), method of collection (collection upon waking before any food or water intake, versus forced

225

cough collected later in the day, versus drooling technique with no restriction on food/water intake at a

226

random time later in the day), the gold standard or reference method for comparison in each study (NP

227

versus NP/OP, versus MT), healthcare provider collected versus self-collected NP, addition of stabilizing

228

agent, processing steps, RNA extraction process, and testing platform. Each of the studies alone is

229

limited by which group of individuals was tested, the time and method of collection, and processing

230

methods (4, 19). Some studies were limited by the inability of individuals to elicit a cough when

231

requested (14), and there is a need to consider potential preanalytical errors caused by home-collected

232

samples. It is possible that viral RNA extraction as well as RT-PCR efficiency might differ with the use of

233

different preservation solutions based on their ability to protect viral RNA from degradation as well as

234

their extraction chemistry (24).

235
236

Some studies have shown a lower viral load in saliva (13, 16, 17), but other studies showed similar viral

237

loads between specimens or better viral loads in saliva (6). Studies have reported that higher viral loads

238

were seen in patients with more severe disease (6, 7). In our study, the Ct values were on average

239

higher in saliva (indicating a lower viral load) compared with NP. Comparison of first morning saliva

240

versus a randomly timed collection was not an option for our study, given the consenting workflow.

241

Saliva samples may be less optimal when not a first morning collection, for asymptomatic individuals, for

242

those without food/water restriction, and for those later in the course of disease. Importantly, the range

243

of viral load in the specimens in a small study can greatly affect the final calculated percent positive

244

agreement because the specimens with higher viral loads are more likely to be detected by both NP/MT

245

and SAL; therefore, studies with a higher median viral load across most specimens will show higher

246

percent positive agreement than a study with a lower median viral load. The percent positive agreement

247

on our study changed from 81% to 90% when only moderate to high viral load samples were included in

248

the analysis. A meta-analysis that accounts for collection methods, patient population, and processing

249

methods will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the usefulness of SARS-CoV-2 saliva

250

testing.

251
252

In order to provide high volume screening using saliva, there was a decision at our institution made to

253

pool the samples. We had previously demonstrated that pooling of ten NP samples resulted in only a

254

slight drop in sensitivity (losing an average of 3 Ct values) (25). For saliva, we chose to pool only five

255

saliva samples because the saliva specimen as collected already resulted in a lower sensitivity. When

256

pooling was applied, sensitivity was 100%, 93%, and 95% for the easyMAG/ABI 7500, Panther Fusion,

257

and COBAS 6800, respectively. To date, only a few studies have evaluated the pooling of saliva (26, 27).

258

Pooling conserves reagents and allows for higher throughput. The difference in Ct values between

259

individual saliva samples and pooled saliva samples was 2-4 in our study. When combined with the

260

lower rate of detection of infected individuals using saliva in our study, one might conclude that the use

261

of pooled saliva on an automated platform, albeit with a slightly lower sensitivity, might be acceptable

262

to promote compliance for screening.

263
264

The limitations for our study included the low number of positive participants, testing of symptomatic

265

patients to determine an approach for screening the asymptomatic population, and the combined use of

266

two collection sites (drive-through center and ED). The positive specimens include seven MT of the total

267

38 positives, to increase likelihood of participation in the study. All positive NP samples from the ED did

268

not have a Ct value from the easyMAG/ABI 7500 platform, as not all samples were available for repeat

269

testing. For this reason, only data from the easyMAG/ABI 7500 platform are included in the figures that

270

compare Ct ranges.

271
272

A challenge for all centers offering saliva testing is that some individuals may have difficulty producing

273

adequate saliva for the test. Saliva is also a more challenging specimen for the laboratory staff to handle

274

and requires judgement about thickness to ensure the correct volume is pipetted, with a chance of an

275

under-pipetted sample, due to viscosity or bubbles, leading to a false-negative result, as well as

276

increased likelihood of extraction failure. Initially, mucolyse was added to individual thick saliva

277

specimens prior to extraction, but data obtained during our pooling validation showed that proteinase K

278

digestion for individual thick samples prior to extraction was just as effective. Therefore, thick

279

specimens and pooled specimens follow the same processing procedure.

280
281

When evaluating the effectiveness of saliva collection, it is important to define which individuals are to

282

be captured by the testing. Is the goal to detect anyone who has an infection with the virus or to detect

283

those more likely to be infectious, reported to be Ct <35 in several studies (28-30), with other studies

284

reporting as low as <24 (31). When comparing across published studies, the agreement between reports

285

might increase if considering only samples with higher viral load. For these cases, the consensus

286

appears to be that saliva is an acceptable and convenient method of testing. We conclude that saliva

287

testing would detect employees who were most likely to be infectious to others and that saliva would be

288

an adequate screening approach, although we encourage employees to opt for mid-turbinate collection,

289

if they are willing, as it appears to be a more sensitive approach. Saliva testing is not used for individual

290

patient diagnosis at our institution.
