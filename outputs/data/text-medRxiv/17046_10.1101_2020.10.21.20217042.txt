Research in Context.
Evidence before this study.
SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics affect clinical and public health measures, informing patient care, testing
algorithms, contact tracing protocols, and clinical trial design. We searched Web of Science using the search
terms “ALL = ((SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19) AND (viral OR RNA) AND (load OR concentration OR
shedding) AND (dynamic* OR kinetic* OR trajector*))” which returned 83 references. Of these, 22 were
not pertinent to within-host SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics. The remaining 61 studies tracked SARS-CoV-2
viral trajectories in a variety of geographic locations and patient populations. Together, these studies report
that viral titers normally peak at or before the onset of symptoms and that a long tail of intermittent positive
tests can follow a period of acute infection. Plasma but not nasopharyngeal viral concentration is associated
with increased disease severity. Most studies tracked hospitalized patients after the onset of symptoms. Two
of the studies tracked pre-symptomatic and/or asymptomatic patients, but these were too sparsely sampled
to clearly discern viral dynamics during the earliest stage of infection.
Added value of this study.
We implemented prospective longitudinal real time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of individuals during the resumption of the 201920 National Basketball Association season. This allowed us to explicitly measure viral titers during the full
course of 46 acute infections. Consistent with other studies, we find that peak viral concentrations do not
differ substantially between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals but that symptomatic individuals
take longer to clear the virus than asymptomatic individuals. For both symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals, viral titers normally peak within 3 days of the first positive test. This study is the first to describe
the time course of viral concentrations during the earliest stage of infection when individuals are most likely
to be infectious.
Implications of all the available evidence.
Symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals follow similar SARS-CoV-2 viral trajectories. Due to the rapid
progression from first possible detection to peak viral concentration, frequent rapid-turnaround testing is
needed to screen individuals prior to them becoming infectious.

Abstract (250 words)
Background. SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by viral proliferation and clearance phases and
can be followed by low-level viral RNA shedding. The dynamics of viral RNA concentration, particularly
in the early stages of infection, can inform clinical measures and interventions such as test-based screening.
Methods. We used prospective longitudinal RT-qPCR testing to measure the viral RNA trajectories for 68
individuals during the resumption of the 2019-20 National Basketball Association season. For 46
individuals with acute infections, we inferred the peak viral concentration and the duration of the viral
proliferation and clearance phases.
Findings. On average, viral RNA concentrations peaked 2.7 days (95% credible interval [1.2, 3.8]) after
first detection at a cycle threshold value of 22.4 [20.6, 24.1]. The viral clearance phase lasted longer for
symptomatic individuals (10.5 days [6.5, 14.0]) than for asymptomatic individuals (6.7 days [3.2, 9.2]). A
second test within 2 days after an initial positive PCR substantially improves certainty about a patient’s
infection phase. The effective sensitivity of a test intended to identify infectious individuals declines
substantially with test turnaround time.
Interpretation. SARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations peak rapidly regardless of symptoms. Sequential tests
can help reveal a patient’s progress through infection stages. Frequent rapid-turnaround testing is needed
to effectively screen individuals before they become infectious.

Introduction.
As mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic surpasses one million, SARS-CoV-2 continues to cause
hundreds of thousands of daily new infections1. A critical strategy to curb the spread of the virus without
imposing widespread lockdowns is to rapidly identify and isolate infectious individuals. Because symptoms
are an unreliable indicator of infectiousness and infections are frequently asymptomatic2, testing is key to
determining whether a person is infected and may be contagious.
Real time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) tests are the gold
standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Normally, these tests yield a binary positive/negative
diagnosis based on detection of viral RNA. However, they can also quantify the viral titer via the cycle
threshold (Ct). The Ct is the number of thermal cycles needed to amplify sampled viral RNA to a detectable
level: the higher the sampled viral RNA concentration, the lower the Ct. This inverse correlation between
Ct and viral concentration makes RT-qPCR tests far more valuable than a binary diagnostic, as they can be
used to reveal a person’s progress through key stages of infection3, with the potential to assist clinical and
public health decision-making. However, the dynamics of the Ct during the earliest stages of infection,
when contagiousness is rapidly increasing, have been unclear, because diagnostic testing is usually
performed after the onset of symptoms, when viral RNA concentration has peaked and already begun to
decline, and performed only once4,5. Without a clear picture of the course of SARS-CoV-2 viral
concentrations across the full duration of acute infection, it has been impossible to specify key elements of
testing algorithms such as the frequency rapid at-home testing6 that will be needed to reliably screen
infectious individuals before they transmit infection. Here, we fill this gap by analyzing the prospective
longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR testing performed for players, staff, and vendors during the
resumption of the 2019-20 National Basketball Association (NBA) season.
Methods.
Data collection.
The study period began in teams’ local cities from June 23rd through July 9th, 2020, and testing continued
for all teams as they transitioned to Orlando, Florida through September 7th, 2020. A total of 68 individuals
(90% male) were tested at least five times during the study period and recorded at least one positive test
with Ct value <40. Many individuals were being tested daily as part of Orlando campus monitoring. Due
to a lack of new infections among players and team staff after clearing quarantine in Orlando, all players
and team staff included in the results pre-date the Orlando phase of the restart. A diagnosis of “acute” or
“persistent” infection was abstracted from physician records. “Acute” denoted a likely new infection.
“Persistent” indicated the presence of virus in a clinically recovered individual, likely due to infection that
developed prior to the onset of the study. There were 46 acute infections; the remaining 22 individuals were
assumed to be persistently shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA due to a known infection that occurred prior to the
study period. This persistent RNA shedding can last for weeks after an acute infection and likely represented
non-infectious viral RNA7. Of the individuals included in the study, 27 of the 46 with acute infections and
40 of the 68 overall were from staff and vendors. The Ct values for all tests for the 68 individuals included
in the analysis with their designations of acute or persistent infection are depicted in Supplemental Figures
1–4. A schematic diagram of the data collection and analysis pipeline is given in Figure 1.
Statistical analysis.
We used a Bayesian statistical model to infer the peak Ct value and the durations of the proliferation and
clearance stages for the 46 acute infections with at least on Ct value below 35 (Figure 1; Supplemental
Methods). We assumed that the viral concentration trajectories consisted of a proliferation phase, with
exponential growth in viral RNA concentration, followed by a clearance phase characterized by exponential
decay in viral RNA concentration8. Since Ct values are roughly proportional to the negative logarithm of

viral concentration3, this corresponds to a linear decrease in Ct followed by a linear increase. We therefore
constructed a piecewise-linear regression model to estimate the peak Ct value, the time from infection onset
to peak (i.e., the duration of the proliferation stage), and the time from peak to infection resolution (i.e., the
duration of the clearance stage). We estimated the parameters of the regression model by fitting to the
available data using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm9 yielding simulated draws from the Bayesian
posterior distribution for each parameter. Full details on the fitting procedure are given in the
Supplemental Methods. Code is available at https://github.com/gradlab/CtTrajectories.
Inferring stage of infection.
Next, we determined whether individual or paired Ct values can reveal whether an individual is in the
proliferation, clearance, or persistent stage of infection. To do so, we extracted all observed Ct values within
a 5-unit window (e.g., between 30 and 35 Ct) and measured how frequently these values sat within the
proliferation stage, the clearance stage, or the persistent stage. We measured these frequencies across
10,000 posterior parameter draws to account for that fact that Ct values near stage transitions (e.g., near the
end of the clearance stage) could be assigned to different infection stages depending on the parameter values
(see Figure 1, bottom-right). We did this for 23 windows with midpoint spanning from Ct = 37.5 to Ct =
15.5 in increments of 1 Ct.
To calculate the probability that a Ct value falling within the 5-unit window corresponded to an acute
infection (i.e., either the proliferation or the clearance stage), we summed the proliferation and clearance
frequencies for all samples within that window and divided by the total number of samples in the window.
We similarly calculated the probability that a Ct falling within the 5-unit window corresponded to just the
proliferation phase.
To assess the information gained by conducting a second test within two days of an initial positive, we
restricted our attention to all samples within the 5-unit window that had a subsequent sample taken within
two days. We repeated the above calculations, stratifying by whether the second test had a higher or lower
Ct than the first.
Measuring the effective sensitivity of screening tests.
The sensitivity of a test is defined as the probability that the test correctly identifies an individual who is
positive for some criterion of interest. For clinical diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 tests, the criterion of interest is
current infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, a common goal is to predict infectiousness at some point in
the future, as in the context of test-based screening prior to a social gathering. The ‘effective sensitivity’ of
a test in this context (i.e., its ability to predict future infectiousness) may differ substantially from its clinical
sensitivity (i.e., its ability to detect current infection). A test’s effective sensitivity depends on its inherent
characteristics, such as its limit of detection and sampling error rate, as well as the viral dynamics of infected
individuals.
To illustrate this, we estimated the effective sensitivity of (a) a test with limit of detection of 40 Ct and a
1% sampling error probability (akin to RT-qPCR), and (b) a test with limit of detection of 35 Ct a 5%
sampling error probability (akin to some rapid antigen tests). We measured the frequency with which these
tests would successfully screen an individual who would become infectious (assumed to correspond to Ct
≤ 30) 10 at the time of a gathering when the test was administered between 0 and 3 days prior to the gathering.
We measured this effective sensitivity with respect to 2,500 simulated viral concentration trajectories
sampled from the posterior distributions from the best-fit model, restricting to trajectories with peak Ct
below 30 (any samples with peak Ct > 30 would, by these criteria, never be infectious and so would not
factor into the sensitivity calculation). Full details are given in the Supplemental Methods.

We also estimated the number of individuals who would be expected to arrive at a 1,000-person gathering
while infectious assuming a 2% prevalence of infectiousness in the population under each testing strategy.
To do so, we simulated 1,000 events for which the number of infectious individuals at the event was
simulated using a Binomial distribution with 1,000 draws and ‘success’ probability of 0.02. Then, we
sampled the number of these infectious individuals who would be screened using a second Binomial draw
with ‘success’ probability dictated by the previously calculated effective sensitivity. Further details are
given in the Supplemental Methods. To facilitate the exploration of different scenarios, we have generated
an online tool (https://stephenkissler.shinyapps.io /shiny/) where users can input test and population
characteristics and calculate the effective sensitivity and expected number of infectious individuals at a
gathering.
Results.
Of the 46 individuals with acute infections, 13 reported symptoms at the time of diagnosis; the timing of
the onset of symptoms was not recorded. The mean peak Ct value for symptomatic individuals was 22.2
(95% credible interval [19.1, 25.1]), the mean duration of the proliferation phase was 2.9 days [0.7, 4.7],
and the mean duration of clearance was 10.5 days [6.5, 14.0] (Figure 2). This compares with 22.4 Ct [20.2,
24.5], 3.0 days [1.3, 4.3], and 6.7 days [3.2, 9.2], respectively, for individuals who did not report symptoms
at the time of diagnosis (Figure 2). This yielded a slightly longer overall duration of acute infection for
individuals who reported symptoms (13.4 days [9.3, 17.1]) vs. those who did not (9.7 days [6.0, 12.5]). For
all individuals regardless of symptoms, the mean peak Ct value, proliferation duration, clearance duration,
and duration of acute shedding were 22.4 Ct [20.6, 24.1], 2.7 days [1.2, 3.8], 7.4 days [3.9, 9.6], and 10.1
days [6.5, 12.6] (Supplemental Figure 5). There was a substantial amount of individual-level variation in
the peak Ct value and the proliferation and clearance stage durations (Supplemental Figures 6–11).
Using the full dataset of 68 individuals, we estimated the frequency with which a given Ct value was
associated with an acute infection (i.e., the proliferation or clearance phase, but not the persistence phase),
and if so, the probability that it was associated with the proliferation stage alone. The probability of an acute
infection increased rapidly with decreasing Ct (increasing viral load), with Ct < 30 virtually guaranteeing
an acute infection in this dataset (Figure 3A). However, a single Ct value provided little information about
whether an acute infection was in the proliferation or the clearance stage (Figure 3B).
We assessed whether a second test within two days of the first could improve these predictions. A positive
test followed by a second test with lower Ct (higher viral RNA concentration) was slightly more likely to
be associated with an active infection than a positive test alone (Figure 3C). Similarly, a positive test
followed by a second test with lower Ct (higher viral RNA concentration) was much more likely to be
associated with the proliferation phase than with the clearance phase (Figure 3D).
We next estimated how the effective sensitivity of a pre-event screening test declines with increasing time
to the event. For a test with limit of detection of 40 Ct and a 1% chance of sampling error, the effective
sensitivity declines from 99% when the test coincides with the start of the event to 76% when the test is
administered two days prior to the event (Figure 4A), assuming a threshold of infectiousness at 30 Ct10.
This two-day-ahead sensitivity is slightly lower than the effective sensitivity of a test with a limit of
detection at 35 Ct and a 5% sampling error administered one day before the event (82%), demonstrating
that limitations in testing technology can be compensated for by reducing turnaround time. Using these
effective sensitivities, we estimated the number of infectious individuals expected to arrive at an event with
1,000 people when 2% of the population is infectious. Just as the effective sensitivity declines with time to
the event, the predicted number of infectious individuals rises (Figure 4B).

Discussion.
This report provides first comprehensive data on the early-infection RT-qPCR Ct dynamics associated with
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral titers increase quickly, normally within 3 days of the first possible RT-qPCR
detection, regardless of symptoms. Our findings highlight that repeated PCR tests can be used to infer the
stage of a patient’s infection. While a single test can inform on whether a patient is in the acute or persistent
viral RNA shedding stages, a subsequent test can help identify whether viral RNA concentrations are
increasing or decreasing, thus informing clinical care. We also show that the effective sensitivity of preevent screening tests declines rapidly with test turnaround time due to the rapid progression from
detectability to peak viral titers. Due to the transmission risk posed by large gatherings11, the trade-off
between test speed and sensitivity must be weighed carefully. These data offer the first direct measurements
capable of informing such decisions.
Our findings on the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA shedding expand on and agree with previous
studies12,13 and with observations that peak Ct does not differ substantially between symptomatic and
asymptomatic individuals4. While previous studies have largely relied on serial sampling of admitted
hospital patients, our study used prospective sampling of ambulatory infected individuals to characterize
complete viral dynamics for the presymptomatic stage and for individuals who did not report symptoms.
This allowed us to assess differences between the viral RNA proliferation and clearance stages for
individuals with and without reported symptoms. The similarity in the early-infection viral RNA dynamics
for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals underscores the need for SARS-CoV-2 screening
regardless of symptoms. The rapid progression from a negative test to a peak Ct value 2-4 days later
provides empirical support for screening and surveillance strategies that employ frequent rapid testing to
identify potentially infectious individuals14,15. Taken together, the dynamics of viral RNA shedding
substantiate the need for frequent population-level SARS-CoV-2 screening and a greater availability of
diagnostic tests.
Our findings are limited for several reasons. The cohort does not constitute a representative sample from
the population, as it was a predominantly male, healthy, young population inclusive of professional athletes.
Some of the trajectories were sparsely sampled, limiting the precision of our posterior estimates. Symptom
reporting was imperfect, particularly after initial evaluation as follow-up during course of disease was not
systematic for all individuals. As with all predictive tests, the probabilities that link Ct values with infection
stages (Figure 3) pertain to the population from which they were calibrated and do not necessarily
generalize to other populations for which the prevalence of infection and testing protocols may differ. Still,
we anticipate that the central patterns will hold across populations: first, that low Cts (<30) strongly predict
acute infection, and second, that a follow-up test collected within two days of an initial positive test can
substantially help to discern whether a person is closer to the beginning or the end of their infection. Our
study did not test for the presence of infectious virus, though previous studies have documented a close
inverse correlation between Ct values and culturable virus10. Our assessment of pre-event testing assumed
that individuals become infectious immediately upon passing a threshold and that this threshold is the same
for the proliferation and for the clearance phase. In reality, the threshold for infectiousness is unlikely to be
at a fixed viral concentration for all individuals and may be at a higher Ct/lower viral concentration during
the proliferation stage than during the clearance stage. Further studies that measure culturable virus during
the various stages of infection and that infer infectiousness based on contact tracing combined with
prospective longitudinal testing will help to clarify the relationship between viral concentration and
infectiousness.
To manage the spread of SARS-CoV-2, we must develop novel technologies and find new ways to extract
more value from the tools that are already available. Our results suggest that integrating the quantitative

viral RNA trajectory into algorithms for clinical management could offer benefits. The ability to chart a
patient’s progress through their infection underpins our ability to provide appropriate clinical care and to
institute effective measures to reduce the risk of onward transmission. Marginally more sophisticated
diagnostic and screening algorithms may greatly enhance our ability to manage the spread of SARS-CoV2 using tests that are already available.

assay to generate longitudinal Ct values (‘Raw data’, red points) for each person. Using a statistical model, we estimated Ct
trajectories consistent with the data, represented by the thin lines under the ‘Model fits’ heading. These produced posterior
probability distributions for the peak Ct value, the duration of the proliferation phase (infection onset to peak Ct), and the duration
of the clearance phase (peak Ct to resolution of acute infection) for each person. We estimated population means for these quantities.
The model fits also allowed us to determine how frequently a given Ct value or pair of Ct values within a five-unit window (blue
bars, bottom-right pane) was associated with the proliferation phase, the clearance phase, or a persistent infection.

Figure 2. Peak Ct value and infection stage duration distributions according to symptoms reported at time of diagnosis.
Histograms (colored bars) of 10,000 simulated draws from the posterior distributions for mean peak Ct value (A), mean duration
of the proliferation stage (infection detection to peak Ct, B), mean duration of the clearance stage (peak Ct to resolution of acute
RNA shedding, C), and total duration of acute shedding (D) across the 46 individuals with an acute infection. The histograms are
separated according to whether the person reported symptoms (red, 13 individuals) or did not report symptoms (blue, 33
individuals). The red and blue curves are kernel density estimators for the histograms to assist with visualizing the shapes of the
histograms. The mean Ct trajectory corresponding to the mean values for peak Ct, proliferation duration, and clearance duration
for symptomatic vs. asymptomatic individuals is depicted in (E) (solid lines), where shading depicts the 90% credible intervals.

Supplemental Methods.
Ethics.
Residual de-identified viral transport media from anterior nares and oropharyngeal swabs collected NBA
players, staff, and vendors were obtained from Quest Diagnostics or BioReference Laboratories. In
accordance with the guidelines of the Yale Human Investigations Committee, this work with de-identified
samples was approved for research not involving human subjects by the Yale Internal Review Board (HIC
protocol # 2000028599). This project was designated exempt by the Harvard IRB (IRB20-1407).
Additional testing protocol details.
Clinical samples were obtained by combined swabs of the anterior nares and oropharynx administered by
a trained provider. The samples were initially tested by either Quest Diagnostics (while teams were in local
markets using the Quest SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR16) or BioReference Laboratories (while teams were in
Orlando using the cobas SARS-CoV-2 test17). Viral transport media from positive samples were sent to
Yale University for subsequent RT-qPCR testing using a multiplexed version of the assay from the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 18 to normalize Ct values across testing platforms. A total of
234 samples from BioReference and 128 from Quest were tested at Yale; 49 positive samples had Ct values
assigned on first testing but did not undergo repeat testing at the Yale laboratory. To account for the
different calibration of the testing instruments, we used a linear conversion (Supplemental Figures 12-14,
Methods: Converting Ct values) to adjust these samples to the Yale laboratory scale. Subsequent analysis
is based on the N1 Ct value from the Yale multiplex assay and on the adjusted Roche cobas target 1 assay.
Residual viral transport media (VTM) from Quest Diagnostics or BioReference Laboratories were shipped
overnight to Yale on dry ice. VTM was thawed on ice and 300 µL was used for RNA extraction using the
MagMAX Viral/Pathogen Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit and the KingFisher Flex robot (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA19). Total nucleic acid was eluted into 75ul of elution buffer and SARS-CoV-2
RNA was quantified from 5 µL of extracted total RNA using a multiplexed version of the CDC RT-qPCR
assay that contains the 2019-nCoV_N1 (N1), 2019-nCoV-N2 (N2), and human RNase P (RP) primer-probe
sets18. The RT-qPCR was performed using the Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, US) and the following thermocycler conditions: (1) reverse transcription
for 10 minutes at 55°C, (2) initial denaturation for 1 min at 95°C, and PCR for 45 cycles of 10 seconds at
95°C and 30 seconds at 55°C on the CFX96 qPCR machine (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, US).
Converting Ct values. Most (n = 226) of the 312 positive samples in the raw dataset underwent RT-qPCR
at the Yale laboratory. We used the Yale Ct value whenever it was available. Still, 86 samples underwent
initial diagnostic testing at BioReference Laboratories but not confirmatory testing at the Yale laboratory.
Both platforms rely on a multiplex RT-qPCR strategy. The two testing platforms yield slightly different Ct
values, as evidenced by the 94 samples the underwent RT-qPCR at both facilities (Supplemental Figure
12). For comparison between platforms, target 1 from the Roche cobas assay, which is specific to SARSCoV-2, and the N1 target from the Yale multiplex assay were used. For the 86 samples that were not
processed at the Yale laboratory, we adjusted the Ct values using the best-fit (minimum sum of squares)
linear regression between the initial Ct value and the Yale Ct value for the samples that were processed in
both facilities. To do so, we estimated the coefficients β0 and β1 in the following regression equation:

Here, yi denotes the ith Ct value from Yale, xi denotes the ith Ct value from the initial test, and εi is an error
term with mean 0 and constant variance across all samples. The resulting fit (Supplemental Figure 12)
was strong (R2 = 0.86) with homoscedastic residuals (Supplemental Figure 13) that are approximately
normally distributed, as evidenced by a Q-Q plot (Supplemental Figure 14).

Data parsing. The raw dataset included 3,207 test results for 102 individuals. We excluded 21 individuals
who had 5 or fewer tests, since the data for these individuals were too sparse to reliably infer a Ct trajectory.
We also excluded 13 individuals who did not record any Ct values that surpassed the RT-qPCR limit of
detection (40). We removed 146 entries for which the test result was recorded as ‘positive’ but there was
no associated Ct value; these tests were initially conducted on an instrument that provided only a binary
diagnosis and the samples were not available for confirmatory testing. This left 2,411 total tests for 68
individuals for the main analysis. The median number of tests administered to each of the 68 individuals
was 41 (IQR [14, 51]; Range [5, 70]). The median number of Ct values with viral concentration above the
limit of detection recorded for each person was 3 (IQR [2, 4]; Range [1, 9]). We trivially shifted the date
indices so that date 0 corresponded to the time of the minimum Ct. We set the Ct value for negative tests
equal to the limit of detection. For the statistical analysis, we removed any sequences of 3 or more
consecutive negative tests to avoid overfitting to these trivial values.
Model fitting.
We assumed that the viral concentration trajectories consisted of a proliferation phase, with exponential
growth in viral RNA concentration, followed by a clearance phase characterized by exponential decay in
viral RNA concentration8. Since Ct values are roughly proportional to the negative logarithm of viral
concentration3, this corresponds to a linear decrease in Ct followed by a linear increase. We therefore
constructed a piecewise-linear regression model to estimate the peak Ct value, the time from infection onset
to peak (i.e. the duration of the proliferation stage), and the time from peak to infection resolution (i.e. the
duration of the clearance stage). This idealized trajectory is depicted in Supplemental Figure 15. The
trajectory may be represented by the equation

Here, E[Ct(t)] represents the expected value of the Ct at time t, “l.o.d” represents the RT-qPCR limit of
detection, δ is the absolute difference in Ct between the limit of detection and the peak (lowest) Ct, and to,
tp, and tr are the onset, peak, and recovery times, respectively.
Before fitting, we re-parametrized the model using the following definitions:
●
●
●

ΔCt(t) = l.o.d. – Ct(t) is the difference between the limit of detection and the observed Ct value at
time t.
ωp = tp - to is the duration of the proliferation stage.
ωc = tr - tp is the duration of the clearance stage.

We constrained 0 ≤ ωp ≤ 14 days and 0 ≤ ωp ≤ 30 days to prevent inferring unrealistically large values for
these parameters for trajectories that were missing data prior to the peak and after the peak, respectively.
We also constrained 0 ≤ δ ≤ 40 as Ct values can only take values between 0 and the limit of detection (40).
We next assumed that the observed ΔCt(t) could be described the following mixture model:

where E[ΔCt(t)] = l.o.d. - E[Ct(t)] and λ is the sensitivity of the q-PCR test, which we fixed at 0.99. The
bracket term on the right-hand side of the equation denotes that the distribution was truncated to ensure Ct
values between 0 and the limit of detection. This model captures the scenario where most observed Ct
values are normally distributed around the expected trajectory with standard deviation σ(t), yet there is a
small (1%) probability of an exponentially-distributed false negative near the limit of detection. The log(10)
rate of the exponential distribution was chosen so that 90% of the mass of the distribution sat below 1 Ct
unit and 99% of the distribution sat below 2 Ct units, ensuring that the distribution captures values
distributed at or near the limit of detection. We did not estimate values for λ or the exponential rate because
they were not of interest in this study; we simply needed to include them to account for some small
probability mass that persisted near the limit of detection to allow for the possibility of false negatives.
For the 86 samples that were not tested in the Yale laboratory, we included additional uncertainty in the
observed Ct value by inflating σ(t), such that

Here, σ(tilde) is a constant, ε is the standard deviation of the residuals from the linear fit between the initial
test and the Yale laboratory test, and Iadj is an indicator variable that is 1 if the sample at time t was adjusted
and 0 otherwise.
We used a hierarchical structure to describe the distributions of ωp, ωr, and δ for each individual based on
their respective population means μωp, μωr, and μδ and population standard deviations σωp, σωr, and σδ such
that
ωp ~ Normal(μωp, σωp)
ωr ~ Normal(μωr, σωr)
δ ~ Normal(μδ, σδ)
We inferred separate population means (μ•) for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. We used a
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo fitting procedure implemented in Stan (version 2.24) 9 and R (version 3.6.2)20 to
estimate the individual-level parameters ωp, ωr, δ, and tp as well as the population-level parameters σ(tilde),
μωp, μωr, μδ, σωp, σωr, and σδ. We used the following priors:
Hyperparameters:
σ(tilde) ~ Cauchy(0, 5) [0, ∞]
μωp ~ Normal(14/2, 14/6) [0, 14]
μωr ~ Normal(30/2, 30/6) [0, 30]
μδ ~ Normal(40/2, 40/6) [0, 40]
σωp ~ Cauchy(0, 14/tan(π(0.95-0.5))) [0, ∞]
σωr ~ Cauchy(0, 30/tan(π(0.95-0.5))) [0, ∞]
σδ ~ Cauchy(0, 40/tan(π(0.95-0.5))) [0, ∞]
Individual-level parameters:
ωp ~ Νormal(μωp, σωp) [0,14]
ωr ~ Normal(μωr, σωr) [0,30]
δ ~ Normal(μδ, σδ) [0,40]

tp ~ Normal(0, 2)
The values in square brackets denote truncation bounds for the distributions. We chose a vague half-Cauchy
prior with scale 5 for the observation variance σ(tilde). The priors for the population mean values (μ•) are
normally-distributed priors spanning the range of allowable values for that parameter; this prior is vague
but expresses a mild preference for values near the center of the allowable range. The priors for the
population standard deviations (σ•) are half Cauchy-distributed with scale chosen so that 90% of the
distribution sits below the maximum value for that parameter; this prior is vague but expresses a mild
preference for standard deviations close to 0.
We ran four MCMC chains for 5,000 iterations each with a target average proposal acceptance probability
of 0.99. The first half of each chain was discarded as the warm-up. The Gelman R-hat statistic was less than
1.1 for all parameters except for the tp and ωr associated with person ID 1370, as the posterior distributions
for those parameters were multi-modal (see Supplemental Figures 8-9). This indicates good overall
mixing of the chains. There were fewer than 10 divergent iterations (<0.1% of the transitions after warmup), indicating good exploration of the parameter space.
The posterior distributions for μδ, μωp, and μωr, estimated separately for symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals, are reported in Figure 2 (main text). We fit a second model that did not distinguish between
symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The posterior distributions for these same parameters under
this model are depicted in Supplemental Figure 5. The posterior distributions for the individual-level
parameters ωp, ω, and δ are depicted in Supplemental Figures 6-8, with 500 sampled trajectories from
these posterior distributions for each individual depicted in Supplemental Figure 9. The overall combined
posterior distributions for the individual-level parameters ωp, ωr, and δ are depicted in Supplemental
Figure 10. We estimated the best-fit normal (for δ) and gamma (for ωp and ωr) distributions using the
‘fitdistrplus’ package implemented in R (version 3.6.2)20.
Converting Ct values to viral genome equivalents.
CT values were fitted to a standard curve in order to convert Ct value data to RNA copies or genome
equivalents (GE). Synthetic T7 RNA transcripts corresponding to a 1,363 b.p. segment of the SARS-CoV2 nucleocapsid gene were serially diluted from 106-100 GE/μl in duplicate to generate a standard curve21
(Supplemental Table 1). The average Ct value for each dilution was used to calculate the slope (-3.60971)
and intercept (40.93733) of the linear regression of Ct on log-10 transformed standard RNA concentration,
and Ct values from subsequent RT-qPCR runs were converted to GE using the following equation:

log10 ([RNA]) = (Ct

40.93733)/( 3.60971) + log10 (250)

Here, [RNA] represents the RNA concentration in GE/ml. The log10(250) term accounts for the extraction
(300 μl) and elution (75 μl) volumes associated with processing the clinical samples as well as the 1,000
μl/ml unit conversion.
Inferring the stage of infection using single and paired Ct values
To determine whether individual or paired Ct values can reveal a patient’s stage of infection, we measured
the frequency with which a Ct value falling within a 5-unit band, possibly followed by a second Ct value
of higher or lower magnitude, was associated with the proliferation stage, the clearance stage, or the
persistent stage. First, we assigned to each positive test the probability that it was collected during each of
the three stages of infection. To do so, we began with the positive samples from the 46 individuals with
acute infections and calculated the frequency with which each sample sat within the proliferation stage, the

clearance stage, or the persistent stage (i.e., neither of the previous two stages) across 10,000 posterior
parameter draws for that person. For the remaining 22 individuals, all positive samples were assigned to
the persistent stage. Next, we calculated the probability that a Ct value falling within a 5-unit window
corresponded to an active infection (i.e., either the proliferation or the clearance stage) by summing the
proliferation and clearance probabilities for all positive samples with that window and dividing by the total
number of positive samples in the window. We considered windows with midpoints spanning from Ct =
37.5 to Ct = 15.5 (Figure 3A). We performed a similar calculation to determine the probability that a Ct
falling within a given 5-unit window corresponded to just the proliferation phase, assuming it had already
been determined that the sample fell within an active infection (Figure 3B). Finally, to assess the
information gained by conducting a second test within two days of an initial positive, we collected all
positive samples with a subsequent sample (positive or negative) that was taken within two days and
repeated the above calculations, separating by whether the second test had a higher or lower Ct than the
first.
Calculating effective sensitivity.
The sensitivity of a test is defined as the probability that the test correctly identifies an individual who is
positive for some criterion of interest. For clinical SARS-CoV-2 tests, the criterion of interest is current
infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, for the time-to-event analysis presented in the main text, the
criterion of interest is infectiousness at some point in the future. The effective sensitivity of a test (with
respect to future infectiousness) may differ substantially from its clinical sensitivity (with respect to current
infection).
The effective sensitivity of a test intended to detect future infectiousness depends on the test’s
characteristics (its limit of detection and sampling error rate) as well as the viral dynamics of infected
individuals. To determine the effective sensitivity of a test n hours before an event, we first sampled 2,500
posterior draws for the proliferation time, clearance time, and peak Ct value from the MCMC fits to the
viral trajectory data. We included only draws with a peak Ct ≤ 30, as we assumed Ct = 30 to be the threshold
of infectiousness (individuals with a peak Ct > 30 would never be infectious according to this threshold and
therefore would never satisfy the criterion of interest, i.e., infectiousness at the event). We trivially defined
the event’s start time to be t = 0 and assumed that the event lasted for 3 hours. For each of the 2,500
individuals, we identified the range of possible onset times for the proliferation stage that would ensure the
person would be infectious (Ct < 30) at some point during the event. We uniform-randomly drew a
proliferation onset time from this range for each individual. We then simulated a test at time –n. Any
individuals with Ct greater than the test’s limit of detection at time –n went undetected. Any individuals
with Ct less than the test’s limit of detection at time –n were detected with probability (1-sampling error).
The effective sensitivity was calculated as the number of individuals successfully detected divided by the
total number of individuals who could have been detected (2,500). We repeated this calculation for 1-hour
increments through 3 days prior to the event. We considered two tests, one with a limit of detection at 40
Ct and a sampling error of 1% (analogous to RT-qPCR) and one with a limit of detection at 35 Ct and a
sampling error of 5% (analogous to a rapid antigen test).
To calculate the expected number of individuals who might attend an event while infectious given a test n
hours before the event, we simulated 1,000 events. For each event, we drew the number of individuals who
would have attended the event while infectious in the absence of testing, η, from a Binomial(N, p)
distribution where N is the number of event attendees (1,000 for the examples presented in the main text)
and p is the prevalence of infectious individuals in the population (2% for the examples in the main text).
We then calculated the number of individuals who were successfully identified using a Binomial(η, eff_se)
distribution where η is the number of individuals who would have been infectious at the event in the absence
of testing and eff_se is the effective sensitivity of the test when administered at time –n. The remaining

individuals were missed by the test. This value (its mean and 90% quantiles across the 1,000 simulated
events) is reported in Figure 4b (main text).
The online calculator differs slightly from the above procedure. Rather than drawing directly from the
posterior distributions for the MCMC fits, the calculator allows the user to input different values specifying
the population distribution of proliferation times, clearance times, and peak Ct values. The proliferation
times and clearance times are described by independent Gamma distributions with user-input mean and
standard deviation. The peak Ct values are defined by independent normal distributions with user-input
mean and standard deviation, truncated to ensure that the values lie between 0 and 40 Ct. The default values
align with the best-fit values for the respective Gamma and normal distributions reported in the caption of
Supplemental Figure 10. The effective sensitivity values and expected number of infectious attendees
therefore differ slightly from the values reported in the main text due to these distributional approximations
and the fact that the values are drawn independently (in the posterior draws, there is some correlation
between the parameters). Still, the calculations align closely and allow for greater flexibility in allowing
the user to update the viral trajectory parameters to reflect different populations.
