ABSTRACT
This study shows that the disease free equilibrium (ùë¨ùüé ) for COVID-19 coronavirus does not satisfy
the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability. This implies that as a pandemic as declared
by WHO (2020) the COVID-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary
measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures. Also, the Basic
Reproductive number (ùëÖ0 < 1) by Equation (33) shows that there is a chance of decline of
secondary infections when the ratio between the incidence rate in the population and the total
number of infected population quarantined with observatory procedure.
The effort to evaluate the disease equilibrium shows that unless there is a dedicated effort from
government, decision makers and stakeholders, the world would hardly be reed of the COVID-19
coronavirus and further spread is eminent and the rate of infection will continue to increase despite
the increased rate of recovery because of the absence of vaccine at the moment.
Keywords: coronavirus pandemic globally, COVID-19 coronavirus, mathematical modeling of
infection disease, SEIRUS-model, parameter identification, statistical methods.

1. INTRODUCTION
A recent study by Nesteruk (2020) and Ming and Zhang (2020) focuses on the epidemic outbreak
cased by COVID-19 coronavirus due to the global trend of the pandemic with its origin from
mainland China. In his study, Nesteruk (2020) used the popular SIR (Susceptible-InfectiousRemoved) model to obtain optimal values for the model parameters with the use of statistical
approach and hence predicated the number of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus
time. This model approach by Nesteruk (2020) has been a major breakthrough in modelling disease
control as used by several authors (Ming and Zhang, 2020 and Oduwole and Kimbir (2018) among
others). However, although there exist a global interest in knowing the rate of infection that will

occur over time globally, it is of great interest to propose a mathematical model for the end in the
spread and subsequent elimination of the virus. Hence, in this study we adopt solutions from Victor
and Oduwole (2020) for a new deterministic endemic model (Susceptible ‚Äì Exposed ‚Äì Infectious
‚Äì Removed ‚Äì Undetectable ‚Äì Susceptible: SEIRUS) originally developed for the control of the
prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Africa.
The resulting equations are a system of coupled homogenous differential equations. Numerical
experiments with relevant simulation showing how the variation of the reproductive number (R 0)
affect the number of infected individuals is carried out. Conscious effort through evaluating the
new deterministic SEIRUS model is done to reduce the reproductive number (R0) to zero for a
possible halt of the spread of the disease thereby leading to an endemic equilibrium to eradicate
the disease in a later time in the future.
In summary, this study aims to develop and evaluate the new deterministic endemic SEIRUS
compartmental

model

of

the

COVID-19

coronavirus

dynamics

which

combines

quarantine/observatory procedures and behavioral change/social distancing in the control and
eradication of the disease in the most exposed sub-population.
The wide spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus and the lack or inefficiency of purposeful and result
based intervention is a great call for other empirical and scientific interventions which seeks to
review strategic models and recommendations of social and scientific research for disease control.
Although previous studies have been tailored towards the epidemiology and the disease-free
equilibrium where the reproductive number of the infectious population is at its barest minimum,
this study seeks to study the evaluative impact of the endemic equilibrium of a new endemic
deterministic model while taking into consideration that possibility of the recovered population
being Undetectable and fit to be moved to the Susceptible compartment which will therefore imply
a zero secondary infection of the disease globally.
Also, this research work will contribute significantly to recent research findings by Nesteruk
(2020) and Ming and Zhang (2020) as well as inform government, non-government organizations
as well as policy maker‚Äôs decision on sustainable policies to prevent the spread of the disease based
on specific age groups of the active population.

2. Maturation (or maturity) is interpreted as the period between infection to the period of
symptoms observation (days 1 to 14)
3. The susceptible population are first exposed to a latent class where they can infected or
not.
4. Some infected individuals move to the removed class when they are quarantined for
observatory procedures.
5. The recruitment from the ùëÜ-class into the ùê∏-class is through contacts from population in
the I-class to the S-class
6. The recruitment into the ùëÖ-class from the ùêº-class at a rate ùúé.
7. The recruitment into the ùëà-class from the ùëÖ-class depends on the effectiveness of the
quarantine and observatory procedure at a rate ùúå.
8. Death is implicit in the model and it occurs in all classes at constant rate ùúá. However, there
is an additional death rate in the ùêº and ùëÖ classes due to infection for both juvenile and
adult sub-population denoted by ùúë and ùúõ respectively.

2.2 MODEL DESCRIPTION
This study uses the deterministic endemic model where a susceptible class is a class that is yet to
be infected, but is open to infection as interactions with members of the ùêº-class continuous. An
infected individual is one who has contracted the coronavirus and is at some stage of infection. A
removed individual is one that is confirmed to have the virus with its expected symptoms and is
under quarantine while following relevant observatory procedures. A member of the undetectable
class is one that has been removed and does not secrete the virus anymore and has been satisfied
by the WHO standard to be in the undetectable class.

The following diagram describes the dynamic of SEIRUS framework, and will be useful in the
formulation of model equations.

(ùë¨ùüé ) OF THE SEIRUS MODEL
The disease-free equilibrium (DFE) state of the endemic SEIRUS model is obtained by setting the

(21)

Ignoring the native values of ùë†1‚àó and ùë†2‚àó and other stringent conditions, there exist a unique trivial

Hence, according to (Gerald, 2012, p255), the Determinant of the Jacobian Matrix ùë±ùë¨ùüé is given by
the recursive definition for a 5 √ó 5 matrix defined as;
ùê∑ùëíùë°(ùêΩùê∏0 ) = ùëé11 ùëëùëíùë°(ùêΩùê∏0 11 ) ‚àí ùëé12 ùëëùëíùë°(ùêΩùê∏0 12 ) + ùëé13 ùëëùëíùë°(ùêΩùê∏0 13 ) ‚àí ‚ãØ ¬± ùëé5 ùëëùëíùë°(ùêΩùê∏0 5 ) (28)
And from (27)
ùê∑ùëíùë°(ùêΩùê∏0 ) = 0

(29)

Similarly from the Trace of the Jacobian matrix (ùë±ùë¨ùüé ) given in equation (27) we have that
ùëáùëüùëéùëêùëí(ùë±ùë¨ùüé ) = ‚àí

ùëÅ

(30)

Hence, since ùê∑ùëíùëì(ùë±ùë¨ùüé ) = 0 and ùëáùëüùëéùëêùëí(ùë±ùë¨ùüé ) > 0 which does not satisfy the prescribed threshold
criteria based on Gerald (2012), then the disease free equilibrium (ùë¨ùüé ) for COVID-19 coronavirus
does not satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability. This implies that as a
pandemic as declared by WHO (2020) the COVID-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine
yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures.

3.4 COMPUTATION OF THE BASIC REPRODUCTIVE NUMBER (ùëπùüé ) OF THE
MODEL
The Basic Reproductive number (ùëÖ0 ) is deÔ¨Åne as the number of secondary infections that one
infectious individual would create over the duration of the infectious period, provided that
everyone else is susceptible. ùëÖ0 = 1 is a threshold below which the generation of secondary cases
is insuÔ¨Écient to maintain the infection in human community. If ùëÖ0 < 1, the number of infected

individuals will decrease from generation to next and the disease dies out and if ùëÖ0 > 1 the number
of infected individuals will increase from generation to the next and the disease will persist.
To compute the basic reproductive number (ùëÖ0 ) of the model (22) ‚Äì (26), we employ the next
generation method as applied by Diekmann et. al., (2009), Van den Driessche and Watmough
(2002) and Oduwole and Kimbir (2018).

The Basic Reproductive number (ùëÖ0 < 1) by Equation (33) shows that there is a chance of decline
of secondary infections when the ratio between the incidence rate in the population and the total
number of infected population quarantined with observatory procedure. Hence although there
currently exist no clinical vaccine for the cure of COVID-19 coronavirus, with Equation (33) there
is a high chance of decline in infection when all precautionary measures are observed globally.

4. DESCRIPTION AND VALIDATION OF BASELINE PARAMETERS FOR
GLOBAL CASES OF COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS
According to the WHO (2020), the total cases of COVID-19 coronavirus worldwide stands:
142,320 and the current total deaths is 5,388 from about 129 countries.

4.1 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The age-structured deterministic model (11) ‚Äì (15) was solved numerical using Runge-KuttaFehllberg 4-5th order method and implemented using Maple Software. The model equations were
first transformed into proportions, thus reducing the model equations to ten differential equations.
The parameters used in the implementation of the model are shown in Table 1 below. Parameters
were chosen in consonance with the threshold values obtained in the stability analysis of the
disease free equilibrium state of the model.

COVID-19 Coronavirus

Figure 4 clearly shows that over a short period of time the rate of infection of the COVID-19
coronavirus will increase globally before normalizing at a point where future occurrence will be
halted due to active quarantine and observatory procedures as prescribed by the WHO (2020) with
the hope that a vaccine will be made ready in a shortest future possible.
Similarly, the chart also reveals that the rate of recovery will continue to increase despite the
negligible increase in death rate from the COVID-19 coronavirus globally.

5. CONCLUSIONS
In this study, the ùê∑ùëíùëì(ùë±ùë¨ùüé ) = 0 and ùëáùëüùëéùëêùëí(ùë±ùë¨ùüé ) > 0 does not satisfy the prescribed threshold
criteria based on Gerald (2012), then the disease free equilibrium (ùë¨ùüé ) for COVID-19 coronavirus
does not satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability. This implies that as a
pandemic as declared by WHO (2020) the COVID-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine
yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures. Also,
the Basic Reproductive number (ùëÖ0 < 1) by Equation (33) shows that there is a chance of decline
of secondary infections when the ratio between the incidence rate in the population and the total
number of infected population quarantined with observatory procedure.
The effort to evaluate the disease equilibrium shows that unless there is a dedicated effort from
government, decision makers and stakeholders, the world would hardly be reed of the COVID-19
coronavirus and further spread is eminent. Therefore, as corroborated by the studies of Nesteruk
(2020) and Ming and Zhang (2020), the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the
increased rate of recovery because of the absence of vaccine at the moment.
Meanwhile, with observatory procedures and quarantine the rate of recovery will not only be
enhanced, the chances of total recovery where the virus nor it symptoms will be undetectable is
achievable as the rate of detection becomes negligibly small in the bodies of the recovered
population.
