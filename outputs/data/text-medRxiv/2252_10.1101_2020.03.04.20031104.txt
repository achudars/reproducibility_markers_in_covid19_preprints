Abstract

1

Background. As of 16 May 2020, more than 4.5 million cases and more than
300,000 deaths from disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported. Reliable estimates of mortality
from SARS-CoV-2 infection are essential to understand clinical prognosis, plan
health care capacity and for epidemic forecasting. The case fatality ratio (CFR),
calculated from total numbers of reported cases and reported deaths, is the most
commonly reported metric, but can be a misleading measure of overall mortality.
The objectives of this study were to: 1) simulate the transmission dynamics of
SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data; 2) infer estimates of
SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for biases and examine the CFR, the
symptomatic case fatality ratio (sCFR) and the infection fatality ratio (IFR) in
different geographic locations.
Method and Findings. We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposedinfected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of
transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts
for two biases: preferential ascertainment of severe cases and right-censoring of
mortality. We fitted the transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei
province, China and applied the same model to six regions in Europe: Austria,
Bavaria (Germany), Baden-Württemberg (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), Spain
and Switzerland. In Hubei, the baseline estimates were: CFR 2.4% (95% credible
interval [CrI]: 2.1-2.8%), sCFR 3.7% (3.2-4.2%) and IFR 2.9% (2.4-3.5%).
Estimated measures of mortality changed over time. Across the six locations in
Europe estimates of CFR varied widely. Estimates of sCFR and IFR, adjusted for
bias, were more similar to each other but still showed some degree of heterogeneity.
Estimates of IFR ranged from 0.5% (95% CrI 0.4-0.6%) in Switzerland to 1.4%
(1.1-1.6%) in Lombardy, Italy. In all locations, mortality increased with age.
Among 80+ year olds, estimates of the IFR suggest that the proportion of all
those infected with SARS-CoV-2 who will die ranges from 20% (95% CrI: 16-26%)
in Switzerland to 34% (95% CrI: 28-40%) in Spain. A limitation of the model is
that count data by date of onset are required and these are not available in all
countries.
Conclusions. We propose a comprehensive solution to the estimation of
SARS-Cov-2 mortality from surveillance data during outbreaks. The CFR is not a
good predictor of overall mortality from SARS-CoV-2 and should not be used for
evaluation of policy or comparison across settings. Geographic differences in IFR

suggest that a single IFR should not be applied to all settings to estimate the total
size of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in different countries. The sCFR and IFR,
adjusted for right-censoring and preferential ascertainment of severe cases, are
measures that can be used to improve and monitor clinical and public health
strategies to reduce the deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Why was this study done?

43

• Reliable estimates of measures of mortality from severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are needed to understand clinical
prognosis, plan health care capacity and for epidemic forecasting.
• The case fatality ratio (CFR), the number of reported deaths divided by the
number of reported cases at a specific time point, is the most commonly used
metric, but is a biased measure of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
• The symptomatic case fatality ratio (sCFR) and overall infection fatality ratio
(IFR) are alternative measures of mortality with clinical and public health
relevance, which should be investigated further in different geographic locations.

53

• We developed a mathematical model that describes infection transmission and
death during a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. The model takes into account the delay
between infection and death and preferential ascertainment of disease in people
with severe symptoms, both of which affect the assessment of mortality.
• We applied the model to data from Hubei province in China, which was the first
place affected by SARS-CoV-2, and to six locations in Europe: Austria, Bavaria
(Germany), Baden-Württemberg (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), Spain and
Switzerland, to estimate the CFR, the sCFR and the IFR.
• Estimates of sCFR and IFR, adjusted for bias, were similar to each other and
varied less geographically than the CFR. IFR was lowest in Switzerland (0.5%)
and highest in Hubei province (2.9%). The IFR increased with age; among 80+
year olds, estimates ranged from 20% in Switzerland to 34% in Spain.
What do these findings mean?

• The CFR does not predict overall mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection well and
should not be used for the evaluation of policy or for making comparisons between
geographic locations.
• There are geographic differences in the IFR of SARS-CoV-2, which could result
from differences in factors including emergency preparedness and response, and
health service capacity.
• SARS-CoV-2 infection results in substantial mortality. Further studies should
investigate ways to reduce death from SARS-CoV-2 in older people and to
understand the causes of the differences between countries.

Introduction

76

The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
infection has resulted in more than 4.5 million confirmed cases and more than 300,000
deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as of 16 May, 2020 [1]. The infection
emerged in late 2019 as a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan,
Hubei province [2, 3]. China had reported 84,038 cases and 4,637 deaths by 16 May,
2020, with no new deaths since early April. The largest outbreaks are now in the United
States of America and Western Europe. The transmission characteristics of
SARS-CoV-2 appear to be similar to those of the 1918 pandemic influenza strain [4], but,
at this early stage of the pandemic, the full spectrum and distribution of disease severity
and of mortality are uncertain. Reliable estimates of measures of mortality are needed
to understand clinical prognosis, plan health care capacity and for epidemic forecasting.
The case fatality ratio (CFR), the number of reported deaths divided by the number
of reported cases at a specific time point, is the most commonly used metric because
most countries collect this information [2, 5]. However, the CFR can be misleading if
used to assess the overall risk of death from an infection because of two opposing
biases [6, 7]. First, because of the delay of several weeks between symptom onset and
death, the number of confirmed and reported deaths at a certain time point does not
consider the total number of deaths that will occur among already infected individuals
(right-censoring). Second, surveillance-based case reports underestimate the total
number of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, because testing focuses on individuals with
symptoms of COVID-19 and, among symptomatic cases, on patients with more severe
manifestations (preferential ascertainment). In addition, the World Health Organization
does not distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 and defines a
confirmed case as a person with laboratory confirmation of infection, irrespective of
signs and symptoms. The number of cases detected and reported therefore depends on
the extent and strategy of testing for SARS-CoV-2, especially amongst people without
severe symptoms. Precisely defined measures could be more useful for describing
SARS-CoV-2 mortality than the CFR [6]. The symptomatic case fatality ratio (sCFR)
is the proportion of infected individuals showing symptoms who die over the course of
their SARS-CoV-2 infection and is clinically relevant to assessment of prognosis and
healthcare requirements. The infection fatality ratio (IFR) is the proportion of all
people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who will eventually die from the disease, and is a
central indicator for public health evaluation of the overall impact of an epidemic in a
given population.
Estimates of the sCFR and IFR can be obtained from prospective longitudinal
studies of representative samples of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection but such
studies cannot provide the information needed for clinical and public health
decision-making in real time. The objectives of this study were to: 1) simulate the
dynamics of transmission and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available
surveillance data; and 2) provide overall and age-stratified estimates of sCFR and IFR
for SARS-CoV-2, adjusted for right-censoring and preferential ascertainment, in
different geographic locations.

The first known case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was traced back to December 1st, 2019 in
Wuhan, the main city of Hubei province, China [3]. The first reported death was on 11
January 2020. Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 led to exponential growth
of the reported incidence of cases (Fig 1A). On 20 January 2020, Chinese authorities
implemented extensive control measures in Hubei: early identification and isolation of
clinical cases, tracing and quarantining of contacts, temperature checks before accessing
public areas, extension of the lunar new year holiday period, and extreme social
distancing, including cancellation of mass gatherings [8]. Three days later, a cordon
sanitaire was imposed, with strict traffic restrictions. From 27 January, the daily
incidence of cases, by date of symptom onset, started to plateau, then decreased.
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) reported the
number of cases by date of symptom onset, and the age distribution of cases and deaths
up 11 February 2020 in China (Fig 1B) [9]. We extracted these data, together with the
age distribution of the Chinese population. Deaths counts were obtained from a
repository aggregating data from Chinese public data sources [10]. We used data about
the daily number of potentially infectious contacts by age group in Shanghai [11]. We

assumed that all data sources were applicable to the population of Hubei. As of 11
February, after which information about date of symptom onset was no longer available,
there were 41,092 cases and 979 deaths, resulting in a CFR of 2.4%.

The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Europe were reported at the end of January
2020. Italy was the first country with a large epidemic, after a cluster of cases, followed
shortly by the first deaths, emerged in Lombardy at the end of February. As of 16 May
2020, Europe is the continent having reported the highest number of cases and deaths
(more than 1,800,000 confirmed cases and 160,000 deaths) [1].
We selected European countries that reported the daily number of cases of confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection by date of symptoms onset. In countries where this information
was available at a regional level, we selected worst-affected regions. We extracted data
about the number of confirmed cases by symptom onset, the daily number of deaths,
and the distribution of cases and deaths across age groups for each of six locations:
Austria, Bavaria (Germany), Baden-Württemberg (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), Spain
and Switzerland.
For Austria, we obtained all required data from published reports from 11 March to
14 April [12]. On 14 April, there were 14,151 reported cases and 399 deaths (CFR 2.8%).
For Germany, we used published data from 3 March to 16 April [13]. Age distributions,
available at the country level only, were applied to both regions. On 16 April, there were
31,196 cases (62% with date of onset) and 802 deaths in Baden-Württemberg (CFR
2.6%) and 36,538 cases (56% with date of onset) and 1,049 deaths in Bavaria (CFR
2.9%). For Lombardy, we collected published data from 11 February to 25 April [14, 15].
Age distributions at the national level were applied to Lombardy. On 25 April, there
were 74,346 cases (77% with date of onset) and 13,263 deaths (CFR 17.8%). For Spain,
we used published data from 2 March to 16 April [16]. On 16 April, 178,031 cases (79%
with date of onset) and 19,478 deaths were reported (CFR 10.9%). For Switzerland, we
used individual-level data from 2 March to 23 April aggregated by day of onset or day
of death [17]. On 23 April, there were 33,228 cases (11% with date of onset) and 1,302
deaths (CFR 3.9%). Further details about the data are available in S1 Text, section 1.

We used an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental
model that distinguished between incubating, pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic and
symptomatic infections. We stratified the population into nine 10-year groups (0-9 up
to 80+ years) for all locations except Austria where the age groups were 0-4, 5-14, up to
75+ years. We assumed that susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of acquisition
per contact is identical for each age group and that transmission is possible during
pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. We used age-specific contact matrices to
model contact patterns according to age group (contact matrix derived by Zhang et al.
for Hubei [11], and the POLYMOD contact matrix for the six European locations [18]).
We modelled the decrease in SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to control measures using a
logistic function for the transmission rate.
In the model, after an average incubation period of 5.0 days [19], 81% (95%CrI:
71-89) of infected people develop symptoms of any severity and the rest remain
asymptomatic [20, 21]. The estimated proportion of symptomatic infections was derived
from outbreak investigations included in a systematic review and is implemented as a
beta distribution to propagate uncertainty. Studies that have estimated the proportion
of asymptomatics have not provided conclusive evidence of an age trend, so we assumed

it to be constant [22]. We assumed reduced infectiousness during the period of 2.3 days
preceding symptom onset (pre-symptomatic compartment) and also among
asymptomatic individuals [19].
The model was used to compute the number of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections
by day of symptom onset in each age group. We applied an age-specific ascertainment
proportion to the number of symptomatic infections to estimate the number of reported
cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections by date of symptom onset. To identify the parameters,
we assumed that 100% of infections in the oldest age group (80+ years old, 75+ years
old in Austria) were reported. We assumed that mortality only occurred in
symptomatic people, and that the time from symptom onset to death followed a
log-normal distribution with mean 20.2 days and standard deviation 11.6 [23]. This
allowed us to account for the deaths occurring after the date of data collection.
Separately for Hubei and the six European locations, we simultaneously fitted our
model to the data sets described above (Fig 1): (1) the number of confirmed cases by
day of symptom onset, (2) the number of deaths by day of occurrence, (3) the age
distribution of all confirmed cases and (4) the age distribution of all reported deaths.
We assumed a negative binomial distribution for data (1) and (2), and a multinomial
distribution for data (3) and (4). All parameters were estimated from data except for
the incubation period, the generation time, the contribution of presymptomatics to
transmission, the presymptomatic duration, and the time from symptom onset to death.
The fitted model was used to produce estimates (median posterior distributions with
95% credible intervals, CrI) of the total number of symptomatic and
pre-/a-symptomatic infections (adjusted for preferential ascertainment) and of the total
number of deaths (adjusted for right-censoring). These were then transformed into
adjusted estimates of sCFR and IFR. Besides parameter values and model structure,
these estimates rely on the following additional assumptions:

reporting;

Sensitivity analysis

233

From 12 February 2020, the Chinese authorities changed their criteria for reporting
cases, increasing the total by more than 25,000. Reported numbers of deaths increased
on 16 April, when Wuhan city reported an additional 1,290 deaths. We ran a sensitivity
analysis with corrected numbers of cases and deaths in Hubei province. We also
examined the impact of assuming a 50% lower susceptibility in 0-19 years old, and of a
lower ascertainment among 80+ year olds (from 90% to 10%, compared with a fixed
proportion of 100% in the main analysis). We also re-fitted the model at different dates
of data collection (every 5 days from 12 January to 11 February) to examine the effect
of the accumulation of data over time. Additional sensitivity analyses are presented in
S1 Text, section 6.
We implemented the model in a Bayesian framework using Stan [24]. All code and
data are available from https://github.com/jriou/covid_adjusted_cfr.

Results

246

Our model accurately describes the dynamics of transmission and mortality by age
group during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Hubei from 1 January to 11 February 2020
(Fig 2). The model predicts that control measures implemented from 20 January
reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility by 92% (95%CrI: 87-100), with a steep diminution
in case incidence 4.3 (95%CrI: 3.2-5.4) days after 20 January. Assuming 100% of cases
aged 80 and older were initially reported, we estimate that a total of 83,300 individuals
(95%CrI: 73,000-98,600) were infected in Hubei between 1 January and 11 February
2020. Of these, the number of symptomatic cases is estimated at 67,000 (95%CrI:
60,500-73,600), 1.6 times (95%CrI: 1.5-1.8) more than the 41,092 reported cases during
that period. Accounting for the later correction in the number of reported cases, the
total number of infections increases to 138,000 (95%CrI: 120,000-162,000). The
proportion of ascertained cases by age group increased from less than 9% (95%CrI: 8-10)
under 20 years old to 93% (95%CrI: 88-98) in the age group 70-79 (the ascertainment
proportion was assumed to be 100% in the age group 80+, Fig 3A).

date of symptom onset, (B) total cases, (C) age distribution of cases, (D) incidence of
deaths, (E) total number of deaths among individuals infected until 11 February 2020
and (F) age distribution of deaths. White circles and bars represent data. Lines and
shaded areas or points and ranges show the posterior median and 95% credible intervals
for six types of model output: reported cases, symptomatic cases, overall cases (i.e.
symptomatic and asymptomatic cases), reported deaths until 11 February 2020,
projected deaths after 11 February 2020 and overall deaths.
The model predicts a total of 2,450 deaths (95%CrI: 2,230-2,700) among all people
infected until 11 February in Hubei (compared with 979 deaths at this point without
adjusting for right-censoring). This results in an estimated IFR of 2.9% (95%CrI:
2.4-3.5, Table 1). Assuming the later correction of deaths was evenly distributed by
date of symptom onset and age group, the total number of deaths increases to 3,430
(95%CrI: 3,120-3,760). When using the corrected numbers of cases and deaths, we
derived an IFR of 2.5% (95%CrI: 2.1-2.9).

Fig 3. (A) Estimated proportion of cases ascertained by age group in Hubei, China

fixed proportion of cases ascertained among individuals aged 80 and older from 10% to
100% on the mortality estimates. (D) Mortality estimates at different dates of reporting
(every 5 days from January 12 to February 11).
The estimated sCFR, more relevant to the clinical setting, was 3.7% (95%CrI:
3.2-4.2) in the baseline analysis and 3.1% (95%CrI: 2.7-3.6) after correction of the
increase number of reported cases and deaths. The estimated sCFR increased with age
(S1 Text, section 5): under 20 years of age, below 1 in 1,000; 20-49 years, between 3 and
8 per 1,000; 50-59 years, 2.5% (95%CrI: 2.0-3.0); 60-69 years, 8.0% (95%CrI: 6.9-9.3);
70-79 years, 19.3% (95%CrI: 16.7-22.1); 80 years and older, 39.0% (95%CrI: 33.1-46.1).
In sensitivity analyses, the correction of the number of reported cases (+65%) and
deaths (+40%) by the local authorities in Hubei did not influence the ascertainment
proportion (Fig 3A) but led to a proportional decrease of the sCFR and IFR estimates
by 15%, as expected from the correction applied (1.40/1.65 = 0.85, Fig 3B and Table 1).
Second, lowering the susceptibility of individuals aged 0-19 years by 50% did not affect
the ascertainment proportion or the sCFR in other age groups (Fig 3A and B). The
decrease in the denominator led to a proportional increase of total sCFR and IFR.
Third, relaxing the assumption of complete reporting of cases among individuals aged
80 years and older resulted in a proportional decrease of the sCFR and IFR (Fig 3C).
Fourth, patterns in the observed mortality changed as the epidemic progressed (Fig 3D).
The CFR increased as delayed deaths were reported. The sensitivity analysis suggests
that our proposed approach overestimates the sCFR and IFR when applied before the
peak of incidence (around 27 January) and stabilizes afterwards. Additional sensitivity
analyses examining how the contribution of pre-symptomatic transmission, the

susceptibility of children and several other choices in model structure and parameter
values did not impact the results (S1 Text, section 6).
We applied the same model to data from six European locations with all required
data: Austria, Germany (Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria), Italy (Lombardy), Spain
and Switzerland. The model fit was satisfactory in all cases (S1 Text, section 3). CFR
estimates differed widely between countries, while sCFR and IFR estimates were more
similar to each other (Table 1 and Fig 4A). Across countries, model estimates of IFR
ranged from 0.5% (95%CrI: 0.4-0.6) in Switzerland to 1.4% (95%CrI: 1.1-1.6) in
Lombardy, Italy. The patterns of age-specific IFR estimates were similar across
locations (Fig 4B), despite differences in the surveillance-reported age distribution of
cases (Fig 4C). Some degree of variability remained between age-specific IFR estimates,
especially in older age groups. Compared with Hubei province, higher proportions of
cases in European locations were in older age groups, suggesting higher levels of
preferential ascertainment of severe cases. This appears in the estimated patterns of the
age-specific ascertainment proportion, with a generally lower ascertainment of age
groups 20-79 in Europe compared to Hubei (Fig 4D). Additional results are presented in
S1 Text, section 5.

In this modelling study, we estimate different measures of mortality from SARS-CoV-2
infection in Hubei province, China and six geographic locations in Europe. After
adjusting for right-censoring and preferential ascertainment, we estimate the IFR in
Hubei to 2.9% (2.4-3.5), higher than the CFR of 2.4%. In different European settings,
estimates of IFR ranged from 0.5% (95%CrI: 0.4-0.6) in Switzerland to 1.4% (95%CrI:
1.1-1.6) in Lombardy, compared with CFR of 3.9% and 17.8%, respectively. The model
estimates of mortality show a strong age trend in all locations, with very high risks in
people aged 80 years and older: between 20% (95%CrI: 16-26) in Switzerland and 34%
(95%CrI: 28-40) in Lombardy.

SARS-CoV-2 infection which directly translates the data-generating mechanisms leading
to biased observations of the number of deaths (because of right-censoring) and of cases
(because of preferential ascertainment). Our model also accounts for the effect of control
measures on disease transmission. We implemented the model in a Bayesian framework
in order to propagate most sources of uncertainty from data and parameter values into
the estimates. In Hubei, as the model captured most of the epidemic wave, the
predicted number and timing of deaths could be compared with later reports of
SARS-CoV-2 deaths, providing some degree of external validation (S1 Text, section 4).
Third, our model is stratified by age group, which has been shown as a crucial feature
for modelling emerging respiratory infections [25]. Fourth, the model uses surveillance
data that can be collected routinely, and does not require individual-level data or
studies in the general population.
Our study has several limitations. First, an important assumption is that all cases in
symptomatic individuals aged 80 years and older were reported, as a result of more
severe symptoms at older ages. We cannot confirm this, but the high risk of death from
SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst the elderly was reported very early on [3], so we believe
that most old people with symptoms sought care. Sensitivity analyses show that sCFR
and IFR estimates decrease linearly with a lower ascertainment of infections among
individuals aged 80 years and older (Fig 3C). For the IFR in Hubei province to be below
0.5%, fewer than 15% of infections in individuals aged 80 years and older would have
been ascertained by the local authorities.

Second, our model requires surveillance data about the incidence of cases of reported
SARS-CoV-2 by date of symptom onset. When information on symptom onset is only
available for a subset of cases, we have to assume that data are missing at random.
Additionally, within a given geographic location, the model assumes a constant
ascertainment proportion and a constant mortality for each age group during the period.
When repeating the analysis at different stages of the epidemic in Hubei, we found that
estimates obtained before the epidemic peak led to overestimation of the sCFR and IFR
(Fig 3D). This finding could be the result of a decrease in mortality as the epidemic
progresses, but could also be attributed to a lower ability of the model to estimate the
epidemic size before epidemic peak is reached, a common problem in epidemic
modelling [26].
Third, we assume that the deficit of reported cases among younger age groups is a
result of preferential ascertainment, whereby younger individuals have milder symptoms
and are less likely to seek care, and does not reflect a lower risk of infection in younger
individuals. During the pandemic of H1N1 influenza, lower circulation in older
individuals was attributed to residual immunity [27]. There is no indication of
pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in humans [8]. Lower susceptibility of younger
individuals for immunological reasons seems unlikely. Different contact patterns could
contribute to different attack rates by age group. We include age-specific contact
patterns in the model, so our results are dependent on the contact matrix used. In a
sensitivity analysis, with 50% reduced susceptibility in children, the estimates of
age-specific IFR in other age groups did not change, but the lower number of total
infections and led to a higher IFR.
Fourth, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections that remains asymptomatic is still
uncertain. To propagate this uncertainty into the results, we implemented a prior
distribution informed by the findings of outbreak investigations included in a living
systematic review and meta-analysis [20, 21]. Our estimate is in agreement with the
findings of a statistical modelling study of an outbreak on the cruise ship “Diamond
Princess”, estimating an average proportion of symptomatic infections of 82.1%
(95%CrI: 79.8-84.5) [28]. Another study of 87 contacts of infected cases in Shenzhen,
China, estimated that 80.4% (95%CrI: 70.9-87.4) were symptomatic [19]. Additionally,
dichotomization into asymptomatic and symptomatic is a simplification; SARS-CoV-2
causes a spectrum of symptoms, likely depending on age, sex and comorbidities.
Serological surveys in the general population will be needed to better characterize
asymptomatic infections [29].

Our model-based estimates have some degree of external validation from serological
studies of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In Geneva, Switzerland, a study reported
an attack rate of 9.7% (95% confidence interval: 6.1-13.1) in the city, resulting in an IFR
of 0.6%, very close to our national estimate for Switzerland [30]. Preliminary results
from a national seroprevalence study in Spain, with more than 60,000 participants,
found an attack rate of 5.0% (95% confidence interval: 4.7-5.4), consistent with our
estimate of 5.7% (95% CrI: 5.0-6.6) [31]. A study of excess mortality in Italy estimated
17,786 ± 269 deaths in Lombardy, close to our credibility interval for the number of
total deaths [32]. This study did not attempt to estimate the size of the epidemic, but
only applied the proportion of positive tests to the population to obtain an upper limit
of epidemic size, which resulted in a lower bound for the IFR of 0.6% in Lombardy.
Model-based estimates of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in China, adjusting for bias,
vary. Our estimate for Hubei province is higher than the sCFR of 1.4% estimated in two
other modelling studies [33, 34]. Differences in modelling approaches and assumptions
explain the variation. Verity et al. used a similar modelling approach, but applied their

findings to all of mainland China, where mortality outside Hubei province appeared
lower [9]. This paper also assumed a homogeneous attack rate across age groups, rather
than simulating epidemics using an age-specific contact matrix. Wu et al. used another
approach, assuming that susceptibility to infection varies by age. Both Verity et al. and
Wu et al. used data from individuals leaving Wuhan before lockdown was implemented
to infer ascertainment, where we fixed it to 100% for the oldest age group. This resulted
in comparatively lower ascertainment proportions (up to 70% for the oldest age groups
in Verity et al., 2% for Wu et al.), and consequently to higher estimates of epidemic size
and lower estimates of sCFR. The use of data from travellers might result in bias,
especially if people who can travel are healthier than the general population.
Other studies that attempt to adjust for right-censoring of deaths give different
estimates of mortality in China than in our study. A study using a competing risk
model estimated mortality at 7.2% (95% confidence interval: 6.6%-8.0%) for Hubei
province [35]. Using data on exported cases, another team estimated mortality of 5.3%
(95% confidence interval: 3.5%, 7.5%) among confirmed cases in China [36]. Another
team reported a CFR of 18% (95% credible interval: 11-81%) among cases detected in
Hubei, accounting for the delay in mortality and estimated the IFR at 1.0% (95% CI:
0.5%-4%), based on data from the early epidemic in Hubei and from cases reported
outside China [37]. Our estimate of mortality among all infected cases in Hubei is also
higher than in an earlier version of this work (2.9% against 1.6%) [38]. We believe the
newer estimate to be more reliable for two reasons. First, we implemented age-specific
risks of transmission through a contact matrix, which partially explains the age patterns
in reported SARS-CoV-2 infections and leads to lower estimates of the total number of
infections, thus increasing mortality. Second, a higher estimated proportion of
symptomatic people based on new data also led to higher estimates of mortality among
all infected.

In this study, we propose a comprehensive solution to the estimation of mortality from
surveillance data during outbreaks, using two measures of mortality [6]. Adjusted for
right-censoring and preferential ascertainment of severe cases, the IFR is a measure of
overall mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be used to assess the
potential consequences of the pandemic, e.g. using theoretical estimates of final
epidemic size [39]. The sCFR is a measure of mortality that is most relevant to the
clinical setting, for assessment of prognosis and prioritization of health care services.
Crude CFR estimates are a poor predictor of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection, as
demonstrates for instance the comparison of CFR and IFR values in Switzerland (high
CFR, lowest IFR) and Hubei (lowest CFR, highest IFR). In addition to the inherent
biases, the wide variation in CFR between geographic locations is likely to reflect
external factors, including policies for testing and differences in systems of surveillance
and reporting more than differences in mortality. Crude CFR values should therefore
not be used for evaluating policy or making comparisons across settings.
Our model-based estimates of the IFR and sCFR varied geographically (Fig 4A).
The highest estimate of IFR was found in Hubei province (2.9%; 95%CrI: 2.4-3.5 in the
baseline analysis). The steep increase in mortality among people aged 60 years and
older, reaching very high values in people aged 80 years and older is of concern. The
credibility of this estimate, and of our approach for adjusting for right-censoring, is
supported by the model predictions of reported daily SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths in
Hubei province after 11 February (S1 Text, section 4). The estimated IFR decreases to
2.5% (95%CrI: 2.1-2.9) when accounting for the later correction of reported cases and
deaths by the local authorities, and increases to 3.3% (95%CrI: 2.7-4.0) if we consider a
lower susceptibility of individuals under 20 years. We also show that applying our

model at earlier stages of the epidemic would have resulted in higher estimates of sCFR
and IFR, and more uncertainty (Fig 3D). However, our estimates here correspond to an
average value over the considered period, and it has been shown that mortality has
changed over time as a result of an improvement of the standard of care [8].
The estimated IFR in Lombardy, 1.4% (95%CrI: 1.1-1.6), was lower than in Hubei
province, but higher than in five other European locations. Further research is necessary
to better understand the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 mortality. These
differences highlight the importance of local factors on the outcome of SARS-CoV-2
infection, including demographic characteristics. A partial explanation for the
remaining heterogeneity is the lower degree of preparedness and health service capacity
in northern Italy, which in Europe was affected first by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
Consequently, we suggest that a single mortality estimate should not be applied to all
settings to estimate the total size of the epidemic [40]. This study shows that the IFR
and sCFR, adjusted for right-censoring and preferential ascertainment biases, are
appropriate measures of mortality for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be used to
improve and monitor clinical and public health strategies to reduce the deaths from
SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We developed a mechanistic approach to correct the CFR for bias due to right-censoring
and preferential ascertainment and provide adjusted estimates of mortality due to
SARS-CoV-2 infection by age group. We applied this approach to seven different
settings, showing that widely different estimates for the CFR corresponded in fact to
more similar estimates of the IFR, around 3% in Hubei province, China, and ranging
between 0.5 and 1.4% in six included European locations. Despite these similarities,
substantial heterogeneity remains in the IFR estimates across settings, indicating the
impact of local conditions on the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The steep increase
in mortality among people aged 60 years and older, reaching very high values in people
aged 80 years and older is of concern.
