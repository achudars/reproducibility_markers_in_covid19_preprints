Abstract
The COVID-19 outbreak has clear clinical1 and economic2 impacts, but also affects behaviors
e.g. through social distancing3, and may increase stress and anxiety. However, while case
numbers are tracked daily4, we know little about the psychological effects of the outbreak on
individuals in the moment. Here we examine the psychological and behavioral shifts over the
initial stages of the outbreak in the United States in an observational longitudinal study. Through
GPS phone data we find that homestay is increasing, while being at work dropped precipitously.
Using regular real-time experiential surveys, we observe an overall increase in stress and mood
levels which is similar in size to the weekend vs. weekday differences. As there is a significant
difference between weekday and weekend mood and stress levels, this is an important decrease
in wellbeing. For some, especially those affected by job loss, the mental health impact is severe.

Introduction
The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has become a global crisis, not just because of rising
infection and death rates but also because of the behavioral changes it necessitates. Even those
who are not directly affected by the disease have seen their lives disrupted through mandated
social distancing measures. These sudden changes can impact an individual's mental wellbeing:
reduced social connections is linked to depression5, while physical restrictions of quarantine can
also have negative psychological effects6. In addition to the outbreak’s clinical and economic
impact, we also need to understand these mental wellness and behavioral changes in order to
combat the disease.
Both wellbeing and behavior can be measured digitally, such as through online surveys7,
or location and survey data collected by phone sensors8,9. There has already been work
examining the spread of COVID-19 in China using mobility data from the social media platform
Tencent10 as well as work measuring mental health-related effects of the outbreak through crosssectional web surveys11,12. However, only ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) allow us
to understand how the situation affects the way we feel in the moment. In this article we explore
how people are changing their behavior in the first weeks of the pandemic, and the nature of the
associated changes in wellbeing and psychological distress as measured with EMAs.
We use data on 127 U.S. adult participants (Table 1) from an ongoing longitudinal study,
where they completed baseline assessments of their mental wellbeing and installed a personal
sensing application on their phones. This application administers EMAs asking questions about
their mood (“How is your mood?”), stress (“Are you stressed?”), rated on 9-point Likert scales in
the morning, afternoon and evening as participants go about their daily lives, allowing us to track
day-to-day changes in wellbeing. The PHQ-89 is administered at 3-week intervals to measure

depressive symptom severity. The app also records detected GPS locations, and asks questions
about the locations participants have visited (“What kind of place is this?”). From GPS data, we
measure how much time participants spent at work and at home, as well as their general
movement levels as the outbreak unfolds. We then use these location measures with EMA data to
compare our participant’s behavior and mental wellbeing in study weeks before and after the
national state of emergency declaration (3/13)13 social distancing guidelines (3/16)14.
Results

Figure 1.
We want to understand shifts in behavior and wellbeing that coincide with mandated
social distancing and other quarantine measures. We saw sharp decreases in time spent at work
(Cohen’s d=0.33, 95% CI [-5.26, -2.12], p<0.001) as well as increases in time spent at home
(Cohen’s d=0.38, 95% CI [7.07, 13.83], p<0.001) that coincided with governmental mandates of

social distancing (Figure 1, Table 2). The corresponding increases in stress (Cohen’s d=0.15,
95% CI [0.03, 0.41], p=0.03) and mood (Cohen’s d=0.17, 95% CI [0.08, 0.41], p<0.01) across
the two weeks are also statistically significant. This can be compared to the weekday/weekend
distinction of stress (Cohen’s d=0.23, 95% CI [0.19, 0.45], p<0.01) and mood (Cohen’s d=0.13,
95% CI [0.06, 0.30], p<0.01) during the pre-COVID period.
For EMA-administered PHQ, we find that the changes within individuals across the two
study periods were not significant (Cohen’s d=0.11, 95% CI [-0.11, 1.29], p=0.1). However, we
see that individuals who have been directly impacted by the crisis through job loss show
worsening of depressive symptoms. Seven individuals reported job loss during the post-social
distancing study week, and all seven also reported an increase in their depression severity
(median increase of 3 points); the probability of that happening by chance is 1/128 (Table 3).
These results are consistent with other findings15 that show the direct impact of the virus on
mental wellbeing through income instability is severe.
Discussion
We did not see evidence of significant worsening in depression at a population level in
the first weeks following the national declaration of emergency and social distancing guidelines.
We did see significant increases in mood and stress; however these were small. At a population
level, the stress and mood impact of the outbreak is comparable to every day being a weekday.
Our results suggest a significant increase in depressive symptom severity for those affected by
job loss. Though our findings are not consistent with the kind of massive mental health crisis at a
population level that some in the media speculate them to be, our data do suggest that the mental
health consequences are likely concentrated in groups that have been substantially affected by
the pandemic, such as those who have lost employment. There are undoubtedly other groups that

experience strong influences, and further investigation into these at-risk groups is needed to
understand the nature of any psychological impact so that mental health services can be
appropriately allocated for the crisis.
It is important to note the sampling limitations of our study. Our participants are recruited
from a research panel and are not wholly representative of national demographics. In particular,
our sample over-represents females and individuals with previously diagnosed depression (Table
1). We also note that our analysis is based on completed EMAs for each individual and does not
account for missed surveys. The survey response rate dropped in the week post declaration of
emergency compared to previous weeks (75% response rate to 65% response rate), so it is
possible that the participants most affected by the crisis are self-censoring16. Furthermore, as we
only look at short-term effects of the coronavirus crisis, these findings may change as time goes
on. We will continue monitoring the longer-term response to the crisis and will report on trends
as they emerge. Although it remains to be seen how individuals respond as the coronavirus crisis
progresses, these findings suggest that at the population level and on a short time scale, the
COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress levels widely, but has not had a uniform impact on
mental health. Rather, it is likely concentrated in at-risk groups such as those who have lost
employment.
Methods
Participants
Participants across the United States were invited to participate in our study through
Focus Pointe Global, a national research panel, in an enrollment period beginning February 4,
2020 and ending February 10, 2020. We included participants who were at least 18 years old,
owned an Android phone, and who did not report any prior diagnosis of severe mental illness

(e.g. bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder). Participant demographic characteristics can be found
in Table 1. All study protocols were approved by Northwestern University’s Institutional Review
Board.
Data Collection and Processing
Participation in the 16 week study which began February 11, 2020 included completing
online surveys administered via REDCap17,18 at baseline and at check-ins occurring once every
three weeks. Participants also installed Passive Data Kit (PDK)12, a library and mobile app for
collecting cell phone sensor data, on their phones. Sensor data collected include real-time GPS
coordinates as well as EMA surveys administered three times a day for seven consecutive
“check-in” days that occur every three weeks.
When participants were in a check-in week, they were prompted via phone notification at
their preferred times of day. The stress (“are you stressed?”) and mood (“how is your mood?”)
EMAs were administered at all three daily check-ins with a nine-point Likert scale. The evening
survey also presented a map and prompted participants to label particular stationary locations
they were detected to have visited throughout the day (“what kind of place is this?). At the
beginning and end of the check-in week, an additional set of EMA questions were sent to the
participants which correspond to the PHQ-8 depression inventory.
The raw GPS data collected by PDK was sampled at roughly 15 second intervals and was
transformed into higher-level features of semantic location duration for our study. We assigned a
label of “home” or “work” for every GPS reading if it was within 500 meters of the participantlabelled home or work locations. These labelled location readings were then aggregated to
produce daily estimates of time spent in both location categories.

We ran paired, two-tailed Student t-tests of within-individual sensor data in the two most
recent check-in weeks of our study: 3/3/20-3/9/20, and 3/24/20-3/30/20. These dates straddle the
most prominent government-mandated disruptions with the national declaration of emergency
(3/13) and the White House recommendation limiting gatherings (3/16). Daily measurements of
semantic location, EMAs, and PHQ were averaged within each week of analysis. Weekend and
weekday averages for individuals were calculated over all weeks of our study up through 3/9/20,
to align with the last EMA period before coronavirus-related disruptions. The paired values for
every individual who had at least one reading in both study periods were used for our t-test,
which was 120 participants for location sensors, 127 participants for EMAs, and 113 participants
for PHQ-8 surveys. Complete hypothesis testing information can be found in Table 2. Summary
statistics on PHQ-8 surveys among participants who recently experienced job loss can be found
in Table 3.
