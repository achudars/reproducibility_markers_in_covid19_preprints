Abstract
Background Since December 2019, a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred
in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread rapidly from China to other countries. In-hospital
mortality are high in severe cases and cardiac injury characterized by elevated cardiac troponin are
common among them. The mechanism of cardiac injury and the relationship between cardiac
injury and in-hospital mortality remained unclear. Studies focused on cardiac injury in COVID-19
patients are scarce.
Objectives To investigate the association between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality of
patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
Methods Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data of consecutive confirmed or
suspected COVID-19 patients admitted in Wuhan No.1 Hospital from 25th December, 2019 to 15th
February, 2020 were extracted from electronic medical records and were retrospectively reviewed
and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to explore the risk
factors associated with in-hospital death.
Results A total of 110 patients with confirmed (n=80) or suspected (n=30) COVID-19 were
screened and 48 patients (female 31.3%, mean age 70.58±13.38 year old) among them with
high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) test within 48 hours after admission were included, of
whom 17 (17/48, 35.4%) died in hospital while 31 (31/48, 64.6%) were discharged or transferred
to other hospital. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was elevated in 13 (13/48, 27.1%) patents.
Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed pulse oximetry of oxygen saturation (SpO2) on
admission (HR 0.704, 95% CI 0.546-0.909, per 1% decrease, p=0.007), elevated hs-cTnI (HR
10.902, 95% 1.279-92.927, p=0.029) and elevated d-dimer (HR 1.103, 95%CI 1.034-1.176, per
1mg/L increase, p=0.003) on admission were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.

Conclusions Cardiac injury defined by hs-cTnI elevation and elevated d-dimer on admission were
risk factors for in-hospital death, while higher SpO2 could be seen as a protective factor, which
could help clinicians to identify patients with adverse outcome at the early stage of COVID-19.
Introduction
Since December 2019, a cluster of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease now
named as 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei
Province, China and spread rapidly from China to other countries[1][2][3]. Cardiac injury and
arrhythmias were common, especially for ICU patients [1][4]. Short-term prognosis of COVID-19
patients are discrepancy and in-hospital mortality risk are high in severe cases[1][2] Although
previous study had indicated that several risk factors were independently associated with
short-term mortality, such as elevated d-dimer, older age and higher Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment (SOFA) score[2], few studies focused on cardiac injury with COVID-19 patients.
High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) was highly sensitive and specific markers of
myocardial damage [5] and hs-cTnI elevation was not uncommon with COVID-19 patients[1][2].
However, a recent report of autopsy for a COVID-19 patient found that there were a few
interstitial mononuclear inﬂammatory infiltrates, but no other substantial damage in the heart
tissue [6]. Until now, the relationship between cardiac injury and in-hosptial prognosis and the
mechanism of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients remained controversial. Studies focused on
cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients were scarce. In the present study, we sought to investigate
the association between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19.
Method
Study design and participants
All consecutive patients with confirmed or suspected 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease
(COVID-19) according to WHO interim guidance admitted in Wuhan No.1 Hospital from 25th
December 2019 to 15th February 2020 were retrospectively screened. Wuhan No.1 Hospital is a
reginal comprehensively central hospital which was responsible for the treatments for COVID-19
assigned by the government since 14th February 2020. Before 14th February 2020, patients with
confirm or suspected COVID-19 were transferred to designated hospital after initial treatment. A
portion of suspected patients with COVID-19 at the early stage of the outbreak did not receive
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR testing due to the
limited supplies of diagnostic detection reagents. Patients who underwent hs-cTnI test within 48
hours after admission were included. Oral consents of all patients were obtained. This study was
approved by the Wuhan No.1 Hospital institutional ethics committee. A comparison between
non-survivors and survivor had been done and characteristics between patients who were included
or not were also compared.
Data collection
Demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory data and in-hospital outcomes including death,
transferred to designated hospital and discharge were extracted from electronic medical records.
Laboratory procedures
Throat-swab specimens were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 detection from suspected patients using
real-time PCR assay, which was performed by local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and Wuhan No.1 Hospital. Routine blood examinations were complete blood count, serum

biochemical tests (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and
electrolytes) were done for all inpatients on admission while the examinations of hs-cTnI,
coagulation profile and C reactive protein were determined by the treating physician. Clinicians
tended to perform hs-cTnI test on patients who were vulnerable to cardiac injury by their
judgement.
Definitions
Confirmed cases and suspected cases and the illness severity of COVID-19 was defined according
to the Chinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 5.0 or 6.0). The date of disease
onset was defined as the day when the symptom was noticed. The durations from onset of disease
to hospital admission were recorded. Fever was defined as axillary temperature of at least 37.3°C.
The criteria for discharge were absence of fever for at least 3 days, substantial improvement in
both lungs in chest CT, clinical remission of respiratory symptoms, and two throat-swab samples
negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA obtained at least 24 h apart. Cardiac injury was defined if the
serum levels of high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-cTnI) were above the 99th percentile upper
reference limit (0.026ug/L). Survivor group was composed of patients who was discharged or
transferred to other hospital while non-survivor group included patients who died during hospital
stay. Patients were followed up until they met survival endpoints.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables with normal distribution were presented as mean±SD while were presented
as median (IQR). Categorical variables were presented as n (%). We used the Student’s t test,
Mann-Whitney U test, or Fisher’s exact test to compare diﬀerences between survivors and
non-survivors where appropriate. To explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death,
univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used. Considering the total number of
deaths (n=17) in our study and to avoid overfitting in the model, five variables were chosen for
multivariable analysis on the basis of previous findings, results of baseline characteristics
comparison and clinical constraints. In a recent large cohort[2], Older age and d-dimer elevation
was related to in-hospital death. SpO2 decrease was more common with severe patients than
general patients. Chronic kidney diseases and elevated serum creatinine was more common among
non-survivors [2]. Cardiovascular disease, lymphocytopenia and C reactive protein were excluded
because their between-group diﬀerences were not significant. Severe type was excluded due to
collinearity with SpO2. Between-group diﬀerences of leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia
were statistically significant but we did not included them duo to unclear clinical significant.
Hence, age, SpO2, serum creatinine value, d-dimer value analyzed as continuous variates and
hs-cTnI elevation analyzed as categorical variate were chosen ultimately for our multivariable Cox
regression model. Kaplan-Meier curve with log-rank test was used to compared mortality between
patients with or without myocardial injury (MI). A two-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using the SPSS software (version 19).
Result
From 25th December 2019 to 15th Feb 2020, a total of 110 patients（45.5% female, mean age
64.03±16.54 year old）with suspected (n=30, 27.3%) or confirmed (n=80, 72.7%) COVID-19 were
admitted in department of respiration or emergency department of Wuhan No.1 Hospital. Cough
was the most common onset symptom (n=38, 34.5%), followed by fever (n=33, 30.0%), fatigue

(n=15, 13.6%), shortness of breath (n=10, 9.1%), lack of appetite (n=5, 4.5%), vomiting (n=3,
2.7%), dizziness (n=2, 1.8%), diarrhea (n=2, 1.8%), abdominal distention (n=1, 0.9%) and
pharyngalgia (n=1, 0.9%). Median duration from symptom onset to admission was 7.0(IQR3.0-9.0)
days. After median 9.0（IQR，6.0-12.0）days of hospitalization, death, discharge and transfer were
28 (25.5%), 64 (58.2%) and 18 (16.4%) patients respectively. A total of 64（58.2%）patients
underwent hs-cTnI test during hospitalization. Among them, 48（75.0%, 48/64）patients who had
their first hs-cTnI test within 48h after admission were included in our study. Among the
remaining 16 patients, first hs-cTnI test performed between 4～7 days, 8～14 days and ≥14 days
were in 7, 6 and 3 patients, respectively. All the other laboratory tests described in methods were
done within 48h after admission. Inclusion flow chart was shown in Figure 1.

A brief comparison was made between patients who was included (n=48) or not (n=62) in our
study (TABLE 1) and found that patients included were older and male, hypertension, coronary
artery disease, atrial fibrillation were more common among patients included. Disease severity
status and treatment were similar. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients included (35.4% vs
17.7%, p=0.045).

The mean age of 48 patients included was 70.58±13.38 year old and 15（31.3%）patients were
female. After a median follow-up of 10 days, 17 patients (17/48, 35.4%) died while 29 (29/48,
60.4%) and 2 (2/48, 4.2%) were discharged or transferred to other hospital, respectively. Baseline
clinical characteristics of 48 patients were shown in TABLE 2 compared by non-survivor and
survivor. Patients died during hospital stay was older and severer on admission and the SpO2 was
lower. Chronic kidney disease was more common among non-survivor while hypertension,
coronary artery disease, diabetes, previous stroke and atrial fibrillation was similar between two
gruops. The comparison of laboratory test shown higher value of serum creatinine, C reactive
protein, d-dimer, white blood cell count but lower with hemoglobin and platelet in non-survivors.
More intensive respiratory support was given to non-survivor due to the severity status but few
patients were given invasive ventilation.

patients (10 patients in hs-cTnI group and 7 patients in normal gourp) died and 31 (64.6%) were
discharged or transferred to designated hospital. Mortality was significantly higher among patients
with hs-cTnI elevation（76.9% vs 20.0%, P＜0.001）(Figure 2). Kaplan-Meier curve shown that
in-hospital mortality were higher among patients with elevated hs-cTnI (log-rank p=0.005)(Figure

on admission (HR 0.704, 95% CI 0.546-0.909, per 1% decrease, p=0.007), elevated hs-cTnI (HR
10.902, 95% 1.279-92.927, p=0.029) and elevated d-dimer (HR 1.103, 95%CI 1.034-1.176, per
1mg/L increase, p=0.003) on admission were independently associated with in-hospital mortality

Discussion:
Obviously there is an major concern globally regarding the emerging outbreak of COVID-19,
with increasing cases confirmed in multiple countries currently. The World Health Organization
has upgraded its coronavirus risk assessment to "very high" at global level as COVID-19
continuously spread in more countries despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts.
Recent studies concerning the novel coronavirus provided evidence of the potential connection
SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute cardiac injury[2, 4]. We observed that the clinical symptoms of
COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia were highly variable and overlap, whereas the most
common symptoms were cough, fever and fatigue, with dizziness and diarrhea less common.
While typical symptoms like fever could be absent in the disease progression particularly in
elderly, adversely, gastrointestinal discomfort and altered mental status presented more frequently.
High sensitivity cTnI tests were more inclined to perform on participants with older age and
preexisting concomitants include hypertension, cardiovascular disease and atrial fibrillation.
Mortality rate was higher significantly in the older individuals, might explained by decaying
organ systems，particularly respiratory tract, immune system and cardiovascular system and
urinary system. In addition, more remarkable laboratory abnormalities was observed within severe
patients and those with poor outcomes. The concentration of CRP was considerably higher among
the deceased than the survived ones. The average hemoglobin count was obviously lower than the
survivors and over half deaths sustained with anemia，suggesting a relatively status of hypoxia and

malnutrition. The occurrence of leukocytosis might accompany with a secondary bacterial
infection which has higher frequency in non-survivors.
Thrombocytopenia was revealed in more than half non-survivors whereas not to the degree of
depletion, which provided extra evidence that the coagulation was highly activated. We analyzed
the coagulation marker as manifested by d-dimer, notably revealing that there were substantial
coagulation abnormalities in COVID-19 patients, in addition, more profoundly among severe and
fatal illness. Most non-survivors underwent oxygen administration，which we unfortunately
discovered whether noninvasive nor invasive mechanical ventilation could reverse the rapidly
deterioration of multi-systemic damage. The multivariate Cox regression model showed that
elevation of hs-cInI and the levels of SpO2% and d-dimer were independent predictors of
in-hospital prognosis of COVID-19. Evidently, the elevation of hs-cT and D-dimer and decreased
SpO2 was associated with higher risk of death.
Current reports suggest that majority of patients on admission for pneumonia underwent
coagulation disorders, which included higher platelet aggregating activity, elevated levels of
antithrombin and thrombin–antithrombin complex, decreased factor IX activity[7, 8]. The
association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute myocardial injury has been appreciated,
likewise stronger when the infection is more severe. Limited reports of autopsy detected
cardiomyocytes necrosis and degeneration，with intercellular substance infiltrated with small
amounts of monocytes ， lymphocyte and/or neutrophils, additionally, the occurrence of
endoangiitis and thrombosis was noted [9]. No evidence has shown that SARS-CoV-2 infected
myocardium directly, despite the putative receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 [10], same with
SARS-CoV, as well as the documented reports state that the RNA of SARS-CoV has been
identified within myocardium of affected patients [11]. While confirmation of
SARS-CoV-2-related myocarditis has been hampered by its heterogeneous clinical presentations
and complexity of definitive diagnose, PCR technology have enabled detection of many other
virus within the myocardium of affected patients [12]. Hence, whether the virus exerted its
pathogenic effects by transition to myocardium directly is yet to investigated. Apart from that, it’s
likely the host response to infection is major determinants in COVID-19 patients that are
complicated by myocardial injury [13].
It’s estimated that pneumonia can affect the cardiovascular system by multiple mechanisms.
The established pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 accounted for the inciting infection,
results in relative or severe hypoxemic state of the host, prompted by impaired gas exchange
across the alveoli of inflamed lung parenchyma and ventilation-perfusion mismatching. Moreover，
inflammation increase the metabolic needs of peripheral tissues and organs, attributable to
myocardial ischemia, may related either to: increasing heart rate which shortens the diastolic
duration, coronary artery spasm or coronary microvascular dysfunction, without ruptured plaque
within coronary atherosclerosis, therefore compromising coronary perfusion and exaggerating
cardiac metabolic imbalance [7]. The preexistent cardiovascular diseases and COVID-19 appears
to accelerate the progression bidirectional. On the other hand, circulating inflammatory factor and
toxin mediated vasoconstriction adversely affect myocardial function，through which called
cytokine storm. The overall effect of the inﬂammatory response triggered by infection is dictated
by the balance between pro-inﬂammatory (eg, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8) and anti-inﬂammatory (eg,
IL-10,TGF-β) mediators [14]. Sustained or uncontrolled release of cytokines secreted by various
cell populations especially immune cells, inflicting excessive systemic inﬂammation which leads

to multiple organ dysfunction including lung and heart [15]. In this case, we can suggest both viral
and following bacterial infections hijack the defense mechanism of host cells by targeting immune
cell-mediated cytokine signaling and contributes to the cytokine storm.
It’s fully anticipated that respiratory infections and sepsis are associated with artery and venous
thrombosis along with microvascular embolism. Cardiac thrombosis could be generated locally
induced by either exposure to tissue factors following vascular damage，or spontaneously under
procoagulant condition secondary to an exaggerated inﬂammation which stimulated endothelial
and mononuclear cells, eventually provoking the coagulation cascade. In addition to clotting
activation, systemic coagulation abnormalities also involves suppression of fibrinolysis [8, 16, 17].
Dehydration ， elderly, obesity, basic diseases ， long-term bedridden, clinical practice of
glucocorticoid and immunoglobulin，invasive operation multifactorial，as previously summarized，
were the main risk factors of hyperviscosity, which intensified the coagulation disorder. Our data
suggest that the enhanced procoagulant activity was inherent with ACI incidence among
COVID-19 inpatients. Awareness of this information should guide clinical intervention aimed at
pro- coagulation disturbance in high-risk groups.
Limitations
There were several limitations in our study. A substantial proportion of suspected cases was
included and patients without hs-cTnI test was excluded, both of which might resulted in some
bias. Also, our results based on a very small cohort. The data of hs-cTnI test before symptom onset
was unavailable and we could not tell the acute cardiac injury form the chronic cardiac injury.
Electrocardiography and echocardiography was not evaluated in our study. A part of patients were
transferred to other hospital and no definite outcomes could be evaluate. But we used Cox
regression analysis to solve this limitation.
Conclusion
Cardiac injury defined by hs-cTnI elevation and elevated d-dimer on admission were risk
factors for in-hospital death, while higher SpO2 could be seen as a protective factor, which could
help clinicians to identify patients with adverse outcome at the early stage of COVID-19.
