ABSTRACT
Cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 is characterized by hyperinflammation which manifests
as ARDS, multi-organ failure, and high inflammatory parameters. Tocilizumab, an IL-6
antagonist has been used in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with
conflicting results from different parts of the world. We conducted a retrospective descriptive
study from Feb 2020 to May 2020 on COVID-19 patients with ARDS and hyperinflammation
characterized by raised CRP and/or ferritin. A total of 244 patients with COVID-19 were
admitted out of which 107 had ARDS. Thirty patients had both ARDS and hyperinflammation
and received tocilizumab. The mean age was 62.5 years (SD: 13.5) and the majority were male
(83%). The mean CRP pre-treatment was 217.5 mg/L and post 48 to 72 hours of tocilizumab
treatment was 98.5 mg/L. Twenty-one patients (70%) also received concomitant intravenous
methylprednisolone. Of the 30 patients, 7 died and 20 recovered. Ten patients required
intensive care unit admission and nine developed nosocomial infections. COVID-19 associated
aspergillosis was diagnosed in three patients post tocilizumab treatment. Mortality was
significantly higher in patients who developed a nosocomial infection and who required
intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). Our study is the first to describe the treatment
outcomes with tocilizumab from a low-middle income country. The availability and cost of
tocilizumab in our region which makes it imperative to understand its potential for use in our
setting. Our study supports the use of tocilizumab in a select patient population with COVID-19
and recommends monitoring of nosocomial infections and opportunistic infections.

INTRODUCTION

COVID-19 was announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 1 and
since then it has infected 5,113,706 people globally and resulted in 330,361 deaths as of date 2.
The life-threatening manifestation of COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality 3. The underlying pathogenesis of
ARDS involves a dysregulated immune response leading to a cytokine release syndrome (CRS),
referring to an excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. CRS in
COVID-19 is characterized by hyperinflammation which manifests as ARDS, multi-organ failure,
and high inflammatory parameters 4. Key in the development of the CRS is an exaggerated
release of the proinflammatory cytokine Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and elevated IL-6 levels correlate
with ARDS 5. Marked elevation of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (whose expression is propelled by IL6) also serves as a biomarker to assess the severity of clinical CRS 3 and studies have used CRP
and ferritin as surrogate markers of hyperinflammation6,7.
Given the pivotal role of IL-6; it has been postulated that targeting IL-6 with available IL-6
inhibitors like tocilizumab may lead to clinical suppression of the CRS 8. Data from clinical
studies have been conflicting with regards to the efficacy of tocilizumab in COVID-19 ARDS.
While limited studies from China have shown improved outcomes in COVID-19 patients with
hyperinflammation and ARDS 9, a study from Italy did not show significant mortality benefit 10.
While randomized controlled trials are awaited, there is an urgency to explore therapeutic
options that can help to avert ICU admissions, especially given the limited capacity in resourceconstrained settings. Hence, we would like to report our clinical experience of the management
of ARDS and hyperinflammation with the IL-6 inhibitor Tocilizumab which will be the first from
a lower-middle-income country (LMIC).
METHODS
We conducted a retrospective descriptive study on COVID-19 patients with ARDS and
hyperinflammation admitted to the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH); a 700-bedded tertiary
care hospital. Cytokine storm or Hyperinflammation was defined as either a serum CRP ≥100

mg/L or a ferritin ≥900 ng/mLor both6. ARDS was defined as per WHO definition as having
“onset within 1 week of a known clinical insult or new or worsening respiratory symptoms,
chest imaging (radiograph, CT scan, or lung ultrasound) with bilateral opacities, not fully
explained by volume overload, lobar or lung collapse, or nodules and respiratory failure not
fully explained by cardiac and PaO2/Fio2 <300mmHg”11. Patients were excluded if they had
transaminitis (ALT of greater than 3 times upper normal limit) and/or ongoing bacterial
infection or tuberculosis. Demographics and clinical data from the hospital medical records
were collected using a structured proforma. The outcomes assessed included in-hospital
mortality, length of stay, and development of nosocomial infection during hospitalization. The
study was submitted for ethical approval to the AKUH ethical review committee and received
exemption (ERC reference number: 2020-3650-10382). The data was anonymized, and no
personal identifiers were recorded.
Categorical variables such as gender, development of nosocomial infection were described as
proportions, and continuous variables like age and length of hospital stay were described using
mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR) values. Proportions for categorical variables as
mentioned above were compared using the χ2 test or Fisher exact test where appropriate.
Statistical analysis was performed using STATA ver 12. A p-value of less than .05 was considered
statistically significant.
RESULTS
A total of 244 patients of COVID-19 were admitted from Feb 26 th to May 15th 2020, out of which
107 met WHO criteria for ARDS. Of these, 30 patients with ARDS who also met the criteria for
hyperinflammation and qualified to receive tocilizumab. The clinical characteristics and
outcomes of these 30 patients are summarized in Table 1. The mean age was 62.5 years (SD:
13.5) and the majority were male (83%). None of the patients had a rheumatological illness.
The median dose of tocilizumab was 600mg (Range: 320 – 680 mg). No adverse effects were
observed during or post-infusion. Twenty-one patients (70%) also received concomitant
systemic steroids (intravenous methylprednisolone). Of the 30 patients, 7 died and 20
recovered while information was missing on 3 patients who left against medical advice. The

mean length of hospitalization was 12 days (SD: 6.7). The mean CRP pre and post tocilizumab
treatment in those who died compared to those who survived are shown in Figure 1. Ten
patients required ICU admission and intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) whereas
14 patients were managed on Non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Nine patients developed
nosocomial infections, of which 6 of were hospital-acquired pneumonia (three with multi-drug
resistant (MDR) acinetobacter, 2 with MDR Pseudomonas aeroginosa and one with methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Additionally, 7 patients also isolated aspergillus
species from their respiratory specimens out of which 3 patients were diagnosed with COVID19 associated aspergillosis and 4 were considered to be colonized. Mortality was higher in
patients who developed a nosocomial infection (p-value: 0.005) and who required IPPV (pvalue: 0.023).
DISCUSSION
In a recent debriefing, WHO has raised alarm over the numbers of cases that are exponentially
increasing in the lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). It is a major cause of concern
particularly since the capacities of developed countries have been overwhelmed. Since the
development of a vaccine is unlikely in the near future, the focus has been on treatment and
compassionate use of certain medications. Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting the
receptor of IL-6; a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS seen with
COVID-198. Data is urgently needed from developing countries as a “one-size fits all” strategy
cannot be used in resource-constrained regions where healthcare capacities are already
overstretched 12. Moreover, whether tocilizumab is a cost-effective option in developing
countries also requires exploration because of the differences in case fatality rates from the
different parts of the world suggesting that same approaches may not be regionally relevant.
We conducted an observational study describing patient outcomes in those critically ill patients
of COVID-19 who received tocilizumab intravenously for hyperinflammation and ARDS. Most of
the data regarding its off-label use in COVID-19 has been from studies conducted in China and
parts of Europe (Table 2). The age and gender distribution of our patient population were
similar to those reported in studies from China and Italy 10,13. The mortality data has been
conflicting from Italy with Colaneri M et al. reporting no benefit 10 whereas the Sciascia S et al.

showing reduced mortality in those who received treatment with tocilizumab 14. On the other
hand outcomes have been consistently reported to be good in studies from China, at the time
of submission, some had not been peer-reviewed and others did not take into account
concomitant treatments 9,13. Our study has reported a mortality of 23% which is similar to other
studies, but we also report concomitant use of systemic steroids in 70% of the patients which
may have contributed in immunomodulation. None of the studies so far have reported
nosocomial infection or aspergillus infection or colonization. Since IL-6 antagonism can
potentially predispose to worse outcomes in infections, this is an important observation in our
study and can have implications in developing countries where there is a higher incidence of
multi-drug resistant infections.
Our study is limited because of small sample size and single-center design but this is expected
given the availability and cost of tocilizumab in our region which makes it imperative to
understand its potential for use in our setting. All the studies exploring outcomes with
tocilizumab are limited due to their small sample sizes and observational design highlighting the
need for randomized controlled trials. However, given the rapidity of the spread of COVID-19
infection, real-time data is needed particularly from LMICs which are about to see the peak in
the number of cases.
Conclusion
Our study supports the use of tocilizumab in a select patient population with COVID-19 and
recommends monitoring of nosocomial infections and opportunistic infections in COVID-19
patients who receive the medication which may lead to adverse outcomes in these patients.
