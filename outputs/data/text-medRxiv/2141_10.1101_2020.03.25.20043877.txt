Abstract
Background The rapid global spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is unprecedented. The outbreak has quickly spread
to more than 100 countries reporting over 100,000 confirmed cases. Australia reported its first case of COVID-19 on 25th
January 2020 and has since implemented travel restrictions to stop further introduction of the virus.
Methods We analysed daily global COVID-19 data published by the World Health Organisation to investigate the spread of
the virus thus far. To assess the current risk of COVID-19 importation and local spread in Australia we predict international
passenger flows into Australia during 2020.
Findings Our analysis of global data shows that Australia can expect a similar growth rate of reported cases as observed in
France and the United States. We identify travel patterns of Australian citizens/residents and foreign travellers that can inform
the implementation of new and the alteration of existing travel restrictions related to COVID-19.
Interpretation Our findings identify the risk reduction potential of current travel bans, based on the proportion of returning
travellers to Australia that are residents or visitors. The similarity of the exponential growth in the epidemic curve in Australia
to other countries guides forecasts of COVID-19 growth in Australia, and opportunities for drawing lessons from other countries
with more advanced outbreaks.

ported case of COVID-19 was South Korea [7]. Figure 1
shows the number of countries that have reported cases of
COVID-19 since the beginning of the outbreak together with
a timeline of important events. The graph shows that after
an initial growth between 10th January and 1st February
2020 the number of countries reporting cases of COVID-19
remained steady until 24th February. There has since been
a steady increase in the number of reporting countries, with
an average of six additional countries reporting COVID-19
cases each day.
Initially most reported cases outside China showed a
travel history to Wuhan. The first locally acquired case of
COVID-19 was reported on 24th January in Vietnam, suggesting the possibility of human-to-human transmission. It
is now evident that humans can transmit the disease to each
other, mainly through droplets and via surfaces that allow
the virus to survive [8, 9, 10]. As of 25th March, among
the 193 countries, territories and areas that have confirmed
cases of COVID-19, 125 (64.77%) have reported local transmission [11].
In Australia the first imported case was reported on 25th
January 2020 in New South Wales and began showing symp-

Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel
virus that has not previously been observed in humans [1].
Since its introduction into the human population in late
2019, the virus has caused a global outbreak that prompted
the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare a public
health emergency of international concern [2]. On 8th March
2020, the global number of confirmed cases, reported by
more than 100 countries, rose above 100,000 [3]. Three days
later the WHO announced COVID-19 to be a pandemic [4].
Global air travel has likely been one of the major drivers of
the rapid long-distance spread [5].
COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease and was likely introduced
from bats into the human population [6]. The first cluster of cases detected at the end of 2019 has been linked
to a seafood marked in Wuhan, China [6]. On 13th January, Thailand reported the first imported case of COVID19. Two days later a second imported case was detected in
Japan. The third country outside China to report an im∗ Corresponding

toms of the disease on 13th January. In the week following
the first case report, another eleven cases of COVID-19 were
confirmed. Investigations revealed that all twelve individuals acquired the virus in China [12]. During the week ending
8th February, the state of Queensland reported limited local
transmission of the virus [13]. A previously imported case
from China, who was part of a travel group, infected three
group members prior to being isolated. Further transmission was prevented by quarantining the travel group. The
three secondary cases began to show symptoms during the
quarantine period. There is now further evidence of local
transmission inside Australia, with at least 406 cases being
local transmissions [14]. As at 3:00 pm on 25th March 2020,
Australia has reported a total of 2,423 COVID-2019 cases
across all of its states and territories [15].

Methods
Epidemic curves
To illustrate the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in
different countries, we plot the cumulative epidemic curves
by reporting date. In order to compare the growth of cases
across different countries, we align the curves relative to the
date when a country reached 100 reported cases. To test for
exponential growth, we plot the epidemic curves on semilogarithmic axes. That is, if the growth of reported cases
is exponential, the cumulative epidemic curve on a semilogarithmic plot will form a straight line.

Fitting exponential curves
To predict the expected number of reported cases over the
coming days in Australia, we fit an exponential curve to
the observed reported cases by minimizing the sum of the
squared residuals.

In response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases globally and in Australia, the Australian government began to
implement travel restrictions on 1st February, denying entry
to travellers who had stayed or transited through mainland
China in the past 14 days [16]. While Australian citizens,
permanent residents, immediate family members of citizens
and permanent residents, New Zealand citizens residing in
Australia and diplomats are exempt from the restrictions,
they are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days upon
their return. On 1th March the travel restrictions were extended to individuals travelling from Iran. Travellers from
South Korea and Italy were included on 5th March and 11th
March, respectively. On 15th March the Australian government announced that every individual who enters Australia
is required to self-isolate for 14 days, regardless of the country of origin. The travel restrictions were further tightened
on 20th March, with only Australian citizens, permanent
residents and immediate family members being allowed to
enter Australia.

Predicting travel patterns
We predict the number of arrivals into Australia for the
year 2020 based on ten years of historical data (January 2010 - December 2019) using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model, denoted
ARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q)m , where p is the autoregressive order of the non-seasonal part, d is the order of differencing
that is required to remove the trend from the time series, q
is the non-seasonal order of the moving-average model and
m is the number of observations per year. Parameters P , D
and Q are the seasonal counterparts of p, d and q. The autoregressive part of the model uses a linear combination of
previous values of the time-series. That is, the autoregressive order p indicates the number of previous values considered in the prediction. Table 1 lists the input parameters of

Results
Growth of reported cases in Australia

the SARIMA models used to predict passenger flows from
different countries.
Before finding the parameters for the SARIMA model,
we transformed the individual time-series using a Box-Cox
transformation to give the data a normal shape [17]. The
transformed time-series was tested whether it is stationary
using the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test [18]. To
find the model with the best fit we perform a step-wise
search over the model space [19] and chose the model with
the lowest AIC (Akaike’s Information Criterion). We considered the following parameter ranges: p ∈ [0, 5], d ∈ [0, 2], q ∈
[0, 5], P ∈ [0, 2], Q ∈ [0, 2]. All calculations have been carried out with Python’s pmdarima statistical library.

The data published by the WHO shows that the time between the first reported case in a country and the number of
cases in that country rising above 20 is on average 11 days.
An epidemic is unlikely to fade out without intervention
after 20 individuals have been infected and will begin to follow an exponential growth [20]. In Figure 2 we have overlaid
the epidemic curves of Australia and the nine countries that
have reported the highest number of cases. For comparison,
each epidemic curve is plotted from the time the reported
number of cases rose above 100 on semi-logarithmic axes.
The epidemic curves of the European countries, the United
States and Australia closely follow straight lines, suggesting
exponential growth rates. The Chinese, Iranian and South
Korean curves show an initial exponential growth, for approximately seven days, before the reported number of cases
increases less rapidly.
Australia’s cumulative epidemic curve follows that of Germany most closely. Given this observation and the fact that
the reported number of COVID-19 cases in Australia has
risen well above 20, the risk of a continuing exponential increase in the number of cases is substantial.
Figure 3 shows the cumulative number of reported cases
in Australia through to 25th March 2020 (left panel). After
29th February the number of reported cases increases linearly on the semi-logarithmic plot, indicating an exponential
increase in cases. The right panel of Figure 3 shows the cumulative number of cases reported in each of the Australian

Australia is one of the few countries that does not have
any land borders and, in addition, has strict border controls
in place. Every individual who enters Australia is required
to fill in a passenger arrival card that records information
about the traveller as well as the location and length of
the overseas stay. The data collected through arrival cards

Based on the observations made in other countries around
the world that have reported a high number of COVID-19
cases, it is expected that numbers in Australia will continue
to rise exponentially. We estimate the number of cases expected to be reported during the next seven days, until 1st
April, by fitting the observed data to an exponential function. Figure 4 shows the cumulative number and predicted
cumulative number of cases together with the 95% confidence interval (shaded area). If the number of COVID-19
cases continues to rise exponentially, in a similar manner as
observed in previous weeks, we predict that by 1st April the
number of reported COVID-19 cases in Australia could be
as high as 11,908.

We predict the number of arrivals into Australia for the
year 2020 based on ten years of historical data (January 2010

moving average (SARIMA) model. Arrivals are divided into
two groups, Australian citizens/residents and visitors. The

number of arriving citizens/residents and visitors, respectively, for the year 2020. The error bars indicate the 95%

Among the countries with the largest number of reported
COVID-19 cases, China and South Korea stand out with
the number of visitors far exceeding the number of returning citizens/residents throughout the year. Australian citizens and residents clearly dominate return travel from Italy
and Spain over the northern hemisphere’s summer. The
same pattern is observed to a lesser extend for arrivals from
France and the United Kingdom. Countries, such as Indonesia and Thailand, have a high ratio of citizens over visitor
among travellers into the country.

Discussion

Australia. We predicted the number of COVID-19 cases in Australia until
1st April (dashed line) by fitting an exponential function to the cases that
have been reported so far (blue circles). The equation of the fitted curve
is y = 9.0822e0.2078x . The shaded area corresponds to the 95% confidence
interval of the predictions.

Our results indicate that without further intervention, Australia can expect a similar growth in the number of reported
cases as observed in Germany. We predict that the number
of cases in Australia could rise from 2,423 to 11,908 within
one week if no intervention takes place.
Our predictions of travel patterns can help policy makers
weigh the COVID-19 risk posed by travellers from different
countries, as well as the potential reduction in this risk by
implementing travel bans and quarantine rules that only apply to foreign travellers. The risk reduction in COVID-19
importations into Australia as a result of travel bans varies
across the different source countries. The risk reduction
when travel bans are applied to countries where traveller
volumes into Australia are dominated by visitors, such as

Travel patterns
Although travel restrictions can be effective in the intervention of infectious disease spread, they are temporary and
difficult to sustain in the long term [21]. In the case of
travel bans being lifted, a rapid increase in the number of
imported cases can be expected.
In 2019, air passengers from New Zealand formed the
largest group (≈ 2, 622, 967) of arrivals into Australia, followed by arrivals from China (≈ 1, 999, 857) and the United

The travel patterns also reveal seasonal trends in traveller
volumes into Australia that vary across countries. Travellers from China, for instance, who are mostly visitors,
peak in February and July, aligning with the start of the
two main semesters in Australian universities. There are
more than 100,000 Chinese students studying at Australian
universities. The three Mediterranean European countries,
Italy, Spain, and France, have clear peaks in incoming travellers to Australia around the northern hemisphere summer, where Australian citizens and travellers return in significantly larger numbers. Some countries where returning
residents dominate incoming travel, such as Japan and Thailand, demonstrate spikes in returning travellers around January, April, July, and October, coinciding with school holidays in Australia. Such seasonal patterns can help authorities plan for travel policies that consider the varying risk
