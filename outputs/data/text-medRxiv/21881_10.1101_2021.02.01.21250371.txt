HCQ for severe COVID-19

ABSTRACT
The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID–19) represents a major public health problem due to
its rapid spread and its ability to generate severe pneumonia. Thus, it is essential to find a
treatment that reduces mortality. Our objective was to estimate whether treatment with 400
mg/day of Hydroxychloroquine for 10 days reduces in-hospital mortality in subjects with severe
respiratory disease due to COVID-19 compared with placebo.
Material and methods: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the
safety and efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of severe disease by COVID-19
through an intention-to-treat analysis. Eligible for the study were adults aged more than 18
years with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and lung injury requiring hospitalization with or
without mechanical ventilation. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes:
days of mechanical ventilation, days of hospitalization and cumulative incidence of serious
adverse events.
Results: A total of 214 patients with COVID-19 were recruited, randomized and analyzed. They
were hypoxemic with a mean SpO2 of 65% ± 20, tachycardic (pulse rate 108±17 min-1) and
tachypneic (32 ±10 min-1); 162 were under mechanical ventilation at randomization. Thirty-day
mortality was similar in both groups (38% in Hydroxychloroquine vs. 41% in placebo, hazard
ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI] 0.51-1.53). In the surviving participants, no
significant difference was found in secondary outcomes.
Conclusion: No beneficial effect or significant harm could be demonstrated in our randomized
controlled trial including 214 patients, using relatively low doses of Hydroxychloroquine
compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.

HCQ for severe COVID-19

Introduction
The outbreak of respiratory infection by the novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) started in
December 2019, in Wuhan (Hubei Province), China

1-5

. From this city, the outbreak has been

spreading to the majority of countries worldwide in a severe pandemic 6. As of July 17, 2020,
more than 13 million infections and half a million deaths have been reported 6.
Several drugs have been prescribed for patients with COVID-19, based on their known
immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory effects, or on their in-vitro antiviral effects 7. Chloroquine
and HydroxyChloroQuine (HCQ) have been in regular use for decades to treat malaria and, more
recently, for the treatment of some rheumatic diseases, with a well-documented benefit/risk profile
at a very low cost.

The majority of published studies on HCQ or chloroquine have been

observational, or relatively small controlled trials. The antiviral Remdesivir shortened time to
recovery in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 compared with placebo but did not demonstrate
improvement in survival 8. In contrast, Dexamethasone at a moderate dose had an important
reduction in mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 9. Several large trials on HCQ have been
recently suspended, such as the RECOVERY trial 10, the World Health Organization SOLIDARITY
trial

11

, and an NIH-funded trial involving HCQ 12, but the full details of the results are unknown,

as there are to our knowledge, no peer-reviewed formal publications to date.
Our aim was to estimate whether 10-day treatment with a relatively low dose of HCQ (200 mg
twice daily), reduces 30-day mortality in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease, a
low-cost treatment unlikely to result in important adverse effects.

HCQ for severe COVID-19

This was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-control clinical trial held
primarily at the Mexican National Institute of Respiratory Diseases Ismael Cosío Villegas
(INER), a referral center for respiratory diseases; and at two additional participating hospitals
belonging to the network of High Specialty Regional Hospitals (Hospitales Regionales de Alta
Especialidad) in Ixtapaluca and Oaxaca, Mexico. All three are public hospitals that mainly treat
uninsured patients and provide free treatment for COVID-19 patients. Centers differed in a)
altitude above sea level, with Ixtapaluca and Mexico City sharing a similar mean altitude
(2,260m and 2,240m respectively), while Oaxaca is at 1,460 m above sea level; and b) although
all three centers were designated as COVID-19 hospitals, only INER was converted into a
COVID-19-only referral center. This report followed the CONSORT guidelines 13 and was
approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees. Consent to participate in the study was signed
either in person or electronically by legal representatives when a participant was unable to sign
due to the initiation of mechanical ventilation. The trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov
(identifier NCT04315896).
Eligible subjects were adults over 18 years of age, with <14 days from symptoms onset, a
confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-PCR (in a pharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab sample or
in a tracheal aspirate/bronchial lavage) that required hospitalization as decided by the attending
physicians. Because all patients had hypoxemia (SaO2 <90% ambient air or PaO2/FIO2 <250 in
Mexico City) and opacities in the chest roentgenogram or the tomography, hospitalization was
usually due to the requirement of respiratory support, either supplementary oxygen or mechanical
ventilation. All diagnostic RT-PCR followed a similar technique (Berlin Protocol) with all
laboratories standardized by the Mexican National Reference Laboratory (INDRE). RT-PCR was
performed in-situ by participating hospitals, except in Oaxaca, where testing was performed at

the state laboratory, implying a 1-2 additional delay in obtaining results and the inability to perform
additional RT-PCR tests on the same patient.
We excluded patients with known previous COVID-19 infection, those previously treated with
HCQ or chloroquine during the last month, pregnant woman, those with a planned transfer to
another hospital unit, or those participating in another COVID-19 trial. We also excluded patients
based on a contraindication to start or continue HCQ including known hypersensitivity to HCQ or
chloroquine, a corrected QT interval (QTc) >0.50 s, severe liver or kidney disease, a history of
pre-existing maculopathy, and to avoid to the extent possible a dangerous prolongation of the
QTc and derived complications 14, those with >11 score points (of a maximum of 21 score points)
on a scale assessing the risk of QTc prolongation in hospitalized patients, including age, gender,
myocardial infarction or heart failure, sepsis, the use of drugs known to prolong the QTc or
diuretics, and hypokalemia

15

. Attending physicians were free to exclude a patient from the

protocol at any time.

Randomization
Eligible patients were randomized centrally, and separately for each participating hospital, utilizing
an online-dedicated software (http://www.randomization.com), and results were employed to label
flasks containing 20 tablets of the experimental drug and the identically appearing and packed
sucrose placebo. Randomization considered two separate groups: (a) patients in critical condition
specifically under invasive mechanical ventilation and with a disease severity grade 7-9 according
to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification 16 with or without renal dialysis or the use
of vasoactive drugs, and (b) those without invasive mechanical ventilation, with WHO
classification disease severity classification of 4-6, all receiving supplementary oxygen therapy.

HCQ for severe COVID-19

Other categories of disease severity in the WHO classification, defined by non-invasive ventilation
and the use of Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), were not utilized in the
participating hospitals, and high-flow oxygen devices were prescribed only in 10 patients.
Subjects entering the experimental group received HCQ orally or by nasogastric tube, 200 mg
every 12 h, for 10 days. Subjects in the placebo group received an identical sucrose-placebo for
10 days.
Blinding: Recruiters, patients, treating physicians, nursing staff, and the rest of the treating team,
along with the follow-up evaluation monitors and the data-entry personnel, were blinded to group
assignment.
Outcomes
The main outcome was the 30-day mortality rate after randomization. Secondary outcomes
included the proportion of patients requiring invasive ventilatory support after admission, duration
in days of invasive mechanical ventilation for patients requiring such a procedure, duration of
hospitalization in survivors, and incidence of severe adverse events leading to treatment
discontinuation, intervention, or death.
Patients were treated according to the protocols of the participating institution under the
responsibility of the attending physician, who could prescribe other drugs intended as a specific
treatment for COVID-19, but not as part of another drug trial. Physicians-in-charge could also
avoid participation in the trial if they considered the patient´s participation to be risky or
inadequate or could cancel participation later in the follow-up. Monitors registered all
interventions, medications for all purposes, or non-drug interventions.
Adverse events were reported regularly to the Institutional Ethics Committees and to the
manufacturer of the drug and placebo (Sanofi-Aventis de México, S.A. de C.V.)

HCQ for severe COVID-19

Procedures:
Each participant had a single capture form filled, with daily updates across the duration of
treatment (10 days), hospital discharge, or death. If the patient was at home by day 30, the
status was evaluated by a telephone call. Treatment adherence was assessed each day by
counting the remaining assigned pills in the flask. In Oaxaca, a daily dose (two pills), were given
daily to the nurse. All medications administered, the results of bacterial cultures, the use of
supplementary oxygen or mechanical ventilation, additional support such as dialysis, vasoactive
drugs, antibiotics, vital status, adverse events, the presence of a prolonged QTc (>0.5 s) from
an ECG, and laboratory results were recorded each day during treatment. RT-PCR in
pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal aspirate, or in tracheal aspirate/bronchial lavage if intubated,
was ordered every 7 days from randomization.

Sample Size
The original design considered, under uncertainty of a pandemic in its initial phases, a total
randomized population of 600 patients (300 per group), based on an estimation of a 50%
reduction in mortality from 15% in the placebo group, with a study power of 80% and a two-tailed
significance alpha of 0.05. An interim analysis was planned, upon completion of one half of the
sample. In mid-July, 2020, the rhythm of recruitment was reduced drastically, due to several
reasons including patient refusal, that of their relatives, or that of their treating physicians,
coinciding with the worldwide suspension of several large trials testing HCQ in which no benefits
of the drug were found 10-12. Thus, it became unfeasible to complete the proposed sample size.

HCQ for severe COVID-19

Statistical analysis: Analysis was performed primarily as an intention-to-treat. We compared the
30-day death Hazard-Ratio (HR) by means of a Cox proportional-hazard model, considering rightcensoring for the surviving patients. Models were fitted crude and adjusted for age, gender, SOFA
score at randomization, and the number of previously diagnosed comorbidities as referred by the
patient or relative (diabetes, HIV, obesity, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, tobacco
smoking, alcoholism, asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, neurological disease,
autoimmune disease, or the use of immunosuppressant’s). Similar models were fit for secondary
endpoints in the survivors including a comparison of days of mechanical ventilation, days of
hospitalization, time to improvement (time to extubation or time to hospital discharge), and a
comparison of severe adverse events including death, but especially cardiac arrhythmia, sudden
death, and QTc prolongation.

Results
From April 8th to July 12th, 2020, 567 patients presenting at the Emergency Room (ER) were
assessed; 211 did not meet inclusion criteria, 11 were included in other trials, and 131 declined
to participate (see flow chart). A total of 214 patients admitted to the participating centers with
clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and RT-PCR positive for SARS-COV-2, accepted to
participate in the trial and were randomized as follows: 158 from INER; 18 from Ixtapaluca; and
38 from Oaxaca, 106 assigned to HCQ, and 108 to placebo (see flow chart). Two patients with a
clinical and radiologic presentation consistent with COVID-19, one for each treatment group were
randomized without RT-PCR confirmation and were finally reported negative for two consecutive
tests. The assigned treatment was suspended, but the patients were followed, and analyzed for
the main outcome. Four additional randomized patients (three in the HCQ group and one in the

placebo group) did not receive the assigned treatment in the hospital ward, and one (in the
placebo group) was randomized but participated in a different trial and treatment administration
in our trial was suspended.
As described in Table 1, the mean age of the studied individuals was 49.6 ± 12 years, and the
majority were males (75%). Comorbidities were present in 66%, obesity in 47%, diabetes in 16%,
high blood pressure in 17%, current tobacco smoking in 11%, and cardiovascular disease in one.
Median duration of symptoms before reaching the hospital was 7 days, and median days from
admission to randomization were 3 days.
All patients, from their first encounter in the ER, were in respiratory failure, with severe hypoxemia
(mean SpO2 by pulse oximeter 65 ± 20%), tachycardia (pulse rate 108 ± 17 beats min-1), and
tachypnea (breathing frequency [BF] 32 ±10 breaths min-1) (See Table 2). At randomization, 162
required invasive mechanical ventilation, 10 were treated with high flow oxygen, and the
remaining patients received supplementary oxygen by nasal prongs (Table 2) with a mean
PaO2/FIO2 of 145 ± 67 in the whole group, 130 ± 54 in those with mechanical ventilation, and 194
± 80 in those with supplementary oxygen, but already with a slower BF (24 ± 5.9 breaths min-1)
and heart rate (85 ± 18 beats min-1) compared with their arrival at the ER. Median SOFA score
was 6 points in those under ventilation and 3 points in non-ventilated patients. (Table 2) Patients
from INER more often required mechanical ventilation at randomization (86%) compared with the
remaining two other participating hospitals (66% in Oaxaca, and none in Ixtapaluca, respectively).

Use of allocated treatment and suspension of treatment (see flow chart).
Seven randomized patients did not receive the allocated treatment, 4 from the HCQ group (one
because a negative RT-PCR was reported twice after randomization, and three due to drug loss

inside the hospital ward) and three in the placebo group (one with two negative RT-PCR reported
after randomization, one due to drug loss in the hospital ward, and one who participated in another
Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). The randomized treatment was received for a mean of 8
days (SD 3) without difference between the two groups (mean number of pills taken from the
bottle 16±6). Randomized groups were well-matched (Tables 1 and 2), but most recruited patients
(76%) required mechanical ventilation at the time of randomization. The HCQ group had more
males (82% vs. 68%, p = 0.02) but a similar SOFA score, PaO2/FIO2, blood pressure and
creatinine upon hospital admission (Table 2). All surviving patients completed the 30-day followup.

Use of other medications.
Use of other medications during the 10-day treatment of HCQ or placebo, was very common:
Clarithromycin was prescribed to 146 (68%) patients, and Azithromycin to 50 (23%) of patients,
prescribed usually as part of the antibiotic coverage of suspected bacterial pneumonia. A
cephalosporin was prescribed to 182 (85%), a carbapenem to 182 (85%), Oseltamivir to 39 (18%),
Lopinavir/Ritonavir to 62 (29%), and anticoagulants to 120 (56%). Tocilizumab was not available
at the hospitals and was prescribed only in five cases.
Systemic corticosteroids were prescribed to 114 subjects, more than 50% of the study population;
the most frequent systemic corticosteroid was Methylprednisolone followed by Dexamethasone
without a difference among the treatment groups. Patients who required mechanical ventilation
were more frequently prescribed a systemic corticosteroid. (Table 3.) Methylprednisolone doses
varied, but on average were 100 ± 72 mg per day; Dexamethasone doses were 5 ± 2 mg per day.

HCQ for severe COVID-19

Outcomes
Among all participating individuals, 39% died: 47% of those requiring mechanical ventilation, and
13% of the remaining participants.

No significant difference in the main outcome, 30-day

mortality, could be identified in treatment groups (38% in HCQ, 41% in placebo, HR 0.89, and
95%CI 0.58-1.38), either in all participants, (Figure 1 and 2) or on separating those with
mechanical ventilation and non-ventilated patients with supplementary oxygen. Figure 2 depicts
the impact of treatment on mortality, according to the level of respiratory support (mechanical
ventilation or supplementary oxygen) and recruitment site. Results are considerably influenced
by the most numerous number of patients being from Mexico City, with most requiring mechanical
ventilation at randomization. The Relative Risk (RR) of death with HCQ was 0.43 (95%CI 0.092.03) in non-ventilated patients, comprising about one quarter of the recruited patients, and was
0.20 in Ixtapaluca (95%CI 0.03-1.39), a site recruiting only 18 patients.
Secondary outcomes were not significantly different between treatment groups: in terms of days
of mechanical ventilation (13.8 ± 12 days in HCQ vs. 14.0 ± 12 days in placebo, HR 0.98, 95% CI
0.64-1.52), days of hospitalization (17.8 ± 11 days in HCQ vs. 18.1 ± 12 days in the placebo
group, HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72-1.43), or time to improvement (14.2 ± 10 days in HCQ vs. 15.2 ± 10
days in the placebo group, HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.75-1.49). (Table 4)

Adverse Events.
No significant difference in severe adverse events, including deaths was observed in the
treatment groups (52% in HCQ, vs. 54% in placebo, HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.65-1.40) (Table 3). Eight
patients had treatment discontinued due to an adverse event (four in each group), and in 20, the
attending physician discontinued treatment (eight in the HCQ group and 12 in the placebo group).

HCQ for severe COVID-19

Qtc prolongation (>0.5 s) was identified in nine subjects and in six, it was reported as a severe
adverse event. Nevertheless, no significant difference was found between the treatment groups.
Increase in serum creatinine levels was one of the most frequently reported adverse events,
without difference between treatment groups: 144 subjects had an increase in serum creatinine
of >1.3 times the upper limit of normal of the clinical laboratory, and in 40 subjects it was reported
as a severe adverse event, with 14 of these patients treated with hemodialysis.
Significant predictors of mortality were the following: (a) requirement of intubation and mechanical
ventilation (HR 4.3, 95%CI 2.0-9.2); (b) masculine gender (HR 1.7, 95% CI 9.96-2.92); (c) age>65
years (HR 1.67, 95% CI 0.91-3.1); (d) number of reported comorbidities (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.22.2); (e) obesity (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.1-2.5); (f) body mass index (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.10);
and (g) SOFA score (HR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3). On including all previous variables in a multivariate
Cox proportional hazard model, the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (HR 3.9,
95%CI 1.8-8.4), male sex (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.02-3.1), body mass index (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.021.12), and number of comorbidities (HR 1.49, 95%CI 1.02-2.2), remained significant predictors of
in-hospital death. In a Cox model including age, sex, number of comorbidities, SOFA score,
mechanical ventilation, and site, two variables considerably increased the risk of death:
mechanical ventilation at randomization (HR 16.4, 95%CI 2.2-121), and recruitment in Ixtapaluca
(HR 12.6 95%CI 1.5-106). Patients from Ixtapaluca comprised a small group (n=18), none
requiring mechanical ventilation at randomization but 4/6 patients who subsequently died required
mechanical ventilation within a short time after randomization.

HCQ for severe COVID-19

During the 30-day follow-up, 94 patients (46%) were reported with a health-related infection, 47
in the placebo group and 45 in the HCQ group, 86/92 patients were on mechanical ventilation,
and the remaining patients were on supplementary oxygen. Sources of bacterial growth in culture
were from airways secretions (20%), from blood (16%), and from urine (54%). The isolated
bacteria were 13% Staphylococcus spp., 26% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4% Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia, 14% Acinetobacter baumanni, 19% Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus
pneumoniae 1%, 9% Candida spp., 5% Enterobacter spp., and, 16% Escherichia coli. No
difference by treatment group was found in the bacteria isolated except in the Acinetobacter
present in 10 individuals of the placebo group and in three of the HCQ group (p = 0.045). (Table
5) The presence of nosocomial infection (any type or respiratory), co-treatment with Azithromycin
or other antibiotics, administration of systemic steroids, hemodialysis, or the requirement of
vasopressors did not increase the risk of death once mechanical ventilation, age, gender, SOFA
score, and comorbidities were taken into account.

Discussion
In a randomized trial compared with placebo, HCQ did not significantly reduce the 30-day
mortality of an especially severe and hypoxemic group of patients with COVID-19. Secondary
outcomes also failed to be improved by HCQ, but importantly severe toxicity was not observed to
a greater degree in treated patients, despite the concomitant use of other drugs, including
Azithromycin. Azithromycin was commonly prescribed as part of an empiric antibiotic for
pneumonia, but also, especially at the beginning of the pandemic in Mexico, as an attempt to
modify the natural course of the COVID-19.

HCQ for severe COVID-19

Risk factors for death in our group included age, masculine gender, SOFA score, body mass
index, and the need for mechanical ventilation, the latter found to be the most significant. Mortality
of the studied population was very high compared with severe patients at our own hospitals prior
to COVID-19, but the majority of our patients were in respiratory failure with mechanical
ventilation, arriving with severe hypoxemia (mean SpO2 63%), requiring vasopressor support, and
after several days of symptoms (7 days on average).
All three hospitals participating in the trial possessed important surge-capacity preparations for
COVID-19. Since the epidemic developed in China, all three hospitals aimed at preparing a larger
number of beds with access to mechanical ventilation, finally reaching around three times the
original number of beds available. The National Institute of Respiratory Diseases has a total of
178 beds in seven wards devoted to respiratory diseases, and 30 beds with a ventilator in the
Intensive Care Unit, and in the ER. The Institute was transformed into a hospital with >100 beds
with access to mechanical ventilation distributed in all wards. However, trained personnel for that
number of intensive care beds was scarce, and scarcity increased because of COVID-19
infections among the personnel, and especially after a presidential decree that sent home all
workers more than 65 years of age or with comorbidities.
Even though new personnel was hired, the majority were recently graduated physicians, nurses,
and allied health personnel with little experience with critical patients. With the preparation of the
hospital, the capacity of the mechanical ventilation services was not overwhelmed as occurred in
other countries before. Instead, limitations derived from insufficient personnel with proper training
in intensive care, and the occasional scarcity of medicines, and Personal Protection Equipment.
The frequency of nosocomial infection was high, although in Cox proportional hazard models the

presence of these nosocomial infections did not increase mortality once mechanical ventilation
was taken into account.
Although this was a trial with proper randomization and blinding, demonstrated by the comparison
of baseline characteristics of the treatment arms, reducing the possibility of biases due to known
or unknown variables, the trial ended short of the planned sample size. Increasing the number of
recruited patients proved very difficult with a growing number of refusals by patients, relatives,
and treating physicians once the large trials, including RECOVERY, SOLIDARITY, and that
supported by NIH, suspended their treatment arms with HCQ due to a lack of beneficial effect,
although no harm from HCQ was reported. Information of these suspended trials traveled by
newspapers and media

17,

and reached the widespread population with a great impact, even

before a proper peer-reviewed publication was available and analyzed, because of the
considerable prestige and importance of the institutions responsible for the trials. It is
understandable that in the middle of a pandemic, a rapid presentation of results of large, proper
clinical trials may help to select the best treatments to improve patients or avoid drugs lacking
benefit or generating harm but, on the other hand, it lead to the premature termination of several
trials.
As a consequence, the sample size recruited is small and unfortunately, it is possible to miss
relevant beneficial or harmful effects. Even though the best estimate of the impact of HCQ on
mortality was 0.88, the confidence interval was from 0.51, implying a reduction of mortality to one
half of that observed in the placebo group, to 1.53, a 50% increase in mortality compared with the
placebo group. Sample size (214) had only a 80% study power to detect a relative risk of dying
of 0.57 (from 41% in the control group to 23% in the HCQ group) or an RR of 1.46 (from 41% in
the control group to 60% in the HCQ group) in the case of HCQ being harmful. Notwithstanding

HCQ for severe COVID-19

this, it can be argued that once the information of large trials showed no benefit for hospitalized
patients but also no clear harm, both possibilities are unlikely. For a possible participant interested
in our trial and other similar trials, once a relevant benefit in large Randomized Controlled Trials
(RCT) was ruled out with reasonable certainty, the balance shifted towards risks and side effects
and it became questionable to continue the trial. Dozens of trials including HCQ as treatment
were registered in Clinical Trials, and it is likely that several are going to end up short, as ours
did. Nonetheless, and fortunately, information can be compiled later in meta-analyses and
systematic analyses.
We and others could demonstrate that HCQ side effects can be minimized with proper follow-up
keeping track of the QTc segment and utilizing instruments such as the multivariable Tisdale´s
scale score

15

to predict individuals at higher risk of QTc prolongation and its complications,

combined with a relatively low dose of HCQ, safe even for prolonged periods for the majority of
patients, and lacking a loading dose. Our population was using different types of medications
including Azithromycin, several antibiotics, systemic corticosteroids, and Lopinavir/Ritonavir, in
an attempt to improve survival, the majority of the time before any drug demonstrated
improvement of patients with COVID-19.

Conclusions
In summary, no beneficial effect or significant harm could be demonstrated in our randomized
controlled trial including 214 patients, using relatively low doses of HCQ compared with placebo
in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. However, the study was stopped early and likely
was underpowered for finding a statistically and clinically important difference in the primary
outcome.
