Abstract
Diagnosis and surveillance of emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 depend on nucleic acid
isolation from clinical and environmental samples. Under normal circumstances, samples would
be processed using commercial proprietary reagents in Biosafety 2 (BSL-2) or higher facilities. A
pandemic at the scale of COVID-19 has caused a global shortage of proprietary reagents and
BSL-2 laboratories to safely perform testing. Therefore, alternative solutions are urgently
needed to address these challenges. We developed an open-source method called Magneticnanoparticle-Aided Viral RNA Isolation of Contagious Samples (MAVRICS) that is built upon
reagents that are either readily available or can be synthesized in any molecular biology
laboratory with basic equipment. Unlike conventional methods, MAVRICS works directly in
samples inactivated in acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (e.g., TRIzol), thus
allowing infectious samples to be handled safely without biocontainment facilities. Using 36
COVID-19 patient samples, 2 wastewater samples and 1 human pathogens control sample, we
showed that MAVRICS rivals commercial kits in validated diagnostic tests of SARS-CoV-2,
influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. MAVRICS is scalable and thus could become an
enabling technology for widespread community testing and wastewater monitoring in the
current and future pandemics.

Introduction
Testing for COVID-19 is vital for monitoring and mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and for
safely restarting the normal economy. To date, molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 predominantly
relies on detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (rRT-PCR) assays, such as those approved by the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (US CDC)(1). As SARS-CoV-2 spreads globally, it also accumulates approximately 1 to
2 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the 29,903 bp genome per month(2). The emergence of
new strains could have serious implications in the efficacy of diagnostic tests and success of
vaccines. For example, 87 of 2816 genomes sampled between Jan and May 2020 have the
T28688C SNV (GISAID, https://nextstrain.org/) that alters the sequence of the binding site of
the forward primer of the CDC N3 rRT-PCR assay(1), potentially compromising its effectiveness.
Thus, continued surveillance of the evolution and geographic distribution of viral strains by
high-throughput sequencing (3,4) is another pillar of public health measures to combat COVID19.

Both rRT-PCR testing and high-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 require RNA extraction
from nasopharyngeal swab samples. In the clinic, swabs are collected in viral transport media
(VTM) and, if necessary, transported following specific cold-chain biological substances
transport guidelines(1) for RNA extraction. The US CDC recommends several commercially
available RNA extraction kits(1). Fully automated diagnostic systems (e.g., Roche cobasÂ® 6800
and 8800) that perform all steps from RNA extraction to rRT-PCR without human intervention

are also popular among diagnostic laboratories. Commercial kits and procedures typically yield
consistent quality RNA and are easy to use, but come with a high price tag. Moreover, the
availability of commercial proprietary reagents is seriously affected by the disruption of the
global supply chain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The high cost and low availability of
proprietary reagents impose a bottleneck on testing capacities in rich and poor countries alike.
Additionally, monitoring pathogens in wastewater is an important public health measure, and it
requires methods that satisfy the biosafety requirements of handling unknown infectious
agents and can overcome the low virus concentration and PCR inhibitors that are ubiquitous in
wastewater. Therefore, there is great incentive to develop alternative methods that only
require locally available and inexpensive chemicals, are simple to perform, and rival the
performance of commercial kits. Besides alleviating supply shortage, the alternative methods
should ideally eliminate the risk of handling live viruses, thus lowering the strict biosafety and
biosecurity requirements(5) on testing facilities. Any self-build RNA extraction method that
satisfies the above-mentioned criteria can help increase testing capacity not only in clinical
laboratories but also in rural healthcare facilities, university laboratories and field testing sites.
RNA isolation by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction (AGPC)(6) (sold as
TRIzol by Invitrogen or TRI Reagent by Sigma-Aldrich) has been successfully used in life sciences
laboratories around the world for nearly four decades. It requires widely available chemicals at
a low cost. The AGPC methods has been found to match the performance of commercial kits
and automated systems in SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR detection(7,8). In these studies, swabs were
first collected in VTM or cell culture media, which were then used in AGPC RNA isolation. This
workflow necessitates handling of live viruses and requires Biosafety Level 2 (BSL2) facilities.

We hypothesized that it should be possible to collect swabs directly in AGPC, which achieve two
goals: 1) completely inactivation of any infectious agent by AGPC so that the downstream
procedures (e.g., transportation, RNA isolation, rRT-PCR, and sequencing) can be carried
without BSL2 requirements, and 2) preservation of RNA integrity by denaturing nucleases.

However, the AGPC method as is commonly practiced has several drawbacks that make it
unsuitable for high-volume testing. It requires extensive manual pipetting of hazardous
chemicals and multiple centrifugation steps, which increase the risk of human errors and
personnel injury especially when the sample number is large. Solid-phase reversible
immobilization (SPRI) of nucleic acid on magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) offers a simple and
elegant alternative to centrifuge- or column-based methods(9). Nucleic acid (e.g. RNA)
reversibly binds to functionalized MNPs under dehydrating conditions and can be separated
from contaminants in solution by a strong magnet. This allows fast and thorough washes to
eliminate inhibitors of downstream molecular biology reactions and yields high quality RNA for
PCR and high-throughput sequencing. Because it requires no centrifugation and only low-cost
materials, the MNP-based RNA extraction is inherently scalable and amenable to automation.
Although the combination of the AGPC and SPRI technologies would be obviously advantageous
in consideration of reagent availability, cost, biosafety and ease-of-use, development of AGPC
compatible MNP-based RNA extraction protocols has been limited.

Here we developed the Magnetic-nanoparticle-Aided Viral RNA Isolation of Contagious Samples
(MAVRICS) workflow (Fig. 1A). MAVRICS only requires widely available and low-cost materials
and can be self-assembled in a basic laboratory setting. It is compatible with AGPC inactivated
samples to alleviate the shortage of commercial kits, lower biosafety risks, and enable sample
and scalable sample preparation. MAVRICS performed on par or better than commercial RNA
extraction kits in rRT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial
virus in various clinical and environmental samples.
Material & Methods
Clinical samples
Contrived SARS-CoV-2 saliva samples were prepared by mixing 1000 Î¼l of TRIzol, 100 Î¼l of saliva
from a health volunteer, and 5 Î¼l of in vitro transcribed SARS-CoV-2 N gene RNA (nt28,28729,230 in NC_045512.2, 108 copies/ul). Anonymized RNA samples were obtained from Ministry
of Health (MOH) hospitals in the western region in Saudi Arabia. The use of clinical samples in
this study is approved by the institutional review board (IRB# H-02-K-076-0320-279) of MOH
and KAUST Institutional Biosafety and Bioethics Committee (IBEC). Oropharyngeal and
nasopharyngeal swabs were carried out by physicians and samples were steeped in 1 mL of
TRIzol (Invitrogen Cat. No 15596018) to inactivate virus during transportation. The Respiratory
(21 targets) control panel (Microbiologics Cat. No 8217) was used as controls in rRT-PCR assays.

Wastewater samples and virus concentration
One liter of raw sewage is individually sampled at 9 AM and 4 PM on 7 June 2020 from the
equalization tank of wastewater treatment plant operated within KAUST. The sewage from
both time-points are then mixed together to constitute a composite sample. A 300-500 ml of
raw sewage was concentrated by using an electronegative membrane in the present of cation
which has been described previously (Reference 14). Briefly, 2.5 M MgCl2 was added to the

water samples to obtain a final concentration of 25 mM. The samples were subsequently
passed through the electronegative filter (cat. no. HAWP-090-00; Merck Millipore, Billerica,
MA) attached to a glass filter holder (Merck Millipore, Cat no. XX1009020). Magnesium ions
were removed by passing 200 mL of 0.5 mM H2SO4 (pH 3.0) through the filter, and the viruses
were eluted with 10 mL of 1.0 mM NaOH (pH 10.8). The eluate was recovered in a tube
containing 50 Î¼L of 100 mM H2SO4 (pH 1.0) and 100 Î¼L of 100Ã TrisâEDTA buffer (pH 8.0) for
neutralization. The samples were further concentrated using a Centripep YM-50 (Merck
Millipore) to obtain a final volume of 600â700 Î¼L.

Magnetic nanoparticle synthesis, silica coating and RNA extraction protocol
Core magnetic nanoparticle synthesis and silica coating of MNPs were done following published
protocols (Protocols 1.1 and 2.1 in reference 12). Bis-Tris and Tris binding buffer (Bis-Tris buffer
and Tris buffer): To prepare 50 ml of binding buffer dissolve 14.33 g of Gu-HCl (3 M final
concentration) and 104.6 mg of Bis-Tris or 60.5 mg of Tris Base (10 mM final concentration) in
45 ml of Ethanol 100%. Adjust pH with HCl (pH < 6.5) and adjust the volume with water to 50
ml. Bis-Tris or Tris binding buffer (200 Âµl) and SiMNP (40 Î¼l) were added to samples (200 Âµl),
and shake for 5 min at 1300 rpm. The tubes were settled on a magnetic stand and the cleared
supernatant was removed. Then, TRIzol reagent (200 Âµl) and binding buffer (200 Âµl) were added
and the tubes were vortexed and settled on a magnetic stand and the cleared supernatant was
removed. 90% Ethanol (400 Âµl) was added and the tubes were vortexed and settled on a
magnetic stand. The supernatant was then removed. Ethanol washing was repeat three more
times for a total of four washes. The beads were dried on a heat block at 50 Â°C for ~20 min. To
elute the RNA 40 Î¼l of nuclease-free water was added and mixed at 1300 rpm at RT for 5 min.
Finally, the tube was settled on a magnetic stand and the eluted RNA transferred to a new tube.
A detailed supplementary protocol 1 can be found in online supplementary materials. A stepby-step protocol is also available at url: https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bik4kcyw.

Total RNA extraction of the samples was performed following instructions as described in the
CDC EUA-approved protocol using the Direct-Zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research Cat. No
R2070) or TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Cat. No 15596026) following the manufacturersâ
instructions. RNA extraction with RNAClean XP beads was done following manufacturer
instruction. Viral RNA were extracted from the concentrated raw sewage by using QIAamp viral
RNA mini kit (Qiagen, cat no: 52906) following manufacture instruction. A 140 Î¼L of
concentrated raw sewage was used to obtain a final elution of 80 Î¼L. The RNA was stored in â
20 Â°C freezer until further use.

Reverse transcription
Reverse transcription of RNA samples was done using either NEB ProtoScript II reverse
transcriptase (NEB Cat. No M0368) or Invitrogen SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Cat. No 18090010), following protocols provided by the manufacturers. After
reverse transcription, 5 units of thermostable RNase H (New England Biolabs Cat. No M0523S)
was added to the reaction, which was incubated at 37 ËC for 20 min to remove RNA. The final
reaction was diluted 10-fold to be used as templates in RPA. All of the web-lab experiments in
this study were conducted in a horizontal flow clean bench to prevent contaminations. The
bench was decontaminated with 70% ethanol, DNAZap (Invitrogen, Cat no. AM9890) and RNase
AWAY (Invitrogen, Cat no. 10328011) before and after use. The filtered pipette tips (Eppendorf
epT.I.P.S.Â® LoRetention series) and centrifuge tubes (Eppendorf DNA LoBind Tubes, Cat. No
0030108051) used in this study were PCR-clean grade. All of the operations were performed
carefully following standard laboratory operating procedures.

Real-time PCR
Real-time PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 were purchased from IDT (Cat. No 10006770). Real-time
PCR analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences were analyzed on a CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR
Detection System (Biorad) using the following program: 50Â°C for 2 min, 95Â°C for 2 min followed

by 45 cycles of 95Â°C for 5 sec and 59Â°C for 30 sec. Real-time PCR assays for Influenza A, B/RSV
were purchase from IDT (Cat. No 1079729 ) and used per the manufacturerâs recommendation.
For Influenza and RSV assays, the following program was used: 50Â°C for 2 min, 55Â°C for 120 sec,
60Â°C for 360 sec, 65Â°C for 240 sec, followed by 5 cycles 95Â°C for 5 sec and 55Â°C for 30 sec, and
then 45 cycles of 91Â°C for 5 sec and 58Â°C for 25 sec. MNV and PMMoV real-time PCR assay was
conducted using the primer and probes which described previously(10,11).

Results
Silica- but not carboxyl-coated magnetic nanoparticles can isolate RNA directly from AGPC
inactivated samples
MNPs can be functionalized with either a carboxyl or silica coating to bind nucleic acids(12).
Carboxylated MNPs (cMNPs) are available commercially (e.g., RNAClean XP from Beckman
Coulter) and widely used in molecular biology workflows such as PCR cleanup and sequencing
library preparation. Unfortunately, cMNPs (in the form of RNAClean XP) failed to recover
detectable RNA from AGPC solutions (in the form of TRIzol) spiked with high quality total RNA
from human cells, while the conventional AGPC method based on organic phase separation and
centrifugation recovered ~45% of input RNA. On the other hand, cMNPs were capable of 8496% recovery when the same RNA was spiked in water, suggesting that AGPC interferes with
RNA binding onto cMNPs. Silica magnetic nanoparticles (SiMNP) have been used to extract total
nucleic acid from samples lysed and inactivated in AGPC without centrifugation and phase
separation(12). Since commercial SiMNPs are expensive and difficult to procure during the
COVID-19 crisis, we synthesized SiMNP from scratch using a published open-source
protocol(12). The synthesis took ~14 hours with 3 hours hands-on time and required only base

chemicals, a strong magnet, and standard lab equipment (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. 1A-D). In
our case, all materials were locally available (Table 1). One synthesis yielded enough SiMNPs for
5,000-10,000 extractions, and the material cost was miniscule. Another benefit of SiMNP is its
chemical inertness. Our SiMNPs have been stored at room temperature for 6 weeks at the time
of writing without noticeable change in performance.

We first tested if SiMNPs could isolate RNA from contrived SARS-CoV-2 saliva samples (see
methods) inactivated in AGPC (in the form of TRIzol). As previously reported, SiMNPs were able
to isolate RNA directly from TRIzol using the total nucleic acid extraction protocol (hereafter
referred to as TNA protocol) described in(12). We used the US CDC 2019-nCoV_N3 rRT-PCR
assay to quantitate the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. SiMNPs coupled with the TNA
protocol resulted an increase of 3.1 in Ct value compared to the official TRIzol Reagent
protocol, which means a 11.1% yield of viral RNA relative to the AGPC method (Fig. 1B-C). In
contrast, RNA received by the cMNP (RNAClean XP) methods was negligible (Fig. 1B-C).
Interestingly, the yield of SiMNPs improved when the sample in TRIzol was first phase
separated by chloroform and the aqueous phase was used in combination with an enzymatic
reaction cleanup protocol described in(12)(cleanup CHCl3 protocol, Fig. 1B-C). However, this
modification defeated the purpose of using SiMNPs to simplify the workflow. Together, these
results showed that SiMNPs could isolate viral RNA directly from AGPC inactivated samples, but
existing SiMNP protocols significantly underperformed compared to the AGPC method, thus
reducing the sensitivity of diagnostic tests.

Development of a SiMNP-based protocol to maximize viral RNA recovery
Next, we aimed to develop an efficient SiMNP-based RNA extraction protocol using the
contrived SARS-CoV-2 samples and US CDC 2019-nCoV_N1 and N3 rRT-PCR assays. Increasing
the amount of SiMNPs 2.5 times significantly improved the recovery of both the TNA and
cleanup CHCl3 protocols. We also noticed an improvement by washing the SiMNPs once with
TRIzol and RNA binding buffer (1:1), presumably further removing RNases. Nonetheless, none
of these protocols could better the TRIzol Reagent protocol (Fig. 2A-B, Supplementary Fig. 2BC). Since the cleanup CHCl3 protocol had consistently outperformed the TNA protocol, we
suspected that the RNA binding buffer(12) in the TNA protocol might not be optimal. Indeed,
after adding buffering agents (Tris-HCl or Bis-Tris, pH6.5) to the RNA binding buffer and
increasing its guanidinium chloride concentration to 3M, the yield of RNA doubled (Fig. 2A-B,
Supplementary Fig. 2B-C).

We combined the modifications, i.e., the additional wash step and new binding buffers, that
improved the recovery of viral RNA by SiMNPs and showed that they outperformed the TRIzol
Reagent protocol as judged by both the N1 and N3 rRT-PCR assays (TNA 2X Bis-Tris or Tris, Fig.
2C-D). The number of SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecules captured by the SiMNP-TNA 2X Bis-Tris or
SiMNP-TNA 2X Tris protocol was estimated by the standard curve method to be very close to
the input value (Fig. 2E). Similar results were obtained using an independent synthesis of
SiMNPs, proving the robustness of the protocols (Supplementary Fig. 2E-G). Because of the
high recovery of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, we name the method (SiMNP coupled to the TNA 2X

Bis-Tris protocol) Magnetic-nanoparticle-Aided Viral RNA Isolation of Contagious Samples
(MAVRICS).

Comparing performance of MAVRICS and commercial RNA extraction kits in SARS-CoV-2 rRTPCR diagnostic panel using clinical samples
We next compared MAVRICS with commercial kits using real-world COVID-19 swab samples
obtained in hospitals in the Western Region of Saudi Arabia. These swabs were directly
inactivated in TRIzol at the time of collection. Equal aliquots of twelve COVID-19 samples lysed
in TRIzol (S659-S670) were extracted using the MAVRICS and TRIzol Reagent protocol
respectively. The Ct values obtained by both methods were highly concordant (correlation
coefficient=0.96, Fig. 3A). MAVRICS on average provided a reduction in Ct value (0.54Â±0.41, Fig.
3B). We further used these and additional 24 samples to compare MAVRICS with the DIRECT-zol
RNA kit, which is a proprietary column-based method for RNA purification from TRIzol or similar
AGPC reagents. The correlation coefficient between the Ct value of MAVRICS and DIRECT-zol
was 0.22 and 0.13, for the US CDC 2019-nCoV_N1 and N2 rRT-PCR assays, respectively (Fig. 3C,
Supplementary Fig. 3A). Again, MAVRICS on average provided a reduction in Ct value for both
N1 and N2 assays (N1: -0.98Â±0.92, N2: -0.31Â±1.0, Fig. 3D, Supplementary Fig. 3B). The virus
load in the 36 samples were estimated to range between 6.84x103 and 7.52x107 copies/ml
(Supplementary Fig. 3C).

MAVRICS is compatible with detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses in wastewater samples

Since the first reports of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in stool (13,14), the presence of the virus has
been confirmed in municipal wastewater, sometimes even before the first confirmed cases in
the community (15). This suggests that wastewater surveillance could be effective for
monitoring the total COVID-19 case load (including asymptomatic cases) in the population.
Detecting pathogens by rRT-PCR in wastewater requires methods that satisfy the biosafety
requirements of handling unknown infectious agents and can overcome the low virus
concentration and PCR inhibitors that are ubiquitous in wastewater. MAVRICS could be a safe
and easy-to-implement workflow to extract viral RNA in wastewater. We first tested the
recovery of known quantities of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and intact murine noroviruses (MNVs) spiked
in wastewater concentrate, in which viral particles in 250 ml raw sewage were concentrated on
electronegative membranes followed by ultrafiltration with Centripep YM-50 to a final volume
of 700 ul (16). The wastewater concentrate was first inactivated by 10X volume of TRIzol and
extracted using MAVRICS. The result showed an 88% recovery of the input SARS-CoV-2 RNA
(Fig. 4A). The amount of norovirus RNA captured by the SiMNPs was almost identical to that by
the conventional Qiagen RNA purification kit (Fig. 4B).

We further simplified the preparation of wastewater by using TRIzol to inactivate and lyse the
sewage biomass (including viral particles) immobilized on the electronegative membranes,
followed by RNA extraction by MAVRICS. Again, the spike-in SARS-CoV-2 was efficiently
recovered (Fig. 4C), and the amount of pepper mild mottle virus (PPMoV, ubiquitous in
wastewater) captured by the SiMNPs was almost identical to that by the conventional QIAamp
viral RNA mini kit (Fig. 4D).

MAVRICS is compatible with detection of influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus
Lastly, we validated the MAVRICS method for detection of other human pathogenic viruses
than SARS-CoV-2. A commercial human respiratory pathogens control panel that contains
influenza A and B viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was lysed in TRIzol and used for
RNA extraction by MAVRICS. We then used a clinical diagnostic rRT-PCR panel to quantitate the
viruses. Interestingly, influenza A, influenza B and RSV were readily detectable in samples
extracted using SiMNPs, but the Ct value of the same pathogens lagged by 4.08, 6.03 and 5.57,
respectively, for samples extracted using the TRIzol Reagent protocol (Fig. 4E). No virus was
detected in blank controls extracted either by SiMNPs or TRIzol (Fig. 4E).

Discussion
We described an SiMNP-based RNA extraction workflow, MAVRICS, that is compatible with
pathogen detection in clinical and environmental samples. All reagents used in MAVRICS are
either readily available or can be synthesized in any molecular biology laboratory with basic
equipment. The longest preparation step is the synthesis and silica coating of MNPs, which can
be done overnight with ~ 3-hour hands-on time. The material cost for one synthesis is
inconsequential yet can support thousands of RNA extractions. Because MAVRICS works for
samples inactivated and preserved in AGPC (e.g., TRIzol), it allows potentially infectious samples
to be handled safely without special biocontainment facilities. Importantly, MAVRICS matches,
and exceeds in many cases, the performance of commercial proprietary reagents using

established molecular diagnostic tests of SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and RSV. These tests
entail molecular biology reactions that require high quality input RNA. This suggests that the
RNA produced by MAVRICS is free of contaminants and maintains good integrity. It will be of
interest to study if MAVRICS is compatible with other molecular biology techniques, such as
next-generation sequencing (NGS), in the future. Since NGS library preparation uses similar
reactions, including reverse transcription and PCR, one would expect the answer is affirmative.
We noticed that the correlation between SiMNP and DIRECT-zol was lower than that between
SiMNP and TRIzol (compare Fig. 3A and 3C). In the case of SiMNP vs. TRIzol, each sample was
divided equally between SiMNP and TRIzol protocols and processed in parallel. On the other
hand, the samples used in the SiMNP and DIRECT-zol comparison was extracted at different
times. This was due to clinical reasons. Priority was given to extract enough RNA for NGS using
the DIRECT-zol kits. As a results, samples were not equally divided between the SiMNP and
DIRECT-zol extractions, and the swab might be present in one but not the other extraction
method. These reasons could contributed to the lower correlation between the two methods.
Nonetheless, evidence from 36 clinical samples, 2 wastewater samples and 1 pathogens control
sample showed that MAVRICS ravels performance of commercial reagents.

We noticed an interesting lack of correlation between the amount of total RNA and viral RNA
(Supplementary Fig. 2A-C, 2D-G, Supplementary Fig. 3D vs. Fig. 3A-B). For example, RNA
concentration of S667 was below the detection range of Qubit fluorometer, and yet the copy
number of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than S659, which had the one of the highest RNA

concentration (Supplementary Fig. 3B-C). SiMNP tends to have lower total RNA yield, but has
lower Ct values when compared to other methods (Supplementary Fig. 3C). There could be at
least two possibilities. First, SiMNPs may favor binding of RNA similar to the viral RNA. This
could be due to the surface chemistry or high surface area to mass ratio of nanoparticles.
Second, SiMNPs may be more efficient in removing contaminants that inhibit reverse
transcription and PCR. The exact reasons for this phenomenon need to be further studied.

In summary, we developed MAVRICS to enable safe, economical and effective extraction of
RNA from clinical and environmental samples. The performance of MAVRICS rivals commercial
RNA extraction kits in validated diagnostic tests of SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses and
respiratory syncytial virus. MAVRICS has the potential to become an enabling technology for
widespread community testing and wastewater monitoring in the current and future
pandemics.
