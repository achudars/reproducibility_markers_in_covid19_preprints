Abstract

55
56

SARS-CoV-2, the pandemic coronavirus that causes COVID-19, has infected millions worldwide,

57

causing unparalleled social and economic disruptions. COVID-19 results in higher pathogenicity and

58

mortality in the elderly compared to children. Examining baseline SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive

59

coronavirus immunological responses, induced by circulating human coronaviruses, is critical to

60

understand such divergent clinical outcomes. The cross-reactivity of coronavirus antibody responses

61

of healthy children (n=89), adults (n=98), elderly (n=57), and COVID-19 patients (n=19) were

62

analysed by systems serology. While moderate levels of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and

63

IgA were detected in healthy individuals, we identified serological signatures associated with SARS-

64

CoV-2 antigen-specific Fcγ receptor binding, which accurately distinguished COVID-19 patients

65

from healthy individuals and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 induces qualitative changes to antibody Fc

66

upon infection, enhancing Fcγ receptor engagement. Vastly different serological signatures were

67

observed between healthy children and elderly, with markedly higher cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2

68

IgA and IgG observed in elderly, whereas children displayed elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgM, including

69

receptor binding domain-specific IgM with higher avidity. These results suggest that less-experienced

70

humoral immunity associated with higher IgM, as observed in children, may have the potential to

71

induce more potent antibodies upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. These key insights will inform COVID-

72

19 vaccination strategies, improved serological diagnostics and therapeutics.

Introduction

74

Since the first reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient in December 20191, the severe

75

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic, infecting

76

millions of individuals worldwide2. Though the majority of COVID-19 patients experience mild

77

symptoms, approximately 20% of cases have more severe disease outcomes involving hospitalization

78

or intensive care treatment, especially in those with underlying co-morbidities such as diabetics and

79

cardiovascular disease3. Furthermore, COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality is significantly

80

higher in the elderly population and almost absent in school-aged children4. A disproportional

81

outcome in disease severity with increasing age is not unique to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and is

82

observed during previous influenza pandemics5. Understanding whether baseline pre-existing

83

immunological responses, induced by previous exposure to seasonal coronaviruses, contributes to

84

such differences may provide important insights to such divergent clinical outcomes between children

85

and elderly.

86
87

Antibodies (Abs) are a vital component of the immune response with demonstrated importance in the

88

control of most viral pathogens. Apart from virus neutralization, Abs have the capacity to engage Fc

89

Receptors (FcRs) or complement to induce Fc effector functions, including Ab-dependent cellular

90

cytotoxicity (ADCC), Ab-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), or Ab-dependent complement

91

activation (ADCA)6. Fc functions are not limited to neutralizing viral epitopes but utilize any

92

available epitope6. A previous SARS-CoV (also called SARS-CoV-1) study associated ADCP with

93

viral clearance7, where individuals expressing a higher affinity FcγRIIa-H131 polymorphism,

94

associated with enhanced Fc functions, had better disease outcomes8. However Fc functional Abs may

95

also enhance infection or pathology through Ab-dependent enhancement (ADE), previously observed

96

in some SARS-CoV-1 animal vaccine and in vitro studies9,10. Hence, there is an urgent need to

97

understand the Ab responses elicited against SARS-CoV-2, especially given that current COVID-19

98

vaccine strategies are focused upon inducing effective neutralizing Ab responses11, without inducing

99

pathological damage12.

Immature humoral immunity in children

103

In-depth characterization of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 Ab responses in healthy children compared

104

to healthy elderly is needed to understand whether pre-existing human coronavirus (hCoV)-mediated

105

Ab immunity potentially contributes to COVID-19 outcome. We designed a cross-reactive CoV

106

multiplex array, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and hCoV (229E, HKU1,

107

NL63) spike (S) and nucleoprotein protein (NP) antigens (Extended Data Figure 1b). CoV-antigen-

108

specific levels of isotypes (IgG, IgA, IgM) and subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, IgA2),

109

along with C1q binding (a predictor of ADCA via the classical pathway) and FcγRIIa, Fcγ RIIb and

110

Fcγ RIIIa soluble dimer engagement (mimicking FcγR immune complex formation associated with the

111

induction of a range of Fc effector functions13) were assessed from plasma of 89 children, 98 adults,

112

and 57 elderly individuals (Extended Data Figure 2a and Extended Data Table 1), generating a

113

composite dataset of baseline CoV Ab features (14 CoV antigens x 14 detectors = 196 Ab features).

114
115

We compared CoV Ab responses between children and elderly, identifying 58 of 196 (29.6%) Ab

116

features as significantly different, taking into account multiple comparisons (all p<0.00037; Figure

117

1a; Extended Data Table 2). The volcano plot illustrates the eight Ab features (left) elevated in

118

children, consisting of IgM targeting a range of CoV antigens, including several SARS-CoV-2

119

antigens (S, NP, and the receptor binding domain (RBD), which is involved in binding to host cells

120

and is a key target of neutralizing Abs). Additionally, we observed elevated SARS-CoV-2 Abs that

121

engaged FcγRIIa-H131 soluble dimers, associated with increased ADCP responses13. Conversely, 50

122

significantly elevated features were observed in the elderly, primarily consisting of IgA and IgG

123

against a range of CoV antigens, along with hCoV-specific Abs that can bind soluble FcγRIIIa

124

dimers, associated with increased ADCC13,14.

125
126

Using systems serology15, we observed vastly different CoV serological signatures between children

127

and elderly (Figure 1). Unsupervised multidimensional visualization (Principal Component Analysis;

128

PCA) of all 196 CoV Ab features clearly distinguished children from elderly, with adults spanning

129

these two cohorts although clustering more closely to the elderly (Figure 1b). To identify the minimal

130

signatures of Ab features that best distinguished children from elderly, we performed feature selection

131

(Elastic-Net) followed by a supervised multidimensional clustering analysis (Partial Least Squares

132

Discriminant Analysis; PLSDA). Fifteen Ab features selected by Elastic-Net could accurately

133

discriminate between children and elderly (99.1% calibration, 98.6% cross-validation accuracy).

134

Significant separation of PLSDA scores occurred across the first Latent Variable (LV1) (p<0.0001, t

135

= 21.60, LV1-X axis, which accounted for 29.87% of the signature’s total variance; Figure 1c). The

136

loadings plot of LV1 (Figure 1d) confirmed that children have elevated IgM to a range of CoV

137

antigens, and elevated SARS-CoV-2 Abs that engaged FcgRIIa-H131 soluble dimers, but also SARS-

138

CoV-1 Abs that engaged FcγRIIIa. In comparison, the elderly had elevated IgA, IgG, and FcγRIIIa

139

binding Abs to CoV antigens. To better visualize how these Ab features could distinguish children

140

from elderly, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering and illustrate that the same

141

serological signatures naturally cluster the majority of children from the elderly (Figure 1e). Notably,

142

there were no differences in baseline CoV serological profiles between the sexes (Figure 1e), despite

143

males being clinically associated with higher mortality and more severe COVID-194. Correlates of Ab

144

signatures were further confirmed by feature selection followed by multivariate regression analysis

145

(Partial Least Squared Regression; PLSR), including all healthy individuals to analyse correlates

146

across age (Extended Data Figure 2).

147
148

To interrogate Ab functionality and cross-reactivity between antigens of selected CoV signatures, we

149

conducted a correlation network analysis, focusing upon significant correlations of Ab features

150

selected by Elastic-Net. The children’s network (Figure 1f) demonstrates how SARS-CoV-2 Abs that

151

engaged FcγRIIa-H131 are associated with SARS-CoV-2 IgG, specifically of IgG1 subclass. SARS-

152

CoV-2 FcγRIIa-H131 immune complex formation was also significantly correlated with multiple

153

other SARS-CoV-2 Fc responses, including FcγRIIb, C1q, and FcγRIIIa. Of interest, SARS-CoV-1

154

Abs that engaged FcgRIIIa-V158, were highly correlated with SARS-CoV-2 Ab responses,

155

potentially due to their high sequence similarity (77%) (Extended Data Figure 3). A separate highly

156

correlated IgM network of multiple CoV NP antigens was also observed. Collectively, these data

157

suggest that children may have elevated SARS-CoV-2 Abs with the capacity to engage a range of Fc

158

effector functions to SARS-CoV-2 S, in addition to elevated IgM responses to CoV antigens in

159

comparison to elderly. The elderly predominantly had hCoV functional Ab responses to S protein,

160

mediated by IgG1 and elevated IgA1 to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, correlative with IgA1 and IgA2 S and

161

IgA2 RBD responses (Figure 1g). Additionally, they had elevated SARS-CoV-2 NP Abs correlating

162

with FcγR signatures to a range of CoV. Amino acid (aa) alignment analyses of NP and S1 proteins

163

showed that there is 91% (NP) and 77% (S1) aa similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1

164

proteins, while SARS-COV-2 and MERS share 47% (NP) aa similarity, hCoVs NL63 and 229E share

165

29% and 26% aa similarity, respectively in NP, and hCoV HKU and 229E share 28% and 27% in S1,

166

respectively (Extended Data Figure 3c), supporting the network analyses. Collectively, these data

167

suggest that children have less exposure to CoV antigens but may have enhanced primary humoral

168

immune responses targeted to SARS-CoV-2 compared to elderly.

169
170

HLA-II alleles influence Ab signatures

171

HLA class II allele information was available for a subset of the healthy individuals (children n=84,

172

adults n=17, elderly n=10, Figure 2; Extended Data Table 1). To determine whether HLA-II alleles

173

contributed to differences in Ab predisposition, we conducted Elastic-Net and PLSDA to distinguish

174

Ab responses between the two most frequently observed HLA-DQB1, -DRB1 or -DPB1alleles in our

175

cohort (Figure 2a, d and g). Intriguingly, HLA-DQB1*03:01 and HLA-DQB1*06:02 were

176

associated with distinct Ab features (Figure 2b-c; calibration 86.4%, and 82.6% cross-validation

177

accuracy), as were HLA-DRB1*07:01 and HLA-DRB1*15:01 (Figure 2e-f; calibration 79.1%, and

178

76.3% cross-validation accuracy), along with HLA-DPB1*04:01 and HLA-DPB1*02:01 (82.3%

179

calibration and 72.2% cross-validation accuracy; Figure 2h-i). These results suggest that HLA-II

180

allelic repertoires of individuals may affect the development of Ab responses after infection or

181

vaccination, possibly contributing to the variable antigen-specific Ab titers and/or signatures observed

182

across individuals.

184

Distinct Fc Ab signature in COVID-19 patients

185

A cohort of 19 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients (Extended Data Figure 2a and Extended Data

186

Table 3) were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific serological profiles (Extended Data

187

Figure 4). An individual who was SARS-CoV-2-exposed but remained SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative,

188

was also assessed (Donor DD1). Elevated SARS-CoV-2-specific Ab responses in COVID-19 patients

189

relative to healthy or the exposed but PCR-negative individual were observed across multiple

190

titrations (Extended Data Figure 4). In particular, we found that in the majority of COVID-19

191

patients, the SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific Abs bound to FcγRIIIaV158 and FcγRIIaH131 soluble

192

dimers at high levels, even at 1:800 plasma titrations, suggesting potent ADCC and ADCP

193

activity13,14,16.

194
195

Next, we analysed whether COVID-19 patients had distinct serological patterns of SARS-CoV-2

196

antigen-specific Abs of a single isotype (IgG, IgA, or IgM) compared to healthy individuals

197

(including DD1) using hierarchical clustering. While majority of COVID-19-positive individuals

198

induced high SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM responses, especially to spike antigens, moderate levels of

199

cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM were also detected at high frequencies within the healthy

200

individuals (Figure 3a). Similarly, moderate SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA (Figure 3b) and IgG (Figure

201

3c) were observed in healthy individuals, though less frequently than IgM, with cross-reactive IgG

202

responses observed at the lowest frequencies of all isotypes (Figure 3c). Overall, moderate levels of

203

SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive Abs in healthy donors resulted in poor clustering of COVID-19 patients

204

from healthy individuals when a single isotype were assessed, even though multiple SARS-CoV-2

205

antigens were included. This suggests that reported low levels of false positives in current serological

206

diagnostics tests could be due to pre-existing levels of cross-reactive Abs that lead to similar

207

serological signatures as observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals when only quantity of

208

antigen-specific Abs are assessed.

209
210

To identify the minimum Ab signature that best distinguish the COVID-19 patients from healthy

211

individuals, feature selection was used and identified four SARS-CoV-2 Ab variables that

212

differentiated the two groups (Figure 3d-f), targeting three different SARS-CoV-2 antigens, S trimer,

213

(fold on stabilized spike ectodomain, 2P mutation17), NP, and Sclamp (molecular clamp stabilized

214

spike ectodomain18). Intriguingly, antigen-specific engagement of FcγRIIIaV158 and C1q, but not

215

IgG, were selected. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection likely induces antigen-specific Ab with

216

distinct Fc qualities, e.g. Fc glycosylation changes, enhancing binding of FcγRIIIaV158 and C1q19,20,

217

unlike pre-existing cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 Abs observed in our healthy donor cohort. In contrast

218

to previous unsupervised hierarchical clustering for IgA, IgM, and IgG (Figure 3a-c) to multiple

219

SARS-CoV-2 antigens, these four SARS-CoV-2 Ab features had distinct patterns in COVID-19

220

patients, which lead to the clustering of COVID-19 patients together with a single exception, this

221

notably being the healthy exposed SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative individual (Figure 3d). Strikingly, a

222

supervised PLSDA model of these four features, all associated with COVID-19 patients, could

223

significantly distinguish all COVID-19 patients from healthy individuals on LV1 alone (Figure 3e

224

and f, p<0.0001, t=34.80; 98.51% calibration accuracy, 98.51% cross-validation accuracy). To

225

specifically define these four SARS-CoV-2 Ab features, we conducted a correlation network of Ab

226

responses in the COVID-19-positive individuals (Figure 3g). High levels of correlation were

227

observed between all SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens: S1, S2, RBD, S Trimer, and Sclamp; while NP

228

antigen-specific Ab features created a separate network. Antigen-specific IgG1 and IgG3, which are

229

the most highly functional IgG subclasses21,22, were the key mediators of FcγR and C1q antigen-

230

specific Ab engagement. Collectively, these results suggest that future COVID-19 serological

231

diagnostic tests could be improved by assessing the Fc quality of antigen-specific Abs in addition to

232

Ab quantity.

233
234

Convalescent COVID-19 Ab signatures

235

The majority of COVID-19 moderate/severe samples were collected upon hospital presentation,

236

whereas mild samples were collected upon convalescence (Extended Data Table 3). Moreover, there

237

was no significant difference between these groups after adjusting for multiple comparisons, which is

238

not surprising given the small sample size (Extended Data Table 4). To explore CoV Ab responses

239

over time, we performed feature selection followed by multivariate regression analysis (PLSR)

240

according to days from first reported disease symptom onset. Not surprisingly, we observed similar

241

Ab signatures to those differentiating healthy from COVID-19 positive individuals, including SARS-

242

CoV-2 antigen-specific Ab engagement with FcγR, C1q, and IgG3 being the most predominant

243

variables associated with convalescence (Figure 4a-b, R2=0.84, Q2=0.72), with several of these Ab

244

features individually associated with days from symptom onset (Extended Data Figure 5). These

245

data are the first indication that SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific Ab Fc effector functions may have

246

contributed to convalescent of mild/moderate disease.

247
248

High SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgM in children

249

Finally, development of neutralizing Ab responses targeting the RBD are associated with control of

250

SARS-CoV-2, occurs in the majority of convalescent COVID-19 serum samples23. Therefore,

251

baseline RBD isotype-specific levels between healthy children, adults, elderly and COVID-19 patient

252

plasma samples were assessed via multiplex-assay and validated with published ELISA methods

253

(Figure 4c-i-ii, d-i-ii, e-i-ii). Ab detection in both assays was highly correlated (Figure 4c-iii, d-iii, e-

254

iii), confirming earlier observations that children induced elevated IgM, while elderly had higher

255

RBD-specific IgA1 responses as measured by multiplex and trended with ELISA IgA results, while

256

no differences in IgG were observed. Since Ab neutralization quality and potency is often correlated

257

with Ab avidity, we therefore conducted urea disassociation assays on a subset of children, elderly

258

and COVID-19 plasma samples (Figure 4c-iv, 4d-iv). No differences in IgA avidity were found

259

between children, elderly and COVID-19 patients. Avidity of RBD-specific IgM from elderly was

260

significantly weaker than COVID-19 patients (p=0.0177), while children’s responses, spanning a

261

large range of avidities, were not significantly different (p=0.0696). These data, in combination with

262

the overall higher IgM frequency in children, suggest that children may trend to have more potent

263

RBD-specific IgM which may mature more rapidly upon SARS-CoV-2 exposure, as compared to the

264

elderly.

265
266

Discussion

267

We observed distinct cross-reactive coronavirus serological signatures in healthy children compared

268

to elderly. Children had elevated CoV-specific IgM signatures, whereas elderly had more mature,

269

class-switched CoV-specific IgA and IgG, despite previous epidemiological studies observing higher

270

levels of hCoV infection amongst children compared to the elderly25, indicating that multiple rounds

271

of infections over decades might be needed to develop fully experienced CoV humoral immune

272

responses. Intriguingly, school-aged children often have better clinical outcomes during pandemic

273

influenza outbreaks5 and can induce more potent broadly-neutralising Ab upon HIV infection26,27. It is

274

plausible that upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, the elderly may preferentially induce skewed Ab

275

responses targeting prior cross-reactive hCoV antigens, unlike children who have less experienced

276

immunity and are therefore more likely to mount a more targeted immune response to novel antigens

277

from SARS-COV-2. This immunological phenomenon, known as the Hoskins effect (original antigen

278

sin), observed for several other viral pathogens including influenza and dengue28,29 and hypothesized

279

to contribute to enhanced cytokine storm upon dengue reinfection30. These hypotheses will need to be

280

confirmed by future studies examining cross-reactive CoV serological signatures from longitudinal

281

sampling of acute SARS-CoV-2-infected children and elderly.

282
283

Our results indicate HLA-II alleles contribute to differences in Ab signatures prior to antigen

284

exposure, which could potentially impact antigen-specific Ab profiles upon infection, this field has

285

thus far not been studied and could be associated with antigenic sin. Establishment of an effective

286

humoral immune response after infection and vaccination depends on generation of affinity-matured

287

long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells and is correlated with effective activation of T follicular

288

helper (TFH) cells31, which depend on the effective presentation of viral epitopes via HLA-II alleles.

289

Several studies demonstrate that variations in HLA-II alleles are associated with susceptibility or

290

resistance to several infectious diseases including MERS-CoV32,33 and with vaccine-induced Ab

291

responses34. Due to the low frequency of shared HLA-II alleles, this analysis could not be further

292

explored to determine the contribution of age or sex. However, the clear distinction in Ab signatures

293

emphasizes the need to better understand the contributions of HLA-II alleles to the maturation of

humoral immunity and would require a sufficiently large cohort of HLA-typed healthy controls and

295

COVID-19 patients.

296
297

We also assessed the CoV serological profiles of a small cohort of COVID-19 patients, observing

298

distinct SARS-CoV-2 Fc Ab signatures associated with enhanced engagement of FcγRIIIaV158 and

299

C1q, distinguishing healthy controls from COVID-19 patients. Ab Fc binding to Fcγ R can be

300

modulated by multiple structural, genetic, and post-translational modifications, including Fc

301

glycosylation19,35. Within convalescent plasma samples, we observed upregulation of SARS-CoV-2

302

antigen-specific IgG, particularly IgG3, which highly correlated with FcγR and C1q engagement,

303

suggesting that Fc functional responses may contribute to recovery. Fc effector functions, while

304

beneficial against many pathogens15,16,22,36, can also enhance infection and pathogenesis in other

305

infectious diseases, including dengue, where disease severity is associated with afucosylated IgG1

306

that enhances FcγRIIIa affinity37. This is also observed with other respiratory diseases including

307

tuberculosis, where greater overall inflammation, including inflammatory Fc glycosylation is

308

associated with poorer disease outcomes36,38. It is important for future larger SARS-CoV-2 serological

309

studies to assess not only quantitative changes in Ab titers, but also qualitative differences between

310

patients with mild and severe disease, whereas in our study the majority of patients had mild-to-

311

moderate COVID-19.

312
313

Overall, our in-depth serological profiling of healthy children, elderly, and COVID-19 patients brings

314

us closer to understanding why the elderly are more susceptible to COVID-19 and provides insights

315

into Ab Fc signatures associated with convalescence of mild/moderate symptomatic individuals. This

316

knowledge is important for the development of improved serological diagnostics, evaluation of

317

convalescent plasma therapeutic trials and will inform immunogenicity assessment of Ab-based

318

SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategies which could potentially extend beyond neutralizing Abs.

Melbourne. Healthy elderly donors (age 65-92) were recruited at the Deepdene Medical Clinic

478

(Victoria). All healthy donors were recruited prior to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2-infected

479

patients (age 21-75) were recruited at the Alfred Hospital (AH). Convalescent individuals who

480

recovered from COVID-19 were recruited by James Cook University (DD) or University of

481

Melbourne (CP). Eligibility criteria for COVID-19- acute and convalescent recruitment were age ≥18

482

years old and having at least one swab PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Each patient was categorized

483

into one of the following 6 severity categories: very mild (stay at home minimal symptoms), mild

484

(stay at home with symptoms), moderate (hospitalized, not requiring oxygen), severe/moderate

485

(hospitalized with low flow oxygen), severe (hospitalized with high flow oxygen) or critical (intensive

486

care unit (ICU)). Heparinised blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 300 g to collect plasma, which was

To minimise background from the E. coli expression system, recombinant hCoV 229E and NL63 NP

501

(Prospec-Tany) were first treated with O-glycosidase and PNGase F. Briefly, 40µg of NP were treated

502

with a cocktail of 8µl 10X GlycoBuffer 2, 8µl 10% NP40, 12µl O-Glycosidase, 12µl of Remove-iT

503

PNGase F (New England BioLabs) and water for a final volume of 80µl and incubated at 37°C for

504

two hours on a shaker. The respective mixtures were added to Eppendorf tubes containing 100µl of

505

PSB-washed Chitin magnetic beads (New England BioLabs) to allow the binding and removal of

515

2 and MERS-CoV (gift from University of Queensland) (Extended Data Figure 1b). Tetanus toxoid

516

(Sigma) and influenza hemagglutinin (H1Cal2009; Sino Biological), were also added to the assay as

517

positive controls, while BSA blocked beads were included as negative controls. Magnetic

518

carboxylated beads (Bio Rad) were covalently coupled to the antigens using a two-step carbodiimide

519

reaction, in a ratio of 10 million beads to 100µg of antigen, with the exception of the deglycosylated

520

NPs mentioned above in which 40µg were used instead. Briefly, beads were washed and activated in

521

100 mM monobasic sodium phosphate, pH 6.2, followed by the addition of Sulfo-N-

522

hydroxysulfosuccinimide and 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (Thermo Fisher

523

Scientific). After incubation at room temperature (RT) for 30 minutes, the activated microspheres

524

were washed three times and resuspended in 50mM MES pH 5.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The

525

respective antigens were added to the activated beads and the mixture was incubated at RT for three

526

hours on a rotator in the dark. Subsequently, the beads were washed with PBS and blocked with

527

blocking buffer (PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.02% TWEEN-20, 0.05% Azide, pH 7) for 30 minutes. Finally,

528

beads were washed in PBS 0.05% Sodium Azide and resuspended to one million beads per 100µl.

Luminex bead-based multiplex assay

531

The isotypes and subclasses of pathogen-specific antibodies present in the collected plasma were

532

assessed using a multiplex assay as described39. Using a black, clear bottom 384-well plate (Greiner

533

Bio-One), 20µl of working bead mixture containing 1000 beads per bead region and 20µl of diluted

534

plasma were added per well. From validation experiments in which cross-reactive Abs present in

535

healthy individuals were titrated, an optimal concentration of 1:100 working dilution of plasma was

536

selected for downstream assays (Extended data Figure 1c and d). The plate was covered and

537

incubated overnight at 4°C on a shaker and was then washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween20

538

(PBST). Pathogen-specific antibodies were detected using phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse anti-

539

human pan-IgG, IgG1-4, IgA1-2 (Southern Biotech), at 1.3µg/ml, 25µl per well. After incubation at

540

RT for two hours on a shaker, the plate was washed, before the beads were resuspended in 50 µl of

541

sheath fluid. The plate was then incubated at RT for 10 minutes on a shaker before being read by the

542

FlexMap 3D. The binding of the PE-detectors was measured to calculate the median fluorescence

543

intensity (MFI). Double background subtraction was conducted, removing first background of blank

544

(buffer only) wells followed by removal of BSA-blocked control bead background signal for each

545

well.

547

For the detection of IgM, biotinylated mouse anti-human IgM (mAb MT22; MabTech) was added at

548

1.3µg/ml, 25µl per well. After incubation at RT for two hours on a shaker, the plate was washed, and

549

streptavidin, R-Phycoerythrin conjugate (SAPE; Invitrogen) was added at 1µg/ml, 25µl per well. The

552

Fcγ RIIa-H131, lower affinity polymorphisms FcγRIIa-R131, FcγRIIb, higher affinity polymorphisms

553

Fcγ RIIIa-V158, lower affinity polymorphisms FcγRIIIa-F158) were provided by Bruce Wines and

554

Mark Hogarth. For the detection of C1q, C1q protein (MP Biomedicals) was first biotinylated

555

(Thermo Fisher Scientific), washed and resuspended in PBS and tertramerized with SAPE. Dimers or

556

tetrameric C1q-PE were added at 1µg/ml, 25µl per well, incubated at RT for two hours on a shaker,

557

then washed. For Dimers, SAPE was added at 1µg/ml, 25µl per well, incubated at RT for two hours

558

on a shaker before being washed and read as mentioned above. Assays were repeated in duplicate. A

559

titration of AH0073 was included in the layout of all multiplex array plates as this patient was known

560

to have IgG, IgM and IgA responses (Extended Data Figure 6). These titrations were used to

561

normalize replicate multiplex array plates.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

566

following modifications; Nunc MaxiSorp flat bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were

567

used for antigen coating, blocking performed with PBS containing 10% BSA and serial dilutions

568

performed with PBST containing 5% BSA. For detection of IgG and IgA, peroxidase-conjugated goat

569

anti-human IgG (Fcγ fragment specific; Jackson ImmunoResearch) or alkaline phosphate-conjugated

570

rat anti-human IgA (mAb MT20; MabTech), was used and developed with TMB (Sigma) substrate for

571

IgG or pNPP (Sigma) for IgA. For IgM, biotinylated mAb MT22 and peroxidase-conjugated

572

streptavidin (Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used. Peroxidase reactions were stopped using 1M

573

H3PO4 and plates read at 450nm or 405nm on a Multiskan plate reader (Labsystems). All

574

measurements were normalised using a positive control plasma from a COVID-19 patient (AH0073)

575

run on each plate (Extended data Figure 6). Endpoint titres were determined by interpolation from a

576

sigmodial curve fit (all R-squared values >0.95; GraphPad Prism 8) as the reciprocal dilution of

577

plasma that produced ≥15% absorbance of the positive control. A total of 28 donors from each cohort

578

was randomly selected for IgA analysis, 14 for IgG and 10-14 for IgM. All assays also included 5

579

same COVID-19 patient samples.

Detection of RBD-specific antibodies was performed as described in Stadlbauer et al

24,40

with the

580
581

Antibody avidity assay

582

Avidity of antibodies in plasma samples was measured using urea as the chaotropic agent and only

583

performed on samples with detectable RBD-specific antibodies (IgA and IgM). Following incubation

584

of plasma at a 1:10 dilution (IgA) or 1:100 dilution (IgM) on RBD-coated plates, 6M of urea was

585

added and incubated for 15 minutes. Bound antibodies were then detected using respective secondary

586

detection reagents described above. The avidity index is expressed as the percentage of remaining

587

antibody bound to antigen following urea treatment compared to the absence of urea.

Statistical Analysis

590

Children versus the elderly Volcano plot was conducted using Prism 8. Statistical significance

591

determined using the Holm-Sidak method, with alpha = 0.05 adjusted for 196 tests (Ab features). Each

592

feature was analyzed individually, without assuming a consistent SD. The overall multiplex dataset was

593

analysed for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test by Prism 8 The data were further

594

analysed by SPSS statistics 26 (IBM Corp.) using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis with a

595

Bonferroni correction to determine the p-values, differences between groups were considered

596

significant at an adjusted p-value of 0.000035 (Extended data Table 2). ELISA data was analyzed

597

using Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis with Dunn’s multiple comparison using Prism 8. Differences

598

between very mild/mild and moderate/severe/critical patients were analysed using the Mann-Whitney

599

test and differences were considered significant at a p-value of 0.05 (Extended data Table 4).

600
601

Data Normalization

602

For all multivariate analysis Tetanus, H1Cal2009 antigens (positive controls) were removed, with the

603

exception of HLA analysis. Any healthy samples with a missing age, or missing Ab features were

604

removed (n=9). When analysing COVID-19 samples with healthy samples, only the features where

605

data was available for all COVID-19 samples were included. COVID-19 samples lacked entire

606

datasets for IgG4, IgA2, FcgRIIaR131, FcgRIIIaF158, and FcgRIIb, thus these detectors were

607

excluded. When COVID-19 samples were analysed based on the time from disease onset, all visit

608

days were used for each patient. In all other analyses when a patient has two visit days only the

609

second visit was used. Right shifting was performed on each feature (detector-antigen pair)

610

individually if it contained any negative values, by adding the minimum value for that feature back to

611

all samples within that feature. Following this all data was log transformed using the following

612

equation, where x is the right shifted data and y is the right shifted log transformed data: y =

613

log10(x+1). This process transformed the majority of the features to having a normal distribution. In

614

all subsequent multivariate analysis, the data were furthered normalized by mean centring and

615

variance scaling each feature using the zscore function in Matlab. For the HLA analysis, the same

616

data normalization methods were used, except that positive controls were included and all samples

617

with any HLA typing were included. Samples with one copy of each most frequent allele were

618

removed to avoid double classification.

619
620

Feature Selection Using Elastic Net/PLSR and Elastic Net/PLSDA

621

To determine the minimal set of features (signatures) needed to predict numerical outcomes (age, days

622

from symptom onset) and categorical outcomes (age cohort, COVID-19 infection status, HLA Allele)

623

a three-step process was developed based on41. First, the data were randomly sampled without

624

replacement to generate 2000 subsets. The resampled subsets spanned 80% of the original sample

17

625

size, or sampled all classes at the size of the smallest class for categorical outcomes, which corrected

626

for any potential effects of class size imbalances during regularization. Elastic-Net regularization was

627

then applied to each of the 2000 resampled subsets to reduce and select features most associated with

628

the outcome variables. The Elastic-Net hyperparameter, alpha, was set to have equal weights between

629

the L1 norm and L2 norm associated with the penalty function for least absolute shrinkage and

630

selection (LASSO) and ridge regression, respectively42. By using both penalties, Elastic-Net provides

631

sparsity and promotes group selection. The frequency at which each feature was selected across the

632

2000 iterations was used to determine the signatures by using a sequential step-forward algorithm that

633

iteratively added a single feature into the PLSR (numerical outcome) or PLSDA (categorical

634

outcome) model starting with the feature that had the highest frequency of selection, to the lowest

635

frequency of selection. Model prediction performance was assessed at each step and evaluated by 10-

636

fold cross-validation classification error for categorical outcomes and 10-fold goodness of prediction

637

(Q2) for numerical outcomes. The model with the lowest classification error and highest Q2 within a

638

0.01 difference between the minimum classification error or the maximum Q2 were selected as the

639

minimum signature. If multiple models fell within this range, the one with the least number of

640

features was selected and if there was a large disparity between calibration and cross-validation error

641

(overfitting), the model with the least disparity and best performance was selected.

642
643

PCA

644

Principal Component Analysis (PCA), performed in Eigenvectors PLS toolbox in Matlab, is an

645

unsupervised technique that was used to visualize the variance in the samples based on all of the

646

measured features. Every feature is assigned a loading, the linear combinations of these loadings

647

creates a principal component (PC). Loadings and principal components are calculated to describe the

648

maximum amount of variance in the data. Each sample is then scored and plotted using their

649

individual response measurements expressed through the PCs. The percent of variance described by

650

each PC is a measure of the amount of variance in antibody response explained by that respective PC.

651

Separation of groups on the scores plot indicates unsupervised separation of groups based on all

652

features.

653
654

PLSDA

655

Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA), performed in Eigenvectors PLS toolbox in

656

Matlab, was used in conjunction with Elastic-Net, described above, to identify and visualize

657

signatures that distinguish categorical outcomes (age cohort, COVID-19 infection status). This

658

supervised method assigns a loading to each feature within a given signature and identifies the linear

659

combination of loadings (a latent variable) that best separates the categorical groups. A feature with a

660

high loading magnitude indicates greater importance for separating the groups from one another. Each

661

sample is then scored and plotted using their individual response measurements expressed through the

662

latent variables (LVs). The scores and loadings can then be cross referenced to determine which

663

features are loaded in association with which categorical groups (positively loaded features are higher

664

in positively scoring groups etc). All models go through 10-fold cross-validation, where iteratively

665

10% of the data is left out as the test set, and the rest is used to train the model. Model performance is

666

measured through calibration error (average error in the training set) as well as cross-validation error

667

(average error in the test set), with values near zero being best. All models were orthogonalized to

668

enable clear visualization of results. Statistically significant separation of groups on the PLSDA score

669

plots was determined using a two-tailed t-test on LV1 scores in Prism 8.

670
671

PLSR

672

Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), performed in Eigenvectors PLS toolbox in Matlab, was

673

used in conjunction with Elastic-Net, described above, to identify and visualize signatures that

674

distinguish numerical outcomes (age, days from symptom onset). This supervised method assigns a

675

loading to each feature within a given signature and identifies the linear combination of loadings (a

676

latent variable) that best describes the variance in the numerical outcome. As in PLSDA, a feature

677

with a high loading indicates greater importance for describing the variance in outcome. Each sample

678

is then scored and plotted using their individual response measurements expressed through the latent

679

variables (LVs). The scores and loadings can then be cross referenced to determine which features are

680

loaded in association with which numerical outcomes (positively loaded features are higher in

681

positively scoring samples etc). All models go through 10-fold cross validation, where iteratively 10%

682

of the data is left out as the test set, and the rest is used to train the model. Model performance is

683

measured through R2 (average goodness of fit in the training set) as well as Q2 (average goodness of

684

prediction in the test set), with values near 1 being best. All models were orthogonalized to enable

685

clear visualization of results.

686
687

Hierarchical Clustering

688

We visualized separation of numerical (age, days from symptom onset) and categorical (age cohort,

689

COVID-19 infection status) outcomes based on their respective signatures using unsupervised average

690

linkage hierarchical clustering of normalized data; Euclidean distance was used as the distance

691

metric.

Multiple sequence alignment of CoV Spike and NP

694

FASTA sequences were obtained from Genpept using the accession numbers as provided by the

695

696

aligned using T-Coffee with the default settings. Residues were coloured to display consensus to the

697

S1 and NP of SAR-CoV-2. Distance matrix for multiple alignment similarities were made in Ugene.

Hierarchical clustering of all SARS-CoV-2 antigens for IgM (a), IgA1 (b) and IgG (c). Levels are

784

coloured from low (dark blue) to high (dark red). Hierarchical clustering (d) and PLSDA model

785

scores (e) and loadings (f) were performed using the four-feature Elastic-Net selected SARS-CoV-2

786

antigen signature (1.49% calibration error, 1.49% cross-validation error). Variance explained by each

787

LV is in parentheses. (g) Correlation network analysis for COVID-19 patients was performed to

788

identify features significantly associated with the Elastic-Net selected features (red outline). Coded by

789

Ab feature type (colour), antigen (shape), correlation strength (line thickness, alpha <0.05) and

790

correlation coefficient (line colour). Data was zscored prior to analysis.

804

Multiplex was validated by measuring a subset of healthy samples both in singleplex and multiplex.

805

Strong correlations suggest that multiplexing did not affect measurement of Ab responses, especially

806

at 1:50 and 1:100 dilutions. (d) Serial dilution of a subset of healthy samples against 14 antigens

807

included in the custom multiplex assay to select dilutions where saturation was not observed. A final

808

dilution of 1: 100 showed not only strong correlation between singleplexed and multiplexed antigens,

809

but was also not saturated for most antigens and was selected for subsequent assays.

Extended Data Figure 3. Multiple Sequence alignment of NP and S1

820

Amino acid sequence alignments of the various NP (a) and S1 (b) used in the assay. Fasta sequences

821

were obtained from Genpept and aligned using T-Coffee with default settings. Amino acids were

822

highlighted to show consensus towards the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, with darker shades of blue being

823

used with increasing consensus. (c) Percentage amino acid sequence alignment for NP and S1

Extended Data Figure 4. SARS2 Ab titrations

827

Serial dilutions of COVID-19 plasmas against the six SARS-CoV-2 antigens in the assay. Very mild

828

and mild cases were coloured black, while moderate to severe cases were coloured orange. For

829

comparison, two healthy elderly plasma were included (green). DD1, who was SARS CoV-2-exposed

830

but remained SARS CoV-2 PCR-negative, was also included (purple).
