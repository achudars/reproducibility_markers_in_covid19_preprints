ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
Children (≤18 years) account for ~20% of the US population but currently
represent <2% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Because infected
children often have few or no symptoms and may not be tested, the extent of infection in
children is poorly understood.
METHODS
During the March 18th-May 15th 2020 Louisiana Stay At Home Order, 1690 blood
samples from 812 individuals from a Children’s Hospital were tested for antibodies to
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein.
Demographics, COVID-19 testing, and clinical presentation abstracted from medical
records were compared with local COVID-19 cases.
RESULTS
In total, 62 subjects (7.6%) were found to be seropositive. The median age was 11
years with 50.4% female. The presenting complaint of seropositive patients was chronic
illness (43.5%). Only 18.2% had a previous positive COVID-19 PCR or antibody test.
Seropositivity was significantly associated with parish (counties), race, and residence in
a low-income area. Importantly, seropositivity was linearly correlated with cumulative
COVID-19 case number for all ages by parish.
CONCLUSION
In a large retrospective study, the seropositivity prevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in children
in Louisiana during the mandated Stay At Home Order was 7.6%. Residence location,
race, and lower socioeconomic factors were linked to more frequent seropositivity in
children and correlated to regional COVID-19 case rates. Thus, a significant number of
children in Louisiana had SARS-CoV-2 infections that went undetected and unreported
and may have contributed to virus transmission.

Introduction
In December 2019, novel pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, China.1 On
March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a global pandemic. As of July 6th,
2020, there are over 11.6 million confirmed cases accompanied by over 537,000 deaths
worldwide. Clinical manifestations of the infection range from severe viral pneumonia
with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), to asymptomatic, with estimates of
asymptomatic individuals potentially as high as 20%.2 Most children diagnosed with
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported to recover in 1-2 weeks and
have milder symptoms, faster recovery, and a better prognosis compared to adults.3,4
Among US cases reported between February 12th and April 2nd, 2020, only 1.7% of
cases were in children aged <18 years.5 While healthy children do acquire SARS-CoV-2
and can become severely ill, this is less likely to occur than in adults.6,7 To date, it is
unclear whether children are less readily infected, or whether they simply hold a higher
probability of experiencing asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection and are
therefore not tested.
SARS-CoV-2 shed by asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, or mildly symptomatic
subjects has likely contributed to the rapid spread of the virus.8 This is supported by
contact tracing to pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals, evidence of high viral
shedding in these individuals9, and epidemiologic models.10 Symptomatic and
asymptomatic children may act as efficient vectors of transmission, particularly within
households, as high level shedding has been demonstrated in infected asymptomatic
children.11-13 Currently, little is known about how children may contribute to broader
spreading outside of households, a critical factor in guiding future infection control
measures and informing predictive models of viral spread.14
Given the expected prolonged course of the pandemic, and the on-going efforts
to balance recommendations for social distancing with the educational and
developmental needs of children, there is a critical and urgent need to understand the
prevalence of infection in children, and their roles in viral transmission. Here we
describe evidence of previous infection in children in the New Orleans area that likely
preceded the first documented cases of COVID-19 in pediatric patients.
Methods
STUDY OVERSIGHT
The study was performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration
of Helsinki principles for ethical research. The Institutional Review Board of the local
academic institution and the children’s hospital from which samples were obtained
approved the study protocol (IRB#2020-493). All authors reviewed the manuscript for
accuracy, completeness of data and fidelity to the approved protocol.
BLOOD SAMPLE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING
Blood samples were collected from the regional children’s hospital in Orleans Parish,
Louisiana between March 18th-May 15th, 2020. A Stay At Home Order was issued on
March 23rd and elective surgeries were halted on March 19th. The first pediatric case
and death in Louisiana was reported on March 22nd after autopsy confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection.15 During the study period, due to hospital guidelines and state

recommendations, in person, routine pediatric visits were limited. Samples therefore do
not reflect the general population and likely include a higher proportion of children with
chronic and/or life threatening conditions, time-sensitive surgical needs, acute medical,
mental health, or trauma related concerns. Blood was drawn as part of care in the
emergency room, inpatient floors, ambulatory clinics, or as part of routine pre-operative
studies for time-sensitive surgeries. Due to hospital regulations, refrigerated samples
were release to our study team seven days after blood draw. Serum or plasma was then
immediately isolated, heat inactivated for 30 minutes at 56°C, and stored at -20°C until
analyzed. All identifying data was removed and samples were coded with a unique
subject identification.
SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA
A serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) ELISA was used to determine presence or absence of
SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike (S) antibodies. Briefly, detergent-solubilized viral glycoproteins
produced by infected or transfected cells were immobilized in wells coated with
Concanavalin-A (ConA) to provide solid phase antigen for ELISA as previously
described.16 Antigens were generated by transfection of 293T (ATCC) cells with SARSCoV-2 S-protein mammalian expression plasmid (BEI Resources). ELISA plates were
coated with 10 µg/ml ConA (Vector Labs). Antigen positive and negative cells were
lysed and centrifuged to remove insoluble debris. Predetermined optimal dilutions of cell
lysates were incubated in ConA coated wells to allow capture of viral glycoproteins,
followed by incubation of serum samples diluted 1:100. Antibody binding was detected
with peroxidase conjugated anti-­‐human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) and the
colorimetric reaction was performed as previously described.16 Each serum sample was
tested in parallel with similarly prepared lysates of untransfected 293T cells with the
latter optical density (OD) reading subtracted to determine net OD. Positive reactions
were defined as a net OD reading >0.7. All antibody analyses were performed blind to
all medical data including demographic data. This ELISA was validated by testing of
COVID-19 convalescent serum and 100 pre-COVID-19 sera samples from healthy
subjects collected prior to 2020.
DATA SOURCES AND STATISTICS
The following data was abstracted from electronic medical records: demographics, chief
complaint at the visit when the blood was drawn, diagnostic codes for current visit and
chronic medical conditions, and history of COVID-19 testing. Median household income
for the patient’s zip code of residence was used as a proxy for socioeconomic status
(SES) and obtained from the US Census Bureau (2014-2018 averaged values) or from
a commercial vendor that provides mined US Census Bureau data from 2018
(https://www.cubitplanning.com/). Parishes (counties) with >30 subjects were identified.
Parish level COVID-19 case rates were extracted from Louisiana Department of Health
website: ldh.la/gov/Coronavirus over the same period.
Statistical analysis was performed and graphs created using GraphPad Software
v7 and IBM SPSS Statistics (v.25). Categorical measures are presented as percentages
and continuous measures as medians and interquartile ranges. Analysis between
seronegative and seropositive groups was performed using Chi squared tests. Map was
created using Datawrapper (https://www.datawrapper.de/).

Results
DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS
A total of 1690 stored blood samples from pediatric subjects were obtained in
New Orleans from March 18th to May 15th, 2020 (Figure 1). From March 18th through
April 20th, only gold-top serum-separator tubes were collected. From April 21st green
(heparin) and lavender (EDTA) were collected, accounting for a higher volume of
samples. Duplicate blood samples (from the same patient, on the same day) accounted
for 130 of the 1690 samples. Additionally, 744 samples were from subjects that had
blood collected on more than one day. In total, 812 unique subjects were tested during
the study period by ELISA for serum IgG antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)
protein. As shown in Figure 2, our study included subjects from 41 of 64 parishes within
Louisiana. A majority of patients were from Jefferson (27.5%) or Orleans (27.1%)
Parishes and fewer subjects were from St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Terrebonne and St.
Bernard Parishes.
The demographic characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. The
population was evenly split between females (50.4%) and males (49.6%). The age
range was 2 days to 18 years of age. The median age was 11 years (interquartile range
(IQR), 4-15 years). Our cohort included 42.7% children who identified as Black, 41.4%
as white, 5.3% as Hispanic, and 10.6% who identified as other races or race/ethnicity
was not listed.
Based on diagnostic codes from past medical history, 17.7% of seropositive
subjects were categorized as having a severely immunocompromising condition,
including malignancy, organ failure, and bone marrow or stem cell transplant (Table 2).
The majority of subjects presented for a problem or follow-up directly related to an
existing chronic condition (43.5%), while 9.7% presented for trauma, 9.7% for
behavioral health reasons, and 27% with a complaint or reason not directly related to an
existing chronic condition, trauma, or behavioral health (Table 2).
Overall, 7.6% of the patients tested positive for IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 S
protein (Table 1). The earliest positive sample was from March 19th, from a 10 year-old
child. We observed an increase in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence over time from March
18th to May 15th (Fig 3A). There was no statistically significant difference in
seroprevalence by sex or age. There were statistically significant differences by race,
parish, and residence in an area with lower household incomes (estimated by zip code).
Although Black and white children were equally represented in the full cohort, Black
children accounted for 58.1% of seropositive subjects, while white children represented
only 24.2% of the seropositive subjects. A similar disproportionate rate of seropositivity
was also seen Hispanic children who comprised 5.3% of all subjects, but 11.3% of
seropositive subjects. Positivity rates within race also differed with the lowest rate found
in white children (4.5%), and significantly higher rates in Black children (10.4%) and
Hispanic children (16.2%).
As with race, seroprevalence rates differed by parish (Fig 3C). Despite
approximate overall equal numbers in children from Orleans and Jefferson Parish in the
cohort, children living in Orleans Parish accounted for 46.8% of seropositive children,
children from Jefferson Parish accounted for 24.2% and children living in other parishes
accounted for 4.8%, 1.6% and 1.6% in St. Tammany, St. Bernard and Terrebonne

Parishes respectively. Positivity rates within each parish also differed significantly, with
13% of participants in Orleans Parish seropositive, while only 6.7% of children in
Jefferson Parish were positive and 5.7% in St. Tammany (Fig 3B-3C). From data
reported by the State, Orleans and Jefferson Parish also had higher levels of cumulative
COVID-19 case rates for all ages (Fig. 3D). Seropositivity in children broken down by
parish was significantly and linearly correlated to number of state-reported COVID-19
cases on two different dates (Fig 3E). Of seropositive subjects, 43.5% lived in a zip
code with a median household income in the bottom quartile (<$36,939) while the
distribution of subjects in the seronegative sample was equal across income levels.
Multiple samples obtained on different days were available in a subset of
participants. In three seronegative subjects, samples were available across a period of
4-6 weeks without evidence of seroconversion (Fig S1A). Four subjects seroconverted
over a one-month period after initially testing negative (Figure S1B). Six subjects
showed continued presence of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 over a one-month period
(Figure S1C). Of the 62 seropositive subjects, 33 had a medical record of a COVID-19
test for viral presence or serum IgG (Table S1). Of the 33 tested, 6 had positive COVID19 results. Two subjects initially tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,
then tested negative at later time points (Figure S2).
Discussion
Our study utilized serologic methods to evaluate evidence of previous SARSCoV-2 infection in children receiving medical care in New Orleans during the early part
of the COVID-19 outbreak in Louisiana. We demonstrated 7.6% positive seroprevalence
for SARS-CoV-2 in this population, similar to a recent study in adults.17 Residents in
Orleans Parish, while only about one fourth of the total study population, accounted for
almost half (46.8%) of the positive cases. This result is consistent with reported infection
rates where Orleans Parish was an early epicenter of COVID-19 having one of the
highest per capita rates of infections in the country in March. Notably our earliest
detected seropositive individual was from March 19th, days prior to the March 24th
Louisiana Stay At Home Order and concurrent with the first reported COVID-19 positive
infection case in a pediatric patient, indicating that pediatric infections were present prior
to the first documented case. Importantly, we also found a trend of initial increasing
seroprevalence, which plateaued in late April, likely due to the state mandated Stay At
Home Order, changes in social distancing guidance and remote learning or closure of
schools across the state.
Similar to a recent study in New Orleans that determined seroprevalence in
adults17, our data suggest SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is common. Limited
seroprevalence studies in adults in the US18 and globally19-21 are highly variable in
characteristics and outcomes, with seroprevalence rates ranging from 1.5% (Santa
Clara County) to 14.9% in New York State. Given wide differences in demographics and
disease course across different geographic locations, it is difficult to compare our results
with those of other studies. A recently released report from Seattle Children’s Hospital
with a sample source similar to our study showed a seroprevalence of 1% in their
population.22 More research is needed to better understand the differences in infection
dynamics between adults and children and differences across geographic areas.

We observed that seropositivity rates in children mapped well to regions with
high state-reported COVID-19 case rates (Fig 3E). Given the expected lag of
seroconversion following acute infection, it is perhaps not surprising that the correlation
was stronger to the number of state-reported COVID-19 cases (all ages) from April 1st
(R2 = 0.99) rather than May 15th (R2 = 0.84), the end date of blood samples tested in this
study. Interestingly, between April 1st and May 15th there were notable changes in statereported parish COVID-19 case rates (e.g., increasing cases in Jefferson Parish and
Tangipahoa); future studies in community wide seroprevalence may demonstrate these
changes, albeit with a time lag.
Our results also implicate neighborhood income level as an additional factor
contributing to risk of infection. Existing literature links zip code to myriad health
outcomes, including mortality.23 We report here that children residing in zip codes with
lower household income account for 43.5% of positive cases, yet only 25.4% of the total
sample. This result has been identified as a key parameter in seroprevalence rates of
other common viruses such as cytomegalovirus24 and is also consistent with preliminary
data suggesting a higher transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in lower income neighborhoods
that may be confounded with the reported high rates of infection in minority
populations.25
In addition to potential differences due to SES, our results also indicate racial
disparity in infections, with 10.4% of Black children and 16.2% of Hispanic children
testing positive for antibody, compared to the 4.5% seropositivity rate in white children.
This mirrors existing literature which have shown racial disparities in infection rates,
including a recent study in New Orleans in adults.26
Despite the strengths of this study, there are limitations. The study population
consists of children obtaining medical care during the beginning of the pandemic and is
not likely to be representative of the general population. Our data on both race and SES
were obtained from electronic medical records. In terms of SES, we utilized estimated
average household income from existing data through 2018 and do not suggest that this
is a true estimate of the individual SES of the family in which the child lives, but rather is
an indicator of the established links between neighborhood factors and health risk. Race
was also obtained from electronic medical records and not directly obtained from the
participants, as such mixed race categorization is lacking. Our antibody ELISA only
captures children who have mounted an antibody response, missing children who have
been infected but fail to produce antibodies. It has been reported that some individuals
do not produce detectable antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection27 and there may be
short-term antibody persistence in some individuals. Lastly, the geographical location of
the hospital would be most accessible to those residing in Orleans Parish. Children with
severe medical emergencies residing in other parishes may have sought care at closer
hospitals resulting in less representation of these regions.
An enhanced understanding of the general seroprevalence in pediatric
populations is critical to implementing public safety protocols related to schooling,
daycare and other activities that involve children and families. Our data indicate that
children are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop measurable antibodies,
and that existing racial and socioeconomic disparities seen in adults are reflected in
children. Our overall seroprevalence of 7.6% clearly shows that mitigation measures at

control viral spread.
