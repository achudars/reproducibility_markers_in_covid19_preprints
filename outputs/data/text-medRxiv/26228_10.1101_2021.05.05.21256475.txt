Abstract
Around 5% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients develop critical disease,
with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In these cases,
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be considered when conventional
therapy fails. This study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics and in-hospital
outcomes of COVID-19 patients with ARDS refractory to standard lung-protective
ventilation and pronation treated with ECMO support and to compare them to patients
who did not receive ECMO. Patients were selected from the Brazilian COVID-19
Registry. At the moment of the analysis, 7,646 patients were introduced in the registry,
eight of those received ECMO support (0.1%). The convenience sample of patients
submitted to ECMO was compared to control patients selected by genetic matching for
gender, age, comorbidities, pronation, ARDS and hospital, in a 5:1 ratio. From the 48
patients included in the study, eight received ECMO and 40 were matched controls.
There were no significant differences in demographic, clinical and laboratory
characteristics. Mortality was higher in the ECMO group (n = 7; 87.5%) when
compared with controls (n = 17; 42.5%), (p=0.048). In conclusion, COVID 19 patients
with ARDS refractory to conventional therapy who received ECMO support had worse
outcomes to patients who did not receive ECMO. Our findings are not different from
previous studies including a small number of patients, however there is a huge
difference from Extracorporeal Life Support Organization results, which encourages us
to keep looking for our best excellence.

Introduction
Despite the fact that the majority of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
patients develop mild to moderate symptoms, around 5% of people have critical disease,
with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)[1]. In these
cases, therapy includes corticosteroids, protective pulmonary mechanical ventilation,
neuromuscular

blockade,

higher

positive

end-expiratory pressure,

pulmonary

recruitment techniques, prone positioning, and more recently tocilizumab[2]. For
refractory cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be considered a
last resort in certain patients with critical pulmonary compromise[3]. Previous studies
reported success with ECMO in critically ill patients diagnosed with Middle Eastern
respiratory syndrome (MERS) and this evidence encouraged physicians to try ECMO in
COVID-19 patients presenting ARDS refractory to standard lung-protective ventilation
and pronation[3, 4].
In the largest randomised controlled trial on ECMO for ARDS, the ECMO to
Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS (EOLIA) trial, there was no difference in 60-day
mortality between the ECMO group (35%) and the conventional group (46%); RR 0.76,
95% CI 0.55–1.04; p=0.09)[4]. A post-hoc analysis of the EOLIA trial[4], a metaanalysis of trials of ECMO for ARDS in adults[5], and a network meta-analysis[6]
provided credible support to the existence of a survival benefit of ECMO in refractory
ARDS.
Despite such optimism for a possible role for ECMO in those cases, early reports
of patients with COVID-19 requiring ECMO suggested that mortality could be greater
than 90%[7-10]. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) has been
conducting real-time tracking of all COVID-19 cases who received ECMO worldwide,
and current results show an estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90

days after the initiation of ECMO of 50% worldwide, and 4% of the patients who did
not die are still in the intensive care unit, 11% were discharged to another hospital and
13% were discharged alive to long-term acute care or unspecified location[11]. These
findings are less enthusiastic than previous results from a cohort study published by the
same group, and there is currently insufficient high quality evidence to recommend
either for or against ECMO in patients with COVID-19[12].
Given the lack of clinical trials and prospective studies on ECMO support in
COVID 19 patients, questions regarding its effectiveness and feasibility in clinical
practice remain unknown. Therefore, we aimed to assess the clinical characteristics and
in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 patients with ARDS refractory to standard lungprotective ventilation and pronation treated with ECMO support and to compare them to
patients who did not receive ECMO.

Methodology
This manuscript adheres to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline[13].
Patients were selected from the Brazilian COVID-19 Registry, a prospective
multicenter cohort conducted in 37 Brazilian hospitals located in 17 cities from five
Brazilian states (Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, São
Paulo). Patients were admitted from March 1 to September 30, 2020. COVID-19
diagnosis was laboratory-confirmed, according to the World Health Organization
guidance[14]. Details of the cohort were published elsewhere[15, 16].
For the present study, COVID-19 patients with ARDS refractory to standard
lung-protective ventilation and pronation and that received ECMO were selected.

Indications for ECMO support were at discretion of attending teams, according
to local protocols (Table 1). Public hospitals do not offer ECMO support in Brazil. In
all of them, the costs were paid by the family, and at that time there was no policy of
reimbursement of ECMO costs by health insurances in Brazil.
At the moment of the analysis, 7646 patients were introduced in the registry,
eight of those received ECMO support (0.1%). Patients were from four hospitals from
two cities, with average 149 beds (ranging from 103 to 211 beds) and 39 intensive care
unit beds(ranging from 30 to 51 beds). All of them were private hospitals and reference
centers for COVID-19 treatment.
Controls were randomly selected from the same hospitals, among patients who
had ARDS, needed to be treated at the intensive care unit and needed mechanical
ventilation and pronation.

Data collection
Demographic information, clinical characteristics, laboratory, imaging and
outcome data were collected from medical records by trained hospital staff or interns,
by using a prespecified case report form. Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)
tools[17] hosted at the Telehealth Center, University Hospital, Universidade Federal de
Minas Gerais. A detailed data management plan (DMP) was developed and provided to
all participating centers. An online DMP training was mandatory before local research
personnel could start collecting study data.
For the present analysis additional data of the ECMO procedure were collected:
date of indication, date of the first session, whether it was veno-venous (VV-ECMO) or
veno-arterial (VA-ECMO). Complications were already collected in the standardized
form.

Data quality assessment

We undertook comprehensive data quality checks to ensure high quality. Codes
were developed in R software to identify outliers’ values likely related to data entry
errors, based on expert-guided rules. Data was sent to each center for checking and
correction. For the present analysis, as ECMO was a rare procedure, all cases were rechecked before the final analysis.
Transfers from one participant hospital to another were merged and considered
as a single visit.

Statistical analysis
To adjust for potential confounding variables, we used propensity score
matching technique. Propensity scores were estimated by logistic regression, and the
model included gender, age, number of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
obesity, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation or flutter, cirrhosis,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer and previous stroke)[16], pronation,
ARDS and hospital. Genetic matching method (MatchIt package in R software) was
performed in a 5:1 ratio using generalized Mahalanobis distance with scaling factors
chosen based on the smallest p-value in covariate balance tests.
Categorical data were presented as absolute numbers and proportions, and
continuous variables were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges. The Fisher
Exact test was used to compare the distribution of categorical variables, and the
Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney test for continuous variables. Results were considered
statistically significant if the two-tailed P-value was < 0.05. All statistical analysis was
performed with R software (version 4.0.2).

pandemic situation and the use of deidentified data, based on medical chart review only.

Results

Patient characteristics at hospital admission
From the 48 patients included in the study (Figure 1), eight received ECMO
support during hospitalization, and 40 were matched controls. The median age of the
entire sample was 60 (52.0-68.0) years-old and 87.5% were male. Hypertension
(56.2%), diabetes mellitus (37.5%), obesity (22.9%), chronic heart failure (4.2%) were
the most frequent comorbidities.
When comparing patients who received ECMO support with controls, there were
no significant differences in demographic characteristics and comorbidities (Table 2).
Upon hospital admission, dyspnea, odynophagia and productive cough were present in
more than one half of patients. The median time since from symptom onset to hospital
admission was 6 (4.0-6.0) days. The two groups were similar in the clinical presentation
(Table 3).
There was no clinically relevant difference between the two groups concerning
laboratory findings upon hospital admission (Table 4). With regards to the radiological
findings, the low number of patients who underwent chest X-ray or CT-scan precluded
any definitive comparison (Supplemental Table 1).

There were no differences regarding the therapeutic strategy among both groups
(Table 5), except for a trend of higher frequency of antiarrhythmic, antifungic,
oseltamivir, statin (25.0% vs. 10.0%, p=0.258 for all of those) and hydroxycloroquine
(37.5 vs. 15.0%, p=0.159) use in ECMO patients when compared to controls. No patient
received remdesivir or tocilizumab.
Overall, the median time from admission to ICU was 1.0 (0-3.0) day and the
median hospital length of stay was 26.5 (IQR 15.5-44.2) days, and there was no
difference between groups. The ECMO used in all eight patients was venovenous (V V). The median time between stablishing criteria for ECMO and the initiation of the
therapy was 0 (0 - 1) days.
Mortality was higher in ECMO patients (87.5 vs. 42.5%, p=0.048). There were
no other significant differences in terms of clinical evolution and outcomes, despite a
trend of a higher frequency of sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation and
bleeding in the ECMO group (Table 6).
ECMO related complications were observed in three (37.5%) patients: one
patient (64 years-old, man) had severe bleeding in the cannulation site, kidney failure
and need of renal replacement therapy, one (75 years-old, man) had massive thrombosis
in the right atrium and the other (50 years-old, man) had kidney failure and need of
renal replacement therapy.

Discussion
This study describes a cohort of COVID 19 patients that received ECMO
support in ICU from hospitals belonging to a large Brazilian COVID-19 Registry study.
Overall, patients who received ECMO support had similar clinical characteristics,
laboratory and outcomes to that patients did not receive ECMO support, matched by

age, gender, number of comorbidities and hospital, except for a higher mortality and a
trend of a higher frequency of complications, such as sepsis, disseminated intravascular
coagulation and bleeding, in the ECMO group.
The use of ECMO as a rescue therapy in patients with severe ARDS secondary
to viral infections has been established in the literature. In a cohort of patients with
H1N1-related ARDS, Noah et al[18] demonstrated a hospital mortality of 23.7% for
ECMO treated patients vs 52.5% for controls. Furthermore, in a retrospective study on
MERS related ARDS, lower mortality was observed in the ECMO-treated cohort
compared to controls (65 vs 100%, p=0.02)[3]. However, the EOLIA trial, the largest
randomized controlled trial that evaluated the role of ECMO for ARDS, did not show a
difference in 60-day mortality in the ECMO group when compared to the conventional
management group (35 vs 46%, p=0.02)[4]. Two recent meta-analyses provided
evidence that support use of ECMO for ARDS in adults[5, 6].
The pandemic has been placing significant stress on health care systems around
the world, and hospitals were forced to prompt increase ICU capacity. Trained
professionals suffered from work overload, burn out, or got sick, and in some instances
inexperienced healthcare professionals had to assume positions. In this scenario,
provision of ECMO may be challenging from both resource and ethical points of
view[19]. The lack of full knowledge of the disease's behavior, and the best way to
approach it, the initial wait for a recovery that did not happen may have delayed the
indication and the beginning of ECMO support in those patients, and this may be one of
the reasons for our initial negative results, as well as the first series of literature. High
mortality in the initial published experience[13] led some clinicians and investigators to
recommend withholding ECMO support in patients with COVID-19[20]. Ruan et al[7]
evaluated 137 COVID-19 patients and seven patients were treated with ECMO and

there was 100% mortality despite ECMO use. Similar findings were reported by Zhou
et al[9] and Yang et al[8], who observed mortality of 83 and 100%, respectively, in
studies that included a very small number of patients.
It is well-known that COVID-19 mortality risk increases with increasing age and
comorbidities[16, 21, 22]. In the present study, the small sample size precluded the
assessment of specific risk factors for mortality in ECMO patients. Further studies are
required to analyze which factors increase the mortality risk in those patients, in order to
develop a proper patient care plan to try to reduce this high mortality.
It is not uncommon for patients on ECMO to develop acute kidney injury (AKI)
within the first 48-72 h. The ECMO circuit can lead to an inflammatory reaction and
subsequent AKI and renal replacement therapy simultaneously with ECMO can be
necessary. Lastly, platelet consumption and potassium, magnesium, and phosphorous
shifts have been observed in patients on ECMO and should be monitored and replaced
accordingly[23].
The ELSO Registry provides data on 1035 ECMO - supported patients with
COVID-19 who received care in 36 countries[12]. Estimated in-hospital mortality 90
days after ECMO initiation was 37.4% (95% CI 34·4–40·4), similar to previous
mortality rates in non-COVID-19 ECMO-supported patients with ARDS and acute
respiratory failure[4, 23], supporting the use of ECMO in COVID-19-related acute
hypoxemic respiratory failure. However, these findings cannot be extrapolated to
inexperienced centers. ELSO is clear in the recommendation against commissioning of
new ECMO centers for the purposes of treating COVID-19 patients[24]. The training of
the team, with ELSO certification, the multidisciplinary work, the 1: 1 patient per nurse
ratio and the 2:1 specialist per patient ratio positively impact the results, and are
essential requirements for the center to be accredited by the ELSO[24].

However, questions regarding its true role of ECMO remain unknown. The
ELSO recommends to the accredited centers to preferentially offer ECMO to patients in
whom outcomes are favorable (for example, those who are young, have a single organ
failure, and were previously healthy)[24], differently to what was done in clinical
practice, in this first phase of the pandemic.
Recently, Lebreton G. et al[25] presented the results of a well conduced study
from the Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Network, which involved 302 patients
who underwent ECMO from 17 Greater Paris intensive care units, between March 8 and
June 3, 2020. Before ECMO, 285 (94%) patients were prone positioned, median driving
pressure was 18 cm H2O (14−21), and median ratio of the partial pressure of arterial
oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen was 61 mm Hg (IQR 54−70). On ECMO, the
most common adverse effects were a major bleeding event, renal replacement therapy
and pulmonary embolism. Multiorgan failure were more frequently observed as causes
of death 90 days after ECMO. At the end of 90 days, in general 138 (46%) patients were
alive. Shorter time between intubation and ECMO, younger age (≤48 years), higher preECMO renal component of the SOFA score, and treatment in centers managing at least
30 venovenous ECMO cases annually were independently associated with improved 90day survival (60%), among ECMO-assisted patients with COVID-19 center’s
experience in venovenous ECMO during the previous year was a strongly predictor of
survival. Therefore, organization and experience are fundamental to best results in
patients with COVID-19 and severe ARDS requiring ECMO.
Other main factors that should be taken into consideration are its feasibility and
ethical dilemmas. In most parts of the world, patients may not be able to benefit from
this modality of treatment due to the lack of availability and its high cost. In this

Brazilian Registry which included 37 centers, only 0.1% of patients from four hospitals
were submitted to ECMO support.
The high cost associated with the ECMO use also may be considered as a
critical factor in the decision about using this technology and makes its inappropriate
use a high waste for the system (or families in the specific case from this Brazilian
cohort)[26]. In times when healthcare labor resources are scarce, it is of utmost
importance to consider that the elevated cost of using ECMO is not only associated with
the technology price, but much more in the demand for nursing and cardiology
assistants and for ICU beds that those patients require[27]. In a Dutch study, the mean
cost of ECMO patients was (Euros) 106.263 and 52% of these costs arose from nursing
care and only 11% from the ECMO surgery and materials[28]. In Brazil, a short cohort
study in 2018 demonstrated that ECMO materials and surgery represented 11% of the
cost per patient for surviving patients, 30% for those who died[29]. These previous
experiences highlight the importance of taking the right decision on using the
technology, at the right time.
Additionally, it is of utmost importance to consider all costs, not only the cost
and the right use of the equipment and the timely indication for the procedure, but also
the suitable hospital structure and trained human resources required for the best use of
the technology [26].
In the present study, all ECMO patients were submitted to veno-venous ECMO,
what is in line with a recent systematic review, in which the majority of COVID-19
patients who require ECMO were submitted to this modality (73%), while veno-arterial
ECMO were performed in a minority proportion of patients (3.3%), 2.5% moved

This study has limitations. First, it was not a randomised controlled trial and thus
we cannot draw any definitive conclusions as to whether ECMO should be used in
patients with COVID-19 and severe respiratory failure. However, our results are
consistent with previously reported survival rates in acute hypoxaemic respiratory
failure, supporting current ELSO recommendations that centres experienced in ECMO
should withhold its use in refractory COVID-19-related respiratory failure in situations
of healthcare system collapse. The ECMO may be demanding from both resource and
ethical points. In a crisis scenario, the allocation of resources, whether human or
financial, is challenging. Stricter selection criteria are recommended in order to use this
resource for patients with greater chances of recovery. ECMO is recommended for the
largest and certified centers only and it is not recommended when the system is
overwhelmed[24].
A lot of research is still needed to show the role of ECMO support in COVID19
patients' survival. In Brazil, in the second phase of the pandemic those centers may have
improved ECMO procedures, as they established protocols and tried to avoid delayed
indication, when it might have been too late to be of any benefit. We therefore
hypothesize that future analyzes of data from a second phase of the pandemic might
provide more encouraging mortality outcomes than those found in the first phase of
lesser expertise with ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and even less knowledge of the
disease in general.
The inclusion of ECMO as a procedure sponsored by the public health system is
presently being assessed by the Brazilian National Commission for the Incorporation of
Health Technology (CONITEC), but we believe that careful and adequate assessment of
clinical practice outcomes is of utmost importance before ECMO is incorporated for the

interesting results of the comparison of different phases of the pandemic.
