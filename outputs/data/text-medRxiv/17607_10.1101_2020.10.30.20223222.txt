Abstract
We aim at forecasting the outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy by using a two-part time
series to model the daily relative increments. Our model is based on the data
observed from 22 February to 8 April 2020 and its objective is forecasting 40 days
from 9 April to 18 May 2020. All the calculations, simulations, and results in the
present paper have been done in MatLab R2015b. The average curve and 80%
upper and lower bounds are calculated based on 100 simulations of the fitted
models. According to our model, it is expected that by May 18th, 2020, the relative
increment (RI) falls to the interval of 0.31% to 1.24% (average equal to 0.78%).
During the last three days of the studied period, the RI belonged to the interval
2.5% to 3%. Accordingly, It is expected that the new daily confirmed cases face a
decreasing to around 1900 on average. Finally, our prediction establishes that the
cumulative number of confirmed cases reaches 237635 (with 80% confidence
interval equal to [226340 248417] by May 18th, 2020.

Introduction
The COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei,
China in late December 2019. Until 8 April, around 1500,000 cases have been
confirmed in around 210 countries, with epicenters China, South Korea, Italy, Iran,
France, USA, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, UK, and Turkey, and over 87,000
people have died from the disease [1-2].
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the first confirmed case in Italy happened on 31
January 2020. On 22 February, the first death was reported, and by the beginning
of March, the virus had spread to all regions of Italy [1, 3]. Italy accompanied by
Iran simultaneously on 1 March 2020, jointed the first two epicenters of COVID19; China and South Korea. As of April 8th, Italy by 17669 deaths, has experienced
the most victims worldwide. Italy had gotten the most confirmed cases in Europe
until 4 April [2]. On 8 April 2020, Italy has gotten around 140 K confirmed cases.
Over the past few decades, numerous forecasting methods have been presented in
the area of epidemic forecasting. Such methods can be categorized into different
classes such as deterministic versus probabilistic, comparative versus generative,
macro-dynamic versus micro-dynamic, and so on [4]. One of the probabilistic
generative methods to study the epidemic data modeling by time series. The time
series models have long been of interest in the literature. The applied time series
models in this field are restricted to the ARIMA family, for example [5-8]. In
2020, Jamshidi et al [9] introduced a time series not belonging to ARIMA family
to model the decreasing relative increment of spreading of an outbreak. Jamshidi et
al [10] applied this model to represent the propagation of the pandemic COVID-19
in Iran. On 15 March 2020, they forecasted that the number of the confirmed cases
in Iran gets 71000 on average up to 15 April. Considering 66220 confirmed cases
until 9 April, It seems that the model works well.
Accordingly, we want to consider the spread of the pandemic in Italy by modelling
the relative increment of the confirmed cases by a two-part time series. The first
part for representing the propagation of the disease in the first period when the rate
of the transition is high, and the second part for the period of decreasing rate which

is indicated by an irreversible fall in the relative increment and continues to the
extinction of the disease [9]. It is noticeable that we make a change to correct the
model to be able to represent the behavior of the disease in the first period much
better. Since the relative increment in this period is much more chaotic, we take the
variance of the model as double the analogous in the model introduced by [9].

To estimate the parameters of the model, we can
- take as the first point that the geometric mean of the relative increments in
the previous points exceeds 3/2 times the geometric mean of the next three
points. Graphically, this time can be identified as the time when the plot of
relative increments falls irreversibly (Plot 1). In this case, it is resulted that

It is worth saying that All the calculations, simulations, and results in our paper
have been conducted in MatLab R2015b, and the average curve and 80% upper
and lower bounds are calculated based on 100 simulations of the fitted models.
You can see the power of fitting this model to our observations; the relative
increments of the cumulative number of confirmed cases infected by COVID-19 in
Italy from 23 February to 08 April 2020 (Plot 3).

Based on the obtained model, Plot 4 is obtained as a prediction of the variable of
interest for 09.04.2020 to 18.05.2020. Based on this prediction, the relative
increment decreases from 2.5% - 3% on 5-8 April to below 1% on 18 May. The
model forecasts 80% confidence interval as [0.31% - 1.24%] with the mean equal
to 0.78% for the relative increment on 18 May 2020 (Plot 4).

Accordingly, we get Plot 5, as our prediction of the number of new confirmed
cases daily from 09.04.2020 to 18.05.2020. Based on the model, the number of
new confirmed cases falls from 3836 cases on 8 April to around 1900 cases on 18
May 2020. The 80% confidence interval of this variable is 520 â€“ 4000.

Finally, we obtain Plot 6 as the predicted cumulative confirmed cases for the
studied period. We predicted that over the period 09 April to 18 May 2020, Italy
will face 100000 new confirmed cases on average where considering around
140000 cases on 08 April, the cumulative number of confirmed cases gets 237635.
It is noticeable that the 80% confidence interval for the predicted cumulative
number of confirmed cases on 18 May 2020 is 226340 to 248417.

Discussions
Due to several characteristics such as highly social citizens, fair weather, densely
populated cities, physically affectionate social interactions, and large elderly
population, Italy has witnessed a severe COVID-19â€™s explosion. As of 8 April
2020, Italy, with 0.8% of the population of the world, has composed over 9% of all
the confirmed cases and over 20% of the death toll from COVID-19.
Italy can be considered the first country to face the problem of the unpredictable
and unprecedented explosion of the pandemic. Fortunately, these days, statistics
establish that the country has managed to manage the disease to a large extent.
Although it is a long path to fight to be over. However, it is very helpful to
anticipate better for management and control of the disease. Accordingly, the
present paper has predicted the number of confirmed cases in the next 40 days
(April 9th to May 18th). This prediction can be applicable in plans of policymakers
regarding the management and hospitalization of the future infected people and the
readiness of the staff involved, and inviting people to consider the health points.
According to our model, it is expected that by May 18th, 2020, the relative
increment falls to the interval of 0.31% to 1.24% while on 8 April, it belonged to

the interval 2.5% to 3%. Accordingly, It is expected that the new daily confirmed
cases face a decreasing to around 1900 on average. Finally, our prediction
established that the cumulative number of confirmed cases reaches around 240 K
(with 80% confidence interval equal to [225 250] K by May 18th, 2020.
Finally, it is noticeable that the prediction is based on the assumption that the trend
is stable, and there is no doubt that more strict adherence by people can lower the
forecast, as well as non-compliance can lead to higher upward graphs.
