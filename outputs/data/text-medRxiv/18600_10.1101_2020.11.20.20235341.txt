Abstract

33

Background. Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 offer new opportunities

34

for the quick and laboratory-independent identification of infected individuals for control of

35

the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

36

Methods. We performed a prospective, single-center, point of care validation of two antigen-

37

detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) in comparison to RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs.

38

Findings. Between October 9th and 23rd, 2020, 1064 participants were enrolled. The PanbioTM

39

Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test device (Abbott) was validated in 535 participants, with 106 positive

40

Ag-RDT results out of 124 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 85.5% (95% CI:

41

78.0–91.2). Specificity was 100.0% (95% CI: 99.1–100) in 411 RT-PCR negative individuals. The

42

Standard Q Ag-RDT (SD Biosensor, Roche) was validated in 529 participants, with 170 positive

43

Ag-RDT results out of 191 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 89.0% (95%CI:

44

83.7–93.1). One false positive result was obtained in 338 RT-PCR negative individuals, yielding

45

a specificity of 99.7% (95%CI: 98.4–100). For individuals presenting with fever 1-5 days post

46

symptom onset, combined Ag-RDT sensitivity was above 95%.

47

Interpretation. We provide an independent validation of two widely available commercial Ag-

48

RDTs, both meeting WHO criteria of ≥80% sensitivity and ≥97% specificity. Although less

49

sensitive than RT-PCR, these assays could be beneficial due to their rapid results, ease of use,

50

and independence from existing laboratory structures. Testing criteria focusing on patients

51

with typical symptoms in their early symptomatic period onset could further increase

52

diagnostic value.

Introduction

56

The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) which causes Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19),

57

has led to an unprecedented pandemic and a global public health crisis. Developing diagnostic

58

strategies that are easily accessible, provide rapid results and are of low cost to allow use in

59

resource limited settings is critical in order to control the pandemic. While RT-PCR based

60

detection remains the standard for the detection of emerging respiratory viruses (1,2), the

61

global need for virus detection methods has fueled research and development of diagnostic

62

tests, including as Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT), that can be performed at

63

the point of care (POC) (3).

64

Such laboratory-independent tests could be key to detecting acutely infected and especially

65

contagious individuals, allowing for control of the pandemic by quickly isolating individuals

66

during their contagious period to prevent further transmission. These tests can also help

67

overcome bottlenecks such as overwhelmed diagnostic laboratories and global shortages of

68

PCR reagents, while being affordable (4). Ag-RDTs could enable mass screenings, which allow

69

estimation of active infection prevalence, and confirming a COVID-19 diagnosis especially in

70

settings where results are not available in a timely manner (5). Given that viral load, as

71

measured by RNA levels, peaks near symptom onset (6–8) and contagiousness can begin days

72

before symptom onset (9,10), it is expected that RDTs would have the highest sensitivity (SN)

73

in those infected individuals that are most contagious. However, reported SNs of Ag-RDTs vary

74

widely, and manufacturer reported SNs are often substantially higher than the SNs reported

75

by independent assessments (11). The World Health Organisation (WHO) has published an Ag-

76

RDT target product profile, aiming at SN ≥80% and a specificity (SP) of ≥97% (5,12). Thus, we

77

sought to evaluate the performance of two commercially available Ag-RDTs through a

prospective, single-center POC validation in comparison to RT-PCR for detecting SARS-CoV-2

79

using nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) under real-life conditions.

81

Methods

82

Ethics

83

The study was approved by the Cantonal ethics committee (Nr. 2020-02323). All study

84

participants and/or their legal guardians provided written informed consent.

85
86

Setting

87

The study was performed in two geographically different testing centres in Geneva, run by our

88

institution, the Geneva University Hospitals: one adjacent to the University hospital (“Sector

89

E”) and the other located in another part of the city (“Sector G”) between October 9th and

90

October 23rd, 2020. Both centres are supervised by the same team, and did not differ in their

91

infrastructure, so we analyzed them as a single centre study.

92
93

Study design and participants

94

The primary objective of this prospective study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy (SN and

95

SP) of the Ag-RDTs compared to the reference RT-PCR. All individuals presenting to the testing

96

centres were informed about the study and enrolled if they consented. Participants were ≥16

97

years of age, with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection according to the local governmental testing

98

criteria. This included suggestive symptoms for COVID-19 and/or recent exposure to a SARS-

99

CoV-2 positive person. Asymptomatic individuals were included if they were notified by the

100

Swiss COVID-19 app about a contact offering the option to get tested on day 5 after contact,

101

or if they received a notification from local health authorities (screening of people with high

102

risk exposure in a cluster).

103
104

Study procedures

105

For each participant, two NPS were collected. The first was a standard flocked swab placed in

106

viral transport media (VTM), used routinely for viral genome detection by RT-PCR. The second

107

NPS, provided in the Ag-RDT kit, was obtained from the contralateral nostril and was

108

performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Both swabs were taken by the same

109

trained nurse. All Ag-RDTs were performed immediately at the sample collection site.

110

Adequate personal protective equipment was used while collecting the NPSs and performing

111

the RDTs.

112
113

Data collection

114

Clinical data were collected for each patient upon presentation with a questionnaire including

115

the number of days post symptom onset (DPOS), known contact to a previous SARS-CoV-2

116

infected person, comorbidities and type of symptoms. The following symptoms were

117

recorded: rhinorrhea (runny nose), odynophagia, myalgia, chills, dry cough, productive cough,

118

red expectoration, fever (anamnestic), anosmia/ageusia (loss of smell or taste),

119

gastrointestinal symptoms, asthenia, dyspnea, thoracic pain and headache.

120

Comorbidities included in the questionnaire were hypertension, cardiovascular disease,

121

chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, chronic renal failure, active cancer including

122

lymphoproliferative disease, severe immunosuppression, immunosuppressive therapy,

123

pregnancy, and obesity (BMI >40 kg/m2).

125

Ag-RDT testing

126

The two validated Ag-RDTs were Panbio Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test device (Abbott Rapid

127

Diagnostics) and Standard Q (SD Biosensor, Roche). Both Ag-RDTs were used as recommended

128

by the manufacturers, using only materials provided by the manufacturers in the kits. Both

129

assays were manually read, with two individuals reading the results separately after the

130

indicated time. In case of discordant results, the two validators sought a consensus. All visible

131

bands were considered a positive result. All Ag-RDT results were photographically

132

documented.

133
134

RT-PCR testing

135

All participants were tested by a dual target RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 (Cobas, Roche) using

136

NPS in 3mL VTM. For further analysis, only cycle threshold (Ct) values for the E-gene were

137

used. For calculation of viral loads (VL) as SARS-CoV-2 genome copy numbers per mL, a

138

standard curve was obtained by using a quantified supernatant from a cell culture isolate of

139

SARS-CoV-2. All VLs were calculated from the Ct-values, according to log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA

140

copies/ml = (Ct-44.5)/-3.3372 for Cobas (13,14).

141
142

Statistics

143

We enrolled all patients who met the SARS-CoV-2 testing criteria, over a 2-week period. During

144

the first and second week, 529 and 535 patients were enrolled respectively. The target sample

145

size was 530, as it would have sufficient power to generate a 95% confidence interval (CI) with

146

a lower bound above the WHO target of 80%, if the prevalence was 25% and the measured SP

147

was ≥87.5%.

148

All continuous variables were presented by their mean ±standard deviation (SD) and median

149

(interquartile range, IQR), categorical variables were presented by their frequencies and

150

relative proportions. For comparisons of continuous variables, we used a nonparametric

151

Mann-Whitney test due to small sizes; for comparisons of categorical variables, we either

152

performed Chi2 or Fischer’s exact tests, depending on applicability.

153

To enable Ag-RDT result combination, we performed a Bayesian t-test on their sensitivities

154

and specificities. To be able to conduct the t-test, the confidence intervals of both sensitivities

155

and specificities were converted into standard deviation to allow for the t-test to be

156

conducted. The test computes a Bayesian Factor (BF) that allows comparison of the probability

157

of observing our data under H0 (both tests are equal in term of SN and SP) and H1 (both tests

158

are different). All analyses were performed using STATA version intercooled 16 (Stata Corp.,

159

College Station, TX, USA). Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05 (two-sided).

160
161

Results

162

Between October 9th and October 23rd, 2020, 1064 participants were enrolled and included in

163

the analysis. 535 participants were tested with the Panbio Ag-RDT from October 09th to 16th

164

and 529 participants were tested with the Standard Q Ag-RDT from October 19th to 23rd, 2020.

165

The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. The

166

mean age of the study participants was 34.9 years (SD ±10.9) with 53.8% being female. The

167

mean DPOS to testing was 2.7 (SD ±1day). Overall, 29.6% of participants were positive by RT-

168

PCR with a mean Ct-value of 22.5 (SD ±5.1), corresponding to a VL of 1.8E7 SARS-CoV-2

169

copies/mL. Most patients (97.8%) were symptomatic upon presentation at the testing centre,

170

with only 3 reporting no symptoms. Symptoms information was missing for 4 patients. The

171

study population tested with the Standard Q vs. was younger than that tested with the Panbio

172

assay (34.9 ±10.9 vs 38.5 ±13.6 years, respectively, p<0.001) and DPOS differed slightly

173

(2.9±1.5 vs. 2.6±2.0 days, respectively, p=0.0125). Ct-values did not differ significantly

174

between the two groups (p=0.450): 22.6 (SD ±4.9) in the Standard Q group vs. 22.4 (SD ±5.4)

175

in the Panbio group, corresponding to 1.7E7 and 1.9E7 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/mL,

176

respectively. The RT-PCR positivity rate was 23.2% and 36.1% for the population tested with

177

the Panbio and the Standard Q, respectively, corresponding to an increase in the overall PCR

178

positivity rate and reflecting the rapidly increasing local incidence during the time of this

179

study.

180

The overall test performance for the Standard Q was 89.0% SN (95%CI: 83.7-93.1) and 99.7%

181

SP (95%CI: 98.4-100%). The overall test performance for the Panbio assay was 85.5% SN

182

(95%CI: 78.0-91.2) and 100% SP (95%CI: 99.1-100) (Table 2).

183

Ct-values of samples with positive Ag-RDT results ranged from 14.2-34.0 and 14.4-34.2 for

184

Panbio and Standard Q (p=0.1766), respectively, while Ct-values of samples of samples tha

185

tested falsely negative by Ag-RDT ranged from 16.0-39.7 and 19.8-37.4 (p=0.7998),

186

respectively. Median Ct-values of Ag-RDT positive samples (Panbio: 20.4, IQR: 18.1-23.8;

187

Standard Q: 21.2, IQR 18.6-24) were lower than those of Ag-RDT negative samples (Panbio:

188

30.5, IQR: 27-35.9; Standard Q: 30.4, IQR: 25.7-33.9) (Figure 1). Furthermore, we evaluated

189

overall Ag-RDT results in relation to Ct-values/viral load as well DPOS (Figure 2). False-negative

190

results occurred in both assay across all DPOS.

191

We compared SN and SP between the two Ag-RDTs and concluded that we could accept, with

192

high probabilities, (respectively likelihood ratio of BF01=10.2 and 11.9) the hypothesis of

193

equivalent SN and SP. Based on this, a combined SN of 87.6% (95%CI: 83.5-91.0) and a

194

combined SP of 99.9% (95%CI: 99.3-100) for both Ag-RDTs were calculated with a positive

195

predictive value of 99.6% (95%CI: 98.0-100) and a negative predictive value of 95.0% (95%CI:

196

93.3-96.5). In order to identify subpopulations in which maximal SN could be reached with

197

these tests, we analyzed SN by DPOS, Ct-values as determined by RT-PCR, type of symptoms,

198

comorbidities, and previous contact with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

199

Combined SN varied according to Ct-values: it was highest in samples with low Ct-values, with

200

a SN of 98.4% (95% CI: 94.2-99.8) for Ct ≤20 (≤1.0E8 SARS-CoV-2 copies/mL), decreased slightly

201

to 95.5% (95%CI: 89.9-98.5) for 20 < Ct ≤25 (<1.0E8 SARS-CoV-2 copies/mL ≤ 3.2E6), dropped

202

further to 89.9% (95%CI: 86.0-93.0) for Ct ≤35 (≤3.2 E3 SARS-CoV-2 copies/mL) and was lowest

203

(only 40.9% (95%CI: 20.7-63.6)) for 30< Ct ≤35 (<1.0E5 SARS-CoV-2 copies/mL ≤3E3) (Figure

204

3). The SN for all samples with a Ct value ≤26.7 (≤1E6 SARS-CoV-2 copies/mL), an assumed cut-

205

off for presence of infectious virus, was 95.7% (95%CI: 92.4-97.8).

206

SN increased with DPOS, from 88.2% at 0 DPOS (95%CI: 63.6-98.5) to 94.3% (95%CI: 84.3-98.8,

207

p=0.030) at 1 DPOS, and remained high until 5 DPOS. The highest SN was seen between 1

208

DPOS and 4-5 DPOS, ranging from 94.3% (95%CI: 84.3-98.8) to 94.8% (95%CI: 85.6-98.9), with

209

a decline after 5 DPOS (Figure 4A).

210

Additionally, we analyzed SN according to specific symptoms, differentiating between typical

211

COVID-19 symptoms (fever/chills, cough and anosmia/ageusia) and more non-specific

212

symptoms of respiratory infection (all other symptoms reported). The highest SN of 93.8%

213

(87.0-97.7) was observed for patients presenting with fever/chills and cough at the time of

214

testing, followed by patients presenting with anosmia/ageusia or cough and fever/chills with

215

a SN of 93.7% (95%CI: 87.4-97.4), but only 73.8% (95%CI: 58.0-86.1) in patients presenting

216

with non-specific signs (Figure 4B). No difference in SN was seen between patients with

217

(89.3%, 95%CI: 71.8-97.7, n=28) or without (87.5%, 95%CI: 83.1-91.1, n=287) comorbidities

218

(p=0.999). Typical symptoms were more frequent in patients with comorbidities (100%, 15/15

219

patients) than in patients without comorbidities (86.5%, 96/138 patients) (p=0.012), however

(95%CI: 91.0-98.4).

Discussion

225

This study provides an independent, POC validation of two commercial Ag-RDTs in comparison

226

to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and according to demographic and clinical information. This combined

227

validation of two similar assays provides performance data in a real-life high incidence test

228

setting with an approach aimed at an immediate implementation solution.

229

Both RDTs performed well with an overall SN of 87.6% (95%CI: 83.5-91) and a very high SP of

230

99.9% (95%CI: 99.3-100) in our test setting during a time of very high SARS-CoV-2 weekly

231

incidence (375/100,000 to 824/100,000 inhabitants) and a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity rate

232

>20%. SN was higher in sub-populations with earlier DPOS numbers and characteristic COVID-

233

19 symptoms. Importantly we highlight that on day 0 of symptoms, the SN may be lower than

234

during the subsequent days, and as expected, the sensitivity drops rapidly when the Ct-values

235

increase above a threshold of 30, mostly after 6-7 days. These results suggest that with

236

increasing availability, Ag-RDTs can enable rapid and reliable identification of SARS-CoV-2

237

cases and hold a promise for more efficient control of the current pandemic, independent of

238

existing diagnostic structures.

239

The highest VL and thus the highest SARS-CoV-2 transmission probability occurs within the

240

first week of symptom onset, with VLs peaking shortly before or at the time of symptom onset

241

(6). Culturable virus has been predominantly found in the first week after symptom onset, up

242

to a VL in the range of 1E6 copies/ml (14–17). This cut-off was also chosen by WHO in their

243

Ag-RDT target product profile guide for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics (12). The SN of the Ag-RDTs

244

validated here, for patients presenting with a VL compatible with contagiousness, was 95.7%.

245

Correspondingly, the highest Ag-RDT SN was also observed at early DPOS numbers and in

246

patients with low Ct-values, again suggesting reliable identification of contagious individuals.

247

Our findings at the POC are in line with other validations performed across countries and at

248

different SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, although study designs and specimens used varied

249

considerably between studies. Standard Q was reported to have SNs between 70.6-88.7%,

250

while SP remained high throughout these studies between 97.6-100% (18–24). A clinical study

251

performed similarly to ours in a much lower-incidence setting (<1% RT-PCR positivity rate),

252

found a SN/SP of 76.6%/100%, using a mixture of NPS and combined oro- and naso-pharyngeal

253

swabs from a total of 2417 participants with 47 RT-PCR positive samples yielding 36 Ag-RDT

254

(18).

255

For Panbio, other studies have reported SNs ranging from 73.3-91.7% with SP in the range of

256

94.9-100% (25–28). Notably, the highest reported SN of 91.7%/98.9% comes from a study

257

using 1,406 frozen archived NPS specimens of which 951 were positive by RT-PCR. However

258

here tests were not done at the POC, and although the use of frozen samples is possible for

259

RDTs (depending on manufacturers recommendation and on viral transport medium used), it

260

is not their intended use (19,25). It is also unknown if a freeze-thaw cycle can affect the

261

accessibility of viral antigens for Ag-RDT purposes.

262

While significant variation in overall SN is observed for the validated Ag-RDTs across studies,

263

there is remarkable similarity when comparing samples with Ct-values in the same range –

264

although caution must be exercised equating Ct-values to VLs across different studies. When

265

considering Ct-values of <25, the Standard Q test was reported to have a SN of 100% (18),

266

while the Panbio was reported to have a SN of 97.1% (27) or 98.2% (25), which is in agreement

267

with our results of 97%. In contrast to most other validations, we did observe some cases of

268

false-negative Ag-RDT results in patients with low Ct-values/high VLs across a range of DPOS.

269

It is likely that these patients are contagious and could transmit SARS-CoV-2, with VLs that are

270

compatible with culturable virus.

271

We did not find any validation of Ag-RDTs that has analyzed SN based on type of symptoms,

272

which could be an additional factor for testing algorithms. Our data suggests that the best SN

273

is found in symptomatic individuals with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, early in the

274

disease between day 1 and 5. The presence of only non-specific symptoms of respiratory

275

illness corresponded to lower SN, however, few study participants had no COVID-19 specific

276

symptoms at all.

277

Our study has several strengths. The Ag-RDTs were performed at the POC in parallel to RT-

278

PCR, and is one of the largest in terms of RT-PCR positive individuals. The test population was

279

mainly young adults without comorbidities, who mostly had typical COVID-19 symptoms that

280

were still mild enough not to require hospitalization. This represents a population screened

281

for public health intervention, and not for diagnostic purposes in a hospital setting; and the

282

majority of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at the current phase of the epidemic in the

283

community, which is an important group for early identification to limit viral transmission.

284

Thus, the results of our study support implementing the Ag-RDTs in a decentralized manner

285

for community testing, which could significantly alleviate the burden on diagnostic

286

laboratories and hospital staff.

287

Although Ag-RDTs are less sensitive than RT-PCR and, in our study, false-negative Ag-RDT

288

results were also seen in patients with high VL, the public health benefit of quickly identifying

289

a large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals in the community would still outweigh

290

the disadvantages of occasional missed diagnoses (29). Repeatedly testing and following

291

general recommendations like self-isolation for symptomatic individuals, even after a negative

292

Ag-RDT would probably largely prevent further spread from individuals who had false-

293

negative results. In a high prevalence situation like ours, positive Ag-RDTs have a high positive-

294

predictive value, while negative results are less reliable, and thus negative-results should not

295

be used for rule-out purposes or for any kind of reduced infection prevention measures. The

296

lower SN found at 0 DPOS was probably due to a still increasing VL. Re-testing with an Ag-RDT

297

or RT-PCR, in case of persisting symptoms, could overcome this limitation.

298

Furthermore, our validation showed very high SP, with only one false-positive Ag-RDT result

299

in an overall sample of 315 RT-PCR positive patients. Interestingly, the patient with this

300

putative false-positive result returned 3 days later because of persisting respiratory

301

symptoms, and then tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR.

302

During the time this study was conducted, the Canton of Geneva was experiencing a severe

303

second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with a very high incidence as well as high RT-PCR

304

positivity rates, thus extrapolating the findings of our study to low prevalence settings must

305

be done with caution. Furthermore, our study population consisted mainly of young

306

symptomatic individuals in an outpatient setting, thus diagnostic performance in other groups

307

needs further validation. All diagnostic testing was performed on NPS collected by trained

308

nurses, thus the use of the test with other materials (e.g. anterior nares swabs) or in other

309

settings (e.g. self-testing) needs to be further validated, however a first study on anterior nasal

310

samples showed promising results (30). Due to logistical and ethical reasons, we were not able

311

to perform paired comparisons of both Ag-RDTs at the same time by taking three separate

312

NPS, which would have helped to control for prevalence variation and inter-cohort variability.

313

Nonetheless, we used robust methods to confirm that the SN and SP of both Ag-RDTs was

314

equivalent, and further combined results of both Ag-RDTs.

315

In conclusion, we show good diagnostic accuracy of both Ag-RDTs, especially for rule-in

316

purposes of infected individuals and in testing patients with defined clinical criteria. The SN
