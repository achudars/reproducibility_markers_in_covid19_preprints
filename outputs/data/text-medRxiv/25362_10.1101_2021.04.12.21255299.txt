Abstract
BACKGROUND
Fast identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected individuals is
a strategically vital task to ensure correct management and quarantine. Rapid antigen test could be a
supplement to the standard-of-care Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT). The aim of this study was to
determine the accuracy of the BD Veritor SARS-CoV-2 antigen test as a screening instrument in a hospital
setting.
METHODS
A cohort of prospective samples were collected from hospital staff and patients at the Emergency,
Infectious Diseases and Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine departments at Hvidovre Hospital. All samples
were collected using oropharyngeal swabs, and BD Veritor Antigen test results were paired with routine
NAAT test results. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the antigen test were
calculated using NAAT as reference.
RESULTS
Overall, 809 samples from 674 individuals were included (average age 45 years, range 0-98 years). Among
all samples, 8% were SARS-CoV-2 positive by NAAT testing and 5.3% by BD Veritor. The sensitivity of the
antigen test was 63.1% and specificity 99.7%. The positive predictive value was 95.3%. False-positive rate
was 4%. The cycle threshold value was significantly higher among individuals with false negative antigen
tests compared to true positives.
CONCLUSION
The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values show that the BD Veritor antigen test from
oropharyngeal collected specimens performs well. Antigen testing may be a supplement, but not
substitute, to NAAT testing as the primary diagnostic modality in hospital settings where fast turnaround
test results may assist in decisions regarding isolation and quarantine.

Introduction
Fast and easy-to-perform diagnostic methods is of high priority to curb the Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic. As the pandemic enters its 2nd year, the political focus in many countries including
Denmark is on easy test accessibility, fast time-to-result, accurate tests and cost-efficiency. Even when
vaccination is fully rolled-out, it is anticipated that severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) testing will remain a pivotal public health measure the coming years. The reference standard for
SARS-CoV-2 testing is Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) targeting the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 in
upper-respiratory specimens and performed in centralized laboratory settings 1, 2. NAAT systems deliver
test-to-result in 2 to 6 hours depending on circumstances and this time-to-result has obtained widespread
acceptance as a premise of protecting public health by identifying infected individuals and referring them
into quarantine. However, many SARS-COV-2 test situations benefit from point-of-care testing (POCT) with
fast time-to-result.
In a hospital setting, rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is a strategically vital task to
ensure correct clinical management, precaution management, isolation or quarantine of SARS-CoV-2
positive patients. SARS-CoV-2 carriers pose a potential risk to healthcare professionals who are in close
contact with the patient during examinations or treatments for non-COVID-19 as well as COVID-19-related
conditions, and constitute a risk to other patients in e.g. common waiting areas and shared hospital rooms
in high through-put Emergency Departments were a flow-culture is prominent3.
Antigen tests are immunoassays that detect a specific viral antigen. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection
(RAD) tests can be performed as a POCT, are easy to administer, and the results are typically available
within 15-20 minutes. Combined with the solid political focus, especially on time-to-result and scalability, it
has resulted in the implementation of SARS-CoV-2 antigen POCT in public and private test settings. The RAD
test market is booming as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic unfolds4, 5, but qualitative data on their performance is
limited and biased by test cohort characteristics6. SARS-CoV-2 antigen POCT is a promising instrument to
optimize SARS-CoV-2 control in conjuncture with NAAT test regimens, but principal concerns regarding
antigen test performance include low sensitivity, reproducibility, and low positive predictive value, all
depending on specific circumstances6, 7.
This study aimed to conduct a clinical performance validation of the BD Veritor antigen Rapid test (Veritor)
using oropharyngeal swabs from hospital staff and patients (inpatients and outpatients). The majority of
tested were without COVID-19 symptoms tested as a routine screening.

Material and Methods
Study cohort and Sample collection
The study was performed at Amager-Hvidovre Hospital (AHH), Copenhagen, Denmark, between December
2020 and March 2021.
A cohort of prospective collected samples from hospital staff and patients with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status
arriving at the Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, or the Emergency Department. The
cohort was enriched with a smaller cohort of patients with known, recently NAAT confirmed SARS-CoV-2
positivity from the Department of Infectious Diseases to increase the number of positive specimens.
All samples were obtained by oropharyngeal swab (throat swab) in accordance with the Danish National
Health Authority guidance for testing of SARS-CoV2. Similarly, a dedicated throat swab was used for the
Veritor antigen test (FLOQSwab, Copan Diagnostics, Italy). All patients were handled according to guidelines
as per their SARS-CoV-2 NAAT status. The Veritor result did not affect the management.

BD VERITOR Ag Rapid test and reference test systems
The “BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2“ is a chromatographic lateral flow immunoassay
for the qualitative detection of nucleocapsid antigens in a respiratory specimen. The dedicated Veritor
throat swab was resuspended for 15´sec in the provided test tube containing a virus transport medium that
neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 virus to a non-infectious level8. The test cassette incubates for 15 minutes in the BD
Veritor analyzer (VA) and the result is reported by the VA. Patient ID was scanned into the VA ensuring safe
patient ID identification. The manufacturer reports a test specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 84%
compared to qRT-PCR as a reference standard during the first 5 days after disease onset for use on
superficial nasal specimens (Manufacturers insert).
SARS-CoV-2 NAAT testing was part of the routine diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2 testing performed at either the
Department of Clinical Microbiology, AHH or Testcenter Danmark, Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen.
Three hospital SARS-COV-2 NAAT test systems were in routine operation during the data collection period:
Cobas FLOW, BGI, and Hologic Panther Aptima® SARS-CoV-2 Assay. For Cobas FLOW, oropharyngeal
samples were tested by RT-PCR targeting the E-gene applying the E-Sarbeco primers and probe9 and
adapted to TaqMan Fast Virus 1-step master mix and LightCycler 48010. BGI and Hologic testing were
according to the manufacturer´s specifications. Interpretation of NAAT results were by a commercial FDA
approved NAAT with automatic calling of positive or negative results or by PCR with manual inspection of
the amplification curve for all positive samples. Only positive PCR samples with an unambiguous
amplification curve were registered as positive. Any of these three NAAT assays were used as reference
standard for the evaluation the accuracy of Veritor.

Data analysis
Sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value
(PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), false
positive rates were calculated using NAAT as
reference. A box plot depicting the Cycle
Threshold (Ct) scores between concordant and
discordant PCR-to-Veritor samples (limited to
Cobas FLOW and BGI results) were analyzed in
GraphPad Prism version 9.

Statistical power
The cohort size was determined on >80% power
to detect a 5% difference in sensitivity between
PCR and the antigen POCT. A SARS-CoV-2
positivity rate of <2% with an increasing trend was
assumed. Based on the above, at least 773 paired
samples were required.

record H-20080005). The selected SARS-CoV-2
positive patients’ samples were collected through
the out-patient research team (H-20028292).

Results
In total, 971 Veritor samples were collected from 779 persons (Figure 1). Samples with a Veritor test (index)
and a reference NAAT test result within ±5 days were included. Twelve samples were included with a time
difference between index and reference test >5 ≤10 days based on the premise that the paired reference
was the only available and that results were concordant. Ninety-one samples were excluded due to no
matching reference test. Seven samples were excluded due to incorrect personal identifiers. Forty-nine
samples were excluded as multiple samples collected from the same subject within a 24 hours window.
Eleven samples were excluded due to a history of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 positivity rendering the patient
irrelevant for antigen test. Four samples were excluded based on insufficient sampling material. Seventytwo individuals were tested twice or more during the study period (11%, Figure 1). The Department of
Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine provided 49 samples from in- and outpatients (average age; 3.8 years,

years) from patients and staff seen at the Corona Assessment Clinic or in The Emergency Department. The
Department of Infectious Diseases provided 29 samples from individuals visited at home. These individuals
had a recent positive NAAT test for SARS-CoV-2. In total, paired test results from 809 samples in 674
individuals were included (average age 45 years, range 0-98 years).

Discussion
The overall sensitivity of the Veritor test was 63.1%. Though seemingly unimpressive at first glance, the
Veritor test performs at par with similar antigen test evaluated on the general Danish population11 or
similar studies with cohorts not dominated by symptomatic persons6, 12-14. For the group with known,
recent NAAT confirmed SARS-CoV-2, the Veritor test provided a sensitivity of 74% (N=29). The sensitivity
amongst individuals with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status was 57% (N=780). In comparison, the recent Danish
study by Jakobsen et al. using the BioSensor antigen test found a sensitivity of 78% for persons with selfreported symptoms, versus 49% amongst people without self-reported symptoms11. The specificity of the
Veritor test was found to be uniformly high with 99.7% for the overall cohort, and 99.9% in individuals with
unknown SARS-CoV-2 status at time of testing.
Amongst those with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status, the Veritor test stands out for the very high PPV of 96%
and low Veritor test false-positive rate of 4.0%, which provides confidence that a positive Veritor finding is
indeed SARS-CoV-2 positive. This is in contrast to the asymptomatic cohort of the Jakobsen study11 where
the PPV of the BioSensor antigen test was 72.5%. Finally, the NPV of 97.6% is at par with the majority of

antigen test evaluated6, with the caveat that high NPV values are driven by the relatively low SARS-CoV-2
prevalence in ours and other´s studies.
Our study cohort is defined by all individuals being in- and outpatients at the Emergency-, Pediatrics- or
Infectious Diseases departments and staff undergoing routine testing. The age range is from 5 days old to
98 years. The broad age spectrum contrast with similar studies, most of which only included persons 18
years or older (Table 3), demonstrating the easy operationalization of the Veritor antigen test using a throat
collected specimen. The SARS-CoV-2 prevalence by NAAT, overall and amongst persons with unknown
SARS-CoV-2 status, was 8.1% and 5.5%, respectively. The prevalence reflects the hospital setting, the
enrichment with recently diagnosed, NAAT confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, and a peak prevalence
of SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark at the time.
Veritor test negative/PCR positive cases had significantly higher Ct scores indicating a lower viral load of the
discordant samples compared to the Veritor-to-PCR concordant samples (Figure 2). This is in line with
earlier studies of various antigen test system performance11-13, 15-17. In the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2
peak viral load is observed at the time of symptom onset and subsequently declines18, 19. In a clinical update
by Cevik et al.20 they conclude that the highest infectiousness potential of SARS-CoV-2 is up to 5 days of
symptom onset, but that NAAT tests continue to be positive for a mean of 17 days. Furthermore, Pekosz
and colleagues using cell culture demonstrated that the Veritor test had similar performance in detecting
replicating SARS-CoV-2 infections as PCR21. Nevertheless, as PCR/NAAT is more sensitive than antigen tests
or viral cell culture and as human-to-human transmission may occur at even lower levels than observed in
cell culture, NAAT remain the reference standard for detection of SARS-CoV-2. From a hospital setting
perspective where a fast time-to-result turnaround is required, a positive antigen test should lead to
isolation without awaiting confirmatory NAAT testing, whereas a negative antigen test result combined
with a SARS-CoV-2 negative clinical evaluation should await NAAT confirmation as the Veritor test cannot
exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Comparing antigen test performance across studies is hampered by dissimilarities in study design, cohort
characteristics, age, sample collection sites, and reference NAAT test. Table 3 presents antigen test systems
in use in Denmark, and it is noteworthy that manufacturer-provided performance data stem from cohorts
dominated by very high COVID-19 symptomatic rates resulting in high clinical assay sensitivity estimates
not confirmable by real-life, manufacturer-independent studies11-13. From a practical perspective,
confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with overt COVID-19 symptoms remains an essential yet minor
diagnostic application in absolute numbers. The largest application of antigen testing is screening of
predominantly asymptomatic persons as part of efforts to curb dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
society in general and characterized by low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence the current level of
manufacturer-provided documentation and studies focusing on symptomatic cohorts are at best

insufficient to guide on antigen test performance in a predominantly non-infected populations undergoing
screening by antigen testing.
Our study used an oropharyngeal (throat) collected specimen, which is off-label according to the
manufacturers’ specifications and other published studies11-13, 17. In Denmark, the National Board of Health
recommends throat swabs as the preferential sampling site for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, the
emergence of antigen testing has forced the implementation of nose swabs in Denmark given the lack of
data validating antigen tests for throat collected specimens. Combining our study with the Van der Moeren
study17, the Veritor antigen test could allow the choice of either a throat or nose swab, whatever is
preferred by the individual undergoing testing. Moreover, from an operationalization point-of-view, if a
patient must undergo an oropharyngeal collected sample for a SARS-CoV-2 NAAT test, then it is possible to
do a Veritor antigen test in the same procedure, so that the patient gets two procedures in one test
situation.
In a Hospital POCT setting, we found the BD Veritor Antigen test system simple and easily operationalized
with positive user experience feed-back. A strength of this study was that the testing was real-life, POCT at
multiple departments and the enrollment of samples were representative of the patients seen at the
participating departments. All samples were completed immediately on-site, and no frozen or preserved
specimens were included. Our POCT setting distinguishes this study from studies using centralized sample
testing6 or stored samples. The VA unit provides a layer of safe patient identification as the health
insurance card is scanned to link patient ID and sample allowing for systematic data reporting. The Veritor
test capacity is easily scalable and performs similar whether it is employed using the VA unit or using visual
reading of the test cassette17. The test buffer supplied neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 virus22 which is a safety
feature for the staff operating the test system.
All samples were oropharyngeal specimens. This eliminate the potential bias of comparing clinical assay
performance between nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, nasal, oral or saliva samples. Moreover, access to
centralized test databases allowed a detailed record of previous SARS-CoV-2 tests at the individual subject
level. A limitation of the study was the comprehensive NAAT technologies for concurrent NAAT testing of
reference samples reflecting the real-life hospital situation. This nevertheless limited the power of the Ctanalysis by reducing the number of samples where a Ct score could be retrieved. Regarding Ct score, a
general limitation of ours and other´s studies is the interpretation of Ct scores with respect to calling
positive cases given the lack of international standardization of PCR Ct values6. WHO recently issued a
notice of concern regarding interpretation of specimens at or near the limit for PCR detection23. A strength
of our study was that all positives are called after manual inspection of curves. Yet until joint international
standards are agreed, performance evaluations of antigen tests with NAAT as reference standard will
benefit NAAT testing in terms of sensitivity.

Conclusion
In summary, the BD Veritor antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 detection performs well in a hospital POCT setting
and could encourage re-thinking whether antigen tests can be used for rapid screening to manage
inpatients and outpatients while SARS-CoV-2 status is confirmed by NAAT testing. The very high PPV and
NPV in the group of persons with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status jointly demonstrate that the Veritor antigen
test represents an analytical improvement for mass-screening compared to the antigen tests recently
employed in Denmark. The Veritor antigen tests may serve as a supplement where fast turnaround test
results can assist and aide in making clinical decisions regarding SARS-CoV-2 isolation and quarantine but
antigen test in general cannot substitute NAAT testing as the primary diagnostic modality for the diagnosis
and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
