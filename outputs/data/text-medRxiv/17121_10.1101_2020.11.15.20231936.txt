Running Title: Impact of COVID-19 quarantine on myopia development

Summary
Background
High prevalence of myopia of adolescent has been a global public health concern. Their risk factors
and effective prevention methods for myopia across schoolchildren developmental stages are
critically needed but remain uncertain due to the difficulty in implementing intervention
measurements under normal life situation. We aimed to study the impact of the COVID-19
quarantine on myopia development among over one-million schoolchildren.
Methods
We designed the ongoing longitudinal project of Myopic Epidemiology and Intervention Study
(MEIS) to biannually examine myopia among millions of schoolchildren for ten years in Wenzhou
City, Zhejiang Province, China. In the present study, we performed three examinations of myopia in
1,305 elementary and high schools for schoolchildren in June 2019, December 2019 and June 2020.
We used the normal period (June-December 2019) and COVID-19 quarantine period (January-June
2020) for comparisons. Myopia was defined as an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/25 or less and a
spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of -0.5 diopters (D) or less. High myopia was defined as an

SER of -6.0 D or less.
Findings
In June 2019, 1,001,749 students aged 7-18 were eligible for examinations. In the 6-month and
12-month follow-up studies, there were 813,755 eligible students (81.2%) and 768,492 eligible
students (76.7%), respectively. Among all students, we found that half-year myopia progression
increased approximate 1.5 times from -0.263 D (95% CI, -0.262 to -0.264) during normal period to
-0.39 D (95% CI, -0.389 to -0.391) during COVID-19 quarantine (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox
regression analysis identified grade rather than age was significantly associated with myopia (Hazard
ratio [HR]: 1.10, 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.13; P < 0.001) and high myopia (HR: 1.40, 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.46;
P < 0.001) after adjustment for other factors. The prevalence, progression, and incidence of myopia
and high myopia could be categorized into two grade groups: I (grades 1-6) and II (grades 7-12).
Specifically, COVID-19 quarantine for 6 months sufficiently increased risk of developing myopia
(OR: 1.36, 95% CI, 1.33 to 1.40) or high myopia (OR: 1.30, 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.39) in Grade Group I,
but decreased risk of developing myopia (OR: 0.45, 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.48) or high myopia (OR: 0.57,
95% CI, 0.54 to 0.59) in Grade Group II.
Interpretation
The finding that behavioral modifications for six months during COVID-19 quarantine sufficiently
and grade-specifically modify myopia development offers the largest human behavioral intervention
data at the one million scale to identify the grade-specific causal factors and effective prevention
methods for guiding the formulation of myopia prevention and control policies.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Myopia is the most-common refractive error worldwide. Myopia with younger onset may result in
developing high myopia, which is associated with sight-threatening ocular diseases such as
maculopathy,

retinal

detachment,

opticneuropathy,

glaucoma,

retinal

atrophy,

choroidal

neovascularization. In light of the increasing prevalence of myopia and high myopia has been a
global public health concern, the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on myopia development has gained
substantial attention. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and MEDLINE databases for original
articles reported between database inception and November 10, 2020, using the following search
terms: (coronavirus OR COVID* OR SARS-COV-2 OR lockdown OR quarantine) AND (myopia
OR short-sightedness OR refractive error). To date, there was no original study reported to uncover
the influence of COVID-19 quarantine on myopia progression.

Added value of this study
This study provides the largest longitudinal intervention data on myopia progression in Chinese
schoolchildren covering all grades of schoolchildren at one-million scale. COVID-19 quarantine
model uncovers that behavioral modifications for six months may lead to significant increase of
overall prevalence of myopia associated with their increased screen times and decreased outdoor
activity times. Importantly, their effects on developing myopia or high myopia of students are

grade-dependent, which were risk factors for elementary schools period but protective factors for
high schools period partly due to reduced school education burden.

Implications of all the available evidence
This one-million schoolchildren myopia survey offers evidence that six months behavioral
modifications sufficiently and grade-specifically change the progression of myopia and high myopia.
In view of the increased use of electronic devices is an unavoidable trend, effective myopia
prevention strategy according to grade among students is urgently needed. Since COVID-19
outbreak is still ongoing and spreading, international collaborate efforts are warranted to uncover the
influence of COVID-19 on myopia progression to further substantiate these findings.

Introduction
Myopia is the most-common cause of visual impairment worldwide 1. Many studies have
reported the prevalence of myopia among schoolchildren, which ranges from 20% in early
school-aged children to as high as 80% among 17-year-olds, in China

a substantially increased risk of sight-threatening complications such as myopic maculopathy,
glaucoma, and retinal detachment. The increasing prevalence of myopia is a global public health
concern14, 15, promoting many countries including China

16

to implement nationwide policies for

preventing myopia development.
The progression of myopia can be influenced by genetic and environmental components 17. Many
observational studies have reported numerous environment factors involved in myopia development,
including education level, near work, urbanization, season of birth, and outdoor activities

While some studies reported a significant association between increased computer and smart phone
use time and myopia development

23, 24

, a meta-analysis reported s no association of screen time with

the prevalence or incidence of myopia

25

. Recent studies have shown that children who increased

time spent outdoors (but not indoors) have a lower possibility of incident myopia

26, 27

. Despite

intensive efforts and numerous studies, there remains no consensus regarding primary myopia risk
factors and effective prevention methods, in part due to the lack of human intervention study for the
difficulty in implementing behavioral modification at large-scale samples. Thus, longitudinal studies
of myopia development, particularly human behavioral intervention study on large scale are urgently
needed.
We initiated the Myopic Epidemiology and Intervention Study (MEIS) in January 2019with
support from the State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Optometry and Visual Science, National
Clinical Research Center for Ocular Disease under leadership of National Health Commission of
China. The MEIS was designed to examine refraction-confirmed myopia among millions of

schoolchildren in Wenzhou City with semiannual examination for ten years, taking into consideration
of gender, educational level, educational system, and region of habitation. Until now, we have
completed three test points of myopia: June 2019, December 2019, and June 2020, which provide a
large-scale longitudinal study of 12-month follow-up, including the precious data for 6-month before
and after the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19 was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei
province, China

28

, it has quickly caused an unprecedented global pandemic

27

. Governments from

many countries have imposed various strict containment measures on citizens including case
isolation, limited outdoor activities, and school closures to prevent COVID-19 virus spread

.

According to the data from UNESCO, more than 87% of the world’s student population from > 160
countries are affected by these lockdown measures

. COVID-19 quarantine has led to substantial

changes in daily life among school-going children, including sharply dropped schooling times, but
the increased online digital screen times and decreased outdoor activity times31. This provides unique
and unprecedented opportunity to identify and evaluate the effect of behavioral modifications reeling
from COVID-19 quarantine on the incidence and/or the worsening of myopia among schoolchildren

Wenzhou is a coastal city located in Zhejiang province in China with 9.25 million local

residents, of which many are usually businessmen by profession and frequently work and live in
different cities including Wuhan. There were approximately 180,000 Wenzhou people working in
Wuhan and 33,000 of them returned from Wuhan after COVID-19 outbreak, which led to Wenzhou

provided a practical experimental model to identify the critical risk factors for behavioral
modification of developing myopia.
To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive evaluation of the influence of COVID-19
quarantine on myopia development was reported. In the current longitudinal study across over
one-million schoolchildren, we aimed to determine the prevalence of myopia and assess the impact
of COVID-19 quarantine on myopia progression and incidence. The one-million mega dataset of
myopia general survey allows to investigate the prevalence and to identify risk factors of myopia at
the grade (even at birth month) scale. Specifically, we sought to address two critical questions: (1)
Was six-month behavioral modifications during COVID-19 quarantine sufficient to change myopia
progression course? (2) What are key risk factors for the occurrence and progression of myopia
especially high myopia? - The findings from our study not only provides the first human behavioral
intervention data at the one million-scale to identify the grade-specific causal factors, but also offer
valuable information for the development of evidence-based myopia prevention and control
strategies for children by school grade level.

Methods
Study design and participants
As part of our ongoing efforts within the MEIS project, the current survey of
refraction-confirmed myopia was conducted among more than one-million schoolchildren in
Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China in June 2019, and followed by two examinations in
December 2019 and June 2020. To facilitate this comprehensive myopia survey, we developed a
semi-automated vision examination, and an information-entry pipeline, the Adolescent Myopia

Information Management System (AMIMS), which involves manual inspection of automated
refractometry data, automatic data import, and collaboration between clinicians and a statistician
(Supplemental Figure S1).
In June of 2019, a census of 1,305 elementary and high schools encompassing different
educational systems (key school and non-key school [i.e., public, sport, and martial arts]) in 11
districts of Wenzhou was conducted. There were 1,060,925 students aged 7 to 18 years recruited at
the baseline, including 612,648 elementary school students (grades 1-6 in Chinese education system),
264,661 junior high school students (grades 7-9), and 183,616 senior high school students (grades
10-12). All students identified in the census were invited to complete a self-administered
questionnaire regarding demographic information and their knowledge of myopia. Certified
technicians were trained at the Wenzhou Medical University Affiliated Eye Hospital with respect to
standard procedures for determining visual acuity (VA) and auto refraction testing. Each school in
the district was equipped with an auto refractometer (GoldEye RM-9000) and electronic logarithmic
visual chart (GoldEye CM-1900C) by the Wenzhou Municipal Government for assessing the degree
of myopia. These resources were utilized by trained technicians to examine all participants. Among
the 1,060,925 students, 18,627 students did not attend the VA and auto refraction testing. Participants
with refraction values deemed nonstandard by the optometry staff were also excluded (N = 26,350),
as were participants with atypical personal identity information (N = 14,119), resulting in 1,001,749
eligible participants (94.4% of the initial study population) remaining in the study (Figure 1).
Subsequently, two follow-up examinations were conducted in December 2019 involving
813,755 students (81.2%) and June 2020 involving 768,492 students (76.7%). It was not possible to
follow the remaining participants mainly because they had graduated from high school or refused to

participate.
The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Wenzhou Medical University
Affiliated Eye Hospital (approval numbers Wmu191204 and Wmu191205). All procedures were
conducted in accordance with institutional/national research committee ethical standards as well as
the 1964 Helsinki declaration. Participant completion of the self-administered questionnaire was
considered informed consent.

Measurements and Outcomes
Due to the large sample size, performing the criterion standard of cycloplegic refraction to
diagnose myopia was not applicable. Thus, the current survey adopted an alternative method of VA
and autorefraction testing to identify myopia. VA was evaluated using an ‘‘E-type’’ standard
logarithmic visual chart at a distance of 5 m. All students underwent noncycloplegic refraction
testing using an automated refractometer, followed by complement subjective refraction testing for
validation using an ‘‘E-type’’ standard logarithmic visual chart. Students who required corrective
lenses were examined with and without eyeglasses, and naked eye refraction data were used to
calculate the spherical equivalent. Myopia was identified as an uncorrected VA of less than 20/25,
and spherical equivalent refraction (SER) was equaled to (sphere + [cylinder/2]) of -0.5 diopters (D)
or less33. Since analysis for right and left eyes yielded a satisfactory correlation (Pearson correlation
coefficient = 0.954, Supplemental Figure S2), SER data from the right eye were arbitrarily used for
assessing myopia development, as reported in previous studies

34, 35

. An SER of -6.0 D or less

indicated as high myopia, and an SER between -0.5 D and -6.0 D defined as non-high myopia 36.
From June 2019 to December 2019, the first 6-month interval indicated as “Normal” period

without the influence of COVID-19 quarantine, and the second 6-month interval from January 2020
to June 2020 indicated as “COVID-19” period with the influence of COVID-19 quarantine. Since
COVID-19 quarantine had a great influence on alterations of schoolchildren lifestyle and study
behaviors, it provided a practical intervention model for comparing the differences of risk factors
related to myopia between normal period and COVID-19 period. Earlier studies

37-39

have used the

6-month interval to measure myopia progression for exploring the intervention strategies. In addition,
during August 2020, we further used a new-designed questionnaire to survey 12,013 students, which
were randomly selected from all grades. The questionnaire consisted of 17 questions, including the
basic characteristics of schoolchildren, myopia information of their parents and siblings, and students’
lifestyle or learning approaches such as outdoor activities times and online course times during
normal period and COVID-19 period.

Statistical Analysis
The prevalence of myopia and high myopia were calculated by all eligible participants in three
examinations. For prevalence, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated according to the
procedure reported by Newcombe

40

. To examine factors associated with the incidence of myopia,

the Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed on students who attended all three
examinations and did not have myopia at the baseline. Similarly, Cox proportional hazard regression
analysis was conducted to reveal risk factors associated with the incidence of high myopia on
students who attended all three examinations and did not have high myopia at the baseline. These
multivariate Cox regression analyses were adjusted for grade, age, gender, birth month, educational
system (key/non-key school), and habitation (urban/rural). The survival package in R was applied to

perform multivariate Cox regression analyses.
The significance of differences between categorical variables was assessed using the Fisher’s
test, and that of differences between continuous variables was assessed using Student’s t test.
Two-sided P values were used in all statistical analyses. The Pearson correlation analysis was used to
calculate the correlation of SER between right- and left-eye. The R software (ver. 3.6.1) was used for
all statistical analyses (http://www.r-project.org).

Results
The prevalence of myopia and high myopia
We enrolled and collected data from a total of 1,060,925 students at the baseline (June 2019).
After stringent sample filtering, 1,001,749 students (550,756 males and 450,993 females) were
included in the current study (Figure 1 and Supplemental Table S1). There were 580,177 students in
elementary schools, 250,839 in junior high schools, and 170,733 in senior high schools, covering
almost all schools (1,305/1,336 = 97.8%) in 11 districts of Wenzhou City (Supplemental Figure S3).
Of the 1,001,749 students, 813,755 (81.2%) were reexamined after the first six months (Normal
period) and 768,492 (76.7%) after the second six months (COVID-19 period) (Figure 1). At the
baseline, the myopia prevalence was 52.89% (95% CI, 52.79% to 52.99%), and the high myopia

prevalence was 4.11% (95% CI, 4.07% to 4.15%). Table 1 shows the prevalence of myopia and high
myopia among schoolchildren across three examinations categorized by gender, educational level,
educational system, and habitation. The high prevalence of myopia among schoolchildren is similar
with other cities of China and East Asia countries (Supplemental Table S2).
The important role of education burden in myopia development
At the baseline, cross-sectionally, the prevalence of myopia increased with grade level
increasing (Table 1), and was 35.41% (95% CI, 35.29% to 35.53%) among elementary school
(grades 1-6), 74.01% (95% CI, 73.84% to 74.18%) among junior high school (grades 7-9), and 81.26%
(95% CI, 81.07% to 81.44%) among senior high school (grades 10-12). The high myopia prevalence
was significantly higher among senior high school (12.03%; 95% CI, 11.87% to 12.18%) than that
among elementary school (0.82%; 95% CI, 0.8% to 0.85%). A grade-stratified analysis indicated that
myopia development could be categorized into two grade groups: Grade Group I (grades 1-6)
representing myopia sensitive stage and Grade Group II (grades 7-12) representing high myopia
sensitive stage (Supplemental Figure S4-S6). A high increase in myopia prevalence of 9.9% per
advance in grade level was observed in Grade Group I, whereas the rate increase in myopia
prevalence slowed to 2.4% per advance in grade level in Grade Group II (Supplemental Tables
S3-S5). The prevalence of high myopia increased from 4.46% (95% CI: 4.32% to 4.6%) to 13.25%
(95% CI: 12.95% to 13.55%) during advancement through Grade Group II (Supplemental Table S3).
Interestingly, the prevalence of myopia increased in a stepwise manner by grade, as determined by
sequential analyses stratified by the students’ birth month (Figure 2A, Supplemental Figure S7A-B,
and Supplemental Table S6). Notably, an average increase in myopia prevalence of 8.54% (95% CI,
6.77% to 9.93%; P < 0.001) in the Grade Group I and 4.32% (95% CI, 0.69% to 7.42%; P < 0.001) in

the Grade Group II was observed in students of the same age born in the August of the year
compared with those born in the September (Supplemental Figures S8-S9 and Supplemental Table
S6), consistent with policies regarding the age of school enrollment in China that students born in
August went to school a year earlier. It provides a direct clue that grade increasing of education
burden could play more effects on myopia occurrence rather than age.
Consistently, by performing multivariate Cox regression analyses with adjustment, we found
grade was statistically significantly associated with myopia (HR: 1.1, 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.13, P <
0.001) and high myopia (HR: 1.4, 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.46, P < 0.001), whereas age and birth month
showed non-significant association with myopia and high myopia (Figure 2B-C). Furthermore, we
found gender, habitation, and educational system showed a statistically significant association with
myopia (Figure 2B). Compared with males, non-key school, and rural habitation separately, factors
of females (HR: 1.2, 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.22, P < 0.001), key school (HR: 1.04, 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.06, P
< 0.001), and urban habitation (HR: 1.11, 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.13, P < 0.001) had a higher risk to
develop myopia.

The influence of COVID-19 quarantine on myopia progression
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we found students’ online time (> 2h) substantially increased
(Figure 3A) and outdoor activity time (> 1h) largely decreased (Figure 3B). For students in Grade
Group I, the online time increased by 3.4 times from 22.7% in normal period to 77.5% in COVID-19
period, and the outdoor activity time decreased from 41.8% in normal period to 36.6% in COVID-19
period. With regard to students in Grade Group II, the online time increased by 2.07 times from 46.9%
in normal period to 96.9% in COVID-19 period, and the outdoor activity time decreased by 1.71

times from 40.1% in normal period to 23.5% in COVID-19 period (Figure 3B). These increased
online time and decreased outdoor time among school-aged children may lead to occur or worsen
myopia.
To assess the impact of COVID-19-induced lifestyle changes on myopia development, we found
myopia progression speed among all schoolchildren increased of approximate 1.5 times from -0.263
D (95% CI, -0.262 to -0.264) during normal period to -0.39 D (95% CI, -0.389 to -0.391) during
COVID-19 period (P < 0.001, Supplemental Table S7). Stratified by gender, educational level,
educational system, and habitation, we also observed a significant exacerbation of myopia
progression during COVID-19 period (P < 0.001, Supplemental Table S7). Notably, compared with
normal period, we found that the faster myopia progression of students from Grade Group I than
ones from Grade Group II during COVID-19 period (Figure 3C and Supplemental Table S8).

The influence of COVID-19 quarantine on myopia incident
For all schoolchildren, we found that the half-year incidence rate of myopia increased from 8.5%
in normal period to 9.87% in COVID-19 period (OR: 1.18, 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.20; Figure 4A).
Stratified by female/male, key/non-key school, and urban habitation, schoolchildren had a
significantly higher half-year incidence rate during COVID-19 period than that during normal period
(P < 0.001, Figure 4A). COVID-19 quarantine showed no significant impact on half-year incidence
rate among students from rural habitation (P = 0.62). With regard to educational level, students in
Grade Group I showed a remarkably higher risk of developing myopia during COVID-19 period than
normal period (OR: 1.36, 95% CI, 1.33 to 1.40; P < 0.001, Figure 4A), whereas students in Grade
Group II had a prominently lower risk of incident myopia during COVID-19 period than normal

period (OR: 0.45, 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.48; P < 0.001, Figure 4A). Interestingly, we found a distinct
pattern that the half-year incidence rate of myopia during COVID-19 period consistently increased
with grade increasing in Grade Group I, and the myopia half-year incidence rate during COVID-19
period gradually decreased with grade increasing in Grade Group II (Figure 4B and Supplemental
Table S9). These results suggested COVID-19 was a risk factor for developing myopia among
students in Grade Group I, whereas it was a protective factor for developing myopia among students
in Grade Group II.
As for high myopia, the half-year incidence rate among all schoolchildren decreased from 1.31%
during normal period to 0.096% during COVID-19 period (OR: 0.73, 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.75; Figure
4C). Among students in Grade Group I, the half-year incidence rate of high myopia during
COVID-19 period was significantly higher than that during normal period (OR: 1.30, 95% CI, 1.22
to 1.39, Figure 4C), whereas there was a lower half-year incidence rate of students in Grade Group II
during COVID-19 period than that during normal period (OR: 0.57, 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.59, Figure 4C).
Consistent with the identified COVID-19-influenced pattern of myopia, half-year incidence rate of
high myopia during COVID-19 period gradually increased with grade increasing in Grade Group I,
but decreased with grade increasing in Grade Group II (Figure 4D). In contrast, the half-year
incidence rate of high myopia during normal period tended to persistently increase with grade
increasing from 0.063% to 3.87% (Supplemental Table S10). Our finding consistently indicated
COVID-19 contributed risk to incident high myopia among students in Grade Group I and had a
protective effect on developing high myopia among students in Grade Group II.

The COVID-19 quarantine reveals the crucial risk factors and uncovers the sufficiency of
behavioral modifications and grade-specific control of myopia development.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused a public health emergency and global threat

27

and

led to the population worldwide experiencing life-altering challenges. The COVID-19 quarantine
also offers an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the effect of behavioral modifications on the
incidence and/or the worsening of myopia among schoolchildren on mega scale (such as one-million
schoolchildren in the MEIS study). There existed positive and negative impacts of COVID-19
pandemic on various aspects of lifestyle behaviors

31, 41, 42

. Hu et al.

41

reported approximately 90%

of the Chinese participants had longer screen time and approximately 40% of the participants had
inactive leisure-time physical exercise. Another study

31

on Chinese children and adolescents from

five schools in Shanghai also reported that screen time remarkably increased by about 30 hours per
week on average during the COVID-19 period. Consistently, we found that online time during
COVID-19 period considerably increased by 3.4 times among Chinese students in Grade Group I
and 2.07 times among ones in Grade Group II. Meanwhile the outdoor activity time substantially
decreased among students among both Grade Groups I and II. These two factors (i.e. increased
online time and decreased outdoor activity time) have been documented to enhance the risk of
developing myopia

23, 24, 27

. In light of COVID-19 quarantine led to billions of students are

simultaneously exposed to the influence of cumulative risk factors for myopia 32, it is highly valuable
to establish the COVID-19 quarantine intervention model in a real world study to uncover the crucial
risk factors of myopia development.
First, some early studies

37, 38

may show that behavioral modifications for six months can

influence myopia development. However, these studies are limited by sample size and by the

difficulty in implementing behavioral modification at large scale. As the result, the sufficiency of
behavioral modification pattern and time remain unclear. To the best of our knowledge, the EMIS
study provides the first human intervention evidence at one-million scale to demonstrate that
behavioral modification for six months during COVID-19 quarantine was sufficient to alter myopia
progression. This sufficiency time for behavioral modification to be effective is essential in guiding
the formation of myopia development and control among schoolchildren. Additional studies are
needed to evaluate and demonstrate whether the COVID-19 pandemic exert lasting effects on the
progression of myopia or high myopia (i.e. this specific pattern would persist during or after the
COVID-19 quarantine) and to identify the shortest time for behavioral modification (such as three
months) that is effective in influencing myopia development.
Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that myopia onset and peak progression are
rapid in childhood, particularly around puberty

43

. Compared with normal period, we found the

COVID-19 quarantine had grade-specific effects on worsening the progression of myopia among
schoolchildren, particularly among students in elementary school (Grade Group I), suggesting that
elementary children were more vulnerable to be influenced by altered external environment resulting
from COVID-19 quarantine. Interestingly, we uncovered a distinct pattern that COVID-19
quarantine was a risk factor of developing myopia or high myopia among students from Grade
Group I, whereas COVID-19 quarantine was a protective factor for the development of myopia or
high myopia among students from Grade Group II. Although COVID-19 increased the online time
and decreased the outdoor activity time for all schoolchildren, COVID-19 still decreased the
incidence rate of myopia and high myopia among students in Grade Group II, which may be due to
the largely reduced study pressure.

Third, genetic factors play an important role in development of high myopia

. As result the

extent of high myopia can be modified by environmental factors such as behavioral modification in
COVID-19 quarantine is largely unknown. Interestingly, we found that behavioral modification
increased the risk of developing high myopia in Grade I group and decreased the risk of incident
high myopia in Grade II group. This study provide the clearest data yet in support of the
environmental factors contribution to high myopia, which is collaborated by previous studies 22, 45.
The EMIS study provide the first human behavioral intervention data at the one million-scale
to identify the grade-specific causal factors for myopia prevention and control.
Within our EMIS study population, the overall prevalence of myopia and high myopia were
52.89% and 4.11%, respectively. The prevalence of myopia among students of senior high school
were 81.26%, which was similar to that reported among students of high school in 2010 in Shandong
Province, China (84.6%)

46

, Beijing, China (80.07%)

2, 47

, Singapore (74.2%)

48

, and South Korea

(80.2%) 49. The prevalence of high myopia among all myopia cases at the end of senior high school
was up to 13.25%, which is consistent with other Asian countries or regions. The prevalence of high
myopia in Taiwan college freshmen

50

represented 26% of all myopia cases in 1988; by 2005, high

myopia represented 40% of all myopia cases. Lin et al.

51

reported that 21% of students in Taiwan

aged 18 years had high myopia in 2000, up from 10.9% in 1983. Notably, the prevalence of high
myopia increased rapidly in Grade Group II of the EMIS study, indicating that although the onset of
new cases of myopia slowed in high school, existing cases progressed in severity.
While several studies have evaluated and showed positive correlation between age and grade
level with myopia development

18, 52, 53

. However, these studies are limited by sample size and lack

of the detailed analysis of these risk factors, rendering the importance of these risk factors uncertain.

In our survey of over one-million students, over 5,000 participants for each birth month, enabling
stratification of the results by birth month. In students of the same age, differences in myopia were
observed between those born in August and September, indicating that educational grade is more
closely associated with development of myopia than age. Multivariate Cox regression analyses
further validated the significant association between grade and myopia as well as high myopia after
adjusting for other risk factors. Thus, our MEIS study with one-million participants establishes that
educational burden could play key roles in myopia and high myopia.
Based on our multivariate Cox models, we found that female students had a higher risk of
developing myopia or high myopia than male students, which was consistent with previous studies
reporting a positive correlation between female sex and increased myopia risk in China

47, 54, 55

. This

difference could have a biological explanation related to hormonal differences, as postulated in a
review of myopia in opposite-sex twins 56. In addition, traditional cultural factors might influence the
behaviors of Chinese girls, such as Chinese girls prefer to white skin and avoid sun exposure, and are
encouraged to be gentle and quiet, which may predispose girls to stay indoors more

57

. We also

observed that students from key school or urban habitation yielded a significantly higher risk of
developing myopia or high myopia than those from non-key school or rural habitation. Consistently,
Jan et al.

55

reported the prevalence of visual impairment was higher among Chinese students living

in urban than ones living rural areas. More economically developed regions in China, such as
Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai, had a higher risk of visual impairment than less developed regions
regardless of survey year 55.
The limitations of this study should be noted. First, the study participants were schoolchildren
and did not include adults at universities and middle-aged or quinquagenarian individuals; hence our

findings are limited to younger population. Furthermore, student’s online time and outdoor activity
time changes during COVID-19 period were based on self-reported, thus these measurements might
exist recall bias. Second, only Chinese schoolchildren were participants. In view of the ongoing
COVID-19 spread worldwide, more studies are warranted to explore the influence of COVID-19 on
myopia progression of schoolchildren based on more different ethnicities.
In summary, the present study is the largest longitudinal survey to assess the impact of
COVID-19 quarantine-related lifestyle changes on myopia development among schoolchildren. We
found an interesting COVID-19-induced pattern of developing myopia among children and
adolescents, indicating different intervention strategies should be applied to control myopia among
elementary and high schools. Our results should help inform educational and health policy decision
making and the development of programs aimed at the prevention and control of myopia. Over the
next decade, the MEIS will continue to support surveys of myopia in students twice annually, with a
focus on discerning the effects of genetics, nutrition, and learning environment using questionnaire
surveys and medical intervention studies to promote nationwide strategies for the prevention and
control of myopia.
