Abstract

Objectives: Respiratory illnesses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle
East Respiratory Syndrome and the current SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic are
transmitted by respiratory droplets. Certain dental procedures generate aerosols,
one of the highest sources of transmission of droplet infections. During the current
pandemic, dentists in the UK were initially restricted in their work and now have
guidance from NHS England and the Chief Dental Officer for the full resumption of
safe and effective routine dental care to patients. Lack of work, impact on income
and working in the continual pandemic situation are likely to cause significant mental
stress in dentists. Occupational health (OH) can have a vital role to help such
dentists remain in work by advising strategies to cope with stress and offering timely
evidence-based interventions and adjustments. The aim was to assess if the dentists
in the UK had access to OH and whether access to the OH services helped.

Methods: A survey link was sent to 200 dentists in the UK after the peak of the
current pandemic.

Results: 124 dentists responded to the survey. The response rate was 62%. 59% of
the dentists in the survey did not have access to OH services in their workplace.
Only 15% of dentists working in the independent sector had access to OH services
compared to 78% working in the NHS or having NHS contracts. None of the dentists
in the survey accessed OH services.

Conclusions: Access to OH services for the dentists needs improvement,
particularly in the Independent sector in the UK.

Key words: Occupational Health, Dentist, Pandemic.

INTRODUCTION:
In the United Kingdom, medical, dental, and healthcare services are provided by
government funded organisation called the National Health Services (NHS). Dental
care in the UK is provided in NHS hospitals, in practices with an NHS contract and in
the independent sector. Dental interventions can include procedures which generate
aerosols which are highly infectious and can transmit the virus causing the current
pandemic [1]. To prevent the risk of transmitting the pandemic virus during the peak
of the pandemic, routine dental work was stopped by the government and only
emergency treatment or telephone advice was offered. It is likely that the dentists
restricted from clinical work, and those working in the pandemic may have
undergone significant stress and experienced mental health symptoms.

Research into the mental health of dentists in the UK started approximately 3
decades ago [2]. Survey research by the British Dental Association in 1996 found
11% of dentists experienced some level of distress [3]. In 2019, survey of 2053 UK
dentists concluded that dentistry is a stressful profession [4].

Occupational health, as a specialty, helps in managing long term sickness absence,
hazards in workplace, health surveillance and managing blood borne viral infections
due to body fluid exposures including needle stick injuries amongst its various other
services [5]. Research about OH access/intervention to assist dentists cope with
stress and mental health is lacking in the UK and other parts of the world. Further
insight into the current level of access to OH services for dentists is important to plan
strategies for timely intervention to prevent long term psychological ill-health.

METHODS:
A survey link was sent to 200 dentists in 3 social media dentistry groups and
personal communications in the UK as power calculations using Cohen effect size
suggested a minimum of 117 responses be achieved for an effect size of 0.9 for this
study. The social media dentistry group included a wide variety of professionals like
hospital consultants, trainees, general dental practitioners, and specialty dentists,
working in the NHS or with NHS contracts and/or the independent sector. Ethical
approval was sought from the NHS Health Research Authority. The survey was
conducted after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Appendix 1 has the
list of the survey questions. Patient Health Questionnaire – (PHQ-4), an ultra-brief
validated tool was used to screen for anxiety and depression symptoms [6]. It had 2
screening questions on anxiety (A1 & A2) and depression (D1 & D2) each. Closed
questions about OH access, support, and interventions including with their place of
work were asked. Place of work was identified as NHS, Independent sector, and
both.
It was not appropriate or possible to involve patients or the public in the design, or
conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of our research. No patient involved.

Pearson’s chi-squared test of independence was used to determine the mean. Odds
ratio was calculated to measure the risk differences between the association of NHS
and independent sector practitioners.

RESULTS:
124 dentists took part in the study. The response rate was 62%. The power for
sample size of 124 was 0.92. One respondent did not complete the survey and was
excluded. Only 45% of the dentists were working at the time of the survey. Of these
18% were working in NHS setting, 27% in the independent sector and 55% in both.

Access to OH: Only 41% (95% CI 0.33-0.50) of the dentists surveyed, had access to
OH. OH access was available for 78% (95% CI 0.58-0.90) of dentists working in the
NHS, 41% (95% CI 0.30-0.53) working in both (independent sector and NHS) and in
15% (95% CI 0.07-0.32) working solely in the independent sector. With regards to
PHQ4 questions related to anxiety and depression screening, 67% (95% CI 0.070.32) of anxious dentists, 59% (95% CI 0.45-0.71) of worried dentists, 47% (95% CI
0.34-0.60) of dentists with little interest in doing things and 45% (95% CI 0.32-0.59)
of dentists feeling low, had access to occupational health.

Accessing OH services: Surprisingly, none of the dentists including those who were
experiencing mental health symptoms and who had access to OH, reported of
accessing/seeking OH intervention to improve their psychological health.
However, an interesting finding was that having access to OH services was
associated with a 2-3 times lesser risk of developing mental health symptoms for the
dentists. (Table 1).

DISCUSSION:
The findings of this survey suggest that a significant number of dentists in this group
were not working during the peak of the pandemic. This change in delivery and
operation of dental services was due to government restrictions to prevent
transmission of the pandemic virus. Just under 60% of the dentists in this study did
not have OH access, particularly those working in the independent sector. It was not
possible to determine if OH intervention would help as no dentist accessed OH
advice. However, the significant finding from this study was that those dentists who
had access to OH services were 2-3 times less likely to experience psychological
symptoms.

A recent survey by Toon et.al of 1513 dentists in the UK found statistically significant
relationship (p<0.01, β=0.67) between work related stress and burnout in UK
dentists amongst other factors [7]. Research in other parts of the world have
highlighted similar findings over the last two decades [8,9]. OH can provide timely
intervention for fitness to continue working by suggesting restrictions/adjustments,
referral to employee assistance programme to access counselling services and
ongoing review [10]. In the UK, dentists working in an NHS setting usually have an
inhouse OH service provision compared to the independent sector where the access
to the OH is usually a paid service. There may be a lack of awareness of the various
services offered by OH, the associated costs and ease of access may be some of
the factors contributing to the differences in access to OH services between
independent sector and the NHS. This topic needs further investigation.

Limitations of this survey include a snapshot view of dentists in the UK at the time of
the pandemic. Respondents may have an exacerbated emotional response due to
the mortality and morbidity associated with severe Covid 19 disease, loss of
earnings, lack of a routine, hypervigilance, social distancing in the pandemic
situation; all of these can lead to a response bias. However, access to OH is a
factual question, unlikely to be biased by an external factor. As none of the dentists
accessed the OH services, precise estimate of risk reduction in the mental health
symptoms in dentists who had OH access remain a topic of future research.

In conclusion, findings of this study suggest that there is a need for improvement in
access to the OH services for dentists, particularly in the independent sector. We
support the idea of improving OH access for the dentists in workplace to receive
timely and evidence-based interventions in line with the current Society of
Occupational Medicine, UK campaign of Universal OH access.
