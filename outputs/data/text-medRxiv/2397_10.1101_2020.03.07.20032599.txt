Abstract
Objectives
The aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of COVID-19 with early renal
injury, and to explore the value of multi-index combined detection in diagnosis of
early renal injury in COVID-19.
Design
The study was an observational, descriptive study.
Setting
This study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China.
Participants
12 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020.
Primary and secondary outcome measures
The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in
COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous
creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR)
were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes
were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), α1-microglobulin (A1M),
urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in
diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury.
Results
While all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood
urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%,
41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the
area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in
COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU
(0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early
renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio
(NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal
injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19,
and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury.

Conclusions
Early renal injury was common in patients with COVID-19. Combined detection of

Introduction
Since December 2019, unexplained clustered pneumonia cases have started to appear
in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It is identified as a pneumonia caused by a novel
coronavirus infection.[1,2] The World Health Organization (WHO) named the
coronavirus 2019-nCoV, which was the third coronavirus that infects humans from
wild hosts across germlines after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and
can cause severe pneumonia. It is also the seventh species of pathogenic human
respiratory coronaviruses.[3,4] On February 11, 2020, the WHO named the novel
coronavirus-infected disease2019 novel coronavirus disease shorted for COVID-19.
With the spread of the epidemic, other cases in China and abroad have also
occurred.[5] As of February 22, 2020, a total of 76,396 cases were diagnosed in China,
including 11,477 severe cases and 2,348 deaths.
The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and fatigue. A few
patients have symptoms of nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhea.
Severe patients usually develop dyspnea and / or hypoxemia one week after the onset
of the disease. In severe cases, they quickly develop into acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multiple organ injury such as cardiac, hepatic,
and renal injury.[6] The 2019-nCoV human infection cases combine the
characteristics of the previous 6 coronaviruses, which can cause mild cases, easily
lose vigilance, and can also cause severe cases, with a high mortality rate. [7]
Multiple organ failure is the main cause of death of COVID-19. The latest research
reports that the incidence of COVID-19 with organ dysfunction is about 33%, of
which the acute renal injury is about 3 ~ 7%. [8,9] Impaired renal function can lead to
obstruction of excretion of metabolites and toxins in the body, which will adversely
affect the maintenance of the electrolyte and acid-base balance of the human body. In
addition, when renal function is severely damaged, uremia will occur and endanger
life. Early detection of evidence of renal injury and timely effective interventions are
of great significance for reducing complications and improving prognosis.

This study intends to use a number of laboratory test indexes, including serum
creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urine creatinine, urine microalbumin and urine
microglobulin et al to comprehensively assess renal function and determine the
incidence of COVID-19 with early renal injury. The related risk factors of COVID-19
with early renal injury were also analyzed.

Materials and methods
Patients
From January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020, 12 patients with pneumonia of unknown
cause were admitted to a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China. Nasopharyngeal swab
samples of all patients were tested positive for 2019-nCoV virus nucleic acid and
confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV by Guangdong Province CDC (Center for
Disease Control and Prevention). The disease diagnostic criteria and case
classification were refer to the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19
(Trial Version 5) issued by China National Health Commission.[6]

Data collection
A standardized case collection form was designed to collect laboratory data of the
included patients. It mainly included the following items: (1) blood routine; (2)
biochemical indexes of kidney, liver, and heart function; (3) coagulation function; (5)
infection indexes.

Evaluation of renal function
Serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine creatinine (Ucr), urine
protein (PRO), urine microalbumin (UMA), α1-microglobulin (A1M), urine
immunoglobulin G (IGU), and urine transferrin (TRU) were detected. The estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr), and urine
microalbumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated.

In this study, two or more abnormalities of eGFR, Ccr and UACR were defined
as early renal injury.

Statistical methods
The area under curves (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were
calculated for predictive analysis. Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to
analyze the linear correlation between two sets of continuous variables. It was
considered statistically significant when the P value was less than 0.05. All statistical
analyses were processed using SPSS 25.0 statistical software.

Patient and public involvement
Patients were not directly involved in the design, planning and conducting of this
study.

Results
Laboratory characteristics of the COVID-19 patients
Of the 12 patients with COVID-19, 2 were severe patients, 8 were general patients,
and 2 were light patients. Laboratory testing items included blood routine, electrolyte,
metabolism, heart, liver, kidney function indicators, coagulation function and
infection indicators. As shown in Table 1, the common abnormal indicators (abnormal
rate

≥50%) included: increased neutrophil ratio (50%), increased monocyte ratio

(75%), hypokalemia (50%), hyponatremia (50%), hypoproteinemia (75%), and
increased C-reactive protein (83.3%).

Incidence of COVID-19 with early renal injury
As shown in Table 2, Scr and BUN were not significantly abnormal in 12 patients.
However, the calculation of eGFR and Ccr showed that early renal injury was
common in COVID-19 patients. Among them, 66.7% patients had reduced eGFR and
41.7% patients had reduced Ccr. Urinary microprotein test also confirmed that
COVID-19 with early renal injury was common, with UACR> 30mg / g accounting
for 41.7%. Among the 12 patients, the abnormally elevated rates of UMA, A1M, IGU,
and TRU were 33.3%, 33.3%, 41.7%, and 16.7%, respectively. The positive rate of
the four-index combined was 58.3%. The results suggested that case 3, 5, 6, and 7
were significant early kidney injury cases.

Urinary microprotein detection in diagnosis of early renal injury in COVI
D-19
The AUC of UMA, A1M, IGU, and TRU for the diagnosis of early renal injury in
COVID-19 were 0.813, 0.813, 0.750, and 0.750 respectively, while the AUC of the
combined index of UMA + A1M + IGU + TRU was 0.875, suggesting that the
multi-index combined was helpful for the diagnosis of early renal injury in
COVID-19, as shown in Fig 1.

Factors related to early renal injury in COVID-19
In this study, Spearman correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the correlation
between renal function indicators (eGFR, Ccr, and UACR) and the obviously
abnormal biochemical indicators (C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil ratio (NER),
monocyte ratio (MOR), serum potassium (K), serum sodium (Na), and albumin
(ALB)). As shown in Table 3, it was found that eGFR was negatively correlated with
CRP and NER, and positively correlated with serum K, Ccr was negatively correlated

with CRP and NER, and positively correlated with MOR and serum Na, and UACR
was positively correlated with CRP, and negatively correlated with serum K (Fig 2).
The results suggested that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early
renal injury, and the early renal injury in COVID-19 can often cause hypokalemia and
hyponatremia.

Discussion
Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-strand RNA viruses. In 2014, the
International Virological Classification Committee classified them into four genera: α,

β, γ, and δ according to serotype and genomic characteristics. There are six known
types of coronaviruses that infect humans: α-genus 229E, NL63; β-genus OC43,
HKU1, SARSr-CoV and MERSr-CoV.[10] Previous case reports suggest that the
spectrum of diseases caused by coronavirus infection is polarized. For example, 229E
and NL63 in the α-genus, and OC43 and HKU1 in the β-genus often cause common
colds, which are mainly mild, usually without obvious fever, or only low fever.
Usually, it is self-limiting and heals without special treatment. However, the other two
coronaviruses in the β-genus, SARSr-CoV and MERSr-CoV, often cause acute
respiratory syndrome. They mainly cause severe pneumonia, with obvious clinical
symptoms, such as fever, dry cough, acute respiratory symptoms and fatigue. Usually,
Obvious changes can be found in lung imaging. They are two types of coronavirus
pneumonia that require close observation and intensive medical treatment. The
2019-nCov identified this time is a β-genus coronavirus. The diseases caused by its
infection combines the characteristics of the previous six coronaviruses, and the
disease spectrum is broad.[7]
Peng Zhou et al[11] reported the identification and characterization of
2019-nCoV. Through full-length genome sequences analysis, they found that the
whole genome of 2019-nCoV shared 79.5% sequence identify to SARS-CoV. The
pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins showed
that this virus belongs to the species of severe acute respirator syndrome-related

coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV). In addition, they also confirmed that 2019-nCov used
the same cell entry receptor, Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), as
SARS-CoV. The high degree of similarity in gene sequence and cellular mechanism
of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV suggests that the risk factors of mortality could also be
similar. SARS is an acute respiratory infectious disease with pulmonary parenchyma
and/or interstitium as the main site of invasion and multiple organ injury. Previous
clinical studies have found that, similar to SARS, the causes of death caused by
2019-nCov are not only lung tissue damage, but also heart, liver, kidney and other
organ dysfunction or even failure, which is one of the important causes of aggravation
and death.[8,9] In the previous SARS case study[12], acute renal injury was found to
be the top risk factor of mortality, even higher than acute respiratory distress. In that
case study, all patients who eventually died had a progressive rise of Scr, and the rise
of Scr was rapid in those who succumbed early in their illness. Previously, an ongoing
case study reported 59 patients infected by 2019-nCoV, including 28 severe cases and
3 death. In that study, 63% of the patients exhibited proteinuria, and 19% and 27% of
the patients had an elevated level of Scr and BUN respectively. Computed
tomography (CT) scans revealed abnormal renal imaging in all patients. The results
suggested that renal injury was common in COVID-19, which may contribute to
multiorgan failure and death eventually.[13]
In this study, 12 COVID-19 cases were analyzed. Although all the patients still
had normal level of Scr and BUN, the high incidence of early renal injury in
COVID-19 was found by calculating eGFR, CCR and UACR. The abnormal rates of
eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Combined
detection of UMA, A1M, IGU, and TRU could be helpful for the diagnosis of early
renal injury in COVID-19. Furthermore, the study also found that the degree of early
renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio
(NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal
injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19,
and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury. Xin Zou et al[14] analyzed

the single-cell RNA sequencing datasets to explore the expression of ACE2 in the
main physiological systems of the human body, including the respiratory,
cardiovascular, digestive and urinary system. The study showed that heart, esophagus,
kidney, bladder, and ileum have similar or higher ACE2 expression than in alveoli. In
the analysis of specific cell types, the expression of ACE2 in renal proximal tubule
cells was about four times higher than that of type II alveolar cells (AT2). The results
suggest that the kidney may be one of the primary targets of attack for the 2019-nCov.
Scr and BUN are commonly used indicators for the detection of renal function.
However, the sensitivity of both of them is poor. Usually, abnormalities occur only
when renal function is significantly damaged, as results, they cannot be used as
indicators for evaluating early renal injury. Urine microprotein refers to some proteins
that are difficult to detect by conventional qualitative or quantitative methods. The
detection of urine microprotein can detect the kidney and some other organs'
functional status early. Urine microalbumin is a sensitive indicator of early glomerular
injury. Microalbumin has a small molecular weight and is negatively charged.
Normally, due to the charge selection barrier of the glomerular filtration membrane,
the majority of urine microalbumin cannot pass through the filtration membrane under
the action of electrostatic homogeneous repulsion. In the early stage of renal function
injury, the charge selectivity of the glomerular filtration membrane decreases, the
pore size on the glomerular filtration membrane increases, and the negatively charged
structural components of the glomerular filtration membrane change, leading to
microalbumin increased excretion from urine.[15] Urine α1-microglobulin is an
important indicator for monitoring renal tubular injury. It is a glycoprotein with a
molecular weight of 26,000 to 33,000 and is widely distributed in human body.

α1-microglobulin can pass through the glomerular filtration membrane, and 95% to
99% is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, and it is not affected by pH. In the early
stage of renal injury, the renal tubule reabsorption function reduced, resulting in urine

α1-microglobulin excretion increased, and the elevation is consistent with the degree
of renal tubular injury.[16] Due to the large molecular weight, immunoglobulin G is

difficult to pass through the glomerular filtration membrane. When renal function is
impaired, it can lead to increased permeability of the glomerular filtration membrane.
The excretion of albumin in urine increases, and as the lesions worsen, the excretion
of immunoglobulin G in urine also increases. Therefore, the detection of urine
immunoglobulin G can help to judge the degree of damage on the glomerular
filtration membrane.[17] The main physiological function of transferrin is to transport
iron ions. It is a negatively charged protein, and its isoelectric point is one unit higher
than that of albumin. Normally, it cannot pass through the positively charged
glomerular filtration membrane. Urine transferrin is one of the indicators of early
glomerular injury, which mainly reflects the damage of glomerular filtration
membrane charge selection barrier.[18]

Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this study are as follows: Firstly, this study first investigated the
incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19 and revealed the prevalence of early
renal injury in COVID-19 patients. Secondly, this study clarified the value of
multi-index combined detection for the diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19,
and provided a basis for early detection and early intervention. The present study has
some limitations that must be taken into account when considering its contribution.
First and most significantly is the small sample size of this study. COVID-19 is a
newly emerging epidemic. The cases found in this city are all imported cases. After
strict prevention and control, there are fewer confirmed cases in this city. Therefore,
the number of cases included in this research is also small. In addition, considering
COVID-19 is a completely new disease, and we do not yet fully know the
characteristics of its cases, the type of research used in this study is designed as a
descriptive study, which initially explores the basic characteristics of the disease and
does not set the control group.

Conclusions
This study found that early renal injury was common in patients with COVID-19.
Combined detection of UMA, A1M, IGU, and TRU could be helpful for the diagnosis

of early renal injury in COVID-19. The 12 cases of COVID-19 reported in this study
were all healed and discharged after being treated with antivirals, maintaining water
and electrolyte balance, enhancing immunity, oxygen therapy, and traditional chinses
medicine treatment. In the process of diagnosis and treatment, the assessment of early
injury of important organs and comprehensive protective treatment has played a key
role. In particular, in the diagnosis of early renal injury, evidence of COVID-19 with
renal injury could be found in time by combining multiple indexes detection. Then, by
performing comprehensive treatment measures, such as stopping the use of
nephrotoxic drugs timely, maintaining water-electrolyte and acid-base balance and
performing effective organ support treatment et al, the complications can be reduced
effectively and the prognosis can be improved significantly.
