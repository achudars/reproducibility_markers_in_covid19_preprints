Abstract
New York State, in particular the New York City metropolitan area, was the early epicenter of
the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States. Similar to initial pandemic dynamics in many
metropolitan areas, multiple introductions from various locations appear to have contributed
to the swell of positive cases. However, representation and analysis of samples from New York
regions outside the greater New York City area were lacking, as were SARS-CoV-2 genomes
from the earliest cases associated with the Westchester County outbreak, which represents the
first outbreak recorded in New York State. The Wadsworth Center, the public health laboratory
of New York State, sought to characterize the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 across the
entire state of New York from March to September with the addition of over 600 genomes from
under-sampled and previously unsampled New York counties and to more fully understand the
breadth of the initial outbreak in Westchester County. Additional sequencing confirmed the
dominance of B.1 and descendant lineages (collectively referred to as B.1.X) in New York State.
Community structure, phylogenetic, and phylogeographic analyses suggested that the
Westchester outbreak was associated with continued transmission of the virus throughout the
state, even after travel restrictions and the on-pause measures of March, contributing to a
substantial proportion of the B.1 transmission clusters as of September 30th, 2020.

Introduction
The first case of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission in New York State (and the second case
overall) was documented on March 2, 2020 in the Westchester County town of New Rochelle,
approximately 25 miles North of New York City. Within days, a cluster of over 90 linked cases
emerged as family members, friends, and neighbors of the index case (Patient Zero) as well as
healthcare workers that treated the patient tested positive (Goldstein & Salcedo 2020). From
March 16th-July 22nd, the total number of cases in New York exceeded any other state
(data.cdc.gov) despite voluntary quarantine measures enacted shortly after the index case
tested positive, bans on large gatherings (March 12th; Cuomo 2020a), restaurant, bar (March
16th; Cuomo 2020b), and school (March 18th; Cuomo 2020c) closures, and the shuttering of all
non-essential businesses (March 22nd; Cuomo 2020d). However, daily case counts dropped
dramatically by late April and from early June through November, New York sustained a percent
positivity rate that hovered around 1% (despite increased testing). This was largely attributable
to March 22nd on-pause measures and widespread adherence to face-mask and social
distancing policies although the positivity rate has risen subsequently to the writing of this
manuscript.
Previous genomic epidemiological investigations revealed that the majority of infections in the
greater New York City metropolitan area (which includes the five boroughs of the city, and
Westchester, Nassau, and Suffolk counties) derived from the Pangolin B.1 lineage prevalent in
Europe and that the virus was introduced multiple times from other states and countries
(Gonzalez-Reiche et al. 2020; Maurano et al. 2020). Here, we attempt to clarify the SARS-CoV-2
transmission dynamics across New York State with additional sequencing of SARS-CoV-2
samples from almost every county of New York. We identified regional variation and a shift
over time in SARS-CoV-2 community composition with the Westchester outbreak contributing
to the dominance of the B.1 lineage. The data suggest that after the initial surge of cases in
early spring, the strict on-pause measures implemented were largely effective at curbing
widespread transmission into early Autumn.
Methods
RNA extraction
Respiratory swabs in viral transport medium (VTM, UTM or MTM) were received at the Virology
Laboratory, Wadsworth Center, for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing. Total nucleic acid was
extracted using either easyMAG or eMAG (bioMerieux, Durham, NC), MagNA Pure 96 and Viral
NA Large Volume Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), or EZ1 with the DSP Virus Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany) following manufacturers’ recommendations. Extracted nucleic acid was tested for
SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the 2019-Novel Coronavirus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention) according to the Instructions for Use on an ABI 7500Dx.
Ion Torrent Ampliseq Panel sequencing
Viral RNA was converted to cDNA using the SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis Kit (Thermofisher
Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Libraries were prepared on the Ion Chef
System as described in the Ion AmpliSeq™ Library Preparation on the Ion Chef™ System User

Guide. The samples were amplified for 17 cycles with a 4-minute extension time, using the Ion
AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel (Reference). Samples were then sequenced on the Ion S5
XL System (Thermofisher Scientific) using Ion 530 chips (Thermofisher Scientific) with 16 or 32
barcoded samples loaded on each chip.
Illumina library preparation and sequencing
Whole genome amplicon sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using a modified ARTIC
protocol (https://artic.network/ncov-2019 ). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized by combining 5 µl of
RNA with SuperScript™ IV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), random
hexamers, dNTPs, and RNAse inhibitor, followed by incubation at 25℃ for 5 minutes, 42℃ for
50 minutes and 70℃ for 10 minutes on a SimpliAmp thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA). Two separate amplicon pools were generated by multiplex PCR with two
separate premixed ARTIC V3 primer pools (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA).
Additional primers to supplement those that showed poor amplification efficiency
(https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/tree/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-2019)
were added separately to the pooled stocks. PCR conditions were 98℃ for 30 seconds, followed
by 24 cycles of 98℃ for 15 seconds and 63℃ for 5 minutes with a final 65℃ extension for 5
minutes. Amplicons from pool 1 and pool 2 reactions were combined and purified by Ampure
XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) with a 1X bead to sample ratio and eluted in 10 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The amplicons were quantified using Quant-IT™ dsDNA Assay Kit on an
ARVO™ X3 Multimode Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Illumina sequencing
libraries were generated using the Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit with Illumina Index
Adaptors and sequenced on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
Bioinformatics processing
Illumina libraries were processed with ARTIC nextflow pipeline (https://github.com/connorlab/ncov2019-artic-nf/tree/illumina, last updated April 2020). Briefly, reads were trimmed with
TrimGalore (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore) and aligned to the reference
assembly MN908947.3 (strain Wuhan-Hu-1) by BWA (Li & Durbin 2010). Primers were
trimmed with iVar (Grubaugh et al. 2018) and variants were called with samtools mpileup
function (Li et al. 2009), the output of which was used by iVar to generate consensus
sequences. Positions were required to be covered by a minimum depth of 50 reads and
variants were required to be present at a frequency ³ 0.75.
Ion Torrent reads were processed by the Ion AmpliSeq™ SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel with Ion
SARS-CoV-2 Research Plug in package IRMAreport / Geneious 9.1.8.
Phylogenetic and community structure analyses
We aligned our SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced at the Wadsworth Center and 1179 New York
sequences deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing Influenza Data (GISAID,
https://gisaid.org/,) database with MAFFT v.7.450 (Katoh & Standley 2013). To qualify for
inclusion in the analysis, genomes were required to have associated county metadata and to be
>98% complete with fewer than 5% ambiguities. IQ-TREE v. 1.6.12 (Nguyen et al. 2015)
generated a maximum likelihood phylogeny under an HKY+G4 nucleotide substitution model

with 1000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates after trimming the 5’ and 3’ ends of genomes. All
sequences were assigned to lineages by Pangolin v.2.0.4 (Rambaut et al. 2020). Variants were
annotated by the Coronapp web tool (http://giorgilab.dyndns.org/coronapp/) (Mercatelli et al.
2020) and clade defining SNPs were identified by a custom Python script.
Potential transmission clusters were detected by TreeCluster
(https://github.com/niemasd/TreeCluster; downloaded May 2020) (Balaban et al. 2019) under
the threshold-free setting and an optimized branch length threshold of 0.00068. TreeCluster
attempts to incorporate evolutionary distances and tree topology into defining transmission
clusters with the threshold-free approach identifying a distance that maximizes the number of
clusters with more than one member (Balaban et al. 2019). We tested other TreeCluster
algorithms, but the threshold-free approach was the most conservative – yielding more clusters
with fewer individuals (i.e. less diversity within a cluster). Although this approach showed
evidence of breaking known larger transmission chains into multiple clusters (such as cases
associated with the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Westchester County), we chose to be
conservative because we lacked associated epidemiological information for most of our
samples. As a comparison, we also included the results of the single-linkage min-cut
partitioning strategy, which finds the closest leaf outside a subtree and only cuts the pair of
nodes if their distance does not exceed a user-specified threshold (0.00068) (Balaban et al.
2019). This algorithm led to larger clusters with more diversity and fewer sequences that lacked
a cluster association, capturing deeper relationships within the tree as opposed to the tips. We
also chose to include smaller transmission chains (fewer than five individuals) because they
often showed inter-regional membership. Trees and annotations were visualized in FigTree
v.1.4.4 (https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/) or in R v.4.0.0 (http://www.R-project.org) with
the ggtree package (Yu et al. 2017).
Llama v.0.1 (https://cov-lineages.org/llama.html) placed all New York sequences generated by
the Wadsworth Center within a global phylogeny of >70,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes generated
by Dr. Rob Lanfear (downloaded on 7/27/2020, https://github.com/roblanf/sarscov2phylo/).
Llama incorporates query sequences into the global phylogeny and returns a subtree of closely
related sequences. These contextual sequences assisted us in determining whether
transmission clusters were seeded locally or via non-New York sources and were employed
downstream in phylogeographic analyses.
The R package Picante (Kembel et al. 2010) calculated alpha-diversity metrics (species richness
and divergence) for the ten regions of New York State (Capital District, Central New York, Finger
Lakes, Long Island, Mid-Hudson, Mohawk Valley, New York City, North Country, Southern Tier,
and Western New York). The mean pairwise distance (mpd) and mean nearest taxon distance
(mntd) functions determined the presence of phylogenetic structuring within each region (more
or less divergence than expected by chance). Both functions calculate average distances among
taxa within a community (all pairwise distances or the shortest distances) and compare the
expected amount of phylogenetic relatedness against a null distribution (Webb et al. 2008)
generated from 1000 community randomizations. Mpd is believed to capture community
structure more deeply within the tree while the mntd identifies structure closer to the tips

(Webb et al. 2008; Tucker et al. 2017). Calculations were performed at the Pangolin lineage
level and for all threshold-free transmission clusters represented in the New York tree.
We employed weighted (Lozupone et al. 2007) and unweighted UniFrac tests (Lozupone &
Knight 2005) in mothur v.1.44.3 (Schloss et al. 2009) to evaluate beta-diversity (or the
dissimilarity of viral communities) between regions. These methods rely on a phylogenetic tree
to measure evolutionary divergence between communities with the weighted method
incorporating abundance information as well. Weighted and unweighted UniFrac tests can be
employed to understand different aspects driving community structure (Lozupone et al. 2007).
The weighted UniFrac test detects shifts in relative abundances between communities while
the unweighted test is suited to identifying founding populations (Lozupone et al. 2007).
Whether regions display significantly different viral communities is evaluated by randomizing
the communities on the tree and recalculating UniFrac distances to determine the proportion
of trees with a distance greater than or equal to the observed data. P-values were adjusted for
multiple testing by the false discovery rate (FDR) with the p.adjust function in R.
Phylogeographic analyses
Phylogeographic analyses were conducted in Nextstrain v. 2.0.0.post1 (Hadfield et al. 2018)
using custom builds and the Nextstrain pipeline. The builds included New York SARS-CoV-2
genomes sequenced by the Wadsworth Center and a subset of New York sequences obtained
from GISAID. To place New York sequences in a global context, Nextstrain sub-sampled SARSCoV-2 genomes from the rest of the world based on genomic proximity, geography, and
temporal distribution, producing phylogenies of roughly 2700-3700 genomes. Sequences were
required to be ³ 29 Kb in length with £ 3% ambiguities and were masked at the first 100 and
last 50 positions. Additionally, problematic positions 13402, 24380, and 24390 were masked
before aligning with MAFFT v.7.470. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction was
performed in IQ-TREE v.2.0.3 with ancestral traits and divergence times inferred by TreeTime
v.0.7.6 (Sagulenko et al. 2018; Hadfield et al. 2018) and strain Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 (MN908947.3
or GISAID number EPI_ISL_402125) set as the root. Trees spanned from December 2019 to June
2020 and were visualized in Auspice.
Three phylogeographic analyses were also conducted in Beast v.2.6.2 9 (Bouckaert et al. 2019;
Lemey et al. 2009) under an exponential population model and geographic locations
(America/USA, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and New York) set as discrete traits to predict the source
of New York transmission clusters (as defined by the threshold-free approach in TreeCluster)
and to elucidate the breadth of the Westchester outbreak. Included in the first two analyses
were the earliest sequences from the Westchester outbreak (from individuals known to be
directly associated with the index), representatives from a subset of New York B.1.X
transmission clusters (as defined by the threshold-free approach in TreeCluster), a subset of
“contextual” sequences obtained from Nextstrain builds (including the earliest B.1 genomes
identified in Europe and the United States), and genomes identified by Llama as putatively
derived from out-of-state transmission. Two independent runs were performed with
representatives from 116/303 or 94/303 B.1.X transmission clusters that spanned the diversity
of B.1.X lineages in New York. The third analysis included the earliest representatives from

each B.1.X threshold-free transmission cluster that appeared between March and July (n=259,
excluding some that were consistently identified as out-of-state introductions by the first two
analyses), the index genome and those with an epidemiological link, and a subset of genomes
from the United States and Europe. Non-New York B.1.X genomes were randomly selected
between February to July from GISAID, with the number of genomes sampled each month
approximately equal to those of New York for a total of 596 sequences (more genomes were
randomly sampled from the United States as reduced transmission between countries after
nationwide lockdowns made international importations less likely (Magalis et al. 2020)). All
analyses were run under an HKY nucleotide substitution model with a gamma distribution and
four rate categories. The clock rate was fixed at 8x10-04 substitutions per site per year (Nie et al.
2020; Rambaut, Andrew 2020) under a normal prior with standard deviation set to 1x10-05.
Runs were monitored for convergence in Tracer v.1.7.1 (Rambaut et al. 2018) and stopped
when effective sample sizes were ³ 200 for all parameters. Maximum clade credibility trees
were generated by TreeAnnotator v.2.6.2 (Bouckaert et al. 2019; Heled & Bouckaert 2013) with
a 10% burn-in and node heights equal to the common ancestor (in order to avoid negative
branch lengths). BALTIC (https://github.com/evogytis/baltic) identified all New York sequences
that descended from a non-New York node. Hamming distances, the number of substitutions
between pairs of sequences excluding ambiguous positions and gaps, were calculated with snpdists v. 0.7.0 (https://github.com/tseemann/snp-dists) to determine the median number of
differences between genomes putatively linked to the Westchester outbreak and those
independently introduced to New York State.
Results and Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 diversity declines across New York State as regional phylogenetic structuring
emerges
Our analyses included 675 genomes sequenced by the Wadsworth Center from 56 out of 62
counties and all ten regions of New York. In total, 1854 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were analyzed,
sampled from 57 New York counties between March 2nd and September 30th, 2020
(Supplementary Table 1). The proportion of samples derived from males and females was
approximately equal (48% vs. 52%) with ~60% from those ³ 50 years of age (Supplementary
Table 1). The most heavily sampled regions were New York City, the Mid-Hudson (which
includes Westchester County, the site of the initial community outbreak in New York) and Long
Island – collectively referred to as “downstate” in this study (Figure 1). “Upstate” sequences –
those from the North Country, Capital District, Central New York, Southern Tier, Finger Lakes,
Mohawk Valley, and Western New York regions – represented about 25% of the dataset (Figure
1). Sampling was uneven among the ten regions, with downstate representing over 80% of the
samples in March and April but upstate representing most samples for the remaining months
(Supplementary Table 1). The number of sequences also decreased as a function of time, with
55% of the sequencing effort occurring in March and over 80% occurring in March and April
combined (Supplementary Table 1).
Although 24 Pangolin lineages were identified in the New York State dataset, 68% were
classified as B.1 and 94% had a B.1 or descendant Pangolin lineage designation (those with a

“B.1.X” nomenclature; Figure 1). The B.1 lineage was geographically and temporally ubiquitous
while others displayed a more checkered appearance (Figure 2). For example, the B.1.2 lineage
was significantly associated with the North Country (c2test p-value < 2.2x10-16), which harbored
more than half of the B.1.2 genomes but contributed to less than 3% of the total dataset
(Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, there was a significant association between Western New
York and the B.1.1 lineage (c2 test, p-value < 2.2x10-16). SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Western
New York comprised only 4.5% of the dataset (supplementary Table 2) but 30% of B.1.1
genomes derived from this region. The observed regional associations of some lineages could
be due to biased and limited sampling. However, the North Country represents the most
robustly sampled region in the dataset with four percent of the positive cases sequenced
(Supplementary Table 2). Although four B.1.2 genomes were linked to a senior living facility,
several genomes appeared to be sampled from the greater community. Less than one percent
of the positive cases from Western New York were sequenced (Supplementary Table 2), but the
wide distribution of sample ages suggests B.1.1 might have been the dominant lineage
circulating in the general population. Thus, despite sampling limitations, some regions appear
to be characterized by SARS-CoV-2 lineages that were less representative of the entire state,
implicating localized viral transmission as a greater influence on SARS-CoV-2 composition than
inter-regional spread.
Overall, the diversity of observed lineages decreased with time since the beginning of the New
York epidemic in March (Figure 2). This is particularly apparent by June-September, where
sequence diversity is solely concentrated in the B.1.X portion of the tree (Figure 2). This does
not take into account the more limited sequencing that occurred during later months, which
might hinder the ability to detect variants circulating at low frequency. In fact, three regions
with the greatest number of lineages in March (New York City, Mid-Hudson, and Long Island)
had no data available for various later months (as of the time of writing). The number of
lineages detected per month was significantly correlated with the number of samples
sequenced (Spearman rank correlation coefficient r=0.74, p-value=3.9x10-08) and randomly
down-sampling earlier months (March and April) to the size of May and June datasets revealed
significant decreases in the number of lineages identified (one-sample t-test p-values < 2.2x1016
). However, rarefaction analyses demonstrated that while lineages continued to be identified
as more regions were sampled for March and April, lineage richness remained essentially flat or
unchanged for May and June-September (Supplementary Figure 1), which suggests that
sampling bias did not substantially influence the underlying loss of diversity observed.
Phylogenetic structuring was detected at the Pangolin lineage level for the North Country and
the Southern Tier (Table 1), where the dominance of the B.1.2 lineage in the North Country and
the absence of A lineages in the Southern Tier (Figure 2) led to more similar sequences within
each region than expected by chance. The lack of significant structuring for the remaining eight
New York regions captures the presence of both A and B lineages within these regions (Table 1),
leading to sequences distributed across the tree (Figure 2). On a monthly basis, phylogenetic
structuring was not detected for any region at the beginning of the epidemic in New York State
(Supplementary Table 3). However, alpha-diversity significantly declined by June for many
regions (Supplementary Table 3), consistent with the lack of A and non-B.1.X lineages in later

months. This potentially reflects the changing transmission dynamics that occurred within New
York State once international travel restrictions and New York State on-pause measures were
imposed (March 19th and 22nd, respectively). While the initial presence of SARS-CoV-2 in New
York derived from several sources (Gonzalez-Reiche et al. 2020; Maurano et al. 2020), localized
transmission events appeared to be responsible for the continued presence of the virus during
summer months, including September.
The Westchester outbreak represents the largest transmission cluster in New York State,
reaching numerous areas, but clusters become more regionally distinct through time
The threshold-free approach in TreeCluster identified 325 New York transmission clusters (303
of which were assigned to B.1.X lineages) from March to September with 44% of genomes
belonging to a cluster of ³ 3 members and 36% having no cluster affiliation. Genomes from the
outbreak in Westchester County were assigned to the B.1 lineage and the Nextstrain 20C clade
based upon sequences from the index case and those with direct affiliation to Patient Zero. The
genome of the index case and those of the 20C clade deviate from the Wuhan-1 reference by
six mutations: C241T, C3037T, C14408T, A23403G, C1059T, and G25563T. The first four
mutations characterize the B.1 lineage while G25563T was present in the 20C parent lineage
circulating in Europe by January and February 2020. The C1059T mutation is present in only one
other genome collected in the United States prior to March, making It possible that most
genomes with this signature mutation are derived from the initial Westchester outbreak.
However, the threshold-free approach separated SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the Westchester
outbreak into at least four clusters (based on the phylogenetic position of the index and
epidemiologically linked genomes) that contained a total of 251 sequences, spanned 20
counties (12 upstate), and lasted from March 2 until early May 2020 (Figure3). The index
genome fell within a clade of 181 identical sequences, which deviated from the genomes in the
other three clusters by 1 SNP (excluding ambiguous positions led to identical sequences among
the two largest clusters). The SARS-CoV-2 genome from a known epidemiologically linked case
to the index was part of a separate transmission cluster and deviated from that of the index by
a single SNP not detected in any other New York genome examined. This raises the possibility
that there are other genomes related to the outbreak that were not included in our estimate.
The single-linkage cluster approach yielded 99 transmission clusters with 75% of sequences
belonging to a cluster of three or more members and only 19% lacking a cluster affiliation.
While the number of clusters with two or three members did not change substantially
(Supplementary Figure 2), genomes that were not assigned to a cluster by the threshold-free
approach tended to be subsumed into the Westchester outbreak. The Westchester outbreak as
defined by the single-linkage algorithm and the placement of the index genome contained 877
sequences, spanned 43 counties (32 upstate) and lasted 92 days (Figure 3). There was a
median Hamming distance of two between genomes of this cluster, consistent with results for
linked genomes in previous analyses (Dearlove et al. 2020). This suggests that the initial
community spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Westchester County was responsible for at least 13.5% to
47% of the cases represented in our dataset and 30-60% of all cases affiliated with a
transmission cluster, with widespread distribution across the state. While the threshold-free
approach likely underestimates the number of genomes linked to the initial Westchester

outbreak by only identifying clusters at the tips of the tree instead of sustained transmission
chains, the single-linkage strategy might misassign genomes to this cluster by capturing the
shared ancestry of B.1.X sequences.
At the transmission cluster level (defined by the threshold-free approach), downstate areas of
New York City, Long Island, and Mid-Hudson consistently exhibited significant phylogenetic
structuring, either aggregated over all months or on a monthly basis for mntd and mpd
calculations (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 4). These results appear to capture the
dynamics of the Westchester outbreak as well as upstate SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns.
Sequences from upstate could be found interspersed throughout the New York State phylogeny
- in predominantly downstate clades, such as the Westchester outbreak and in regionally
specific clades - leading to larger distances among SARS-CoV-2 genomes from these
communities (Figure 4). While outbreaks downstate (such as the one in Westchester County)
contributed to seeding upstate transmission chains, the effects of upstate transmission to
downstate appear minimal. The sparse sampling of New York City, Long Island, and the MidHudson after May might also contribute to the pattern observed and prevents us from
evaluating the full extent of SARS-CoV-2 exchange between the two areas. Sequences from
upstate regions span all months considered and therefore encompass a greater proportion of
the evolution that has occurred along the New York phylogeny (Figure 4). In contrast, the
diversity detected downstate is largely confined to the early months of the pandemic in New
York State (Figure 4).
Weighted UniFac analyses of beta-diversity indicated that all regions harbored phylogenetically
distinct viral communities (Table 3). Stratifying by month uncovered a more complicated
pattern, where viral communities became generally more distinct as a function of time (Figure 4
and Supplementary Table 5). This could be due to limited travel within New York and between
New York and other states after March, which restricted SARS-CoV-2 transmission to more
regional or even county-level scales. Results could also be influenced by differences in sampling
strategies between months, with broader surveillance efforts in earlier months and an
increased focus on outbreaks after May. However, transmission dynamics had also changed by
May, with the number of infections declining drastically and localized outbreaks comprising a
larger proportion of positive cases. For example, the percentage of transmission clusters
composed of genomes from more than one region declined from 29% in March to 4% in May.
By June, no clusters contained genomes from more than one region, suggesting on-pause
measures were largely effective, although the New York City metropolitan area was severely
under-sampled. Regardless, this trend is similar to the dynamics identified at the global level,
which showed a decline in the number and size of transmission clusters as well as the number
of multi-country clusters after the implementation of national lockdowns and travel restrictions
(Magalis et al. 2020).
Unweighted UniFrac tests largely mirrored the results of weighted UniFrac analyses (Table 3
and Supplementary Table 5). Additionally, unweighted UniFrac results were consistent with the
conclusion that downstate regions of New York City, the Mid-Hudson, and Long Island served as
significant viral sources for all upstate areas except Western New York (Figure 5). This is

observed most acutely for March, when SARS-CoV-2 beta-diversity between five of the six
upstate regions (the Finger Lakes was excluded because of small sample size) and at least one
downstate region was not significantly different than expected by chance. Further, the SARSCoV-2 viral communities of four upstate regions did not significantly diverge from any of those
downstate (Figure 5). In contrast, upstate regions showed less similarity to each other (Figure 5
and Supplementary Table 5). The SARS-CoV-2 viral community of Western New York remained
consistently different from the rest of New York, suggesting that transmission from downstate
and other upstate regions did not heavily influence its composition.
Examining the number of shared transmission clusters between each county/borough with
more than five sequences in at least one cluster indicated a strong association of viral
communities in the downstate area, including Westchester, Rockland, Nassau, Suffolk, Queens,
Manhattan, Richmond, and Brooklyn (Figure 5). These results reflect the rapid spread of SARSCoV-2 through a heavily interconnected area but contrast UniFrac analyses, which showed the
viral communities of New York City, Mid-Hudson, and Long Island as significantly different from
each other. The discrepancy highlights the impact of including sequences without a cluster
association, which helped to distinguish downstate regions in UniFrac analyses. Counties within
other regions also tended to group together based on Jaccard distances of shared clusters
(Figure 5), supporting the overall distinct composition of regional SARS-CoV-2 viral communities
by the end of September.
Phylogeographic analyses reveal transmission dynamics characterized by within-state spread
of SARS-CoV-2
Nextstrain phylogeographic analyses of more than 800 New York sequences and a subset of
global sequences deposited on GISAID displayed the association of New York genomes with
those from other states and countries (Supplementary Figure 3) as previously observed
(Maurano et al. 2020; Gonzalez-Reiche et al. 2020). However, most New York genomes were
concentrated in the 20C clade with an inferred date of introduction into Westchester County
between mid to late February, depending on the Nextstrain build interrogated (eg. 100% CI,
2020-02-22 to 2020-02-23). These estimates are in general agreement with those of prior
analyses (Worobey et al. 2020; Maurano et al. 2020) and overlap with the probable timing of
infection and onset of symptoms of the index case (Gold & Ferré-Sadurní 2020).
Phylogeographic analyses conducted by BEAST indicated that up to 75% of the 303 B.1.X
clusters derived from within-state transmission, although posterior probabilities for locations
ranged from 0.70-1.0 depending on the Bayesian analysis (Figure 6). Llama assigned 65% of
B.1.X genomes sequenced by the Wadsworth Center to a single monophyletic clade comprised
of New York sequences. In other words, the majority of New York genomes sequenced by the
Wadsworth Center remained most closely related to other New York sequences despite being
placed within a global phylogeny. Given these results and the fact that 94% of SARS-CoV-2
genomes in New York State were of B.1 ancestry, the epidemic appeared to be fueled largely by
within-state viral transmission after various initial introductions. This conclusion also agrees
with epidemiological investigations of early SARS-CoV-2 cases in New York State, which found

only 30% to be potentially associated with international or out-of-state travel (Rosenberg et al.
2020a), again demonstrating the effectiveness of on-pause measures limiting travel.
A large proportion of B.1.X transmission clusters (27-50%) in the three BEAST analyses were
associated with in-state viral transmission related to the Westchester County outbreak given
the phylogenetic placement of the index and epidemiologically linked samples (Figure 6 and
Supplementary Figure 4). The most conservative estimate derived from the third analysis
containing the greatest proportion of B.1.X clusters (Figure 6). A total of 258 clusters,
representing 981 genomes were represented, of which 69 clusters representing 429 genomes
or 44% of all New York sequences in the analysis were related to the Westchester outbreak (not
including two possible re-importation events). At a minimum, this would indicate that
approximately 23% of all genomes in the entire New York dataset (429/1859) were linked to
the Westchester outbreak. There was a median Hamming distance of one substitution
between members of Westchester-affiliated clusters (n=429) and a median distance of four
substitutions between these genomes and the rest of the dataset (n=981). We then calculated
Hamming distances for 100 random samples of B.1.X sequences from Europe, the United
States, and the Westchester outbreak (n=200 genomes) between March and May. The median
Hamming distance between Westchester-related genomes and global representatives was also
four (Supplementary Figure 5). These distances are fairly consistent with previous analyses,
which found a median Hamming distance of 2 between epidemiologically linked samples and
five substitutions between all globally sampled genomes (n=12814) through May with a D614G
mutation (Dearlove et al. 2020).
The most conservative Bayesian estimate for the number of cases attributable to the
Westchester outbreak falls between those of the threshold-free and single-linkage clustering
algorithms (13.5-47%). The least conservative estimates (Supplementary Figure 4) are similar
to the proportion of genomes associated with a superspreading event in Massachusetts
(Lemieux et al. 2020). Even less conservatively, the Westchester outbreak would be responsible
for over >76% of New York SARS-CoV-2 infections if we consider the founding of the 20C clade
in the state to be a single event synonymous with the Westchester outbreak based on the
defining C1059T mutation and the lack of other genomes with this signature in the United
States prior to March (except one). However, our conclusions are tempered by several factors.
As the number of clusters and non-New York samples increased, the number of cases
associated with the Westchester outbreak decreased, highlighting the sensitivity of
phylogeographic analyses to sampling strategy, particularly in the face of limited genetic
diversity (Lemey et al. 2020; Frost et al. 2015). While the number of SARS-CoV-2 introductions
and the clusters associated with importation events were generally consistent among the three
analyses, fluctuations were observed. For example, the ancestral locations associated with
B.1.2 transmission clusters changed from New York to America/USA as more closely related
sequences and earlier sampled cases from other states were added (Supplementary Figure 4).
Further, the phylogenetic positions of key genomes might be relatively uninformative as the
small internal branch lengths and subsequent low posterior probabilities for splits within the
20C clade essentially transform it into a star phylogeny. While this could be interpreted as the
rapid expansion of the Westchester outbreak it might also reflect the rapid global dissemination

of the B.1 lineage, which led to transmission rates that outpaced the viral substitution rate
(Bedford et al. 2020). Given the low overall diversity of SARS-CoV-2 (Dearlove et al 2020), that
thousands of people might have been infected with the virus by the time of the first
documented case of community transmission (Perkins et al. 2020) and that millions were
estimated to be infected by the end of March (Rosenberg et al. 2020b), it is possible that closely
related/identical but unsampled genomes seeded transmission chains that we ascribe to the
Westchester outbreak.
All BEAST analyses provided evidence for multiple introductions of B.1.2, B.1.5, and B.1.1
lineages (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 4). The B.1.1 lineage was prevalent in Europe
(https://cov-lineages.org/lineages.html) and our phylogeographic analyses suggest that some
B.1.1 transmission chains were due to travel between New York and European countries while
others originated via inter-state routes (Supplementary Figure 4). The independent introduction
of the B.1.1 lineage into different New York regions supports the results from community
structure analyses, which suggested that SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Western New
York – predominantly influenced by the spread of the B.1.1 lineage - were largely independent
of the rest of New York State.
Conclusions
We have deposited >600 sequences from 56 out of 62 counties and all ten regions of New York
to GISAID to provide a more detailed picture of statewide transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from
March to September. The analysis shows the widespread distribution of the B.1 lineage and its
increase in relative abundance through time, recapitulating the global trend (Korber et al. 2020;
van Dorp et al. 2020). Both community structure and phylogeographic analyses suggest that a
large proportion of B.1.X transmission clusters were due to within-state transmission and were
related to the initial Westchester outbreak in March. From there, SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted
to other downstate regions (New York City, Long Island, and other Mid-Hudson counties) and
various counties of upstate New York. Indeed, the only counties that showed little relation to
the initial outbreak were in the Western region of the state, but there are certainly many
unsampled transmission chains. Results from phylogeographic and community structure
analyses also showed downstate as a potential transmission hub. The index case associated
with the Westchester outbreak had attended large religious gatherings before being confirmed
as SARS-CoV-2 positive. Although around 1,000 people affiliated with the index patient were
asked to self-quarantine (Jones & Maxouris 2020) and additional measures were implemented
thereafter, the geographic and temporal breadth as well as the high membership of the
Westchester outbreak – defined by threshold-free, single-linkage or phylogeographic strategies
- underscore the consequences of even small delays in containment efforts and the
disproportionate contribution large congregate settings can have in spreading the virus.
However, the limited divergence of the virus combined with rapid transmission rates and
under-sampling may obscure underlying sources of transmission ascribed to a single outbreak
event (Worobey et al. 2020). While quantifying the number of cases related to the Westchester
outbreak may not be truly possible, our application of multiple strategies to assess its impact
demonstrates the importance of rapidly implementing containment measures.

Some upstate regions were dominated by lineages other than B.1 – such as Western New York,
North Country, and the Mohawk Valley - frequently representing importation events and
suggesting that these regions were less influenced by viral transmission from other New York
areas. However, all regional SARS-CoV-2 communities became increasingly distinct since the
start of the New York epidemic in March, possibly reflecting the effects of limited travel due to
national restrictions and New York State on-pause measures. Thus, these data demonstrate
that adherence to social distancing, mask-wearing, and the closure of schools and non-essential
businesses as part of the on-pause measures were ultimately successful in curbing transmission
across regions.

Figure 2. Heatmap of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the ten regions of New York State. Heatmap of the relative frequency of SARS-CoV-2 lineages
represented in the associated phylogeny for each New York State region from March through September 2020 and aggregated over all months. The
heatmap colors indicate lineage frequencies per region per month or aggregated per region (note: 0.8 frequency represents 0.8-1.0). Tallies from
June-September were combined due to smaller samples sizes. Cap, Capital District; Cen, Central; FiL, Finger Lakes; Lis, Long Island; Hud, Hudson;

Figure 5. Connections among regions and counties of New York State based on SARS-CoV-2 diversity metrics. a) Circle plot of potential
connections among nine of ten New York State regions as evaluated by beta-diversity metrics for the month of March. Regions that did not have
significantly different SARS-CoV-2 communities (as determined by unweighted UniFrac tests), are connected by a line. Green lines are connections
between downstate regions and those of upstate. Blue lines signify connections between upstate regions. While all downstate regions have at
least one connection to upstate regions (except Western New York), the SARS-CoV-2 communities of many upstate regions do not appear similar.
b) Dendrogram generated from Jaccard distances of shared transmission clusters among New York counties. Only counties with five sequences in
one or more transmission cluster were considered. The dendrogram highlights the cohesive group formed by downstate counties. Several counties
from upstate group by region but there are also outliers, suggesting transmission chains are less extensive in these areas than in the
interconnected New York City metropolitan area (The five boroughs of New York City and surrounding counties). Cap, Capital District; Cen, Central;

Figure 6. Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree of B.1.X SARS-CoV-2 entry in New York State. Bayesian time-calibrated phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2
genomes. New York state sequences represent a subset of transmission clusters (n=258) belonging to B.1.X Pangolin lineages sampled through the
end of July. B.1.X SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the United States and Europe were randomly sampled from the same time period (with preference
given for the United States). a) MCC tree with branches and nodes colored by inferred ancestral location. Associated heatmap depicts the Pangolin
lineage assignments for New York SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The clade representing the Westchester outbreak is shaded in gray with genomes from
the index case and epidemiologically linked genomes from Westchester in yellow. Noted is the C1059T mutation defining the 20C clade. Posterior
probabilities > 0.9 are shown. b) Enlargement of the Westchester outbreak clade with tips labeled by their threshold-free transmission cluster
assignment (for New York SARS CoV-2 genomes) and nodes colored by ancestral location. Ancestral location probabilities > 0.9 are shown.

Supplementary Figure 1. Rarefaction curves for the number of lineages detected by month as sites are
randomly added to the sampling pool. Species richness (SR) of SARS-CoV-2 lineages identified as a function of
the number of sites (New York State regions) sampled and the month of sampling to take into account
different sampling intensities. While the number of lineages detected continues to increase as sites continue
to be sampled for March and April, the curves are essentially flat for May and June-September. The rates of
increase are also higher for earlier months. Vertical lines indicate standard errors associated with random
permutations. Calculations were performed by Picante in R with the speaccum.psr function.

Supplementary Figure 4. Additional Bayesian phylogeographic analyses of the B.1 lineage. Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees including
representatives from subsets of New York State B.1.X transmission clusters (a) n=94; b) n=116) and global SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Branches and
nodes are colored by inferred ancestral location and posterior probabilities > 0.9 are shown. Associated heatmap depicts the Pangolin lineage
assignments for New York SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The trees highlight that most B.1.X lineage clusters derive from within-state transmission and
many are linked to the initial Westchester outbreak (shaded in gray) rooted by epidemiologically linked genomes to the index case. The C1059T
mutation represents the defining mutation of the 20C clade.

Hamming distance

Supplementary Figure 5. Hamming distances between SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Histogram of Hamming
distances between a random subsampling of New York State genomes affiliated with the Westchester County
outbreak (as defined by BEAST) and a random sampling of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the United States and
Europe through May (n=200). Calculations were performed for 100 randomizations of both datasets. The
median distance between Westchester related sequences was one while the median distance between
Westchester sequences and others was four.
