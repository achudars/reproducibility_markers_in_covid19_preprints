Abstract
Objective Severe COVID-19 has been anecdotally associated with high insulin
requirements. It has been proposed that this may be driven by a direct diabetogenic
effect of the virus that is unique to SARS-CoV-2, but evidence to support this is
limited. To explore this, we compared insulin requirements in patients with severe
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis.
Research Design Retrospective cohort study of patients with severe COVID-19
admitted to our intensive care unit between March and June 2020. A historical
control cohort of non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis patients was identified from
routinely collected audit data.
Results Insulin requirements were similar in patients with COVID-19 and nonCOVID-19 viral pneumonitis after adjustment for pre-existing diabetes and severity of
respiratory failure.
Conclusions In this single center study, we could not find evidence of a unique
diabetogenic effect of COVID-19. We suggest that high insulin requirements in this
disease relate to its propensity to cause severe respiratory failure in patients with
pre-existing metabolic disease.

Introduction
There is emerging interest in the effect of COVID-19 on glucose homeostasis, with
some suggesting that COVID-19 may be a uniquely diabetogenic virus [1].
Observations advanced to support this hypothesis include anecdotal reports of high
insulin requirements in patients with severe COVID-19 [2-5]. However, to date there
has been no longitudinal study of patients with COVID-19 to empirically assess
insulin requirements. We sought to address this deficiency by comparing insulin
requirements in patients admitted to intensive care with severe COVID-19 to a
historical control group with severe non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis.

Research Design and Methods

Case Identification
Patients admitted to ICU in Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge with a positive
SARS-CoV-2 test were identified. Patients were deemed to have COVID-19
pneumonitis and included in the study if they were SARS-CoV-2 positive and were
treated for respiratory failure that was attributed to COVID-19 pneumonitis by the
treating team during their ICU stay.

The non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis cohort was identified from the ICU’s routinely
collected audit data from 2014 to 2019. Patients admitted with a diagnosis of viral
pneumonia recorded as their primary, secondary or ultimate reason for admission to
intensive care were included in the analysis.

Data Collection
Data collection was undertaken manually from electronic medical records by trained,
clinical investigators. Blood glucose data was collected using proprietary analytics
software, Qlikview. Further detail is available in the supplementary appendix.

Matching
Patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonitis were matched according to diabetes
status and level of respiratory support received in a 1:1 ratio to a historical control
cohort of patients admitted to ICU with non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis. Further
data is available in the supplementary appendix.

Statistical Analysis
Details of the statistical analysis are available in the supplementary appendix.

Ethical review statement
As a retrospective analysis of anonymized, routinely collected data the requirement
for ethical committee review and consent was waived by the National Health Service
Health Research Authority, the evaluation was registered with the responsible
healthcare organization (Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust).

Results
During the study period March to June 2020 we identified 92 patients treated for
severe COVID-19 within our intensive care unit (Supplementary Appendix Figure 1).
In univariate linear regression analysis, BMI, pre-existing Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes
and severity of respiratory failure assessed by ordinal scale (0 – self ventilating, 1mechanical ventilation, 2 – neuromuscular blockade, 3 – nebulized epoprostenol, 4 –
prone ventilation, 5 – extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) were all associated
with insulin dose when analyzed by the average dose across the whole ICU stay or
by the highest cumulative insulin dose over a 24 hour period

(Supplementary

Appendix, Table 1).

To determine if the observed insulin requirements were a unique feature of COVID19 we examined insulin requirements in 46 patients admitted to our ICU with a
diagnosis of non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis between 2014 and 2019. 89% of the
non-COVID-19 cohort had a confirmed viral isolate consistent with viral pneumonia.
5 patients included in the analysis did not have any relevant positive virology related
to their ICU admission but were diagnosed with viral pneumonitis on clinical grounds
while 2 patients had more than 1 virus identified that could have explained their
symptoms (Supplementary Appendix, Table 2 for a breakdown of viral isolates).
Insulin requirements were higher in patients with COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19
viral pneumonitis while mean glycemic indices were comparable in both groups
(Figure 1A-B and Supplementary Appendix Figure 2A-B). However, the groups were
poorly balanced with respect to diabetes status and requirement for respiratory
salvage therapies (Supplementary Appendix, Table 3), multiple regression analysis
did not identify any association between COVID-19 and insulin dose after adjustment

for pre-existing diabetes and severity of respiratory failure (Supplementary Appendix
Table 4). Similarly, when COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis patients
were matched (1:1, N = 36 per group) by the level of respiratory support required
and pre-existing diabetes status, the proportion of patients requiring insulin (COVID19: 41%, non-COVID-19: 49%) and insulin dose was similar in those who were
treated with insulin (Figure 1C-D and Supplementary Figure 2C-D).
Finally, we sought to determine if the insulin requirements observed in patients with
COVID-19 resolved in convalescence. We had information on discharge medication
in 61/62 patients who survived to hospital discharge. Of these patients 39 required
insulin while in ICU but on discharge only 5 patients were discharged from hospital
on subcutaneous insulin, 4 of whom were on insulin prior to admission. The one
patient commenced on insulin had Type 2 Diabetes prior to admission managed with
oral therapy, insulin was discontinued soon after discharge when they were
readmitted with hypoglycemia. There was no initiation or escalation in oral
hypoglycemic agents in the cohort, however we cannot comment on the adequacy of
glycemic control. Similar findings from a smaller cohort have recently been reported
[3].

Conclusions
We report here, to the best of our knowledge, the first longitudinal assessment of
glycemia and insulin requirements in patients who are critically ill with COVID-19.
Our data suggest that high insulin requirements observed in patients with severe
COVID-19 is related to the severity of respiratory failure and pre-existing diabetes
mellitus rather than a direct diabetogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, there is
currently no rationale to adopt novel strategies or different glycemic thresholds to

manage hyperglycemia in COVID-19 compared to other viral pneumonias. Moreover,
the comparable insulin requirements in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral
pneumonitis when severity of illness and pre-existing diabetes are accounted for
argue against a direct action of SARS-CoV-2 on the pancreatic β-cell as the likely
cause of hyperglycaemia in COVID-19, as has been suggested previously [6]. In
addition, our data suggest that the hyperglycemia observed in patients with COVID19 is transient and resolves in convalescence and leads us to caution studies
describing new-onset diabetes in patients with COVID-19 based on cross-sectional
blood glucose measurements [7].
However, our analysis is limited by its relatively small sample size and its single
center nature. Further determination of the specific effects of COVID-19 infection as
opposed to the effects of general critical illness will require collection of data from
larger, well matched cohorts with other precipitating causes of stress hyperglycemia.
It should be noted that we cannot exclude the existence of rare hyperglycemic
syndromes triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. For example, our study cannot
inform the etiological role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in autoimmune diabetes as has
been studied in larger epidemiological analyses [8-10]. Large, registry-based studies
(e.g. COVIDIAB registry) with prolonged follow-up will be required to study this and
to determine the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection on glucose metabolism
more broadly.

In conclusion, high insulin requirements in severe COVID-19 likely relate to the
severity of respiratory failure and the high prevalence of metabolic disease in
patients with severe illness. When these factors are accounted for, insulin
requirements are comparable to that seen in non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis.

Methods
Study Centre
All patients included in the study were managed in Addenbrooke’s hospital intensive
care unit which includes a 20-bed general intensive care unit with a further 12 high
and intermediate dependency beds which were repurposed as critical care beds as
required during the pandemic, and a 27-bed specialist neurocritical care unit.

Glycemic control
Our departmental policy for management of hyperglycaemia in critical care advises
commencement of a variable rate intravenous insulin therapy when two consecutive
blood glucose readings are >10 mmol/L if there has been no recent (within 6 hours)
hypoglycaemia. The rate of intravenous insulin infusion is adjusted by bedside
nursing staff depending on blood glucose according to a standard prescription which
can be titrated by medical staff with the aim of maintain a target blood glucose of 610mmol/L. In patients with persistent hyperglycaemia or high insulin requirements,
subcutaneous basal insulin may be commenced under the advice of the specialist
diabetes team. When this was added it was solely with the intention of improving
glycaemic control. There was not, to our knowledge, any case where subcutaneous

insulin therapy was used in an effort to spare syringe pumps during the COVID-19
pandemic.

Data Collection
Demographic data was manually collected from review of the participant electronic
medical record. Admission values for cross sectional variables such as age and BMI
were recorded.

A diagnosis of pre-morbid diabetes mellitus was recorded if the patient was on any
anti-hyperglycemic therapy, if they had a recorded diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in
their problem list or if they had a pre-morbid HbA1c that was diagnostic of Diabetes
according to World Health Organisation Diagnostic Criteria (48 mmol/mol or over).
Diabetes mellitus was attributed to Type 2 Diabetes unless there was a positive
diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes recorded in the notes. Prior to admission
hyperglycaemic therapy was documented according to the reconciled medications
list in the electronic medical record and the medicines administration record was
used to determine anti-hyperglycaemic therapies used while in hospital. The
discharge summary was used to determine antihyperglycaemic medications that
were continued on discharge.
Insulin doses recorded were the sum of all subcutaneous and intravenous insulin
administered during the patient’s stay in intensive care.

Acute corticosteroid use was examined and the number of days that corticosteroids
were administered was recorded. We did not include corticosteroid use that was
prescribed regularly prior to admission.

APACHE II scores were collected on admission to intensive care and were obtained
from routinely collected audit data.

Matching
Patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonitis were matched in a 1:1 ratio to a
historical control cohort of patients admitted to ICU with non-COVID-19 viral
pneumonitis. Subjects were strictly matched so that the level of respiratory support
received (e.g. mechanical ventilation, neuromuscular blockade, epoprostenol
therapy, prone ventilation and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) and diabetes
status were identical. If there was more than one suitable match then age was used
(as age was significantly associated with insulin requirements when added to the
model presented in supplementary table 3), if age was similar (tolerance +/- 5 years)
then BMI was reviewed, if BMI was similar (tolerance +/-2.5 kg/m2) then Sex was
reviewed. These criteria were pre-specified prior to matching and undertaken blinded
to knowledge of insulin requirements.

Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test was used for comparing means of normally distributed data, MannWhitney U test and Wilcoxon Rank test were used for comparing unpaired and
paired non-normally distributed data, respectively.

The level of maximum respiratory support required during the ICU stay was assigned
an ordinal scale : 0 – self ventilating, 1- mechanical ventilation, 2 – neuromuscular
blockade, 3 – nebulized epoprostenol, 4 – prone ventilation, 5 – extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation. The regression co-efficients and p-values reported are from

a model encoding respiratory support as a continuous variable but a sensitivity
analysis encoding respiratory support as a categorical variable showed similar
results.
For the purposes of analysis, the number of days receiving steroids was normalized
according to the length of stay to avoid the confounding effects of duration of ICU
stay.
Insulin requirements (both maximum use in a single day and mean daily use) were
right skewed and were squareroot transformed to facilitate regression analysis. For
multiple regression analysis diabetes status and level of required respiratory support
were included in the model as these two variables were unbalanced in the COVID-19
and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis groups and were the most significant predictors
of insulin requirement. The addition of age and BMI to the model (which were both
significant in univariate analysis) did not improve the predictive ability of the model
as assessed by a likelihood ratio test, nor did they alter the relationship between
COVID-19 and insulin requirement.

The results reported are from linear regression analysis of the whole data set but
similar results were observed (e.g. COVID-19 was not a significant predictor of
insulin requirements after addition of an index of respiratory support and diabetes
status were added to the model) using tobit regression with censoring at 0 or if
insulin requirement was dichotomized to those requiring and not requiring insulin and
analyzed by binomial regression.

Statistical analysis was conducted using Graphpad Prism version 8.4.3 and R.
