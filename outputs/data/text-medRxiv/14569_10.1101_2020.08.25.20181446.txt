Abstract

21

Background SARS-CoV-2 could infect people at all ages, and the viral shedding and

22

immunological features of children COVID-19 patients were analyzed.

23

Methods Epidemiological information and clinical data were collected from 35

24

children patients. Viral RNAs in respiratory and fecal samples were detected. Plasma

25

of 11 patients were collected and measured for 48 cytokines.

26

Results 40% (14/35) of the children COVID-19 patients showed asymptomatic

27

infections, while pneumonia shown by CT scan occurred in most of the cases (32/35,

28

91.43%). Elevated LDH, AST, CRP, neutropenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia and

29

thrombocytopenia occurred in some cases, and CD4 and CD8 counts were normal. A

30

total of 22 cytokines were significantly higher than the healthy control, and IP-10,

31

IFN-α2 of them in children were significantly lower than the adult patients.

32

Meanwhile, MCP-3, HGF, MIP-1α, and IL-1ra were similar or lower than healthy

33

control, while significantly lower than adult patients. Viral RNAs were detected as

34

early as the first day after illness onset (d.a.o) in both the respiratory and fecal

35

samples. Viral RNAs decreased as the disease progression and mostly became

36

negative in respiratory samples within 18 d.a.o, while maintained relatively stable

37

during the disease progression and still detectable in some cases during 36~42 d.a.o.

38

Conclusion COVID-19 in children was mild, and asymptomatic infection was

39

common. Immune responses were relatively normal in children COVID-19 patients.

40

Cytokine storm also occurred in children patients, while much weaker than adult

41

patients. Positive rate of viral RNAs in fecal samples was high, and profile of viral

42

shedding were different between respiratory and gastrointestinal tract.

Background

46

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome

47

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was firstly reported in late December, 2019 [1, 2], and

48

rapidly caused the ongoing pandemic [3]. As of Apr. 24, 2020, a total of 2,549,632

49

cases with 175,825 fatal cases were reported all around the world [3]. Although

50

majority of the COVID-19 patients were adults, children patients were also found

51

with a small portion [4-9]. Recently, some studies have revealed the clinical and

52

epidemiological characteristics of children COVID-19 cases, and found that children

53

patients mostly show mild respiratory symptoms and even asymptomatic infection [7,

54

8, 10].

55

Viral shedding varies in different viruses and ages, and elucidation of the viral

56

shedding profile is crucial for the laboratory diagnosis, treatment and control of

57

COVID-19. Recent studies have elucidated the viral shedding patterns of

58

SARS-CoV-2 mainly based on adult patients [11-14]. Cytokine storm, which

59

contributes to acute lung injury and development of acute respiratory distress

60

syndrome (ARDS) [15], has been found during SARS-CoV-2 infection [16-18].

61

Meanwhile, several cytokines have been shown to closely associate with the diseases

62

severity and outcome of COVID-19 in adults [18]. However, whether the cytokine

63

storm occurred in children patients is also currently unclear. In this study, we analyzed

64

the viral shedding and immunological features of children COVID-19 patients based

65

on a case series of 35 laboratory-confirmed children COVID-19 patients.

Methods

67

Patient information and data collection

68

A total of 35 children COVID-19 patients hospitalized in our hospital were included

69

for the analyses. 50 adult COVID-19 patients and 8 healthy controls reported

70

elsewhere were also included for comparison [18]. Clinical information and

71

laboratory result were collected at the earliest time-point after hospitalization. The

72

study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committees of Shenzhen Third People’s

73

Hospital. Informed consents were obtained from all patients or patients family

74

members. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference

75

on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of

76

Helsinki and institutional ethics guidelines.

77
78

Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)

79

qRT-PCR were done as previously reported [18, 19]. In brief, throat swabs, nasal

80

swabs, sputum and rectal swabs were collected from children COVID-19 patients

81

upon admission and thereafter. Viral RNAs were extracted from clinical specimens

82

using the QIAamp RNA Viral Kit (Qiagen, Heiden, Germany). A China Food and

83

Drug Administration (CDFA) approved commercially kit (BioGerm Co., Shanghai,

84

China) were used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific RNAs. Samples with a

85

cycle threshold (Ct) value ≤ 37.0 were considered putatively positive. Samples whose

86

Ct was higher than 37 were re-tested and considered positive if Ct was ≥ 37 but ≤ 40

87

and negative if viral RNAs were undetectable on the second test.

88
89

Cytokine and chemokine measurements

90

The plasma of the children COVID-19 patients (N=11) were collected at the earliest

91

possible time-point after hospitalization. The concentrations of 48 cytokines and

92

chemokines were measured using Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine Screening Panel

93

(Bio-Rad) as previously reported together with plasma collected from 50 adult

94

patients and 8 healthy control [17, 18].

95
96

Disease severity classification of children COVID-19 patients

97

Disease severity classification were evaluated as previously reported [17, 19], except

98

that the criterion of severe COVID-19 for children is defined as following: 1)

99

respiratory distress with the exclusion of cry and fever (age specific reference ranges:

100

< 2 months: respiration rate (RR) ≥ 60/min; 2~12 months: RR ≥ 50/min; > 5 years:

101

RR ≥ 30/min), 2) resting oxygen saturation ≤ 92%, or 3) Assisted respiration,

102

cyanosis or intermittent apnea, 4) somnolence, convulsions, 5) Refusing to eat or

103

difficult to feed, symptoms of dehydration.

Statistical analysis

106

Fisher exact test was used to compare the indicated rates between the symptomatic

107

and asymptomatic cases. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare plasma cytokine

108

levels between two groups. All statistical tests were calculated using Graphpad Prism

109

7.0 for Windows. P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

111

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of children COVID-19 patients.

112

A total of 35 children COVID-19 patients were included in our study. The median age

113

is 7.5 with a range of 1.5 to 17 years-old, and 13 (37.14%) were male. Two case

114

possessed chronic respiratory diseases, one is asthma and the other pharyngitis.

115

Cough (41.94%) was the most common initial symptoms, followed by fever (38.71%).

116

Expectoration, headache, chill and diarrhea also occasionally happened in some cases.

117

Of note, 40% the cases showed asymptomatic infections. 32 (93.55%) children’s

118

family possessed at least 1 infected family member, while three children were the

119

only COVID-19 cases in their family. 26 children were reported to be either living in

120

Wuhan or having family members who visited Wuhan/Hubei. The median days of

121

onset to admission and duration of hospitalization is 0 and 17, respectively. Viral

122

RNAs were detected in fecal samples from 17 (48.57%) cases. Pneumonia occurred in

123

most of the cases (32/35, 91.43%), and hepatic insufficiency also occurred in some

124

cases (5/35, 14.29%). Of all the 35 cases, 32 cases were moderate, and 3 were mild

125

cases. 34 patients received antiviral treatment within 5 d.a.o, and 85.71% (30/35) of

126

the children received antiviral treatment within 2 d.a.o (Table S1). The combination of

127

interferon alpha and lopinavir was the most frequently used antiviral treatment, and

128

no patients received gamma globulin, corticosteroid or mechanical ventilation

129

treatments. All the patients discharged from hospital (Table S1).

Laboratory and CT findings of children COVID-19 patients.

132

A complete blood count with differential was assessed for each patient either on the

133

date of hospital admission, or at the earliest time-point after admission (Table 2).

134

Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate amino transferase (AST), C-reactive

135

protein (CRP), neutropenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred

136

in some cases with different rates. CT scan of the children patients showed

137

ground-glass, hazy patchy shadows or high density shadows, mainly in the peripheral

138

part of the lung (Figure S1). Moreover, 57.14% of patients showed bilateral

139

involvement of the lung, and 34.29% showed unilateral involvement. Furthermore,

140

based on the initial symptoms, the cases were divided into symptomatic (n=21) and

141

asymptomatic (n=14) groups. Elevated LDH, AST, CRP, neutropenia, leukopenia,

142

lymphopenia as well as unilateral and bilateral involvement of lung were also found

143

in asymptomatic cases, with no statistic differences when compared to the

144

symptomatic cases. Except for CPR which was higher in symptomatic cases, the other

145

indexes of complete blood count were comparable between the two groups.

147

Expression profiles of cytokines in children COVID-19 patients.

150

that 22 cytokines were significantly higher than the healthy control. Of the 22

151

cytokines, IP-10 and IFN-α2 in children were significantly lower than the adult

152

patients, and the others comparable. Meanwhile, MCP-3, HGF, MIP-1α, IL-6, M-CSF,

153

CTACK and IL-18 were similar with healthy control, while significantly lower than

154

adult patients. IL-1ra was significantly elevated in adult patients, while it was lower

than the healthy control in children.

Profile of viral shedding in children COVID-19 patients.

158

The viral loads were detected by qRT-PCR upon admission and thereafter. Daily

159

measurements of viral load from respiratory and fecal specimens are summarized in

160

Figure 2, lower Ct values indicated higher viral loads. In respiratory samples, high

161

viral loads were found as early as the first day after illness onset (d.a.o), and

162

decreased as the disease progression. Most of patients became negative in respiratory

163

samples within 18 d.a.o, and viral RNAs were re-detectable in two patients at 26, 28

164

and 33 d.a.o. A total of 17 patients were tested positive in the fecal samples. Viral

165

RNA was also detected as early as the first d.a.o, while viral loads were relatively

166

stable during the disease progression. Viral RNAs were still detectable during 36~42

167

d.a.o.

Discussion

170

Similar with previous study [7], only 37.14% of the children patients showed fever,

171

while cough was most frequent symptoms with a rate of 48.57% (Table 1). A previous

172

study showed that some children COVID-19 cases might display no symptoms or

173

radiologic features of pneumonia, and some might have radiologic features of

174

pneumonia but did not have any symptoms of infection [7]. Notably, 40% of the

175

children cases in our study showed asymptomatic infection before admission (Table

176

1), however, CT scan of these children showed radiologic features of pneumonia

177

(Table 2). In contrast, 3 of the symptomatic patients showed no radiologic features of

178

pneumonia. All the asymptomatic children cases did the virological tests for

179

investigation, as almost all the patients’ family possessed at least one family member

180

of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patient. Family cluster of COVID-19 patients

181

were frequently found [10, 20, 21], suggesting that it was easy to transmit among

182

family members, and transmission from family members might serve as the main

183

cause of infection for children. Asymptomatic adult patients were also found with

184

lower rate [4-6], and these patients were also shown to be possible source of infection

185

[22-25]. These asymptomatic patients posed a great threat to the control and

186

prevention of COVID-19, as they were hard to be found unless family members

187

developed symptoms and laboratory confirmed, which is of great concern during the

188

control of COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, there were no statistical differences in

189

epidemiological information, CT scan, blood biochemical and complete blood count

190

between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (Table 1 and 2), except a higher

191

level of CRP was found in symptomatic patients, which might contribute to the fever

192

of the symptomatic infection.

193

Studies based on the adult COVID-19 patients have showed that viral shedding

194

of SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory and fecal samples appeared as early as the first two

195

days from illness onset (d.a.o), peaked during 3-5 d.a.o, decreased during diseases

196

progression, and persisted up to 37 d.a.o [12, 13]. Similar with adult patients, viral

197

RNAs could be detected in both the respiratory and fecal samples from children

198

patients, and lasted up to 33 and 41 d.a.o, respectively (Figure 2). Unlike adult

199

patients, viral loads in respiratory samples from children seemed to peaked in the very

200

early stage of disease, usually the first d.a.o, and maintained a middle level during 2-7

201

d.a.o, then gradually decreased to negative. This observation indicated that viral

202

shedding in children patients might also peak on or before illness onset [13]. Of note,

203

a total of 17 patients (48.57%) were tested positive in the fecal samples, despite that

204

only one patient experienced gastrointestinal symptom. Meanwhile, SARS-CoV-2

205

shedding in stool is much longer and stable than that in respiratory specimens in

206

children COVID-19 patients (Figure 2). These results highlighted the importance of

207

detecting viral RNAs in fecal samples of children COVID-19 patients. Recently, live

208

virus was successfully isolated from stool [26], and also we isolated the live virus

209

from the rectal swab of a children patient (data not shown), indicating live virus

210

existed in fecal samples. The longer duration of viral shedding in the fecal samples

211

than the respiratory tract (41 vs 33) and the expression of angiotensin-converting

212

enzyme-2 (ACE2) in intestine enterocytes [27, 28], also highlighted the possibility of

213

SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in the gastrointestinal tract.

214

Disease severity varied a lot following SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults, from

215

severe ARDS to asymptomatic infections [4-6]. Studies have found that most of the

216

children patients infected with influenza viruses including H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6

217

avian influenza viruses (AIVs), as well as coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and

218

MERS-CoV showed asymptomatic and mild symptoms [29-34]. In our study, all the

219

included children cases were moderate and mild cases according to the China

220

National Health Commission Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of

221

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies have suggested that lymphopenia may associate with

222

disease severity of COVID-19, as 80% of critically ill adult COVID-19 patients

223

experienced lymphopenia, far higher than the adult patients with mild COVID-19

224

(25%) [5, 6, 35, 36]. Notably, in our study and some other previous report, only a very

225

small portion of children patients experienced lymphopenia [7], which might result

226

from the relatively immature immune system and different immune response

227

compared with adults [37, 38]. This was different from children patients of

228

SARS-CoV infection, which was reported to induce a high portion of lymphopenia up

229

to 46% [34, 37], indicating a different immune response for the two viruses [37].

230

Another notification is that CD4 and CD8 were normal in children COVID-19

231

patients (Table 2). However, our previous study has shown that CD4 and CD8 counts

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.25.20181446; this version posted August 31, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

232

were significantly lower in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients [18], which

233

indicated that the normal CD4 and CD8 counts might also contribute to the mild

234

COVID-19 in children, as CD4 and CD8 cells has been proved to play vital roles in

235

immune responses, including immune regulation, cytokines secretion, virus-specific

236

antibody production and cytolytic activities against target cells [39].

237

Previous studies have shown that cytokine storm was highly correlated with

238

disease severity and progression [17, 18], and secretion of pro-inflammatory and

239

anti-inflammatory cytokines were found different among different ages of people [38].

240

So the expression profile of cytokines in children COVID-19 patients upon admission

241

was also analyzed in this study. Similar with adult patients [16-18], elevated

242

concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were observed, despite

243

that adult healthy control was used, indicating that cytokine storm also occurred in

244

children following SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the number of elevated

245

cytokines was far smaller than the adult patients [17, 18]. Furthermore, cytokines

246

which were shown to be highly correlated with disease severity and progression were

247

significantly lower than adult patients, including IP-10, MCP-3, HGF, MIP-1α, and

248

IL-1ra [17, 18]. These results indicated that much weaker cytokine storm happened in

249

children patients, which might also associate with the milder disease in children.

251

Conclusions

252

COVID-19 in children was mild, and asymptomatic infection was common. Immune

253

responses were relatively normal in children COVID-19 patients. Cytokine storm also

254

occurred in children COVID-19 patients, while much weaker than adult patients.

255

Positive rate of viral RNAs in fecal samples was high, and profile of viral shedding

256

were different between respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. To our knowledge, this is

257

the first report on the profile of viral shedding and cytokine expression in children

258

COVID-19 patients, which might provide important information for the

259

understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in children.

adult COVID-19 patients and the healthy volunteers. Samples from children

425

(N=11) and adult (N=50) COVID-19 cases were collected at the earliest possible

426

time-point after hospitalization and measured the concentrations of 48 cytokines, and

427

8 adult healthy subjects were included as control. Values were graphed on a

428

logarithmic scale and presented in units of pg/mL. P values between 0.01-0.05,
