ABSTRACT
Objectives: This study aimed to analyse the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of
critical COVID-19 cases and investigate risk factors including comorbidities and age in
relation with the clinical aftermath of COVID-19 in critical cases in Bangladesh.
Methods: In this retrospective study, epidemiological and clinical characteristics,
complications, laboratory results, and clinical management of the patients were studied from
data obtained from 168 individuals diagnosed with an advanced prognosis of COVID-19
admitted in two hospitals in Bangladesh.
Results: Individuals in the study sample contracted COVID-19 through community
transmission. 56.5% (n = 95) cases died in intensive care units (ICU) during the study period.
The median age was 56 years and 79.2% (n=134) were male. Typical clinical manifestation
included Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related complications (79.2%), fever
(54.2%) and cough (25.6%) while diabetes mellitus (52.4%), hypertension (41.1%) and heart
diseases (16.7%) were the conventional comorbidities. Clinical outcomes were detrimental
due to comorbidities rather than age and comorbid individuals over 50 were at more risk. In
the sample, oxygen saturation was low (< 95% SpO2) in 135 patients (80.4%) and 158
(93.4%) patients received supplemental oxygen. Identical biochemical parameters were found
in both deceased and surviving cases. Administration of antiviral drug Remdesivir and the
glucocorticoid, Dexamethasone increased the proportion of surviving patients slightly.
Conclusions: Susceptibility to developing critical illness due to COVID-19 was found more
in comorbid males. These atypical patients require more clinical attention from the prospect
of controlling mortality rate in Bangladesh.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Coronavirus Disease 2019, came into limelight in early December 2019, when some
cases of pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, whose causes were unfamiliar.
Following laboratory assessment, it was announced that these innominate cases of pneumonia
were caused by a novel strain of virus belonging to the Coronavirus family and was labelled
SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) [1]. The spread of the
infection is a rising, rapidly advancing circumstance and due to this whirlwind rate of spread,
COVID-19 has been pronounced as a global pandemic by the WHO since March 11, 2020.
As of 23rd September, more than 31.7 million positive cases of COVID-19 have been
reported in 217 countries and territories with more than 975,315 deaths. COVID-19 targets
the respiratory tract of humans and has similar clinical symptoms to SARS-CoV and MERSCoV [2-4]. Typical symptoms experienced by COVID-19 positive individuals include fever,
dry cough, fatigue, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea, shortness of breath, myalgia, acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related symptoms and shock [5-8]. Previous studies
reported that the patients who need intensive care tend to be older in age and male, and about
40% have comorbid conditions, including diabetes, cardiac diseases, hypertension, asthma
and other chronic illnesses such as liver or kidney disease [9, 10]. According to the World
Health Organization, about 5% COVID-19 patients, who are severe or critically ill require
admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) [11]. However, shortages of standard healthcare
resources, especially ICU supports are causing the high mortality rate of critically ill patients.
The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed an enormous burden and massive challenges to the
health care system, especially ICUs, across developed, developing and underdeveloped
countries. Likewise, Bangladesh also falls in the category of unfortified countries due to its
high population and poor health care system [12]. A total of 7% of the county’s population
are senior citizens [13]. Most of these senior citizens, as well as middle-aged people in the
county, have comorbidities, such as diabetes (9.7%), asthma (5.2%), hypertension (20%),
cardiac disease (4.5%) and chronic pulmonary disease (11.9%), and around 1.3 to 1.5 million
cancer patients in the country are vulnerable to COVID-19 [14-17]. All of these people, who
belong to a vulnerable group, may require immediate hospitalisation and intensive care if
they contract COVID-19 [10]. Compared to the eight worst affected countries, Bangladesh
has the lowest number of COVID-19 ICU beds per 10,000 inhabitants (Supplementary Figure
1). How the health management system with its poor and limited resources is responding to
and tackling critical COVID-19 patients is a matter of inordinate concern. Therefore, it is

important for health and government authorities to have information on the clinical features
and outcomes of COVID-19 in critically ill cases for them to address the necessities of ICU
facilities’ and prepare for a possible second wave of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. Therefore,
this study aims to investigate the epidemiological and clinical features, disease severity,
treatment and clinical outcomes of critical COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh with the goal of
portraying a bigger picture of severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 so that the
malleability Bangladesh’s health care system can be modified in terms of tackling COVID19.

2 METHODS
2.1 PATIENTS AND DATA COLLECTION
This sample of this study comprises 168 COVID-19 patients with definite outcomes who
were admitted to

Chittagong General Hospital and Chittagong Medical College Hospital

(COVID-19 unit) between 1st April 2020 and 7th August 2020. The Chittagong General
Hospital and Chittagong Medical College Hospital (COVID-19 unit) are specialised hospitals
that have been authorised for managing most of the critical COVID-19 patients in the
country’s economic hub, namely Chattogram city. The epidemiological and demographic
data for this study were obtained from the inpatients’ files. This study was approved by the
IRB of the Chattogram General Hospital Ethics Committee and the patients gave oral consent
regarding data collection and usage.

2.2 THE CRITERIA FOR ICU ADMISSION
Based on clinical symptoms, patients were divided into mild, moderate, severe and critical
groups. Most of the severe or critical patients and few moderate ill patients were admitted to
the ICU. Those in the severe group have respiratory distress, i.e. a respiratory rate of ≥ 30
beats per minute in a resting state and an oxygen saturation of ≤ 92% SpO2, and those in the
critical group experience respiratory failure, Sepsis and shock, thus requiring mechanical
ventilation, as well as the combined failure of other organs, which require ICU monitoring
and treatment. The coordinative physicians were accountable for collecting this data from the
patients. ARDS was defined according to the Berlin definition [18], and shock was defined
according to the Sepsis-3 criteria [19].

2.3 REAL-TIME RT-PCR ASSAY FOR COVID-19
Whether the cases of the sample were positive with COVID-19 was confirmed via a real-time
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of respiratory tract samples.
Throat swabs were collected and maintained in the viral transport medium. The laboratory
test assays for COVID-19 were conducted according to standards set by the World Health
Organisation’s (WHO). Upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were collected in order
to extract SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The RNA was obtained and further tested by means of RTPCR using the same method that was described previously [20].

2.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND PLOTTING
Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to express categorical variables with numbers
and proportions. These were then compared using a chi-square test. P values of less than or
equal to 0.05 (two-sided) were considered statistically significant. R-script and GraphPad
Prism version 7.04 was used to perform all of the statistical analyses and the figure plotting.
Patients with at least one type of comorbidity were considered comorbid, and those with no
comorbidity were considered non-comorbid patients.

3 RESULTS
3.1 EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FEATURES
Among the 168 COVID-19 patients admitted in the ICU with a confirmed outcome, 95
(56.5%) of the severely ill patients died in the ICU and the remaining 73 patients (43.5%)
were transferred to the isolation ward following improvement (Table 1). Although 66.7% of
the patients were over 50 years old, the highest proportion (28.6%) was between 51 and 60
years old. The proportion of male patients (79.8%) was more than female patients (20.2%).
The COVID-19 individuals were into diverse professions and while the 10 (6.0%) of the
patients had direct involvement in the healthcare system, most of the patients were from
urban areas (65.5%). Persistence of a comorbidity was directly proportional to the state of
being admitted in the ICU. As shown in Figure 1A, the proportion of deceased patients was
relatively low in the group without comorbidities. Interestingly, the patients who were over
50 years old and had comorbidities comprise 66.3% of the total deaths, with the number of
deaths being seven times the number of deaths in the group without comorbidities (Figure
1B).

About 82.1% (138/168) of patients had at least one coexisting chronic illness,

predominantly diabetes (52.4%), hypertension (41.1%) or heart disease (16.7%) (Table 1).
The prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and heart disease in deceased patients was slightly
higher (Figure 1C). Interestingly, patients with asthma survived well compared to other
comorbidities. The most common symptoms experienced by patients were ARDS (133/168;
79.2%), fever (91/168; 54.2%) and coughing (43/168; 25.6%) (Figure 1D). The median
length of hospital stay was five days, and the median length of ICU stay was four days
(Figure 1E). The average duration of stay in the ICU was higher in surviving patients. In
surviving patients, the median length of hospital stay was eleven days, and the median length
of ICU stay was six days (Figure 1F). The leading causes of death were cardio respiratory
failure (73/95; 76.8%), diabetes mellitus related complications (30/95; 31.6%), ARDS (20/95;
21.0%), pneumonia (20/95; 21.0%) and heart disease (7/95; 7.4%) (Figure 1G).

respiratory distress syndrome; ICU: intensive care unit

3.2 VITAL SIGNS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The body temperatures for all individuals in the study sample were measured, and this ranged
from 98°F to 102+°F. The vital signs at admission to the ICU were moderate fever ≥ 99°F for
40 patients (71.1%), heart rate ≥ 100 beats per minute for 85 patients (51%) and a respiratory
rate of ≥ 25 breaths per minute in 56% of the recorded patients. The patients who had a
moderate or high fever (≥ 99°F) tended to have a higher mortality rate than those with a mild
or no fever (Figure 2A). Oxygen saturation was low (< 95% SpO2) in 135 patients (80.4%)
and the mortality rate of these patients was relatively high (Figure 2B). The death rate of
patients who had an abnormal heart rate and respiratory rate was higher (Figure 2C). Shock
occurred in 10 patients (5.9%), including cardiogenic shock in five patients (2.9%) and septic
shock in four patients (2.4%) (Figure 2D). Of all 168 ICU patients, seven (4.2%) were
classified as having a hypertensive crisis. Unfortunately, none of these patients survived.
ARDS occurred in 167 (99.4%) patients, with 31 patients (18.5%) having moderate ARDS,
three patients (1.8%) having mild ARDS and 133 patients (79%) experiencing severe ARDS.
Eighty three out of the 133 severe ARDS patients (62.4%) died (Figure 2E).

3.3 LABORATORY FINDINGS
The laboratory findings of the patients upon admission to the ICU are shown in Figure 2 and
Table 3. Statistical analysis was only conducted on the patients whose laboratory results were
available. Elevated levels of White Blood Cell (WBC) and Neutrophils were identified in
68.9% (42/61), and 66.7% (44/64) patients, respectively. For 71 patients who underwent
tests on D-dimer, an excessive level was identified from 49 (69.0%) patients, with the level
higher than 5 mg/L in 15 (21.1%) patients. Out of the 69 patients who had tests of Ferritin,

elevated levels of Ferritin were identified in 53 (76.8%) patients (Table 3). The biochemical
parameters of the survived and non-survived patients were also compared, and it was found
that they were essentially identical (Figure 2F).

3.4 MANAGEMENT AND MEDICATIONS
Oxygen therapy was administered in accordance with the patients’ oxygen saturation. Over
90% of the patients who were admitted to the ICU (158/168; 93.6%) required oxygen during
the course of the disease. Of the 158 patients with available information, 64.8% (103/159)
received oxygen support via a mask, and 25.2% (40/159) received oxygen support via a high
flow nasal cannula. Prone positioning was implemented to enhance oxygenation and improve
lung recruitability in some patients with severe ARDS (151/168; 89.9%) (Table 4).
Convalescent plasma (CP) was transfused into eight patients. However, only three of these
eight patients survived after the convalescent plasma transfusion. As for the medications
administered, 94 patients (56.0%) received antiviral agents, 164 patients (97.6%) received
antimicrobial agents, 126 patients (75.0%) received an anti-allergic drug, 149 patients
(88.7%) received anti-inflammatory drugs and 145 patients (86.3%) received vitamin and
mineral supplements. Favipiravir (71/168; 42.3%) and Remdesivir (31/168; 18.4%) were the
most commonly used antiviral drugs among the ICU patients. However, the proportion of
surviving patients was greater in the Remdesivir cohort than the Favipiravir cohort (Figure
3A). Additionally, Methylprednisolone (97/168; 57.7%) and Dexamethasone (40/168; 23.8%)
were the two most used glucocorticoids (Figure 3A). Meropenem (126/168; 76.2%) was the
most commonly used antibiotic, followed by Ceftriaxone (50/168; 29.8%), Azithromycin
(33/168; 19.4%) and Moxifloxacin (33/168; 19.4%) (Figure 3A). As shown in Figure 3B, the
proportion of survived patients was slightly higher with the use of Meropenem, as well as
Remdesivir and Dexamethasone, than with the use of Favipiravir or Methylprednisolone. Six
patients were treated with Remdesivir and Dexamethasone and only one of them died. The
vitamin C, vitamin D and zinc supplements that were commonly used did not show any
improved clinical outcomes (Figure 3C).

4 DISCUSSION
On 22nd September 2020, COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh totalled to 352,178, with 260,790
recovered cases and 5007 deaths. The information on the clinical characteristics of COVID19 individuals having an advanced and deleterious prognosis of COVID-19 is still scarce
although the positive cases are nowhere near decreasing. The median age of the critical
COVID-19 patients of the sample in this study (56 years) is lower than that of Italy, the
United States of America (USA), Greece and China [21-24]. However, the gender propensity
of this study’s patients (mostly men) is consistent with that of COVID-19 patients in ICUs in
Italy, USA and China [21-23]. The management of patients with several comorbidities is
challenging due to their frailty and increased risk of mortality, which is amplified when these
comorbid individuals are diagnosed with COVID-19. The current study has found that older
(≥ 50) Bangladeshi male patients with previous comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension
and heart diseases, are profoundly susceptible to COVID-19, which is comparative to the
pattern that has been revealed in China, Italy and New York [8, 21, 23, 25]. In Bangladesh,
most people diagnosed with diabetes are from urban areas, and the prevalence of diabetes is
highest among those aged from 55 to 59 years [26]. The presence of comorbidity might
explain COVID-19’s severity in Bangladeshi patients aged 51 to 60 years.
Another diverting finding from this study was that patients with asthma survived well
compared to other comorbidities. As with other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 triggers asthma
exacerbations, which is why asthma is listed as a risk factor for COVID-19 related morbidity.
However, this study’s finding is consistent with that of Leonardo Antonicelli et al. (2020),
who found that asthma seems to play a minimal role in clinical severity [27]. ARDS (79.2%)
was found to be the most prominent symptom within the study sample upon admission to the
ICU, and this was also reflected in patients described in reports from China, USA and Europe
[8, 21, 22]. Other noteworthy symptoms are fever (8.40%) and coughing (7.70%), and the

results obtained by this study align with the trends concerning high prevalence seen in other
countries [21-23]. Intestinal signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, were rarely developed by
the patients in this study. The vast majority of this study’s patients needed oxygen support
upon admission to the ICU due to severe to moderate ARDS as indicated by their extremely
low oxygen saturations. This study finds that there is a high mortality rate among patients
with a moderate to high fever and a low oxygen saturation.
Therapeutic plasma exchange has been recommended as a treatment measure for patients
with severe COVID-19; however, this study found that therapeutic plasma exchange had no
significant impact on the improvement of critically ill patients. According to a recent study,
therapeutic plasma exchange can be effective in critically ill patients if it can be applied
within the first week of symptom onset [28]. Unfortunately, most of the patients in the
current study were admitted to the ICU in a critical condition due to the lack of available ICU
beds. Therefore, it may have been too late for convalescent plasma therapy to have an
effective impact.
To the extent of the author’s knowledge, so far, this study is the only study on the medicine
administered to critically ill COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh. Currently, there is no
recommended treatment for COVID-19 infection in careful supportive care [29]. In this
study, 97.6% of patients received antibacterial agents, 56% received antiviral therapy and
88.7% received anti-inflammatory drugs. Even though the antiviral drug Favipiravir was the
mostly used antiviral drug, the survival rate was higher among the patients who had been
given Remdesivir. Favipiravir concentrations become lower in critically ill patients than in
healthy subjects, which might be one reason why Favipiravir is less effective [30]. Several
countries, such as Japan, Taiwan and USA, and the European Union (EU) suggest the
conditional use of Remdesivir to treat critical patients [31, 32]. Therefore, Remdesivir can be
a better choice over Favipiravir in providing aid to COVID-19 individuals.
A recent report suggests that glucocorticoids may also minimize severe clinical outcomes in
critical COVID-19 patients with ARDS [33]. The current study finds that Dexamethasone has
comparatively better clinical outcomes than Methylprednisolone. According to a large
clinical trial conducted in the United Kingdom (UK), Dexamethasone reduced deaths by
about one-third in critical COVID-19 patients who were on ventilator support [34]. In this
study, only one out of six patients who were treated with both Remdesivir and

Dexamethasone died. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are required to
evaluate the effectiveness of the combined use of Remdesivir and Dexamethasone.
Although the findings of this study were significant, limitations were also in order. Firstly,
laboratory data collection to conduct a broad and extensive study was inevitably challenging
as the laboratory results were not systematically collected. Secondly, the evaluated data was
extracted retrospectively from patients’ medical files and not all laboratory tests were
conducted on all patients. Thirdly, because of the study’s objective to identify the critical care
needs of patients with the greatest severity of illness, the sample size is small. Therefore,
more thorough assessment of comorbidities in larger samples of critical Bangladeshi patients
with COVID-19 and future studies are required. Despite these limitations, this study
represented the largest cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients from Bangladesh reported to
date.

5 CONCLUSION
To summarize, parallel to the data obtained from studies conducted in other countries, there is
an elevated prevalence of comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases, in
a profuse number COVID-19 patients with critical expositions who are hospitalised in
Bangladesh. Since this cohort is more vulnerable in terms of COVID-19 related morbidity
and mortality, besides implementing an effective policy for the prevention and control of the
disease in general, the authorities should pay more attention to these atypical patients. In
conclusion, the findings reported here provide important context for effective strategies for
the provision of comprehensive health care to critically ill COVID-19 patients. However,
future studies with larger sample sizes are needed in order to assess the risk factors and
associated clinical outcomes in a broader sense.
