ABSTRACT
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has evolved far more aggressively in countries lacking a
robust testing strategy to identify infected individuals. Given the global demand for fast
and reliable diagnosis to determine the carrier individuals, a stock-out scenario for a
number of essential reagents/kits used along the diagnostic process has been foreseen
by many organizations. Having identified the RNA extraction step as one of the key
bottlenecks, we tested several alternatives that avoid the use of commercial kits for this
step. The analysis showed that 2-propanol precipitation of the viral RNA, followed by
one-step RT-qPCR results in a sensitivity and specificity comparable to that provided
currently by automatized systems such as the COBAS 6800 system. Therefore, this
simple protocol allows SARS-CoV-2 testing independently of commercial kit providers in
a time and cost-effective manner. It can be readily implemented in research and/or
diagnostic laboratories worldwide, provided that patient confidentiality and researcher
safety are ensured. Scaling up the testing capabilities of hospitals and research facilities
will identify larger numbers of infected individuals to paint a clear picture of the COVID19 prevalence, a pre-requisite for informed policy decision making.

INTRODUCTION
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative
agent of the Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been declared
a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Data suggest that
mortality appear to range between 0.5-8% depending on the availability of diagnostic
testing and the capacity of the healthcare system (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-02000186-0). SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as an extremely contagious virus. Transmission
can occur through direct contact, droplet spray at short ranges, and by airborne transmission events at long-range distances by aerosol particles (https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-virology-012420-022445).

Given the ability of the virus to transmit without direct person-to-person contact and the
existence of asymptomatic (https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2607.200718), early release
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5),

or

presymptomatic

(http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6914e1) transmission events, control of SARSCoV-2 spread poses serious challenges to healthcare systems. In response, on March
22nd 2020, the WHO has recommended that all countries increase the number of tests
carried out and has recognized that in order to overcome the shortages of testing
reagents for diagnosis, new laboratory testing strategies must be developed
(https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/331509). Thus, extensive testing is one of the key
anti-pandemic measures.

The gold-standard detection tools for SARS-CoV-2 rely on the detection of viral RNA by
reverse transcription followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
Currently, most healthcare systems use highly automatized detection methods such as
the COBAS 6800 system (Hoffmann-La Roche). These systems allow the processing of
a large number of samples with a smaller workforce than manual protocols but rely on
several reagents and kits, which are in a permanent danger of limited availability and
even stock-out due to their increasing demand following the fast, global spread of SARSCoV-2. As a response, and following WHO recommendations, alternative diagnostic
protocols that do not rely on the use of kits suffering global shortages must be designed.
RNA extraction has been identified as one of the key bottlenecks in the application of
massive testing strategies due to the shortage of diagnostic kits. As a response, in this
study several kit-free strategies for RNA extraction have been tested. Our analysis shows
that RNA precipitation with 2-propanol followed by one-step RT-qPCR detection of
SARS-CoV-2 using a combination of hydrolysis probes and intercalating dye
technologies provides a complete and robust diagnostic protocol that could be scaled up

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ethical statement
The study was conducted at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU, Leioa,
Spain) in collaboration with the Cruces University Hospital after approval by the
UPV/EHU Ethics Committee (project 2020/059, CEIAB M30/2020/074).

Biological samples
Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples collected in UTM (Universal Transport Medium)
were diagnosed for SARS-CoV2 at the Microbiology Service of Cruces University
Hospital (HUC, Barakaldo, Spain), which is part of the Basque Health system
(Osakidetza). Before transport to our laboratories, all samples were anonymized using
an alphanumeric code and inactivated with lysis buffer (COBAS omni lysis buffer, Ref.
06997538190; 1:1 in UTM), and then registered and transported by the Basque BioBank.
For the initial set up of the protocol (Set #1), we received 60 NPS samples (30 positives
and 30 negatives). In a second stage of blind validation, we used 105 additional NPS
samples (Set #2), unaware of the diagnosis assessment made by HUC.

Total RNA purification/extraction
Five RNA extraction methods were compared to ensure an enriched high RNA
quantity/quality sample in the shortest time minimizing the exposure to toxic reagents

(260/280 ratio) was determined by UV spectrophotometry on a NanoDrop ND-1000.

Detailed protocols are explained bellow:
(A) DNAse treatment: An aliquot of 100 μl of inactivated sample was centrifuged for 5
min at 12,000 g. The supernatant was collected in a new 1.5 ml tube and was treated
with 2 U of DNAse I (ThermoFisher) for 30 min at 37 °C following the manufacturer´s
instructions.
(B) 2-propanol precipitation: An aliquot of 100 μl of inactivated sample was centrifuged
and the supernatant collected as described in A. Then, the same volume (1:1) of precold (-20 ºC) 2-propanol (PanReac, Barcelona, Spain) was added, mixed by inversion
and incubated for 10 min on ice. Afterwards, the sample was centrifuged for 10 min at
12,000 g and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed in 500 μl of pre-

cold (-20 ºC) ethanol 75% (PanReac) and centrifuged for 5 min at 7,500 g. Finally, the
pellet was air-dried for 10-20 min and resuspended in 40 μl of RNAse-free molecular
grade water (PanReac).
(C) 2-propanol precipitation after DNase I treatment: This method corresponds to a
combination of methods A and B. Thus, DNAse-treated samples as in A were further
precipitated with 2-propanol as described in B.
(D) Extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol: An aliquot of 100 μl of inactivated
samples was heated at 70 °C for 5 min and treated with 2 U of DNAse I for 30 min at 37
°C. Then, 50 μl of phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol (25:24:1) (PanReac) were added
and the mixture centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 g. The aqueous upper layer was
carefully recovered without disturbing the interphase and transferred to a new 1.5 ml
tube. Finally, the samples were precipitated following the 2-propanol method described
above.
(E) Phenol-based extraction with Trizol reagent: 900 μl of Trizol were added to an aliquot
of 100 μl of inactivated sample and incubated 5 min at room temperature (RT). Then,
200 μl of chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich) were added, incubated for 3 min at RT, and
centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min. The obtained aqueous layer was collected and
transferred to a new 1.5 ml tube. Finally, the same volume of 2-propanol was added to
continue with 2-propanol precipitation steps.

nucleocapsid protein; probes N1, N2 and N3) and the human gene for the subunit 30 of
the RNAseP (RPP30), used to control for biological sample collection and nucleic acid
extraction procedures. While the N1 and N2 probe sets were specific for SARS-CoV-2,
the N3 probe set detected other coronaviruses, and was subsequently removed from the
diagnostic panel by the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcrpanel-primer-probes.html; Table 1). As a negative control, RNA extracted from noninfected HeLa cells was included (30 ng/well). As a positive control, the commercial
control plasmid 2019-nCoV_N_Positive Control (Ref. 10006625, IDT, Leuven, Belgium)
was used. A non-template control (H2O) was also included. All samples and controls
were run in duplicate.

SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR with an intercalating green dye
As an alternative SARS-CoV2 detection method for samples assigned as indeterminate,
as defined below in the Quality Control and Data Analysis section, a method based on a
intercalating green dye for detection of double-stranded DNA by RT-qPCR was used
(NZYSpeedy One-step RT-qPCR Green Kit, NZYTech). We used three sets of primers
previously described by Won et al. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32156101),
that targeted viral genes: N, encoding for the nucleocapsid, S for the spike, and RdRP
for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Table 1). The primers for the E gene, which
encodes for the envelope, were discarded because of their low specificity and
hybridization

based

BLAST

(https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Primers for the human gene RNAseP subunit
30 (RPP30) were used as a control for biological sample collection and nucleic acid
extraction. The reactions were run in duplicate in 384-well plates using 2 µl of RNA in a
final reaction volume of 10 µl (QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System;ThermoFisher,
Waltham, MA, USA). The PCR program was 20 min at 50 ºC for RNA reverse
transcription; 3 min at 95 ºC for polymerase activation and 40 cycles of amplification (95
ºC 5 sec, 60 ºC 50 sec), where 60 ºC is the optimal annealing temperature for these
primers. In addition, the analysis of the melting temperature curve (70-95 ºC, in 0.2oC
increments, 10 sec per step) was added at the end of the reaction as a control of
amplification specificity. The negative and positive controls used for probe experiments
were also included as controls for this assay.

Quality Control (QC) and Data Analysis
1. Probe methodology
An initial QC was performed before samples were analyzed for the presence of SARSCoV-2 RNA. Non-template controls were required to be strictly negative for all assays,
while the negative control (non-infected HeLa cells) had to be positive for the human
RPP30 gene (threshold cycle or Ct<35). Regarding the positive controls, the three serial
dilutions of the standard curve had to be positive for both N1 and N2 viral probes and
negative for the human RPP30 endogenous control.

In anticipation of possible scenarios where scale up of analyses might be necessary, a
semi-automated worksheet template that can estimate viral copy number and determine

sample positivity according to the criteria outlined in Table 2 was prepared
(Supplementary File 1). In this script, raw experimental results are pasted into the
template, standard curves for N1 and N2 are constructed from the positive control
dilutions and the copy content of each viral gene is calculated for each clinical sample.
Samples were considered positive for SARS-CoV-2 when N1 and/or N2 amplification
could be detected and more than 4 copies per reaction were detected. In turn, samples
were considered negative when neither N1 nor N2 amplification was detected. Finally,
samples in which the amplification of RPP30 was below the QC threshold (Ct>35), or
showing non-concordant results between technical replicates, or presenting estimates of
viral content below 4 copies (but Ct<40) were considered indeterminate for the presence
of SARS-CoV-2 and their analysis was repeated with the intercalating green dye method.

Alongside the quantitative assignment of clinical samples into the positive, negative or
indeterminate categories, an additional QC procedure was performed. The qPCR
amplification curves for each sample were plotted from the relative fluorescence units
(RFU) detected in each cycle, using an in-house R script (Supplementary File 2). The
amplification curve of each indeterminate sample was examined and compared to
positive and negative samples. Samples showing amplification curves that did not fit a
sigmoidal function were considered negative for SARS-CoV-2 and were not repeated
with the intercalating green dye experiment (Supplementary Figure 1).

2. Intercalating green dye methodology
In order to pass the initial QC, the non-template controls had to be strictly negative for
all assays, while the negative control (non-infected HeLa cells) had to be positive only
for the human RPP30 gene (Ct<35). Regarding the positive control, all dilutions included
in the standard curve had to show amplification for the N viral gene. Finally, all clinical
samples had to display RPP30 amplification with a Ct lower than 35, to ensure the quality
of the sample and the nucleic acid extraction.

Following the criteria outlined in Table 2, samples were considered positive for SARSCoV-2 when at least two of the three viral genes (N, S and/or RdRP) showed positive
amplification (Ct<40) and negative when none of the viral genes amplified. Samples
showing amplification of the RPP30 endogenous control after the QC threshold (Ct>35),
or showing non-concordant results between technical replicates, were considered
indeterminate for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and the need of a new sample collection
will be informed.

As an additional QC step, melting curve analysis of qPCR products was performed and
wells with non-specific amplification products were eliminated from the assignment. The
amplification curves of indeterminate samples were examined as described and those
not fitting a sigmoidal function were considered negative for SARS-CoV-2.

Statistical analysis
The results obtained with the test developed by the coBIG were compared with the
results obtained by Osakidetza (considered herein as true positives and true negatives).
Statistical analysis was performed using the DAG_Stat Excel file developed by
Mackinnon (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10758228). We calculated sensitivity
(proportion of coBIG concordants positive over all Osakidetza positives samples),
specificity (proportion of coBIG concordants negative over all Osakidetza negatives
samples), and accuracy (as sum of concordant positives and negatives correctly
identified by coBIG over total number of samples). Besides, we also determined the
predictive value of positive (precision) or negative test, defined as the proportion of

RESULTS
Determination of the optimal kit-free total RNA extraction procedure
We first compared five RNA extraction methods (Figure 1) in two pools of positive and
negative (5 samples each) NPSs from experimental Set #1. To select the most effective
method for RNA extraction, three factors were taken into account: the time consumed,
the RNA quantity/quality (Q/Q) ratio obtained (ratio 260/280 absorbance), and the usage
of non-phenolic reagents to avoid toxicity (Table 3).

From all the tested methods, direct precipitation of total nucleic acids (including RNA)
using 2-propanol without DNAse I treatment (method B), was selected as the most
appropriate as it was the second quickest (around 45 min), and showed good Q/Q values
in the Nanodrop (Table 3) without using phenolic reagents. DNAse treatment (method
A) was the fastest (around 40 min), but yielded little nucleic acids, as the Q/Q values of
the RNA obtained were undetermined by NanoDrop and did not result in significant
amplification of viral or human genes by RT-qPCR. Method C (a combination of A and
B) required around 80 min and the Q/Q values obtained did not significantly improve
those obtained with method B. Finally, phenol-based methods (methods D, E) showed
good Q/Q values but they were disregarded because of the longer time needed and the
toxicity of phenolic reagents used during the process.

and positive pool samples are indicated. In addition, the approximate time to process 24

Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 detection protocols
After selecting direct 2-propanol precipitation (method B) as the optimal kit-free RNA
extraction method we proceeded to compare SARS-CoV-2 by either one- or two-step
RT-qPCR, or by using intercalating green dye primers or hydrolysis probes (Figure 2,
3). For this purpose, we first compared the detection threshold for the N gene using 1:10
serial dilutions of the positive control CoV-N down to 10-5. We found that both
intercalating dye primers and hydrolysis probes had very similar amplification in the
detection range (40,000-4 copies per well) (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Standard calibration curve of hydrolysis probes and intercalating dye
primers. The amplification of the N gene was compared using the N1 hydrolysis probe
(blue) and the N set of primers for intercalating gene (orange) assay using dilutions
corresponding to 4-40,000 copies of N gene per PCR reaction. The determination
coefficient (R2) for the linear adjustment is indicated.

We then compared the detection of viral genes in some of the remaining NPS samples
from Set #1 (n=24; 12 positive and 12 negative samples) using intercalating green dye
primers and hydrolysis probes and found that both methods had a large degree of
concordance (23/24 samples, 96% concordance; Figure 3). No significant effects of
using one or two-step RT-qPCR reactions were found (data not shown). Finally, we used
the whole remaining samples of Set #1 (n=46) to define our analysis criteria (Table 2).
As the one-step RT-qPCR reaction lasted 1.5 h for hydrolysis probes and over 2 h for
intercalating dye primers, we decided to base our protocol on the two hydrolysis probes
for the N gene and to use the intercalating dye primers to double-check samples
classified as indetermined with the hydrolysis probes assay (Table 2), as they would
amplify three independent viral genes.

Validation of the SARS-CoV-2 detection SOP
To validate our established standard operating protocol (SOP), we used sample Set #2,
consisting of 105 already diagnosed and anonymized NPSs. To ensure a proper
validation strategy our researchers were unaware of the diagnosis assessment made by
Osakidetza. Therefore, RNA was extracted from the 105 NPS samples and SARS-CoV2 was first detected by RT-qPCR using the fluorescent hydrolysis probes method.
Following the criteria described in Table 2, the samples that did not fulfill the established
criteria for an unequivocal diagnostic were further analyzed by testing three different viral

genes (N, S and RdRP) using the intercalating dye RT-qPCR method. Overall, the
combination of both detection methods permitted to establish final diagnostic for 94 of
the 105 samples (89.5%) following the established diagnostic criteria, with 48 positives,
46 negatives and 11 indeterminate samples. We compared these results with the
diagnostic results from Osakidetza, who diagnosed 47 positives, 44 negatives and 14
indeterminates. Thus, the coBIG protocol detailed here results in 91% sensitivity with
90% specificity in SARS-CoV-2 detection (Table 4). The Cohen´s kappa index is
calculated as 0.81 indicating almost perfect agreement excluding chance.

DISCUSSION
In this manuscript, we have developed a method for in-house detection of SARS-CoV-2
based on 2-propanol precipitation of inactivated samples followed by one-step RT-qPCR
using the CDC hydrolysis probes N1 and N2, and subsequent confirmation of
indeterminate samples using intercalating dye primers for N, S and RdRP. We provide
evidence that this method provides a 90% specificity and 91% sensibility compared to
the diagnostic assessment made by the Basque Health Service, Osakidetza.

Massive SARS-CoV-2 testing is reclaimed by scientists worldwide to fight the current
pandemic (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00864-1). Without solid data
about the prevalence of the COVID-19, epidemiological models will be flawed
(https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01003-6), and the policies informed by
them will be ineffective at the very best, and utterly dangerous for our health and
economies at the worst. In fact, research labs worldwide are being repurposed to
increase

detection also provides an alternative method for diagnostic but its sensibility is unclear
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7144809/). Finally, serological methods
have produced a large stir across the globe with their promise of speed testing, but as of
April 8th, 2020, WHO recommends using these tests only for research purposes
(https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/advice-on-the-use-of-point-ofcare-immunodiagnostic-tests-for-covid-19), as their low sensitivity has been recalled
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0033350620301141).
Nonetheless, a combined genetic and serological screening is necessary to obtain a
complete picture of the pandemic evolution: genetic testing to determine infected people,
regardless of their symptoms; and serological testing to address immunity development
(https://www.jwatch.org/na51255/2020/03/31/serologic-tests-sars-cov-2-first-stepslong-road). In the meantime, RTqPCR remains the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2
testing.

The bottleneck for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR is the traditional RNA isolation
step (https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-extraction-kits-for-covid-19-testsare-in-short-supply-in-us-67250), and here we show that it can be bypassed by
performing direct 2-propanol precipitation. We have used NPSs, which has been the
most common type of sample to test infection in the upper respiratory tract, but efficient
detection in saliva is also documented (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41368-0200080-z). Viruses can also be detected by an even faster method by collecting the sample
with a dry swab and boiling it in lysis buffer in a closed tube, followed by direct one-step
RT-qPCR

using

the

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28827685). Nonetheless, this method needs
validation for SARS-CoV-2 testing and care should be exercised to ensure that the lysis
buffer does not interfere with the subsequent RT and PCR reactions.

Surveillance protocol (April 12th, 2020), uses Hoffman-La Roche proprietary probes to
detect E as a screening gene and S or RdRP as specific SARS-CoV-2 detection genes.
Importantly, we have observed a large agreement of results when comparing N1 and N2
CDC´s hydrolysis probes compared to N, S, and RdRP Won´s intercalating dye probes.
These results are very encouraging, as they suggest that different genotyping
approaches used by diagnostic and research labs worldwide are in fact comparable.

Another gene that is commonly used in RT-qPCR tests is the human RNAseP subunit
30 gene (RPP30). Importantly, both the CDC and Won´s probes to detect RPP30
hybridize genomic DNA, as they do not span exon-exon junctions. In our hands,
NanoDrop provided a good measurement of the quality of nucleic acids present in both

the Trizol and 2-propanol extraction methods. However, a more specific detection of RNA
using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer RNA integrity and quantity tests (RNA IQ assay, #Q33221;
and RNA HS assay, Q32852, respectively; Invitrogen) did not show any detectable RNA
in the range 250 pg/µl to 100 ng/µl (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that in the
conventional NPS preparation human RNA is largely absent or degraded, supporting the
use of human genomic DNA as a sample quality control.

In conclusion, the experiments that this multidisciplinary group of researchers from the
Basque Country have performed provides a simple, fast and inexpensive method to
detect with high specificity and sensitivity patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. The
obtained protocol shows that SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative cases can be detected
with precision after a simple step for precipitation of RNA, followed by one-step RT-qPCR
using the CDC hydrolysis probes N1 and N2.

Supplementary Figure 1. Amplification curve analysis of hydrolysis-probe RT-qPCR results. Red, green and blue lines represent samples (in duplicate) considered negative,
positive and indeterminate, respectively after the analysis with the worksheet template.
In (A), the blue sigmoidal curve suggests specific but late amplification of N1 in one of
the duplicates of this particular sample, and thus it should be re-analyzed with the intercalating dye method. In (B), although the blue line representing one of the replicates
surpasses the detection threshold of the RT-qPCR system, it does not fit a sigmoidal curve and therefore, the sample is considered negative, without the need of reanalysis. N2 does not amplify for any of the samples whereas RNAseP (RPP30) consistently amplifies before Ct 35.
