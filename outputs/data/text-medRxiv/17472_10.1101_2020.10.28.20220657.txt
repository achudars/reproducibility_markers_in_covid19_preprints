Abstract
Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has become a major public health issue worldwide.
Developing and evaluating rapid and easy-to-perform diagnostic tests is an
absolute priority. The current study was designed to assess diagnostic
performances of an antigen-based rapid detection test (COVID-VIRO®) in a
real-life setting.
Methods
Two nasopharyngeal specimens of symptomatic or asymptomatic adult patients
hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department or voluntarily accessing the
COVID-19 Screening Department of the Regional Hospital of Orléans, France,
were concurrently collected. COVID VIRO® diagnostic specificity and
sensitivity were assessed in comparison to real-time reverse transcriptase
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results. A subset of patients
underwent an additional oropharyngeal and/or a saliva swab for rapid testing.
Results
121 patients already having a confirmed infection and 127 patients having no
evidence of recent or ongoing infection were enrolled, for a total of 248 couple
of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Overall COVID-VIRO® sensitivity was
96.7% (IC: 93.5%-99.9%). In asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients
having symptoms for more than 4 days and those having a RT-qPCR Cycle
threshold value ≥32, sensitivity was of 100%, 95.8% and 91.9% respectively.

The concordance between RT-qPCR and COVID VIRO® rapid test was 100%
for the 127 patients with no SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Conclusion
COVID-VIRO® test had 100% specificity and above 95% sensitivity, better
than WHO recommendations (specificity ≥97-100%, sensitivity ≥80%). These
rapid tests are particularly interesting for large-scale screening in Emergency
Department, low resource settings and airports.

Introduction
At the end of 2019, a pneumonia of initially unknown origin was primarily
reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) Country Office in China. On
January 9th, 2020, the Chinese health authorities and the WHO announced the
discovery of a novel coronavirus, firstly named 2019-nCoV, then officially
SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2). This virus,
belonging to the coronavirus family but differing from SARS-CoV-1 and
MERSCoV, is responsible for upper/lower respiratory tract infections known as
COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 2019). COVID-19 incubation period is
approximately 5.2 days and the most common onset symptoms are fever, cough,
and fatigue (1). Since SARS-CoV-2 appeared in China, it has become a major
public health issue worldwide. To date, more than 40 million cases have been
detected worldwide (2) and the pandemic continues to spread unabated.
Minimizing testing delay seems to have the largest impact on reducing onward
transmissions (3), and the availability of highly sensitive and specific tests is
essential to quickly identify new cases and contain virus transmission.
Currently, the real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR) assay is the gold-standard method to detect SARS-CoV-2
RNA in respiratory specimens such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs
or broncho-alveolar lavage (4). However, performing RT-qPCR is expensive,
time consuming, and requires special equipment and qualified operators. Faster,
cheaper, and easier to use alternative tools could be represented by novels
antigen-based rapid detection tests or point of care tests (POCTs) (5).
Recently, the WHO approved the first rapid detection test for a large-scale use in
low- and middle-income countries (6), and French health regulation authorities
authorized their use in medical settings (7).

Several different POCTs have already been developed (8), with generally high
specificity but variable sensitivity (9-21).
COVID-VIRO® (AAZ, Boulogne Billancourt, France) is one of the novel
immunochromatographic tests designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen in
nasopharyngeal specimens within 15 minutes (22). Evaluating diagnostic
performances of COVID-VIRO® in the real life in comparison to the RT-qPCR
as reference test is the principal aim of the current study.

Materials and methods
Ethical approval
This study was approved by the Regional North West Ethics and Research
Committee. A written informed consent was obtained from each participant.
Study population
People voluntarily accessing the COVID-19 Screening Department as well as
subjects tested SARS-CoV-2 positive in the previous five days and SARS-CoV2 positive patients hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department of the
Centre Hospitalier Régional (CHR) of Orléans, France, or Drouot Laboratory,
Paris, France, from October 12th, 2020, to October 25th, 2020, were included in
the study. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in case of
positivity of the specific RT-qPCR on nasopharyngeal swab, in accordance with
current recommendations. Subjects recently tested SARS-CoV-2 positive at the
COVID-19 Screening Department were re-contacted and re-tested within five
days. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years old and agreement to undergo two
concurrent nasopharyngeal swabs for RT-qPCR and COVID-VIRO® analysis,
respectively. Patient age was collected at inclusion, as well as symptom onset
date for symptomatic patients. Suggestive symptoms were headache, fatigue,
fever, or upper or lower respiratory symptoms. Asymptomatic patients were
defined as those not reporting any of these symptoms.
Case definition
SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects were either patients having a positive RT-qPCR
at the time of inclusion if done in parallel with the rapid test, either patients

having a previous positive RT-qPCR within five days and a positive or negative
RT-qPCR at the time of study sampling.
SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects were patients having a negative RT-qPCR at the
time of inclusion without any previous positive test.
Specimen collection
Paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained for each patient by trained
healthcare personnel (nurses, doctors, or biologists). The collection of the two
simultaneous samples was always carried out by the same operator.
A polyester-tipped flexible (Viral transport medium tube with swab VTM, SunTrine®) was inserted into two of the nostrils until resistance was felt at the
nasopharynx, then rotated 6 times and withdrawn. After swabbing, the swab
applicator was cut off. The first absorbent swab was placed into a vial
containing 3 mL of inactivating viral transport media and was immediately
transferred to the Virology Unit of the CHR of Orléans hospital, Orléans, or
Drouot Laboratory, Paris, to perform RT-qPCR. The rapid antigen test was
immediately performed on-site with the second absorbent swab.
An additional oropharyngeal and/or saliva swab specimen was simultaneously
collected in a subset of positive patients in order to determine the diagnostic
reliability of these samples in comparison to nasopharyngeal swab specimens.
Oropharyngeal specimens were collected on both sides of the tonsillar arches
and posterior pharynx. Saliva specimens were collected by swabbing the upper
and lower gingiva twice from back to front.
Real-time RT-qPCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
Nucleic acid extraction was performed with automated Sample Preparation
System MGISP-960 (MGI, China). Specific real-time RT-qPCR assays target
three SARS-CoV-2 genes, namely ORF1ab, S and N genes (TaqPath Covid-19
Multiplex RT-PCR, Thermofisher). Genome amplification was performed using
QuantStudio5 (Applied Biosystems). Results interpretation was performed
according to manufacturer instructions. The assay includes an RNA internal
extraction control and amplification control. Samples showing an exponential
growth curve and a Cycle threshold (Ct) value < 37 were considered as positive.
A Ct unique value > 37 was considered as negative.

Rapid antigen test
COVID-VIRO® (AAZ, Boulogne Billancourt, France) is a membrane-based
immunochromatography assay detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (Nprotein) in nasopharyngeal samples through monoclonal antibodies. A second
monoclonal antibody is conjugate to colloidal gold particles which are captured
in reaction membrane. The test was performed according to manufacturer
instruction by mixing nasopharyngeal secretions with 300 µL of dilution buffer
in a tube. One minute, 4 drops were added in the appropriate well. When
nasopharyngeal secretions cross the strip, a passive diffusion allows the
solubilized conjugate to migrate with the sample and react with the anti-SARSCoV-2 antibodies immobilized on the membrane. A control line allows
assessing the correct migration of sample and the reliability of the test. Visual
interpretation of results is performed 15 minutes later (Figure 1).
Data analysis
Population characteristics are reported as percentage, mean and median values,
standard deviation, and range. Data was analyzed in the Infectious Diseases
Department.
To determine the diagnostic value of COVID-VIRO®, the study population was
stratified into two groups:
1.
Already confirmed RT-qPCR positive patients at the time of inclusion.
Comparison between RT-qPCR and COVID-VIRO® results in these patients
was used to assess diagnostic test sensitivity.
2.
Non-selected symptomatic or asymptomatic patients voluntarily accessing
the COVID-19 Screening Department in order to detect a possible SARSCoV-2 infection. Analysing data, RT-qPCR positive patients were added to the
first group in order to assess diagnostic test sensitivity. Conversely, RT-qPCR
negative patients were selected to quantify the specificity of the rapid test.
COVID-VIRO® specificity and sensitivity were calculated using the RT-qPCR
results as reference test, according to the following formulas:
Specificity (%) = 100 x [Negative / (Negative + Positive)]
Sensitivity (%) = 100 x [Positive/ (Positive + Negative)]
The size of the study population was calculated on the basis of a 95% sensitivity
with a lower margin of the confidence interval over 91% and a 99% specificity

with a lower margin over 95% according to the WHO recommendations for
antigenic rapid test. T Student test was used to compare means.

Results
121 patients with a SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection and 127 patients with no
evidence of recent or ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in the
study. A total of 248 couples of nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed. Of these,
228 were collected in Orléans, and 20 in Paris.
The sex ratio of the study population was 0,9 (117 men and 131 women). The
median and mean age was 38 and 43 years old, respectively (range: 18-96).
Figure 2 shows the flow chart of included subjects in the study. One patient
exhibiting only one positive target (gene S, Ct 36) at RT-qPCR analysis, was
considered as negative according to the French Society of Microbiology criteria
and the extraction kit instructions, and he was therefore included in the group of
SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. 97 patients were symptomatic and 24 totally
asymptomatic. No data about household or non-household close contacts were
available.
Among the 121 patients diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive, 17 were hospitalized
(14%) and 97 (80.1%) were symptomatic. The median time of symptoms
duration before sampling was 5 days (mean: 6 days, range: 1-20).
N gene mean Ct value was 25 (range: 15-34) in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2
positive patients, compared to 27 (range: 13-35) in symptomatic positive
patients. The difference was not significant (p<0.05). In patients tested positive
within 0 to 4 days from symptoms onset, the N gene mean Ct value was 25
(range: 13-35), versus 28 (range: 18-33) in those tested within 5 and 7 days, and
30 (range: 21-35) in those tested after more than 7 days, showing a constant
decrease in viral carriage. Although some RT-qPCR false negative patients had
a higher Ct value (suggestive of a lower RNA carriage), COVID-VIRO® was
able to detect the antigen in 20 patients who had been reporting symptoms for
more than 7 days.
Among the 121 RT-qPCR positive patients, 4 had a negative COVID-VIRO®
result (3.3% false negative). The overall sensitivity of our POCT is estimated at
96.7% (IC: 93.5%-99.9%) (table 1). Among the 24 asymptomatic patients, no
COVID-VIRO® false negative result was reported.
Table 2 shows the COVID-VIRO® performances according to the Ct value and
the delay of symptoms onset. COVID-VIRO® sensitivity was extremely high

among patients having a Gene N, S or ORF Ct-values ≥32, considering that 34
out of 37 patients were tested positive [sensitivity: 91.9% (95% IC: 83.1% 100%)].
Table 3 reports the characteristics of the four COVID-VIRO® false negative
cases. Three out of four had Ct values ≥ 32 and were considered as noncontagious, regardless the date of onset of symptoms.
Twenty positive patients having a previous positive RT-qPCR were tested
negative when the second RT-qPCR was simultaneously performed with the
POCT. All of these had a positive COVID-VIRO® result (mainly weak or very
weak line) suggesting that it may still be positive some days after the PCR
negativization.
Among the 127 patients with no SARS-CoV-2 infection, no false positive result
was observed as the concordance between RT-qPCR and COVID-VIRO® was
100%. COVID-VIRO® specificity is therefore estimated at 100%.
Additionally, 48 patients having a positive COVID-VIRO® test on
nasopharyngeal swab specimen accepted undergoing a simultaneous
oropharyngeal (34 patients) or saliva swab (14 patients). COVID-VIRO® turned
positive in 24 out of 34 and 0 out of 14 patients on oropharyngeal and saliva
specimens, respectively. Sensitivity was 70.6% for oropharyngeal and 0% for
saliva specimens.

Discussion
This observational study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a POCT
developed to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens from a nasopharyngeal swab directly
after sampling and provide the result within 15 minutes. The diagnostic value of
COVID-VIRO® was determined using RT-qPCR as gold standard in a
community setting. In the current study, COVID-VIRO® sensitivity and
specificity were 96.7% and 100% respectively, with no observed false positive.
Although results should be evaluated after 15 minutes, positive results almost
always appeared within the first five minutes, not infrequently within one
minute.
To date, several studies have evaluated the diagnostic performance of POCTs in
real life, yielding conflicting data (9-21). In general, sensitivity ranged from

60.8% to 79.6% (13-18). Occasionally, significantly high sensitivity (93.9% and
98.3%) has been reported (19-21).

Concerning the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid test (Abbott), the manufacturer
reported a high sensitivity (93.3%; 95 CI 83.8-98.2) in a high endemic setting in
Brazil (23) but other independent cohort studies have not confirmed these data.
In 257 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients enrolled at the Emergency
Department and Primary Health Care Setting in Spain, overall sensitivity was
73.3%, reaching 86.5% among patients having symptoms for less than seven
days (11). In another multicentric study performed on 200 SARS-CoV-2
positive patients, POCT sensitivity was 72.6% (95% CI: 64.5-79.9%) in the
Netherlands and 81.0% (95% CI: 69.0–89.8%) in Aruba. Test sensitivity was as
high as 95.2% (95% CI: 89.3-98.5%) in patient with RT-qPCR test positivity to
Ct-values < 32. (24).
In our study, stratifying patients by the Ct value, COVID-VIRO® sensitivity
remained extremely high even for Ct values >32 (96.9%; 95% IC: 91.1% 100%).
Detection of viral RNA on nasopharyngeal samples is not necessarily related to
infectiousness (25). Several factors determine the risk of viral transmission:
these include whether a virus is still viable, the amount of viral replication
estimated by the Ct, the presence of respiratory symptoms, the individual’s local
mucosal immune response to the virus, and the behaviour of the infected
individual and their close contacts (26). However, in the present study the
number of viral particles estimated by the Ct value did not differ in
asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. COVIDVIRO® appears to be as sensitive as RT-qPCR to detect infected patients in a
limited number of asymptomatic patients.
Available data report that RNA viral load rapidly decreases after the onset of
symptoms, and infectiousness generally declines within 7–10 days (25, 27-30).
Stratifying our patients by symptoms duration at sampling, we observed a
similar decline from day 1 to day 14 in the mean Ct value enregistered. Only
one hospitalized patient aged over 80, exhibited a Ct value of S :21, N: 22, ORF:
21 at day 10. Anyway, our POCT was able to detect the antigen both within and
after 4 days since the onset of symptoms.

Considering discordant results, the analytical performances depend on different
factors including viral load, quality of the specimen and processing. The two
nasopharyngeal swabs were concurrently performed by the same operator, but a
greater quantity of secretions and virus were likely to be more concentrated on
the first one. Unfortunately, we cannot know the temporal order in which each
swab was performed. Furthermore, waiting one hour between the two samples
was infeasible.
Analysing POCT results on oropharyngeal and saliva specimens of positive
patients, we quickly realized that sensitivity dramatically drops. Even if
nasopharyngeal swab is uncomfortable for patients, this specimen should be
privileged for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether obtained
through PCR or POCTs.
This study has several limitations. First, this study is not a real-life study as
when PCR positive patients came back for the study, the operators knew the
status of the patient. Then, operators paid more attention to the results within 15
minutes. This method allows to give the real performances of the test done in the
best conditions. This could be not the same in the real life, with many operators,
emergencies ward where nurses will not necessary wait enough before reading
or did not have the best conditions to read a thin line. Second, the date of
symptoms onset was reported by patients and may not always be accurate,
leading to an inaccurate stratification of patients. Then, the number of
asymptomatic patients is rather limited to obtain conclusive data, even if we did
not observe any discordance between tests in this group of patients. Finally, we
did not perform any parallel comparison with other POCTs.
In France, nurses, pharmaceuticals, and general practitioners have recently been
authorized to perform POCTs in medical settings (7). Data obtained from the
current study could reassure health authorities in expanding access to POCTs
that, in addition to being quick and easy to use, are also reliable. In the current
setting, positive unaware people could wait for RT-qPCR results for several
days. During this time, they could easily infect their close contacts. A more
rapid diagnosis and the subsequent contact tracing would certainly positively
impact on the containment of transmission.
In the Emergency Departments, POCTs could also be used to quickly recognise
asymptomatic positive from negative patients, avoiding SARS-CoV-2

nosocomial infection. Furthermore, such tests would likely be useful in low- and
middle-income countries and at airports to limit the viral spread worldwide.

Conclusion
COVID-VIRO® (AAZ, Boulogne Billancourt, France) was a quite a reliable test
for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity on
nasopharyngeal swabs were 96.7 % (95% CI 9 – 99.9%) and 100% respectively.
To date, this is the unique COVID-19 antigenic rapid test fulfilling the WHO’s
recommendations for a screening test (sensitivity ≥80%, specificity ≥97-100%).
Unfortunately, performing the test on oropharyngeal or salivary samples is not
as reliable.
