Abstract
Background
Understanding risk factors for death in Covid-19 is key to providing good quality clinical care. Due
to a paucity of robust evidence, we sought to assess the presenting characteristics of patients with
Covid-19 and investigate factors associated with death.

Methods
Retrospective analysis of adults admitted with Covid-19 to Royal Oldham Hospital, UK. Logistic
regression modelling was utilised to explore factors predicting death.

Results
470 patients were admitted, of whom 169 (36%) died. The median age was 71 years (IQR 57–82),
and 255 (54.3%) were men. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n=218, 46.4%),
diabetes (n=143, 30.4%) and chronic neurological disease (n=123, 26.1%). The most frequent
complications were acute kidney injury (n=157, 33.4%) and myocardial injury (n=21, 4.5%).
Forty-three (9.1%) patients required intubation and ventilation, and 39 (8.3%) received noninvasive ventilation Independent risk factors for death were increasing age (OR per 10 year
increase above 40 years 1.87, 95% CI 1.57-2.27), hypertension (OR 1.72, 1.10-2.70), cancer (OR
2.20, 1.27-3.81), platelets <150x103/µL (OR 1.93, 1.13-3.30), C-reactive protein ≥100 µg/mL (OR
1.68, 1.05-2.68), >50% chest radiograph infiltrates, (OR 2.09, 1.16-3.77) and acute kidney injury

(OR 2.60, 1.64-4.13). There was no independent association between death and gender, ethnicity,
deprivation level, fever, SpO2/FiO2 (oxygen saturation index), lymphopenia or other comorbidities.

Conclusions
We characterised the ‘first wave’ of patients with Covid-19 in one of England’s highest incidence
areas, determining which factors predict death. These findings will inform clinical and shared
decision making, including the use of respiratory support and therapeutic agents.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has spread rapidly around the world from an initial cluster of
viral pneumonia linked to a wet market in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The United Kingdom
(UK) recorded its first case on 31st January 2020 and as of 8th July 2020 has recorded 44,321 deaths
representing the 4th highest per capita fatality rate worldwide at 66.6 per 100,000 people. [1]. Oldham, a
large town forming part of the Greater Manchester urban conurbation, has recorded the fifth highest
incidence rate nationally, with 783.0 cases per 100,000 people. [2]

Much of the data outlining patient characteristics and risk factors for severe disease and mortality has
come from Chinese case series with unadjusted analyses, and it is unclear how these findings relate to
other populations. Increasing age or SOFA score and D-dimer >1μg/mL were identified through
multivariable analysis of 171 patients in Wuhan as independent predictors of death in hospital. [3]
Other factors reported from China associated with severe disease or death include hypertension,
cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease [4], and chronic kidney disease [5]. These factors were
also identified by Docherty et al as independent risk factors for death in an interim observational
registry study of 20,133 hospitalised UK patients in addition to other chronic conditions. [6] Concern

has been raised in the UK around the risk of death from Covid-19 in those of Black and Asian ethnicity,
with these groups more likely to test positive and be hospitalised in the UK. [7]

Understanding factors that predispose to death from Covid-19 in hospital is crucial to providing good
patient care; including clinical and shared decision making, timely escalation of care for respiratory
support, and targeted use of potential antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies. As such, we sought to
describe the characteristics and outcomes of those admitted with Covid-19 in Oldham, Greater
Manchester, UK, including sociodemographic factors, presenting clinical, biochemical and radiological
features, and complications. We assessed whether these characteristics were associated with death in
hospital or within 30 days of discharge.

Methods
Study setting
The Royal Oldham Hospital is a 445 bed district general hospital located in Greater Manchester, a large
urban conurbation in North West England serving a patient population of 230,000 people. [8] Oldham
is amongst the most deprived areas in England, ranking 19th of 317 local authorities nationally in the
2009 indices of multiple deprivation (IMD). [9] The predominant ethnic group is White (77.5%), with a
considerably younger population of Pakistani (10.1%) and Bangladeshi (7.3%) heritage. [10]
Population density is almost four times the national average at 15.8 persons per hectare. [11] Data was
collected from electronic patient records in Symphony (EMIS Health) and HealthViews (Computer
Sciences Corporation).

Inclusion criteria
470 patients were included. Individuals ≥18 years admitted to Royal Oldham Hospital were included if
SARS-2 CoV was detected by realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab

prior to or during admission. Patients included were admitted between 12th March 2020 and 19th May
2020, in addition to those who acquired Covid-19 as inpatients.

Outcome measures
The main outcome measure was death during admission or within 30 days of discharge, as recorded in
the electronic patient record.

Explanatory variables
Age, gender, ethnicity, postcode, date of admission, and date of discharge were recorded from
structured fields. Age was categorised as <40 years, 40 – 50 years, 50 – 60 years, 60 – 70 years, 70 –
80 years, or > 90 years. Ethnicity was categorised into five groups – White British, Asian,
African/Caribbean or other black background, Other white background, and other/not specified.
Postcodes were used to generate IMD quintiles and deciles using the UK government Ministry of
Housing, Communities and Local Government Postcode Lookup tool.

Physiological parameters at admission including heart rate, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate,
oxygen saturation, and temperature were collected from observations taken at triage in the emergency
department. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was estimated from oxygen flow rate using a
standardised conversion table. SpO2 (oxygen saturation) / FiO2 ratio, a validated surrogate for PaO2 /
FiO2, was categorised as >315, <315, or <235 as indicators of mild, moderate, and severe acute lung
injury (ALI) respectively. [12] Non-respiratory symptoms were categorised as gastrointestinal, cardiac,
neurological, and/or other incidental symptoms. Clinical frailty scale (CFS) [13] was recorded from
admission documentation. Immunosuppression was defined as recent chemotherapy or use of
immunomodulatory medication including oral steroids on admission.

The following laboratory parameters were collected; admission lymphocyte count (x 103/µL),
lymphocyte nadir during admission (x 103/µL), admission platelet count (x 103/µL) and admission Creactive protein (CRP) (µg/mL). Admission chest radiographs were categorised by degree of total new
lung field infiltrates as none, less than 50%, or greater than 50%. Two clinicians reviewed radiographs
where there was uncertainty.

Complications relating to Covid-19 were recorded, with pulmonary embolus, deep vein thrombosis and
stroke recorded if confirmed by imaging studies. Super-added bacterial pneumonia was recorded if a
causative organism was isolated. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was assessed using the Kidney Disease
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, and myocardial injury was deemed present if troponin
elevation above the normal range (<2ng/L) was present without alternative explanation.

Statistical analysis
Data was collected using Microsoft Excel. STATA 13 was used to produce summary statistics and
assess associations with death in hospital or within 30 days of discharge.
For univariate analysis Pearson’s chi-squared test (χ² ) was used to test the significance of categorical
variables. Odds ratios for death and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for categorical variables.
A K-sample equality-of-medians test was used to assess for significant differences in the medians of
continuous variables for survivors compared to non-survivors given. A significance level of 0.05 was
used for all statistical tests.
A logistic regression model to examine which factors predict death was constructed using dependent
variables previously proposed as poor prognostic markers, as well as those with p values from
univariate statistical tests of <0.25. The initial model was refined through backward elimination using
the likelihood ratio test to assess for significant difference in model fit. CFS was removed from the
model due to collinearity with age. The linktest program within STATA did not provide evidence of a

Results
Sociodemographic factors
FIGURE 1 and FIGURE 2
Of 470 patients admitted 36.0% (n=169) died during admission, within 30 days of discharge, or by the
date of data collection. One patient remained an inpatient by the conclusion of data collection and 27
patients had been discharged from hospital <30 days. The median age of those admitted was 71 years
(IQR 57–82 years), and the median age of non-survivors was 80 years. More men (54.3%, n=255) than
women (45.7%, n=215) were admitted but following admission no difference in frequency of death was
present (p=0.95). White British patients were the largest ethnic group (78.3%, n=368), followed by
Asian (10.6%, n=50) and Other white background (5.1%, n=24), predominantly from Eastern Europe.
In keeping with high local levels of deprivation, 44.9% of patients were classified as being in the most
deprived quintile nationally. Death was significantly more frequent with increasing age (per 10 year
age bracket increase above age 40 years OR 1.89, CI 1.62–2.20 p <0.001), and less frequent among
those of Asian (OR 0.37, CI 0.18–0.76 p <0.01) and Other white background ethnicity (OR 0.29, CI
0.10–0.88 p <0.02) compared to White British patients. IMD quintile was not associated with death.

Comorbidities
FIGURE 3
Median CFS was significantly higher in non-survivors (6 IQR 4-7 vs. 3 IQR 2-5 for survivors), with a
mean total number of significant comorbidities of 3.2 (SD 1.7) among those who died vs. 2.1 (SD 1.6)
for survivors. 13.9% (n=66) had no prior significant medical conditions. The most common
comorbidities were hypertension (46.4%, n = 218), diabetes (30.4%, n=143), and chronic neurological
disease including dementia and other neurodegenerative conditions (26.1%, n=123). Hypertension,
ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic neurological disease, and current
or prior cancer were significantly more prevalent among those who died. Smoking, diabetes, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic liver disease, and immunosuppressive medication on
admission were not significantly more common among non-survivors.

TABLE 2

Physiological parameters on admission
Tachypnoea was common, with 70% (n=329) presenting with a respiration rate ≥20/minute), and 38.5%
(n=171) required supplemental oxygen. 15.7% (n=74) of patients were classified by SpO2/FiO2 index
as severe ALI, 14.3% (n=67) as moderate ALI, and 70% (n=329) as mild or no ALI. Fever
(temperature ≥37.8°C) was present in 40.6% (n=191) at triage. Admission respiration rate, severity of
acute lung injury, heart rate, blood pressure, or fever were not associated with death.

The median duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 4 days (IQR 2-7), with no significant
difference between survivors and non-survivors. Gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting or diarrhoea) were present in 18.9% (n=89) of patients, neurological symptoms (confusion or
focal neurological signs) were present in 7.9% (n=37) patients, and presentations in keeping with

cardiac disease (acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis) were evident in 1.3% (n=6) patients.
Interestingly, one patient presented with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and one with
cerebral vasculitis. 10.4% of patients (n=49) presented with clinical features consistent with alternative
diagnoses in whom Covid-19 was found incidentally or diagnosed during admission.

TABLE 3

Biochemical and radiological features on admission
54.9% (n=258) of patients had a falling lymphocyte count during admission, with a median value on
admission of 1.0 (IQR 0.7-1.4) and a median lymphocyte nadir of 0.7 (IQR 0.5-1.1). There was no
significant difference in these values between survivors and non-survivors, and falling lymphocyte
count during admission was not associated with death. The median admission CRP was significantly
higher among those who died (94µg/mL IQR 38-167µg/mL vs. 75µg/mL IQR 34–132 µg/mL for
survivors), whilst the median admission platelet count was significantly lower among non-survivors
(190 x 103/µL, IQR 142-275 x 103/µL vs. 224 x 103/µL, IQR 178-302 x 103/µL for survivors). New
infiltrates were noted on admission chest radiographs of 63.4% (n=298) of patients, with more than
50% total lung field involvement evident in 25.5% (n=120). Univariate analysis did not reveal an
increased risk of death among those with new chest radiograph infiltrates.

TABLE 4

Complications and respiratory support
The most commonly observed complications due to Covid-19 were acute kidney injury (AKI) (33.4%
n=157), myocardial injury (4.5% n=21), and bacterial pneumonia (3.2%, n=15). Pulmonary embolus
was identified on 5 of 24 computed tomography pulmonary angiograms (1.1% of all patients), whilst

deep vein thrombosis was identified from 8 of 19 duplex venous ultrasounds (1.7% of all patients).
Acute kidney injury and myocardial injury were more common among those who died.
Respiratory support was required by 14.7% (n=69) of patients, with 1.7% (n=8) of patients receiving
High flow nasal cannula (HFNC), 8.3% (n=39) receiving non-invasive continuous positive pressure
airway ventilation (CPAP), and 9.2% (n=43) intubated and mechanically ventilated (IMV). The use of
more than one mode of respiratory support was frequently employed.

TABLE 5

Multivariate analysis
Logistic regression identified the following variables which were also significant in univariate analysis
as independent risk factors for death - increasing age, history of hypertension, current or previous
cancer, admission CRP ≥100µg/mL, admission platelet count <150 x 103 /µL, and AKI. Additionally,
the model identified >50% total lung field infiltrates, which was not significant in univariate analysis,
as a significant risk factor for death. Ethnicity, history of chronic kidney disease, ischaemic heart
disease, heart failure or chronic neurological disease, and myocardial injury, which were observed more
frequently among those who died, were not significant in the adjusted model. No other explanatory
variables were found to be significant independent predictors of death.

We assessed a wider range of potential risk factors for death than previous studies, with selection of
variables guided by their clinical importance to us as hospital physicians in describing the overall
clinical state of patients admitted to hospital with acute illness. In keeping with prior studies which
adjusted for either no or fewer clinically relevant factors [3, 4, 6], we identified a wide range of factors
that were more common among non-survivors. However, only increasing age, hypertension, previous
or current cancer, platelet count <150 x 103/µL, CRP ≥100 µg/mL, greater than 50% total lung field
infiltrates on chest radiograph, and AKI were identified as independent risk factors for death in our
clinically relevant and statistically robust regression model. Our mortality rate of 36.0% (n=169) is in
keeping with the UK’s mortality rate for those hospitalised with Covid-19. [14]

More men than women were admitted, although the 53.2% of men in our cohort is significantly smaller
than the 60% of males admitted in a previous large UK multicentre study. [6] Incredibly, we observed
no difference in mortality by gender, despite men accounting for 80% of those requiring intubation, and
gender remained a non-significant factor following multivariate analysis. This finding is in stark
contrast to reports that men hospitalised with Covid-19 are at higher risk of death. [6] Whilst death was
more frequent among White British patients, no ethnic group was an independent risk factor for
mortality. Ethnicity was strongly attenuated in the logistic regression model by age, with the median
age of White British patients 20 and 31 years greater than those of Black and Asian patients
respectively. This study was underpowered to detect a mortality difference in Black patients given the
low number admitted.

Hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and current smoking were recorded far more frequently in our cohort
than in the largest UK study assessing the characteristics of those admitted with Covid-19. [6]
Hypertension was present in almost half of those admitted and 46.3% (n=101) of this group died
suggesting patients with hypertension should be regarded as a particularly high-risk group. Whilst

hypertension and cancer were independent risk factors for death in our multivariate analysis, [6]
previously reported factors including diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and
ischaemic heart disease [3, 15] were not found to be independent risk factors. The majority of patients
admitted had at least one comorbidity, and only four patients without comorbidity died, suggesting that
those without significant medical problems are at very low risk of death.

Lymphopenia was observed in 63.2% of patients, in keeping with previous studies suggesting it is an
important predictor of severe disease. [16] However, we did not find any evidence that admission
lymphocyte count, lymphocyte nadir, or falling lymphocytes are associated with death in either
univariate or multivariate analysis, suggesting that any prognostic implication is rendered prior to the
point of hospital admission. We suggest that lymphocyte count is of diagnostic utility only and is not a
useful prognostic marker during hospital admission. However, we identified CRP ≥100 µg/mL and
platelet count <150 x 103/µL as independent risk factors for death, which could be monitored serially to
risk stratify patients.

SpO2/FiO2 is a validated surrogate for PaO2/FiO2 used to classify severity of acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), [12] a condition thought to share pathophysiological mechanisms with Covid-19.
Surprisingly, no difference in SpO2/FiO2 was observed between survivors and non-survivors, but the
presence of infiltrates involving more than 50% of the lung fields on admission chest radiograph was
an independent predictor of death. We recommend greater prognostic weight be given to severity of
radiological changes than SpO2 and oxygen requirement at presentation.

Optimal fluid management is imperative given the high incidence of acute kidney injury and
independent association with death in our cohort, underlining a recent recommendation to maintain
euvolaemia from the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [17]. This followed

initial concerns that fluid therapy may increase mortality through worsening of non-cardiogenic
pulmonary oedema. It is unclear how changing practice has impacted upon the incidence of AKI and
its attributable mortality.

Strengths
We assessed variables available on admission that we as clinicians felt were important in describing the
clinical state of acutely unwell patients. Our results are of particular relevance to areas of similar
sociodemographic makeup including cities in the UK, and overseas. Unlike previous studies, we report
near complete outcome data for our cohort, with one patient hospitalised at conclusion of data
collection. We utilised an iterative process (backward elimination) to derive a fully adjusted model with
good predictive ability.

Limitations
We assessed risk factors for death present in hospitalised patients and have not investigated those not
requiring admission. Consequently, there may be risk factors that confer risk for hospitalisation, and
therefore a higher risk of death, that we have not identified. This is suggested, for example, by the
disproportionate number of men admitted.

Conclusions
We characterised the ‘first wave’ of patients presenting to a district general hospital with Covid-19 in
one of England’s highest incidence areas, and determined that increasing age, hypertension, cancer,
CRP >100µg/mL, platelets <150 x 103/µL, severe chest radiograph appearance and acute kidney injury
independently predict death following admission. We propose greater prognostic weight be given to
these factors than to SpO2, oxygen requirement or lymphopenia, which did not predict death. Results

from both our unadjusted and adjusted analyses dispute other previously proposed risk factors for death
in hospital including male gender and diabetes.

These findings have the potential to inform decision making by front-line clinicians at the point of
admission to hospital allowing risk stratification, improved shared decision-making with patients, the
timely provision of respiratory support and targeted use of potential therapies for those most likely to
benefit. If our model is prospectively validated, we anticipate introducing a clinical decision tool to aid
prognostication for hospitalised patients with Covid-19.
