Abstract
Background: There is insufficient information about risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis and
adverse outcomes from low and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Objectives: We estimated the association between patients’ characteristics and COVID-19
diagnosis, hospitalization and adverse outcome in Mexico.
Methods: This retrospective case series used a publicly available nation-level dataset released
on May 31, 2020 by the Mexican Ministry of Health, with patients classified as suspected cases
of viral respiratory disease. Patients with COVID-19 were laboratory-confirmed. Their profile
was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis or not. Differences among COVID-19 patients based on
two separate clinical endpoints, hospitalization and adverse outcome, were examined.
Multivariate logistic regressions examined the associations between patient characteristics and
hospitalization and adverse outcome.
Results: Overall, 236,439 patients were included, with 89,756 (38.0%) being diagnosed with
COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were disproportionately older, males and with increased
prevalence of one or more comorbidities, particularly diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Age,
male gender, diabetes, obesity and having one or more comorbidities were independently
associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Current smokers were 23% less likely to be
diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. Of all COVID-19 patients, 34.8% were
hospitalized and 13.0% experienced an adverse outcome. Male gender, older age, having one or
more comorbidities, and chronic renal disease, diabetes, obesity, COPD, immunosuppression and
hypertension were associated with hospitalization and adverse outcome. Current smoking was
not associated with adverse outcome.

Introduction
As the global pandemic of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by the
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is evolving, it is important
to understand the pathophysiology and the mechanisms of disease progression. The rapid
transmission of the disease and the increased pressure across healthcare systems have led to
emergency measures resulting in substantial social and economic disruption. As of May 30,
almost 5.9 million people globally have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and approximately
367,255 deaths have been reported. The disease has a wide range of clinical presentations, from
mild symptoms resembling the common flu to severe, life-threatening manifestations such as
Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), thrombotic complications and neurological
symptoms.1-3 Risk factors for adverse outcomes include age, hypertension, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease.4
The pandemic represents a big challenge particularly for low- and middle-income countries
(LMIC). The cost of epidemiologic surveillance and of infection prevention and control, the
sudden flow and the need to enhance the constrained critical care capacity to treat COVID-19
patients and the implementation of non-medical interventions such as social distancing measures
are expected to significantly stress the limited financial resources of these countries.5 Therefore,
understanding the factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and adverse prognosis is
crucial to guide local authorities towards more efficient allocation of their scarce resources to
avoid exceeding the limited capacity of the healthcare system.
In this study, we present evidence and information about patients who were screened for
COVID-19 due to suspected viral respiratory infection through the respective surveillance
system implemented in Mexico. The objective of this study was to examine the association

between individuals’ sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and COVID-19 diagnosis.
Additionally, we explored similar associations with two clinical outcomes, hospitalization and
adverse outcome, within the COVID-19 diagnosed cohort. This study extends the current
literature by presenting novel information and evidence about COVID-19 patients in Mexico
using a large and recent cohort of such patients, with potentially important implications at the
clinical and policy level.

Methods
Study design, setting and participants
We performed a cross-sectional secondary data analysis using a publicly available individuallevel dataset which included patients classified as ‘suspected cases of viral respiratory disease’
during point of service at medical facilities in Mexico. The dataset was released by the Mexican
Health Ministry and was compiled by the General Bureau of Epidemiology (Dirección General
de Epidemiología, DGE) through the System of Epidemiological Surveillance of Viral
Respiratory Diseases.6,7 The latter comprises of 475 Monitoring Units of Viral Respiratory
Disease (Unidades Monitoras de Enfermedad Respiratoria Viral, USMER) spread across the
country and covering all institutions affiliated to the Health Ministry collectively denoted as the
Health Sector. Additional data were provided by healthcare units that did not belong to USMER
but had been adapted to screen suspected COVID-19 cases. As specified by the official
guidelines issued by the DGE, the entries in the dataset only correspond to data obtained from
the epidemiological study of “suspected case of viral respiratory disease” at the time it was
identified at medical units of the Health Sector.

This dataset is continuously updated, and we used the version released on May 31, 2020, which
included 274,997 patients.
No ethics approval was sought for this study since it involves analysis of an anonymized dataset
of patients that is publicly available and accessible to anyone through the Mexican Health
Ministry.

Data sources
Upon admission, patients were screened by healthcare professionals who were expected to verify
that the subjects show specific symptoms documented as inclusion criteria for the dataset.
Additionally, they recorded data about the medical history on a specific DGE form. After the
case was evaluated and confirmed at the district, state and national level surveillance system, it
was added to the dataset. Both USMER and Non-USMER units had to fill the same forms which
were sent to an online platform (SISVER platform). According to the DGE guidance, USMER
and non-USMER units should perform diagnostic testing for COVID-19 (RT-PCR) in all cases
with serious symptoms. For cases with mild symptoms (classified as ambulatory cases), USMER
units were expected to perform COVID-19 diagnostic testing on 10% of these cases whereas
non-USMER units would test cases depending on their resource capacity.
Laboratory testing to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed according to WHO interim
guidance.8 Combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained and placed in a
container. For mechanically-ventilated patients, bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained. In case of
death, lung biopsies were obtained during autopsy, from an area visibly affected by disease. The

samples were sent to the nearest Laboratory of Respiratory Virus (InDRE) for testing with RTPCR.

Variables
The dataset included information on COVID-19 testing results, categorized as positive, negative
and pending, and individual-level data on sociodemographics, specifically age, gender and
nationality (Mexican or not). The type of facility where the patient was diagnosed was reported,
as well as information on whether the healthcare unit was part of the USMER network or not.
Comorbidities reported were diabetes, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), asthma,
immunosuppression, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, chronic renal disease and
other comorbidities. Smoking was also recorded, with participants classified as smokers (who
were considered current smokers) or non-smokers. No data on former smokers was available.
For patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, the dataset included additional
information related to clinical endpoints, namely whether the patient was admitted into an
intensive care unit, was mechanically ventilated, or died.

Outcomes and analysis
The first outcome variable of interest in the study was whether a patient was diagnosed with
COVID-19 or not, defined as a dichotomous indicator. We thus excluded 36,803 patients
(13.4%) with pending results, resulting in a final sample of 238,194 patients. We also explored
two outcomes within the subgroup of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization and

adverse outcome. Both outcomes were dichotomous. Adverse outcome was defined as the
primary composite end-point of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation or death.
We included individual-level sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and facility
information based on data availability. Sociodemographic patient-level information included age,
gender, and Mexican nationality (or not). Clinical information included number of comorbidities,
whether the patient had a particular clinical condition or not, namely asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, obesity, hypertension, immunosuppression, cardiovascular
condition, and chronic renal disease. We also included information on whether the patient was a
current smoker and whether there was previous contact with someone who was diagnosed with
COVID-19. Facility specific information included the type of facility by ownership and whether
the medical unit is a monitoring unit for respiratory diseases (USMER). USMER consists of
medical facilities which monitor the incidence of infectious respiratory diseases as part of the
government Epidemiological Surveillance system.
We initially conducted descriptive analyses of all patients to characterize the overall study
population. We then explored and compared all patients stratified by whether they were
diagnosed with COVID-19 or not. Subsequently, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were
stratified by the two outcomes of interest (hospitalization and adverse outcome) using bivariate
analyses. We tested for statistical differences in the stratified analyses using Pearson’s chi-square
for categorical variables and the non-parametric Mann Whitney U test on the age variable (as
numeric).
We then estimated the association between the three outcomes of interest and all the independent
variables using two multivariate logistic regressions per outcome (six in total). Both models
included sociodemographic and facility-specific information. The first model also included

clinical comorbidities as dichotomous indicators, while the second included the number of
clinical diagnoses (comorbidities) only, due to multicollinearity as the later was derived from the
clinical diagnoses. We also included area-of-residence fixed-effects to control for unobserved
regional variations. Finally, standard errors were clustered at the residence level. All analyses
were conducted using Stata (version 16.1; StataCorp, College Station, TX).

Results
Our final analytic sample included 236,439 patients suspected of having viral respiratory disease,
after excluding 1,755 patients (0.7%) due to missing variables. The majority were 18 to 44 years
of age, Mexicans, and around 40% of those had one or more comorbidities, while 9.1% were
current smokers (Table 1). The most prevalent clinical conditions included hypertension,
diabetes, and obesity. About 37% of the patients used a USMER facility and more than half used
hospitals of the Ministry of Health (Secretaria de Salubridad y Asistencia – SSA).
Around one-third (38.0%) of patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (Table 1). These patients
had higher shares of males (56.4% versus 47.5% for non-COVID-19 patients, p<0.001), and
were 6 years older on average (p<0.001). COVID-19 patients had also disproportionately higher
shares of one or more comorbidities (p<0.001), and chronic conditions particularly related to
diabetes, hypertension, and obesity (p<0.001 for all). We also observed greater shares for
USMER related COVID-19 cases at the facility level (p<0.001 for both).
Table 2 indicates the results of the two regressions on COVID-19 diagnosis for all patients in the
data. Across both models, females and younger patients (0 to 17) were significantly less likely to
be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to males and to their 18 to 44 counterparts (p<0.001for

all). In addition, current smokers were approximately 23% less likely to be diagnosed with
COVID-19 compared to non-smokers (p<0.001 in both models). In contrast, older patients (45
years of age or older) and those with one or more comorbidities were more likely to be
diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to those aged 18 to 44 and those without comorbidities
respectively. Diabetes and obesity were particularly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis
compared to patients without such conditions (p<0.001 for all).
Among the 89,756 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19, about 35% were hospitalized
and 13% had high clinical severity (Table 3). Across both subgroups, hospitalization and
adverse outcome were more frequent in males and older patients, with a mean age difference of
more than 12 years. Patients with one or more comorbidities, particularly those with
hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and COPD were also more prevalent in both the hospitalized and
the adverse outcome groups.
Table 4 indicates the results of the two regressions for hospitalization and adverse outcome,
respectively (Table 4). Across both models, males and older patients were significantly more
likely to be hospitalized and to experience adverse outcome compared to females and to their 18
to 44 old counterparts (p<0.001 for all). Those 0 to 17 years of age were also less likely to
experience adverse outcome compared to the 18 to 44 years age group. In addition, patients with
chronic renal disease, diabetes, immunosuppression, COPD, obesity, and hypertension were up
to 121% (adjusted OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.91-2.55, for those with chronic renal disease) more likely
to experience hospitalization and more severe composite endpoints compared to those without
such conditions (p<0.001 for all). Similarly, having one or more comorbidities increased the
likelihood of these outcomes, as expected (Table 5). Finally, we did not observe any significant
differences among current smokers compared to non-smokers across both outcomes.

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this study presents a case series with the highest number of
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, and the first of this size from a LMIC. The Chinese
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recently presented data from 44,672 confirmed cases,
however information about comorbidities was available for only 20,812 patients [9]. Another
study in the UK examined risk factors for critical care and mortality in hospital among 20,133
hospitalized COVID-19 patients [10]. In the US, patient characteristics, comorbidities and
outcomes were presented among 5,700 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in New York City
area [11]. Our study adds to the current evidence by presenting information from laboratoryconfirmed cases in a LMIC using a large publicly available dataset.
In agreement with previous studies [1, 10-15], age was a strong risk factor for hospitalization and
adverse outcome among COVID-19 patients. It was recognized early during the pandemic that
the elderly had higher rates of hospitalization and infection fatality ratios compared to younger
people [16]. Recently, the US CDC reported that the best estimate for the COVID-19
symptomatic case fatality ratio was 0.4% for the whole population but ranged from 0.05% for
those aged 0-49 years to 1.3% for those ≥ 65 years, a 26-fold difference [17]. Hospitalization
rates were estimated to be approximately almost 7-fold higher for patients aged ≥ 65 years
compared to those aged 18 to 44 years in our study. Thus, targeted interventions tailored at the
higher needs of older people are clearly to protect them from SARS-CoV-2 infection and to
reduce the COVID-19 burden of disease and death rates.
Our results indicate that cardiovascular and metabolic conditions were the most common
comorbidities identified among confirmed COVID-19 patients. Hypertension, obesity and
diabetes were not only common comorbidities but also independent correlates of hospitalization

and adverse outcome. These findings are in-line with case series from China, the US and Europe
[1, 9-14]. These conditions are very common worldwide and in Mexico. Approximately 1.4
billion adults are estimated to suffer from hypertension globally, with the prevalence being
higher in LMICs [18]. In Mexico the prevalence of hypertension was 25.5% in 2016 [19].
Obesity is also a major healthcare issue in Mexico. In a random sample of 2,511 adults, 38.3% of
Mexicans were overweight and almost 25% were obese [20]. The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) reports that Mexico is the one of the countries with the
highest rates of obesity in the population [21]. Obesity is a risk factor for diabetes, and Mexico
had an estimated 10.4% prevalence of diabetes in 2016 with a continuously increasing trend [22,
23]. The latter, in combination of increased prevalence of these conditions among COVID-19
patients suggests that such patients represent another population subgroup where targeted
interventions and guidance are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In contrast, while cardiovascular disease and COPD were risk factors for hospitalization and
adverse outcome, only a small proportion of patients suffered from these comorbidities. A case
series of 1,590 patients from China reported a similarly low prevalence of these comorbidities
among Chine patients [12]. The COPD prevalence in Mexico City was 3.4% in a study defining
airflow obstruction as FEV1/FEV6 below the 5th percentile or Lower Limit of Normal [24], but
it has been reported that COPD is highly underdiagnosed in Mexico and in other countries,
mainly because of lack of spirometry evaluation [25]. In a 2009 study, ischemic heart disease
and stroke prevalence in Mexico City ranged from 0.4% to 5.4% and from 0.4% to 3.5%,
respectively, depending on age [26]. In addition, other risk factors for adverse outcomes were
immunosuppression and chronic renal disease. Our findings are supported by a recent systematic

review and meta-analysis which found a higher risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes among
patients with chronic renal disease [27].
Furthermore, having more than one comorbidity was strongly associated with hospitalization and
adverse outcome. This is not unexpected considering that multiple comorbidities contribute to
disease complexity and such patients are more susceptible and vulnerable to adverse events.
Approximately 1 in 5 patients with laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 had more than 1
comorbidity, and they had approximately 3-fold higher risk for hospitalization and adverse
outcome. Therefore, it is necessary to prioritize the assessment of these patients, offering early
diagnosis and proper hospital care, while primary preventive measures to reduce disease
transmission to these patients are warranted.
Notably, smoking was not associated with a higher risk for adverse outcomes and
hospitalization. Smokers were also less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to nonsmokers. The latter is in agreement with a recent observational population study from Israel [28].
Some studies have found that smokers are under-represented among COVID-19 patients and
presented a hypothesis that nicotine may exert protective effects [29-31], while others found that
nicotine and smoking cause ACE2 up-regulation which may facilitate viral invasion and cell
entry [32, 33]. It is still not clear whether nicotine exerts any positive effect or not. However,
there is no doubt that smoking cannot be used as a protective measure and smoking cessation
should be encouraged during the COVID-19 pandemic [30]. The potential value of nicotine or
other nicotinic agonists in COVID-19 is expected to be determined through clinical trials.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a
receptor for cell entry and viral replication [34]. While this would imply that ACE2 upregulation would be associated with COVID-19 severity and adverse outcome, there is evidence

that the opposite is the case. Risk factors for adverse outcomes identified in this and other
studies, such as age, male gender, endocrine and cardiovascular diseases, are associated with
lower levels of ACE2. [35-38]. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that ACE2 deficiency may in
fact be detrimental for COVID-19 [39]. Additionally, severe COVID-19 represents a hyperinflammatory response with patients developing cytokine storm and exhibiting ineffective
regulation of the immune response [40]. Risk factors identified in this study also represent
inflammatory conditions [41-44]. Thus, there is a relevant pathophysiological basis explaining
the association between hospitalized and adverse COVID-19 outcomes and the comorbidities
identified in our analysis.
This study is not without limitations. First, given the nature and the availability of the data, we
were not able to use more detailed clinical and laboratory information for the patients. For
example, immunodeficiency may include a vast array of different disease conditions; however,
no specific information was provided in the dataset. Second, we were not able to include facility
and regional specific information, due to the lack of such information in the dataset. However,
we believe that we sufficiently addressed the heterogeneity between hospitals and regions using
the appropriate variables in our analyses, given the research question of interest. Finally, some of
the patients may not have recovered by the time the dataset was released and thus the outcome is
unknown, while it is also possible that some outpatients may experience disease progression and
will thus require hospitalization in the future.
In conclusion, this large retrospective case series from Mexico, the largest ever presented for
COVID-19, identified risk factors for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis as well as for
hospitalization and adverse outcome among COVID-19 patients. These findings could provide
valuable insight for Mexico and other LMICs in setting priorities, properly allocating healthcare
