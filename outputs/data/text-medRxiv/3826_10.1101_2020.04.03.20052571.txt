The distress of Iranian adults during the Covid-19 pandemic – More distressed than the
Chinese and with different predictors
Summary

Early papers on the mental health of the public during the Covid-19 pandemic surveyed participants from China.
Outside of China, Iran has emerged as one of the most affected countries with a high death count and rate. The
paper presents the first empirical evidence from Iranian adults during the Covid-19 pandemic on their level of
distress and its predictors. On March 25–28, 2020, a dire time for Covid-19 in Iran, we surveyed 1058 adults
from all 30 provinces in Iran using the Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). The distress level of
Iranian adults (mean: 34.54; s.d.: 14.92) was significantly higher (mean difference: 10.9; t=22.7; p<0.0001; 95%
CI: 10.0 to 11.8) than that of Chinese adults (mean: 23.65; s.d.: 5.45) as reported in a prior study with the same
measure of Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). We also found the predictors of distress in Iran vary
from those in China. Our findings that the predictors of distress in Iran vary from those in China suggest the
need to study the predictors of mental health in individual countries during the Covid-19 pandemic to effectively
identify and screen for those more susceptible to mental health issues.

Introduction
Covid-19 disrupts lives and work and causes psychological distress to the general public1–4. The Covid-19
outbreak first triggered public panic and mental health distress in China2. Early research has found working
adults in more affected areas in China had worse health conditions, more distress and lower life satisfactions3.
Researchers at Shanghai Mental Health Center developed a Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) to
assess the distress level specific to Covid-195. Such research on mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic is
critical to identify and screen people psychiatrically based on their distress levels to prioritize mental health
services online during the ongoing crisis2,6. The identification of those who are more likely to suffer mentally
enables more targeted assistance from caregivers and policymakers, especially given the limited resources
relative to the scale of the pandemic 1,3.
One of the countries most affected by Covid-19 is Iran7. When we started our survey on March 28, 2020, Iran
had one of the highest national counts of Covid-19 confirmed cases (35,408) and deaths (2717), and a mortality
rate of 7.6%, as reported by the Iranian government. The figures reported by BBC Persian for Iran, however,
were much higher. The Covid-19 outbreak in Iran has been compounded by the ongoing decade-long US-led
sanctions on Iran. A Lancet correspondence noted that “all aspects of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are
directly and indirectly hampered, and the country (Iran) is falling short in combating the crisis. Lack of medical,
pharmaceutical, and laboratory equipment such as protective gowns and necessary medication has been scaling
up the burden of the epidemic and the number of casualties”7 . We provide the first empirical evidence on
Iranian adults’ level of distress and identify several predictors of their distress under the Covid-19 pandemic to
enable early screening for targeting mental health services online.

Methods
We surveyed Iranian adults aged 18 and above March 25–28, 2020. On those four days, there were 27,017,
29,406, 32,332 and 35,408 total confirmed cases and 2077, 2234, 2378 and 2517 deaths respectively in Iran.
The situation was dire. For instance, on March 27, Iranian media reported that about 300 people died due
to methanol poisoning in a desperate hope that drinking alcohol kills the virus, even though the Islamic state of
Iran forbids the sale of alcohol for drinking. On March 28, prisoners in several prisons were distressed enough
that they clashed with guards, set prisons on fire, and somehow escaped.
Given the dire situation in Iran and the lockdown to contain the virus, we delivered the survey online across all
30 provinces in Iran. The survey got the ethics approval (#20200304) at Tsinghua University. We promised the
respondents confidentiality and anonymity of their responses.
Participants answered the survey on their gender, age bracket, education level, number of children, whether they
had Covid-19, exercise hours per day in the past week, working situation (work from home; work in office, etc.),
employment status (employed, unemployed, studying, and retired) and the Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress
Index (CPDI)5. CPDI is an index of 24 questions designed to capture the frequency of specific phobias and
stress disorders relevant to Covid-19, including anxiety, depression, specific phobias, cognitive change,
avoidance and compulsive behavior, physical symptoms and loss of social functioning5. CPDI ranges from 0 to
100. CPDI was originally developed in Chinese, and we had the index translated from its English version to
Persian. The English and Persian versions of CPDI, as well as its scoring key can be found in the appendix.

Results
Our online survey received 1058 responses from all 30 provinces in Iran. Table 1 contains the descriptive
characteristics of the participants. Of the participants, 53.8% were female, 869 (82.1%) reported being free from
the disease, 7 (0.07%) reported having Covid-19, and 182 (17.2%) were unsure of their disease status. In the
past week, 30.0%, 4.3% and 1.1% of the participants exercised on average 1, 2 and 3 hours per day respectively,
62.9% of them did not exercise in the past week, and the remaining 1.3% exercised 4 hours or more per day. By
employment status, 71.5% were employed, 13.2% were unemployed, 10.5% were studying, and the rest 4.7%
were retired. By working situations, 38.6% were working/studying from home, 26.6% were not
working/studying due to the outbreak, 18.0% were not working/studying before and during the outbreak, and
16.9% still worked in an office.

The participants reported their distress level in the past week using CPDI, which had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.91.
The mean (SD) score of CPDI in the sample was 34.54 (14.92), higher than the CPDI of 23.65 (15.45) reported
in China from January 31 to February 10, 20205. The difference in the mean values between Iranian and Chinese
samples is 10.9 (t=22.7; p<0.0001; 95% CI: 10.0 to 11.8). Based on the cut-off values of distress in CPDI,
respectively 47.0% and 14.1% of the Iranian adults experienced mild to moderate and severe psychological
distress, compared to 29.3% and 5.1% respectively in the Chinese sample 5.

To analyze the identifiers (predictors) of CPDI, we used least square regression with the statistical significance
of p<0.05 (Table 1 reports the regression coefficient, p-value, and the lower and upper 95% C.I.). Females
experienced more distress than males (β=-3.62, p=0.000, 95% CI -5.61 to -1.63), similar to prior findings from
China5. Participants’ age (β=0.81, p=0.170, 95% CI -0.35 to 1.98) and education level (β=0.37, p=0.286, 95%
CI -0.31 to 1.05) did not predict distress as they did in the Chinese sample3. Adults with more children felt less
distress (β=-1.07, p=0.048, 95% CI -2.14 to -0.01). Adults who were unsure whether they had Covid-19
reported higher distress than those who reported being free from the disease (β=-8.91, p=0.000, 95% CI -11.26
to -6.57). There is no significant difference between those who reported having the disease and the rest, possibly
due to the very small number (7) of confirmed Covid-19 cases in our sample. Adults who exercised more
reported lower distress (β=-2.14, p=0.000, 95% CI -3.23 to -1.06). Adults who were not working due to the
Covid-19 pandemic reported higher distress than those who worked from home (β=-2.87, p=0.012, 95% CI 5.11 to -0.63), at the office (β=-2.63, p=0.059, 95% CI -5.36 to 0.10), or who were not working even before
Covid-19 (β=-3.44, p=0.023, 95% CI -6.42 to -0.47). The unemployed reported higher distress than the
employed (β=-3.89, p=0.020, 95% CI -7.17 to -0.60) and students (β=-5.29, p=0.020, 95% CI -9.74 to -0.85).
There is no significant difference in distress between the retired and the rest of the sample.

Discussion
Although Covid-19 is expected to wreak havoc on the mental health of the public1–3, there is little evidence of it,
especially outside of China. Our findings show that Iranian adults experienced significantly more distress (mean
CPDI=34.5) than Chinese adults (mean CPDI=23.7). In late March 2020, a staggering 47.0% and 14.1% of
Iranians in our sample reported mild to moderate and severe distress – also more severe than in China5.
Our findings suggest that the predictors of distress are likely to vary across countries. While gender and exercise
hours predicted distress in both Iran and China3,5, age and education predicted distress in China but not in Iran5.
It is worth noting another study also found age was not a significant predictor of distress among working adults
in China during Covid-193. Moreover, Iranian adults who worked from home, at the office, or had not worked
during and before Covid-19 all reported lower distress that those who were not working due to the Covid-19
pandemic. In comparison, in China, only individuals who worked at an office reported significantly lower
distress than those who were not working due to Covid-193.
The differences in the predictors of distress during the Covid-19 pandemic across Iran and China are
understandable, as different countries vary in their medical systems, the availability of personal protective
equipment (PPE), cultures, labor and employment conditions, the policies of lockdown, the ease of working
from home and maintaining a living in a pandemic, and the information in both mainstream and social media, to

name just a few. The results therefore suggest we need to identify useful predictors of mental health in
individual countries during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Lastly, individuals who were unsure whether they had Covid-19 reported higher distress than individuals who
reported not having the disease, suggesting we need to pay attention to those individuals who might be anxious
without knowing their specific Covid-19 status, as people can be asymptomatic or take time to develop
symptoms. One solution is to test such individuals if conditions permit, as otherwise these individuals can
experience high distress.
The study has certain limitations. First, we conducted this study using an observational cross-sectional survey,
so our findings are predictive instead of causal. Second, our sample is not nationally representative, as our focus
was to identify for policymakers and potential caregivers who in the population might need more help. Third,
even though our sample contained adults who reported having Covid-19, the number of infected cases in our
sample is too small, and moreover we suspect they would belong to the majority of Covid-19 infected cases that
have mild symptoms, as people with more severe symptoms would not be able to answer our survey. Lastly, the
scale has been translated from the Chinese version, which was newly developed in China during Covid-19, and
further validation studies are needed on the scale.
In sum, this paper provides the first empirical evidence of the level of distress of Iranian adults during the
Covid-19 pandemic. The results suggest adults in Iran are experiencing more distress than adults in China, with
level of distress predicted by different factors, suggesting future research needs to examine mental health and
the predictors in individual countries to effectively identify and screen those who are more susceptible to mental
health issues during the Covid-19 pandemic.
