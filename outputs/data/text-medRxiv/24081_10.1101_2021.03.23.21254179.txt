Introduction

38

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has put indoor environments in the

39

spotlight since they are where virus transmission predominately occurs [1–4]. Indeed, insufficient

40

ventilation in highly crowded environments such as restaurants, schools, and gyms does not allow

41

proper dilution of virus-laden respiratory particles emitted by infected subjects, leading to a high

42

percentage of secondary infections amongst exposed susceptibles [2,5–8]. To this end, governments

43

worldwide have imposed temporary shutdowns of most indoor environments, including schools [9–

44

14], being in the difficult role of deciding whether to prioritize the right to education or to health. After

45

the first pandemic wave (early 2020), guidelines for reopening schools were prepared and adopted in

46

view of opening the schools in the late (northern hemisphere) summer, but they mainly relied upon

47

promoting

48

distancing, hand washing hand, wearing masks) that address close contact transmission [15], which is

49

a minor route of transmission in indoor environments if a social distance in guaranteed [16,17]. The

50

limited effect of such measures was confirmed by a resurgence of the virus in late 2020 that caused

The provision of a proper ventilation rate certainly cannot be taken for granted since most of the

59

schools worldwide rely upon natural ventilation and manual airing (e.g. 86% of the European school

60

buildings investigated within the SINPHONIE project [26,27]). For such schools, a potential approach

providing real-time information on the virus concentration indoors then suggesting to apply manual

63

ventilation procedures accordingly. Exhaled CO 2 has been proposed as a possible proxy for virus

64

transmission indoors as it is a commonly used indicator of the ventilation rate

65

indoor air quality [28–30]. While in principle exhaled CO 2 could be a good proxy for indoor-generated

66

gaseous pollutants (e.g. VOCs, radon) [31], it cannot predict behaviors and dynamics of virus-laden

67

particles which are affected by phenomena typical of all airborne particles such as deposition, and

68

filtration (if any) in addition to virus inactivation. As such, the best application of exhaled CO 2 is

69

estimating the air exchange rate of confined spaces [32,33]. Indeed, if the particle deposition rate and

70

virus inactivation rate are known, the indoor virus concentration is just affected by the air exchange

71

rate; with this in mind, exhaled CO2 can predict the virus spreading in indoor environments and CO 2

72

sensors can represent a marker of the corresponding infection risk [24,29,34,35]. Nonetheless, at this

In the present paper we evaluated the required air exchange rates for mechanically-ventilated schools

79

and adequate airing procedures for naturally-ventilated schools to reduce the transmission potential

The individual risk of infection and the event reproduction number of a disease due to the airborne

transmission route of the virus were assessed considering a high-school classroom (e.g. students aged

17-18) with a floor area of 50 m2 and a height of 3 m (V=150 m3). A crowding index suggested by the

176

standard EN 15251 [48] on the design of the ventilation for a proper indoor air quality (2 m2 person-1)

177

was adopted then obtaining a total number of occupants (including the teacher) of 25 persons. A total

178

school-time of 5 hours was considered. The simulations were performed considering one infected

179

subject (I=1), the teacher or one of the students, and 24 exposed susceptibles (S=24) hypothesizing

that none of them is already immune (e.g. vaccinated). Therefore, in order to obtain a Revent < 1, the

than 1/24, i.e. < 4.2%.

189

of the susceptible persons), or (b) the infected student attending lessons, then just breathing, and/or

Required air exchange rates and airing procedures

222

The required air exchange rate to maintain a Revent < 1 in mechanically-ventilated schools for the

223

abovementioned scenarios was calculated adopting the methodology described in section 2.1 and,

224

especially, the eq. 1-5. Quanta emission rates were selected from Table 2 on the basis of the activity of

225

the emitting subject (Table 1), the geometry of the classroom were reported in the section 2.3, the

226

virus inactivation rate (λ) for SARS-CoV-2 (0.63 h-1) [53] and seasonal influenza (0.80 h-1) [54] as well

227

as the particle deposition rate (k=0.24 h-1) [55] were obtained from the scientific literature and are

228

summarized in Table 2. Having set these data, the individual risk of infection and, consequently, the

229

event reproduction number, were just affected by the air exchange rate and the airing procedure of the

230

classroom.

231

Quantifying the air exchange rate for mechanical ventilation systems is straightforward, as the fresh

232

air ventilation rate can be easily measured in most cases, and should be consistent with the original

233

design parameters of the system (assuming proper installation and routine maintenance).

237

mechanical ventilation systems which are able to provide constant air exchange rate, the manual

where AERNV and AERMA are the air exchange rates with window close (natural ventilation, NV) and

248

the windows were kept closed and open, respectively; the sum of tNV and tMA clearly is the overall

249

school time (i.e. 300 min). Since the air exchange rate is not constant all over the school day, the time

250

at which the airing is adopted can significantly affect the quanta concentration trends. In fact, if a high

251

quanta emission occurs when the windows are closed, the susceptibles could be exposed to high

252

quanta concentrations then leading to a dose of quanta (and then an individual risk) larger than

253

expected for a constant air exchange rate. In other words, for a certain exposure scenario, even when a

254

school-day average AER provided with manual airing cycles is equal to the mechanical ventilation one,

255

higher dose of quanta and individual risk can happen. Thus, in the case of manual airing cycles, higher

average air exchange rates are needed to maintain a Revent < 1 with respect to classrooms equipped

262

Modeling air exchange rates from natural ventilation is extremely complex as leakages of the building

263

(AERNV) and to the airing (AERMA) are strongly influenced by the airtightness of the building and of the

Required air exchange rates for mechanically-ventilated schools

Figure 1 presents the trends of quanta concentration, individual risk, Maximum Room Occupancy, and

275

indoor CO2 concentration for the scenarios T-60-LS (teacher giving lesson loudly speaking for the first

276

60 min of the school-day) and T-60-S (i.e. speaking using a microphone instead of loudly speaking) in

277

the case of SARS-CoV-2 virus when required AERs (to maintain a Revent < 1) are provided through

278

mechanical ventilation systems. In particular, for the scenario T-60-LS, as summarized in Table 3, the

272

279

required AER is 9.5 h-1 (i.e. > 15 L s-1 person-1). The quanta concentration trend increases sharply in

280

the first 60 min (i.e. when the virus source is still in the classroom), then exponentially decays as soon

281

as the teacher leaves the room and goes to zero at about 90 min. The individual risk reaches the

282

maximum permitted value (4.2%) at 90 min, then remaining constant up to the end of the school-day

283

(300

284

designed, the maximum occupancy decreases to the needed value of 24 persons at the end of the

285

school-day. The authors point out that in the scenario T-60-LS the whole dose of quanta (and then

286

individual risk) is received by the susceptibles in roughly 90 minutes, thus, we would have designed

287

the same air exchange rate also in the hypothesis that the infected teacher gave a lesson at the second,

288

third or fourth hour. Due to the high (and constant) AER = 9.5 h-1, the CO 2 indoor reaches the (very

289

low) equilibrium concentration of approximately 750 ppm in about half an hour.

290

For the scenario T-60-S, a much lower AER (0.8 h-1; i.e. 1.3 L s-1 person-1) is required to maintain a

291

Revent < 1,

294

In Table 3 the required AERs to maintain a Revent < 1 for all the investigated scenarios are reported for

295

SARS-CoV-2 for mechanically-ventilated classrooms; the required AER for seasonal influenza-infected

296

subjects is not reported since it is < 0.1 h-1 for all the scenarios under investigation. Thus, all the

297

ventilation techniques are able to protect against the spreading of the seasonal influenza virus in

299

required AERs can be quite high: as mentioned above, for a teacher giving lesson for one hour the

300

required AER is 9.5 h-1. Such AER can be reduced adopting shorter lessons (e.g. for 40-min lessons it

301

can decrease down to 6.1 h-1)

302

speaking (e.g. using microphones, this would require just 0.8 h-1) and simultaneously wearing masks

(then lowering the required AER down to 0.2 h-1). If the infected subject is a student, an AER of 0.8 h-1

304

is needed if she/he does not speak for the entire school-day, then increasing for longer speaking

periods (e.g. 3.5 h-1 are required if she/he speaks for 40% of the school-day).

In the case of school without mechanical ventilation, maintaining a Revent < 1 is a challenge forr
scenarios characterized by high emitting infected subjects for two main reasons: i) keeping the

windows opened for long periods could be detrimental for thermal comfort and energy conservation

S, a Revent < 1 (i.e. R = 4.2%) could be obtained opening the windows for about 10 min at the end of

each hour. The resulting school-day average AER would be equal to of 0.8 h-1, which similar to that
needed in case of constant mechanical ventilation systems. But, for lower AERs, e.g. constant AERNV

and AERMA equal to 0.15 and 2.0 h-1, respectively, the required opening period at the end of each hour

394

is 36 min then resulting in a school-day average AER of 1.3 h-1 which is significantly higher than that

395

required in the case of steady state mechanical ventilation system. These two easy examples, highlight

396

that the lower the AERNV and AERMA values, the longer the required airing period and, consequently,

397

the higher the resulting school-day average AER.

398

Thus, the airing strategies are strongly affected by the air exchange rate values, therefore adopting

399

scheduled airing procedures could be misleading. In October 2020 the German Environment Agency

400

(UBA) issued guidance for schools recommending airing classrooms for 5 minutes after every 20

401

minutes (www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/press/pressinformation/coronavirus-protection-in-schools-

402

airing-rooms-for). For the T-60-S scenario, in the likely hypothesis of having AERNV at least equal to

403

0.2 h-1, adopting the German procedure would allow maintaining a Revent < 1 only for AERMA > 3.3 h-1;

404

however, such an air exchange rate during manual airing could be not reached.

405

The above-mentioned examples highlight how AERNV and AERMA need to be continuously monitored so

406

that the airing procedure can be adjusted in real-time. This procedure is obviously more complex than

407

providing mechanical ventilation, and the support of control unit is even more important as it should

408

be able to communicate with a CO2 sensor and provide visual alerts on when opening and closing the

409

windows, which will be performed manually by personnel in the classroom (e.g. teacher).

410

Alternatively, since it may be challenging to

411

window in response to frequent prompts from the control unit, for relatively minor incremental cost

412

one or more windows in the room could be fitted with a motorized louver, or damper, connected to

413

the control unit such that the percent open of the window can be automatically adjusted by the system.

414

Anyway, whatever the windows are automatically or manually opened, the ventilation procedure is

415

equivalent and provided by the control unit. Indeed, data regarding the expected scenario will be

416

provided to the control unit (through the user input screen as well), then the control unit will evaluate

417

and suggest the manual airing procedure to be adopted in order to guarantee a Revent < 1. In particular,

418

the control unit will use as feedback information the indoor CO2 concentration continuously measured

419

by an in-room sensor and, on the basis of the number of persons and their activity levels (that will be

420

provided through the user input screen) and of the initial indoor CO2 concentration, it will back-

422

the CO2 mass balance equation (eq. 7) (Figure 4). Such calculation should be performed adopting a

423

multi-points method, i.e. finding the best regression fit to the continuous CO 2 data, which is more

424

accurate than the two-points method (i.e. considering just the CO2 measurement of start point and end

425

point of natural ventilation and manual airing periods) [66] since it will be less affected by CO2 sensor

426

accuracy and intermittent "noisy" measurements. On the basis of the actual AERs the corrected tMA and

427

At the end of the second cycle AERNV and AERMA will be back-calculated again and, in case, the opening

445

and closing periods will be modified again. Indeed, a high variability of the air exchange rate with

446

windows open could occur, thus, significant corrections may be needed.

451

An example application of the correction procedure is presented in Figure 5 for the scenario T-60-S. In

452

the figure the indoor CO2 concentration, SARS-CoV-2 quanta concentration, and individual risk trend

453

are presented. During the first hour a tentative airing cycle made up of 50 min with windows closed

454

and 10 min with windows open was adopted. From the CO2 trend, the actual AERNV and AERMA values

455

were back-calculated and (in this illustrative example) are equal to 0.15 and 2.0 h-1, respectively. On

456

the basis of the actual AERs, in order to maintain a Revent < 1 (i.e. R = 4.2%), the control unit schedules

457

equally-spaced window opening periods of 42 min for the remaining four hours to be applied at the

458

end of each hour. Thus, the total times during which the windows were kept closed and open for the

459

entire school day are tNV = 122 min and tMA = 178 min (having included the 50 min and 10 min of

460

window closing and opening periods of the first hour) then resulting in a school-day average AER of

461

about 1.3 h-1. The tentative opening and closing periods adopted for the first hour were then too short

462

compared to the actual low AERs, for this reason the quanta concentration in the first hour increases

463

significantly and the individual risk trend as well with respect to the same scenario occurring in a

Applicability and limitation of the methodology for ventilation control

477

3.3

478

The methodology presented in the paper addresses the proposed goals of (i) quantifying the required

479

ventilation (provided through mechanical systems or manual airing) to reduce the spread of infectious

480

diseases via the airborne route and (ii) proposing a suitable feedback control strategy to monitor and

481

adjust such ventilation in naturally-ventilated classrooms. Nonetheless, in order to effectively reduce

482

the transmission potential of a disease, the uncertainty of the event reproduction number (Revent)

483

should be taken into account such that, the required air exchange rate maintains (Revent -

487

following data are needed: quanta emission rate (ERq), deposition rate (k), inactivation

488

inhalation rate (IR), room volume (V), air exchange rate (AER), time of exposure (T). The quanta

489

emission rate was investigated in our previous papers where we highlighted that uncertainty relates

490

to the quality of data on viral load, infectious dose and particle volume: such data, at least for SARS-

491

CoV-2, are not definitive [44,51,67] also due to the presence of different viral lineages [68]. Therefore,

rate (λ),

492

even if the ERq data provided by our model are much more suitable than those typically estimated

493

based on retrospective assessments of infectious outbreaks, a not negligible uncertainty exists. The

494

deposition rate is mainly affected by the particle size [55] and, thus, adopting an average parameter, as

495

typical of easy-to-use box-models, results in additional uncertainty as well; similarly, data on the virus

496

inactivation rate for SARS-CoV-2 are still limited [53,69]. The inhalation rate depends on the activity

497

levels of the subject; different scientific papers [42,70] reported different IR values for the same

498

activity then confirming a significant variability as well. Room volume and time of exposure can be

499

considered as fixed values (or at least with a not significant uncertainty contribution) as well as the

500

AER if provided through a mechanical ventilation system. The uncertainty budget should also include

Conclusions

523

The study provides a method to support regulatory authorities in the safe operation of schools in the

524

time of pandemics. To this end the required ventilation to reduce the spread of infectious diseases via

525

the airborne route was assessed for both mechanically-and naturally-ventilated classrooms through

526

virus mass balance equations. For the latter, which represent the more frequent and also the more

527

challenging situation, a suitable feedback control strategy based on exhaled CO2 monitoring was also

528

proposed in view of maintaining a limited transmission potential of the disease.

529

The scenarios simulated revealed that adopting a CO2 concentration threshold as a possible proxy for

530

virus transmission can be misrepresentative. Indeed, the dynamics of the virus-laden particles and the

531

occurrence of the virus emission may strongly differ from the exhaled CO2 ones, thus, CO2 and virus

532

concentrations (expressed as “quanta” concentrations) may present significantly different trends.

533

Seasonal influenza presents a negligible transmission potential via airborne route in classroom, even

534

when low ventilation is provided; this is due to the low emission rates typical of such virus. On the

535

contrary, the required air exchange rates to guarantee a Revent < 1 for SARS-CoV-2 can be very high for

536

scenarios characterized by highly-emitting infected subjects, such as teacher loudly speaking. Such

537

AERs could be even higher than those suggested by the indoor air quality technical standards, thus,

538

mitigation solutions (e.g. voice modulation in particular) or adequate immunization coverage (i.e. high

539

vaccination percentage) are welcomed.

540

In order to reduce the virus transmission potential,

classroom geometry, etc.), a control unit can calculate the required air exchange rate accordingly and

544

set the corresponding constant fresh flow rate of the mechanical ventilation system. Such a scenario

545

can be established as a selectable mode of operation for the control unit.

546

For naturally-ventilated classrooms a suitable feedback control strategy was included and applied in

547

the method. In these classrooms, manual airing cycles help increase the air exchange rate but, due to
