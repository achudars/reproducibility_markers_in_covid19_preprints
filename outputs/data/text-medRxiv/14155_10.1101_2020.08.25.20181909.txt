ICU Outcomes and Survival in Patients with Severe COVID-19 in the Largest Health Care
System in Central Florida
Abstract
Background
Observational studies have consistently described poor clinical outcomes and increased ICU
mortality in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who require mechanical
ventilation (MV). Our study describes the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with
severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU in the largest health care system in the state of Florida, United
States.
Methods
Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to ICU due to severe COVID-19 in AdventHealth
health system in Orlando, Florida from March 11th until May 18th, 2020. Patients were
characterized based on demographics, baseline comorbidities, severity of illness, medical
management including experimental therapies, laboratory markers and ventilator parameters.
Major clinical outcomes analyzed at the end of the study period were: hospital and ICU length of
stay, MV-related mortality and overall hospital mortality of ICU patients.
Results
Out of total of 1283 patients with COVID-19, 131 (10.2%) met criteria for ICU admission (median
age: 61 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 49.5-71.5]; 35.1% female). Common comorbidities were
hypertension (84; 64.1%), and diabetes (54; 41.2%). Of the 131 ICU patients, 109 (83.2%)
required MV and 9 (6.9%) received ECMO. Lower positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) were
observed in survivors [9.2 (7.7-10.4)] vs non-survivors [10 (9.1-12.9] p= 0.004]. Compared to nonsurvivors, survivors had a longer MV length of stay (LOS) [14 (IQR 8-22) vs 8.5 (IQR 5-10.8) p<
0.001], Hospital LOS [21 (IQR 13-31) vs 10 (7-1) p< 0.001] and ICU LOS [14 (IQR 7-24) vs 9.5
(IQR 6-11), p < 0.001]. The overall hospital mortality and MV-related mortality were 19.8% and
23.8% respectively. After exclusion of hospitalized patients, the hospital and MV-related mortality
rates were 21.6% and 26.5% respectively.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrates an important improvement in mortality of patients with severe COVID-19
who required ICU admission and MV in comparison to previous observational reports and
emphasize the importance of standard of care measures in the management of COVID-19.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have affected over 7 million of people around the world
since December 2019 [1] and in the United States has resulted so far in more than 100,000 deaths
[2]. Epidemiological studies have shown that 6 to 10% of patients develop a more severe form of
COVID-19 and will require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute hypoxemic
respiratory failure [3]. Most of these patients admitted to ICU, will finally require invasive
mechanical ventilation (MV) due to diffuse lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS). Until now, most of the ICU reports from United States have shown that severe COVID19-associated ARDS (CARDS) is associated with prolonged MV and increased mortality [4]. In
fact, retrospective and prospective case series from China and Italy have provided insight about
the clinical course of severely ill patients with CARDS in which it demonstrates that
extrapulmonary complications are also a strong contributor for poor outcomes [5,6]. In United
States, population dense areas such as New York City, Seattle and Los Angeles have had the
highest rates of infection resulting in significant overload to hospitals and ICU systems [2,7,8].
However, tourist destinations and areas with a large elderly population like the state of Florida
pose a remaining concern for increasing infection rates that may lead to high national mortality.
Mortality rates reported in patients with severe COVID-19 in the ICU range from 50-65% [7, 8,
9]. In patients requiring MV, mortality rates have been reported to be as high as 97% [10].
Regional experiences in the management of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 have
varied between cities and countries, and recent reports suggest a lower mortality rate [11]. The
regional and institutional variations in ICU outcomes and overall mortality are not clearly
understood yet and are not related to the use experimental therapies, given the fact that recent
reports with the use remdesivir [12], hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin [13], lopinavir-ritonavir [14]
and convalescent plasma [15,16] have been inconsistent in terms of mortality reduction and
improvement of ICU outcomes. Therefore, the poor ICU outcomes and high mortality rate
observed during CARDS have raised concerns about the strategies of mechanical ventilation and
the success in delivering standard of care measures.
Our observational study is so far the first and largest in the state of Florida to describe the
demographics, baseline characteristics, medical management and clinical outcomes observed in
patients with CARDS admitted to ICU in a multihospital health care system.

Patient and Methods
Retrospective cohort study conducted at AdventHealth Central Florida Division (AHCFD), the
largest health system in central Florida. AHCFD is comprised of 9 hospitals with a total of 2885
beds servicing the 8 million residents of Orange County and surrounding regions. All patients with
COVID-19 who met criteria for critical care admission from AdventHealth hospitals were
transferred and managed at AdventHealth Orlando, a 1368-bed hospital with 170 ICU beds and
dedicated inhouse 24/7 intensivist coverage. This study was approved by the institutional review
board of AHCFD. All critical care admissions from March 11 to May 18, 2020 presenting to any
one of the 9 AHCFD hospitals were included. All consecutive critically ill patients had confirmed
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive result on
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of a nasopharyngeal sample or tracheal aspirate. Due
to some of the documented shortcomings of PCR testing early in this pandemic, some patients
required more than one test to document positivity. Clinical outcomes of the included population
were monitored until May 27, 2020, the final date of study follow-up. All critically ill COVID-19
patients were assigned in 2 ICUs with a total capacity of 80 beds. Patients not requiring ICU level
care were admitted to a specially dedicated isolation unit at each AHCFD hospital. Standardized
respiratory care was implemented favoring intubation and MV over non-invasive positive pressure
ventilation. The ICUs employed dedicated respiratory therapists, with extensive training in the
care of patients with ARDS.
We considered the following criteria to admit patients to ICU: 1) Oxygen saturation (O2 sat)
less than 93% on more than 6 liters oxygen (O2) via nasal cannula (NC) or PO2 < 65 mmHg with
6 liters or more O2, or respiratory rate (RR) more than 22 per minute on 6 liters O2, 2) PO2/FIO2
ratio less than 300, 3) any patient with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 already on requiring
MV or with previous criteria. We accomplished strict protocol adherence for low tidal volume
ventilation targeting a plateau pressure goal of less than 30 cmH2O and a driving pressure of less
than 15 cmH2O. We followed ARDS network low PEEP, high FiO2 table in the majority of our
cases [17]. Those patients requiring mechanical ventilation were supervised by board-certified
critical care physicians (intensivists). Intensivist were not responsible for more than 20 patients
per 12 hours shift. Nursing did not exceed ratios of one nurse to two patients. Early paralysis and
prone positioning were achieved with the assistance of a dedicated prone team. Prone Positioning
techniques were consistent with the PROSEVA trial recommendations [18]. The 30 ml/kg
crystalloid resuscitation recommendation was applied for those patients presenting with evidence
of septic shock and fluid resuscitation was closely monitored to minimize overhydration [19].
Based on recent reports showing hypercoagulable state and increased risk of thrombosis in

patients with COVID-19, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis was initiated by following an
institutional algorithm that employed D-dimer levels and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM)
to determine the risk of thrombosis [20]. Prophylactic anticoagulation ranged from unfractionated
heparin at 5000 units subcutaneously (SC) every eight hours or enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg SC daily
to full anticoagulation with either an unfractionated heparin infusion or enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC
twice daily.
A selected number of patients received remdesivir as part of the expanded access or
compassionate use programs, as well as through the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) supply
distributed by the Florida Department of Health. Patients were also enrolled in institutional review
board (IRB) approved studies for convalescent plasma and other COVID-19 investigational
treatments.
Data were collected from the enterprise electronic health record (Cerner; Cerner Corp. Kansas
City, MO) reporting database, and all analyses were performed using version 3.6.3 of the R
programming language (R Project for Statistical Computing; R Foundation). Patients were
considered to have confirmed infection if the initial or repeat test results were positive. Repeat
tests were performed after an initial negative test by obtaining a lower respiratory sample if there
was a high clinical pretest probability of COVID-19. Transfers between system hospitals were
considered a single visit.
Data collected included patient demographic information, comorbidities, triage vitals, initial
laboratory tests, inpatient medications, treatments (including invasive mechanical ventilation and
renal replacement therapy), and outcomes (including length of stay, discharge, readmission, and
mortality). All clinical outcomes are presented for patients who were admitted to the cohort ICU
during the study period (discharged alive, remained in the hospital or dead). Clinical outcomes
available at the study end point are presented, including invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU
care, renal replacement therapy, and hospital length of stay. Race data were self-reported within
prespecified fixed categories. Initial laboratory testing was defined as the first test results
available, typically within 24 hours of admission. For initial laboratory testing and clinical studies
for which not all patients had values, percentages of total patients with completed tests are shown.
The scores APACHE IVB, MEWS, and SOFA scores were computed to determine the severity of
illness and data for these scoring was provided by the electronic health records. The. predicted
hospital mortalities were calculated using the equations of APACHE IVB utilizing principal
diagnosis of viral and bacterial pneumonia [21].
Patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared based on survival status of
COVID-19 positive patients. Categorical fields are displayed as percentages and continuous fields

Results
During March 11 to May 18, a total of 1283 COVID-19 positive patients were evaluated in the
Emergency Department or ambulatory care centers of AHCFD. Out of 1283, 429 (33.4%) were
admitted to AHCFD hospitals, of which 131 (30.5%) were admitted to the AdventHealth Orlando
COVID-19 ICU. This result suggests a 10.2% (131/1283) rate of ICU admission (Figure 1 – Study
Diagram).
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of patients are summarized in Table 1 and
Table 2 respectively. The median age of the patients admitted to the ICU was 61 (IQR 49.5-71.5).
Deceased patients were older with a median age of 71.5 (IQR 62-80, p <0.001). A majority of
patients were male (64.9%), 15 (11%) were black, and the majority of patients were classified as
white and other (116, 88.5%). Hypertension was the most common co-morbid condition (84 pts,
64%), followed by diabetes (54, 41%) and coronary artery disease (21, 16%). Evidence of heart
failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia were associated with non-survivors. Obesity
(BMI 30-39.9) was observed in 50 patients (38.2%), and 7 (5.3%) patients had a BMI of 40 or
greater. Approximately half of the study population had commercial insurance (67, 51%) followed
by Medicare (40, 30.5%), Medicaid (12, 9.2%) and uninsured (12, 9.2%). Initial presentation with
Oxygen (O2) saturation < 90% (p= 0.006), respiratory rate > 22 (p= 0.003) and systolic blood
pressure < 90mmhg (p= 0.008) were more commonly present in non-survivors.
Risk adjusted severity (SOFA, MEWS, APACHE IVB) scores were significantly higher in nonsurvivors (p< 0.003). Median C-reactive protein on hospital admission was 115 mg/L (IQR 59.3186.3; upper limit of normal 5 mg/L), median Ferritin was 848 ng/ml (IQR 441-1541); upper limit
of normal 336 ng/ml), D-dimer was 1.4 ug/mL (IQR 0.8-3.2; upper limit of normal 0.8 ug/mL), and
IL-6 level was 18 pg/mL (IQR 7-46.5; upper limit of normal 2 pg/mL). No significant differences in
the laboratory and inflammatory markers were observed between survivors and non-survivors.
ICU specific management and interventions including experimental therapies and hospital as
well as ICU length of stay (LOS) are described in table 3. There were 109 patients (83%) who
received MV. Compared to non-survivors, survivors had a longer time on the ventilator [14 (IQR
8-22) versus 8.5(IQR 5-10.8) p< 0.001], Hospital LOS [21 (IQR 13-31) versus 10 (7-1) p< 0.001]
and ICU LOS [14 (IQR 7-24) versus 9.5 (IQR 6-11), p < 0.001]. Prone positioning was performed
in 46.8% of the study subjects and 77% of the mechanically ventilated patients received
neuromuscular blockade to improve hypoxemia and ventilator synchrony. Average PaO2/FiO2
during hospitalization was lower in non-survivors [167 (IQR 132.7-194.1)] versus survivors [202
(IQR 181.8-234.4)] p< 0.001. Lower positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) averages were

observed in survivors [9.2 (7.7-10.4)] vs non-survivors [10 (9.1-12.9] p= 0.004]. Median Driving
pressure were similar between the two groups (12.7 [10.8-15.1)].
Vasopressors were required in 72.5% of the ICU patients (non-survivors 92.3% versus survivors
67.6%, p= 0.023). Renal replacement therapy was required in 24 (18%), out of which 15 patients
(57.7%) expired. Only 9 of 131 ICU patients, received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(ECMO), with most of them surviving (8, 88%). Of these 9 patients, 8 were treated with venovenous ECMO (survival 7 of 8) and one with veno-arterial-venous ECMO (survival 1 of 1).
The majority of patients (N=123, 93.9%) received a combination of azithromycin and
hydroxychloroquine. Tocilizumab was utilized in 56 (43.7%), and 37 (28.2%) were enrolled in
blinded placebo-controlled studies aimed at the inflammatory cascade. Convalescent plasma
was administered in 49 (37.4%) patients. A total of 14 (10.7%) received remdesivir via expanded
access or compassionate use programs, as well as through the Emergency Use Authorization
(EUA) supply distributed by the Florida Department of Health. Full anticoagulation was given to
48 (N=131, 36.6%) of the patients and 77 (N=131, 58.8%) received high dose corticosteroids
(methylprednisolone 40mg every 8 hours for 7 days or dexamethasone 20 mg every day for 5
days followed by 10 mg every day for 5 days). Of the 109 patients requiring mechanical ventilation,
61 (55%) received the previously mentioned dose of methylprednisolone or dexamethasone.
Although our study was not designed to assess the effectiveness of any of the above medications,
no significant differences between survivors and non-survivors were observed through bivariate
analysis.
ICU outcomes at the end of study period are described in Table 4. Of the total amount of
patients admitted to ICU (N=131), 80.2% (N=105) remained alive at the end of the study period.
Of those alive patients, 89.5% (N=94) were discharged from the hospital. Of these patients who
were discharged, 60 (45.8%) went home, 32 (24.4%) were discharged to skill nurse facilities and
2 (1.5%) were discharged to other hospitals. During the study period, 26 patients of the total
(N=131) expired (19.8% overall mortality). Excluding those patients who remained hospitalized
(N=11 [8.4% of 131] at the end of study period, adjusted hospital mortality of ICU patients was
21.6%. Higher survival rate was observed in patients younger than 55 years old (p= 0.003) with
the highest mortality rate observed in those patients older than 75 years (p= 0.008). Of the total
ICU patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (N=109 [83.2%]), 26 patients (23.8%)
expired during the study period. When the mechanical ventilation-related mortality was calculated
excluding those patients who remained hospitalized, this rate increased to 26.5%. The APACHE
IVB score-predicted hospital and ventilator mortality was 17% and 21% respectively for patients

with a discharge disposition. Due to lack of risk-adjusted APACHE predictions specifically for
patients with COVID 19-induced acute respiratory failure, we considered acute respiratory failure
secondary to usual viral and/or bacterial pneumonia as the principal diagnoses to determine
expected rates of mortality.

Discussion
Among 429 admissions during the study period, 131 were admitted to our ICU (30.5%). Patients
referred to our center from outside our system included patients to be evaluated for Extracorporeal
Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) and patients who experienced delays in hospital level of care
due to travel on cruise lines. These patients universally required a higher level of care than our
average patient admission and may explain our slightly higher ICU admission rate as compared
to the literature (22-27.4%) [11,22]
Reports of ICU mortality due to COVID-19 around the world and in the Unites States, in
particular, have ranged from 20-62% [7]. In mechanically ventilated patients, mortality has ranged
from 50-97%. Observations from Wuhan have shown mortality rates of approximately 52% in
COVID-19 patients with ARDS [23]. Cohorts in New York have shown a mortality rate in the
mechanically ventilated population as high as 88.1% [4]. Based on these high mortality rates,
there has been speculation that this disease process is different than typical ARDS, suggesting
that standard ARDS mechanical ventilation strategies may not be as effective in reducing lung
injury [24]. However, both our in-hospital and mechanical ventilation mortality rates were
significantly lower than what has been reported in the literature (Table 4). In fact, our data
suggests that COVID-19-induced ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation has a similar if not lower
mortality than what has been previously observed in ARDS due to other infectious etiologies [25].
There are several potential explanations for our study findings. Our lower mortality could be
partially explained by our lower average patient age or higher proportion of Non-African
Americans as some studies have suggested a higher mortality in the African American population
[26]. However, in countries where the majority population were non-black (China, Italy, and other
countries in Europe), a high mortality rate was also observed. Our study population also had a
higher rate of commercial insurance, which may suggest an improved baseline health status
which has been associated with an overall lower all-cause mortality [27]. An additional factor to
be considered is our geographical location: the warmer climate and higher humidity experienced
in central Florida, have been associated with a lower mortality of the disease [28]. It is unclear
whether these or other environmental factors could also be associated with a lower virulence for
COVID-19 in our region.

Other relevant factors that in our opinion are likely to have influenced our outcomes were that
our healthcare delivery system was never overwhelmed. We were allowed time to adapt our
facility infrastructure, recruit and retain proper staffing, cohort all critical ill patients in one
location to enhance staff expertise and minimize variation, secure proper personal protective
equipment, develop proper processes of care, and follow an increasing number of medical
Society best practice recommendations [29]
Overall, we strictly followed standard ARDS and respiratory failure management. Investigational
treatments of uncertain efficacy were utilized when supported by available evidence at the time.
(Table 3). The majority of our patients throughout March and April 2020 received
hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Although the effectiveness and safety of this regimen has
been recently questioned [13]. Our observed mortality does not suggest a detrimental effect of
such treatment. Reported cardiotoxicity associated with this regimen was mitigated by frequent
ECG monitoring and close monitoring of electrolytes. Potential benefit has been described for
remdesivir in reducing the duration of hospital LOS, but it has not been shown to improve patient
survival, especially in the critically ill population [12]. In addition, 43% of our patients received
tocilizumab and 28.2% where enrolled in a blinded clinical trial of investigational drugs targeting
the inflammatory cascade. The theoretical benefit of blocking cytokines, specially interleukin-6
[IL-6], which is one of main mediators of the cytokine release syndrome, has not been shown at
this time to improve mortality or other outcomes [30]. Also, of note, 37.4% of our study population
received convalescent plasma, and larger studies are underway to understand its role in the
treatment of severe COVID-19 [15,31]. Another potential aspect that may have contributed to
reduce our MV-related mortality and overall mortality is the use of steroids. We are reporting that
55% of the patients who required mechanical ventilation received methylprednisolone or
dexamethasone. This specific population and the impact of steroids in respiratory parameters,
ventilator-free days and survival need to be further evaluated. The dose and duration of steroids
were based on the study by Villar J. et al, that showed an improvement in survival in patients with
ARDS after using dexamethasone [34,35]. Interestingly, only 6.9% of our study population was
referred for ECMO, however our ECMO mortality was much lower than previously reported in the
literature (11% compared to 94%) [32,33].
This report has several limitations. This was an observational study conducted at a single health
care system in a confined geographic area thus limiting the generalizability of our results. As with
all observational studies, it is difficult to ascertain causality with ICU therapies as opposed to an
association that existed due to the patients’ clinical conditions. Additionally, when examining

multiple factors associated with survival, potential confounders may remain unidentified without
a multivariate regression analysis. Finally, additional unmeasured factors might have played a
significant role in survival. Despite these limitations, our experience and results challenges
previously reported high mortality rates. In fact, our mortality rates for mechanically ventilated
COVID-19 patients were similar to APACHE IVB predicted mortality, which was based on critically
ill patients admitted with respiratory failure secondary to viral and/or bacterial pneumonia. Our
study demonstrates the possibility of better outcomes for COVID-19 associated with critical
illness, including COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

Conclusion
Our study is the first and the largest in the state Florida and probably one of the most encouraging
in the United States to show lower overall mortality and MV-related mortality in patients with
severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU compared to other previous cases series. Our study does not
support the previously reported overwhelmingly poor outcomes of mechanically ventilated
patients with COVID-19 induced respiratory failure and ARDS. In fact, it is reassuring that the
application of well-established ARDS and mechanical ventilation strategies can be associated
with mortality and outcomes comparable to non-COVID-19 induced sepsis or ARDS.
