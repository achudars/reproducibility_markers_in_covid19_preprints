Abstract
Background To combat the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States, many states and Washington DC
enacted Stay-at-Home order and nonpharmaceutical mitigation interventions. This study examined the
determinants of the timing to implement an intervention. Through an impact analysis, the study explored
the effects of the interventions and the potential risks of removing them under the context of reopening
the economy.
Method A content analysis identified nine types of mitigation interventions and the timing at which
states enacted these strategies. A proportional hazard model, a multiple-event survival model, and a
random-effect spatial error panel model in conjunction with a robust method analyzing zero-inflated and
skewed outcomes were employed in the data analysis.
Findings To our knowledge, we provided in this article the first explicit analysis of the timing,
determinants, and impacts of mitigation interventions for all states and Washington DC in the United
States during the first five weeks of the pandemic. Unlike other studies that evaluate the Stay-at-Home
order by using simulated data, the current study employed the real data of various case counts of Covid19. The study obtained two meritorious findings: (1) states with a higher prevalence of Covid-19 cases per
10,000 population reacted more slowly to the outbreak, suggesting that some states may have missed the
optimal timing to prevent the wide spread of the Covid-19 disease; and (2) of nine mitigation measures,
three (non-essential business closure, large-gathering bans, and restaurant/bar limitations) showed
positive impacts on reducing cumulative cases, new cases, and death rates across states.
Interpretation The opposite direction of the prevalence rate on the timing of issuing the mitigation
interventions partially explains why the Covid-19 caseload in the U.S. remains high. A swift
implementation of social distancing is crucial— the key is not whether such measures should be taken
but when. Because there is no preventive vaccine and because there are few potentially effective
treatments, recent reductions in new cases and deaths must be due, in large part, to the social
interventions delivered by states. The study suggests that the policy of reopening economy needs to be
implemented carefully.

As of May 1, the total confirmed cases of Covid-19 reached 3.4 million
worldwide, causing nearly 240,000 deaths; the U.S. experienced the highest disease
burden, with over 1.1 million confirmed cases (i.e., 33.5% of the world total) and more
than 65,000 deaths (i.e., 27.8% of the world total).1,2 On March 13, 2020, the President of
United States declared a National Emergency to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
Following his declaration, 42 States and Washington DC enacted Stay-at-Home orders,
with California starting the earliest (3 AM 3/19/2020, U.S. Eastern Time) and South
Carolina starting the latest (5 PM on 4/7/2020, U.S. Eastern Time). These orders covered
approximately 94.7% of the U.S. population. Closely related to the Stay-at-Home order
are various nonpharmaceutical containment interventions aiming to promote social
distancing.
Social distancing is an essential component of a public health response to
infectious-disease outbreak. A systematic review of influenza pandemics3 found that by
isolating ill persons, contact tracing, quarantining exposed persons, school closures,
workplace closures, and avoiding crowding, distancing helped reduce transmission,
delay transmission, and reduce epidemic peak.
Covid-19 is a novel coronavirus disease. Compared to influenza and severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS), Covid-19 has a more extended incubation period of 5-6
days, though its doubling time (i.e., the speed of the initial spread of the epidemic) or
the related serial interval (i.e., the mean time it takes for an infected person to pass on
the infection to others) is similar to SARS, which is estimated at 4.4-7.5 days.4 A study in
China found that among cases known to have traveled from Wuhan before January 23,
the time from symptom onset to confirmation was 6.5 days (SD = 4.2 days), and for
those who traveled from Wuhan after January 23 when more active surveillance was in
operation, the interval was reduced to 4.8 days (SD = 3.03 days).5 These data suggest
that, to prevent the spread of Covid-19, policymakers must implement mitigation
strategies – if they choose to do so – in a speedy fashion. In the absence of speedy
implementation, the prevalence is likely to increase rapidly. Therefore, the timing of
enacting mitigation interventions plays a vital role in public health. Given that patients
during the incubation period are asymptomatic, responding to confirmed cases quickly
has the potential to make a significant difference in subsequent disease levels.
The purpose of this study is to undertake a correlational analysis of the
determinants and impacts of U.S. mitigation measures used in the first five weeks of the
pandemic. The study intends to address two research questions. Using an early period
in the pandemic (i.e., from 3/13/2020 to 4/7/2020), one question focuses on the

determinants of the implementation timing of mitigation strategies. Why did some
states in the United States respond rapidly to the pandemic while others did not? Of
various determinants, we are primarily concerned with the prevalence rate of the
confirmed cases vis-à-vis the time when each mitigation strategy was enacted. Delay in
taking intervention actions during this period may directly affect the speed and scope of
the Covid-19 spread.
The second question focuses on the correlations between the timing of enacting
mitigation and the serial incidence of Covid-19 cases and deaths. For this preliminary
assessment of the impact of mitigation interventions, the observational window was
extended to 4/15/2020. The impact study aims to address a key question: Is an initial
response observed? Precisely during this period, many states had begun to reopen their
economies and public life. By May 11, 32 states chose to do so.6 In light of these
decisions, the purpose of this paper is to explore the initial impact of
nonpharmaceutical mitigation interventions in the event that re-opening the economy is
associated with a second wave of Covid-19 disease and a second round of mitigation
becomes necessary.
Methods
Study Window
In this study, we define the enactment of social distancing strategies as the exact
hour at which a mitigation intervention was implemented, as stipulated by state
government documents. The study window is defined as the period from the time
when a National Emergency was declared to the time when the last enacting state
issued a Stay-at-Home order. More precisely, the zero hour for this study is 12 PM
March 13, U.S. Eastern Time, and the ending hour is 6 PM April 7, which is one hour
after the last enacting state (i.e., South Carolina) implemented its Stay-at-Home order (5
PM April 7, U.S. Eastern Time). States declined to issue a mitigation order are
considered censored at 6 PM on April 7, 2020. Within this 25.25-day or 606-hour
window, we study not only whether a state enacted mitigation interventions, but also
the exact times at which these interventions were implemented. The timing of the
National Emergency is a natural starting point for the study because, before that date,
none of the migration strategies was enacted in the United States. A special caveat
should be put on the word “zero”: it does not mean that the Covid-19 pandemic started
at that point, because as Anderson et al. pointed out: “Most countries are likely to have
spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an
impact.”6

Data Source
Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze large quantities of text data
from governmental documents. We examined all relevant documents (a total of 1,470
executive orders) pertinent to the social distancing orders from the state-government
websites for all 50 states and Washington DC. A content-coding/analysis7 was
performed by two researchers. Review and coding guidelines were developed in
advance. The two reviewers separately examined all documents, and resolved
discrepancies in coding by consensus in a discussion. Considering variation across
states in the frequency of use of alternative social distancing strategies and prior
literature on social distancing, we extracted information on 9 types of the mitigation
interventions: Stay-at-Home order, strengthened Stay-at-Home order, public school
closure, all school closure, large-gathering ban of more than 10 people, any gathering
ban, restaurant/bar limit to dining out only, non-essential business closure, and
mandatory self-quarantine of travelers. The exact timing to implement each of these 9
nonpharmaceutical interventions (i.e., the hour when a specific strategy was
implemented) was recorded. A state that did not enact a particular intervention by the
end of the study window (i.e., 6 PM April 7) was considered censored for that strategy
and was coded as having the longest time of 606 hours on length of time it took to enact
the measure. Censoring under the current setting refers to the fact that the event of
interest did not occur by the end of the study window but might occur in future.
The theoretical model guiding the selection of potential determinants for
inclusion in our models of social distancing orders is the “social determinants of health”
(SDOH) framework.8 Originally developed by WHO, the framework emphasizes the
strong relationship between societal factors and health outcomes, especially crucial
activities needed to close gaps and inequalities in health care concerning socioeconomic
status, gender, tradition/culture, and race/ethnicity. To adapt this framework for the
U.S., the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine organized a special
group to further articulate strategies for integrating social care into the delivery of
health care to improve the nation's health. Report of the Academies was published on
September 25, 2019. Immediately following its publication, a Congressional Briefing
was convened to discuss the implementation of SDOH-related strategies.9 The
Academies’ report underscores five key health care activities to better address the
SDOH and integrate social care with health care: awareness, adjustment, assistance,
alignment, and advocacy. These activities help us to identify important variables for the
determinant study.

Under the guidance of the five key SDOH activities and based on the available
census data and other published statistics, we identified the following five blocks of
state-level variables for inclusion as potential determinants in modeling social distance
orders: demographic characteristics, economic well-being information, public heath
infrastructure, information related to politics, and international connectivity. To
measure state governmental awareness of the Covid-19, we included in the study a
time-varying covariate of cumulative Covid-19 cases per 10,000 population one-day
before the time when a mitigation strategy was enacted. This measure is analogous to
the prevalence rate of Covid-19 disease.
To explore the impacts of mitigation interventions, we conducted statistical
analyses that link the timing of each mitigation order to various case counts of Covid19. This is a correlational rather than causal analysis, due to lacking an accurate or even
a proxy estimate of counterfactual. A counterfactual in the current setting refers to
“What would have happened had we not enacted a mitigation strategy?” The outcome
data come from Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Data Stream that combines
WHO and CDC case data.10 Based on the original input data, we employed 9 variables
in the investigation: cumulative cases, cumulative deaths, new cases, new deaths,
cumulative cases per 10,000 population, cumulative deaths per 10,000 population,
cumulative new cases per 10,000 population, cumulative new deaths per 10,000
population, and death rate defined as the number of cumulative deaths divided by the
number of cumulative cases. These measures are computed as of the time of this study
and may underestimate the actual cases and deaths. The study employed daily counts
on each of the 9 outcome measures from March 11 (two days before the National
Emergency was declared) to April 15 (about one week after the last state enacted the
Stay-at-Home order).
Survival Analysis and the Multiple-Event Survival Model
The analysis of determinants of each mitigation strategy employed a
proportional hazards model.11, 12
The analysis of overall determinants pulled together all nine episodes of
mitigation interventions and employed the WLW model. This model is designated by
the first initials of the developers’ last name.13,14
The WLW model is a robust approach developed to control for the
autocorrelations of study events. Under the framework of Cox proportional hazards

where 𝑍𝑖𝑘 = (𝑍1𝑖𝑘 , … , 𝑍𝑝𝑖𝑘 )′ denotes the covariate vector for the ith state with respect to
the kth type of order, 𝜆0𝑘 (𝑡) with (𝑘 = 1, … , 𝐾) is the unspecified baseline hazard

The Inverse-Normal Transformation (INT) and the Indirect INT Method
To analyze zero-inflatd and skewed outcome variables (i.e., all Covid-19 caseload
data), we employed the inverse-normal transformation approach. This approach is
frequently practiced in genome-wide association studies in which skewed residuals are
common and, hence, violate the normality assumption embedded in regression
analysis. Suppose u has a skewed distribution. Let rank(ui) denote the sample rank of ui
when the measurements are placed in ascending order. The rank-based inverse normal
transformation (INT) is defined as:
𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘(𝑢𝑖 ) − 𝑘
𝐼𝑁𝑇(𝑢𝑖 ) = ф−1 [
]
𝑛 − 2𝑘 + 1
Here ф−1is a normal density function, k ∈ (0, ½) is an adjustable offset, and n is the
sample size. By default, the Blom offset of k = 3/8 is adopted.
The impact study employed a newly developed method called indirect-INT that
shows efficient and unbiased properties in Genome-Wide Association Studies.15
Denoting 𝑦𝑖𝑡 the outcome variable y for the ith state at time t, 𝑡 ∈ {1, … , 𝑇} , the analysis
followed the steps described below: (1) Separately for each time point 𝑡 ∈ {1, … , 𝑇},
regress each 𝑦𝑖𝑡 on the time-invariant covariates 𝑤𝑖 to obtain the residuals 𝜀𝑖𝑡 ; (2)
Conduct INT on the residuals 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ≡ 𝐼𝑁𝑇(𝜀𝑖𝑡 ) to obtain the Z-scores, again separately for
each time point t; (3) Regress each mitigation strategy on the time-invariant covariates
wi to obtain the residuals; and (4) Fit the full random-effect spatial error panel model for
the 𝑧𝑖𝑡 .

Method of the Impact Analysis Controlling for Spatial Autocorrelations
Residuals of a regression model with spatial data often show spatial
autocorrelation that is caused by either the spatial autocorrelated dependent variables
(endogenous interaction) or omitted spatially autocorrelated predictors (error
interaction).16, 17 The predictors might also be spatially autocorrelated (exogenous
interaction), but it will not cause residual spatial autocorrelation. To address the
autocorrelation, we employed a spatial panel model. A full version of the model can be
expressed as:
𝑌𝑡 = 𝜌𝑊𝑌𝑡 + 𝛼𝜄𝑁 + 𝑋𝑡 𝛽 + 𝑊𝑋𝑡 𝜃 + 𝜇 + 𝜉𝑡 𝜄𝑁 + 𝜇𝑡
𝜇𝑡 = 𝜆𝑊𝜇𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡
where Yt and Xt are the dependent and independent variables at time t, respectively. β
is the vector of coefficients. WYt, Wµt and WXt are the three interactions. ρ, θ and λ are
their coefficients. W is a spatial configuration matrix and is defined using a sphere of
influence (SOI) approach18 that defines for the ith unit, let ri be the distance from i to its
nearest neighbor, and Ci the circle centered on i with the radius of ri. i and j are
neighbors when Ci and Cj intersect. µt is the error term. ιN is a vector of value ones. µ
and ξt are individual and time-specific effects. εt is a well-behaved random noise.
Because the sources of residuals’ spatial autocorrelation can only be weakly
identified17, modeling either the endogenous (spatial lag) or error interaction (spatial
error) would suffice. In this study, we are interested in how the mitigation strategies
impact the spread of covid-19. There are likely omitted spatially autocorrelated
predictors. Therefore, we employed a random-effect spatial error panel model in
conjunction with an indirect-INT in the final analysis.
Results
Factors Associated with the Implementation of Nonpharmaceutical Mitigation
Interventions
Figure 1 presents the descriptive information about the implementation of these
mitigation interventions for all 50 states and Washington DC. The most important
strategy is the Stay-at-Home order, which was enacted by 42 states and Washington
DC. The earliest state to implement this was California. Most states issued a Stay-atHome order between March 23 and March 28. However, eight states never chose to
implement the order. The map shows the geographic distribution of timing categories,
with lighter colors indicating earlier enactments of Stay-at-Home. The most frequently

invoked intervention was public school closure, which was enacted by all 50 states and
Washington DC. Most states issued a school closure order between March 13 to 18. The
second most frequently invoked intervention was restaurant/bar closure or limitation,
which was issued by 49 states and Washington DC. A strengthened order refers to
mitigation more restrictive than Stay-at-Home, including the enforcement of Stay-atHome and grocery shopping limit. Only five states issued a strengthened order.
Because of the comparatively low use of strengthened order, we did not include it in
Figure 1. Of these five states, Hawaii implemented the strengthened order on 6 AM
April 1, U.S. Eastern Time, with a length of time of 450 hours, and the remaining four
states (Indiana, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio) implemented strengthened orders
on 12 AM April 7, U.S. Eastern Time, with a length of time of 588 hours.
The results of the estimated models for each of the nine mitigation interventions
are presented in Table 1. Of nine models, the strengthened-order model did not fit the
data well, as the model chi-square was 12.66 (p=.2434). A poor fit of the strengthenedorder model was expected, because only five states, out of 51, invoked this order. The
results of the remaining eight models are summarized below.
Determinants of Stay-at-Home order: Covid-19 cases per 10,000 population at
the time one day before the enactment – every one-case increase reduces the hazard of
enacting the order by 55.1% (p<.001); GDP per capita in 2019 – every $1,000 increase
increases the hazard by 3.9% (p<.05); % uninsured in 2018 – every one-percentage-point
increase reduces the hazard by 21.3% (p<.01); hospital beds per 1,000 population in
2018—every one-bed increase reduces the hazard by 75.4%.
Determinants of public school closure: Covid-19 cases per 10,000 population at
the time one day before the enactment – every one-case increase reduces the hazard of
enacting the measure of public school closure by 96% (p<.01).
Determinants of all school closure: Covid-19 cases per 10,000 population at the
time one day before the enactment – every one-case increase reduces the hazard of
enacting the measure of all school closure by 97.7% (p<.01); % uninsured in 2018 – every
one-percentage-point increase reduces the hazard by 34.1% (p<.01).
Determinants of large gathering ban of more than 10 people: Covid-19 cases per
10,000 population at the time one day before the enactment – every one-case increase
reduces the hazard of enacting the large gathering ban by 67.6% (p<.001);
unemployment rate in February 2020 – every one-percentage point increase increases
the hazard by 62.7% (p<.05).

Determinants of any gathering ban: Covid-19 cases per 10,000 population at the
time one day before the enactment – every one-case increase reduces the hazard of
enacting the any gathering ban by 84.8% (p<.001); GDP per capital in 2019 – every
$1,000 increase increases the hazard by 14.2% (p<.01); poverty rate in 2018 – every onepercentage-point increase increases the hazard by 74% (p<.05).
Determinants of restaurant/bar limit to dining out only: Covid-19 cases per
10,000 population at the time one-day prior to the enactment – every one-case increase
reduces the hazard of enacting the measure of restaurant/bar limit by 94.8% (p<.01); %
uninsured in 2018 – every one-percentage-point increase reduces the hazard by 28.4%
(p<.01).
Determinants of non-essential business ban: Covid-19 cases per 10,000
population at the time one day before the enactment – every one-case increase reduces
the hazard of enacting the non-essential business ban by 38.4% (p<.001); % of African
American and Hispanic population – every one-percentage-point increase increases the
hazard by 5.6%; % uninsured in 2018 – every one-percentage-point increase reduces the
hazard by 20.9% (p<.01).
Determinants of mandatary self-quarantine of travelers: Covid-19 cases per
10,000 population at the time one day before the enactment – every one-case increase
reduces the hazard of enacting the mandatary self-quarantine of travelers by 89.6%
(p<.01); hospital beds per 1,000 population – every one-bed increase decreases the
hazard by 97.9%; public health budget per capita in 2019 – every one-dollar increase
increases the hazard by 4.1% (p<.05); the number of international airports – every oneairport increase decreases the hazard by 93.6% (p<.05).
Determinants of the overall model. Table 2 presents the results of a multipleevent analysis. Regardless of the type of mitigation, overall, there are three statistically
significant determinants of the timing: population in 2019— every 100,000-population
increase increases the hazard of enactment by 4% (p<.05), the unemployment rate in
Feb. 2020 – every one-percentage-point increase increases the hazard by 50.7% (p<.001),
and % of uninsured in 2018 – every one-percentage-point increase reduces the hazard
by 11.3% (p<.01).
One of the important findings is the response of states to the Covid-19
prevalence rate. Contradictory to our hypothesis, states with a lower prevalence of
Covid-19 cases per 10,000 population reacted more quickly to the outbreak. Some states
appear to have been more primed to issue Stay-at-Home orders. They acted while the

virus had a low prevalence before it spread widely. This finding is statistically
significant in all 8 models. The variable is not significant in the overall model, probably
due to the inclusion of other predictors. Given that the doubling time and related serial
interval of Covid-19 are short (i.e., 4.4-7.5 days), taking mitigating actions within a short
period is crucial. States that experienced less disease responded in a faster fashion. This
finding helps explain why new case counts of Covid-19 in the United States remained
high for a longer period than other developed economies globally. The finding suggests
that even following the National Emergency declaration, some states did not react and
missed the opportunity to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
To better understand the effect of prevalence rate on the timing of enacting
mitigation interventions, we present the model-based predictions of survival curves for
all eight models and descriptive figures in Figure 2. Fig. 2.1 shows the survival
functions, which, in the current setting, indicates the proportion of states that did not
enact certain measure at a given time. As such, the bottom survival line indicates the
fastest speed to enact, while the top survival line indicates the slowest. The figures
indicate that States with high prevalence rates enacted the mitigation measures slowly.
Fig. 2.2 shows prevalence rates of Covid-19 cases at the time one day before each
mitigation intervention was enacted. States on the X-axis are ordered by the timing of
the enactment, with the state closer to the origin enacted earlier. As all figures clearly
show, states issued later (i.e., those on the right-hand side) had high Covid-19 cases per
10,000 population (i.e., high bars), indicating that the higher the prevalence rate, the
slower the speed moving to the enactment. This pattern applies to all mitigation
measures.
In summary, the Covid-19 prevalence rate, population size, unemployment, the
proportion of uninsured, poverty, level of economic development, proportion of
minority people, and public health infrastructure are the key determinants affecting the
timing to enact nonpharmaceutical mitigation interventions.
The Impacts of the Mitigation Measures
Table 3 presents the results of the exploratory impact study. We conducted onetailed tests on all coefficients, because based on a strong theoretical justification, we
hypothesized that each independent variable (i.e., the timing of enacting a mitigating
measure) reduces the new Covid-19 cases or deaths. Results show that of 72 regression
coefficients (i.e., 8 mitigation measures by 9 outcome variables), only five were
significantly related to mitigation strategies (p<.05, one-tailed test). All other coefficients
are not statistically significant.

The following five coefficients suggest that mitigation interventions are effective
in reducing Covid-19 case data. That is, other things being equal, enacting a nonessential business ban reduces 0.228 daily cumulative cases, reduces 0.133 daily new
cases, and reduces 0.134 daily cumulative cases per 10,000 population; enacting a largegathering ban reduces the daily Covid-19 death rate by 35.5%; and enacting a
restaurant/bar limit reduces the daily Covid-19 death rate by 22.3%.
In summary, three mitigation strategies (i.e., non-essential business ban, largegathering ban of more than 10 people, and restaurant/bar limit) may be effective in
reducing cumulative cases, new cases, and death rate. All three strategies aim to
increase social distance by reducing social gatherings and contact. Other social
distancing strategies were not correlated with outcomes, and it is unknown whether
effects would be observed over a greater intervention period.
Discussion
To date, the United States continues to experience high levels of Covid-19
disease. This study offers two observations that may help explain why this is the case.
One is that some states may have missed optimal timing to implement social distancing.
Based on prior research during epidemics, it is important to implement social
distancing swiftly; the key is not whether such measures should be taken but when. The
second is that, in the short run of 5 weeks, mitigation interventions should be expected
to have only limited effects on slowing down the spread of disease. Of nine strategies,
only three showed impacts.
Four implications of these findings warrant special attention. First, Stay-at-Home
orders, public school closures, all school closures, any gathering bans, mandatary selfquarantine of travelers are important, but perhaps – in the early stages of trying to
control a highly infectious disease – are not as important as the large-gathering ban of
more than 10 people, non-essential business closure, and restaurant/bar limits. These
three restrictions focus on avoiding large gatherings and interacting crowds. Observing
an effect from other mitigation strategies may require more time. School closures, for
example, may take a longer time to demonstrate an effect because, in this epidemic,
young people appear to have been less affected, and they were more likely to be
asymptomatic.
Second, staying at home may not reduce new disease if home is a collective, such
as a long term care facility, and if exposure occurs in home settings. In this regard, very
quick tracing may be necessary. China’s public-private “health code” system may be

worthy of consideration. Hosted on the Alipay and WeChat apps and deeply aligned
with the public health system, a health code of one of three viral risk statuses – red,
yellow, or green – is assigned to every citizen.19 This enables quicker tracking and
quarantining than is possible – and perhaps legally feasible – in the Western countries,
where privacy concerns often dominate discourse on public health interventions.
Notwithstanding, applying advanced technology, using big data, and mobilizing digital
tools to better target health care system resources is recommended by the National
Academies.9
Thirdly, during the study window, many U.S. policymakers and officials
considered reopening the economy by removing some or all mitigation interventions.
As of May 11, or about three weeks after the study window was closed, 32 states did
so.6 Our exploratory findings suggest that at least three mitigation strategies were
having an effect at that time. Because there is no preventive vaccine and because there
are few potentially effective treatments, recent reductions in new cases and deaths must
be due, in large part, to the social interventions delivered by states. The removal of
these social interventions in the absence of effective pharmaceutical interventions
carries a high risk for a relapse.
Finally, it is worth noting that this analysis is based on the decisions made by
Governors at the state level so may imprecisely measure the exact variation of impacts
across the U.S., since in many cases social distancing policies were implemented at the
substate level (e.g. counties) at different periods, reflecting different mitigation
strategies and leading to different outcomes.
The unprecedented implementation of social distancing is projected to cost at
least 2 trillion U.S. dollars. On March 27, an over $2 trillion economic relief package, the
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, was passed by Congress
with bipartisan support, and it was signed into law by President Trump.20 Social
distancing interventions are also associated with a large number of job losses. In the
seven weeks ending May 2, 33.5 million people made initial claims for unemployment
in the U.S., a record number of unemployment claims. The official unemployment rate
reached 14.7% in April, the highest rates observed since the Great Depression.21
Undoubtedly, policymakers are facing a tough decision: How to balance between
economic and public health interests? Which strategies should be undertaken at which
time points in order to maximize utility functions? The findings of this study provide
preliminary evidence about the effectiveness of some mitigation measures.

Policymakers need to weigh carefully the pros and cons of lifting the mitigations, given
that these measures were already associated with a huge cost and economic resources.

Supplementary Materials
The Correction of a Non-normal Outcome Variable with Inverse-Normal Transformation
Results show that the inverse-normal transformation method appropriately transformed the zero-inflated and skewed outcome
into a normally distributed variable. Fig. S1 shows an example.

Additional Model-based Predictions of Survival Function
Figure 2 presents the model-based predictions of survival curve showing the effect of prevalence rate on the timing of
enacting mitigation interventions. Since the results of other significant predictors are also important, particularly for policymakers and
stakeholders, we present selected model-based predictions of survival curves in Figure S2. In these figures (S2.1-S2.6), the bottom
survival line indicates the fastest speed to enact, while the top survival line indicates the slowest.
Figure S2.7 shows a map of model-based prediction of the percentiles of risk scores issuing the Stay-at-Home order. These
scores were obtained by multiplying the values of independent variables for each of the 50 states and Washington DC by the estimated
regression coefficients of the proportional hazards model. Risk score in the current setting indicates the speed enacting the Stay-atHome order, with states of the 10th percentile moving to enact the order the slowest speed or having the highest proportion not
enacting the order at a given time, and states of the 99th percentile moving to enacting the order the fastest speed.

Sensitivity Analysis of the Impact of Prevalence Rate on Mitigation Timing
Findings of the predictor of Covid-19 cases per 10,000 population, or the prevalence rate, are contradictory to our hypothesis:
states with a lower prevalence of Covid-19 cases per 10,000 population reacted more quickly to the outbreak. To ensure that this
pattern did exist, we conducted several sensitivity analyses. We first replaced this variable with the growth rate of Covid-19 cases per
10,000 population from five days ago to one day ago, in conjunction with the case count five days ago. We tested both the linear
growth rate and exponential grown rate. The analysis was performed on all eight mitigation measures. Results from these analyses
confirmed that states with high prevalence rates enacted mitigation strategies slowly.

A Note about Nonsignificant Impacts of the Stay-at-Home Order
Surprisingly, the results from Table 3 seem to suggest that the “Stay-at-Home” order does not have significant impact on any
of the nine outcome variables. We suspect that the “Stay-at-Home” order does not necessarily confine people from contacting one
another since the order is more like the opposite of "go-to-work." The “Stay-at-Home” order hence might not be a good measure for
"social distancing" as was intended. While the order was issued, most will simply not go to work, but gather as they would do after
work. The three significant factors that are found in the four models, non-essential business closure, large-gathering ban,
restaurant/bar limit, are probably the real measures for "social distancing." We experimented with the same random effect spatial error
panel models but removed the three significant predictors. The modified models still suggest that the “Stay-at-Home” order does not
have a significant impact on any of the outcome variables. These results suggest that "social distancing" strategy indeed works against
the spread of Covid19. While "stay-at-home" order was initially thought as a means for social distancing, it fails to achieve real social
distancing nationwide.
In addition, the timing of when the “Stay-at-Home” order was issued also suggests a spatial clustering pattern (Figure 1). A
spatial autocorrelation test of the timing when the “Stay-at-Home” order was issued produces a Moran’s I of 0.348, with a p-value =
0.00024 using the SOI spatial configuration. The test suggests that the timing of issuing “Stay-at-Home” order might have a clear
spatial clustering trend in which one state is more likely to enact the “Stay-at-Home” order if its neighbors are enacting the order and
vice versa.
