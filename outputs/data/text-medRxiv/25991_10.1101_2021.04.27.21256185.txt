Abstract
Importance: Although several predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy have been identified, the
role of physical health has not been well-examined, and the association with mental health is
unknown.
Objective: To examine the association of pre-pandemic mental health, physical health, and
shielding with vaccine hesitancy after the announcement of the successful testing of the Oxford
University/AstraZeneca vaccine.
Design, Setting, and Participants: We used individual-level data from a pandemic-focused
investigation (COVID Survey), a prospective cohort study nested within the UK Understanding
Society (Main Survey) project. In the week immediately following the announcement of successful
testing of the first efficacious inoculation (November/December 2020), data on vaccine
intentionality were collected in 12,035 individuals aged 16-95 years. Pre-pandemic, study
members had responded to enquiries about diagnoses of mental and physical health, completed
the 12-item General Health Questionnaire for symptoms of psychological distress (anxiety and
depression), and indicated whether they or someone in their household was shielding.
Main outcome measures: Self-reported intention to take up a vaccination for COVID-19. To
summarise our results, we computed odds ratios with accompanying 95% confidence intervals for
indices of health and shielding adjusted for selected covariates.
Results: In an analytical sample of 11,955 people (6741 women), 15.4% indicated that they were
vaccine hesitant. Relative to their disease-free counterparts, shielding was associated with a 24%
lower risk of being hesitant (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 0.76; 0.59, 0.96), after adjustment
for a range of covariates which included age, education, and ethnicity. Corresponding results for
cardiometabolic disease were 22% (0.78; 0.64, 0.95), and for respiratory disease were 26% (0.74;
0.59, 0.93). Having a pre-pandemic diagnosis of anxiety or depression, or a high score on the
distress symptom scale, were all unrelated to the willingness to take up a vaccine.
Conclusions and relevance: People who have been prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination owing to
a physical condition are more likely to take it up. These effects were not apparent for indices of
mental health.

Introduction
Whereas it was established early in the COVID-19 pandemic that people with chronic physical
illness experienced higher rates of hospitalisation for and death from the disease,1-4 more recent
evidence suggests that the same may also be the case for people with a mental health problems
and those with a higher prevalence of psychological distress symptoms (anxiety and depression).47

In selected countries, vaccination against COVID-19, central to attaining herd immunity,8 has

therefore been prioritised for people with physical disorders – alongside the request that they
shield – whereas population segmentation of people with mental health problems has been much
less universal.9

There are several reasons to anticipate greater vaccine hesitancy in people with mental health
problems, including those with high scores on distress symptom scale, and this may compound
COVID-19 rates in this at-risk group. First, individuals with psychiatric morbidity and symptoms of
distress tend to have a lower prevalence of health-protecting behaviours. Relative to their
unaffected counterparts, for instance, they are more likely to smoke, take less exercise, have an
imprudent diet, and be obese.10-12 Third, people with mental health issues also appear to be less
likely to take up the offer of health screening,13 although this is not a universal observation.14
Lastly, of most relevance, in a study of influenza inoculation, users of an outpatient psychiatry clinic
had markedly lower take up than the general population.15

Collectively, these observations provide a prima facie case that people with common symptoms of
mental distress may be somewhat more hesitant when offered a vaccination against COVID-19,
and in the absence of any empirical data, there have been recent calls to test this relationship.16
Accordingly, in a large, general-population based UK sample we examined the relationships of
mental health diagnosis and symptoms of mental distress with vaccine hesitancy. Alongside these
results, we present the association between somatic illness and vaccine hesitancy; in the few
relevant studies, having somatic illness has been significantly associated with lower levels of
hesitancy.17,18 Importantly, data collection on vaccine intention took place following the
announcement of successful testing of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, which was

widely and prominently publicised. Therefore, the present survey concerning vaccination hesitancy
was taken at a time when the future offer of a vaccination was no longer merely hypothetical.

Methods
Understanding Society, also known as the UK Household Longitudinal Study, is a nationallyrepresentative, on-going, open, cohort study (hereinafter, the ‘Main Survey’). Based on a
clustered-stratified probability sample of households, participants have been interviewed annually
since 2009.19 Households who had participated in at least one of the two most recent waves of
data collection (wave 8, 2016-18; wave 9, 2017-19) comprised the target sample for a pandemicfocused study initiated in April 2020 (hereinafter, the ‘COVID Survey’).20,21 The derivation of the
present analytical sample from the Main and COVID Surveys, including the wave for specific data
collection, is given in figure 1. The University of Essex Ethics Committee gave approval for the
COVID-orientated surveys (ETH1920-1271); no further ethical permissions were required for the
present analyses of anonymised data.

The COVID Surveys took place monthly/bimonthly between April (wave 1) and November 2020
(wave 6), with questions on vaccine intention first administered in the latest tranche of data
collection when study members were aged 16-95 years (mean 53).21 Data collection in wave 6
(starting 24th November) commenced the day immediately following the announcement of the
efficacy of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine.22 Data collection continued for one week,
and obtained information from a total of 12,035 individuals of 19,294 invitations issued (response
proportion 62%).21

Assessment of mental and physical morbidity
Study members indicated if a physician or other health professional had ever informed them that
they had a psychiatric problem, which included anxiety, depression, psychosis or schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder or manic depression, an eating disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, or any
other mental illness (wave 10, 2019-20; Main Survey). With a low prevalence hesitancy for
selected conditions, we aggregated the latter five mental health groups. Self-reports of a physician

diagnosis of mental illness, in particular depression, shows reasonable agreement with structured
clinical interviews.23

Psychological distress (wave 6, November 2020; COVID Survey) was ascertained using
administration of the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire. Validated against
standardised psychiatric interviews,24,25 this is a widely-used measure of psychological distress in
population-based studies. Consistent with published analyses,12,26,27 we used the following
classifications: asymptomatic (score 0), sub-clinically symptomatic (score 1-3), symptomatic (score
4-6), and highly symptomatic (score 7-12).

A history of physical morbidity was also captured (wave 10, 2019-20; Main Survey) and based on
self-report of physician diagnosis for: a cardiometabolic condition (congestive heart failure,
coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack or infarction, stroke, diabetes, and/or hypertension);
respiratory disease (respiratory disease comprised bronchitis, emphysema, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and/or asthma); or cancer of any type. In other studies, these data reveal
moderate to high agreement with clinical records.28

Lastly, based on their physical medical history, people judged as extremely clinically vulnerable to
COVID-19 were contacted by the UK National Health Service or their general practitioner during
the early stages of the pandemic and recommended to stay at home. Conditions that met the
criteria for shielding included selected cancers, severe respiratory disorders such as cystic fibrosis,
severe asthma, organ transplant recipients, and people with a disability such as Down’s
syndrome.29 Study members were asked about the shielding status for themselves or a household
member (waves 1-5, April to July 2020; COVID Surveys; denoted by yes/no).

Assessment of covariates
Covariates were self-reported and included age; sex (both wave 10, 2019-20; Main Survey);
ethnicity (wave 10, Main Survey; denoted as white or non-white); and highest education level
(wave 10, Main Survey; categorised as degree & other higher degree, A’ level or equivalent

[Advanced Placement in the USA], GCSE or equivalent [Grade 10 in the USA], other qualification,
and none). In the third wave of data collection in the Main Survey (2011-2013), six cognitive
function tests were administered: immediate word recall and delayed word recall tasks; semantic
verbal fluency; cognitive impairment; numerical reasoning skills; and fluid reasoning.30
Representing a range of cognitive skills, these tests have been repeatedly deployed in large-scale,
population-based studies.31-35 Using scores from the six tests, we generated a single general
cognitive function variable (g) for use in the present analyses.36

Assessment of vaccine hesitancy
At wave 6 (November 2020) in the COVID Survey, study members were asked: “Imagine that a
vaccine against COVID-19 was available for anyone who wanted it. How likely or unlikely would
you be to take the vaccine?”. Possible responses were “Very likely”, “Likely”, “Unlikely” and “Very
unlikely”. The latter two categories were combined to denote vaccine hesitancy.

Statistical analyses
To summarise the relation between mental morbidity, physical morbidity, and vaccine hesitancy,
we used logistic regression to compute odds ratios with accompanying 95% confidence intervals.
The most basic analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity. Retaining these covariates, we
then explored the impact of controlling separately and collectively for education, shielding status,
and cognitive function; in analyses in which mental health was the exposure of interest, we
physical illness, and vice versa.

Results
In table 1 we show study member characteristics according to vaccine intention in unadjusted
analyses. In a sample of 11,955 individuals (6741 women) who responded in full to the enquiry
regarding COVID-19 vaccine intentionality, 15.4% indicated that they were hesitant. Relative to
the group who indicated a willingness to have the vaccine, those who were hesitant were more
likely to be younger, female, from an ethnic minority background, be less well educated, and have
a lower general cognitive function score. The hesitant were also less likely to have an existing

somatic morbidity, as indexed by cardiometabolic disease and cancer. Related, there was also a
lower prevalence of shielding in the hesitant category (correlation between any physical morbidity
and shielding in the present study: ρ=0.12, p<0.0001, N=10916). There was, however, little
evidence of a difference in prevalence of specific mental health diagnoses across the hesitant
groups; only ‘other’ mental health conditions was more common in study members expressing
hesitancy, but the absolute difference was marginal with statistical significance generated from the
large numbers. People who declared themselves reticent in taking the vaccine when offered had
slightly higher levels of psychological distress symptoms.

In table 2 we used multiple regression analyses to explore the association between an existing
diagnosis of a morbidity as a predictor of vaccine hesitancy. Relative to people without a physical
condition, those with a diagnosis of cardiometabolic disease (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval:
0.82; 0.67, 0.99) or respiratory disease (0.71; 0.57, 0.88) were less like to have reported that they
would decline an offer of vaccination, after adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity. The
associations between cancer and shielding and vaccine hesitancy were not statistically significant
at conventional levels. Adjusting for a range of covariates (table 2 and figure 2) had little impact on
these relationships; an exception was the regression coefficient for shielding becoming statistically
significant at conventional levels (0.76; 0.59, 0.96) such that people who were shielding were less
vaccine-hesitant. The general lack of impact of control for individual covariates is shown in table
a1 (appendix).

In analyses in which mental illness diagnosis was the exposure of interest, none of the individual
psychiatric conditions were related to vaccine hesitancy (table 2). Using the standard four
category schema for symptoms of psychological distress, however, there was some suggestion of
a ‘U’-shaped effect, such that people who had either low or high scores on the distress scale were
marginally more likely to be vaccine hesitant, and those with moderate symptoms had the lowest
likelihood (p-value for quadratic relationship after multiple adjustment: 0.003). We further explored
this association by using raw scores from the psychological distress scale (range 0-12). Based on

this disaggregation, there was, however, no support for any relationship, linear or quadratic,
between psychological distress and vaccine hesitancy (figure 3).

Discussion
Our main finding was that, in data collected in the United Kingdom immediately following the
announcement of the successful evaluation of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, selected
physical but not psychiatric morbidities were related to a lower likelihood of vaccine hesitancy. The
results for mental health run counter to our expectations, given that people with such morbidities
are, as described, less likely to engage in health-protecting behaviours such as healthy lifestyle
habits12 and screening for somatic disorder.13

Comparison with existing studies
The notion that people with a long-standing physical condition are less likely to be vaccine-hesitant
has been reported in other studies.17,18 That we also recapitulated known associations with
hesitancy such as being female,37-39 being younger,37,39 and from an ethnic minority group,21,39,40
gives us some confidence in our novel results for mental health. To the best of our knowledge,
there has been one prior examination of the relationship between mental health and vaccine
hestinacy.41 Comprising two small cross-sectional studies where data collection took place prior to
the announcement of the successful testing of the first efficacious vaccination, study members
were administered a very brief and unvalidated enquiry as to whether they had experience of
mental health problems. In that study, there was no clear evidence of a link.41 Studies using data
based on other vaccination programmes offer limited insights. For instance, in a cross-sectional
study of patients with schizophrenia which took place during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in
Australia, three-quarters indicated that they were willing to be vaccinated;42 however, in keeping
with similar studies,43 the absence of a general population comparison group renders interpretation
problematic. In a small cohort of socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers, those with mental
health problems were seemingly less likely to have children with up-to-date vaccine coverage,
although the association was weak and the study underpowered.44

Study strengths and weaknesses
Whereas the present study has its strengths, including its size, national representativeness, and
timing, there are also some weaknesses. First, we used vaccine intentionality as an indicator
vaccine uptake but the correlation between the two is imperfect. In a small-scale longitudinal study
conducted during the period of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong, less than 10% of people
who expressed a commitment to being inoculated reported that they had received a vaccination
two months later.45 Elsewhere, in a US adult population at high risk of seasonal influenza, around
half of those intending to be vaccinated had received the inoculation within the following 5
months.46 Second, there was inevitably some loss to follow-up (figure 1). Whereas this attrition
might have impacted upon the estimation of the prevalence vaccine hesitancy, which is likely to be
lower in our select sample relative to the general population,47 it is unlikely to have influenced our
estimation of its relationship with mental and physical health. Thus, in other contexts, we have
shown that highly-selected cohorts reveal very similar risk factor–outcome associations to those
seen in studies with conventionally high response.48

In conclusion, we found that some somatic conditions but not mental health problems were related
to a lower likelihood of being vaccine hesitant against COVID-19.
