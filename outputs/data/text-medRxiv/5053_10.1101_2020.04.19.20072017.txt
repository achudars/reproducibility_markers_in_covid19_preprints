Abstract
Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic requires accurate forecasting of health system capacity
requirements using readily available inputs. We examined whether testing and hospitalization
data could help quantify the anticipated burden on the health system given shelter-in-place
(SIP) order.

We find a marked slowdown in the hospitalization rate within ten days of SIP even as cases
continued to rise. We also find a shift towards younger patients in the age distribution of those
testing positive for COVID-19 over the four weeks of SIP. The impact of this shift is a divergence
between increasing positive case confirmations and slowing new hospitalizations, both of which
affects the demand on health systems.

Without using local hospitalization rates and the age distribution of positive patients, current
models are likely to overestimate the resource burden of COVID-19. It is imperative that health
systems start using these data to quantify effects of SIP and aid reopening planning.

Introduction
In order to prepare for COVID-19, health system leaders and policy-makers need to forecast
future healthcare needs. A number of forecasting models have been developed and widely
shared to help health care facilities and governments predict upcoming patient surges and plan
accordingly 1,2​
​ . These models take in a myriad of inputs including population demographics,
currently admitted patients, case doubling times, and the rate at which positive cases turn into
hospitalizations, among other inputs 1​​ ,​3​,​4​,​5.​ While there are enough models, guidance and data to
provide accurate inputs to these models remain lacking 6–8​
​ . Currently, 95% of Americans have
been asked to stay at home. Schools, businesses and community gathering activities have been
closed or curtailed and plans of reopening hinge on demonstrated sustained reduction in cases,
availability of testing, and enough health system capacity to treat patients requiring
hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care 9,10​
​ . The need to accurately plan
health system capacity is one of the six indicators cited to guide the state of California’s decision
making around reopening the state’s economy 11​
​ . An important first step is taking stock of the
currently available hospitalization and testing data and how it has evolved as the pandemic
progresses.

Stanford Health Care (SHC), a large academic healthcare system, serves patients in the San
Francisco Bay Area. The major hospitals that comprise SHC are located in Santa Clara County,
which began mandated shelter-in-place (SIP) on midnight March 16, 26 days before we
conducted the analysis presented here. SHC had extensive testing capacity starting on March
4​th​, and since then, tested anyone who had influenza-like infection symptoms, known COVID-19
positive contact, healthcare workers with a known exposure, or by physician discretion. As of

April 11th, our laboratory has tested nearly 15,800 cases, and tracked hospitalization data of the
test-confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Given our dual access to testing and hospitalization data, we examined whether we could
reliably quantify the effects of state-mandated SIP using testing and hospitalization rates. This
allowed us to quantify the divergence between the rates of positive case confirmations and
hospitalizations. In addition, we identified a shift in the age distribution of new COVID-19
positive cases over the duration of the study.

Methods
16,103 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were performed on 15,807 patients at Stanford facilities
between March 2 and April 11, 2020. Of these, 8,309 tests were performed on 7,929 patients in
facilities where the patient would have been admitted to our hospital if necessary. We analyzed
the fraction of tested patients that were confirmed positive for COVID-19, the fraction of those
needing hospitalization, and the fraction requiring ICU admission over the 40 days between
March 2nd and April 11th 2020.

Data were obtained from a combination of two sources: a daily-refreshed snapshot of the health
system’s Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) and a twice-daily refreshed extract of all RT-PCR
laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 at Stanford. Access to a view of the EDW was set up last year
as part of Stanford Medicine’s Program for Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare​12​. The EDW view
consisted of 33 tables, containing demographics, diagnoses, procedures, labs, and orders.
These tables were refreshed nightly with updated one-year historical and current hospitalization
information of patients admitted in the census of the hospital. The access to the laboratory

testing was provided as part of Stanford's data science response to COVID-19​13​. The laboratory
testing data consisted of details about the specimen collected, the result, the procedure of
specimen collection, identifiers to link with EDW tables and symptoms documented on
admission. The project to track SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and hospitalization trends was
initiated as a quality assurance project aimed at enabling hospital capacity planning and IRB
approval (protocol # 55544) was obtained prior to this submission summarizing the learning
from this effort.

Results
3.77% of COVID-19 positive patients required an ICU admission
As shown in Figure 1, out of these 7,929 tested patients, 451 (5.68%) tested positive for
COVID-19 and out of these 451 cases, 59 (13.08%) were hospitalized following their test.
Among the 59 hospitalized cases, 17 (28.8% of hospitalized and 3.77% of all positive cases)
required ICU care. Our observed case hospitalization rate is more in line with the 12% reported
nationally than the 25.5% reported in New York City (as of April 7)​14,15​. The higher case
hospitalization rate in New York may be due to the fact that low testing capacity to case
numbers might have led to severe cases being prioritized for testing. Our ICU rate among
confirmed cases similarly matches American national reports of 2.9%, compared to the 5%
reported in China or 12% in Lombardy​16,17​.

Hospitalization rate slowed within 10 days of shelter-in-place even as
confirmed cases continue to rise
Over the past five weeks, we continue to see new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and ICU
admissions, however their rates have slowed (Figure 2). The doubling time for each metric
increased from under 5 days on March 16th to over 25 days as of April 11. The slowdown in
hospital admissions began within 10 days of SIP, and is more dramatic than the slowdown of
confirmed cases. Forecasting models should incorporate the divergence between the rate of
new COVID-19 cases versus new hospitalizations to better forecast near-term demand on the
health system.

Given that the test results and admissions data are available in nearly real time, health systems
based monitoring of admission rates and the doubling time of hospitalized patient counts can
provide accurate data for both public health planning and epidemiological modeling 3​​ .

days.

Recently detected COVID-19 cases are younger than those detected prior
to social distancing measures
As shown in Figure 3, between weeks 11 and 14 of the epidemic, there was no significant shift
in the age distribution of patients tested. However, the average age of COVID-19 positive
patients decreased (P-value = 0.0004) from 55.6 years [95% CI 53.0 - 58.3] prior to social
distancing (March 16th, week 11) to 49.8 years [95% CI 47.9 - 51.7] after two weeks of social
distancing (March 30th, week 14).

Compared to before social distancing, the mean length of stay of hospitalized cases and rate of
ICU admission was not significantly different (1.73 days shorter [95% CI -2.16, 5.62] and 4.1%
absolute increase [95% CI -30%, 38%], respectively) than two weeks after social distancing
(difference in means P-value = 0.378 and 0.810, respectively). Because the length of stay is
right-censored for patients still in the hospital, these estimates are corrected for censoring.

Discussion
While most epidemic simulation models use new case rates, no currently published model takes
into account the shifts in demographics of positive patients, which is a major determinant of
future hospital admission rates. If most new cases are younger, the corresponding need for
hospitalizations will also be lower. Over the course of five weeks, we did not find a significant
change in the age distribution of patients presenting with influenza like illness (ILI) and tested for
COVID-19, however we did find a significant shift towards younger patients in those testing
positive for COVID-19. The simplest explanation for the shift towards younger patients testing
positive could be relaxing testing criteria. For example, guidelines at our institution went from
requiring ILI symptoms and a known COVID-19 exposure, to expressing symptoms consistent
with ILI, to medical doctor discretion. However, this does not explain why there is no change in
the demographics of patients getting ​tested​ for COVID-19. A more plausible explanation is that
because of the SIP order, the at-risk elderly population is protected and hence less likely to
contract COVID-19. This interpretation is supported by the fact that despite seeing a larger
number of younger COVID-19 positive patients, those that need to be admitted have similar
ages, rate of ICU admission, and length of stay as before the SIP order; now we see fewer
absolute numbers of such cases.

Our analysis spanning 26 days after shelter-in-place clearly demonstrates that the rate of
confirmed cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions for COVID-19 has flattened. The
decrease in the rate of new hospitalizations began within 10 days after shelter-in-place was
initiated and continues today. Despite the decrease in hospitalizations, we continue to see new

patients presenting with influenza like illness (ILI) and younger patients testing positive for
COVID-19 indicating ongoing community spread; but perhaps in a lower risk population.

This analysis demonstrates how--compared to new case counts--new hospitalizations is a better
metric both for detecting the effect of SIP and for estimating the anticipated burden on the
18​
health system 10,11,​
​
. Our findings also suggest that existing surge planning efforts should

frequently recompute hospitalization doubling time because the change can be swift as seen in
our data​19​. Models that do not use local hospitalization rates as well as the age distribution of
the positive patients are likely to overestimate the resource burden of COVID-19.

Investments made in setting up data feeds prior to and immediately at the outset of this crisis
were critical to accessing such data quickly. Additionally, a unification of our IT organizations
across the School of Medicine and the Healthcare System, which completed in September
2019, proved to be immensely valuable enabling the setup of data access (such as to the
laboratory testing data) in a timely manner.

Given the relative ease of obtaining such data at a health system, these metrics can not only
help quantify the effects of state-mandated SIP, but also enable better planning of health
system capacity to aid any actions required to return to pre-crisis operations​20​. For any
reopening scenario, accurate projections of near-term health system capacity requirements are
essential​21​. Therefore, we must start using these easily available, and useful, inputs right away.
