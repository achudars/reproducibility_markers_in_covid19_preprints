Abstract

31

Objectives: To analyse temporal trends in SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG

32

throughout the four rounds of the nationwide seroepidemiologic study ENE-COVID

33

(April-November 2020), and to compare the fourth-round results of two immunoassays

34

detecting antibodies against nucleocapsid and to S protein receptor-binding domain

35

(RBD).

36

Methods: A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) was offered to all

37

participants in the first three rounds (Abbott; anti-nucleocapsid IgG). In the fourth round

38

we offered this test and a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) (Beckman; anti-

39

RBD IgG) to i) a randomly selected sub-cohort, ii) participants who were IgG-positive

40

in any of the three first rounds; and iii) participants who were IgG-positive in the fourth

41

round by point-of-care immunochromatography.

42

Results: Immunoassays involving 10,153 participants (82.2% of people invited to

43

donate samples) were performed in the fourth round. A total of 2595 participants

44

(35.1% of participants with immunoassay results in the four rounds) were positive for

45

anti-nucleocapsid IgG in at least one round. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG became

46

undetectable in 43.3% of participants with positive first-round results. Pneumonia was

47

more frequent in participants with anti-nucleocapsid IgG in all four rounds (11.2%) than

48

those in which IgG became undetectable (2.4%).

49

In fourth round, anti-nucleocapsid and anti-RBD IgG were detected in 5.5% and 5.4%

50

participants of the randomly selected sub-cohort, and in 26.6% and 25.9% participants

51

with at least one previous positive result, respectively. Agreement between techniques

52

was 90.3% (kappa: 0.72).

Introduction

58

As of February 14, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 had infected over 108 million people

59

worldwide, causing over 2.3 million deaths [1]. Molecular testing based on specific

60

nucleic acid amplification is the established method for early diagnosis of COVID-19

61

[2]. Most patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop antibodies to the surface spike

62

(S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, which are therefore used as antigens in clinical

63

serology assays. Such serologic assays are essential for developing and evaluating

64

vaccines, antibody therapies, and serologic surveys [3]. However, current data regarding

65

the longevity of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are inconsistent; some studies report a rapid

66

decrease in specific IgG within approximately 3 months after infection [4,5], whereas

67

others report IgG titers remaining stable over weeks or months [6-8].

68

Results from some serologic studies suggest differences in IgG behaviour depending

69

on the virus protein to which it is directed; thus, some evidence [9,10] indicates that

70

antibodies against N appear earlier than those directed against S but are less-protective

71

against SARS-CoV-2 infection [10]. Titers of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 appear

72

to higher in patients with severe disease than in those with mild or asymptomatic

73

disease [10,11], raising concerns about the impact of antibodies in the immune response

74

to SARS-CoV-2.

75

Several SARS-CoV-2 serologic surveys have been conducted to estimate the

76

proportion of the population exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and the durability of post-

77

infection antibody production [6,12]. One such study is the ENE-COVID nationwide

78

population-based longitudinal seroepidemiologic study in Spain [12]. Examining more

79

than 60,000 randomly selected individuals over four rounds between April and

80

November 2020, ENE-COVID covered the first and second pandemic waves in Spain.

81

Serologic follow-up of a large cohort of participants was possible for 7 months. The

82

general results revealed a national prevalence of 5–5.2% during the first wave of the

83

pandemic (April–June 2020) [12,13], raising to 9.9% if we considering positive cases at

84

any time between April and November [14].

85

The present study exploited the large and representative ENE-COVID project to i)

86

analyse evolutionary trends in the detection of anti–N protein IgG using an

87

immunoassay across the four rounds of the ENE-COVID study; and ii) describe the

88

comparative serological results obtained in the fourth round using two different

89

immunoassay formats to specifically detect anti–N protein and anti-RBD antibodies.

91

Methods

92

General study design and ENE-COVID study population

93

The ENE-COVID study is a nationwide, population-based cohort study of sero-

94

prevalence, the general objectives of which were to i) estimate the prevalence of

95

COVID-19 in the community-dwelling population of Spain by monitoring antibodies

96

against SARS-CoV-2, and ii) evaluate evolutionary trends of antibodies over time. The

97

design of ENE-COVID has been described elsewhere [12-14]. Briefly, 1,500 census

98

tracts, with up to 24 households per tract, were randomly selected via two-stage

99

sampling stratified by province and municipality size. The study invited around 95,000

100

people, including more than 68,000 participants in at least one of the first three rounds

101

and around 51,000 in the last one.

102

The ENE-COVID study was developed in two phases during 2020; phase one

103

included three rounds of analysis carried out during the first epidemic wave in Spain

104

(April 27–May 11; May 18–June 1; June 8–June 22). Phase two included a fourth round

105

developed during the second epidemic wave in the same cohort (November 16–29)

106

(Figure 1).

The serologic analyses carried out in ENE-COVID included direct rapid

111

immunochromatography examinations of finger-prick blood samples to detect IgG/IgM

112

against SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Orient Gene Biotech COVID-19 IgG/IgM, Orient Gene

113

technique, and, in the fourth round, a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) to

117

detect IgG against the RBD of S protein. The CMIA was used in all four rounds of the

118

study, whereas the CLIA was used only in round four.

Selection of participants for immunoassay analyses

139

Samples from all participants in the ENE-COVID study who agreed to donate a

140

blood sample (>85%) were examined using the Abbott CMIA in the first three rounds.

141

In the fourth round, both immunoassays (Abbott CMIA of and Beckman CLIA) were

142

used for serologic analyses of patient samples. However, blood sample collection in the

143

fourth round was limited to certain sub-groups of participants, as follows: a) a randomly

144

selected sub-cohort of 15% of the ENE-COVID cohort; b) participants who had an IgG-

145

positive result in any of the three first rounds either by CMIA or using the above-

146

mentioned rapid immunochromatography test; and c) participants who had a fourth-

147

round IgG-positive result by the rapid immunochromatography test [14]. Data are

148

included in this report for all participants who had CMIA results in the fourth round of

149

the ENE-COVID study.

150

Statistical analyses

151

The percentage of positive results by rounds, with 95% confidence intervals (CI),

152

was calculated. The level of agreement between the tests was evaluated using Cohen's

153

157

Evolution of results for IgG against N (Abbott CMIA) across the four rounds of ENE-

158

COVID

159

In the fourth round of the ENE-COVID study, blood samples were drawn by

160

venipuncture from a total of 10153 participants (82.2% of the participants invited to

161

donate a blood sample).

162

Abbott CMIA results were available for all four rounds in 7400 (72.9% of those

163

with CMIA in the fourth round) participants. Of these participants, 2595 (35.1%) had a

164

positive result in at least one of the four rounds. Of this sub-group, 537 (20.7%)

165

maintained detectable IgG levels across all four rounds, 875 (33.7%) did not have an

166

IgG-positive result in the first round but did exhibit positive results in later rounds, and

167

887 (34.2%) had detectable IgG in the first round, but the levels declined to

168

undetectable during the study (Table 1). The remaining 11.4% of this sub-group

169

presented atypical result sequences over the four rounds of ENE-COVID, with

170

negative/negative/positive/negative (n=163; 6.3% of all cases with at least one positive

171

result) and positive/positive/negative/positive (n=93; 3.6% of all cases with at least one

172

positive result) results sequences predominating.

173

Fifty-eight percent of participants (887/1530) who had a positive IgG result for N

174

protein in the first round evolved to seronegative for these antibodies throughout the

175

study (Table 1). Of these participants, 25.4% had a positive Beckman CLIA result for

176

IgG against the S protein RBD in the fourth round. Excluding these cases, in 43.3% of

177

participants positive for IgG to the N protein in the first round, neither IgG for N

178

(Abbott CMIA) nor IgG for the RBD (Beckman CLIA) were detected in the fourth

179

round (sero-reversion) (Table 1). As expected, the highest number of sero-reversions

180

occurred between the third and fourth rounds (467 cases, representing 70.5% of all sero-

181

reversion cases).

182

The percentage of participants who developed pneumonia was higher in patients

183

who were positive for IgG against N across all four rounds (11.2% [60/537]) than in

184

patients in which IgG against both N and the RBD of S became undetectable during the

185

study (2.4% [16/662]). Among participants with atypical result sequences, 11.8% of

186

those with positive/positive/negative/positive results developed pneumonia, where only

187

1.2% of patients with negative/negative/positive/negative results developed pneumonia.

188

Results of the fourth round of ENE-COVID

189

In the fourth round of the ENE-COVID study, serum samples of 10153 participants

190

were analysed using two high-performance serologic techniques. A total of 2032

191

participants met more than one inclusion criteria.

192

Table 2 summarizes the results of the Abbott CMIA (IgG against N protein) and

193

Beckman CLIA (IgG against the RBD of the S protein) in the participants of the fourth

194

round of the ENE-COVID study, classified according to the different sub-groups that

195

were invited to blood collection.

196

In the participants included in the randomly selected sub-cohort (n=5827), positive

197

IgG results were obtained for 321 (4.9%) and 315 (5.4%) participants by the Abbott and

198

Beckman immunoassays, respectively. Among participants with at least one positive

199

result in any of the three first rounds (n=3261), 867 (26.6%) and 846 (25.9%)

200

participants had a positive result for IgG against N (Abbott CMIA) and the RBD of S

201

(Beckman CLIA), respectively. These figures were 1093 (58.3%) and 2040 (62.5%) by

202

Abbott and Beckman immunoassays, respectively, in the sub-cohort of participants who

203

had a positive result by the rapid test in the fourth round (n=3263).

204

These high-performance immunoassays exhibited 90.3% agreement, with a Kappa

205

index of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.70–0.73). Cases in which there was lack of agreement

206

between the CMIA and CLIA (n = 985; 9.7%) were distributed almost equally between

207

those with a positive result for IgG against N (Abbott CMIA) and negative result for

208

IgG against the RBD of S (Beckman CLIA) (51.5%), and vice versa (48.5%).

209

In the fourth round, agreement between rapid test and CMIA was 83.5% (Kappa index:

210

0.58; 95% CI: 0.56-0.60), and between rapid test and CLIA was 86.4% (Kappa index:

211

0.66; 95% CI: 0.64-0.67).

212

Participants who had positive results by both immunoassays in the fourth round

213

suffered pneumonia more frequently (11.3% [194/1713]) than participants who had only

214

one positive immunoassay result in the fourth round (5.8% [57/985]).

215

Discussion

216

Two important findings emerged from the results of the present study. First, our data

217

suggest that a substantial percentage of the population infected with SARS-CoV-2 may

218

exhibit negative serologic test results in the months following infection. Second, we

219

observed heterogeneity in the immunologic response regarding production of IgG

220

against either the SARS-CoV-2 N protein or S protein RBD. These data were derived

221

from analyses of a large cohort of non-hospitalized participants randomly selected from

222

the general population tested four times over a period of 7 months.

223

Declines in the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the months following

224

infection have been described by previous studies involving smaller populations

225

[11,19]. In a recent study of 156 healthcare personnel in the USA [19], 93.6% exhibited

226

a decrease in antibody levels after 60 days, and in 28.2% of cases, IgG against SARS-

227

CoV-2 became undetectable. Sero-reversion occurred in 50% of asymptomatic infected

228

individuals in that study [19]. Our representative population study shows an evolution

229

toward un-detectability of IgG over the 7 months of the study in 43.3% of participants

230

with positive first-round results. However, this finding is not necessarily indicative of a

231

reduction in immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Although protective immunity against

11

232

SARS-CoV-2 is not well defined in humans, the immune memory associated with

233

memory T and B cells could generate long-term protective immunity, as occurs with

234

other infectious diseases [20,21]. Another study that examined different indicators of

235

circulating immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 in 188 COVID-19 patients [11] detected

236

at least three indicators of immunologic memory in 95% of participants with 5–8

237

months of symptom onset, indicating that long-lasting immunity against a second

238

SARS-CoV-2 infection is a real possibility in most individuals. Indeed, although cases

239

of re-infection have been documented [22,23], they are rare from a global epidemiologic

240

perspective. Studies carried out specifically to identify cases of symptomatic re-

241

infection in large cohorts of patients did not report any such cases [24,25].

242

The lower frequency of pneumonia among those in which IgG levels became

243

undetectable in the present study is consistent with observations confirmed in recent

244

studies [11,15,26,27].

245

Recent studies described the predominance of S-specific versus N-specific

246

antibodies in individuals with mild versus severe disease, respectively [10,28]. This

247

difference suggests that a strong humoral response to S could limit the effect of viral

248

infection. In the ENE-COVID study, no association between increased disease severity

249

and an imbalance in humoral immunity to the N protein versus the RBD of the S protein

250

was observed.

251

Although antibodies against N appear earlier than antibodies against S [9,10], the

252

latter seem to be more stable over time. Bearing this in mind, the discordance between

253

the detection of IgG against N versus IgG against the RBD of S may be associated with

254

how recent infection occurred, such that IgG against the RBD of S were not yet

255

detectable in cases of more recent infection, or in cases of long evolution after infection,

256

in which levels of IgG against the N protein had decreased to un-detectability.

257

Alternatively, these apparent discrepancies could also be explained by the

258

heterogeneous antibody response of COVID-19 patients, likely involving various as yet

259

unidentified factors, in addition to disease severity [11,27]. In our study, development

260

of pneumonia was correlated with the simultaneous presence of IgG against both N and

261

the RBD of S.

262

A number of cases in the present study (n=256; 9.9%) with atypical result sequences

263

across the four rounds were mainly due to discrepant results in the third round with

264

respect to the other three rounds. Taking into account the temporal distribution of the

265

ENE-COVID rounds in relation to the first waves of the pandemic in Spain (Figure 1),

these cases could be explained by several scenarios: i) antibody levels at the detection

267

limit thresholds of the serologic assays used in the study, ii) mild infections in the third

268

round in which the level of antibodies decreased in the fourth round, or iii) cases with a

269

new contact with the virus between the third and fourth rounds, which would have led

270

to reactivation of the immune system via memory cells. It should be noted that the high

271

percentage of patients developing reporting pneumonia (11.8%) among cases of positive

272

determinations in all rounds except the third round was very similar to that of cases with

273

positive determinations in all rounds (11.2%).

274

Our data show two remarkable findings: i) a substantial percentage of SARS-CoV-

275

2–infected patients may have negative serologic test results in the months following

276

infection, and ii) the serologic IgG response to SARS-CoV-2 targets is heterogeneous

277

and conditioned by disease severity.
