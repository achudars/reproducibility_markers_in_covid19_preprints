ABSTRACT
Epidemiological models have provided valuable information for
the outlook of COVID-19 pandemic and relative impact of different
mitigation scenarios. However, more accurate forecasts are often
needed at near term for planning and staffing. We present our early
results from a systemic analysis of short-term adjustment of
epidemiological modeling of COVID 19 pandemic in US during
March-April 2020. Our analysis includes the importance of various
types of features for short term adjustment of the predictions. In
addition, we explore the potential of data augmentation to address
the data limitation for an emerging pandemic. Following published
literature, we employ data augmentation via clustering of regions
and evaluate a number of clustering strategies to identify early
patterns from the data.
From our early analysis, we used CovidActNow as our underlying
epidemiological model and found that the most impactful features
for the one-day prediction horizon are population density, workers
in commuting flow, number of deaths in the day prior to prediction
date, and the autoregressive features of new COVID-19 cases from
three previous dates of the prediction. Interestingly, we also found
that counties clustered with New York County resulted in best
preforming model with maximum of R2= 0.90 and minimum of

*

R2=0.85 for state-based and COVID-based clustering strategy,
respectively.

INTRODUCTION
The novel Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was first detected in
Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019 and by early January 2020,
it spread to 21 countries. The first case in the United States (US)
was reported on January 21, 2020 in Snohomish County in the state
of Washington [1]. By the middle of March 2020, the number of
COVID-19 infected cases started to peak up in the US [2], inducing
panic about potential shortages of hospital capacities and supplies.
As more cases were detected in the US, many epidemiological
models, which had been mainly developed for other pandemics
such as influenza and season-long forecasting, started to adjust to
and project COVID-19 growth patterns. Due to the critical role of
forecasting COVID-19 in helping policymaker for future planning,
the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has initiated
an effort for forecasting in form of challenge with the participation
of several of the epidemiological models [3].

S. Kefayati et al.
Although overall epidemiological models have been useful for
understanding the future outlook of COVID-19 pandemic, they
often have been criticized for overestimating the projections and
inducing uncertainties [4]. The limitations in predicting future
cases of COVID-19 stems from a combination of limited
understanding and a lack of data about its infectious spread pattern
due to its novel nature. Beside data limitations, region-specific
factors were often not accounted-for in many published
epidemiological models of the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors such
as age distribution, comorbidities, and pre-excising conditions, as
well as socioeconomic factors, are expected to play role in the
severity and duration of this disease.
Given the importance of COVID-19 forecasting and considering
the majority of epidemiological models are best suited for longterm projections, in this work rather than developing a new
forecasting model, we aim at improving the overestimated
projected numbers from epidemiological models on a short-term
basis based on machine learning. In particular, we conducted a
systematic analysis to study the importance of various data
elements for our short-term prediction. Our predictive modeling
included a carefully selected 40 geo-specific features for the US
counties.
A previous study by Liu et al. on machine learning-based
predictions of COVID-19 outbreak in China, showed that modeling
for the regions clustered together based on geo-specific similarities
resulted in improved predictive performance for majority of China
provinces [5]. In this work, we studied four different clustering
strategies, primarily based on demographic similarities, COVID
activity trends, state boundaries, as well as a national cluster, to
examine the effects of these boundary conditions in predictive
power of our model.
Our main contribution is investigating the role of machine learning
to adjust the short-term epidemiological projections with the
ultimate aim of helping counties and hospitals better plan their
resources. We are also investigating which additional regionspecific features play a role in short-term adjustments of the
COVID-19 projections.

1 RESULTS
For historical epidemiological projection, we used the
CovidActNow model as one of the early epidemiological models
that became opensource [6]. For the data augmentation purpose, we
considered four clustering strategies: one national cluster including
all the counties in our training set, second clustering based on
counties state boundary, and another two clustering strategies were
based on counties similarities in COVID-19 spread characteristics
and demographic information as described in the Methods section.
The epidemiological historical projections were one-day ahead on
any given day during March 23rd-April 20th, 2020 period. We
trained an individual date-dependent models for each of the clusters
within each clustering strategy. The out-of-sample test sets were
evaluated from April 6th to April 19th, 2020 individually each with
the date-appropriate trained model (the total of 14 date-dependent

models for each cluster). The comparison and the impact of the four
different clustering boundary conditions is shown in Table 1.
Regardless of the clustering strategy, our one-day-ahead prediction
showed ~97% uplift compared to the epidemic projection with the
same one-day-ahead horizon. Overall, the performance of the
models based on each clustering strategy was similar.

Also consistent across all four different clustering strategies, the
best model performance was achieved for the cluster in which New
York County was included. Figure 1 shows the comparison of our
model output to the CovidActNow projected “all infected” cases
both compared with the ground truth (i.e., estimated all infected)
for three example counties which clustered together with New York
County for two different clustering strategies. Both COVID-based
and demographic-based clustering achieved 97% uplift compared
to the epidemiological projections for the cluster model that
included New York County.
Closer assessment of two major counties of New York and Los
Angeles further revealed the similarities of four different clustering
strategies, particularly for New York County as shown in Figure 2.
The best performing cluster model for New York County was found
to be state-based clustering with R2= 0.90. Los Angeles County
was obtained from the COVID-based clustering method, which
follows similar trajectory as the national clustering with
comparable RMSE (676.34 and 695.61, respectively). Stateclustered model showed highest deviation with RMSE = 1249.78,
followed by second highest RMSE = 723.75 from the demographicbased clustering model. We found that the level of COVID-19
inactivity or low activity in the cluster impacted the performance
for the corresponding model. For example, comparing two of the
clusters containing Los Angeles County from two different
clustering strategies, the state-based cluster contained 36% zero
cases as opposed to only 2% zero cases in the COVID-based
cluster.
As LASSO gives spare weights by driving small weights to zero,
we can detect the most predictive features of our model. As walkforward split expands by every date and more training data gets
included in the split, fewer features become prominent. For the
national model, as shown in Figure 3, the most impactful features
for the last trained model were population density, and the
autoregressive features of new COVID cases from three previous
date of the prediction.

Machine Learning Adjustment of COVID-19 Projections
CovidActNow projections is eliminated. Other features had small
weights (either negative or positive) and eventually weighted to
zero for the last trained model. Similarly, we found that population
density and three autoregressive features were the most important
(non-zero and positive) features for the majority including best
performing clusters, for other clustering strategies. For the
demographic-based clustering due to homogeneous distribution of
the, regardless of the date of trained model, none of the
demographic features carried any weight with the exception of the
population density and workers in commuting flow. Overall, no
particular pattern was detected for the role of race and sex with few
exceptions. For instance, the proportion of non-Hispanic black
population showed positive predictive impact for the State of
Wisconsin with the state-based clustering approach. For feature
importance map of other three clustering strategy please refer to
APPENDIX II.

2 Methods
For the purpose of data augmentation, we considered grouping
counties four different ways to ensure the that the scarcity of
available training data during early period of COVID-19 pandemic
(window considered March 23rd-April 20th, 2020) did not impact
the model performance. One grouping included counties of each of
the US states, yielding 51 individual trained models. Another
national approach involved grouping all the counties together and
training one model for all. The two other groupings were conducted
by clustering the counties based on their similarities in COVID-19
spread characteristics and demographic information as described
below.

2.1 Clustering Strategy

Figure 1: One-day-horizon predictions from our machine
learning model and from the CovidActNow epidemiological
model both compared to the ground truth for two different
clustering strategies: a) one of the 12 clusters of the COVIDbased clustering with 49 counties in the cluster, and b) one of
the 6 clusters of the demographic-based clustering with 259
counties in the cluster.
In the first trained model (with the least training data), in addition
to population density and autoregressive features, workers in
commuting flow and cumulative number of cases had positive
predictive effects on predicting the next day’s infected cases. In
contrast, population and next day projected cases from the
CovidActNow output had negative predictive power. We speculate
the negative predictive power of CovidActNow is due to its
increasing trend as opposed to ground truth that has downward
trend generally. It is also important to note for the first trained
model (first expanding window iteration) with limited training data,
LASSO attempts to distribute the weights to more features. As the
training data expands in the last trained window, the effect of

Clustering was conducted based on agglomerative hierarchal
clustering algorithm (scikit-learn package), which is a bottom-up
approach merging counties based on their similarities until reaching
one big cluster. The optimal number of clusters was obtained by
maximizing Calinski-Harabasz score.
The counties were clustered based on their demographic
information for which the optimization yielded 6 clusters. Features
included race, ethnicity, gender, elderly (age > 65 years) and young
(age < 18 years) population, total and density of population, county
traffic volume, county average commute flow, as well as Area
Deprivation Index, rankings of counties by socioeconomic status
disadvantage [7].
Counties were also separately clustered based on time-varying
COVID-19 characteristics, resulting in 12 dissimilar clusters.
Features included reciprocal doubling time based on the growth
during the selected time window, the pattern of the growth curve
(logistic, exponential or none), cumulative cases on April 20th,
2020, and number of days stayed at home since the stay-at-home
order for each county. Maps of the clustered US counties based on
their demographic and COVID-19 activity similarities are available
in APPENDIX I.

2.2 Epidemiological Projections
The Coronavirus Act Now model is SEIR model, one of the main
groups of epidemiological models used by epidemiologists and
researchers to project the evolution of a disease. The model works
by categorizing the population at various states and modeling as the
population moves through susceptible (S), individuals becoming
exposed (E) to the virus, then infected (I), and infected population
either recovering (R) or dying (D). To model hospitalization and
need for ICU bed, the infected cases were categorized into three
levels of disease severity: mild (no hospitalization), moderate
(requiring hospitalization), or severe (requiring ICU bed)1.
For the earlier version of the ActNow model, caseload data
(number of confirmed cases and death) were updated daily from the
Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for Systems Science and
Engineering’s Coronavirus Tracking Dashboard [8] with the
county-level data becoming available as of March 22nd, 2020.
We used “all infected” projection (including mild, moderate, and
1

As of April 12th, 2020, the ActNow model has gone through an update and
“asymptomatic individuals” category has been added to the model. However, the

severe cases) output of the CovidActNow model to compare with
our machine learning forecasting. In order to compare our model
results with CovidActNow, we used the same ground truth as
CovidActNow [6]. In the earlier version of the ActNow model1, the
ground truth for the “all infected” (i.e. estimated all infected) was
derived as follow: “estimated recovered” was estimated from actual
COVID cases report (JHU) shifted by 13 days. The “estimated
recovered” cases together with total number of deceased
populations on a given date gives an estimate of active cases. Due
to lack of reported data on hospitalization at the county level,
CovidActNow then estimates that a quarter of the “estimated
active” cases are hospitalized. And finally, that “estimated
hospitalization” is about 7.3% of “estimated all infected” (mild,
moderate, and severe) cases. Thus, we used “estimated all infected”
as the ground truth to compare our forecasting to the ActNow
model projections.
The one-day-horizon CovidActNow historical projections were
obtained by running a model for every day during March 23rd-April
20th, 2020 period and selecting the next-day projections yielding 28
days datapoints. Since the ActNow model produced several
intervention scenarios, for each date, we selected the output that
matched the actual in-place intervention. We obtained the
intervention policies for each state from The New York Times
website. For some of the states, the policies were not held statewide, thus scraped those individual county policies from various
news outlets.

projections used in this study are the outputs of the model prior to this change and thus
do not include asymptomatic cases.

Machine Learning Adjustment of COVID-19 Projections

2.3 Predictive Model
For the predictive modeling, we fitted our data to a LASSO model,
a multivariate linear model with L1-norm regularization
(penalizing the absolute sum of the model coefficients). The feature
vector included both time-dependent and static features for each
county. The time-dependent were COVID-19 dependent features
both from the epidemiological model output and from JHU
reported parameters. The time-independent features were
demographic and characteristics of each county. In total, static and
time-varying, 40 features were included in our model. For the list
of the features and their sources please refer to APPENDIX III.
The number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases for the next day
was then predicted based on:
&

+,

𝑦!"# = $ 𝛼$ 𝑦!%$ + 𝛽𝑑! + 𝛾𝑖!"# + 𝛿𝐶! + $ 𝜇* 𝑆*
$'(

*'#

Where 𝑦!"# , 𝑦! , 𝑦!%# , and 𝑦!%& are the new confirmed cases for
the next day, same date, the day before, and two days prior of date
t. 𝑑! refers to the new death number at date t; 𝑖!"# is the new “all
infected” cases projected for next day at date t from the
epidemiological model, and 𝐶! is the cumulative number of
COVID-19 cases on date t. 𝑆* refers to collection of 34 static
features including, population density, county commute flow, age,
gender, race, socioeconomic features such as unemployment and
Area Deprivation Index, as well as disease prevalence and
comorbidities.
Due to time-series nature and daily update of the data, a walkforward with expanding window validation fashion was considered
resulting in 15 splits with one day horizon and initial training
window of 10 days. Since the split was performed according to the
date of data, each cluster yielded 15 sets consistently; however,
depending on number of counties in each cluster, different traintest splits were expected for each cluster. The total of 1578 counties
were included in this study each with feature vector of size 40. To
compare the predicted outcome of our model with the
epidemiological projected cases, the predicted new confirmed cases
were then summed with the JHU-reported “cumulative number of
cases” from the previous date, and then converted to “estimated all
infected” according to the conversion used in the CovidActNow
model.
The best model parameters, including LASSO alpha, were selected
in a Grid search manner. To simulate the real-life scenario in which
the last trained model needs to be updated daily as the new data
comes in, the model trained on the first n-1 splits (n=2, 3, 4, …15),
was
evaluated
on
the
test
set
of
nth
split
(i.e. out-of-sample test set).

3 CONCLUSIONS
Our machine learning results showed significant improvement over
the epidemiological projection with a one-day prediction horizon.
Although small, the changes in model performance was detectable
based on different clustering strategies. Assessing New York

County, for example, we found state-based clustering achieved the
highest performance for the state of New York (R2 = 0.90).
However, state-based clustering resulted in lowest performance for
overall counties compared to other strategies (Table 1). This
finding suggests an advantage to considering training individual
models based on the geographic region.
The results shown for our model are from March-April 2020 period
of time, a time of dramatic increases in COVID-19 spread in major
cities with subsequent implementation of mitigation strategies,
such as stay-at-home policies with California first to enforce such
a policy on March 19th, 2020. Our findings of different clustering
strategies and feature importance were likely due to the highly
dynamic nature of infectious spread and local policies at this time.
Moreover, as more data has become available over time,
epidemiological models are also improving and more scenarios are
considered in the modeling methods, such as the impact of
asymptomatic cases in the recent version of the ActNow model.
It is also important to note that for this work, our prediction is short
and limited to one-day horizon. Although, it is not expected that all
of the 40 features that we have included have predictive power, we
suspect with longer prediction horizon, demographic and geospecific features will have important roles.
With initially flattening and now new rises in the pandemic curve,
we plan to expand our modeling prediction horizon to as long as
two weeks ahead. Some of the challenges that we foresee with
longer prediction horizon is the policy changes as the states would
go through different phases of reopening. We suspect for longer
prediction horizon, more COVID-specific trends for each state as
well as information about the upcoming policies can improve the
predictive powers. Also, we intend to incorporate several
epidemiological models’ outputs to study their difference and
impact in our modeling.
