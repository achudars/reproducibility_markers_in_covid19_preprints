KEY POINTS
Question: Is there SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in the human milk of lactating women after COVID-19
vaccination?
Findings: In this prospective observational study that included 22 lactating women, we found SARS-CoV2 specific IgA in the human milk in response to the COVID-19 vaccination series. There is statistically
significant secretion of SARS-CoV-2 IgA in human milk after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series
completion (p < 0.0001).
Meaning: Newborn immunologic defense is present but immature. SARS-CoV-2 IgA secreted in the
human milk could potentially provide COVID-19 protection to nursing infants. These results could guide
a strategy for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among lactating women.

ABSTRACT
Importance: In 2019, a deadly virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), responsible for COVID-19, emerged. In December 2020, two mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines
were approved for use in the United States (US) which provide immunity to those receiving the vaccine.
Maternally derived antibodies are a key element of infants' immunity. Certain vaccines given to
pregnant and lactating mothers provide immunity to infants through transmission across the placenta,
umbilical cord (IgG) and human milk (IgA). Human milk produced by mothers with a history of COVID-19
infection contains SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG.
Objective: To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulins are found in human milk after
the COVID-19 vaccination, and to characterize the types of immunoglobulins present.
Design, setting, and participants: This is a prospective observational study conducted at Shands
Hospital, University of Florida from December 2020 to March 2021. Twenty-two lactating healthcare
workers who received the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/BioNtech or Moderna) made up the sample
group. Plasma and human milk were collected at three-time points (pre-vaccination, post-first vaccine
dose, and post-second vaccine dose). SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG in human milk and in plasma were
measured by ELISA. Maternal demographics was compiled.
Exposures: Pfizer/BioNtech or Moderna vaccination.
Main outcome and measure: Levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG in human milk and plasma.
Results: We found significant secretion of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG in human milk and plasma
after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
Conclusions and relevance: Our results show that the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines induce SARSCoV-2 specific IgA and IgG secretion in human milk. Further studies are needed to determine the
duration of this immune response, its capacity to neutralize the COVID-19 virus, the transfer of passive

immunity to breastfeeding infants, and the potential therapeutic use of human milk IgA to combat SARSCoV-2 infections and COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
In 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged, causing an outbreak
of COVID-19 disease responsible for over 2.5 million deaths worldwide. In response, two mRNA
vaccines, the BNT162b2 Pfizer/BioNTech and mRNA-1273 Moderna/NIH, emerged in record time and
were approved for emergency use in the United States. Both vaccines contain mRNA encapsulated in a
lipid nanoparticle, encoding SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Data indicate that two repeated parenteral
injections are generally safe and induce strong protein-specific antibody responses as well as CD4+ and
CD8+ T cell responses.1 Preliminary reports for the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines phase I/II trials
showed significant SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response after vaccination series completion, similar to
those observed in convalescent human serum samples of diagnosed COVID-19 individuals.2,3 Also, two
doses of either SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccines were safe and provided 94-95% efficacy against
symptomatic COVID-19 in persons 18 and older.4,5
Vaccinating pregnant or lactating mothers is a strategy to protect young infants from disease.6 In
general, vaccines mediate protection through the induction of antigen-specific antibodies. Some
vaccines, such as Rotavirus, oral Polio, and nasal Influenza, induce serum IgA and secretory IgA
production.7 Vaccination against pertussis in the second/third trimester of pregnancy or immediately
postpartum significantly increases the levels of anti-pertussis secretory IgA in human milk.6
As per the American Academy of Pediatrics report from February 2021, children represent up to 13%
of the total cumulative cases of COVID-19, with up to 3% of those requiring hospitalization and up to
0.25% resulting in death.8 For these reasons, there is an urgent need to study human milk for SARS-CoV-

2 specific antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination and, more importantly, its possible extended
protection to breastfeeding infants.
In human milk, 90% of total immunoglobin is secretory IgA, along with 8% IgM and 2% IgG. Mother's
milk immunoglobulins delivered to infants during breastfeeding are crucial in shaping and modulating
immature infants' immune system and play an essential role in neutralization and agglutination
processes, limiting the ability of pathogens to infect or persist.9
Although several studies demonstrate that milk produced by mothers, previously infected by COVID-19
is a source of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies, 10–12 there is a paucity of data related
to vaccination. Two studies demonstrating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG in human
milk following the COVID-19 vaccine are currently under peer review.13,14
This study's primary purpose is to determine the presence of specific SARS-CoV-2 IgA in the human milk
of lactating women after the COVID-19 vaccine administration. We hypothesize that the COVID-19
vaccine will elicit the production of SARS-CoV-2 IgA in human milk that could be passively transferred to
breastfeeding infants.

METHODS
Study design
This University of Florida IRB-approved (protocol #202003255) study includes 22 lactating healthcare
workers, after COVID-19 vaccine administration from December 2020 to March 2021. Please see
supplemental methods for inclusion criteria, participants, and procedures.

Sample collection and processing

Blood and human milk samples were collected at three-time points guided by the preliminary data from
Pfizer/BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine2: pre-vaccination (TP1), 15-30 days post the first dose of vaccine
(TP2), and 7-10 days post-second dose of vaccine (TP3). (See supplementary results)

Statistical analysis
The focus of this analysis was change in titer levels over time and differences in changes between
vaccine types.15 A mixed-effects repeated-measures modeling approach, which accommodates missing
data, was used to model change in log (10)-transformed antibody titer for SARS-CoV-2 specific and total
IgG/IgA in plasma and human milk over time (at pre-vaccination, post 1st and post
2nd dose). (Detailed Statistical analysis present in supplemental)

RESULTS
Twenty-two lactating health care workers with no known history of COVID-19 infection were enrolled in
the study. Of those, 21 completed the three-time sample collection for human milk: pre-vaccination
(TP1), post 1st vaccine (TP2), and post 2nd vaccine (TP3). The study population consisted primarily of
White, non-Hispanic women in their mid-30s working in the healthcare setting. Seven participants
received the Moderna vaccine and 14 received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (Table 1).

SARS-CoV-2 IgA is present in plasma and secreted in human milk after COVID-19 vaccination.

SARS-CoV-2 IgA concentration in human milk was grouped and compared between the 3 time
points. IgA statistically significantly increased from TP1 to TP2 (p < 0.0007) and from TP1 to TP3 (p <
0.0001) (Figure 1) in the overall group of participants. Eighty-five percent of participants had a positive
result for SARS-CoV-2 IgA after vaccination series completion based on the established cutoff value
(mean + 2SD of pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 IgA concentration values) (Table 2); this result coincides
with the IgA response to the natural infection (76-80%).10–12

SARS-CoV-2 IgA in plasma also significantly increased 7-10 days after vaccination series
completion and was positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 IgA in human milk (p < 0.0001)
(Supplementary Table 2).

SARS-CoV-2 IgG is secreted in human milk after COVID-19 vaccination

We tested human milk for SARS-CoV-2 IgG at the three-time points in 10 participants. One hundred
percent of the human milk samples were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG by TP3 based on
the established cutoff value (Table 2). There was a statistically significant increase of IgG from TP1 to
TP2 (p < 0.0006) and TP1 to TP3 (p < 0.0001) (Figure 1) (Supplementary Table 2). The concentration of
SARS-CoV-2 IgA was higher than those of IgG in the human milk, with a predominance of SARS-CoV-2
IgA, as found in natural infection.10–12
3.

Plasma samples are positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG after COVID-19 vaccination.

As expected, based on the preliminary reports for Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines,2,3 SARS-CoV-2
IgG is detected in plasma after the first and second dose of the mRNA vaccines with a peak level 7-10
days after the second vaccine. We also found a positive correlation between plasma and breastmilk IgG
levels (p = 0.043). (Figure 1) (Supplementary table 3)
Levels of total IgA in human milk and Total IgG in plasma, were indistinguishable at all three-time points,
as anticipated. (Supplementary Figure 3).

4. Similar antibody response to Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna vaccines was detected.
Both mRNA vaccines generated statistically significant SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG in breastmilk and
plasma by TP3. There is a significantly higher mean of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in plasma at TP3 in Pfizer vs.
Moderna vaccinated mothers (p = 0.005). (Supplementary Table 2).

DISCUSSION
Our results show that the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna, induce SARSCoV-2 IgA and IgG secretion in human milk, with statistically significant increases from TP1 to TP3 (p <
0.0001 for IgA and p = 0.0002 for IgG). There is a predominant IgA response in human milk, as expected
based on human milk antibody composition, and similar to the natural infection results.10–12 However,
these results contrast with recent studies presented at medRxiv for peer review.13,14
The peak of SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG in human milk and plasma occurs 7-10 days after receiving the
second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The peak of vaccine-induced antibody titers is but one part of
antibody-mediated protection. The quality of such antibodies (e.g., their avidity, specificity,
or neutralizing capacity) also contribute to efficacy.7 Further functional studies are needed to determine
antibody neutralization capability and clinical relevance.
The samples analyzed represent only one time point of what is likely a dynamic immune response.
Samples collected in the first 2 weeks after the second vaccine administration may not reflect the
maximal immune response. Long-term follow-up is needed to understand the kinetics of this response,
particularly the longevity of antibody presence.
Our data show higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG among mothers who received the Pfizer vaccine. However,
statistical significance does not imply clinical relevance, and these results indicate that further, more
extensive studies need to be conducted to confirm any findings.
There was not a statistically significant relationship between maternal demographics and the level of
SARS-CoV-2 IgA in human milk (supplementary Table 3). Interestingly, participant C-190204 showed the
highest concentration of SARS-CoV-2 IgA in the human milk (12 times higher than the mean of IgA postvaccination) and was the only participant tandem breastfeeding her two children. Previous findings
show a strong positive correlation between secretory IgA concentrations and lactation duration.9 Future

studies, including twins, would be of interest, and a larger sample size with a broader demographic
distribution is needed to generalize these results.
These novel results suggest the potential transfer of protective antibodies to nursing infants after
maternal COVID-19 vaccination and may show a promising influence in vaccination strategy for lactating
mothers.
