Abstract
We model the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic in South Korea, Italy, France, and Germany. We
use early reported case data to predict the cumulative number of reported cases to a final size. The
key features of our model are the timing of implementation of major public policies restricting social
movement, the identification and isolation of unreported cases, and the impact of asymptomatic
infectious cases.

Introduction

In a previous work [2], we developed a model of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. The purpose of
the model was to predict forward in time the future number of cases in a time-line of the epidemic from
early reported case data. The model in [2] focused on the Chinese government imposed public policies
designed to contain the epidemic. Our goal here is to apply this analysis to the COVID-19 epidemics
in South Korea, Italy, France, and Germany. In an early phase of the epidemic, the reported case data
grows exponentially, which corresponds to a constant transmission rate. We assume that government
measures and public awareness cause this early constant transmission rate to change to a time dependent
exponentially decreasing rate. We identify the early constant transmission rate using a method developed
in [1]. We then identify the time dependent exponentially decreasing transmission rate from reported
case data, and project forward the time-line of the epidemic course. We refer to [3, 4] for more results
about this topic.
Our model incorporates the following essential ingredients of COVID-19 epidemics: (1) the number
of asymptomatic infectious individuals (with very mild or no symptoms), (2) the number of symptomatic
reported infectious individuals (with severe symptoms) and (3) the number of symptomatic unreported
infectious individuals (with mild symptoms).
COVID-19 epidemics can be decomposed into three phases:
Phase I: The first phase of the epidemic corresponds to a linear growth in the number of reported cases,
where the number of daily reported case is almost constant day after day;
Phase II: The second phase of the epidemic corresponds to an exponential increasing phase, where the
number of cases grows exponentially, corresponding to a constant transmission rate.
Phase III: The third phase of the epidemic corresponds to a time dependent exponentially decreasing
transmission rate, due to major public interventions and social distancing measures.
Our analysis identifies the epidemics in South Korea, Italy, France, and Germany as Phase III. Our

Model
The model consists of the following system of ordinary differential equations:
 0
S (t) = −τ (t)S(t)[I(t) + U (t)],



I 0 (t) = τ (t)S(t)[I(t) + U (t)] − νI(t),

R0 (t) = ν1 I(t) − ηR(t),


 0
U (t) = ν2 I(t) − ηU (t).

(3.1)

This system is supplemented by initial data
S(t0 ) = S0 > 0, I(t0 ) = I0 > 0, R(t0 ) = 0 and U (t0 ) = U0 ≥ 0.

(3.2)

Here t ≥ t0 is time in days, t0 is the beginning date of the model of the epidemic, S(t) is the number of
individuals susceptible to infection at time t, I(t) is the number of asymptomatic infectious individuals
at time t, R(t) is the number of reported symptomatic infectious individuals at time t, and U (t) is the
number of unreported symptomatic infectious individuals at time t.
The transmission rate at time t is τ (t). Asymptomatic infectious individuals I(t) are infectious for an
average period of 1/ν days. Reported symptomatic individuals R(t) are infectious for an average period
of 1/η days, as are unreported symptomatic individuals U (t). We assume that reported symptomatic
infectious individuals R(t) are reported and isolated immediately, and cause no further infections. The
asymptomatic individuals I(t) can also be viewed as having a low-level symptomatic state. All infections
are acquired from either I(t) or U (t) individuals. The fraction f of asymptomatic infectious become
reported symptomatic infectious, and the fraction 1 − f become unreported symptomatic infectious.
The rate asymptomatic infectious become reported symptomatic is ν1 = f ν, the rate asymptomatic
infectious become unreported symptomatic is ν2 = (1 − f ) ν, where ν1 + ν2 = ν. The cumulative
number of reported cases at time t is given by the formula
Z t
CR(t) = ν1

and the cumulative number of unreported at time t is given by the formula

Method to estimate the parameters

We assume f = 0.6 or f = 0.1, which means that 40% or 90% of symptomatic infectious cases
go unreported. The actual value of f is unknown. We assume η = 1/7, which means that the average
period of infectiousness of both unreported symptomatic infectious individuals and reported symptomatic
infectious individuals is 7 days. We assume ν = 1/7, which means that the average period of infectiousness
of asymptomatic infectious individuals is 7 days. These values can be modified as further epidemiological
information becomes known.
We assume that in the second phase of a COVID-19 epidemic, the cumulative number of reported
cases CR(t) grows approximately exponentially, according to the formula:
CR(t) = χ1 exp(χ2 t) − χ3 , t ≥ t0 .

(4.1)

We fix the value χ3 = 1. The values of χ1 and χ2 are fitted to cumulative reported case data in the
early phase of the epidemic, when it is recognized that CR(t) is growing exponentially (i.e. we use an
exponential fit χ1 exp(χ2 t) to fit the data CR(t) + 1). We assume the initial value S0 , corresponds to
the population of the region of the reported case data. The value of the susceptible population S(t) is
assumed to be only slightly changed by removal of the number of people infected in the beginning of the
second phase. The other initial conditions are

These formulas for I0 , U0 , t0 , τ0 , and R0 were derived in [1]. Their numerical values, which are technically
theoretic, are essential for identification of the exponential growth rate of CR(t) in the second phase.
During the second phase τ (t) ≡ τ0 is constant. When strong government measures such as isolation,
quarantine, and public closings are implemented, the third phase begins. The actual effects of these

measures are complex, and we use an exponential decrease for a time-dependent decreasing transmission
rate τ (t) in the third phase to incorporate these effects. The formula for τ (t) during the third phase is
(
τ (t) = τ0 , 0 ≤ t ≤ N,
(4.6)
τ (t) = τ0 exp (−µ (t − N )) , N < t.
The date N and the value of µ are chosen so that the cumulative reported cases in the numerical
simulation of the epidemic aligns with the cumulative reported case data after day N , when the public
measures take effect. In this way we are able to project forward the time-path of the epidemic after the
government imposed public restrictions take effect. We illustrate τ (t) in Figure 3 for a typical case.

The daily number of reported cases from the model can be obtained by computing the solution of
the following equation:
DR0 (t) = ν f I(t) − DR(t), for t ≥ t0 and DR(t0 ) = DR0 .

Conclusion

We have applied a method developed in [1] and [2] to predict the evolution of a COVID-19 epidemic in
a geographical region, based of reported case data in that region. Our method uses early data, when the
epidemic is in its second phase and growing exponentially, corresponding to a constant transmission rate.
In [1] we demonstrated a method to identify this constant transmission rate. When public measures are
begun in order to ameliorate the epidemic, a third phase begins, which we model with a time-dependent
exponentially decreasing transmission rate in [2]. In [2] we applied this method to mainland China, and
demonstrated the ability of our model to predict the forward time-line of the epidemic. In Figure 4 in
[2], we showed how the prediction unfolded week by week, with increasing agreement with reported case

data, in mainland China.
In this work we use the cumulative number of reported cases, the daily number of reported cases, and
the weekly number of reported cases for four countries. With this data, we project the future number
of cases, both reported and unreported, in each country. We assume a fraction f of total cases are
unreported. We simulate our model with f = 0.6 and f = 0.1 for each country. The fractions f = 0.6
and f = 0.1 correspond to lesser and greater final sizes, respectively. For South Korea, the epidemic has
subsided, because of the major measures that were implemented to restrict public distancing. For Italy,
France, and Germany, the epidemics are still rising, because these measures have been implemented only
recently.
Our model incorporates social distancing measures through the time dependent transmission rate τ (t)
in the third phase. This rate involves µ (the rate of exponential decay corresponding to these measures)
and N the day at which they become effective. It is evident that these measures should start as early
as possible, and should be as strong as possible. The consequences of late public interventions may have
severe consequences for the epidemic outcome (as illustrated in Figure 6 in [2]).
In the case of South Korea, the peak of the epidemic occurred approximately February 29. In Figures
5 and 6, we see that our model agrees very well the data for South Korea. Accordingly to our model, the
daily number of cases reaches a maximum of approximately 700 cases near the turning point February
29.
Compared to South Korea, the public interventions in Italy, France, and Germany were relatively
late. The peak of the epidemic occurs in Italy around April 9, in France around April 14, and in Germany
around May 1. The maximum daily number of cases is between 10 000 and 15 000 in Italy, between 12 000
and 20 000 in France, and between 200 000 and 500 000 in Germany. These numbers will likely remain
high for an extended period of several months for these three countries, without further major public
measures.
