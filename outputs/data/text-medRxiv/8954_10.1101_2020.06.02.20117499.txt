Research in context (word count: 263)
Evidence before the study: We searched PubMed and preprint archives for articles published
up to May 17, 2020, that contained information about the anticipation of intensive care unit
(ICU) bed requirement during the COVID-19 outbreak using the terms “coronavirus”, “2009nCOV”, “COVID-19”, SARS-CoV2”, “prediction” “resource” and ”intensive care”. We also
reviewed relevant references in retrieved articles and the publicly available publication list of
the COVID-19 living systematic review.22 This list contains studies on covid-19 published on
PubMed and Embase through Ovid, bioRxiv, and medRxiv, and is continuously updated.
Although many studies estimated the number of patients who would have severe COVID-19
requiring ICU, very few contained assessment for early signals (from internet or social
media), and we retrieved no study whose data came from suspected or infected patients.
Added values of this study: During the COVID-19 epidemic, emergency medical system
(EMS) calls, percentage of positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
tests, ambulance dispatch, emergency department (ED) and general practitioner (GP) visits of
COVID-19 patients were strongly associated with COVID-19 ICU patients with an
anticipation delay of 23, 15, 14, 13, and 12 days respectively. Hospitalization did not
anticipated COVID-19 ICU bed requirement.
Implication of all available evidence: EMS calls and ambulance dispatch, percent of
positive RT-PCR, and ED and GP visits could be valuable tools as daily alert signals to set up
plan to face the burden of ICU bed requirement during the initial wave of the COVID-19
epidemic, and may possibly also help anticipating a second wave. These results are important
since mortality has been reported being correlated to health care resources.

Abstract (word count 260)
Background: Although the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds is crucial during the
COVID-19 epidemic caring for the most critically ill infected patients, there is no recognized
early indicator to anticipate ICU bed requirements.
Methods: In the Ile-de-France region, from February 20 to May 5, 2020, emergency medical
service (EMS) calls and the response provided (ambulances) together the percentage of
positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, general practitioner
(GP) and emergency department (ED) visits, and hospital admissions of COVID-19 patients
were recorded daily and compared to the number of COVID-19 ICU patients. Correlation
curve analysis was performed to determine the best correlation coefficient (R), depending on
the number of days the indicator has been shifted. A delay ≥7 days was considered as an early
alert, and a delay ≥14 days a very early alert.
Findings: EMS calls, percentage of positive RT-PCR tests, ambulances used, ED and GP
visits of COVID-19 patients were strongly associated with COVID-19 ICU patients with an
anticipation delay of 23, 15, 14, 13, and 12 days respectively. Hospitalization did not
anticipate ICU bed requirement.
Interpretation: The daily number of COVID19-related telephone calls received by the EMS
and corresponding dispatch ambulances, and the proportion of positive RT-PCR tests were
the earliest indicators of the number of COVID19 patients requiring ICU care during the
epidemic crisis in the Ile-de-France region, rapidly followed by ED and GP visits. This
information may help health authorities to anticipate a future epidemic, including a second
wave of COVID19 or decide additional social measures.
Funding: Only institutional funding was provided.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has a high impact on public health in many countries.1 The
medical response has combined all hospital resources, including emergency departments
(ED), conventional hospitalization, and intensive care units (ICU). Despite the beginning of
the epidemic in China in early December,2 most Western countries were not sufficiently
prepared for its intensity and particularly the wave of critically ill patients requiring intensive
care. Except for some countries which succeeded in early control of epidemic transmission
chains (South Korea, Hong Kong),3,4 most countries (China, Italy, France, Spain, UK, USA
and Brazil) experienced a rapidly diffusing epidemic pattern. It strucked the health care
system with a rare violence and threatened possible ICU bed shortage which would have led
to additional mortality.5-7 Although epidemiological analyses provided accurate early
information concerning the progression of the epidemic,8 they were not able to predict its
evolution at the peak of the crisis (including the number of ICU beds required). The peak of
the crisis depends indeed on collective measures (testing, isolation of infected patients, social
distancing, wearing mask, hand washing, and lockdown), which are the only actions with
proven efficacy in the absence of proven specific treatment and/or vaccination to date.9 In
France, all patients requiring ICU were admitted in such units, but this result was only
obtained by a considerable increase in the number of ICU beds, and massive inter-regional
ICU patient transfers, to avoid overwhelming of local ICUs.10
The aim of our study was to evaluate what would have been the most reliable early
COVID19-related signals to anticipate ICU beds requirements. Because several days elapsed
between the onset of clinical symptoms and worsening in a small proportion of infected
patients requiring ICU (estimated around 5%),11 we hypothesized that such early signals
exists and may be helpful for both public health policy or decisions and hospital management.
Thus, we investigated the telephone calls received by the emergency medical services (EMS)

and the immediate response provided, visits to general practitioners (GP) and emergency
department (ED), hospital in-patient admissions, and positive reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. We think that this analysis could help health care
systems to more rapidly adapt to a future epidemic, including a possible second wave of
COVID-19.12 These indicators may help health authorities to decide additional measures such
as new lockdown or any other preventive measures at the population level.

Methods
The Ile de France Region (12·1 million inhabitants) comprises 8 administrative subentities, each of them served by a medicalized EMS known as SAMU (Service d’Aide
Médicale Urgente). The Paris city and its inner suburbs (6·71 million inhabitants) is covered
by 4 SAMUs belonging to the Greater Paris University hospital network APHP (Electronic
supplement Figure S1). The individual SAMUs operate identically, use the same health
information and management system (Centre d’Appel de Régulation MEdicale Nominal
(CARMEN) created in 2010) and provide an adapted answer to calls to “15”, the French tollfree number dedicated to medical emergencies. This service is based on a medical response to
emergency calls where an emergency physician decides the appropriate response for each
case. Depending on the evaluation of the severity of the case and the circumstances, the phone
response may be a medical advice, a home visit of a GP, the dispatch of an ambulance or
rescue workers, and, in the most serious cases, sending a mobile intensive care unit (MICU)
staffed by an emergency physician sent on scene as a second or a first tier.13 To cope with the
surge of calls during the COVID-19 crisis, the 4 SAMUs involved in the study have increased
their response capacity by creating specific procedures for COVID-19-related calls, such as
staff increase, dedicated computer stations, interactive voice server, video consultation,
sending instructions by SMS. Prehospital EMT and MICU teams were also significantly

reinforced. Since January 20, 2020 all calls and patient records related to COVID-19 were
identified in their information system and a daily automated activity report was produced.
The primary endpoint was the number of COVID19 patients who were present in ICU
in the Ile de France region during the study period (from February 20 to May 5, 2020). The
secondary endpoint was the daily number of new COVID19 patients admitted into ICU.
During the study period, APHP staffed a regionalized and dedicated team to ensure that
information concerning ICU bed availability was accurate and available in real time
(Répertoire Opérationnel des Ressources Ile-de-France; https://www.ror-if.fr/ror/) and could
help any physician to rapidly find an ICU bed for a given patient.10 We collected daily the
number of ICU patients from the Système d’Information pour le Suivi des Victimes (SI-VIC)
database which provides real time data on the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in French
public and private hospitals (https://www.data.gouv.fr) and was activated for COVID-19
epidemic on March 13, 2020. Before that date, the number of ICU patients was collected by a
direct centralized survey of the Regional Health Agency. All COVID-19 ICU cases were
confirmed by RT-PCR or computed tomographic scan suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We studied 6 indicators as they were reliable and accessible on a daily basis: 1)
number of emergency calls received by the 4 SAMUs of APHP and diagnosed as suspected
COVID19 patients, using the CARMEN database; 2) number of these patients requiring
dispatch of an ambulance (either ordinary or MICU) using the CARMEN database; 3) number
of ED visits for a clinically suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in the Ile-de-France
Region, using the French OSCOUR® health information system, created in 2004 and which
connects all French ED (https://www.data.gouv.fr). 4) the number of COVID-19 diagnoses
made by a private network of GPs who performed only emergency visits on a 24 hour and 7
day basis at home (SOS médecins), in the Ile-de-France region; 5) the number of hospital
admission of the COVID19 patients, in the Ile-de-France region; 6) percentage of positive

RT-PCR tests for COVID19 in the Ile-de-France region. Only the percentage of positive
results was considered because the availability of biological tests was markedly limited during
the early phase of the epidemic. Moreover, during this early phase, only the APHP could
perform RT-PCR. Publicly available sources and APHP data warehouse produced data with
de-identified information.
For each indicator, we determined the onset defined as the first day the indicator
became positive, 50% increase, and peak of the curve during the ascension phase. For these
three points, we calculated delays as compared to endpoints. We performed correlation curve
analysis during the whole study period by plotting (ICU patients at date T) vs (value of the
indicator at date T+t) and varying t, to determine the best correlation coefficient, depending
on the number of days the indicator had been shifted. The primary variable chosen to assess
time delay was the correlation curve, and a time lag value ≥ 7 days was considered as an early
alert indicator, and ≥ 14 days a very early one. For each indicator, we computed the timedependant reproduction ratio (R(t)) using a gamma-distributed generation interval distribution
with mean 6 days and standard deviation 4 days.14
We retrospectively investigated how these indicators could have been used as tools to
anticipate the burden of ICU COVID19 patients. Since the initial capacity of ICU beds was
40% of that reached at the peak of the crisis we decided to fix this 40% threshold as the upper
limit for each indicator, as previously reported,15 and half of this threshold (20%) was made
the lower acceptable limit, delimiting a red zone above 40%, a green zone below 20% and an
orange zone between these two limits. In addition, we also defined the slope for each
indicator that correspond to the 40 and 20% of the maximum slope reached during the initial
raise, using the same colour-coding.

Results
The median daily number of emergency calls received by the EMS was 1536 (IQR
494-3854), the number of emergency calls from suspected COVID19 patient ranged from 0 to
5872 (66%) The median daily number of ambulances sent was 48 (IQR 8·5-173) and the
number of COVID19 patients transported to the hospital ranged from 0 to 354 (47%). The
median daily number of GP visits was 91 (IQR 56-255) and the number of COVID-19
patients visited ranged from 0 to 518 (30%). The median daily number of ED visits was 519
(IQR 211-954) and the number of COVID19 ED visits ranged from 0 to 2054 (37%). The
median daily number of RT-PCR was 1301 (IQR 600-3724) and the percentage of positive
RT-PCR tests ranged from 0 to 54 %. The median daily number of COVID-19 hospital
admission was 5552 (IQR 1148-7533), reaching a maximum of 13450. The number of ICU
beds increased from 1189 to 2945 (248%) and the number of COVID ICU patients ranged
from 0 to 2677 (91%). There was a high correlation between the numbers of ICU patients and
new ICU COVID19 patients in the Ile-de-France region and in APHP hospitals (R2=0.99,
P<0.0001 and R2=0.96, P<0.0001, respectively).
Figure 1 shows the comparison of each indicator to the primary and secondary
endpoints. The number of EMS calls, number of ambulance dispatch, and percentage of
positive RT-PCR tests, were very early indicators, followed by diagnosis by GP and
admission to the ED. Table 1 summarizes the delay between these indicators and the primary
and secondary endpoints according to the main characteristics of the curves. Correlation curve
analysis is shown in Electronic supplements Figure S2 and S3.
Figure 2 shows what happened if a semi-quantitative analysis of these indicators and
their respective thresholds and slopes had been applied during the initial phase of the
epidemic.
The time-dependant reproduction ratio confirmed that the number of EMS calls
informed early on the epidemic course (Figure 3). The effect of the lockdown on transmission

was shown almost in real time, crossing the R=1 threshold 2 days after its adoption and

Discussion
The present study shows that five indicators (EMS calls, percentage of positive RTPCR tests, dispatch ambulances, ED and GP visits) anticipated the burden of ICU patients for
at least 7 days during the COVID19 epidemic, the first three by at least 14 days. This result
suggests that they could be valuable tools as daily alert signals to set up plan to face the
outbreak burden during the initial wave of the epidemic and may possibly also work during a
second wave. These results are important since mortality has been reported being correlated to
health care resources.16
Although many studies estimated the number of patients who would have severe
COVID-19,17,18 very few have assessed early signals associated with ICU requirements.
These studies investigated internet or social media data.19-21 To our knowledge, no study
analyzed data from COVID-19 suspected or infected patients.22 Since several days (estimation
7-12 days) elapse between the onset of clinical symptoms and worsening of clinical status
requiring either admission to the hospital or ICU, our hypothesis is that indicators exist that
could be easily available on a daily basis, enabling an accurate and anticipated survey of the
COVID-19 epidemic. The availability on a defined geographical region rather than a whole
country is important since a heterogeneous time and space spread of the SARS-CoV2 virus
has been observed in all severely impacted countries.
Among all tested indicators, EMS calls for COVID19 was a very early one. As many
countries have this type of health care organization for emergency calls, the use of this signal
is widely applicable although political incitation to use this canal for the population to signal
COVID19 infection may differ from one country to another. However, once appropriately
used this indicator is early and sensitive. The observed delay between EMS calls and
admission into ICU concords with those reported for worsening of the disease.23 Moreover,
the medical assessment of emergency calls may be improved by learning from the first wave.
The dispatch of ambulances by EMS was also a very early indicator. It should be pointed out

12
that health authorities initially recommended symptomatic patients not to come directly to ED
but rather to call the EMS which were instructed to only transport to hospitals patients
needing hospital care and to refer others to GP if ambulatory care was needed. The inclusion
of MICU ambulances may have also introduced a bias since some of these severe patients
were directly admitted into ICU. Consequently, in different EMS systems, we cannot exclude
that transport to the ED may behave differently.
The third very early indicator was the proportion of positive RT-PCR for COVID19.
Many countries as well as the WHO have emphasized the importance of an early detection of
the SARS-CoV2 virus by molecular diagnosis.24 South Korea and Germany in Europe have
widely used extensive testing to better control the epidemic.25,26 It is therefore not surprising
that this test appears as an early indicator for the COVID19 epidemic. Moreover, when testing
is performed on a large scale to detect not only infected patients but also contact individuals,
the signals provided by positive RT-PCR may occur earlier, which was not the case in France
at the time of the first wave. The population tested further evolved with the course of the
epidemic, particularly the proportion of positive patients admitted to the hospital. In France,
because of initial test shortage, RT-PCR was reserved for hospitalized patients, including ICU
patients, and health staff. As the epidemic diminished and RT-PCR availability increased,
more tests were performed for outpatients and their respective contacts to decrease epidemic
chain transmission in France. In this situation, the positive RT-PCR may become an earlier
test, since some additional time elapses (estimated 3-5 days) between contamination and onset
of symptoms. Further studies are required to investigate that point.
Other early indicators were the number of COVID19 diagnosis made by GP and ED.
As hospitals were seen by patients as potentially dangerous, many of them were not prompted
to attend the ED which led to a dramatic decrease in ED visits for any causes in France during
the COVID19 epidemic, as previously reported.28 The use of GP diagnosis is a valuable tool

if a national or regional system uploads valuable and structured information in real time.
France converted an existing system for an influenza epidemic, to COVID-19 survey,27 but
the number of involved GP remained relatively low and, as they are not available 24 hour a
day, they could only enrolled a limited number of patients. The French mobile GP network
SOS Médecins offers an alternative for our purpose since their members recorded appropriate
clinical information concerning COVID-19 patients during the study period. This network has
been included in a national process survey of epidemics since many years. Our results can be
applicable to other countries when such organization is at work or when alternative and
reliable GP based clinical data is collected. In addition, the French health care authorities have
now promoted all GPs as key actors in the detection of COVID clusters. Therefore, evaluation
and survey of GP visits should certainly become more sensitive.
Hospital admission ended up not being an early indicator of the number of ICU
patients. This result concords with previous studies reporting that the delay between hospital
admission to admission into ICU is closed to one day.29
Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, although the sample sizes were
large, our observation was limited to one region of France (with a very high population
density) and one event and thus extrapolation should be interpreted with caution. Second the
geographical repartition and population was not identical between some indicators and
endpoints (Electronic supplement Figure S1). However, there was a very high correlation
between ICU patients in the region and in APHP as the regulation of ICU bed availability was
regionalized during the epidemic and based at the APHP. The GP indicator only reflects a
particular activity (emergency visits at home) which is not distributed everywhere (less in
rural areas) but this was the only accessible GP indicator. Because of biological test shortage,
we only looked at the proportion of positive RT-PCR tests but the absolute number should
probably be preferred in countries without such limitation. The presence of physicians

(telemedicine) and not only emergency medical technicians (EMT) characterizes the French
EMS model. Nevertheless, there is no indication suggesting that an EMT-based system using
scripts may not lead to comparable results, particularly during an epidemic wave with a high
prevalence of the disease. Definition of COVID-19 suspected diagnosis may have slightly
varied during the study period in EMS, ED, and GP and between physicians. Admission into
ICU has been modified during the study period as intensivists better understood the
characteristics of the disease and modified their therapeutic approaches, particularly trying to
avoid tracheal intubation,30 and transfers of ICU patients outside the region was performed
just before the peak. Lastly, the raw signal of the indicators was sometimes noisy and a more
advanced mathematical analysis could improve their performance.* Despite these limitations,
we consider that our comparisons remain valid and could be adapted to most health systems
and potentially to other types of epidemic scheme.

Conclusion
The daily number of COVID19-related telephone calls received by the EMS and
corresponding ambulance dispatch, and the proportion of positive RT-PCR were the earliest
indicators of the number of COVID19 patients requiring ICU care during the epidemic crisis
in the Ile-de-France region, rapidly followed by ED and GP visits. This information may help
health authorities to anticipate a future epidemic, including a second wave of COVID19, to
monitor lockdown exit and decide additional social measures to better control COVID-19
outbreak.

Figure 2: Dashboard of the retained indicators (EMS calls, percentage of positive reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain (RT-PCR) tests, and general practitioners (GP) visits) and
their respective thresholds and slope had been applied during the initial phase of the epidemic.
Since initial capacity of ICU bed was 40% of the one reached at the peak of the crisis, a red
zone was defined above this threshold, a green zone below half of this threshold (i.e. 20 % of
ICU bed maximum capacity), and an orange zone between these two limits. We also defined
the slope for each indicator that correspond to the 40 and 20% of the maximum slope reached
during the initial raise, using the same colour coding. The first red flags would have occurred
on February 24 (slope) and March 4 (threshold) for COVID19 EMS calls, 22 and 13 days
before the date of the French lockdown (March 17, 2020).

information for COVID-19: EMS calls, general practitioner (GP) visits; emergency
department (ED) visits, ambulances, and compared to the number of new intensive care unit
(ICU) patients. The vertical bar is the date of the lockdown in France. Positive reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain test is not included in this figure because it was a percentage
and not an absolute number. Hospital admission was not included because it did not anticipate
number of ICU patients.

Electronic Supplement Figure S1

The Ile-de-France region (12·1 million inhabitants) comprises 8 administrative sub-identities,
indicated by their number on the map, the town of Paris being 75. In the present study, the
numbers of emergency departments (ED) visits, positive reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and
new ICU patients were obtained from the whole region. A regionalized organization was
installed enabling to rapidly find an ICU bed for a given patient wherever the patient was
initially admitted. Panel A: Data from emergency medical system (EMS), including
emergency calls and dispatch of ambulances were obtained from the Paris city (75) and its
inner suburbs which comprise 4 administrative sub-entities (75, 92, 93, 94) and their
respective EMS (6·71 million inhabitants). Panel B: Data from general practitioner (GP, SOS
Médecins network) were obtained from the Ile-de-France region but the density of activity of
this GP network (expressed as number of annual visits per million inhabitants).is
heterogeneous within the Ile-de-France region.
