ABSTRACT
Objectives: To estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission
in a U.S. jail beyond those offered in national guidelines.
Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large
urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four
intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of
people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate
the basic reproduction ratio, 𝑅0 , in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases,
hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of
sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions.
Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated 𝑅0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for
the subsequent phases, 𝑅0,𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), 𝑅0,𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.412.12), and 𝑅0,𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail’s interventions prevented
approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days.
Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be
effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health
measures.
Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single
celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19
within correctional settings.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has affected millions of people
worldwide, with disproportionate impact on some communities such as those inside correctional
facilities. In the United States (U.S.), approximately 2.2 million people are incarcerated in any
given day in over 5,000 facilities,1 where the built environment and activities of daily living
make physical distancing exceedingly difficult to implement.2,3 As of the third week of April
2020, 420 U.S. correctional facilities had at least one diagnosed case of COVID-19, accounting
for a total of 4,893 cases among incarcerated individuals and 2,778 cases among staff members.3
As of June, correctional facilities account for eight of out ten of the largest COVID-19 outbreaks
nationally, surpassing nursing homes and food processing plants, and 26 states now have a
higher rate of COVID-19 infection in their correctional population than in their general
population.4,5 Cook County Jail currently has one of the largest outbreak in the country, and the
infection rate at Rikers Island is nearly five times that of New York City.6,7
Despite the severity of outbreaks in correctional facilities, national guidance surrounding
the prevention and management of COVID-19 within such settings has been limited. In the
weeks after the first major outbreak in a U.S. jail, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) published policy guidelines for correctional facilities to help mitigate COVID-19
transmission, which included limiting transfer of incarcerated people between facilities,
restricting the number of visitors entering facilities, promoting personal hygiene and
environmental sanitization, maximizing the space between those incarcerated (i.e. arranging
bunks so individuals sleep head to toe), and screening staff for symptoms.8
However, CDC guidelines then and still now do not account for the difficulty that many
facilities face in managing COVID-19 and creating physical distance within jails. Even among

those jails which are not crowded, physical distancing is challenging given use of congregate
living arrangements, shared meals, and exercise and recreation programming. In the absence of
more targeted guidelines, there is wide variance in how correctional facilities are managing
COVID-19, especially regarding depopulation efforts that may mitigate COVID-19 and
approaches to testing (symptomatic only vs. asymptomatic, viral testing vs. antibody testing). As
an example, Attorney General Barr has ordered that medically frail individuals in federal prisons
be released to home quarantine, whereas many state prison systems have no stated policies for
larger scale release. Some correctional systems have implemented systemwide testing of all
incarcerated individuals, including those who are asymptomatic, while others are only testing
those who are symptomatic.
The effectiveness of such measures, which fall outside of CDC guidance, in reducing the
transmission of COVID-19 within correctional facilities has yet to be established. In this study,
we estimate the effectiveness of measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 beyond standard
CDC recommendations in a large urban jail. We focus on policies with large potential impact for
which there is variability in practice, namely depopulation (cessation of new detentions and
release of incarcerated individuals), single celling (percentage of the total incarcerated
population in a single cell), and testing asymptomatic individuals with the aim of providing
guidance to correctional policymakers and public health agencies.

METHODS
We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 which we
calibrated to the outbreak in the jail. We combined data on cases in incarcerated people and
correctional staff because they interact very closely and regularly as an ecosystem behind the

walls of the jail. We divided the outbreak timeline into four intervention phases marked by the
start of the outbreak, start of depopulation efforts, increased single celling, and large-scale
asymptomatic testing of incarcerated individuals. We estimated the initial basic reproduction
ratio, 𝑅0 , and the effective reproduction ratio, 𝑅𝑡 , in each phase, for the entire jail. We also
estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by the combined
interventions.

Model description
We modified a traditional SEIR model to represent the disease states of COVID-19.
These disease states included susceptible (𝑆), exposed (𝐸), infected symptomatic (𝐼𝑠𝑦𝑚 ), infected
asymptomatic (𝐼𝑎𝑠𝑦𝑚 ), quarantined (𝑄), hospitalized (𝐻), and recovered (𝑅𝑒𝑐) individuals
(Figure 1). To model these interacting populations, we developed a mass-action mixing model

The susceptible, exposed, and asymptomatic infected populations grew at rate 𝑏 which
represented the overall growth or reduction in jail population. We assume that symptomatic
infected individuals are not removed from the jail during depopulation and would be admitted
directly to quarantine. For the time horizon of the model, the population was generally shrinking.
Susceptible individuals were exposed to COVID-19 at transmission rate 𝛽. We re-calibrated this
transmission rate for each of the four outbreak phases. We assumed that asymptomatic and
symptomatic infected individuals could transmit the disease.9,10 Exposed individuals were
infected but not yet infectious and become asymptomatic or symptomatic infected at rate 𝜀,
which corresponded to the incubation period of COVID-19. A certain proportion, 𝛼, of these
individuals stayed asymptomatic, while remaining individuals became symptomatic. Based on
the jail’s report, we assumed that symptomatic infected individuals were placed in quarantine
after one day. We assumed that individuals once quarantined did not transmit COVID-19. A
fraction, 𝜂, of quarantined individuals were hospitalized and recovered from hospitalization at
rate 𝜇. All infected individuals recovered or died at rate 𝛾 regardless of symptomatic or
asymptomatic status. Symptomatic infected individuals died with probability 𝑑𝐼 .

Interventions
The jail implemented various measures over time in an attempt to mitigate the spread of
COVID-19. We divide the outbreak into four intervention phases, corresponding to the initiation
of key measures of interest which fell outside the guidance of the CDC. During Phase 1 (days 111), the jail implemented a broad array of strategies that were consistent with CDC guidance
including: basic screening for flu-like symptoms in incarcerated people; new detainees

quarantined for 14 days and basic screening for flu-like symptoms for visitors, vendors,
attorneys, and community members entering the facility; staff required to report symptoms as
well as contact with known COVID-19 positive cases and any travel outside of the United States;
suspension of all tours, large gatherings, in-person visitation. During phase 2 (days 12-17), the
jail population started to decrease by 1.41% each day through a combination of measures which
included a marked decrease in new detentions given changes in the court and judicial system
procedures and large community organized bail outs (Figure 2). The jail also began taking the
temperature of all employees each day. During phase 3 (days 18-36), the jail began increasing
the portion of the population in single-occupancy cells from 26% on day 18 to 54% on day 36.
During this period, they began requiring all staff to wear surgical masks and allotted new masks
to those incarcerated each day. They also continued to isolate confirmed and suspected COVID19 cases among incarcerated individuals but given the number of individuals, they identified a
different building for segregating patients which provided a larger space for the growing number
of confirmed cases. Lastly, they started on-site voluntary testing for employees and a two-week
COVID-19 paid leave policy for all employees. During phase 4 (days 37-83), the jail began
testing for asymptomatic cases in divisions with high numbers of cases identified during contact
tracing at a rate of approximately 50-75 people per day.

Model Instantiation and Calibration
We estimated some model parameter values from previous literature (Table 1). The rate
at which exposed individuals became asymptomatically or symptomatically infected, 𝜀, was the
inverse of the incubation period. The incubation period of COVID-19 was previously described
with a lognormal distribution with mean 5.1 days and standard deviation 0.89 days.11 We

assumed that the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic, 𝛼, was uniformly distributed
over the range 0.25 to 0.56.12,13 The average recovery rate was previously estimated to be 0.1, the
inverse of the 10-day mean infection period.14 We assumed that the infection period followed a
truncated normal distribution with mean 10 days, standard deviation 6.25 days, minimum 5 days,
and maximum 20 days. Additionally, the length of hospitalization from COVID-19 has been
estimated to be 5 days, making the daily recovery probability from the hospital 0.2.15 We
assumed that the length of hospitalization followed a lognormal distribution with a mean of 5
days and standard deviation of 1 day.
The jail provided demographic data about the size of the incarcerated population per day,
as well as epidemiological data about confirmed COVID-19 cases over the course of 83 days.
We assumed an average reporting delay of six days from first exposure to reported incidence.
This accounts for the mean incubation period and a minor delay between symptom onset and
COVID-19 test result and isolation. The jail provided data on the age of the infected person, date
of positive COVID-19 test, the work or incarceration location of the infected individual, and
whether the individual was hospitalized or died as a result of the COVID-19 infection. We used
these data to calculate the proportion of symptomatic infections that were hospitalized or died.
For each intervention phase, we used the epidemiological data to determine the growth rate, 𝑏, as
the average rate of growth for the entire facility.
We calibrated the transmission rate, 𝛽, for each intervention phase. We first pseudorandomly selected values for parameters 𝜀, 𝛼, 𝛾, and 𝜇 based on our assumed distributions
(Table 1). Then, we calculated 𝑏 for the intervention phase. To find the best-fitting value of 𝛽 for
the given parameter set, we implemented an exhaustive search over the range [0,4] in increments
of 0.01. We chose the value of 𝛽 which minimized the sum of mean squared error between the

reported daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases among incarcerated people and staff in
the jail to the daily incidence of symptomatic infected cases in the model for that phase. We
calculated the incidence of symptomatic cases using the raw reported incidence before
asymptomatic testing. Select asymptomatic testing for incarcerated people began on day 31 and
for staff began on day 21. After asymptomatic testing began, we took the minimum of the jailprovided data on the number of symptomatic tests multiplied by the average percentage of
positive results of symptomatic tests between days 16-30 (89%) and the raw reported incidence.
Based on this estimate, on average, 82% of the reported daily incidence among the incarcerated
population was symptomatic after asymptomatic testing began. Because we did not have testing
data available for staff, we assumed that 82% of reported new staff cases were symptomatic after
on-site testing became available for staff.
We used a simple moving average of the previous five days of incidence to smooth the
calibration targets. We assumed that the reported incidence corresponded to the number of
incarcerated individuals and staff members who showed symptoms of COVID-19. For each
intervention phase, we ran 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations and defined the 95% credible interval
of 𝛽 as the range into which 95% of calibrated values of 𝛽 fell.

Calculation of 𝑅0 and 𝑅𝑡
To calculate 𝑅0 and 𝑅𝑡 , we used the next generation method.16 This method utilizes two
matrices of partial derivatives of compartments with infected individuals.17 In our model, this
included exposed, asymptomatic infected, symptomatic infected, quarantined, and hospitalized
individuals. The first matrix, 𝐹, is the rate of appearance of new infections for each
compartment. Each element, 𝑓𝑖𝑗 , of 𝐹 is the partial derivative of any term in which new

The second matrix, 𝑉, is the rate of transfer of individuals out of a compartment minus the rate of
transfer of individuals into a compartment. Therefore, each element, 𝑣𝑖𝑗 , of 𝑉 is the partial

In our model, 𝐹𝑉 −1 has only one nonzero eigenvalue, 𝜆 =

−𝛽𝑆0 (𝑏−𝛾)(𝛼𝛾+𝛼+𝛾)
𝛾𝑁(𝛾−𝑏)

. Therefore, 𝑅0 =

max (0, 𝜆), and since 𝜆 ≥ 0, 𝑅0 = 𝜆. Since 𝑅0 is directly proportional to 𝛽, we can calculate the
values of 𝑅0 of other phases simply by using phase 1 starting conditions combined with the
reduced transmission rate.
To find the effective reproduction ratio, 𝑅𝑡 , at time 𝑡, we used the next generation method
with the same matrices but updated the values of 𝑆 and 𝛽 as appropriate. Because the number of
susceptible individuals, 𝑆, is a function of time, we recalculate 𝑅𝑡 each day. The functional form
of 𝑅𝑡 for our model is as follows:
𝑅𝑡 =

−𝛽𝑆𝑡 (𝑏−𝛾)(𝛼𝛾+𝛼+𝛾)

(14)

𝛾𝑁(𝛾−𝑏)

We computed the 95% credible interval of 𝑅𝑡 as the range into which 95% of calibrated values
of 𝑅𝑡 fell.
This study was deemed exempt from IRB review by the Yale Human Investigation
Committee as we received completely anonymized data from the jail.

RESULTS
Daily reported incidence of COVID-19 in the jail was highly variable, ranging from 0 to
67. The mean absolute error of the model compared to the simple moving average was 19%
(Figure 3).
Transmission Rates
In following the initial CDC recommendations for correctional facilities (phase 1), the
baseline transmission rate (𝛽) was 1.89 (95% Credible Interval (CrI): 1.44-2.44) (Figure 4).
After depopulation began (phase 2), the transmission rate was  = 0.83 (95% CrI: 0.66-1.06).
This represents a 56% decrease in the transmission rate from phase 1. After the increase in

single-occupancy cells (phase 3), the transmission rate was  = 0.41 (95% CrI: 0.30-0.56), a 51%
decrease from phase 2. Finally, the transmission rate after testing of asymptomatic individuals
began (phase 4) was  = 0.11 (95% CrI: 0.06-0.20), a 73% decrease from phase 3. All of these
reductions are statistically significant.

Reproduction Ratios
The estimated value of 𝑅0 was highest in phase 1, during the first 11 days of the outbreak
(Table 2). For this phase, we estimate 𝑅0 = 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90) (Table 2). We estimate
𝑅0 of each phase in a completely susceptible population as if the outbreak had begun with the
values for 𝛽 which correspond to each phase: 𝑅0,𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), 𝑅0,𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 3
= 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and 𝑅0,𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). The effective
reproduction ratio, 𝑅𝑡 , decreased over time as the susceptible population shrank, the transmission
rate changed, and different interventions were implemented (Figure 5). For the entire jail, we
estimate that the interventions may have reduced the effective reproduction ratio 𝑅𝑡 below 1
about five weeks after the outbreak began (on day 37).

Averted Infections, Hospitalizations, and Deaths
Table 2 shows the expected total symptomatic cases on day 83 and expected total cases
on day 200, assuming that the estimated transmission rate for a particular outbreak phase holds
over all subsequent days. Over the first 83 days of the outbreak, the jail reported 778
symptomatic cases among incarcerated individuals and staff. Our model predicts 642
symptomatic cases (95% CrI: 592-692), 90 hospitalizations (95% CrI: 83-97), and 4 deaths (95%
CrI: 3.6-4.1) over this same time period (Figure 6). Our estimate is 17% less than the number of

reported cases that were symptomatic. Compared to what could have happened with only CDC
recommended interventions, the model predicts a reduction of over 3,200 symptomatic cases,
450 hospitalizations, and 30 deaths over 83 days. This suggests that the combination of
interventions (depopulation, increased single celling, and large-scale asymptomatic testing of
incarcerated individuals) in addition to standard CDC COVID-19 mitigation strategies led to an
83% reduction in predicted symptomatic cases and hospitalizations and an 89% reduction in
predicted deaths.

DISCUSSION
Using a stochastic compartmental model, we estimate that depopulation efforts, single
celling and asymptomatic testing are important interventions, in addition to those recommended
by the CDC to reduce COVID-19 transmission in jails. We estimate that the actions taken by the
jail reduced potential new cases by approximately 83% over 83 days, and this may have averted
over 450 hospitalization and 30 deaths among those who work and live in jails.
Given these findings, depopulation efforts should be a primary strategy for COVID-19
mitigation in jails. Reductions in detained populations to prevent disease transmission is best
achieved by both decreasing the number of new intakes and increasing the number of releases.
This requires that authorities that control jail admissions (including police departments, judges,
and in some cases correctional departments) and jail releases (including judges, lawyers and
community bail funds) both focus on promoting depopulation efforts to mitigate COVID-19
transmission.
Our data also suggest that jails should focus on single celling to mitigate COVID-19. To
be clear, single celling does not imply solitary confinement but rather placing one person in a 6 x

9-foot cell to increase physical distancing in correctional facilities.18 Given physical crowding in
many facilities even when overall incarcerated populations are at record lows, increasing access
to single-occupancy cells will not be feasible without depopulation efforts, and as supported by
our model, will not lead to a contained transmission rate alone. Facilities unable to appropriately
place individuals in single cell without relying on solitary confinement should consider
depopulation as a preferred strategy. Implementing all of these measures will require interagency
coordination to achieve the full public health impact. Further, by enacting these measures,
correctional facilities may contribute to managing transmission in the surrounding community as
well, as several recent studies have documented jails as drivers of community spread of COVID19.19,20
Lastly, asymptomatic testing is an important component to COVID-19 mitigation
strategies. In this jail, they focused on asymptomatic testing through contact tracing of people
who tested positive, but much more research needs to be conducted on who should be tested and
under what circumstances, including whether mass testing is effective, when individuals should
be tested (upon entry, upon release, only for contact tracing, or in regular intervals), and whether
certain community rates should guide whether asymptomatic people warrant testing in
corrections. While widespread asymptomatic testing may not be indicated in a jail without
community cases, when community cases are present, asymptomatic testing should be
strongly recommended.
National and international health agencies, such as the CDC and the World Health
Organization, should address depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing in future
guidance for detention facilities and how best to implement these measures. Correctional facility
administrators will need to also consider how to best mitigate the challenges that come with any

of these strategies. For example, coordination of health care and social services organizations
prior to release should be prioritized and considerations of testing when releasing individuals as
part of depopulation efforts.
Our analysis has several limitations. We used a compartmental model which assumes
homogeneous mixing among the entire population. Correctional facilities in reality do not exhibit
homogeneous mixing, especially across divisions. Our model does not have the granularity to
capture the influence of individuals on transmission dynamics. Our model assumes a relatively
stationary population and only accounts for mixing within the jail. In reality, jail populations are
highly variable with frequent intakes and releases. Jailed individuals also have variable daily
routines, such as where they eat or exercise, which are not accounted for in our model. We did
not account for possible false positives, misdiagnosis, overreporting, or underreporting in the
dataset. Finally, the many interventions undertaken by the jail make it difficult to determine the
causal influence of any one particular intervention.
Importantly, these limitations influence our estimates of 𝛽 and 𝑅0 . We model the jail as a
closed system and thus neglect exogeneous infection (e.g., staff or new intake incarcerated
individuals who contracted the disease in the community) that likely entered the jail before largescale testing efforts. Because our analysis assumed that all new infections arise from internal
transmission, we likely overestimate the true values of 𝛽 and 𝑅0 , particularly in the early phases
of the epidemic in the jail. Thus, conclusions resulting from our analysis should focus on the
relative reductions of 𝛽 and 𝑅0 rather than the precise estimates of these values.
Despite the limitations of our analysis, we conclude that it is possible to mitigate the
spread of COVID-19 even in correctional settings, where standard social distancing practices are
difficult to achieve, by implementing depopulation strategies, promoting increased single celling,

and asymptomatic testing with appropriate isolation. The large estimated reduction in the
transmission rate (≥ 50%) from these three intervention strategies is comparable to standard
social distancing measures in a community setting.21 As states and the federal government are
focused on re-opening economies, strategies should be devised to protect those who are
incarcerated and those who work in corrections by further limiting population increases so that
future outbreaks are averted.
