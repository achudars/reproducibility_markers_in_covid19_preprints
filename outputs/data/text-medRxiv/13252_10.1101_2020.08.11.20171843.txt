Summary:

25
26

The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently causing a global pandemic and cases

27

continue to rise. The majority of infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic

28

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it is unknown whether this can induce persistent

29

immune memory that might contribute to herd immunity. Thus, we performed a

30

longitudinal assessment of individuals recovered from mildly symptomatic COVID-19 to

31

determine if they develop and sustain immunological memory against the virus. We found

32

that recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody and neutralizing

33

plasma, as well as virus-specific memory B and T cells that not only persisted, but in some

34

cases increased numerically over three months following symptom onset. Furthermore, the

35

SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with potent

36

antiviral immunity: memory T cells secreted IFN-γ and expanded upon antigen re-

37

encounter, while memory B cells expressed receptors capable of neutralizing virus when

38

expressed as antibodies. These findings demonstrate that mild COVID-19 elicits memory

39

lymphocytes that persist and display functional hallmarks associated with antiviral

40

protective immunity.

Main Text:

43
44

The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 beta coronavirus has infected 19 million and killed over

45

700,000 people worldwide as of early August 2020. Infection causes the disease COVID-19, which

46

ranges in presentation from asymptomatic to fatal. However, the vast majority of infected

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.20171843; this version posted August 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

47

individuals experience mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization1. It is critically important

48

to understand if SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals who recover from mild disease develop

49

immune memory that protects them from subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infections, thereby reducing

50

transmission and promoting herd immunity.

51
52

Immunological memory is predominantly mediated by cells of the adaptive immune system. In

53

response to most acute viral infections, B and T cells that can bind viral antigens through their

54

antigen receptors become activated, expand, differentiate and begin secreting effector molecules

55

to help control the infection. Upon resolution of infection, approximately 90% of these virus-

56

specific “effector cells” die, while 10% persist as long-lived “memory” cells2. Immune memory

57

cells can produce a continuous supply of effector molecules, as seen with long-lived antibody-

58

secreting plasma cells (LLPCs). In most cases, however, quiescent memory lymphocytes are

59

strategically positioned to rapidly reactivate in response to re-infection and execute effector

60

programs imprinted upon them during the primary response. Upon re-infection, pathogen-specific

61

memory B cells (MBCs) that express receptors associated with antigen experience and the

62

transcription factor T-bet rapidly proliferate and differentiate into IgG+ antibody-secreting

63

plasmablasts (PBs)3-5. Reactivated T-bet–expressing memory CD4+ T cells proliferate, “help”

64

activate MBCs and secrete cytokines (including IFNγ) to activate innate cells2. Meanwhile,

65

memory CD8+ T cells can kill virus-infected cells directly through the delivery of cytolytic

66

molecules6. These quantitatively and qualitatively enhanced virus-specific memory populations

67

coordinate to quickly clear the virus, thereby preventing disease and reducing the chance of

68

transmission.

70

To infect cells and propagate, SARS-CoV-2 relies on the interaction between the receptor binding

71

domain (RBD) of its spike protein (S) and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells7.

72

Multiple studies have shown that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals produce S-

73

and RBD-specific antibodies during the primary response, and RBD-specific monoclonal

74

antibodies can neutralize the virus in vitro and in vivo8-10. Therefore, RBD-specific antibodies

75

would likely contribute to protection against re-infection if expressed by LLPCs or MBCs.

76
77

To determine if the above hallmarks of immune protection from viral infection both form and

78

persist in individuals that have experienced mild COVID-19, we assessed their SARS-CoV-2-

79

specific immune responses at one and three months post-symptom onset. Herein we demonstrate

80

that a multipotent SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory response forms and is maintained in

81

recovered individuals at least for the duration of our study. Furthermore, memory lymphocytes

82

display hallmarks of protective antiviral immunity.

83
84

Return to immune homeostasis after mildly symptomatic COVID-19

85
86

To determine if immune memory cells form after mildly symptomatic COVID-19, we collected

87

plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 15 individuals recovered from

88

COVID-19 (CoV2+) (UW IRB 00009810). The CoV2+ group had a median age of 47 and reported

89

mild symptoms lasting a median of 13 days (E.D. Table 1). The first blood sample (Visit 1) was

90

drawn at least 20 days after a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and a median of 35.5 days post-

91

symptom onset. We expect the primary response to be contracting and early memory populations

92

to be generated at this time point, as viral load is cleared approximately 8 days post symptom onset

94

so we could assess the quantity and quality of the long-lived memory populations (Fig. 1a). We

95

compared these samples to samples collected at two time points representing a similar sampling

96

interval in a group of 17 healthy controls (HCs). All HCs were considered to have no prior SARS-

97

CoV-2 infection based on having no detectable plasma SARS-CoV-2 RBD- or S-specific

98

antibodies above three standard deviations (SDs) of the mean of historical negative (HN) plasma

99

samples (E.D. Fig. 1). We also included HN PBMC samples that were collected prior to the first

100

human SARS-CoV-2 infection (2016-2019). We included these to control for the possibility that

101

individuals in the HC group had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (9/17 described having some

102

symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection) despite their lack of detectable RBD-specific

103

antibodies.

. Participants returned for a second blood draw (Visit 2) a median of 86 days post-symptom onset

104
105

Populations of activated innate and adaptive immune cells expand in the blood during the primary

106

response to SARS-CoV-2 infection12. When an acute viral infection is cleared, the majority of

107

these highly inflammatory cells either die or become quiescent memory cells such that the

108

proportions and phenotypes of total immune cells are indistinguishable from those seen in pre-

109

infection blood samples. Consistent with resolution of the primary response, we found no

110

differences in frequency of total monocytes, monocyte subsets or plasmacytoid dendritic cells

111

among PBMCs between CoV2+ and HC individuals (E.D. Fig. 2). We also found no differences

112

in γδ or αβ CD3+ T cell frequencies (CD4+ or CD8+), nor in the cell cycle status, expression of

113

molecules associated with activation, migration, function or proportions of various CD45RA–

114

memory T cell subsets (E.D. Fig. 3). Together, these data demonstrate that the inflammatory

115

response associated with acute infection had resolved by the Visit 1 time point and the early

116

immune memory phase had commenced.

117
118

Mild COVID-19 induces persistent, neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody

119
120

Humoral immune responses are characterized by a first wave of short-lived, low-affinity antibody-

121

secreting PBs followed by a subsequent germinal center (GC) response that generates high-affinity

122

MBCs and antibody-secreting LLPCs. LLPCs can maintain detectable serum antibody titers for

123

months to many years, depending upon the specific viral infection13. Thus, it is critical to

124

distinguish the first wave of waning PB-derived antibodies from the later wave of persistent LLPC-

125

derived antibodies that can neutralize subsequent infections, potentially for life. We therefore first

126

determined that CD19+CD20loCD38hi PBs were no longer present at elevated frequencies in

127

CoV2+ individuals relative to HCs at Visit 1 (E.D. Fig. 4a). Other measures of recent B cell

128

activation in non-PB B cells include increased Ki67 expression (indicating cells have entered the

129

cell cycle) and expression of T-bet14. There are small increases in both the frequencies of Ki67+

130

and T-bet+ B cells at the Visit 1 time point compared to HC, but not at the Visit 2 time point (E.D.

131

Fig. 4b,c). These data suggest that while PBs associated with controlling acute infection are no

132

longer detectable in CoV2+ individuals at Visit 1, other B cell fates are still contracting. However,

133

by Visit 2, these B cell phenotypes have returned to homeostasis (E.D. Fig. 4a-c).

134
135

Antibodies measured at Visit 1 might include contributions from short-lived plasmablasts, while

136

those measured at Visit 2, long after PBs have contracted, represent contributions from LLPCs in

137

the bone marrow. We therefore examined the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.20171843; this version posted August 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

138

at Visit 1 and Visit 215. At Visit 1, 100% of CoV2+ individuals had plasma anti-RBD IgG levels 3

139

SDs above the mean of HCs, as measured by ELISA area under the curve (AUC), in accordance

140

with studies showing 100% seroprevalence by day 1410 (Fig. 1b). Additionally, 93% of CoV2+

141

individuals had anti-RBD IgM and 73% had anti-RBD IgA above this negative threshold. Almost

142

all CoV2+ individuals possessed IgG (100%), IgM (100%), and IgA (93%) anti-spike antibodies

143

above the threshold at Visit 1 as well (E.D. Fig. 4d). Levels of anti-RBD and anti-spike binding

144

were highly correlated for all isotypes (E.D. Fig. 4e). At Visit 2, all CoV2+ individuals maintained

145

anti-RBD IgG levels above the negative threshold and 71% and 36% had maintained anti-RBD

146

IgM and IgA, respectively (Fig. 1b). Anti-RBD IgG levels decreased only slightly among CoV2+

147

individuals between time points and 36% of CoV2+ individuals had the same or increased levels

148

at Visit 2. Anti-RBD IgM and IgA, however, decreased substantially from Visit 1 to Visit 2 (Fig.

149

1c, E.D. Fig. 4f).

150
151

As spike protein, and specifically the RBD, is key for viral entry into the cell, antibodies that target

152

the RBD can be potent inhibitors of infection8,9. To determine whether CoV2+ individuals form

153

and maintain neutralizing antibodies, we tested for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization indirectly using a

154

cell-free competition assay (surrogate virus neutralization test, sVNT) and directly in a plaque

155

reduction neutralization test (PRNT)16. CoV2+ plasma inhibited RBD binding to ACE2

156

significantly more than HC plasma by sVNT and RBD inhibition correlated strongly with anti-

157

RBD IgG levels at both time points (Fig. 1d,e). Further, RBD inhibition capacity was maintained

158

or increased in the majority of CoV2+ individuals from Visit 1 to Visit 2 (Fig. 1f, E.D. Fig. 4g).

159

Neutralization by PRNT correlated strongly with RBD inhibition at both time points (Fig. 1g, E.D.

160

4h) and was similarly maintained between visits (Fig. 1h). By the latest time point in our study,

161

86% of CoV2+ individuals still had better RBD-inhibiting plasma than HCs and 71% had better

162

neutralizing plasma (measured as above HC mean + 3 SDs). These data are consistent with the

163

emergence of predominantly IgG+ RBD and spike-specific LLPCs that maintain detectable

164

neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody to at least 3 months post-symptom onset.

165
166

Mild COVID-19 induces a sustained enrichment of RBD-specific memory B cells.

167
168

The presence of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies three months post-symptom onset in CoV2+

169

individuals suggests GC-derived memory LLPCs have formed. GC-derived MBCs also play a

170

critical role in the formation of antibody secreting cells upon antigen re-exposure. Therefore, we

171

tested whether SARS-CoV-2-specific MBCs were also formed and maintained in CoV2+

172

individuals throughout the study time course. We generated RBD tetramer reagents and used

173

enrichment strategies to identify rare RBD-specific cells that are otherwise undetectable in bulk

174

assessments17. We confirmed specificity in RBD immunized mice and then used the RBD-tetramer

175

to identify, enumerate and phenotype rare, RBD-specific B cells in our HN, HC and CoV2+

176

individuals (E.D. Fig. 5a,b; Fig. 2a). Gates used to phenotype RBD-specific B cells were defined

177

on total B cell populations (E.D. Fig. 5c). At Visit 1, RBD-specific B cells were significantly

178

expanded in CoV2+ individuals compared to HCs and their numbers were increased further at Visit

179

2 (Fig. 2a, b). The proportion and number of RBD-specific MBCs (defined by CD21 and CD27

180

expression) in CoV2+ samples was significantly greater than in HCs and increased from Visit 1 to

181

Visit 2 (Fig. 2c,d, E.D. Fig. 5d). While RBD-specific B cells in HN samples had a similar

182

proportion of MBCs as in CoV2+ samples, they contained substantially fewer cells. In addition,

183

RBD-specific MBCs were largely quiescent with very few expressing Ki67 (Fig. 2e, E.D. Fig.

184

switched B cell receptors (BCRs) is another marker of GC-derivation. We therefore assayed BCR

185

isotype expression on RBD-specific MBCs and found enriched populations of IgA- and IgG-

186

expressing MBCs in CoV2+ individuals at both time points (Fig. 2f-h, E.D. Fig. 5f). Of note, while

187

small numbers of RBD-specific MBCs were detected in controls, these cells were predominantly

188

unswitched (IgM+ and IgD+), suggesting they may represent cross-reactive MBCs possibly

189

generated in response to one of the human coronaviruses that cause 15% of common colds18-20.

190
191

An additional measure of antiviral MBC function is the graded expression of T-bet14. MBCs that

192

express low-levels of T-bet are associated with rapid differentiation into secondary PBs that

193

produce high affinity, viral-specific antibodies during a secondary infection21. We found a higher

194

proportion and number of T-bet+, and specifically T-betlo, RBD-specific MBCs in CoV2+

195

individuals compared with HCs at Visit 1 and the higher numbers were maintained at Visit 2 (Fig.

196

2i-k, E.D. Fig. 5g,h). T-bethi MBCs are considered to be recently activated and often found

197

enriched during chronic infection21. Consistent with SARS-CoV-2 being an acute infection11, we

198

found very few RBD-specific T-bethi MBCs in CoV2+ individuals at either memory time point

199

(E.D. Fig. 5i). Our data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the generation of RBD-

200

specific TbetloIgG+CD21+CD27+ “classical” MBCs likely derived from a GC22. Furthermore,

201

numbers of these MBCs were not only maintained, but increased from one to three months post-

202

symptom onset.

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces durable, functional spike-reactive CD4+ T cells

206

The presence of T-bet+ RBD-specific MBCs suggested that antigen-specific memory T cell

207

responses were also likely to be elicited in CoV2+ individuals. To enumerate SARS-CoV-2-

208

specific memory T cells, total PBMCs from control or CoV2+ individuals were incubated with

209

spike protein and expression of activation markers was assessed (Fig. 3a)23,24. PBMCs from CoV2+

210

individuals at Visit 1 and 2 displayed robust re-activation of spike-specific CD4+ memory T

211

responses, as measured by increased expression of ICOS and CD40L (two molecules associated

212

with B cell help upon re-activation), while PBMCs from HC and HN individuals did not (Fig.

213

3a,b). There were no significant differences in the numbers of responding cells in CoV2+

214

individuals between the two visits, suggesting spike-specific memory CD4+ T cells were

215

maintained throughout the study (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, greater numbers of CXCR5-expressing

216

circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells25, which provide B cell help, were found within the

217

population of S-specific ICOS+CD40L+CD4+ cells in CoV2+ individuals than in healthy controls

218

at both visits (Fig. 3c). Together these data suggest that SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD4+ T

219

cells maintain the capacity to provide B cell help even at three months post-symptom onset.

220
221

Memory CD4+ T cells produce cytokines within hours of activation, whereas naive T cells take

222

days26. We first examined cytokine production from activated CD4+ memory CXCR5- non-Tfh

223

cells and CXCR5+ cTfh cells identified in the assay above (Fig. 3b). S-specific CCR6+CXCR5+

224

cTfh cells, associated with IL-17 production, and a smaller population of CXCR3+CXCR5+ cTfh

225

cells, associated with IFNγ production, were recently described in a predominantly mild to

226

moderate cohort 30 days post symptom onset 27. We therefore analyzed activated ICOS+CD69+ S-

227

specific cells for expression of CCR6 and CXCR5 and then cytokine expression was examined in

228

each population based on gating on a PMA positive control (Fig 3d, E.F. 6a). Although multiple

229

cytokines associated with Tfh function were assessed, only IFNγ, IL-17 and IL-2 cytokine

230

producing cells were significantly expressed in activated S-specific memory CD4+ cells in CoV2+

231

individuals compared to HCs (Fig. 3d-f). Small numbers of S-specific cells were measured in HCs

232

after stimulation compared to vehicle alone that reflect previously described S-specific cross-

233

reactivity20,28, but far greater responses were seen in the CoV2+ individuals (Fig. 3e). Three months

234

post symptom onset we found a higher frequency of CCR6- cTfh cells that produced Th1 cytokines,

235

IFNγ and IL-2, suggesting a dominant Th1 response in CoV2+ individuals (Fig. 3f).

236
237

To further define the types of antigen-specific CD4+ memory T cells in CoV2+ individuals without

238

relying on secretion of specific cytokines, we assessed memory CD4+ T cell proliferation in

239

response to spike restimulation. For this, we sorted CD45RA+ naive, CD45RA–CCR7+ central

240

memory (Tcm) and CD45RA–CCR7– effector memory (Tem) T cells from HC or CoV2+

241

individuals (E.D. Fig. 6b), then measured the proliferative capacity of each sorted population

242

following culture with autologous CD14+ monocytes and recombinant spike protein (Fig. 3g, h;

243

E.D. Fig 6c). Only Tcm cells from CoV2+ individuals taken at both Visit 1 and Visit 2 displayed

244

significant proliferation frequencies compared to HC samples, although substantial proliferative

245

responses by Tem cells were observed in some CoV2+ individuals (Fig. 3h). We also examined

246

the expression of CXCR3 and CCR6 on S-specific, proliferated memory cells and found that the

247

majority of cells that had proliferated, as measured by the dilution of cell proliferation dye (CPDlo)

248

expressed CXCR3, in keeping with Type 1 cytokine production in the previous assay. Spike-

249

specific Tcm, and potentially Tem, are therefore maintained throughout our study and have the

250

ability to proliferate and re-populate the memory pool upon antigen re-encounter.

252

While much recent work has focused on antibodies and B cells, memory CD8+ T cells are uniquely

253

positioned to kill virus infected cells through their directed expression of cytokines and cytolytic

254

molecules. S-specific memory CD8+ T cells that persisted for three months after mild COVID-19

255

disease could be identified by expression of the activation marker CD69 and the cytokine IFNγ

256

after overnight stimulation with spike (Fig 3i). Unlike CD4+ memory T cells, activated cytokine-

257

expressing CD8+ T cells were significantly increased over vehicle controls in both control and

258

CoV2+ groups (Fig. 3j). Together, these data demonstrate that both CD4+ and CD8+ SARS-CoV-

259

2-specific memory T cells are maintained and are able to produce effector cytokines after

260

restimulation three months post-symptom onset in mildly symptomatic COVID-19 individuals.

261
262

Mild COVID-19-induced SARS-CoV-2-specific MBCs can express neutralizing antibodies

263
264

Since SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific MBC and S-specific CD4+ cTfh were enriched in CoV2+

265

individuals after 3 months, we assessed whether these MBCs could produce neutralizing antibodies

266

if they were reactivated by a secondary infection. To this end, we index sorted single RBD-specific

267

B cells and sequenced the BCRs from 3 CoV2+ individuals at Visit 1 (E.D. Fig. 7a). Of the class-

268

switched (IgG+) RBD-specific classical MBCs (CD21+CD27+) we sorted, we randomly selected 7

269

to be cloned and expressed as IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (Fig 4a). This set of antibodies utilized

270

a wide variety of heavy and light chains, had all undergone somatic hypermutation and were all

271

unique clones (Fig. 4b, E.D. Table 2). These antibodies were first expressed in small scale

272

cultures. Transfection supernatants were assessed for antibody expression by IgG ELISA (E.D.

273

Fig 7b) and specificity by RBD ELISA where all 7 showed strong binding to RBD (Fig. 4c). The

274

first 4 antibodies cloned were expressed on a larger scale and purified. The specificity of these

275

purified antibodies for RBD was again confirmed by ELISA (E.D. Fig. 7c) and their ability to

276

prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection was tested via PRNT assay. Two of the four tested (#202 and 203)

277

showed strong virus neutralization (Fig. 4d), with IC50 values of 15.6 and 15.4 ng/ml repectively

278

(Fig. 4e). This was comparable to a previously published strongly neutralizing mouse antibody

279

(B04) which was included as a positive control (IC50= 3.6 ng/ml)29. Two of the RBD-specific

280

antibodies were unable to inhibit virus infection, similar to a non-neutralizing mouse antibody

281

(C02) and an irrelevant Plasmodium-specific human antibody. Three more monoclonal antibodies

282

in addition to the 4 above were assessed for their capacity to inhibit RBD binding to the ACE2

283

receptor by sVNT assay (Fig. 4f). Three of the seven were able to inhibit RBD binding to ACE2,

284

similarly to a strongly neutralizing alpaca nanobody30. Interestingly, #203, which neutralized live

285

virus, did not inhibit binding in this assay, while #202 both inhibited binding and neutralized the

286

virus. Overall 50% of the antibodies tested showed inhibitory activity by one or both of these

287

methods. Thus, RBD-specific MBCs induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection are capable of producing

288

neutralizing antibodies against the virus and could thus contribute to protection from a second

289

exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

290
291

Discussion

292
293

In the absence of a vaccine, natural infection-induced herd immunity could play a key role in

294

reducing infections and deaths. For this to be possible, individuals that experience mild COVID-

295

19 would need to develop and sustain protective immune memory. Here, we found that individuals

296

that recovered from mildly symptomatic COVID-19 had an expanded arsenal of SARS-CoV-2-

297

specific immune mediators: neutralizing antibodies, IgG+T-betlo classical MBCs, circulating

298

cytokine-producing CXCR5+ Tfh1 cells, proliferating CXCR3+ CD4+ memory cells and IFNγ

299

producing CD8+ T cells that were maintained to at least three months post-symptom onset. This

300

study predicts that these recovered individuals will be protected from a second SARS-CoV-2

301

infection and, if so, suggests that Th1 memory should be the target of vaccine elicited memory.

302
303

Although long-lived immune memory can form to most viruses, some studies examining the

304

longevity of the response to coronaviruses have suggested that this is not the case31-33. However,

305

more recent studies, including our own, have examined memory time points when only LLPCs,

306

and not short-lived PBs, are producing circulating antibodies. Our study, along with three others

307

clearly demonstrates elevated IgG+ RBD-specific plasma antibodies and neutralizing plasma are

308

generated and maintained for at least 3 months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection34-36.

309
310

While antibodies reveal the contributions of LLPCs, functional virus-specific memory B and T

311

cells can also be key to protective immune memory37. Although previous studies have measured

312

the emergence of SARS-CoV-2-specific MBCs within a month of infection 27,38, we characterized

313

SARS-CoV-2-specific MBCs at one and three months from symptom onset. Our study revealed a

314

prominent population of RBD-specific IgG+CD27+CD21+T-betlo MBCs, which has been

315

associated in other infections with rapid differentiation into antibody-secreting PBs upon re-

316

exposure5, effective antiviral responses39and long-lived protection3. Furthermore, we found some

317

of the RBD-specific MBCs at Visit 1 expressed BCRs capable of neutralizing the virus when

318

expressed as antibodies. Since the numbers of these IgG+ RBD-specific MBCs were not only

319

sustained, but continued to increase between one and three months, we predict they are GC-

320

derived. Thus, MBCs at three months would have undergone increased affinity maturation and we

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.20171843; this version posted August 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

321

would expect an even higher percentage will be capable of producing neutralizing RBD-specific

322

antibodies upon re-infection.

323
324

MBC reactivation requires interactions with memory CD4+ T cells, which reactivate MBCs

325

through their expression of key molecules associated with T-B interactions including CXCR5,

326

ICOS, CD40 and a variety of cytokines. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ memory T cells in recovered

327

individuals exhibited the capacity to express all of these molecules and to undergo robust

328

proliferation upon re-exposure to spike protein. Notably, S-specific CD4+ memory T cells from

329

CoV2+ individuals rapidly displayed increased levels of ICOS and CD40L on CXCR5+ and

330

CXCR5– cells after stimulation as well as expression of Th1- and Th17- associated cytokines.

331

These results are consistent with another recent report of SARS-CoV-2- specific cTfh cells27,

332

although they detected a high frequency of Th17-like cTfh cells, which could be due to the earlier

333

time point they were examining as Th17 cells can develop into Th1 cells late in an immune

334

response40. The expression of IFNγ and IL-17 by these cells is notable as these cytokines are

335

associated with class-switching to IgG and IgA isotypes, respectively 41,42. We also found cross-

336

reactive memory B and T cells in healthy controls, as has been previously noted43. It is difficult to

337

measure their contribution to the expanded populations of SARS-CoV-2-specific cells we found

338

in our CoV2+ cohorts, and therefore impossible to evaluate their protective capacity. However, we

339

can conclude that mild COVID-19 induces an expanded population of functionally diverse

340

memory lymphocytes compared to the cross-reactive pool present in our controls.

341
342

Studies of reinfection have yet to be done in humans, but macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2

343

were protected from rechallenge44. This further suggests that the immune memory induced by mild

344

COVID-19 that we observed will be protective. While additional studies are needed to understand

345

variability of responses in a larger cohort and to determine how long memory to SARS-CoV-2

346

infection is truly maintained, our work suggests that mild COVID-19 induces persistent immune

347

memory poised for a coordinated, protective response to re-exposure that could contribute to herd

348

immunity and curtailing this pandemic.

Ethics Statement

529

This study was approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (Gale Lab,

530

IRB 00009810). Informed consent was obtained from all enrolled participants. Samples were de-

531

identified prior to transfer to the Pepper Lab.

532

Study Participants:

533

The study was conceptualized utilizing a prospective case-control design. Cases and controls were

534

identified from a cross-sectional cohort study that recruited via print and online advertising from

535

the Seattle metropolitan area (E.D. Table 1). Cases (n=15) were selected based on a reported

536

history of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasal swab. Controls (n=17) were selected based on having

537

no prior positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasal swab and having no detectable SARS-CoV-2 RBD- or

538

S-specific IgG or IgM plasma antibodies (within mean + 3 SD of 5 de-identified plasma samples

539

drawn prior to 2020 generously donated by Wesley C. Van Voorhis). At the time of enrollment,

540

information was collected from all participants regarding recent illness symptoms and severity.

541

All CoV2+ cases reported at least one symptom but all were classified as mild disease, as none

542

required hospitalization. Historical negative control PBMCs (n=14) were sourced from the BRI

543

PBMC repository. Samples were drawn prior to 2020 and age and sex matched to the CoV2+ cases.

544
545

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and plasma collection

546

6-10 milliliters of venous blood from study volunteers were collected in EDTA tubes and spun at

547

1500xg for 10 minutes. Plasma was collected, heat-inactivated at 56oC for 30 minutes, aliquoted

and stored at -80oC. The cellular fraction was resuspended in PBS and PBMC were separated from

549

RBC using Sepmate PBMC Isolation Tubes (STEMCELL Technologies) according to

550

manufacturer’s instruction and frozen at -80oC before being stored in liquid nitrogen. PBMCs were

551

thawed at 37C and washed twice before use.

SARS-CoV-2 Protein Production and Purification

554

Plasmid construction

555

The SARS-CoV-2 SB (BEI NR-52422) construct was synthesized by GenScript into pcDNA3.1-

556

with an N-terminal mu-phosphatase signal peptide and a C-terminal octa-histidine tag

557

(GHHHHHHHH). The boundaries of the construct are N-328RFPN331 and C-528KKST531. The

558

SARS-CoV-2 S-2P ectodomain trimer (GenBank: YP_009724390.1, BEI NR-52420; cite PMID

559

32155444) was synthesized by GenScript into pCMV with an N-terminal mu-phosphatase signal

560

peptide and a C-terminal TEV cleavage site (GSGRENLYPQG), T4 fibritin foldon

561

(GGGSGYIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTPL), and octa-histidine tag (GHHHHHHHH).

562

The construct contains the 2P mutations (proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987; PMID

563

28807998) and an 682SGAG685 substitution at the furin cleavage site. A pCAGGS vector containing

564

the spike protein RBD from SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate) was generously provided by

565

Florian Krammer.

567

Transient expression

568

Constructs were produced in Expi293F cells grown in suspension using Expi293F expression

569

medium (Life technologies) at 33°C, 70% humidity, and 8% CO2 rotating at 150 rpm. The cultures

570

were transfected using PEI-MAX (Polyscience) with cells grown to a density of 3.0 million cells

per mL and cultivated for 3 days. Supernatants was clarified by centrifugation (5 minutes at 4000

572

rcf), addition of PDADMAC solution to a final concentration of 0.0375% (Sigma Aldrich,

573

#409014), and a second spin (5 minutes at 4000 rcf).

574
575

Purification of His-tagged proteins

576

Proteins were purified from clarified supernatants via a batch bind method where each supernatant

577

was supplemented with 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 45 mM and 5 M NaCl to

578

a final concentration of ~310 mM). Talon cobalt affinity resin (Takara) was added to the treated

579

supernatants and allowed to incubate for 15 minutes with gentle shaking. Resin was collected using

580

vacuum filtration using a 0.2 μm filter and transferred to a gravity column. The resin was washed

581

with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and the protein was eluted with three column volumes of

582

20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl. The batch bind process was then repeated

583

and the first and second elutions combined. SDS-PAGE was used to assess purity. Purified S-2P

584

trimer was concentrated to ~1 mg/mL and dialyzed into 50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25%

585

L-Histidine, 5% glycerol in a hydrated 10k molecular weight cutoff dialysis cassette (Thermo

586

Scientific). The purified RBD protein was dialyzed into 50 mM Tris pH 7, 185 mM NaCl, 100

587

mM Arginine, 4.5% glycerol, 0.75% w/v CHAPS. Due to inherent instability, S-2P was

588

immediately flash frozen and stored at -80°C.

Recombinant trimeric spike and the RBD domain were both biotinylated using a EZ-Link Sulfo-

592

NHS-LC Biotinylation Kit (ThermoFisher), tetramerized with streptavidin-PE (Agilent) and stored

593

in 50% glycerol at -20oC as previously described17. Decoy reagent was generated by tetramerizing

624

96-well plates (Corning) were coated with 5 ug/mL of recombinant human ACE2-Fc diluted in

625

100mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and incubated at 4oC overnight. Plates were washed

626

with PBS-T and incubated with blocking buffer for 1 hour at RT. Plasma or monoclonal antibody

627

supernatants were serially diluted in triplicate in dilution buffer and incubated with 18ng of

628

recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD-HRP (conjugated using Abcam HRP conjugation kit) for 1 hour

629

at 37C. Blocked plates were washed and incubated with the pre-incubated serum and RBD-HRP

630

for 1 hour at RT, then detected with TMB and 1M HCl. OD was measured by a spectrophotometer

631

at 450nm and 570nm. RBD-HRP alone and serum with no RBD-HRP incubation were used as

632
