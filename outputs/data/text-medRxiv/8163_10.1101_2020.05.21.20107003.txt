Objective: The association between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
(RAAS) inhibitors and Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) mortality
is unclear. We aimed to explore the association of RAAS inhibitors,
including angiotensin-converting inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II
receptor blockers (ARBs) with COVID-19 mortality in patients with
hypertension.
Methods: MEDLINE, SCOPUS, OVID, and Cochrane Library were searched
for the period of January 1, 2020 to May 20, 2020. Studies reporting the
association of RAAS inhibitors (ACEi and ARBs) and mortality in patients
with hypertension, hospitalized for COVID-19 were extracted. Two
reviewers independently extracted appropriate data of interest and
assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using randomAbstract:
effects models on log-transformed risk ratio estimates, and
heterogeneity was quantified.
Results: Data were collected on 2,065,805 individuals (mean age, 58.73
years; 53.4% male). Patients with hypertension taking RAAS inhibitors
were 35% less likely to die from COVID-19 compared to patients with
hypertension not taking RAAS inhibitors (pooled RR= 0.65, 95%
Confidence Intervals (CI): 0.45-0.94). To explore the association of
COVID-19 and specific classes of RAAS inhibitors, we conducted a
subgroup analysis of ARBs and ACEi separately from studies that
provided them. Pooled risk ratio estimates from ARBs and ACEi showed a
lower but not significant risk of death from COVID-19 (RR=0.93, 95%
CI: 0.70-1.22) and ACEi (RR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.32-1.30).

Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, it was discovered that taking RAAS
inhibitors, significantly decreased the risk of COVID-19 mortality in
patients with hypertension. This indicates a potential protective role that
RAAS-inhibitors may have in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.

Key Questions:
What is already known about this subject?
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the recent
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, interfaces with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system (RAAS) through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Recent studies have questioned

whether RAAS inhibitors are safe in patients with COVID-19. However, observational studies involving

nf

patients hospitalized with COVID-19 that report the association of RAAS-inhibitors and COVID-19

severity or death have yielded conflicting findings.
What does this study add?

nt

This systematic review and meta-analysis discovered that RAAS inhibitors reduced the risk of

ial

mortality by 35% in patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 (RR= 0.65, 95% CI 0.450.94).

How might this impact clinical practice?

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the recent
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, interfaces with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system (RAAS) through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).1 The current hypotheses related to the
influence ACE2 may have in facilitating virus severity and mortality have been inconclusive. The

Co

increased expression of ACE2 is thought to potentially catalyze infection with COVID-19, and therefore

nf

increase the severity and risk of death.2 On the contrary, it has been found that ACE2 may be protective

ide

against acute lung injury.3

ACE2 is an 805-amino-acid, homologous to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE),

nt

with 40% identity and 61% similarity.4 The SARS-Cov2 virus binds to the ACE2 receptor for cell entry.1

ial

Prior research has suggested that ACE- inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin-II blockers (ARBs), which are

:F

commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes, may raise ACE2 levels and thus could increase
the risk of severe COVID-19 infection.5 Although ACE and ACE2 are two different enzymes with two

or

different active sites, there are reports that ACE inhibitors affect the expression of ACE2 in the heart and

Re

kidneys.6 ARBs alter ACE2 expression, both at the mRNA and protein level.6 7 ACE2 is upregulated in
both the renal vasculature tissue and cardiac tissue as a result of RAAS inhibitor exposure. 8

vie

Individuals with cardiovascular disease including hypertension are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2

w

infection,9 and majority depend on RAAS inhibitors for hypertension control, the potential influence of
ACEi and ARB during SARS-CoV-2 infection requires urgent exploration for a clarification. Despite

On

these theoretical uncertainties regarding whether pharmacologic regulation of ACE2 may influence the

harmful association.11 12 Many individuals with hypertension take ACE inhibitors and ARBs, but the
association of RAAS-inhibitors and mortality in COVID-19 patients has not been systematically
reviewed using a large number of studies. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to
delineate the association between use of RAAS-inhibitors and mortality in patients with COVID-19.

(Figure 2). No studies reported a significantly higher risk of mortality. The overall pooled estimates
showed a 35% reduction in the risk of mortality (RR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.45-0.94). The inverse association

for RAAS inhibitors among COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Between-study heterogeneity was
high (I2= 80, p<0.01).

Subgroup analysis of the association of ARBs and ACEi with mortality from COVID-19
To explore the association of COVID-19 and specific classes of RAAS inhibitors, we conducted a
subgroup analysis of ARBs and ACEi separately from studies that provided them. Three studies provided

Pooled risk ratio estimates from ARBs and ACEi showed a low risk of death from COVID-19 (RR=0.93,
95% CI: 0.70-1.22) and ACEi (RR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.32-1.30). However, the association was not

Sensitivity Analyses, Publication Bias Publication and Study Quality

nf

We conducted two types of sensitivity analyses. First, limiting our analysis to the 7 RAAS inhibitor

ide

studies whose sample size consisted of only individuals with hypertension, we excluded and replaced

nt

one study at a time from the meta-analysis and calculating the pooled RR for the remaining studies. No
substantial changes from pooled RR were observed when other studies were removed in turn. The

ial

pooled RR ranged from 0.57 to 0.72 (p<0.0001 for all) (Supplementary Figure 1). Second, by

:F

including all studies (main analysis plus 3 studies with sample size not limited to population with

or

hypertension, see table 1), pooled RR from sensitivity analysis ranged from 0.68 to 0.82 (p<0.0001 for
all) (Supplementary Figure 2). We did not find significant funnel plot asymmetry for the Egger test for

Re

RAAS inhibitor, ACEi and ARBs (p > .05). Upon visual inspection, the funnel plots appeared

vie

symmetrical for RAAS inhibitors, ACEi and ARBs (Supplemental Figures 3-6). The median study
quality score was 8 out of 9 (range=7-9).

Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies consisting of 2,065,805 patients with
a global representation suggests that the treatment of hypertension with RAAS-inhibitors is associated
with a lower risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. This finding is important, for the association
between RAAS-inhibitor exposure and mortality in COVID-19 patients has been inconclusive thus far.

Co

This topic has been heavily debated, and some studies even have interpolated a risk of taking RAAS-

nf

inhibitors using data from previous coronavirus outbreaks and preclinical studies. [6]

ide

RAAS-inhibitors have been found to mitigate the risk of severe lung injury by reducing the

nt

activation of the RAAS through the inactivation of angiotensin II3 and the generation of angiotensin-(19) 4 and angiotensin-(1-7) 28. Angiotensin- (1-7) binds to the G protein-coupled receptors Mas to mediate

ial

various physiological effects including vasorelaxation, cardio protection, anti-oxidation and inhibition of

:F

angiotensin II -induced signaling. This is one hypothesized mechanism illustrating how the treatment of

or

chronic conditions with RAAS-inhibitors may be beneficial in COVID-19 patients.

Re

Alternatively, it is hypothesized that the biological mechanisms of RAAS inhibitors may
predispose COVID-19 patients to severe disease and mortality. This was explained by the observation that

vie

SARS-CoV-2 enters a cell by binding to the membrane-bound ACE2 receptors. Animal models suggest

w

that ACEis and ARBs increase membrane-bound ACE2 receptors, to which then increases the availability
of cells for SARS-CoV-2 to bind and cellular entry.6 This hypothesis has sparked a debate in populations,

On

for many individuals taking RAAS inhibitors have grown concerned that their medications may be

predisposing them to developing COVID-19, and later dying from it.29 Our meta-analysis and systematic
review support the notion that RAAS inhibitor exposure does not increase COVID-19-related mortality
but rather shows beneficial effect.

Limitations of our study include possible selection bias in the published literature as a result of the strict
COVID-19 testing algorithm employed in the early stages of the pandemic. This may have resulted in
missed COVID-19 cases or deaths. Nevertheless, this is the largest quantitative synthesis of evidence on
the association between RAAS-inhibitor exposure and COVID-19 mortality. The regions with the
highest burden of COVID-19, including Asia, Europe, and North America, were represented thus

Co

increasing the external validity of our findings. The sample size included in this study was also quite

nf

large, allowing us to thoroughly cover a large population.
Conclusion

ide

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that COVID-19 patients with hypertension who take

nt

RAAS-inhibitors are protected from COVID-19 mortality compared to hypertensive patients not taking

ial

RAAS-inhibitors. Patients taking RAAS-inhibitors to manage their chronic diseases may continue to do

as per current treatment guidelines and based on the clinical judgment of their health care providers.
