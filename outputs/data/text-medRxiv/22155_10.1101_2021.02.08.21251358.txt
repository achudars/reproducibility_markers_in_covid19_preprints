Abstract
Background: Spain is one of the countries most heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As in other
countries such as UK and USA, nursing homes have been an important human reservoir for the virus and
the population with the highest mortality worldwide. The presence of asymptomatic carriers within nursing
homes is one of the factors that could provoke new outbreaks during the relaxing of lockdown measures.
Methods: We developed a high-throughput protocol for RNA extraction of patient samples based on
silane magnetic beads in multi-well plates. The sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility rates were
assessed using positive and negative clinical samples from the Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Spain.
We utilized the protocol to test a pilot cohort of 138 residents and 87 staff from a nursing home in
Northern Navarre, Spain.
Findings: Our protocol showed high sensitivity (100%), specificity (96·0%) and linear correlation with
2
PCR cycle threshold values obtained with a standard testing kit (R = 0·807, p=3E-05). Testing of 225

individuals from the nursing home revealed 63 residents (46%) and 14 staff (16%) positive for SARSCoV-2. Only 18 of the positive residents (28·6%) were symptomatic at time of testing. During follow-up, 6
PCR-negative symptomatic residents were retested and resulted positive. One-month mortality among
positive residents was higher than in negative residents (15·9% vs 1·3%), regardless of age or
comorbidities.
Interpretation: Rapid silane bead-based RNA extraction expanded the testing capabilities and COVID-19
patients were promptly identified. Personal and public health measures were enacted to avoid spreading
and tighten clinical surveillance. The ability to easily adapt the technical capabilities of academic research
centers to large-scale testing for SARS-CoV-2 could provide an invaluable tool for ensuring a safe lifting
of lockdown in countries with high numbers of cases.

Introduction
Spain has been one of the most severely affected countries by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the second
highest fatality rate worldwide.

1,2

Recent regional data estimates have shown that 17,585 residents of

nursing homes in Spain could have died from COVID-19. Since many of these people were not tested,
the mortality rate above global COVID-19 figures is unknown.3 Although physical distancing and lockdown
of the entire population have decreased the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and daily mortality, nursing homes
have been an important focus of contagion during the pandemic period, probably due to difficulties in
4
providing reliable individual isolation, and presymptomatic or asymptomatic transmission rates. While

there is an urgent need to lift lockdown measures, specific strategies have to be in place to avoid de novo
infections from viral carriers that could lead to new outbreaks in the next weeks or months due to the high
prevalence of non-protected subjects.

5,6

PCR testing is the only way to detect viral carriers among people

at risk.7,8 However, the development of rapid large-scale SARS-CoV-2 PCR strategies has been
hampered by the need for commercial RNA extraction kits and intensive manual labor,9,10 which increases
the time and costs of these analyses and limits their overall throughput. As reported by several media
outlets in UK and USA, research laboratories are a valuable untapped resource for providing PCR testing
capabilities.

8,11

Here we show a novel labor-, cost-, and time-saving protocol of RNA extraction, using

silane beads (SB) and magnetized pelleting followed by one-step RT-qPCR (Figure 1). With a case study
of a nursing home in Northern Navarre, Spain, we show that this method is suitable for sensitive and
timely detection of SARS-CoV-2 in vulnerable communities and health care workers. The entire protocol
from the receipt of patient samples to the analysis of data can be performed by a team of four workers
processing 1152 samples in a typical workday.

Results
We first compared two magnetic bead-based RNA extraction protocols (SB vs Oligo-dT Dynabeads)
using 16 patients’ deidentified nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative patients.
Swab samples were transferred to 96-well plates and extracted with either method utilizing magnetized
pelleting. Then, single-step reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for

SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed. SB extraction resulted in a more sensitive detection of both
SARS-CoV-2 (RdRp) and thus, was selected for further testing (Figure 2A).
Next, we validated the SB method with an additional cohort of 48 clinical samples including 13 positive
samples, 25 negative samples, and 10 mock controls. The new method showed 100% sensitivity (95%
CI: 75·3-100%) and 96·0% specificity (95% CI: 79·6-99·9%), with a positive likelihood ratio of 25·0 (3·662

170·6) and a highly linear correlation of cycle threshold (Ct) values (R =0·807 p=3E-05) when compared
with the standard column-based RNA extraction method (Figure 2B) despite detecting different sets of
viral genes (N/E or RdRp). One sample of 48 was identified as positive (Ct=32·2) that had not been
previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 with the standard method (Figure 2C). No false negatives were
produced. The test was replicated three times by three different operators, demonstrating very low inter2
2
operator variability (Figure 2D & E) (R =0·94 p=1·2E-06; R =0·96 p=4E-08).

In order to test the applicability of the method for comprehensive testing of vulnerable communities, 225
samples from a nursing home including 138 residents and 87 staff were obtained and processed (Figure
3A). Among residents, 63 samples produced a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 (45·7%), while 71 samples
were negative (50·4%), and 4 were uncertain (2·9%). Among staff, 14 of 87 were positive (16·1%), 71
were negative (81·6%), and 2 were uncertain (2·3%) (Figure 3B). When examining the medial records of
the residents, no statistical differences were found among SARS-CoV-2 negative and positive individuals,
having similar prevalence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and similar rates of chronic
neurological, cardiovascular, hepatic, or kidney diseases, and of cancer (Table 1). Only eighteen of the
residents and one staff member with positive tests were mildly symptomatic (28·6% and 7·1%,
respectively) at the time of sample collection.
The levels of viral detection varied among positive patients. Five samples (6·5%) had a high level of viral
RNA with a Ct less than 23, and 18 samples (23·4%) had Ct between 23 and 26 (Figure 3C).
Amplification of the internal control for the 225 samples was highly uniform (mean Ct = 21·21 ±2·1) in
clear contrast with viral RNA variability (mean Ct = 28·8 ±5·3) (Figure 3D, p<0·001).
The results were reported to the head of the facility, who established containment protocols and
established treatment decisions for each patient. SARS-CoV-2 positive staff members were put under

quarantine and contacted daily for clinical follow-up. SARS-CoV-2-positive residents were segregated
from SARS-CoV-2-negative residents by transfer to a different home (Figure 3E). From those negatives, 6
became symptomatic and were tested positive during follow-up. All SARS-CoV-2-negative residents were
surveilled for the potential onset of new symptoms, considering previous potential contact with positive
residents and staff. During one-month follow-up, 10 of the positive (15·9%) and one of the negative
patients (1·3%) died.

Discussion
All countries highly affected by COVID-19 pandemics are starting the relaxation of lockdowns of cities and
regions. Since a high percentage of the population is probably not protected,12 a new outbreak in the next
few week or months is still possible. To plan a safe transition from lockdown to regular social life, there is
thus the need to rapidly identify asymptomatic viral carriers, especially within at-risk environments such as
nursing homes, before the virus can be transmitted. Here we show a scalable method for large-scale
RNA extraction and PCR-mediated detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swabs. We have shown its
reliability, consistency, reproducibility, and high sensitivity. Using this methodology, we have tested all
residents and the entire staff of a nursing home revealing a high percentage of asymptomatic carriers.
The residents that tested positive for COVID-19 were at higher risk of short-term mortality than the
negative residents. Finally, appropriate planning for adequate isolation and clinical surveillance was
established for residents and health care staff.
The silane bead-based RNA extraction protocol was highly reproducible across different operators. Two
key concepts for effective scaleup are multiplexing, such as through the use of multi-well plates and
multichannel pipetting, and automation, such as through the use of liquid-handling robotic platforms. This
workflow can be easily carried out by research laboratories, with commonly high numbers of
thermocyclers and experienced personnel, in a way that does not oversaturate regular microbiology
laboratories. Rapid repeat testing could provide some insight into degree of viral shedding and duration of
contagion. This information could also benefit local policy makers for epidemiologic modeling of a specific
region.

In addition to nursing home residents, health care workers that could act as asymptomatic spreaders
were placed under quarantine. The relevance of adequately identifying these spreaders has been
recently highlighted as a major factor of viral spreading in several countries affected by the pandemics.13–
15

The protocol is cost-efficient and is not subject to the availability of commercial RNA extraction kits,
bypassing the major bottleneck to PCR testing worldwide. Besides saving lives in nursing homes, this
method could assist in facilitating the implementation of safe and rapid return to normal social and
economic activity.

Methods
Patients
The assay set-up cohort included 38 patients consecutively admitted to the Emergency Room of the
Clínica Universidad de Navarra (Pamplona, Spain) presenting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.
Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected and combined into 2 mL viral
transport medium. Fourteen patients (36·8%) had a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The
median Ct was 24·13 for the N gene (N) and 24·18 for the E gene (E). The median age was 61, and
57·1% were women. Fever (84·6%), cough (64·29%), asthenia (50%), and dyspnea (42·86%) were the
main symptoms. At baseline, 28·6% needed some degree of oxygen supplementation, and 50% had
radiologic pneumonia.
To evaluate the potential of large-scale testing in real-life scenarios, 225 individuals from a nursing home
were selected. Oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from all residents and staff and placed in
800 μl Buffer RLT Plus (Qiagen) and transferred to the academic research center for RNA extraction.
Magnetic bead-based large-scale RNA extraction and RT-qPCR
RNA was extracted from swab samples of 16 de-identified patients using two procedures: (i) silane
magnetic beads (SB) and (ii) oligo-dT magnetic beads (Thermofisher) following manufacturer’s
instructions. A schematic summary of the SB protocol is presented in Figure 1 and has been uploaded to
protocols.io (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bfmajk2e). Briefly, 150 μL of sample in RLT Plus buffer is
transferred to 96-well plates and then mixed with previously washed silane beads in RLT Plus buffer (10
μL) and 100% ethanol (70 μL). After incubation to allow RNA binding (5 min), and after all washing steps,
the beads are pelleted using a DynaMag™-96 side skirted magnet (Thermofisher) and supernatant is
removed. Two washes with 75% ethanol (200 μL and 150 μL) purify the RNA, which is then eluted in 10
mM Tris pH7·5 at 37C (30-50 μL). The eluted RNA is transferred to a new 96-well plate which can be
loaded manually or via robot onto a PCR plate for subsequent real-time PCR detection.
A single-step reverse transcription coupled to a real-time PCR multiplexed assay was used for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) and human RNase P (internal

control) using TaqMan probes (2019-nCoV: Real-Time Fluorescent RT-PCR kit, BGI). Positivity cut-off
based on the receiver operator characteristic curve from testing clinical samples as specified by the
manufacturer instructions was Ct > 38. However, during test validation several non-template negative
controls generated Ct values for RdRp between 35 and 39. Therefore, Ct values below 35 cycles were
deemed positive for SARS-CoV-2, while samples with Ct values between 35 and 40 were rerun. If Ct
values on the rerun were between 35 and 40 for a second time, they were considered “uncertain”.
Standard RNA extraction and RT-qPCR
RNA extraction from swabs was performed using the NUCLISENS easyMAG Kit (Biomerieux) and the
identification of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts encoding N and E was performed using a commercial kit
(Vircell), both according to manufacturer instructions.
Statistics
2
Correlations were analyzed by Pearson’s χ test, and variance between RdRp and RNaseP Ct were

analyzed using Mann-Whitney and unpaired t test, with p<0·05 considered significant.
