Abstract (347/350 words)
Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have a negative impact
on mental health of the population, leading to higher suicide rates, in many countries. However,
little is known about risk factors associated with worsened mental health during the COVID-19
pandemic.
Objective: To investigate the factors associated with serious psychological distress (SPD) during
the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.
Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional study using a large-scale internet survey
conducted between August 25 and September 30, 2020, in Japan.
Exposures: Demographics (age, gender, marital status, family composition, and caregiving
burden), socio-economic status (income level, employment type, educational attainment), the
experience of domestic violence (DV), the state of emergency, fear of COVID-19, and stigma
related to COVID-19.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of SPD, defined as Kessler 6 scale score ≥13.
Results: Among 25,482 individuals included in this study, 2,556 (10%) met the criteria of SPD.
Overall, women (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.59; 95%CI, 1.17–2.16; P=0.003), ages 15–29 (aOR
compared with ages 45–59, 2.35; 95%CI, 1.64–3.38; P<0.001), low income (aOR compared with
intermediate income, 1.70; 95%CI, 1.16–2.49; P=0.007), providing caregiving to family

members (aOR, 5.48; 95%CI, 3.51–8.56; P<0.001), experiencing DV (aOR, 5.72; 95%CI,
3.81–8.59; P<0.001), and fear of COVID-19 (aOR, 1.96; 95%CI, 1.55–2.48; P<0.001) were
associated with a higher rate of SPD. Among women aged 15–29 years, who experienced the
highest rate of SPD, caregiving, DV, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related stigma were
associated with a higher rate of SPD; whereas economic situation (income level and employment
type) and social isolation (marital status) were not associated with the prevalence of SPD.
Conclusions and Relevance: Economic situation, caregiving burden, DV, and fear of
COVID-19 were independently associated with SPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among
young women—who have a higher risk of suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in
Japan—similar factors, except economic situation, were associated with a higher rate of SPD.
Targeted interventions based on age and gender may be more effective in mitigating the negative
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population’s mental health.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 110 million people,
contributed to over 2.4 million deaths globally,1 and has impacted many aspects of our lives. The
COVID-19 pandemic has put a significant burden on our healthcare systems, and many countries
have been struggling with an economic downturn due to reduced economic activities or
lockdowns, leading to widened social inequalities.2 Reduced social interactions due to social
distancing and isolation, as well as economic downturns due to the pandemic, have the potential
to negatively impact mental health conditions leading to psychological distress and increased risk
for psychiatric disorders.3,4 Some countries have been experiencing an increased suicide rate
during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in Japan, the number of people who died of
suicide increased from 20,169 in 2019 to 20,919 in 2020.5 It is important to note that the suicide
rate has increased dramatically among young women during the COVID-19 pandemic,6 and
some have speculated that the economic downturn combined with a relatively unstable
employment status often experienced among this population may be underlying reasons for
increased suicides among this population. Although there are people who commit suicide without
experiencing psychological distress, it is clearly one of the major risk factors for suicide.7
Therefore, identifying risk factors associated with psychological distress is critically important
for policymakers to design interventions that can effectively mitigate deteriorating mental health

conditions.

Research has found that those who are vulnerable to financial stressors (e.g., low-income levels
or unemployed) are associated with psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.8–10
Notably, women and the young are more likely to experience psychological distress,10 although
the risk of severe disease and death due to COVID-19 is higher in men and older adults.11,12 This
may be attributable to the difference in the prevalence of psychological distress. For example,
depression and anxiety are generally more prevalent among women than men.13 However,
specific risk factors associated with psychological distress in women—except the difference in
the prevalence of depression and anxiety—remain unknown, making it difficult for policymakers
to design interventions that can effectively mitigate deteriorating mental health conditions in the
population. Moreover, to our knowledge, no study to date has investigated the factors associated
with psychological distress among young women who are experiencing a higher risk of suicide
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this context, using data from a large-scale internet survey conducted during the COVID-19

pandemic (between August 25 and September 30, 2020) in Japan, we sought to answer two key
questions: What are the factors associated with a higher prevalence of serious psychological
distress (SPD) during the COVID-19 pandemic? What are the risk factors of SPD among young
women who are exhibiting a dramatic increase in suicides during the COVID-19 pandemic in
Japan?

METHODS
Data
We analyzed data from the Japan “COVID-19 and Society” Internet Survey (JACSIS). The
JACSIS is a large-scale, internet-based, self-reported questionnaire survey via a survey panel
provided by a major internet survey agency in Japan (Rakuten Insight, Inc., Tokyo, Japan).14 The
total number of individuals included in the survey panel was approximately 2.2 million and
comprises individuals from diverse socio-economic backgrounds—such as educational level,
household income and number of household members, and marital status—to be nationally
representative.15 This study reached out to 224,389 participants using a stratified sampling
approach by gender, age, and each prefecture from the panel. The study enrollment continued
until it achieved the target numbers of respondents whose age, gender, and prefectures had been

a priori set (based on the distribution of the general Japanese population in 2019; and 28,000
respondents). The survey was conducted between August 25 and September 30, 2020. The
overall response rate accounted for 12.5% (28,000/224,389). This study excluded respondents
whose answers were inconsistent (we included specific items in the survey to identify
inconsistent responses).

Exposure variables
Our exposure variables of interest were respondents’ demographics and socio-economic status
(SES),16 the experience of domestic violence (DV),17 the state of emergency (SOE) in response
to COVID-19 (Supplementary Method),18 fear of COVID-19,19 and stigma related to
COVID-19.20 The demographics included age groups (15–29, 30–44, 45–59, 60–79 years),
gender,16 marital status (unmarried, married, and widowed/separated), having children, and
caregiving to an elderly/disabled family member.21 The SES included educational attainment
(high-school-educated or lower, and college-educated or higher),22 income level (categorized by
the tertiles of household equivalent income [low, <2.5 million JPY; intermediate, 2.5–4.3 million
JPY; high, 4.3< million JPY; unknown/declined to answer]),23 employment type (employer,
self-employed, regular employee, non-regular employee, and unemployed).24 The experiences of
DV (including any of physical, sexual, and financial violence) and COVID-19-related stigma

were defined using the specific survey questions (Supplementary Method). Fear of COVID-19
was categorized by the median of the fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S),25 which is validated in
Japanese.26

Adjustment variables
Adjustment variables were health-related status as follows: smoking status (never, ever, and
current smokers), alcohol use (never, ever, and current users), and comorbidities. The
comorbidities included those at risk of severe COVID-19, which may influence mental health
during the COVID-19 pandemic (hypertension, diabetes, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease [COPD], cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, and psychiatric disorders).27,28

Outcome variable
The outcome variable is SPD, defined as Kessler 6 scale (K-6) score ≥13.29,30 K-6 was validated
in Japanese.31 SPD is a relevant outcome for policy because it is strongly associated with mental
health services.32

Statistical analysis
First, for each gender, we described the exposure variables (demographics, SES, experience of

DV, SOE in relation to COVID-19, fear of and stigma related to COVID-19) and the adjustment
variables (smoking status, alcohol use, and comorbidities) with number and proportion (%) of
each category.

Second, we conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses to determine the potential risk
factors of SPD among exposure variables. To characterize the risk factors for young women in
addition to the general public, we also conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis
focusing on women aged 15–29 years whom prior reports have shown a dramatic increase in the
suicide rate in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic.6 Regarding this analysis, some
comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, COPD, cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer) were
uncommon among young women, and therefore, were not included as adjustment variables.

To account for the differences between the sociodemographic status in actual respondents from
the survey panel and the Japanese general public, we used inverse sampling-probability
weighting for all analyses.33,34 The sampling weights using propensity scores were calculated by
fitting a logistic regression model using sociodemographic and health-related characteristics to
adjust for the difference in respondents between the current internet survey and the 2016
Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions, which is a nationally representative survey in

Japan.33

Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. The data were analyzed using STATA version 16.1
(Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA). We obtained web-based informed consent from all
respondents. The Institutional Review Board of Osaka International Cancer Institute approved
this study (No. 20084).

RESULTS
Characteristics of respondents
After excluding 2,518 respondents who met the exclusion criteria, a total of 25,482 respondents
(91.0% of the overall survey respondents) were included in our study. Of the overall weighted
respondents, 50.3% were women; 27.2% were ages 45–59; 51.2% were college-educated or
higher; 28.8% were low-income level; 63.2% were currently married; and 30.9% were regular
employees (Table 1). The characteristics of overall unweighted respondents and those aged
15–29 years were shown in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2, respectively.

Factors associated with SPD in overall respondents
Of the overall weighted respondents, SPD was prevalent in 10.0% of the individuals (which

amounts to 2,556 cases among 25,482 weighted total). After adjusting for smoking status,
alcohol use, and comorbidities, women (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.59; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.17–2.16; P=0.003); aged 15–29 (aOR, 2.35 compared with ages 45–59 years;
95%CI, 1.64–3.38; P<0.001) and 30–44 (aOR, 1.67; 95%CI, 1.35–2.08; P<0.001); low- (aOR,
1.70 compared with intermediate-income; 95%CI, 1.16–2.49; P=0.007) and high-income level
(aOR, 1.74; 95%CI, 1.25–2.42; P=0.001); self-employed (aOR, 2.11 compared with regular
employee; 95%CI, 1.21–3.68; P=0.008); caregiving to an elderly/disabled family member (aOR,
5.48; 95%CI, 3.51–8.56; P<0.001); experiencing DV (aOR, 5.72; 95%CI, 3.81–8.59; P<0.001);
and fear of COVID-19 (aOR, 1.96; 95%CI, 1.55–2.48; P<0.001) were independently associated
with higher odds of experiencing SPD (Table 2)

Analysis focusing on women aged 15-29 years
Of 2,295 weighted women aged 15–29 years, SPD was prevalent in 15.0% individuals (which
amounts to 344 cases among 2,295 weighted samples). After adjustment for potential
confounders, caregiving to an elderly/disabled family member (aOR, 4.05; 95%CI, 1.69–9.75;
P=0.002), experiencing DV (aOR, 3.44; 95%CI, 1.94–6.11; P<0.001), fear of COVID-19 (aOR,
1.94; 95%CI, 1.30–2.89; P=0.001), and experiencing COVID-19-related stigma (aOR, 2.42;
95%CI, 1.31–4.50; P=0.005) had a significantly higher odds ratio of SPD (Table 3). We found

that economic status (e.g., income level, employment type) or social isolation (e.g., unmarried)
were not associated with a higher prevalence of SPD among this population.

DISCUSSION
Using data from a nationally representative survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic,
we identified several important factors that were associated with a higher rate of SPD in Japan.
We found that women, younger age, income level, employment type, caregiving status, DV
experience, and fear of COVID-19 were independently associated with SPD. Among young
women—who are exhibiting an increased suicide rate during the COVID-19 pandemic in
Japan—experiencing DV, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related stigma were risk factors of
SPD. On the other hand, economic situation and social isolation—factors considered to be causes
of an increased suicide rate among this population—were not associated with the rate of SPD.
Taken together, these findings indicate that underlying reasons for SPD may vary based on
subgroups of the population, and therefore, targeted interventions based on age and gender may
be more effective in mitigating negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population’s
mental health.

There are several potential mechanisms that may explain the factors associated with SPD in

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.27.21252458; this version posted March 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

Japan. First, economic downturns due to the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the
mental health condition of the population. For example, we found that having a low-income level
and being self-employed were associated with SPD, suggesting that the individuals in the general
public were potentially vulnerable population affected by economic stagnation itself and social
distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.35,36 Second, social isolation due to the SOE may
cause a heavier burden of caregiving as well as DV from partners, resulting in mental illness. In
our study, caregiving to an elderly/disabled family member was associated with SPD in both the
general public and young women. It is known that reported cases of DV increased while people
were staying home,37 probably leading to worse mental health conditions. Finally, as COVID-19
spread and society dramatically changed, fears about COVID-19 gradually developed making
people psychologically unstable. Our findings, in which fear of COVID-19 was associated with
SPD in all analyses, support this hypothesis.

Evidence is limited as to which factors affected mental health status at the population level
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wang et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis
examining the factors associated with psychological distress (i.e., anxiety and depression) in the
general population, and found that women, younger age, and lower SES were associated with
both anxiety and depression.10 Regarding gender- and age-related risk factors, Rehm and Shield

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.27.21252458; this version posted March 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

reported that anxiety and depression are more prevalent in women than in men.13 In addition to
such pre-existing psychological distress, previous studies reported that women in
preconception,38 pregnancy,39 or postpartum periods40 experienced anxiety or depressive
symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. While informative, evidence regarding young
women in the factors associated with SPD is limited. To our knowledge, this is the first study that
has examined the risk factors of SPD comprehensively in both the general public and the
mentally vulnerable population (young women) using large-scale, nationally representative data.

Our study has limitations. First, because this survey was conducted between August and
September 2020, it is possible that our findings would have been different if more recent data
had been used. However, the data was collected just before October, 2020, when suicides among
young women actually increased in Japan,41 and therefore, our findings may reflect the most
critical period regarding the underlying reasons for increased suicide rates in Japan. Second, due
to the self-reported design of our study, not all the variables were based on the validated
questionnaire. For example, COVID-19-related stigma, which was an important risk factor for
SPD among young women, was collected via a single-item questionnaire we developed, resulting
in a lack of detailed stigma profiles.42 However, our survey used the items (K-6 scale), the
reliability and validity of which have been tested and verified in prior studies.31,43 Third, given

that our data were collected using an internet-based survey, respondents may be different in
meaningful ways than those who were not recruited. However, we used propensity-score
weighted analysis to adjust for the demographic, socio-economic, and health-related differences
between respondents of the present study and the Japanese general public.33,34 Finally, our
findings may not be generalizable to populations in other countries.

Using large-scale, nationally representative survey data, we identified several important factors
associated with SPD during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan’s general population. In particular,
we found that female gender, younger age, income level, employment type, caregiving status,
DV experience, and fear of COVID-19 were key risk factors for a higher rate of SPD. Among
young women who presented higher suicide rates during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan,
experience of DV, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related stigma were risk factors associated
with SPD. Our findings highlight the importance of designing countermeasures based on the age
and gender of the population to more effectively mitigate negative impacts on mental health
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Notes. All proportions are expressed as weighted numbers and weighted percentages (%). The sum of respondents
did not necessarily equal the number of categories because of sample weighting and rounding. The weights, which
were scaled such that the total came to 25,482 (original number of respondents), were predicted from the logistic
model including area (residence), marital status, education, home-ownership (household), self-rated health and
smoking status were adjusted for in individuals aged 20-79 years; and area, education, home-ownership (household)
and self-rated health were adjusted for (omitting marital and smoking status) in individuals aged 15-19 years.
