Abstract
Background
In England, hospitalisations and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 have been falling consistently
since January 2021 during the third national lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first
significant relaxation of that lockdown occurred on 8 March when schools reopened.
Methods
The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study augments
routine surveillance data for England by measuring swab-positivity for SARS-CoV-2 in the
community. The current round, round 10, collected swabs from 11 to 30 March 2021 and is
compared here to round 9, in which swabs were collected from 4 to 23 February 2021.
Results
During round 10, we estimated an R number of 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.81, 1.21).
Between rounds 9 and 10 we estimated national prevalence has dropped by ~60% from
0.49% (0.44%, 0.55%) in February to 0.20% (0.17%, 0.23%) in March. There were
substantial falls in weighted regional prevalence: in South East from 0.36% (0.29%, 0.44%)
in round 9 to 0.07% (0.04%, 0.12%) in round 10; London from 0.60% (0.48%, 0.76%) to
0.16% (0.10%, 0.26%); East of England from 0.47% (0.36%, 0.60%) to 0.15% (0.10%,
0.24%); East Midlands from 0.59% (0.45%, 0.77%) to 0.19% (0.13%, 0.28%); and North
West from 0.69% (0.54%, 0.88%) to 0.31% (0.21%, 0.45%). Areas of apparent higher
prevalence remain in parts of the North West, and Yorkshire and The Humber. The highest
prevalence in March was found among school-aged children 5 to 12 years at 0.41% (0.27%,
0.62%), compared with the lowest in those aged 65 to 74 and 75 and over at 0.09% (0.05%,
0.16%). The close approximation between prevalence of infections and deaths (suitably
lagged) is diverging, suggesting that infections may have resulted in fewer hospitalisations
and deaths since the start of widespread vaccination.
Conclusion
We report a sharp decline in prevalence of infections between February and March 2021.
We did not observe an increase in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 following the reopening of
schools in England, although the decline of prevalence appears to have stopped. Future
rounds of REACT-1 will be able to measure the rate of growth or decline from this current
plateau and hence help assess the effectiveness of the vaccination roll-out on transmission
of the virus as well as the potential size of any third wave during the ensuing months.

Introduction
During the spring of 2021, many European populations are suffering from substantial third
waves of the COVID-19 pandemic with high pressure on health care systems [1] resulting in
stringent social distancing. In England, during the third national lockdown, hospitalisations
and deaths have fallen consistently since early January [2]. However, since the first
substantial relaxation of lockdown in England with the opening of schools on 8 March 2021
[3], the rate of decline of new cases has slowed considerably [2]. Large-scale testing of
school children and their families using lateral flow devices accompanied the opening of
schools [4].
The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study augments
routine surveillance data for England by measuring swab-positivity for SARS-CoV-2 in a
random sample of the community recruited regardless of symptom status [5]. We present
here the results from round 10 of REACT-1 from swabs collected from 11 to 30 March 2021.
We compare the results of REACT-1 round 10 to round 9, in which swabs were collected
from 4 to 23 February 2021.
Results
In round 10 we found 227 positives from 140,844 swabs giving an unweighted prevalence of
0.16% (0.14%, 0.18%) and a weighted prevalence of 0.20% (0.17%, 0.23%) (Table 1). This
represents a ~60% reduction from round 9 in which unweighted prevalence was 0.42%
(0.39%, 0.45%) and weighted prevalence was 0.49% (0.44%, 0.55%).
Using a constant growth rate model, on average for England, we found evidence for a
decline over the period of round 9 to 10 (Table 2, Figure 1) with an estimated halving time of
26 (23, 31) days and a corresponding R of 0.84 (0.82, 0.86). Within round 10, we estimate
an R of 1.00 (0.81, 1.21) with 51% probability that R > 1. These results suggest a slow down
in the rate of decline, with prevalence plateauing at around 1 in 500 during round 10 (Figure
1). These results were largely unchanged in sensitivity analyses in which subsets of positive
samples were considered: non-symptomatics, only participants with swabs positive for both
E and N genes, and only those positive for N gene with a CT value of 35 or below. However,
we estimated a lower R of 0.72 (0.50, 0.99) for round 10 based only on the prevalence of
positive swabs taken from non-symptomatic participants (Table 2).
At regional level, R over the period of rounds 9 to 10 ranged from 0.75 (0.68, 0.81) in South
East to 0.95 (0.87, 1.03) in Yorkshire and The Humber. We estimated a 12% probability that

R > 1 between rounds 9 and 10 in Yorkshire and the Humber, while the probability of R >1
was less than 1% in all other regions (Table 3).
Reflecting these regional R numbers, there were substantial falls in weighted regional
prevalence: in South East from 0.36% (0.29%, 0.44%) in round 9 to 0.07% (0.04%, 0.12%)
in round 10; London from 0.60% (0.48%, 0.76%) to 0.16% (0.10%, 0.26%); East of England
from 0.47% (0.36%, 0.60%) to 0.15% (0.10%, 0.24%); East Midlands from 0.59% (0.45%,
0.77%) to 0.19% (0.13%, 0.28%); and North West from 0.69% (0.54%, 0.88%) to 0.31%
(0.21%, 0.45%) (Table 4, Figure 2).
At sub-regional scale, areas of apparent higher prevalence remain in round 10 in parts of
North West, and Yorkshire and The Humber (Figure 3).
We found the highest weighted prevalence of swab-positivity in those aged 5 to 12 years at
0.41% (0.27%, 0.62%) compared with the lowest in those aged 65 to 74 years and 75 years
and over at 0.09% (0.05%, 0.16%) (Table 4, Figure 4). As with prior rounds, we found much
higher prevalence of swab-positivity during round 10 in those who had come into contact
with a confirmed COVID-19 case at 4.9% (3.4%, 7.0%) compared with those who had not at
0.14% (0.11%, 0.17%) (Table 4a). Also, those living in the least deprived neighbourhoods
had a lower prevalence of swab-positivity at 0.13% (0.09%, 0.17%) compared with 0.33%
(0.23%, 0.47%) for those in the most deprived neighbourhoods (Table 4a).
Frequency of foreign travel remained low overall during round 10 compared with prior
rounds of REACT-1 (Figure 5). Foreign travel remains higher in London compared with other
regions except for Yorkshire and The Humber.
We investigated the relationship between swab-positivity, as estimated in rounds 1 to 8 of
REACT-1, and hospital admissions (Figure 6), and deaths (Figure 7) from publicly available
national data. We estimated lags of 18 (18, 18) days between the timing of swab results and
hospital admissions, and 27 (27, 27) days between swab and death to give the best fit to
REACT-1 rounds 1 to 8 prevalence data. During the period of round 9, curves for deaths and
(more marginally) for hospital admissions diverged from the prevalence P-spline, suggesting
that infections may have resulted in fewer hospitalisations and deaths since the start of
widespread vaccination.
Discussion
In this tenth round of the REACT-1 study carried out from 11 to 30 March 2021, we report an
approximate 60% reduction in prevalence since the previous round from 4 to 23 February.
These rounds occurred during the third national lockdown in England [6] following the

second wave of infections, which grew rapidly through December 2020 until the beginning of
January 2021. The most recent round also covered the start of the gradual easing of
lockdown [3], notably the opening up of schools from 8 March 2021.
Our data indicate a slowing of the epidemic from February to March, with the national R
number over that period reliably below one. However, in the most recent data for March, the
rate of decline slowed and prevalence flattened at 1 in 500 (0.20%) people infected overall,
with prevalence highest in primary and early secondary school-aged children (5 to 12 years)
and lowest in those above the age of 65 years. The lower rate among older adults is
consistent with an effect from the vaccination roll-out in England, that has focused initially on
older people and the most vulnerable.
Our analysis of mortality and to a lesser extent hospitalisation trends is consistent with the
vaccination programme contributing in part to lower rates of severe outcomes in the older
age group. In recent rounds of REACT-1 there was a close approximation between
prevalence of infection (measured by REACT-1) and hospitalisation and mortality rates (from
publicly available national data sources, after considering a suitable lag period between
infection and outcome). This relationship has diverged, particularly for deaths, from late
January onwards and is in keeping with the timing of the roll-out of the mass vaccination
programme. This observation is consistent with studies in Scotland [7] and Israel [8] which
reported high efficacy of vaccination against severe disease. It will be important to monitor
future trends in the relationship between infections, deaths and hospitalisations in England.
Specifically if the approximation of the infection and mortality curves revert to prior patterns,
this might indicate an increase in frequency of variants associated with reduced efficacy of
the vaccine. We note that during early rounds of REACT-1 the relationship between
infections and mortality appeared weaker: this likely reflects a higher proportion of infections
occurring in health and care facilities at that time rather than in the community later in the
epidemic [9].
Swab-positivity was over 30-fold higher in participants who reported contact with a confirmed
case compared with those who did not. This reinforces the high potential value of testing
known contacts even though manual contact tracing alone may not be sufficient to achieve
R < 1 in the absence of other interventions [10,11]. Further, the consistently higher rates of
infection in the most deprived neighbourhoods observed in REACT-1 suggest a potential
role for targeted highly-local interventions during periods of lower prevalence, even when the
presence of a novel variant is not a primary concern [12].
Prevalence of infection in England is now at a level last seen in early September 2020, and
nearing the prevalence at the end of the first lockdown in England in May 2020. The

Government in England has adopted a cautionary approach to easing of lockdown with
approximately five week intervals between each step toward ‘normalisation’ of activities
including opening of non-essential shops, indoor sports, outdoor hospitality and personal
services (such as hairdressing) from 12 April 2021 [3]. This approach allows time to assess
the effect of each step on the transmission of the virus and the R number, which will be
measured in subsequent REACT-1 surveys, among others, over the ensuing period.
Meanwhile, our estimate of 1.0 for the R number in March suggests that the fine balance
between the cautious opening up of society and the need to control the levels of infection
has not so far resulted in a third wave of infections. The continued roll-out of the vaccination
programme, including second doses, and the extension to adult ages below 50 years will
further increase immunity in the population.
Methods
REACT-1 involves a random sample of the population in England (ages 5 years and over)
who are invited to undertake a self-administered throat and nose swab in the home
(parent/guardian administered at ages 5 to 12 years) and complete a health and lifestyle
questionnaire [5]. We request that completed swabs are refrigerated before being
transported by courier and sent chilled to the laboratory for RT-PCR testing.
We obtain the sample using the National Health Service patient register and aim to achieve
approximately equal numbers of participants in each of the 315 lower tier local authorities
(LTLAs) in England. In round 10, we sent out 760,000 letters to named individuals and
dispatched 180,106 (23.7%) test kits, resulting in 140,844 (78.2%) completed swabs with a
valid test result. This gave an overall response rate (valid swabs divided by total number of
letters sent) of 18.5%.
We obtain prevalence of RT-PCR swab-positivity with and without weighting. This is done
both to take account of the sample design (balanced by LTLA, not by population) and to
adjust for variable non-response. The aim is to provide prevalence estimates (national,
regional, and by specific demographic and occupational groups) that are representative of
the population of England as a whole, by age, sex, region and ethnicity. We also obtain a
map of smoothed prevalence at LTLA level by use of a neighbourhood spatial smoothing
method across nearest neighbours up to 30 km.
We use exponential growth models to estimate the reproduction number R, across and
within rounds. Across all rounds, we fit a smoothed P-spline function to the daily prevalence
data, with knots at 5-day intervals, to examine trends in unweighted prevalence over time
[13]. We compare the daily prevalence data in REACT-1 with the publicly available national

daily hospital admissions and COVID-19 mortality data (deaths within 28 days of a positive
test), with allowance for a suitable discrete-day lag period between infection and either
hospital admission or death and an appropriate scaling parameter.
In sensitivity analyses for the estimation of R, we provide alternative cut-points of cycle
threshold (CT) values for swab-positivity and restrict the analyses only to those who did not
report symptoms in the previous week.
Statistical analyses were carried out in R [14]. We obtained research ethics approval from
the South Central-Berkshire B Research Ethics Committee (IRAS ID: 283787).

Figure 3. Neighbourhood prevalence of swab-positivity for rounds 9 and 10. Neighbourhood
prevalence calculated from 4,732 (round 9) and 4,016 (round 10) nearest neighbours in the
sample (the median number of neighbours within 30km in the study). Neighbourhood
prevalence displayed as an average of a random sample of 15 participants for each
lower-tier local authority (LTLA). Regions: NE = North East, NW = North West, YH =
Yorkshire and The Humber, EM = East Midlands, WM = West Midlands, EE = East of
England, L = London, SE = South East, SW = South West.

Figure 6. Daily hospital admissions in England (solid red line, right hand y-axis) shifted by a
lag parameter along the x-axis (see below), and daily swab-positivity for all 9 rounds of the
study (dots with 95% confidence intervals, left hand y-axis) and the P-spline estimate for
swab positivity (Solid black line, dark grey shaded area is 50% central credible interval, light
grey shaded area is 95% central credible interval, left-hand y-axis). Daily hospital
admissions have been fit to observations from the REACT-1 rounds 1-8 to obtain scaling and
lag parameters. These parameter values were estimated using a Bayesian MCMC model:
daily_positives(t) ~ Binomial(daily_swab_tests(t), p = daily_admissions(t+lag)*scale). The
discrete time lag parameter was estimated at 18 (18, 18) days. Note the P-spline is not
plotted for the region between round 7 and 8 in which there was a peak in swab-positivity
while REACT-1 was not active.
