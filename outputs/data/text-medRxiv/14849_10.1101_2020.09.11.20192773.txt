Abstract

38

Background: A rapidly increasing number of serological surveys for

39

anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been reported worldwide. A synthesis of this

40

large corpus of data is needed.

41

Purpose: To evaluate the quality of serological studies and provide a global

42

picture of seroprevalence across demographic and occupational groups, and to

43

provide guidance for conducting better serosurveys.

44

Data sources: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and 4 pre-print

45

servers for English-language papers published from December 1, 2019 to

46

September 25, 2020.

47

Study selection: Serological studies evaluating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in

48

humans.

49

Data extraction: Two investigators independently extracted data from studies.

50

Data Synthesis: Most of 230 serological studies, representing tests

51

in >1,400,000 individuals, identified were of low quality based on a standardized

52

study quality scale. In the 51 studies of higher quality, high-risk healthcare

53

workers had higher seroprevalence of 17.1% (95% CI: 9.9-24.4%), compared to

54

low-risk healthcare workers and general population of 5.4% (0.7-10.1%) and 5.3%

55

(4.2-6.4%). Seroprevalence varied hugely across WHO regions, with lowest

56

seroprevalence of general population in Western Pacific region (1.7%, 0.0-5.0%).

57

Generally, the young (<20 years) and the old (≥65 years) were less likely to be

58

seropositive compared to middle-aged (20-64 years) populations.

59

Seroprevalence correlated with clinical COVID-19 reports, with pooled average of

60

7.7 (range: 2.0 to 23.1) serologically-detected-infections per confirmed COVID-19

61

case.

62

Limitations: Some heterogeneity cannot be well explained quantitatively.

63

Conclusions: The overall quality of seroprevalence studies examined was low.

64

The relatively low seroprevalence among general populations suggest that in

65

most settings, antibody-mediated herd immunity is far from being reached. Given

66

the relatively narrow range of estimates of the ratio of serologically-detected

67

infections to confirmed cases across different locales, reported case counts may

68

help provide insights into the true proportion of the population infected.

Introduction

73

The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute

74

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan,

75

Hubei province in December, 2019 and quickly spread globally (1). As of October

76

13, 2020, more than 37 million COVID-19 cases, including 1,077,799 deaths, had

77

been reported in 235 countries/regions (2, 3). The real number of SARS-CoV-2

78

infections is undoubtedly much higher than the officially reported cases due to

79

various factors, including the occurrence of asymptomatic infections, variable

80

healthcare-seeking for clinically mild cases, varied testing strategies in different

81

countries, false-negative virologic tests, and incomplete case reporting. Therefore,

82

the reported COVID-19 cases based on clinical identification with virologic

83

confirmation only represents the “tip of iceberg”, with a large number of

84

asymptomatic and mild infections in the general population who may only be

85

identified by seroepidemiological studies (4).

86
87

Serological studies are a useful tool to estimate the proportion of the population

88

previously infected, to quantify the magnitude of transmission of pathogens,

89

estimate the infection fatality rate (5), assess the impact of interventions (6), and

90

when correlates of protection are available, estimate the degree of population

91

immunity (7, 8). Insights from serological surveillance can be valuable for

92

policymakers and health officials when planning public health decision-making.

94

A large number of serological investigations across the world have been

95

published during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, with highly

96

variable estimates of seroprevalence that may largely be due to differences in

97

attack rates, but which also feature heterogeneous sampling strategies and

98

assays used. Two rapid systematic reviews of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence were

99

identified (in preprint at the time of writing) but both had a limited scope and

100

did not explore important differences between subpopulations, assess study

101

quality or perform standard meta-analyses techniques (9, 10).

102
103

Here, we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize serologic

104

surveys for SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans, to comprehensively evaluate the

105

study designs, laboratory methods, and outcome interpretations for each

106

included serological study, and to estimate the risk of infections by populations

107

with different presumed levels of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. We aim for these

108

results to help inform decision makers and researchers alike as plans are made

109

for the next phases of the global pandemic.

Study Selection and Extraction

119

Two independent researchers screened titles and abstracts of English-language

120

papers published from December 1, 2019 to September 25, 2020 meeting the

121

following criteria: (1) a report of seroprevalence in either the general population

122

or some other well-defined population of non-COVID clinical cases; (2)

123

conducted after the first reported case in the area and (3) reported the specific

124

assays used. We excluded studies that only reported serologic responses among

125

COVID-19 patients, those using samples with known infection status (e.g.

126

validation studies of assays), and animal experiments. We excluded abstracts of

127

congress meetings or conference proceedings, study protocols, media news,

128

commentaries, reviews or case reports.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

131

The full text of included studies after initial screening were scrutinized to assess

132

the overall eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria by two

133

independent researchers. A third researcher was consulted when the two

134

reviewers disagreed on study assessment. For eligible studies, data were

135

extracted by researchers on the number of participants who provided specimens

136

and the number of these who were seropositive to calculate the seroprevalence.

137

When data were inconsistent between reviewers, they were asked to discuss and

138

revisit the article until reaching a consensus. We developed a scoring system on

139

the basis of a seroepidemiological protocol from Consortium for the

140

Standardization of Influenza Seroepidemiology (CONSISE), a previously

141

published scoring system for seroprevalence studies of zoonotic influenza

142

viruses, and a seroepidemiological protocol developed by World Health

143

Organization (WHO), to further assess the study quality (12-14). We

144

comprehensively assessed study design (representativeness of study

145

participants), laboratory assay (whether internal assay validations or a

146

confirmatory assay was performed) and outcome adjustment (correction for

147

demographics and/or test performance) and based on a scoring scheme, an

148

overall score was determined for each included study (Appendix Table 6). From

149

this score, we classified each study’s quality into one of four grades: A, B, C or D.

150

Grade A, the highest quality category, spanned studies with scores ranging from

151

12 to 10, grade B from 9 to 7, grade C from 4 to 6, and grade D from 0 to 3. We

152

only included grade A and grade B studies in the main analysis but provide

153

additional results with all studies, irrespective of grade, in the supplement. We

154

also described the characteristics, laboratory testing method, and primary

155

outcome for each available study in Appendix Table 2-5.

160

original study. For serial cross-sectional studies, we calculated the sum of the

161

total number of participants who provided specimens and total number of

162

seropositive individuals during the whole study period, to avoid repeated

163

inclusion of the same study. Similarly, only data from the first blood collection

164

were analyzed for studies with a longitudinal design. For studies that used

165

multiple serological assays, we used the seropositive results from the assay with

166

the highest sensitivity and specificity (calculated by Youden’s index). We also

167

conducted a sensitivity analysis with results from the other assays (Appendix

168

Table 10). If a study used a confirmatory assay (e.g. microneutralization assay)

169

to validate the positive and/or equivocal result from the initial screening, we

170

used the results from the confirmatory assay. For those studies reporting

171

multiple isotypes including IgG, we included only IgG in the main analyses as

172

they remain elevated for a longer period post-infection compared to IgM and IgA

173

(15). If seropositivity based only on IgG was not reported separately or

174

seropositivity reported was based only on total antibodies, these results were

175

also included. While many studies did adjust for various factors, we decided to

176

use the crude (unadjusted) estimates in our analyses to ease interpretation

177

across different studies.

178
179

To reduce heterogeneity between individual seroprevalence estimates and to

180

provide more meaningful summary statistics, we stratified eligible studies by

181

WHO regions (i.e. African region, Region of Americas, Eastern Mediterranean

182

Region, European Region, South-East Asia Region, Western Pacific Region)(16).

183

To estimate seroprevalence by different types of exposures, within each WHO

184

region, we categorized all study participants into five groups: 1) close contacts, 2)

185

high-risk healthcare workers, 3) low-risk healthcare workers, 4) general

186

populations, and 5) poorly-defined populations (Appendix Table 5). The

187

poorly-defined population classification represents populations with undefined

188

or unknown exposure to laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients

189

(e.g., blood donors, residual blood samples from labs, patients of other diseases,

190

etc.), as well as study populations that cannot be categorized into the first four

191

study populations due to limited exposure information [e.g., healthcare workers

192

without reporting usage of PPE (personal protective equipment) or

193

COVID-19-related exposures]. Based on a random-effect meta-analysis model, we

194

used inverse variance method to estimate pooled seroprevalence by WHO

195

regions and different sub-populations, combined with the use of

196

Clopper-Pearson method to calculate 95% confidence intervals (17, 18).

197
198

For seroprevalence estimates from the general population, we further explored

199

potential determinants affecting the seroprevalence, such as sex, age, and the

200

reported cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases for the location. We calculated

201

cumulative incidence of confirmed COVID-19 by dividing the number of cases

202

reported in the same target population as the serosurvey two weeks before the

203

serosurvey mid-point at the location, by the estimated population size.

204

Furthermore, we meta-analyzed the number of serologically-detected infections

205

(the number of individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 serology) per confirmed

206

case (the number of reported cases in the serologic study’s target population)

207

with available epidemiological data included in the articles, the WHO website

208

(19), the COVID-19 dashboard of Johns Hopkins University (2), and local health

209

authorities (20). Unless reported in the article, we used population size estimates

210

from WorldPop (21) or a local statistics bureau (22). Studies were included in the

211

meta-analyses of the ratio of serologically-detected infections per confirmed

212

cases if they reported seroprevalence in the representative general population

213

(non-convenience sample) with population data and confirmed case data

214

available for the same population.

215
216

Variability between studies was determined by the heterogeneity tests with

217

Higgins’ I² statistic. We explored the reasons for variations among eligible studies

218

and examined whether prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies varied by

219

study location, study quality, and level of exposure by multivariable

220

meta-regression models. All statistical analyses were done using R (version

221

3.6.3), with ‘meta’ package to conduct the meta-analysis. For all statistical tests,

222

two tailed P-value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

231

We identified a total of 8,487 studies after systematically searching multiple data

232

sources with 4,763 coming from peer-reviewed databases, 3,710 from preprint

233

severs and 14 reports from governments or health authorities. After removing

234

duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, 1,535 studies reporting serological

235

evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections were found. Finally, a total of 230 studies

236

involving 1,445,028 participants were included in our meta-analysis after

237

full-text scrutiny (Figure 1), with the majority of studies conducted in European

238

Region (n=106), Region of the Americas (n=69), and Western Pacific Region

239

(n=34) (Figure 1, Appendix Figure S9). Among 214 studies reporting the exact

240

starting sampling date, seventeen (17/214, 8%) were conducted after more than

241

75% of the total cases (in that country/states/provinces) had been reported as of

242

Sept 25, 2020, most of which (14/17, 82%) were conducted in China (Appendix

243

Figure 2-7). For those seventeen studies, the serosurveys were conducted a

244

median of 46 days (range: 12-102) after the epidemic peak. Similarly, fifty-three

245

studies (53/214, 25%) were conducted after more than 50% of total cases had

246

been reported, with a median of 40 (range: 2-113) days after the peak.

248

General populations (55/230, 24%) and healthcare workers (both high-risk and

249

low-risk healthcare workers) (78/230, 34%) were sampled with the highest

250

frequency. The age profile of participants varied across studies of different

251

targeted populations (Appendix Table 2). Most studies involved participants

252

aged 18-69 years (222/230 studies) and only seven studies exclusively recruited

253

young people (<18 years), including two papers focusing on children (<10 years),

254

and one exclusively targeting older (>80 years) persons from nursing home

255

(Appendix Table 2).

256
257

The overall quality of studies was low based on our grading system (Appendix

258

Table 6). The majority of studies were categorized as Grades C or D (Appendix

259

Figure 1), including all but one study of high-risk healthcare workers, and all

260

studies of close contacts. Of the 55 general-population-based studies, 5 achieved

261

Grade A, and 19 achieved Grade B.

262
263

Approximately two-third of studies (149/230, 65%) described serological results

264

from convenience samples, while only thirty studies (30/230, 13%) used

265

multi-stage/stratified random sampling to select study participants. Most studies

266

measured IgG antibodies using chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA,

267

92/230, 40%), followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA,

268

80/230, 35%), and lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA, 59/230, 26%), with 19%

269

(43/230) of studies using more than one serologic assay. Additionally, nineteen

270

studies utilized a microneutralization assay to detect neutralizing antibodies.

271

Among 165 studies that provided the targeted protein for serological assays, 123

272

(75%) studies used tests targeting the S-protein, and 104 (63%) studies used

273

tests targeting the N-protein. More than half of the studies (126/230, 55%)

274

reported age/sex-specific seroprevalence or corrected their findings for age

275

and/or sex. Thirty-one studies (31/230, 13%) adjusted for sensitivity and

276

specificity of the serological assay(s). Only twenty-eight studies corrected for

277

both demographic factors and test performance.

278
279

Among 51 Grade-A and Grade-B studies, seroprevalence varied across WHO

280

regions and study populations. Generally, high-risk healthcare workers had a

281

higher seroprevalence (17.1%, 95% CI: 9.9-24.4%), compared to low-risk

282

healthcare workers (5.4%, 95% CI: 0.7-10.1%) and general populations (5.3%,

283

95% CI: 4.2-6.4%) (Figure 3A, Appendix Table 9). The seroprevalence of the

284

populations in studies that did not specify exposure was 4.1% (95% CI: 3.0-5.1%)

285

(Figure 3A, Appendix Table 9). Estimates of seroprevalence from the general

286

population was highest in the one study conducted in the African Region (25.4%,

287

95% CI:19.1-31.7%), followed by Eastern Mediterranean Region (2 studies,

288

14.4%, 95% CI:2.2-26.7%), Region of the Americas (9 studies, 5.2%, 95%

289

CI:2.9-7.5%), and European Region (10 studies, 4.2%, 95% CI:2.7-5.8%), with the

290

lowest seroprevalence in studies conducted in the Western Pacific Region (2

291

studies, 1.7%, 95% CI:0.0-5.0%) (Figure 3B-G, Appendix Table 9). Sensitivity

to our main analysis (Appendix Table 10).

295
296

The seroprevalence increased with age for study participants under 65 years,

297

constituting 1.5% (95% CI: 0.0-3.1%), 4.2% (95% CI: 2.1-6.2%) and 5.2% (95%

298

CI: 3.2-7.2%) for study participants younger than 20 years, 20-49 years, and

299

50-64 years among the 51 studies graded as A or B (Figure 3H). A similar

300

tendency was also observed when analyzing by WHO regions (Appendix Figure

301

10B-C). After further (imperfectly) merging age groups, the relative risk of

302

seropositivity in the young (<20 years) was approximately 20% lower than that

303

of the middle-age group (20-64 years) (RR=0.76, 95%CI: 0.69-0.85), suggesting

304

young individuals may be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infections or may

305

mount a less robust antibody response (Appendix Table 12). The risk of

306

seropositivity in the old (≥ 65 years) was also lower compared to the middle-age

307

group (RR=0.71, 95%CI: 0.54-0.94) (Appendix Table 12).

308
309

Pooled seroprevalence of males (5.0%, 95% CI: 3.4-6.6%) and females (4.4%, 95%

310

CI: 2.7-6.0%) were similar, with 58% (7/12) of studies reporting sex-specific

311

seroprevalence having higher point estimates of seroprevalence in males than

312

females (Figure 3I). Similarly, pooling sex-specific relative risks across studies to

313

adjust for the differences in risk across settings revealed no significant increase

314

in risk of seropositivity in males (RR=1.03, 95% CI: 0.95-1.13) (Appendix Table

315

12), with similar estimates across WHO regions (Appendix Table 12).

316
317

The relationship between reported COVID-19 incidence (confirmed cases

318

reported from public sources) and the number of infections identified through

319

serologic surveys can be useful for trying to understand the evolution of the

320

pandemic without serologic surveillance in each and every locale. For studies of

321

the general population, the cumulative reported incidence of COVID-19

322

correlated with seroprevalence across locations (Pearson correlation coefficient:

323

0.80), though this is largely driven by one study (Appendix Figure 11). For

324

studies including individuals from general populations, the ratio of

325

serologically-detected infections to virologically-confirmed cases varied across

326

locations, with a pooled ratio of 7.7 (95% CI: 5.5-10.9), suggesting that for each

327

virologically confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection, at least 6 infections remained

328

undetected by surveillance systems. This ratio was similar between the Region of

329

the Americas (7.9, 95% CI: 1.7-35.3) and the European Region (7.7, 95%CI:

330

5.8-10.2) (Figure 4).

Discussion

333

With the increasing availability of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2, a large body

334

of literature describing seroprevalence studies in different populations has also

335

emerged. In this study, we examine the quality and results of over two hundred

336

reports of seroprevalence studies from around the globe, both published, and in

337

preprint form. In general, the quality of existing serological studies was low,

338

involving less rigorous sampling strategies, poorly-validated and

339

non-standardized laboratory methods, and lack of statistical correction in

340

analyses. As expected, we found that high-risk healthcare workers had higher

341

prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies than that of low-risk healthcare

342

workers and the general population. Young individuals (<20 years) and older

343

persons (≥65 years) are less likely to be seropositive than those of middle age

344

(20-64 years), while there was not a significant difference in seroprevalence

345

between males and females. Additionally, we find that the ratio of infections per

346

confirmed case is generally on the same order of magnitude across populations

347

with very different surveillance and healthcare systems.

348
349

Representative serosurveys can provide useful snapshots of the infection history

350

of a population. However, very few studies (30/230, 13%) provided

351

representative estimates for their target population. An optimal study design for

352

estimating seroprevalence includes a detailed sampling framework, rigorous

353

sampling methods (i.e. multi-stage, stratified sampling), and adjustments for

354

selection bias and assay performance (12).

355
356

Various detection assays were used for determination of seropositivity. We found

357

large variations in test performance, targeted antigens and immunoglobulin

358

isotypes, and threshold used. Furthermore, more than half of the studies lacked

359

independent validations of the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic kits

360

prior to assessment of serosurvey samples to verify their initial results (23-25).

361

Notably, although the WHO established a generic population-based serological

362

study protocol, there is a lack of standardized guidelines and procedures for

363

laboratory testing, which may contribute towards such heterogeneity in both

364

performance and reporting of results. We call on national and international

365

governance bodies to develop standardized antibody testing protocols and

366

reporting practices and create biobanks of reference standards (e.g. monoclonal

367

antibodies), to reduce lab-to-lab variations, thus facilitating the comparability

368

and interpretability amongst seroprevalence studies. Despite the WHO

369

recommendations, the estimates described by many of the population-based

370

serosurveys did not adjust for demographic structure of the target population

371

(14), nor the testing performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the assay, which

372

made the comparison among studies difficult.

373
374

Most of the high-quality serological surveys identified were conducted in the

375

Region of the Americas and the European Region, predominantly on general

376

populations. There were a very limited number of high-quality studies of

377

exposed populations, especially for healthcare workers and close contacts, and

378

studies to address this knowledge gap are needed. For the other four WHO

379

regions examined, there was a paucity of high-quality studies across all

380

populations examined, suggesting that attention should be paid to optimize the

381

design of future sero-epidemiological studies to include good representativeness

382

of samples, standardized laboratory methods, and reasonable adjustments.

383

Higher quality studies provide more accurate measures of disease burden and

384

transmission, to better inform public health efforts against COVID-19.

385
386

We found high seroprevalence among high-risk healthcare workers, defined as

387

those who provided routine medical care to COVID-19 patients without PPE. On

388

the contrary, low-risk healthcare workers, defined as those wearing adequate

389

PPE or those who provided care for non-COVID-19 patients, had seroprevalence

390

estimates closer to (and with overlapping confidence intervals) that of the

391

general population (26). We found a pooled seroprevalence of 5.3% in the

392

general population, suggesting that globally, the number of persons infected thus

393

far is unlikely to approach that satisfying estimates of what it would take to

394

achieve antibody-mediated herd immunity (27-29). The seroprevalence in the

395

general population also varied across WHO regions, indicating different levels of

396

community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in different locales. In addition, the very

397

limited number of high-quality studies in all but two of the WHO regions

398

underlines our incomplete understanding of COVID-19 burden in much of the

399

world. (30) We also found notable differences in seroprevalence between age

400

groups, with the seroprevalence increasing with age among participants younger

401

than 65 years. We found that the young (<20 years) were less likely to be

402

seropositive compared to middle-aged (20-64 years) individuals, consistent with

403

reports of lower numbers of virally-confirmed cases in children compared to

404

other age groups (31). In some areas, this may have been due to the effects of

405

lockdowns, limiting exposures of school-aged populations, in contrast to

406

adult-aged essential workers who had continued community exposure (32, 33).

407

The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and relative risk of being

408

seropositive among older persons (≥65 years) was also low, which may be

409

explained by poorer serologic responses after infection (34), lower rates of

410

infection as a result of biological differences or, perhaps more likely, due to

411

behavior changes leading to reduced frequency of infectious contacts.

412
413

High heterogeneity was observed for all study populations. Although meta

414

regression could partly explain such varied seroprevalence between different

415

study populations with different type of exposures, the internal heterogeneity for

416

the same population should be interpreted carefully. The seroprevalence of the

417

general population is likely a reflection of the duration and intensity of

418

community transmissions. We showed using a regression analysis that higher

419

cumulative incidence of reported cases is associated with higher seroprevalence.

420

For locations where data on the number of confirmed cases were available, we

421

found that the number of infections per confirmed case varied (2.0-23.1) but the

422

order of magnitude was quite consistent across locales. Such evidence indicates

423

the existence of a large number of undetected cases in the community and

424

provides a range of scaling factors for translating the observed confirmed cases

425

into unobserved infections in the community.

426
427

Our study has several limitations. First, although we have performed

428

meta-regression and subgroup analysis to explore heterogeneity of varied

429

seroprevalence for different populations, there are still some factors that we have

430

not taken into account, so that some heterogeneity cannot be well explained

431

quantitatively. Second, misclassification bias may occur due to the limited

432

information on exposures for the study populations, especially for the

433

“Poorly-defined” populations. For some key information (e.g., the use of PPE for

434

healthcare workers) that cannot be extracted from the original articles, we have

435

tried to contact the authors, but the response rate was low. Third, our findings

436

involving cumulative incidence of confirmed cases are limited by the inherently

437

heterogeneous incidence across locations, due to the diversity of testing strategy,

438

case tracing and identification, and public health interventions. Fourth, only raw

439

data without correcting for assay performance or sampling design were used in

440

the analysis to ensure comparability within studies. Fifth, the seroprevalence of

441

IgG was possibly overestimated due to the inability to isolate IgG-based

442

seroprevalence from total antibodies-based seroprevalence in some studies.

443

Lastly, our infection-to-case estimates did not account for age-specific differences

444

in exposure risk and symptom severity.

446

In conclusion, the overall quality of the existing seroprevalence studies of

447

SARS-CoV-2 is low and international efforts to standardize study design and

448

assays are urgently needed (14). Pooled estimates of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence

449

based on currently available data demonstrate a higher infection risk among

450

close contacts and healthcare workers lacking PPE, while the relatively low

451

prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies among general populations

452

suggests that the majority of examined populations have not been infected.

453

Therefore, antibody-mediated herd immunity is likely far from being reached in

454

most settings, and continuous serological monitoring is necessary to inform

455

public health decision making.
