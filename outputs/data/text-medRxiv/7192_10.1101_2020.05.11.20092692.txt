Abstract—50 words

Coronavirus disease 2019 has led to more than three million cases globally. Since
the first family cluster of COVID-19 cases identified in Shenzhen in early January,
most of the local transmission occurred within household contacts. Identifying the
factors associated with household transmission is of great importance to guide
preventive measures.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was
first identified in Wuhan in December 2019. As of Apr 29, 2020, it has led to more than
three million confirmed cases globally (1). China was able to bring its first wave of
infections under control through the use of social distancing and a rapid expansion in
laboratory testing capacity (2). More than one billion people were confined to their
homes across China, including about 13 million people in the rapidly developing city of
Shenzhen in southern China. Since the first family cluster of COVID-19 cases
identified in Shenzhen in early January 2020, most of the local transmission occurred
within household contacts (3), similar to the situation elsewhere in China (4). We
analyzed the dynamics of household transmission in Shenzhen to identify the risk
factors for transmission and the effectiveness of preventive measures.

The Study
From Jan 1 to Feb 14, 2020 we identified 23 households in which there were a
total of 139 individuals, including 60 confirmed COVID-19 cases and their 79
household contacts. Informed consent was waived as data collection was part of the
continuing public health investigation of an emerging outbreak. This study was
approved by the ethics committees of Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and
Prevention. The mean age of the index cases was 33.9 years old (range 2 to 67), with
35(58.3%) of them were female. In total, these index cases caused 21 secondary cases
from 12/23 (52%) households. Many households had 2-3 index cases as some of the

family members had co-exposure outside the household. Among these 12 households, 4
households had 3 secondary cases, 1 household had two secondary cases, and 7
households had one secondary case. Within the 23 households with children, the
secondary infection risk was 21/79 (26.6%) in Shenzhen.

We compared characteristics of contacts who became infected with those who did
not (Table). No significant difference of age and sex was found between the secondary
cases and non-cases. The secondary cases were more commonly to be immediate
family (such as spouses, parents, siblings, and children) than non-cases (66.7% vs
37.9%, P<0.05). This could be associated with more intense contact than the extended
family members. Most of the secondary cases lived together with the index cases, while
only half for the non-cases (71.4% vs 51.7%, P<0.05) did so, and there was no
secondary case among those not living with the index cases. Our findings are consistent
with previous studies suggesting that closed environments with prolonged close contact
may facilitate secondary transmission (5), and the transmission rate of infectious
diseases within households was much greater than between individuals not living
together (6). Thus, reducing close contact, keep contact distance including separated
living environment within household, early quarantine of exposed household contacts
and medical isolation of the ill people may be needed to reduce the onward
transmission in household.

Interestingly, we found all secondary cases had contact with index cases during the
period after symptom onset in the index cases, while just 67.2% of the non-cases had
contact with them (P<0.05). Furthermore, the median duration of contact with

post-illness-onset index cases was significantly longer among the secondary cases than
non-cases (4.0 days, IQR: 2.0-5.0 vs 2.0, IQR: 0-4.0, P<0.05), although no significant
difference was found for the median duration of contact with before-illness-onset index
cases between the secondary cases and non-cases (2.0 days, IQR: 1.0-9.0 vs 5.0, IQR:
2.0-12.0, P=0.223) (Figure). This finding implied that the timing and duration of
contact with the index cases was associated with the risk of secondary infection among
household contacts. Recent studies also found the infectiousness was highest around
the first day of illness onset and may even occur 1-2 days before illness onset (7, 8).
Thus, early identification of the cases and diminishing the duration of contact,
especially after the illness onset of the index cases, would be helpful to decrease the
household transmission risk.

With recorded data on use of face mask among 11 households, we found that the
secondary cases were much less likely to report wearing a mask at home compared to
the non-cases (23.5% vs 75.0% , P<0.05). Our results support the recommendation that
symptomatic individuals should use face mask as well as those who are caring for
somebody with symptoms (9).

Unfortunately, we do not have information on other preventive measures, such as
hand hygiene or household disinfection, which also could play a role in reducing
household transmission. More studies are needed to evaluate the role of these factors in
household transmission.

Identifying risk and preventive factors for household transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 is of great importance to guide preventive measures for onward
transmission. The findings of this study suggested immediate family relationship,
living together, and contact with index cases who had illness onset was associated
higher odds of household transmission, while wearing face mask at home may be
effective in reducing the risk of household transmission. A combination of different
measures including active case-finding, medical isolation of confirmed and suspected
cases, quarantine of close contacts and personal preventive measures such as wearing
face mask were efficacious in the containment of household transmission in Shenzhen,
China.
