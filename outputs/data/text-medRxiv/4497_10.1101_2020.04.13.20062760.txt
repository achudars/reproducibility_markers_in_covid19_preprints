Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number has become an essential parameter for monitoring
disease transmission across settings and guiding interventions. The UK published weekly
estimates of the reproduction number in the UK starting in May 2020 which are formed from
multiple independent estimates. In this paper, we describe methods used to estimate the timevarying SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number for the UK. We used multiple data sources and
estimated a serial interval distribution from published studies. We describe regional variability
and how estimates evolved during the early phases of the outbreak, until the relaxing of social
distancing measures began to be introduced in early July. Our analysis is able to guide localised
control and provides a longitudinal example of applying these methods over long timescales.

Introduction
In late 2019 an outbreak of a novel infectious disease was detected. It manifested principally with severe
acute respiratory distress, and pneumonia, [1] although many cases followed a mild course [2]. The pathogen
was rapidly identified as a new species of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,
SARS-CoV-2), and the disease named COVID-19 [3]. Global transmission of the virus followed and major
outbreaks have been observed in Europe, beginning with Italy [4]. On the 31st Jan 2020 the first cases were
identified in the UK [5]. This was initially managed using testing of suspected individuals in the community,
contact tracing and isolation of affected cases. However this was successful only in delaying the spread of the
disease and on 13th March 2020 the UK government moved towards a mitigation strategy reserving testing
for hospital inpatients only [6]. Following this, a step wise implementation of social distancing measures
were mandated by the government including voluntary self isolation of any symptoms & vulnerable people
[7], a ban on non essential travel worldwide [8] and school closures [9]. Finally on 23rd March 2020 the
government mandated that everyone apart from essential workers should stay at home and away from others
[10], instituting a countrywide “lock-down”.
Epidemiological studies conducted during the outbreak in China have provided us with a number of estimates
of the parameters describing the virus’s spread through the population including a reproduction number
between 2.24 and 3.58 [11] and a median incubation period of 5.1 days (credible interval 4.5 to 5.8) [12]. It
is estimated that fewer than 2.5% of people will show signs before 2.2 days and 97.5% of people who will
develop symptoms will have done so by 11.2 days after exposure [12].
We investigated the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK to determine whether there are any
spatial or temporal patterns beyond those resulting from the imposition of social distancing measures, and to
track the progression of the outbreak. This article summarizes the methodology and interpretation of national
and regional estimates of the time varying reproduction number (Rt ) of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the
United Kingdom. These estimates were provided to the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling
(SPI-M) [13] and formed part of the weekly UK Rt estimates [14].

Methods
This section describes the data sources, their processing and combination and our methodology for estimating
the serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and calculation of Rt estimates.

Data
We integrate data from a variety of sources, both publicly available and provided to the Scientific Pandemic
Influenza Group - Modelling (SPI-M) [13] by Public Health England (PHE) and the Defence Science and
Technology Laboratory (DSTL) [15]. We use these data to estimate Rt and the exponential growth rate
for the UK as a whole, for the four nations of the UK (CTRY), and for the seven NHS regions in England
(NHSER).
At the UK level, data are available on cases and deaths through the PHE coronavirus tracker [16]. The
tracker publishes an overall number of cases and deaths in the UK on a daily basis. It also provides a regional
breakdown of the 4 nations, which exclude tests performed in private laboratories (Pillar 2 tests). At the
time of this analysis, historical time series of the UK level data was not made available though the PHE site,
however this information was collected prospectively and curated by Tom White’s aggregated COVID 19 UK
data github site [17]. Cumulative case counts from both the PHE headline UK figure and the combined sum
of the 4 nations are compared as these numbers differ.
Hospital admission data are available from NHS trusts across the UK via the DSTL, which in turn aggregate
the situation reports (SitReps) provided by NHS hospital trusts. These are aggregated to UK level. Although
referred to here as “hospital admission” it includes admissions of patients who are subsequently identified as

COVID-19 cases in hospital, but identified in hospital, and patients with known COVID-19 who are then
admitted to hospital.
For the four devolved nations of the UK we used different data sources for each nation. In England we
used data from the SPI-M provided line lists for cases and deaths in England. Cases are restricted to those
processed in NHS labs (Pillar 1), and are available by date of specimen collection. For the other three nation
states of the UK, as above, both historical cases and death data are aggregated from Public Health Wales [18]
and Scotland’s [19] sites, and from Northern Ireland’s HSC site [20] respectively, using a time series retrieved
from Tom White’s aggregated COVID 19 UK data github site [17] for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Death data from the 4 nations are provided via the CHESS data set [21]. Death data are subject to a weekly
periodicity due to reporting delay over the weekend which is mitigated by using date of death rather than
date of report.
At the level of the NHS England regions, we take the case data from anonymised test result line listings.
Mortality data for NHS England is provided by PHE in a canonical line list of deaths, and is used alongside
the CHESS data set[21]. Admissions data is available from DSTL feeds, and ICU admissions from CHESS
data set[21].
For England as a nation and for the NHS England regions we also have data available from triage telephone
calls from NHS 111 and 999 services. The data on the calls made to 111 & 999 as well as the outcome of that
call are provided as aggregate numbers broken down by age.
For all data sources cumulative case figures are converted into daily incidence figures, and any data which is
broken down by age, or by gender, are combined. In case and death data, the final 5 days of the time series
are discarded to account for possible reporting delay. The resulting time series are analysed for outlying data
points, which are more than 5 standard deviations away from the mean of the nearest 14 data points. Outlying
or missing data are imputed from a linear interpolation of the logarithm of incidence figures, implemented
in the R ‘forecast’ library [22], and the results are truncated to ensure no negative incidence figures. A
smoothing function (a linear spline interpolation) is then fitted to the logarithm of incidence applied over a 7
day window [23]. This is needed as all the data sources have some degree of weekly periodicity regardless of
source.

Combination of data sources
Our estimates are based on an aggregation of the various data sources described above. We generate four
estimates of Rt based on single time series from each data stream:
a)
b)
c)
d)

deaths (EpiEstim/Deaths),
cases (EpiEstim/4NationsCases),
telephone triage (EpiEstim/Triage),
hospital admissions.

The aggregation procedure is kept simple and combines multiple data sources when applicable using the
mean. Any possible biases this introduces are consistent throughout the time series so that it does not affect
relative changes and hence either estimates of Rt or growth rates. The resulting time series are manually
inspected for consistency and to check there are not abrupt changes in the data streams. The source of the
combined data sets and more information about the processing steps used is shown in Supplemental table 1.

The serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 infections, Rt , and time delay of estimates
The serial interval and the generation interval are closely related measures. The generation interval is a
measure of the time taken for an infection to pass from one person (infector) to another (infectee) in a chain
of transmission. The serial interval, on the other hand, is a measure of the time between the appearance
of clinical symptoms in the infector and infectee. The generation interval cannot be observed directly as
both infection events are only detectable once the virus has incubated and become symptomatic. The serial

interval is often used as an observable proxy for the generation interval. The use of the serial interval as a
proxy for the generation interval is known to produce biased estimates for the reproduction number [24,25],
but has the advantage of being directly observed through contact tracing.
Assumptions about the serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 have an impact on the absolute level of our estimates
of Rt . We have used multiple approaches to estimate the serial interval. Firs, a UK specific serial interval
was calculated from early case tracking data (the FF100 case data provided by DSTL). Second, a literature
review was conducted and the serial intervals from a range of sources [4,26–35] pooled [36]. The serial interval
can be well described by a truncated empirical distribution, with a mean plus 95% credible interval of 5.59
days (5.09; 6.20), and a standard deviation of 4.15 days (3.94; 4.46). This uncertainty in the serial interval
distribution is propagated to our estimates of Rt and used to determine confidence intervals. In other work
we have analysed the effect of the pragmatic use of serial interval instead of generation interval and find the
effect on estimates of Rt to be small (~5% of the absolute value) when it is close to one. This choice does not
influence the estimate of time when Rt transitions from growth to decay [36].
Using the inferred serial interval distribution, we analysed the time series data using forward equation method
[37], implemented in the EpiEstim R library [37–39], to estimate the time varying reproduction numbers
during the outbreak.
The renewal equation method is predicated on a time series of infections, and on the infectivity profile - a
measure of the probability that a secondary infection occurred on a specific day after the primary case, given a
secondary infection occurred [37]. A Bayesian framework is then used to update a prior probabilistic estimate
of Rt on any given day with both information gained from the time series of infections in the epidemic to
date and the infectivity profile to produce a posterior estimate. In both the original [38] and revised [39]
implementations of this method, the authors acknowledge the pragmatic use of the serial interval distribution,
as a proxy measure for the infectivity profile, and the incidence of symptom onset or case identification as a
proxy for the incidence of infection, with the caveat that these introduce a time lag into the estimates of Rt .
We make the simplifying assumption that there is negligible mixing of populations between each geographical
area and treat each location independently.
The method uses a sliding time window during which the instantaneous reproduction number is assumed
to be constant. We used both a 7 day and a 28 day sliding window for calculations of the time varying
reproduction number which provides two estimates with alternative trade offs between noise and loss of detail.
Our Rt estimate is calculated using a loosely informed prior estimate of Rt as a gamma distribution with
mean of 1 and standard deviation 2. This prior distribution is based on an assumption of the approximate
value of Rt on the conditions following lock-down, rather than reflecting values of R0 commonly described in
the literature [11] as those are based on the situation without social distancing measures in place.
Other events in the timeline of an infection also serve as a proxy for observations of infections in the past
including positive testing, hospitalization for severe disease, or death. Although best practice is to calculate Rt
using a generation interval distribution and infection events [25], neither the generation interval distribution
nor the infection event data can be directly observed, and inferring them can also introduce potential bias and
uncertainty. As a pragmatic initial step, we use the serial interval distribution described above in lieu of the
generation interval, and the various observations available to us, including triage contacts, cases, admissions
and deaths as a proxy of prior transmission events, and compare those results.
There is a time delay between infection, symptom onset, case identification, hospital admission and ultimately
death, and this affects the timing of our estimation of Rt . In a separate analysis we estimated these time
delays (shown in Supplemental table 2) and apply these estimates as a correction to the time of our estimates
of Rt to align them to the date of presumed infection.
Code and processed data involved in this analysis are available on GitHub [40].

Results
UK Overview
Our estimate of the median value of Rt based for the United Kingdom based on cases, deaths and hospital
admissions from the 4th July 2020 is presented in Table 1.
Table 1: Estimates of the value of Rt in the UK on 4th July 2020

In Figure 1A, we show the incidence per million people of cases, deaths, and hospital admissions due to
COVID-19 in the UK over the outbreak. Panel B shows the associated values for Rt . The 3 data sources
show similar patterns of exponential increase, with admissions and deaths lagging cases followed by a slower
phase of exponential decline, beginning 2-3 weeks after the lock-down. In Figure 1B we see the estimates of
Rt corrected to date of infection. There is a prominent single initial peak in Rt from admissions and deaths in
late February, followed by a decline over the course of the next few months. Rt crosses 1 at the beginning of
April, after which it remains below 1 during the lock-down period. Estimates based on cases show a biphasic
pattern with an initial peak in mid February and a second smaller peak in early March, follow the same
pattern as other estimates. The peak values of Rt vary by observation with peak Rt by admissions being
8.3, by cases 4.8 and by deaths 3.3. These are within the confidence limits of estimates described in other
countries [11].

Countries in the UK
Estimates of Rt in the different countries of the UK, based on cases, deaths, hospital admissions or triage calls
for the 4th July 2020 are presented in Table 2 and Figure 2. Triage figures based on 111 & 999 coronavirus
pathway calls were available for England only; we do not have access to the full time series of all information
for all countries. We show estimates based on a 28 day rolling window as cases and deaths in Northern
Ireland, and Scotland, have fallen to a level which makes estimates over a shorter window unreliable. With
insufficient information the Bayesian method used reverts to the prior value of R0 supplied which we set
to 1. These estimates show the median value of Rt is below 1 for all four nations, using all data sources.
The pattern in all nations is similar with Rt rapidly decreasing following lock-down on the 23rd March and
becoming less than one in early April. Northern Ireland and Scotland have maintained a lower Rt for a longer
period of time than England and Wales, with Rt values in Northern Ireland and Scotland at or below 0.75 for
much of May, June and July compared to those in England and Wales which have been between 0.75 and 1
for the same period.

Rt by England NHS region
In Figure 3 (and, for completeness, Supplemental table 3) we present the same results as above but with a
focus on the NHS regions in England. On the 4th July 2020 the estimates of the mean of Rt were largely
below 1 in the individual NHS regions. The observed count of different observations demonstrates a clear
regional difference between London and the South West and the rest of the country with lower rates of
all indicators than other regions. The time series of regional estimates of Rt reflect the overall patterns of
England, albeit with more volatility due to the different windowing size between Figure 2 and Figure 3. It is
however possible to see higher levels of uncertainty in the South West reflecting the smaller case numbers
and to a lesser extent the same in London.

based on cases, deaths and hospital admissions, and a 7 day rolling window.

Rt differences from England baseline
In Figure 4 we plot the absolute difference of Rt in the seven NHS England administrative regions, from
the Rt of England overall, as a baseline for each data source. This is based on 28 day window estimates
due to the volatility observed in Figure 3. This analysis highlights the regional differences in Rt over time.
Over the period of the lock-down, the East of England, Midlands and South East regions approximately
tracked the England baseline. The South West was seen to initially following the national average but
from June demonstrates a trend towards a lower value, although our confidence in these estimates is low.
When lock-down started, London was initially well below the England average, by most indicators, and this
continued until some point in late May, after which the trend reversed. On the other hand the North West,
and less so North East & Yorkshire were consistently above the rest of the country until late May when they
eventually reached the England average, and since mid June the Rt estimates in the North West have been

lower than this average. The impact this variation has had on case loads is seen in Table 3 which shows the
pre and post lock-down rates of newly identified cases in each NHS region.

Discussion
In this paper, we estimated the reproduction number, Rt , for COVID-19 in the UK using multiple data
sources over a range of geographies and time points, and the same methodology. We find that, after the
initial peak, different data sources produce similar results, without evidence of systematic bias for estimates
based on more immediate measures (cases), compared to those based on longer term measures (deaths). In
the UK, Rt peaked in mid February 2020, coinciding with the end of the school holidays. We find that using
different data sources affects the estimated size of peak burden although with considerable uncertainty.
We find that Rt declined rapidly following lock-down on the 23rd March but did not reach the critical
threshold (Rt less than one) separating growth and decline until early April. This delay is likely to be the

combination of ongoing transmission within households, care homes and hospitals, or outbreaks in factories
in key industries such as food production. Other factors that may influence the timing are delays in case
identification and reporting and limitations in the estimation methods. Subsequent to mid-April we estimate
Rt largely remained below one until the end of the lock-down period.
The multiple data sources we considered each have their advantages and drawbacks. Counts of test-positive
cases and telephone triage calls provide a rapid indication of infection risk and capture a broad representation
of age groups, but may be influenced by changes in behaviour and testing policy. In the UK, initial attempts
at community tracing were abandoned when case numbers started to outstrip test availability and afterwards
testing was only performed on hospital admissions for suspected COVID-19 [6]. Later, test capacity was
increased and the policy reversed to include more community cases, again altering the nature of the population
being tested. Although a regional breakdown of testing capacity was not available at the time of this analysis,
we do know that capacity was exceeded in the early phase of the epidemic, and this is one reason why case
based Rt estimates must be interpreted with caution until the middle of April. Hospital admissions and death
data are less subject to changes in sampling strategy, although are subject to reporting delays and biases in
ascertainment. As COVID-19 mortality is overwhelmingly in the elderly, statistics based on deaths mainly
represent older groups. Due to reduced contact in the elderly we propose the outbreak took longer to become
established in those age groups. Counts of admissions may be unreliable when there is delay in identifying a
COVID-19 case, or when there is significant hospital transmission, as was the case in the early outbreak.
We took a pragmatic approach for sub-national analyses, based on data availability. In early April 2020,
immediately following lock-down, estimates of Rt were lowest in London and highest in the North West and
North East of England. At this time, the burden of cases was highest in London at nearly 50 cases per million
people per day, but this reduced 25 fold over the lock-down period. In early July 2020, at the relaxation
of lock-down, the case rates per capita were lowest in the South West, due to the smaller initial outbreak
size, followed by London due to the larger impact of social distancing. However the benefit of lower case
rates in London were offset by relative increases in Rt . When case numbers are low Rt ceases to be a uniform
statistic over a geographical area, because significant town to town variation will exist as clusters of infection
become apparent. This was seen in South West of England towards the end of the lock-down where increasing
variability in regional estimates of Rt became less obviously significant. This reinforces the point that Rt is a
relative measure and should not be interpreted without information about the incidence rate.
Our approach has a number of limitations. Our method treats the whole system and each region as independent
and isolated. In reality, regions are connected via travel, although this was reduced during early social
distancing measures in March and April. Furthermore, in the early phases, importation rates were high [41],
and this would lead to our approach overestimating the true Rt .

Conclusion
We present a description of the methodology and data sources used in providing estimates of Rt in the UK
for SPI-M [14]. Our approach is pragmatic and designed to produce timely, useful information to policy
makers. Despite this, we find that using a number of data sources and careful interpretation helps elucidate
the regional differences in Rt and shows they existed from the outset of lock-down and persisted during
lock-down. Due to compound nature of Rt the result of this variation is higher case loads in Northern regions
in the UK exiting lock-down.
As we move forward early detection and prevention of spread of emerging clusters SARS-CoV-2 infections is
critical to prevent large scale outbreaks. This will be challenging as the long incubation period and high
rate of asymptomatic individuals makes undetected rapid spread easy. Prediction at a more localised level is
needed to focus both community testing and more targeted social interventions on high risk areas in the
future.
Critical to this work continues to be rapid access to information about the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the
community both with high spatial resolution, but also with a short time lag from infection to observation.
As test and trace activities ramp up we expect to see similar biases in case related data as testing volumes

change locally in response to outbreaks. Our existing approaches to estimating Rt principally use hospital
based metrics and as such may not provide the perspective on the outbreak that is needed in the future.
Telephone triage data is one potential source of information about local outbreaks, and an area for future
investigation [42].
