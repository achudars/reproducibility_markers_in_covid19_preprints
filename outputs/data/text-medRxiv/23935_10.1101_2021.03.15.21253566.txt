Understanding Convergence Between Non-Hispanic Black and
White COVID-19 Mortality: A County-Level Approach
Ralph Lawton1, Kevin Zheng2, Daniel Zheng3, Erich Huang2

Background: Non-Hispanic Black populations have suffered greater per capita COVID-19 mortality at
more than 1.5 times that of White populations. Previous work has established that, over time, rates of
Black and White mortality have converged; however, some studies suggest that regional shifts in COVID19 prevalence may play a role in the relative change between racial groups. This study’s objective was to
investigate changes in Black and White COVID-19 mortality over time and uncover potential
mechanisms driving these changes.
Methods and Findings: Using county-level COVID-19 mortality data stratified by race, we investigate
the trajectory of non-Hispanic Black mortality, White mortality, and the Black/White per capita mortality
ratio from June 2020–January 2021. Over this period, in the counties studied, cumulative mortality rose
by 56.7% and 82.8% for Black and White populations respectively, resulting in a decrease in mortality
ratio of 0.369 (23.8%). These trends persisted even when a county-level fixed-effects model was used to
estimate changes over time within counties (controlling for all time-invariant county level characteristics
and removing the effects of changes in regional distribution of COVID-19). Next, we leverage countylevel variation over time in COVID-19 prevalence to show that the decline in the Black/White mortality
ratio can be explained by changes in COVID-19 prevalence. Finally, we study heterogeneity in the time
trend, finding that convergence occurs most significantly in younger populations, areas with less dense
populations, and outside of the Northeast. Limitations include suppressed data in counties with fewer than
10 deaths in a racial category, and the use of provisional COVID-19 death data that may be incomplete.
Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that convergence in Black/White mortality is not driven by
county-level characteristics or changes in the regional dispersion of COVID-19, but instead by changes
within counties. Further, declines in the Black/White mortality ratio appear strongly linked to changes in
COVID-19 prevalence, rather than a time-specific effect. Further studies on changes in exposure by race
over time, or on the vulnerability of individuals who died at different points in the pandemic, may provide
crucial insight on mechanisms and strategies to further reduce COVID-19 mortality disparities.

1. Introduction:
From the early phases of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic,
numerous studies have documented disproportionately high numbers of COVID-19-attributed
deaths in non-Hispanic Black populations, from here on referred to as Black, relative to those in
non-Hispanic White populations, from here on referred to as White, in the US (Adhikari et al.,
2020; Kirby, 2020; Laurencin & McClinton, 2020). Accordingly, racial disparities have
remained a core part of national discussion. As of January 24th, 2021, the national per capita
COVID-19 mortality for Black Americans is 1.47 times that of White Americans (Stokes et al.,
2021). However, cross-sectional studies over different intervals during the pandemic suggest that
there has been a recent convergence between White and Black mortality (Bassett et al., 2020;
Gross et al., 2020; Webb Hooper et al., 2020). Estimates from April, May, and July 2020
document cumulative Black/White COVID-19 mortality ratios of 3.57, 2.37, and 1.97,
respectively.
Although it is now well established that various socioeconomic and environmental
factors are linked to racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, little work has yet been done in
understanding the potential mechanisms for the observed convergence over time. Recent reports
by Kumar et al. and Gold et al., two of the only longitudinal studies on COVID-19 mortality by
race, investigated shifts in racial, ethnic, and geographic mortality from June to December 2020
and May to August 2020, respectively. Both papers documented relative declines in COVID-19
mortality among Black persons over this time frame, and Gold et al. found a shift in COVID-19
mortality from the Northeast and toward the South and West U.S. Census regions (Gold et al.,
2020; Kumar et al., 2021). National press reporting, as well as these studies, attributed changes
in racial mortality disparities in large part to the evolving geography of COVID-19 prevalence,

due to regional differences in demographics (Zhou & Belluz, 2021). This theory suggests that, as
COVID-19 prevalence shifted primarily from regions with proportionately larger Black
populations to regions with proportionately smaller ones, national statistics may have recorded
comparatively less Black mortality. However, while the West’s Black population is smaller than
the Northeast’s as a percentage, the South’s is substantially larger, so it remains unclear whether
regional changes in COVID-19 prevalence actually had a significant effect on racial mortality
disparities. Other potential mechanisms that may explain the observed changes in racial mortality
disparities include changes in exposure by race, ‘front-loading’ of mortality among more
vulnerable population groups, or a variety of other potential factors. Research to further elucidate
what mechanisms are significant is essential to fully understand COVID-19-related racial
disparities and the myriad ways disease can disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.
These trends further highlight health disparities between Black and White people in the
US. Generally, Black Americans have shorter lifespans relative to White Americans.
The gap in life expectancy between Blacks and Whites is 3.6 years, but is projected to widen by
40% to more than 5 years due to the coronavirus pandemic (Andrasfay & Goldman, 2021). Black
Americans also live a greater portion of their lives managing chronic conditions and disability
due to differences in lifetime exposure to racism, stressors, and structural discrimination, all
factors contributing to higher COVID-19 mortality rates among Black Americans (Lee &
Hicken, 2016; Mays et al., 2007; Mitchell et al., 2021; Price-Haywood et al., 2020; Williams &
Mohammed, 2009). Cross-sectional studies have also linked racial disparities in COVID-19
mortality to a variety of community-level factors including population density and urbanization.
Black Americans often live in dense urban environments that can increase exposure to COVID19 (Adhikari et al., 2020; Kirby, 2020; Stokes et al., 2021). Other studies have tied COVID-19

racial disparities to differences in access to care, economic status, chronic comorbidities, and
“essential worker” categorization (Cheng et al., 2020; Paul et al., 2020; Wright et al., 2020).
These studies primarily correlate the racial make-up of the population to total COVID-19
mortality, rather than disaggregated mortality data by race. Nonetheless, these findings suggest
that disparities in COVID-19 mortality primarily reflect disproportionate COVID-19 prevalence
in Black communities (Zelner et al., 2020).
While these cross-sectional studies have expanded our understanding of changing
COVID-19 racial disparities, information about how racial, ethnic, geographic, and
socioeconomic disparities have changed with regard to the observed convergence remains
limited (Haleem et al., 2020). Previously identified factors such as population density, chronic
comorbidities, and residential segregation have not changed significantly over the period of
interest and are thus unlikely to have served as primary drivers for these observed changes in
COVID-19 mortality between racial groups.
In this work, we use a county-level approach to further understand changes in COVID-19
mortality in Black and White populations over time. Using county-level data presents several key
advantages, including the ability to investigate whether national trends are driven by changes
within or between smaller areas. Furthermore, utilizing county-level variation in COVID-19
prevalence over time as well as county-level socioeconomic and population information enables
us to address specific questions that are intractable at larger geographic areas.
We begin by examining county-level mortality in Black and White populations over time,
documenting recent changes in mortality by race (including the extent to which observable
control variables explain trends). Second, we use a county-level fixed-effects method to evaluate

county-level changes in COVID-19 mortality by race. A variety of factors can make estimates of
COVID-19 mortality time-trends difficult to interpret: notably, the changing geography of
COVID-19 prevalence, the spread of COVID-19 to places with different demography, and
different structural risk factors like population density, population-level chronic comorbidity
rates, or housing supply, can complicate interpretation. Crucially, the fixed-effects approach
enables us to estimate changes in these burdens within counties, such that our estimates are
driven only by changes in COVID-19 mortality within small geographic areas. This approach
allows us to control for all county-level characteristics, including many previously discussed
structural risk factors, that can be considered fixed over this timeframe. Comparing fixed-effects
estimates with traditional ordinary least squares estimates provide insight into the mechanisms
that may underpin convergence. Third, we leverage county-level variation in COVID-19
prevalence to evaluate the extent to which time trends in disparities and mortality are attributed
to changes in prevalence rather than a time effect. Finally, we investigate heterogeneity in these
trends by region and county characteristics.
Understanding how disparities change throughout a pandemic is essential to
understanding the differential burdens of a disease in real time. Our approach, which uses
county-level fixed effects, develops a framework for investigating the origins of disparities in
COVID-19 outcomes and provides insight into the potential mechanisms involved.

2. Methods and Data:
2.1 Sample and Data
National and state COVID-19 mortality data were drawn from weekly provisional death
counts reported to the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) from May 6, 2020–January 27,
2021 (Technical Notes, 2020). National and state-level mortality data were utilized to generate
visualizations of changing COVID-19 mortality by race and by state. County-level data was
available from June 24, 2020–January 27, 2021. We restrict our analysis to the month of January
as deaths after this period likely reflect exposures after substantial vaccination had occurred,
potentially contaminating our estimates. COVID-19 deaths are identified using the International
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) code U07.1, where
COVID-19 is an underlying or contributing cause of death. COVID-19 was the underlying cause
for approximately 92% of deaths associated with COVID-19 (COVID-19 Hospitalization and
Death by Race/Ethnicity, 2020). Provisional death counts are incomplete, and likely undercount
true COVID-19 mortality. Calculations in October 2020 suggest that 94% of provisional death
counts by age and race were complete as of that date (Andrasfay & Goldman, 2021). According
to the NVSS, less than 0.7% of all recorded COVID-19 deaths are missing racial data (Technical
Notes, 2020). To maintain patient confidentiality, counties with fewer than 10 deaths within a
given racial group are suppressed by the NVSS. This represents a key limitation of the NVSS
data. Suppression of data in counties with low numbers of total COVID-19 deaths means that our
sample is not a random sample of American counties, though we do use some statistical methods
to limit the effects of selection. Of the 579 counties represented in our dataset, 388 counties have
mortality data for both non-Hispanic Black and White persons. These 388 counties represent

8,477 county-time observations and comprise our analytical sample. The counties in the
analytical sample represent approximately 209 million Americans.
County-level demographic and population information are drawn from the 2018 5-year
wave of the American Community Surveys (ACS). Combining county-level ACS and NVSS
data, we construct our core outcomes. First, we generate per-capita estimates of COVID-19
mortality by race and ethnicity, dividing COVID-19-attributed deaths by total population within
each racial group. For simplicity, we use COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 individuals, rather than
the strict ratio of COVID-19 deaths to population. Our primary outcome is the natural logarithm
of per capita COVID-19 mortality, as per capita mortality is non-normally distributed. Using the
natural logarithm has the added advantage that coefficients over time can be interpreted as
percent rates of change. To assess disparities, we construct ratios of COVID-19 mortality in
Black populations divided by per capita COVID-19 mortality in White populations, building a
metric for disparities between populations independent of total COVID-19 mortality.
Covariates for county-level household median income, age structure, population density,
and occupation were drawn from the ACS data, and supplementary county-level data on
COVID-19 testing was drawn from USAfacts.org, a standardized source for US government
data.
2.2 Statistical Analysis
Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is initially used to estimate time trends and
differences between groups. We then use a county-level fixed effects model to estimate time
trends and differences between groups within counties. Using this method, we are able to
estimate the extent to which temporal changes in COVID-19 mortality and racial disparities are

due to changes within compact geographic areas, rather than changes between regions and states
with heterogeneous demography. The county fixed-effects method has the added benefit that
results can be interpreted as conditional on all time-invariant county characteristics. In addition
to location, factors such as county demography, population structure, racial and ethnic makeup,
health infrastructure, and housing supply and quality can all be treated as fixed during this
interval. Thus, the fixed-effects approach is crucial to generating interpretable estimates of the
time-trend, especially as the changing geography of COVID-19 infection includes areas of
differing demographic characteristics and structural factors, which can complicate estimates.
Comparison between the fixed-effects estimates and OLS estimates may also shed insight into
the extent to which these fixed characteristics may be related to the mechanisms involved.
In order to assess time effects in a semi-parametric fashion, indicator variables for each
month are used as regression covariates. These models are extended to include covariates for the
natural log of total mortality and three-week lagged positive COVID-19 tests, respectively, to
identify the role of time trends versus changes in COVID-19 prevalence. Since COVID-19
prevalence is difficult to fully estimate, we use two different proxies for COVID-19 prevalence
(total mortality and lagged testing) in order to check the robustness of different estimates.
Finally, heterogeneity analyses for different time trends are conducted by generating interaction
terms between the time indicators and covariates for regions, percentage of the population older
than 85 years, and population density. Continuous regression covariates are de-meaned, so that
regression intercepts can be interpreted for the mean county. In order to further investigate the
role of age, state-level data are used to build parallel models by age and race. All standard errors
reported are robust to heteroscedasticity. Analyses were conducted in Stata version 14.2.

3.1 Sample Characteristics
The characteristics of counties included in the analytical sample are summarized in Table
1. The mean county in this sample is 49% male, 18% Black, 71% White, and has a population of
approximately 539,000. As of January 27th, the observed counties experienced an average of
150.4 COVID-19-related deaths per 100,000 individuals. These data represent nearly two-thirds
of the American population.

3.2 National Trends in COVID-19 Mortality by Race
While Black populations have cumulatively suffered far greater per capita mortality than
White populations, in recent months the cumulative ratio of deaths in Black populations versus
White populations has declined significantly, driven by a convergence in mortality between these
groups (Fig. 1a). Since November, weekly per capita mortality in White populations has
surpassed that of Black populations (Fig. 1b). Although COVID-19 mortality in Black persons
was mostly consistent from October to November, COVID-19 mortality in White persons grew
significantly, and by January reached an all-time high. These results parallel similar convergence
in COVID-19 prevalence by race (Appendix Fig. 1a-b).
Fig. 1c-f maps the ratio of COVID-19 mortality in Black versus White populations per
capita by state in May, June, October, and January. Racial differences in COVID-19 mortality
varied substantially across states in May. For instance, COVID-19 mortality was more than six
times greater in the Black population relative to the White population in Wisconsin, and
approximately three times greater in Kansas, Missouri, Michigan, and Illinois. However,
COVID-19 mortality for Black and White populations was similar in Oregon, Washington, and
Arizona. Nationally, the ratio of COVID-19 mortality between Black and White populations has
declined over time. By January, the mortality ratio in nearly all states was less than three.

3.3 County-level Results
Table 2 provides information about the magnitude and direction of county-level COVID19 mortality trends for Black persons [Column 1-2] (natural-log outcomes interpreted as percent
change), White persons [Column 3-4], as well as the mortality ratio of the Black to White
population from June 2020 to January 2021 [Column 5-6]. For each outcome, the left column
presents the coefficients for time (months) from the regression model without control variables,
and the right column presents the regression coefficients for time controlling for county-level
characteristics.
Both White and Black populations have experienced a substantial increase in countylevel total mortality over time. In June, the mortality for Black persons was greater than that for
White persons; however, the increase in mortality has been much greater among White persons
compared with Black persons from September onward. Relative to June, COVID-19 mortality
increased by 1.3% by July, 18.9% by September, 45.1% by December, and 56.7% by January
[Column 1] for Black persons; and 0.6% by July, 19% by September, 63.1% by December, and
82.8% by January for White persons [Column 3]. As a result of the greater increase in COVID19 mortality among White populations, the Black/White mortality ratio has declined over time.
Furthermore, these trends held even when controlled for by county characteristics [Columns 56].

estimates show similar time trends of COVID-19 mortality within counties. Columns 1 and 2
further support that total COVID-19 mortality has increased for both racial groups; however,
greater increases in White mortality since September has resulted in a closing racial gap in recent
months. By January 2021, the cumulative Black/White COVID mortality ratio had dropped by
0.343 (22.5%) compared to June [Column 3]. Consistency between the OLS regression and
county fixed-effects models suggests that the shifting COVID mortality burden is not driven by
changes in the regional distribution of COVID mortality, but rather by changes within counties.
Our analysis reported similar results when a single fixed-effect model was used to estimate
mortality trends for both Black and White populations together, compared to estimating the trend
separately (Appendix 1).
Columns 4 and 5 extend the models to include covariates to study the role of COVID-19
prevalence on the Black/White mortality ratio. Total per capita mortality and lagged positive per
capita tests are both used to assess prevalence. Controlling for total mortality per capita and
positive tests per capita nearly fully attenuates the downward trend in racial difference. In
comparison, the January coefficient suggests a comparatively small time-specific effect. Overall,
the coefficients approach 0, indicating no change over time. Thus, county-level variation in
infection prevalence seems to act as the primary driver of time-based declines in Black/White
COVID-19 mortality ratio. However, some small but statistically significant effects persist, such
as in January, suggesting that the Black/White mortality ratio declined slightly more than
expected during the January surge.

3.3 Heterogeneity by Age, Population Density, and Region
Assessment of heterogeneity in the time trends by region, age groups, and population
density revealed that the Black/White COVID-19 mortality ratio has declined across all three age
groups (0-64, 65-84, and ≥85 years) since June 2020; however, this gap has converged the most
among persons aged less than 65 years. In June, the Black/White COVID-19 mortality gap was
greatest among those under 65 years of age, with Black persons nearly six times more likely to
die from COVID-19 than their White counterparts. By the end of January, the Black/White
COVID-19 mortality ratio had declined by 1.99 from 4.75 in June, driven by rapid increases in
COVID-19 mortality among young and middle-aged White patients.
Additionally, a significant negative interaction was observed between time and
population density from September 2020 onward, with regard to cumulative Black and White
COVID-19 mortality, indicating that counties with higher population density experienced
relatively smaller increases in mortality. Conversely, regarding the racial gap, the positive
interaction between time and population density suggests that counties with higher population
density experienced less cumulative convergence between Black and White COVID-19 mortality
since September.
Analysis by region revealed large geographic differences (Appendix 4). Compared to the
time trends for the Northeast and Midwest, COVID-19 mortality increased more rapidly in the
West and the South, for both Black and White populations. Similar to the national time trends
shown in Table 3, COVID-19 mortality increased more among White persons in the Midwest,
the West, and the South, resulting in larger declines in the racial gap over time. For example,
among White persons living in the Midwest, total COVID mortality in January 2021 increased

125% relative to June 2020, while mortality among Black persons increased 85.5%. The
considerable reduction in the Black/White COVID-19 mortality ratio in December reflects this
increase in COVID-19 mortality among White persons in the Midwest. In the Northeast,
increases in COVID-19 mortality have been comparatively similar for Black and White
populations, resulting in an attenuated decline in the Black/White COVID-19 mortality ratio.
In order to assess whether the regional trends were driven by the region’s different stages
of the pandemic (as suggested by the differing intercepts in June), prevalence covariates were
added to an interacted model with regional coefficients (Appendix 5). This additional analysis
revealed that differences between regions at each time point approach zero when accounting for
COVID-19 prevalence, suggesting that differences in the Black/White mortality ratio by region
primarily reflect different stages of the pandemic rather than differences in inherent regional
characteristics.
4. Discussion:
Our study set out to understand changes over time in the burdens of COVID-19 mortality
in non-Hispanic Black and White populations, and the ratio between the two. This study makes
three key contributions to the literature.
First, we investigate these trends over a comparatively long time period, from June 2020
through January 2021, during which an additional surge in cases occurred. Our results show that
the national convergence between Black and White COVID-19 mortality outcomes was
primarily driven by trends within counties. Previous work has suggested that changes in the
regional dispersion of COVID-19 between countries or regions was driving national changes in
the relationship between Black and White mortality (Gold et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2021).

However, our fixed-effects approach reveals that the driving force for the observed mortality
convergence is occurring within counties. We find that even controlling for all county-specific
time-invariant characteristics, these time trends persist.
Second, we show that the observed time trends can be almost entirely accounted for by
the relationship between COVID-19 prevalence and the Black/White mortality ratio. Because
COVID-19 cases rose over time, time and cumulative COVID-19 mortality are highly correlated.
However, variations in COVID-19 prevalence at the county level enable us to separate the
effects of time and prevalence, allowing us to identify a strong negative relationship between
changes in COVID-19 prevalence and the Black/White mortality ratio that nearly fully accounts
for the observed trends over time. This has important implications for understanding observed
disparities in COVID-19 mortality, as linked to the trajectory of disease prevalence rather than
specific activity at certain timepoints.
Third, we document heterogeneity in the time trends observed. We find that mortality in
Black and White populations grew the most among individuals under 65 years of age. We also
show that in younger populations, the Black/White mortality ratio fell the most. In addition, we
find that places with higher population density experienced less COVID-19 mortality increases,
and less convergence between Black and White outcomes. Finally, we show geographic variation
in the time trend. While the overall pattern is similar between census regions, the Northeast saw
smaller increases in COVID mortality over the specified interval, as well as less convergence
between outcomes in Black and White populations. However, the regional variation can be
nearly fully accounted for by changes in COVID-19 prevalence, suggesting that regions were at
different stages of the pandemic, and providing further evidence for the core role of prevalence
in driving mortality disparities rather than time.

Several potential mechanisms could explain the convergence over time between Black
and White mortality, including changes in the regional prevalence of disease, exposure between
populations, or vulnerability of individuals affected by COVID-19 over time. Our results suggest
that the mechanism driving convergence is primarily affecting mortality within the county level,
and is potentially linked to changes in cumulative COVID-19 prevalence rather than time. Given
prior evidence that conditional on hospitalization, mortality among Black and White COVID-19
patients is similar, we discuss potential mechanisms upstream of hospitalization (Goyal et al.,
2020; Krishnamoorthy et al., 2021; Moore, 2020; Renelus et al., 2020).
Regarding the role of regional prevalence, contrary to previous findings, our results
suggest that regional changes in prevalence of COVID-19 are not the primary driver of
convergence in racial mortality. Using the county fixed-effects approach, we show that the trends
observed nationally are primarily occurring within, rather than between, counties. Furthermore,
our results suggest that the primary mechanisms involved are taking place within smaller
geographic areas, and that shifts in mortality trends are not accounted for by time-invariant
county characteristics (such as population density or demographic composition).
While exposure between populations is a difficult mechanism to assess, particularly due
to changing COVID-19 testing availability, the convergence over time between national per
capita positive tests in Black and White populations parallels our core results (Appendix Figure
1). Changes over time in exposure to COVID-19 between the two populations is likely one of the
driving forces in the observed mortality trends. The relationship between changes in exposure
and changes in mortality is consistent with our findings on the effects of population density.
Counties with dense populations, including cities, experienced more significant COVID-19
exposures earlier in the pandemic, and experienced less percent change in mortality later on.

Furthermore, our results on the relationship between population density and mortality are
consistent with evidence that areas of greater population density had both more effective and
more persistent social distancing over time (Garnier et al., 2020). A potential behavioral
mechanism may also be at play, and would be consistent with our results linking COVID-19
prevalence and mortality. Black populations faced much greater COVID-19 mortality earlier in
the pandemic, and a combination of public health outreach and community exposure to the
effects of the pandemic may have led to increased behavioral avoidance of COVID-19 later on.
Another potential mechanism includes temporal differences in mortality among
vulnerable populations. It is possible that vulnerable groups may have had less control over
exposure, particularly earlier in the pandemic, resulting in disproportionate COVID-19 infections
and deaths early on, “front-loading” mortality in vulnerable groups. A wealth of literature has
shown how systematic forces place Black populations at higher risk of exposure, including
prevalence of “essential worker” classifications (Zelner et al., 2020). Furthermore, pre-existing
conditions that could increase an individual’s likelihood of dying due to COVID-19 are more
prevalent in Black populations. A combination of these health and socioeconomic factors may
have resulted in increased vulnerability of Black populations relative to White populations early
in the pandemic, contributing to the observed time trends. Prior evidence from persons with
kidney failure is consistent with this theory: amongst this at-risk population, Black mortality
exceeded White mortality by the largest margin early on in the pandemic (Kim et al., 2021). This
mechanism would also be consistent with the relationship between the Black/White mortality
ratio and changes in COVID-19 prevalence.

5. Limitations
This study has several limitations. We used provisional COVID-19 mortality data in
which counties may have had differential delays in reporting deaths. Further, provisional death
counts are incomplete, and so our study likely underestimates the cumulative number of deaths
for any given interval. Additionally, due to confidentiality concerns, only counties with more
than 10 deaths for both Black and White individuals are included. Although the counties used in
the study comprise the majority of the U.S. population, they do not constitute a random subset of
U.S. counties, and tend to have greater absolute populations and more COVID-19 deaths per
capita than the average U.S. county. Therefore, while using the county fixed-effects approach
controls for all fixed factors related to a county’s inclusion in our data, mitigating the effects of
selection, our results may not generalize to counties not included in the sample. A third
limitation is the lack of county-level data disaggregated by both age and race. Because our
estimates are not age-adjusted, our findings likely understate the true difference in outcomes
between Black and White populations. In addition, despite the use of a county fixed-effects
framework, there may still be confounding factors that remain unaccounted for.
6. Conclusions
Between June 2020 and January 2021, per capita COVID-19 mortality increased more
substantially for White populations than for Black populations, resulting in a declining
Black/White COVID-19 mortality ratio. These effects persist even when controlling for all
county-specific time-invariant factors, and are not driven by changes in the regional presence of
COVID-19 prevalence. The observed convergence in Black/White COVID-19 mortality ratio
occurred faster among younger populations and in counties with less dense populations, and

slower in the Northeast where COVID-19 mortality grew less over the studied interval. Nearly
all of the observed trends over time, including regional variation in the time trends, can be
explained by changes in cumulative COVID-19 prevalence, suggesting that the primary driver of
convergence between Black and White mortality outcomes is not time-specific, but rather due to
the trajectory of infection prevalence.
Our findings suggest that the mechanisms that drive differences in mortality over time in
Black and White populations are both occurring primarily within small geographic areas and are
linked to changes in COVID-19 prevalence rather than time. Further research into potential
mechanisms consistent with these criteria, such as changes in exposure and behavioral responses
to prior mortality, or potential ‘front-loading’ of more-vulnerable patients, would be of high
value. In particular, longitudinal studies of health behavior and of the characteristics of
individuals who died earlier versus later in the pandemic may provide insight into the way
vulnerability shapes mortality outcomes over the course of a long pandemic. This type of
research will be important for fully understanding COVID-19-related mortality disparities, and
may even shed light on some of the mechanisms driving health disparities broadly.
