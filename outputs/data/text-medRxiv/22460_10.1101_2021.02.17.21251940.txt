Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impose a significant burden on global health
infrastructure. While identification and containment of new cases remains important,
laboratories must now pivot and consider assessment of SARS-CoV-2 immunity in the setting of
the recent availability of multiple COVID-19 vaccines.

Here we have utilized the latest Abbott

Alinity semi-quantitative IgM and quantitative IgG spike protein (SP) serology assays (IgMSP and
IgGSP) in combination with Abbott Alinity IgG nucleocapsid (NC) antibody test (IgGNC) to assess
antibody responses in a cohort of 1236 unique participants comprised of naïve, SARS-CoV-2
infected, and vaccinated (including both naïve and recovered) individuals. The IgMSP and IgGSP
assays were highly specific (100%) with no cross-reactivity to archived samples recovered prior
to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, including those from individuals with seasonal coronavirus
infections. Clinical sensitivity was 96% after 15 days for both IgMSP and IgGSP assays
individually. When considered together, the sensitivity was 100%. A combination of NC- and
SP-specific serologic assays clearly differentiated naïve, SARS-CoV-2-infected, and vaccinerelated immune responses. Vaccination resulted in a significant increase in IgGSP and IgMSP
titers, with a major rise in IgGSP following the booster (second) dose in the naïve group. In
contrast, SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals had several fold higher IgGSP responses than
naïve following the primary dose, with a comparatively dampened response following the
booster. This work illustrates the strong clinical performance of these new serological assays
and their utility in evaluating and distinguishing serological responses to infection and
vaccination.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel human
pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). The global spread of the virus began
in early 2020 and continues to dramatically impact global public health infrastructure. Until
recently, identification of positive cases, treatment of a patient with severe or life-threatening
symptomology, and containment to prevent disease transmission have been the most widely
utilized epidemiological tools used. However, the recent availability of vaccines engineered to
provide protective humoral immunity represents a major step forward in the national response to
SARS-CoV-2, and a pivoting point for the clinical laboratory.
Laboratory diagnostic focus must now expand to include a more thorough assessment of
SARS-CoV-2 immunity due to vaccine availability. The molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2
RNA remains the gold standard for disease diagnosis. These methods are highly sensitive in
the immediate period post-symptom onset, but diagnostic sensitivity diminishes by about 50%
after one week of symptoms (1-3). Conversely, the sensitivity of serological assays improves
following two weeks after symptom onset (2,4), making these methods helpful for establishing
disease prevalence in a population.
Akin to natural infection, the process of vaccination stimulates the immune system to
form memory B-cells that produce neutralizing antibodies (Ab). The two successful messenger
RNA (mRNA)-based COVID-19 vaccines approved and administered in the United States
contain mRNA that encodes the spike (SP) protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Pfizer-BioNTech and
Moderna). Serological methods are also important for their roles in assessing immune status in
vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. However, to accurately address these questions, the
selected serological tests must exhibit exceptional sensitivity and specificity with minimal crossreactivity.

In this work, we evaluated the clinical performance of two new serological assays
designed to quantitatively evaluate the presence of specific IgM (IgMSP) and IgG (Abbott SARSCoV-2 IgG II; IgGSP) recognizing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Additionally, we evaluated the use
of these assays in combination with an assay which detects IgG specific to the nucleocapsid
protein (IgGNC) assay (Abbott) in SARS-CoV-2-infected, naïve/uninfected, and vaccinated
groups. In addition to exhibiting excellent analytical characteristics, we found the combination of
these spike-protein and nucleocapsid-specific assays as an excellent tool for the assessment of
serological responses to prior infection versus vaccination.
Materials and Methods
Patient samples. A total of 1236 individuals (1428 specimens) were used in this study.
This included 263 inpatients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection (413 samples), 404 unique
patients for specificity and cross-reactivity studies including, 338 patients with samples obtained
prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, 569 individuals (611 samples) tested in outpatient
setting with COVID-19 vaccination information available (Fig. 1). For the assessment of clinical
sensitivity, only inpatients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection with PCR and documented
dates of symptom onset were included. In order to accurately evaluate the serological response
following vaccination, only outpatients with information concerning their vaccine status were
included. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center.
Analytical precision.

Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLIA

guidelines and in accordance with standard laboratory practices at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center. A typical directed 5-day precision study following CLSI EP5-A3
guidelines was conducted. Two levels of vendor provided quality controls were tested with 5
replicates in the morning and 5 replicates in the afternoon for 5 days for each test.

Measurement range and functional sensitivity. Linearity (analytical measurement
range) testing was performed as a single day study following CLSI EP6-A. Patient samples with
elevated IgGSP and IgMSP values were chosen to prepare linearity panels per CLSI EP6-A and
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Linearity panels consisted of 7-8 levels covering the
linear range of the test, with one level within the 10th percentile of the lower reportable range,
one level with the 90th percentile of the upper reportable range and one level around the cut-off
range of the assays. A minimum of three replicates were tested for each level.
Clinical reportable range was calculated by diluting samples with elevated values that
were just below the upper analytical measurement range of the assays at 1:2 and 1:4 dilutions,
and comparing the results to their neat (undiluted) sample results (≤ 10% acceptability criteria).
Functional sensitivity of the quantitative IgGSP test (7 AU/mL) was verified by running a neat
patient sample (8.3 AU/mL) and its 1:1 dilution (4.15 AU/mL, expected value) ten times each
and calculating their % CV (acceptable criteria ≤ 20% imprecision) as recommended by the
manufacturer.
Carry over and sample stability studies. Carry over studies were undertaken with a
positive (high sample) and negative control (low sample). The high sample was run three times
followed by three runs of low sample and this was repeated three times. Ten patient samples
including both positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 were tested repeatedly over a period of 12
days for specimen stability analysis. An acceptance criterion of 10% or an index value of 0.1 for
IgMSP and 5 AU/ml for IgGSP were utilized.
IgMSP assay. The AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgMSP assay has recently been granted
Emergency Use Authorization by the US Food and Drug administration. IgMSP testing was
performed on the Abbott Alinity i platform per manufacturer instructions. The test is a
chemiluminescent microparticle (CMIA) assay for semi-quantitative assessment of IgM
antibodies to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and plasma sample. A vendor

recommended cut-off of 1.0 (index value) for reactivity/positivity of infection (FDA approval for
CoV-2 IgM; 6R87; H14977R01) was applied.
IgGSP assay. SARS-CoV-2 IgG II quantitative testing (under FDA review) was performed
on the Abbott Alinity i platform in accordance with manufacturer’s package insert.

In this

antibody CMIA test, the SARS-CoV-2 antigen coated paramagnetic microparticles bind to the
IgG antibodies that attach to the virus' spike protein in human serum and plasma sample. The
resulting chemiluminescence in relative light units (RLU) following the addition of anti-human
IgG-labeled in comparison with the IgG II calibrator/standard indicates the strength of response,
which reflects the quantity of IgGSP present. 50 AU/mL and above in this test are considered as
positive. This quantitative measurement of IgGSP can be helpful to evaluate an individual’s
humoral response to vaccines.
IgGNC assay. The Abbott Alinity i SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG assay is a
semi-quantitative CMIA assay that has been previously verified for routine patient testing in our
institution’s clinical laboratory, and the index values of 1.4 and above is considered as positive
(5) per the manufacturer’s instructions.
RT-PCR testing. The Abbott M2000 or Abbott Alinity M RT-PCR-based molecular
testing/confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 was performed using nasopharyngeal specimens collected
in viral transport media as previously described (5).
Clinical Specificity. Specificity was evaluated in the pre-COVID-19 era remnant banked
plasma samples from 217 unique patients collected from blood donors September to November,
2019 and from March to April 2020.
Cross-reactivity studies. The serum/plasma specimens for cross-reactivity studies
included HLA lab-confirmed positive samples (collected from January 1, 2015 to September 30,
2019) for CMV IgG, influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus, and endemic human

coronaviruses (n=92). Also, the samples that typically contain significant levels of antibodies
such as lupus patients (n=29; collected between 2004-2007) positive for anti-nuclear antibodies
(ANA) and anti-double stranded DNA, and hematological malignancies (HM) (n=66; collected
between March and October 2020) were included.
Statistical analysis. Data analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism software
(Version 9,0.1, San Diego, CA, USA). Data are presented as median with range. When
experiments involved more than two groups, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple
comparison post-hoc analysis was used to analyze the statistical differences. For experiments
involving only two groups, as appropriate, paired or unpaired Student’s t-test was performed. A
p value less than 0.05 (<0.05) was considered statistically significant.
Results
Analytical performance. For both the IgGSP and IgMSP assays, the imprecision was less
than 5%. The analytical measurement range of the IgGSP assay was from 4.2 - 50,000 AU/mL
(clinical reportable range up to 200,000 AU/mL) and for IgMSP assay we observed a linearity up
to 16 index value. Manufacturer recommended functional sensitivity of 7 AU/mL of the
quantitative IgGSP assay was confirmed. There were no carry-over issues with both the assays.
The samples kept refrigerated were stable over 12 days test period.
Clinical specificity and cross-reactivity. Clinical specificity of the assay was evaluated
with serum/plasma from blood donors (SARS-CoV-2 uninfected) obtained before the
emergence of SARS-CoV-2. None of these samples were positive (0/217; 100% specificity) for
SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG (Fig. 2A) and spike-specific IgM (Fig. 2B) that matched with the
manufacturer’s claimed specificity. The median IgGSP value and IgMSP index value were found
to be 1.92 and 0.05, respectively, well below the corresponding positive cut-off limit of 50 AU/mL
for IgGSP and 1.0 index value for IgMSP.

Cross-reactivity of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgGSP and IgMSP assays was also evaluated
in the setting of respiratory illness and disease conditions, including lupus and hematological
malignancies (HM) (primarily multiple myeloma) samples, where antibody production is
significantly elevated (Figs. 2C & 2D). 121 samples obtained prior to SARS-CoV-2 emergence
did not cross-react with IgGSP. Interestingly, among 66 HM patient samples collected in 2020, 2
patients (~1.1%) were found to produce a positive value for IgGSP indicating some sort of crossreactivity (Fig. 2C). One of these cases (a multiple myeloma patient) was confirmed by PCR as
having recovered from COVID-19 upon chart review. Interestingly, the second positive patient
was repeatedly negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR and strongly positive for Hepatitis viral panel
serology testing. As no history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure could be established for this patient,
further investigation of this IgGSP-specific apparent cross-reactivity is warranted.

No cross-

reactivity was observed in the IgMSP assay (0/187 patients) (Fig. 2D).
Clinical sensitivity. We evaluated the clinical sensitivity of IgGSP and IgMSP assays in
our RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 inpatient cohort where reliable information concerning the date
and duration of symptom onset was available. Not surprisingly, we noted that the sensitivity of
the assays increased proportionally with time following symptom onset, consistent with the
developmental kinetics of a specific antibody response. The sensitivity of IgGSP was 39% and
58% at 5 and 10 days following symptom onset (Table 1 and Fig. s1A). Extending the analysis
of these patients between 16-20 days post symptom onset and beyond revealed a clinical
sensitivity of IgGSP assay was 96% and 98% respectively. As expected, clinical sensitivity of
IgGSP assay was much higher (74% within 10 days and 100% within 20 days) based on the RTPCR confirmed date of diagnosis (Table s1; Fig. s1B).
Clinical sensitivity of IgMSP test was comparable to that of the IgGSP test both within 10
days and 20 days post symptom onset. At 20 days symptom onset and beyond, the sensitivity
of IgMSP test was 95% (Table 1), and 82% based on RT-PCR confirmed date of diagnosis

(Table s1). Importantly, when IgGSP and IgMSP results were combined and analyzed for assay
positivity in either format, the sensitivity reached 100% after 15 days from symptom onset and
RT-PCR confirmed date (Table 1 and Table s1).
Longitudinal assessment in COVID-19 inpatients. We next used our IgGSP values
over 360 specimens to assess the change in the units over every timepoint collected since the
days post-infection confirmation by PCR (DPCR) with the data plotted as a frequency
distribution mapping (Fig. s2A). Within the first 15 days of DPCR, the median values gradually
increased and reached an average of 4466 AU/mL. A dramatic increase in the titer began to
occur after 15 days (with a median average of 59396 AU/mL) (Fig. s2A). Beyond 27th day, we
noticed a decreasing trend in IgGSP titers, however these results still remained above the
positivity threshold (≥50 AU/mL). While a lower assay sensitivity was noted in the early period
post symptom onset, it is notable that in some samples, the IgGSP assay was able to detect
positivity within the same timeframe as detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR.

It is

interesting to note that in three samples, IgGSP assay was sensitive to detect the positivity in 0th
day, which is the date of infection confirmation by PCR.
In the same cohort, akin to IgGSP, we observed the overall tendency of IgMSP to rise over
the positivity threshold of 1.0 index value. Particularly, within the first week of symptoms, the
distribution was highly inconsistent, and the maximum median index was only 4.345 (Fig. s2B).
In contrast, we noted the IgMSP distribution to progress regularly in tandem over the 2nd week
time with the median IgMSP consistently doubling. This subsequently reached as high as ~38 by
the mid-2nd week (17th day). In 4 samples, IgMSP was sensitive enough to detect the positivity in
0th day of infection confirmation by PCR (Fig. s2B). While we were able to detect IgMSP until
80th day, the IgMSP values were found to greatly oscillate beyond 23 days with a decreasing
trend, however, still well above the cut-off 1.0 index value (Fig. s2B).

IgGNC assay cut-off for positivity much lower in exCOVID-19 (recovered) patients.
This study included 16 blood samples from known COVID-19-recovered patients (recovered
more than 3-11 months prior to sampling). Analysis of this group of patient samples with IgG
assay specific for nucleocapsid protein (IgGNC), a main differentiator of immune responses to
natural SARS-CoV-2 infection versus those to spike protein-based vaccines, showed index
values ranging from 0.2 to <1.4 index value (Table 2; Fig. 3). This is significantly lower than
manufacturer recommended cut-off index level of 1.4 used to detect active (early) infection.
However, during waning humoral response (recovery period and post recovery), our data points
out a value less than 1.4 and up to 0.2 index value may predict exCOVID-19 (recovered) (Table
2; Fig. 3). We therefore applied a cutoff below 0.2 for IgGNC test to predict the true negatives
(the absence of COVID-19), naïve group. This is important in the current setting of increasing
numbers of COVID-19-recovered patients in the general population. More reliably, where a
combination of tests is possible, the highest diagnostic accuracy of true negatives can be
attained when combining a value of <0.2 index value for IgGNC with <50 AU/mL for IgGSP and
<1.0 index value for IgMSP. 99% of the samples analyzed using this combination of results were
confirmed as negative by RT-PCR or from patients who were in an early period of infection. By
contrast, COVID-19 patients tested between 10-20 days of symptom onset and filtered with a
combo of ≥1.4 index value for IgGNC with≥ 50 AU/mL for IgGSP and ≥1.0 index value for IgMSP
showed 99% positivity for PCR (Table 2). Subsequently we applied these filters wherever we
analyzed naïve vaccinated and exCOVID-19 vaccinated groups.
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination results in robust SARS-COV-2 spike protein-specific Ab
responses. An exciting facet of this work is the inclusion of vaccinated patient samples in our
analysis. Among those vaccinated, 91% received the Pfizer-BioNTech formulation (n=132) and
8% obtained the Moderna formulation (n=13). Ab responses in the vaccinated group (n=145)
were compared to that of the unvaccinated group (n=424). The unvaccinated group included

patients that were both RT-PCR positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgGSP Ab
response ranged from 0 to 49517 AU/mL, with a median of 6396 AU/mL (95% CI, 3814 to 9729)
(Fig. 4A) in the vaccinated group.

The median antibody level for vaccinated patients was

significantly higher (~6400-fold, p<0.0001) relative to those unvaccinated (Fig. 4A). Intriguingly,
~18% (76/424) of unvaccinated patients had IgGSP titers greater than positive detection
threshold despite RT-PCR negativity. IgMSP production was significantly (p<0.0001) higher in
the vaccinated versus unvaccinated group, with a more modest median fold increase (~23%,
1.34 vs 0.06) (Fig. 4B). Nearly 13% (53/424) of unvaccinated patients were above the IgMSP
positive threshold despite RT-PCR negativity.
The identification of patients with positive IgGSP/IgMSP results despite a lack of
vaccination and historically negative RT-PCRs prompted us to investigate anti-nucleocapsid IgG
titers in these patients as a marker of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. Surprisingly, about 12%
(51/424) were positive (≥1.4), leaving 26 (7%) patients with positive IgGSP. These patients could
have silent infection (present or past) because they were also positive for either spike IgG or
IgM.

In a majority (82%; 347/424) of unvaccinated (UV) patients with no known SARS-CoV-2

exposure, the IgGSP and IgMSP titers were determined to be lower than the vendorrecommended cut-off.
Figure s3 illustrates the pattern of IgGSP Ab titer relationships over the days following
COVID-19 vaccination (DFD). This group (187 specimens from 145 unique individuals) included
both RT-PCR verified cases, as well as subjects with no exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Within 10
days, the first dose yielded a minimal increase in vaccine-specific Ab response irrespective of
formulation in 4 of 187 specimens. More than 54% (102/187) of the vaccinated group had 5-fold
increase, 44% (81/187) had 10-fold increase, and 17% had 25-fold increase in the median IgGSP
titers when compared to the UV group (Fig. s3A). Samples up to 21 days are inclusive of the
initial vaccine dose, and >21 days are inclusive of the booster. While an increase in titers

following the 1st dose of vaccination was clearly observed, not surprisingly its distribution was
variable (Dark red rectangle; Fig. s3A). While the number of observations available at or less
than 10 days following the 1st dose was small, 4 of the individuals that were tested had titers
under the positive threshold and 2 had titers over 45000 AU/mL. Clearly, after the 2nd dose of
vaccination, the IgGSP titers was consistently high and comparatively exhibited a more uniform
trend (Green Oval, Fig. s3A). Interestingly, 2 patients exhibited a null response following 21
days post vaccination. One of these patients was a HM (multiple myeloma) patient, while the
medical history of the other is unknown.
In parallel, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgMSP levels were also increased following vaccination
in the naïve subjects (Fig. 4B & s3B). In particular, the distribution analysis demonstrated that
following the primary dose of vaccination at week 1 and week 2, ~71% of the subjects had
values above the positive threshold (Fig. s3B). However, at 21 days and beyond post booster
dose, IgMSP levels again rose, and a noticeable over-the threshold cluster was seen compared
to the primary vaccination (Fig. s3B). Although the number of Moderna-vaccinated recipients in
this evaluation is modest, both the IgGSP and IgMSP responses appeared to be comparable to
that of individuals who received the Pfizer-BioNTech formulation.
Vaccination response in naïve population. Next, we compared the IgGSP response
after the first and booster dose in the naïve vaccinated group that was derived by filtering out for
IgGNC ≥ 0.2 based on Table 2 & Fig. 3. Following the first dose, we observed IgGSP positivity
with a median of 2217 AU/mL (95% CI, 0-44182), which was drastically increased by 8.2 fold
following the booster to a median of 18272 AU/mL (at 98% CI, 11724-21750) (p<0.001) (Fig.
5A). The cumulative IgMSP response after the primary dose of vaccination in the naïve subjects
was found to be with a median of 1.1 index, which is above the positive cut-off (at 95% CI, 0.871.4) (Fig. 5B). This was further significantly increased (p=0.0236) by 1.7-fold to a median of
1.95 (at 98% CI, 1.16-3.3) following the booster dose (Fig. 5B). The IgGNC remained unchanged

between dose 1 and dose 2 in the naïve vaccinated group (Fig. 5C). This result suggests that
there is a robust response after the booster dose in the naïve group.
Vaccination response in exCOVID-19 (recovered) patients. Currently CDC
recommends vaccination in those cohorts that are recovered from COVID-19 three months or
prior.

Therefore, understanding the immune response in this population is important.

ExCOVID-19 group filter was derived from the known recovered patients (Table 2 & Fig. 3).
The median IgGSP titers following dose 1 and dose 2 in the exCOVID-19 group was found to be
17519 AU/mL and 20760 AU/mL, respectively (Fig. 6A). However, unlike the naïve vaccinated
D1 vs D2 (Fig. 5A), the booster dose in the exCOVID-19 group displayed only a dampened
response (Fig. 6A, lane 3 vs 4). A similar response to IgGSP was noted for the IgMSP in both the
naïve vaccinated and exCOVID-19 vaccinated groups (Fig. 6B).
Next, we compared the vaccination response in exCOVID-19 against the active
infection-based immune response (UVC). The infection response was confirmed by the IgGNC
levels that had a median of 3.3 (at 96% CI, 2.78 - 4.02) that is 2.4-fold above the positive
threshold cutoff (UVC; lane 1; Fig. 6C). Correspondingly, the median IgGSP and IgMSP titers
were found to be 1046 (at 96% CI, 575.3 – 1518) and 4.65 (at 96% CI, 2.78 – 4.02),
respectively (lane 1; Fig 6A & 6B). Both the doses robustly increased the IgGSP response in
relation to the infected group, while it was significant only after dose 1 (p<0.0001; lane 2 vs lane
1; Fig. 6A). In contrast, IgMSP levels was significantly lower in the vaccinated group when
compared to the infected group (2&3 vs 1, Fig. 6B). Interestingly, IgGNC median titers remained
much lower by 1-fold (0.73) than the positive cut-off of 1.4 suggesting IgGNC response is
infection-specific and not vaccination-specific. The vaccinated exCOVID-19 groups (D1 & D2)
displayed significantly lower IgGNC response when compared to the unvaccinated COVID-19
group and much below the positive threshold (lane 2&3 vs 1; Fig. 6C).

Within same patients, the antibody titers’ evaluation further confirmed the restrained
response of booster dose in the exCOVID-19 recovered patients (lane 3 vs 4; Fig. s4A & s4B).
Whereas the response was robust in the naïve vaccinated group (lane 1 vs 2; Fig. s4A & s4B).
Within patient as well as within group comparison showed unchanged response for IgGNC (Fig.
s4C). As expected exCOVID-19 had higher nucleocapsid IgG levels when compared to the
naïve (lane 3&4 vs lane 1&2, Fig. s4C). This result indicates a significant response for the first
dose in the exCOVID subjects, while the booster dose appears to exert a restrained response.
Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 serology has played very much a supporting role in the clinical diagnosis
of COVID-19 compared to molecular detection of viral RNA. However, the recent availability of
sensitive and specific antibody assays to quantitatively evaluate vaccination responses elevates
the role of these important diagnostic tools at this juncture in the COVID-19 pandemic. In this
work, we demonstrate that the Abbott Alinity quantitative IgGSP and IgMSP assays are sensitive
and specific, and work well in a routine clinical setting. Additionally, these assays, when used in
combination with the currently marketed IgGNC assay, is able to measure and distinguish
COVID-19 antibody responses from SARS-CoV-2 natural infection versus vaccination over a
broad dynamic range.
The analytical performance of both the IgMSP and IgGSP assays met the acceptance
criteria for the implementation of the assay in the clinical laboratory. The specificity of these
assays was 100% in the samples from pre-COVID-19 period and there was no serological
cross-reactivity in patients infected with other respiratory viruses (including seasonal
coronaviruses). For IgMSP assay, our results closely mirrored data provided by the manufacturer
in the product insert. The high positive predictive value gained from minimal serological crossreactivity in patients infected with other respiratory pathogens or autoimmune-associated
antibodies is notable. Evaluation of the IgGSP and IgMSP assays utilizing RT-PCR positivity and

days post symptom onset was to confirm the infection and the antibody response following the
infection, respectively. The low level of sensitivity in samples collected between 5 and 15 days
after symptom onset or PCR positivity is not surprising given the kinetics of antibody generation
at these timepoints. However, the significant increase in sensitivity to greater than 95% beyond
15 days highlights the accuracy of these assays in the setting of an activated and productive
humoral immune response. Therefore, these serologic assays, when used in conjunction with a
molecular method which exhibits a lower degree of sensitivity at periods where serology is
strongest, allows for a broad and thorough interrogation of a patient's COVID-19 status.
Interestingly, when the IgGSP with IgMSP assays were analyzed in tandem, the sensitivity
of the combination was improved than either the IgMSP or IgGSP assay individually with 100%
sensitivity achieved after 15 days. Still, false-negatives in this paired approach were identified
within 15 days, which could be due to host-specific factors, variations in immune responses, low
antibody titers, or early SARS-CoV-2 infection.
While IgM is largely useful in determining the likelihood of a recent infection, the
dynamics of how long this isotype remains detectable are ill-defined. In this study, we have
detected IgMSP for a protracted period (beyond 20 days and up to 80 days after symptom onset)
with an increased sensitivity. This observation is more consistent with other studies that have
detected IgM after ≥90 days following infection of SARS-CoV-2 (6,7). Interestingly, from our
dataset, simultaneous detection of IgM and IgG was also noted, particularly, with the detection
of IgG during early period, as well. This illustrates that seroconversion may occur
simultaneously or shortly thereafter IgMSP induction, in addition to the archetypal sequential
class-switching responses (8).
The analysis of serum specimens from vaccinated patients is an exciting aspect of this
work. These assays were able to detect and monitor vaccine-elicited antibody responses when
compared to an unvaccinated patient group. The elevated levels of specific IgMSP and IgGSP

observed in this work is in agreement with the clinical trial data (9,10) for both currently available
formulations of COVID-19 vaccines. Because it is not possible to parse if spike protein-specific
antibodies arise because of vaccination or natural infection, we chose to utilize a currently
marketed nucleocapsid-specific IgG test with the IgMSP/IgGSP assays, which would only be
positive in the setting of a natural infection.
Our results suggest changing the IgGNC assay cut-off to ‘rule-in’ or ‘rule-out’ the exCOVID-19. Specifically, our preliminary studies show a “grey zone” of IgGNC index values (0.2 1.4) in RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 recovered specimens (n=16 from 11 patients, recovery
period within 3-11 months). While IgGNC and IgGSP assays demonstrated high clinical specificity
and sensitivity independently using them in combination may allow distinguishing exCOVID-19
from vaccinated individuals in the field setting. Hence, we believe it is possible to expand the
utility of the marketed IgGNC assay to identify recovered individuals who are likely to present
with waning antibody titers (11, 12).

A similar revision of the IgGNC threshold has been

suggested to improve assay sensitivity for early stage (<6 days) of COVID-19 infection (13).
Importantly, a model-based study recently proposed the use serostatus for prioritizing
vaccination (14) and along these lines, the new cut-off range could improve the applicability with
respect to identifying the previously infected and recovered.

By identifying the relative

abundance and characteristics of a population that is susceptible, infected, and recovered would
be critical to better inform and devise the immunization roadmap.

However, the cut-offs’

modification must be carefully considered in the clinical need and deployment setting. Studies
to test the use of this cut-off algorithm on a larger scale are ongoing.
The combination of the new IgGSP assay with the other assays, IgMSP or IgGNC can
provide a rigorous evaluation of the vaccination and the antibody responses post-administration
in the immunization setting. The deployment of the COVID-19 vaccine has faced many unique
challenges due to its rapid development, hurried clinical trials and deployment. Limited

knowledge concerning longitudinal outcomes, public uncertainty, and misinformation has
created hesitancy among some of the public to receive this important immunization. These
assays could aid in: (1) establishing the efficacy and kinetics of spike-specific antibody
responses in infected or vaccinated populations, (2) help to identify infected individuals not
previously identified by molecular testing, (3) evaluation of the effectiveness of the adjunct
convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) that typically requires a quantitative assay-coupled
neutralization assay. All of these mechanisms add to the breadth of knowledge concerning the
COVID-19 vaccine and its effects, helping to fill in knowledge gaps and address the concerns of
the public. While the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend
serological testing to assess the COVID-19-driven immunity following mRNA vaccination, the
use of a test that evaluates IgM/IgG to the nucleocapsid antigen for ascertaining prior infection
in case of COVID-19 vaccination has been suggested (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html). Our work highlights an improved utility of a
combination of antibody assays (spike and nucleocapsid) to accomplish this task.
Using these assays, while we observed an increased response to the vaccine following
the primary dose (D1), the booster dose (D2) had a dramatic effect in the naïve subjects.
Among vaccinated exCOVID-19 persons who had recovered from the infection, no significant
difference is seen in IgGSP and IgGMSP titers following D2.

However, D1 in exCOVID-19

recovered individuals elicited strong IgGSP and IgGSP responses of equivalent robustness to that
of the D2 of the naïve group. D1 and D2 specimens from same individuals also confirmed this
finding.

The dramatic D1 response among exCOVID-19 recovered individuals could be

ascribed to the natural SARS-CoV-2 infection functioning in a similar manner as acting as a
priming dose.

This observed response is supported by recent preprint reports that have

demonstrated a single dose of mRNA vaccine in seropositive subjects is sufficient to elicit a
robust immune response comparable to SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects receiving two doses

(15,16). These data raise important questions concerning whether a single dose is sufficient
among previously SARS-CoV-2 infected and/or COVID-19 recovered individuals, however
larger longitudinal studies are needed. Results of such work would have profound implications
on vaccination strategies, particularly in the current setting of high COVID-19 vaccine demand
with limited supply.
In sum, for the first time we demonstrate the clinical utility of the latest IgGSP quantitative
assay (under FDA approval) and IgMSP test in detecting the vaccine response. In addition, the
combination of IgGNC, IgGSP, and IgMSP could be useful to distinguish prior infection status and
vaccine related spike-protein humoral responses. Further, newly redefined IgGNC threshold,
when used in combination with the quantitative IgGSP and IgMsp assays, can accurately identify
COVID-19 recovered individuals allowing an improved diagnostic performance and enhancing
public health surveillance and epidemiological initiatives.
