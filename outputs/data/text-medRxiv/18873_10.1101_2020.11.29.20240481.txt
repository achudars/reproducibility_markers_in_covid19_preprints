Abstract
Observational studies have suggested bidirectional associations between psychiatric disorders
and COVID-19 phenotypes, but results of such studies are inconsistent. Mendelian
Randomization (MR) may overcome limitations of observational studies, e.g. unmeasured
confounding and uncertainties about cause and effect. We aimed to elucidate associations
between neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. To that end,
we applied a two-sample, bidirectional, univariable and multivariable MR design to genetic
data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of neuropsychiatric disorders and
COVID-19 phenotypes (released on 20 Oct. 2020). In single-variable Generalized Summary
MR analysis the most significant and only Bonferroni-corrected significant result was found
for genetic liability to BIP-SCZ (a combined GWAS of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as
cases vs. controls) increasing risk of COVID-19 (OR = 1.17, 95% CI, 1.06-1.28). However,
we found a significant, positive genetic correlation between BIP-SCZ and COVID-19 of
0.295 and could not confirm causal or horizontally pleiotropic effects using another method.
No genetic liabilities to COVID-19 phenotypes increased risk of (neuro)psychiatric disorders.
In multivariable MR using both neuropsychiatric and a range of other phenotypes, only
genetic instruments of BMI remained causally associated with COVID-19. All sensitivity
analyses confirmed the results. In conclusion, while genetic liability to bipolar disorder and
schizophrenia combined slightly increased COVID-19 susceptibility in one univariable
analysis, other MR and multivariable analyses could only confirm genetic underpinnings of
BMI to be causally implicated in COVID-19 susceptibility. Thus, using MR we found no
consistent proof of genetic liabilities to (neuro)psychiatric disorders contributing to COVID19 liability or vice versa, which is in line with at least two observational studies. Previously
reported positive associations between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 by others may
have resulted from statistical models incompletely capturing BMI as a continuous covariate.

Introduction
Several large population-based studies have investigated associations between positive testing
for COVID-19 on the one hand and psychiatric disorders on the other 1-3. Positive test result
likelihoods for psychiatric disorders are inconsistent between those studies: while two of
those cohort studies (from the UK and South Korea) do not report positive associations
between COVID-19 testing and psychiatric disorders 1,4, others (from the UK and the US)
mention odds ratios of 1.5 to 10 for associations between mental disorders and a COVID-19
diagnosis 2,3,5. One observational study reports bidirectional associations between psychiatric
diagnosis in the previous year and COVID-19 2. For a recent diagnosis of a mental disorder in
the US2, odds ratios for COVID-19 were reported to be around 7.6, with evidence for
relatively severe COVID-19 outcomes in those with a diagnosis of mental disorder5. One
limitation of these studies is that psychiatric diagnoses were grouped by some 2,4, e.g. as
mental disorders, psychotic disorders or affective disorders, precluding conclusions about
COVID-19 risks for specific psychiatric disorders. Additionally, some diagnoses, such as
bipolar disorder, were not included in some of the analyses 3. Furthermore, correction for
medical comorbidities decreased several high odd ratios5. Finally, some authors admit
residual socioeconomic factors may not be sufficiently captured in some databases2. Indeed,
as recently noted, confounding or biases (partly) explain associations of COVID-19 with a
range of traits and diseases 6. Mendelian Randomization (MR) has the potential to overcome
two major limitations of observational studies: unmeasured confounding and uncertainties
about cause and effect. Examples of MR studies elucidating risk factors for COVID-19
include two recent studies showing that BMI and smoking are risk factors for COVID-19 7,8.
We are not aware of preprinted or published MR studies of psychiatric disorders and COVID19. The recently updated whole-genome data on COVID-19 phenotypes

(https://www.covid19hg.org/results/, see methods section) further increases the timeliness of
MR approaches to elucidate risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis and severity.
We hypothesized that given the aforementioned inconsistent observational evidence and
attenuation of reported odds ratios when including covariates, psychiatric disorders do not
constitute strong risk factors to contract COVID-19 or develop a severe course of COVID-19.
Similarly, we hypothesized that genetic liability to COVID-19 would not increase
susceptibility to psychiatric disorders. To test our hypotheses, we performed a range of
bidirectional univariable and multivariable MR analyses of genetic liability to major
psychiatric disorders and to COVID-19 susceptibility as well as severe COVID-19.

Methods
Overview
We performed 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) using summary statistics from large
genome-wide association study (GWASs) to examine whether genetic liabilities to
(neuro)psychiatric disorders increase risk of contracting COVID19 and of a severe course of
COVID-19 (forward MR analyses, considering (neuro)psychiatric disorders as exposures and
COVID-19 as outcome). In addition, we used COVID-19 GWASs to examine potential
effects of genetic liabilities to COVID-19 diagnosis and to COVID-19 severity on
(neuro)psychiatric diseases (reverse MR analyses, considering COVID-19 as the exposure
and (neuro)psychiatric phenotypes as the outcomes). The principle of MR analyses is shown
and further explained in Supplementary Figure 1. Most of our methods outlined below have
been previously explained in more detail 9. The GWAS summary statistics we used were
drawn from studies that had obtained written informed consent from participants and received
ethical approval from institutional review boards. No ethical approval for the current analyses
was needed as they were based on publicly available summary statistics.

(Neuro)psychiatric summary statistics
We used the available GWASs with summary statistics for psychiatric disorders including
Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) (a meta-analysis of the stage 1 discovery dataset 10), anxiety 11,12,
anxiety and stress-related diagnoses (ASRD) 11,12, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) 13,
Bipolar disorder (BIP) 14, Schizophrenia (SCZ) 15, and a meta-analysis of BIP and SCZ (BIPSCZ; Table 1)16. To avoid that sample overlap between exposures’ and outcomes’ datasets
impacted results substantially by inducing instrument bias in MR analyses, we excluded UK
Biobank (UKBB) cohorts from (neuro)psychiatric disorders summary statistics. The largest
Anorexia Nervosa GWAS and the largest 2018 and 2019 MDD GWASs contained a large

number of UKBB participants, precluding us from using those GWASs for MR analyses.
Hence, we selected MDD summary statistics from the 23andme cohort13, containing only
10,000 independent SNPs due to participants consent, and thus used these summary statistics
only for univariable forward MR analysis. Similarly, we refrained from using the psychiatric
cross-disorder GWAS as its study population was also partly composed of UKBB
participants. For anxiety and ASRD, we performed meta-analysis in METAL 17 excluding
UKBB participants: of anxiety using the iPSYCH (4,584 cases and 19,225 controls) and
ANGST cohorts (7,016 cases and 14,745 controls) and of ASRD also using the iPSYCH
cohort (4,584 cases and 19,225 controls) and ANGST cohorts (12,665 cases and 14,745
controls). We used the anxiety and ASRD summary statistics we had thus generated for our
MR analyses.18

COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (https://www.covid19hg.org/results/) containing several
COVID-19 phenotypes. This GWAS was based on a study population drawn from multiple
cohorts, with European being the dominant ancestry: BioMe, FinnGen, Genes & Health,
LifeLines Global Screening Array, LifeLines CytoSNP, Netherlands Twin Register, Partners
Healthcare Biobank, and UKBB (Table 2; Supplementary Table 1). The majority of the

of individual studies had been performed with inverse variance weighting by the authors of
the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. To avoid that sample overlap between exposures’ and
outcomes’ datasets impacted results substantially by inducing instrument bias in MR analyses,
we only included COVID-19 summary statistics that had excluded the 23andme cohort. We
divided the COVID-19 phenotypes (A-D, Table 2) into two categories, COVID-19
susceptibility and severity. We used two phenotypes to index COVID-19 susceptibility,
namely C (defined by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative as partial susceptibility) and D
(self-reported COVID-19). Similarly, we used A (very severe respiratory confirmed COVID19, here: ‘very severe COVID-19’) and B (hospitalized lab confirmed COVID-19, here
‘severe COVID-19’) to index COVID-19 severity.

MR analyses
Data were analyzed between November, 2020, and January, 2021. As our main analysis, we

exposures, we first selected all relevant single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified in each
GWASs as having reached a selection P-value threshold < 5 × 10−8 and being non-duplicate
and uncorrelated (10 000 kilobase pairs apart and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) R2 ≤.001).
Instrument outliers were identified using HEIDI-outlier test (p <0.01), with the minimum
number of instruments required for the GSMR analysis (nsnps_thresh) = 2. In harmonizing
exposure and outcome data we removed palindromic SNVs with intermediate allele
frequencies, and SNVs with minor-allele frequency (MAF) differences > 0.2 between
exposure GWASs and outcome GWASs. We estimated the F-statistic from first-stage
regression to evaluate instrument strength, which is defined as the ratio of the mean square of
the model to the mean square of the error. The rule of thumb is that a threshold of F < 10
indicates weak instrument strength22.
To interpret our results, we advise readers to take into account effect sizes and not focus on pvalues. As a cut-off for statistical significance, we Bonferroni corrected two-sided p<0.05 for
the number of tests performed in all analyses, i.e. univariable forward (n=35;), univariable
reverse MR (n=16), and multivariable forward and reverse (see results section).
Then, Bonferroni-corrected significant results from GSMR were validated by applying as
sensitivity analyses several alternative MR models, namely fixed-effect inverse variance–
weighted (IVW), MR-Egger 23, weighted median-based regression methods 24, and MRPRESSO 25 that depend on different assumptions. The harmonized input data from GSMR
were used to perform by “TwoSampleMR” R packages 26. For significant results, we used the
MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran Q heterogeneity test, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and
outlier (MR-PRESSO) test to evaluate potential inverse variance (IV) violations, and
Causal Analysis Using Summary Effect estimates (CAUSE) 27 to estimate horizontal
pleiotropy. We also performed leave-one-out analyses to examine whether any high-impact
instruments possibly influenced MR results disproportionally.

At last, we conducted multivariable MR(MVMR) analyses 28 using the
MendelianRandomization R package to examine which phenotypes remained risk factors
taking into account pleiotropic effects among exposures. MVRM estimates the effects of each
exposure on an outcome adjusting for genetic associations between multiple phenotypes and
the exposure. Scenarios one may think of are when a researcher hypothesizes that exposures
are related to one another or when one exposure may mediate the relationship between the
exposure of interest and an outcome29. MVMR does so by using genetic instruments (derived
from either summary-level or individual-level data) associated with each of those multiple
phenotypes. MVMR is an extension of MR that may prove more useful and reliable in
scenarios where three or more exposures may be at play. Examples for the field of psychiatry
include MVMR analyses for self-harm30 and schizophrenia9. We thus considered MVMR a
useful method to follow up and corroborate our initial findings. For MVMR analyses, we
constructed instruments using SNVs in each of the GWASs meeting our single-variable MR
selection criteria, as described above. We used the MVMR extension of the inverse-variance
weighted MR method and MR-Egger method to correct for measured and unmeasured
pleiotropy. In forward MVMR, we used as exposures SCZ, BIP and AD, while A1, A2, B1,
B2, C1, C2, and D1 COVID-19 phenotypes (Table 1) were the outcomes. We excluded the
following (neuro)psychiatric diseases as exposures in forward MVMR: BIP-SCZ 16 as it was
highly correlated with SCZ and BIP (with most of the SNVs overlapping with either SCZ or
BIP); MDD 13 as it did not have enough SNV information (summary statistics containing only
10,000 independent SNPs due to participants consent); anxiety and ASRD 11,12 as they did not
have enough instrument variables, i.e. <2. In reverse MVMR analyses, we used the three
COVID-19 A2, B2 and C2 phenotypes (Table 2) as exposures since they had the required
number of ≥2 genome-wide significant loci, while outcomes were ASRD, AD, anxiety, BIP,
SCZ, and BIP-SCZ. We removed duplicate and correlated SNVs (within 10 000 kilobase

pairs; LD R2 ≥0.001), resulting in 8 SNPs as COVID-19 instruments and 119 SNPs as
(neuro)psychiatric instruments. Statistical significance for MVMR was Bonferroni-corrected
for the number of outcomes (see results section). In the end, genetic heritability and genetic
correlations between the neuro(psychiatric) disorders, BMI and COVID-19 phenotypes were
estimated using LD Score Regression (LDSC) 31.

Sensitivity analyses
To corroborate the robustness and consistency of our findings, we performed two sensitivity
analyses. First, we used a more lenient threshold of (P < 1 × 10−7) for genetic instruments as
a few SNPs passed conventional genome-wide significant level (P < 5 X 10-8), only
explaining a small amount of the variance in the complex trait, which in turn may increase
chances of type-2 error in MR. This method of relaxing the statistical threshold for genetic
instruments has been used in psychiatric MR research when few significant SNPs were
available 32-34.
Second, we performed MV-MR with more exposures since conditions such as obesity,
diabetes and heart diseases may increase the severity of COVID-19 and these and others (e.g.
educational attainment and cognitive performance) may be associated with (neuro)psychiatric
phenotypes. To that end, we ran univariable MR analyses for COVID-19 outcomes as
discussed above using the largest GWAS summary statistics for Body mass index (BMI) 35 ,
type 2 diabetes (T2D) 18, Coronary artery disease (CAD) 36, Educational attainment (EA) and
Cognitive performance (CP) 37, and Cross-disorder psychiatric disorders (CDG, a combined
GWAS of 8 psychiatric phenotypes; here CDG can be used as for COVID-19 datasets UKB
and 23andme sections had been excluded; Supplementary Table 2) 38. Then the
abovementioned conditions along with the phenotypes mentioned in Table 2 were entered into
multivariable MR analysis as exposures. To avoid sample overlap influencing our results, we

conducted MR using COVID-19 round 5 summary statistics which excluded both UK
Biobank and 23andme cohorts; namely A2, B1, B2, C2. For (neuro)psychiatric disorders, we
replaced the summary statistics containing UK biobank participants with MDD39 and ASRD40

Results
Overview
Five neuropsychiatric disorders (numbers of instruments: AD = 32, BIP = 6, MDD =5, SCZ =
137 and BIP-SCZ = 96; total study populations: AD = 63,926; BIP = 198,882; MDD =
307,354; SCZ = 105,318; and BIP-SCZ = 107,620) had enough (≥2) genome-wide loci to
perform forward MR analyses (Table 1) on the seven COVID-19 phenotypes defined in
Table 2. Conversely, three COVID-19 phenotypes (numbers of instruments: A2 = 8, B2 = 7
and C2 = 3; total study populations: A2 = 1,308,275, B2 = 969,689, C2 = 1,388,510; Table 2)
had enough genome-wide loci to perform reverse MR analyses. As the instrument strength
was strong (F-statistic in forward and reverse MR analyses ranging from 36.2 to 69.5), we did
not find evidence of weak instrument bias.

Forward MR results of (neuro)psychiatric disorders as potential risk factors for
COVID-19 phenotypes
We performed 35 univariable MR tests to examine the potential effects on COVID-19 of
genetic liabilities to 5 psychiatric phenotypes with at least 2 significant loci identified. We
thus Bonferroni corrected the significance threshold to 0.05/35 = 0.0014. Single-variable
GSMR analysis showed that the top MR result was BIP-SCZ (combined GWAS of bipolar
disorder and schizophrenia as cases vs. controls): the effect estimate was consistent with
increased COVID-19 susceptibility (D1; N=96 instruments; OR, 1.165, 95% CI, 1.0621.277; P = 0.0012; Figure 1). All four sensitivity MR analyses confirmed the direction of
effect detected by GSMR (Table 3). IVW, weighted median and MR-PRESSO also showed
similar p-values to GSMR (Table 3). Although MR Egger was not significant (p= 0.247),
overall horizontal pleiotropic effects were absent (for intercept of MR Egger: b= 0.015, p =
0.293). The I2GX statistics (I2GX =1.07%) of MR Egger were substantially smaller than 90%,

suggesting substantial bias in the causal estimates due to uncertainty in the genetic
associations, resulting in MR-Egger results not being reliable. The Cochran’s Q test in the
fixed-effect IVW model (Q statistic = 9.395, p = 0.152) and MR Egger model (Q statistic =
7.278, p = 0.2) suggested that there was absence of heterogeneity in the instrumental
variables, which may be the result of true causality rather than violation of instrument
variable assumptions. Furthermore, the leave-one-out analysis (Figure 2A) showed that no
SNVs altered the pooled IVW beta coefficient, confirming the stability of our results. We also
found absence of directional pleiotropy and the instrument strength independent of direct
effect (InSIDE) assumption to be satisfied (Figure 2B)23. As we found a genetic correlation
between BPSCZ and D1 (rg = 0.26, SE=0.12, p=0.012), horizontal pleiotropy may influence
causality effects. Using CAUSE to estimate causal effects and potentially horizontal
pleiotropic effects, no significant causal effects (g = 0.04, 95% CI=-0.03- 0.11) or horizontally
pleiotropic effects (h = 0.1 95% CI=-0.79 -1.07) were identified. When comparing the sharing
and causal models, the D ELPD > 0 (D ELPD = 0.022; SE = 0.835; P = 0.51), indicating the
posteriors from the causal model predict the data better, so the causal model may be a better
fit (Supplementary Figure 2).
At a nominally significant p-value threshold (p<0.05), we detected causal effects of genetic
liability to SCZ on very severe COVID (A2) and COVID-19 susceptibility (D1), of genetic
liability to BIP on severe and very severe COVID-19 (A1 and B2), and of genetic liability to
AD on COVID-19 susceptibility (C1 and D1, Supplementary table 3A). In line with the
significant GSMR finding for BIP-SCZ, all of these nominally significant results had positive
odds ratios for (neuro)psychiatric disorders on COVID-19 phenotypes (Supplementary table
3A; see Supplementary Table 3B for sensitivity analysis and Supplementary Table 4 for
reverse results). The other 4 MR models’ results were consistent with the GSMR findings
(Supplementary Table 5). Sensitivity analyses using p-value <10-7 to select more genetic

Reverse MR results of COVID-19 phenotypes as potential risk factors of
neuropsychiatric disorders
Three COVID-19 phenotypes met our predefined cut-off for inclusion as exposures, i.e.
GWASs with ≥2 genome-wide significant hits, in univariable MR analysis, namely severe and
very severe COVID-19 (A2, B2) as well as COVID-19 susceptibility (C2, Table 2). MDD did
not have enough overlapping SNPs to extract ≥2 instrument variables, resulting in 18 tests
performed in reverse analyses (6 for A2, B2 and C2; Table 2; and Supplementary Table
4A). The p-value cut-off for significance was thus Bonferroni corrected to 0.05/18 < 0.0028.
We found no results withstanding this multiple testing correction. Among most significant
results were: genetic liability to very severe COVID-19 (A2) increasing risk of BIP-SCZ
(GSMR OR, 1.036, 95% CI, 1.002-1.071; p = 0.04) and of SCZ (GSMR OR, 1.037, 95% CI,
1.001-1.073; p = 0.042; Supplementary Table 4A). The other 4 MR models’ results were in
line with the GSMR results (Supplementary Table 5). Sensitivity analyses using p-value
<10-7 to select more genetic instruments also yielded consistent results (Supplementary table
4B).

Multivariable MR analyses
In forward MVMR, we examined the potential effects of genetic liabilities to three
(neuro)psychiatric phenotypes jointly (AD, BIP, and SCZ; see methods) on seven COVID-19
phenotypes, resulting in a Bonferroni corrected (for the number of exposures) significance
threshold of p < 0.05 / 7 = 0.0071 (Supplementary Table 6A). No (neuro)psychiatric
disorder showed a robust relationship with COVID-19 in MV-MR-IVW models. Genetic
liability to AD, BIP and SCZ showed a nominally significant causal relationship with
COVID-19. However, the estimates were not consistent with estimates from the MVMREgger sensitivity analysis, where no p-values were < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 6A).

For reverse multivariable MR analyses examining the potential effects of genetic liabilities to
three COVID-19 phenotypes jointly (A2, B2 and C2, i.e. GWASs with ≥2 genome-wide
significant hits) on (neuro)psychiatric phenotypes, no COVID-19 phenotypes showed a causal
relationship with any of neuropsychiatric disorders at a Bonferroni-corrected or nominal
significance level in both IVW and MR-Egger (Supplementary Table 6B). The estimates
were consistent with estimates from the MVMR-Egger sensitivity analyses (Supplementary
Table 6B).
In sensitivity analysis #2 using univariable GSMR analyses we found BMI, EA, CP ad CAD
had causal effects on COVID-19 sub phenotypes (Supplementary Table 7). When adding all
conditions (namely BMI, EA, CP, MDD, BIPSCZ, CAD, CDG, BIP, SCZ, AD and T2D) into
MV-MR models, causal effects were observed only between BMI and COVID-19 phenotypes
(A2, B2 and C2). MV-MR-IVW model results were consistent with MV-MR-Egger, meaning
no neuropsychiatric disorder showed a robust relationship with COVID-19 in these MV-MR
models (Supplementary Table 8).
In the end, we estimated genetic heritability and genetic correlations between
(neuro)psychiatric phenotypes, COVID-19 (Table 1) and BMI. We show these in
Supplementary Table 9. For (neuro)psychiatric phenotypes we found only nominally
significant (p<0.05) genetic correlations. At a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold
(0.05/61=0.00082) we found only significant correlations between BMI and COVID-19
phenotypes. In addition, the LDSC intercepts were close to 0, further confirming absence of
substantial sample overlap between GWASs in this MR study.

Discussion
We evaluated potential bidirectional associations between (neuro)psychiatric diseases and
COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. While our univariable GSMR results hint that genetic
liability to a combined phenotype of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia could slightly
increase susceptibility to COVID-19, other methods including MVMR did not confirm this
finding.
Our findings of no consistently increased risks of genetic liabilities to psychiatric disorders on
COVID-19 are consistent with recent epidemiological observations in the UK and South
Korea 1,4 but inconsistent with other reports 2,3,5. Similarly, contrary to one study 2, we found
no evidence of COVID-19 influencing risk of psychiatric disorders. Also in contrast to
previous studies, we found no evidence of certain psychiatric disorders increasing risk to
develop COVID-19, e.g. of anxiety disorders 3,5. As pointed out by the authors of such
studies, lack of repeated measures may have resulted in misclassification of important
covariates resulting in invalid correction for some covariates in one or more of those studies.
Moreover, residual confounding due to some unmeasured variables such as population
stratification may result in overestimations of effect sizes in observational studies.
Furthermore, BMI was either not included at all or not included as a continuous covariate in
studies reporting positive associations between psychiatric disorders and COVID-192,4. As
BMI may be the strongest risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility (as also confirmed here), it
is of interest to correct for BMI as a continuous trait in upcoming epidemiological studies of
COVID-19 and psychiatric disorders. Finally, our findings of mostly absent associations or in
the event of suggestive associations odds ratios slightly above 1 are in disagreement with
some observational studies but in line with MR studies of other COVID-19 risk factors6-8,41.
Strengths of our study include the integration of univariable and multivariable, bidirectional
MR analyses using many instrument variables drawn from large GWASs. We also included a

range of (neuro)psychiatric as well as COVID-19 phenotypes and validated our results across
available MR methods. Furthermore, verification of primary GSMR findings with other MR
methods helped elucidate consistency of findings. Finally, employing a multivariable in
addition to a univariable approach is a strength. However, our results should also be
interpreted in light of several limitations. First, a general concern in MR studies is risk of
sample overlap. We minimized chances of sample overlap between exposure datasets and
outcome datasets by excluding UKBB populations from (neuro)psychiatric GWASs and by
excluding 23andme cohorts from COVID-19 datasets. We confirmed the lack of substantial
sample overlap with LDSC intercepts. Nonetheless, cryptic relatedness and potential sample
overlap between exposure and outcome GWASs may result in some degree of instrument
bias. However, the F-statistics we found were all above 36, allaying major concerns about
weak instrument bias. Another limitation directly follows from the availability of GWAS
data. For some phenotypes, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and anorexia nervosa, no
large datasets excluding the UKBB were available at the time of analysis or writing. For
MDD and SCZ, summary statistics of larger GWASs may become available in the coming
year. Similarly, as COVID-19 GWAS sample sizes ramp up, statistical power in MR analysis
may increase. We encourage researchers to repeat MR analyses on other phenotypes and to
use such larger GWAS datasets once they become available. To that end, we have uploaded
our code to Github (see data availability section above). Possibly, increased statistical power
in GWASs of psychiatric phenotypes and COVID-19 will in future elucidate more genetic
associations and thus empower future MR analyses. On a similar note, non-whites are
underrepresented in GWASs. As individuals of Asian and African ancestries seem
particularly prone to develop COVID-19 42, we hope future GWAS encompassing multiethnic cohorts will allow for more inclusive MR analyses. Finally, inherent in a design where

univariable as well as multivariable, bidirectional analyses are performed, a large number of
statistical tests is performed, increasing the multiple-testing burden and statistical penalty.
In conclusion, while genetic liability to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia combined slightly
increased COVID-19 susceptibility in univariable GSMR analysis, other MR methods and
multivariable analyses could only confirm genetic underpinnings of BMI to be causally
implicated in COVID-19 susceptibility. Thus, using MR we found no consistent proof of
genetic liabilities to (neuro)psychiatric disorders contributing to COVID-19 liability or vice
versa, which is in line with at least two observational studies. As BMI is strongly associated
with psychiatric disorders as well as COVID-19, previously reported positive associations
between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 may have resulted from statistical models
incompletely capturing BMI as a continuous covariate.
