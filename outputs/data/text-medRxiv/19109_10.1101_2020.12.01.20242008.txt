Abstract

22

The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 resulted in increasing demands for diagnostic tests,

23

leading to a shortage of recommended testing materials and reagents. This study reports on

24

the performance of self-sampled alternative swabbing material (ordinary Q-tips tested against

25

flocked swab and rayon swab), of reagents for classical RNA extraction (phenol/guanidine-

26

based protocol against a commercial kit), and of intercalating dye-based one-step quantitative

27

reverse transcription real-time PCRs (RT-qPCR) compared against the gold standard

28

hydrolysis probe-based assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The study found sampling with Q-

29

tips, RNA extraction with classical protocol and intercalating dye-based RT-qPCR as a

30

reliable and comparably sensitive strategy for detection of SARS-CoV-2 - particularly

31

valuable in the current period with a resurgent and dramatic increase in SARS-CoV-2

32

infections and growing shortage of diagnostic materials as well for regions limited in

33

resources.

Introduction

36

At the end of 2019, the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome

37

coronavirus 2) was discovered in Wuhan, China, causing the respiratory disease COVID-19.

38

The following outbreak, classified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a pandemic

39

situation on 11th March 2020, resulted in increasing demand for fast and reliable diagnostic

40

tests to identify infected individuals to prevent the spread of the virus (1, 2). Many health

41

institutions reported shortages of required materials for pharyngeal specimen collection,

42

sample extraction, and PCR materials. To ensure reliable diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2

43

infections in the event of a resurgence in infection rates, such as those currently observed in

44

Europe and North America in autumn/winter 2020/2021, suitable alternative materials need to

45

be urgently identified (1, 2).

46

Although rapid tests for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection are becoming available, reverse

47

transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) will remain the gold standard for

48

diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections due to excellent sensitivity. Until very recently, there

49

were only few approved materials, reagents, and procedures for SARS-CoV-2 molecular

50

diagnostics (3–5). Guidelines recommended the preferred use of flocked swabs stored in

51

transport medium over dry swabs collected by specialists (6) and listed only kit-based RNA

52

extraction methodologies followed by a hydrolysis probe-based RT-qPCR assay. These

53

materials and methods became the gold standard procedure for detection of SARS-CoV-2.

54

With the increasing demand for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests for people suspected of having

55

COVID-19 and population screenings, there is a continuing shortage of recommended swabs,

56

RNA extraction kits, and reagents for hydrolysis probe-based RT-qPCR. In addition, the

57

difficulty of providing rapid access and the high costs of recommended consumables pose a

58

barrier for wider application of this diagnostic method for low-resource countries. Therefore,

59

adaptation of diagnostic procedures to available and alternative reagents is necessary to

ensure continued reliable diagnosis. For this purpose, we tested self-sampled, ordinary cotton

61

swabs “Q-tips” as an alternative to medical swabs for oropharyngeal sampling, the classical

62

RNA extraction protocol, and a cost-saving intercalating dye-based RT-qPCR assay for the

63

detection of SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and Methods

66

Study participants

67

A total of 13 participants were enrolled in the study, seven individuals with acute SARS-CoV-

68

2 infection and six uninfected control individuals. Study participants were requested to sample

69

themselves and the procedure of oropharyngeal swabbing was explained to each participant.

70

Each participant was provided with two kits containing three different swab types each that

71

were collected by the study team within two hours after sampling. All individuals gave

72

written informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the

73

Universitätsklinikum Tübingen (Ref. number 20/231/B01).

74

Sample collection

75

Three different swab types were compared for their applicability to oropharyngeal sampling

76

and detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections: 1) Q-tips, these are ordinary cotton swabs with a

77

paper stick usually used for ear cleaning and available in local supermarkets, 2) flocked swab

78

embedded in 2 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution after sampling (COPAN FLOQswab 501CS01,

79

Copan, Italy), and 3) dry rayon swab (COPAN 155C Rayon, Copan, Italy). Swabs were kept

80

at 4oC until RNA extraction but no longer than 4 hours.

81

RNA extraction

82

Two different RNA extraction methodologies were compared for their efficiency in RNA

83

yield: a classical protocol using phenol/guanidine thiocyanate (QIAzol Lysis Reagent,

QIAGEN) for cell lysis and RNase inhibition, chloroform and isopropanol for RNA

85

purification and precipitation, respectively, following manufacturer’s protocol (7), and the

86

commercial kit QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN). To start the RNA extraction, the

87

complete cotton material of Q-tips and rayon swabs was cut and either immersed in 1 ml

88

QIAzol or 560 µl AVL buffer containing carrier RNA when utilizing QIAamp Viral RNA

89

Mini kit and kept for 10 minutes at room temperature before continuing with the respective

90

protocols. Flocked swabs were stored in 2 ml saline after sampling, 140 µl of this solution

91

was used for RNA extraction for each one of the two extraction methodologies. Total RNA

92

was eluted with 60 µl nuclease-free water for the classical extraction or elution buffer

93

provided by the kit. RNA concentration and quality per extraction were measured using

94

NanoDrop 1000 (NanoDrop Technologies).

95

Endogenous human control

96

Detection of human RNAse P (hRNAse P) RNA in swab material can serve as an endogenous

97

control, to ensure sample integrity and proper RNA extraction as suggested by the CDC (5).

98

Here, we used hRNAse P one-step reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-

99

qPCR) (Table 1) to ensure proper sampling and RNA extraction when using different swab

100

types and to evaluate RNA extraction protocols using samples from SARS-CoV-2 non-

101

infected participants. Synthetic hRNAse P RNA was used for the standard curves and as

102

positive control.

103

SARS-CoV-2 assays

104

For SARS-CoV-2 detection, the protocols for hydrolysis probe-based, one-step, reverse

105

transcription quantitative real-time PCR (probe RT-qPCR) from the Institute of Virology,

106

Charité, Berlin, Germany, targeting the envelope (E) and the RNA dependent RNA

107

polymerase (RdRp) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were utilized (8). These protocols were further

108

modified to establish intercalating dye-based, one-step, reverse transcription quantitative real5

time PCR (SYBR RT-qPCR). Assays are detailed in Table 1. The prediction of the melting

110

temperature (Tm) was performed in silico using the software uMELT Quartz (https://dna-

111

utah.org/umelt/quartz/) (9). To establish the SYBR RT-qPCR, different primer concentrations

112

(for E gene) and annealing temperatures (58oC as described at the original protocol and 60oC

113

for all genes) were tested (Table 2). Synthetic RNA fragments from SARS-CoV-2 target

114

genes were used as positive controls and for the generation of the standard curves for all

115

assays.

117

Results

118

To provide alternatives for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections during material

119

shortages, we compared the following: ordinary cotton swab “Q-tips” available in

120

supermarkets against medical swabs, a classical (phenol/guanidine-based) protocol for RNA

121

extraction against the commercially available kit for viral RNA extraction, and a cost-saving

122

intercalating dye-based one-step, reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (SYBR RT-

123

qPCR) protocol against the gold standard hydrolysis probe-based one-step, reverse

124

transcription quantitative real-time PCR (probe RT-qPCR) for detection of SARS-CoV-2.

125

These alternative options could also be beneficial for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in laboratories

126

in low-resource settings.

127

Comparison of swab types and RNA extraction methods

128

Participants self-sampled themselves using two sets of three different swab types (2x Q-tips,

129

2x flocked swabs, 2x rayon swabs) and RNA was extracted from each swab type either by

130

using the classical protocol or the commercial kit. Of each swab type, the same quantity of

131

input material was used for respective RNA extraction. To evaluate the applicability of these

132

alternative swabs as options for self-sampling, the housekeeping gene hRNAse P was

133

quantified to serve as endogenous control by RT-qPCR. Of non-infected participants, Q-tips

134

swabs plus classical RNA extraction was as efficient for RNA recovery as the ones extracted

135

by kit, with a Ct of 29±0.7 and 29±1.7, respectively (Figure 1A). Of SARS-CoV-2 infected

136

participants, RNA recovery with Q-tips plus classical extraction was more efficient than the

137

kit-based RNA extraction (Ct: 25±1.4 vs 28±3.8) (Figure 1B). Overall, sampling with

138

ordinary Q-tips was as good as with medical swabs with rather slightly lower Ct values

139

(indicating more RNA recovery in the extraction). Likewise, the classical RNA extraction

140

protocol is at least as good as the commercial kit, when the control gene hRNAse P was

141

amplified. As expected, flocked swab samples resulted in higher Ct values reflecting less

142

recovery of RNA material compared to Q-tips and rayon swab. Flocked swabs are immersed

143

in saline solution after sampling and only a fraction (140 µl of 2000 µl) is used for RNA

144

extraction according to the standard protocol. This finding was consistent for sampling of

145

uninfected as well as for SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals (Figure 1A and 1B).

146

Establishment of an intercalating dye-based RT-qPCR for SARS-COV-2 detection

147

Next, we simplified the available SARS-CoV-2 probe RT-qPCR protocol towards an

148

intercalating dye-based RT-qPCR (SYBR RT-qPCR) plus melting curve analysis as an

149

alternative to the costly probe RT-qPCR assay. This was done first to detect the control gene

150

hRNAse P and then for the SARS-CoV-2 genes E and RdRp. Performance of the E gene

151

assay was more stable and more sensitive at a primer concentration of 400nM and the

152

annealing temperature set to 60oC than primers at 200mM and/or at 58oC temperature as in

153

the original protocol (Table 2). The RdRp gene assay also showed a better performance at

154

60oC (Table 2). In silico melting curve analysis predicted a melting temperature (Tm) of

155

85±0.43oC for hRNAse P, 81±0.43oC for E gene, and 80.5±0.43oC for RdRp. The hRNAse P,

156

E, and RdRp genes assays presented a specific melting peak at 84.5 oC, 80.6 oC, and 81.1 oC,

157

respectively. A few negative samples showed a unique unspecific melting peak at 75.9oC in

158

the E gene assay that could be differentiated from the specific one.

159

When comparing the SYBR RT-qPCR to probe RT-qPCR, hRNAse P (LOD: 10 copies for

160

both) and E gene (LOD: 5 copies for both) assays showed similar performance, while the

161

RdRp gene assay using SYBR RT-qPCR was less sensitive compared to the probe RT-qPCR

162

(LOD 100 vs. 10 copies) (Figure 2).

163

Hydrolysis probe-based RT-qPCR assay

164

All target genes were consistently detected from swabs of all types (Figure 3). Considering

165

the type of swab and the number of target gene copies, RNA recovered from Q-tips was

166

similarly high as from rayon swabs (Q-tips: hRNAse P: 4.2±1.1 log copies, E: 5.1±1.1, and

167

RdRp: 2.7±0.4 versus rayon swab: hRNAse P: 4.2±0.5 log copies, E: 5.2±0.7, and RdRp:

168

2.9±0.6). In contrast, flocked swab (hRNAse P: 3±0.9 log copies, E: 4.5±0.6, and RdRp:

169

2.1±0.8) was less suitable for cellular sampling and RNA yield (Figure 3).

170
171

SYBR RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection as an alternative to probe RT-qPCR

172

Paired samples tested with both intercalating dye-based and probe-based assays showed a

173

mean variance in the Ct values of 0.1 cycle for hRNAse P, 0.4 cycle for E gene, and 2.2

174

cycles for RdRp. The RdRp gene assay using intercalating dye presented earlier Ct values

175

when compared to the probe-based. The intercalating dye-based assay failed in detecting one

176

sample for both E gene (probe-based Ct value: 32.8) and RdRp gene (probe-based Ct value:

177

31.6) assays. Despite those failures, both intercalating assays could detect even later Ct values

178

of other samples (the latest Ct value detected in field samples was 35.22 for E gene and 34.97

179

for the RdRp gene). Interestingly, both samples were extracted using the classical method.

180

Regarding the log of gene copies compared to hydrolysis probe-based assays, the hRNAse P

181

intercalating dye-based assay presented lower values when using rayon swab and Q-tips (R:

182

3.0±0.4 vs. 4.2±0.5 and Qt: 3.0±0.8 vs. 4.2±1.1) and equivalent results when using flocked

183

swab+saline (2.1±0.8 vs. 2.1±0.5); E gene intercalating dye-based assay presented lower

184

values when using rayon swab and flocked swab+saline (R: 4.6±1.3 vs. 5.2±0.7 and FS:

185

3.6±1.6 vs. 4.5±0.6) and equivalent results when using Q-tips (5.3±0.3 vs. 5.1±0.3); and

Discussion

190

The current pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 rapid spread demands more testing and there

191

is an urgent need for alternative but reliable materials for diagnosis. With a continuous global

192

public health emergency state, it is predicted that several million people will become infected

193

in the upcoming months of 2020/2021 (10, 11). Thus, reliable and accessible materials,

194

reagents, and methods for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections are of paramount importance.

195

Here, we compared the performance of ordinary Q-tips commonly available at supermarkets

196

against medical flocked swabs and rayon swabs, a classical protocol for RNA extraction

197

against a commercial kit and established a cost-efficient intercalating dye-based RT-qPCR for

198

detection of SARS-CoV-2. This approach is not only urgently needed, it is also helpful to

199

regions which suffer from limited financial resources. Overall, the performance of self-

200

sampled oropharyngeal Q-tips, the phenol/guanidine-based (classical) protocol for RNA

201

extraction, and the intercalating dye-based RT-qPCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic

202

material was - individually as well as in combination – as reliable and sensitive as their

203

respective comparators recommended by the authorities.

204

Here we also report the convenience and feasibility of swab self-sampling, the SARS-CoV-2

205

infected participants received kits with swabs, sampled themselves, and called the study team

206

to collect them, reducing the SARS-CoV-2 spread and the study team exposure. In addition to

207

this, in a pandemic scenario, self-sampling can also improve the mass screening participation,

208

reduce the medical staff workload, and keep the clinics, hospitals, and even emergency rooms

209

dedicated to the ones really in need of medical care. Also, in places with limited access to

210

medical care, self-sampling with Q-tips swabs (available at the supermarket) that can be

211

further collected may be an interesting option.

212

In all RT-qPCR assays either detecting hRNase P, which served as an endogenous control for

213

sample integrity and proper RNA extraction, Ct values obtained for samples taken by Q-tips

214

were similar to those obtained by rayon swab, while samples taken by flocked swab showed

215

fewer copies. As recommended, flocked swabs are stored in 2 ml of saline after sampling and

216

only 1/14 of the volume is used in the subsequent RT-qPCR assay. The reduced sensitivity is

217

an obvious consequence of the reduced fraction tested.

218

The classical procedure for RNA extraction, done before the introduction of commercial kits

219

became widely available, requires multiple handling steps including cell lyses using

220

phenol/guanidine (or a commercially available solution such as QIAzol used here), phase

221

separation with chloroform and RNA precipitation with isopropanol. This resulted into yields

222

and qualities of extracted RNA that did not differ in Ct outputs of RT-qPCR amplification

223

compared to RNA extracted with commercial kits with simplified and standardized pipetting

224

steps. Interestingly, despite the fact that the used commercial kit is designed to isolate mainly

225

viral RNA (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Handbook), this did not result into lower Ct values of

226

SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR and thus more starting copies compared to the classical protocol

227

which extracts human and viral RNAs.

228

In contrast to hydrolysis probe-based RT-qPCR, intercalating dye-based assays do not depend

229

on modified oligonucleotides where special manufacturing and supply can be critical in the

230

current times. Intercalating dye-based RT-qPCR protocols have occasionally been used for

231

SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Here, we expanded the available Charité protocol (8) towards a

232

SYBR one-step RT-qPCR protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection. In silico analysis of the

233

primers and melting temperature peaks showed specificity and feasibility. The assay

234

performance was sensitive and robust after increasing the annealing temperature from 58°C to

10

235

60°C compared to the probe-based protocol. The intercalating dye-based assays for hRNAse

236

P and E genes were as sensitive as the hydrolysis probe-based assays, but the RdRp gene

237

showed ten times less sensitivity. Dorlass and collaborators (12) also reported good

238

performance of E gene primers published by Corman et al. (8) using intercalating dye-based

239

assays in nasopharyngeal swabs collected in hospitals when compared to probe-based assay.

240

Only one SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR positive individual who was positive for RNAse P by

241

SYBR RT-qPCR was not positive for the E and RdRp genes when material from Q-tips plus

242

classical RNA extraction was tested. In addition, one sample was not positive for the RdRp

243

SYBR RT-qPCR assay despite the other two assays were successful. Thus, the intercalating

244

dye-based RT-qPCR is a promising alternative for SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis.

245

In pandemic scenarios, a shortage of recommended materials for molecular diagnostics can

246

limit the identification of infected individuals which may have a negative impact on the

247

efficiency of isolation measures and contributes to the spread of the virus. Moreover, the costs

248

of the recommended materials often cannot be afforded by low-resource settings. Here, we

249

showed that Q-tips available at very low costs in local supermarkets can be used for

250

oropharyngeal self-sampling, RNA can be extracted with a classical (phenol-guanidine-based)

251

protocol, and intercalating dye-based RT-qPCR is a valuable and sensitive diagnostic test

252

reliably detecting SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.
