Abstract

26

Background: In January 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started to spread in

27

Italy. The Italian government adopted urgent measures to hold its spread. Enforcing compliance to

28

such measures is crucial in order to enhance their effectiveness. Engaging citizens in the COVID-

29

19 preventive process is today urgent in Italy and around the world. However, to the best of our

30

knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the role of health engagement in predicting

31

citizens’ compliance to health emergency containment measures.

32

Method: An online survey was administered between February 28th and March 4th 2020 on a

33

representative sample of 1000 Italians. The questionnaire included a measure of Health

34

Engagement (PHE-S) and a series of ad hoc items intended to measure both affective and

35

behavioral responses of the citizens to the emergency in terms of perceived susceptibility to and

36

severity of the disease, orientation towards health management, change in habits and in

37

purchases. To investigate the relationship between Health Engagement and these variables, a

38

series of ANOVAs, Logistic regressions and crosstabs have been carried out.

39

Results: Less engaged people show higher levels of perceived susceptibility to the virus and of

40

severity of the disease; they trust less scientific and healthcare authorities, they feel less self-

41

effective in managing their own health - both in normal conditions and under stress - and are less

42

prone to cooperate with healthcare professionals. Low levels of Health Engagement are also

43

associated with a change in the usual purchase behavior.

44

Conclusions: The Patient Health Engagement Model (PHE) provides a useful framework for

45

understanding how people will respond to health threats such as pandemics. Therefore,

46

intervention studies should focus on particular groups and on raising their levels of engagement to

47

increase the effectiveness of educational initiatives devoted to promote preventive behaviors.

1. Background

50

In January 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory

51

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started to spread in Italy. As of March 17th, 2020, a total of

52

31.506 COVID-19 cases with 2.503 deaths and 2.941 recovered had been reported in Italy. On Jan

53

30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health

54

emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Since March 8th, 2020, the Italian government

55

adopted very urgent and restrictive measures to hold the virus spread and its potential impact on

56

the population. Several cities - identified as “red areas” - have been put under quarantine, hoping

57

to stop the disease from spreading to other parts of the country. This situation is globally

58

unprecedented at least for two main reasons. First, to control of the COVID-19 outbreak, the

59

governmental authorities have suddenly adopted very extreme public measure such as locking

60

down cities, deeply reorganizing healthcare services to cope with the rapid increasing demand for

61

acute care, imposing school and university closure, suggesting - where possible - smart-working

62

solutions and transportation restrictions, deploying thousands of healthcare workers to more

63

heavily affected regions, and running wide public health messaging campaigns for consumers’

64

education. Second, consumers are overwhelmed by rather mixed and confounding information,

65

partly because scientific discovery related to COVID-19 is constantly evolving with the course of

66

the disease outbreak, partly due to the rapid increase in misleading or false news. Therefore, all

67

these measures are currently having a deep impact on Italian people’s attitudes, daily habits and

68

consumer behaviors.

69

Like in other similar situations, prior to the availability of an effective vaccination therapy, strategies

70

to mitigate and control the impact of the pandemic typically involve “non pharmacological”

71

interventions (1,2), and lever on citizens autonomous responses to public health preventive

72

measures. In particular, past literature suggested as people appear to respond to an epidemic by

73

voluntarily undertaking specific behaviors in order to protect themselves (3,4). However, in some

74

cases, these behaviors may not correspond to an objective evaluations of risk (5,6), but depend

75

also on individual subjective evaluations, thus becoming potentially counterproductive. For this

76

reason, there has been a rapid rise in interest in understanding the determinants of people’s

77

behavioral change that may influence the adequacy of the response to health emergencies (7,8).

78

People dealing with these situations, indeed, may experience negative attitude, feelings of

79

uncertainties and alarmism (9). These reactions might potentially end in risky habits and

80

inadequate and disorganized behaviors, both for individuals and community (10,11), affecting

81

public health outcomes. Therefore, to study the subjective factors implied in such reactions is of

82

much relevance for effectively sensitize the general public and identify high-risk targets (12). Along

83

with structural and immutable factors such as socio-demographics, scholars have previously

84

attempted to understand the subjective determinants of citizens’ changing attitudes and behaviors

85

in a pandemic emergency. In particular, authors identified the risk perception as one of the most

86

relevant variable in determining citizens’ response to global pandemic disease (13,14), in relation

87

to a series of factors such as the perception of economic impact (15); efficacy believes related to

88

health (16); level of literacy and knowledge elaboration (17,18). Another important factor identified

89

is the level of subjective anxiety, which influences both citizens’ attitudes towards the emergency

90

disease and consequent preventive behaviors (19–21). Other subjective factors accounted for the

91

change peoples’ habits in pandemic emergencies are also the ones related to the perceived effect

92

of one individual behavior, such as perceived costs and benefits of preventive behaviors on the

93

disease spread (22,23) or perceived impact of an individual's behavior on other individual's

94

outcomes (21,24).

95

Among other variables accounting for a change in citizens’ attitudes, habits and behaviors, recently

96

scholars have showed the role of health engagement in affecting health-related behaviors and

97

preventive habits (25–28). More in details, people with high levels of health engagement have

98

been identified as more effective in adopting behavioral change suggestions and in adhere to

99

medical prescriptions (29–31). However, previous literature has also demonstrate how individuals

100

may be in different phases of their process of engagement (26,28), thus resulting more or less

101

ready to enact a change in their way to cope with a critical events and to comply to prescribed

102

preventive conducts.

103

In the current COVID-19 outbreak in Italy – as well as in other countries – citizens are

104

experimenting a life-threatening situation, leading to profound changes in attitudes, habits and

105

behaviors, also potentially negative for consumers’ health and virus containment. Making citizens

106

aware about their crucial role in avoiding the rapid spread of the virus and engaging them in the

107

COVID-19 preventive process is today urgent in Italy and around the world.

108

However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the role of people

109

health engagement in determining citizen attitudes, habits and compliance to containing measures

110

in the occasion of an health emergency; moreover, previous literature have highlighted the need to

111

apply a validated theoretical framework to the study of these phenomena in order to effectively

112

predict people responses to the event and adherence to prescriptions (8).

113

For these reasons, we propose a study aimed at understanding citizens’ attitudes and behavioral

114

responses to the current spread of COVID-19 in Italy and how they changed their daily habits and

115

behaviors according to their level of health engagement. Results of this study will contribute to

116

informing public health communication and targeted consumer educations activities.

117
118

1.1 Theoretical background

119

The Patient Health Engagement model (26,32) is a psychological framework which theorizes how

120

individual health engagement results from a continuous emotional and motivational reframing of

121

individuals own role perception in the management of a disease (i.e. from passive user of services

122

to active partner of the healthcare system). According to this model, to become engaged means to

123

be emotionally resilient and able to adjust to the health risks and specific requirements. This model

124

also features peculiar ways of coping with health crisis, as can be considered the Covid-19 today.

125

In particular, the model features four positions: the first position (“blackout”) is of complete

126

disengagement, typically occurring when people feel vulnerable and without control over the

127

perceived risk, psychologically frozen and behaviorally paralyzed.

128

position of “Arousal,” in which people have acquired an initial awareness about their actual

129

situation of health risk but don’t have still enough knowledge and skills to manage it. They do not

130

accept the impact of preventive requirements on the modification of their daily habits and appear

131

hyper-vigilant over their body signals, iperactive and confused when seeking information on the

132

health situation. Each unexpected news or change in the epidemic situation causes emotional alert

133

and overwhelming emotional responses, with disorganized actions and behaviors.

134

individuals succeed in the process of emotional regulation and coping with the stressful condition,

135

they achieve a position of Adhesion. In this phase, patients have matured a good psychological

136

adaptation to the critical situation and appear able to manage their psychological di-stress

preventive prescriptions.

139

managing their risk condition. Finally, when people mature a complete awareness of the

140

characteristics and consequences of the critical situation, and assume a better responsible position

141

in their behaviors and risk management they reach the “eudaimonic project” phase, which features

142

a better, positive and optimistic approach to the situation, with an increased ability to deal with the

143

uncertainty of the moment and a strong motivation to psychologically achieve the sense of a “new

normality” (Figure 1).

1.2 Research questions

150

The study has the general aim to seek to explore how different levels of Health Engagement

151

correspond to unique patterns of people reactions to the COVID-19 health emergency.

In particular, the study was guided by two main hypotheses:

1. Individuals with different levels of Health Engagement show different attitudinal responses
towards the emergency. In particular:
i. less engaged people perceive themselves more susceptible to the infection and
afraid by the contagion than people with a higher Health Engagement profile;
ii. different Health Engagement profiles show different attitudes to prevention and
health management and different levels of trust towards authorities, scientific
research and media during emergency periods;
2. Health Engagement is associated with changes in consumer behaviors and habits.

2. Methods

167

2.1 Study design and participants

168

To investigate our hypotheses, a cross-sectional study was carried out between February 28th and

169

March 4th 2020. A sample of 1000 Italians, representative of the Italian population for gender, age,

170

employment, geographical area and dimension of urban center of residence, resident in all the

171

different regions of Italy and over 18 years old was involved in the self-completion of a web

172

questionnaire. Individuals were randomly selected from the consumers panel managed by Norstat

173

srl (a company specialized in collecting data; (https://norstat.it/) using random digit dialing, to fill an

174

online survey. Eligibility criteria for being involved in the study were purposefully kept minimal to

175

make the results broadly applicable and only included being 18 years old or older, being able to

176

read and understand Italian and live in Italy. People belonging to the online panel were carefully

177

screened for authenticity and legitimacy via digital fingerprint and geo-IP-validation from the panel

178

provider. In this study, in order to guarantee data quality, respondents were asked to confirm their

179

demographics. From the 1000 recruited subjects, 32 were excluded because demographic data

180

provided by the respondent and those provided from the panel were inconsistent (there were

181

discrepancies between reported and known gender and/or age). Statistical analyses were hence

182

carried out on a dataset composed of the answers of 968 respondents. All analyses have been

183

carried out with IBM SPSS 23 (release 23.0.0.0).

Results from this study are intended to provide evidence-based information that furthers our

Health Engagement: participants were asked to fill a revised version of the Patient Health
Engagement Scale (PHE-s®). This measure, developed according to the Patient Health
Engagement model (32), assesses the consumers health engagement level, defined as the
“people psychological readiness and sense of mastery to become active player in their own
health management and health risk prevention”. Previous studies demonstrated its robust
psychometric proprieties (26). This scale features five ordinal items reflecting the continuum of
engagement described in the four levels of the PHE model. According to the ordinal nature of
the PHE-s®, the median score is considered the more reliable index to calculate the final
patients’ scoring (26). According to the score obtained, each respondent result in one of the
four levels of health engagement as described in the PHE model (i.e. blackout, arousal,
adhesion, eudaimonic project). The scale is based on the assumption that the score obtained
by the person should reflect his/her actual health engagement level. For this study purposes
the PHE- s® was slightly revised in order to adapt the items formulation to the specific contest
of the health emergency. For this reason, the psychometric characteristics of the revised
version were tested.

•

Attitudinal response towards to the COVID-19 health emergency, involving:
o In light of studies on risk processing (33), two elements of risk judgment were
measured: (a) risk severity: perceived potential severity of COVID-19 infection for their
own health: participants answered a question regarding how concerned they are about
the emergency ranging from 1 (not concerned at all) to 10 (very concerned); and (b)
risk susceptibility: perceived likelihood to get COVID-19: participants were asked to
rate from 1 (very little) to 5 (a lot) their perceived risk of being infected by the new
COVID-19 virus;
o orientation towards health management: participants were asked a series of questions
regarding their ability to manage their own health autonomously. In particular, they
were asked how much they agreed to the following statements on a scale ranging
between 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree):
self-responsibility: “I am the responsible of diminishing my own risk of being
infected by the new COVID-19 virus”
self-efficacy in health management: “I can manage my own health effectively”
self-efficacy in stress management: “I can manage my own health even when
I’m distressed”

3. Results

value of partnership in healthcare: “it’s important to cooperate with healthcare
professionals in defining how to manage my own health”
trust in authorities: participants were asked a series of questions regarding their trust in
scientific research and the National Healthcare System. In particular, they were asked
how much they agreed to the following statements on a scale ranging between 1
(completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree):
Trust in science: “I fully trust scientific research”
Trust in NHS: “I fully trust the National Healthcare System”
media reliability: It is hypothesized that media tends to sensationalize food
safety hazards. Participants were asked to respond to the following question: “I
think that the emergency regarding Covid-19 has been created by an overblown
mass-media hype”

Behavioral responses involving:
o Information seeking: participants were asked how much they were accessing
information regarding COVID-19 on a series of both traditional and new medias (TV,
newspapers, social networks, scientific journals etc.). Each media was rated from 1
(little) to 5 (a lot). Scores were then summed and an average was calculated, in order
to obtain an indicator of how much a certain subject was searching for information
regarding the virus;
o Consumer habits and purchasing behaviors:
o A series of four dichotomous, yes/no questions were asked regarding changes
in consumer habits:
Reduced restaurant meals: “have you reduced meals in restaurants?”
Reduced ethnic restaurant meals: “have you reduced meals in ethnic
restaurants?”
Products from the “red zones”: “are you willing to buy food products
coming from “red” zones?”
Stockpiling: “have you -if you are the main responsible in food
provisioning in your family- been stockpiling food and first need
products?”
o Changes in purchasing behaviors were also assessed with a series of
questions surveying whether the buying of different products had
diminished/remained the same/increased. In particular, the purchase of the
following products was assessed:
Fresh food (veggies, fruit, meat…)
Frozen food
Canned food
Personal disinfection
Personal care
House disinfection
• Sociodemographic variables: a series of socio-demographical data were also
collected, including: age, gender, education and employment in order to characterize
our sample. Moreover, participants were also asked to state whether they suffer from
any chronical condition. Finally, participants were asked to state their region of
residency. People were considered as “Coming from the red zones” if they stated to
live in either Lombardia, Piemonte or Emilia-Romagna, Italian’s most involved regions
at the time of data collection.

To evaluate the psychometric properties of the revised PHE-s® scale, a Partial Credit Rasch
Model (PCM) was performed to check uni-dimensionality and the fit of each item at the construct of
interest. In particular, to check whether the items fitted the expected model, two items fit mean
square (MNSQ) statistics (Infit and Outfit) were computed. If the data fit the Rasch model, the fit
statistics should be between 0.6 and 1.4 (34). Analyses of difficulty and step parameters were
conducted to guarantee a sufficient ranking of the different categories of response and to respect
the monotonic order. The internal consistency of the items of the revised PHE-s® was assessed
using Ordinal Alpha via Empirical Copula Index (35) since the ordinal nature of the items. A
reliability index superior to 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 can be interpreted as acceptable, good and excellent,
respectively (36).

294
295
296
297

Finally, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was performed. Goodness-of-fit indexes (i.e.
comparative fit index CFI, root mean square residual RMR and root mean square error of
approximation RMSEA) were evaluated. A CFI > .90 was considered a good model fit (37), a RMR
<.05 is desirable (38), whereas a RMSEA < .08 indicated an acceptable fit (39).

The item statistics ranged from .674 to 1.085 for the infit MSQ and from .616 to 1.187 for the outfit
MSQ. These values indicate an acceptable fit of the Rasch Model. The distances between
subsequent thresholds showed acceptable distinction between the response options and
measurement model fit. The Person Separation Index (PSI) was calculated to evaluate the
reliability in the Rasch Model (PSI = .851). Rasch Model confirmed the unidimensionality of revised
PHE-s® scale and the fit of each item of the scale to the data.

The revised PHE-s® had a quite good internal consistency, since the value of the Ordinal Alpha
via Empirical Copula was equal to .788. Each item contributed significantly to the revised PHE-s®
scale score. So, the internal consistency of the revised PHE-s® was satisfactory.

312
313
314
315
316

CFA showed reasonable goodness of fit indices. The fit indices met the criteria of fit for the
hypothesized one-factor structure. All goodness of fit indices (CFI=0.994, RMR=0.008,
RMSEA=0.066) suggested that the model is coherent with the data. The analysis of modification
indices did not find any relation between the error covariance of the items. All the standardized to
factor loadings are ranged from .532 to .820.

3.3 Descriptive statistics

319

There were no missing data in our dataset. For dichotomous and multiple-choice questions,

320

answer frequencies and “I don’t know” answers are reported -where provided- in Table 3.

321

However, in the following analyses “I don’t know” were considered as missing values. For other

322

variables, descriptive statistics are reported in Table 4.

323

Since very few participants resulted being in “Blackout” position, they were grouped together with

324

participants in “Arousal” to facilitate statistical analyses.

352

themselves as more at risk than both the Adhesion group (M=2.94; SD=.92) and the Eudaimonic

353

Project group (M=1.97; SD=.906) with a significance of 99.9%. Also the means difference of

354

Adhesion and Eudaimonic Project groups was found to be statistically significant with p<.001.

355

3.4.3 Orientation towards health management and trust in authorities

356

A series of univariate Welch’s ANOVAs with Health Engagement as independent variable was

357

carried out followed by Games-Howell post-hoc comparisons to investigate the self-efficacy in

358

health management and different levels of trust in authorities across the Health Engagement

359

levels. Welch’s ANOVA and G-H post-hoc comparisons were preferred over a classic ANOVA

360

approach to provide a more robust method for data analysis (40) since some dependent variables

361

were violating the assumption of homoschedasticity.

362

Results show a significative main effect of Health Engagement on Self-Responsibility [F(2,

381

Results show a significant main effect of Health Engagement on Information Seeking [F(2,

382

334.095)=29.344;

383

different significantly among all the different levels: in particular, results showed that people in

384

Arousal search significantly more information (M=2.79; SD=.74) than both people in Adhesion

385

(M=2.47; SD=.68) and Eudaimonic project (M=2.20; SD=.77). The comparison amongst Adhesion

386

and Eudaimonic project resulted significantly different as well.

387

3.5.2 Consumer habits and purchasing behaviors

388

Dichotomous variables were used as dependent variables in a series of logistic regressions, in

389

order to understand whether the Health Engagement position is predictive of a change in

390

consumer habits. Risk Susceptibility and Risk Severity were also used as predictors. Wald forward

391

method was selected to automatically exclude non-significant predictors. Health Engagement was

392

used as a categorical variable and hence dummy coded: Eudaimonic Project was used as the 0,

393

the baseline of comparison, for the other two levels. Dependent variables were coded so that “No”

394

was used as the comparison level for “Yes”. Hence, an Odds Ration > 1 should be interpreted as

395

“more likely to answer yes” and vice-versa. Results are reported in Table 6. To assess the

396

association between change in consumer purchase behaviors and different Health Engagement

397

levels a series of contingency tables was created. Pearson’s Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests

398

were also carried out to reject the null hypothesis that data are randomly distributed across Health

399

Engagement levels. As post-hoc, standardized residuals were inspected: standardized residuals

400

are calculated as the difference between observed and expected counts of a cell divided by an

401

estimate of its standard deviation. Since they are asymptotically normally distributed with a mean

402

of 0 and standard deviation of 1 under the null hypothesis of independence, as a general rule of

403

thumb cells with an absolute value of standard residuals above 2 can be considered to significantly

404

contribute to the general chi-square value (41). For Stockpiling behavior groups were way too

405

unbalanced to proceed with a logistic regression (Yes=5.6%), hence an approach based on

406

contingency tables was preferred. Results are reported in Table 7.

4. Discussion

417

At the end of February 2020 the diffusion of the COVID-19 epidemics in northern Italy has forced

418

health authorities to embrace restrictive preventive measures that impacted on Italian citizens’ daily

419

habits and consumption behaviors. Enforcing compliance to such measures was crucial at that

420

time in order to enhance their effectiveness and to sustain the sustainability of the healthcare

421

system. However, this sudden change determined huge reactions by Italian citizens: many of them

422

experienced panic and enacted maladaptive behaviors. In this scenario, the Italian citizens’

21

423

reactions to the COVID-19 emergency measures, from the scientific perspective, is an interesting

424

and unique platform to demonstrate the value of making citizens engaged and actual partner of the

425

healthcare system to safeguard both individuals’ and collective health. Therefore, we consider the

426

current COVID-19 outbreak in Italy as a valuable “testing ground” for consumer education

427

initiatives aimed at sustaining their health engagement and compliance to the prescribed

428

behavioral changes.

429

Existing research has focused on demographic and immutable factors and subjective that influence

430

how people are likely to behave in a pandemic (42–44). Furthermore, previous research on

431

responses to pandemics has been largely a-theoretical (8). Therefore, all these studies provide

432

valuable insights into how different segment of the population are likely to respond, but does not

433

tell us why they respond in this way.

434

Therefore, the current study adopted the theoretical lenses of the Patient Health Engagement

435

Model to explain – from a psychosocial perspective - people responses through the first wave of

436

the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. This theory states that individuals are more or less akin to change

437

their behaviors according to their own subjective perceptions about the role (more or less active)

438

the might play in their health and care (32).

439

The Patient Health Engagement Model (PHE) provides a potentially useful framework for

440

understanding how people will respond to health threats such as pandemics and related prescribed

441

preventive measures imposed by healthcare authorities. The PHE model proposes that people’s

442

adaptive behavioral and emotional responses to protect themselves from a health threat is

443

influenced by the level of health engagement – that is a progressive reframing of individuals’ own

444

role within the healthcare system (i.e. from passive user of services to active partner of the

445

healthcare system) (32). In this study we employed and validated a revised version of the PHE-s®

446

to measure citizens’ health engagement. This revised version showed good psychometric

447

properties for our representative sample.

448

According to the study results, Italian citizens seems to be more concerned for the health

449

emergency than not, even though not extremely worried (on a scale from 1 to 10, the average is

22

450

around 6) and not feeling exceedingly at risk of being infected (the 5-point Likert shows a

451

normaloid distribution with mean around the central point), confirming previous studies in other

452

similar settings (6,45,46). Nevertheless, it is important to notice how different Health Engagement

453

profiles, are associated with different levels of both perceived risk severity and susceptibility:

454

indeed, less engaged people (rated as in “Blackout” and “Arousal”) show significantly higher levels

455

of perceived susceptibility to and perceived risk of the infection when compared with high engaged

456

ones (rated as in “Adhesion” and “Eudaimonic Project”), regardless of the geographical area of

457

origin (“red zone” or not), which surprisingly didn’t result to be associated with different levels of

458

susceptibility and severity. This seems to testify that people differ in their ability to psychologically

459

master their worries related to the COVID-19 epidemic, and this explains consequent more or less

460

adherence to the change in behaviors imposed by the health authorities. This interpretation is

461

confirmed also by the fact that people with different levels of Health Engagement show different

462

attitudinal responses to the emergency: in particular, when compared with people with higher

463

levels of health engagement, less engaged people are less trusting scientific and healthcare

464

authorities, they feel less self-effective in managing their own health - both in normal conditions

465

and under stress - and less prone to cooperate with healthcare professionals. These results are

466

confirmative of previous studies on Influenza A(H1N1) which demonstrated that if perceived

467

severity and susceptibility are high but response and self-efficacy are low, maladaptive responses

468

(e.g. denying the existence of a threat) are likely to ensue (47,48). The perceived self-efficacy in

469

health management and a sentiment of mistrust towards authorities may actually help in

470

understanding why a less engaged person feels more concerned and worried for the new COVID-

471

19 emergency: they seek more information, potentially exposing themselves to fake or over-hyped

472

news, since they are also prone to feel that news regarding the emergency are reliable;

473

nevertheless, they mistrust scientific research and the capacity of the NHS to cope with the

474

pandemic and feel less capable of taking care of themselves. Furthermore, low levels of Health

475

Engagement may testify that people do not consider themselves ready to be active partners of the

476

healthcare systems, being more focused on their own health interests and need and not incline to

477

collaborate and trust the healthcare system to achieve a common public health goal.

478

Health Engagement also seems to be a predictor of behavioral responses to the emergency.

479

Generally speaking, a substantial part of our sample reported a change in their habits: one out of

480

three Italian citizens reported to have reduced meals outside and/or meals in ethnic restaurants,

481

while 20% declared that they would not buy products coming from “red zones”. Indeed, while Risk

482

Severity and Risk Susceptibility are clearly strong predictors, logistic models show that people with

483

lower levels of Health Engagement have more than twice the chances than people with higher

484

level of health engagement to either have reduced meals or ethnic meals outside home. It’s

485

important to notice that data have been collected in a moment where the emergency was still away

486

from its peak and guidelines were not forbidding people from moving freely and have meals in

487

restaurants. These results could be interpreted in line with previous studies that underlined as

488

when unknown diseases are thought to be lethal, people are incline to blame the outbreaks on

489

someone, or some group of people, who live outside of their own social sphere, as a mechanism to

490

cope with fear and risk perception (49). In this research, it appears clear as this form of “moral

491

panic” (50) had an halo effect also on products and restaurants people naively thought to be guilty

492

in Covid-19’s spread, or that were related to the “infected zone”. Such lay interpretation of disease

493

transmission, together with the difficulty of finding reliable information in a first phase of health

494

emergency, has an impact on people’s habits and consumptions, and clear consequences on local

495

enterprises’ economy. A similar case occurred with the H5N1 Avian Influenza on food

496

consumption, when the poultry industry has suffered severe losses due to a sort of “halo effect” in

497

consumer perception of risk, even after the emergency (51,52).

498

Despite these results, for what concerns buying behaviors, our data show that generally most

499

people didn’t actually change their habits, in line with other studies (53): most people didn’t

500

stockpile goods nor increased the purchase of the goods we have considered in our survey.

501

Nevertheless, crosstabs show that amongst those who stockpiled goods and increased the

502

purchase of food (fresh, frozen or canned) and disinfection products (in particular regarding home

503

disinfection) there is a significantly higher presence of lower engaged consumers. This evidence in

504

line with other studies (54–56) that showed how personal reaction of the critical event can feed

505

behavioral changes, with many people enacting significant changes in their consumption behaviors

24

506

like anticipating the purchasing of goods (57,58). As food consumption is recognized as a primary

507

need for the individuals, it is strongly influenced by the subjective interpretation of risk and the

508

possible scarcity (59). For this reason, these results appear interesting in giving a sense to how

509

people orient their food purchase in the case of emergency in relation to their engagement level.

510

Furthermore, it appears evident how people with low level of Health Engagement, not being

511

psychologically ready to consider the social and public health consequences of their conduct,

512

appear more focused on their own health interests and less keen to rely on health authorities’

513

guidelines to orient their behaviors. For instance, the behavior of stockpile goods enacted by the

514

less engaged Italian citizens had a negative organizational impact on food supplies which further

515

compromised the delicate situation of the Italian population. Furthermore, the overcrowding at

516

superstores in the situation of COVID-19 epidemics was highly counterproductive and contributed

517

to spread the risk of contagion.

518
519

5. Limitations and future studies

520

The study measured a specific population’s views at a specific point in time; their beliefs and

521

attitudes reflect the information available at the time and therefore are not stable. Second, results

522

were self-reported. Measurement errors and social desirability bias may exist although the study

523

was anonymous.

524

Future research should test the Patient Health Engagement Model as a predictor of particular

525

behaviors such as hand-hygiene or facial masks usage. In addition, it is important to carry out

526

further behavioral research where actual behavior can be measured and not only self-reported.

527
528

6. Practical implications

529

This study has provided evidence about the role of health engagement as a determinant of

530

citizens’ behavioral change which is key for controlling the spread of pandemic disease, and

531

described a conceptual framework – i.e. the Patient Health Engagement Model - in which to better

532

understand these behaviors. In sum, the study shows that health engagement levels are predictive

533

of different responses, both affective and behavioral: playing an active role in health management

534

is associated with a higher chance of enacting specific behaviors. In particular, the psychological

535

readiness to assume a proactive role in one own health prevention is explicative of the individuals’

536

tendency to be more or less able to comply to health authorities’ prescription and to perceive

537

themselves has main responsible for their own health and the health of their community.

538

Furthermore, the psychological readiness to engage in health results in a crucial factor for

539

explaining the different way in which individuals can cope with their worries for a health

540

emergency. The findings suggest that intervention studies should focus on particular groups and

541

on raising their levels of engagement to increase the effectiveness of educational initiatives

542

devoted to promoting preventive behaviors. Communication strategies should maximize their

543

impact by targeting messages according to the health engagement levels of citizens. For instance,

544

in order to improve the levels of engagement of citizens in a “psychological blackout”, reassuring

545

messages, aimed at sustaining the emotional elaboration of the emergency and related worries

546

would be particularly needed. Citizens in a situation of “psychological adherence” would need

547

positive stories of other persons who succeeded in adhere to the prescribed containment

548

measures in order to enhance their motivation to stay engaged. Finally, people in the position of

549

“eudaimonic projects”, who were able to develop a new sense of normality despite the sanitary

550

emergency, can be involved in peer-to-peer communication initiatives becoming advocates for the

551

correct engagement in adhere to the prescribed measures to face the COVID-19 epidemic.

552

Furthermore, fostering the psychological readiness to get engaged in health prevention appears to

553

be a crucial goal for educational and communication initiatives in the situation of a health

554

emergency. Carrying out this work now will be invaluable in preparing for this and future

555

pandemics.
