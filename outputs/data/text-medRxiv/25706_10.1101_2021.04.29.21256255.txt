Abstract
Several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been granted emergency use authorization
from the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar regulatory bodies abroad to
combat the COVID-19 pandemic. While these vaccines have been shown to be extremely safe,
transient side-effects lasting 24-48 hours post-vaccination have been reported. Here we
conducted a retrospective analysis of 50977 subscribers to the WHOOP platform (33119 males,
17858 females; total of 65686 unique responses) who received either the AstraZeneca (AZ,
n=2093), Janssen/Johnson & Johnson (J&J&J, n=3888), Moderna (n=23776; M1, 14553 first
dose; M2, 9223 second dose), or Pfizer/BioNTech (n=35929; P&B1, 22387 first dose; P&B2,
13542 second dose) vaccines using data collected through April 14, 2021. Subjective
reactogenicity was assessed using self-reported surveys. Results from these surveys indicated
that the odds of self-reporting an adverse event after vaccination depend on gender, age, and
manufacturer. Objectively measured cardiovascular (resting heart rate, RHR; heart rate variability,
HRV) and sleep (total sleep duration, % light sleep, and % restorative sleep [a combination of
REM and slow wave sleep]) metrics were assessed using a wrist-worn biometric device (Whoop
Inc, Boston, MA, USA) and compared to the same day of the week, one week prior. Data are
presented as a percent change from baseline ± 95% confidence intervals. On the night after
vaccination, RHR was higher (AZ: 13.5±0.76%; J&J&J: 16.5±0.64%; M1: 2.86±0.19%; M2:
9.3±0.53%; P&B1: 1.18±0.14%; P&B2: 13.5±0.36%) and HRV (AZ: -21.8±1.47%; J&J&J: 25.6±1.15%; M1: -4.8±055%; M2: -19.9±1.33%; P&B1: -1.7±0.45%; P&B2: 8.60±1.10%) was
lower than baseline levels. As for sleep metrics, total sleep was lower after the AZ and J&J&J
vaccines (AZ: -3.7±0.98%; J&J&J: -3.8±0.80%; M1: 0.94±0.32%; M2: 0.14±0.80%; P&B1:
1.10±0.25%; P&B2: 0.35±0.63%); for AZ, J&J&J and the second dose of Moderna and P&B, a
greater percentage of sleep post-vaccination came from light sleep (AZ: 9.24±1.22%; J&J&J:
13.8±1.02%; M1: 1.73±0.40%; M2: 8.02±0.99%; P&B1: 0.44±0.31%; P&B2: 2.54±0.74%) and a

lower percentage from restorative sleep (AZ: -9.21±1.27%; J&J&J: -12.6±1.00%; M1:
0.16±0.43%; M2: -8.31±1.05%; P&B1: 1.27±0.34%; P&B2: -1.36±0.83%) than the week prior.
Across all objective metrics measured, there were general trends that indicated an attenuated
response in older populations and a larger response after the second dose for the
Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines (AstraZeneca second dose not analyzed). Importantly,
the effects of the vaccines on cardiovascular and sleep measures were transient and returned to
baseline by the second night following vaccination (P > 0.05 or absolute Cohen’s d < 0.25). In
summary, these results confirm the previously observed subjective symptomatology trends, and
for the first time show that objectively measured cardiovascular and sleep parameters are altered
the night after vaccination. Moreover, these results suggest that the response may be different
between vaccine manufacturers and may be modified by age and larger after the second dose.
This information can be used to inform policy makers and employers considering offering paid
time off for vaccination, as well as individuals planning their commitments post-vaccination.

Introduction
Vaccines are needed to curb the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2), which leads to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, vaccines from
AstraZeneca, Janssen/Johnson & Johnson (J&J&J), Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech have been
approved for use across Europe and in North and South America1. While these vaccines
effectively reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection2–5, initial reports on reactogenicity indicate that local and
systemic events can occur transiently upon vaccination6. Previous data on reactogenicity relies
on self-reported, subjective data and the effects of COVID-19 vaccine on objective physiological
measures are unknown. As subjective data is prone to bias7, there is a need for objective data
collection that can provide insights into additional dimensions, such as sleep architecture, which
individuals are not consciously aware of.
Wearables that continuously collect high-quality physiological data provide an opportunity
to examine the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on sleep and cardiovascular measures at larger
scales than would typically be possible in traditional clinical settings. Here we utilize objective
data collected using the WHOOP Strap (Whoop Inc Boston, MA, USA), a validated8, wrist-worn
biometric device to determine the physiological effects of COVID-19 vaccination. This study is the
first large-scale study to quantify the impact of available COVID-19 vaccinations using objective
cardiovascular and sleep outcome data.

Methods
Data Collection
To gather subjective information on the effect of the COVID-19 vaccine, WHOOP
members were prompted via daily surveys delivered through the WHOOP mobile application
inquiring if they had received a COVID-19 vaccine. If they indicated that they had received a
vaccine, they were further asked to provide the date of the vaccination, the manufacturer of their
vaccine, and if they experienced any symptoms after vaccination. The symptoms questionnaire

allowed for multiple selections, and queried for experience of a fever, chills, muscle aches,
headaches, or fatigue. Users were also allowed to report no adverse events and this option did
not allow for multiple selections. As part of the WHOOP data analytics platform, measures of
sleep duration, architecture, and quality, as well as markers of cardiovascular health such as
resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV) are measured each night. For this
analysis, metrics leading into and following vaccination were collated with the self-reported
vaccine and symptomatology data. Baseline metrics were taken from the same day of the week
on the week prior to the vaccination; the same day of week was used in order to control for
confounders related to weekday/weekend differences in sleep behavior and outcomes which have
been previously reported in WHOOP members9. Inclusion criteria consisted of being over the age
of 18, having a WHOOP membership at the time of solicitation, and self-reporting having received
one of the four vaccines included in this analysis. The survey reported in this manuscript is
ongoing and includes data that were collected by April 14, 2021.
The utilized data are the property of WHOOP, Inc. and the authors are employees of
WHOOP, Inc. and therefore are permitted to access the data used in this analysis per the
company’s terms of service. The information security committee of WHOOP, Inc. concluded that
this study does not require approval by an ethics committee due to the use of appropriately
anonymized data accessed without the inclusion of personally identifiable information.

Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using the R programming language (version 4.0.4). For the selfreported surveys, data were analyzed using a logistic regression model that included
manufacturer, discretized age, and gender. Age was discretized by binning into 18-29, 30-39, 4054, and 55 & older age groups. Reference level for groups with more than two factors were either
the Moderna second shot or the 18-29 year old group. To determine the effect of the vaccine on
sleep and cardiovascular parameters, post-vaccine measures were compared to the prior same

day of week within an individual using mixed model ANOVAs. These models included vaccination
status (whether a person was pre- or post-vaccination, with post-vaccination defined here as the
sleep immediately following vaccination), manufacturer, and age, and were subset into whether
they came from the first or second/single dose. The single dose J&J&J vaccine was modeled as
a second dose, reflecting that it is a final dose. When interactions were observed, models were
further dissected to test for either simple two-way interactions or simple simple main effects.
Pairwise comparisons between baseline and post-vaccine measures were made using t-tests and
multiple comparisons were corrected for using the Bonferroni method. Effects sizes were
determined using Cohen’s d. Values beyond three interquartile ranges from the upper or lower
quartiles were deemed outliers and excluded from analysis. Significance was set as P < 0.05.

Self-Reported Adverse Events Post-Vaccination
In total, we received 65867 responses (Table 1) to the voluntary COVID-19 vaccination

any symptoms, we found significant differences in the odds of reporting an adverse event for
manufacturer, dose, age, and gender. Compared to the second dose of Moderna, those who
received AstraZeneca (OR=1.19, 95% CI = 1.04-1.36; P < 0.05), Pfizer/BioNTech first dose
(OR=7.82, 95% CI = 7.31-8.37; P < 0.001), Pfizer/BioNTech second dose (OR=2.94, 95% CI =
2.74-3.17; P < 0.001), Moderna first dose (OR=4.90, 95% CI=4.57-5.26; P<0.001), and J&J&J
(OR=1.48, 95% CI=1.33-1.65; P<0.001) vaccines were more likely to report being without an
adverse event (Figure 1). Men (OR=1.47, 95% CI=1.41-1.52; P <0.001) were more likely than
women to report not experiencing an adverse event (Figure 1). Compared to the 18-29 year-old
age group, those between the ages of 30-39 (OR= 1.21, 95% CI=1.16-1.27; P<0.001), 40-54
(OR=1.52, CI=1.45-1.60; P < 0.001), and 55 & older (OR=2.27, CI=2.12-2.44; P < 0.001) were
more likely to report not experiencing an adverse event (Figure 1).

Effect of COVID-19 Vaccination on Cardiovascular Parameters
Cardiovascular measures deviated from baseline values on the first night after vaccination
(Figure 2A-D). Compared to individual baselines there was a three-way interaction between
vaccination status, manufacturer, and age on RHR (P < 0.001; Supplemental Table 1) and HRV
(P < 0.001; Supplemental Table 2) within each dosing regime. For both RHR and HRV, when
subset by manufacturer, we observed interactions between vaccination status and age for each
manufacturer (P < 0.001; Supplemental Table 1 and 2); when subset by age, we observed
interactions between vaccination status and manufacturer for each age group (P < 0.001;
Supplemental Table 1 and 2). We also analyzed the effect of the first vs second dose for the
Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines and found an interaction between vaccine status and
first/second dose (P < 0.001; Supplemental Table 1 and 2). For RHR, pairwise comparisons and
their associated effect sizes revealed that large effects were observed only in the younger
individuals (<40 years old) and only after either the AstraZeneca, second Moderna, or J&J&J
vaccination (Cohen’s d >0.8; Supplemental Table 3). Taken together, these results indicate that
cardiovascular parameters are perturbed on the night after vaccination, and that these
perturbations are modulated by age, manufacturer, and dose.
To determine the duration of the effect of the vaccines on cardiovascular parameters, prevs. post-vaccination pairwise comparisons were extended out to two- and three-nights postvaccine; only Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were statistically significantly different from
baseline on the second night in males. Specifically: on the second night after the first Moderna
vaccine, HRV remained lower and RHR remained higher than baseline for members under the
age of 55 (P < 0.001; Supplemental Table 4 and 5); on the second night after the second Moderna
vaccine, HRV remained lower than baseline for members between the ages of 30-54 (all P <
0.001; Supplemental Table 5) and RHR remained higher than baseline for members under the
age of 55 (all P < 0.001; Supplemental Table 4); on the second night after the second

Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, RHR remained higher than baseline for members between the ages 3039 (P < 0.01; Supplemental Table 4). However, all of the differences observed on the second
night were not meaningfully different from baseline (absolute Cohen’s d < 0.25; Supplemental
Table 4 and 5). Together these results support the idea that cardiovascular parameters are
affected by COVID-19 vaccination on the night after vaccination, and that these responses are
both transient and modulated by age and manufacturer.

Effect of COVID-19 Vaccination on Sleep Parameters
Total sleep and sleep architecture deviated from baseline values on the first night after
vaccination (Figure 3A-F). For both the first and the second or single shot regimes, two way
interactions were observed between vaccine status and age and between vaccine status and
manufacturer on sleep duration (P < 0.001; Supplemental Table 6). Pairwise comparisons
between baseline levels and the night after vaccination indicated that sleep is moderately
decreased in the Male 18-29 year-old group that received the AstraZeneca vaccine (P<0.001,
Cohen’s d<-0.5, Supplemental Table 7), while all other comparisons were either not significant or
have negligible or small effects (absolute Cohen’s d <0.5; Supplemental Table 7).
For both light (P < 0.001; Supplemental Table 8) and restorative sleep (P < 0.001;
Supplemental Table 9), there was a three-way interaction between vaccination status,
manufacturer, and age within each dosing regimen. Pairwise comparisons and associated effect
sizes indicated moderate effects on light or restorative sleep after the AstraZeneca, J&J&J, and
second Moderna vaccine in individuals younger than 40 (P < 0.001, absolute Cohen’s d < 0.5;
Supplemental Table 10 and 11), whereas the rest of the comparisons were either not significant
or have negligible or small effects (absolute Cohen’s d <0.5; Supplemental Table 10 and 11). In
summary, these results suggest that vaccines affect sleep and their associated components, and
that these responses are modulated by manufacturer, dose, and age.

Discussion
The aim of this study was to examine the objective and subjective response to COVID-19
vaccination in a large population of healthy adults. To accomplish this, we performed a
retrospective analysis of the acute effect of vaccination on self-reported, sleep, and
cardiovascular metrics on 50,977 individuals (providing 65,686 responses) receiving one of four
COVID-19 vaccinations on or prior to April 14, 2021. Findings were divided into self-reported
symptomatology, objectively measured sleep, and objectively measured cardiovascular metrics.
The major finding of these analyses is that across the three sets of outcomes investigated,
reactogenicity varied by vaccine dose (where applicable), manufacturer, and age of the recipient.
These analyses complement and extend the initial findings from the individual clinical
trials2–5 and self-reported surveys6 by comparing between more manufacturers and by examining

objective measures. The results from this investigation suggest that the physiological response
to COVID-19 vaccination, as assessed by cardiovascular and sleep measures, may differ by
manufacturer and dose. This is the first study to investigate the effect of COVID-19 vaccination
on cardiovascular and sleep parameters between manufacturers and dose and further research
is required to determine the mechanisms behind these different responses.
In line with prior reports on subjective measures, we find that older vaccine recipients were
less likely to report adverse events than younger participants10. We add to these reports by
demonstrating that age also plays a role in the objectively measured physiological response to
vaccination, whereby older individuals have an attenuated response as compared to younger
participants across all objective metrics analyzed. It is well established that older individuals have
less protection from disease after vaccination11 and we wonder if the attenuated responses
measured within this investigation are due to an impaired immune response post-vaccination. If
so, these results support a role for biometric monitoring to assess whether immunity was imprinted
post-vaccine; however, further research needs to be conducted to address this hypothesis.
This is the first large-scale study to report on the acute objective and subjective
reactogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination in healthy adults. These results indicate that
cardiovascular and sleep parameters are disturbed on the first night after COVID-19 vaccination,
and that the degree of disturbance is dependent on dose, manufacturer, and age. Importantly,
the perturbations to cardiovascular and sleep parameters were transient and, in almost all
analyzed cohorts, not practically different (Cohen’s d < 0.25) from pre-vaccine baseline levels by
the second night following vaccination. These results are applicable to individuals anticipating
receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine as they organize their post-vaccine commitments as well as by
policy makers and employers considering offering time off for vaccination.

Interpretation of the results should be made with consideration to the limitations of this study. Data
regarding the receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine, the preparation of vaccine received, and the
symptoms experienced were collected via survey and not otherwise verified. However, we
assume the frequency of recollection error was negligible due to the robustness of our findings
and the short gap between vaccination and survey completion.
