Abstract

37

Thromboembolic events are frequently reported in patients infected with the SARS-

38

CoV-2 virus. However, the exact mechanisms of thromboembolic events remain

39

elusive. In this work, we show that immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass in patients with

40

COVID-19 trigger the formation of procoagulant PLTs in a Fc-gamma-RIIA (FcγRIIA)

41

dependent pathway leading to increased thrombus formation in vitro. Most

42

importantly, these events were significantly inhibited via FcγRIIA blockade as well as

43

by the elevation of PLTs´ intracellular cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate (cAMP)

44

levels by the clinical used agent Iloprost. The novel findings of FcγRIIA mediated

45

prothrombotic conditions in terms of procoagulant PLTs leading to higher thrombus

46

formation as well as the successful inhibition of these events via Iloprost could be

47

promising for the future treatment of the complex coagulopathy observed in COVID-

48

19 disease.

Introduction

51

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be associated with abnormalities in

52

the coagulation system with an increased incidence of thromboembolic events in

53

small vessels leading to higher mortality (1-3). Accumulating evidence suggests

54

upregulated release of inflammatory cytokines and increased interaction between

55

different actors of innate and adaptive immunity as the main causes for the

56

prothrombotic environment observed in COVID-19 disease (4). Moreover, a

57

significant number of reports described platelet (PLT) hyperactivity in patients with

58

COVID-19, which is assumed to contribute to prothrombotic conditions (5, 6).

59

Procoagulant PLTs, predominantly generated at the outer side of the growing

60

thrombus, are increasingly recognized to link primary with secondary haemostasis (7-

61

10). The latter is mainly executed by negatively charged membrane phospholipids

62

externalized on the PLT surface. This unique feature of procoagulant PLTs enables

63

the assembly of tenase as well as prothrombinase complexes leading to high

64

thrombin burst, increased fibrin deposition and thrombus formation (11). Recently, we

65

showed that PLTs from patients with severe COVID-19 infection express a

66

procoagulant phenotype. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) fractions were found to be

67

responsible for the COVID-19 induced procoagulant PLTs (Althaus et al. accepted).

68

In the current study, we investigate the time course of the generation of

69

antibody- induced procoagulant PLTs as well as the mechanisms leading to

70

alterations in the PLT phenotype in COVID-19. We observed that IgG fractions from

71

severe COVID-19 patients induce increased thrombus formation in an Fc-gamma

72

RIIA (FcγRIIA) dependent manner. More importantly, we were able to show that

73

cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate (cAMP) elevation in PLTs prevents COVID-19

74

antibody-induced procoagulant PLT generation as well as clot formation.

Materials and Methods

76

Patients and sera

77

Experiments were performed using leftover serum material from COVID-19 patients

78

who were referred to our laboratory between March and June 2020. The diagnosis of

79

SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by real time PCR on material collected by

80

nasal swabs. Sera from ICU non-Covid-19 patients with postoperative sepsis were

81

collected to serve as ICU control group. Additionally, sera were collected from

82

healthy blood donors at the Blood Donation Centre Tuebingen after written

83

consensus was obtained to establish cutoff values when appropriate. Serum samples

84

were stored at -80°C and thawed at room temperature prior to the performed

85

experimental procedure. All sera were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes (min),

86

which was followed by a centrifugation step at 5000xg. The spun-down was

87

discarded and supernatants were handled as described in the following sections.

88

IgG preparation

89

IgG fractions were isolated by the use of a commercially available IgG-purification-kit

90

(MelonTM-Gel IgG Spin Purification Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and

91

used as recommended by the manufacturer. In brief, heat inactivated serum was

92

diluted 1:10 in purification buffer and incubated with the kit specific Gel IgG

93

Purification Support over four cycles for 10 min. Subsequently, periodically performed

94

centrifugation steps through a 10 µm pore size filter tube were performed for 1 min at

95

5000xg. The flow throw was collected into 100 kDa-pore sized centrifugal filters

96

(Amicon Ultra-4, Merck Millipore, Cork, Ireland) with subsequent concentration to the

97

initial volume of the used serum sample via centrifugation (10-15 min, 2000xg, 4°C,

98

with brake). Afterwards, IgG concentrations were measured at a mass extinction

coefficient of 13.7 at 280 nm wavelength using a NanoDrop One spectrophotometer

100

(VWR, Bruchsal, Germany). IgG purity was verified using Coomassie staining

101

(Abcam, Cambridge, UK).

102

Preparation of washed platelets

103

Washed platelets (wPLTs) were prepared from venous blood samples as described

104

previously (12). Briefly, whole blood from healthy donors was withdrawn by cubital

105

venipuncture into acidic-dextrose containing vacutainers (Becton-Dickinson,

106

Plymouth, UK) and allowed to rest for 45 min at 37°C. After centrifugation (20 min,

107

120xg, room temperature [RT], no brake) PLT-rich-plasma (PRP) was gently

108

separated and supplemented with apyrase (5 µL/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA)

109

and prewarmed ACD-A (111 µL/mL, Terumo BCT, Inc., Lakewood, USA). After an

110

additional centrifugation step (7 min, 650xg, RT, no brake), the PLT pellet was

111

resuspended in 5 mL of wash-solution (modified Tyrode buffer: 5 mL bicarbonate

112

buffer, 20 percent (%) bovine serum albumin, 10% glucose solution [Braun,

113

Melsungen, Germany], 2.5 U/mL apyrase, 1 U/mL hirudin [Pentapharm, Basel,

114

Swiss], pH 6.3) and allowed to rest for 15 min at 37°C. Following final centrifugation

115

(7 min, 650xg, RT, no brake) wPLTs were resuspended in 2 mL of resuspension-

116

buffer (50 mL of modified Tyrode buffer, 0.5 mL of 0.1 M MgCl2, 1 mL of 0.2 M

117

CaCl2, pH 7.2) and adjusted to 300x109 PLTs/L after the measurement at a Cell-Dyn

118

Ruby hematological analyzer (Abott, Wiesbaden, Germany) was performed. For

119

calcium chelation experiments, the PLT pellet was resuspended with resuspension-

120

buffer without the supplementation of calcium (50 mL of modified Tyrode buffer, 0.5

121

mL of 0.1 M MgCl2, pH 7.2).

123

wPLTs (7.5x106 ) were supplemented with 5 µL serum/IgG from ICU COVID-19

124

patients or control serum/IgG and incubated for 1.5 hours (hs) at RT under rotating

125

conditions. Afterwards, samples were washed once (7 min, 650xg, RT, no brake),

126

resuspended in 100 µL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, [Biochrom, Berlin,

127

Germany]) and further handled as described in the following sections.

128

Detection of phosphatidylserine exposure

129

To assess externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the PLT surface after

130

antibody treatment, 10 µL of PLT suspension were transferred into 100 µL of Hank´s

131

balanced salt solution (HBSS), (137 mM NaCl, 1.25 mM CaCl2, 5.5 mM glucose,

132

[Carl-Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany]) and incubated with 1 µL Annexin V-FITC

133

(Immunotools, Friesoythe, Germany) for 30 min at RT in the dark. To induce the

134

maximal externalization of PS on the PLT surface, wPLTs were incubated with

135

ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA, [5 µM, 15 min at RT]). Afterwards, PLTs

136

were filled up with HBSS to a final volume of 500 µL and acquired at a flow cytometer

137

([FC], Navios, Beckman-Coulter, Brea, USA).
PLTs were gated based on their characteristic forward scatter (FSC) vs. side

138
139

scatter (SSC) properties as well as CD41a and CD42a expression (anti-CD41a-PC5

140

and anti-CD42a-PerCP, both BD, San Jose, USA), respectively. Test results were

141

analyzed as fold increase of the percentage PS positive PLTs compared to PLTs that

142

were incubated with serum/IgG from healthy individuals.

143

Determination of changes in the inner-mitochondrial-transmembrane potential

144

(ΔΨ)

145

Changes of the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (ΔΨ) induced by ICU

146

COVID-19 sera/IgG were analyzed by FC, as previously reported (13). Briefly, after

147

treatment with IgG/serum from ICU COVID-19 patients, wPLTs (~2x106) were

148

incubated with a final concentration of 10 µM tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester

149

(TMRE, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 30 min at RT in the dark. Carbonyl cyanide 4-

150

(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) which is an

151

uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation served as positive control in

152

each experiment. After staining with TMRE, PLTs were filled up with PBS to a final

153

volume of 500 µL and immediately analyzed by FC. Changes in the ΔΨ were

154

determined in gated PLTs as percentage of TMRE negative events and normalized to

155

PLTs that were treated with serum/IgG from healthy controls.

156

Phenotyping of different PLT-populations

157

ICU COVID-19 serum/IgG-mediated procoagulant changes (PS/CD62p-double

158

positive) were assessed in some experiments using a triple staining. Briefly, 10 µL

159

(~1x106) of the resuspended PLT suspension were transferred into 10 µL of HBSS

160

and incubated with 1 µL anti-CD62p-APC (BD, San Jose, USA), 1 µL Annexin-FITC

161

(Immunotools, Friesoythe, Germany) and 1 µL anti-CD42a-PerCP (BD, San Jose,

162

USA) for 15 min at RT in the dark. PLTs treated with thrombin receptor activating

163

peptide (TRAP-6, [20 µM, 30 min at RT]) and ionomycin (5 µM, 15 min at RT, [both

164

Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA]) served as positive controls. Afterwards, PLTs were

165

resuspended with HBSS to a final volume of 500 µL and immediately assessed via

166

FC. In selected experiments that were designed to investigate the impact of calcium

167

on cell signalling, PLT PS externalization was assessed by the use of the calcium

168

independent marker lactadherin. 1 µL of lactadherin-FITC (Haematologic

169

Technologies, Essex Junction, USA) was incubated with wPLTs as for Annexin-FITC

170

for 15 min at RT, in the dark, and the PLT suspension filled up to final volume of 500

171

µL with PBS prior to FC analysis.

172

Western blot analysis of caspase 3 cleavage

173

Protein levels of cleaved-caspase 3 were determined by western blot. After

174

serum/IgG incubation, cells were washed with PBS for 7 min, 700xg at 4°C.

175

Subsequently, the pellet was resuspended in 100 μL of ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer

176

containing HALTTM protease and phosphatase inhibitor-cocktail (both ThermoFisher

177

Scientific, Paisley, UK). Protein concentrations were determined using the NanoDrop

178

One spectrophotometer (VWR, Bruchsal, Germany). 100 µg of protein was

179

solubilized in sample buffer (InvitrogenTM, Carlsbad, USA) at 95ºC for 10 min.

180

Proteins were separated by electrophoresis using 12% SDS-PAGE gels in glycine-

181

tris buffer. Thereafter, probes were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)

182

membranes (0.45 µm, Merck, Tullagreen, Ireland). Afterwards, membranes were

183

blocked with 5% milk in tris-buffered saline (TBS-T, 20 mM Tris, 140 mM NaCl, 0.1%

184

Tween, pH 7.6) at RT for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with primary anti-

185

human cleaved-caspase 3 antibody (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and anti-

186

human alpha-tubulin (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, USA) at 4°C

187

overnight. After washing with TBS-T buffer, the membranes were incubated with the

188

appropriate secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody conjugated with IRDye®680

189

/ IRDye®800 (1:3000, LI-COR®, Lincoln, USA) for 1 h at RT. Protein bands were

190

detected after additional washes (TBS-T) with Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-

191

COR®, Lincoln, USA). Western blots were analyzed by ImageJ software (NIH,

192

Bethesda, USA). The results are shown as the ratio of total cleaved-caspase 3 to

193

procaspase 3 (full fragment) and normalized to wPLTs that were treated with healthy

194

control serum/IgG.

196

75 µL wPLTs were pretreated with the FcγRIIA blocking monoclonal antibody (moAb)

197

anti-CD32 (5 µL moAb IV.3; stemcellTM technologies, Vancouver, Canada) for 45 min

198

at 37°C prior to serum/IgG treatment. A monoclonal isotype (moAb) served as

199

vehicle control ([SC-2025], Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, USA).

200

For the chelation of extracellular calcium, the non-membrane permeable

201

chelator of extracellular calcium EGTA (Ethyleneglycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-

202

N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 1 mM, 5 min at 37°C [Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA]) was

203

used.

204

For the depletion of calcium in the inner compartment of PLTs, the intracellular

205

chelator of calcium BAPTA-AM (1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-

206

tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl) ester, 20 µM, 15 min at 37°C, [Selleck,

207

Houston, USA]) was used.

208

To investigate the effect of increased intracellular levels of cAMP, wPLTs were

209

pretreated with the adenylate cyclase (ADC) inducers Forskolin (2.25 µM) and

210

Iloprost (20 nM, both Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) prior to the incubation with

211

sera/IgGs from ICU COVID-19 patients.

212

Investigations of antibody-mediated thrombus formation

213

To assess the impact of ICU COVID-19 IgG-induced effects on clot formation, an ex

214

vivo model for thrombus formation was established. A microfluidic system (BioFlux,

215

Fluxion Biosciences, Alameda, USA) was used at a shear rate of 1500-1 (60 dyne)

216

according to the recommendations of the ISTH standardization committee for

217

biorheology (14). Briefly, microfluidic channels were coated with collagen (100

218

µg/mL, Collagen Horm, Takeda, Linz, Austria) overnight at 4°C and blocked with

219

2.5% of human serum albumin (HSA, Kedrion, Barga, Italy) 1 h before perfusion at

220

RT.

221

Whole blood samples of healthy individuals of blood group O were collected into

222

hirudin containing monovettes (Sarstedt, Nuembrecht, Germany) and allowed to rest

223

for 30 min at RT. After splitting the whole blood into aliquots of 200 µL, PRP was

224

prepared via centrifugation (20 min, 120xg, at RT, no break). Afterwards, 45 µL of the

225

supernatant PRP was gently separated and incubated with 5 µL of control or ICU

226

COVID-19 IgG fractions and incubated for 90 min at RT under rotating conditions. 15

227

min prior to the end of the incubation period, Calcein-FITC (4 µM, [Thermo Scientific,

228

Eugene, Oregon, USA]) was added to each sample. Subsequently, PRP was gently

229

added back to reconstitute whole blood samples.

230

When indicated, the separated PRP was pretreated with moAb IV.3 or moAb

231

isotype control at a concentration of 20 µg/mL for 30 min at RT. For cAMP induction,

232

PRP was pretreated with Iloprost (20 nM) or vehicle control (5 min, 37°C) prior to IgG

233

incubation.

234

Finally, reconstituted whole blood samples were run at a shear rate of 1500s-1

235

(60 dyne) for a maximum of 5 min. Immunofluorescence and bright field images were

236

taken from 3-5 randomly chosen microscopic fields (x20, Olympus IX73, Olympus

237

GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Clot formation was assessed by measuring the % of

238

surface area coated by thrombus (SAC) of 3-5 images via ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda,

239

USA) and normalized to the whole area.

240

Statistical analysis

241

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 (La Jolla, USA). T-test

242

was used to analyze normally distributed results. Non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney

243

test) was used when data failed to follow a normal distribution as assessed by

Results

252

Patient characteristics

253

Sera from 26 ICU COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study between March the

254

1st and June the 16th 2020. 21 of these ICU COVID-19 patients were included in a

255

previous study (Althaus et al. accepted). The mean age of ICU COVID-19 patients

256

was 58 years (range: 29-88 years). 20/30 (67%) patients had known risk factors for

257

severe COVID-19 infection as described previously (15), including hypertension

258

18/30 (60%), obesity 6/30 (20%), coronary artery disease 4/30 (13%) and diabetes

259

mellitus 6/30 (20%). Elevated D-Dimer levels were detected in all patients (median,

260

range: 3.4 mg/dL, 0.9-45.0 mg/dL) and thrombosis was diagnosed in 13/30 (43%)

261

patients. Longitudinal blood samples were available from four COVID-19 patients

262

who were first admitted to normal ward and later to the ICU for mechanical

263

ventilation. As ICU control group, 5 patients who were admitted to ICU due to non-

264

COVID-19 related causes were included in this study.

265

Sera from ICU COVID-19 patients induce progressive increase of procoagulant

266

PLTs

267

To investigate whether sera of ICU COVID-19 patients have the potential to induce

268

an increased Δψ depolarization as well as PS externalization on the PLT surface,

269

wPLTs from healthy individuals were incubated with sera from 26 ICU COVID-19

270

significantly higher PS externalization was observed when ICU COVID-19 sera were

276

incubated with PLTs compared to ICU control sera (FI in % PS±SEM: 2.12±0.19 vs.

277

1.12±0.08, p value <0.0001, Fig. 1 B).

278

Next, we sought to investigate the time course of the observed changes in

279

both markers. Longitudinal blood samples were available from four ICU COVID-19

280

patients. Sera were collected at hospital admission (normal ward or ICU) and during

281

a follow up period at ICU for up to 14 days. As shown in Fig. 1 C-F, sera from ICU

282

COVID-19 patients induced significant changes in Δψ depolarization, PS

283

externalization and caspase 3 cleavage as clinical manifestation worsen requiring

284

admission to ICU. Of note, antibody-induced changes peaked within day 3 and 7 of

285

the ICU stay (FI in % Δψ depolarization±SEM: 3.71±0.72, p value 0.0070; and % PS

286

externalization ±SEM: 4.80±1.11, p value <0.0001, respectively, Suppl. Fig. 1).

287

These findings were further supported by WB analyses, as PLTs incubated with the

288

corresponding ICU COVID-19 serum induced caspase 3 cleavage in similar kinetic

289

(Ratio of cleaved caspase 3/procaspase 3 normalized to control±SEM: 4.84±0.45, p

290

value 0.0035, Fig. 1 E+F). Notably, the rise of PLT markers was associated with

291

increasing levels of detected IgGs against the spike S protein of SARS-CoV-2 in the

292

corresponding ICU COVID-19 patients’ follow up sera but not in the total IgG

293

contents of isolated IgG fractions (Suppl. Fig. 2 A and B, respectively). Moreover,

294

declining PLT-counts were observed as Δψ depolarization as well as PS

externalization increased, vice versa (Suppl. Fig. 3 A and B, respectively).

analyzed in two colour FC in parallel to PS. FC analyses revealed that IgG fractions

301

from severe COVID-19 patients induce remarkable changes in the PLT SSC and

302

FSC (Fig. 2.1. A+C), as well as in the distribution of CD62p/PS positivity (Fig. 2.1.

303

B+D). In contrast, the PLT population was almost non-affected after incubation with

304

IgGs from healthy controls (HCs) or ICU non-COVID-19 control patients. Overall,

305

higher percentage of double positive events was observed after incubation with IgGs

306

from ICU COVID-19 patients compared to ICU and to HCs (% CD62p/PS positive

309

the PS single positive PLT population (% PS positive PLTs±SEM: 13.17±2.05 vs.

310

312

19.40±1.83 vs. 13.53±1.90, p value 0.1011, Fig. 2.1. III).

313

Next, we sought to investigate the ability of IgG fractions from patients with

314

severe COVID-19 to cause increased clot formation. PLTs from healthy individuals

315

were incubated with IgGs from ICU COVID-19 patients or ICU and HCs, added to

316

autologous whole blood samples and finally perfused throw collagen covered

317

microfluidic channels at a shear rate of 1500 s-1 (60 dyne). As shown in Fig. 3 A, IgG

318

from severe COVID-19 patients caused increased clot formation. Overall, significantly

319

higher surface area coverage by thrombus (SAC) was observed in the presence of

320

ICU COVID-19 IgGs compared to ICU controls and HCs (mean % SAC±SEM:

321

13.95%±1.55 vs. 2.86±1.10, p value 0.0070; and vs. 2.70±0.83, p value 0.0002,

322

respectively, Fig. 3 B). Together with the increased percentage of procoagulant PLTs

323

(CD62p/PS positive) in response to ICU COVID-19 IgGs, these findings might

324

provide a potential explanation for the increased thromboembolic events in severely

325

affected COVID-19 patients.

ICU COVID-19 IgGs cause procoagulant PLTs via crosslinking FcγRIIA

327

To further determine the underlying mechanistic pathways leading to ICU COVID-19

328

IgG induced formation of procoagulant PLTs, we next considered a potential ligation

329

of FcγRIIA by patients, sera/IgGs. For this purpose, wPLTs were pretreated with the

330

moAb IV.3. This FcγRIIA blockade resulted in marked inhibition of the antibody-

331

induced Δψ depolarization (FI in % Δψ depolarization±SEM: 5.51±0.94 vs.

332

1.18±0.08, p value 0.0020, Fig. 4.1. A) as well as significant reduction of caspase

activation (Ratio of cleaved caspase 3/procaspase 3±SEM: 4.70±1.16 vs. 1.33±0.29,

334

335

the changes in PLTs´ FSC and SSC properties (Fig. 4.2. A+C), and markedly

336

reduced CD62p/PS double positive PLT population compared to isotype-control (%

339

Next, we analyzed the impact of FcγRIIA blockade on antibody-mediated clot

340

formation. Pretreatment of PLTs with moAb IV.3 prior to ICU COVID-19 IgG

341

incubation resulted in significant reduction of clot formation compared to isotype-

control (mean % SAC±SEM: 16.49±1.02 vs. 5.84±1.93, respectively, p value 0.0090,

344

present in a subgroup of severe ICU COVID-19 patients have the capability to induce

345

formation of procoagulant PLTs with increased clotting ability via crosslinking

346

349

Following the detection of an ICU COVID-19 IgG-induced procoagulant PLT

350

phenotype, we sought to investigate the underlying intracellular molecular

351

mechanisms. The contribution of calcium was analyzed by the depletion of extra- and

352

intracellular calcium contents via EGTA and BAPTA, respectively. Extracellular

353

calcium depletion caused significant inhibition of Δψ depolarization (FI in % Δψ

354

depolarization±SEM: 3.08±0.18 vs. 1.94±0.20, p value 0.0079, Fig. 6.1. A) as well as

marked reduction of caspase 3 cleavage (Ratio of cleaved caspase 3/procaspase

356

357

depletion of extracellular calcium significantly inhibited ICU COVID-19 IgG induced

358

alterations of wPLTs´ morphology (Fig. 6.2. A-D) as well as the generation of

359

CD62p/PS positive PLTs (% CD62p/PS positive PLTs±SEM: 32.89±2.77 vs.

Similar effects were observed as depleting intracellular calcium stores. BAPTA

treatment resulted in significant inhibition of ICU COVID-19 IgG-induced Δψ

depolarization (FI in % Δψ depolarization±SEM: 4.46±0.73 vs. 0.99±0.09, p value

addition, BAPTA pretreatment of wPLTs resulted in marked prevention of ICU

numerous essential physiological processes during PLT activation and apoptosis (16,

375

17). Therefore, we investigated the role of cAMP on COVID-19 antibody-induced

376

formation of procoagulant PLTs. Forskolin, an activator of intracellular ADC that

377

elevates intracellular levels of cAMP, was recently reported to inhibit the formation of

378

apoptotic PLTs in immune thrombocytopenia (18). The pretreatment of PLTs with

379

Forskolin led to significant reduction of ICU COVID-19 IgG-induced Δψ depolarization

383

Forskolin pretreatment of wPLTs led to reduction of ICU COVID-19 IgG-induced

changes in FSC and SSC properties (Fig. 8.2. A-D) as well as to a significant

387

the elevation of intracellular cAMP prevents ICU COVID-19 IgG-induced formation of

388

procoagulant PLTs.

389

More importantly and of high clinical interest, similar protective effect was

observed with Iloprost, an already approved cAMP inducer (19). In fact, Iloprost

Discussion

409

Our study showed that IgGs from patients with severe COVID-19 are able to induce

410

procoagulant PLTs with increased potential for clot formation via crosslinking FcγRIIA

411

in a calcium depending manner. Most importantly, we showed that cAMP activation

412

by an approved drug, namely Iloprost, can sufficiently inhibit the initiation of

413

procoagulant PLTs and the subsequent increased clot formation. These data may

414

have tremendous clinical implications.

415

Meanwhile, it is well established that COVID-19 infection is associated with

416

systemic prothrombotic state and increased incidence of thromboembolic

417

complications (20). However, the pre-sequelae events leading to the coagulopathy

418

observed in COVID-19 still remains elusive. Data from our study demonstrate the

419

presence of PLT-reactive IgG antibodies that harbour the ability to induce marked

420

changes in PLTs in terms of increased Δψ depolarization, PS externalization and P-

421

selectin expression, which are characteristic for procoagulant PLTs. A novel finding,

422

and potentially of high clinical interest, is that antibody-mediated formation of

423

procoagulant PLTs was associated with the clinical course as these changes

424

progressively increased as patients needed ventilation and peaked between day 3

425

and 7 on ICU. Probably, the kinetic of these markers might have predictive value to

426

monitor COVID-19-induced coagulopathy. In fact, PS externalization was recently

427

found to be a predictive biomarker for thromboembolic complications related to

428

cardiovascular therapeutic devices (21). In contrast to PS, conventional markers of

429

PLT activation were declared in this study to fail the detection of early activation

430

events leading to thrombosis.

433

cleavage and PS externalization, could be found in apoptotic as well as procoagulant

434

PLTs. The involvement of PLT apoptosis to promote prothrombotic conditions has

435

been controversially discussed. In fact, recent data suggests that apoptotic PLTs are

436

unable to promote prothrombotic conditions (10). However, a clear dissection of the

437

molecular events leading to prothrombotic PLTs is challenging since activation of the

438

apoptosis caspase pathway has been described in the late phase of agonist-induced

439

PLT activation as well as in PLTs from patients with chronic kidney disease (22, 23),

440

which are prone to thromboembolic events. Our findings showed that antibody-

441

mediated Δψ disruption and caspase cleavage is associated with the induction of a

442

CD62p/PS positive PLT population suggesting that IgG antibodies in COVID-19

443

induce procoagulant rather than apoptotic PLTs. In fact, activated PLTs were shown

444

elsewhere to be predominant in COVID-19 patients (6). In particular, CD62p positive

445

PLTs were suggested to be involved in thrombosis in COVID-19 via the interaction

446

with neutrophil granulocytes leading to NET formation and increased interaction with

447

the inflamed vessel wall. Our data showed that COVID-19 IgG-antibodies trigger a

448

PLT population with procoagulant potential. An important finding that was reinforced

449

by data from an ex vivo microfluidic circulation system which revealed an increased

450

clot formation in the presence of COVID-19 IgG-antibodies.

451

Motivated by these novel functional data, we thought to dissect the exact

452

mechanistic pathways involved in the COVID-19 IgG-induced procoagulant status.

453

We found that ICU COVID-19 IgG-mediated changes in wPLTs involves the ligation

454

of the immune receptor FcγRIIA. The blockade of FcγRIIA significantly inhibits ICU

455

COVID-19 IgG-induced changes in Δψ depolarization as well as cleavage of caspase

456

3. Most importantly, FcγRIIA blockade reduced procoagulant CD62p/PS positive

457

PLTs and subsequently inhibited COVID-19 antibody-induced ex vivo clot formation.

458

While this findings are novel for COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, the correlation

459

between FcγRIIA ligation and increased risk for thromboembolic events is well

460

established for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) (24). Interestingly, the IgG

461

antibody formation peaks in HIT within 5-10 day after exposure to heparin and is

462

associated with PLT consumption and increased risk for thrombosis (25). Similarly, in

463

our study the ability of ICU COVID-19 sera to induce procoagulant PLTs was most

464

pronounced between day 3 and 7. Of note, antibody-induced alterations in PLT

465

markers were accompanied by enhanced levels of IgG antibodies against the Spike

466

S epitope of SARS-CoV-2.These findings might suggest a transient onset of

467

misdirected autoimmune mechanisms that result in the emergence of PLT-reactive

468

antibodies leading to a prothrombotic status in severe COVID-19 infection.

469

Calcium is involved in many biological mechanistic pathways in PLTs (16). In

470

response to PLT agonists, calcium is released from the PLT internal stores which is

471

followed by amplifying second wave extracellular calcium influx via store (SOCE) and

472

receptor operated calcium entry (ROCE), respectively (26). The role of calcium

473

signalling in ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) coupled GPVI

474

and (hem)ITAM coupled CLEC-2 receptor signalling has been well established in the

475

last few years (27). Additionally, FcγRIIA ligation has been shown to induce calcium

476

mobilization via ITAM signalling prior to platelet aggregation(28). In our study, the

477

depletion of calcium in the extracellular compartment inhibited ICU COVID-19 IgG-

478

induced procoagulant changes. This finding indicates that alterations in SOCE or

479

ROCE might be involved in the antibody-mediated generation of procoagulant PLTs

480

in COVID-19. In fact, the regulative role of SOCE for procoagulant PS externalization

481

has been previously reported, as SOCE channel inhibition resulted in reduced PS

482

externalization in human erythroleukemia cells (29). In addition, reduced PS

483

externalization and decreased clot formation was observed in chimeric mice that

484

express mutated impaired SOCE calcium channel Orai1 R93W on the PLT surface,

485

indicating that SOCE is a major inductor of PLT PS externalization and procoagulant

486

PLT formation (30). A potential role of ITAM-regulated signalling leading to

487

procoagulant PLTs has been also suggested. Calcium depletion inhibited GP VI

488

induced formation of procoagulant PLTs (31). In this study, the authors proposed that

489

distinct signalling cascades, most likely tyrosine and extracellular calcium dependent,

490

could be involved in the formation of procoagulant PLTs. Our findings emphasize the

491

role of extracellular calcium in FcγRIIA (ITAM) mediated procoagulant PLT formation.

492

Another possible explanation for these finding could be the loss of distinct calcium-

493

dependent conformational properties of PLT epitopes that are targeted by COVID-19

494

IgG antibodies. Dimeric PLT GP IIb/IIIa, the receptor for fibrinogen and well known

495

immunogenic epitopes of PLT-reactive autoantibodies in immune thrombocytopenia

496

(ITP), has been well characterized to be structurally dependent on extracellular

497

calcium levels (32). Although this might be currently too speculative, the depletion of

498

extracellular calcium might have inhibited antibody binding to such conformation-

499

sensitive epitopes on GP IIb/IIIa. ICU COVID-19 IgG-induced PLT alterations were

500

dependent on extracellular as well as intracellular calcium levels. Since PLT

501

apoptosis has been described to be independent of calcium (33), our finding

502

indicates that COVID-19 IgGs trigger FcγRIIA -mediated events that result in

503

procoagulant PLT formation in a calcium-dependent manner. In fact, similar findings

504

were reported by recently showing that actin-mediated PLT shape change and

505

phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity in response to FcγRIIA ligation in dependent on

506

intracellular calcium (28). The absence of ICU COVID-19 IgG-mediated PLT changes

507

could be also due to inactivation of calcium dependent cysteine protease calpain that

508

is crucial for the conformational changes in GP IIb/IIIa (34, 35). Another possible

509

explanation could be the inactivation of calcium dependent TMEM16F that bears

510

essential properties for membrane phospholipid scrambling and microparticle

513

COVID-19 antibody-induced procoagulant PLTs were significantly inhibited by

514

the use of inducers of adenylate cyclase (ADC) that are well known to cause

515

increased cAMP levels in PLTs (36). The protective effect of cAMP was further

516

demonstrated, as Iloprost, an already approved prostacyclin derivate and ADC,

517

efficiently prevented the formation of procoagulant PLTs in response to COVID-19

518

antibodies. Finally and of high clinical importance, Iloprost pretreatment of PLTs

519

markedly reduced COVID-19 IgG-induced clot formation on collagen suggesting that

520

cAMP inducers may have potential to prevent life threatening thromboembolic events

521

in COVID-19 antibody-mediated coagulopathy. Another minor finding from our

522

microfluidic system was that Iloprost, although significantly inhibited antibody-

523

mediated thrombus formation, did not affect the CD62p-single positive population.

524

Since Iloprost prevented clot formation, this finding might indicate that PS rather than

525

CD62p exposure on the PLT surface is pivotal to trigger the onset of thromboembolic

526

events.

527

Our study is subjected to some limitations. First, as an observational,

528

monocentric study, we cannot conclude that the reported associations between IgG

529

antibodies and changes in activation/apoptosis markers in COVID-19 are causal for

530

the thrombosis or specific for the disease. Second, we cannot exclude the possibility

531

of remaining residual confounding or unmeasured potential confounders in our

532

mechanistic studies. Third, the low number of patients does not enable a final and

533

robust statistical analysis to assess clinical outcomes in patients with increased

534

procoagulant PLTs. Nevertheless, data presented in this study may provide a

535

background for future studies to dissect mechanisms related to PLT activation that

536

are involved in the progression of COVID-19.

537

Taken together, our study shows that IgG antibodies from patients with severe

538

COVID-19 are able to stimulate FcγRIIA leading to the induction of procoagulant

539

PLTs with an increased ability of clot formation. These processes are dependent on

540

calcium and can be efficiently inhibited by cAMP inducers suggesting that ADC might

541

represent a potentially promising target to prevent thromboembolic complications in

542

COVID-19 disease.
