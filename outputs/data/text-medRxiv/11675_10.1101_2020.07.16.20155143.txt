Abstract:
Introduction: School closures have been part of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic control measures in many
countries, based on the assumption that children play a similar role in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 as
they do in transmitting influenza virus. The contribution of schools in driving the pandemic, however,
is still unclear. We therefore performed a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study in students and teachers
at two time points in June and October 2020, respectively.
Methods: Students grade 8–11 and their teachers in 13 secondary schools in eastern Saxony,
Germany, were invited to participate in the SchoolCoviDD19 study. Blood samples were collected in
May/June 2020 after the reopening of the schools following the March 2020 lockdown, and again in
September/October 2020, 4 weeks after the end of the summer holidays. SARS-CoV-2 IgG were assed
using chemiluminescence immunoassay technology and all samples with a positive or equivocal test
result were retested with two additional serological tests.
Results: 1538 students and 507 teachers were initially enrolled, and 1334 students and 445 teachers
completed both study visits. The seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 0.6% in May/June
and the same in September/October. Even in schools with reported Covid-19 cases before the
lockdown of March 13th no clusters could be identified. Of 12 persons with positive serology 5 had a
known history of confirmed COVID-19; 23 out of 24 participants with a household history of COVID91 were seronegative. By using a combination of three different immunoassays we could exclude 16
participants with a positive or equivocal results after initial testing.
Conclusions: Schools do not play a crucial role in driving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a low
prevalence setting. Transmission in families occurs very infrequently, and the number of unreported
cases is low in this age group. These observations do not support school closures as a strategy
fighting the pandemic in a low prevalence setting.

Introduction:
Since the identification of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the
cause of COVID-19 in December 2019 1, the virus spread rapidly around the world, leading to the

pandemic control measures, with the number of countries peaking at 194 on April 10th 2020 and
more than 90% of the world’s student population being affected at this point2.
These actions were mainly based on the assumption that children play a similar role in transmitting
SARS-CoV-2 as they do in transmitting influenza during outbreaks, for which evidence exists that
school closures reduce the peak of the outbreak3. However, there is reason to believe that children
play a less significant role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission compared to influenza, making control
measures focused on this age group less effective: Most countries—including Germany—report a
much lower proportion of cases in children compared to their population size4–6. In addition a recent
report from Australia could only identify a very limited spread of COVID-19 in primary schools, with
no evidence of children infecting teachers 7.
However, currently available data is insufficient to rule out that children are as likely as adults to be
infected by and to transmit SARS-CoV-2, but simply show little to no symptoms of the disease.
We therefore aimed to quantify the proportion of adolescent schoolchildren and teachers in Saxony,
one of the eastern Federal States of Germany, that already have developed antibodies against SARSCoV-2. Until autumn 2020, in Saxony, the infection rates were comparatively low with 245laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100,000 inhabitants as of October 13th 2020.
Methods:
Study Design
After the reopening of the schools in Saxony on May 18th, 2020 students grade 8–11 and their
teachers in 13 secondary schools in eastern Saxony were invited to participate in the SchoolCoviDD19
study. After teachers, students, and their legal guardians provided informed consent, 5 mL of
peripheral venous blood were collected from each individual during visits at each participating school
between May 25th and June 30th, 2020. In addition, participants were asked to complete a
questionnaire on age, household size, previously diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections in themselves or
their household contacts, comorbidities and regular medication. Students were also asked about
regular social contacts outside their household or classroom.
A second visit and repeat blood sampling took place between September 15th and October 13th 2020.

Approval
The SchoolCoviDD19 study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Technische Universität (TU)
Dresden (BO-EK-156042020) and was registered on July 23rd 2020 and assigned the clinical trial
number DRKS00022455.

Laboratory Analysis
We assessed SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in all samples using a commercially available
chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) technology for the quantitative determination of anti-S1
and anti-S2 specific IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (Diasorin LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG Assay).
Antibody levels > 15.0 AU/ml were considered positive and levels between 12.0 and 15.0 AU/ml were
considered equivocal.
All samples with a positive or equivocal LIAISON® test result, as well as all samples from participants
with a reported personal or household history of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, were re-tested with two

additional serological tests: These were a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA)
intended for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2
(Abbott Diagnostics® ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG ) (an index (S/C) of < 1.4 was considered negative
whereas one >/= 1.4 was considered positive) and an ELISA detecting IgG against the S1 domain of
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Euroimmun® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA) (a ratio < 0.8 was considered
negative, 0.8–1.1 equivocal, > 1.1 positive)
Participants whose positive or equivocal LIAISON® test result could be confirmed by a positive test
result in at least one additional serological test were considered having antibodies against SARS-CoV2.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 25.0 and Microsoft Excel 2010. Results for continuous
variables are presented as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) and categorical variables as
numbers with percentages, unless stated otherwise.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data
interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors had full access to all the data in
the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

Results:
A total of 1538 students and 507 teachers from 13 different schools participated in the first visit of
the study, 1334 students and 445 teachers completed the second visit. Demographic data is shown in
Table 1.
Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 0.6% (12/2045) at the initial visit (May/June) with
twelve participants—eleven students and one teacher—having detectable antibodies against SARSCoV-2 in at least two different assays and thus being considered seropositive. At the follow-up visit
(September/October) seroprevalence was 0.7% (12/1779) with still eleven seropositive students and
one teacher. Remarkably, one participants who tested positive in the initial sample was no longer
positive at the second timepoint and one participant who had equivocal results initially did test
positive 3 months later. In 7 out of 13 schools, seropositive participants could be identified, with four
seropositive participants in one school as the maximum. The seroprevalence ranged from 0 to 2.2 per
individual school.
Of the few participants with a personal history of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, 4/5 were seropositive, with
the fifth showing only an equivocal test result in one of the assays. Of all participants with a
household history of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, 23/24 were seronegative, with 22/24 showing negative
results in all three assays and one showing an equivocal result in only one assay.
During the study period laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100,000 inhabitants in
Saxony increased from 139 to 245.

Discussion:
The findings from this unique study in older students and their teachers indicate that the prevalence
of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was very low after the first wave of the corona pandemic in
Germany and during the reopening of the schools in May 2020 and remained low after summer
holidays 2020. While this finding is consistent with local surveillance data8 that shows a prevalence of
PCR-confirmed cases of 0.8%, it clearly indicates that schools did not develop into silent hotspots of
SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the first wave of the pandemic and even more importantly after
reopening of the schools in May 2020. Even more important is the fact, that there was no increase in
seropositivity and infections, respectively, in the four months between May after reopening and
October after the summer holidays and the first weeks of back to school in the fall period. It has to
be pointed out, however, that the infection rate in Saxony was constantly low during this time
period. Nevertheless, the most relevant observation is that infection rates do not increase silently in
schools when infection rates in the population are low. Of course, this does not preclude that with
increasing infection rates in the population, infection rates in schools may also increase which is an
important reminder that the general population has to act prudently in order to keep schools open.
In fact, 5 of the 12 participants with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 had a personal or household
history of COVID-19, yielding a ratio of unidentified to identified cases of 2.4, which is much smaller
than that previously assumed by some authors9. We could not detect a single cluster of infections in
the participating schools, even though at least three schools did have confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases
before the March 13th lockdown in Saxony. This is consistent with findings from the 2003 SARS
outbreak 10,11, and calls the effectiveness of transmission control measures focused mainly on the
student population into question. This is especially relevant since there are clearly described adverse
effects of school closures, as loss of education, loss of social contacts and social control, nutritional
problems in children who rely on school meals, increases in harm to child welfare in vulnerable
populations, as well as economic harm caused by loss to productivity due to parents being forced
from work to childcare12,13. Additionally, even with school closures in place, social contacts continue
as informal child care and non-school gatherings14, thereby reducing the potential benefit of school
closures further. Our data support this finding this finding since an overwhelming majority of not less
than 80% of the participating students in our study reported to have regular social contacts outside
their household or classroom.

Close contact with COVID-19 patients—especially in the same household—has been shown to
increase viral transmission15. However, in our study, only one out of 24 participants with a confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same household became indeed infected as measured by antibody
production. This suggests that either the transmissibility of the virus is lower than previously

assumed or that there are certain quarantine and separation measures than can effectively reduce
the probability of viral transmission even in close contact situations.
It was reported recently, that SARS-CoV2 spike-reactive CD4+ T cells could be detected in 35% of
SARS-CoV2 unexposed healthy blood donors arguing for a certain level of T-cell crossreactivity. Such
reactions could arise from exposure to commonly encountered Corona viruses. With children being
frequently exposed to common Corona viruses it might be hypothesized that they are less
susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection due to a background of T-cell crossreactivity16.
Currently no gold standard serological testing strategy for SARS-CoV-2 exists. Even though
immunoassays yield better performance than rapid point-of-care tests15 and the targeted SARS-CoV2 S protein and nucleoprotein show a similarity of less than 30% to endemic betacoronaviruses17,
false positive results are still a concern, especially in low-prevalence populations and when
interpreting results on a personal rather than a population-based level. By using a combination of
three different immunoassays and only regarding participants with at least two positive results as
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, we could exclude ten participants with a positive and six with an
equivocal initial test by negative confirmatory testing. In our population, a positive predictive value
of 42.9% could be observed which was nearby an expected PPV of 45.3% for a prevalence of 0.59%
population and the given test characteristics (sensitivity 97.6%, specificity 99.3%). By using this
approach, we could reliably identify patients with confirmed seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2 in a
low-prevalence population.

Conclusion:
As for now, students and teacher do not seem to play a substantial role in driving the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic in Germany when observing the period after reopening of schools in May as well as after
summer holidays until early autumn 2020 before facing the second pandemic wave. Transmission in
families appears to occur very infrequently, and the number of unreported cases obviously is low in
this age group. For serological testing, a combination of different immunoassays seems to be
effective to increase the number of true positive test results.
