Abstract
The present study examines the impact of weather indicators on the COVID-19 outbreak in
the majorly affected states of India. In this study, we hypothesize that the weather indicators
could significantly influence the impact of the corona virus. The Kendall and Spearman rank
correlation tests were chosen to conduct the statistical analysis. In this regard, we compiled a
daily dataset including confirmed case counts, Recovered case counts, Deceased cases,
Average Temperature, Maximum Relative Humidity, Maximum Wind Speed for six most
affected states of

India during the period of March 25, 2020 to April 24, 2020. We

investigated that the average Humidity and Average Temperature seven days ago play a
significant role in the recovery of coronavirus cases. The rise in average temperature will
improve the recovery rate in the days to come. The cities with very high humidity levels or
dry weather conditions have high probabilities of recovery from COVID-19. The findings of
this research will help the policymakers to identify risky geographic areas and enforce timely
preventive measures.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease which initially detected in
Wuhan, China, has now spread all over the world, and if not well dealt, it could even lead to
the worldwide economic crisis. This virus exhibits high human-to-human transmissibility,
that is the reason it has spread all across the world in a very short span of time. The World
Health Organization (WHO) reported 2,626,321 COVID-19 confirmed cases and 181,938
deaths worldwide until April 24, 2020 [1]. The deadly virus has affected more than 210
countries had been affected where United States (US) alone contributed approximately onefourth of the total cases. Other major countries having a significant impact are Spain, Italy,
Iran, France, Germany, UK, Turkey, China, and many more. The situation in India has started
worsening day by day. The first COVID-19 case in India was reported on January 30, 2020
and as on April 24, 2020 India has 23077 COVID-19 confirmed cases, including 718 deaths
[1]. As per WHO, India has not entered into the state of the community transmission, still it
has clusters of cases. India had enforced nationwide lockdown from March 25, 2020 to April
14, 2020 and further extended it till May 3, 2020. The lockdown might have lowered the
transmission rate of the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 1 shows the overall picture of
confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the states of India. Many geographical, social, political,
and environmental factors might influence the impact of this deadly virus.
Earlier studies have suggested that the meteorological parameters might be active factors in
the transmission of viruses and disease emergence. Yuan et al. investigated that the peak
spread of SARS occurred in a particular range of Temperature, Relative Humidity, and Wind
Velocity [2]. Variations of absolute Humidity correlate with the onset and seasonal cycle of
influenza viral in the US. [3]. Recently, various studies have been conducted to analyze the

of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the effects of weather indicators on
COVID-19 outbreak for India. Since every state has a different geographical and political
environment, we have considered different states of India rather than on state or city. The
primary weather indicators i.e. temperature (°C), wind speed (mph), and Humidity (%) are
considered as independent variables for finding the correlation with affected cases of
COVID-19. The majority of the related recent studies have considered the metrological
indicators of the same day, which could present a false picture in terms of the correlation with
COVID-19 cases. Since the incubation period of the COVID-19 virus varies from 1 day to 14
days, we have evaluated one-week old weather indicators.
2. Materials and Method
2.1 COVID-19 Data
The data of COVID-19 cases of India corresponding to the six most impacted states
Maharashtra, Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamilnadu, and Madhya Pradesh was retrieved from
a

publicly

available

repository

and

accessible

through

this

link:

https://www.covid19india.org/. This is a volunteer-driven, crowd-sourced database being
collected and homogenized from multiple official and private web sources.
2.2 Weather Data
The weather data, including Temperature (Max, Min, Average), Humidity (Max, Min,
Average) and Wind Speed (Max, Min, Average) of cities contributing the highest number of
cases in the six most impacted states i.e. Maharashtra(Mumbai), Delhi, Rajasthan(Jaipur),
Gujarat (Ahmedabad), Madhya Pradesh (Indore), and Tamilnadu (Chennai) were retrieved
from Weather Underground (https://www.wunderground.com/). In this study, the correlation
of all these weather indicators was computed; however, for the sake of better clarity, only the
weather parameters showing significant results were shown in this paper.

24, 2020

Figure 2 shows a comprehensive combo chart showing the weather indicators (Maximum
relative Humidity, Average Wind speed, and Average Temperature) and the COVID-19
statistical indicators of the chosen six states in one glance.
2.3 Statistical analysis
The weather and COVID-19 data collected are not normally distributed; therefore Kendall
[14] and Spearman rank correlation [15] tests are considered in this study to investigate the
correlation between weather indicators and COVID-19 cases. Both of these methods are
accepted measures of non-parametric rank correlations. A null hypothesis corresponding to
each weather indicator is formulated that there is no association between individual indicators
and the three case statistics considered in this study. For all the hypothesis testing, statistical
significance was set at p-value < 0.05.
3. Results and Discussion
Table 2 highlights the Kendall and Spearman’s correlation coefficients corresponding to six
weather indicators among the confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases for the six states.

temperature 7 days ago has shown moderate correlation (0.394 < r < 0.728) with recovered
cases in four states i.e. Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh for both Kendall and
Spearman correlation test. The rise in average temperature might improve the recovery rate in
the days to come. In Rajasthan and Gujarat, average temperature 7 days ago parameter is also
associated with new confirmed cases and deceased cases. Similarly, the average temperature
same day has shown some associations with confirmed and recovered cases as posited by
[16]. These outcomes might be due to a certain profile of the temperature in these states. [17]
also reported similar findings that warm weather would play an important role in suppressing
the virus.
In this study, it has been analyzed that the states having different humidity profiles exhibit
different recovery response from COVID-19. The results show that average relative Humidity
7 days ago has a conclusive association with recovered cases in all the states. The two states
Tamilnadu and Maharashtra, where the average relative Humidity is in range ~ 65-85 % are
positively correlated with recovered cases, which implies that recovery chances are higher in
the humid environment. However, the other states where humidity levels are comparatively
low and range approximately between 20% to 60% has a negative correlation between
relative Humidity 7 days ago with the recovered cases. It can be concluded that the cities with
very high humidity levels or very low humidity levels have high probabilities of recovery
from COVID-19. By and large, the maximum relative Humidity on the same day doesn’t
exhibit a significant association with the COVID-19 cases in the duration of this study, which
contradicts the study in Iran [12] . In the time interval of this study, we observed that the
wind speed does not affect the viral spread or recovery in all the states considered.
This study has shown evidence of weather indicators correlation with COVID-19 cases;
however, there are various limitations under which this study has been conducted. The

variables such as lockdown measures, people’s individual immunity, migration index, and
other climate indicators can impact the results presented in this study.
4. Conclusions
The weather indicators can play a crucial role in the fight against coronavirus. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the impact of weather indicators on
COVID-19 incidences. This study investigates that average temperature and average relative
Humidity seven days ago are significantly correlated with the COVID-19 outbreak and will
be useful in suppressing COVID-19. In conclusion, weather indicators influence the COVID19 pandemic, potentially hot, and humid environment that can help in the recovery of the
infected patients. The present study can be further enhanced by including other parameters
such as demographic variations, healthcare infrastructure, and social policies like lockdowns
to provide better insight into the fight against COVID-19.
