ABSTRACT

65
66

Objectives: The role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in coronavirus disease 2019

67

(COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

68

CoV-2), is unknown. Understanding the immune response in COVID-19 could

69

contribute to unravel the pathogenesis and identification of treatment targets. To

70

describe the phenotypic landscape of circulating ILCs in COVID-19 patients and to

71

identify ILC phenotypes correlated to serum biomarkers, clinical markers, and

72

laboratory parameters relevant in COVID-19.

73
74

Methods: Blood samples collected from moderately (n=11) and severely ill (n=12)

75

COVID-19 patients as well as healthy control donors (n=16), were analyzed with 18-

76

parameter flow cytometry. Using supervised and unsupervised approaches, we

77

examined the ILC activation status and homing profile. Clinical and laboratory

78

parameters were obtained from all COVID-19 patients and serum biomarkers were

79

analyzed with multiplex immunoassays.

80
81

Results: ILCs were largely depleted from the circulation of COVID-19 patients

82

compared with healthy controls. Remaining circulating ILCs from patients revealed

83

increased frequencies of ILC2 in moderate COVID-19, with a concomitant decrease

84

of ILC precursors (ILCp), as compared with controls. ILC2 and ILCp showed an

85

activated phenotype with increased CD69 expression, whereas expression levels of

86

the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR4 were significantly altered in ILC2 and

87

ILCp, and ILC1, respectively. The activated ILC profile of COVID-19 patients was

88

associated with soluble inflammatory markers, while frequencies of ILC subsets were

89

correlated with laboratory parameters that reflect the disease severity.

90
91

Conclusion: This study provides insights into the potential role of ILCs in immune

92

responses against SARS-CoV-2, particularly linked to the severity of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

98

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute

99

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is of global concern and major

100

efforts to identify effective treatments and vaccines are currently underway1–4. SARS-

101

CoV-2 affects mainly the respiratory tract and infected individuals often present with

102

flu-like symptoms. While some patients recover within weeks, others progress to a

103

severe stage of disease, typically including severe respiratory distress and hypoxia

104

with later multi-organ failure, occasionally leading to death5,6. Notably, a gradual

105

progression to more severe disease stages coincides with the development of a

106

hyperactivated immune response, triggering a systemic cytokine storm circulatory

107

impairment, sometimes leading to circulatory shock7–9. Thus, there are reasons to

108

believe that immunopathology involving the innate immune system plays a potent role

109

behind severe morbidity and mortality in the critically ill COVID-19 patients. Currently,

110

little information is available on the role of innate immune cells in COVID-19.

111

Therefore, here we studied the role of innate lymphoid cell (ILC) in hospitalized

112

COVID-19 patients.

113

ILCs are innate lymphocytes which, unlike T- and B-cells, lack rearranged

114

antigen specific receptors and cell surface markers associated with other lymphoid

115

and myeloid lineages10. ILCs are categorized into five major groups: natural killer (NK)

116

cells, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3 and Lymphoid Tissue Inducer (LTi) cells10. Based on their

117

transcription factor dependence and functional characteristics, ILC111,12, ILC213–15 and

118

ILC316 are considered the innate counterparts of the specialized subsets of CD4+ T

119

cells, i.e. Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells, respectively, while NK cells mirror the cytotoxic

120

functions of CD8+ T cells10. Although ILCs exert their function primarily in tissues,

121

distinct subsets of ILCs are found circulating in blood17,18. The major blood ILC

122

population is the precursor ILC (ILCp), with the capacity to home to peripheral tissues

123

and differentiate to mature ILC subsets18. However, human blood also harbors the

124

committed ILC lineages ILC1 and ILC2. ILC2 in blood express CRTH2 and CD161

125

and are dependent on the GATA binding protein-3 (GATA-3) transcription factor19.

126

IFN-γ-producing ILCs, reminiscent of ILC1, have been identified in peripheral blood20.

127

While their characterization has been challenging due to the lack of unique surface

128

markers21, studies have shown that blood ILC1 that produce IFN-g express the

4

129

chemokine receptor CXCR320. Hence, CXCR3 serves as a marker to define the ILC1

130

subset in peripheral blood.

131

While little is known regarding ILCs in the context of human respiratory viral

132

infections, studies performed in mice highlight their contribution during acute viral

133

infection. More specifically, ILC2 have been suggested to accumulate in the lung of

134

influenza virus-infected mice and promote lung homeostasis and tissue repair22. In

135

contrast, ILC2 in concordance with T cells, were reported to contribute to allergic

136

airway inflammation induced by influenza virus in mice23. In humans, ILCs have been

137

investigated in acutely HIV-1-infected individuals where they were found to be

138

depleted from the circulation24. To the best of our knowledge, ILCs have not yet been

139

investigated in a human respiratory viral disease.

140

Understanding the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 is urgently needed in

141

order to help tackle the current pandemic. In the present study, we report a profound

142

reduction in number of ILCs within the systemic circulation of COVID-19 patients. The

143

remaining ILCs show dysregulated expression of markers associated with activation

144

and migration. Furthermore, ILC frequencies are correlated to clinical parameters

145

related to COVID-19 disease severity.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

148
149

Study participants and sampling

150

As a part of the Karolinska KI/K COVID-19 Immune Atlas, 23 COVID-19

151

patients (6 females and 17 males; median age 57 years; age range 18 - 74 years)

152

positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by diagnostic RT-qPCR and hospitalized at the

153

Karolinska University Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden) were included in the present

154

study. Patients were classified as COVID-19 moderate (n=11) and severe (n=12),

155

based on the peak supplementary oxygen received during hospitalization until the time

156

of inclusion in the study. The moderate group required low or no supplementary

157

oxygen (low oxygen flow, ≤15L/min), out of whom 8 were hospitalized in the regular

158

ward and 3 in the intensive care unit (ICU). These patients had median ordinal scale

159

of 5 (IQR 4-5) at sampling. The severe group consisted of patients that were

160

hospitalized in the ICU and required mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal

161

membrane oxygenation (ECMO; one patient) provided within an intensive care setting.

162

These patients had a median ordinal scale score of 7 (IQR 7-7) at sampling. This

163

classification was in line with the 8-category ordinal scale described by Beigel et al as

164

well as in the WHO guidelines25,26.

165

Peripheral blood sample from all COVID-19 patients was collected 5 to 24 days

166

(median 14 days; IQR 5-24 days) after symptom debut and 0 to 8 days after

167

hospitalization.

168

Sixteen donors (6 females and 10 males; median age 54 years; age range

169

between 34 - 69 years), all SARS-CoV-2 IgG seronegative and symptom-free at the

170

day of sampling, were included as a control group for this study. Detailed donor

171

characteristics are summarized in Tables 1-2.

172

This study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority and

173

conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients or next of kin and

174

control donors provided oral and/or written informed consent in line with the ethical

175

approval.

176
177

Serum collection and cell isolation from whole blood

178

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from control donors and COVID-

179

19 patients were isolated from heparinized anti-coagulated blood in SepMate tubes

180

(Stemcell Technologies) using gradient density centrifugation, according to

181

manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 15ml of LymphoprepTM (Stemcell Technologies)

182

was pipetted below the SepMate insert and 20ml of diluted whole blood was dispensed

183

on top. Tubes were centrifuged at 1200 g for 10 min. The supernatant including

184

PBMCs was carefully decanted into a new tube, followed by two washes with PBS

185

containing 10% FCS. Platelets were removed by centrifuging the samples at 400 g

186

for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended, cells counted and subsequently stained for flow

187

cytometry.

188

Serum was collected from COVID-19 patients and control donors in BD

189

Vacutainer serum tubes with spray-coated silica (BD Biosciences). After coagulation

190

for up to 2 hours at room temperature (RT), serum was isolated by centrifugation at

191

2000 g for 10 min and immediately stored at -80 ºC for later analysis.

192
193

Cell staining and flow cytometry analysis

194

Freshly isolated PBMCs were stained with dead cell marker (Invitrogen) and

195

fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies directed against intracellular and surface markers

196

(See Table S1 in the Online Repository) for 20 min at RT in the dark. Cells were

197

washed two times with 150 ul of PBS with 10% FCS. Next, pellets were resuspended

198

in 100 ul of BD FACS Lysing Solution (BD Biosciences) and incubated for 10 min at

199

RT, for cell fixation. After washing with PBS with 10% FCS, cells were permeabilized

200

using 100 ul of BD Perm2 Permeabilizing Solution (BD Biosciences) for 10 min at RT.

201

Subsequently, antibodies were added for intracellular staining and incubated for 30

202

min at RT in the dark. Cells were then washed with 150 ul of PBS with 10% FCS and

203

incubated in a 1% formaldehyde solution for 2h, washed and resuspended in PBS

204

containing 10% FCS.

205

The antibodies and dead cell marker used for flow cytometry staining are listed

206

in Supplementary Table III. Samples were acquired on a BD LSR FortessaTM. Flow

207

cytometric analysis was performed using FlowJo version 10.6.2 (TreeStar).

208
209

UMAP analysis

210

To ensure unbiased manual gating, a blinded analysis was implemented,

211

whereby all FCS3.0 files were renamed and coded by one person and blindly analyzed

212

by another person. All samples were compensated electronically and gatings were

213

based on fluorescent-minus-one (FMO) or negative controls. After all gatings were

214

performed, samples were decoded and statistical analysis between groups and

215

unsupervised analysis was performed. For unsupervised analysis, the following

216

FlowJo plugins were used: DownSample (v.1.1), UMAP (v.2.2), Phenograph (v.2.4)

217

and ClusterExplorer (v.1.2.2) (all FlowJo LLC). First, 133 events per patients were

218

downsampled from the total ILC gate (Fig. 2SB). The new generated FCS files were

219

labelled according to control or patient group (moderate or severe COVID-19) and

220

concatenated per group. Subsequently, all groups were taken to the same number of

221

events, by downsampling to the number of events present in the group with the least

222

number of events. The three new FCS files corresponding to control, moderate and

223

severe COVID-19 patients were then concatenated for dimensionality reduction

224

analysis using UMAP. UMAP was run including the markers CRTH2, CD161, CD117,

225

CD69, HLA-DR, Ki-67, CD45RA, CD62L, CCR4, CCR6, CXCR3, CD56, NKp44 and

226

using the following parameters: metric = euclidean, nearest neighbors = 15, and

227

minimum distance = 0.5. Clusters of phenotypically related cells were identified using

228

Phenograph plugin and including the same markers as for UMAP and parameters k =

229

30 and Run ID = auto. Finally, ClusterExplorer plugin was used to study the phenotype

of the different clusters and to generate heatmaps of marker expression from those

231

clusters.

232
233

Absolute cell counts

234

Absolute numbers of ILCs in peripheral blood were obtained using BD

235

Multitest™ 6-color TBNK reagents with bead-containing BD Trucount™ tubes (BD

236

Biosciences), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 50 µL of anti-

237

coagulated whole blood were added into Trucount tubes within 3h after blood

238

extraction. Then, an antibody mix was added for staining. After 15 minutes of

239

incubation at RT in the dark, stained whole blood was fixed and red blood cells lysed

240

with 1X BD FACS Lysing Solution (BD Biosciences) for 2h at RT. Samples were then

241

fixed with 1% PFA for 2h prior to acquisition in a FACSymphony A5 (BD Biosciences)

242

flow cytometer. Absolute ILC cell counts were calculated using the formula:

243

ILC (#/mL) = [(# lymphocytes events acquired * total #beads in tube * 1000) /

244

(#beads acquired * volume of whole blood stained (µL))] * % ILC out of lymphocytes.

245

ILC1, ILC2 and ILCp absolute counts were calculated using their frequencies relative

246

to total ILCs.

247
248

Analysis of serum biomarkers

249

Heat-inactivated (56°C for 30 min) serum from all patients and controls were

250

analyzed for soluble protein biomarkers using proximity extension assay (PEA)

251

technology (Olink AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The samples were analyzed using the

252

inflammation (v.3022) panel, including a total of 92 analytes. Data are expressed as

253

normalized protein expression (NPX) values. NPX is an arbitrary unit on a Log2 scale

254

to normalize data to minimize both intra-assay and inter-assay variation.

255

Additionally, several soluble analytes were also measured in serum or plasma

256

by use of custom made multiplex Magnetic Luminex Screening assays (R&D

257

Systems), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Serum and plasma were

258

diluted 1:2 prior to analysis in multiplex.

259

Analytes from Olink data and Magnetic Luminex Screening assays that had

260

more than 33% and 25% of missing values, respectively, were excluded from analysis.

261

Left-censored data from the multiplex analysis were imputed using GSimp package27

262

in R (v. 3.6.0)28.

Clinical parameters and serology
Serum samples from all patients and controls were analyzed for presence of
SARS-CoV- 2 antibodies, as recently described29.

267

Micro-neutralization assay for measurement of neutralizing antibody titers was

268

performed as previously described30. Briefly, heat inactivated serum (56°C for 30

269

minutes) was diluted two-fold starting at 1:10, mixed with an equal volume of 200

270

TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 (50 µl diluted serum plus 50 µl virus) and incubated for 1 hour

271

at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Mixtures were then added to Vero E6 cells and incubated at

272

37 °C 5% CO2 for four days. Cells were inspected for signs of cytopathic effect (CPE)

273

by optical microscopy. Results were expressed as the arithmetic mean of the

274

reciprocals of the highest neutralizing dilutions from the two duplicates for each

275

sample.

276
277

Statistical analysis

278

Statistical analyses were performed using Prism version 8.4.3 (GraphPad

279

Software Inc.). For comparisons between three unpaired groups, Kruskal-Wallis test

280

followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons test was used. Correlation analyses were

281

performed using Spearman’s rank correlation. Spearman’s correlation matrix was

282

generated with R (v.4.0.2) using package corrplot (v.0.84). Statistical significance for

283

differences between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls was determined by two-

284

sided Mann-Whitney U test. p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

285

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed in R (v.4.0.2; R Core Team,

286

2020) using packages Factoextra (v.1.0.7)31, FactoMineR (v.2.3)32, RColorBrewer

287

(v.1.1-2)33, and ggplot2 (v.3.3.2)34. Data was normalized in R using the scale argument

288

within the PCA function. Where data was missing, the values were imputed using

289

package WaverR (v1.0)35 using 1000 repetitions.

290
291

RESULTS

292

A total of twenty-three patients with either moderate (n=11) or severe (n=12)

293

COVID-19 and sixteen control donors were included in the study (Fig. 1A). The

294

COVID-19 patients showed profound perturbations in inflammatory markers,

295

coagulation factors, organ/muscle damage markers as well as biochemical and

296

hematological parameters (Fig. S1). A detailed summary of the patients’ clinical and

297

laboratory parameters is presented in Tables 1-2. A timeline summarizing the major

298

clinical events of the patients is shown in Fig. 1B.

299

For the identification and analysis of peripheral blood ILCs we used 18-

300

parameter flow cytometry and a modification of a well-established gating strategy36

301

(Fig. S2A). We found that the relative frequencies and absolute counts of total CD127+

302

ILCs (hereafter referred to as total ILCs), as well as the absolute counts of the specific

303

subsets ILC1, ILC2 and ILCp, were decreased in peripheral blood of COVID-19

304

patients as compared with controls (Fig. 2A-D). Further characterization of the

305

remaining circulating ILC compartment showed reduced ILCp frequencies in COVID-

306

19 patients, while the frequencies of ILC1 remained unchanged (Fig. 2C and E). Of

307

note, the moderately ill group showed elevated frequencies of both total ILC2 (Fig. 2E)

308

and CD117- ILC2, as compared with the control group (Fig. 2F).

309

Taken together, we observed a general ILC depletion as well as compositional

310

changes in the circulating ILC compartment of COVID-19 patients. Interestingly,

311

changes in the relative frequency of ILCs differed between the moderate and severe

312

group, prompting a more detailed phenotypical study of the ILCs.

313

To deepen our understanding of the differentiation, activation, and migration of

314

ILCs during COVID-19, we assessed differentiation (CD56 and NKp44) (Fig. S3A and

315

B) and activation (CD69, HLA-DR and Ki-67) markers as well as chemokine receptors

316

(CCR4, CCR6 and CXCR3) and molecules associated with naivety and homing to

317

lymphoid tissues (CD45RA and CD62L) on ILCs (Fig. 3A-H). Manual gating and

318

unbiased principal component analysis (PCA) were used to simultaneously take into

319

account the relative frequency of all the markers measured on ILCs.

320

This approach revealed a higher relative frequency of CD69-expressing total

321

ILCs in patients as compared with controls (Fig. 3A). Additionally, Ki-67, a marker of

322

cell proliferation, was increased in severe compared with moderate COVID-19 but

323

decreased in moderate COVID-19 compared with controls (Fig. 3A). However, the

324

overall Ki-67 expression level was low in all ILCs regardless of the study group,

325

suggesting either a low proliferating capacity of ILCs in peripheral blood or migration

326

of proliferative ILCs to tissues at an earlier stage. In line with an increase in CD69 in

327

COVID-19 patients, we detected reduced frequencies of total ILCs expressing

328

CD45RA and CD62L, two markers associated with ILC naivety18, in severe COVID-19

329

patients (Fig. 3A). Additionally, we observed alterations in chemokine receptor

expression between controls and moderate COVID-19 patients, revealing a reduction

331

in the percentage of CXCR3+ and an increase in CCR4+ ILCs. The latter likely reflects

332

the increase in ILC2 frequencies in these patients (Fig. 2E), as CCR4 is particularly

333

highly expressed on ILC2 (Fig. 3E). Despite these changes in ILC phenotypes, the

334

PCA analysis could not discriminate between COVID-19 patients and controls on the

335

basis of the total ILC data (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the COVID-19 related changes in

336

total ILCs are ILC subset specific.

337

Indeed, we observed no changes in expression of markers associated with

338

differentiation and activation in ILC1. There was, however, a slightly increased

339

percentage of CCR4+ ILC1 cells in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (Fig. 3C).

340

We also detected a reduction of CD56+ ILC1 in COVID-19 patients (Fig. S3A). PCA

341

analysis illustrated these differences well, showing segregation of the ILC1 data on

342

the basis of CCR4 for COVID-19 patients and CD56 for controls (Fig. 3D).

343

In contrast, ILC2 displayed an activated phenotype in COVID-19 patients,

344

showing higher frequencies of CD69+ and a tendency towards reduced frequencies of

345

CD62L+ cells, as compared with controls (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, Ki-67, generally

346

expressed at very low levels, was decreased in relative frequency in ILC2 from severe

347

COVID-19 patients compared to the control group, possibly reflecting tissue

348

recruitment of such cells in severe COVID-19. Indeed, we identified dysregulated

349

chemokine receptor expression on ILC2 in COVID-19 patients, specifically CXCR3

350

which was reduced in the patients as compared with controls (Fig. 3E). PCA analysis

351

provided an illustration of these findings by segregating the ILC2 data from patients

352

and controls based on CD69 expression for patients and chemokine receptors as well

353

as CD62L and CD45RA for the controls (Fig. 3F). The latter two were, however, not

354

statistically different between the groups (Fig. 3E).

355

ILCp showed an activated profile in COVID-19 patients, with increased CD69

356

and HLA-DR expression as compared with controls. Additionally, CXCR3 was

357

decreased on ILCp in COVID-19 patients as compared with controls (Fig. 3G).

358

Although PCA analysis did not separate the ILCp phenotype from patients and controls

359

clearly, there was a tendency towards separation of ILCp from controls on the basis

360

of CD62L and CD45RA (Fig. 3H). These two markers showed reduced tendency but

361

were not statistically significant in the manual gating (Fig. 3G).

362

Overall, these findings suggest that the ILCs remaining in the circulation of

363

COVID-19 patients are activated and show an altered expression of chemokine

364

receptors, particularly a decrease in CXCR3, possibly reflecting alterations in CXCR3-

365

ligand dependent ILC recruitment to tissues.

366

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis confirmed

367

and extended the findings obtained by manual gating in an unsupervised manner. As

368

expected from manual gating, clear differences in ILC composition between controls

369

and COVID-19 patients were observed when overlaying each group to the UMAP

370

containing all concatenated ILC events (Fig. 4A, S2B). Phenograph clustering yielded

371

a total of 14 distinct clusters across patients and controls (Fig. 4B). Based on the

372

relative expression of CRTH2, CD117 and CXCR3, clusters were identified as ILC1,

373

ILC2 or ILCp (Fig. 4C-D). Thereafter, manually defined ILC subset gates that were

374

overlayed into the UMAP (Fig. 4E) showed a similar spatial distribution as the

375

Phenograph-defined clusters belonging to each ILC subset, confirming the precision

376

of the manual gating relative to the unsupervised analysis (Fig. 4B).

377

Next, we assessed each Phenograph-defined cluster. Validating the manual

378

gating, CCR4+ ILC1 (cluster 14) was uniquely present in COVID-19 patients, while two

379

additional CCR4-/lo ILC1 clusters (2 and 6) were overrepresented in severe COVID-19

380

patients (Fig. 4F, G). For ILC2, cluster 8, containing CCR4hi ILC2, was only present in

381

COVID-19 patients and other two CCR6+ ILC2 clusters (10, 12) were accumulated in

382

moderate patients (Fig. 4F, H). Corroborating again the findings from manual gating

383

(Fig. 3), cluster 3, uniquely present in COVID-19 patients, corresponded to activated

384

(CD69+) ILCp lacking CXCR3 (Fig. 4F, I). Furthermore, three ILCp clusters (1, 5, and

385

7) with an immature phenotype (CD45RA+/hi/CD62L+/hi) were reduced in COVID-19

386

patients as compared with controls (Fig. 4F, I), in support of the data obtained by

387

manual gating (Fig. 3).

388

Altogether,

the

unsupervised

analysis

revealed

clusters

specifically

389

accumulated in COVID-19 patients compared to controls and the presence of specific

390

ILC phenotypes that associated to the disease severity. Importantly, several of the

391

findings agreed with those obtained by manual gating. Specifically, we confirmed an

392

increase in the relative frequency of CD69+ ILCp and a decrease in CXCR3+ ILCp in

393

both moderate and severe COVID-19, an increase in ILC2 percentage specifically in

394

moderate COVID-19 and an increased CCR4 expression among ILC1 in the patients.

395

To analyze for potential factors involved in the activation and potential

396

recruitment of ILCs to tissues in the COVID-19 patients, we examined correlations

397

between ILCs and a wide array of soluble serum factors (Fig. S5A-B). Based on our

398

findings on altered frequencies of CXCR3+ and CD69+ ILCs in COVID-19 (Fig. 3A),

399

we focused on selected chemokines (CCL20, CXCL10 and CXCL11) and factors

400

previously reported to be increased in COVID-19 or other viral respiratory disease: IL-

401

6, IL-10, IL18R1 and PD-L17–9,37–42. Interestingly, we found that the percentage of

402

activated (CD69+) total ILCs and activated ILCp positively correlated with serum IL-6

403

levels in the COVID-19 patients (Fig. 5A). Additionally, the relative levels of the

404

cytokine IL-10 also positively correlated with the levels of CD69+ ILCs in the COVID-

405

19 patients (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the percentage of CD69+ total ILCs and ILCp

406

positively correlated with CXCL10 levels in the COVID-19 patients (Fig. 5C),

407

suggesting that this chemokine is related to the increase in the percentage of activated

408

ILCs that remain in the circulation of COVID-19 patients.

409

Furthermore, indicative of dysregulated ILC tissue migration in COVID-19, we

410

observed a negative correlation of CXCL10 and CXCL11 levels (CXCR3 ligands), with

411

the percentage of CXCR3+ ILCs in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 5D). Additionally, the

412

percentage of CCR4+ total ILCs and ILC2 negatively correlated with CCL20 (ligand for

413

CCR6) levels. The latter correlation is in line with the high expression of CCR6 on

414

circulating ILC2 (ref. 17) (Fig. 5E).

415

Of further interest, IL18R1 and PD-L1, involved in type 1-inflammation40,43

416

negatively correlated with the level of CD45RA+ ILCp, suggesting that the

417

inflammatory status of COVID-19 patients may promote maturation, depletion and/or

418

tissue migration of ILCp in the systemic circulation (Fig. S5C).

419

We next sought to integrate our flow cytometric data with the clinical and

420

laboratory findings from the same patients. Clinical information and laboratory

421

measurements (summarized in Tables 1-2) integrated in a PCA analysis clustered the

422

patients on the basis of disease severity (Fig. 6A) with several hematological and

423

biochemical factors particularly driving this separation (Fig. 6B).

424

We searched for potentially relevant correlations between ILCs and the clinical

425

and laboratory parameters. The frequencies of ILC1 and ILC2 correlated with several

426

of the measured parameters, whereas no correlations were found for ILCp frequencies

427

(Fig. S3B). The percentage of ILC1 positively correlated with LDH levels, which was

428

significantly increased in severe COVID-19 patients (Fig. 6C, Fig. S1). ILC1

429

frequencies also positively correlated with parameters that did not differ between the

430

two COVID-19 patient groups, i.e. platelet counts, serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels and

431

days post symptom debut (Fig. 6C). The percentage of ILC2, on the other hand,

432

negatively correlated with the leukocyte, neutrophil and platelet count (Fig. 6D).

433

Interestingly, high neutrophil levels, which have been described as partial predictors

434

of disease severity44, also contributed heavily to the separation between patient

435

groups in the current study (Fig. 6A-B). Of note, neutrophils have been found to inhibit

436

ILC2 function, thus preventing allergic airway inflammation45. Additionally, the relative

437

frequency of ILC2 correlated negatively with levels of D-dimer, a coagulation factor

438

that has been suggested as a systemic biomarker of disease severity in COVID-19

439

(Fig. 6D)44,46. Finally, we observed a negative correlation between ILC2 frequencies

440

and organ/muscle damage markers (myoglobin, troponin T, LDH) and the number of

441

days since symptom debut (Fig. 6D). These findings suggest that among COVID-19

442

patients, elevated frequencies of ILC1 and decreased frequencies of ILC2 are

443

hallmarks of COVID-19 patients with a clinical profile associated with severe disease.

444
445

DISCUSSION

446

We report unphysiologically-reduced levels of ILCs in the circulation of COVID-

447

19 patients, both in percentage and absolute counts, in line with a recent report47, and

448

the overall reduction of peripheral blood lymphocytes described in COVID-196,38,48,49.

449

In addition to the overall ILC depletion, we found major changes in the residual

450

circulating ILC compartment in COVID-19 patients, including altered frequencies of

451

ILC subsets, increased activation and dysregulated migration receptor expression.

452

Our data imply that the circulating ILCs are activated and have differentiated and/or

453

are differentially recruited to tissues where they may contribute to the anti-viral

454

defense.

455

Noteworthy, we found increased circulating ILC2 frequencies in moderate but

456

not severe COVID-19 patients, suggesting that ILC2 may be differentially regulated

457

dependent on severity of disease. Supporting this, the relative frequency of ILC2 in

458

COVID-19 patients correlated negatively with the coagulation factor D-dimer,

459

previously shown to be associated with the development of severe disease44,46 as well

460

as organ/muscle damage markers, suggesting that low ILC2 levels in COVID-19

461

patients could be indicative of a more severe disease outcome. Indeed, ILC2 have

462

been shown to have a prominent role in lung tissue repair during influenza A infection

463

in mice22. This was achieved through production of the epidermal growth factor related

464

protein amphiregulin, also shown to be involved in promotion of regulatory T cells and

465

cell survival in hepatitis C virus infection50,51. The role for ILC2-derived amphiregulin

466

in lung tissue repair in humans is unknown and deserves further exploration in COVID-

467

19.

468

In contrast to ILC2, ILCp frequencies were diminished in COVID-19 patients as

469

compared with controls, suggesting their migration to the site of infection or

470

differentiation into mature ILC subsets in the circulation. This has previously been

471

described in an adoptive transfer mouse model18. In support of this hypothesis, both

472

ILC2 and ILCp showed an activated phenotype, based on increased frequencies of

473

CD69+ and/or HLA-DR+ cells. This is in line with the recent discovery of increased

474

frequencies of CD69+ NK cells in COVID-1952. Interestingly, in addition to its known

475

role as an early activation marker, CD69 is also a marker of tissue residency53. Thus,

476

the presence of the CD69-expressing ILCs in circulation could also indicate retrograde

477

migration from tissue to circulation after local tissue activation, as recently shown for

478

resident memory T cells54. Furthermore, we observed that the CD69-expressing cells

479

in the circulation of COVID-19 patients positively correlated with the levels of IL-6 and

480

IL-10, suggesting that the inflammatory status in these patients could be the driver of

481

ILC activation and/or recirculation. Additionally, these CD69-expressing cells

482

positively correlated with the chemokine CXCL10 in patients. In contrast, CXCR3+

483

ILCs negatively correlated with CXCR3 ligands CXCL10 and CXCL11, potentially

484

indicating a CXCR3-dependent tissue migration of ILCs in COVID-19. CXCR3+ ILCs

485

includes IFN-g producing ILC1 (ref. 11,20), which are accumulated in acute and

486

chronic intestinal inflammation in humans11. While ILC1 are essential for clearance of

487

cytomegalovirus in mice55, the role for ILC1 in human anti-viral immunity, including

488

COVID-19, remains obscure and requires further exploration.

489

Lastly, the phenotypic characterization of circulating ILCs performed in this

490

study would benefit from additional analyses delineating the functionality of ILCs as

491

well as the impact of the tissue microenvironment to their phenotype and function. Of

492

special interest would be the study of ILCs from tissue resident sites, such as lung and

493

intestine, which have been described as main sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection and

494

shedding56–59. We have previously reported increased ILC2 frequencies in the

495

intestine of patients with inflammatory bowel disease17 and in the lungs of patients with

496

asthma60, likely due to their influx from the circulation. In line with this, it is possible

497

that the lower ILC frequencies observed in severe as compared with moderate COVID-

498

19 patients could indicate potential trafficking of ILC2 to inflamed infection sites. To

499

address whether elevated levels of circulating ILC2 constitute a correlate of protection

500

in COVID-19 patients, further studies at the tissue level are required.

501

In summary, this study provides a phenotypic characterization of circulating

502

ILCs of COVID-19 patients. We identified that altered frequencies of ILCs correlate

503

with clinical and laboratory parameters linked to COVID-19 disease severity. Lastly, to

504

the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of ILCs in the context

505

of a human respiratory viral infection. Thus, these data pave the way for a better

506

understanding of the role of this innate immune cell compartment in other viral

507

infectious diseases.

832

Patients with less than 10 events per ILC subsets (defined by Phenograph-identified

833

clusters) were excluded from analysis. Statistical differences were tested using the

834

Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons test. Bar graphs are

835

shown as median ± IQR, *p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
