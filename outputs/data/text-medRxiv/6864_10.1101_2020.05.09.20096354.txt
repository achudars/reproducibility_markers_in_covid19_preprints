Abstract
The accepted gold standard for diagnosing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the detection of
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA from nasopharyngeal
swabs (NPS). However, shortage of reagents has made NPS collection challenging, and alternative
samples need to be explored. Due to its non-invasive nature, saliva has considerable diagnostic
potential. Therefore, to guide diagnostic laboratories globally, we conducted a systematic review
to determine the utility of saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. A systematic search of major
databases (PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) was performed to identify
published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. There was a total of 10 publications that fit the criteria for
review. Most studies collected drooled whole saliva from hospitalized patients or pipetted saliva
from intubated patients. Saliva was positive in 31-92% of patients depending on the cohort and
length of hospitalization. Viral loads in saliva are comparable to those in NPS and ranged from
9.9 × 102 to 1.2 × 108 copies/mL during the first week of symptoms and decrease over time. Saliva
can be positive up to 20 days post-symptom onset with viral loads correlating with symptom
severity and degree of tissue damage. Based on these findings, we made suggestions to guide the
clinical laboratory and suggest the need for diagnostic accuracy studies for the detection of SARSCoV-2 from saliva.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the entire world, especially the most
vulnerable population (i.e. the elderly living in nursing homes).

The high demand of

nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), and the low supply of laboratory reagents and test kits highlight the
need for alternative methods to facilitate accurate universal screening of COVID-19.

The

aetiological agent of COVID-19 is the novel Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus, severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Hubei Province,
China (1, 2). SARS-CoV-2 is a large, roughly spherical, enveloped virus, with a non-segmented
positive-sense strand RNA genome ~30 kb in length (3). Since the initial outbreak, clinical
symptoms have ranged from mild to severe atypical pneumonia with the disease spreading through
human-to-human transmission (1). With an estimated incubation period of 5.1 days, and less than
2.5% of individuals displaying symptoms within 2.2 days of exposure, asymptomatic spread is
possible, especially in children and healthy adults (4). The community transmission of SARSCoV-2, especially asymptomatic spread, can be detrimental to both acute care hospitals and
community settings, such as nursing homes. Therefore, robust diagnostics algorithms for SARSCoV-2 are essential to quarantine infected individuals to prevent the spread of disease.

The current gold standard to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA is by reverse transcription real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-rtPCR) in NPS. NPS is invasive to collect, and due to widespread
universal testing and a huge strain on supply lines, alternative diagnostic algorithms are needed
(5-7). Saliva has considerable diagnostic potential: it is non-invasive, abundant, easily collected,
and representative of oral and systemic health (8). The use of saliva looks promising as SARSCoV-2 RNA is present in saliva with loads and sensitivity comparable to NPS (9-11). However,

salivary endonucleases make proper sample handling critical for accurate testing (12). Therefore,
we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the potential of using saliva for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 and make suggestions for the clinical diagnostic labotatory.

Methodology
Literature Search and Selection Criteria
This scoping review follows the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Metanalysis (PRISMA). A systematic search was performed on four major databases
(PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) by two independent reviewers to
identify articles published in English prior to April 25, 2020 to answer, “Can saliva be used for to
detect SARS-CoV-2 and diagnose COVID-19?” The systematic search was performed using the
following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords: "COVID-19" OR "COVID2019" OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" OR "2019-nCoV" OR "SARS-CoV2" AND "saliva". Manuscripts were included if they aligned with the following PECOS (Patient,
Exposure, Comparator and Outcome) guidelines: (P) male or female of any age group visiting the
Emergency Department; (E) SARS-CoV-2 infected; (C) Systematically healthy patients as control;
(O) salivary viral load. Manuscripts were excluded if they were letters to the editor, perspectives
or review papers. Given the explosion of new research, preprints were included from BioRxiv and
medRxiv if the inclusion criteria were met. Both reviewers mutually agreed to use the same
inclusion and exclusion criteria for the search, and disagreements were resolved by discussion.
Ethics approval was not required.

Data Extraction
Data extraction was performed independently by two investigators and confirmed by a third. Each
study was examined for saliva sampling protocol, nucleic acid extraction procedure, SARS-CoV2 detection, and primary findings. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

Results
Search Results and Cohorts Studied
We identified 25 potential articles from database searches that investigated the detection of SARSCoV-2 in saliva (Figure 1). After removing the duplicates and reviewing the abstracts for inclusion
and exclusion criteria, the full-text of 10 papers were scrutinized for this systematic review.
Studies were from China (n=10), Italy (n=2), USA (n=1) and South Korea (n=1). Apart from case
reports, studies enrolled hospitalized patients and compared saliva to NPS for the initial diagnosis
and viral load monitoring. Apart for two studies, study cohorts were small (range: 12-44) with a
relatively equal number of males and females with an average age of 61 years (range: 18-92 years)
(Table 1). The specimen collected varied by study and included saliva (n=6), sputum or deep
saliva (n=4), and oropharyngeal swabs (OPS, n=3). No study revealed transportation or storage
conditions. There is great variation in the extraction and amplification kits used, but most
extractions were performed manually with commercial spin columns (n=6), and two studies did
automated extraction with the NucliSENS® easyMag® (9, 13). PCR amplification was performed
with a mix of lab-developed tests (LDT, n=6) and commercial assays (n=4) targeting a wide range
of genes.

Salivary Diagnostics
Despite the heterogeneity of oral samples used, based on these limited studies, it is evident that
saliva is comparable, if not superior to NPS for initial detection of SARS-CoV-2 upon
hospitalization and is more consistent for monitoring viremia. In most comparative studies,
drooled saliva had higher positivity rates than deep saliva/sputum and was useful from initial
screening to intubation. Positivity of saliva was 31-92% depending on the cohort and length of
hospitalization. Viral load in saliva was highest during the first week of symptom onset, ranging
from 9.9 × 102 to 1.2 × 108 copies/mL, and then gradually declined (9, 14). At initial screening
viral loads and positivity rates were comparable to NPS, but one study found salivary loads were
five-times higher than in NPS (15). Higher salivary viral loads were also found in patients with
more severe disease (16) and correlated to tissue damage (17).

In a study screening 98

asymptomatic health care workers all NPS were negative, but two were positive in saliva (15).
Studies monitoring viral loads reported that initially saliva was comparable to NPS, but over time
NPS became negative while saliva remained positive up to 20 days post-symptom onset, even after
respiratory symptoms became negative. However, after the first week positivity rates in saliva
decreased, and positivity in anal swabs increased, suggesting a possible shift in viral infection as
disease progresses (18).

Discussion
Initial studies examining the utility of saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA are
comparable, if not superior to NPS for screening and monitoring viral loads. With NPS reagents
increasingly in short supply, saliva is a possible alternative sample for diagnostic algorithms.

through the mouth, nose or eyes (10). SARS-CoV-2 infects human epithelial cells through the
host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), which is expressed on cells lining the
lungs, oral buccal and gingiva (19). This infectious virion is both detectable in saliva and
culturable on Vero E6 cells making saliva both a non-invasive sample that is easy to collect but
also a potential exposure risk for front-line healthcare workers (9).

SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in a variety of oral samples, including whole saliva, oral swabs,
oropharyngeal swabs, and deep saliva/sputum. There is a wide range of commercially available
saliva collection devices but given the high sampling demand and limited stocks of swabs, 1-3 mL
of unstimulated whole saliva expectorated into a sterile urine container or 50 mL conical tube is
the easiest and most reliable sample to collect, unless the patient is a hyposalivator or intubated.
For an intubated patient, young child, or elderly person pipetted saliva or oral swab placed in 1
mL viral transport media (VTM) will suffice (17, 20). Saliva should always be collected before
or 30-60 minutes after eating, drinking, smoking or chewing gum with the mouth rinsed with water
prior to collection to void the mouth of debris (21). If a patient is having difficulty salivating
rubbing the outside of the cheek may help. As sample positivity is essential in hospitalized
patients, due to the effect of diurnal variation on levels of salivary biomarkers, two studies
collected saliva first thing in the morning prior to food or brushing of teeth (14, 15). The other
studies did not account for circadian rhythm, but found the viral load to be highest in saliva for the
first week after the onset of symptoms, suggesting that adequate salivary samples can be collected
at anytime. However, due to salivary enzymes, it is essential, especially if samples require
transportation, that whole saliva be chilled immediately after collection (e.g. shipped on ice packs)

or stored in a commercial stabilizer (e.g. RNAlater and VTM) and extracted as soon as possible
(12, 22).

Extraction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from saliva samples has been done with commercial spin
columns or automated on the NucliSENS® easyMAG®. Processing saliva can be laborious as
viscosity varies greatly and samples high in mucin can clog spin columns and automated
extractors. To overcome this problem, several studies mixed saliva in 2 mL VTM or PBS prior to
extraction. As saliva contains cell-free infectious virion, it may be possible to centrifuge the saliva
collected in sterile 50 mL conical tubes at 2,800 x g,10-minutes, 4oC, aspirate the supernatant, and
proceed with extraction (22). Small samples (1-2 mL) can be centrifuged at 13,000 x g, 4 minutes,
4oC in microcentrifuge tubes. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can then be performed with any
validated LDT or commercially available assay (5). Subsequent whole genome analysis on
positives using Oxford Nanopore MinION or by bait capture hybridization probes coupled with
Illumina sequencing for surveillance and outbreak analysis (14, 23).

The utility of saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 appears clinically useful, but controlled
diagnostic accuracy studies comparing saliva to matched NPS in positive and negative patients are
desperately needed. As outlined by the US FDA, the use of saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV2 requires a clinical study comparing whole saliva to NPS collected at the same time from a
minimum of 30 positive/30 negative pairs with discordant results resolved with further testing
(24). Similar validations could also be performed for other types oral fluids. Future studies could
also compare salivary and serum IgG as a screen for immunity (25). Nonetheless, properly

conducted comparative studies must be performed as soon as possible to help direct the clinical
laboratory in the fight against COVID-19.

Conclusion
In conclusion, saliva can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in both symptomatic patients and
asymptomatic carriers. Studies to date have shown that viral loads in saliva are comparable or
higher than in NPS after the onset of symptoms and remain detectable in saliva after respiratory
symptoms dissipate and NPS test negative. However, due to salivary enzymes, samples must be
handled correctly and processed in a timely manner. Well conducted diagnostic accuracy studies
are desperately needed to validate the use of saliva for the diagnosis of COVID-19.

Sample Collection
•
•
•
•

Saliva – 1-3 mL drooled unstimulated saliva in a sterile urine cup or 50mL conical tube
Oral swab placed in 1 mL VTM or PBS (children, elderly, hyposalivators)
Pipetted saliva from intubated patients
Note: Collect before or 30-60 minutes after eating, drinking, smoking or chewing gum.
Rinse mouth water before collection to void the mouth of debris and excess muscin.
If patient has difficulty producing saliva have them rub cheeks to induce salivation.

Transportation
•
•

Saliva - chill and transport as soon as possible on ice packs
Oral swabs can be transported at room temperature

Storage
•
•
•

Short-term storage at 2-4oC
Long-term storage at -80oC
Note: Salivary enzymes are still active at -80oC. Best to extract and then store.

Extraction
•
•
•
•
•
•

Extract as soon as possible.
Extraction can be done directly on non-viscous oral fluids
Samples can diluted 1:1 in VTM or PBS and then extracted
For 1-2 mL viscous samples centrifuge at 13,000 x g, 4 min, 4oC and extract the supernatant
Manually with spin column kits (e.g. QIAmp Viral RNA mini kit, Qiagen or High Pure Viral RNA
Kit, Roche )
Automated on the NucliSENS® easyMAG® (BioMerieux)

Detection
•

•

Any validated RT-rtPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2
Whole genome sequencing can also be performed on positives

98 asymptomatic healthcare
workers were enrolled
Zheng et al., 2020
(China)

If patients were intubated, an
endotracheal aspirate was
obtained.
NPS and saliva was
collected every 3 days.

RNA Target: S gene

• Viral loads 5X higher in saliva than in
NPS
• 21% saliva positives did not have a
matched NPS positive.
• 8% NPS positives did not have a
matched saliva positive.
• Saliva yielded greater overall
sensitivity.
• 2 asymptomatic HCW were saliva
positive NPS-negative.
• Infection was confirmed in all
patients by testing sputum and saliva
samples.
• Higher viral loads were found in
patients with severe disease compared
to those with mild disease.

• In the first study, after days of
medical treatments 53.3% were oral
swabs positive, 27% were anal swabs
positive, and 40% were serum
positive.
• In the second study, at day 0, 80% of
positives came from oral swabs, but
on day 5, 75% anal swabs and 50%
oral swabs were positive. Possible
shift in virus location as disease
progresses.
