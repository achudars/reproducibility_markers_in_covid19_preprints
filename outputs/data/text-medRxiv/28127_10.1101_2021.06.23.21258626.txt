Abstract
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected several million people since 2019. Despite various
vaccines of COVID-19 protect million people in many countries, the worldwide situations of more the
asymptomatic and mutated strain discovered are urging the more sensitive COVID-19 testing in this
turnaround time. Unfortunately, it is still nontrivial to develop a new fast COVID-19 screening method with
the easier access and lower cost, due to the technical and cost limitations of the current testing methods in the
medical resource-poor districts. On the other hand, there are more and more ocular manifestations that have
[1]
been reported in the COVID-19 patients as growing clinical evidence . This inspired this project. We have
conducted the joint clinical research since January 2021 at the ShiJiaZhuang City, Hebei province, China,
which approved by the ethics committee of The fifth hospital of ShiJiaZhuang of Hebei Medical University.
We undertake several blind tests of COVID-19 patients by Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong
University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. Meantime as an important part of the ongoing globally
COVID-19 eye test program by AIMOMICS since February 2020, we propose a new fast screening method of

analyzing the eye-region images, captured by common CCD and CMOS cameras. This could reliably make a
rapid risk screening of COVID-19 with the sustainable stable high performance in different countries and races.
For this clinical trial in ShiJiaZhuang, we compare and analyze 1194 eye-region images of 115 patients,
including 66 COVID-19 positive patients, 44 rehabilitation patients (nucleic acid changed from positive to
negative), 5 liver patients, as well as 117 healthy people. Remarkably, we consistently achieved very high
testing results (> 0.94) in terms of both sensitivity and specificity in our blind test of COVID-19 patients. This
confirms the viability of the COVID-19 fast screening by the eye-region manifestations. Particularly and
impressively, the results have the similar conclusion as the other clinical trials of the globally COVID-19 eye
[1]
test program . Hopefully, this series of ongoing globally COVID-19 eye test study, and potential rapid
solution of fully self-performed COVID risk screening method, can be inspiring and helpful to more
researchers in the world soon. Our model for COVID-19 rapid prescreening have the merits of the lower cost,
fully self-performed, non-invasive, importantly real-time, and thus enables the continuous health surveillance.
We further implement it as the open accessible APIs, and provide public service to the world. Our pilot
experiments show that our model is ready to be usable to all kinds of surveillance scenarios, such as infrared
temperature measurement device at airports and stations, or directly pushing to the target people groups
smartphones as a packaged application.

Introduction
In December 2019, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out globally. The pathogenic virus was
named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of June 2, 2021, there are about
170 million confirmed cases and 3.7 million deaths worldwide, and the World Health Organization (WHO)
[2, 3]
. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the
declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern
family of Coronaviridae, which is a large family of positive-stranded single-stranded ribonucleic acids with
envelopes. Previous studies confirmed that there are six coronaviruses can infect humans, including human
coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, Middle East respiratory
[4]
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV , SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus
[5]
family that can infect humans . When infected with SARS-CoV-2, the most common symptoms are fever,
dry cough, and fatigue, the less common symptoms are expectoration, diarrhea, headache, hemoptysis, chest
[6, 7]
pain, anorexia, myalgia, chills, nausea and vomiting, and so on
. In addition, in small cohort studies and
case reports dysosmia and taste disorders like anosmia, phantosmia, parosmia ageusia, dysgeusia also have
[8-10]
been reported
. But it is impossible to make an accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 according to the patient's
clinical symptoms. At present, imaging, nucleic acid, and serum antibody are the most common methods used
[11]
for diagnostic , but limited to laboratory or hospital environments, demanding expert-level operations. Thus,
patients must be tested in the hospital, and take some waiting time. All these points, greatly limit these stateof-the-art detection methods deployed at large-scale cities, and enabling real-time patient tracking. With the
further development of the research, many studies have reported that COVID-19 patients can be combined
with different ocular manifestations, such as hyperemia, increased secretion, epiphora, edema, follicular
[11-15]
conjunctivitis, scleritis, photophobia, foreign body sensation, itchiness, and so on
.

Recently, deep learning based classification networks have been widely used to support the disease diagnosis
and management[16, 17]. Inspired by these points, we propose a rapid COVID-19 risk screening and diagnosis
model with the deep learning method based on eye-region images, captured by normal CCD or CMOS camera
and cellphone. We propose the classification model with the corresponding eye images as the input to identify
the COVID-19 as a binary classification task. We trained the models by the data from ShiJianZhuang and
Shanghai. The performance was measured at the Area Under receiver-operating-characteristic Curve (AUC),
sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, and F1.
After more than three months of study and clinical trials, we found that the confirmed cases of COVID-19
present the consistent eye pathological symbols, including the asymptomatic. This study included 20 subjects
in the pre-test dataset (train and validation) and 212 subjects in the blind test dataset. The subject-level
performance of COVID-19 prescreening model in the combined study have achieved an AUC of 0.940(95%
CI, 0.888-0.992), 0.990 (95% CI, 0.972-1.000) and 0.975 (95% CI, 0.940-1.000) with respect to the first,
second and third blind tests.
As part of the ongoing globally COVID-19 eye test program by AIMOMICS since February 2020,
collaborated research worldwide and across racial boundaries has been set up, to call for a more massive
database and further refinement to improve the model performance. In the past and ongoing globally registered
clinical trials, we show that this model can successfully classify COVID-19 patients from healthy persons,
pulmonary patients except for COVID-19 (e.g., pulmonary fungal infection, bronchopneumonia, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer), liver patients, diabetes patients and ocular patients. The
experimental results reveal that patients with COVID-19 have different ocular features from others, which can
be used to differentiate them from the public.

The convenient method of eye-region image diagnosis can help the disease control researchers to fully
understand the prevalence and pathogenicity of the virus in different ages, time, region, climate, environment,
occupation, and population with basic diseases, and guide effective prevention and control measures against
COVID-19. Meantime, our model for COVID-19 rapid prescreening have the merits of the lower cost, fully
self-performed, non-invasive, real-time results, and thus enables the continuous surveillance. We further
implement it as the open accessible APIs, and provide public service to the world. Essentially, our model is
also open to other form of embedding for fast screening of COVID-19, such as all kind of infrared temperature
measurement device at airports and stations, or directly push to the target people groups‘ smartphones as a
packaged application. We believe a system implementing such an algorithm should assist the large-scale rapid
large-scale screening and real-time follow-up, that can be inspiring and helpful for encouraging more
researches on this topic.

In the study there are 2 groups: the COVID-19 group and the control group. The control group comprises of
three subgroups: RH (rehabilitation patients -nucleic acid changed from positive to negative), LV (liver
patients) and HL (health volunteers). The CV (COVID-19 patients) were confirmed by the RT-PCR detection
for viral nucleic acids. According to the eighth version guideline published by the National Health
Commission of China, asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 carriers refer to individuals with viral nucleic acid test
positive, and no clinical symptoms and no signs of pneumonia in chest imaging. The patients with RH
(rehabilitation patients -nucleic acid changed from positive to negative). The patients with LV (liver patients)
were diagnosed as hepatopathy. HL (the health volunteers) were collected from individuals who had taken
physical examination, no obviously abnormal results were demonstrated and no contact history with COVID19 patients. All the subjects were tested for the COVID-19, and no participants showed viral nucleic acids
positive during the following days, except for COVID-19 patients. No death events were observed in this study.
For each participant, 3-10 photographs of the eye-region were captured by using the common CCD and CMOS
cameras, assisted by doctors or healthcare workers. The same shooting plain mode and parameters were used,

and avoid shooting filters. The photos were captured in a good lighting condition, and not in dark or red
background. The image resolution is at least 1900x500 96dpi. The average time for taking a set of 5 eye photos
is around 1 minute. In the re-examination step, all the data that cannot reveal the details of the eyes are
discarded.
The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants
were provided with the written informed consent at the time of recruitment. And this study was approved by
the ethics committee of the fifth hospital of ShiJiaZhuang of Hebei Medical University (approval No.:
2021005), and was approved by ClinicalTrials.gov PRS (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04907981).

Methodology
First, we observed the pictures with an unaided eye, and found that among the 212 patients who were
included(20 patients with pre-test were not counted), there were 21 patients (9.9%) combined with ocular
manifestations. In the COVID-19 group, 17 patients (36.9%) showed ocular manifestations(Figure 1),
including conjunctival congestion(N=13), increased secretion(N=4), conjunctival hemorrhage(N=1), and
ptosis(N=1). While only 4 cases (9.1%) showed conjunctival congestion(N=4) and ptosis(N=2) in the
rehabilitation patients. At the same time, no ocular manifestation was observed in liver disease and healthy
control group.

Then, in order to evaluate the study, we develop a model from the previous work and the Hubei pre-test data,
using eye-region photos on the dataset. The blind test group includes COVID-19 positive patients, and control
group as rehabilitation patients (nucleic acid changed from positive to negative), liver patients, healthy people.
As shown in Figure 2, the experiment is divided into 3 blind tests. During the blind test on each group, the data
from the previous blind test is used as extra training data. As for the COVID-19 category, the average
sensitivity target is no less than 80%, which could demonstrate that the efficacy of our method to distinguish
COVID-19 patients.

In the first blind test, the pre-test data is combined to improve the model from previous-work. During
the second and third blind, the previous blind test data is used as extra data for training and validation.

The pipeline of our proposed method is illustrated in Figure 3, which is composed of two steps, the imageg
level classification, and the subject-level classification. The classification network is built by the deep learning
neuron networks to study the characteristics of the cropped eye regions in a latent space. Specifically, we
define the subject as a set of photos taken by the same people. The classification result of the same person in
might be different due to the noise in data and a proper vote strategy can enhance the robustness of the model.
The results of different images of the same subject are merged by a special vote strategy. Finally, the subjectlevel risk assessment of COVID-19 is generated.

To investigate the interpretability of the model, we conduct a visual analysis of the key areas of the model's
attention in the classification process. The key areas of the model's attention were converted into heat maps
based on gradients and activation maps by GradCAM.

Discussion
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The patients usually have fever, cough, fatigue,
ue,
shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste. Nowadays, some researchers also find that Olfactory and
nd
Gustatory Dysfunction is one of the common symptoms of the COVID-19. Meantime, more ocular
lar
manifestations have been reported in the COVID-19 patients as growing clinical evidence[18-20].

Accordingly, abnormally high body temperature has been the initial and most widely used screening method
od
for COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, the emergence and rising number of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients
nts
are posing a threat to body temperature-based screening methods. On one hand, despite the high sensitivity and
nd
good specificity of detecting the nucleic acid sequence of pathogens and amplify the signal by an amplification
on
reaction, the long process of RT-PCR may remarkably increase the risk of infection, less ideal for epidemic
ic
control. On the other hand, conventional CT tests can show that patients with COVID-19 can have the bilateral
ral
ground-glass appearance and pulmonary turbidity, analyzed by radiologists, or deep learning algorithms,
s,
however, for some patients, CT imaging results are not obvious or even negative. Particularly, there are many
ny
other bottlenecks and difficulties for the COVID-19 diagnosis globally, such as the restriction of pharyngeal
eal
swab sampling, the lack of RT-PCR kits, the difficulties in the transportation, the preservation of samples,
es,
political factors in some country, and so on. The deep learning based classification network can achieve
ve
impressive performance on the eye-region images. And the heatmaps generated by deep learning model have
ve
shown that the visual features of different diseases are mainly focused on the eye region, which indicates that
at
the model has learned the key area for disease diagnosis.

Various publications showed the ocular involvement with Coronavirus family

. In our study, the Ocular

symptoms of COVID-19 patients accounted for about 36%, the main manifestation is conjunctivitis, which
was consistent with the results of previous studies

[15, 24]

. SARS-CoV-2 infects the body through the binding of

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor[25, 26], it is widely expressed in a variety of cells, primarily
in the lungs, kidneys, heart, gastrointestinal tract, and liver[27]. Recently, it has also been reported that ACE2
expressed in conjunctiva[28]. Its expression in conjunctiva may also be related to the occurrence of COVID-19
conjunctivitis.It is worth noting that some of the recovered patients still have ocular manifestations, and there
are also some patients are positive in the model test. Studies have shown that the ocular performance of
rehabilitated patients is accompanied by a significant increase in the level of inflammatory factors[29,

30]

,

which indicate the eye performance is not caused by the direct invasion and destruction of SARS-CoV-2, but
the virus causes a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine responses in conjunctival and
limbal epithelial cells[31], resulting in a proliferation of cytokines, resulting in apoptosis of peripheral corneal
epithelial cells and reactive inflammatory injury. Therefore, we believe that longer and more frequent followup is necessary for the recovered patients.

Meanwhile, there are some limits to this study. First, the study sample size is small and most COVID-19
patients were collected from East Asia (China). A larger multicenter study covering more patients of diverse
race would be necessary to test the performance of the ocular surface feature-based deep learning system. At
last, the pathological significance of extracted features from COVID-19 patients should be carefully
interpreted and re-verified by ophthalmologists.

CONCLUSION
Our deep learning method in this clinical trial study, which discriminates over 85% COVID-19 positive
patients from the test group, including asymptomatics. Consider that eye exam technology has been used to
screen a variety of diseases, such as diabetes and kidney disease. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning
model for rapidly risk screening COVID-19 with eye-region images. Different from previous studies, which
utilize RT-PCR or CT imaging, the input of our system is the face image or binocular image captured by
common CCD and CMOS cameras. Combining with the development of deep learning, it enables the real-time
COVID-19 screening from two aspects, sample acquisition, and testing.

We are conducting the large-scale experiments to further validate the effectiveness and efficacy of our
algorithm as the tool of the new screening method. On the other hand, due to the privacy policy and the
difficulty of data collection in different countries by racial diversity, we have furthered investigate and
extended the capability of our algorithm in few-shot learning settings. We have achieved sustainable stable
high performance in a series of registered clinical trials at different counties, thanks to our previous works[32,
33]

from the computer vision and machine learning communities.

We believe that this study can be inspiring and helpful for encouraging more researches in this direction, and
provide effective and rapid assist for clinical risk screening, especially during outbreaks. To conduct further
research, we are building a globally COVID-19 eye test free API and Demo links platform which implements
our algorithms and helps fast screening COVID-19. Furthermore, this platform could gradually open more than
300 diseases eye tests and joint study programs’ invitation, such as virus influenza, diabetes, hepatopathy, etc.
through the open accessible APIs or Demo links, the test algorithm could be easily deployed or embedded in
the HD camera and any detect accessories, combined into a multi-modal approach including vision and other
sensors, continually monitoring the particular diseases control districts were around the public access,
transportation hub, population centre, quarantine house, making everyone health care more accessible with
lower cost.
So we are looking forward to more scientists, engineers and application developers join us to explore the eye
testing and collaborative work together on the critical challenges, ensuring “equality、altruism and ethics
“ are the highest principle.For more study information and the access license for joining our the globally
COVID-19 eye test program,

For scientific research, we need some eye region data. We promise that the data will not be used for
commercial, only for scientific research. The specific requirements are as follows:

1. The eyes in the image need to be clear, a total of five required angles are shown on the left.
2. When taking photos, please do not wear cosmetic products such as contact lenses.
3. When taking photos, please do not use beauty camera mode, or post-production beauty filters, we need the
original images.

1. Sampling equipment and environmental requirements
1) For the above sampling, the same model of mobile phone or shooting equipment must be used to prevent the
he
sampling data domain from being interfered with by the equipment.
2) If the conditions are not available, it is necessary to use the same model of mobile phone to collect all the
sampling images at the same time, to maximize the elimination of device data domain interference.
3) The same shooting parameters must be used when shooting, and the beauty, soft light, and other shooting
filters must not be used.
4) The image resolution of the eyes is at least: 1900x500 96dpi
