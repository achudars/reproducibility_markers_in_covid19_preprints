Abstract

20

Background: The 2030 goal for schistosomiasis is elimination as a public health

21

problem (EPHP), with mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel to school-aged

22

children (SAC) a central pillar of the strategy. However, due to COVID-19, many mass

23

treatment campaigns for schistosomiasis have been halted with uncertain implications

24

for the programmes.

25

Method: We use mathematical modelling to explore how postponement of MDA and

26

various mitigation strategies affect achievement of the EPHP goal for Schistosoma

27

mansoni and S. haematobium.

Results: In moderate and some high prevalence settings, the disruption may delay

29

the goal by up to two years. In some high prevalence settings EPHP is not achievable

30

with current strategies, and so the disruption will not impact this. Here, increasing SAC

31

coverage and treating adults can achieve the goal.

32

The impact of MDA disruption and the appropriate mitigation strategy varies according

33

to the baseline prevalence prior to treatment, the burden of infection in adults and

34

stage of the programme.

35

Conclusions: Schistosomiasis MDA programmes in medium and high prevalence

36

areas should restart as soon as is feasible, and mitigation strategies may be required

37

in some settings.

Introduction

44

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease affecting millions of people in several endemic

45

regions. 1 Intestinal (caused by Schistosoma mansoni or S. japonicum) and urogenital

46

(caused by S. haematobium) are the two most prevalent forms of human

47

schistosomiasis.

48

school-aged children (SAC; 5-14 years old) is the main method of reducing the burden

49

of morbidity associated with this infection. 3,4 Control programmes additionally include

50

recommending behaviour modification and improvements in sanitation to lower the

51

intensity of transmission. 5,6

52

MDA is mostly targeted at school-aged children since age-intensity profiles are convex

53

in shape with a peak in infection levels typically seen amongst SAC and teenagers. 7,8

54

Additionally, this age category can be reached through school-based treatment

55

programmes which have been shown to be cost-effective in reaching these

56

populations.

The 2030 World Health Organization (WHO) target for schistosomiasis is elimination

59

as a public health problem (EPHP), achieved when the heavy-intensity prevalence in

60

SAC reduces to less than 1%. 11,12 For S. mansoni, heavy-intensity infection is defined

61

as having over 400 eggs per gram of feces and for S. haematobium is defined as

62

having over 50 eggs per 10mL of urine. 13 Heavy-intensity infections can be diagnosed

63

by using the Kato-Katz technique and urine filtration respectively.

64

thought to be associated most strongly with these heavy burdens, hence the target to

65

reduce the number of these infections.

66

Previous mathematical modelling for schistosomiasis has shown that EPHP can be

67

achieved in low (< 10% baseline prevalence among SAC) to moderate (10 − 50%

68

baseline prevalence among SAC)

69

transmission settings ( ≥ 50% baseline prevalence among SAC) inclusion of adults in

70

MDA programmes would be needed to achieve the EPHP goal. 2,11,17–19

71

Due to the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the WHO has advised

72

governments to postpone MDA for schistosomiasis (and other neglected tropical

73

diseases).

74

different transmission settings as the level of resurgence or bounce back varies across

75

settings since it depends on the magnitude of the basic reproductive number, R0.

76

Particularly, we expect the postponement to have a greater impact in high

77

transmission settings, as they face the greatest risk since resurgence will be high in

78

these areas. Although missed MDAs will certainly lead to resurgence in infection

79

levels, the epidemiological impact of such postponement is not known.

80

The stage (how many rounds of MDA prior to the delay) and effectiveness of the

81

programme (coverage and compliance) will clearly play a role in the resurgence or

82

bounce back rate. Programmes in their early stages may return to pre-treatment

83

endemicity levels faster, whereas, programmes further in which have managed to

84

significantly reduce the intensity of transmission, will observe lower levels of

85

resurgence, provided the transmission rate is not too high. However, in high

86

transmission settings, programmes further in will have a risk of losing much of the

87

long-term benefit of multiple rounds of MDA.

88

In this paper, we use mathematical models of parasite transmission and control by

89

MDA to estimate the impact of temporarily delaying MDA on achieving the EPHP goal.

Once MDA programmes resume, it will be of great importance for health workers and

91

programme managers to have guidelines on mitigation strategies, in order to get back

92

on track for achieving EPHP. We consider various stages of the programme at which

93

the disruption occurs (early or late into the programme) and investigate the impact of

94

mitigation strategies for S. mansoni and S. haematobium. For S. mansoni we also use

95

two different age-intensity profiles, corresponding to low and high adult burdens of

96

infection to determine if this would have an impact on missing MDA (Figure 1).

model incorporates treatment by MDA and is parameterised for S. mansoni and S.

108

haematobium with previously published data and estimated parameter values derived

109

from past epidemiological studies (supplementary Table S1).

110

describes the dynamics of the adult worms in the human host population and a single

111

reservoir of infectious material (infected snails-are short lived). 22 This model assumes

112

a negative binomial distribution of parasites per host with a fixed aggregation

113

parameter, k, density-dependent fecundity, and assumes monogamous sexual

114

reproduction among worms. The egg contribution to the reservoir depends on the age-

115

specific contact rate for each individual in the population.

116

The numerical simulations were run for a single community with a population size set

117

at 1000, assuming no migration. In our simulations, treatment is delivered at random

118

at each round i.e. no systematic non-adherers and no non-access to treatment

119

individuals. Acquired immunity is not taken into consideration. 24 To simulate moderate

120

and high baseline prevalence settings (for low and high adult burden of infection), the

121

intrinsic intensity of transmission, i.e. basic reproductive number (R0), is varied (higher

122

prevalence settings corresponding to higher R0 values).

123

Scenarios and mitigation strategies

124

In our investigation, we consider moderate ( 10 − 50% baseline prevalence among

125

SAC) and high ( ≥ 50% baseline prevalence among SAC) prevalence settings prior to

126

MDA. 2,11 In addition to this, for S. mansoni we use two different age intensity profiles

127

(low and high adult burden of infection) to determine whether this would differentially

128

influence the impact of missing MDA. In the model, we implement MDA annually at a

129

75% coverage level of SAC only. 11 We simulate one MDA round being missed either

130

early or late (second or sixth round of MDA, respectively) into the programme. For all

131

of our scenarios, we determine the time taken to achieve EPHP. After a missed round

132

of MDA, we consider three mitigation strategies (Figure 2): (i) return with annual 75%

133

coverage level of SAC-only, (ii) return with annual 85% coverage level of SAC only

134

and (iii) return with one-year community-wide coverage (85% SAC +40% adults)

135

followed by 75% coverage of SAC-only in the years following this.

For each transmission setting and age profile (Figure 1), we simulate the impact of

determine the prevalence of heavy-intensity infections (eggs per gram, epg ≥ 400 for

141

S. mansoni and over 50 eggs per 10mL of urine for S. haematobium) in SAC to

investigate whether the EPHP goal has been achieved.

We present results for the effect of MDA postponement due to COVID-19 and the

impact of mitigation strategies in going back on track to achieving EPHP by 2030. The

results are presented for Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium by considering

the scenarios and mitigation strategies described in Figure 2.

155

Missing the sixth round of MDA does not have any impact on the time required to

For high transmission settings with a low adult burden of infection, if the programme

169

is reintroduced at the previous 75% SAC-only coverage, then it is predicted that up to

170

two years of delay will result in reaching EPHP (Tables 1, 2 and Figure 3), regardless

171

of the time MDA is missed. Increasing coverage level to 85% of SAC (or having one

172

round of community-wide MDA), requires up to one additional year if the second round

173

of MDA is missed. From Figure 3, during the postponement of MDA there is an

174

increase in the heavy – intensity infection (illustrated by the black, red, and yellow

175

lines). As a result of this there is an increase in prevalence of heavy intensity (related

176

to increased morbidity), illustrated by the green area. Hence, this is an additional

177

burden of infection which would not have happened if the treatment programme had

178

gone as planned.

189

For high transmission settings with a high adult burden, the outcome depends on the

190

baseline SAC prevalence. For baseline SAC prevalence below 59%, missing the

191

second round of MDA, a one-year delay in achieving EPHP is predicted. This holds

192

for any mitigation strategy considered. However, for baseline SAC prevalence above

193

59%, EPHP is not achieved by 2030 regardless of the mitigation strategy described in

194

Figure 2 (refer to Table 1, Table 2 and Figure 4A, Figure 4B, Figure 4C). This is

195

because MDA of SAC only is having a small impact on reducing transmission. To

achieve EPHP within a shorter time frame, higher coverage of SAC and treating adults

would be needed for this setting. These coverage levels can be determined by

collecting SAC and adult data once programmes resume.

that once the MDA programme resumes, increasing the SAC coverage to 85% and

including 40% of adults for every MDA round, can achieve the goal by 2030.

212

If the sixth round of MDA is missed and the baseline SAC prevalence is below 59%,

213

no additional year of intervention is required, regardless of the mitigation strategy.

214

However, for baseline SAC prevalence above this threshold, EPHP is not achieved by

215

2030 with any of the mitigation strategies considered in Figure 2. Similarly, as when

216

the second round of MDA is postponed, increasing the SAC coverage to 85% and

217

treating 40% of adults in every round after the programme resumes, can achieve the

218

EPHP goal by 2030.

219

Our simulations show that missing the second round of MDA for baseline SAC

220

prevalence of 30% (moderate transmission setting), may take from four to ten years

221

for SAC prevalence to catch up to the state where no MDA rounds are missed

222

(depending on the scenario and adult burden of infection, refer to supplementary

223

Table S2 and Table S3). Missing the sixth round of MDA does not have any impact

224

on the time required to achieve the EPHP goal but it might take up to five years for the

225

SAC prevalence to catch up to what would have been achieved without missing MDA

226

rounds.

227

For a baseline SAC prevalence of 70% (high transmission setting) with a low adult

228

burden, it may take from five to 12 years for the SAC prevalence to catch up

229

(supplementary Table S2). For the high transmission setting with a high adult burden,

230

it is predicted that it may take more than three years for the SAC prevalence to get

231

back to the level under no missed rounds (depending on the scenario, refer to

232

supplementary Table S3).

Here, results of the impact of COVID -19 on S. haematobium, and the effect of

237

For moderate transmission settings with no postponement of MDA, it takes up to two

238

years for the elimination as a public health problem to be achieved (Table 3 and Table

239

4). For lower moderate prevalence settings (i.e. just above 10% SAC prevalence), the

240

heavy-intensity prevalence in SAC may be less than 1% before the start of the

241

treatment. Therefore, EPHP goal is met without any MDA intervention. Missing the

242

second round of MDA (Table 3), will require up to one additional year to achieve the

For high transmission settings, depending on the baseline SAC prevalence, it takes

two to nine years to achieve EPHP (no delay to MDA treatment). For scenarios where

it takes two years to EPHP, missing the second round of MDA will require one

additional year of intervention, regardless of the mitigation strategies. For scenarios

where it takes longer than two years to achieve EPHP, a one year delay is also

259

the coverage level to 85% SAC (or having one round of community-wide treatment),

260

does not require the additional year of MDA. Missing the sixth round of MDA has a

261

smaller effect on the time to achieve the goal. Increasing the coverage level to 85%

SAC only, does not require any additional years of treatment (Table 4).

273

We have presented analyses of the impact of delaying MDA due to COVID-19 spread

274

and considered various mitigation strategies to get the programme back on track for

275

achieving EPHP by 2030 for both S. mansoni and S. haematobium. We assumed that

276

MDA will be delayed for one year, either early or late into the programme (second or

277

sixth round of treatment). Once the programme resumes, the delay in achieving EPHP

278

is calculated for various mitigation strategies.

279

For S. mansoni, our analyses suggest that in moderate transmission settings treating

280

75% of SAC annually can achieve EPHP within three years. This holds for low and

281

high adult burden of infection. Missing the second round of MDA can delay EPHP by

282

up to one year, whereas missing the sixth round of MDA does not have any effect on

283

EPHP. This is because the goal is achieved before the delay occurs and hence it takes

284

longer to resurge back to pre-MDA levels. In high transmission settings, the results

285

depend on the baseline prevalence and the burden of infection in adults. For low adult

286

burden of infection, treating 75% of SAC annually can achieve EPHP within eight years

287

of MDA treatment. Missing one round of MDA, delays the goal by up to two years. For

288

high adult burden of infection, we might not achieve the EPHP goal, regardless of the

289

postponement. If the baseline SAC prevalence rises above 59%, and the second or

290

the sixth round of MDA is missed, an increase in SAC coverage and inclusion of adults

291

is necessary to achieve EPHP by 2030.

292

We acknowledge that due to limited praziquantel supplies (donations),

293

adults in treatment may not be feasible in all areas. Hence, it is important that surveys

294

are conducted to collect SAC and adult data to determine the optimal coverage levels

295

and whether adult treatment is required.

296

treatment to be prioritised as necessary in high transmission settings where there is a

297

high adult burden of infection.

298

For S. haematobium, it is predicted that in moderate transmission settings, missing

299

the second round of MDA delays EPHP by up to one year. However, missing the sixth

300

round of MDA does not affect the goal. In high transmission settings, EPHP can be

301

delayed by up to one year, regardless of the time of the delay. Annual 75% SAC only

302

treatment is sufficient for achieving EPHP by 2030, even when MDA is postponed for

303

one year.

304

Overall, postponing MDA for one-year results in a delay of up to two years for

305

achieving EPHP. The impact of missing MDA depends on the baseline prevalence

306

prior to treatment, the burden of infection in adults and the time at which we miss MDA

307

(early or late into the programme).

308

However, care should be taken when deciding to stop MDA after EPHP has been

309

achieved as there will be a risk of resurgence/bounce back. This is because the overall

310

prevalence might still be high, so that infection persists, despite the heavy-intensity

311

prevalence in SAC being reduced to less than 1%. 26 Additionally, it is predicted that it

312

takes longer for the SAC prevalence to catch-up to what would have been achieved

313

by full MDA rounds, than it takes for the heavy-intensity prevalence.

314

In this study, we assume that control programmes will return to their pre-COVID-19

315

effectiveness within one year, but this might not be feasible for various reasons.

316

Training programmes may have been disrupted by the COVID-19 and health workers

317

might have been re-deployed to other tasks. Another important factor is that schools

318

may not open when the programme restarts or parents may decide not to send their

319

children back to school. As the MDA programme is mainly focused in SAC, this will

320

have a major impact on the mitigation strategies. We also need to take into

321

consideration that stocks of praziquantel in government warehouses may have past

322

their expiry dates, or that praziquantel production and supply chains of MDA treatment

323

may be disrupted due to travel restrictions. Thus, it might take some time to achieve

324

the desired coverage once the programme restarts. As a result, postponing

325

programmes for longer or returning with reduced effectiveness will mean that we might

326

ultimately be facing longer delays in achieving the EPHP goal.

327

When considering a longer postponement of MDA, of 18 months, analyses suggest

328

that the EPHP goal could be delayed by an extra six months, depending on the

329

transmission setting and adult burden of infection. Hence, the longer the delay, the

330

longer it will take programmes to achieve EPHP. Mitigation strategies upon resumption

331

will be increasingly important in areas where programmes are delayed for longer.

332

It is important to note one important caveat on the predictions made in this study. It

333

has been assumed that for a fixed MDA coverage level, treatment is at random in the

334

population. This may not be the case, as persistent non-adherers to treatment (due to

335

many different factors) are an important feature of most MDA based control

336

programmes. If this is the case for treating schistosome infections, our predictions may

337

err on the side of being too optimistic.

338

The model-based predictions can be tested once the MDA programme is resumed as

339

we expect to see a large increase in prevalence of infection after a long period of no

340

intervention, particularly in high transmission settings. Data collection on SAC and

341

adults needs to be done at the start of the resumed intervention. The ongoing

342

Geshiyaro project can address this. 27

343

Conclusions

344

In this study we show that postponement of rounds of MDA due to the COVID-19

345

pandemic will lead to an increase in S. mansoni and S. haematobium infection. As a

346

result, more resources will be needed to reach the 2030 goal of EPHP once the full

347

MDA programmes restart. The transmission setting, duration of the delay in delivering

348

MDA, stage of programme, age-intensity profile will all have an impact on achieving

349

WHO goals for control of both morbidity and transmission. Mitigation strategies can

350

help in accelerating progress towards EPHP by 2030. In some high transmission

351

settings, EPHP may not be reached regardless of the length of the delay and hence,

352

upon resumption it is important that surveys are done to collect SAC and adult infection

353

data in order to determine the desired coverage levels for MDA to reach the defined

354

control objectives. We hope this study will provide health workers with important

355

quantitative tools to assess what mitigation strategies are best applied in given

356

epidemiological settings.
