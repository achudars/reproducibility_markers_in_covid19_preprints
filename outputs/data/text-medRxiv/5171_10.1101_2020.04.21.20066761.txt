Running head: Drug-induced LQTS and repurposed COVID-19 drugs

ABSTRACT
The risk-benefit ratio associated with the use of repurposed drugs to treat 2019 SARS-CoV-2 related
infectious disease (COVID-19) is complicated since benefits are awaited, not proven. A thorough
literature search was conducted to source information on the pharmacological properties of 5 drugs and 1
combination

(azithromycin,

chloroquine,

favipiravir,

hydroxychloroquine,

remdesivir,

and

lopinavir/ritonavir) repurposed to treat COVID-19. A risk assessment of drug-induced Long QT Syndrome
(LQTS) associated with COVID-19 repurposed drugs was performed and compared to 23 well-known
torsadogenic and 10 low torsadogenic risk compounds. Computer calculations were performed using
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, including affinity to block the rapid component of the
delayed rectifier cardiac potassium current (IKr) encoded by the human ether-a-go-go gene (hERG),
propensity to prolong cardiac repolarization (QT interval) and cause torsade de pointes (TdP). Seven
different LQTS indices were calculated and compared. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database was queried with specific key words relating to
arrhythmogenic events. Estimators of LQTS risk levels indicated a very high or moderate risk for all
COVID-19 repurposed drugs with the exception for azithromycin, although cases of TdP have been
reported with this drug. There was excellent agreement among the various indices used to assess risk of
drug-induced LQTS for the 6 repurposed medications and 23 torsadogenic compounds. Based on our
results, monitoring of the QT interval shall be performed when some COVID-19 repurposed drugs are
used, as such monitoring is possible for hospitalized patients or with the use of biodevices for outpatients.

Running head: Drug-induced LQTS and repurposed COVID-19 drugs

INTRODUCTION
As of August 13, 2020, there are 2,995 clinical trials registered for COVID-19, many assessing drugs
to be repurposed for use against COVID-19; among those, hydroxychloroquine (N=216), azithromycin
(N=94), lopinavir/ritonavir combination (N=67), chloroquine (N=74), dexamethasone (N=19), colchicine
(N=18) and remdesivir (N=13).1 There have been a few promising preliminary results using some
repurposed drugs in the therapeutic management of COVID-19, selected based upon their mechanism of
action.2 Yet, the risk of doing so in COVID-19 patients has not been quantified, as a systematic approach
should be used to assess risk benefit boundaries of these drugs. Furthermore, new safety profiles of
repurposed drugs need to be established as they may have never been used or tested in such different
patient populations. This is especially true for patients with complex drug regimen, polypharmacy, or
treated with narrow therapeutic index drugs.
The American College of Cardiology (ACC) has issued a warning regarding the use of some of these
3
drugs without evidence of whether their benefits outweigh their risks. Drugs like hydroxychloroquine and

chloroquine prolong the QT interval, and may cause ventricular arrythmias and sudden cardiac arrest.4-7
We have recently conducted two risk assessment studies using simulations in specific populations of
patients in whom these repurposed drugs could most likely be associated with unbalanced risk of cardiac
toxicity (NCT04339634 and NCT04378881).

8, 9

This study looks at drugs proposed as potential COVID-19 therapies, assessing their risk of causing
QT prolongation and their proarrhythmic properties that lead to a characteristic polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia, described as torsade de pointes (TdP). As this study is based on literature review and
computation from database information, patients’ specific characteristics, which are also important, could
not be considered. Various risk assessments for drug-induced Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) will be
presented and compared as predictive estimators for unbalanced risk benefit associated with repurposed
drugs for COVID-19.

METHODS
STEP 1: A literature search was conducted using the National Library of Medicine website
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). A primary search used the key words “drug-induced QT prolongation
index”. From this search, 38 publications were retrieved and considered for analysis. Six different indices
were repeatedly referenced, including methodology and data on large numbers of drugs or elements to
consider while evaluating the risk of drug-induced LQTS. The retained indices calculated and compared
for drugs under study were based on reports from Redfern et al., 2003, Kramer et al., 2013, the
Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA), the CredibleMeds® website, Romero et al., 2018,
and relative odds ratio calculated from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS) database.

10-15

We also included for comparison our developed and validated Long QT-

JT index (information about calculation of this index and validation are described in details in Patent WO
2017/213825, United States of America, 2017).

16

STEP 2: A second search was performed using the National Library of Medicine website
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with the following keywords (number of publications retrieved and
analyzed are included in parentheses): “azithromycin and QT” (80), “azithromycin and torsade” (35),
“azithromycin and arrhythmia” (97), “chloroquine and QT” (50), “chloroquine and torsade” (17),
“chloroquine and arrhythmia” (178), “favipiravir and QT” (2), “favipiravir and torsade” (0), “favipiravir and
arrhythmia”

(1),

“hydroxychloroquine

and

QT”

(16),

“hydroxychloroquine

and

torsade”

(3),

“hydroxychloroquine and arrhythmia” (58), “lopinavir/ritonavir and QT” (8), “lopinavir/ritonavir and torsade”
(7), “lopinavir/ritonavir and arrhythmia” (19), “remdesivir and QT” (0), “remdesivir and torsade” (0), and
“remdesivir and arrhythmia” (0).
STEP 3: A similar search was conducted by combining the key words “QT”, “torsade”, and “arrhythmia”
with 19 “Known Risk”, 3 “Possible Risk” and 1 “Conditional Risk” torsadogenic drugs as reported by
CredibleMeds® (https://www.crediblemeds.org/). These drugs were: “astemizole, chlorpromazine,
cilostazol,

cisapride,

clarithromycin,

clozapine,

dasatinib,

domperidone,

donepezil,

droperidol,

escitalopram, halofantrine, haloperidol, lapatinib, methadone, ondansetron, pentamidine, pimozide,
propofol, risperidone, terfenadine, thioridazine, and vandetanib”. The drugs were selected as relevant
information was obtained for most indices under study. We also considered in our analysis 10 drugs with

Lamivudine, Loratadine, Mitoxantrone, Nifedipine, Raltegravir, Ribavirin, Sildenafil and Sitagliptin.
STEP 4: Pharmacological information [IC50 for hERG (KCNQ1; IKr) block, IC50 for Nav1.5 (INa) block, IC50

daily dose, plasma protein binding (%), inhibition of hERG trafficking, cardiac action potential duration (at
90% repolarization; APD90)] and clinical information (QT prolongation, torsade de pointe), retrieved from
m
STEPs 2 and 3 were used to compute relevant QT indices retained from our analysis in STEP 1 for 6
COVID-19 repurposed medications, 23 known torsadogenic drugs and 10 low torsadogenic risk drugs..
Data were either directly extracted or calculated using the reported equations from references identified in
STEP 1. The calculated mean value was used as a parameter when more than one value has been
en
reported in the literature. In the case of Cmax, the dose corrected value (or its mean) was extrapolated for
the reported maximum daily dose. In the case of the Long QT-JT index, the following equations were
re
used:

where K1 =

and DDIC is a drug-drug interaction coefficient calculated while considering the metabolic pathways off a
drug being potentially inhibited by co-administered drugs. For drugs associated with block of IKr and IKs,
the lowest IC50 value was retained. As it pertains to DDIC, the partial metabolic clearance pathways have
ve
been characterized and estimated for each drug in the analysis. K1 is calculated under conditions of
inhibition of the highest partial metabolic clearance. For example, if a drug has a CLCYP2D6 = 50%,
%,
CLCYP2C19 = 25%, CLUGT1A9 = 15% and a CLrenal = 10%, DDIC will consider a 50% possible decrease

where K3 =

where K4 is given a value of -5 or 0 if the drug inhibits or does not inhibit hERG trafficking. K1, K2, K3
and/or K4 were set to 0 if no value is available for either IC50 for block of IKr or IKs, IC50 for block of
CaV1.2, IC50 for block of NaV1.5 or for hERG trafficking properties, respectively. STEP 5: SQL codes to
perform queries on cleaned reports submitted to the FAERS database between 2004 and 2019Q2 were
written for each of the 6 COVID-19 repurposed medications, 23 known torsadogenic drugs and 10 low
torsadogenic drugs searching for adverse events reported for these drugs and a combination of specific
search terms (see Table 3). An event was included in the final counts if the case report’s active
ingredient, cleaned for text standardization and filtered by relevant route of administration for systemic
exposure, and the reported preferred term were exact matches with the drug of interest and reference
terms.

Patient and Public Involvement
No patient involvement was included in this study. This study contains no observed drug-induced
adverse effects in COVID-19 patients. Recommendations are based exclusively on searches of literature
and databases.

RESULTS
Results obtained for 7 indices of drug-induced LQTS, as well as the IC50 value for block of IKr (or IKs),
through the extraction of data from the literature or from computation using provided information for 6
COVID-19 medications are presented in Table 1. Using the same indices, the risk of these medications to
induce LQTS can be compared to the risk measured for 23 well-established, torsadogenic drugs and 10
low torsadogenic drugs (Table 2). A color coded strategy is used to illustrate the correspondence
between these various indices for well-know torsadogenic drugs, for drugs with low torsadogenic risk and
for COVID-19 repurposed drugs. We also present the number of arrhythmogenic adverse drug events
reported by the FAERS database for all drugs listed in Table 1 and 2 (Table 3). It is recognized that some
bias certainly exists in the number of events reported by FAERS, as these events are not normalized for
number of observed reports or prescriptions. However, FAERS data offer an appreciation of risk for druginduced arrhythmogenic events in a “real-world” situation. In the following section, drug specific
information will be provided to help appreciate and compare the risk of drug-induced LQTS for each of the
6 COVID-19 medications under consideration.

plasma concentrations in the range of 400 ng/mL (550 nM) are observed following a single 500 mg oral
dose.

QT prolongation and TdP. Prolongation of cardiac repolarization and QT interval, imparting a risk of
developing cardiac arrhythmia and TdP, has been reported in patients treated with macrolides.20 All
estimators of azithromycin-related risk of drug-induced TdP (Table 1) suggest a weak proarrhythmic effect
of the drug (IC50 for block of hERG between 0.856 mM and 1.091 mM), although cases of TdP have been
described.21 Furthermore, cases of TdP have been spontaneously reported during post-marketing
surveillance (FAERS) in patients receiving azithromycin (Table 3). This explains why CredibleMeds® lists
azithromycin as a “Known Risk” drug.
Chloroquine. Chloroquine is metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 through dealkylation to
monedethylchloroquine and bisdesethylchloroquine.

range of 1.0-3.0 µM have been measured following the oral administration of a 600 mg oral dose to
healthy subjects or patients.23, 24
QT prolongation and TdP. Chloroquine has been shown to block hERG channels with an IC50 of 2.5 µM.4
Redfern et al. described chloroquine as a Category 4 drug, i.e., drugs for which there have been isolated
reports of TdP in humans.

10

Indeed, case reports of chloroquine-induced QT prolongation, cardiac

electrophysiology disturbance and TdP have been reported. Based on CredibleMeds® classification,
chloroquine is a drug of “Known Risk” for TdP.

25

The Long QT-JT index calculated for chloroquine under

conditions of CYP2C8 inhibition is Very High (Table 1), a risk-estimate value similar to that calculated for
drugs such as astemizole, haloperidol, pimozide, and terfenadine (Table 2).

16

Favipiravir. Favipiravir is a new antiviral drug with a broad activity toward RNA viruses, such as the
influenza virus, including the avian influenza (H5N1), rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus.26, 27 The
usual adult dosage is 1,600 mg of favipiravir administered orally twice daily on day one, followed by 600
mg orally twice daily from day two through day five. Favipiravir Cmax in plasma is about 500 µM (78.9
µg/mL; 1,600 mg dose). It could also inhibit CYP2C8 with an IC50 of 477 µM (74.9 µg/ml).

28

QT prolongation and TdP. Studies looking at the effects of favipiravir on hERG block have shown that a
mild suppression of the hERG current was observed at the concentration of 1 mM (157 µg/mL, 2.0 times
the observed human Cmax at a dose of 1,600 mg). In a telemetry study conducted in dogs, no effects on
blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, mean), heart rate, or ECG parameters (PR interval, QRS, QT and QTc)
were observed even at the oral dose of 150 mg/kg [Cmax (mean), 268 µg/mL; 3.4 times the human Cmax)]
until 20 hours have passed after the treatment.28 Calculation of K/Cmax, K/Cmax free and Long QT-JT Index
using an estimated IC50 of 5 mM (5-times the concentration associated with 8.1% block of IKr) yielded
parameters in the high- to very high-risk categories for drug-induced LQTS. As no reports of LQTS have
been published yet, close monitoring of QTc remains advisable.
Hydroxychloroquine. Major metabolic pathway is through N-dealkylation leading to the formation of
desethylhydroxychloroquine; desethylchloroquine and bisdesethylchloroquine are minor metabolites. The
N-desalkylation pathway seems to be mediated by CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6 (high affinity, but low
capacity). Following a single 200 mg oral dose to healthy males, the plasma Cmax was 50.3 ng/mL (150

nM), reached in 3.74 hours with an elimination half-life of 123.5 days. Administration of
hydroxychloroquine 200 mg three times a day led to mean serum Cmax of 460 ng/mL (1,3 µM).17
QT prolongation and TdP. Use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of lupus erythematosus has been
7

associated with occasional reports of QT interval prolongation and TdP. In their recent study using
hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin, Chorin et al., observed QTc increases of 40 msec
or more in 30% of their patients; in 11% of their 84 patients, QTc increased to more than 500msec.6
CredibleMeds® has classified hydroxychloroquine as a “Known Risk” drug for TdP. K/Cmax, K/Cmax free
and Long QT-JT index also identify hydroxychloroquine as a high-risk drug for drug-induced LQTS.
Lopinavir/ritonavir. When administered alone, lopinavir is a low affinity CYP3A4 substrate with a low
oral bioavailability. As a high affinity substrate of CYP3A4, ritonavir is co-administered to inhibit the first
pass metabolism of lopinavir and increases its plasma concentrations by about 10-fold. Under such
conditions, lopinavir reaches about 10 µg/ml (15.9 µM) after an 800 mg dose. For its part, ritonavir has a
bioavailability of 85%, and Cmax of about 11 µg/mL (15.5 µM) are observed after administration of a 600
mg oral dose.

29

Importantly, because of strong CYP3A4 inhibition, major drug-drug interactions are

observed with other CYP3A4 substrates.30-32
QT prolongation and TdP. Lopinavir and ritonavir are associated with significant blockade of the hERG
(IKr) channel33 (Table 1) and cases of TdP have been registered in the FAERS database (Table 3). The
monograph of the product also states that cases of QT interval prolongation and TdP have been reported,
although causality of lopinavir/ritonavir combination could not be established. CredibleMeds® lists the
drug under the category “Possible Risk”, while other indices list this combination under High Risk (Table
1).
Remdesivir. Remdesivir is an investigational antiviral drug. Originally tested in Ebola patients, it is not
currently FDA-approved to treat or prevent any diseases, including COVID-19.34, 35 However, the FDA has
approved an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to allow treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed
COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients hospitalized with severe disease. In addition, remdesivir was
recently approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) to treat COVID-19
infection. Remdesivir also received a provisional acceptance by the Therapeutic Goods Administration
(TGA) of Australia to be used in adults and adolescents hospitalized with severe COVID-19 symptoms.

Finally, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently recommended granting a conditional marketing
authorization to remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age
with pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen. In vitro, remdesivir undergoes metabolism by
CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. It is not suitable for oral delivery because of its poor hepatic stability.

QT prolongation and TdP. Very little is known at this stage about the risk of drug-induced LQTS by
remdesivir. An IC50 of 28.9 mM has been estimated in vitro for block of hERG (IKr) (Table 1). Calculated
values for K/Cmax, K/Cmax free, and Long QT-JT index indicate that remdesivir use could carry a significant
risk, especially if its intravenous administration leads to high peak plasma levels. Therefore, close
monitoring on the QT interval appears warranted.

Running head: Drug-induced LQTS and repurposed COVID-19 drugs

DISCUSSION
Based on our literature search and use of information computed from databases, several currently
proposed drugs to be used off-label and repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19 are associated with a
significant risk of drug-induced LQTS. Therefore, mandatory monitoring of the QT interval should be
performed. Such monitoring could be easily performed for hospitalized patients, but would require the use
of biodevices for outpatients initiated on these drugs.
Several approaches have been proposed to assess risk of drug-induced LQTS. Among the most
important were the S7B and E14 International Conference on Harmonisation Guidances for non-clinical
and clinical evaluation of new non-antiarrhythmic human pharmaceuticals.

37, 38

After the introduction of

these guidelines in 2005, no drugs were removed from the market due to TdP risk. However, concerns
raised about the optimal fail-fast fail-safe paradigm in recent drug development programs led to
unnecessary removal of promising therapeutic molecules.

39

There were also concerns regarding the

financial burden associated with these types of studies; therefore, alternative approaches were
evaluated.40
In 2003, Redfern et al. published an exhaustive review on a broad range of drugs looking at hERG
(IKr) activity, cardiac action potential duration (at 90% repolarization; APD90), and QT prolongation in
dogs.

10

They compared these properties against QT prolonging effects of drugs and reports of TdP in

humans. The investigators considered the free plasma concentrations attained during clinical use and
classified drugs into five categories. Category 1 includes repolarization-prolonging antiarrhythmics;
Category 2 includes drugs that have been withdrawn or suspended from the market in at least one major
regulatory territory due to an unacceptable risk of TdP for the condition being treated; Category 3 includes
drugs that have a measurable incidence of TdP in humans, and those for which numerous case reports
exist in the published literature; Category 4 includes drugs for which there have been isolated reports of
TdP in humans; and Category 5 includes drugs for which there have been no published reports of TdP in
humans.
In 2013, Kramer et al. assessed concomitant block of multiple ion channels (Multiple Ion Channel
Effects, MICE) by measuring the concentration-responses of hERG (IKr), Nav1.5 (INa) and Cav1.2 (ICa-L)
currents for 32 torsadogenic and 23 non-torsadogenic drugs from multiple pharmacological classes.11 The

best logistic regression models using the MICE assay only required a comparison of the blocking
potencies between hERG and Cav1.2. Unfortunately, drug-specific indices or values associated with their
drug comparison model were not provided. Other much simpler indices, such as K/Cmax, i.e., IC50, for
block of IKr/peak plasma concentration (Cmax at maximum dose) or K/ Cmax free, i.e. IC50 for block of
IKr/Cmax unbound concentration (considering plasma protein binding) have also been proposed.10 Values
≤3 and ≤30 for these respective factors are generally considered indicative of high risk of drug-induced
LQTS.
More recently, the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative was established by a
partnership of several organizations. Their main objective was to develop a new paradigm for assessing
proarrhythmic risk, building on the emergence of new technologies and an expanded understanding of
41
torsadogenic mechanisms beyond IKr block. Their strategy involves the use of three pillars to evaluate

drug effects: 1) human ventricular ionic channel currents in heterologous expression systems, 2) in silico
integration of cellular electrophysiologic effects based on ionic current effects, and 3) fully integrated
biological systems (stem-cell-derived cardiac myocytes and the human ECG). In their most recent
publication, they reported on a list of 28 drugs under three risk categories.42 The High TdP Risk category
includes mostly Class III or Class 1A antiarrhythmics; the Intermediate Risk category groups drugs that
are generally accepted to be torsadogenic; and the Low Risk category included drugs known not to be
associated with TdP.
Other groups have concentrated their efforts on creating in silico tools for the early detection of druginduced proarrhythmic risks.13,

43

For instance, Romero et al. looked at the effects of drugs on action

potential duration of isolated endocardial, myocardial, and epicardial cells as well as the QT prolongation
in virtual tissues using multiple channel-drug interactions and state-of-the-art human ventricular action
potential models.

44

Based on 206,766 cellular and 7,072 tissue simulations assessing block of IKr, IKs and

ICa-L, they studied 84 compounds and classified 40 of them as torsadogenic. They proposed the use of a
new index, Tx, for differentiating torsadogenic compounds. Tx was defined as the ratio of the drug
concentrations producing 10% prolongation (similar to an IC10 rather than IC50) of the cellular endocardial,
midmyocardial, and epicardial APDs, and the QT interval, over the maximum effective free therapeutic
plasma concentration.

Running head: Drug-induced LQTS and repurposed COVID-19 drugs

For many years, a group led by Dr. Raymond Woosley has accumulated information on drugs
associated with LQTS.25 CredibleMeds® reviews available evidence for these drugs and places them into
one of three designated categories: “Known Risk” of TdP, “Possible Risk” of TdP, and “Conditional Risk”
of TdP. They have also created a list of drugs to avoid in patients with genetically inherited LQTS. The
merit of CredibleMeds® is the classification of drugs based on clinically observed and documented cases
of TdP of QT prolongation.
Another approach to assess risk of drug-induced LQTS is to use large collections of individual and
manufacturer-reported adverse drug events. One of the most popular resources for these types of reports
is the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), a data repository developed to support the FDA’s
post-marketing safety surveillance program. This program is charged with monitoring the occurrence and
safety signals of approximately 104 adverse events for drugs and therapeutic biologic products, as
standardized by the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Affairs. The FAERS repository contains information
on adverse drug events and medication error reports submitted to the FDA, and makes these reports
publicly available on a quarterly basis. Although it presents some limitations, the appropriate adjustment
of this data allows the capture of signals suggesting adverse drug events associated with a particular
drug. On an individual and/or population basis, FAERS data can be used to identify patients who are at
highest risk of adverse drug events using statistical approaches such as relative odds.
All of the sus-mentioned approaches are complementary while each having their own weaknesses
and strengths. Recognizing the complexity of determining the risk of drug-induced LQTS noted by
others45, our team has developed the Long QT-JT index, which uses algorithms that consider IC50 for
block of relevant ion channels (IKr, IKs, INa, ICa-L), inhibition of hERG trafficking, unbound Cmax at maximum
dose, and most importantly the inhibition of the major metabolic pathway involved in the disposition or
torsadogenic drugs.

16

This last factor is considered to be a major determinant of risk associated with

drug-induced LQTS when torsadogenic drugs are co-administered with other drugs in patients with
polypharmacy. On one hand, it is often stated that combined administration of IKr blocking drugs
(expected synergistic pharmacodynamic effects) could lead to increased QT prolongation. Although this
appears to be the case, our studies have demonstrated that concomitant block of IKr was not necessarily
associated with synergistic or potentiation of drug effects.46 However, our team has shown that a

Running head: Drug-induced LQTS and repurposed COVID-19 drugs
combined block of IKr and IKs was associated with potentiation of drug effects on cardiac repolarization.47
On the other hand, the role of competitive inhibition (pharmacokinetic interactions) due to inhibition of the
metabolism of the torsadogenic drug, leading to its increased systemic exposure, is recognized but often
overlooked.48 For the Long QT-JT index, a value ≤15 is associated with an increased risk of QT
prolongation and induction of TdP by the drug (“High Risk”), while a value >15 and ≤100 is associated
with an increased risk of QT prolongation (“Moderate Risk”); values >101 are qualified as “Low Risk”.
Arrhythmogenic effects of COVID-19 drugs could be expected, potentially contributing to disease
6
outcome. This may be of importance for patients with an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias, either

secondary to acquired conditions or co-morbidities or consequent to inherited syndromes.49 Especially,
patients with hepatic diseases, heart failure, renal failure and electrolyte disturbances are at increased
risk of drug-induced LQTS. In such context, taking into consideration patients’ characteristics, various
algorithms have been reported to identify patients that are more susceptible to experiencing drug induced
QT prolongation.50
Experimental COVID-19 use with mandatory monitoring of the QT interval is defensible because the
benefits of using some of the proposed drugs could outweigh the risks. Key considerations supporting
their use are:
1

The duration of use for these medications in COVID-19 is shorter than their original indication
(chronic vs five to ten days) thus, only a short-term monitoring would be required.

2

The overall potential population-benefits of those drugs if proven to be effective for COVID-19
compared to the number of patients at high risk for QT prolongation.
In addition to monitoring of the QT interval, samples should be collected and a biobank created to

support research efforts in the present and future. There is an urgent need for long-term, placebo
controlled, randomized clinical trials. It is recognized that polymorphisms in genes regulating the
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways of these drugs may impact an individual’s drug
response and consequently, the overall outcomes.
The risk-benefit assessment for the use of repurposed drugs for the treatment of COVID-19
remains unclear since benefits are currently awaited, not proven, but our search strategy indicates that

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS
•

Our study systematically explores current research and validated indices related to drug-induced
LQTS, in addition to consider the various mechanisms of action for these drugs to induce LQTS.

•

To our knowledge, this is the first comparison of risk for a prolonged QT interval and torsade de
pointes in the use of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, remdesivir or lopinavir/ritonavir to 23 wellknown torsadogenic drugs.

•

We also present a comprehensive analysis of arrhythmogenic events reported for COVID-19
drugs and torsadogenic compounds from the FAERS database.

•

Our conclusions are limited by the nature of data obtained from a literature search and extraction
from databases, limited availability of basic pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters
and clinical data for some of the newer COVID-19 drugs.

K channel block IC50/Cmax. A value less than 3 is considered at high risk of drug-induced LQTS and a value greater than 30 as low risk.

b.

K channel bloc IC50 /Cmax free drug. A value less than 30 is considered at high risk of drug-induced LQTS and a value greater than 300 as low risk.

The colors used summarize among the various estimators the level of risk: Very High Risk (red), Intermediate/Moderate Risk (dark yellow), Slight Risk (Pale Yellow) and Low Risk (Green). Drugs are
ordered alphabetically based on their Long QT-JT index classification from very high to low risk.
