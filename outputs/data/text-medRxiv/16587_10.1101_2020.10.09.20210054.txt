Abstract

19

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered

20

coronavirus. Despite strong efforts that have been taking place to control the pandemic globally,

21

the virus is on the rise in many countries. Hence, this study assessed the maternal health care

22

services utilization in the amid of the COVID-19 pandemic in West Shoa Zone, Central Ethiopia.

23

Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 844 pregnant women or those

24

gave birth in the last 6 months before the study. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to

25

select the study participants. The data were collected through face-to-face interview using a

26

semi-structured questionnaire. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the presence of

27

significant associations, and adjusted odds ratio with 95%CI was employed for the strength and

28

directions of association between the independent and outcome variables. A P-value of <0.05

29

was used to declare statistical significance. The prevalence of maternal health service utilization

30

during the COVID-19 pandemic was 64.8%. The odds of maternal health service utilization was

31

higher among mothers who had primary (AOR=2.16, 95%CI: 1.29-3.60), secondary (AOR=1.97,

32

95%CI: 1.13-3.44), and college and above education (AOR=2.89, 95%CI: 1.34-6.22) than those

33

who could not read and write. In addition, mothers who did travel 25-74 km (AOR= 0.37,

34

95%CI: 0.23-0.59) and 75-99 km (AOR= 0.10, 95%CI: 0.05-0.19) to reach health facility had a

35

lower odds of maternal health service utilization than those who did travel < 24 km. Moreover,

36

mothers who earn 1000-2000 (AOR= 3.10, 95%CI: 1.73-5.55) and > 2000 birr (AOR=2.66

37

95%CI: 1.52-4.64) had higher odds of maternal health service utilization than those who earn

38

<500 birr. Similarly, the odds of utilizing maternal health service were higher among mothers

39

who did not fear COVID-19 infection (AOR= 2.79, 95%CI: 1.85-4.20), who had not had to

Introduction

47

The novel coronavirus is a virus causing respiratory illness, commonly known as COVID-19 first

48

noted in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since then spread to countries in the world

49

[1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the virus outbreak as a global

50

pandemic on March 11, 2020 [2]. As of September 14, 2020, the virus has infected more than 28

51

million and killed more than 900,000 people [3]. Africa contributes 4% of infection (more than 1

52

million) and 3% deaths (more than 23,000) [3]. The WHO classifies maternal health services

53

into: antenatal care (ANC), delivery services, and postnatal care, as essential health services to

54

continue during the COVID-19 pandemics [4, 5].

55

The maternal deaths were predicted to rise by 17% in the best-scenario and 43% in the case of

56

the worst scenario due to the COVID-19 pandemics [6]. Movement restrictions, transport

57

challenges, and anxiety over possibly being exposed to coronavirus are acting as the barrier to

58

maternal health service utilization [6, 7]. The ongoing COVID-19 has affected the perceptions

59

of pregnant women; more than half of the participants in a study done in Naples hospital reported

60

the psychological impact of COVID-19 as severe, and a similar number of pregnant women to

61

worry of vertical transmission of the infection [7]. Strained health care systems, disruptions in

62

care, and redirected resources might result in non-pandemic-related maternal morbidity and

63

mortality and reproductive health crisis which are particularly true for African countries

64

including Ethiopia with low-resource health systems [6, 8]. Obstetric healthcare providers may

65

not be able to provide the highest quality care during the COVID-19 pandemic with essential

66

precautions in place, client-provider communication is severely affected and the time to get the

67

care needed may take longer as health workers try to protect themselves from the infection [9].

68

The International Confederation of Midwives and the Royal College of Midwives support

69

community birth (home birth) for healthy women if there are appropriate midwife staffing and

70

referrals are facilitated in obstetric emergencies, where these are not available, it may be

71

necessary to modify available services, seeking at all times to maximize the provision of safe and

72

positive birth experience to all women [4]. Ethiopia's midwives grapple with COVID-19 while

73

ensuring safe delivery, and maternal health workers reported that COVID-19 travel restrictions

74

in Ethiopia are forcing pregnant women to give birth at home [8]. Maternity services in low

75

resource countries are adapting to provide antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care amidst a rapidly

76

shifting health system environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic [10]. Economic despair due

77

to lost jobs, limited care, and restricted health services, overburdened health systems, restricted

78

travel, and changing priorities at the primary care level are some of the burdens women had to

79

face during the pandemic [11].

80

Many efforts have been taking place to enhance maternal health service utilization including

81

information, education, and communication to raise awareness regarding the protection of

82

mother and child during COVID-19, some countries have tried to open temporary birth centers,

83

help hotlines virtual consultation with obstetricians have been provided via telemedicine

84

services, to women seeking maternal health care service [6]. There is a consensus that the use of

85

maternal health care services reduces maternal and child mortality and improves the reproductive

86

health of women (12). Family planning, ANC, use of skilled delivery attendants, and PNC

87

services are maternal health services that can significantly reduce maternal morbidity and

88

mortality. Since the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is new to humans, only limited scientific

89

evidence is available to identify the impact of the disease on maternal health service delivery and

90

utilization particularly in low resource settings such as Ethiopia. Accordingly, understanding the

91

factors that affect maternal health care services delivery and utilization amid the COVID-19

92

pandemic could help to design appropriate strategies and policies towards the improvement of

93

maternal health service provision and utilization. Thus, this study aimed to assess the maternal

94

health care services (ANC, delivery, and PNC) utilization in the amid of the COVID-19

95

pandemic in West Shoa Zone, central Ethiopia.

96

Materials and Methods

97

Study design, setting, and population

98

A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among women who were pregnant and

99

those gave birth in the last 6 months of the study period in West Shoa Zone, central Ethiopia

100

from July 1 to July 30, 2020. West Shoa zone is one of the zones of the Oromia National

101

Regional state, its capital is located at114km distance to the western part of Addis Ababa, the

102

capital city of Ethiopia. Currently, this zone has a total population of 2.5 million with around 1.2

103

million men and 1.3 women living within an area of 14,788.78 square kilometers. There are

104

about 495,753 women of reproductive age and 100,283 mothers give births per year. West Shoa

105

zone has 23 districts with over 528 rural kebele and 58 urban kebele. Currently, there are 8

106

Hospitals, 92 health centers, and 528 health posts in the West Shoa Zone.

107

Sample size determination

108

The sample size was calculated using a single population proportion formula for the four

109

maternal health services (ANC, Institutional delivery, and PNC). After calculating the sample

110

size for the four maternal health services, the largest sample size was used as the overall sample

111

size of the study. The assumptions considered during sample size calculation includes; 95%

112

confidence interval, 5% the margin of error, and proportion of ANC visit 46% and proportion of

113

institutional delivery 29% [13], and the proportion of early PNC visit 47% [14] in West Shoa

114

zone from the previous study, and 10% non-response rate. The largest sample size calculated was

115

for the proportion of early PNC visit 47%, n = 383, and used as the overall sample size of the

116

study. The final sample size was 844 by considering 10 % non-response rate and the design

117

effect of 2.

118

Sampling techniques

119

A multi-stage stratified sampling technique was employed with strata of urban and rural kebele

120

in the district. Six districts were selected at the first stage by simple random sampling from a

121

total of 23 districts of West Shoa Zone. Then, kebele from the district was stratified into urban

122

and rural kebele. Accordingly, one kebele from the urban and two kebeles from rural were

123

enrolled from the selected districts by simple random sampling. Mothers who were pregnant or

124

gave birth in the last 6 months of the study were identified by doing a census in collaboration

125

with health extension workers through home to home visit. Then, number of the study population

126

was placed to each selected kebele using proportion to population size. After having the list of all

127

women in each selected kebele, mothers were included using systematic random sampling

128

techniques every interval of four.

129

Data collection tools and quality controls

130

Data were collected using semi-structured questionnaire through face-to-face interviews. The

131

questionnaire was adapted from related literature and modified based on the objectives of the

132

study and the cultural context of the study setting [3-8, 10, 11]. The tool consists of socio-

133

demographic characteristics, maternal health care services amid COVID-19 pandemic (ANC,

134

institutional delivery, and PNC) utilization, and impact of governmental emergency states

135

(transport, distance, mask, and mandatory quarantine). Data collectors were 10 BSc health

136

professionals, with health officers, Nurse, and Midwifery educational background. Pregnant

137

mothers and those who gave birth in the last 6 months were identified first by using health

138

extension workers to get their frame in the community. Data quality was assured during

139

collection, coding, entry, and analysis. A two-days training was given for the data collectors and

140

supervisors before actual data collection. The collected data were reviewed and checked for

141

consistency, clarity; completeness, and accuracy throughout the data collection process by data

142

collectors and supervisors. Furthermore, the pretest was done among 5% of the sample and the

143

result was used to modify the tool.

144

Data processing and analysis

145

Collected data were cleaned and entered using Epi data version 4.6 and analyzed using SPSS

146

version 23. Descriptive statistics were employed using frequencies, percentages, and diagrams.

147

Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were performed to identify the presence of

148

a significant association between independent variables and the dependent variable. Those

149

variables with p<0.2 in the bivariable analysis were considered for multivariable logistic

150

regression analysis. Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test was used to check model fitness

151

before running the final model. Finally, screened variables were fitted to the multivariable

152

logistic regression model through a backward stepwise method to reduce the effects of

153

cofounders and to identify the independent effects of each variable on the outcome variable. An

154

adjusted odds ratio for a 95% confidence interval was employed for the strength and directions

155

of association between independent variables and the outcome variables. A P-value of <0.05 was

156

used to declare statistical significance.

157

Operational Definitions

158

Maternal health service utilization was defined as; fully received ANC in line with their

159

gestational age, having institutional delivery, and any PNC visits during COVID-19. Those

160

maternal health care services utilization were assessed using yes or no questions.

161

Ethics statement

162

The ethical clearance was obtained from an ethical review committee of the college of medicine

163

and health sciences, Ambo University. A letter of support was submitted to each district health

164

office. Both written and verbal consent was obtained from each study subject before the data

165

collection process proceeded. During the data collection process, the data collectors had

166

informed each study participant about the objective and anticipated benefits of the research

167

project and the study participants were also informed of their full right to refuse, withdraw, or

168

completely reject part or all of their parts in the study.

Discussion

255

This study found the prevalence of maternal health service utilization was 64.8% [95%CI: 61.5-

256

68.0]. This prevalence is lower than the studies done in Ethiopia before the COVID-19 pandemic

257

[14, 15]. This might be due to the lockdown and movement restrictions brought about by the

258

ongoing pandemic and lack of transportation manifested as a result [16]. Also, the dread and

259

anxiety of visiting hospitals during COVID-19 has led many women to change their plan of

260

childbirth and they are planning to have home deliveries [6].

261

The current study reported that the odds of maternal health service utilization during the COVID-

262

19 pandemic were higher among mothers who had primary, secondary, and college and above

263

education than those who could not read and write. This is consistent with the study done in

264

developing countries [17], and Nigeria [18]. Moreover, mothers who earn more than 1000 birr

265

per month had higher odds of utilizing maternal health service during the COVID-19 pandemic

266

than those who earn < 500 birr. This is in agreement with the study done in developing countries

267

[17], and Nepal [19]. This is because economically independent women do not rely on other

268

people to decide to utilize maternal health services [20].

269

Furthermore, mothers who did travel 25-74 km and 75-99 km to reach the health facility were

270

63% and 90% less likely to utilize maternal health service during the COVID-19 pandemic than

271

those who did travel < 24 km to reach the health facility respectively. This might be due to a

272

change of plan of ANC follow-up, childbirth, and other maternal health services hence the first

273

delay, and planning to have home deliveries [6, 20]. Besides, the odds of utilizing maternal

274

health service during the COVID-19 pandemic in mothers who did not fear COVID-19 infection

275

was 2.79 times higher than those who did fear COVID-19 infection. This could be due to the

276

psychological and social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which is more pronounced in

277

women forcing them to plan home deliveries not to expose their family to the infection [6].

278

Besides, mothers who had not had to request permission from husband to visit health facility had

279

the higher odds of utilizing maternal health service during the COVID-19 pandemic than those

280

who had to request permission from the husband to visit a health facility. This is consistent with

281

the studies done in Ethiopia [14, 21]. This might be due to women's autonomy is positively

282

associated with maternal health service utilization. Also, women with control over resources

283

including physical, human, intellectual, and financial resources are more independent in deciding

284

and seeking health care [21]. The odds of utilizing maternal health service during the COVID-19

285

pandemic in those who practice COVID-19 prevention measure was 5.82 times higher than in

286

those who did not practice the prevention measure Similarly, the odds of maternal health service

287

utilization amidst COVID-19 were 2.06 times in mothers who use face mask than those mothers

288

who did not use a face mask. This is following the study done in Iran [22].

289

Conclusion

290

In this study, the prevalence of maternal health service utilization was found low. Furthermore,

291

maternal educational status, distance from the health facility, monthly estimated income, fear of

292

COVID-19 infection, permission request from husband to visit a health facility, and practicing

293

COVID-19 prevention measures were found to be significantly associated with maternal health

294

service utilization. The federal ministry of health and regional health bureau should work in

295

collaboration to aware of the community and mothers, in particular, to increase the maternal
