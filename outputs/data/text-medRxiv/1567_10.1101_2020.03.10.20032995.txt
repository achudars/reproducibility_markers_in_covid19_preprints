Summary
Background The epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan,
China, and now is spreading worldwide. The Chinese government responded to this
epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of
Wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering
events. Here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO (MH) to
reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in
Wuhan.
Methods A real-time status dynamic model was proposed to model the population of
Wuhan in status Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected with symptoms (I), with
Medical care (M), and Out of the system (O) daily. Model parameters were fitted
according to the daily report of new infections from Jan. 27th, 2020 to Feb. 2nd, 2020.
Using the fitted parameters, the epidemic under different conditions was simulated
and compared with the current situation.
Finding According to our study, the first patient is most likely appeared on Nov. 29th,
2019. There had already been 4,153 infected people and 6,536 exposed ones with the
basic reproduction number ଴ of 2.65 before lockdown, whereas ଴ dropped to
1.98 for the first 30 days after the lockdown. The peak point is Feb. 17th, 2020 with
24,115 infected people and the end point is Jun. 17th, 2020. In total, 77,453 people
will be infected. If lockdown imposed 7 days earlier, the total number of infected
people would be 21,508, while delaying the lockdown by 1-6 days would expand the
infection scale 1.23 to 4.94 times. A delay for 7 days would make the epidemic finally
out of control. Doubling the number of beds in hospitals would decrease the total
infections by 28%, and further investment in bed numbers would yield a diminishing
return. Last, public gathering events that increased the transmission parameter by 5%
in one single day would increase 4,243 infected people eventually.
Interpretation Our model forecasted that the peak time in Wuhan was Feb. 17th, 2020
and the epidemic in Wuhan is now under control. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is

currently a global public health threat for all nations. Multiple countries including
South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, and the United States are suffering from SARS-CoV-2.

against SARS-CoV-2, may provide useful guidance for other countries in dealing with
similar situations.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
The epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 has been currently believed to started from Wuhan,
China. The Chinese government started to report the data including infected, cured
and dead since Jan 20th, 2020. We searched PubMed and preprint archives for articles
published up to Feb 28th, 2020, which contained information about the Wuhan
outbreak using the terms of “SARS-CoV-2”, “2019-nCoV”, “COVID-19”, “public
health policies”, “coronavirus”, “CoV”, “Wuhan”, “transmission model”, etc. And a
number of articles were found to forecast the early dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2
epidemic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19. Several of them mentioned the
influence of city lockdown, whereas lacked research focused on revealing the impact
of public health policies for the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 through modeling study.
Added value of this study
As the first study systemically analysis the effect of three major public health policies
including 1) lockdown of Wuhan City, 2) construction of temporary hospitals and 3)
reduction of crowed gathering events in Wuhan city. The results demonstrated the
epidemic in Wuhan from the potential first patient to the end point as well as the
influence of public health policies are expected to provide useful guidance for other
countries in fighting against the epidemic of SRAS-CoV-2.
Implications of all the available evidence
Available evidence illustrated the human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, in
which the migration of people in China during the epidemic may quickly spread the
epidemic to the rest of the nation. These findings also suggested that the lockdown of
Wuhan city may slow down the spread of the epidemic in the rest of China.

Introduction
In December 2019, a pneumonia case caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2
was firstly reported in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, China1. The serious
clinical symptoms of the viral infection including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and
pneumonia, may result in progressive respiratory failure and even death2. The disease
which quickly spread to the rest of China and other continents, was currently been

named as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) 3,4. Till March 1st,
2020, at least 79,971 confirmed cases and 2,873 death caused by SARS-CoV-2 were
reported by the National Health Commission of China5.
The epidemiological study of SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumonia provided evidence
of human-to-human transmission6,7. Subsequently, the Chinese government quickly
responded to this epidemic with a series of public health policies. For example,
Wuhan, the largest city in central China with over 9 million permanent residents, was
blocked for both outside and internal transportation to contain the spread of the
epidemic on Jan 23rd, 2020 8. Meanwhile, 31 provinces, cities and autonomous
regions launched the level 1 public health response before Jan 30rd, 20209. Moreover,
multiple converted hospitals including Huoshenshan hospital, Leishenshan hospital,
and mobile cabin hospital were constructed or renovated to support the battle against
the epidemic in Hubei, China10.
Currently, several epidemic models were established for SARS-CoV-2 and the
basic
reproductive number R0 was estimated from 2 to 511-14. The rapid transmission at the
early stages might have been accelerated because of the out-break time is close to the
Chinese Lunar New Year. The positive news is, besides Hubei province, the daily
increase of new laboratory-confirmed patients in other regions of China has been
declining since the peak on Feb 3rd, 2020, 11 days after the lockdown of Wuhan and 4
days after level 1 public health response in other regions 15. This further indicated that
timely public health policies might significantly prevent the rapid spread of the
epidemic.
Here, we proposed a status dynamic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Out of the
system (with Medical care/maximum beds in Hospital) SEIO (MH) model, to reveal
the influence of the national public health response for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics
outbreak
in
Wuhan,
China.
Different
from
the
traditional
Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) continuous model13. SEIO(MH)
model is a real-time discrete model with two more essential parameters: 1) the
number of people with medical care (M), and 2) the currently available beds in
hospitals. The local status dynamic SEIO (MH) model could simulate the population
in each status at any date during the epidemic. Also, this model could simulate
multiple national public health responses including: 1) lockdown of the traffic in one
city, 2) the hospital bed shortage as well as the amelioration in the medical system
when multiple converted hospitals are available, and 3) the temporary public
gathering events.
According to the simulation results, the first patient (patient zero) was more likely
to appear on Nov. 29th, 2019. From Nov. 29th, 2019 to Jan. 23th, 2020, the basic
reproduction number ଴ was estimated at 2.65 before the lockdown of Wuhan. Till
Jan 22th, 2020 before lockdown, the cumulative number of infections and exposures
was 4,153 and 6,536, respectively. After the lockdown, the value of ଴ decreased to
1.98 for the first 30 days. The peak point was simulated on Feb. 17th, 2020 with
24,115 infected people and the endpoint would be near June 17th, 2020. The total
number of infected people in Wuhan was predicted to be 77,453. Moreover, we also

simulated the infections under the three aforementioned public health responses. The
construction of this model could not only study the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic outbreak
in Wuhan, but also help design appropriate national public health policies for other
countries.

Results
Model construction and status dynamic modeling of epidemic in Wuhan
The parameters of the status dynamic SEIO (MH) model were fitted according to the
daily reports of new infections in Wuhan from Jan 27th to Feb 2th, during which the
daily new increase of people in status  was monotonously increasing with time. The
initial number of people in status  and  were simulated from 500 to 10,000, while
parameter  and  were simulated from 10-9 to 10-11, respectively. Also, the median
time of people from status  to status  and people from status  to status  were
simulated according to the increasing number of cured and dead from Jan 27th to Feb
2th. By minimizing the absolute error to the ground truth number in status , the
statuses on Jan 27th can be inferred.
Based on the fitted parameters, the simulation showed that it would take 14 days
for people to transfer from status  to status . For those out of the system before
been hospitalized, it would take 28 days to transfer from status  to status . Results
also illustrated that at the initial date 0 for fitting on Jan 26th, there were 3,998
symptomatic infections, 7,984 contacts, 3,815 hospitalizations and 696 out of the
system (Cured or Dead) in Wuhan, in which the accumulative number of infected

people (I  M  O) raised up to 8,509 on Jan 26th.
With the default parameters, the epidemic in Wuhan was described by local status
dynamic SEIO (MH) modeling. Illustrated in Figure 2a, patient zero was inferred to
appear on Nov. 29th, 2019. From that day to Jan 23th, 2020, when less intervention
was applied to prevent the epidemic, the number of infected people increased
exponentially. After Jan 23th, the circulation intensity of people in Wuhan decreased
sharply after the city lockdown 19. However, the people infected with symptoms,
exposed and in hospitalization were estimated to be 1,682, 6,536 and 2,471
respectively on Jan 22nd, 2020 and increased to 1,999, 7,676 and 2,877 respectively on
Jan 23rd, 2020 (Figure 2b), which was a large population with infected people and
would lead to the outbreaks of the epidemic in the early period even after the
lockdown.
Notably, the hospital was full of people (>80% of the current ) in status  from
Jan 22th, 2020 to Feb 10th, 2020. After the increasing number of beds in hospitals at
Date Jan 25th, Jan 31th, Feb 6th, and Feb 10th, the hospital was still full immediately,
indicating the deficiency of medical resources in Wuhan at the early period (Figure
2a). After the large scale of mobile cabin hospitals, the shortage of beds in hospitals
was improved. We expected that the peak point in Wuhan would be Feb 17th, 2020
with 24,115 infected people, including 7,676 exposed, 1,999 infected with symptoms
and 2,877 with medical care (Figure 2c), and the epidemic would end on Jun. 17th,
2020 with 77,453 infected people eventually, which was basically consistent with
Yang’s study 14. The basic reproduction number ଴ was estimated to be 2.65 and
would drop to 1.98 after one month since the lockdown. This result suggested that the
choice of lockdown date and the number of hospital beds would significantly affect
the development of the epidemic. Also, it should be noticed that the time of the
epidemic period is overlapped with the Chinese Lunar New Year, in which public
gathering events are expected. Thus, 1) the date of lockdown, 2) the number of
available hospital beds 3) the public gathering events, were considered in our
simulation.

Impact of different public health policies
Impact of the lockdown of Wuhan. Here, we studied the effect of advancing or
delaying the lockdown date by 1 to 7 days. Results indicated that, if Wuhan was
blocked on Jan 16th, the accumulated infectious
would be 4,063 on Jan
th
22 , which was slightly below 4,521 on the same date in current status. However, the
exposed people on Jan 22th were 2,427, only 37% of the simulated number
(2,428/6,536) with the current lockdown date. Moreover, the peak time and endpoint

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20032995; this version posted March 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

would be advanced by 10 days (Figure 3). The total number of infected people would
be 21,508, 28% (21,508/77,453) of the current situation and even one-day advance
would cause only 82% (63,226/77,453) infections at the end point (Table 1).
On the contrary, if the lockdown was delayed by 1 to 7 days, the peak number
would be dramatically increased. It could be found that, if the city was blocked 1 to 6
days later than Jan. 23th, 2020, the total infected people would be 1.23 times (95,273),
1.47 times (114,105), 1.83 times (141,409), 2.28 times (176,300), 2.90 times (222,384)
and 4.94 times (382,695) than Jan. 23th, 2020 (Supplementary Figure 1 & Table 1),
which was also consistent with one previous study 14. When the lockdown was 7 days
later than the current choice, the first peak would arrive at Mar. 1st, 2020 with 97,779
infected people and the second peak would reach 243,693 on Sept. 1st, 2020. The
number of total infected people would exceed 1.9 million and make the epidemic
uncontrollable within the year 2020 (Figure 3b).
Impact of hospital bed numbers. Our simulation results showed that there was a
shortage of hospital beds at the early stage of the epidemic, in which people in status
 would not be completely isolated and treated with medical care. In that case, we
simulated the effect of hospital bed numbers by multiplying its value by factors from
0.5 to 3 times, for each time point compared with current situations. Results indicated
that if the beds in hospitals were halved, the peak time and endpoint would be Feb.
26th and Jul. 15th, respectively. Moreover, 34,526 total infectious would be observed
in the peak time, 1.43 times than the current situation, and 148,848 people would be
infected eventually (Figure 3c). If the beds in hospitals were 1.5, 2, 2,5 and 3 times
compared to the current situation, the total infectious number would be 62,353,
56,031, 53,245 and 51,898, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Typically, tripling
the beds in hospitals would end the epidemic 9 days earlier than the current situation
(Figure 3d). Different from the lockdown of the city, when beds in hospitals were 2
times of current situations at each time point, the effect of increasing beds in hospitals
was no longer significant (Supplementary Figure 2). In fact, when increasing the beds
of hospitals by 3 times of the current situation, the total infectious at the endpoint
would only decrease by 2.6% (1,347) than the 2.5-fold increase.
Impact of public gathering events. Since the time of the epidemic was overlapped
with the Chinese Spring Festival and winter holiday, people were gathering together
for celebration during the epidemic time. Thus, public gathering events would
frequently happen if no prevention policies were imposed. For example, Wuhan
conducted the banquet for ten thousand families on Jan 18th, 2020 20, 5 days before the
city lockdown. Here, we simulated the impact of public gathering events by
increasing the transmission parameter α from 5% to 25% in an individual day such as
Jan 20th, 2020.
Results showed that, if we increase α by 5% in one single day such as Jan 20th, the
number of infections in peak time and end point will increase by 1,237 (5%) and
4,243(5%), respectively (Figure 3e). If α is increased by 25%, the number of people in
peak time and endpoint will increase by 7,449 (31%) and 24,929 (32%), respectively
(Figure 3f). Other results were also illustrated in Supplementary Figure 3 &
Supplementary Table 2. Thus, the public gathering events in one single day could

significantly impact the epidemic.
Generally, we believe the impact of locking down the city is more significant than
the increasing number of beds in hospitals and public gathering events. The delay of
city lockdown might easily make the epidemic out of control. Also, the public
gathering events were inconducive for the prevention and control of the epidemic,
since the slight increase of transmission parameter α would significantly affect the
total infectious numbers at the end point. The number of beds in hospitals was
essential in the early period of the epidemic when infected people increased rapidly,
after the peak point, the beds would be enough for the increasing number of infected
people.

Simulation of no intervention and early time to release the Wuhan
Finally, we simulated the extreme situation that no intervention is performed. The
circulation intensity in the same time period last year was derived from BAIDU
migration data 17 to generated the α and β without any interventions. By setting the
total number in human as 9 million 21 the results showed that the ଴ would reach to
4.4 and over 7,697,484 people would be infected on Jun. 21st, 2019 (Figure 4a), which
indicated that the epidemic was totally out of control without any intervention.
Another issue was about the early release of Wuhan. We experimented with the
release time point of 150 days after the occurrence of patient zero, which is Apr. 27th,
2020 (Figure 4b). Results showed that, at that time the epidemic seemed to be under
control with only 168 infected with symptoms and 2,912 with medical care on Apr.
27th, 2020 (Figure 4c) and kept decreasing until Mar 9th, 2020, in which the status
number of infected with symptoms and 2,912 with medical care was 178 and 2,201
respectively. However, the number of exposed people increased from 863 on Apr. 27th
to 1,085 on Mar 9th, 2020, with the epidemic rapidly rebounded. After 120 days of
releasing the city, on Aug. 25th, 2020, 11,203 exposed, 2,315 infected with symptoms
and 20,516 with medical care were predicted (Figure 4d). The beds in hospitals would
not be enough again on Oct. 2nd, 2020 with over 256,730 accumulated infections.
Although the transmission parameter α and β would not be the same as those before
the lockdown, they were both increased by 25% (compared to the values during
lockdown) to simulate the early release of the city. The results indicated that it was
still a great risk to release the city before the epidemic reached the end point, even

Discussion
The epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 has spread to China and multiple continents, which
will be developed into a worldwide epidemic. During the epidemic period,
nowcasting and forecasting are crucial for public health planning and control
domestically and internationally 12,22. Here, we constructed a real-time status dynamic
SEIO (MH) model to estimate the local outbreaks. By adding the parameters of status
M and H, this model could accurately forecast the epidemics when the medical system
under unexpected pressure. Moreover, this model could simulate the influence of
different public health policies such as 1) lockdown of the city and 2) construction of
temporary hospitals, which could help design the appropriate public health policies
for epidemic control. At present, besides Wuhan, the epidemic situation in China has
been effectively contained within a short period of time. This is largely due to the
rapid response of the Chinese governments at various levels and the decision to lock
down Wuhan, which is the first time to block a city with over 9 million permanent
residents in human history. The lockdown of Wuhan would not only prevent the
transportation between Wuhan to other cities, but also decrease the circulation
intensity of people within Wuhan. According to BAIDU migration data, the
circulation index of Wuhan is 6 to 8 times lower than those before the lockdown. The
number of newly confirmed cases increased rapidly after the lockdown may due to the
fact that, there have been already 4,521 infected and 6,536 exposed without symptoms
before lockdown. It is noted that only 444 confirmed cases were reported by the
Health Commission of Hubei Province 16. However, by facing an epidemic with the
new pathogen, it is difficult to invent the diagnosis kit in such a short time. Thus, the
diagnosis quantity might affect the early understanding of the epidemics and the
lockdown decision at that time was decisive and timely. In fact, even one day delay of
the lockdown would make 17,631 more infected people at the end point and a
one-week delay would make the epidemic in Wuhan uncontrollable with over 1.9
million infectious.
Despite the advantage of epidemic control, the lockdown of Wuhan has
significantly increased the pressure of local medical resources, including the rapidly
growing demands for hospitalization, lack of medical staff such as doctors and nurses,
and shortage of medical supplies. The simulation results illustrated the establishment
of new temporary hospitals that could accommodate more patients could significantly
help the control of the epidemic. In fact, if the beds in hospitals were three times more
than the current situation, the total infectious would decrease by 33% at the end point.
After the period of rapidly rising, beds in hospitals were not an essential parameter
since the daily increase of infected people was less than the people out of the system.
The lock of medical staff and the shortage of medical supplies increased the death rate
in Wuhan, which was significantly higher than the rest of China. Based on this
situation, multiple provinces sent medical teams and supplies to support Wuhan for
epidemic control and treatment, which might help improve the curative ratio. Till Feb.

5th, 2020, nearly 7,000 medical staff were sent to Wuhan by governments at all levels
in China 23.
Another noteworthy point is the public gathering events. Since the epidemic is
overlapped with the Chinese Lunar New Year, public gathering events such as
banquet of one thousand families in Wuhan could promote the spread of the epidemic.
By adding a small turbulence (5%) in transmission parameter α on Jan 20th, 2020,
4,194 more people would be infected at the end point, which indicated the public
gathering events at the early period of the epidemic should be stopped. Thus, the
Chinese government prohibited the public gathering events with policies such as close
large public places, extend the winter holiday for both staff and students. It is noted
that, Japan and Koran also organized public gathering activities such as marathons,
sacrifices activities, and rally in early February, 2020, which would be inconducive to
the prevention and control of the epidemic.
The model forecasted that the peak time in Wuhan has been past and the epidemic
in China is now under control. Currently, multiple countries including Koran, Japan,
Iran, Italy, and the United States are in the outbreak stage 24. As the first country
facing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the experience of China in fighting the epidemics
might provide useful guidance for other countries. According to our modeling study,
we believe that the most effective public health policies for SARS-CoV-2 epidemic
prevention are provided as follows: 1) reduce the local circulation intensity of people,
2) prepare enough medical resources, especially available beds in hospitals, 3) try to
prohibit large public gathering events. It is expected that this study might provide
useful guidance for other countries in fighting against the epidemic of COVID-19 or
other similar infectious diseases.
