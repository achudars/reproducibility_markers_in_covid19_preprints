ABSTRACT

35

Background/Objectives: This was an out-of-hospital screening of health status and

36

lifestyle during the Covid-19 pandemic in post-operative bariatric patients from Sao

37

Paulo, Brazil, prevented from face-to-face health care. Subjects/Methods: In this cross-

38

sectional study, 66 patients were remotely (via phone call) and in-person (by home visit)

39

assessed for health status and lifestyle habits. Results: Mean age was 47.4 years. Patients

40

were obese grade I (30.0%), II (22.0%), and III (30.0%), and 94.2% had above reference

41

waist circumference values. Sixty-four percent displayed high blood pressure, whereas

42

24% showed CRP levels above normal range. Nineteen percent of patients reported

43

irregular use of nutritional supplementation and 6.0% reported binge eating habits.

44

Thirty-three exhibited symptoms of depression. Mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-

45

severe anxiety symptoms were reported by 27.4% and 11.3% of the patients; 4.5%

46

exhibited suicidal ideation and were referred to a specialist for healthcare. Of relevance,

47

inactive patients (59.6%) had poorer global mental and physical health scores as

48

compared to active peers (both p<0.05). Conclusion: This out-of-hospital screening

49

revealed that the absence of face-to-face health care due to the Covid-19 pandemic is

50

associated with suboptimal status of physical and mental health as well as lifestyle

51

inadequacies among patients who have recently undergone bariatric surgery.

52

Key-words: bariatric surgery, obesity, health care, social isolation, SARS-CoV-2.

As of July 30, Brazil counted over 2,556,207 cases and over 90,000 deaths due to

72

Covid-19, with disease spread continuing unabated. On March 24, the government of Sao

73

Paulo, the epicenter of the pandemic in Latin America, issued a set of measures for social

74

distancing (including a stay-at-home order) to contain new cases and mitigate virus

75

contagion. Simultaneously, COVID-19 is placing enormous pressure on public health

76

systems across the globe. The Clinical Hospital in the School of Medicine at the

77

University of Sao Paulo, the largest quaternary hospital in Latin America, responded to

78

the outbreak by reassigning 1,000 beds exclusively for patients diagnosed with Covid-19.

79

As a result, however, elective medical appointments had to be temporarily suspended,

80

potentially predisposing patients with complex conditions to deterioration in overall

81

health and quality of life.

82

Out of concern that COVID-19 has created a situation where at-risk patients are

83

confined with little or no access to face-to-face health care, we performed an out-of-

84

hospital screening of health status and lifestyle habits remotely (by phone calls and/or

85

visiting at home) among patients who recently underwent bariatric surgery, a condition

86

that requires systematic health care follow-up to ensure patient safety and to sustain the

87

benefits of the surgical procedure 1,2,3. Data were collected between April 20 and July 9,

88

2020, a period in which social distancing measures were in place in the city of Sao Paulo,

89

Brazil. This study was approved by the local ethical committee, and patients provided

90

written informed consent before participation.

91

We assessed post-bariatric patients from the outpatient Bariatric Surgery Clinic,

92

in the Clinical Hospital at the University of Sao Paulo. Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years

93

old, with a surgery elapsed time ≤ 12 months, and without any COVID-19 symptoms.

94

The 66 participants received one home visit and/or three phone calls for interview.

95

Twelve patients (18.2%) were interviewed by phone calls only as they lived outside Sao

Paulo city. During the visit, patients completed a demographic questionnaire that included

97

information about age, sex, self-reported use of medication and comorbidities. Following

98

a 10-min rest, blood pressure was measured three times using an automated device

99

(Omron, HEM-7122). Fasting blood samples were collected to analyze glucose, lipid

100

profile, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Anthropometric measures (waist circumference,

101

weight and height) were also performed 4. Reference values for cardiometabolic risk

102

factors were: ≤120 mmHg and/or ≤80 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure 5;

103

<80 cm and <94 cm for waist circumference for men and women 6, respectively, ≤99

104

mg/dL for fasting glucose level; <150 mg/dL, >40 mg/dL, ≤129 mg/dL, and <190 mg/dL

105

for triglycerides, HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol, respectively; <5.0 mg/dL for CRP.

106

The references values for blood biochemistry were provided by the Central Laboratory

107

of the Clinical Hospital.

108

Through phone calls, participants responded to a questionnaire about adherence

109

to daily vitamin/mineral supplementation 7, binge eating 8, depression symptoms 9,

110

anxiety 10, health-related quality of life 11, physical activity level 12, and socioeconomic

111

status 13.

112

Data are descriptively presented as mean (95%CI) or absolute and relative

113

frequency (n, %). Individuals were categorically classified for the following parameters:

114

adherence to daily vitamin/mineral supplementation (‘yes’ or ‘no’); binge eating score (≤

115

17: ‘absence’, 18 – 26: ‘mild to moderate’, and > 27: ‘severe’); depression symptoms

116

(score of 0 – 9: ‘no or minimal symptoms’, 10 – 18: ‘mild-to-moderate symptoms’, 19 –

117

29: ‘moderate-to-severe, 30 – 63: ‘severe symptoms’); and anxiety (score of 0 – 7:

118

‘normal or absence’, 8 – 15: ‘mild to moderate symptoms’, 16 – 25: ‘moderate to severe

119

symptoms’, 26 – 63: ‘severe’). In addition, physically active and inactive patients were

120

compared for health-related quality of life, depression and anxiety scores by Mann-

Whitney test, using SPSS (Version 20.0, Chicago, IL). Significance level was set at p <

122

0.05.

123

Patients were 47.4 years old (44.6, 50.1), 56 (84.8%) were women, and 4 (8.7%)

124

were smokers. Fifty-seven (86.3%) patients were economically vulnerable, with a self-

125

reported family income < 485 BRL per month. Forty-eight (72.7%) and 18 (27.3%)

126

underwent gastrointestinal bypass Y-in-Roux surgery and sleeve gastrectomy,

127

respectively. The post-operative average time was 7.2 months (6.7, 7.9) and BMI was

128

35.5 kg/m2 (33.6, 37.4). Twenty-eight (60.9%) patients self-reported the presence of

129

comorbidities. Patients self-reported the use of antihypertensive (15, 34.1%), antidiabetic

130

(5, 11.4%), antihypothyroid (5, 11.4%), and antidepressant drugs (1, 2.3%).

131

Fifteen (30.0%), 11 (22.0%) and 15 (30.0%) patients were classified as having

132

obesity grade I, II and III, respectively. Forty-nine (94.2%) had above reference waist

133

circumference values. Thirty-four (65.4%) displayed high blood pressure. Twenty-three

134

(16.7%) showed high glucose levels. Four (8.0%) had abnormal levels of HDL, LDL, and

135

TG, whereas 12 (24%) showed CRP levels above the normal range (Figure 1, Panel A).

136
137

Twelve (19.0%) patients reported irregular use of nutritional supplementation, and
4 (6.0%) patients reported binge eating habits.

138

Twelve (19.7%), 6 (9.8%), 2 (3.3%) exhibited mild-to-moderate, moderate-to-

139

severe or severe symptoms of depression, respectively. Mild-to-moderate anxiety and

140

moderate-to-severe or severe anxiety symptoms were reported by 17 (27.4%) and 7

141

(11.3%) of the patients, respectively. Three (4.5%) patients were urgently referred to a

142

medical specialist because they exhibited suicidal ideation.

143

SF-36 physical score was 74.7 (70.2, 79.3) and mental health score was 77.4 (73.5,

showed worsen global scores of mental and physical health as compared with active peers

146

(p = 0.02 and p = 0.04, respectively; Figure 1, Panel B). There were no differences

147

between active and inactive for depression symptoms and anxiety scores (both p > 0.05).

148

The shortage of essential medical care has become a major health concern as the

149

Covid-19 pandemic continues to unfold. The population of Sao Paulo, Brazil, has been

150

severely impacted due to the very-high prevalence of Covid-19 cases, and as the health

151

system promptly adjusted to accommodate infected patients, the problem of access to

152

essential care escalated, leading to concerns about suboptimal care of patients with other

153

chronic conditions. Patients who have had bariatric surgery are particularly vulnerable

154

because they require monitoring for adverse surgical events and some are at increased

155

risk for mental and physical disorders

156

recently pointed out the importance of postoperative monitoring for this population in

157

times of pandemic 16. Therefore, we screened recently operated patients in order to obtain

158

objective data for overall health, quality of life and lifestyle. These patients were

159

economically vulnerable, refrained from in-hospital care and advised to adhere to social

160

isolation.

14, 15

. The Diabetes Surgery Summit consensus

161

Our main findings suggest that a concerningly large percentage of patients

162

presented with abnormal blood pressure, and ~25% had increased systemic inflammation

163

(assessed by CRP). Moreover, about one third showed mild to severe symptoms of

164

depression, whereas ~40% showed mild to severe anxiety symptoms. This suggests

165

possible deviations from the lifestyle recommendations for postoperative care.

166

Approximately 20% of the patients were not complying with vitamin/mineral

167

supplementation. Importantly, ~60% failed to meet the prescribed physical activities

168

recommendations, which is actually the reversed depiction of what we have observed in

169

a group of patients from the same outpatient clinic before the pandemic (unpublished

data). Sub-optimal nutritional care combined with physical inactivity may reverse the

171

clinical improvements brought about by surgery, even in a short period of time

172

relevance, physically inactive patients exhibited lower mental and physical quality of life

173

scores when compared with active ones, supporting the idea that lifestyle plays a role in

174

the patients’ perceived well-being.

17-19

. Of

175

Overall, our data suggest that surveillance of patients who have undergone

176

bariatric surgery during the current pandemic identifies cases needing direct face-to-face

177

care with health providers. As a point of emphasis, three patients who revealed suicidal

178

ideation had to be immediately referred to a specialist. Telemedicine strategies that are

179

supervised by specialist bariatric and metabolic surgery providers have been

180

recommended for management of patients who have had surgery. In deprived regions

181

with limited or no access to telemedicine, ‘in loco’ strategies may be the only viable

182

alternative. In Brazil, the universal healthcare system works with ‘community health

183

agents’, who are non-medical personnel that could be trained to help in the surveillance

184

of at-risk groups, such as postoperative bariatric patients, during the pandemic.

185
186

The limitations of this study include the limited number of patients, the crosssectional nature of the screening, and the need for more in-depth clinical assessments.

187

In conclusion, this out-of-hospital screening revealed that the absence of in-person

188

health care due to the Covid-19 pandemic is associated with the emergence of moderate

189

to severe physical and mental health conditions as well as lifestyle inadequacies among

190

patients who have recently undergone bariatric surgery. The design of this study does not

191

allow us to conclude whether the patients’ overall health deteriorated as a consequence

192

of the pandemic, but it does indicate that there are a considerable number of post-surgery

193

patients in need of direct health care.
