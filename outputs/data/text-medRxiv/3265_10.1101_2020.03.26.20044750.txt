Abstract
Background: Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, school closures and
travel restrictions are often implemented to control outbreaks of infectious diseases. For
influenza in schools, the Center of Disease Control (CDC) recommends that febrile students
remain isolated at home until they have been fever-free for at least one day and a related policy is
recommended for SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19). Other authors proposed using a school week of
four or fewer days of in-person instruction for all students to reduce transmission. However,
there is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of these interventions.
Methods: We introduced a mathematical model of school outbreaks that considers both
intervention methods. Our model accounts for the school structure and schedule, as well as the
time-progression of fever symptoms and viral shedding. The model was validated on outbreaks
of seasonal and pandemic influenza and COVID-19 in schools. It was then used to estimate the
outbreak curves and the proportion of the population infected (attack rate) under the proposed
interventions.

Results: For influenza, the CDC-recommended one day of post-fever isolation can reduce the
attack rate by a median (interquartile range) of 29 (13 - 59)%. With two days of post-fever
isolation the attack rate could be reduced by 70 (55 - 85)%. Alternatively, shortening the school
week to four and three days reduces the attack rate by 73 (64 - 88)% and 93 (91 - 97)%,
respectively. For COVID-19, application of post-fever isolation policy was found to be less
effective and reduced the attack rate by 10 (5 - 17)% for a two-day isolation policy and by 14 (5 26)% for 14 days. A four-day school week would reduce the median attack rate in a COVID-19
outbreak by 57 (52 - 64)%, while a three-day school week would reduce it by 81 (79 - 83)%. In
both infections, shortening the school week significantly reduced the duration of outbreaks.
Conclusions: Shortening the school week could be an important tool for controlling influenza
and COVID-19 in schools and similar settings. Additionally, the CDC-recommended post-fever
isolation policy for influenza could be enhanced by requiring two days of isolation instead of
one.

Introduction
Respiratory infections are the leading cause of death in low- or middle-income countries and
account for an estimated four million deaths annually1. For rapidly emerging outbreaks such as
novel strains of influenza or SARS-CoV-2, pharmaceutical measures may be unavailable or
ineffective, in which case non-pharmaceutical intervention measures (NPIs) may be the first line
of response against infection2,3. However, when the World Health Organization (WHO)
systematically reviewed all studies supporting NPIs for controlling pandemic influenza, many of
the available NPIs lacked sufficient evidence of effectiveness4 and it was unclear whether these
measures could be effective at controlling COVID-19 (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2
virus).

Our study directly addresses this gap by using a computational model to examine the impact of
several NPIs, focusing on a shortened school week and symptom-based isolation policies. The
shortened school week policy involves closure of the school for additional days to extend the
weekend (e.g. closure every Thursday and Friday)5,6, thus creating a period of additional physical
isolation between the students, and possibly conducting at-home learning on those days. The
symptom-based isolation policy involves isolating individuals at the onset and for the duration of
fever symptoms, normally followed by additional days of isolation.
For controlling pandemic and seasonal influenza outbreaks, the symptom-based NPI with one
day of post-fever isolation is currently recommended by the US Centers of Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC)7 , and is referred to as fever absenteeism or a return-to-school policy9. The

buffer period of one day reduces transmission from infectious students in situations where their

fever symptoms temporarily subside or when they are shedding virus at the end of the course of
illness10.
For COVID-19 outbreaks, there are currently divergent recommendations from public health
authorities, and there have been several changes in guidelines. For symptomatic patients, the
WHO currently recommends 10 days of isolation after symptom onset, plus at least 3 additional
days without symptoms, while for asymptomatic patients it recommends 10 days after positive
test for SARS-CoV-211. The CDC recommends that patients with COVID-19 symptoms isolate
until they have met all three conditions: (1) they have been fever-free for 24 hours without the
use of fever-reducing medications, (2) it has been 10 days since the onset of their symptoms and
(3) their COVID-19 symptoms have been improving12. Finally, the Swedish Public Health
Agency (SPHA), which previously required two days free of symptoms, currently gives the
schools control in establishing their own isolation policies13.
To evaluate the various NPIs, our model computationally simulates outbreaks of influenza and
COVID-19 in school settings, and then looks at the effect of isolation policies on the attack rate
(i.e. the proportion of the student population infected over the duration of the outbreak) and the
outbreak curve (i.e. prevalence of infected students at each day of the outbreak). Our work builds
upon previous studies that have applied mathematical models to school-based influenza
transmission14–17. The policy of symptom monitoring, which isolates contacts after onset of
symptoms, has been examined computationally and shown to be sufficient for controlling certain
outbreaks18. Several studies also modeled non-pharmaceutical interventions such as closures but
not absenteeism policies17,19–30. We retrieved all studies that evaluated isolation policies by using
a broad search on PubMed and found that many modeling studies assumed isolation for a fixed
interval following diagnosis but not in a symptom-dependent way16. We also found several

comprehensive computational studies of school closures and isolation of infected students16,31, but
did not find evaluation of symptom-based isolation policies. The policy of shortening school
weeks was recently examined in a modeling study6 that found that closures for ten days followed
by four days of schooling could be effective in controlling COVID-19, but our model is the first
to examine the modification of a standard five-day school schedule.

Despite the promise of post-fever isolation for both COVID-19 and influenza, we hypothesized
at the outset of this project that the policy would merely have a small effect in controlling
outbreaks. We speculated that the CDC-recommended single day of post-fever isolation might
not be enough to achieve a meaningful reduction in influenza transmission. Furthermore,
parental non-compliance may make the policy ineffective. As compared to influenza, the policy
would be less effective in COVID-19 outbreaks since children have a higher rate of
asymptomatic infections32. On the other hand, if the policy were proven effective for either
outbreak, it is not known whether one day of post-fever isolation is optimal, and the model could
help determine if additional days of isolation would be beneficial. Additionally, we hypothesized
that the short school-week policy, although disruptive, may be more effective for both infections
since it could be easier to enforce than symptom-based isolation. In the case of COVID-19, the
policy has the advantage of not being affected by the low rate of symptomatic infections among
children32.

Materials and Methods
We use a deterministic compartmental dynamical model known as the Susceptible, Exposed,
Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) model that tracks the number of individuals of various cohorts and

immunological states for each day during an outbreak (Figure 1). This class of SEIR models has
R
been used extensively to model influenza14,20,33,34 and COVID-1935,36, and we extended the SEIR
framework in order to account for isolation policies.

Figure 1: Dynamics of the outbreak model and its major variables. S, susceptible; H, infected isolated; I, infected
unisolated; R, recovered; and V, vaccinated or immune (if a vaccine is available). The infected classes (H and I) are
stratified to cohorts (shown here is the case of a single cohort), and n daily disease stages distinguished by severity
of symptoms and viral shedding (9 daily stages of viral shedding for influenza and 32 stages for COVID-19, see
Supplementary Article S1). The cohort structure and other parameters are adjustable to model outbreaks in different
nt
settings and by different pathogens. Vaccination is available only for some outbreaks and generally has incomplete
coverage and efficacy.

Our model is particularly novel as it further stratifies the population by both the day of their
infection, their location (isolated at home vs. not isolated in school) and their grade, with
students in the same grade generally having closer contacts to peers in the same grade37 (see
Supplemental Article S1 - Expanded Methods for details). In the model, the day of infection
determines the rate of virus shedding and the probability of symptoms, which then influences the

likelihood of isolating at home or returning to school. The probability of isolating was also based
on the stage of the illness, as well as the isolation policy. The model allowed a vaccine to be
received by some students, if the vaccine is available ahead of the outbreak, attaining partial
protection against the infection. The model also considered any pre-existing immunity, the rate
of symptomatic infections, and school holidays. Policy analysis used the setting of a typical
school (6 grades with 70 students each)38, but also considered alternative scenarios with larger
schools (140 students per grade)

The model was validated on outbreaks of influenza and COVID-19 in schools and shown to
match the peak and duration of the outbreak curves, and the overall attack rates of the student
population. The validation data was from two outbreaks of pandemic influenza39 , one outbreak
,40

of seasonal influenza41, and one outbreak of COVID-1942. Model parameter ranges were derived
from published sources and by calibration to data using a stochastic optimization algorithm. To
ensure that the results were robust to uncertainty in parameter values, we then simulated the
epidemic 500 times per scenario to account for possible difference between schools and seasons,
with normally distributed values for parameters such as the start day in the year, contact rate
between cohorts and others, and reported the median and the interquartile ranges. All modeling
and statistical analysis used the RStudio Integrated Development for R. RStudio, Inc., Boston,
MA. Further details on the model, including the equations and the parameter values, are provided
in Supplementary Article S1.

Using the model we considered the effect of two key control policies, fever-based isolation and a
shortened school week. For fever-based isolation we evaluated the effect of stricter compliance,

which could be attained by remote monitoring, help in maintaining home isolation or penalties
for non-compliance. We also considered the effect of increasing the monitoring of symptoms,
which could be attained through training of the parents and distribution of free thermometers.
We also considered supplemental policies such as subdividing students into small cohorts and
enforcing strict quarantines on weekends.

Results
Our analysis considered the effect of symptom-based isolation and alternative school schedule
policies on influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections. The symptom-based policy is defined as a
student remaining in isolation a number of days following a fever whereas the school schedule
policy is defined as the number of in-person instruction days students attend weekly. The effect
of these policies is summarized in Table 1 and described in detail below.

Influenza
We calibrated our model’s parameters to outbreaks of pandemic and seasonal influenza and then
calculated each isolation policy 500 times. The different runs varied parameters that normally
vary from year to year (e.g. outbreak start day and compliance with policy). In the baseline
scenario of pandemic influenza and no isolation policy, our model has a median attack rate of
24.5 (Interquartile Range, IQR: 16.6 - 28.1)%. Implementing a one- and two-day isolation
policy, our model predicts a decrease in the attack rate to 17.2 (9.9 - 21.4)% and 7.4 (3.7 11.1)%, respectively (Figure 2).
Furthermore, the model predicts that a two-day policy reduces the peak prevalence (i.e.
simultaneously infected students) from 20 (13 - 25) to 5 (2 - 8) and the outbreak duration from
82 (78 - 84) to 67 (28 - 77) days. Our model suggests that the two-day policy is still effective
even when the student population has pre-existing immunity or has been vaccinated (mean
vaccination rate of 80% and efficacy of 50%), reducing the attack rate to 13 (4.2 - 23.8)%.
A policy of a four-day school week gives a 73% reduction in the attack rate from the baseline, to
6.8 (3.3 - 8.8)%, and a three-day school week gives a 93% reduction to 1.8 (0.9 - 2.3) (Figure
2B). The two-day of post-fever isolation and three-day week policies could be combined
additively with two days of post-fever isolation to give attack rates of 2.1 (1.0-3.3)% and 0.9 (0.5
- 1.2)%, respectively.

COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)
In our COVID-19 outbreak scenarios, we calibrated the model to a baseline attack rate of 10.0
(8.7 - 11.3)% in 500 simulations. As expected based on the lower rate of symptomatic infections
in COVID-19 as compared to influenza, post-fever isolation policy is less effective for COVID19: 1, 2, and 14 days of isolation yielded attacks rates of 9.4 (8.3 - 10.6)%, 9.2 (8.0 - 10.6)%, and
8.5 (7.4 - 9.7)%, respectively (Figure 3, A). Additionally, our model had a baseline outbreak
duration of 138 (135 - 140) days and yielded outbreak durations of 137 (133 - 139), 136 (132 139), and 132 (128 - 134) days for 1, 2, and 14 days of post-fever isolation. Thus when compared
to the influenza outbreaks, this type of policy was less effective at attack rate or outbreak
duration inhibition.
Evaluating the policy of shortening the school week, our model found that using four and three
days of in-person schooling yields attack rates of 4.4 (3.7 - 4.9)% and 2.0 (1.7 - 2.2)%,
respectively (Figure 3, B). When the student population is presumed to be immune43 or
vaccinated at a rate of 80% and with an efficacy of 70% (Standard Deviation, SD: 20%), the
model predicts that the policy is still effective: for the 4- and 3-day school week, the model
predicts a median attack rate of 5.1 (1.8-15.2)% and 2.7 (1-6.6) %, respectively.

For both influenza and COVID-19, we examined additional policy options to complement the
two main policies of post-fever isolation and shortening the school week. In the case of
symptom-based isolation for influenza, measures that increase compliance and symptom
monitoring were found to be effective: a 25% increase in attention and compliance reduces the
attack rate to 3.4 (1.5 - 5.2)% and 7.3 (3.5 - 11.2)%, respectively. For both infections, reducing
contacts between student grades within a school was found to be very effective and could be
complementary to the main policies. Implementing strict quarantines on weekends were also
found to be effective.

Discussion
Outbreaks of acute respiratory infections such as influenza and the novel COVID-19 require an
expansion of the available infection control policies. Here we report evidence in support of
several such policies across outbreak scenarios and settings. For influenza, requiring isolation for
fever is expected to reduce the typical attack rate by 29 (13 - 59)% and 70 (55 - 85)% with one
and two days of post-fever isolation, respectively. This indicates that the CDC-recommended
policy for schools, based on a single day of post-fever isolation, could be enhanced by requiring
a second day of isolation. The result also holds in seasonal influenza in which vaccination is
implemented. The isolation policy could be further strengthened by reducing contact between
students during weekends. Using a shorter in-person school week (i.e., through longer weekends
or remote learning) would also reduce the attack rate by 73 (64 - 88)% and 93 (91 - 97)% with
four and three-day school weeks, respectively. The high percentage of reduction arises because
these measures are expected to bring the epidemic under the outbreak threshold, and assumes no
re-introduction of the infection from outside the school.

While we expected symptom-based isolation to be ineffective for COVID-19 since children are
commonly asymptomatic44, it can still help in reducing outbreaks. Many authorities, including
the CDC and WHO, recommend that those with symptoms isolate for a minimum of 10 days
after symptom onset11 . Indeed, we found that a one-day post-fever isolation policy would
,12

reduce the attack rate in schools by 7 (5 - 14)%, and with 14 days of fever isolation we estimated
that the attack rate would change by 14 (5 - 26)%. The result shows that symptom-based
isolation cannot be relied upon as a central policy in outbreak control for COVID-19, but it is not
futile. Current CDC and WHO isolation policies for COVID-19 are expected to have
effectiveness between the one-day and 14-day fever-based isolation policies above, but require
only one day of isolation following any fever (CDC) and three days of isolation following
cessation of symptoms (WHO). We found that shortening the school week does reduce the total
number infected in an outbreak by 57 (52 - 64)% and 81 (79 - 83)%, with four and three days of
in-person schooling, respectively.

Generally speaking, policies that isolate the infected, of which symptom-based isolation is a subtype, are more preferable to closures. Unlike closures, symptom-based isolation allows healthy
people in the community to continue living their lives uninhibited and reduces the considerable
societal cost of school closures45. Consequently, a standing policy of isolation of infected
individuals could potentially be sustained indefinitely. Shorter school weeks do affect all
students, but they are less disruptive than full closures. They can also be maintained for extended
times during the peak of the outbreak season, particularly if school days are replaced with remote
learning (self study or e-learning). In severe outbreaks, a combination of policies would provide

the best outcomes. High compliance by families would be critical to ensuring that the students
are strongly isolated when the school is closed, and therefore families need to be supported.

While our model is driven by virological data and calibrated to several outbreaks, a few
limitations are inherent in our approach. First, the effect of any policy depends on the context
where it would be applied. The details of the school or institution would matter, and therefore,
we provide an online version of the model, which can be calibrated for multiple situations. It
may be possible to apply our findings to school-like contexts such as workplaces, prisons, or
even the broader community, but such settings have significant features that may confound our
findings. Lastly, symptom parameter information is based on average values for the population
and it is expected that inter-individual and demographic variability might have some effect on
outcomes. Future studies should attempt to evaluate isolation policies with agent-based models
(e.g. 15,46) that can capture inter-individual variability in health trajectories and the network
structure of the population47,48. Despite these limitations, our model captures essential aspects of
acute respiratory outbreaks including progression through stages, the population structure and
symptom trajectories.

In conclusion, in this study we have created a model of transmission of respiratory infection and
considered the effects of two isolation policies. We confirmed that symptom-based policies
would be effective in controlling influenza in a variety of scenarios. Furthermore for influenza
outbreaks, we recommend that isolation is maintained for at least two days following the last day
of fever. For both influenza and COVID-19 we found that using a shortened school-week of
four days instead of five days could be effective in reducing the attack rate, and additional days

would increase the effect. Policymakers tackling the influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks should
consider implementing these policies for controlling outbreaks in schools and other settings.
