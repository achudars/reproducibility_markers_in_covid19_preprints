Abstract
COVID-19 severity and progression are determined by several host and
virological factors that may influence the final outcome of SARS-CoV-2-infected
patients. The objective of this work is to determine a possible association between the
viral load, obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs, and the severity of the infection in a
cohort of 448 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients from a hospital in Madrid during the first
outbreak of the pandemic in Spain. To perform this, we have clinically classified
patients as mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 according to a number of clinical
parameters such as hospitalization requirement, need of oxygen therapy, admission to
intensive care units and/or exitus. Here we report a statistically significant correlation
between viral load and disease severity, being high viral load associated with worse
clinical prognosis, independently of several previously identified risk factors such as
age, sex, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and lung disease
(asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The data presented here reinforce
the viral load as a potential biomarker for predicting disease severity in SARS-CoV-2infected patients. It is also an important parameter in viral evolution since it relates to
the numbers and types of variant genomes present in a viral population, a potential
determinant of disease progression.

Introduction
Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in the human population in 2019 is the
causal agent of the new pandemic disease COVID-19 (1). The virus has spread rapidly
worldwide, and at the time of this writing there are 46,403,652 confirmed cases, and
1,198,569

deaths

in

219

countries

worldwide,

according

to

the

WHO

(https://covid19.who.int/); these numbers are increasing daily. Evolution of a virus in a
specific host is defined by a number of closely related parameters such as viral load,
replication rate, genetic heterogeneity and viral fitness that may influence virus
adaptability, viral pathogenesis and disease progression (2, 3). The replicative capacity
of a virus is clinically relevant because it largely determines the viral load in infected
individuals, and viral load influences disease manifestations (4). In the case of SARSCoV-2, some studies have correlated viral load with disease severity whereas in others
this correlation was not clear. A positive correlation was reported in a cohort of SARSCoV-2-infected patients from China, showing that the viral load detected in the
respiratory tract was positively linked to lung disease severity (5). In a related study, the

analysis of the viral RNA level in upper respiratory tract samples from 76 patients with
COVID-19 revealed significantly lower Ct values (cycle threshold which is inversely
correlated with viral RNA level), and longer virus-shedding periods in those patients
classified as severe, as compared with those that exhibited mild disease (6).
Additionally, a prospective study in a large hospitalized cohort of 1,145 infected
patients documented a significant lower probability of survival in patients with high
viral load than in those with low viral load (7). In contrast, in other studies, it was
observed that the diagnostic viral load level was lower in hospitalized than in nonhospitalized patients, resulting in a lack of correlation of viral load with admission to
intensive care unit (ICU), length of oxygen support, and overall patient survival (8).
Thus, the dynamics of viral load and its connection with different clinical parameters
remain poorly characterized, and large studies with additional cohorts worldwide are
needed to define the possible association and the predictive value of the viral load
regarding disease progression and mortality. Viral RNA load calculated from
nasopharyngeal swabs might be added to other predictive parameters to complete an
early risk stratification of COVID-19 patients (9).

Results and Discussion
Given the disparate results trying to correlate viral load with COVID-19 disease
progression, we have addressed this question with a large cohort of 448 patients
admitted to the Fundación Jiménez Díaz Hospital (FJD, Madrid, Spain) from April 3 to
29, 2020 coinciding with the first COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. At the time of
admission, all patients had clinical symptoms, and were confirmed to be positive for
SARS-CoV-2 by a specific real-time RT-PCR (VIASURE Real Time PCR). The Ct
values analyzed correspond to the first available COVID-19 PCR-positive sample for
each patient. Details regarding the clinical classification are described in Materials and
Methods. Mean Ct values for mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients were 35.75
± 0.45, 32.69 ± 0.37, and 29.58 ± 0.70, respectively. A univariate analysis showed
statistically significant differences among viral load values according to the infection
severity (p<0.0001; ANOVA test) (Figure 1). Specifically, average Ct values were
significantly lower in the severe group as compared with the moderate and the mild
disease groups, and also for the comparison between moderate and mild clinical
categories (p<0.001 in all cases) (t-test with Bonferroni correction). Thus, Ct values (as

a measurement of viral load) in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients correlates positively
with the disease progression and poor prognosis.
Regarding host factors, it has been established that age greater than 65 is a risk
factor to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a major complication of
COVID-19 pneumonia, and that the risk of death increases with advanced age (10). As a
second factor, disease severity and mortality for males is significantly higher than for
females, being older men the population most at risk (11, 12). Additionally, several comorbidities have been potentially associated with poor outcome including hypertension
(high blood pressure), cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and lung disease
(asthma, EPOC) (13). We have included these risk factor data in our patient cohort to
assess their alignment with our disease severity-viral RNA load correlation.
Interestingly, a significant association between viral load and infection severity was still
observed after adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
obesity, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (see ANCOVA
tests in Table 1). The significant difference in viral load between the three groups was
not attributable to the percentage of hospitalization, the percentage of ICU admission or
the percentage of the different types of oxigenotherapy (see ANCOVA tests in Table 1).
Thus, our results with a SARS-CoV-2 population from a cohort which is
different from those in previous studies on viral load influence on disease, suggest a
positive correlation between viral load and COVID-19 disease severity. This conclusion
is also in agreement with two studies showing a longer persistence of high viral load
viruses in respiratory samples of patients with severe disease than those with mild
disease, suggesting that the viral load may be a prognostic parameter (14, 15).
To monitor the average number of days between the symptom onset and the
sample extraction in our cohort, we collected these data for 102 patients. On average NP
swabs were obtained at 7.84 ± 6.40 days after symptoms onset, which is within the time
interval of active infection. It has been described that the highest SARS-CoV-2 viral
load in throat swabs ─and consequently the highest transmissibility peaks─ is around 56 days after the symptom onset (16), but this is an average that depends on each patient;
the transmissibility window extends from a few days before symptom onset up to 30
days in patients with severe disease (14, 17).
A correlation between high viral load and disease severity has been also found in
other viral infections. Among children naturally infected with respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV), increased viral load was associated with clinical severity of disease defined as

an increased risk for intensive care, prolonged hospitalization, or the development of
respiratory failure (18). Examination of hepatitis A virus (HAV) RNA from sera by
real-time PCR resulted in higher initial viral load in patients with severe outcomes such
as fulminant hepatitis and severe acute hepatitis than in patients with less severe
infection (19). Viral load in patients infected with the pandemic type A influenza virus
H1N1 (2009) who suffered pneumonia was higher than in patients with milder disease
(those with bronchitis or upper respiratory tract infection), suggesting that the viral load
is also an important predictive value in influenza infection (20). Other instances of a
connection of viral load with disease progression have been reviewed (2).
In terms of viral quasispecies dynamics, a key question regarding clinical
implications is that a population with a large viral load will contain a broader mutant
repertoire than a population with low viral load. Even if each individual mutant might
be present at the same frequency in both populations (as it corresponds to mutant
frequency being an “intrinsic” property), the mutant repertoire is an “extrinsic” property
of the population, a key distinction that has been numerically studied (21). Thus, viral
load is a potential source of variants that enhance the probability of infection to
alternative cell types in the course of infection which is increasingly viewed as a stepwise adaptation process (2-4, 21).

Methods
Patient cohort and stratification
Data collected included patient demographics, risk factors for SARS-CoV-2
disease and clinical information related to the time of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (Table 1).
Patients were classified according to the following COVID-19-associated parameters:
(1) need of hospital admission, (2) need for mechanical ventilation, (3) admission to the
ICU, and (4) exitus attributed to COVID-19. Patients were classified as mild, moderate
and severe cases according to the requirement and the type of hospitalization: (1) mild
symptoms (neither hospital admission nor ICU) (n=110), (2) moderate symptoms
(hospitalization without ICU) (n=236), and (3) severe symptoms (hospitalization with
admission to the ICU, and/or exitus) (n=102). Exceptions to these criteria are detailed in
Table 1. The clinical relevance was defined before the data analysis was performed.

Molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 by Ct value measurements
Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at FJD hospital by trained medical
personnel from all patients included in the study due to suspected COVID-19 infection.
After collection, the NP samples were transferred to viral transport media and
transported to the Microbiology Department for molecular testing. RT-PCR to obtain
diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 viral load was performed using the kit VIASURE Real Time
PCR Detection Kits by CerTest BIOTEC following the manufacturer instructions. The
Ct values were calculated using SARS-CoV-2-specific oligonucleotides directed to the
ORF1ab.
Statistics
The statistically significance of differences among viral load values according to the
infection severity was calculated with the ANOVA test and t-test with Bonferroni
correction using GraphPad Prism 7.00. The association between viral load and disease
severity adjusted by risk factors was calculated with ANCOVA test using software R
version 4.0.2.
Study approval
All samples were collected according to WHO guidelines. This study was approved by
the Ethics Committee and the Institutional Review Board of the FJD hospital (no. PIC087-20-FJD).
