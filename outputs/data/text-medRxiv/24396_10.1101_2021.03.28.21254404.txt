ABSTRACT

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a critical public health tool in
tracking the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in wastewater
has to-date relied on genomic sequencing, which lacks sensitivity necessary to detect low variant
abundances in diluted and mixed wastewater samples. Here, we develop and present an opensource method based on allele specific RT-qPCR (AS RT-qPCR) that detects and quantifies the
B.1.1.7 variant, targeting spike protein mutations at three independent genomic loci highly
predictive of B.1.1.7 (HV69/70del, Y144del, and A570D). Our assays can reliably detect and
quantify low levels of B.1.1.7 with low cross-reactivity, and at variant proportions between 0.1%
and 1% in a background of mixed SARS-CoV-2. Applying our method to wastewater samples
from the United States, we track B.1.1.7 occurrence over time in 19 communities. AS RT-qPCR
results align with clinical trends, and summation of B.1.1.7 and wild-type sequences quantified by
our assays strongly correlate with SARS-CoV-2 levels indicated by the US CDC N1/N2 assay.
This work paves the path for rapid inexpensive surveillance of B.1.1.7 and other SARS-CoV-2
variants in wastewater.

INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented disruption in all aspects of life
globally. Recent rollout of vaccines across a number of countries has been an important milestone
in fighting the pandemic. However, the emergence of new variants of concern (VOCs) such as
B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 suggests that continued vigilance is required to control the COVID-19
pandemic (Mascola, Graham, & Fauci, 2021). For example, the B.1.1.7 variant contains spike
protein mutations D614G and N501Y that have been reported to increase transmission and to

subsequently cause a more severe COVID-19 manifestation with increased hospitalization and
mortality rates (Davies et al., 2021; Hou et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020; Rambaut et al., 2020).
Moreover, both the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants contain extensive mutations in the spike protein
that cause increased resistance to neutralization by antibodies derived from convalescent
patients’ plasma and vacinee sera (Wang et al., 2021). The potential public health challenges
posed by these emerging VOCs warrant extensive real-time surveillance at the community level
to inform efforts in controlling the pandemic (CDC, 2020).

While the gold standard for disease surveillance is through clinically derived data (i.e.
swabbing of the upper respiratory tract followed by qPCR), wastewater-based epidemiology
(WBE) has emerged as a cost-effective and non-invasive complement to clinical testing during
this COVID-19 pandemic (Hart & Halden, 2020). WBE can provide real-time, unbiased disease
surveillance at the community level due to the fact that wastewater contains aggregated
population health data (Polo et al., 2020; Thompson, 2020). Numerous countries such as the USA
(Wu et al., 2020), the Netherlands (Medema et al., 2020), Australia (Ahmed et al., 2020), and
Spain (Randazzo et al., 2020) have reported the presence of SARS-CoV 2 in their wastewater.
WBE is actively utilized and supported by government and public health entities: national
programs have been established in the US (NWSS, 2021), and the European Commission
recently recommended WBE as an approach for the systematic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and
its variants in the EU (EU Commission, 2021).

In light of new emerging VOCs, efforts have been made to utilize WBE in tracking SARSCoV 2 variants that are circulating in the community. However, the most common method applied
to wastewater is currently next generation sequencing (NGS), either by sequencing the viral
metagenome of wastewater (Crits-Christoph et al., 2020) or by amplifying and then sequencing
SARS-CoV-2 genome extracted from wastewater samples (Prado et al., 2021). While these early

results are promising, many report inconsistent and/or low sequencing coverage, likely due to the
low input concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater (Fontenele et al., 2021; Jahn et al., 2021;
Prado et al., 2021). Therefore, NGS-based approaches for WBE will require considerable
additional optimization before they can be robustly applied to a broad variety of wastewater
samples and to generate reliable high-quality data that can be used to inform public health
responses. Furthermore, universally implementing NGS-based wastewater surveillance will
require additional specialised infrastructure and standardized protocols (Gwinn, MacCannell, &
Armstrong, 2019). As such, there is a critical need for a simple, accurate and convenient
diagnostic assay for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants which is suited for wastewater
surveillance and which can leverage existing experimental pipelines and infrastructure. To
address this gap, we developed and validated a method that is based upon RT-qPCR, a widely
applied and commonly available laboratory assay used in diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 (Lu
et al., 2020) and broadscale WBE efforts (Wu et al., 2021). This method consists of a panel of
allele specific (AS) RT-qPCR-based assays which we apply to identify and quantify the B.1.1.7
variant of SARS-CoV-2 and which can be easily expanded to target additional variants of concern.

AS-PCR was developed over 30 years ago (Petruska et al., 1988; Wu et al., 1989) and is
commonly used for molecular genotyping in laboratory diagnostics (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2007).
Here, we leverage AS-PCR to detect mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome in wastewater, with
application to VOC tracking. AS-PCR permits the direct detection of one or more mutations in the
genome of an organism or interest. It involves two parallel reactions, each including a wild-type
(WT) or mutation specific forward primer and a common reverse primer (or vice versa), in which
the WT or mutation specific primer is designed with its 3′ end complementary to each mutation.
Introduction of a synthetic mismatch near the 3’ terminal end of both WT and mutant primers
improves specificity by significantly destabilizing hybridization of non-target sequences (Newton
et al, 1991). The 3′ mismatch between the oligonucleotide primer and the genome template is

refractory to primer extension by Thermus aquaticus (Taq) polymerase, conferring up to single
nucleotide discrimination. Further AS-PCR can be performed with fluorescent dyes quantitatively
(as AS-qPCR) to visualize product accumulation with hydrolysis probes, of which quantification
cycle values (Ct) enable accurate quantitative measurements. When coupled with reverse
transcription (RT) as is required for RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the method is referred to
as AS RT-qPCR.

Our AS RT-qPCR panel for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater-based variant tracking consists of
three pairs of primer-probe sets that target B.1.1.7-specific spike protein mutations HV69/70del,
Y144del, and A570D. These three pairs of primer-probe sets enable the detection and
discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 sequence from the WT sequence. The assay
presented here uses identical reagents, instruments and workflow as existing SARS-CoV-2 RTqPCR diagnostic assays, thus potentially allowing for its immediate implementation on a global
scale. We performed analytical assessments of the primer sets to confirm that they have
amplification efficiencies above 90%, possess similar sensitivities to the most commonly used
and CDC recommended N1 and N2 assays, and reliably enable specific detection and accurate
quantitation in a background of RNA of the opposite genotype (B.1.1.7 in WT and vice versa). We
also applied this panel of assays for quantitative detection of B.1.1.7 in SARS-CoV-2 positive
wastewater samples. This work demonstrates the utility of AS RT-qPCR for variant detection in
wastewater, and could be readily applied to track the spread of B.1.1.7 and adapted to track other
VOCs through wastewater surveillance.

RESULTS

AS RT-qPCR primer design strategy

Our AS RT-qPCR assay is designed to enable quantitation of the B.1.1.7 variant and WT
SARS-CoV-2. We focused on the loci that can distinguish B.1.1.7 from other variants. For each
locus, we designed two allele-specific (AS) forward primers, one for the WT allele and one for the
mutant allele, with the 3’ end of these primers terminating at the mutation to be assayed. Parallel
quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (RT-qPCR) reactions targeting both the WT and variant
sequence are required to determine the variant frequency at the corresponding locus. Each of
these contain one of the allele-specific (AS) forward primers, a common reverse primer and a
common probe. Nucleotide discrimination of the AS primers employs the principle of
thermodynamic instability of the 3’ end being refractory to polymerase extension. To further
increase thermodynamic instability for enhanced template discrimination, a synthetic mismatch
near the final 3’ nucleotide has been incorporated. Using this strategy, we designed AS RT-qPCR
primers targeting spike protein mutations characteristic of B.1.1.7 that would enable discrimination
between B.1.1.7 and WT sequences.

We screened these primers against B.1.1.7 and WT synthetic RNA to identify
combinations that could be utilized to discriminate between B.1.1.7 and WT. This initial screen
identified primers targeting HV69-70del, Y144del and A570D as having the greatest sensitivity
(lowest cycle threshold) and specificity (highest difference in cycle thresholds between specific
and off target amplification). In this work we report detailed analytical validation of the sensitivity
and specificity of these three pairs of primer-probe sets. The schematic of our allele-specific RTqPCR for determination of variant frequencies is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Schematic of our panel of three AS RT-qPCR assays. (Left panel) Each assay requires
a common reverse primer (black) and probe (pink), paired with a WT or mutation-specific forward
primer (light and dark blue). This allele-specific primer is designed to target the mutation of interest
(red) at the 3′ end of the mutation-specific primer and contains a synthetic mismatch (orange)
near the 3’ end to enhance assay specificity. Sequences shown represent WT and B.1.1.7 primer
and target sequences for loci A570D. (Middle panel) Two individual RT-qPCR reactions are
needed to assay for variant frequencies at each locus. (Right panel) Variant frequencies can be
calculated after converting threshold cycles to genome copies using their respective standard
curves.

Predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants targeted for B.1.1.7 detection

We looked at how predictive our selected mutations HV69-70del, Y144del and A570D
were for detection of the B.1.1.7 lineage (Table 1). We downloaded all available genomes in
GISAID as of 11 Mar 2021 and aligned them to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome
(NC_045512.2) to calculate the percent of B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 genomes containing each
target mutation. HV69-70del is present in 98.7% of sequences in the B.1.1.7 lineage but also

present in 2.5% of other lineages. Deletion Y144del is present in 97.9% of publicly available
B.1.1.7 sequences and only in 0.5% WT and non-B.1.1.7 genomes. A570D is conferred by a C
to A mutation at nucleotide 23,271. 99.9% of sequences in the B.1.1.7 lineage show this mutation,
while it has been reported in only 0.02% of WT and non-B.1.1.7 sequences. Given the high
specificity of these mutations to B.1.1.7, the co-occurrence of these three mutations in wastewater
is likely highly indicative of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with B.1.1.7 lineage.

Specificity of AS RT-qPCR primers for their respective RNA

We examined the specificity of the three designed AS RT-qPCR assays for their
respective WT and mutant genome targets in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA (HV69-70 del, Y144del and
A570D) by screening them against full length synthetic RNA constructs of the B.1.1.7 and WT
genotypes (Figure 2). The amplification efficiency of each primer and probe set were between

90.6 to 105% for the correct RNA (i.e. B.1.1.7 assay for B.1.1.7 RNA, and WT assay for WT RNA).
Next, we next determined the levels of cross reactivity for RNA of the opposite genotype by testing
each combination of WT and mutant primers. Cross reactivity did not occur for WT HV69-70 and
WT Y144 primers, against up to 105 and 104 copies of B.1.1.7 RNA respectively (Figure 2, top
left panel). WT A570 primers were less specific but still strongly discriminant against the B.1.1.7
variant sequence (Figure 2; left column, bottom panel). Cross-reactivity for all three B.1.1.7specific primers was minimal, observed only for 104 and above copies of WT RNA per µL (Figure
2, right column) which suggests that the assay can detect low B.1.1.7 variant frequencies in the
presence of a strong background of WT sequences.

Figure 2. Specificity and cross-reactivity of AS RT-qPCR primers against WT and B.1.1.7 RNA
in nuclease-free water. PCR efficiency and y-intercept cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated
for each of six primer–probe sets against tenfold dilutions of synthetic full-length SARS-CoV-2
RNA. Data shown reflect two sets of independent measurements taken on different days. Green,
purple and blue diamonds represent tests against the matching genotype (WT-specific primers to
WT RNA and B.1.1.7-specific primers to B.1.1.7 RNA) and grey diamonds denote tests against
RNA of the opposite genotype.

Comparison of Ct values of AS RT-qPCR primers to US CDC N1 and N2 SARS-CoV-2
primers

Given the importance of high sensitivity for effective SARS-CoV-2 detection in an
environmental matrix as complex as sewage, we examined the cycle thresholds (Ct) of all three
pairs of primer-probe sets in comparison to the N1 and N2 primer-probe sets recommended by
the US CDC (Figure 3). Having similar or lower Ct values for the same input RNA can be
considered a proxy for the overall sensitivity of the assay. We found these three AS RT-qPCR
primer-probe sets to have comparable Ct values to N1 and N2 assays for the same amount of
input RNA across a 100-fold difference in target RNA concentration. Comparing these results to
the y-intercept Ct values in Figure 2 also supports the conclusion that sensitivities presented here
were similar among most of the primer–probe sets, though Y144del may be slightly lower than
the other primer-probe sets (higher Ct values in Figure 3, purple circles on right panel).

Detection in a background of 104 copies of RNA of the opposite genotype

Due to their aggregated and heterogeneous nature, wastewater samples likely contain a
mixture of numerous SARS-CoV-2 variant genotypes which can occur at highly skewed ratios.
We looked at how suitable our primer-probe sets were to detect and quantify VOCs in the
presence of an abundance of the various genotypes. We examined the cycle thresholds (Ct) of
primer-probe sets against their respective full length RNA in the presence or absence of up to 104
copies of RNA of the opposite genotype (Figure 4), which constitutes a variant frequency of 0.1%,
1% and 10%, respectively.

Overall, the B.1.1.7 primer-probe sets were unaffected by large quantities of WT
(background) RNA and the WT primer-probe sets were also largely unaffected by B.1.1.7
background. All of the primer-probe sets presented here were able to detect B.1.1.7 down to a
ratio of 1% to WT RNA and vice versa, with cycle thresholds largely unaffected by the presence
of 104 copies of RNA of the opposite genotype (Figure 4). These results were similarly sensitive
down to ratios of 0.1% WT/B.1.1.7 RNA, though sporadic non-detections occurred for WT HV6970, WT Y144 and B.1.1.7 HV69-70del primers in the presence of RNA of the opposite genotype.
WT 144 and WT A570 primers occasionally did not detect 10 copies of their target in the absence
of the opposite genotype which is determined to be consistent with their lower overall sensitivities
described earlier (Figure 3). The majority of primer-probes presented here were unaffected by
the presence of 104 copies of RNA of the opposite genotype, except for WT A570 which yielded
higher concentrations (lower Ct values) in the presence of high B.1.1.7 background with 10 copies
of WT input. Specificity and cross reactivity tests on WT A570 presented earlier in this paper
suggest cross-reactivity with the B.1.1.7 VOC resulting in its slight overestimation. Therefore, we
have determined that the presented AS RT-qPCR assays are capable of robustly and
reproducibly detecting variants of concern in complex matrices in abundances as low as 1%.

Application on SARS-CoV-2 positive wastewater samples

We next validated the performance of our assay on wastewater samples. We tested
samples collected from 16 urban and rural wastewater treatment plants and 3 buildings across
11 US states. For each of these sampling locations, we analyzed samples collected during three
distinct time periods: from Fall 2020 (October 20 - November 5, 2020), when no B.1.1.7 was

reported in clinical samples in the US; from January 2021 (January 20 - 29, 2021) when B.1.1.7
was first emerging in the US; and between February 24 and March 8, 2021, when B.1.1.7 was
circulating in most of the US. Overall, we tested 58 samples, all but two locations had one sample
per each time period; MA-2 had two samples tested in each of January 2021 and Fall 2020 periods
and FL-6 had no samples in Fall 2020. All of the samples included in this experiment tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 with RT-qPCR using the US CDC N1/N2 assays (Figure 5). We also
estimated the fraction of B.1.1.7 as a ratio of B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 concentration to the sum of
B.1.1.7 and WT concentrations (Figure 5).

The WT sequence was detected in 55 out of 58 samples (for at least 2 target loci),
indicating that our WT assays have comparable sensitivity as the routinely used N1/N2 RT-qPCR
SARS-CoV-2 protocol. At least two loci associated with B.1.1.7 were detected in 15 out of 56
samples, with 11 additional samples showing positive signals for one mutant locus. B.1.1.7 targets
were not detected in the October 2020 samples, reflecting the absence of clinically-confirmed
B.1.1.7 in the US at that time. In January 2021, 4 samples were positive in at least 2 target B.1.1.7
loci. Three of these B.1.1.7-positive samples were from Florida, which agrees with the clinical
trend that Florida was the US state with the highest fraction of B.1.1.7 cases in January 2021. For
comparison, 19.1% of GISAID sequences in Florida in January 2021 were of the B.1.1.7 lineage,
compared to 2.8% nation-wide.

In February/March 2021, 12 samples were positive for B.1.1.7 targets. The fraction of the
B.1.1.7 variant increased more than 3-fold in all locations between January and February/March
2021. The average fraction of B.1.1.7 for all non-building locations increased from 2.6% to 19.2%.
These results are consistent with the average fraction of B.1.1.7 cases in the US according to
GISAID for these time periods (4.2% and 13.3% respectively). Interestingly, one building-level
sample was found to contain exclusively B.1.1.7 in February-March 2021. This is consistent with

our expectation, as for an individual building we could expect only one strain to be circulating in
a small number of people.

Finally, we compared results of the AS RT-qPCR assay with the SARS-CoV-2
concentrations measured using US CDC N1 and N2 assays. We found that the concentrations of
WT and B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 sequences at the AS RT-qPCR loci were each positively correlated
(p<0.001) with SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations obtained by the N1/N2 assay. Gene copies per
mL of the WT sequences at each locus agreed well with measurements obtained from the N1/N2
assay (Figure 5, Bottom panel). The strongest correlations and best match to the N1/N2 data
were obtained by summing the concentrations of WT and B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 sequences at the
AS RT-qPCR loci, indicating quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at these loci and
consistent with the fact that CDC N1/N2 assay does not discriminate between B.1.1.7 and other
genotypes.

DISCUSSION

The present study describes the development and validation of a qPCR-based assay that
allows for the detection and quantification of B.1.1.7 in wastewater samples and which is readily
adaptable to additional variants of concern. The assay leverages allele specific qPCR (AS-qPCR)
and consists of three primer-probe sets that target the HV69-70del, Y144del and A570D spike
protein mutations that are specific to B.1.1.7. The primer-probe sets have comparable efficiencies
and sensitivities to the widely used US CDC N1 and N2 qPCR assays and can robustly,
reproducibly and specifically detect B.1.1.7 in complex matrices and at concentrations between
0.1% and 1% in a background of 104 copies of WT RNA, thus making them suitable for use in
wastewater samples with mixed genotypes. Importantly, the primer-probe sets presented here
show only minimal cross-reactivity with the wildtype and are capable of quantifying B.1.1.7 RNA
at concentrations typically seen in raw wastewater samples. Finally, we apply our method to real
wastewater samples and show that it produces interpretable and sensible results. This AS RTqPCR panel can be performed as six individual one step RT-qPCR reactions, with a similar
workflow to existing RT–qPCR assays used by clinical, research and public health laboratories
for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and wastewater surveillance. This allows for the cost effective and
convenient identification and quantitation of B.1.1.7., which can be rapidly integrated into existing
wastewater surveillance procedures.

Wastewater surveillance has been increasingly utilized to non-invasively monitor for
population-level infections and allows for the tracking of clusters, hotspots and infection trends
within a community (Wu et al., 2020; Larsen & Wigginton, 2020). Wastewater surveillance
effectively complements clinical testing and is unaffected by biases in clinical data which may be
due to limits in testing capacity, the presence of disease symptoms, or treatment seeking
behavior. Despite the potential utility of wastewater surveillance for understanding SARS-CoV-2
variant frequencies and dynamics within a community, there exists methodological challenges to
variant detection in wastewater. Due to high dilution, wastewater samples contain significantly
lower SARS-CoV-2 titers than clinical samples, thus requiring highly sensitive assays.
Wastewater is also a complex and composite matrix made up of numerous potential inhibitors,
enteric pathogens and - most importantly - multiple viral variants, thus necessitating methods that
are highly specific and quantitative. The AS RT-qPCR panel we describe here enables detection
and quantitation of B.1.1.7 in wastewater, while using a similar workflow as conventional SARSCoV-2 RT-qPCR testing. These open source assays thus enable wastewater monitoring
programs to identify the occurrence of B.1.1.7, and quantify variant-specific SARS-CoV-2 trends
and dynamics at a community level. Most importantly, this AS RT-qPCR-based method is highly
modifiable and can be easily extended and adapted to target other variants of concern as soon
as they are identified by clinical genomic sequencing surveillance efforts.

The critical need for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) has prompted
the development of other methods that can track VOCs in wastewater. To date, the most common
methods used in frontline laboratories involve sequencing of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome or
targeted sequencing of specific loci of interest, both of which are time consuming, expensive, and
face unique data interpretation challenges in wastewater. A qPCR-based approach, on the other
hand, is better suited for targeted detection at low viral concentrations, widely available at

relatively low cost in laboratories conducting clinical diagnostics, and provides quantitative data
for determination of variant abundances. As such, several groups have reported RT-qPCR primerprobe sets for detection of VOCs in wastewater. Most of these groups developed assays targeting
only a single site for detection of each VOC lineage. They reported substantially lower sensitivity
for their assays in comparison to the US CDC N1 and N2 assays and had poor amplification
efficiencies (Graber et al., 2021, Wurtzer et al., 2021, Yaniv et al., 2021). A number of biomedical
companies have also released products for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in wastewater,
but have not divulged additional details on their methods. Here we report the development and
validation of a panel of AS RT-qPCR assays, which we believe would greatly benefit researchers
in both WBE and clinical diagnostics.

There are several important challenges and limitations to consider during interpretation of
datasets obtained by the AS-qPCR assays we have described here. First, even though this assay
has the potential of tracking the spread and presence of B.1.1.7 on the community level, it remains
to be determined if these could be extrapolated to incidence of infection with B.1.1.7 and nonB.1.1.7 strains. For example, differences in virus shedding rates between patients carrying B.1.1.7
versus other strains have not yet been robustly determined, though early evidence does suggest
that excretion rates may be higher for the VOC (Kissler et al., 2021). Second, the assays
presented here allow for the detection of B.1.1.7 by targeting three mutations. While these are
currently highly and solely indicative of the B.1.1.7 VOC, there could be the possibility of detecting
emerging strains that may possess the same mutations while constituting a VOC of their own.
Nonetheless, the proposed AS RT-qPCR assays can be quickly modified and updated to follow
the evolution of B.1.1.7 sequences or other VOCs. Finally, the highly specific and targeted nature
of this AS RT-qPCR approach does not allow for its usage to discover new variants. However,
the presented method allows for a synergy between clinical genomic surveillance and WBE,
where new VOCs can be identified locally via clinical surveillance, followed up with rapid

development of AS RT-qPCR assays to target VOC-specific mutations, and finally adopted
broadly into WBE campaigns to quickly start monitoring their spread.

Together, this work demonstrates a robust and highly adaptable AS RT-qPCR approach
for the detection and genotype discrimination of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant of concern in
wastewater. The presented protocol sets provide a framework for future development of AS RTqPCR assays to monitor emerging additional variants of concern.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Design of probes and allele specific primers
Primers and probes were designed using Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT)’s PrimerQuest Tool,
with the mutation being placed at the 3’ end of either the forward or reverse primer. At least one
primer and probe set was designed for each allele-specific (AS) primer direction. All primers were
designed to have a Tm in the range of 59–65°C and the probes—in the range of 64–72°C. The
probes were designed to anneal to the same strand as the AS primer, with the probe as close to
the 3′-end of the AS primers as possible, while avoiding guanines at the 5′-end of the probe. AS
primers targeting mutations were designed to include an artificial mismatch near the 3’ terminal
nucleotide to increase discrimination between WT and mutant sequences. Primer and probe
sequences were analyzed for hairpin, self-dimerization, and heterodimerization. All primers and
probes were purchased from IDT. Sequences are shown in Table 2.

A total of 732,288 SARS-CoV-2 sequences were downloaded on GISAID (11th March 2021). All
the sequences less than 27,000 bp in length or with more than 3,000 N unknown bases are
omitted from the analysis. A total of 449,382 sequences remained after QC pre-filtering. 19.8%
sequences were assigned as B.1.1.7 strains and 80.2% were assigned as non-B.1.1.7 strains. All
the sequences were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.2) using mafft
v7.467 to detect the differences of three target mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Katoh &
Standley, 2013).

RNA standards
Twist Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA Controls, controls 2 or 4 (Wuhan-Hu-1 or USA/TX1/2020) and
control 14 (England/205041766/2020) were used as RNA standards representing WT and B.1.1.7
respectively. RNA standards were prepared as single use aliquots.

Analysis of AS RT-qPCR primer and probe sets
AS RT-qPCR was performed using the Taqman Virus 1-Step master mix (Thermofisher
#4444434) in duplicates, at a final volume of 10 µL, according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. A single reverse or forward primer and probe was used with each set of allelespecific forward or reverse primers (setup is shown in Table 3). The RNA templates were
analysed at tenfold dilutions, from 105 to 101. The final concentration of the AS RT-qPCR primers
were 500 nM, probe at 200 nM, with 1 µL of template. US CDC 2019-nCoV_N1 and 2019nCoV_N2 (IDT) (sequences shown in Table 4) were used following recommendations, at final
concentrations of 500 nM primers and 125 nM probe. No template controls were included for each
assay and none of them amplified. The reactions are setup using electronic pipettes (Eppendorf)
and performed on a Bio-Rad CFX384 real-time PCR instrument under the following conditions, 5
min at 50 °C and 20 s at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles of 3 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C.

24-hour composite samples of raw sewage were obtained from the wastewater treatment plants
and selected residential buildings across the US as part of a regular wastewater surveillance
service provided by Biobot Analytics, Inc. Samples were pasteurized at 60°C for 1 hour, vacuum
filtered through a 0.2 µm membrane (Millipore Sigma) and then sealed and stored at 4°C. 15 ml
of clarified samples were concentrated with 10 kDa Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter units (Sigma,
Cat# UFC9010) to 150 ∼ 200 ul. Samples were then lysed with buffer AVL containing carrier RNA
(Qiagen). After adjusting binding conditions with ethanol, samples were subjected to RNA
extraction (Qiagen RNeasy kit, Cat# 74182). One-step RT-qPCR was performed as described
above, using 1 µL of RNA in a 10 µL reaction. Ct values were converted to RNA copies based on
standard curves established with Twist Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA Controls as described above.
N1/N2 qPCR quantification was performed as described in Wu et al. 2020.

Data analysis
Data was analysed using Microsoft Excel and Graphpad prism. Linear regression was performed
using Graphpad Prism. Graphs were presented using Graphpad Prism. Results from wastewater
samples were analyzed and visualized using Python v3.9.
