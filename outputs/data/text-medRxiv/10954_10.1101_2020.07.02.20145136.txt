Abstract. This study aims to understand the features of the COVID-19
spread in the South Region of Brazil by estimating the Effective Reproduction
Number (ERN) Re for the states of Paraná (PR), Rio Grande do Sul (RS),
and Santa Catarina (SC). We used the SIRD (Susceptibles-Infectious-RecoveredDead) model to describe the past data and to simulate strategies for the gradual
mitigation of the epidemic curve by applying non-pharmacological measures.
Besides the SIRD model does not include some aspects of COVID-19, as the
symptomatic and asymptomatic subgroups of individuals and the incubation
period, for example, in this work we intend to use a classical and easy to handle
model to introduce a thorough method of adjustment that allows us to achieve
reliable fitting for the real data and to obtain insights about the current trends
for the pandemic in each locality. Our results demonstrate that for localities for
which the ERN is about 2, only rigid measures are efficient to avoid overwhelming
the health care system. These findings corroborate the relevance of keeping the
value of Re below 1 and applying containment measures early.

1. Introduction
On March 11th , 2020, the infectious disease caused
by the most recently discovered Coronavirus (SARSCoV2), the Coronavirus Disease COVID-19, was
characterized as a pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO) [1].
The new Coronavirus
astonished the world with its high infectivity, which
allowed the quick spread of the COVID-19 across all
continents. Over the last months, researchers have
concentrated their efforts to obtain answers and to
propose efficient measures to avoid an even greater
catastrophe. Despite no vaccine has been developed
yet, to understand the process of dissemination of the
virus [2] and to propose universal strategies to flatten
the epidemic curve through social distance protocols
[3, 4], for example, were fundamental achievements.
After starting in China and affecting several
countries in Europe, as well as the United States
of America (USA), currently, South America is the
epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Until June
20th , 2020, in Brazil, Peru, and Chile, the three
most affected countries of such continent, more than
1.5 million people were infected. In Brazil, due
to its continental dimension, the COVID-19 spread
across its 27 states (considering the federal district)
heterogeneously, as shown recently [5]. Some states in
the North, Northeast, and Southeast Brazilian regions
were the most affected. Considering only São Paulo
and Rio de Janeiro, located in the Southeast Region,
and Ceará and Pará, belonging to the Northeast and
North regions, respectively, we get almost 46% of the
cumulative number of confirmed cases and 63% of the
deaths caused by COVID-19 in the whole country.
On the other hand, the South and Central-West
regions, for a while, remain with a low incidence
of cases. Together, these two regions concentrate
about 10% of the cumulative number of confirmed
cases and about 5% of the deaths in Brazil. Because
such disparity when comparing different regions, large
countries as Brazil, in which cultural, climatic, and per
capita income differences take place, for example, are
studied so that we can find out which aspects indeed
influence the virus spreading. The main focus of the
studies already carried out is on the most affected
regions by the epidemic [5, 6, 7, 8]. In this work,
however, we propose to analyze the current situation in
the Brazilian South Region, which is composed of the
states of Paraná (PR), Rio Grande do Sul (RS), and

Santa Catarina (SC). The population, the cumulative
number of confirmed cases, and the number of deaths
caused by COVID-19 in these three states considering
the data until June 20th , 2020, are presented in Table
1.
To better understanding the dissemination of an
infectious disease in a specific region, the most common
approach is to use the different epidemiological models
to obtain short-term or long-term forecasts and to
simulate mitigation strategies [3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In
this study, we used the SIRD (Susceptibles-InfectiousRecovered-Dead) model, which is introduced in Section
2 together with the methodology used to adjust the
model to the real data. In Section 3, we present
our results, which are divide into three parts: (i) an
estimate of the Effective Reproduction Number (ERN)
Re for each state; (ii) projections for the cumulative
number of confirmed cases and active infected people
considering different scenarios; and (iii) mitigation
strategies with the gradual reduction of Re to avoid
the health care systems collapse. Our conclusions are
presented in Section 4.
2. The SIRD model
Since the remarkable work published in 1927 by
W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendrick [15], the
epidemiological models are taken to capture the
essential features of the course of an epidemic.
According to Daley and Gani [16], the use of
epidemiological models has three main goals: (i) to
understand better the mechanism by which diseases
spread, (ii) to predict the future course of the epidemic,
and (iii) to simulate strategies which allow us to
control the spread of the disease. However, to achieve
these three goals, first of all, our model must be able
to describe the real data from the past [16].
Based on this premise, in this work, we used
the SIRD model to describe the real data from the
past and to project future scenarios for the COVID-19
pandemic. In the SIRD model, the total population N
of each locality is divided into subgroups of susceptible
(S(t)), infectious (I(t)), recovered (R(t)), and dead
(D(t)) individuals, as shown in Fig. 1. These variables
are functions of time t and the condition N = S(t) +
I(t)+R(t)+D(t) is always satisfied. In our simulations,
we considered the total population N , given in Table 1
for each state, a fixed number. The reason for this
assumption is that we can safely ignore births and

with initial conditions [S(t0 ), I(t0 ), R(t0 ), D(t0 )]. In
our simulations, we considered the initial number of
susceptibles individuals as S(t0 ) = N − I(t0 ) − R(t0 ) −
D(t0 ), with R(t0 ) = 0. We obtained I(t0 ) and
D(t0 ) from the real data. The parameter β is the
contact rate, the average number of adequate contacts
(sufficient for transmission) of a person per unit time.
Then, (βI/N ) is the average number of contacts of one
susceptible individual with infectious individuals per
unit time, and (βI/N )S is the number of new cases per
unit time due to S susceptibles [19, 20, 21]. Since the
incidence of new infections depends on the prevalence
(or “frequency”) I/N of the disease in the population,
the term (βI/N )S is sometimes called frequencydependent incidence (also called standard incidence or
density-independent transmission) [22, 23]. 1/Trec is
the recovery rate, with Trec being the recovery time
(or duration of the infection), and the mortality (or
death) rate is δ (number of people that die per unit
of time comparing with the number of active infected

individuals).
2.1. Adjusting the parameters to the real data
The SIRD model is very simple and does not consider
the subgroups of symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals or the period in which a person is not
infectious during incubation (until a few days before
the onset of symptoms), as other more robust models
[3, 9, 10, 13, 24]. However, the purpose of this work is
to show how simple models, which are very important
as conceptual models, can reproduce the real data
accurately when an in-depth adjustment is performed
to determine the best parametric set.
The parameters β, Trec , and δ can change daily
and must be adjusted so that the model describes
the real data from the past and allows us to make
reliable projections for the future.
To achieve
the best adjustment, we divided the time series in
Epidemiological Weeks (EPI weeks), which are, by
international convention, count from Sunday to the
next Saturday. The aim is to find the combination
of β(k), Trec (k), and δ(k) that better reproduces the
course of the pandemic in each EPI week number
k, in a specific locality. Splitting the time series
into intervals of seven days, with each day being an
experimental data, we satisfied the required number of
2r + 1 experiments that must be considered to obtain
the relevant information of the r parameters [25] (in
this case, r = 3).
The adjustment procedure consisted of minimizing
the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the real
data and the model predictions. We defined ∆C as the
RMSE calculated between the cumulative number of
infected people C(t) = I(t) + R(t) + D(t) obtained by
the model in each day and the real data, and ∆D as
the RMSE calculated between the number of deaths
D(t) obtained by the model in each day and the real
data. Thus, the first step of the numerical procedure
was to perform simulations varying β ∈ [0.0, 0.3] with
a step of 10−2 , Trec ∈ [7, 21] with a step of 10−1 , and
δ ∈ [5 × 10−4 , 10−2 ] with a step of 5 × 10−5 and to find
the parametric
p set (β(k), Trec (k), δ(k)) that minimizes
the quantity ∆2C + ∆2D in each EPI week number k.
Once ∆C  ∆D (due to the magnitude of the data),
the next step was to vary the parameter δ(k) again

keeping fixed the parameters β(k) and Trec (k) found
in the previous step, aiming to find a new parametric
set (β(k), Trec (k), δ(k)) that minimizes ∆D . After this,
we kept fixed the death rate and varied one more time
Trec (k) and β(k), one after the other, to minimize the
RMSE ∆C . Depending on the behavior of the real
data, in the last step, Trec (k) and β(k) can remain
unchanged.
We picked up the range 7-21 days for the recovery
time because it covers a reliable estimate for the
period in which the people might remain infectious
[26, 27, 28, 29]. On the other hand, for the states
of PR, RS, and SC, a variation from 0.05% to 1%
for the death rate δ is a satisfactory range [14, 30].
To obtain better results, the first day considered on
the fitting procedure is the next Sunday after the first
death in each locality. For this reason, the adjustment
for the three states begins in the EPI week number 14,
as shown in Fig. 2. In this figure, the real data for
C(t) and D(t) are displayed together with the model
predictions, showing that the methodology proposed in
this work can describe the natural oscillations of real
time-series.
3. Numerical results
3.1. The Effective Reproduction Number (ERN)
The quantity that determines how fast an infectious
disease spreads, considering that a relevant part of the
population is no longer susceptible and containment

measures were taken, is the Effective Reproduction
Number (ERN) Re [20].
The key aim of the
containment measures adopted by the government is
to reduce the value of the ERN, with the best scenario
taking place when Re < 1, for which the number of
newly infected individuals decrease and the pandemic
can be controlled. By using the SIRD model, we can
estimate Re (k) for each EPI week k by the relation [26]
Re (k) =

β(k)
.
1/Trec (k) + δ(k)

(5)

In Fig. 3, we show the values of Re (k), for each
EPI week k, for the states of PR, RS, and SC. We can
see that, for the three localities, the ERN oscillates
considerably, but remains in most of the time between
the values 1 and 3. However, the state of PR keeps
Re ≥ 2 in the last three EPI weeks, which explains
why it is a worrisome moment for this state. Despite
Re (25) > 2 in the last EPI week, SC is the state of
the South Region with the lowest value of hRe (k)i
(see Table 2), which could be a consequence of the
implementation of early containment measures. RS,
in turn, has the lowest current value for the ERN,
Re (25) = 1.25. Although RS is the state of the South
Region with the highest number of infected people and
deaths (see Table 1), its ERN has been decreasing in
the last four weeks.
We mention that there are other more accurate
techniques to calculate the value of Re (see, for
example, the Refs. [30, 31, 32]). The method used
in this work has limitations since it is based on a

simple epidemiological model (which does not consider
the symptomatic and asymptomatic subgroups of
individuals and the incubation period, for example)
and depends on a minimum number of experiments
to define the parametric set. However, the thorough
adjustment procedure and the choice of the parametric
intervals, defined according to the real data and studies
about the epidemiological and clinical characteristics
of COVID-19, allowed us to provide reliable values for
the ERN and to capture trends for such quantity. In
Table 2, we display the mean values of β(k), Trec (k),
δ(k), and Re (k) for each state of the Brazilian South
Region. These mean values were calculated over all
the EPI weeks considered in our analysis. The value
of Re (25), obtained for the EPI week number 25, is
also displayed since such quantity is used in the next
subsection to analyze the trends for the pandemic in
each locality.
3.2. Flattening the COVID-19 epidemic curve
In Figs. 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c), we show some projections
for the cumulative number of confirmed cases C(t) for
the states of PR, RS, and SC, respectively, using the
logarithm scale in the vertical axis. When the real data
are not available anymore, the blue continuous curves

represent the trend for C(t), obtained by considering
the hypothetical scenario for which the value Re (25)
found for each locality remains unchanged until day
150 after the first case. In Figs. 4(a) and 4(c), we can
see that for PR and SC, for which Re (25) > 2, the
value of C(t) might keep an exponential increase after
the power-law growth showed until then [3, 5]. On the
other hand, in Fig. 4(b) it is possible to see that a
smoother growth is expected for RS.
The epidemiological parameters vary daily, and it
is not probable that the ERN remains unchanged for
a long time. For this reason, long-term projections
must be revised whenever a change in the trend occurs.
Considering such probably changes, we simulated
scenarios in which the ERN decreases in the coming
days. As shown in Eq. (5), the ERN is related to
the parameters β, Trec , and δ. Since the recovery and
death rates depend on several circumstances, including
pharmacological treatments, in our simulations we kept
fixed these parameters and varied the ERN changing
the contact rate β(25). This parameter carries all
information regarding non-pharmacological measures
as, for example, to maintain 6-feet social distancing
and to use simple cloth face coverings.
In Fig.
4, the dark gray dashed and gray
dash-dotted lines describe projections obtained by
decreasing the current contact rate β(25) by 15% and
30%, respectively, which means to reduce by 15%
and 30% the ERN according to Eq. (5). It is
possible to see that a slight decrease in the current
ERN might avoid the infection of tens of thousands of
people and, consequently, hundreds of deaths. These
simulations show the relevance of the containment
measures that allow to decrease the contact rate β and,
as a consequence, to decrease the ERN.
Another important quantity obtained from the
SIRD model is the number of active infected people
I(t), plotted in Figs. 4(d), 4(e), and 4(f) for the states
of PR, RS, and SC, respectively. The blue continuous
curves show the trend for each state, and we can see
in Fig. 4(d) that the peak of I(t) for PR might be
the highest of the South Region and also might occur
earlier. On the other hand, the curve of I(t) for RS
is the most flattened, which means that the peak of
I(t) expected for this state is lower and might occur
later. These results suggest that the flattening of the
epidemic curve is related to the current value of ERN,
as demonstrated in recent studies [5, 10, 33, 34].
In Figs. 4(d), 4(e), and 4(f), the dark gray dashed
curves show that, by decreasing the current ERN by
15%, it is possible to generate a reduction of 30% and
29% in the peak of I(t) for PR and SC, respectively,
while an important shrinkage of 88% occurs for the
state of RS. A more efficient flattening of the epidemic
curve takes place by decreasing Re (25) by 30% for

by 15% and 30%, respectively. The same scenarios are shown in the panels (d), (e), and (f) for the number of active infected people

PR and SC (gray dash-dotted curves). For RS, this
reduction results in Re < 1, which means that the
peak of I(t) has already occurred and the gray dashdotted line is in a descendent way. This result can be
explained by analyzing Eqs. (2) and (5). Once Re < 1,
then β < 1/Trec + δ, and the number of individuals
exiting the subgroup I is larger than the number of
individuals entering this subgroup.
3.3. Gradual mitigation strategies to control the
hospital bed occupancy
In the absence of a vaccine, to achieve a reduction
in the contact rate between susceptible and infectious
individuals by isolating the latter is a critically
important strategy that can control the spread of
the infection [35]. In this subsection, we propose
some mitigation strategies to reduce the contact rate
gradually and to avoid the health care system collapse.
We made this analysis for the states of PR and RS, but
it can be applied to any locality.
According to the epidemiological reports published daily by the State Health Offices, about 8% of
the active infected people I(t) need medical assistance
[36, 37]. In our simulations, however, we considered
that the hospital bed demand is equal to 10% of I(t) to
obtain a reliable estimation. Furthermore, it is essential to know the current number of hospital beds that
each state allocates exclusively to COVID-19 patients.
Until June 20th , 2020, PR reserved 2027 hospital beds

for COVID-19 patients [36]. RS, in its turn, plans to
implement 2295 hospital beds in the whole state, according to the contingency plan of the RS’s government
[37]. These numbers are indicated in Fig. 5 by the vertical black dashed lines. In this figure, we can see that
such quantities of hospital beds are insufficient to supply the demand for both states considering the current
trend (blue continuous curves). The only difference between PR and RS is the time for collapse, which might
occur earlier in PR. The scenario in which Re (25) is
reduced by 30% is also insufficient for PR, as shown
in Fig. 5(a) by the gray dash-dotted line. However,
for RS this scenario provides a flattened curve for the
hospital bed demand once Re < 1.
To avoid overwhelming the health care systems in
the coming days, we propose some mitigation strategies
that can be applied to an entire community or region,
aiming to reduce the personal interactions and thereby
the transmission risk. These strategies consist of
to adopt different levels of containment measures at
specific intervals of time so that we can reduce the
contact rate β gradually until Re < 1. Such actions
can include mild measures as temperature monitoring
in public places, the use of cloth face coverings, and
the prohibition of group gathering with more than a
specific number of people in any public place, until
more rigid measures as the cancellation of services and
events, the restriction on the entry of foreigners, the
control of the entry into and exit from narrowly defined

geographic areas, and to restrict people’s transit and
business operations, for example [2]. Starting from
the current ERN for each state, given in Table 2, the
strategies are the following:
(i) To reduce by 5% the value of Re every two weeks
until Re < 1. It will take 20 weeks for PR and 8
weeks for RS.
(ii) To reduce by 10% the value of Re every two weeks
until Re < 1. It will take 10 weeks for PR and 4
weeks for RS.
(iii) To reduce by 5% the value of Re every week until
Re < 1. It will take 10 weeks for PR and 4 weeks
for RS.
(iv) To reduce by 10% the value of Re every week until
Re < 1. It will take 5 weeks for PR and 2 weeks
for RS.
The results obtained by applying these strategies are
shown in Fig. 5. For RS, for which Re (25) = 1.25,
even the mildest strategy (strategy 1) is efficient to
avoid overwhelming the health care system. However,
for PR, for which Re (25) = 2.18, only the most
rigid strategy (strategy 4) can make the hospital bed
demand to be less than the current number offered by
the state.
4. Conclusions
The SIRD model was used to fit the real data of
the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths
caused by COVID-19 in the states of PR, RS, and
SC. Our adjustment procedure consisted of minimizing
the RMSE between the model predictions and the real
data, as described in Subsection 2.1. By using this
procedure, it was possible to reproduce the data from
the past, to estimate the ERN for each EPI week, and
to make reliable projections for the future.
We found for PR and SC Re (25) > 2, and
the trend of C(t) for these localities is to follow an

exponential growth, while for the state of RS, for which
Re (25) = 1.25, we observed a more attenuated increase
for C(t). We also simulated the effects of reducing
the current ERN by applying non-pharmacological
measures that reflect on the contact rate β. In all
cases, to decrease Re can avoid the infection of tens
of thousands of people in the long term.
To avoid overwhelming the health care system, we
proposed gradual mitigation strategies that consist of
adopting mild or rigid measures at specific intervals of
time. For PR, only the most rigid strategy is efficient,
while for RS, we verified that mild measures might
flatten the epidemic curve when applied gradually. Our
results suggest that simple actions as keeping the social
distancing and clothing face coverings, when taken
early, are efficient to avoid the fast dissemination of
the COVID-19.
