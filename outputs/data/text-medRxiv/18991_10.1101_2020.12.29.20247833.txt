Abstract. Since the first case reported of SARS-CoV-2 the end of December 2019 in China, the number of cases
quickly climbed following an exponential growth trend, demonstrating that a global pandemic is possible. As of
December 3, 2020, the total number of cases reported are around 65,527,000 contagions worldwide, and 1,524,000
deaths affecting 218 countries and territories. In this scenario, Spain is one of the countries that has suffered in a hard
way, the ongoing epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, namely COVID-19 disease. In this paper,
we present the utilization of phenomenological epidemic models to characterize the two first outbreak waves of
COVID-19 in Spain. The study is driven using a two-step phenomenological epidemic approach. First, we use a
simple generalized growth model to fit the main parameters at the early epidemic phase; later, we apply our previous
finding over a logistic growth model to that characterize both waves completely. The results show that even in the
absence of accurate data series, it is possible to characterize the curves of case incidence, and even construct shortterm forecast in the near time horizon.

1. Introduction
An infectious disease is characterized because it can be transmitted, either directly or indirectly, from one
individual to another within a given population. This transmission is materialized in an increase in the number
of newly infected individuals per unit time, representing the infectious disease incidence. For example, an
infected individual may remain asymptomatic at the early stage of infection, only later developing clinical
symptoms, being diagnosed as a disease case. If the number of cases rises above the usual average within a
short period of time, a disease outbreak occurs, but if the disease spreads quickly to many people, it is an
epidemic. When the disease persists, and may remain in the population over a long period of time, the disease
is said to be endemic in the population. Finally, if the disease spreads spatially on a global scale to many
countries and continents, a global pandemic occurs [1].
At the end of December 2019, a set of pneumonia cases arisen in the city of Wuhan (Hubei province,
China). On January 7, 2020, the Chinese authorities notified a new virus from the Coronavirus family as the
probably causative agent of the outbreak namely SARS-CoV-2. The disease caused by this new virus has been
called by international consensus COVID-19, and the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized it as a
global pandemic on 11 March 2020 [2]. As of December 3, 2020, the total number of COVID-19 the reported
cases are around 65,527,000 contagions worldwide, and 1,524,000 deaths affecting 218 countries and
territories.
Nowadays, the ongoing epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, represents the more
recent global pandemic arisen in decades; demonstrating that a global pandemic is possible, showing its
potential to generate explosive outbreaks not only in cities or regions, but also in countries or continents
following human mobility patterns [4]. While the symptoms observed in COVID-19 infected people are
frequently mild, and quite similar to other common respiratory infections, it has also exhibited an ability to
generate
severe disease among certain groups, including older populations and individuals with underlying

health issues such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes [5]. Nevertheless, the transmission patterns and other
epidemiology characteristics of this novel coronavirus are still being studied.
In this scenario, Spain is one of the countries that has suffered the COVID-19 pandemic in a hard way. The
presence of the virus was first confirmed in Spain on January 31, 2020. Since then, the number of cases
quickly climbed following an exponential growth trend, reaching all provinces at March 13, 2020. At March
14, 2020, the Spanish Government imposed a confinement or lockdown that was maintained until June 21,
2020 [3, 7]. This first epidemic outbreak wave, reached its peak at March 20 with 10,651 cases reported and
996 deaths at April 2. The total cumulative number of cases as of June 21, is of 255,547, and 29,353 deaths
[8]. After the end of the confinement, it was observed a period of stability in the incidence of the disease
accounting for a low number of reported daily cases around the country. However, the number of new cases
starts climbed in July in various cities, presenting again an exponential growth trend profile, which has
remained during the last months. As of December 3, 2020, the total number of COVID-19 the total cumulative
number of cases accounts around 1,693,600 contagions, including 46,000 deaths [3]. This is hence, the so
called second wave which is currently ongoing.
This scenario drive epidemiologist, mathematicians and other scientist to study and forecast the expected
behavior of the epidemic outbreak and its dynamics. These studies are intended to assess public health
authorities to take appropriate decisions about control measures strategies, in order to mitigate the impact of
the disease in the absence of an effective vaccine.
In this paper, we present the utilization of phenomenological epidemic models to characterize the two first
outbreak waves of COVID-19 in Spain. The study is driven using a two-step approach to fit the main
parameters that characterize both waves. First, a simple growth model is used to identify the intrinsic growth
rate and the deceleration parameter for the first and the second wave, during the early stage of the epidemic.
Further, these parameters are applied in a second step using a logistic growth model, obtaining a complete
characterization of the first wave, and a forecast of the behavior of the second wave. Our main goal is, through
simulations and empirical data, to understand and characterize the current state of the epidemics waves
outbreaks of the COVID-19 in Spain. Also, we estimate the possible pandemic cessation dates, and the total
size of the epidemics at the end of the second wav by constructing mean-time forecasting e. Hence, this study
could be regarded as a valuable tool for characterizing the transmission dynamics process of COVID-19
pandemic along with the impact of control measures, when they were fully implemented and sustained.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 introduces the basics of phenomenological
epidemic models. Section 3 presents the parameter estimation process. Simulation study based on the reported
case incidence is presented in Section 4. Section 5 gives the results and discussion; and finally, future works
are proposed in Section 6.
2. Basics of phenomenological epidemic models
Classical epidemic models are based on mechanistic or physical approaches in order to identify patterns in
the observed data, comprising the laws involved in the dynamics of the population or transmission dynamics
of a disease. These models such as Kermackand‚ÄìMcKendrick [9] or Anderson and May [10] are based on
compartments of population in which it is assumed that in the absence of control strategies, the growth
dynamics in the first stage of an epidemic is exponential. By contrast, phenomenological epidemic models
provide an empirical approach without a specific basis on the physical laws or mechanisms that give rise to
the observed patterns in the data. Most of commonly used phenomenological epidemic approaches are based
on population growth models [18].

2.1. The Generalized Growth Model (GGM).
The Generalized Growth Model (GGM) is based on phenomenological population growth dynamics. The
model emphasizes in the reproducibility of empirical observations and have been proven to be very useful to
model early epidemics in various diseases such as SARS, Ebola, Zika or COVID-19 [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. This
model assumes sub-exponential growth dynamic at the beginning of the disease rather than exponential. The
GGM relies on two parameters to relax the assumption of exponential growth and is defined by the differential
equation 1 as follows [16]:
ùëëùê∂(ùë°)
= ùê∂ ' ùë° = ùëüùê∂ ) (ùë°)
ùëëùë°

(1)

Here, ùê∂ ' ùë° represents the incidence at time t, whereas the solution C(t) is the cumulative number of cases
at time t. The parameter r is a positive value denoting the intrinsic growth rate (1/t), and the parameter p is
considered the deceleration of growth factor where p √é [0, 1]. If p = 0 this differential equation describes a
constant incidence curve over time, where the cumulative number of cases grows linearly. By contrast, if p = 1
it models exponential growth dynamics, and the solution of the equation is ùê∂ ùë° = ùê∂+ ùëí -. , where ùê∂+ is the
initial number of cases. Choosing intermediate values of p whiting 0 and 1, the equation describes subexponential growth behavior. For example, for p = 1/2 incidence grows linearly while the cumulative number
of cases follows a quadratic polynomial. For p = 2/3 incidence grows quadratically while the cumulative
number of cases fits a cubic polynomial [11]. This model can also support different epidemic growth patterns
depending on the interval in which the value of p moves. This includes linear incidence patterns for p = 0.5,
concave-up incidence patterns for 0 > p > 0.5, and concave-down incidence patterns for 0.5 < p < 1 [11].
2.2. The Generalized Logistic Growth Model (GLGM).
Despite GGM provides an adequate approximation to for the initial phase or early epidemics of the
transmission dynamics of a disease, this model does not take into account reductions in the disease incidence
due to the characteristics of the pathogen, the immunity of the population, or the implementation of medical or
social measures. Therefore, consider unlimited growth of contagion is quite unrealistic. To solve this issue,
some epidemic models considers logistic growth, in which for a given stable population, it would have a
saturation level which representing a numerical upper bound for the growth size of the epidemic. This bound
is typically called the carrying capacity K and in this model, represents the final size of the epidemic. This
parameter is crucial to estimate how severe could be the disease, since it represents the final size of the
population that became infected. The GLGM is defined by the differential equation 2 [17, 18]:
ùëëùê∂(ùë°)
ùê∂(ùë°)
= ùê∂ ' ùë° = ùëüùê∂ ) (ùë°) 1 ‚àí
ùëëùë°
ùêæ

(2)

where C(t) represents the cumulative number of cases at time t, r is the intrinsic growth rate, p is the scaling of
growth parameter. As in the GGM p = 1 indicates early exponential growth, whereas p = 0 represents constant
growth, and 0 < p < 1 accommodates early sub-exponential or polynomial. K > 0 is the carrying capacity or
final size of the epidemic, which represents the total number of affected population. This parameter is crucial
to generate post-peak forecasts and also, can be linked to an import parameter of classical epidemic models
such as the basic reproduction number R0, which represent the transition phase of non‚Äìequilibrium process of
propagation of a disease. This parameter constitutes a key epidemiological threshold in biological systems
since if R0<1 the infection dies out while if R0>1 it may cause an epidemic disease. In fact, assuming that

COVID-19 can be modelled as the simplest but useful SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemic model
[1], the basic reproductive number can be calculated as R0 = S0/œÅ, where œÅ = (S0‚ÄìS‚àû)/(ln S0‚Äìln S‚àû), S0 is the
initial population of susceptible, and K = S0‚ÄìS‚àû is the final size of the epidemic.
3. Parameter estimation
Parameter estimation can be considered as the process of finding parameter values and their confidence
intervals that best fit a given model, to the empirical data. In this study, we follow the methodology presented
in [14, 19, 20] that has been used to characterize the incidence of various infectious diseases such as Ebola,
Smallpox, Measles, or Zika. In essence, this methodology comprises a process that starts with the initial
adjustment of the data, then the parameters for each model are fitted based on early epidemic phase. Since
these parameter estimations are typically subject to sources of uncertainty, it is constructed the 95%
confidence intervals derived from parameter uncertainty.
3.1. Data sources
Since the beginning of the pandemic in Spain, surveillance of cases of this disease is based on the universal
notification of all confirmed COVID-19 cases that are identified in each Autonomous Community [7]. The
Autonomous Communities (CCAA) make an individualized notification of COVID-19 cases through a webbased computer platform managed by the National Epidemiology Center (CNE). This information comes from
the epidemiological case survey that each Autonomous Communities completes upon identification of a
COVID-19 case. Despite the fact that some studies have suggested that the number of infections and deaths in
Spain may have been underestimated [21], for simulation purposes our study is based on the case incidence
reported by the Ministry of Health of Spain, and brought as csv file in the official data repository [7]. The time
interval comprises 44 weeks (308) days, ranging from January 31, 2020, to December 3, 2020. Figure 1,
shows the profile of daily cases reported as blue circles (Fig. 1.a), as well as the curve of cumulative number
of cases blue solid line (Fig. 1.b). In both pictures, it is easy to identify the two epidemics waves.

2020, to December 3, 2020.

3.2. Parameter fitting.
One of the simplest way to estimate the parameters from observed data is using nonlinear least squares
fitting. This method tries to obtain the solution that best-fit the curve of the desired model, given a set of data

points. For example, aplying a non-linear least-squares solver, that uses a Trust-Region-Reflective algorithm
(or the Levenberg‚ÄìMarquardt algorithm) to provide model coefficients that minimize the sum of squared
differences between the model and a set of data [22]. Basically, these methods considers a parameter set ùúÉ =
(ùúÉ3 , ùúÉ5 , ‚Ä¶ , ùúÉ7 ), the family of curves ùë¶ = ùëì(ùë°, ùúÉ) that depend on parameter ùúÉ, and a set of data points (t1, y1),
(t2, y2), ..., (tn, yn). The nonlinear least-squares fitting, tries to find the value of coefficients ùúÉ such that the
curve ùë¶ = ùëì(ùë°, ùúÉ) minimizes the objective function:
ùúÉ = min (ùëì ùë°= , ùúÉ ‚àí ùë¶.> )
.

(3)

In order to use a least-squares fitting correctly, it should be defined for the desired parameters ùúÉ, the upper
and lower bounds, and an initial guess. In the case of GGM ùúÉ = (ùëü, ùëù) and for GLGM ùúÉ = (ùëü, ùëù, ùêæ). Also,
after the parameters have been estimated, the function provides the residuals, as the difference between the
best fit of the model and the time series data as a function of time, in the form ùëüùëíùë† ùë°= = ùëì ùë°= , ùúÉ ‚àí ùë¶. . This is
used to assess the quality of the model fit.
3.3. Quantifying parameter confidence intervals.
Before the generation of the short-term incidence forecast we still need to quantify the uncertainty of the
parameter estimates to construct the 95% confidence intervals, and to identify the potential parameter
deviation. One of the methods to quantify parameter uncertainty is the parametric bootstrapping [23, 24].
Basically, this method re-estimates the parameters from the previously best-fit model ùúÉ, by sampling
repeatedly multiple observations and generating synthetic datasets. Also, it is considered that the time series
follow some distribution error structure (binomial, Poisson, etc.). This method can be implemented in
different ways [19, 24]. For this study, we use the parametric bootstrap approach proposed in [19] that has
been applied to model various infectious diseases such as Ebola, Smallpox, or Zika [14, 15]. This method
assumes that the time series of data follows a Poisson distribution error structure, centered on the mean of the
time points of each observation [25]. For a given set of parameter ùúÉ, a parametric bootstrapping of m
realizations it is derived a new set of re-estimated parameters ùúÉ= , where i = 1, 2,‚Ä¶, m. The resulting
uncertainty around the new model fit is given by the set of curves ùë¶3 = ùëì3 (ùë°, ùúÉ3 ), ùë¶5 = ùëì5 (ùë°, ùúÉ5 ), ‚Ä¶, ùë¶D =
ùëìD (ùë°, ùúÉD ).
3.4. Short-term forecasting of incidence curves.
The previous calibration of GGM parameters, together the confidence intervals provides a characterization
of the early epidemics respect the first and second wave. But we also aim to characterize the profile of the first
epidemic wave, and the expected behavior of the second epidemic wave in the near time horizon. In the case
of the COVID-19 pandemic, short-term forecast (days or weeks) is useful to develop medical plans or to
schedule contention measures in the absence of an effective vaccine. However, it is important to keep in mind
that forecasts are often inaccurate as these are mostly based on the current values and uncertainty of the
parameters of the system, which are likely to change over time. Moreover, the further out the forecast is made,
the more wrong it is expected to be [19]. One method to construct short-term forecast, is to extend the entire
uncertainty of the system using the uncertainty associated to the previously computed parameter estimates
[19]. In this way, the current state of the system in a given time, is propagated to a time horizon of T time
units ahead. Then, the set of curves ùë¶3 = ùëì3 (ùë°, ùúÉ3 ), ùë¶5 = ùëì5 (ùë°, ùúÉ5 ), ‚Ä¶, ùë¶D = ùëìD (ùë°, ùúÉD ) are newly computed as
‚àó
ùë¶3‚àó = ùëì3‚àó (ùë° + ùëá, ùúÉ3 ), ùë¶5‚àó = ùëì5‚àó (ùë° + ùëá, ùúÉ5 ), ‚Ä¶, ùë¶D
= ùëìD‚àó (ùë° + ùëá, ùúÉD ).

4. Simulation study
4.1.

Characterizing the early epidemic phase.

In this simulation, we start estimating the parameters r and p for the first and second wave using the GGM
approach. For the first wave, it is assumed an early epidemic period of 38 days, (from February 6, 2020 to
March 14, 2020), and the initial number of cases reported C0 = 11. For the second wave, it is assumed an early
epidemic period of 45 days (from, July 30, 2020, to August 14, 2020) and the initial number of cases reported
C0 = 540. To compute the least-squares fitting, the guess for parameters was set for both waves as r = 0.5 and
p = 0.5, and the bounds as 0< r <10 and 0< p <1 respectively. Figure 2 shows for the GGM model, the best fit
of the early epidemic period for the first wave (Fig. 2.a) and for the second wave (Fig. 2.b) of the COVID-19
in Spain. The blue circles represent the reported daily case incidence, while the continuous red line
corresponds to the best fit of the GGM to the data. Also, it has been displayed the residuals ùëüùëíùë† ùë°= =
ùëì ùë°= , ùúÉ ‚àí ùë¶. in the right panel of each figure. It should be noted the random pattern of the residuals as a
function of time, which suggest that the GGM model has provided a reasonably good fit to the early growth
phase of the epidemic.

Spain. Blue circles represent the reported daily case incidence, while continuous red line corresponds to the best fit of the model. The
residuals are displayed in the right panel each wave.

After determining the best fit for r and p, now we build the 95% confidence intervals by quantifying the
parameter uncertainty. Figure 3 displays the re-fitting of parameters of the early epidemic phase for the first
and the second wave using the GGM. The model has been calibrated using m = 300 bootstrap realizations, and
assuming a Poisson distribution error structure. The blue circles are the cases reported daily, while the solid
red line corresponds to the best fit of the GGM to the data. The grey lines correspond to the m bootstrapping
realizations of the epidemic curves. The black lines correspond to the 95% of confidence interval (CI) bounds
around the best fit of the model to the data. The top panels show histograms displaying the empirical
distributions for parameter estimations.

data. Grey lines correspond to the m bootstrapping realizations of the epidemic curves. Black lines correspond to the 95% CI bounds.
The empirical distributions for parameter estimations are displayed in the top panel for each wave.

Also, it has been constructed a short-term forecast of 7 days for the first wave (from, March 14, 2020 to
March 20, 2020), and of 21 days for the second one (from August 14, 2020, to September 3, 2020), by
extending the entire uncertainty from the early epidemic period, as described in section 3.4. Figure 4 shows
the resulting curves. The calibration period is separated from the forecast period with a vertical slashed grey
line. All the curves at the right side of this line, correspond to the forecast time horizon. The red line
corresponds to the best fit of the forecasted epidemic curve. The black lines correspond to the 95% confidence
bounds around the best fit of the forecasted curves, and grey lines correspond to the m bootstrapping
realizations of the forecasted epidemic curves.

best fit of the forecasted curves, and grey lines correspond to the m bootstrapping realizations of the forecasted epidemic curves. The

4.2. Characterizing the complete epidemic waves dynamics.
The previous calibration of GGM and the resulting confidence intervals provide a properly adjustment
model to data of the early epidemic for the first and second wave. However, GGM only considers unlimited
growth of contagion, thus it is not adequate to model an epidemic that has entered or surpassed the peak of
contagions. By contrary, GLGM includes the upper bound for the growth size of the epidemic to better
characterize the after-peak dynamics of the epidemics, but brings poor adjustment to data in the early stage of

the epidemic. Hence, to solve both problems, for the early stage of the epidemic of GLGM we will use the
previous parameters and the resulting confidence intervals computed for GGM. Later, assuming that at the
time to write this article, the first epidemic wave is finished and that the second wave is ongoing, but
approaching to the peak of the maximum case reported, we use the GLGM to better characterize the whole
dynamics of the epidemics.
To start with, now we estimate the best fit of the early epidemic using GLGM approach. It should be noted
that GLGM is quite sensitive to initial definition of guess parameters as well as to the time intervals defined
for the early epidemic phase. Therefore, previous to the definition of that values, we performed some
simulations in order to better understand the dynamics of this epidemics. For the first wave, it is assumed an
early period of 38 days, (from February 6, 2020 to March 14, 2020), and the initial number of cases reported
C0 = 11. To compute the least-squares fitting, we use the mean of previous parameters estimation from GGM,
thus the guess for parameters was set as r = 0.29 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.30) and p = 0.96 (95% CI: 0.96, 0.97), and
the bounds was set as 0< r <10 and 0< p <1. Also, we stablish the limits for K at 1< K <47.3¬∑106, where the
upper limit is the population of Spain at January 2020 [7]. Assuming that K is unknown, we estimate the final
size of the epidemic as of 100,000 cases reported at the end of the first wave. For the second wave, it is
assumed an early epidemic period of 55 days (from, July 8, 2020, to September 2, 2020) and the initial
number of cases reported C0 = 898. Again, we use the mean of previous parameters estimation from GGM.
Hence, the guess for parameters was set as r = 3.6 (95% CI: 3.40, 3.70) and p = 0.64 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.65), and
the bounds was set as 0< r <10 and 0< p <1. The limits for K are stablished as 2.4¬∑105 < K <47.3¬∑106, where
the lower limit is the mean value of the final size of the epidemic obtained from the calibration of the early
epidemic of the first wave using GLGM. Since the second wave is still ongoing, K is unknown and we
estimate the final size of that epidemic at 357,110 cases reported.

Spain. Blue circles represent the reported daily case incidence, while continuous red line corresponds to the best fit of the model. The
residuals are displayed in the right panel each wave.

Now, after determining the best fit for both waves, we re-estimate the parameters r, p and K for the
GLGM, and build the 95% confidence intervals by quantifying the parameter uncertainty. Figure 6 displays
the re-fitting of parameters of the early epidemic phase for the first and the second wave using the GLGM.

The empirical distributions for parameter estimations are displayed in the top panel for each wave.

Based on the previous calculations, now we can determine the epidemic profile for each wave by extending
the entire uncertainty to a concrete period of time as described in section 3.4. For example, taking into account
that the first wave is finished, we can add to the early epidemic period, a forecast of 108 days ahead to June
20, 2020. Figure 7 shows for the GLGM model, the best fit characterization of the first wave using m = 300
bootstrap realizations. In Figure 7.a, the blue circles are the daily cases reported. The solid grey lines
correspond to the m bootstrapping realizations of the epidemic curves. The solid red line corresponds to the
mean confidence or best fit of the GLGM respect the data; while solid black lines correspond to the upper and
lower bounds of 95% confidence around the best fit of the model to the early epidemic. Also, it has been
included in this figure, the curve of cumulative number of cases represented in Fig. 7b as the solid blue line;
the red line corresponds to the best fit of the GLGM to the data. Grey lines correspond to the m bootstrapping
realizations of the epidemic curves. Black lines correspond to the 95% CI bounds.

To model the second wave, we determine the epidemic profile by extending the entire uncertainty to a

5. Results and discussion
Simulation results and the main parameters that characterize both waves are shown in Table 1, bringing
important information about the behavior of the epidemics over time. For the first wave, GGM and GLGM
models indicate that its dynamics follows an exponential growth dynamics, with values of p ‚âà 1, and the
cumulative number of cases can be obtained by the equation ùê∂ ùë° = ùê∂+ ùëí -. . In the case of GLGM, the model
estimates a final size of the epidemic K = 2.40¬∑105 (95% CI: 2.1¬∑105, 3.2¬∑105), whereas the data reported is
2.58¬∑105 cases This is displayed in Fig. 7.b. Also, the model is able to detect the peak of the epidemic for that
first wave accurately.
In the case of the second wave, we have first estimate the epidemic profile to the last data available at the
time to write this article. The GGM and GLGM models indicate that the epidemics curve follows a concavedown incidence pattern (0.5 < p < 1). In GGM, it has been obtained values of p = 0.64 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.65),
which are near to 2/3, predicting that the incidence will grow quadratically, while the cumulative number of
cases will follow a cubic polynomial pattern. Likewise, the GLGM model also indicates similar behavior for
the epidemic growth, obtaining a value of p = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.60). In this case, since the second wave is
ongoing, the final size of the epidemic is forecasted. Hence, we have extended the entire uncertainty to
January 29, 2021, obtaining K = 2.48¬∑106 (95% CI: 1.93¬∑106, 3.24¬∑106), when the current data indicate that as
for December 3, 2020, the cumulative number of cases reported is 1,693,591. The profile of the cumulative
number of cases, reported and forecasted, are shown in Fig. 8.a.

Table 1. Main parameters that characterize the epidemic curves of the COVID-19 in Spain, from January 31, 2020 to a

forecasted period to January 29, 2021.

Overall, our analysis of empirical COVID-19 disease data in Spain, using GLGM model has revealed that,
in the absence of an effective vaccine in the near months, the epidemic profile of the second wave can become
in the third epidemic wave or, even more, it could remain in the population for long time, probably, to the end
of summer 2021. This should be take into account in order to implement strict contention measures.
6. Conclusions and future work
In this paper, we have described the utilization of two phenomenological models to understand and
characterize shifts in the epidemic growth patterns of the epidemics waves outbreaks of the COVID-19 in
Spain. We have illustrated the proposed approach through simulations using data gathering of 44 weeks, and
coupling the Generalized Growth Model (GGM) and the Generalized Logistic Growth Model (GLGM). Our
findings indicate that even if the information about the disease is very limited or scattered, using an adequate
combination of phenomenological models, it is possible to assess epidemic growth patterns over time, and
even construct near or long terms forecasts.
In general, the model shows that in the absence of an effective vaccine, the second wave was likely
inevitable and arrived just a few days after the end of the confinement. Likewise, the model shows that the
delay in the implementation of strict control interventions at the beginning of this second wave, and the
maintenance of these measures, may have caused an excess in the exponential growth of cases disease. This is
reflected in the increase of the value of intrinsic growth rate r and, the basic reproductive number R0 of the
second wave, respect the first one. In this context, the basic reproductive number R0 seems to be quite
unrealistic, indicating that probably not all infected has been properly diagnosed and accounted. Hence, at the
current state of the epidemic, it has been demonstrated that the strategy of adaptive or partial confinement may
not be effective at all as a control measure, and even that a third wave is possible.
In future works, our goal is to provide a better approximation of the up to date epidemic curves of the
COVID-19 in Spain, based on more complex phenomenological models. For this purpose, it is crucial to
dispose of accurate and up to date sets of data series of diagnosed and reported cases.
