Abstract
Objective: To assess thealth equity-oriented COVID-19 data reporting across Canadian
provinces and territories, using a scorecard approach.
Method: A scan was performed of provincial and territorial reporting of five data elements
(cumulative totals of tests, cases, hospitalizations, deaths and population size) across three units
of aggregation (province or territory-level, health regions, and local areas) (15 “overall”
indicators), and for two vulnerable settings (long term care and detention facilities) and six social
markers (age, sex, immigration status, race/ethnicity, essential worker status, and income) (120
“equity-related” indicators). Per indicator, one point was awarded if case-delimited data were
released, 0.7 points if only summary statistics were reported, and 0 if neither was provided.
Results were presented using a scorecard approach.
Results: Overall, information on cases and deaths was more complete than for tests,
hospitalizations and population size denominators needed for rate estimation. Information
provided on jurisdictions and their regions, overall, tended to be more available (average score of
53%, “B”) than for equity-related indicators (average score of 21%, “D”). Only British Columbia
and Alberta provided case-delimited data, and only Alberta provided information for local areas.
No jurisdiction reported on outcomes according to patients’ individual-level immigration status,
race, or income. Only Ontario and Quebec provided detailed information for long-term care
settings and detention facilities.
Conclusion: Socially stratified reporting for COVID-19 outcomes is sparse in Canada. However,
several “best practices” in health equity-oriented reporting were observed and set a relevant
precedent for all jurisdictions to follow for this pandemic and future ones.

1. Introduction

Early reporting by regional and provincial jurisdictions in Canada suggests that like in other
countries such as the United States of America (USA),1,2 social inequities in COVID-19
outcomes have emerged in Canada. In Ontario, for instance, higher rates of COVID-19
incidence, hospitalization, and death have been observed in lower-income areas and areas with
higher densities of immigrant and racialized residents.3 Toronto has reported that 83% of
COVID-19 cases with available race data, identified between mid-May and mid-July 2020,
occurred among racialized residents, despite these residents representing 52% of the city’s
population.4

These early reports of social inequities in COVID-19 outcomes beg several questions for public
health policy and intervention. Since the identification of these inequities is predicated on the
availability and release of COVID-19 surveillance data according to social markers, one
fundamental question is how Canada is doing, overall, in health equity-informed COVID-19 data
reporting across jurisdictions? Knowing which inequities have emerged, and where, is a
necessary first step in planning health equity-informed health policy and interventions.2

Indeed, public release and reporting on surveillance data have been essential to inform
epidemiologic research and modelling and public health interventions since the start of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Presenting data disaggregated by social markers, such as sex or race, can
ensure that social and political responses to the health crisis are sensitive to and designed to be
effective against social disparities in outcomes.5 Data transparency also serves to protect the
public’s trust in public health guidelines and ensure accountability.6 However, given that
provincial and territorial rather than federal public health authorities are the primary entities
collecting and reporting on health data in Canada, public-facing output on local- or social
marker-disaggregated data can vary across Canadian jurisdictions. An assessment of both overall
and health equity-oriented COVID-19 data reporting in each Canadian province and territory is
needed to identify both best practices and reporting gaps.

The objective of this study was to perform an environmental scan of COVID-19 data reporting
across Canadian provinces and territories and to assess health equity-focused reporting using a
scorecard approach. Scorecards can be used to help track health-related trends or the quality of
data reporting across jurisdictions 7. Here, we build on the USA-based Coronavirus in Kids
(COVKID) Tracking and Education Project’s recently proposed COVKID State Data Quality
Report Card 8 which was designed to identify gaps in COVID-19 related surveillance in children.
We propose the Canadian COVID-19 Health Equity Data Scorecard as an evaluation framework
for the Canadian context.

2. Method

2.1 Data
A detailed environmental scan of official provincial and territorial public health websites and
published reports was performed to identify reporting data content. Reference websites used
were those provided by the Public Health Agency of Canada on their centralized reporting
website.9 Provincial and territorial websites were searched for data summaries, figures, tables as
well as downloadable reports (most often available in portable document (PDF) format), by
navigating through websites and downloading and reviewing reports. The scan was performed
between June 11 and August 11, 2020, and the results are accurate to the latter date.

2.2 Scorecard indicators
Based on the minimum data requirements proposed by extant COVID-19 data quality
assessments, such as the COVKID Project Data Quality Report Card,8 we assessed provinces’
and territories’ reporting of five data elements: cumulative totals of tests performed, case counts,
hospitalizations and deaths, as well as the availability of data on the size of populations of
interest (i.e. the necessary denominator for rate estimation).

We assessed the availability of these five data elements across three geographic units of
population aggregation (overall province or territory-level, health region- or unit-level, and
Forward Sortation Area-level or small neighbourhood area equivalent). Reporting on various
levels of spatial aggregation was assessed given that transmission epidemiology and distributions

of risk factors can vary across jurisdictions. We also assessed data reporting across eight equityrelated indicator strata: two settings that have been particularly vulnerable to COVID-19
outbreaks (long term care and detention facilities)10,11 and six social markers (age, sex,
immigration status, race/ethnicity, essential worker status, and income groups). The latter social
markers have been identified as key social determinants of health and infectious disease burden
.12,13 With the five data elements across three units of population aggregation—overall and
across eight social strata, 135 indicators were used (5 * 3 * (1 “overall” stratum + 8 social strata)
= 135).

As done for other scorecards, these indicators were selected for being measurable, relevant for
health equity surveillance, actionable, and interpretable.7 Indeed, precedent exists for
surveillance reporting across all social markers used, including by race/ethnicity14,15 and essential
worker status16—if not for COVID-19 than other common health outcomes.9,17,18

2.3 Analysis
For each of the 135 indicators, 1 point was awarded if raw, anonymized case-delimited data were
released and publicly available (i.e. where each case represented one data row, available in a
downloadable, and editable file format, such as in Comma Separated Values (.csv) format). A
total of 0.7 points were awarded if summary statistics were reported for the indicator, but no raw
case-delimited data were publicly available, and a score of 0 was awarded if neither information
was reported nor data made publicly available. To contrast surveillance reporting across
jurisdictions at a national scale, points were only awarded if the data element was available for
the entire jurisdiction (i.e. not if data were only available for certain regions).

We used a near-complete (0.7 points; intentionally higher than a half-point) and complete (1
point) scoring system rather than a binary (present/absent, 0 vs. 1 point) method to acknowledge
the relevance of summary statistic reporting, while rewarding jurisdictions that opted for full data
transparency for public use—as done in peer nations such as the United Kingdom19 and the
United States.20 Raw data sharing has been identified as a best practice in supporting innovation
and research, advancing government accountability and evidence-informed decision-making.
6,21,22

It also allows for an intersectional assessment of indicators. For example, the child health4

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.23.20200147; this version posted September 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this

focused COVKID Scorecard found that though many states report on COVID-19 outcomes by
age and race, a limited number of states report on the race of cases by age group (thereby
allowing for an assessment of racial disparities among children).8 The sharing of case-delimited
data allows users to pursue these more precise lines of inquiry.

A percent score was computed by dividing the sum of points awarded by the total number of
indicators (N=135). Two sub-scores were also computed, a score for “overall” data available for
each level of aggregation overall (5 data elements * 3 population aggregation units * 1 “overall”
stratum = total score out of 15) and an equity indicator score for reporting across the remaining
social strata (5 data elements * 3 population aggregation units * 8 social strata = total score out
of 120).
We adjusted score denominators to take into account that reporting on some of the indicators,
such as the cumulative total of deaths or hospitalizations, is less relevant in jurisdictions without
any recorded cases or when case numbers are so low (i.e. n<5) that reporting may jeopardize
patient confidentiality. When the total number of observations needed to estimate the indicator
was less than 5, the indicators were removed from the denominator total. In that way, if one
jurisdiction had not recorded any COVID-19 cases, for example, it was not penalized for not
reporting on cases by age, sex, etc. Lastly, the following letter grades were associated with
documented percent scores: 0% to 24% scores graded as “D”, 25% to 49% as “C”, 50% to 74%
as “B”, and 75% to 100% as “A”.

3. Results

Scores were estimated for each province and territory, and Canada overall (Figure 1, with
detailed scores and sources in Supplementary File, Table 1). On average, approximately half
(53%) of the data elements were available at the overall jurisdictional, health region, and local
neighbourhood level, while approximately one in five (21%) equity-related data elements were
available.

3.1 Overall data reporting
3.1.1 By provinces and territories
All provinces and territories reported on the total number of tests and cases (Figure 2a-b), with
British Columbia and Alberta providing case-delimitated data for all cases observed (Figure 2b).
Most jurisdictions also reported on the total number of hospitalizations that have occurred,
however, these data were not provided by Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and the Yukon (Figure

2c). All jurisdictions that had identified cases reported on the total number of deaths (Figure 2d).
Alberta is the only province that reported on the outcomes (recovery or death) for each case, in a
downloadable case-delimited format. Lastly, population denominators for all jurisdictions were
available through the Canadian Census.

3.1.2 By health region
The overall number of tests conducted per health region was only available for half of the
jurisdictions (Figure 2a). Reporting on the total number of cases per health region was more
complete, with British Columbia and Alberta both standing out as provinces that provide data on
the region of residence for all identified cases (Figure 2b). Overall, most provinces that reported
on overall hospitalizations (Figure 1c) also provided summaries of hospitalizations per health
region (Figure 2c)—New Brunswick, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island were the exceptions to
this rule. Except for Nova Scotia and the Yukon, data on deaths per health region were available
for all jurisdictions reporting over five COVID-19 cases (Figure 2d). Lastly, population
denominators for all health regions within jurisdictions were available from Statistics Canada’s
Canadian Census.

3.1.3 By Forward Sortation Area or local neighbourhood area equivalent
Though population denominators are made available by Statistics Canada for all Forward
Sortation Areas in Canada, no province or territory reported on the overall number of tests or
hospitalizations at this level of population aggregation. Alberta was the only jurisdiction to report
on the number of cases and deaths (including the absence of the latter, n=0) for all local areas of
residence—these were the only two data elements included in their reporting at the local arealevel.

3.2 Equity-oriented reporting by social markers and vulnerable settings

3.2.1 By age and sex
Information on population sizes by age and sex overall, and for regions and local areas is
available through the Canadian Census. Of all the social markers studied, age and sex were the
characteristics for which COVID-19 data reporting was most common. At the overall-level,
almost all provinces reported on cases’ age and sex distribution—save for Newfoundland, which
did not report sex-disaggregated case information (Figure 4). British Columbia and Alberta were
the only two provinces that provided age and sex characteristics of all cases, in a case-delimited
format. The Yukon, the only territory with over five recorded cases, did not report on cases’ age
nor sex (Figure 4) at the territory or regional level.

In contrast, age- and sex-related information was sparser for testing, hospitalizations, and deaths
across all jurisdictions overall and by health regions. Only Ontario consistently reported on all
data elements by age and sex at the overall provincial and health region level (Figure 4).

3.2.2 Immigration, race/ethnicity, income, essential worker status
Though information on population sizes by immigration status, race/ethnicity, and income are
available for jurisdictions overall, and by region and local area are all available through the
Canadian Census, no province or territory reported on any of the data elements according to
these social markers (Figure 4).

At the overall level, on British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario provided
information on cases among essential healthcare workers—with Alberta providing this
information at both the province and regional levels (Figure 4). However, the total number of
essential workers at the provincial or territorial level, or by region or local area were missing for
all jurisdictions.

3.2.3 Vulnerable settings (long-term care and detention facilities)
Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland, British Columbia were the only jurisdictions that consistently
provided detailed data on cases (and deaths) associated with long term care facilities—with
10

Ontario and Quebec including listing precise facilities (that could be geolocated in local areas)
that had or were experiencing outbreaks. In the latter provinces, however, the total number of
tests and hospitalizations recorded for patients or staff in these settings was missing, and only
Ontario provided data on the total number of beds per facility experiencing an outbreak—which
could be used as a proxy for patient population size.

Quebec and Ontario were the only provinces that reported on the total number of cases for each
provincial detention facility. Of these two, Quebec was the only province to report on the total
number of tests, deaths, number of prisoners, and cases among staff per facility. Missing,
however, was information on cases’ potential hospitalization status.

4. Discussion

This paper provides the first summary of health equity-related COVID-19 data reporting in
Canada. In Canada, information on cases and deaths was more complete than for tests,
hospitalizations and population denominators for all indicators. Jurisdictions tended to report
more completely on overall statistics than on information according to population sub-groups.
The scan suggests that large gaps in reporting remain, even for more standard social
disaggregation markers such as age and sex. Though relatively uncommon across the country,
certain “best practices” in reporting emerged. For example, two provinces (Alberta and British
Columbia) provided case-delimited data on cases for external users to study. Alberta was
singular in reporting data elements for each of the three levels of geography: for the province
overall, by health region, and by local area-level. Ontario and Quebec consistently provided
detailed information for long term care settings, going as far as listing individual facilities that
had or were experiencing outbreaks – which can enable the precise geo-location of facilities
within neighbourhoods, for use in socio-spatial analyses of transmission risk. Lastly, though
Ontario and Quebec both provided details on cases within provincial detention facilities, Quebec
was alone in providing detailed information on COVID-19 tests, deaths, prisoner population size,
and cases within staff populations per detention facilities. These examples set important
precedents and guidance for other jurisdictions to follow, especially as emerging evidence

suggests that if COVID-19 outcomes are properly examined across population subgroups,
underlying inequities can be revealed and addressed.3,4

Heterogeneities in reporting observed across Canada are aligned with previous findings that
public health surveillance infrastructures and capacities tend to vary across jurisdictions in
Canada—which had been identified as an area of concern for pandemic planning and
preparedness following the SARS outbreak in 2003.23 This variability in resources across
jurisdictions may limit capacities to collect necessary social data and report on findings across
settings or social markers. Exchange of promising practices—be it on equity-related reporting
guidelines,24 questionnaires for social data collection,17 or data communication—may be
beneficial to improve equity-related reporting in Canada. The scorecard approach presented here
can be used for continued assessesments of COVID-19 surveillance reporting or adapted for use
in future infectious disease outbreaks.

However, the scorecard approach used has certain limitations. For one, a restricted list of social
marker indicators was used. Future expanded versions of an equity-oriented scorecard could
assess COVID-19 outcome reporting according to indicators such as preferred language, year of
immigration, disability status, sexual orientation, housing status, level of social support, gender,
Indigenous identity, or education level.17 Second, by evaluating provincial or territorial
reporting, this scorecard assessment did not address more detailed reporting efforts in smaller
public health units. For instance, detailed neighbourhood-level reporting efforts have been made
by Montreal Public Health25 and several public health units in Ontario.26 The present scan was
restricted to provincial and territorial reporting in order to contrast between jurisdictions on a
national scale. Future scans of best practices at the regional level may be warranted. Further, this
scan excludes information sharing by federal bodies such as the Correctional Service of
Canada’s reporting on cases within federal penitentiaries.27 Future reporting assessements
asessing federal-level reporting may also be warranted.

5. Conclusion

Though some “best practices” in health equity-oriented reporting were observed in Canada,
equity data reporting is sparse and large gaps remain. Since jurisdictions that have explored
potential social inequities in COVID-19 indicators have found stark gradients in outcomes across
individual- and local-area level characteristics, the absence of reporting of data according to
vulnerable settings or social markers may be concealing broader COVID-19-related inequities in
Canada. The proposed scorecard format and examples of “best practices” identified herein can be
used to guide surveillance and reporting during this pandemic and in and future ones.
