Abstract

21

Background: Infections with the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2

22

(SARS-CoV-2) have quickly reached pandemic proportions and are causing a global health

23

crisis. First recognized for the induction of severe disease, the virus also causes asymptomatic

24

infections or infections with mild symptoms that can resemble common colds. Since

25

infections with mild course are probably a major contributor to the spread of SARS-CoV-2,

26

better detection of such cases is important. To provide better understanding of these mild

27

SARS-CoV-2 infections and to improve information for potentially infected individuals, we

28

performed a detailed analysis of self-reported symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-

29

CoV-2 negative individuals.

30

Methods: In an online-based survey, 963 individuals provided information on symptoms

31

associated with an acute respiratory infection, 336 of the participants had tested positive for

32

SARS-CoV-2 infection, 107 had tested negative, and 520 had not been tested for SARS-CoV-

33

2 infection.

34

Results: The symptoms reported most frequently by SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were

35

tiredness, loss of appetite, impairment of smell or taste and dry cough. The symptoms with the

36

highest odds ratios between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative individuals were loss of

37

appetite and impairment of smell or taste. Based on the most distinguishing symptoms, we

38

developed a Bayesian prediction model, which had a positive predictive value of 0.80 and a

39

negative predictive value of 0.72 on the SARS-CoV-2 tested individuals. The model predicted

40

56 of 520 non-tested individuals to be SARS-CoV-2 positive with more than 75% probability,

41

and another 84 to be SARS-CoV-2 positive with probability between 50% and 75%.

42

Conclusions: A combination of symptoms can provide a good estimate of the probability of

43

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Background

50

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus

51

associated with the coronavirus infectious disease 19 (COVID-19), at the end of 2019 [1] has

52

quickly developed into pandemic proportions and was declared a public health emergency of

53

international concern by the World Health Organization on January 30th 2020 [2] . The first

54

infections in Europe occurred in Italy and Germany in late January 2020 [3]. By March 2020,

55

SARS-CoV-2 infection rose rapidly in many countries, and have started to do so again with

56

the fall season in the northern hemisphere; as of November 6th 2020, more than 48 million

57

people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2, and more than 1.2 million SARS-CoV-2 related

58

deaths have been reported [4].

59

Due to the rapid rise in demand for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests and a resulting shortness of

60

supplies, not all patients could be given access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in spring 2020, and a

61

pre-screening was performed on the basis of symptoms, and prior residence in SARS-CoV-2

62

risk areas or prior contact to individuals who had tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. The lack of

63

access to testing led to many uncertainties for patients with cold symptoms. From the first

64

cases in China, the typical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection were described as dry cough,

65

fever, and pneumonia [5, 6]. These first reports of symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2

66

infection / COVID-19 were based on symptoms found in hospitalized patients with severe

67

disease. Notably, in the first reports on COVID-19, disease course was considered mild if

68

patients did not require ventilation. It soon became obvious though that many SARS-CoV-2

69

infected individuals experienced asymptomatic or now commonly considered non-severe

70

disease course that resembled common colds and did not require hospitalization [7]. Since the

71

hospitalized and critically ill patients were of the greatest concern in the early days of the

72

pandemic, the range of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with mild symptoms

73

was not the focus of attention. In following studies, it has been found that many SARS-CoV-2

74

infected patients experienced altered or completely lost sense of smell and / or taste [8, 9],

75

which has since been regarded as a key indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

76

To get a more detailed picture of the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we created an

77

online questionnaire and invited both tested and untested individuals to report their symptoms.

78

The symptoms included in the survey comprised general symptoms such as fever, fatigue,

79

headache and joint or muscle pains, and more specific eye, nose, throat, respiratory and

80

gastrointestinal symptoms. The self-reported symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 positive- and

81

negative-tested individuals were then used to fit a Bayesian model, which was used to predict

82

probabilities of a SARS-CoV-2 infection of the non-tested survey participants.

Methods

85

Data collection

86

Data were collected in an online questionnaire based on LimeSurvey software hosted on the

87

servers of the University of Duisburg-Essen. Participants of the online survey were recruited

88

via public health offices of the city of Hamm (Northrhine-Westphalia, Germany), of the

89

administrative district Soest (Northrhine-Westphalia, Germany), of the administrative district

90

Hochsauerland (Northrhine-Westphalia, Germany) and the SARS-CoV-2 testing center in

91

Lünen, administrative district Unna (Northrhine-Westphalia, Germany), as well as via social

92

media. Participants were invited to complete the survey in case of a positive as well as

93

negative SARS-CoV-2 test result, and also if they had not been tested but had cold symptoms.

94

The data were collected between April 6th and September 1st 2020.

95

Data analysis

96

Data were analyzed using R (version 3.6.3) and RStudio software and fsmb, plyr, splyr,

97

tidyverse, randomForest, patchwork, rstanarm, ROCR, ggplot2, viridis and bayesplot

98

packages. Only data from individuals who had completed the survey were included in the

99

analysis.

100

For graphic representation of the survey results of tested individuals, data were sorted for the

101

SARS-CoV-2 test result, the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and the severity of fever

102

using the tidyverse package, and a heatmap of the survey data was generated using ggplot2

103

package.

104

Frequencies of individual symptoms were calculated and visualized as heatmap using ggplot2

105

and viridis package. Odds ratios for individual symptoms were calculated as the conditional

106

maximum likelihood estimate with 90% confidence interval using the pairwise.fisher.test

107

command of R package fsmb, results were visualized using ggplot2.

108

Random Forest analysis of the survey data was performed using R package randomForest 4.6-

109

14 [10] with default parameters. Importance of individual symptoms was characterized as

110

mean decrease of Gini index on random permutations of case labels.

111

A Bayesian regression model was fitted with R package rstanarm version 2.21.1 [11] using

112

the function stan_glm with default priors, on all or 10 selected symptoms of the tested

113

individuals’ data as indicated in the results section, using a posterior sample size of 4000. To

114

adjust for differences in the number of SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative tested participants,

115

the dataset from negative participants (n = 107) was increased by bootstrapping to match the

116

number of positive participants (n = 336). Bootstrapping was performed 4 times to exclude a

117

bias of the results, with similar outcome. The R package bayesplot [12] was used to confirm

118

the model validity by posterior predictive checks. Performance of the Bayesian and Random

119

Forest based models as ROC curves (true positive rate and false positive rate) and area under

120

the ROC curve were calculated with R package ROCR [13]. The numbers of true positives

121

(TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) was determined using

122

posterior predictions > 0.5 as positives and posterior predictions ≦ 0.5 as negative; positive

123

predictive value (PPV) was calculated as PPV = TP / (TP + FP), negative predictive value

124

(NPV) was calculated as NPV = TN / (TN + FN). The credibility intervals for PPV and NPV

125

were calculated using the Voila online tool [14], which is based on a Bayesian classifier

126

uncertainty estimate method [15].

127

For prediction of SARS-CoV-2 infection in untested individuals, the Bayesian model was

128

applied to the dataset from the untested individuals and the most likely SARS-CoV-2

129

infection state was calculated for each of these individuals. For visualization of the prediction

130

outcome, a heatmap was generated using ggplot2 after sorting the non-tested individuals by

131

the predicted probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection as calculated for the Bayesian model.

Results

134

To obtain an overview of the subjective symptoms reported by SARS-CoV-2 infected

135

individuals, an online survey was performed. Invitations to the survey were published on

136

social media, and SARS-CoV-2 tested individuals were also directly invited to participate

137

when they received notification of their test results, or by subsequent invitation, by local

138

public health offices. Participants included both tested individuals, as well as non-tested

139

individuals, who were considered separately in the analysis of the survey. The characteristics

140

of the tested study population are represented in Table 1. In total, responses of 443

141

participants who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the survey, 336

142

(75.8 %) had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, while 107 (24.2 %) of those

143

participants had tested negative. 293 (66.4 %) of the tested participants were recruited via the

144

public health office, whereas 150 (33.6 %) tested participants were recruited from social

145

media.

146

Of the 336 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, only 18 (5.3 %) reported no symptoms,

147

whereas 141 (42.2 %) and 102 (30.1 %) reported their symptoms as mild or moderate,

148

respectively, and 49 (14.7 %) reported their symptoms as severe. 20 (5.9 %) individuals were

149

treated in the hospital due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and another 6 (1.8 %) required

150

intensive care treatment.

151

The symptoms reported by the tested study population are shown as a heatmap in Figure 1,

152

frequencies of the symptoms reported by SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative individuals are

153

presented in Figure 2A. Clearly, a majority in both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative

154

individuals reported general symptoms such as tiredness and lethargy. The presence of eye

155

symptoms in both groups was low, and also most nose symptoms were reported only by a

156

minority of participants. Interestingly, about two thirds of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals

157

reported an impaired or lost sense of smell or taste. Dry cough was reported by almost 60% of

158

both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative individuals, whereas most SARS-CoV-2 positive

159

individuals did not report other throat symptoms including throat pain. Approximately one

160

third of individuals reported breathing problems, and also diarrhea was reported by

161

approximately a third of SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative individuals.

162

The frequency of symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative individuals were used to

163

calculate the odds ratios for the individual symptoms (Figure 2B). Since the distribution of

164

many symptoms was similar in SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative individuals, many odds

165

ratios are close to 1. Clearly, the highest odds ratios were observed for impaired or lost sense

166

of smell (estimate: 4.7; 90% confidence interval (CI): 2.8 – 8.1) and impaired or lost sense of

167

taste (4.3; 90% CI: 2.6 – 7.2), whereas the other nose symptoms as well as eye and throat

168

symptoms were found to have odds ratios below 1. The lowest odds ratios were observed for

169

throat pain and burning sensation in the throat. The odds ratio of dry coughing is also slightly

170

below 1 (0.9; 90% CI: 0.6 – 1.5), which may likely be an underestimation due to a bias in

171

eligibility criteria at the time of testing.

172

For the development of a prediction model, we performed a Bayesian regression analysis of

173

all symptoms and plotted them with their odds ratio in combination with the overall frequency

174

(Figure 3A). As we have an imbalanced data set with less negative than positive tests, the

175

resulting model would have been biased towards positive predictions. To avoid this, we fitted

176

the model with two different approaches. In one, we increased the number of negatives by

177

bootstrapping to match the number of positives, in the other we decreased the number of

178

positives to match the number of negatives. Both approaches gave comparable results, but we

179

favored the first one as it uses all the available data and is less prone to the introduction of a

180

bias due to sample selection. For the final model, we selected symptoms that had marginal

181

posterior probabilities of 90% or more to be either positively or negatively associated with

182

positive or negative test results with mean posterior probabilities of > 0.5 or < -0.5 in the

183

Bayes regression analysis, and were reported by at least 20% of the positive or negative

184

individuals. We also performed a random forest regression analysis (Figure 3B), which

185

confirmed the importance of the selected symptoms.

186

Based on these analyses, we selected the ten symptoms impaired or lost sense of smell, throat

187

pain, loss of appetite, joint pain, runny nose, muscle pain, headache, fever higher than

188

38.5 °C, tiredness and chills. As stated above, the high representation of dry cough in SARS-

189

CoV-2 uninfected symptomatic individuals is likely due to the fact that it was communicated

190

very early on as a typical symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and was therefore a criterion

191

for testing. Furthermore, we observed a strong correlation between impaired or lost sense of

192

taste and sense of smell (Pearson’s r = 0.72). Therefore, neither dry cough nor loss of taste

193

were included in the final Bayes model.

194

We used the selected ten symptoms to fit the final Bayesian regression model (Figure 4A). On

195

the tested cohort data set, the model gave an area under the receiver operating characteristic

196

curve of 0.80 (AUC; Figure 4B), a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.80 (95% credible

197

interval: 0.74 – 0.84) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.72 (95% credible interval:

198

0.68 – 0.77). We applied the Bayesian model to the non-tested individuals who participated in

199

the survey. The characteristics of this second study population are represented in Table 1. In

200

total, responses of 520 participants who had not been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection were

201

included in the survey. Using the Bayesian model described above, we calculated that 56

202

(10.8%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive with a probability of more than 75% (Figure 4C).

203

Another 84 individuals (16.2%) were predicted as SARS-CoV-2 positive with a probability

204

between 50% and 75%. For the other 380 individuals (73.1%), the probability of SARS-CoV-

205

2 infection based on the Bayesian model was less than 50%.

Discussion

208

The data presented here provide a very detailed picture of the symptoms experienced by

209

SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. To our knowledge, we are providing the most detailed

210

symptoms overview reported so far, having queried 45 symptoms ranging from general

211

symptoms to specific eye, nose, throat, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.

212

The data collected in this survey show that a range of symptoms is observed in a majority of

213

patients, such as an impaired or lost sense of smell or taste, tiredness, lethargy, loss of

214

appetite, joint or muscle pains and dry coughing. For some symptoms, we found surprisingly

215

low frequencies in infected individuals and therefore low odds ratios, including all throat

216

symptoms other than dry cough. Furthermore, only roughly one fifth of SARS-CoV-2

217

infected individuals experienced throat pain, which could be expected to be much higher since

218

virus is routinely identified in throat swabs, showing that it is indeed infecting throat tissue.

219

For some symptoms, a bias may have been introduced into the dataset at two levels: some

220

symptoms had been described early in the pandemic as typical for SARS-CoV-2 infection,

221

and have therefore been criteria for testing, and on the other hand, the presence of these

222

symptoms and the testing procedure itself may have increased the awareness of the affected

223

individuals and increased their motivation to participate in this study. We expect that such a

224

bias might exist for the symptoms “dry cough” and “difficulty breathing”. The odds ratios

225

reported here may therefore be underestimates.

226

While many of the symptoms reported by SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals taken on their

227

own are not useful for a prediction of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a prediction model based on 10

228

symptoms as we present here can provide a good estimate of the probability of a SARS-CoV-

229

2 infection. The model therefore may provide useful guidance for personal behavior when

230

symptoms are experienced as well as in the allocation of tests. It has to be noted though that

231

while the positive predictive value of the model we describe here is rather high (0.80), the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.25.20236752; this version posted November 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this

perpetuity.

232

negative predictive value is lower (0.72). When used in the future for personal risk

233

assessment, a predicted low probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection should therefore still be

234

interpreted with caution and personal protection measures should be maintained.

235

Other studies have been performed investigating symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and their

236

predictive value. Studies in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic were reporting

237

symptoms of hospitalized patients and thus missed the symptoms that are associated with

238

mild disease courses [5, 6, 16]. Since then, multiple other studies have been performed that

239

focused on the symptoms experienced by SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at a community

240

level [8, 9, 17-21]. A large study has been performed using a mobile phone app that had more

241

than seven thousand SARS-CoV-2 tested participants from the United Kingdom and the

242

United States [19]. In this study, the authors found frequencies for the symptoms “loss of

243

smell and taste”, “fever”, “skipped meals” and “diarrhea” that are comparable to the

244

frequencies reported by us and reported positive odds ratios for these symptoms, with the

245

highest odds ratio for “loss of smell and taste”. The authors report a similar frequency of

246

“persistent cough” in the SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals as we found for “dry cough”; in

247

contrast to our data, the frequency in SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals was lower than in our

248

cohort, leading to a low positive odds ratio for the persistent cough, in contrast to our

249

findings. The authors provided a prediction model based on age, sex, loss of smell and taste,

250

persistent cough, severe fatigue and skipped meals, which obtained a positive predictive value

251

of 0.69 and a negative predictive value of 0.75.

252

In another large study, only a small number of symptoms were surveyed: sore throat, cough,

253

shortness of breath, loss of smell or taste, and fever [20]. Interestingly, the authors report

254

distinctly lower frequencies for all these symptoms in their SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals,

255

which were mostly only half of the frequencies we observed in our study and as low as only

256

2% of respondents reporting a fever of 38°C or higher, compared to more than 33% observed

257

by us. This study also included a large number of individuals who were COVID-19

258

undiagnosed, who were ten times the number of diagnosed individuals, however more than

259

95% of the undiagnosed individuals reported to feel well and not have any of the queried

260

symptoms, creating an imbalance between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative study

261

population. The model proposed in that study that relies on this small number of symptoms

262

would likely prove less effective when applied to a cohort comprising more symptomatic

263

individuals.

264

In contrast to these two large-scale studies, we did not include age and sex in our models but

265

included more symptoms, which resulted in a higher positive predictive value. Some of the

266

symptoms included in our model are more subjective and may vary in strength, for example

267

tiredness and loss of appetite. However, we think that modeling a prediction on this higher

268

number of symptoms provides a more precise model that can be used for a first prediction of

269

the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, guiding decisions for self-isolation and testing.

270

Conclusions

271

Our data shows that many symptoms reported by SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals are rather

272

unspecific and on their own are not amenable to a clear distinction of SARS-CoV-2 infection

273

from infections with other viruses causing common cold symptoms. Nevertheless, our

274

Bayesian model based on 10 symptoms provides a good prediction of probability of SARS-

275

CoV-2 infection. The model can provide a probability estimate and provide guidance in test

276

allocation where testing capacities are limited.
