Abstract:
Evidence from observational studies suggested that smokers are at increased risk
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to assess the causal effect of
smoking on risk for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity using two-sample
Mendelian randomization method. Smoking-associated variants were selected as
instrument variables from two largest genetic studies. The latest summary data of
COVID-19 that shared on Jan 18, 2021 by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative
was used. The present Mendelian randomization study provided genetic evidence that
smoking was a causal risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. In
addition, there may be a dose-effect relationship between smoking and COVID-19
severity.

Background
Evidence from observational studies suggested that smokers are at increased risk of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1, 2). Two-sample Mendelian randomization
(MR) study could be used to assess the effect of smoking on risk of COVID-19
because it could assess causality and could limit the bias caused by confounders (3).
We aimed to assess the causal effect of smoking on risk for COVID-19 susceptibility
and severity using two-sample MR method.
Methods
Four following measures of smoking were chosen as exposures: smoking initiation:
defined as ever being a regular smoker; lifetime smoking: a continuous variable that
accounting for smoking status, age at smoking initiation and cessation, cigarettes per
day, and a simulated half-life constant effected on health outcomes; cigarettes per day:
defined as the average number of cigarettes smoked per day; and smoking cessation:
defined as current smoking vs. former smoking. Independent and genome-wide
significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for these measures were selected
from two large genetic studies (Figure 1) (4, 5).
We used the latest summary data of COVID-19 that shared on Jan 18, 2021 by the
COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (Figure 1) (6).
Two-sample MR analyses were performed using the TwoSampleMR package in
R 3.6.0.(3) We chose random-effects inverse variance weighted method as the main
MR method. Several other MR methods were chosen to perform sensitivity analysis.
Additional sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding SNPs associated (p <
5×10-8) with body mass index (BMI) because previous MR study showed BMI was
the only one cardiometabolic factor that associated with COVID-19 (7). P value of
MR analysis small than 0.003 (0.05/16) was considered as statistically significant. P
value of MR analysis small than 0.05 was considered as nominally significant.
Results
Main MR analyses showed smoking initiation was significantly or nominally
associated with outcomes of COVID-19 cases vs. population controls, hospitalized
COVID-19 cases vs. population controls, and very severe respiratory confirmed

COVID-19 cases vs. population controls. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were 1.15 (1.07–2.13, p = 1.27×10-4), 1.33 (1.16–1.51, p = 2.35×10-5),
and 1.29 (1.07–1.56, p = 0.009) respectively (Figure 2). The ORs were 1.14 (p =
8.84×10-4), 1.30 (3.71×10-4), and 1.33 (p = 0.008) after excluding BMI-associated
SNPs.
Main MR analyses showed lifetime smoking was significantly associated with
hospitalized COVID-19 cases vs. population controls (OR = 1.71, 95% CI =
1.22–2.39, p = 0.002) and nominally associated with hospitalized COVID-19 cases vs.
not hospitalized COVID-19 controls (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.08–4.12, p = 0.029)
(Figure 2). The ORs were 1.66 (p = 0.007) and 2.24 (p = 0.031) after excluding
BMI-associated SNPs.
Main MR analyses showed cigarettes per day was nominally associated with
hospitalized COVID-19 cases vs. population controls (OR = 1.45, 95% CI =
1.06–1.99, p = 0.021) and hospitalized COVID-19 cases vs. not hospitalized
COVID-19 controls (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.15–2.89, p = 0.011) (Figure 2). The ORs
were 1.41 (p = 0.048) and 1.78 (p = 0.023) after excluding BMI-associated SNPs.
Main MR analyses showed no significant effect of smoking cessation on any of
the four COVID-19 outcomes (Figure 2).
Although the significant results were not confirmed in some sensitivity analyses
using other MR methods, no evidence of unbalanced pleiotropy was found by MR
Egger regression (p > 0.097).
Supplemental Figures show the SNP effects on exposures and outcomes across
multiple MR methods.
Discussion
We could not assess the effect of current smoking and former smoking separately
because the data was not available. Meta-analyses suggested that current smokers had
higher odds compared with non-current smokers but lower odds compared with
former smokers for COVID-19 susceptibility and adverse outcome (1, 2). This finding
was not supported by the present study because the present study showed current
smoking was not associated with decreased risk of COVID-19 susceptibility and

severity compared with former smoking. However, the statistical power is relatively
small for exposure of smoking cessation in the present study. In addition, time since
cessation may also associated with COVID-19 risk (1).
Conclusion
The present MR study provided genetic evidence that smoking was a causal risk
factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. In addition, there may be a
dose-effect relationship between smoking and COVID-19 severity.

A proxy SNP (R2>0.8) was chosen (if available) if an exposure-associated SNP was
