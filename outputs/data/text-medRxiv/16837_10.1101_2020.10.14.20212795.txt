Abstract
Since its first emergence from China in late 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread globally
despite unprecedented containment efforts, resulting in a catastrophic worldwide pandemic.
Successful identification and isolation of infected individuals can drastically curtail virus spread
and limit outbreaks. However, during the early stages of global transmission, point-of-care
diagnostics were largely unavailable and continue to remain difficult to procure, greatly inhibiting
public health efforts to mitigate spread. Furthermore, the most prevalent testing kits rely on reagentand time-intensive protocols to detect viral RNA, preventing rapid and cost-effective diagnosis.
Therefore the development of an extensive toolkit for point-of-care diagnostics that is expeditiously
adaptable to new emerging pathogens is of critical public health importance. Recently, a number of
novel CRISPR-based diagnostics have been developed to detect COVID-19. Herein, we outline the
development of a CRISPR-based nucleic acid molecular diagnostic utilizing a Cas13d ribonuclease
derived from Ruminococcus flavefaciens (CasRx) to detect SARS-CoV-2, an approach we term
SENSR (Sensitive Enzymatic Nucleic-acid Sequence Reporter). We demonstrate SENSR robustly
detects SARS-CoV-2 sequences in both synthetic and patient-derived samples by lateral flow and
fluorescence, thus expanding the available point-of-care diagnostics to combat current and future
pandemics.

Introduction
Following emergence from China in late 2019 1–3, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) 1,4 has spread to almost every country despite unprecedented control efforts 5.
Compared to H1N1, Ebola, MERS, and SARS-CoV-1 outbreaks of recent decades, this novel
coronavirus represents the first pandemic characterized by widespread global transmission coupled
with significant mortality. Pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers have been identified as
major contributors to the prolific spread of SARS-CoV-2 4,6,7 however, in many cases these patients
go unidentified and unisolated, exacerbating the spread of the disease. Thus, robust identification
and isolation of all infected individuals are essential for controlling disease transmission. The
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic thus presents an unparalleled global public health emergency, which
spurred the urgent development of molecular diagnostics and therapeutics for timely patient
identification, isolation and treatment. The economic, health, and societal damage wrought by
SARS-CoV-2, highlights the importance of expanding and improving on current diagnostic
technologies to identify and prevent future pandemics.
Early diagnostics detected SARS-CoV-2 infection through the amplification of viral RNA (vRNA)
by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 8–10. These tests were time
consuming 11, limited by reagents 12, required advanced equipment, and yielded significant falsenegatives 13–16 possibly exacerbated by genetic variation within the targeted viral genomic
sequences 17. Next generation sequencing-based diagnostics reduced false-negative rates, but still
require specialized equipment and are slow (~12 hours) 18. Therefore, developing alternative
technologies with the potential to yield cost- and time-effective point-of-care diagnostics demands
investment.
CRISPR-Cas nucleases can be easily programmed to target nucleic acids in a sequence-specific
manner 19–21, making them prime candidates for the detection and diagnosis of viral genetic
material, and forming the CRISPR-based diagnostics (CRISPRDx) pipeline 22–25. These systems
rely on Type II Cas enzymes to physically bind target sequences 26, or collateral cleavage by Type
V or Type VI enzymes to detect DNA 24,25,27 or RNA species, respectively 22,23,28. Since pandemic
onset, an array of innovative diagnostics and prophylactics relying on these technologies have been
adapted to detect or target SARS-CoV-2 with unprecedented speed 26,29–40, most notably
represented by the DETECTR (DNA Endonuclease Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter) 24,25 and
SHERLOCK (Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter unLOCKing) 22,23 systems
(Summarized in Fig. S1, Table S1).
The SHERLOCK system combines isothermal amplification of target sequences, followed by target
recognition via Leptotrichia wadei Cas13a (LwaCas13a) and collateral cleavage of a bystander
ssRNA probe to report the presence of a target 22. This system has undergone significant
optimization since its first development in 2017. This includes improvement of i) sensitivity, by the
inclusion of an accessory protein to amplify signal or substitution of RPA with LAMP 23,41,42, ii)
specificity, by primer and guide optimization 22,23, iii) throughput, by multiplexing detection using
additional enzymes (including a cocktail of LwaCas13a, PsmCas13b (Prevotella sp. MA2016),
CcaCas13b (Capnocytophaga canimorsus Cc5), and AsCas12a (Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6)) 23,
and iv) validation as a point-of-care diagnostic by using lateral flow and ultrafast RNA extraction
methods 23,31,33,43. Ideally, to maximize all the capabilities of SHERLOCK and expand the

CRISPRDx toolkit, it is important to evaluate alternative Cas enzymes that can complement or
supplement the system.
Similar to Cas ribonucleases used in other CRISPRDx systems, Cas13d enzymes such as
RfxCas13d (CasRx), exclusively target RNA species that trigger subsequent collateral cleavage of
bystander RNA 44–46. Collateral cleavage is initiated following on-target ssRNA cleavage by the
HEPN domain-based endoRNase heterodimer, which activates trans-cleavage of nonspecific
bystander RNAs 20,44,46,47. Furthermore, Cas13d enzymes are approximately 20% smaller than
Cas13a-Cas13c effectors, and do not require a Protospacer Flanking Sequence (PFS) 20,44,46,48,
presenting an advantage for protein production and flexible targeting. While the genetic modulatory
effects of CasRx have been thoroughly characterized in Drosophila, zebrafish, and human cells
44,45,49
, and its putative prophylactic properties against SARS-CoV-2 have been demonstrated 40, its
potential as a diagnostic system has not yet been explored.
In an effort to expand the CRISPRDx toolkit, herein, we report the first use of CasRx 44 as a
molecular diagnostic, developing a unique system we term SENSR (Sensitive Enzymatic Nucleicacid Sequence Reporter) and demonstrating robust detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences (Fig.
1A). Following on-target cleavage, CasRx exhibits collateral cleavage of off-target nucleic acids
44,45
, a feature shared by Cas nucleases used in other CRISPRDx systems 22–25. We exploit the
collateral cleavage activity of CasRx to detect SARS-CoV-2 in both synthetic templates as well as
in patient-derived samples via fluorescence-based readout, and paper-based lateral flow assay. To
maximize specificity, we performed an extensive bioinformatic analysis to identify novel conserved
and specific viral targets to minimize false-negative and false-positive rates, respectively. We
demonstrate that SENSR facilitates attomolar sensitivity in just under two hours total reaction time.
The detection limit of SENSR is comparable to, though slightly less than, previously established
CRISPRDx systems 31,35,38 and shows promise for improvement.
Results
Development of the SENSR protocol
Derived from protocols originally developed for (Fig. S1, Table S1) SHERLOCK 22,23,31,48, we
designed a two-step protocol for the detection of nucleic acids using recombinant CasRx purified
after expression in E. coli (Fig. S2). The protocol requires an initial 45-minute isothermal
preamplification reaction combining reverse transcriptase and recombinase polymerase
amplification (RT-RPA) 50 producing a short dsDNA amplicon encompassing the CasRx target site
and containing a T7 promoter sequence. This is followed by an in vitro transcription (IVT)-coupled
cleavage reaction which converts the dsDNA amplicons into ssRNA, recognizable by CasRx for
cleavage, resulting in collateral cleavage of a bystander ssRNA probe. Collateral cleavage of the
probe is analyzed by either fluorescence or lateral flow readouts, thus indicating the initial presence
or absence of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences (Fig. 1A, Fig S3).
Target selection and reagent validation
To ensure high analytical specificity, we identified conserved gRNA target sites using a
bioinformatic pipeline to identify 30 nt target sequences conserved among the first 433 published

SARS-CoV-2 genomes available at Genbank on April 7th, 2020, and without homology to other
coronaviruses (ViPR, Virus Pathogen Resource, n = 3,164). This yielded a panel of gRNA target
sites (n=8846) less likely to result in false positives or negatives due to sequence constraints (Fig.
S4, Table S2, S3). Because RT-qPCR assays recommended by the WHO and CDC target the
envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) genes within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we selected these genes
as the targets of SENSR for system validation (Fig. 1B) 8,51. The bioinformatic analysis revealed
multiple specific sequences within the N-gene (n = 150), to which we designed three gRNAs
(gRNA-Z, -AA, -AC) (Table S2, Fig. S5A). However, the stringent bioinformatic search criteria
did not identify targets specific to SARS-CoV-2 within the E-gene due to high sequence homology
with the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene. We, therefore, relaxed the criteria to include target sites sharing
homology with distantly related SARS-CoV-1 which is presently absent from the general
population. From this, we selected three E-targeting guides (gRNA-R, -T, -V), with two displaying
complete (gRNA-T (433/433), gRNA-V (433/433)) and one with nearly complete (gRNA-R
(430/433)) conservation among the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes (Table S4, Fig. S5A). To
validate these gRNAs, we generated synthetic SARS-CoV-2 targets encompassing the E- and Ngenes (Table S5), and tested for in vitro cleavage with purified CasRx protein (Fig. S2). Initial
characterization of on-target cleavage properties revealed significant degradation of target
transcripts for all guides tested (Fig. S5B, C) motivating further assessment of all candidates. To
determine the most effective gRNAs for use in SENSR, we monitored fluorescence accumulation
over time in an IVT-coupled cleavage reaction for each gRNA. All gRNAs induced robust
fluorescence within minutes, with the exception of gRNA-AA and -AC which produced no signal
(Fig. 1C, D). gRNA-T (E-targeting) and gRNA-Z (N-targeting) were selected for downstream
analysis due to their robust cleavage activity as well as sequence conservation among all publicly
available SARS-CoV-2 patient sample isolates (Fig. 1B-D, Table S2, S3).
Fluorescence-based detection of SARS-CoV-2
We and others have recently demonstrated that on-target cleavage activates a secondary collateral
cleavage property of CasRx 44,45. We initially evaluated the in vitro collateral cleavage activity of
CasRx with gRNA-T and gRNA-Z through gel electrophoresis. By incubating CasRx, gRNA-T or
gRNA-Z, and varying the addition of synthetic templates, we found CasRx collateral cleavage was
only activated when the synthetic template added complemented the gRNA target sequence (Fig.
1E, F). We sought to exploit this tandem, collateral cleavage activity to cleave a bystander
fluorescent probe in trans, facilitating detection of SARS-CoV-2 by fluorimetry (Fig. 1A, Fig. S3).
The quenched fluorescent reporter within RNaseAlert v2 has been used to report collateral cleavage
of Leptotrichia wadeii (LwaCas13a), Capnocytophaga canimorsus Cc5 (CcaCas13b), and
PsmCas13b (Prevotella sp. P5-125) in the SHERLOCK systems 22,23,48, but our preliminary analysis
of RNaseAlert v2 failed to yield fluorescence with CasRx in the presence of a synthetic target
(Student’s t-test gRNA-T: p=0.4294, gRNA-Z: p=0.1510) (Fig. S6A). Prior work suggested CasRx
preferentially cleaves targets containing poly-U stretches 44, with complementary work
demonstrating collateral cleavage of targets rich in both poly-A and poly-U stretches 46. To develop
a probe cleavable by CasRx, we therefore generated two custom 6 nucleotide ssRNA probes, polyA and poly-U, each conjugated to a 5’ fluorescent molecule (6-FAM) and a 3’ fluorescence
quencher (FQ), whose separation following cleavage results in detectable fluorescence
accumulation (Fig. 1A). Following incubation of CasRx, with either gRNA-T or -Z, in the presence
or absence of their respective synthetic targets (E- or N-gene), the poly-U probe yielded significant

fluorescence for 10000 copies/𝜇L compared to the no-template control (NTC) (Student’s t-test
gRNA-T, gRNA-Z: p<0.0001), while the poly-A probe produced no detectable fluorescence signal
(Student’s t-test gRNA-T: p=0.5953, gRNA-Z: p=0.7935), suggesting a preference for poly-U
stretches by CasRx, and motivating its use in the remainder of experiments (Fig. S6A, Table S5).
Following probe selection, we moved to evaluate the collateral cleavage activity in the context of
fluorescence. We set to determine if the gRNA incubated with the respective target sequence
dictates the increase in fluorescence signal over time. To do so, we incubated CasRx, gRNA-T or
gRNA-Z, the modified poly-U probe, and varied the addition of synthetic templates, while
fluorescence data were acquired on a plate reader. We observed fluorescence signal only
accumulated, and thus collateral cleavage activated, when the synthetic template added to the
reaction complemented the gRNA target sequence (Fig. 2A, B). After optimizing preamplification
reaction input volume using 100 copies/𝜇L of synthetic RNA, and determining 50%
preamplification reaction volume input to be optimal (Fig. S6B), we then determined the LOD by
fluorescence for gRNA-T and gRNA-Z titrated at log scale from 10,000 to 0 copies/𝜇L. We
determined the LOD to be 100 copies/𝜇L (Fig. 2C, D), indicating SENSR exhibits attomolar
sensitivity comparable to other CRISPRDx systems 22,24. These results demonstrate CasRx can
robustly detect and report the presence of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA via fluorescence readout.
Lateral flow assay development
Collateral cleavage by CasRx can additionally be exploited to detect synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA
by lateral flow assay, facilitating detection by simple paper test strip and eliminating the need for
expensive laboratory equipment (Fig. 1A, Fig. S3). Similar to assays developed by others 23,48, we
developed a 6 nucleotide ssRNA probe conjugated with 5’ 6-FAM and 3’ biotin (Bio) compatible
with Millenia HybriDetect lateral flow strips (Table S5). In brief, collateral cleavage results in
separation of 6-FAM from biotin, detectable following capillary action down a paper dipstick
imprinted with streptavidin or anti-FAM secondary antibodies at distant ends (Fig. 1A). The
absence or presence of the upper band therefore indicates a negative or positive result, respectively
(Summarized in Fig. 1A, Fig. S3). Using this protocol, we demonstrated that SENSR can be
adaptable to readout by lateral flow, and determined the LOD of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA to
be as low as ~100 copies/𝜇L, however with variability between guides (Fig. 2E, F). These results
confirm that SENSR, like other CRISPRDx systems, can be adapted for read-out by lateral flow,
indicating the potential for future application within point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests.
Specificity of SENSR against known possible off-targets
Diagnostic assays require stringent specificity parameters to limit false- negatives/positives.
Because many Cas effectors tolerate some degree of mismatch 52–54, unintended false-positives can
occur as a result of cleaving closely related off-target sequences. In a health-care setting, SENSR
is unlikely to be exposed to randomly generated high-identity sequences, and will more likely
encounter closely related natural homologs. Therefore, we identified the four highest-identity
natural homologous sequences to the gRNA-T and gRNA-Z target sites via BLAST. In each case,
SARS-CoV-1 variants, Bat coronaviruses, and Pangolin coronaviruses were identified as the most
closely related potential off-targets (OT), containing 2 or 3 mismatches, with gRNA-Z also
targeting an additional unknown marine virus and a porcine genome sequence with 7 mismatches

(Fig. S7A, B, Table S6). We synthesized these sequences as DNA templates containing a T7
promoter and assayed for off-target cleavage tolerance of gRNA-T and gRNA-Z in an IVT-coupled
cleavage reaction analyzed via fluorescence detection. We found that gRNA-T was sufficiently
specific to exclusively recognize the synthetic E-gene fragment (ANOVA, p<0.001), precluding
recognition of any off-targets, which showed no significant differences in fluorescent signal with
the NTC (ANOVA, Dunnett’s test OT1: p=0.9998, OT2: p=0.5242, OT3: p=0.6633, OT4:
p=0.8475) (Fig. S7C). gRNA-Z demonstrated detection of the N-gene synthetic template and the
most similar pangolin coronavirus off-target templates compared to the NTC (N, OT1, OT2:
p<0.0001), thus presenting some degree of mismatch tolerance for gRNA-Z. Fluorescence signal
for OT3 and OT4 did not differ from the NTC (ANOVA, Dunnett’s test OT3: p=0.8877, OT4:
p>0.9999) (Fig. S7D).
CasRx-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 from patient isolates
We next sought to determine the capability of SENSR to detect SARS-CoV-2 from infected patient
samples and directly compared these results to RT-qPCR-validated diagnostics. RT-qPCR analysis
of patient samples was performed by targeting the N-, S-, and Orf1ab-genes (Table S7), and
accordingly, we selected gRNA-Z to directly compare SENSR fluorescence detection to N-gene
RT-qPCR Ct values. We performed fluorescence detection analysis on 42 RT-qPCR validated
positive (n = 21) and negative (n = 21) patient samples. By fluorescence, SENSR yielded no falsepositives among negative patient samples demonstrating 100% specificity (0/21), and obtained a
conservative 57% concordance with confirmed positive samples (12/21) when the threshold for
detection is set at S/N > 2 (Fig. 3A, B, Table S7). For RT-qPCR analysis of viral infections, a lower
Ct value indicates a higher viral load within an isolated sample. SENSR demonstrated robust
detection of infected patient samples with Ct values ≤ 20, detecting SARS-CoV-2 vRNA in (8/9)
such samples (Sample ID: 1-9) (Fig. 3A, Table S7). SENSR could detect SARS-CoV-2 vRNA up
to a maximum Ct value ≤ 28 with a moderate 25% (4/16) false-negative rate (Fig. 3A, B, Table
S7). Next, we confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 can be achieved by lateral flow analysis. We
performed lateral flow analysis on the 12 positive samples resulting in S/N > 2, and correlating to
a Ct ≤ 28, to determine if SENSR can operate as a point-of-care diagnostic. Using lateral flow, we
observed 92% (11/12) concordance with SENSR fluorescence analysis (Fig. 3C). These findings
confirm SENSR can be successfully adapted for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 from patient
samples, however, further optimization will be required to improve sensitivity and consistency.
Discussion
With an increasingly interconnected world and expanding global population, future pandemics are
inevitable. The COVID-19 pandemic spread prolifically in the early months of 2020, with
containment elusive in part due to the scarcity of point-of-care diagnostics. The seemingly infinite
adaptability of CRISPR has, or promises to, accelerate the development of everything from lifesaving gene therapies 55–57 and pig-to-human organ donations 58; to disease-eradicating gene drives
59–61
and possibly the re-animation of the Woolly Mammoth 62,63 - with CRISPR-based diagnostics
(CRISPRDx) being no exception. Though still nascent, CRISPRDx, like other CRISPR
technologies, has proven fast to develop, highly flexible, capable of multiplexing, making it the
ideal toolkit from which to develop expeditious future point-of-care diagnostics. The CRISPRDx
technologies developed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as SHERLOCK and DETECTR,

may have helped halt disease transmission had they been deployed earlier and implemented more
widely. Therefore, it is important to prepare now, well in advance of the next pandemic, by
perfecting and expanding the CRISPRDx toolkit to the bounds of its capabilities.
Complementing the rapidly expanding CRISPRDx toolkit (Fig. S1, Table S1), here we outline the
use of RfxCas13d (CasRx) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 using both synthetic targets and patient
derived samples. SENSR amplifies nucleic acid sequences through an isothermal alternative to PCR
then detects the target sequences by exploiting the native collateral cleavage activity of CasRx (Fig.
1A), providing proof-of-principle that Cas13d can be adapted as a point-of-care diagnostic. We
lend further evidence that CasRx cleavage results in activation of an off-target collateral cleavage
property (Fig. 1 E, F) 44,64, with a preference for poly-U stretches (Fig. S6A). This feature can be
harnessed to detect viral sequences in a single reaction or possibly even in a multiplexed reaction
combined with other Cas enzymes lacking a poly-U preference 23,48. We identify highly conserved
and specific targets to SARS-CoV-2 to prevent false-negatives (Fig. S4, Table S2, S3), and
demonstrate detection with attomolar sensitivity by both fluorescence and lateral flow readouts
comparable to other previously developed systems (Fig. 2C-F) 31,38,39,65. We further demonstrate
that SENSR has the potential to be so specific to SARS-CoV-2, and further prove it can be adapted
to detect vRNA in infected patient isolates (Fig. 3A-C).
SENSR provides a robust proof-of-principle of viral detection by CasRx, and as such, it should be
considered a candidate diagnostic system; however, it requires optimization in advance of
deployment. Optimizing SENSR diagnostics can be pursued through a number of avenues. While
some groups have improved specificity by selectively generating synthetic mismatches in guide
sequences 22, the gRNAs tested herein have moderate target specificity (Fig. S7). RT-RPA also
exhibits nonspecific amplification 66–68, and therefore, alternative isothermal amplification
technologies, such as RT-LAMP 41,69, could be implemented to improve specificity. Although RTLAMP is likely to improve specificity as well as sensitivity, the requirement of two separate
reactions remains problematic, increasing the likelihood of contamination due to sample transfers
70
. RT-LAMP and CasRx operate optimally at divergent temperatures (60-65℃ and 37℃,
respectively), which may be incompatible within a one-step molecular diagnostic, though advances
have been made in this sphere 33,71,72. Thus alterations to existing isothermal amplification
technologies or discovery of novel thermostable Cas nucleases with collateral cleavage activity
could facilitate a more highly-sensitive Cas-based molecular diagnostic that operates in one reaction
at a single temperature.
Beyond amplification, improvement to gRNA design criteria could drastically improve gRNA
selection for diagnosis and consequently the response time to future disease outbreaks. Currently,
there remains no robust study attempting to characterize the in vitro collateral cleavage activity for
varying Cas13 gRNA sequences, thus limiting efficient gRNA design and target selection for
Cas13-based diagnostics. In this study, we observed significant variation in gRNA collateral
cleavage activity, including two gRNAs (gRNA-AA and gRNA-AC) incapable of producing
fluorescence signal (Fig. 2A) and kinetic variation exemplified by temporal differences in
fluorescence signal accumulation for gRNA-T and gRNA-Z (Fig. 1E, F). We also observed mild
off-target activity for gRNA-Z (Fig. S7D) and found variation in reporter saturation for lateral flow
between gRNAs (Fig. 2E, F), which has been found in other systems 31,38. Understanding gRNAspecific differences of Cas13 collateral cleavage will allow the development of functional gRNA

target sequence libraries for use in future pandemics. Furthermore, robust exploration for CasRx
gRNA truncations and permutations should be undertaken to generate gRNAs intolerant of target
site polymorphisms, or to even distinguish between strains 22, thus improving the specificity of
SENSR. Optimizing workflow, deployment, and distribution, while taking steps to reduce the risk
of contamination, is imperative to develop CasRx-based diagnostics to their full potential. Although
optimization is required, we demonstrate that detection with CasRx is a promising advancement for
detecting viral infections, and could be improved to become a powerful molecular diagnostic with
numerous applications.
CasRx-based diagnostic systems may present a worthy advancement for CRISPRDx due to the
fundamental characteristics of the Cas13d family. Like LwaCas13a, Cas13d is more flexible than
most other Cas enzymes because it lacks a protospacer flanking sequence (PFS) requirement 28,44,46,
permitting targeting of any sequence without constraint. In addition, some native Cas13d systems
include a WYL1-domain-containing accessory protein, which has been demonstrated to increase
the on-target and collateral cleavage efficiency of the Cas13d effectors 46,73, suggesting potential
for future implementation. Furthermore, because they target RNA, next-generation Cas13-based
systems may be capable of direct recognition of RNA, possibly at the single molecule level, without
need for a prior reverse transcription (RT) and/or amplification step. This property could enable
direct detection of many emerging viral threats including, but not limited to; bunyaviruses 74,
zoonotic viruses such as Ebola, hanta, and Lassa 75; arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and
Zika 23,76,77, and other coronaviruses such as MERS, SARS-CoV-1, as well as those yet
undiscovered 78,79. CasRx-based diagnostics systems could detect endemic pathogens capable of
zoonotic transmission through livestock and wild animals such as influenza or other coronaviruses
78,80,81
which may have been able to prevent past pandemics 82, and avert mass herd culling resulting
in billions of dollars of losses 83,84. Beyond detection in patients and livestock, SENSR could be
adapted to detect pathogens in insect disease vectors as well as infected individuals 85, facilitating
rapid one-pot field detection of mosquito-borne pathogens in areas lacking laboratory infrastructure
86
. However, SENSR is not limited to detection of RNA species, and could also be used to detect
pathogen DNA (Fig. S8). By including an RNA polymerization step, this same technology could
be harnessed to track evidence of insecticide resistance alleles 87, released transgenic cargoes 59,60,
or the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi in a tick plucked from a hiker’s leg.
Pushing the boundaries of viral sequence recognition with CRISPR-Cas nucleases is not only of
interest for genetic engineering and diagnostics, but also for therapeutics as well. The adaptability
of CasRx RNA-targeting has recently been demonstrated to be a potentially powerful anti-COVID
therapeutic 40 as well as for other viruses 88. Together with acute diagnostics, these technologies
could promise a new mode of response to future viral outbreaks via a ‘plug-n-chug’ model, in which
complementary diagnostics and therapeutics could be systematically rolled out almost immediately
after completion of a viral genome sequence. Similar to LwaCas13a, CasRx could also be adapted
to massively multiplexed arrays to facilitate identification of viral pathogens on a large scale 37.
Establishing these tools and frameworks now, could expedite response times and help prevent
future outbreaks, avoiding the economic and health consequences which have resulted from poor
preparedness to the current pandemic.

Materials and Methods
CasRx subcloning, protein expression and purification
To produce an expression plasmid for CasRx protein production, we cloned the human codon
optimized CasRx coding sequence into the expression vector, pET-His6-MBP-TEV-yORF (Series
1-M) (purchased from QB3 MacroLab, Berkeley) using the Gibson assembly method (Gibson et
al., 2009). In brief, the CasRx coding sequence was PCR amplified from plasmid OA-1050E
(Addgene plasmid # 13241664) using primers 1136I.C1 and 1136I.C2 (Table S5). The fragment
was purified and subcloned into the restriction enzyme cutting site EcoRI, downstream of the HisMBP recombinant protein in pET-His6-MBP-TEV-yORF, generating the final pET-6xHis-MBPTEV-CasRx (OA-1136J; Addgene plasmid # 153023) plasmid.
Protein expression, culture, cell lysis, affinity and further downstream protein purification were
performed as previously described (Fig. S2) 44. In brief, to facilitate protein expression in liquid
culture, pET-His6-MBP-TEV-CasRx was transformed into Rosetta2 (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen,
71403). Starter cultures in LB were supplemented with kanamycin and chloramphenicol and
incubated at 37° C overnight. 20 mL of starter culture were used to inoculate 1L of TB media
supplemented with the same antibiotics. Cultures were allowed to grow until OD600 ~0.5, cooled
on ice, induced with 0.2 mM IPTG, and then grown for 20 hours at 18° C. Cells were then pelleted,
freeze-thawed, resuspended, lysed via sonication and clarified by centrifugation. Protein
purification was performed by gravity Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Thermo Scientific™
HisPur™ Ni-NTA Resin) followed by removal of the 6xHis-MBP tag by TEV protease
concurrently with overnight dialysis. Further purification was achieved by cation exchange using a
5-mL HiTrap SP HP using a gradient of 125 mM to 2M NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 7.5% v/v
glycerol, 1 mM DTT. The protein was finally purified by gel filtration chromatography in 50 mM
Tris-HCl, 600 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM dithiothreitol on a Superdex® 200 16/600 column.
Fractions were pooled, concentrated to ~ 2 mg/mL and stored at -80 C in the same buffer.

To detect viral genomic sequences, we designed two synthetic dsDNA gene fragments containing
a T7 promoter sequence upstream of gene segments corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 envelope
(E) and nucleocapsid (N) protein coding regions (GeneBank Accession # MN908947). The 253bp
SARS-CoV2 E-gene segment was ordered and synthesized as a custom gBlock® from Integrated
DNA Technologies (IDT) and amplified using primers 1136Q-F and 1136Q-R (Table S5). A 500bp
SARS-CoV2 N-gene segment was amplified from a plasmid 1136Y (Catalog # 10006625) 65 using
primers 1136X-F and 1136X-R (Table S5). These two SARS-CoV-2 gene targets were amplified
using PCR and then purified using the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN #28004). We also
designed eight synthetic dsDNA templates containing nucleotide variations from the native SARSCoV-2 E- and N-gene (4 synthetic targets each gene) that were used for gRNA off-target analysis
and ordered as a gBlock® from IDT. Primers 1136-OFF-F and 1136-OFF-R1~1136-OFF-R5 were
used to amplify these sequences (Table S5). The synthetic targets were chosen based on sequence
homology identified using NCBI BLAST searches against gRNA-T and gRNA-Z. 40nt regions
flanking the mismatch target sequences were included in the 5’ and 3’ ends of the 30 nt stretch in
order to allow amplification analysis via RT-RPA.
We designed gRNAs targeting the synthetic vRNA gene segments using criteria previously outlined
(Fig. S5) 64 and generated these following a previously described templateless PCR protocol 89. The
primers used to amplify these gRNAs, as well as their final sequence are outlined in Table S5. We
synthesized both the synthetic vRNA and gRNAs through in vitro transcription (IVT) using
MEGAscriptTM T7 Transcription Kit (InvitrogenTM #AM1334), followed by DNaseI digestion and
purification using the MEGAclearTM Transcription Clean-Up Kit (InvitrogenTM #AM1908).
In vitro gRNA cleavage assays
To test the in vitro cleavage efficiency of gRNAs, we performed preliminary in vitro cleavage
assays to test on-target cleavage, off-target cleavage, and collateral-cleavage properties. On-target
cleavage assays were prepared with RNA templates for E-gene (1000 ng) or N-gene (1500 ng),
followed by addition of CasRx (112 ng) and 10 ng of each gRNA in a 2:1 molar ratio. Reactions
were prepared in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.2 and 9mM MgCl2, incubated at 37℃ for one hour,
denatured at 85℃ for 10 min in 2X RNA loading dye (New England Biolabs, #B0363) and loaded
on 2% 1X TBE agarose gel stained with SYBRTM gold nucleic acid staining (Invitrogen #S11494).
Off-target cleavage assays were assembled similarly with the non-targeting synthetic vRNA
template. Collateral-cleavage assays were prepared with both synthetic vRNA templates
simultaneously and same quantities of gRNA and CasRx described above.

numbers of targeted genomes in each set. Four of six probes perfectly matched sequences in all 433
SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Two others, 1136R-E-Protein-gRNA1 and 1136S-N-Protein-gRNA1,
matched 430 and 426 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, respectively. Of 3,164 non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses,
the probes matched between 1 and 10 genomes, mostly from bat hosts (Summarized in Table S2).
To identify a comprehensive set of possible targets that are specific to SARS-CoV-2 genomes,
16,645 30 nt sequences that perfectly matched all 433 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were filtered to
remove the ones that were also found in any of the 3,164 non-SARS-CoV-2 genomes to produce a
set of 8,846 SARS-CoV-2-specific sequences (Table S4). To check for possible cross-reactivity
with human transcripts, the probes were mapped to the human transcriptome (GRCh38, ENSEMBL
release 99, ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/fasta/homo_sapiens/) comprising both coding and
non-coding RNAs using bowtie 1.2.3 allowing up to two mismatches (-v 2). None of the 8,846
sequences mapped to the human transcriptome to confirm their specificity to SARS-CoV-2. To
visualize the distribution of the specific targets along the SARS-CoV-2 genome, probe density was
calculated using a sliding window of 301 nt for each position of the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome
NC_045512 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512) and plotted in R (Fig. S3). Viral
genes that are affected by each probe were identified using the intersect function of bedtools (Table
S3).
RT-RPA amplification of viral genomic sequences
Prior to all detection assays a pre-amplification step using RT-RPA was performed in order to
amplify the SARS-CoV-2 target sequence. These protocols were initially developed and optimized
on mock viral genome fragments and later validated against patient samples. To amplify the target
sequences from the synthetic vRNA, we performed RT-RPA 38 (protocol summarized in Fig. S3).
In short, RT-RPA primers were designed to amplify 30 nt gRNA spacer regions flanked by 30 nt
priming regions from the synthetic vRNA template while also incorporating a T7 promoter
sequence into the 5’ end of the dsDNA gene fragment with +2 G’s thus increasing transcription
efficiency (Fig. 1B) 90. RT-RPA was performed at 42℃ for 45 min by combining M-MuLV-RT
(NEB #M0253L) with TwistAmp® Basic (TwistDx #TABAS03KIT). All RT-RPA primer
sequences can be found in Table S1.
Fluorescence-based detection of SARS-CoV-2
For fluorescence-based detection, we developed a simple in vitro transcription-coupled cleavage
assay with a fluorescence readout using 6-Carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) as our fluorescent marker.
To facilitate fluorescence detection, we developed a 6 nt poly-U probe conjugated to a 5’-6-FAM
and a 3’-IABlkFQ (FRU, Table S5) and custom ordered from IDT. In total volumes of 15𝜇L, the
following reaction mix was prepared; 5.62𝜇L water, 0.4𝜇L HEPES, pH 7.2 (1M), 0.18𝜇L MgCl2
(1M), 3.2𝜇L rNTPs (25mM each), 2𝜇L CasRx (55.4 ng/𝜇L), 1𝜇L RNase inhibitor (40U/𝜇L), 0.6𝜇L
T7 Polymerase (50U/𝜇L), 1 𝜇L gRNA (10 ng/𝜇L), and 1𝜇L FRU probe (2uM). This was followed
by the addition of 5𝜇L (50% amplification vol) of the amplified target RNA from the RT-RPA preamplification mix (described above) or no-template control, which initiates the reaction following
incubation at 37℃ for 90 min. Experiments were immediately run on a LightCycler® 96 (Roche
#05815916001) at 37℃ under 5 sec acquisition followed by 5 sec incubation for the first 15 min,
followed by 5 sec acquisition and 55 sec incubation for up to 75 min. Fluorescence readouts were
analyzed over-time by normalization to templateless controls at each respective time point or
through background subtracted fluorescence by subtracting the initial fluorescence value from the
final value.

Lateral Flow-based detection of SARS-CoV-2
For lateral flow-based detection we modified the HybriDetect® system to detect the presence of
SARS-CoV-2 sequences using SENSR 38. In brief, we designed a ssRNA probe composed of a 6 nt
poly-U probe conjugated on opposite ends with a 5’-6-FAM and a 3’-biotin which was custom
ordered from IDT (LFRU, Table S5). Following incubation of 5.22𝜇L water, 0.4𝜇L HEPES, pH
7.2 (1M), 0.18𝜇L MgCl2 (1M), 2𝜇L CasRx (55.4ng/𝜇L), 1𝜇L gRNA (10 ng/𝜇L), 5𝜇L RT-RPA
reaction mix, 1𝜇L T7 polymerase (50 U/mL), 3.2𝜇L rNTPs (25mM each), 1𝜇L LFRU probe (20
uM), at 37℃ for 60 min. 80𝜇L of HybriDetect Assay buffer was added to each reaction and mixed
thoroughly. Next, the lateral flow dipstick was placed into the reaction and allowed to flow upwards
by capillary action for a maximum of 2 min. The presence or absence of upper or lower bands was
analyzed to detect evidence of SARS-CoV-2 by collateral cleavage. The presence of a solitary upper
band or both an upper and lower band indicates a positive result, a solitary lower band with a faint
upper band was interpreted as a negative result.
Patient samples ethics statement
Human samples from patients were collected under University of California San Diego’s Human
Research Protection Program protocol number 200470 for negatives (PI: Lauge Farnaes), and under
a waiver of consent from clinical samples from San Diego County for positives (PI: Kristian
Andersen), as part of the SEARCH Alliance activities. Samples were de-identified as required by
these protocols prior to testing and analysis under University of California San Diego Biological
Use Authorization protocols R1806 and 2401.
RNA extraction and processing of patient samples
Patient nasopharyngeal samples were collected and RNA was extracted using Omega Bio-Tek
Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA 96 Kit (Omega Cat. No. M6246-03), following the manufacturer's
protocol for KingFisher Flex platform.
RT-qPCR validation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patient samples
Patient samples were determined to be SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative TaqPath™ COVID-19
Combo Kit RT-qPCR assay as described in (https://www.fda.gov/media/136112/download), and
reducing the RT-qPCR reaction volumes to 3µl and diluting the MS2 phage control to improve the
limit of detection of the assay. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was analyzed using
primers targeting the N, S, and Orf1ab genes with an MS2 control. All RT-qPCR assays were run
using TaqPathTM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix (ThermoFisher #A15299) and thermocycling
conditions
were
run
following
the
CDC
recommended
protocol
(https://www.fda.gov/media/136112/download). Fluorescence data were acquired on a
QuantStudio 5 qPCR machine (Applied Biosystems).
SENSR detection of patient samples
To detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples using SENSR, we tested this system
against RT-qPCR validated samples. We obtained SARS-CoV-2 positive (N=21) and negative
(N=21) samples and ran fluorescence analysis of these samples in triplicate. Samples were subject
to preamplification using RT-RPA and incubated in an IVT-coupled cleavage reaction, as
previously described. Data for analysis were acquired on LightCycler® 96 (Roche #05815916001)
following the protocol previously described. We processed the data by generating background

subtracted fluorescence data for each replicate by subtracting the final (90 min) fluorescence value
from the initial (0 min) fluorescence value. Noise was set as the average of the three no-template
control (NTC) background subtracted values. S/N was then calculated by dividing the background
subtracted value for each replicate by the noise. The S/N for each sample was then determined by
taking the average of the three independent S/N ratios in the triplicates. Samples were determined
to be positive if S/N > 2 and negative if S/N < 2. Lateral flow analysis was run on samples that
were determined as positives from the SENSR fluorescence analysis. The samples were assayed
and analyzed following the previously described lateral flow methods and images were taken using
a smartphone. Positives and negatives were determined in comparison to the NTC samples and
using a positive control (synthetic template) as a standard.

Supplementary Figure 1. Summary of current CRISPR-based anti-Covid technologies organized by
Cas enzyme used and by role as diagnostic or detection tool, or as a putative prophylactic. Those
technologies shown in black font have been demonstrated to have explicit activity against SARS-CoV-2,
while those technologies shown in grey font have been publicly discussed or proposed to be technological
candidates for SARS-CoV-2 detection or prophylaxis, however have not yet been fully
demonstrated/optimized for said purpose as of the publication of this manuscript. Some technologies have
not yet been given a formal name by their authors, and are therefore denoted as ‘unnamed’ followed by the
acronym for the primary institutional affiliation behind the work. To better identify and distinguish these
technologies, the DOI has been provided. [Diagnostics/detection systems/Mass testing] For all
technologies viral RNA is extracted, reverse transcribed into cDNA, followed by template amplification by

either PCR, RPA or LAMP, then input into subsequent reactions with the exception of CRISPR-Chip which
does not require an amplification step. Cas12-based enzymes, as well as many other Cas proteins (including
Cas9) recognize DNA species, while Cas13-based enzymes recognize ssRNA, and all can be used to detect
evidence of specific sequences by fluorescence or lateral flow. The detection method for each technology
is noted with the presence of an icon adjacent. The majority of the technologies summarized here use
fluorescence or lateral flow or both. The lime glow icon indicates readout by fluorescence, while the grey
bar indicates read-out by lateral flow. Some of the other technologies can be read out by different detection
methods. Notably because FELUDA relies on direct sequence cleavage, and not the collateral cleavage
property shared amongst the Cas12- and Cas13-based technologies, it can also be analyzed by gel
electrophoresis as evidence of distinct band cleavage (aqua gel icon). Also, CRISPR-Chip has been
discussed as a SARS-CoV-2 mass detection candidate, though these findings have not yet been made
publicly available. Read-out by this technology is achieved via a graphene-based transistor (icon is red,
grey with graphene structure adjacent). Other different technologies include CREST, which achieves
detection via fluorescence using a distinctly do-it-yourself (DIY) BioHacking approach, by utilizing
equipment easily procured and operated by novice scientists, as well as CARMEN-Cas13 which detects
evidence of SARS-CoV-2 sequences by microarray. The technology outlined here is an addition to current
SHERLOCK detection utilizing Cas13d (CasRx). The technical details of most technologies is summarized
in Table S1.

Supplementary Figure 2. CasRx protein purification workflow and quality control. [A] CasRx protein
was produced and purified essentially as described in (Konermann et al. 2018). A CasRx protein-expression
plasmid was generated with CasRx (pink) downstream of a Maltose-binding protein (MBP, purple) domain
with an N-terminal 6xHis tag (blue), connected by a TEV protease cleavage sequence (green). Origin of
replication and KanR cassette shown in navy. Transformation of the plasmid into Rosetta2TM (DE3)
Competent E. coli was followed by large scale culture growth. Cell lysate supernatant containing 6xHisMBP-CasRx soluble hybrid protein was run on a Ni-NTA column for purification by affinity
chromatography. CasRx protein was then released from the 6xHis-MBP moiety by TEV protease cleavage
during O/N dialysis, and was further purified by cation exchange and size exclusion using Fast Protein
Liquid Chromatography (FPLC). [B] The cation exchange elution profile of CasRx with the concentration

into the two base component reactions, RT-RPA or IVT + cleavage. [Panel 1A] Viral ssRNA is extracted
and reverse transcribed into cDNA. A fragment of the viral E-gene ssRNA (navy), with the final CasRx
target site highlighted (mint). Reverse transcriptase (raspberry) actively reverse transcribes the viral
template into cDNA. [Panel 2A] In the simultaneous RPA reaction, recombinase (brown) binds to the
primer (red and orange) with D-loops formed at binding sites. [2B] Recombinase helps anneal the primer
to the target site, and single strand binding protein (SSB, teal) begins annealing to ssDNA to stabilize the
strand and reaction. [Panel 3A] Strand-displacing DNA polymerase (grey) amplifies the target DNA, with
continued binding of SSB to ssDNA for stabilization. [Panel 4A] DNA amplicon extension is completed,
[4B] while polymerase simultaneously dislodges SSB, and [4C] the T7 promoter region (orange) is added
to the amplicon via primer extension. [Panel 5] The final product of the RT-RPA reaction is a small
amplified fragment of target DNA encompassing the CasRx target site, with a T7 promoter added for
subsequent IVT. [Panel 6A] T7 RNA polymerase-based in vitro transcription (blue) occurs, initiated from
the T7 promoter (orange) in order to generate ssRNA (magenta) required as the activation substrate of
CasRx. [6B] Elongation of the ssRNA template takes place. [Panel 7] CasRx detection of on-target
sequence, activation of collateral cleavage activity, and detection. [7A] The CasRx/gRNA complex (pink
and green) recognize, [7B] bind to, and cleave (red scissors) the ssRNA viral target template (magenta).
[7C] This action activates the collateral cleavage property of CasRx (gold, black scissors). [7D] Following
activation, collateral cleavage of an included small ssRNA probe can be analyzed via [7E] fluorescence or
lateral flow assay.

Supplementary Figure 6. Optimizing SENSR Fluorescence detection assay. [A] Determining optimal
sequence for collateral cleavage probe. Collateral cleavage of Poly-A probe is tested in the first group, PolyU is tested in the second, and RNase Alert in the third group. Within each group, gRNA-T and gRNA-Z
are incubated in a reaction saturated with 10,000 (10k) target copies, or 0 (Neg Ctrl) as a negative control.
Performing a two-tailed t-test of unequal variance comparing each 10k group to the respective Neg Ctrl
groups a significant increase in fluorescence was only found for the Poly-U probe 10k groups (gRNA-T
10k: p<0.0001, gRNA-Z 10k: p<0.0001). No significant increase in fluorescence was observed for the 10k
Poly-A or 10k RNase Alert groups compared to the respective Neg Ctrl groups for gRNA-T (Poly-A:
p=0.5953, RNase Alert: p=0.4294) or gRNA-Z (Poly-A: p=0.7935, RNase Alert: p=0.1510). Performing a
one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s test comparing the 10k groups of the Poly-A and RNase Alert
groups to the 10k Poly-U groups a significant difference was found for both gRNA-T (Poly-A: p<0.0001,
RNase Alert: p<0.0001) and gRNA-Z (Poly-A: p<0.0001, RNase Alert: p<0.0001). Bars indicate mean ±
SD of background subtracted fluorescence from three technical replicates. [B] Determining the optimal
input volume of RT-RPA sample into SENSR reaction. In all cases the trial sample is equivalent to 100
copies/𝜇L (blue), the positive control is established with 10,000/𝜇L (dark grey), and the negative control is
no-template control (pale grey). In the left most grouping the RT-RPA template sample input into the
SENSR reaction comprises 10% of the preamplification reaction, in the middle grouping it composes 20%
of the preamplification reaction, and in the final grouping it comprises 50% of the preamplification reaction.
Performing a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s test within each % input group significance was
only found for both the sample (p<0.0001) and positive control (p<0.0001) in the 50% group (10%: Sample
- p= 0.8925, Pos Ctrl - p<0.0001; 20%: Sample - p=0.8160, Pos Ctrl - p<0.0001). Performing a second oneway ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s test comparing the 50% sample group to the 10% and 20% sample
groups, a significant increase in fluorescence was observed (10%: p<0.0001, 20%: p<0.0001). Bars indicate
mean ± SD of background subtracted fluorescence from three technical replicates.

Supplementary Figure 7. Assessment of gRNA specificity within the SENSR system. Schematic
representation of gRNA mismatches for the four most closely related sequences (off-targets, OT1-OT4)
identified via BLAST for [A] gRNA-T and [B] gRNA-Z. [C] gRNA-T demonstrated no off-target activity
on the 4 closely related sequences. Bars indicate mean ± SD of background subtracted fluorescence from
three technical replicates. Performing a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s test comparing to the
NTC fluorescence signal was found to be significant for the E-gene compared (p<0.0001), however no
significant fluorescence signal increase was found for the four off-targets (OT1: p=0.9998, OT2: p=0.5242,
OT3: p=0.6633, OT4: p=0.8475). Performing a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s test comparing
to the E-gene positive control significant fluorescence signal increase was found when targeting the E-gene
compared to the four off-targets (OT1, OT2, OT3, OT4: p<0.0001). [D] Collateral cleavage was observed
for two of the closely related off-targets for gRNA-Z . Bars indicate mean ± SD of background subtracted
fluorescence from three technical replicates. Performing a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s test
comparing to the NTC fluorescence signal increase was found to be significant for the N-gene positive
control, OT1, and OT2 (N, OT1, OT2: p<0.0001), however no significant fluorescence signal increase was
found for OT3 and OT4 (OT3: p=0.8877, OT4: p>0.9999). Performing a one-way ANOVA followed by a
Dunnett’s test comparing to the N-gene positive control, significant fluorescence signal increase was found
to when targeting the N-gene compared to OT3 and OT4 (OT3, OT4: p<0.0001), but no significant
difference was found targeting the N-gene compared to OT1 and OT2 (OT1: p=0.0786, OT2: p=0.0833).

Supplementary Figure 8. In addition to RNA-based templates (top row), SENSR technology could also
be used for DNA-based templates, including, but not limited to, bacterial samples (shown) as well as DNA
viruses such as herpes (shown, bottom, navy). DNA-based sample templates can be input directly into the
RPA amplification reaction, negating the need for a simultaneous reverse transcription (RT) reaction as is
required for RNA-based templates. Like SENSR on RNA-based templates, the reaction occurs in two steps.
The first amplification step, RT-RPA or RPA, is followed by the SENSR reaction which is identical
regardless of initial input molecular species. This reaction is composed of simultaneous in vitro
transcription (IVT) as well as CasRx cleavage and activation of collateral cleavage activity. The assay can
be read out by fluorescence or lateral flow in the same fashion regardless of DNA or RNA sample input.
