Abstract
Background: Numerous clinical studies are now underway investigating aspects of COVID19. The aim of this study was to identify a selection of national and/or multicentre clinical
COVID-19 studies in the United Kingdom to examine the feasibility and outcomes of
documenting the most frequent data elements common across studies to rapidly inform future
study design and demonstrate proof-of-concept for further subject-specific study data element
mapping to improve research data management.
Methods: 25 COVID-19 studies were included. For each, information regarding the specific
data elements being collected was recorded. Data elements collated were arbitrarily divided
into categories for ease of visualisation. Elements which were most frequently and consistently
recorded across studies are presented in relation to their relative commonality.
Results: Across the 25 studies, 261 data elements were recorded in total. The most frequently
recorded 100 data elements were identified across all studies and are presented with relative
frequencies. Categories with the largest numbers of common elements included demographics,
admission criteria, medical history and investigations. Mortality and need for specific
respiratory support were the most common outcome measures, but with specific studies
including a range of other outcome measures.
Conclusion: The findings of this study have demonstrated that it is feasible to collate specific
data elements recorded across a range of studies investigating a specific clinical condition in
order to identify those elements which are most common among studies. These data may be of
value for those establishing new studies and to allow researchers to rapidly identify studies
collecting data of potential use hence minimising duplication and increasing data re-use and
interoperability

Introduction
Since the development of the global COVID-19 emergency in early 2020, more than 2000
clinical studies have now been registered investigating various aspects of the disease.1 Ideally,
all of these studies would learn from each other, use common data standards, definitions and
formats and allow maximum interoperability and data pooling. In addition, for new studies
being instituted to address specific aspects of COVID-19 or specific interventions, the data
elements collected would ‘reuse’ existing data element components from existing studies, only
adding specific additional variables where required. In practice, in part due to the rapidity of
their inception and development, and in part due to longstanding cultural habits, it is likely that
most studies continue to be established ‘de-novo’ with little focus on data reuse and
interoperability, these being considered secondarily once data collection is complete.
The aim of this study was to identify a small selection of major national and/or
multicentre clinical COVID-19 studies in the United Kingdom to examine the feasibility and
outcomes of documenting specific data elements being collected, in order to identify the most
frequent data elements common across studies to provide an evidence-based list of relatively
ranked elements which may inform future study design. In addition, these findings could act
as a proof-of-concept for further subject-specific study data element mapping more widely
across the healthcare landscape as a contributing factor to improve research data design and
management and support FAIR data.2,3

Methods
We selected 25 major studies for inclusion, representing a cross-section of large multicentre
and/or National studies set up in the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United
Kingdom.4–7891011–13141516171819202122–242526 There was no attempt to identify specific COVID-19
disease areas but studies were selected to include the major studies documented on the UK
National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and Health Research Authority (HRA) websites
during April 2020.
For each study, either the specific study website, (if available), or study information
available from other sources such as trial registers, were accessed in order to identify the
specific data elements being collected in the study. This information was either available from
dedicated study data element data documentation in association with data dictionaries and
coding schemes used, directly from the study specific eCRF (electronic case report forms), or
from study protocols where neither of the previous sources were available. We arbitrarily

started by mapping data elements from the UK CHESS study,4 recording the data elements,
definitions if available and any specific comments. Following this, data elements from
additional studies were manually recorded, either aligning to the pre-existing list where
appropriate, or adding new elements where required. Data elements collated were arbitrarily
divided into categories, such as demographics, investigations, medical history for ease of
visualisation and discussion. For some elements subjective judgement was required, for
example some studies may have included an element as an inclusion or exclusion criteria but
not explicitly documented this in the eCRF.
Following the recording and collation of elements across all studies, the elements from
categories which were most frequently and consistently recorded across studies were presented
in list form and using sunburst and treemap charts in order to visually present the major data
elements in relation to their relative commonality. Analysis was performed using Microsoft
Excel (Microsoft Corp, Seattle). Research ethics committee approval was not required for this
work.

Results
Across the 25 studies, 261 data elements were recorded in total. The most frequently recorded
100 data elements were identified across all studies and are provided in Table 1 and Figures 1
and 2, with relative frequencies in terms of proportion of studies collecting such data element.
The groups with the largest numbers of common elements included demographics, admission
criteria, medical history and investigations. Mortality and need for specific respiratory support
were the most common outcome measures, but with specific studies including a range of other
outcome measures such as length of stay, oxygen requirements etc. Given that many studies
were investigating specific interventions or treatments, these of course would be highly
relevant to the specific study but unlikely to be common across many studies, hence are not
listed here.

Discussion
The findings of this study have demonstrated that it is feasible to collate specific data elements
recorded across a range of studies investigating a specific clinical condition in order to identify
those elements which are likely to be common among studies, regardless of the specific
intervention or treatment which is being evaluated. In the case of COVID-19, these data may
be of value for those establishing new studies, since a common set of study data elements can

be rapidly developed and only highly study-specific additional data elements require addition.
Furthermore, if such information were available for all recorded studies across a given clinical
area, for example all of the 2000+ COVID-19 studies now in progress, an evolving set of core
data elements would continually be available to both inform future study design but also allow
researchers to rapidly identify other studies which may be collecting specific data of potemtial
use to address a particular clinical question, and reduce the need for duplication of multiple
studies collecting similar information.
The approach and data presented here represents an initial proof of concept, and ideally
could be expanded by each specific data element being associated with reference to welldefined data dictionaries and associated clinical coding systems, such as SNOMED CT, in
order to further improve reproducibility interoperability of data. For the purposes of the current
study, data element mapping has been performed but with no attempt to evaluate the underlying
definitions or vocabularies used to assign entry or inclusion for a particular data element.
However, if in a particular disease area, there was the facility to develop up-to-date data
element maps with links to appropriate definitions and terminologies and ontologies, this could
significantly contribute to improve standardisation of data management within a specialty. In
addition, in the present study no attempt was made to evaluate the underlying data model or
format, but inclusion of such data if it were widely available may further improve subsequent
data interoperability by providing both core data elements and underlying common data models
and structures for re-use.
The main limitations of the study are that the trials and studies included represent only
a small proportion of the total registered COVID-19 studies. Nevertheless, several major large
UK studies are included representing a range of COVID-19 trials, and the intention of the
current work was to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and to rapidly identify the
major common data elements among studies investigating COVID-19. In addition, these
present data have been derived from interpretation of study protocols and eCRF documentation
where formal lists of data elements were not provided, therefore it is likely that some elements
have been subjectively categorised. Ideally, strict definitions are provided for each data element
with clear links to open data dictionaries, but this was rarely the case. Furthermore, the vast
majority of the studies included did not provide easily accessible lists of data elements along
with their definitions and terminologies, meaning that some subjective interpretation was often
required in terms of the specific element usage. The majority of the studies were also
associated with their own eCRF, which illustrates the issue that if many studies are underway
concurrently in a similar disease area and are requiring a subset of common data elements it is

highly inefficient to have multiple individual eCRF instances, most of which would usually
require manual data entry of some kind. A far more efficient approach would be to collect the
common data elements through existing routine hospital information systems, but in general
this approach is only used by a small minority of clinical studies in general.27
It should be emphasised that these findings are not intended to represent either a
suggested common dataset or outcomes set, but merely aim to present data regarding which
data elements are most common across a selection of COVID-19 studies. Indeed, for particular
purposes, expert groups establishing common outcome measures in relation to COVID-19 and
other diseases are underway (and indeed some of the common outcome sets included here).28
Whilst the findings presented are however, intended to be used as a general guide for
researchers and those developing future COVID-19 studies, details for specific studies should
be obtained directly from the source reference. Finally, the data presented here represent an
initial group of studies investigating COVID-19, as a proof of principal in relation to the
opportunity of a novel disease pandemic, requiring a rapid number of clinical studies to be set
up investigating common condition. Despite the current emphasis on COVID-19, large
numbers of studies are underway across all areas of medicine, and the principles illustrated
would provide even greater value for the large number of studies investigating common
conditions such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. The establishment of systems in which
all clinical studies investigating a particular condition or within a specific domain would be
required to define their data elements, and record such elements using well described standards
with the aggregated data available in an open platform, would provide an invaluable resource
for research planning and would significantly contribute to improved research data
management and the facilitation of true FAIR data.2
