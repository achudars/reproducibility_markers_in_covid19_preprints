Background: Estimates from initial SARS-CoV-2 serological surveys were likely to be biased due to convenience sampling whereas large-scale populationbased serosurveys could be biased due to non-response. This study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Saint Petersburg, Russia
accounting for non-response bias.
Methods: We recruited a random sample of adults residing in St. Petersburg with random digit dialling. Computer-assisted telephone interview was followed by
an invitation for an antibody test with randomized rewards for participation. Blood samples collected between May 27, 2020 and June 26, 2020 were assessed
for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two tests — CMIA and ELISA. The seroprevalence estimates were corrected for non-response bias, test sensitivity, and
specificity. Individual characteristics associated with seropositivity were assessed.
Findings: 66,250 individuals were contacted, 6,440 adults agreed to be interviewed and were invited to participate in the serosurvey. Blood samples were
obtained from 1038 participants. Naïve seroprevalence corrected for test characteristics was 9.0% [95% CI 7.2–10.8] by CMIA and 10.8% [8.8–12.7] by ELISA.
Correction for non-response bias decreased seroprevalence estimates to 7.4% [5.7–9.2] for CMIA and to 9.3% [7.4–11.2] for ELISA. The most pronounced
decrease in non-response bias-corrected seroprevalence was attributed to the history of any illnesses in the past 3 months and COVID-19 testing. Besides that
seroconversion was negatively associated with smoking status, self-reported history of allergies and changes in hand-washing habits.
Interpretation: These results suggest that even low estimates of seroprevalence in Europe‘s fourth-largest city can be an overestimation in the presence of
non-response bias. Serosurvey design should attempt to identify characteristics that are associated both with participation and seropositivity. Further populationbased studies are required to explain the lower seroprevalence in smokers and participant reporting allergies.

Introduction
Serological surveys in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic address the issue of underestimation of the number of cases registered
officially with RT-PCR using material from nasopharyngeal swabs [1; 2]. They use blood antibody tests that are markers of
past infection. WHO recommends serological surveys to monitor COVID-19 spread [3]. However, estimates from serological
surveys can be also biased. Estimates can be distorted by non-response bias, non-representativeness of the study sample, and
imperfect test characteristics. Previous serological surveys so far have all but focused on the former [4–10]. This poses a
significant problem when some observed factors that influence the decision to participate in the survey may be also associated
with test results [11]. Non-response or self-selection bias has been widely acknowledged in descriptive epidemiology [12–15].
In particular, it has been predominantly addressed in seroprevalence surveys of HIV [16].
In this paper we present seroprevalence estimates coming from the first cross-sectional data of our longitudinal study with
serial sampling to assess the spread COVID-19 in Saint Petersburg, Russia conducted between May 27 and June 26 2020. St.
Petersburg is the second largest city in the country and fourth largest in Europe with the population of approximately 5.2 mln.
The first case in the city was registered on 5 March, 2020 and 36,667 cases (7.1 per 1000) were reported as of 31 August, 2020.
The study of the spread of COVID-19 in St. Petersburg was established to estimate the extent of epidemic in a population-based

manner, and, to the best of our knowledge, this was the first COVID-19 serological survey in the country. Our primary aim
was to compare naïve and non-response bias-adjusted seroprevalence to show the utmost importance of rigorous serosurvey
designs. We report how various observable characteristics of individuals shift the naïve prevalence estimates when accounted
for and carefully address possible sources of bias. Finally, we provide observable characteristics of surveyed individuals that
are associated with risk of seroconversion in a population-based study.

Methods
Study design and participants
The St. Petersburg COVID-19 study is a population-based epidemiological survey of random sample from the adult population
to assess the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The study is conducted as a longitudinal study with serial sampling
from the same individuals. The study involved one phone-based survey followed by an individual invitation to the clinic, one
paper-based survey, and blood sample collection for antibody testing. Interviews were carried out between May 21, 2020 and
June 25, 2020. Blood samples were collected between May 27, 2020 and June 26, 2020.
Eligible individuals were adults residing in St. Petersburg older than 18 years and recruited using the random digit dialling
(RDD) method. RDD was accompanied by the computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) in order to collect information
on both individuals who accepted and declined invitation for testing. Residents of St. Petersburg are almost universal mobile
phone users, with 99.5% of households having mobile phones as of 2016 (see Supplementary Appendix Table A3). Participants
from six distant districts of the city located too far away from the test site were excluded leaving 12 central districts of the city
with population of approximately 4.3 mln. The full study protocol is available online (https://eusp.org/sites/default/
files/inline-files/EU_SG-Russian-Covid-Serosurvey-Protocol-CDRU-001_en.pdf).
Procedures
RDD was carried out using area prefixes of mobile phone numbers to include only mobile phone users in St. Petersburg. The
individuals who had answered the call were asked to answer 25 questions on demographics, marital status, education level,
income level, past history of illnesses, travelling abroad, household size, social contacts, and visits to public places during
lockdown (see full questionnaire in the study protocol). Refusal to participate in blood sampling was also recorded. We have
also randomly incentivized respondents to participate in the study by offering complimentary taxi transit to and from the clinic
test site for approximately 25% of those who agreed to go through CATI.
Those who had agreed to take part in antibody testing were later contacted by the clinic call center and were assigned an
appointment date for blood sampling. The participants signed consent forms and filled out additional paper-based survey forms
in the clinic on the day of the visit. Forms included question on the medical history, history of allergies, smoking, alcohol
consumption, chronic diseases and medication taken regularly. Blood sampling started on May 27, 2020 and was planned for
two weeks but was prolonged till June 26, 2020 because of low participation rates.
Laboratory tests
We assessed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two tests. Serum samples were tested using chemiluminescent microparticle
immunoassay (CMIA) Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG on the Abbott ARCHITECT® i2000sr platform (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, USA) that detects immunoglobulin class G (IgG) antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (cutoff
for positivity 1.4). In addition to that blood samples were also tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using
CoronaPass total antibodies test (Genetico, Moscow, Russia) that detects total antibodies (cutoff for positivity 1.0) and is based
on recombinant receptor binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA). We simultaneously report seroprevalence based on CMIA and ELISA.
Sample size
Initial sample size of 1550 participants was calculated assuming prevalence of 20% and test sensitivity (100%) and specificity (99.6%) for our CMIA test with sampling error was 2% using a 95% confidence interval (see Supplementary Appendix
Figure A1).[17] After receiving the preliminary results (for 500 individuals), we reduced the sample size by assuming 10%
prevalence that gave us a target sample size of 882 participants, that was rounded to 1000 participants.
Statistical analysis
The primary aim of the study was to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in serum samples based on CMIA
tests and ELISA tests accounting for non-response bias and test characteristics (sensitivity and specificity). Seroprevalence
was defined as the proportion of those tested positive to all participants. Non-response was assessed by comparison of answers
provided during the CATI by those visited the test site and all other surveyed.
To understand the direction of non-response bias in our data we estimated a binomial probit regression of individual agreement to participate in the study and offer his/her blood sample on observable characteristics. We used this fitted model to

compute conditional probability to participate in the study (holding all but one variable at mean levels at a time). Our bivariate
probit model is formally introduced in Statistical Appendix App. 1).
We analyse variables obtained from CATI and the clinic paper-based survey (ordered or unordered factor variables), and
results of antibody tests (binary variables). Participant age was split into groups (18–34, 35–49, 50–64, or ≥65 years old).
In the secondary analyses we also assessed seroprevalence by week based on the date of interview and the date of blood
sampling. In subgroup analysis we first compared seroprevalence estimates corrected for non-response between different groups
of individuals based on their answers in CATI. To explore individual risk factors for test positivity and obtain prevalence
ratios we estimated a generalised linear model with Poisson distribution and a log link restricted to data from participants
who completed clinic paper-based survey. We have entertained the possibility to use robust variance-covariance matrix in
our adjusted prevalence ratio analysis. However, such adjustment narrowed the confidence intervals rendering our adjusted
estimates less conservative [18]. For this reason we report confidence intervals from the unadjusted variance-covariance matrix.
In sensitivity analysis we explored how inclusion of different sets of observable characteristics of individuals (namely, travel
history, face mask use, public transport use, visits to public places and others) in the model that corrected seroprevalence for
non-response influenced the results. We also applied alternative definitions of seroprevalence (test combination either favouring
sensitivity or specificity). To account for possible sample non-representativeness in sensitivity analysis we computed raking
weights to match the survey age group and educational attainment proportions in 2016 representative survey of adult city
population (see Supplementary Appendix Table A3 for description of this survey and the target proportions). R package anesrake
was used to compute the weights [19]. We then estimated seroprevalence on re-weighted data.
We treated refusals to answer certain phone or paper-based survey questions as missing data, for this reason the results
onwards are considered after listwise deletion of observations with missing variables.
All reported seroprevalence results were also corrected for test characteristics using the manufacturer’s validation data —
sensitivity (100% and 98.7%) and specificity (99.6% and 100%) for CMIA and ELISA test, respectively [20]. Standard errors
were computed with delta method. Detailed description of statistical analysis is provided in Statistical Appendix App. 1).
Data sharing
All analyses were conducted in R with the aid of GJRM package [21], study data and code is available online (https://
github.com/eusporg/spb_covid_study20).
Ethical considerations and study registration
The study was approved by the Research Planning Board of European University at St. Petersburg (on May 20, 2020) and
the Ethic Committee of the Clinic “Scandinavia” (on May 26, 2020). The study was registered with the following identifiers:
NCT04406038 and ISRCTN11060415.

Results
Participation rates. Between May 21 and June 25, 2020 66,250 individuals were reached using RDD. Of 13,071 respondents

agreed to participate in the CATI 6,671 were excluded for various reasons (see Figure 1). The resulting 6,400 individuals
responded to CATI questionnaire (see Supplementary Appendix Table A2 for details regarding missing records on variables of
interest). The respondents were representative of the city population in terms of their gender, employment status, and household size, but were younger than the adult city population as of 2016 and had higher levels of educational attainment (see
Supplementary Appendix Table A3).
3,390 of surveyed individuals agreed to receive a phone call from the clinic and schedule a visit for antibody testing. Between
May 27 and June 26, 2020 only 1038 individuals that satisfied eligibility criteria visited the clinic and provided blood samples
(16.2% and 30.6% of those who were interviewed and agreed to participate in serosurvey, respectively). The rest declined the
invitation or did not show up at the test site. 1038 CMIA tests and 1035 ELISA tests were eventually performed on eligible
individuals. The clinic-visiting participants have also filled out 965 clinic paper-based survey forms.
652 (62.8%) of 1,038 participants were women; 396 (38.2%) were aged 18-34 years, 357 (34.4%) were aged 35-49 years,
218 (21.0%) were aged 50-64 years, and 67 (6.5%) were older than 65 years, the majority of participants lived in multipleperson households, 843 (81.2%) (see Supplementary Appendix Table A2 for summary statistics on phone survey respondents
and tested individuals).
In the course of the study we observed the gradual attrition of participants. Compared with the individuals who limited their
participation to the CATI, participants who took part in antibody testing were younger, more likely to be female, report a higher
education level, experience illnesses in the previous 3 months, report a history of previous COVID-19 testing and a change in
their hand-washing habits during the epidemic. Our attempt to randomly incentivize respondents to take part in the study by
offering taxi did not reach its purpose. (see Supplementary Appendix Figure A2a).

Seroprevalence estimates. Between May 27 and June 26, 2020, 115 positive results were reported by any test (97 positive
tests out of 1038 were reported by CMIA and 107 positive tests out of 1035 were reported by ELISA). 30 of these 115 (26.1%)
individuals with any positive test result did not report any symptoms of past illnesses in the previous 3 months. Naïve seroprevalence corrected for test specificity and sensitivity was 9.0% (95% CI 7.2–10.8) by CMIA and 10.8% (8.8– 12.7) by ELISA (see
Table 1). When we accounted for non-response bias with respect to demographic and socioeconomic characteristics our seroprevalence point estimates did not change considerably. Inclusion of characteristics associated with seroprevalence as regressors
in our single imputation model shifted point estimates of seroprevalence downwards and after adjustment for all aforementioned
characteristics in the model seroprevalence was 7.4% (95% CI 5.7–9.2) for CMIA and to 9.3% (7.4–11.2) for ELISA.
Secondary subgroup analysis. Seroprevalence was similar between men and women and was slightly lower in the older (65+)

age group (see Table 2). The seroprevalence was higher for individuals who reported past history of illnesses — (15.1% (95%
CI 11.6–18.6) for CMIA and 20.0% (95% CI 14.8–25.2) for ELISA) compared to those who did not (3.8% (95% CI 2.1–5.5 for
CMIA and 7.4% (95% CI 5.4–9.3 for ELISA). It was also higher for individuals who reported past history of COVID-19 tests,
but was slightly lower in individuals who reported that they started washing hands more often since the onset of pandemic and
lived alone. There was noticeable variation in seropositivity between city districts (see Figure 2).
We observed a slight increase in seroprevalence by the week of the phone interview (see Figure 3a) and by the week of the
blood draw (see Figure 3b).
Our secondary analysis of participants who filled out clinic paper-based survey forms revealed additional covariates associated with seroconversion. It was negatively associated with smoking status with prevalence ratios 0.46 (95%CI 0.22-0.87) and
0.34 (95%CI 0.14-0.72) (PR for current smokers vs non-smokers based on CMIA and ELISA, respectively), and self-reported
history of allergies with prevalence ratios 0.54 (95%CI 0.30-0.90) and 0.53 (95%CI 0.28-0.93). (see Supplementary Appendix
Table 3).
Sensitivity analysis. Alternative definitions of seroprevalence (test combination either favouring sensitivity or specificity) did

not qualitatively change the effect of non-response bias (see Supplementary Appendix Table A4). Seroprevalence estimates
obtained on re-weighted survey data (based on age group and education attainment level) were similar to estimates from the
main analysis. (see Supplementary Appendix Table A5).

Discussion
Our study aimed to assess the spread of epidemic in the fourth largest European city — St. Petersburg. Although the seroprevalence estimate varied based on the test used and type of correction applied, the total number of population with detectable
antibodies was still far lower than the proportion needed for herd immunity. Overall seroprevalence in the range between 7% and
10% was in line with the results obtained from the previous studies and provides evidence of the similar epidemic development
across the world with less than one tenth of population affected in the first months [5; 6].
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first seroprevalence survey of COVID-19 that applied correction based on characteristics that are associated with the risk of seropositivity in combination with incentivised participation. Early COVID-19
serological surveys are likely to exhibit high sampling error because of recruitment methods.[22] Population based studies with
random sampling relied on probability weighting obtained from the comparison with the source population [5–7]. . Our findings
show that even low estimates of seroprevalence (around or below 10%) obtained in population surveys can be an overestimation
in populations with high risk of non-response bias.
We detected only a slight change in the estimate of seroprevalence when we corrected our estimated for non-response bias
with respect to demographic or socioeconomic characteristics, but far more significant difference was detected when several
behavioural characteristics were included in models and applied in the correction. In general, our analysis shows that naïve
estimates that do not account for the non-response bias tend to drive prevalence estimates upward. In contrast to the findings
in the literature examining the non-response bias in HIV serosurveys, on average participants who are more likely to have
antibodies are more likely to participate in COVID-19 surveys [16; 23]. Participants with history of illness in the last 3 months
or past history of tests for COVID-19 in the last 3 months were more likely to agree to antibody testing in our study probably
seeking external confirmation.
In our sample of participants we did find only a slight age difference in the seropositivity rates, and there was no difference
between men and women, which is in line with previous findings [6]. However, we observed several clear differences in
seroprevalence estimates in a subgroup analysis. First of all, we detected an elevated seroprevalence in participants who reported
history of illness and history of any COVID-19 test in the last 3 months, this association was seen regardless of the modelling
approach. Second, seroprevalence was lower in participants who lived alone and reported that they started to wash their hands
more often. Third, in the secondary analysis of participants who were tested we observed that seroprevalence was lower in
current smokers compared to never smokers, it was also lower in participants who reported past history of allergies.
All associations revealed in our study should not be immediately regarded as causal due to limitations in the study design
and analysis. History of testing and illness in the last 3 months can be easily interpreted. Seroprevalence among those reporting

a history of COVID-19 testing was relatively low (around 20%), this can be explained by the high scale of testing in Russia
since the onset of the epidemic. However, our study is not a direct evidence of the effectiveness of hand hygiene, as selfreported change in habits can reflect other differences between sub-populations. There is limited and conflicting evidence
about the smoking rates in COVID-19 patients [24; 25]. While our study is the one of the first that compared population-based
seroprevalence estimates between smokers and non-smokers there is a need for more studies to confirm this finding [9]. There
are many examples when smoking effects were subject to structural epidemiological biases [26]. Even if this association is
causal, then behavioural or biological mechanisms should be explored. Smoking is a well-established risk factor for many
diseases and it is likely linked to COVID-19 severity regardless of the risk of infection [24].
It is also tempting to immediately search for biological explanation that link allergy status and risk of infection [27]. However, we should be very cautious due to limitations of study design and other possible explanations, e.g. people who self-report
being allergic may behave in a way to minimize risk of being infected. The question about allergy was very general in our
paper-based survey, that also limits the value of this finding.
Important source of bias in serological studies is the performance and the nature of the serological tests [28]. Possible
explanation of the difference in our study includes different classes of Ig analysed — IgG in case of CMIA and IgG+IgM+IgA
in case of ELISA. However, given the total seroprevalence of not more than 10% it seems that lack of IgM and IgA in CMIA
test can only partially explain the difference. A recent study showed that seroconversion started on day 5 after disease onset
and IgG level rose even earlier than IgM [29]. Another possible explanation for different seroprevalence estimates of two tests
is the nature of antigen. SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses specific to the Spike (S) and/or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins are
equally sensitive in the acute infection phase [30]. However, as compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N
protein appear to wane in the post-infection [31]. Recent evaluations of CMIA test used in our study reported sensitivity far
below 100% reported by manufacturer. This may also explain the difference [32; 33]. Another source of underestimation is
a proportion of infected that do not seroconvert. Straightforward adjustments for this sort of biases are not available without
additional laborious testing [34].
Our study has several other important limitations. We are addressing seroprevalence in adults only, while previous studies
also included participants younger than 18 years old [5; 6]. Our study had a relatively low participation rate given the existing
propensity to answer phone calls in the city. However, we assumed missingness at random for those who did not complete
the interview or did not pick the phone. Comparison with the previous representative city survey showed that our sample was
representative (see Supplementary Appendix Table A3). We have also excluded distant city districts from our sampling. Even
though we observed statistically significant differences between by-district seroprevalence, the lion’s share of city residents
(about 4.3 mln of 5.2 mln) live in the surveyed districts. Our randomized incentivisation scheme was not successful because
randomly assigned taxi offer was not associated with participation agreement and failed to become a valid exclusion restriction.
In our main analysis we did not apply post-stratification methods adopted previously [5]. However, application of raking
weights estimated to match targets from a representative survey of adult city population showed little to no changes in weighted
seroprevalence estimates. We explained this by little to no association between seroconversion and age or education level.
Finally, we report cross-sectional results but longitudinal data are needed to offer additional insights to immunity waning and
prolonged defence against re-infection.
Conclusion. COVID-19 pandemic has already affected at least 300 000 residents of St. Petersburg that can be extrapolated

to millions in the whole country. However the vast majority of population does not carry antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. This
highlights the need for further high-quality population based studies that can provide evidence for measures to diminish the
impact of the pandemic.

Title
Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Saint Petersburg, Russia: a population-based study

Statistical appendix
Let adult population of St. Petersburg be of size N , indexed with i, and characterised by a triplet ⟨Z, D, Y ⟩. Zi = 1 means that
the i-th resident will be surveyed, with Zi = 0 otherwise. Let Z be a vector of size N , its i-th element equals Zi . In other words,
Z indexes which city residents will be surveyed.
D marks the individual decision to participate in the survey when contacted: Di (Z) = 1: i-th individual volunteers to take
part in the study, with Di (Z) = 0 otherwise. Let D be the volunteer vector of size N .
When participation is universal Di (Z) = Zi ∀i. In reality one could observe non-zero refusal rates. In what follows we
assume one-sided noncompliance.
Variable Y characterises antibody status (seroconversion) of the i-th individual and takes the following values: {1, 0}, where
1 — has antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and 0 — does not have antibodies. Antibody status can be both observed and unobserved:
Yi ≡ Yi (Z, D). We are able to observe antibody status for Yi (Zi = 1, Di = 1), i.e. for the surveyed individuals who agreed to
volunteer in the study and were tested.
P
We are interested in population seroprevalence
estimate π ≡ 1/N × N
i=1 Yi . Having conducted our study we can estimate
Pn
the naïve seroprevalence π
bnaive ≡ 1/n × i=1 Yi (Zi = 1, Di = 1), where n is the number of tested individuals. To arrive at
population-level seroprevalence estimates the following assumptions are required:


′
′
Random sampling The survey is conducted such that Pr (Z = c) = Pr Z = c where c and c are arbitrary survey vectors.
Both observed and unobserved individual antibody status depends only on
his/her antibody status and decision to participate in the survey and not on the decision of other study participants. The surveyed
individuals maintain no contacts or other social interactions that could influence their individual decisions to participate in the
study. Such interactions might arise in case of household sampling where all household members are invited to participate in
the survey.
Stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA)

Let X∈ RN ×M be a matrix of observable individual characteristics. Its row Xi stores all characteristics of individual i that influence his/her decision to participate in the study when
surveyed. Naïve seroprevalence estimate will be representative of the city population only when cov ([D|X] , [Z|X]) = 0 and
cov ([D|X] , [Y|X]) = 0. That is, conditional on all observable characteristics of individuals, the decision to participate in the
study is orthogonal to both the conditional-on-observables survey inclusion and conditional-on-observables antibody status.
While the former orthogonality assumption [D|X] ⊥ [Z|X] is satisfied under random sampling of individuals, the latter is more
problematic. First, no phone survey design could ensure full observability of all characteristics associated both with individual
decision to volunteer and antibody status. Many variables might be left unobserved, rendering this orthogonality assumption
unrealistic. Second, differing sets of observables can influence seroconversion and decision to volunteer. For instance, past
travel history may be an important observable responsible for D = 1 while fully independent of actual antibody status Y = 1.
When the above assumptions are not satisfied the naïve seroprevalence estimate is biased. To account for this we rely on
bivariate binary model with non-random selection in the spirit of Bärnighausen et al. (2011) [1]. First we assume that decision
of a surveyed individual to agree to participate in the survey and come to the clinic test site is determined by a latent variable

No unobservable characteristics of study participants

Di∗ = βX i + γTi + εi

(1)

such that Di = 1 if D∗ > 0 and Di = 0 otherwise. Ti is a variable equal to unity if surveyed individual was offered free taxi to
and from the clinic test site during the phone survey, εi is the error term. We observe D only for n out of N individuals in the
population.
We observe antibody status only for those with Di = 1 and assume that seroconversion is determined by a latent variable
Yi∗ = δX i + ζi

(2)

such that Yi = 1 if Y ∗ > 0 and Yi = 0 otherwise. ζi is the error term. Since we have offered taxi to random phone survey
participants we can safely assume that cov ([Y|X] , T) = 0 and T becomes a valid exclusion restriction.

We impose a structural assumption of independent and identically Normal-distributed error terms εi and ζi with nil mean and
unit variance. Their joint cumulative distribution function is given by Φ (εi , ζi , ρ) where ρ is covariance (correlation coefficient).
This bivariate probit is estimated with R package GJRM [2]. We use different definitions of seropositivity Y = 1 depending
on antibody tests or combinations thereof and different set of variables in design matrix X.
Our first step is to estimate ρb and test whether it is statistically significantly different from zero. Estimates under different
sets of variables are reported below with 95% CIs in parentheses are reported in Supplementary Appendix Table A1.
As our baseline we adopt a model where a rich set of demographic, socioeconomic, and seropositivity-related characteristics
is included in the design matrix X. In this model results from both the simulated CIs and Lagrange multiplier test with null
ρ = 0 (not reported here, available at request) suggest that one cannot reject the null hypothesis of error term independence
between the selection stage and antibody test result stage.
Under error term independence Heckman correction is not required to arrive at seroprevalence estimates for the entire city
population when response is non-random. However, the naïve seroprevalence estimate can still be biased since the tested
individuals are not representative of the city population. To circumvent this we use the estimated parameters from baseline
seroconversion probit (see equation 2 above) and predict antibody status Y for all surveyed individuals regardless of their
agreement to participate in the survey. Such (univariate) single imputation that assumes no unobserved confounders permits us
to correct the naïve seroprevalence estimates for missing data for those individuals who have refused to get tested or did not
visit the clinic.
Symmetric confidence intervals come from standard errors estimated with delta method. Results do not change qualitatively
when we consider non-symmetric confidence intervals after Bayesian posterior simulation of the parameter vector estimate (not
reported here, available at request).
Finally, we rely on manufacturers’ test characteristics to correct all reported prevalence estimates π
b using the formula
π

95% confidence intervals in parentheses. “Called” means individuals who agreed to participate in the phone survey-“Agreed” are individuals who agreed
to be contacted by the clinic to get tested-“Tested” are individuals who came to clinic and gave blood samples. KOUZh-2018 is the 2016 round of the
Comprehensive monitoring of living conditions household survey carried out by the Federal State Statistics Service of Russia. We subset this survey to
include only adults in St. Petersburg. We report only complete-case observations in terms of all variables, therefore the number of observations is slightly
lower due to listwise deletion.

“Demographic characteristics” means the following variables: individual age group (18-34, 35-49, 50-64, 65+ years old) and sex. “Socioeconomic characteristics” means the following variables: higher education status and higher self-reported
income level. ”Characteristics associated with seropositivity” means the following variables: history of illness in the last 3 months, history of COVID-19 testing, whether respondent lives alone, change in hand washing habits during pandemic,
week of the phone interview, and city district. All models include a variable indicating random offer of taxi transportation to and from the clinic test site for interviewed participants. All estimates are corrected for tests characteristics.

“Demographic characteristics” means the following variables: individual age group (18-34, 35-49, 50-64, 65+ years old) and sex. “Socioeconomic characteristics” means the following variables: higher education status and higher self-reported
income level. “Characteristics associated with seropositivity” means the following variables: history of illness in the last 3 months, history of COVID-19 testing, whether respondent lives alone, change in hand washing habits during pandemic,
week of the phone interview, and city district. All models include a variable indicating random offer of taxi transportation to and from the clinic test site for interviewed participants. All estimates are corrected for tests characteristics. Serosurvey
sample was re-weighted with raking weights estimated to match the survey age group and educational attainment proportions in 2016 representative survey of adult city population (see Supplementary Appendix Table A3 for description of
this survey and the target proportions). R package anesrake was used to compute the weights.
