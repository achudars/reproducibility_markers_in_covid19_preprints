Abstract
Objective. Crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic are known to exacerbate depression and anxiety,
though their temporal trajectories remain unclear. The present study aims to investigate fluctuations in
depression and anxiety using COVID-19 as a model crisis.
Methods. 1,512 adults living in the U.S. enrolled in this online study on April 2nd, 2020 and were assessed
weekly for 10 weeks (until June 4th, 2020; final n=537). Depression and anxiety were measured using the
Zung Self-Rating Depression scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (state subscale), respectively, along
with demographic and COVID-related questions. Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to
examine factors contributing to longitudinal changes in depression and anxiety.
Results. Depression and anxiety levels were high in early April, but declined over time (F(9,4824)=17.53,
p<.001 and F(9,4824)=23.35, p<.001, respectively). In addition to demographic factors such as sex, age,
income, and psychiatric diagnoses, we identified some overlapping and some distinct dynamic factors
contributing to changes in depression and anxiety: worsening of weekly individual economic impact of
COVID-19 increased both depression and anxiety, while increased seven-day change in COVID-19 cases,
social media use, and projected pandemic duration were positively associated with anxiety, but not
depression.
Conclusions. Alongside evidence for overall emotional adaptation, these findings highlight overlapping
(economic), yet distinct (change in COVID-19 cases, social media use, and projected COVID-19 duration)
factors contributing to fluctuations in depression and anxiety throughout the first wave of COVID-19.
These results provide insight into socioeconomic policies and behavioral changes that can increase
emotional adaptation in times of crisis.

Introduction
In early 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) devastated the globe with catastrophic health
and economic consequences. People faced rapidly rising numbers of cases and deaths, overwhelmed
healthcare systems, enormous economic strain, and staggering unemployment rates. All the while,
individuals were asked to adhere to social distancing guidelines to reduce chances of viral transmission.
Thus, amidst the obvious threat to people’s physical health, the pandemic posed a dangerous risk to mental
health. Indeed, historical precedence for the mental health consequences of pandemics has been well
documented in prior research. Increased suicide rates were observed over the course of the 1918 Influenza
pandemic, which racked our social, economic, and medical spheres in ways similar to COVID-19 [1].
Research into mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic indicates that the current crisis is no
exception. Worsening mental health conditions in adults have already been reported in the United
Kingdom [2], United States [3], and Hong Kong [4].
However, humans also often demonstrate incredible emotional adaptability to new situations, even
when faced with prolonged hardship [5]. This is considered a form of resilience, which is defined as “the
ability to withstand setbacks, adapt positively, and bounce back from adversity” [6]. Recent research has
begun to elucidate the individual-level demographic and behavioral determinants of resilience and
emotional adaptation. Particularly, increased resilience against developing depression has been linked to
higher social support, familial support [7], and education levels [8], while being female [9] or of low
socioeconomic status [10] puts one at a higher risk of developing depression. These individual differences
are upheld during crises: following a widespread economic downturn, women and low-income individuals
were more likely to develop depressive and anxious symptoms [8]. Other studies have shown that
behavioral factors contribute to resilience as well: during the COVID-19 pandemic, a study of an Irish
sample showed that emotional wellbeing is positively associated with participation in outdoor activities,
and negatively associated with excessive intake of COVID-related social media content [11]. Yet, it

remains unclear whether individuals will demonstrate such emotional adaptability during a prolonged
crisis such as COVID-19; and if so, what factors might contribute to such adaptation.
Here, we examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression and anxiety between
April 2nd and June 4th, 2020, in a community sample in the U.S. 1,512 participants enrolled in an online
study and completed questionnaires every week for a 10-week period. Questions spanned a wide range of
topics including self-reported depression and anxiety, subjective feelings and beliefs about COVID-19,
and demographic information such as age and socioeconomic status (see Supplementary Materials for
a complete list). Following data collection, two mixed-effects general linear models were conducted to
elucidate the variables contributing to fluctuations in depression and anxiety over the 10-week period.
These analyses constitute one of the first investigations into the demographic (i.e., unchanging) and
dynamic (i.e., unfolding longitudinally) factors associated with mental health during COVID-19.

Methods
The present study was part of a large web-based longitudinal study examining mental health and
decision-making during the first wave of COVID-19 in the U.S.
Participants
1,512 participants who met eligibility criteria (age between 18-64, current U.S. resident, >90%
study participant approval rating) enrolled in the study on a web-based research platform
(www.prolific.co) on April 2nd, 2020 (see Table 1 for summary of characteristics). Exclusion criteria
were: (1) voluntary dropout (638 or 42.2% of participants in total, weekly dropout rate between 7.314.4%) (2) duplicated entries (28 or 1.85% of participants), and (3) failure in responding accurately to
attention-check questions (e.g., “If you are paying attention, please select ‘most of the time’”) at any time
point (309 or 20.44% of participants). The final sample included 537 participants who successfully
completed all 10 weeks of data collection (252 females (47%), mean age 36.91±13.68, from 48 states)

and passed all data quality checks (Figure 2A). Excluded (n=975) and included (n=537) participant
cohorts did not differ on demographic factors such as sex and income. The final sample was older
(t(1497)=4.22, p<.001) and had lower depression and anxiety scores at the first time point (t(1493)=-4.56,
p<.001, t(1495)=-3.53, p<.001, respectively) (see Supplementary Table S1). However, the trends of
overall depression and anxiety scores of the full sample for each timepoint followed the trend of the final
clean sample (Figure 2B).
Participants provided informed consent via an online form. The Institutional Review Board of the
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai determined this research to be exempt following review.
Participants received base compensation for their time each week ($7.25 for weeks that included
behavioral task completion, $3 for weeks that included only survey completion), as well as a scaled bonus
according to performance. At week five, participants received a $10 bonus for completing half of the
study, and at week 10, participants received a $15 bonus for completing the entire study.
Procedure
Each week, participants were allotted just over two hours to complete questionnaires assessing
mental health as well as perceptions of and behaviors related to COVID-19. Survey data collection was
conducted within a 24-hour time window, every 7 days between April 2nd, 2020 and June 4th, 2020 (10
time points in total). Participants additionally provided demographic information at the first time point.
Other study elements included decision-making tasks, which are reported elsewhere as they are outside
the scope of this study.
Measures and Scoring
The full survey, as seen by participants at the first time point, can be found in Supplementary
Table S2. For the analysis, we considered both static demographic factors (e.g., sex) and dynamic factors
(fluctuating over time) as variables of interest in relation to mental health.

The initial subset of demographic variables included sex, age, pre-COVID income level (binned into 12
discrete categories), a self-reported history of either a mood or an anxiety disorder diagnosis, and marital
status. Marital status was not included in the final analysis due to covariance with other variables of
interest (see Supplementary Information for details).
Alongside demographic details, answers to the following items were considered in the analysis
(Figure 1B1-3): (1) economic impact (“Rate the impact that COVID-19 has had on your economic
situation”, rated from Very negative impact, -50 to Very positive impact, +50), (2) being informed (“How
well are you keeping up with COVID-19 news?” rated from Not at all informed, 0, to Extremely well
informed, +100), (3) social media use (“How much do you use social media now/during COVID?”, rated
from Not at all, 0, to All the time, +100), (4) and subjective projection of the pandemic’s duration (“How
long do you think the global pandemic will last?”, 1-2 months, 3-4 months, 5-6 months, 6-12 months, or
More than one year).
The Zung Self-Rating Depression scale [12] and State Anxiety Inventory [13] were used to assess
depression and anxiety, respectively.
COVID-19 severity in the U.S. was computed as a 7-day running average of new daily cases [14].
We also calculated a 7-day change in COVID-19 cases by taking the national case count at time point t
minus national case count at t-1 (one week earlier), divided by national case count at time point t-1 (Figure
1A).
Physical activity was defined as reporting taking a walk or exercising in the preceding week.
Statistical analysis
Prior to analysis we preprocessed the variables. We binarized sex into male and female (or other,
n=1), race into white and non-white, and marital status into married and not married. We created a mood
disorder diagnosis variable by identifying participants with a past or present diagnosis of either major
depression or bipolar disorder. We created an anxiety disorder diagnosis variable by identifying

participants with a past or present diagnosis of either generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social
anxiety disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Economic impact was scaled to be between -.5 and
.5; informedness and social media use were scaled to 0-1.
To identify variables relating to depression and anxiety, we conducted two mixed-effect linear
regressions:
Depression (or anxiety) ~ 1 + age + sex + race + income + diagnosis + age:time + sex:time +
race:time + income:time + diagnosis:time + time + COVID19_severity + activity + economic_impact +
informedness + social_media + COVID19_future + (1 + age:time + sex:time + race:time + income:time
+ diagnosis:time + time + COVID19_severity + activity + economic_impact + informedness +
social_media + COVID19_future | participant)
All analyses were carried out using MATLAB 2018b. Regressions were conducted using the
fitglme function.
Comparison with past studies
To address the lack of pre-pandemic baseline levels of depression and anxiety, we relied on
previously reported community means [15,16]. We took the reported mean, standard deviation, and
sample size (Depression: M=38.1, SD=9.45, N=172; Anxiety: M=37.28, SD=11.24, N=185), and
conducted 2-sample t-tests with the first three time points, for each respective score.

Results
Both depression and anxiety scores were highest at the beginning of the pandemic, and declined
over the 10 weeks (repeated-measures ANOVA, F(9,4824)=17.53, p<.001, partial η2=0.03 and
F(9,4824)=23.35, p<.001, partial η2=0.04, respectively; Figure 2C&D). Notably, while average
depression scores remained below the standard clinical cutoff for a depression diagnosis [15], the average
anxiety score at the first time point (40±13.23) matched a widely-used clinical cutoff of 40, indicating that

the average participant in our study was clinically anxious in early April 2020 (t(536)=0.006, p=.99, one
sample t-test against 40) [17]. Moreover, anxiety at week one was higher than previously reported
community averages (37.28±11.24) [16], and decreased to match pre-pandemic averages within three
weeks (t1: t(720)=2.5, p=.01; t2: t(720)=2.48, p=.01; t3: t(720)=1.4, p=.12; Figure 2D). Depression (week
one: 39.3±10.7) followed a similar pattern (community average: 38.10±9.45) [15], albeit not statistically
significant (t1: t(707)=1.3; t2: t(707)=0.27; t3: t(707)=0.43; all p>.19; see Figure 2C).
We used two mixed-effects linear models to estimate the influence of demographic and dynamic
variables on depression and anxiety separately (which outperformed alternative models consisting of
subsets of these variables; see Supplementary Table S3). We found similar demographic variables
associated with depression and anxiety. Specifically, higher levels of depression and anxiety at each time
point were related to being younger (β=-0.2 , t(5382)=-7.16, p<.001; β=-0.2, t(5382)=-5.48, p<.001),
female (β=-2.2, t(5382)=-2.74, p=.006; β=-1.7, t(5382)=-1.72, p=.08), and having lower income (β=-0.6,
t(5382)=-4.99, p<.001; β=-0.5, t(5382)=-3.73, p<.001). As expected, having a diagnosis of a mood or
anxiety disorder was also related to a respective increase in depression (β=8.4, t(5382)=8.49, p<.001) or
anxiety (β=6.7, t(5382)=5.45, p<.001) (Figure 3).
For dynamic factors, we found both overlapping and distinct factors predicting changes in
depression and anxiety, over and above the effect of time (Figure 3A). The economic impact of COVID19 negatively affected mental health, such that COVID-related worsening of one’s financial situation was
related to increases in both depression (β=-1.7, t(5382)=-3.6, p<.001) and anxiety (β=-2.5, t(5382)=-2.93,
p=.003). Interestingly, changes in anxiety, but not depression, were affected by the 7-day change in
COVID-19 cases (β=1, t(5382)=2.5, p=.01; but not case count itself, Figure 1A), social media use
(β=1.48, t(5382)=2, p=.04), and subjective projections of COVID-19 duration (β=0.54, t(5382)=3.45,
p<.001). Age interacted with time to predict changes in depression (β=0.004, t(5382)=2.3, p=.02) but not

anxiety; although older individuals were less depressed overall, time had a less palliative effect on them,
as compared with younger individuals. No other demographic factors significantly interacted with time.

Discussion
Despite the known impact of crises and disasters on mental health, humans are able to adapt to
hardship over time [5]. This study provides evidence that in the United States, depression and anxiety
initially peaked but then declined over 10 weeks during the first wave of COVID-19. Furthermore, we
report that overlapping, yet distinct socioeconomic and psychological factors affected depression and
anxiety trajectories as the pandemic lingered. Specifically, the economic impact of COVID-19 negatively
affected mental health trajectories, such that COVID-related worsening of one’s financial situation was
associated with increases in both depression and anxiety. Changes in anxiety, but not depression, were
associated with the 7-day change in national COVID-19 cases, social media use, and subjective projection
of COVID-19 duration. Age predicted longitudinal changes in depression but not anxiety, such that the
observed decline in depression over time was less strong in older individuals.
Consistent with past work on the link between economic recession and mental health, the economic
impact of COVID-19 on individuals was associated with depression and anxiety scores. Following the
2008 Great Recession, a large body of research was conducted to investigate the proximate and long-term
emotional ramifications of economic hardship. Financial insecurity and unemployment were found to
increase suicide prevalence [18–20], and decrease self-reported happiness and life satisfaction [21]. One
investigation into suicide rates in Iceland following the 2008 recession did not find a significant uptick in
suicides, a result that the authors attribute in part to “a strong welfare system and investing in social
protection” [22]. Income and financial insecurity were also associated with increased depression [20], and
psychiatric hospitals reported an increase in outpatient counts among previously healthy individuals, as
well as those with anxiety, mood, and adjustment disorders [23]. In the context of COVID-19, complaints

of increased self-reported depression and anxiety at the beginning of the pandemic were found to be
associated with lower societal appreciation for one’s occupation and the sudden onset of economic
hardship [24]. Given the substantial relationship between economic crisis and mental health, especially
with regard to income, the field would benefit from future investigations into potential mitigating effects
of governmental financial support.
Several variables (7-day change in COVID-19 cases, social media use, and subjective projection
of COVID-19 duration) affected anxiety, but not depression. This can potentially be explained by the
fundamental differences between depression and anxiety. Historically, scientists have vacillated between
consideration of depression and anxiety as the same disorder, different disorders on the same affective
spectrum, and entirely different disorders with unique symptomatology [25,26]. Depression and anxiety
are very often comorbid in patients with psychiatric disorders [25], and until recently, self-report measures
rarely distinguished adequately between their symptoms [27]. But pharmacological separation exists
between their treatments (antidepressants and anxiolytics, respectively) [26], and both overlapping and
distinct neurobiological profiles have been found to be associated with depression and anxiety in
neuroimaging studies [28]. Traditionally, depression has been associated with sadness about the past,
whereas anxiety has been described as maladaptive anticipation of the future [27]. This distinction could,
in part, explain why some dynamic factors in the current study measured longitudinally contribute to
anxiety and not depression; indeed, the worldwide spread of the coronavirus disease, the prolonged
lockdown, and the economic recession have resulted in increased uncertainty concerning one’s future
health, as well as interpersonal and financial circumstances. However, such claims are speculative without
investigation into the specific differences between depression and anxiety that enabled certain factors to
contribute to worsening scores for one disorder but not the other.
In accordance with recent research, we also found that age, sex, and income level were associated
with overall depression and anxiety scores such that being younger, female, and having lower income

indicated higher scores on average. These results mirror those reported in other studies: a cohort of adults
in the United Kingdom who had already completed a mental health study pre-COVID reported higher
levels of mental distress during the pandemic, especially young and female participants, in addition to
participants with small children [2]. Young adults in the United States were found to have high depression,
anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) scores during the pandemic, with higher loneliness
scores and COVID-related anxiety increasing the likelihood that depression, anxiety, and PTSD scores
would reach clinical threshold [29]. In another United States adult sample, depression symptoms were
abnormally high at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to pre-COVID national
averages, and individuals with lower income levels reported more depression symptoms than their highincome counterparts [3]. Likewise, self-reported depression and health anxiety symptoms increased
particularly rapidly in individuals who experienced financial insecurity in the early days of the pandemic
[24]. Thus, the findings reported here provide evidence for individual differences in susceptibility to
increased depression and anxiety during COVID-19.
There are two main limitations of the present study. First, no baseline scores for self-reported
depression or anxiety could be established due to the unexpected nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and
time needed to set up the study. To address this, we compared our scores with previously-reported mean
community scores of the same depression and anxiety measures. We found that anxiety and depression
both began at higher levels than previously reported community averages - though not significantly so for
depression - and decreased to meet these averages by week three of data collection. The second limitation
of our study is its correlational nature: with the exception of demographic information and the effects of
time and seven-day change of COVID-19 cases, causation in either direction cannot be ascribed to the
results of our mixed-effects models. For example, while our findings included an association between
increased social media use and exacerbated anxiety scores, this could be explained either by social media
content driving anxiety or by the likelihood that an individual with increased anxiety would monitor social

media more closely. Likewise, negative economic impact could contribute to depression, but increased
depression could also render an individual unable to work. Thus, more research is needed to establish the
precise relationships between mental health symptomatology and COVID-19.
Taken together, our findings provide important evidence supporting human resilience as a crisis
lingers, as well as revealing the factors contributing to such adaptability. As such, these findings have
real-world implications, serving as a vulnerability screening tool in the hands of clinicians and
policymakers as they allocate mental health resources during turbulent times. Such a tool would prove
most imperative, given the long-lasting effects of COVID-19 on the global economy, as well as other
impending crises such as the changing climate.

Figure 1. Dynamic variables in the study. [A] COVID-19 severity was measured as a 7-day running average of the number
of daily new cases (per 10K), and a weekly change in said average between timepoints. [B] Self-reported economic impact,
social media frequency use, and subjective projection of pandemic’s duration during data collection. Economic impact is overall
negative, but improves with time [B1]. Individuals reported using social media less frequently with time [B2]. Individuals’
projected duration for the pandemic increased with time [B3]. Error bars represent standard errors.

Figure 2. Data collection timeline, with participant exclusion, and depression and anxiety scores. Longitudinal data were
collected through weekly surveys for a 10-week period. Final sample included 537 participants. [A] Drop-out rates are
presented alongside numbers of exclusions based on duplicate responses and failed attention checks. [B] Depression and
anxiety trends in different subsets of participants. The blue line depicts depression (top panel) and anxiety (bottom panel) scores
from participants with valid responses on the first week of data collection (n=1367), who later dropped out or were excluded.
The yellow line depicts scores from participants who successfully completed all 10 weeks of data collection (n=537). All other
lines depict intermediate subsets of participants. Shaded area represents standard error of the mean. [C+D] State-anxiety and
depression scores were measured weekly. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean. Community averages were obtained
from previously reported depression (light blue) [15] and state-anxiety (pink) [16] scores in healthy adults, with standard error
of the mean.
