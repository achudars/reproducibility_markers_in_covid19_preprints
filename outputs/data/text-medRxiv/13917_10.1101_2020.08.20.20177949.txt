Clean air is a fundamental necessity for human health and well-being. The COVID-19
lockdown worldwide resulted in controls on anthropogenic emission that have a significant
synergistic effect on air quality ecosystem services (ESs). This study utilised both satellite and
surface monitored measurements to estimate air pollution for 20 cities across the world.
Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data were used for
evaluating tropospheric air quality status during the lockdown period. Surface measurement
data were retrieved from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, USA) for a more explicit
assessment of air quality ESs. Google Earth Engine TROPOMI application was utilised for a
time series assessment of air pollution during the lockdown (1 Feb to 11 May 2020) compared
with the lockdown equivalent periods (1 Feb to 11 May 2019). The economic valuation for air
pollution reduction services was measured using two approaches: (1) median externality value
coefficient approach; and (2) public health burden approach. Human mobility data from Apple
(for city-scale) and Google (for country scale) was used for examining the connection between
human interferences on air quality ESs. Using satellite data, the spatial and temporal
concentration of four major pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2),
carbon monoxide (CO) and the aerosol index (AI) were measured. For NO2, the highest
reduction was found in Paris (46%), followed by Detroit (40%), Milan (37%), Turin (37%),
Frankfurt (36%), Philadelphia (34%), London (34%), and Madrid (34%), respectively. At the
same time, a comparably lower reduction of NO2 is observed in Los Angeles (11%), Sao Paulo
(17%), Antwerp (24%), Tehran (25%), and Rotterdam (27%), during the lockdown period.
Using the adjusted value coefficients, the economic value of the air quality ESs was calculated
for different pollutants. Using the public health burden valuation method, the highest economic
benefits due to the reduced anthropogenic emission (for NO2) was estimated in US$ for New
York (501M $), followed by London (375M $), Chicago (137M $), Paris (124M $), Madrid
(90M $), Philadelphia (89M $), Milan (78M $), Cologne (67M $), Los Angeles (67M $),
Frankfurt (52M $), Turin (45M $), Detroit (43M $), Barcelona (41M $), Sao Paulo (40M $),
Tehran (37M $), Denver (30M $), Antwerp (16M $), Utrecht (14 million $), Brussels (9 million
$), Rotterdam (9 million $), respectively. In this study, the public health burden and median
externality valuation approaches were adopted for the economic valuation and subsequent
interpretation. This one dimension and linear valuation may not be able to track the overall
economic impact of air pollution on human welfare. Therefore, research that broadens the
scope of valuation in environmental capitals needs to be initiated for exploring the importance
of proper monetary valuation in natural capital accounting.

As per the Ecosystem Services (ESs) definition of Millennium Ecosystem Assessment
(MA, 2005), provision of clean air is one of the fundamental needs of human lives, which
mainly comes from natural vegetation and appropriates by human interferences (Schirpke et
al., 2014; Ash et al., 2010; Charles et al., 2020; Baró et al., 2014). The accelerated increases of
air pollution across the world that mainly comes from transport emissions, industrial emission,
domestic emission, and waste incineration is the primary reason for the degrading status of air
quality ecosystem services. The high concentration of air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide
(NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2),
which goes beyond the normal absorption capacity by the green canopy, leading to a paramount
impact on the quality of human life (Nowak, 1994; Escobedo et al., 2008; De Carvalho and
Szlafsztein, 2019; Gómez-Baggethun and Barton, 2013). The COVID-19 pandemic and its
associated restriction on human activities cut down the pollution level drastically across the
scale (Kumar et al., 2020a,b; Mahato et al., 2020). Many scholarly works appear on time to
discuss the positive effect of COVID-19 lockdown on air quality (Venter et al., 2020, Kumar
et al., 2020a; Ogen, 2020; Sasidharan et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020). However, a thorough
evaluation is needed to measure the synergistic effects of these interventions on air quality
ecosystem services.

Air pollution has been reduced drastically due to COVID-19 led lockdown and its
resultant restrictions on human activities. Veneter et al. (2020) had examined both tropospheric
and ground air pollution levels using satellite data and a network of >10,000 air quality stations
across the world and found that 29% reduction of NO2 (with 95% confidence interval -44% to
-13%), 11% reduction of Ozone (O3), and 9% reduction of PM2.5 during the first two weeks of
lockdown (Venter et al., 2020). Kerimray et al. (2020) study at Almaty, Kazakhstan, found that
the effect of city-scale lockdown, which was effective on March 19, 2020, has resulted in 21%
reduction of PM2.5 with spatial variation of 6 – 34%. The CO (49% reduction) and NO2 (35%
reduction) concentration has also been reduced substantially. In the same period, an increase
(15%) in O3 levels is also observed in Almaty, Kazakhstan (Kerimray et al., 2020). Mahato et
al. (2020) had reported a sharp reduction in air pollution in Delhi, one of the most polluted
cities in the world. The author found that the concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 in Delhi was
reduced to 60% and 39%, compared to the air pollution levels in 2019 (considered the
lockdown period only). The concentration of other pollutants, such as NO2 (−52.68%) and CO
(−30.35%), have also been reduced substantially during the lockdown period. In addition to
this, Mahato et al. study has observed a 40% to 50% improvement in air quality in Delhi within
the first week of lockdown. Bao and Zhang, (2020) study combined air pollution and Intracity
Migration Index (IMI) data for 44 cities in northern China and found that restriction on human
mobility is strongly associated with the reduction of air pollution in these cities. The author
found that the air quality index (AQI) in these cities is decreased by 7.80%, as the concentration
of five key air pollutants, i.e., SO2, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO have decreased by 6.76%,
5.93%, 13.66%, 24.67%, and 4.58%, respectively. Sicard et al., (2020) had observed that due
to lockdown and resulted in the restriction on human activities, NO2 mean concentrations were
reduced substantially in all European cities, which was ~53% at urban stations. During the
same period, the mean concentrations of O3was reported to be increased at the urban stations
in Europe, i.e., 24% increases in Nice, 14% increases in Rome, 27% increases in Turin, 2.4%
increases in Valencia and 36% in increases in Wuhan (China). Otmani et al., (2020) study at

Morocco using three-dimensional air mass backward trajectories and HYSPLIT model found
that PM10, SO2, and NO2 are reduced up to 75%, 49%, and 96% during the lockdown period.
In the southeast Asian (SEA) countries, (Kanniah et al., 2020) study found that PM10, PM2.5,
NO2, SO2, and CO concentrations have been decreased by 26–31%, 23–32%, 63–64%, 9–20%,
and 25–31% during the lockdown period in Malaysia. Kumar et al., (2020a) examined the
impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures on the reduction of PM2.5 in five Indian cities
(Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai), using in-situ measurements from 2015 to
2020. Kumar et al. study found that during the lockdown period (25 March to 11 May), the
PM2.5 concentration in the selected cities has been reduced by 19 to 43% (Chennai), 41–53%
(Delhi), 26–54% (Hyderabad), 24–36% (Kolkata), and 10–39% (Mumbai), respectively. This
study also found that cities with higher traffic volume exhibited a greater reduction of PM2.5.

The level of air pollution has a severe impact on human health and overall well-being.
Air pollution is responsible for nearly 5 million deaths each year globally (IHME, 2020). In
2017, air pollution had contributed to 9% of deaths, ranges from 2% in the high developed
country to a maximum 15% in low-developed countries, especially in South and East Asia
(IHME, 2020). Based on Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) statistics, which
demonstrate of losing one year of good health due to either premature mortality or disability
caused by any factors, it has been estimated that air pollution is the 5th largest contributor to
overall disease burden, only after high blood pressure, smoking, high blood sugar, and obesity,
respectively. The adverse impact of air pollution on human health is not only limited to
(low)developing countries. In the European regions, nearly 193,000 deaths in 2012 were
attributed to airborne particulate matter (Ortiz et al., 2017). In addition, it has been found that
air pollution in China is accountable for 4000 deaths each day, i.e., 1.6 million casualties in
2016 (Rohde and Muller, 2015; Wang and Hao, 2012). By looking at the adverse effects of air
pollution on COVID-19 counts, Chen et al., (2020) found that reduction in PM2·5 during the
lockdown period helped to avoid a total of 3214 PM2·5 related deaths (95% CI 2340–4087).
Chen et al., (2020) also estimated that COVID-19 lockdown and resulted cut down of air
pollution brought multi-faceted health benefits to non-COVID mortalities. Several research
studies (He et al., 2020; L. et al., 2015; Dutheil et al., 2020a) have echoed the surmountable
effects of air pollutants on human lives and found that an increase in 10μg m-3 of NO2 per day
will be responsible for a 0.13% increases of all-cause mortality (He et al., 2020). The mortality
rate would be around 2% when the 5-day NO2 level would reach 10μg m-3 (Monica et al., 2011).
In addition to this, L. et al. (2015) estimated that the increase in 8.1 ppb in NO2 is attributed to
1.052 increases in global hazard ratio related to air pollution.

Ecosystem Services (ESs) are the supports and benefits (provisioning, such as food and
water; regulating such as management of floods, drought, land degradation, and disease;
supporting such as soil formation and nutrient cycling; and cultural such as recreational,
spiritual, religious and other non-material) that humans have free access from natural
environment and ecosystems, which adds to human well-being (Fisher et al., 2009; Costanza
et al., 1997; Braat and de Groot, 2012; Sannigrahi et al., 2018; Sannigrahi et al., 2019). The
ecosystem service value (ESV) is a comprehensive assessment and has proven to be an
alternative appraisal between environment and human development for sustainable natural
resource management (Braat and de Groot, 2012; Potschin and Haines-Young, 2013; Pandeya
et al., 2016; Sannigrahi et al., 2020c; Sannigrahi et al., 2020b; Adekola et al., 2015). The
growing importance of ESs helps in adjusting the cost-benefit analysis by evaluating both the

negative and positive effects of human interferences on the natural environment and
ecosystems. Considering the plausible application of ecosystem service valuation in different
strata of planning, priorities should be given to developing a suitable valuation framework for
estimating the biophysical and economic values of the key ESs (Bastian et al., 2013; Burkhard
et al., 2014; Spangenberg et al., 2014; Affek and Kowalska, 2017; Sannigrahi et al., 2019). Due
to unawareness about the importance of ESs on natural capital formation and human wellbeing, the ecosystem service valuation research was neglected for an extended period (Jack et
al., 2008). To overcome this, several national and international valuation framework were
formed, including The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES),
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA 2005), Ecosystem Service Partnership (ESP) to name
a few (Burkhard et al., 2009; Costanza et al., 2014; Comberti et al., 2015).

It is now well-established by many data-driven experiments that the accelerated rate of
air pollution can have a substantial impact on overall human well-being. Due to this pandemic,
the world witnessed an extraordinary transformation in all strata of lives, such as adopting
digital alternatives to carry out the routine life and imposing national scale lockdown to restrict
human mobility and social activity, to prevent the spread of infection. Additionally, as it is
observed by many studies across the scale, the long term restriction on human mobility resulted
in the reduction of road traffic, which improved the air quality status of a region. The
importance of this human-induced reduction of air pollution needs to be evaluated in a way so
that the same could be used as a reference for future decision making and policy formation.
The present research thus made an effort to investigate the human impact on the natural
environment by taking COVID-19 lockdown and its resultant effects of air pollution as a case
for the experiment. The economic valuation was carried out to assess the synergistic effect of
this pandemic on air pollutions at 20 cities across the world. The main objectives of this study
are: (1) to estimate the spatiotemporal changes in air pollution during 1 February to 11 May in
2019 and 2020 using both satellite and ground monitoring data; (2) to estimate the air quality
ecosystem service using multiple economic valuation approaches; (3) to evaluate the
association between human mobility and reduction of air pollution.

A total of 20 cities have been selected for evaluating the effect of lockdown on air
quality ESs. These cities are Antwerp, Barcelona, Brussels, Chicago, Cologne, Denver,
Frankfurt, London, Los Angeles, Madrid, Milan, New York, Paris, Philadelphia, Rotterdam,
Sao Paulo, Tehran, Turin, and Utrecht. These cities have been considered based on two criteria:
high air pollution and high COVID-19 casualties. Most of the cities listed here are from
European and American countries. These countries reported more COVID-19 casualties
compared with the Asian and Latin American countries (as of 11 May 2020) (WHO, 2020;
Sannigrahi et al., 2020a). Sentinel 5P time series pollution data were also used to identify the
most polluted cities. Both satellite and ground air pollution data were utilised for evaluating
the positive effects of lockdown on the air quality index of these cities. For comparison, the
satellite-based air pollution was measured from 01 February to 11 May for both 2019

(lockdown equivalent period) and 2020 (lockdown period). The concentration of four key air
pollutants, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and aerosol
index (AI) concentration, was computed for both 2019 and 2020 using Sentinel 5P data. For
six cities, i.e., Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, and Philadelphia, the ground
monitored air pollution data was collected for a more explicit assessment of air quality ESs.
However, the ground monitored data was not adequate for the spatial evaluation for most of
the cities considered in this study. Therefore, the in-situ data was only used for time series
assessment of air pollutions, and the satellite measured pollution estimates were utilised for the
spatially explicit appraisal and economic valuation. Human mobility data, including driving
and transit for the selected cities, were collected from Apple (for city-scale) and Google (for
country scale) mobility reports. In addition to this, the gridded human settlement data and
population density data (pixel format) were collected from the Socio-Economic Data
Application Center, National Aeronautics and Space Application data center (SEDAC,
NASA). For evaluating the total air pollution reduction of these 20 cities in a more accurate
way, the Geographical Information System (GIS) enabled city boundary (shapefile format) was
extracted from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) application. Two consecutive steps were followed
to get the boundary of these cities. First, the OSM relation identifier number (OSM id) was
generated for all the 20 cities using Nominatim, a search engine for OpenStreetMap data. Then,
the OSM relation id of each city was ingested in the OSM polygon creation application
interface, which generates the geometry (both actual and simplified) of the relation id in poly,
GeoJSON, WKT or image formats. The formatted image geometry of the cities was then
imported in ArcGIS Pro software, and the city boundary was extracted using an automatic
digitisation function.

The ESA (European Space Agency) Sentinel-5 Precursor (S 5P) is an example of low
earth Sun-synchronous Orbit (SSO) polar satellite that provides information of tropospheric air
quality, climate dynamics and ozone layer concentration for the time period 2015–2022
(Veefkind et al., 2012). The ESA led S 5P mission is one of the few missions that is intended
to measure air and climatic variability from the space-borne application. The S 5P mission is
associated with the Global Monitoring of the Environment and Security (GMES) space
programme. The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) payload of S 5P mission
was designed to measure the tropospheric concentration of few key air pollutants, i.e., ozone
(O3), NO2, SO2, CO, CH4, CH2O and aerosol properties in line with Ozone Monitoring
Instrument (OMI) and SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric
CartograpHY (SCIAMACHY) programme (Veefkind et al., 2012). TROPOMI measures the
concentration of key tropospheric constituents at 7 × 7 km2 spatial unit. This default spatial
scale was downscaled into 1km × 1km scale for city-scale analysis and subsequent
interpretation. In this study, the spatial and temporal variability of four key air pollutants was
extracted and mapped from the TROPOMI measurements using the Google Earth Engine cloud
platform. For this purpose, an interactive application called TROPOMI Explorer App,
developed by Google developers teams (Google, 2020; Braaten, 2020), was utilised to facilitate
quick and easy S5P data exploration and to examine the changes in air pollution in both cross5

pollutants were also prepared with the help of this TROPOMI Explorer application. The other
accessories of this application, such as NO2 time series inspector, NO2 temporal comparison,

Ground monitored air quality data was available only for a few cities considered in the
study, including Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, and Philadelphia. Thus,
these cities were selected for the ground data-driven analysis. Ground monitored data for these
cities were collected from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). This data is
available for a daily scale and for six key pollutants, such as CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10, and
SO2, respectively. The in-situ air pollution concentration at a daily scale was considered only
for the time series assessment of pollution concentration. Additionally, the said in-situ data had
not been used for any validation and calibration of satellite pollution estimates. The time series
(2000–2020) air quality index (AQI) of these selected cities were also generated using the
multilayer time plot function. The overall AQI values were sub-divided into six groups, i.e.,
good, moderate, unhealthy for sensitive population groups, unhealthy, very unhealthy, and
hazardous, respectively. In addition to this, the single year AQI data was also extracted for the
selected cities from the EPA. The number of unhealthy days for each pollutant was measured
using the EPA AQI plot function. The combination of two different pollutants, such as CO and
NO2, PM10 and PM2.5, was permuted to assess the yearly AQI status of the cities. As several
studies reported the increment of O3 due to the reduction of GHG emissions, this study also
evaluated the O3 exceedances for the current year compared to the average O3 concentration
of the last 5 and 20 years. This particular task was implemented using the EPA Ozone
exceedances plot function (EPA, 2020). Table. S1 provides the criteria of categorisation for
each index.

et al., 2017; Rai et al., 2017; Pilla and Broderick, 2015). Various policies have been
implemented for managing the city-based air pollution that mainly originated from
anthropogenic activities from speciﬁc sources and sectors (Kumar et al., 2015; Kumar et al.,
2016; Baró et al., 2014; Feng and Liao, 2016; Zhang et al., 2016). These include the Directive
2010/75/EU on industrial emissions, initiated by European Commission to define ‘‘Euro
standards’’ for measuring the road vehicle emissions and the Directive 94/63/EC for
calculating volatile organic compounds emissions from petrol storage (Baro et al., 2014). The
reduction of these gaseous pollutants by green canopy has significant economic importance
(Kumar et al., 2019). Two main ecosystem services, such as air quality regulation and
climate/gas regulation, are mainly associated with air quality ecosystem services. Several
studies have calculated the economic values of NO2, SO2, CO reductions using various
valuation approaches such as carbon tax, the social cost of carbon, shadow price method,
marginal cost method, etc. (Guerriero et al., 2016; Castro et al., 2017; Jeanjean et al., 2017;
Bherwani et al., 2020). In this study, multiple relevant approaches were adopted for calculating

the economic values of the NO2, SO2, CO, aerosol reduction to gauge the economic benefits of
these functions. Since this study has considered the air pollution reduction at the city scale, the
public health burden and mean externality valuation approaches were utilised for estimating
economic damage due to air pollution and to calculate the economic values of air quality
services (Baro et al., 2014; Matthews and Lave, 2000). Unit social damage price due to air
pollution was estimated for 2020 using the U.S consumer price index (CPI) inflation calculator
(U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020). Additionally, using the most updated price conversion
factors, the mean externality values for the key pollutants was estimated as: CO = 956 $ t-1,
NOx = 5149 $ t-1, SO2 = 3678 $ t-1, PM10 = 7907 $ t-1.

The public health burden valuation approach has also been utilised for economic
valuation of air quality ESs (Kumar et al., 2020a, Etchie et al. 2018; Hu et al., 2015; Sharma et
al., 2020; Sahu and Kota, 2017; COMEAP, 2009). The calculation of public health burden and
the associated economic burden was conducted by three subsequent steps: first, estimation of
population-weighted average concentration; second, estimation of health burden or a number
of premature mortality attributable to air pollution; and third, the economic burden due to
excess air pollution and economic benefits subject to the reduction of air pollution levels during
the lockdown period. The population-weighted average concentration (PWAC) was measured
as follows:

weighted average concentration. The PWAC was estimated using ArcPy Python module.
Gridded population data from SEDAC, NASA, was utilised for this task. Pollution and gridded
population data for the same time period were used for estimations of PWAC.

Following, the health burden (HB), which refers premature deaths attributable to shortterm exposure to air pollutants was estimated for the study period (1 February to 11 May 2020).
The reduction in health burden (ΔHB) was also measured by calculating the difference between
the previous and later HB estimates.

The economic burden (EB) and economic benefits of the reduced air pollution
concentration were estimated using the value of statistical life (VSL) approach (Etchie et al.
2018; Hu et al., 2015). The VSL represents an individual's willingness to pay for a marginal
reduction in risk of dying. The VSL method has been utilised as a standard approach for
ecosystem service valuation of non-marketable commodities and is often used for cost-benefit
analysis (OECD, 2014; WHO, 2015), ecosystem service studies (Zhang et al., 2018, 2020).
The economic benefits due to avoided premature mortality were estimated as follows:

EBx = HBx  VSLx

Where EBx is the economic benefit attributed to the reduction of air pollution and resulted in

statistical life of the country x that corresponds to the city. Using the value transfer method,
OECD (2016a) estimated the VSL for the entire world, after incorporating income elasticity
beta of 1. Since this study considers cities that cover many diversified economic setup and
development background, a uniform income elastic global VSL estimates measured by Viscusi
et a., (2017) was considered for the economic valuation and subsequent analysis. As cityspecific VSL data is not available for many cities, the VSL estimates for the corresponding
countries were taken for the analysis. The 2017 VSL values were converted to 2020 unit price
for adjusting price fluctuation. The income adjusted VSL was estimated as Belgium (8 $
millions, used this value for Antwerp and Brussels city), Spain (5 $ millions, this value was
used for Barcelona, Madrid), USA (10 $ millions, this value was used for Chicago, Denver,
Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, and Philadelphia), Germany (8 $ millions, this was used value
for Cologne, Frankfurt), UK (8 $ millions, this value was used for London), Italy (6 $ millions,
this value was used for Milan and Turin), France (7 $ millions, this value was used for Paris),
Netherlands (9 $ millions, this value was used for Rotterdam and Utrecht), Brazil (2 $ millions,
this value was used for Sao Paulo), and Iran (1 $ millions, this value was used for Tehran),
respectively (Viscusi et a., 2017) (Table S5).

Due to the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic, countries across the world imposed
mandatory lockdowns to restrict human-mobility. This reduced motorised traffic, which is one
of the key sources of urban air pollution (Chinazzi et al., 2020; De Brouwer et al., 2020).
Human mobility could accelerate the transmission of contagious diseases, especially when a
larger section of daily commuter uses public transport to maintain their essential daily journey
(Sasidharan et al., 2020). Joy et al. and Lara et al. research highlighted a statistically significant
association between human mobility that is mainly attributed to public transport and
transmissions of acute respiratory infections (ARI) (Troko et al., 2011; Goscé and Johansson,
2018). Joy et al. (2011) also found that the use of public transport during a pandemic outbreak
in the UK has increased the risk of ARI infection by six-times. To evaluate the effects of
reduced human mobility on air pollution, this study utilised the human mobility data provided
by Apple and Google. Apple mobility data includes three mobility components, i.e., driving,
walking, and transit (public transport), respectively. The reduction of human mobility during
the lockdown period was calculated from the baseline (13 January). Both positive and negative
changes in human mobility were recorded in percentage form to eliminate calculation bias and
easy comparability across the cities/countries in the world. Among the three mobility
components, driving and transit was considered for the evaluation, and walking was discarded
from the analysis. Google mobility data was also used in this study which has six components
(retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transits, workplace, and residential). This
data is available from 15 February 2020 to recent date. Since Google mobility data is not
available for city scale, the smallest scale (county/state) was taken for the analysis for which
the mobility counts are available. This data is also prepared in percentage format to handle the
calculation bias and better understanding of the data.

Spatial distribution of four key air pollutants, i.e., NO2 (Fig. 1) SO2 (Fig. S1), CO (Fig.
S2), and aerosol concentration (Fig. S3) is analysed for 20 cities across the world. The spatial
distribution of these pollutants was measured from 1 February to May 11 in 2019 and 2020. A
sharp reduction in NO2 and CO emission is observed for all the cities. This could be due to the
lockdown and resultant reduction of transportation and industrial emission. Among the 20
cities, the maximum decrease of NO2 concentration is recorded for the European cities, such
as Paris, Milan, Madrid, Turin, London, Frankfurt, Cologne, and American cities, such as New
York, Philadelphia, etc. (Fig. 1). Moreover, among the 20 cities, the highest NO2 reduction is
recorded in Tehran, and the lowest reduction is found in Los Angeles and Sao Paulo (based on
1st Feb to 11th May pollution data). The SO2 emission is evaluated and presented in Fig. S1.
An incremental trend of SO2 emission is observed during the study period. For most cities, SO2
concentration was increased during the study period. However, for exceptions, a slight decrease
in SO2 emission is observed in Rotterdam, Frankfurt, London, and Detroit cities (Fig. S1). The
spatial distribution of CO is also evaluated using GEE cloud application and Sentinel 5P data
and presented in Fig. S2. The CO emission is reduced significantly in all the 20 cities. The
highest reduction is recorded in Detroit, followed by Barcelona, London, Los Angeles, New

in Cologne, Denver (Fig. S2). The spatial distribution of aerosol concentration is also
calculated and presented in Fig. S3. Aerosol concentration is also found to be decreased during
the COVID lockdown with restricted human activities.

Fig. 2 and Table. 1 shows the average NO2, SO2, CO, and aerosol concentration from
1st Feb to 11th May in 2019 and 2020. Among the 20 cities, the average NO2 concentration was
found highest in Tehran ( 747.1µmol in 2019 and 563.77µmol in 2020), followed by Milan
(257.34µmol in 2019 and 162.52µmol in 2020), New York (242.2µmol in 2019 and
172.31µmol in 2020), Paris (205.95µmol in 2019 and 111.33µmol in 2020), Turin
(204.94µmol in 2019 and 129.46µmol in 2020), Chicago (199.21µmol in 2019 and 139.27µmol
in 2020), Cologne (194.25µmol in 2019 and 132.53µmol in 2020), Philadelphia (187.81µmol
in 2019 and 123.11µmol in 2020), etc. Lowest NO2 concentration was observed in Sao Paulo
(119.88µmol in 2019 and 99.3µmol in 2020), Brussels (160.95µmol in 2019 and 115.96µmol
in 2020), Denver (161.01µmol in 2019 and 107.19µmol in 2020), respectively. Among the 20
cities, the SO2 concentration was found maximum in Chicago (528.26µmol in 2019 and
785.46µmol in 2020), followed by Detroit (465.96µmol in 2019 and 508.61µmol in 2020),
Barcelona (429.21µmol in 2019 and 444.19µmol in 2020), Paris (427.99µmol in 2019 and
484.62µmol in 2020), Philadelphia (422.32µmol in 2019 and 552.96µmol in 2020), London
(415.89µmol in 2019 and 461.82µmol in 2020), etc. While the low SO2 emission was
documented in Sao Paulo (19.34µmol in 2019 and 105.23µmol in 2020), Denver (128.75µmol
in 2019 and 249.18µmol in 2020), Brussels (227.32µmol in 2019 and 347.9µmol in 2020),
Tehran (258.35µmol in 2019 and 258.3µmol in 2020), Los Angeles (264.3µmol in 2019 and
397.61µmol in 2020) (Fig. 2 and Table. 1). The average concentration of CO in different cities
is also evaluated and presented in Fig. 2 and Table. 1. During the study period, the highest CO
concentration is recorded in American cities, i.e., New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago,
Los Angeles, while a comparably low CO concentration is documented for Sao Paulo, Denver,
Madrid, Barcelona, and Brussels (Fig. 2). Except for a few cities, the concentration of NO2,
CO, and aerosol has been reduced substantially (Fig. 3 and Table. 1, Table. 2). For NO2, the
highest reduction was detected in Paris (45.94%), followed by Detroit (40.29%), Milan
(36.85%), Turin (36.83%), Frankfurt (36.36%), Philadelphia (34.45%), London (34.15%), and
Madrid (34.03%), respectively. At the same time, comparably lower reduction of NO2 is
observed in Los Angeles (10.54%), Sao Paulo (17.17%), Antwerp (24.14%), Tehran (24.54%),
and Rotterdam (26.72%), respectively (Fig. 3 and Table. 2). For CO, the maximum reduction
was recorded for New York (4.24%), followed by Detroit (4.09%), Sao Paulo (3.88%),
Philadelphia (3.45%), Milan (3.17%), Barcelona (2.86%), respectively. At the same time, a
positive (increase) changes in CO were observed in Denver (1.92%), Cologne (0.49%), and
Rotterdam (0.01%) (Fig. 3 and Table. 2). The temporal variability of NO2, SO2, CO, and
aerosol concentration is shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. S4, Fig. S5, Fig.S6, Fig. S7, Fig. S8. Both
median and interquartile range (IQR) values in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 suggest that NO2
concentration was decreased substantially. A similar declining pattern is observed for CO for
all the 20 cities considered in this study (Fig. S4, Fig. S5). However, for SO2, an incremental
trend was observed for most of the cities (Fig. S6).

Using the ground monitored data, the daily air quality index (AQI), and a cumulative
number of good AQI days for the six American cities was computed and presented in Fig. 6.
The ground monitored data for these six cities have been considered only for time series
assessment and subsequent interpretation. In all cases, it has been found that AQI is reduced
significantly due to lockdown led reduction in human mobility and traffic emission. In the left
panel, the grey color indicates the five years average AQI and light blue shade demonstrating
the average AQI range in the last 20 years. Based on the AQI ranges, four AQI classes were
characterised, such as good, moderate, unhealthy for sensitive groups, and unhealthy (Fig. 6).
A comparably higher cumulative number of good AQI days is recorded during the lockdown
period for all five cities, except Chicago (Fig. 6). Using the EPA AQI interactive plot function
application, the daily AQI of the US cities were analysed and presented in Fig. 7, Fig. S9, Fig.
S10. The daily NO2 and SO2 AQI suggest that all the cities are benefitted by having good
quality air due to anthropogenic pollution switch-off and restricted human mobility that
collectively improved the air quality ecosystem services in these cities. The multi-year daily
time series plot (Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10) is also indicating the improving status of air quality in
the US cities due to the reduced level of traffic emission. Six distinct color grade is used to
demonstrate the AQI categories. Six different AQI classes, i.e., good, moderate, unhealthy for
sensitive groups, unhealthy, very unhealthy, and hazardous, etc. are also defined to evaluate
the time series AQI status of these cities during the pre-COVID (2000 – 2019) and lockdown
(Jan to May 2020) period. Fig. 8 shows that in all cities, the NO2 AQI status is mostly good
during the lockdown period compared to the long-term average AQI in these cities. Fig. 9
shows the PM2.5 AQI status, which also found improving during the lockdown period. The
higher proportions of good AQI values in all the cities are suggesting improving air quality
(PM2.5) status in Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, and Philadelphia. The
multi-year time series plot was prepared after combining all the pollutants that suggest that the
air quality is improved substantially, which is supported by the lower AQI recorded during the
lockdown period compared to the long-term AQI recorded in these cities. Among the six cities,
the hazardous to very unhealthy air quality is common in Los Angeles, compared to the other
five US cities considered in this study.

Using both Google and Apple human mobility information, the effect of lockdown and
its striking impact on human outdoor activities is measured and presented in Fig. 11, Fig. S12,
Fig. S13, Fig. S14, Fig. S15. The driving and transit mobility was calculated using the Apple
mobility data. Mobility on January 13 was taken as a baseline, and further changes in human
mobility during the lockdown period was calculated from the baseline mobility. The driving
counts reduced most significantly in Paris, followed by Madrid, London, Antwerp, and
Brussels (Fig. 11). Whereas, such changes were comparably lower in Chicago, Cologne,
Denver, Los Angeles, New York (Fig. 11). Transit counts also reduced significantly in Paris,
followed by Utrecht, Sao Paulo, New York, Milan, Chicago, Antwerp, and Brussels (Fig. 11).
Using the Google human mobility records, the changes in different mobility such as retail and
recreation, grocery and pharmacy stores, transit, parks and outdoor, workplace visitor, and time
spent at home were measured. Transport related mobilities were reduced most significantly in
the Latin American countries, followed by a few Middle East and Southeast Asian countries,
and American countries (Fig. S13). Parks and outdoor activities were found to be reduced
maximum in the Latin American countries and South Asian countries. At the same time,

outdoor activities are seen to be increased in a few European countries as well (Fig. S13). The
highest reduction in retail and recreation is found in India, Turkey, UK, and few Latin
American countries due to lockdown and associated restrictive measures. (Fig. S14).
Considering grocery and pharmacy-related mobilities, the highest reduction is being observed
in the Latin American countries and a few European countries. Whereas grocery related
mobility was found to be increased in the USA, few African and European countries (Fig. S14).
Workplace related mobility is reduced significantly in Peru, Bolivia, India, Spain, Turkey,
Saudi Arabia, USA, and Canada (Fig. S15). While such changes were positive in a few African
countries (Mali, Niger, Mozambique, Zambia), Venezuela, and a few island countries (Fig.
S15). Finally, using the Google real-time mobility information, another mobility component,
i.e., time spent at home, was calculated (Fig. S15). As expected, due to lockdown and
mandatory restrictive measures on human activities, people tend to spend more time at home,
which also suggests that at most of the countries have taken timely decisions to control the
pandemic. Except for a few European countries, peoples around the world limited their outdoor
activities, which is supported by the results shown in Fig. S15.

Using both public health and externality valuation approaches, the positive association
between lockdown led the reduction of anthropogenic emissions, and air quality ecosystem
services are analysed and presented in Table. 3, Table. 4, Table. 5, Table. S5. Before
economic valuation, the original externality values for different air pollutants were adjusted
using the latest price inflation conversion factor (Table. 3). These adjusted value coefficients
were later used to calculate the economic value of the air quality ecosystem services for the 20
cities across the world. For the public health valuation method, the estimated economic burden
and economic benefits were also adjusted for eliminating the influence of price inflation in the
valuation. Overall, the per-unit EV was calculated maximum for Sao Paulo (49716 $), New
York (49453 $), Tehran (43624 $), London (38930 $), Detroit (22588 $), Los Angeles (20242
$), Philadelphia (19190 $), Madrid (16413 $), Chicago (13222 $), Milan (10035 $), Frankfurt
(5854 $), Turin (5749 $), Antwerp (5039 $), Paris (4971 $), Barcelona (4117 $), Cologne (3914
$), Rotterdam (3400 $), Brussels (1876 $), and Utrecht (1675 $). At the same time, the
economic burden (both NO2 and CO emission is found higher than the previous year, 2019)
due to NO2 and CO emission was calculated for Denver (-1077 $) (Table. 4).

The population-weighted average concentration (PWAC, µmol m-2) was estimated for
each city and presented in Fig. 12. The highest PWAC values (in 2019) were estimated for
Tehran (512), followed by Milan (183), New York (139), Chicago (139), Turin (139),
Philadelphia (134), Los Angeles (133), Madrid (133), Paris (133), Detroit (127), Cologne
(126), London (125), Frankfurt (122), respectively. Using the public health burden valuation
approach, the highest economic values (derived from public health burden valuation approach
and estimated for 101 days) was estimated for New York (501M $), followed by London (375
M $), Chicago (137M $), Paris (124M $), Madrid (90M $), Philadelphia (89M $), Milan (78

Using the ESA Sentinel 5P TROPOMI air real-time pollution data, the spatiotemporal
concentration of different air pollutants, i.e., NO2, SO2, CO, Aerosol, has been evaluated to
examine the positive effects of COVID-19 lockdown on air quality across the world. Sentinel
5P satellite mission is one of the finest space-borne applications that provide the crucial key
information of air quality, ozone, ultra-violate radiation, and climate monitoring and
forecasting (ESA, 2020). TROPOMI widens the application of the satellite air pollution
observation and works in line with other global missions, i.e., SCIAMACHY (2002–2012),
GOME-2 (since 2007), and OMI (since 2004) (Lorente et al., 2019). This data has been used
for many purposes, including air pollution measurement (Zheng et al., 2019; Borsdorff et al.,
2018; Shikwambana et al., 2020), epidemiological studies (Chen et al., 2020; Dutheil et al.,
2020b; Gautam, 2020; Muhammad et al., 2020; Ogen, 2020; Shehzad et al., 2020); monitoring
global volcano (Valade et al., 2019), demographic analysis (Kaplan and Yigit, 2020),
evaluating sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) (Guanter et al., 2015), estimation of
volcanic sulfur dioxide emission (Theys et al., 2019), etc. In addition, the advent of Google
Earth Engine cloud-based suitability in handling the large volume of spatial data facilitates the
application of satellite images for timely decision making and offering cost-benefit solutions
to many environmental problems. Furthermore, most of the fine to medium scale satellite data
products are free and open access in nature (Woodcock et al., 2008). This suggests that
transferring ideas from place to place would be easy, which eventually establishes more trust
and transparency in applying the scientific findings to solve real-life problems. Evaluating the
reliability of remote sensing data is always a matter of concern. Since this study has evaluated
the air pollution in cities, which itself is very sensitive in nature, proper and careful evaluation
is required to verify the accuracy of satellite estimates to draw a data-driven conclusion that
may use further as a reference in future studies. Many studies across the world have evaluated
the reliability of Sentinel 5P pollution data with ground monitored measurements. Lorente et
al. (2019) have examined the reliability of Sentinel TROPOMI tropospheric column NO2
density with ground monitored (ground monitored NO2 boundary layer height over the Eiffel
Tower was used in this purpose) data and found a very good agreement (R2 = 0.88) between
the two estimates. Griffin et al., (2019) study on validating TROPOMI data with aircraft and
surface in situ NO2 observations over the Canadian oil sands found that the TROPOMI vertical
NO2 column densities are strongly correlated (R2 = 0.86) with the aircraft and ground in situ
NO2 observations with a low bias (15–30 %).

In this study, the spatial and temporal distribution and changes in different air pollution
were measured for different cities across the world. A fixed timeframe (1st February to 11th
May) was considered for the spatial and temporal analysis and subsequent interpretation. For
all the 20 cities, NO2 concentration was found to be decreased with mixed intensities. Due to
the imposition of worldwide lockdown and resulted in anthropogenic emission switch-off, air
pollution across the world has been reduced significantly. Among the countries, the highest

NO2 reduction was observed for Netherlands (70%), Japan (64%), Macao (60%), Lebanon
(55%), Italy (54%), India (54%), Monaco (54%), North Korea (51%), Hungary (50%), and
Kuwait (50%), respectively. While an incremental trend of NO2 emission was found in the
Island countries, i.e., Kiribati (213%), Howland Island (136%), Jarvis Island (129%), Nauru
(93%), Pacific Islands (Palau) (81%) along with other countries such as Indonesia (74%), Nepal
(57%), Mozambique (56%), Norfolk Island (55%), and Jan Mayen (52%), where COVID1-9
lockdown has not implemented or followed strictly (Fig. S11, Table. S2, Table. S3). For CO,
the maximum reduction was observed in Ecuador (6%), Colombia (6%), Venezuela (4%),
Macau (4%), South Korea (4%), North Korea (4%), Byelarus (3%), Singapore (3%), Estonia
(3%), and Latvia (3%), respectively. While, during the lockdown period, an increasing trend
of CO emission was documented for some countries, such as Sao Tome and Principe (14%),
Equatorial Guinea (14%), Gabon (13%), Argentina (13%), Falkland Islands (13%), Uruguay
(12%), Congo (12%), Bouvet Island (11%), and Cameroon (11%), respectively. For both NO2
and CO, the maximum reduction is recorded for the countries which have been strongly
affected by the COVID pandemic. The economic loss due to this exceeding level of air
pollution has also been evaluated in this study. However, in this study, only the median
externality values of the air pollutants are considered for the valuation and subsequent
interpretation. This one dimension and linear valuation approach will not be able to track down
the overall economic impact of air pollution on human life. Therefore, research that broadens
the scope of valuation needs to be initiated for exploring the importance of proper monetary
valuation in environmental studies.

The connection between human mobility and air pollution levels in selected cities were
also examined in this research. Both Apple and Google mobility data were used for this
purpose. Results derived from both the report suggest that due to the mandatory lockdown and
resulted in limited outdoor human activities, mobility has been reduced significantly across the
world. This drastic reduction of human mobility could contribute to the reduced level of air
pollution observed in the last few months. For most of the cities considered in this study, human
mobility has been reduced up to 80% from the baseline mobility. The highest reduction in
mobility was found in the European cities. To prevent infection, the authorities in these cities
implemented preventive measures, which included partial lockdown in different sectors,
including restricted outdoor social activities. This mandatory imposition of lockdown has
resulted in a reduced level of traffic volume in cities (Fig. 11, Table. S6). The mobility analysis
thus suggests that by introducing sustainable transport plans and policies, air pollution in the
urban regions can be minimised to a certain extent. The periodic and temporary lockdown can
also be adopted in the highly polluted cities if no other alternatives are feasible at the place. A
similar strategy has already been adopted by New Delhi Government by introducing
“odd/even” transport scheme where private vehicles with odd digit (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) registration
numbers will be allowed on roads on odd dates and vehicles with even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
registration numbers can use the vehicles on even dates. In addition, the Mahato et al. study
has observed a 40% to 50% improvement in air quality in Delhi within the first week of
lockdown. He et al. (2020) study on short-term impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on urban air
pollution has found that within a week, the AQI in the locked-down cities in China has been
reduced by 19.84 points (PM2.5 goes down by 14.07 µg m−3) compared to the cities where

This study has evaluated the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on air quality ecosystem
services across the world. A total of 20 major cities were considered for the analysis and
subsequent interpretation. Both satellite and ground air pollution data were utilised for
examining the association between COVID pandemic led lockdown and improving status of
air quality ecosystem services across the cities. The major findings of this research are:

1) Among the 20 cities, the average NO2 concentration (1 Feb to 11 May) was found
highest in Tehran, followed by Milan, New York, Paris, Turin, Chicago, Cologne, and
Philadelphia.
2) The lowest NO2 concentration (1 Feb to 11 May) was observed in Sao Paulo, Brussels,
and Denver.

(40.29%), Milan (36.85%), Turin (36.83%), Frankfurt (36.36%), Philadelphia
(34.45%), London (34.15%), and Madrid (34.03%), respectively.
4) While, a comparably lower reduction of NO2 is observed in Los Angeles (10.54%), Sao
Paulo (17.17%), Antwerp (24.14%), Tehran (24.54%), and Rotterdam (26.72%), during
the lockdown period.

The present research has made an effort to investigate the human impact on the natural
environment by taking COVID-19 lockdown and its resultant reduction of air pollution. Both
physical and monetary valuation was carried out to assess the synergic effect of this pandemic
led lockdown on air pollutions at 20 cities across the world. A strong connection between
human interventions and accelerating levels of air pollution was observed in most of these
cities. Both satellite and ground-based estimates are suggesting the positive effect of the limited
human interference on natural environments. Further research in this direction is needed to
explore this synergic association more explicitly.
