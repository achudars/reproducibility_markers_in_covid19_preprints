Abstract
Background: COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease which has been declared a Pandemic
by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020. The Indian public health care
system is already overstretched, and this pandemic is making things even worse. That is why
forecasting cases for India is necessary to meet the future demands of the health infrastructure
caused due to COVID-19.
Objective: Our study forecasts the confirmed and active cases for COVID-19 until July mid,
using time series Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Additionally, we
estimated the number of isolation beds, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and ventilators required
for the growing number of COVID-19 patients.
Methods: We used ARIMA model for forecasting confirmed and active cases till the 15th July.
We used time-series data of COVID-19 cases in India from 14th March to 22nd May. We
estimated the requirements for ICU beds as 10%, ventilators as 5% and isolation beds as 85% of
the active cases forecasted using the ARIMA model.
Results: Our forecasts indicate that India will have an estimated 7,47,772 confirmed cases (95%
CI: 493943, 1001601) and 296,472 active cases (95% CI:196820, 396125) by 15th July. While
Maharashtra will be the most affected state, having the highest number of active and confirmed
cases, Punjab is expected to have an estimated 115 active cases by 15th July. India needs to
prepare 2,52,001 isolation beds (95% CI: 167297, 336706), 29,647 ICU beds (95% CI: 19682,
39612), and 14,824 ventilator beds (95% CI: 9841, 19806).
Conclusion: Our forecasts show an alarming situation for India, and Maharashtra in particular.
The actual numbers can go higher than our estimated numbers as India has a limited testing
facility and coverage.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first human cases of COVID-19 were first reported by
officials in Wuhan City, China, in December 2019. Retrospective investigations by Chinese
authorities have identified human cases with onset of symptoms in early December 2019. While
some of the earliest known cases had a link to a wholesale food market in Wuhan, some did not
(WHO, 2020). The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of the novel
Coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic on 11th March 2020.
This pandemic is spreading very quickly throughout the world, and the number of confirmed
cases reached 6.44 million on 2nd June. Globally, the recovery rate is around 46.7 percent and
case fatality rate of 5.9 percent (Worldometer, 2nd June 2020). On 2nd June, India's confirmed
cases of COVID-19 crossed 2 Lakhs. The recovery rate was 48.31 percent amongst COVID-19
patients. The case fatality rate of COVID-19 in India declined to 2.8 percent on 2nd June in
India. They also told that 73 percent of COVID-19 deaths in India are people with co-morbidities
(Press Information Bureau 2020 c).
In India, the first positive case of COVID-19 was detected on 30th January 2020, in Kerala
(India Today, 2020). With the experience of the overwhelming burden of COVID-19 in Europe
and China, the Government of India implemented a complete nationwide lockdown on 25th
March for 21 days (Press Information Bureau 2020 a). The purpose of the nationwide lockdown
was to contain the spread of the Coronavirus so that the Government could take a multi-prong
strategy: add more beds in its network of hospitals, scale up the production of the testing kits for
COVID-19 and personal protection equipment (PPE) for the health workers. On 3rd June, with
respect to the health infrastructure in the country for the management of COVID-19, 952
dedicated COVID hospitals with 1,66,332 Isolation beds, 21,393 ICU beds, and 72,762 Oxygen
supported beds are available. 2,391 dedicated COVID Health Centres with 1,34,945 Isolation
beds; 11,027 ICU beds and 46,875 Oxygen supported beds have been operationalized. (Press
Information Bureau 2020 c).
A few studies have attempted to predict numbers of confirmed and active cases at the national
and state level for India to assess the burden of COVID-19 in future. Tiwari et al. (2020) made
their prediction for India based on the pattern of China using a machine learning approa0ch.

They predicted that the peak of the cases for India would be attained between the third and fourth
weeks of April 2020 in India. The infection was likely to be controlled by the end of May 2020.
Chakraborty (2020) used a hybrid approach, based on an ARIMA and Wavelet-based forecasting
model, to make short-term forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases in Canada, France,
India, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. The ARIMA model has been used in many studies
for forecasting case count of epidemic diseases based on the time series modelling (Gupta and
Pal 2020; Tandon et al., 2020; Kumar et al. 2020; Perone, 2020).
In India, the healthcare infrastructure is not up to the mark. The number of hospital beds per
1000 population is less than one - it is just one indicator to cite the vulnerable situation of India's
health care systems (World Bank Database). Several studies from countries like China, Italy and
Spain show the requirements of different healthcare facilities required to fight this pandemic.
Guan et al. (2020) in his study on data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, in mainland China through 29th January 2020,
found that 5.0% were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical
ventilation, and 1.4% who died. A study by Lazzerini et al. (2020) for Italy and Spain suggested
that 40–55% of COVID-19 positive cases have been hospitalized, with 7–12% requiring
admission to intensive care units. The COVID-19 Cases in Italy shows that 10–25% of patients
will require ventilation, and some patients will need ventilation for several weeks. Remuzzi et
al., (2020) find that the percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between 1st
March and 11th March 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are
actively infected.
In the Indian scenario, a press release by PIB on 8th May stated that of the total 35,902 active
cases, 4.8 per cent patients are in ICU, 1.1 per cent on ventilators and 3.3 per cent are on oxygen
support (Press Information Bureau 2020 b). With the rising number of cases, it is crucial to
forecast the requirements of healthcare infrastructure like isolation beds, ICU beds and
ventilators at national and state level to make the respective authorities aware of the situation
they might be facing shortly. In this study, we use the well-known ARIMA time-series model to
forecast the confirmed and active cases for India at national and state level. Another objective of
this study is to estimate the requirements of healthcare infrastructure in the future based on the
forecasts of active cases.

2. Data and Methods
2.1 Data
Data on COVID-19 was obtained from the data-sharing portal covid19india.org. Information is
collected on daily confirmed and active cases at the national and state level from 14th March to
22nd May 2020. This dataset provides excel of the patient database, which is used to build a
required time-series. From this dataset, we have used cumulative confirmed and active cases for
India and selected states. Selection of states is based on the criterion that states should have at
least 100 confirmed cases on 3rd May 2020. By using this selection criterion, India and 17 other
states selected which are Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir,
Odisha, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu,
Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal.
2.2 Method
In this study, we applied the ARIMA model to our considered time series data of COVID-19
cases by using R- studio, for forecasting cumulative confirmed and active cases. This model has
been preferred for the time series forecasting in various fields as the model predictions are based
on different parameters. The required parameters for the ARIMA model are (p, d, q) which
evaluate autoregressive term, integrated moving average and past lag term for stationary time
series respectively. The degree of parameters p, d and q are determined based on the partial
Auto-correlation function (PACF), Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test to test the stationary time
series and Complete Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) respectively. These parameters help to
capture overall fluctuations in earlier time-series which helps to predict the future. ARIMA has
some advantages over the other models as it not only captures the overall picture in earlier trend,
but it also provides a 95% confidence interval (CI) for our point estimates.
The model for forecasting future confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 cases is represented
as,

Here, Xt is the predicted number of cumulative confirmed and active COVID-19 cases at tth day;

α1, α2, β1 and β2 are parameters whereas Zt is the residual term for tth day.
Finally, we estimate the requirement of health infrastructure, i.e., the requirement of Intensive
care unit (ICU), Ventilator support, and isolation beds using the following equations based on
forecasted active cases.
Required number of beds = Forecasted active cases at ith day*(85/100)
Required number of ICU = Forecasted active cases at ith day*(10/100)
Required number of Ventilators = Forecasted active cases at ith day*(5/100)
Based on these equations, infrastructure estimates till the mid of July.

3. Results
3.1 ARIMA model fit for confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 in India
Fig 1(a) & 1(b), shows the ARIMA model fitted correlogram for the active and confirmed cases.
In these figures, we see four subfigures which reveal the trend for the earlier and forecasted
values for both confirmed and active cases. Forecasting based on PACF and ACF graphs helps to
determine parameters p and q. Moreover, the best ARIMA model fit is considered having the
lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value.
Fig 1(a) also shows the fitted model for total confirmed cases with ARIMA (2, 3, 3) having low
AIC. With the help of this model, we have predicted future confirmed cases with 95% CI till
15th July 2020. Similarly, for total active cases, we have a suitable model with ARIMA (3, 3, 1)
which helps to predict active cases for the same duration.

3.2 Forecasted Confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 for India:
The analysis result for India in Table 1 and Fig. 2 shows the total confirmed and active cases for
India. It has observed that with time, confirmed cases will increase at a faster rate. India will be
having 5,19,258 confirmed cases (95% CI: 389542, 648794) at June 30 and 7,47,772 confirmed
ed
cases (95% CI: 493943, 1001601) till July 15.
Similarly, based on our forecasts for active cases for India, we found that active cases will be
2,19,793 (95% CI: 162014, 277571) at 30th June and 2,96,472 active cases (95% CI: 196820,
0,
396125) at 15th July. The combined number of recovered and death cases are also increasing
ng
rapidly and are expected to be around 60 percent of total confirmed cases by 15th July based on
our forecasts.

3.3 Forecasted Confirmed cases of COVID-19 for the selected states of India:
nd
Table 2, shows the forecast of confirmed for selected states of India on 15th June, 30th June and
15th July. Our forecasts show that that confirmed cases for states vary a lot from one state to
another. Our forecasts for 15th June for confirmed cases show that Haryana, Punjab and Kerala
ala
will have around 2000 confirmed cases. However, states like Maharashtra 108712 confirmed
ed
cases (95% CI: 89631, 127793), Tamil Nadu 36759 confirmed cases (95% CI: 26703, 46816),

Delhi 26257 confirmed cases (CI: 20794, 31720) & Gujarat 22860 confirmed cases (95% CI:
18187, 27533) would have a high number of confirmed cases at the 15th June. On 30th June,
only Haryana and Punjab will be having around 2000 confirmed cases based on our forecasts.
Though, states like Maharashtra 149072 confirmed cases (95% CI: 109237, 188908), Tamil
Nadu 54263 confirmed cases (95% CI: 31834, 76692), Delhi 34968 confirmed cases (95% CI:
24090, 45847) & Gujarat 28852 confirmed cases (95% CI: 19770, 37934) will have to occur
confirmed cases on 30th June. On 15th July, Punjab will be having the least number of
confirmed cases around 4000 confirmed cases. However, other states like Maharashtra 189433
confirmed cases (95% CI: 124301, 254565), Tamil Nadu 74637 confirmed cases (95% CI:
35282, 113991), Delhi (43680 confirmed cases (95% CI: 26271, 61089) & Bihar 38027
confirmed cases (95% CI: 14862, 61192) will have a high number of confirmed cases at the 15th
July.
3.4 Forecasted active cases of COVID-19 for the selected states of India:
Table 3 shows the state-wise active cases for India. On 15th June, Punjab, Kerala and Andhra
Pradesh will be having less than 1000 active cases based on our forecasts. However, states like
Maharashtra (67984 active cases (95% CI: 56127, 79840)), Delhi (10907 active cases (95% CI:
5590, 16224)) & Tamil Nadu (8534 active cases (95% CI: 0, 21421)) will have a high number of
active cases on the 15th June.
On 30th June, Haryana, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala will be having fewer than 2000
active cases based on our forecasts. However, states like Maharashtra (91428 active cases (95%
CI: 67487, 115639), Delhi (13840 active cases (95% CI: 3386, 24294) & Bihar (11680 active
cases (95% CI: 3864, 19496) will have a high number of active cases on the 30th June. On 15th
July, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala will be having under 2000 active cases based on our
forecasts. However, states like Maharashtra (114873 active cases (95% CI: 76308, 153438),
Bihar (17479 active cases (95% CI: 2997, 31961) & Delhi (16773 active cases (95% CI: 142,
33404) will have a high number of active cases on 15th July.
3.5 Estimates of required healthcare infrastructure for India
Table 4, 5, and 6 show the required number of isolation beds, ICU beds and ventilators for
active cases of COVID-19 on 15th June, 30th June and 15th July, respectively for India. The

total number of isolation beds required is 130500 (95% CI: 107894, 153106). It also shows that
15353 ICU beds (95% CI: 12693, 18012) and 7676 ventilators (95% CI: 6347, 9006) will be
required in India by 15th June. On 30th June. The total number of isolation beds required for
India is 186824 (95% CI: 137712, 235935). It also shows that 21979 ICU beds (95% CI: 16201,
27757) and 10990 ventilators (95% CI: 8101, 13879) will be required in India by 30th June.
India will require 252001 isolation beds (95% CI: 167297, 336706), 29647 ICU beds (95% CI:
19682, 39612) and 14824 ventilators (95% CI: 9841, 19806) on July 15.
3.6 Estimates of required healthcare infrastructure at state-level
Table 4, 5, and 6 show the required number of isolation beds, ICU beds and ventilators for
patients that will be suffering from COVID-19 on 15th, 30th June and 15th July respectively for
Indian states. The overall picture for estimates shows a huge variation across the states. By 15th
June, Kerala, Haryana, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh will recover most of the active cases and
requires less than 1000 isolation beds, around 100 ICU beds and 50 ventilator beds according to
our point estimates. While, on the other hand, Maharashtra, with the largest number of active
cases shows an alarming situation and will require 57786 isolation beds (95% CI: 47708, 67864),
6798 ICU beds (95% CI: 5613, 7984) and 3399 ventilator beds (95% CI: 2806, 3992).
At the end of June month, Kerala, Haryana, Punjab, Odisha, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will
require less than 2000 isolation beds, under 200 ICU beds and less than 100 ventilator beds.
While, in Maharashtra, will require 77714 isolation beds (95% CI: 57364, 98064), 9143 ICU
beds (95% CI: 6749, 11537) and 4571 ventilator beds (95% CI: 3374, 5768).
At the mid of July, Kerala, Haryana, Punjab, Odisha, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will require
less than 2000 isolation beds, around 200 ICU beds and 100 ventilator beds. While, on the other
hand, Maharashtra, with the largest number of active cases and will require 97642 isolation beds
(95% CI: 64862, 130422), 11487 ICU beds (95% CI: 7631, 15344) and 5744 ventilators (95%
CI: 3815, 7672) will be required by 15th July.
4. Discussion and Conclusion
Our current forecasts for confirmed and active cases are in line with the actual number of cases.
On 2nd June, India has 207,186 confirmed cases, while our forecasts suggested 206,764
confirmed cases (95% CI: 194194, 219334). India had 101,070 active cases on 2nd June, while

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.17.20104588; this version posted June 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

our forecasts suggested that India will have 104,526 active cases (95% CI: 96145, 112907). Our
results also show that daily confirmed cases will increase at a faster pace as around mid-July
India will be getting around 16,000-17,000 daily confirmed cases. By 15th July, we forecast that
the total confirmed cases will be around 7.5 lakhs, whereas total active cases will be close to 2.96
lakhs based on our point estimates for India. Maharashtra will be the most affected state even at
the 15th July with 1.9 Lakh confirmed cases and 1.15 Lakh active cases while Punjab will be
least affected having 2648 confirmed cases and only 115 active cases based on our point
estimates. The total number of isolation beds required for India is 2,52,001 (95% CI: 167297,
336706). Our estimates also show that 29,647 ICU beds (95% CI: 19682, 39612) and 14,824
ventilators (95% CI: 9841, 19806) will be required in India by the 15th July. When it comes to
states, Maharashtra will be the most affected state and will require 97,642 isolation beds (95%
CI: 64862, 130422).
On 3rd June, with respect to the health infrastructure in the country for the management of
COVID-19, 952 dedicated COVID hospitals with 1,66,332 Isolation beds, 21,393 ICU beds and
72,762 Oxygen supported beds are available. 2,391 dedicated COVID Health Centres with
1,34,945 Isolation beds; 11,027 ICU beds and 46,875 Oxygen supported beds have also been
operationalized. Based on the current preparedness of the Indian healthcare infrastructure, it
seems likely that India will not be facing a shortage at the national level. However, the health
infrastructure stress will likely be acute in high-burden states, led by Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu
and Delhi as they have more than 10,000 active cases on 2nd June. In particular, Maharashtra is
the most affected state with around 40,000 active cases as on 2nd June. On 29th May,
BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) reported that almost all intensive care unit (ICU)
beds for COVID-19 patients were occupied in Mumbai. They also tell that the city is already
using 72% of the total 373 ventilators available for COVID-19 treatment (Mint, 2020). This
shows an alarming situation for Maharashtra and in particular, Mumbai. The most affected state
Maharashtra needs to prepare at least 1 lakh isolation beds, 12,000 ICU beds and 6000
ventilators by 15th July to fight this pandemic efficiently.
Our forecasts are based on the data which grossly under-reported the cases as found by many
studies for India. Rao et al., (2020), projected that India might be detecting 1 out of 4 cases of
COVID-19 based on his mathematical model. Another study by (Goli and James, 2020) also find

that India is detecting just 3.6% of the total number of infections of COVID-19 with a huge
variation across its states. They also suggest that India must increase its testing capacity and go
for widespread testing to know the real picture of the pandemic. Lack of coverage of testing is
not revealing the true prevalence of COVID-19. (Subramanian and James, 2020) suggested that
for detection of the true prevalence of COVID-19 infections in the country, India can adopt the
well-established National Family Health Survey (NFHS) framework as a solution to ascertain the
true prevalence of COVID-19. Understanding the urgency of the situation, on 8th May, The
Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) announced that it will conduct a study in 75
affected districts across the country to identify people who were exposed to the novel
coronavirus infection and yet showed mild or no symptoms. The study can help ascertain
whether there has been community transmission of the respiratory disease in those areas or not.
This much-needed study by ICMR will reveal the true prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19
infected people to check for community spread (The Economic Times, 2020). The data issues of
COVID-19 such as under-reporting, lack of coverage etc. results in an underestimation of the
cases, which in turn will lead to underestimation of the forecasts in our study.
Our forecasts show an alarming situation for India in the future. In coming months, the actual
numbers can go higher than our forecasts of confirmed cases, active cases and healthcare
infrastructure as migrant workers are returning home in large numbers currently in large numbers
(Tyagi et al., 2020). Currently, India has lifted lockdown with restrictions applying only on the
containment zones. This will lead to a surge in the number of daily confirmed and active cases.
The requirement of isolation beds, ICUs and ventilators will also be increased in that scenario.
So, India and its majorly affected states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Delhi
need to be well prepared for the pandemic challenge in future and focus on increasing their
healthcare infrastructure, and other states should also remain alert till the pandemic completely
recedes.
