Abstract
One-step RT-qPCR is the most widely applied method for COVID-19 diagnostics.
Designing in-house one-step RT-qPCR kits is restricted by the patent-rights for the
production of enzymes and the lack of information about the components of the
commercial kits. Here, we provide a simple, economical, and powerful one-step RTqPCR kit based on patent-free, specifically-tailored versions of Moloney Murine
Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase and Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase
termed the R3T (Rapid Research Response Team) One-step RT-qPCR. Our kit was
routinely able to reliably detect as low as 10 copies of the synthetic RNAs of the SARSCoV-2. More importantly, our kit successfully detected COVID-19 in clinical samples
of broad viral titers with similar reliability and selectivity as that of the Invitrogen
SuperScript™ III Platinum™ One-step RT-qPCR and TaqPath™ 1-Step RT-qPCR kits.
Overall, our kit has shown robust performance in both of laboratory settings and the
Saudi Ministry of Health-approved testing facility.

Introduction
In December 2019, an outbreak of a new syndrome characterized by serious
symptoms including fever, severe respiratory illness, and acute pneumonia eventually
leading to respiratory failure and death was reported in Wuhan city of Hubei province
in China. This disease swiftly spread out across the globe resulting in unprecedented
preventive measures worldwide

1-2

. On January 7th, 2020, the Chinese health

authorities confirmed that this recently discovered syndrome was associated with a
new member of the coronavirus (CoV) family closely related to a group of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV)

3-4

. On February 11th, the World

Health Organization (WHO) designated the name “coronavirus disease 2019”
abbreviated as (COVID-19) to this highly contagious disease and declared it as
pandemic (http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronaviruscovid-19/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov). As of July 2020, COVID-19 resulted in nearly
15.1

million

confirmed

cases

including

over

620,000

fatalities

globally

(https://www.covidvisualizer.com).
The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the new strain (SARS-CoV-2) classified
under genus Betacoronavirus (β-CoV) and subgenus Sarbecovirus 5-6. Large numbers
of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in bats, which
are their natural hosts 7-9. SARS-CoV-2 is 96 % identical at the whole genome level to
bat CoV and shares 79.6 % sequence identity to SARS-CoV 5. Coronaviruses are
characterized by large, single-stranded (ss), positive-sense RNA genomes ranging
from 26 to 32 kilo bases (kb)

10

. Coronaviruses express their replication and

transcription complexes, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), from a
single large open reading frame referred to as ORF1ab

comprised of four main structural proteins; Spike (S), Membrane (M), Envelope (E),
and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins 12-13.
A contemporary concern of the COVID-19 pandemic is the need for readily
accessible, accurate, efficient and cost-effective diagnostic testing for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 and its associated antibodies in infected individuals. To this end,
laboratories, universities, and companies around the world have been racing to
develop and produce critically needed test kits. Currently, commercially available
COVID-19 detection kits can be broadly divided into viral and antibody tests. The viral
test relies on biomolecular assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques or nucleic acid hybridizationrelated strategies. The antibody test is based on serological and immunological
assays that primarily detect antibodies produced by individuals as a result of exposure
to the virus. Viral diagnostic tests are quite useful and informative as compared to
serological methods, which are feasible only after antibodies have been produced and
only provide information about previous infection and not on the current status of the
virus in the patient 14-15. Therefore, PCR-/nucleic acid hybridization-based techniques
including reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) 1618

, CRISPR-based assays 19-21, Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) 22

remain in pratice the most widely applied methods for the detection of RNA viruses.
Thanks to its sensitivity, specificity, reliability, and multiplexity, RT-qPCR is currently
the gold standard for identifying the presence of SARS-CoV-2

5, 23-24

. In the present

work-flow at the point-of-care diagnostics, there are two adopted schemes, one-step
and two-step RT-qPCR (Figure 1). In the one-step RT-qPCR assay, RT and qPCR
reactions can be performed within the same experimental setup. Therefore, the
operator can mix all the necessary components at the beginning of the reaction, set

the appropriate thermal cycle program in the qPCR machine, and analyse the data.
Because of the minimal experimental handling, this platform is the best suited for highthroughput screening environment within a fully automated work-flow. On the other
hand, two-step RT-qPCR is a method that combines two separate RT and qPCR
reactions. Because each reaction is spatially separated, two-step RT-qPCR gives
better control over several experimental parameters; such as the size of RT reaction,
i.e. when the yield of cDNA need to be increased the starting RNA material can be
incremented; the adjustability of cDNA template amount, i.e. flexible amounts of cDNA
can be added within the dynamic range of qPCR quantitation; multiple usages of
cDNAs, i.e. multi-genes can be quantified from a single cDNA template. Several
commercial companies (Invitrogen, Applied Biosystems, Takara Bio, Bioline, Qiagen,
etc.) have developed one-step RT-qPCR kits that can be used in combination with
TaqMan probe hydrolysis technology (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The onestep RT-qPCR kit along with TaqMan probe system is the recommended platform for
use by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
(http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html).
Notwithstanding, the facts that one-step RT-qPCR is well-suited for the
diagnosis of COVID-19 and that there are many commercially available one-step RTqPCR kits in the market, their high cost and unavailability due to airport closures and
shipment restriction became a major bottleneck that had driven the desire to produce
the key components of such kits locally. However, designing in-house one-ste RTqPCR kits is hampered by the patent-rights for the production of such enzymes and
the lack of information about the components of the commercial kits. In this study, we
successfully assembled the R3T One-step RT-qPCR kit by purifying two patent-free
enzymes; 1) Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase (MMLV-RT), 2)

Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (Taq Pol). MMLV-RT is a 75 kDa RNAdependent DNA polymerase that lacks DNA endonuclease activity and has a lower
RNase H activity 25-28. MMLV-RT is commonly used to synthesize cDNA from ssRNA,
ssDNA, or RNA: DNA hybrid templates 28. Taq Pol is a 94 kDa DNA-dependent-DNA
polymerase that harbours the 5’–3’ but not 3’–5’ exonuclease activity

29

. The unique

5’–3’ exonuclease activity of Taq Pol cleaves the dual-labeled probe annealed to the
target sequence on cDNAs and releases the fluorescent reporter dye, thus recovers
its flourecence after it has been quenched by the quencher, making TaqMan probe
system ideal reporter in the qPCR reactions.
We used tagged proteins for both Taq Pol (His-Taq Pol) and MMLV-RT
(C-His/Strep MMLV-RT) to enhance the expression in E. coli and Sf9 cells,
respectively, and to make use of the affinitiy chromatography in the protein
purification procedures. Purified MMLV-RT is robust enough and supports cDNA
synthesis at comparable levels to that of commercially available reverse
transcriptases. Our non-hot-start Taq Pol also performs robust amplification in
the one-step RT-qPCR platform. By optimizing the reaction buffer besides
detemining the optimal amounts of Taq Pol and MMLV-RT used in the one-step
RT-qPCR reaction, we circumvent the previously reported inhibition of Taq Pol
by reverse transcriptase and therefore sustain the one-step RT-qPCR reaction
30

. The detection, sensitivity and dynamic range of our R3T One-step RT-qPCR

kit (TaqMan probe hydrolysis technology) were evaluated using ten-fold serial
dilutions of the standard Twist Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The lowest practical
detection limit was approximately 10 transcript copies per reaction. In addition, we
assessed the performance of our kit using a concise panel of nasopharyngeal swabs
of clinical samples from different COVID-19 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-

CoV-2 infection ranging from low to high Ct values. All the samples successfully tested
positive with our kit using CDC-verified N1, N2 and RNaseP primer/TaqMan-probe.
As a negative control, samples collected during the course of the outbreak from the
suspected Saudi patients who were confirmed negative from SARS-CoV-2 infection
also tested negative by our kit. Therefore, we conclude here that our R3T One-step
RT-qPCR kit can be successfully implemented for routine diagnostics of SARS-CoV2.

Materials and Methods
Expression and purification of Taq Pol
The full-length gene of Taq Pol in pENTR-Taq vector was transferred to our homemade pColdDest vector using Gateway LR reaction (Thermofisher). The resulting
plasmid was termed pColdDest-His-Taq (Figure 2B). The expression plasmid of HisTaq Pol was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli strain, and cells were grown in 10 L
LB medium to an OD600 of 0.8. The overexpression of His-Taq Pol was induced by 1.0
mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 16 ˚C for 16 hours. The cells
were then harvested by centrifugation at 5,500 xg for 15 minutes, re-suspended in
Buffer A [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 10 % (v/v) Glycerol, 0.5 %
NP-40], and incubated on ice with Lysozyme at 1 mg/mL final concentration for 60
minutes. The cells were disrupted by two cycles of sonication (35 % amplitude, 10
second on/off cycle for 5 minutes). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at
22,040 xg for 30 minutes, and the clear supernatant was collected and incubated at
75 ˚C for 15 minutes to denature the endogenous proteins from E. coli. The heatdenatured solution was then cooled down quickly on ice and centrifuged at 96,000 xg
for 45 minutes to remove the denatured proteins. The decanted supernatant was

filtered through a 0.45 µM pore size filter and directly loaded onto the His-Trap HP 5
mL (GE Healthcare) column pre-equilibrated with Buffer B [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),
0.5 M NaCl] + 20 mM Imidazole. The column was then washed with 20 column
volumes (CVs) of Buffer B. The proteins were eluted by 20 CV gradient against Buffer
B + 500 mM Imidazole. The peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the HisTaq Pol containing-fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight in Buffer C [20 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA]. The dialyzed sample was then loaded
onto the HiTrap SP 5 mL (GE Healthcare) column pre-equilibrated with Buffer C. The
proteins were eluted by 20 CV gradient against Buffer D [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 1
mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl]. The peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and pooled,
and the fractions carrying pure His-Taq Pol were dialyzed against Buffer E [50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 % Tween-20, 0.5 %
NP-40, 50 % (v/v) Glycerol]. The dialyzed samples were stored in –20 ˚C.
Expression and purification of MMLV-RT
The full-length gene of MMLV-RT with cleavable TEV-8xHis-Strep tag at the Cterminus was cloned into the pDEST8 plasmid as previously described 31. The plasmid
was designated as pDEST8-MMLVRT-TEV-His8-Strept. The C-His/Strep MMLV-RT
expression plasmid was then transformed into DH10Bac cells (Life Technologies) to
prepare the bacmid DNA for the transfection of Sf9 insect cells. The Sf9 cells were
cultured in ESF 921 medium (Expression Systems) at 27°C with continuous shaking
at 80 rpm for aeration. To prepare the baculovirus, the C-His/Strep MMLV-RT bacmid
DNA was subsequently transfected into Sf9 cells using FuGENE® HD reagent
(Promega) per manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting supernatant was collected
as P1 virus stock then amplified to obtain P2 virus stock, which was further amplified

to generate P3 virus stock for large-scale expression. The expression of C-His/Strep
MMLV-RT then proceeded by transfecting 8 L of Sf9 suspension culture at a density
of 2 × 106 cells/mL with P3 virus. After 55 hours post transfection with P3 virus, the
cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,500 ×g for 10 minutes. The cell pellet was
re-suspended in 3 mL per 1 g of wet cells in Buffer F [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM
NaCl, 0.1 % NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM EDTA, 5% (v/v) Glycerol, and EDTA-free
protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche, UK) at 1 tablet per 50 mL lysis buffer]. All
the later steps were performed at 4 ˚C, where the suspended cells were sonicated,
and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 185,511 xg for 1 hour at 4 °C.
The clear lysate was directly loaded onto the HisTrap Excel 5 mL affinity column
(GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with Buffer G [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM
NaCl, 0.1 % NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 5 % (v/v) Glycerol]. The column was then washed
with 10 CVs of Buffer G followed by washing with another 10 CVs of Buffer G + 25
mM Imidazole. Finally, the bound proteins were eluted by 10 CV gradient against
Buffer G + 500 mM Imidazole. The peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight
against Buffer H [100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 5 % (v/v)
Glycerol]. The dialyzed sample was then loaded onto the StrepTrap XT 5 mL column
(GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with Buffer H. The column was then washed with 10
CVs of Buffer H and eluted by 10 CVs of Buffer H + 50 mM biotin. Fractions containing
C-His/Strep MMLV-RT were pooled, dialyzed overnight against storage Buffer I
[20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 0.01 % NP-40, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 % (v/v)
Glycerol], then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. The protein
concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using an
extinction coefficient calculated based on the amino acid sequence of the protein.

PCR reaction
The PCR reactions by Taq Pol were performed in reaction buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.4), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 µM dNTPs] besides various amounts of
ammonium sulfate and MMLV-RT. pUC19 vector (Invitrogen) was used as a template
to amplify the ampicillin resistance gene with the following primers: 5’TTACCAATGCTTAATCAGTGAGGCACC-

3’

and

5’-

ATGAGTATTCAACATTTCCGTGTCGCCC-3’. The heating and cooling program used
for the PCR reactions involves; pre-denaturation for 2 minutes at 94 ˚C followed by
cycling composed of the three steps: denaturation for 15 seconds, annealing for 15
seconds at 94 ˚C, and extension for 1 minute at 68 ˚C. The cycle is then repeated for
29 times.
Determination of the unit of Taq Pol’s activity
The unit of Taq Pol’s activity was determined based on the standard titeration curve
of native Taq Pol’s activity (Thermofisher) (Supplementary Figure 1). Serial dilutions
of native Taq Pol (5 U, 2.5 U, 1 U, 0.5 U, and 0.25 U) were used for PCR reactions.
The PCR products were analyzed on 1 % agarose gel, and the gel images were
captured by iBright Imaging System (Thermofisher). The intensities of the bands
corresponding to 862 bp, which is the gene size of ampicillin resistance in pUC19,
were quantified by iBright Analysis Software (Thermofisher). The unit of His-Taq Pol’s
activity was determined by interpolation from the standard curve using Prism8
software (GraphPad).

The reaction mixture containing 1 µL of RNA template (106 copies/µL of SARS-CoV-2
N gene RNA), 2 µL of random hexamers (3 µM), 1 µL of dNTPs (0.5 mM), and 4 µL of
dH2O was heated to 65 ˚C for 5 minutes followed by immediate cooling by placing on
ice for more than 1 minute. After the sample tubes were centrifuged briefly, 4 µL of 5x
RT buffer, 4 µL of dH2O, 2 µL of DTT (10 mM), and 1 µL of RNaseOUT (2 units)
(Invitrogen Cat No 10777019) were added, and the mixture was further incubated at
room temperature for 2 minutes. Then 1 µL of enzymes was added to the respective
reaction of either MMLV-RT, ProtoScript® II (New England Labs, Cat No M0368), NEB
AMV (New England Labs, Cat No M0277), Superscript II (Invitrogen, Cat. No
18064022), or Superscript III (Invitrogen, Cat. No 18080093). The final reaction
mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes, followed by incubation
at 42 ˚C for 50 minutes then by heat inactivation at 70 ˚C for 15 minutes. Lastly, 5 units
of thermostable RNase H (New England Biolabs, Cat. No M0523S) were added and
incubated at 37 ˚C for 20 minutes to hydrolyze RNA. The resulting cDNAs were
subjected to RT-PCR assays with 2019-nCoV_N3 primers (IDT, Cat. No 10006770).
The RT-PCR reactions were performed on CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection
System (BioRad) using IQ Multiplex Powermix (Bio-Rad, Cat. No 172-5849) and the
following program; pre-denaturation at 95 ˚C for 2 minutes followed by 45 cycles of
denaturation at 95 ˚C for 5 seconds and by annealing/extension at 59 ˚C for 30
seconds.
Primer and probe sets
The CDC designed RT-qPCR assay primer and probe set (2019-nCoV CDC EUA kit,
Cat. No. 10006606) was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). The kit
contains research-use-only primer and probe sets based on the protocol released by

CDC (hereafter called CDC assay). The CDC assay includes three sets of the primers
and probe labeled with 5´ FAM dye and 3´ Black Hole Quencher® (BHQ).
DNA/RNA positive controls
The 2019-nCoV-N-Positive Control (IDT, Cat. No. 10006625) is composed of plasmids
containing the complete N gene (1,260 base pairs) of SARS-CoV-2. The Hs-RPP30
Positive Control (IDT, Cat. No. 10006626) contains a portion of the ribonuclease P30
subunit (RPP30) gene of the human genome. The control SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA
sequences used for constructing RNA titration curves were synthetic RNAs from six
sequence variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Twist Bioscience). The dried stock was
re-suspended in 100 µL of 1X TE Buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)]
to make a stock of 1x106 RNA copies/µL.
Clinical Specimen and RNA extraction
One group of nasopharyngeal swabs (N = 23) was collected from COVID-19
suspected patients in Ministry of Health hospitals in the Western region in Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia. The swabs were placed in 2 mL screw capped cryotubes containing 1
mL of TRIzol (Ambion) for inactivation and transport to King Abdullah University of
Science and Technology (KAUST) for further downstream applications. The sample
tubes were sprayed with 70 % ethanol, and RNAs were extracted within 2 hours using
the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research) per the manufacturer’s instructions,
along with several optimizations to improve the quality and quantity of the extracted
RNAs from clinical samples. The optimization also included extending the TRIzol
incubation period and the addition of chloroform during the initial lysis step to obtain
the aqueous RNA layer. The quality control of purified RNAs was performed using the

SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, we performed one-step RT-qPCR using primers and
probes from the 2019-nCOV CDC EUA Kit produced by IDT (Cat. No. 10006606) or
the TaqPathTM COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR Kit (Cat. No. A48067). The 2019-nCOV
CDC EUA kit contains three sets; each is comprised of two primers and one probe:
two sets for the viral nucleocapsid gene (N1 and N2) and one set for the human RNase
P

gene,

according

to

the

of

the

panel

(https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download). The TaqPathTM COVID-19 CE-IVD
RT-PCR kit contains TaqPathTM COVID-19 Assay Multiplex, which has primers and
probes for Gene ORF1ab, N Protein, S Protein, and MS2. Briefly, the reaction mixture
of a total 20 μL reaction volume was constituted of 10 μL of 2X reaction buffer mix, 1
μL of His-Taq Pol/C-His/Strep MMLV-RT enzyme mix, 1μL of probe/primer mix, 1 or
2 μL of RNA and nuclease-free water to reach to the final volume. The one-step RTqPCR was performed in ABI 7500 and 7900 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems, USA) for the side-by-side comparison with the Invitrogen SuperScript™

Results
Expression and purification of histidine-tagged Taq polymerase
The expression and purification of the native form of Taq Pol was established in 1991
32

. To make both expression and purification processes straightforward, we devised

Taq Pol with N-terminal histidine-tag (His-Taq Pol) under the control of the cold-shock
promoter. The construct layout of the expression vector for His-Taq Pol is depicted in
Figure 2B. The procedures for the expression and purification of His-Taq Pol are
outlined in Figure 2A and described in detail in the Materials and Methods section.
With our new construct, we can precisely control the induction and expression level
by adjusting IPTG concentration and varying the temperature. As shown in Figure 2C,
we observed a noticeable overexpression of His-Taq Pol in comparison to the
endogenous E. coli proteins by incubating at 16 ˚C with 1 mM IPTG final concentration.
In contrast, we did not detect such enhancement for the expression of native Taq Pol
(N-Taq Pol) under the control of pET vector system (data not shown). Tagging at the
N-terminus with histidines also enabled us to eliminate the time-consuming
polyethylenimine precipitation steps in the previous purification protocol

without

affecting the purity of the final product. As shown in Figure 2C, the purity of the His-

Taq Pol was comparable to that of the commercially available N-Taq Pol. Owing to
the improved expression level of Taq Pol, as illustrated by the final yield of the purified
protein from 1 L E. coli culture (Figure 2E), we successfully obtained 0.98 mg of pure
protein equivalent to ~$105,000 in market value.
Expression and purification of double His- and Strep-tagged MMLV-RT
Next, we expressed a C-terminal double His- and Strep-tagged MMLV-RT (CHis/Streo MMLV-RT) protein in insect cells (Sf9) using the baculovirus expression
system (Figure 2B). The expression and purification protocols are outlined in Figure
2A and described in detail in the Materials and Methods section. Previous study
demonstrated that C-His/Strep MMLV-RT exhibits higher activity compared to the Nterminal tagged one (N-His/Strep MMLV-RT), where both proteins were produced in
the silkworms using the silkworm-baculovirus expression vector system (silkwormBEVS)

31

. Therefore, we opted for the expression and purification of the C-His/Strep

MMLV-RT from Sf9 cell suspension culture in order to obtain homogenous proteins by
implementing the previously established protocol 31. The final products were assessed
to be more than 95 % pure (Figure 2D). Remarkably, the closing yields of the purified
proteins are around 7.5 mg per 1 L insect cell culture, i.e. 7.6 times more than that of
His-Taq Pol expressed in E. coli. These results suggest that the C-terminus Histidine
and Strep double-affinity tagged system enhanced the expression of C-His/Strep
MMLV-RT in Sf9 cells. Moreover, two consecutive steps of affinity chromatography
resulted in minimal loss of the proteins during the purification. Since both the native
form and C-His/Strep MMLV-RT showed the same RT activity

31

, we omitted the

cleavage step of the TEV tag in favor of achieving higher final yield of C-His/Strep
MMLV-RT.

Activity assays of Taq Pol and MMLV-RT
In order to evaluate the activities of both His-Taq Pol and C-His/Strep MMLV-RT, we
performed PCR for His-Taq Pol and the reverse transcriptase assay for C-His/Strep
MMLV-RT (Figure 3A and 3B, respectively). The relatively high concentration of
detergents, i.e. 0.5 % NP-40 and Tween-20, in the storage buffer of Taq Pol hindered
the accurate determination of its concentration based on UV absorbance
measurement due to the high background. Therefore, we decided to determine the
protein amount through measuring its PCR amplification activity relative to commercial
N-Taq Pol (Invitrogen) (see Materials and Methods). We determined the optimal
dilution factor by the storage buffer for purified His-Taq Pol to be 160 times. The
dilution circumvents the inhibitory effect of high concentration of His-Taq Pol on its
own PCR amplification activity (Figure 3A). We also constructed a standard titration
curve of the activity of N-Taq Pol versus enzyme unit (Supplementary Figure 1),
enabling us to define and calculate the unit of our purified His-Taq Pol’s catalytic
activity (310 units/µL). We also assessed the activity of our purified C-His/Strep
MMLV-RT using two-step RT-qPCR in comparison to various commercially-available
reverse transcriptases (Figure 3B).

The activity of a fixed amount of 200 units

containing approximately 1,000 ng enzyme from each commercial reverse
transcriptase preparation was compared to that of variable quantities of C-His/Strep
MMLV-RT. We found that the activity of our C-His/Strep MMLV-RT within the range
of 250-1,000 ng was almost consistent to SuperScript II, NEB Protoscript II, and NEB
AMV-RT. Collectively, we confirmed that our purified His-Taq Pol and C-His/Strep
MMLV-RT are competent for the PCR and reverse transcription reactions. From now
onwards, we will quantify our purified His-Taq Pol in units and C-His/Strep MMLV-RT
in nanograms (ng).

Inhibitory effect of MMLV-RT on Taq Pol
To perform two distinct reactions within the same tube, the two enzymes, Taq Pol and
MMLV-RT, should work simultaneously, collaboratively, or at least independently
without inhibiting one another. However, it was reported by Sellner et al. that MMLVRT inhibits the activity of Taq Pol in the PCR reaction 30. To assess the magnitude of
the inhibitory effect of MMLV-RT on the Taq Pol’s activity, we performed PCR
reactions at varying portions of C-His/Strep MMLV-RT relative to His-Taq Pol (Figure
3C).

Per manufacturer’s instructions, the recommended quantity of the reverse

transcriptase to synthesize cDNA from total RNAs with dT or random hexamer primers
is 200 units (1 µg). Therefore, we started by using 500 ng of C-His/Strep MMLV-RT in
combination with the range of 2.5-20 units of His-Taq Pol and gradually decreased the
amount of C-His/Strep MMLV-RT in the reaction. We found that C-His/Strep MMLVRT at 100 ng or more completely inhibits the Taq Pol’s activity even at 20 units of HisTaq Pol. However, by reducing the amount of C-His/Strep MMLV-RT to 40 ng, its
inhibitory effect could be overcome by using 20 units of His-Taq Pol. SDS-PAGE
analysis of the samples after the reaction showed that the two enzymes remained
separate with no apparent cross-linking interaction (Supplementary Figure 2).
Furthermore, using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis to evaluate the
physical interaction between His-Taq Pol and C-His/Strep MMLV-RT, we could not
detect any molecular-size shift in the presence of the two enzymes (Supplementary
Figure 3). These results suggest that MMLV-RT hampers the Taq Pol’s activity with a
mechanism other than physical interaction. In conclusion, to overcome the inhibitory
effect of MMLV-RT on the Taq Pol’s activity, we found that 40 ng MMLV-RT to be the
maximum tolerable amount when using 20 units of Taq Pol. Therefore, we decided

the mixing ratio to be 2 ng MMLV-RT to 1 unit Taq Pol for subsequent buffer
optimization experiments.
Optimizing buffer components to support one-step RT-qPCR reaction
We also investigated the salt composition of the buffer to further improve the Taq Pol’s
activity in the PCR reaction with MMLV-RT. We opted for ammonium sulfate as
additional salt and tested different concentrations in the PCR reactions (Figure 3D).
We found that the intensity of the PCR product bands gradually increased up to 20
mM of ammonium sulfate followed by decrease at higher concentration of ammonium
sulfate due to the suppression of the His-Taq Pol’s activity. Another important
parameter for the determination of the optimal buffer composition for the one-step RTqPCR reaction is DTT concentration. Typically, a relatively high concentration, 10 mM,
of DTT is used in the reverse transcription reaction. We investigated the effect of DTT
concentration in the context of the one-step RT-qPCR reactions (Figure 3E). At 1 mM
DTT, the baseline remained close to zero before the PCR amplification entered into
the exponential phase, whereas at 10 mM DTT a gradual increase in the baseline was
observed. This baseline drift might be attributed to the degradation of the probe
resulting in a higher noise level. With the further optimizations of the one-step RTqPCR reactions, we reached to the following favorable buffer composition for the
subsequent one-step RT-qPCR assays [50 mM Tris-HCl pH (8.5), 75 mM KCl, 2 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 200 uM dNTPs and 13.5 mM ammonium sulfate].
Determination of the enzyme amounts used in the one-step RT-qPCR reaction,
its sensitivity and SARS-CoV-2 detection limit.

In order to successfully develop a one-step RT-qPCR platform for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2, we formulated and evaluated the efficiency of purified Taq Pol and
MMLV-RT in the one-step RT-qPCR scheme using N1 and N2 primer sets and
synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA as a template. We found that a mixing ratio of 2 ng CHis/Strep MMLV-RT to 1 unit His-Taq Pol still sustained the Taq Pol’s activity in PCR
(Figure 3C). Therefore, in our initiail screening, we tried to determine the optimal
amount of MMLV-RT in the RT-qPCR reaction while keeping its relative ratio to Taq
Pol within this acceptable activity range. Three combinations at diverse His-Taq Pol
and C-His/Strep MMLV-RT ratios; 20 U: 40 ng/µL, 30 U: 60 ng/µL, and 40 U: 80 ng/µL
were used in each reaction and quantitatively compared to Invitrogen SuperScript™
III Platinum™ One-Step RT-qPCR System (Cat. No. 12574026). We
performed three independent replicas of the RT-qPCR assays in triplicates using N1
and N2 primer sets and applying 10-fold serial dilutions of synthetic SARS-CoV-2
RNAs ranging from 10 to 105 copies/µL as a template. The sensitivity of our one-step
RT-qPCR system is estimated in terms of the limit of detection (LoD). The LoD assays
demonstrated that our one-step RT-qPCR system can reliably detect 40 RNA copies
per reaction in all of the three aforementioned combinations (data not shown).
Furthermore, our data illustrated that the one-step RT-qPCR assays with 30 U: 60
ng/µL ratio was able to detect as low as 10 RNA copies per reaction from 9 out of 10
replicates as compared to 7 out of 10 replicates in case of 20 U: 40 ng/µL and 3 out
of 10 replicates in case of 40 U: 80 ng/µL ratios, indicating the higher sensitivity of our
system upon using 30 U: 60 ng/µL ratio. The slope and the R2 values of each curve
were used to evaluate the efficiency of individual assays (Figure 4). The R2 values
provided an estimate of the goodness of the linear fit to the data points. In an efficient
qPCR assay, R2 should be very close or greater than 0.90. The amplification

efficiencies of all three His-Taq Pol/C-His/Strep MMLV-RT ratios were above 99% for
both N1 and N2 primer sets (Figure 4B, 4C, and 4D). The standard curves showed
high correlation coefficients of R2>0.99 for N1 primer set and R2>0.95 for N2 with the
three His-Taq Pol/C-His/Strep MMLV-RT ratios.
Validation of R3T One-step RT-qPCR system for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in
clinical samples
In order to validate the competency of our one-step RT-qPCR system to detect SARSCoV-2 in clinical samples from patients, we used RNA samples extracted from the
nasopharyngeal swabs of 20 different patients who tested positive besides three
patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 using Invitrogen SuperScript™ III
Platinum™ One-step RT-qPCR kit (Table 1). The positive samples had variable Ct
values ranging from 16 to 38 applying the CDC qPCR N gene primer set from IDT.
Based on the aformentioned LoD results, we used 30 U: 60 ng/µL ratio for our R3T
One-step RT-qPCR kit on these clinical samples. The internal control human RNAseP
gene (RP) was detected in all samples. As expected, the N1 and N2 primer pair of the
viral N-gene was only detected in the positive samples not the negative ones (Table
1). In case of the three negative control samples (411, 429 and 440), Invitrogen
SuperScript™ III Platinum™ One-Step RT-qPCR System gave some high
Ct values upon applying N1 primer set but overall result undetermined. The
overall Ct values demonstrated a narrow difference between our R3T Onestep RT-qPCR kit and Invitrogen SuperScript™ III Platinum™ One-Step RTqPCR kit (Table 1), demonstrating the sensitivity of our system for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples.

We next evaluated the performance of our R3T One-step RT-qPCR kit under
actual testing conditions in a Saudi Ministry of Health-approved testing facility at King
Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre. A total of 192 de-identified patients
who were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this validation. In a
side-by-side comparison of our kit with their endorsed TaqPath™ 1-Step RT-qPCR kit,
20 positive patient samples were identified by both kits (Supplementary Table 1). The
remaining 172 patient samples tested negative in both kits; the representative results
of these negative patient tests are shown in Supplementary Table 1. This consistency
demonstrates the robustness and the accuracy of our optimized R3T One-step RTqPCR kit’s performance under real testing conditions.

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 has originated the present international outbreak of a severe respiratory
syndrome termed as COVID-19. The outburst of this viral infection has become a
pandemic and severe public health challenge worldwide. Owing to the absence of
effective medicines and vaccines, quick identification of the infected individuals and
imposing self-quarantine measurements are the only effective containment strategies
to avoid widespread community transmission. Therefore, the rapid development of
low-cost, easy-to-make, yet sensitive and reliable diagnostic tests are crucial.
In this study, we devised a sensitive, cost-effective, in-house one-step RTqPCR system based on patent-free Taq Pol and MMLV-RT. These enzymes were
discovered in the 1970s

33-34

; however, they still play a key role as molecular biology

tools owing to their robustness and unique enzymatic properties. To avoid legitimate
concerns regarding the intellectual property rights, we opted to purify those patentfree enzymes and optimize their use for the one-step RT-qPCR platform. To simplify

the expression and purification procedures, we used His-Taq Pol under the control of
the cold-shock promoter for E. coli expression and C-His/Strep MMLV-RT based on
the baculovirus expression system in Sf9 cells. Our protein-tag strategy enabled us to
express both proteins in large amounts and apply affinity chromatography for
purification without time-consuming precipitation steps. Because our protein
purification procedure still includes two chromatography techniques with different
chemical properties, the purity of our final product is more than 90 %. Moreover, the
high yields of both purified His-Taq Pol and C-His/Strep MMLV-RT proteins from
relatively small volumes of 1 L E. coli and 1 L Sf9 cultures, respectively, amassed for
purified protein amounts of more than $100,000 per enzyme in market value. The
quantities of Taq Pol and MMLV-RT produced by our protein expression and
purification schemes at the laboratory-scale are satisfactory and do not require
production upscaling to an industrial-scale facility. Our protein production platform
provides a simpler follow-up example for groups in research institutes with limitedresources.
Till present, there have been many studies for enhancing and improving the
enzymatic properties of MMLV-RT and Taq Pol. However, the improvements in the
enzymatic performance of commercial MMLV-RTs variants are mainly to amend the
efficiency to generate cDNA libraries from total RNAs through random annealing of
primers. On the other hand, commercial Taq Pol variants have been improved to
enhance the rate and processivity for quicker PCR reactions and longer amplifications.
In the scheme of COVID-19 detection, the RT primers are explicitly designed to be
gene-specific, besides the RNA regions annealed by the RT primers are carefully
selected to avoid erroneous interference in cDNA synthesis. We assume that the welldesigned RT primers for cDNA synthesis conceals any possible enzymatic

incompetency of our MMLV-RT and enables the detection of COVID-19 RNAs even
at low threshold (see discussion below). Our His-Taq Pol is also not a hot-start
polymerase like Platinum Taq Pol that we used as a benchmark for performance
comparison during this study. However, the advantages of the hot-start PCR
polymerase, such as the prevention of primer-dimer formation and non-specific
amplification, were not pronounced for the TaqMan based RT-qPCR platform. We also
found the use of the relatively short fragments for amplification to be in favor for our
His-Taq Pol in the one-step RT-qPCR scheme. We believe that the synergy between
using TaqMan based detection system and the short size of amplicons makes the
performance of our non-hot-start His-Taq Pol equally robust to that of hot-start
Platinum Taq Pol in the one-step RT-qPCR reaction.
Our aim from the current study was to establish the one-step RT-qPCR kit with
in-house enzymes. The advantages of a one-step RT-qPCR platform over a two-step
process in the work-flow at the point-of-care diagnostics include minimal sample
handling, reduced bench time, and less chances for pipetting errors and crosscontamination (Figure 1). This makes the one-step platform the first choice for highthroughput mass screening in the diagnostic point-of-care tests. In the one-step
platform, it is crucial to carefully choose the optimal conditions for both MMLV-RT and
Taq Pol to work together in the same reaction (1, 2). A major obstacle in assembling
our one-step RT-qPCR system was the inhibition of the Taq Pol’s activity in the
presence of MMLV-RT. It was proposed that both enzymes interact with specific
combination of primers (DNAs) and templates (RNAs) causing inhibitory effect (2). We
found that MMLV-RT hinders the Taq Pol’s activity in a portion-dependent manner;
however, this inhibitory effect can be circumvented, to some extent, by increasing the
amount of Taq Pol. Apart from Taq Pol and MMLV-RT ratio, sulfur-containing inorganic

molecules are also known to relieve the inhibition of PCR and often added when using
compositions containing two or more enzymes for the reverse transcription activity (US
Patent 9,556,466 B2). In this study, besides KCl in the reaction buffer, we employed
ammonium sulfate as additional salt and showed that it helped alleviate the MMLVRT’s inhibitory effect on the Taq Pol’s activity. However, we also noticed that this
alleviation disappeared when Taq Pol and MMLV-RT were pre-mixed in the absence
of salts (data not shown). This led us to suspect that Taq Pol and MMLV-RT directly
interact with each other. However, both the SDS-PAGE and SEC analysis did not
show any detectable physical interaction between Taq Pol and MMLV-RT; thus the
cause for this adverse effect remains unclear. We strongly believe that the next
direction for improving the one-step RT-qPCR, mainly targeted for diagnostic
purposes, should focus on finding a way to reduce the MMLV-RT’s inhibitory effect on
the Taq Pol’s activity rather than to boost their individual enzymatic activities.
Next, we verified the ideal proportions of Taq Pol and MMLV-RT in the
optimized reaction buffer in the context of COVID-19 detection work-flow. We
confirmed that 30 U: 60 ng/µL is the optimal composition for our one-step RT-qPCR
platform, where we successfully detected as low as 10 RNA copies per reaction with
more than 90 % reproducibility. The optimal amounts of MMLV-RT determined here
along with the aforementioned ratio for MMLV-RT and Taq Pol are surprisingly low;
the manufacturer’s recommendations for making cDNA libraries is 200 units, which is
almost 1,000 ng of enzyme for the RT reactions with random hexamer or dT primers.
We assume, at least in our case, that lowering the amount of MMLV-RT in the reaction
is the only way to make Taq Pol functional in the one-step RT-qPCR platform and that
around 60 ng of MMLV-RT is sufficient to synthesize necessary cDNA for COVID-19
diagnostic purposes.

Finally, we assessed our R3T One-step RT-qPCR kit with actual patient
samples isolated from individuals infected by SARS-CoV2. We screened 23 different
patients under laboratory settings, including three who were suspected but tested
negative for SARS-CoV2. All the tests performed with our kit showed the expected
true positive and negative results with a slight difference in the Ct values obtained from
Invitrogen SuperScript™ III Platinum™ One-Step RT-qPCR. Furthermore, we
evaluated the performance of our R3T One-step RT-qPCR kit in a Saudi Ministry of
Health-approved testing facility using 192 patient samples who were screened for
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our kit matched their endorsed TaqPath™ 1-Step RT-qPCR
kit by identifying the same 20 positive and 172 negative cases, demonstrating that our
kit is ready for deployment in the actual testing facilities. Here, we provide a guide on
how to assemble an in-house one-step RT-qPCR kit based on patent-free enzymes
within a few weeks of conceptualizing the project. We believe that our one-step RTqPCR system can be successfully applied for the routine SARS-CoV2 diagnostics and
extended to detect other pathogens.

Figure legends
Figure 1
One-step RT-qPCR platform vs. two-step RT-qPCR in the context of work-flow to
detect an RNA virus. After sampling the specimen from the patients, RNA materials
need to be prepared by extraction and purification (Purification of RNAs). The purified
RNAs are converted to DNAs by a reverse transcription reaction using reverse
transcriptase (Reverse transcription). At this stage, if the patient was infected with
RNA viruses, the complementary DNA (cDNA) fragments derived from the RNA
viruses are generated. Then the virus-originated DNA fragments are sufficiently
amplified by the qPCR reaction to a detectable level by the fluorescent signals
(Amplification/Detection). While the one-step RT-qPCR platform can simultaneously
achieve both the RT and qPCR reactions in a single tube, the two-step RT-qPCR
needs two separate experimental setups, extra laboratory work, and have more
chances for contamination by opening the tubes between the RT and PCR reactions.

Figure 3
A) Activity assays of His-Taq Pol and N-Taq Pol by PCR. Purified His-Taq Pol was
serially diluted by the storage buffer (see Materials and Methods) with the indicated
dilution factors and subjected to the PCR reactions. N-Taq Pol is the same as in
Figure 2D and the standard titration curve made by N-Taq Pol is shown in
Supplemental Figure 1. B) Activity assays of C-His/Strep MMLV-RT and other
commercially available reverse transcriptases. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized
from SARS-CoV-2 N gene RNAs, and the 2019-nCoV_N3 qPCR assay was
conducted. The yields of cDNA synthesis were shown in relative ones compared to
that of SuperScript II. Error bars represent standard errors. C) MMLV-RT inhibitory
effect on Taq Pol activity in the PCR reaction. The indicated amounts of purified CHis/Strep MMLV-RT were added to the PCR premixture containing different units of
Taq Pol. Error bars represent standard errors. D) Ammonium sulfate eases the
inhibitory effect of MMLV-RT on the Taq Pol’s activity in PCR. The different amount of
ammonium sulfate were added to the PCR reaction mixture without C-His/Strep
MMLV-RT, subsequently, 20 ng of C-His/Strep MMLV-RT was added to the reaction.
E) The effect of the DTT concentration on the baseline of the TaqMan based detection
system. The one-step RT-qPCR reaction was performed with 1,000 copies of the
synthetic RNAs as a template. ∆Rn; Rn is the fluorescence of the reporter dye divided
by the fluorescence of a passive reference dye, ∆Rn is Rn minus the baseline.
Figure 4
Determination of the optimal proportions of Taq Pol and MMLV-RT in the one-step RTqPCR reactions. The one-step RT-qPCR reactions were conducted using the
synthetic RNAs with 10-fold serial dilutions (from 10 to 105 copies/µL) as a
template with N1 or N2 primer sets (See Materials and Methods). As a control, we
used (A) SuperScript III Platinum One-Step RT-qPCR kit, (B) 20 units (U) of His-Taq
Pol and 40 ng/µL of C-His/Strep MMLV-RT, (C) 30 U and 60 ng/µL, and (D) 40 U and
80 ng/µL. The mixtures were subjected to the reactions and the Ct values were plotted
against the threshold cycle. Each plot represents the mean of 3 replicated Ct values
with each RNA sample. The coefficient of determination (R2) and the equation of the
regression curve (y) were calculated and shown in each panel.
