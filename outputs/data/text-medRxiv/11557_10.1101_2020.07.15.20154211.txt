Abstract

Objective
To define the epidemiologic curve of COVID-19 in Qatar, determine factors associated with
severe or critical illness, and study the temporal relation between public health measures and
case finding

Design
Epidemiologic investigation

Setting and Participants
All confirmed COVID-19 cases in the State of Qatar between February 28 and April 18, 2020

Main Outcome Measures
Number of total and daily new COVID-19 infections; demographic characteristics and
comorbidity burden and severity of infection; factors associated with severe or critical illness

Results
Between February 28 and April 18, 2020 (11:00AM local time), 5,685 cases of COVID-19 were
identified. Mean age (SD) was 35.8(12.0) years, 88.9% were male and 8.7% were Qatari
nationals. Overall, 83.6% had no concomitant comorbidity, and 3.0% had 3 or more
comorbidities. The overwhelming majority (90.9%) were asymptomatic or with minimal
symptoms, with 2.0% having severe or critical illness. Presence of hypertension or diabetes
were associated with a higher risk of severe or critical illness. Seven deaths were observed
during the time interval studied. The epidemiologic curve indicated two distinct patterns of

infection, a larger cluster among expatriate craft and manual workers, and a smaller one among
Qatari nationals returning from abroad during the epidemic.

Conclusion
COVID-19 infections in Qatar started in two distinct clusters, but then became more widespread
in the population through community transmission. Infections were mostly asymptomatic or with
minimal symptoms and associated with very low mortality. Severe/critical illness was associated
with presence of hypertension or diabetes.

Article Summary
Strengths and limitations of this study:
•

National study with unified contact tracing and testing

•

All testing done at a single lab, and all tests performed in the State of Qatar during the
study period were included, providing a robust national estimate of the number of
infected persons among those tested

•

Comorbidities were retrieved from the electronic medical records using ICD-10 AM
codes

•

Exact geographic location and contact tracing data were not included in the current
report

•

It is possible that some persons still under care on the study end date may have
progressed to more severe disease after that date

What is already known on this topic
As of May 3, 2020, over 3.4 million persons have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and over
244,000 deaths have been reported in persons with COVID-19 infection. Those at higher risk
of complications include persons over age 60 years and those with chronic comorbid
conditions. Mortality rate varies widely among different countries, and this can be associated
both to the capacity of the health system to provide effective intensive care including
ventilators as well as other factors, including demographic differences. Public health
measures seem effective, but there is debate on the extent to which the measures need to
be aggressive or the duration for which they should be implemented.

What this study adds
This study reports on the epidemic curve in a population with a unique demographic
structure, comprising an overwhelming majority of expatriates and young male craft and
manual workers. This is also the first study that reports on the epidemic curve of an Arab
country in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). The study also overlays major public
health measures on the epidemic curve, to provide an understanding of the context in which
the epidemic is progressing. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Qatar were young with
few comorbidities. Case fatality rate was very low (only 7 deaths among 5,685 infected
persons). Severe and critical illness were associated with presence of hypertension or
diabetes.

Introduction
A cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology linked to a seafood wholesale market
was first reported from Wuhan, China in December 2019.1-4 A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2
was isolated as the causative organism and the resultant disease was named COVID-19.1,5
Initially linked to the seafood market and presumed to be transmitted from animals to humans,
the virus has since spread quickly across the globe through human-to-human transmission.6-9
As of May 3, 2020, more than 3.4 million cases and over 244,000 deaths have been reported
globally. Published epidemiologic studies across a number of populations show significant
differences in rates and severity of infection and in case fatality rates.10 At this stage of a novel
virus pandemic, analyzing transmission patterns in populations with unique demographic
characteristics can add to our understanding of the disease dynamics. While it is difficult to
isolate the effects of public health measures, such as quarantine, lockdown, and physical
distancing, it is nevertheless useful to track the course of the epidemic in relation to the timeline
of their implementation. We describe the demographic characteristics, comorbidity profile, and
disease severity of patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Qatar. We also report on
significant public health measures implemented to slow the progression of the epidemic in
Qatar.

Qatar is a part of the six-country Gulf Cooperation Council, which also includes Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Qatar has a unique population
demographic profile. Among the 2.8 million residents of Qatar, expatriate workforce constitutes
about 88% of the population.11 Due to the nature of the expatriate workforce, the majority of the
population in Qatar (~75%) are male, and the population pyramid is heavily concentrated in the
20-50 year age groups, particularly among males.11 There is evidence that COVID-19
disproportionally affects males and outcomes are poorer in the older age group.3,12,13
Understanding the epidemiologic curve and risk factors for serious infection in Qatar will be

important in understanding the epidemiology in countries with unique demographic
characteristics.

Methods
Even before the first case of COVID-19 was identified in the country, Qatar had instituted
extensive plans to identify and manage persons with COVID-19 infection. The existing tracking,
tracing and identification mechanism within the Ministry of Public Health, with proven
effectiveness during the MERS-CoV outbreak, was expanded and put on alert.14,15 Testing for
suspected cases started on February 5, 2020, and the first case was recorded on February 28,
2020. We used the tracking and reporting data from the Ministry of Public Health to determine
the number of new cases diagnosed per day and their demographic characteristics between
February 28, 2020 (date of identification of first case in Qatar) and April 18, 2020 (11:00 AM
local time). All COVID-19 testing in Qatar was performed at the central laboratory of Hamad
Medical Corporation, which is the public healthcare delivery arm for the State of Qatar and
provides over 85% of the inpatient bed capacity in the State. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs
were collected from suspected cases with symptoms of influenza-like illness suggesting COVID19 and, if confirmed, from close contacts. Real time RT-PCR was used to detect SARS-CoV-2
infection. Nationality of each tested person was ascertained from the official State Identification
Card, which is issued to each national and expatriate worker and their dependents residing in
Qatar. Comorbidities were retrieved from the electronic medical records where they are coded
using the International Classification of Diseases 10th edition, Australian Modification. Severity
of illness at the time of presentation was determined by expert coders using criteria suggested
by the World Health Organization, including admission to an acute care or an intensive care
bed, need for mechanical ventilation, oxygen saturation and supplemental oxygen
requirement.16 (Supplementary table 1) Severity of illness was categorized into 1)
asymptomatic or minimal symptoms, 2) mild symptoms or uncomplicated upper respiratory tract

infection without clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, 3) mild symptoms with clinical
or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, 4) severely ill, and 5) critically ill.16

We created a timeline of newly diagnosed cases to study the progression of the epidemic in
Qatar. Key governmental decisions taken by the Supreme Committee for Crisis Management
and the Council of Ministers in response to the epidemic were marked on the timeline to show
their temporal relation to the cases. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine
factors associated with severe and critical illness. Covariates of interest included in the model
were age, gender, nationality and presence of comorbidities. Comorbidities with a total count of
less than 15 were excluded because of the small numbers.

Changes in population movement was assessed using Google mobility reports, a publicly
available tool that tracks movement of people who use mobile applications like Google Maps.17
They show changes in visits and length of stay at various locations compared to a baseline.
Baseline was the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week
period between January 3, 2020 and February 6, 2020.17

Ethical Approval
The Institutional Review Board at Hamad Medical Corporation approved this study with an
expedited status due to the emergency pandemic status of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Patient and Public Involvement
This study was conducted in response to a national and global public health emergency. There
was no patient or public involvement. However, key elements of the data are shared with the
public on a daily basis.

Results
Between February 5, 2020 and April 18, 2020 (11:00 AM local time), 60,645 persons were
tested for SARS-CoV-2, of which 5,685 were confirmed positive. Before the first case was
diagnosed, testing for SARS-CoV-2 focused on those with influenza-like illness and severe
acute respiratory infection. The first cases were identified among quarantined travelers returning
to Qatar on February 28, 2020, followed by the identification of a large cluster of over 300
infections on March 6, 2020 among expatriate craft and manual workers. Following the
discovery of the first community cluster, testing was expanded to include contacts of new cases,
persons in hotspots, that is areas where infections were diagnosed, individuals with suspected
infection or suggestive symptoms, and travelers coming or returning to Doha. The rapid
expansion of testing created a backlog, which was resolved through an investment in testing
infrastructure that significantly increased the testing capacity to approximately 4,000 tests per
day.

The number of new cases diagnosed by date of diagnosis is presented in figure 1. The
epidemiologic curve showed two distinct patterns of infection transmission. A larger and
sustained community transmission was observed among expatriate workers, predominantly
among craft and manual workers, which subsequently reached other population segments. A
second smaller cluster among Qatari nationals returning from overseas during the study period
was not sustained over time. Subsequent smaller case clusters among Qatari nationals were
traced to the local community. The number of tests performed per day and the number testing
positive is provided in supplementary figure 1. The positivity rate, that is number of tests
positive over total number of tests, is shown in figure 2. The positivity rate increased steadily
with time, with somewhat of an accelerated rate after April 5, 2020.

The mean age (SD) of the infected persons was 35.8 (12.0) years and 88.9% were male (Table
1). Other baseline characteristics are also shown in table 1. The nationalities with highest
frequency of infection were Indian (27.4%), Bangladeshi (18.9%), Nepalese (18.4%), Qatari
(8.7%), and Pakistani (6.2%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (6.9%),
diabetes mellitus (6.0%), cardiovascular disease (4.4%) and chronic lung disease (3.0%).
Comorbidity data were missing for 235 persons (4.1%). Among all infected persons, 4,753
(83.6%) had no known comorbidity and 697 (12.3%) had at least one comorbidity. An
overwhelming majority of infected persons (90.9%) were either asymptomatic or had minimal
symptoms, 0.8% had mild illness without evidence of pneumonia, 2.3% had mild illness with
pneumonia, and 2% were severe or critically ill. Severity of illness data were missing for 223
(3.9%) persons. (Table 1)

A larger proportion of persons with mild illness with or without pneumonia and those with severe
or critical illness had at least one comorbidity. (Table 2) Compared to those with asymptomatic
or minimally symptomatic illness, prevalence of most comorbidities was 3-4 times higher among
those with mild disease with or without pneumonia or severe/critical illness. Number of
comorbidities by severity of illness is shown in table 3. Among persons with no comorbidity,
96.1% were asymptomatic or had minimal symptoms, 2.5% had mild illness with or without
pneumonia, and 1.4% were severely or critical ill. Among persons with 2 or more comorbidities,
82.1% were asymptomatic or had minimal symptoms, 10.9% had mild illness with or without
pneumonia, and 7.1% were severely or critical ill. (Table 3)

Seven deaths were observed during the time interval studied, corresponding to a case-fatality
rate of 1.2 per 1000 cases. All seven deaths were males aged 40-88 years. All except one (74
years old male) had comorbidities, including diabetes (5 subjects), cardiovascular disease (5
subjects) and hypertension (3 subjects). One patient, 58 years old had 5 comorbidities

(diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney and liver disease). In a
multivariable logistic regression model, presence of hypertension (OR 3.49; 95% CI 1.83,6.68)
or diabetes (OR 3.17; 95% CI 1.76,5.71) were associated with a higher risk of severe or critical
disease. (Table 4) Cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease and
solid organ malignancy were not associated with a higher risk. We repeated the logistic
regression analysis after excluding those with missing data and the results were nearly identical.
(Supplementary table 2) We also repeated the analysis using number of comorbidities as
covariates. Presence of any single comorbidity (OR 5.43, 95% CI 3.41,8.63) or any 3 or more
comorbidities (OR 6.16, 95% CI 3.35,11.32) were associated with a higher risk of severe or
critical illness. (Supplementary table 3)

Google mobility reports data demonstrated a significant decrease in number of people visiting
retail and recreation outlets, grocery and pharmacy stores, parks, transit stations and
workplaces over time. (Table 5) A concurrent increase in people staying in residential areas
was observed over this timeframe. A snapshot on April 17 shows a 69% reduction in visits to
retail and recreation areas, a 44% reduction in visits to grocery and pharmacy stores, a 64%
decrease in visits to parks, a 68% decrease in visits to transit stations and a 38% decrease in
visits to workplaces. A 21% increase in people at residential areas was observed on this date.

Discussion
We provide a characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Qatar, which offers new insights
into the behavior of the pandemic in a unique demographic setting.

The first case in Qatar was identified on February 28, 2020, among returning travelers, which is
nearly 9 weeks after the first cluster was reported from Wuhan, China.18 During this time,
infection had spread to multiple countries over four continents. This was also a critical time

during which the State of Qatar formulated a national plan to respond to the anticipated cases.
Testing for SARS-CoV-2 started in Qatar on February 5, 2020 and the first major cluster of
cases was identified on March 8, 2020 where over 300 cases were linked to 4 expatriate
workers through aggressive contact tracing. Such aggressive identification and contact tracing
and testing were probably the reasons for a small number of daily new cases till March 31,
2020. At that time, a large number of returning travelers and nationals were identified to have
infection. The number of daily diagnosed infections accelerated in April, in part due to a large
increase in number of daily tests, but also reflecting expansion of the epidemic in the wider
population. This trend occurred predominantly in expatriate workers often living in more
crowded areas and accommodations with frequent social mixing despite a national campaign to
discourage peoples’ movement except in urgent situations. The epidemic, however, eventually
reached a larger population.

An overwhelming majority (>90%) of confirmed COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic or with
minimal symptoms not requiring urgent medical care or hospitalization. This is likely due to the
younger age of the population (mean age 35.8 years) and overall absence of any comorbidities
in the vast majority of the infected persons. This reinforces our current understanding of the
disease being mild or asymptomatic in a majority of the persons, particularly among the younger
and healthier persons, as well as the strong role of age in the epidemiology of this infection.
Similar to other studies, presence of comorbidities was associated with severe or critical
disease.1 We found a very low mortality among confirmed COVID-19 patients in Qatar, which
may at least partly be attributable both to the timely and effective response of the health system
and the demographic characteristics of the infected persons. It is conceivable that right
censoring with the time delay between onset of disease to death may play a part, though
similarly very low mortality after the study period ended does not support this. The role that

factors such as free access to high quality medical care for everybody in Qatar, availability of a
high number of critical care beds, or differences in viral subtypes, played, needs further study.

In response to the spread of COVID-19, the country took a series of public health measures,
including limiting incoming passenger flights into Doha through Hamad International Airport and
providing free state quarantine facilities for returning travelers. A host of other measures were
implemented gradually that promoted physical distancing including, closing retail stores in malls
and shopping centers, closing entertainment and dining facilities, postponing or canceling large
sports events and conferences, suspending classes in schools and universities, and mandating
working from home for 80% of workers in the public and private sectors. The healthcare system
was also reorganized to prioritize COVID-19 response over routine services. All positive cases
including those without symptoms were admitted to isolation facilities by the public healthcare
system. These public health measures were heavily promoted and widely communicated
through social and traditional media outlets to all segments of society. Mobility data shows a
significant reduction in visits to common retail, recreation, transit and workplace areas, which
may have contributed to a reduction in spread of infection. There was a more pronounced
reduction in mobility in the weeks following April 5th, which coincides with the significant rise in
the reported number of positive cases.

Strengths of our study include unified contact tracing and testing, with all testing done at a
single lab. All tests performed in the State of Qatar were included, providing a robust national
estimate of the number of infected persons among those tested. There are limitations to our
study. Comorbidities were retrieved from the electronic medical records using ICD-10 AM
codes. Exact geographic location and contact tracing data were not included in the current
report. Our study end date was April 18, 2020, and all persons with confirmed infection till that

date were included. However, it is possible that some persons may have progressed to more
severe disease after this date.

In conclusion, we describe the evolution of COVID-19 epidemic in the State of Qatar. The
epidemic predominantly affected males and younger population and was associated with no or
minimal symptoms in a vast majority of the infected persons. Public health measures were
instituted early and may have led to the slower growth compared with other countries which
delayed such measures.
