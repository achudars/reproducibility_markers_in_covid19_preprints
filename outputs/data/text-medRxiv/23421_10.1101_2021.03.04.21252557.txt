ABSTRACT

23

We report the sequencing and detection of 39 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-

24

CoV-2) samples containing lineage-defining mutations specific to viruses belonging to the B.1.1.7 lineage

25

(UK variant) in the Philippines.

ANNOUNCEMENT

28

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that has gained pandemic status from

29

the World Health Organization, with millions of cases and deaths recorded worldwide. This global health

30

crisis is caused by viruses referred to as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),

31

a member of the genus Betacoronavirus (Coronaviridae) together with the causative agents of the first

32

SARS outbreak in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012.

33
34

In this study, we present the genome sequences of 39 cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines caused by

35

viruses belonging to SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, more commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK)

36

variant. This particular SARS-CoV-2 variant was initially identified in the United Kingdom and has been

37

reported to cause a surge of COVID-19 infections in the said country (Kirby, 2021). Initial studies also

38

suggest that the B.1.1.7 viruses appear to have replicative advantage (Grabowski et al., 2021) and are

39

more transmissible (Leung et al., 2021).

40
41

A total of 39 Philippine SARS-CoV-2 samples were classified under the B.1.1.7 lineage. Table 1 shows the

42

primary consensus assembly metrics for these samples. The average depth of coverage across all the

43

sequences is 1,128x, with 33 of the samples carrying all 17 hallmark mutations of the B.1.1.7 lineage as

44

listed in the PANGO Lineages report for the B.1.1.7 variant of concern (https://cov-

45

lineages.org/global_report_B.1.1.7.html).

46
47

The detection of B.1.1.7 from returning overseas Filipino workers and in the community highlights the

48

need for genomic surveillance at the country’s ports of entry and the general population to monitor the

49

importation and local transmission of emerging variants of concern that may impact the public health

50

response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the Philippines.

51
52
53

METHODS

54

In order to detect the entry of B.1.1.7 infection in the Philippines, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected

55

between December 10, 2020 and January 31, 2021 from COVID-19 cases detected in returning overseas

56

Filipinos, as well as from local case clusters mainly from the Cordillera Administrative Region of the

57

country, among others. The collected swab samples were subjected to RNA extraction using the QIAamp

58

Viral RNA Mini Kit, the product of which were then used as templates for the amplicon-based Illumina

59

COVIDSeq Test (https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/ivd-products/covidseq.html) sequencing

60

workflow. Afterwards, the resulting sequence reads were mapped to the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome

61

(NCBI Accession Number NC_045512.2) using Minimap2 (Li, 2018) version 2.17-r941, with the `–x sr`

62

parameter for short accurate genomic reads alignment.

63
64

Primer clipping and quality trimming, intrahost variant calling, removal of reads associated with

65

mismatched primer indices, and consensus sequence assembly were all done following the suggested

66

workflow of iVar (Grubaugh et al., 2019) version 1.2.2, using default parameters. The consensus variants

67

were identified by comparing the resulting assemblies with the reference sequence using MUMmer

68

(Kurtz et al., 2004) as implemented in the RATT software (Otto et al., 2011). Lastly, SARS-CoV-2 lineage

classifications were assigned using Pangolin version 2.3.2 (github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin; Rambaut

70

et al., 2020).
