Abstract
This study aimed to evaluate the link between microbial translocation markers and
systemic inflammation at the earliest time-point after hospitalization and at the last 72 h
of hospitalization in survivors and non-survivors COVID-19 patients. Sixty-six SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR+ infected patients and nine non-COVID-19 pneumonia controls were
admitted in this study. Blood samples were collected at hospital admission (T1)
(Controls and COVID-19+ patients) and 0-72 h before hospital discharge (T2, alive or
dead) to analyze systemic cytokines and chemokines, LPS concentrations and soluble
CD14 (sCD14) levels. THP-1 human monocytic cell line was incubated with plasma
from survivors and non-survivors COVID-19 patients and their phenotype, activation
status, TLR4, and chemokine receptors were analyzed by flow cytometry. COVID-19
patients presented higher IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, TGF-β1, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL4/MIP-1β,
and CCL5/RANTES levels than controls. Moreover, LPS and sCD14 were higher at
hospital admission in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Non-survivors COVID-19
patients had increased LPS levels concomitant with higher IL-6, TNF-α, CCL2/MCP-1,
and CCL5/RANTES levels at T2. Increased expression of CD16 and CCR5 were
identified in THP-1 cells incubated with the plasma of survivor patients obtained at T2.
The incubation of THP-1 with T2 plasma of non-survivors COVID-19 leads to higher
TLR4, CCR2, CCR5, CCR7, and CD69 expression. In conclusion, increased microbial
translocation during hospitalization coexist with the inflammatory condition of SARSCoV-2 infection and could lead to higher monocyte activation in non-survivors COVID19 patients.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection
causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease with diverse clinical
manifestations (1). While most COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic or mild, severe form
of COVID-19 can occur with detrimental manifestations such as acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and death (2). The COVID-19
immunopathology is mainly characterized by a hyperinflammatory state, strong innate
cells response, and lymphocyte activation with an exhausted profile (3). Furthermore,
there is a clear association between COVID-19 severity and higher levels of systemic
cytokines (4).
The mechanism underlying the inflammatory state of COVID-19 is not fully understood
at this time. Although the respiratory tract is the main site of infection for COVID-19,
the pathogenesis of the disease can also involve different organs and systems, such as
the heart, kidneys, intestines, vasculature, and liver (3). In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract,
symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal distention have been reported in several
patients (5). Furthermore, enterocytes in the ileum and colon express the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor and may serve as a site for SARS-CoV-2
entrance and predispose to enteric infection (6). Additionally, RNA viral particles were
detected in stool samples, arising the possibility that bacterial translocation and
microbial products from the GI tract to the peripheral blood might contribute to the
hyperinflammatory state and COVID-19 severity (7).
Moreover, systemic inflammation caused by lung infection can lead to the disruption of
the gut barrier integrity and increase the permeability to gut microbes and microbial
products (8–10). Interestingly, disruption in gut barriers and microbial translocation is
more likely to occur in older individuals and individuals with chronic diseases, such as

type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity, which contribute to the
exacerbation of systemic inflammation by activating innate immune cells, mainly
monocytes and neutrophils (8).
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a product derived from the membrane of gram-negative
bacteria that acts as a potent immune-activating stimulus when recognized by innate
immune cells expressing toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (11). Then, innate immune cells
become activated and produce high amounts of proinflammatory mediators including
cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) and
chemokines (i.e., CCL2/MCP-1 and CCL5/RANTES) (12). In this sense, peripheral
blood LPS is a well-recognized marker of translocation of microorganisms after events
that compromise the integrity of the intestinal mucosa (13,14). Besides, soluble CD14
(sCD14) is released after cleavage from the membrane form (mCD14) on the surface of
monocytes through exposure to LPS stimulation and is considered a marker of
microbial translocation (14,15).
Emerging evidence indicates that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection induces disruption in
the gut barrier contributing to the systemic spread of bacteria and microbial products
which affect the host’s response to the infection (9,16,17). However, the time course of
the presence of microbial product in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients during
hospitalization remains unknown. Here, we investigated the link between microbial
translocation markers and systemic inflammation in the hospital admission and at the
discharge time from the hospital in survivors and non-survivors COVID-19 patients.
We hypothesized that microbial translocation markers are associated with systemic
inflammation and could contribute to the death of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Study population
Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with confirmed positive SARS‐CoV‐2 RT-PCR test on
nasopharyngeal specimens, were consecutively recruited after admission in the COVID19 Unit of Hospital São Camilo (Esteio/RS, Brazil) between June/2020 and
December/2020 to a clinical cohort study. The study was approved by the UFCSPA
Ethics Committee (CAAE: 38886220.0.0000). Informed consent was obtained from
those legally responsible for the patients after the procedures had been explained. The
authors signed an agreement to preserve patient and staff anonymity related to the use of
this data. All patients were confirmed to COVID-19 infection according to the World
Health Organization interim guidance and Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for Novel
Coronavirus Pneumonia and were positive for at least two nucleic acid tests for SARSCoV-2 (18).
Clinical and socio-demographic data were collected from the patient’s electronic
medical records upon admission to the unit. Body mass index was calculated from
weight and height data and was classified according to age. Blood samples from 9 ageand sex-matched SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative controls admitted to hospital with
pneumonia were also obtained.

Blood collection and Laboratory Analysis
Blood samples were collected from the antecubital vein of the patients into 4 mL tubes
with EDTA as anti-coagulant. Blood collection were taken at the earliest time-point
after hospitalization (T1) and before discharge time from the hospital (T2: 0 to 72 hours
before leaving hospital or death). Plasma samples were obtained by centrifugation
(2000g, 10 minutes), aliquoted and immediately kept at -80ºC until analysis.

Plasma levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, TGF-β1 (all from Invitrogen Life Sciences, USA),
IFN-γ, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL4/MIP-1β, and CCL5/RANTES (all from Peprotech, USA)
were analyzed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) following the
manufacturer’s procedure using a microplate reader (EzBiochrom, USA). The intraassay coefficient of variability was < 7.5%. The detection limits of each cytokine were:
IL-6, 2 – 200 pg/mL; IL-10, 4 – 200 pg/mL; IFN-γ, 10 – 300 pg/mL; TNF-α, 2 – 200
pg/mL; TGF-β1, 2 – 500 pg/mL; CCL5/RANTES, 20 – 1000 pg/mL; CCL4/MIP-1β, 50
– 1500 pg/mL; CCL2/MCP-1, 50 – 1000 pg/mL. The soluble form of CD14 was
analyzed using Human CD14 ELISA Kit from Invitrogen (USA), with detection limits
ranging 8.23 – 8000 pg/mL.

Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry determination of LPS
LPS concentration was determined by quantitation of 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid as
described by Pais de Barros and colleagues (19). Briefly, 150 µL of plasma was
hydrolyzed with 75 µL of NaCl 150 mM, 300 µL of HCl 8 mol for 4 h at 90 °C and
extracted with 4 mL of a hexane. Samples were dried under a nitrogen stream and
resuspended in 50 μL of methanol immediately prior to the injection in the analytical
system. A Nexera UFLC system coupled to a LCMS-8040 triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used for the analysis. The electrospray
parameters were set in the negative ion mode ([M-H]-) as follows: capillary voltage,
3000 V; desolvation line temperature, 250 ºC; heating block temperature, 500 ºC;
drying gas, 18/L min; and nebulizing gas, 2 L/min. Collision-induced dissociation was
obtained with 230 kPa argon pressure. Analyses were carried out with multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) by using the following fragmentation: m/z 243.1 → m/z 59.0. The
chromatographic separation was conducted with an Acquity UPLC® C18 column (2.1 x

50 mm, 1.7 μm particle size) (Waters Corporation, Ireland). The analyses were
performed in gradient elution mode with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min and the gradient
mobile phase system consisted of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) both
fortified with 0.2 % acetic acid as follow: 0 – 1.5 min, 75 – 100% of B; 1.5 – 2.0 min,
100% of B; 2.0 – 2.1 min, 100 – 75 % of B; 2.1 – 5.5 min, 75 % B. The column oven
was kept at 50 °C. The data were processed using LabSolutions software (Shimadzu,
Kyoto, Japan). Calibration curves were constructed at intervals of 0.2 - 1000 ng/mL.

Cell Culture and Flow cytometry
THP-1 human monocyte cells (ATCC TIB-202) (2 x 105 cells/well) were cultured in
RPMI media (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (both from Sigma-Aldrich) in 96 well
plates for 24 hours. Afterwards, the media plus FBS were removed; cells were washed
with phosphate-saline buffer and incubated with RPMI supplemented with 10% serum
of survivors and non-survivors COVID-19 patients for 15 hours. Then, cells were
labelled with monoclonal antibodies (all anti-human) conjugated with specific
fluorochromes: CD14 Fitc, CD16 Pe, TLR4 Pe, CD69 Percp-Cy5.5, CD192 (CCR2) Pe,
CD195 (CCR5), CD197 (CCR7) Fitc, HLA-DR PercP-Cy5.5 (all from EbioScience,
ThermoFisher, USA). 10.000 events were acquired using CELLQuest Pro Software (BD
Bioscience, USA) on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, USA) to
determine cell phenotype. THP-1 were identified and gated according to each forward
scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) profile and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)
was evaluated.

Normality of data was checked by Kolmogorov‐Smirnov, and the values were presented
as mean ± 95%CI for demographic and clinical characteristics, and mean ± standard
deviation (SD) for inflammatory mediators. Participant’s characteristics and
inflammatory analysis were between-groups compared through a one‐way ANOVA
followed by Bonferroni's post‐hoc for multiple comparisons. The time-course of
inflammatory response and immune variables was analyzed by a generalized linear
mixed model. Correlation analyses between markers microbial translocation and
inflammatory mediators were performed using Pearson’s Coefficient of Correlation. P
values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The SPSS 22.0 (IBM Inc, EUA)
software was used in all analysis.

Results
Characteristics of the study population
Firstly, we analyzed the baseline characteristics and inflammatory mediators in controls
and COVID-19 hospitalized patients. To this, 66 patients admitted at COVID-19 care
unit due to COVID-19 complications were enrolled in this study. Additionally, 9
COVID-19- controls were analyzed. COVID-19 patients presented higher body mass
and body mass index than controls (p<0.01), and 53.8% of patients were classified as
obese. The mean length of stay in the hospital were 21.1 (15.6 – 26.6) days for COVID19 patients, 84.8% patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to
COVID-19 complications, and 34.8% patients died due to complications of SARSCoV-2 infection. Forty-three (43) patients survived to SARS-CoV-2 infection and were
classified as COVID-19 survivors. Patients and control data are shown in Table 1.
Interestingly, COVID-19 non-survivors (n=23, 30.7% of COVID-19 patients) were
heavier than controls (body mass, p=0.01; BMI, p=0.01) and COVID-19 survivors
(n=43, 57.3% COVID-19 patients) (body mass, p=0.03; BMI, p=0.02), but no

difference between groups was found in the hospital length of stay (p>0.05). COVID-19
non-survivors required more oxygen use during hospitalization than COVID-19
survivors (p=0.002), but similar rates of ICU admission were observed (p>0.05). The
most reported symptoms by COVID-19 patients were fever (74.2%), dyspnea (62.8%),
and cough (58.5%). Furthermore, 21.7% of COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with
hypertension, 18.7% with diabetes mellitus 2, 14.7% with some neurologic disease and
12% with some cardiovascular disease. Regarding pharmacological treatment,
azithromycin (24.3%) and corticosteroids therapy (23.7%) were the predominant
medicine adopted by medical staff during hospitalization. There was no difference
between groups regarding symptoms, comorbidities, or pharmacological therapy during
hospitalization (p<0.05), unless the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (COVID-19
survivors, 4.8; COVID-19 non-survivors, 22.7%; p=0.04).

Systemic inflammatory mediators in survivors and non-survivors COVID-19
patients
COVID-19 patients presented a higher inflammatory profile at hospital admission
compared to controls as presented in Table 2. COVID-19 patients had increased
systemic levels of IL-6 (p<0.01), IFN-γ (p<0.01), TNF-α (p<0.01), CCL5/RANTES
(p<0.01), CCL4/MIP-1β (p<0.01) and CCL2/MCP-1 (p<0.01) but diminished
circulating levels of TGF-β1 (p<0.05). When COVID-19 patients were stratified in
survivors and non-survivors, both groups presented higher IL-6 (p<0.01), CCL2/MCP-1
(p<0.01) and CCL4/MIP-1β (p<0.01) levels at hospital admission compared to controls.
However, only non-survivors had increased IFN-γ (p<0.01) and TNF-α (p<0.05)
compared to controls, and higher TNF-α levels (p<0.05) than survivors. Conversely,
survivors had higher levels of CCL5/RANTES (p<0.01) and CCL4/MIP-1β (p<0.05)
compared to control and non-survivors groups, respectively. Furthermore, diminished
TGF-β1 levels were found in both survivors and non-survivors COVID-19 patients
compared to controls (p<0.01). Finally, a strong monocytopenia was observed in
COVID-19 non-survivors compared to COVID-19 survivors (p=0.01). These data
indicate that COVID-19 patients have higher levels of inflammatory cytokines at the
hospital admission, and higher TNF-α plasma levels that may be associated with death.

Effect of plasma from COVID survivors and non-survivors on THP-1 cell
phenotype.
As hospitalized non-survivors COVID-19 patients presented higher levels of microbial
translocation markers with concomitant increase in some plasmatic inflammatory
mediators, we hypothesized if the plasma from COVID-19 patients alters the phenotype
of monocytes including subpopulation and activation markers and TLR4 and chemokine
receptors expression. To this, we incubated THP-1 human monocyte lineage with
plasma of survivors (n=8) and non-survivors (n=8) COVID-19 patients collected at
hospital admission and at the end of hospitalization. Plasma incubation did not alter the
cell viability in THP-1 cells evaluated by MTT assay (Suppl. Fig. 1). Figure 5 shows the
expression of TLR4, CD14, CD16, CD69, HLA-DR, CCR2, CCR5 and CCR7 in THP-1
cells after incubation with LPS (1 ng/mL), and plasma from COVID-19 survivors or
non-survivors patients collected at T1 and T2. Interestingly, plasma from COVID-19
non-survivor patients obtained at T2 increased the expression of TLR4 (p=0.03), CCR2
(p=0.05), CCR5 (p=0.02) and CCR7 (p=0.02) and the activation marker CD69 (p=0.02)
on the cell surface of THP-1 cells compared to T1 plasma from the same group. The
expression of CD16 (p=0.04) and CCR5 (p=0.03) were higher in THP-1 cells incubated

with plasma from COVID-19 survivor patients collected at T2. No statistical differences
were found in CD14 and HLA-DR expression in this study (p<0.05). These data
indicate that non-survival COVID-19 patients presented higher levels of microbial
translocation products and inflammatory mediators in the plasma that increase
activation/migration status of monocytes.

Discussion
Hospitalized COVID-19 patients display a broad spectrum of inflammatory response,
suggesting that systemic mediators contribute to the immune activation, disease severity
and the outcome course in COVID-19 (20). In the present study, we hypothesized that
microbial translocation markers could impact on inflammatory response in COVID-19
patients. Our main findings can be summarized as follows: a) markers of microbial
translocation were higher at hospital admission in COVID-19 patients; b) COVID-19
patients presented a proinflammatory status as viewed by the higher levels of IL-6, IFNγ, TNF-α, CCL5/RANTES, CCL4/MIP-1β and CCL2/MCP-1; c) non-survivors
COVID-19 patients presented increases in LPS and sCD14 during the hospitalization
associated with increased IL-6, TNF-α, CCL5/RANTES and CCL2/MCP-1 systemic
levels; d) survivors COVID-19 patients maintained LPS and sCD14 levels at stable
values concomitant with increases in IFN-γ levels; e) the incubation of non-survivors
COVID-19 plasma obtained in the T2 hospitalization increased the expression of
TLR4, CCR2, CCR5, and CD69 on the cell surface of THP-1 monocytic lineage, while
THP-1 cells incubated with T2 plasma of survivor patients presented higher CCR5 and
CD16 expression. In conjunct, our data indicates that increased microbial translocation
during hospitalization coexist with the inflammatory condition of SARS-CoV-2

infection and could lead to the higher monocyte activation which may be associated
with worsening of COVID-19 outcomes, such as death.
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2), the most recognized receptor that binds
with the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and allows the host infection, is widely
expressed in epithelial cells along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (8,21). Thus, SARSCoV-2 can invade the intestinal tract causing GI dysfunction which disrupt intestinal
barriers, increasing the translocation of microbial products (9,21). Increased systemic
endotoxemia has been previously described in several pathological conditions
associated with hospitalization, becoming a recognized marker of critical ill who suffer
sepsis (22–24). Furthermore, recent studies described disrupted gut barrier integrity and
increased circulating bacteriome in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients (9,16,17).
Here, we found increased LPS and sCD14 levels in the plasma of hospitalized COVID19 patients at admission and during ICU hospitalization. Arunachalam and colleagues
(20) found higher levels of bacterial DNA products, as measured by PCR quantification
of 16S ribosomal RNA gene product, and LPS levels in severe ICU patients. The
increased bacterial products in the peripheral circulation may contribute to the enhanced
macrophage activation in infected tissue (i.e. lungs and gastrointestinal tissues) and to
the failure to suppress the hyperinflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In fact,
elevated markers level of gut leakage was previously associated with inflammasome
activation which leads to cardiac injury during the course of hospitalization in COVID19 patients (17). Corroborating these data, other studies show an important role for
endotoxin and sCD14 in heart failure (25,26).
Microbial translocation to the peripheral blood also contributes to an early activation of
monocytic cells. Indeed, we observed higher sCD14 in survivors and non-survivors
COVID-19 patients. In line with this, Bowman and coworkers (27) found increased

sCD14 levels in COVID-19 patients independent of the disease severity degree.
Furthermore, the authors revealed that COVID-19 critical ill patients who recovered or
deceased had the highest sCD14 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP, another
marker of endotoxemia) values compared to the other groups (27). These data
underlined the presence of strong activation of the monocytic lineage on hospital
admission due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in conjunct with LPS translocation and
inflammatory exacerbation in ICU patients (28). In according with this study, systemic
markers of monocyte activation, mainly sCD14 and sCD163, correlated with
inflammatory cytokines in a non-intensive care unit COVID-19 cohort patients (29).
It was previously postulated that perturbations in gut microbiota and microbial
translocation may exacerbate the severity of cytokine storm in COVID-19 (30).
Moreover, sCD14 tended to be higher at T2 in non-survivors COVID-19 patients.
Interestingly, heat map correlations revealed that sCD14 correlated with CCL4/MIP-1β
and CCL2/MCP-1, while LPS correlated with CCL5/RANTES and CCL4/MIP-1β.
These results suggest that microbial translocation may contribute to the increases in
chemokines, which recruits innate immune cells to the infectious site. In fact,
chemokines release is directly involved in the acute respiratory disease syndrome, a
major complication leading to death in severe COVID-19 infection (31,32). All the
chemokines evaluated here, CCL4/MIP-1β, CCL2/MCP-1 and CCL5/RANTES, are
upregulated early post SARS-CoV-2 infection and contribute to the migration of
inflammatory monocytes, natural killer cells and T cells to the infection site (33). Thus,
chemokines seem to be vital players during COVID-19 pathogenesis and the
hyperinflammatory condition of severe disease. Our data also indicate that there was no
difference between COVID-19 groups at hospital admission regarding chemokine or
cytokine concentrations.

However, we found increases in the systemic LPS levels concomitant with higher IL-6,
TNF-α, CCL/5/RANTES and CCL2/MCP-1 concentrations in the plasma of nonsurvivors group collected 24-72 h before the death of critical COVID-19 patients. Lucas
and coworkers (4) described a deregulated increase in inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines in severe COVID-19 illness patients who deceased during the
hospitalization, suggesting a maladapted immune response, and exacerbated
inflammatory induction associated with severe COVID-19 and poor clinical outcome.
Interestingly, COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units have strong cytokine response
compared to other types of pneumonia, and elevations of IL-6 levels during
hospitalization predicts ICU stay and mortality (34). Thus, the increases of
inflammatory mediators occur in conjunct with increased microbial translocations, as
suggested by increased LPS and sCD14 levels, in the blood of COVID-19 deceased
patients.
The enhanced hyperinflammatory condition associated with higher LPS levels at T2 in
non-survivors COVID-19 patients may contribute to systemic organ dysfunction. In this
line, gut permeability may increase during the hospitalization course and contribute to
the worsening of clinical outcomes because of respiratory distress syndrome caused by
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bacterial translocation during COVID-19 hospitalization
strongly correlates with immune activation, increased proinflammatory production by
innate immune cells and higher mortality rate (35). However, the interplay between
systemic inflammation and LPS release in the blood remains to be elucidated in future
studies involving COVID-19 cohorts.
Here, we hypothesized that serum factors, such as LPS and inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines, may directly impact the phenotype of monocytes. To address this question,
we incubated monocytic THP-1 lineage with the plasma samples of hospitalized

survivors and non-survivors COVID-19 patients obtained at hospital admission and in a
time compromising 0-72 hours before the final event (T1 and T2, respectively).
Interestingly, TLR4, the LPS ligand, increased only in non-survivors COVID-19
patients which corroborates with the higher systemic LPS levels in this group. In fact,
critically ill COVID-19 patients presented upregulation in TLR4 expression and the
disruption in pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production after monocyte
TLR4 stimulation similarly to the observed in bacterial sepsis (36).
Furthermore, spike protein binds to LPS to activate TLR4/NF-kB axis to modulate the
phenotype of monocytes. In this sense, we found increased CD69 expression on THP-1
cells incubated with T2 plasma of non-survivors COVID-19 patients, indicating an early
monocyte activation. However, no difference was observed in HLA-DR expression on
THP-1 cells after incubation with plasma of both groups. Thus, plasma obtained from
COVID-19 patients may have no impact on antigen presentation and long-term
activation of monocytes. On the other hand, plasma from survivors COVID-19 patients
collected at T2 moment increased CD16 expression in THP-1 cells. Data from literature
described higher percentages of CD14+CD16high monocytes and very low expression of
HLA-DR in all CD14+ monocyte subsets in severe COVID-19 patients (37–39). In this
sense, the mobilization of newly bone marrow monocytes associated with continuous
higher systemic and organ inflammation along the course of the acute infection, rather
than short-term stimulation, may impact in the changes of CD16 and HLA-DR
expression in circulating monocytes.
Severe COVID-19 patients presented an inflammatory phenotype of monocytes
associated with early activation and downregulation of HLA-DR (38,40). Monocytes
upregulate CD69 expression which promotes tissue infiltration and retention(41,42).
Increased activation and CD69 expression in monocytes of severe COVID-19 subjects

was associated with diapedesis and tissue infiltration, contributing to the monocytopenia
observed in the peripheral circulation of diseased patients(43). In this line, the increased
expression of CCR2, CCR5 and CCR7 in THP-1 incubated with T2 plasma of nonsurvivors COVID-19 patients may indicate the migratory stimulation of soluble factors
during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, THP-1 cells also presented higher CCR5
expression after the incubation with plasma of survivors COVID-19 patients obtained at
T2. Infiltrating monocytes constitute the majority of leukocytes migrating into the
infected lungs, contributing to the severe lung inflammation in COVID-19 (40). In fact,
increased transcription of CCR2 and CCR5 in macrophages present in bronchial
alveolar lavage fluid of severe COVID-19 patients (44). Furthermore, increased CCR2+
monocytes elicit calcium influx, producing higher levels of reactive oxygen radicals and
upregulates integrin expression to recruit neutrophils and mast cells, which exacerbates
the inflammatory local response and induces tissue damage (45–47). The activation of
CCR5+ in macrophages is linked to the signal transduction downstream of
Gαi/PI3K/AKT and Gαi/MEK/ERK pathways that induce anti-apoptotic activity,
maintaining inflammatory exhausted macrophages in the inflamed lung (48).
Interestingly, COVID-19 patients treated with lerolimab, an antibody used to block
CCR5, presented a rapid reduction of plasma IL-6, restoration of the CD4/CD8 ratio,
and a significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia (49). Antigen uptake by
human monocyte derived dendritic cells, during viral infections, increases the
expression of CCR7 that mediates the migration of antigen-bearing cells to lymphatic
tissue (50). Thus, the upregulation of CCR7 is crucial for the recruitment of antigen
presenting cells to secondary lymphoid organs during viral infections (51). Due to their
pivotal role in the migration of inflammatory monocytes to the infected tissues and
lymphoid organs, future experimental studies should be conducted to evaluate the

impact of monoclonal antibody therapies that blockade the overexpression of
chemokine receptors in severe COVID-19 hospitalization.
In conclusion, this study shed light on the modulation of microbial translocation
markers associated with inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood of survivors
and non-survivors COVID-19 patients during hospitalization. We also noted that plasma
samples of non-survivors COVID-19 patients impacts on the phenotype of monocyte
lineage cells, increasing the expression of early activation markers and selected
chemokine receptors. Our data indicates that deceased patients present a condition
characterized by microbial translocation that coexist with the inflammatory condition of
SARS-CoV-2 infection and could contribute to the observed alterations in the monocyte
phenotype and function.
