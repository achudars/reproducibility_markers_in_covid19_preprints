Abstract
Approximately 20-40% of SARS-CoV-2 infection is asymptomatic; however, data are
limited on drivers of such infection. Among over 730,000 SARS-CoV-2 test results in
Los Angeles between August-October, 2020, we found heterogenous frequencies of
asymptomatic infection among various sup-populations. Further research is needed to
delineate drivers of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Background
The economic impact of blanket closures in the wake of the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic will be felt for years to come (1). Among other instances of infectious disease
outbreaks, highly targeted interventions are feasible in part because we identify specific
exposures that place individuals at increased risk for infection. If we are able to
understand the exposures that drive the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we may be able to
mitigate the economic impact by facilitating narrower public health interventions.
Of particular interest are the exposures that result in asymptomatic infection,
which account for approximately 20-40% of infections (2) and contribute significantly to
the continued transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (3). Some studies suggest that younger age
and lack of other comorbidities may be particularly associated with asymptomatic
SARS-CoV-2 infection, however more detailed data are lacking (4). Given that the
spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic appears to be heterogeneous (5), concentrating
within specific hotspots of localized spread, developing a thorough understanding of the
drivers of asymptomatic infection may be instrumental in the fight against the pandemic.
We thus aimed to describe the frequency and prevalence of asymptomatic infection
among a community-based sample in Los Angeles.

Methods
We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results from a large testing program in Los
Angeles between August-October 2020. Individuals presented to testing and were
asked via a confidential online survey if in the last 14 days they had been contacted by
local public health authorities about a known SARS-CoV-2 exposure, they visited any of

a list of public places, or they spent time with five or more strangers. We collected those
data, as well as demographic data (age, gender, race, ethnicity, place of employment)
and report of any symptoms from a pre-specified list. We then conducted a crosssectional analysis to determine the frequency of infection among asymptomatic and
symptomatic individuals.
The Mass General Brigham institutional review board deemed the analysis of deidentified data did not constitute human subjects’ research (2020P003530).

Findings
We analyzed more than 730,000 test results (see Table), of which 54.4% were
among women and 41.6% reported Hispanic or Spanish ethnicity. The mean age was
34 years. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic individuals
was 4.2%. Among all who tested positive, 42.3% were asymptomatic. We found a
higher prevalence of asymptomatic infection among individuals who reported work in
construction and among racial and ethnic minorities. We also identified a higher
prevalence of asymptomatic infection among individuals who had been contacted by a
representative from a local health department regarding a known SARS-CoV-2
exposure.

Discussion
We identified a high proportion of asymptomatic infection among those who
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the prevalence of infection among the
asymptomatic fraction was high, providing support for screening of asymptomatic

individuals at risk for infection. The increased prevalence of infection (asymptomatic and
symptomatic) among those who reported being contacted by a representative from a
local health department about a known SARS-CoV-2 exposure provides strong
evidence of the benefits of contact-notification in case-identification.
The different frequencies of asymptomatic infection among the different
employment categories likely represent heterogeneity in risk of exposure. However,
further research into particular exposures within different occupations may be of use in
delineating the drivers of asymptomatic infection. Our data were limited in that we did
not have more exposure data related to dining or social behaviors.
Thus, testing centers should strive to routinely collect data on potential
exposures in the past 7 days. Data regarding specific venues of exposure (e.g. gyms,
places of worship, parks, museums, hospitals, nursing homes, overnight camps, hotels,
beaches, movie theaters, bars, restaurants, and airports) among individuals who test
both positive and negative will enable more precise delineation of recent transmission
events in real time. Such geographic information may function to enhance network
mobility data to identify recent hotspots and venues where transmission mitigation
efforts would be most helpful (6). More granular exposure data might enable public
health officials to move from broad county and state lockdowns towards a more,
targeted less harmful approach. The identification of particular high-risk activities or
business practices might allow regulators like state occupational safety and health
administrations to propose or enforce regulations to reduce the spread of infection.
Given the relatively low prevalence of infection in certain areas there is ample
opportunity to enhance prevention of SARS-CoV-2 spread through the use of exposure

data and strategic evidence-based interventions. In the meantime, continued screening
of at-risk persons regardless of symptom status is warranted.
