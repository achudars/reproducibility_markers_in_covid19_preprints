The impact of SARS-CoV-2 transmission fear and COVID-19 pandemic on
the mental health of patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders,
severe asthma, and other high-risk groups
Abstract
Background: The adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of high-risk
group patients for morbidity and mortality and its impact on public health in the long term
have not been clearly determined.
Objective: To determine the level of COVID-19 related transmission fear and anxiety in
healthcare workers and patients with primary immunodeficiency disorder (PID), severe
asthma, and the ones with other comorbidities.
Methods: The healthcare workers and patients with PID, severe asthma (all patients receiving
biological agent treatment), malignancy, cardiovascular disease, hypertension (90% of
patients receiving ACEI or ARB therapy), diabetes mellitus (42 % of patients receiving DPP4 inhibitor therapy) were included in the study. A total of 560 participants, 80 individuals in
each group, were provided. The hospital anxiety and depression scale ( HADS ) and Fear of
illness and virus evaluation (FIVE ) scales were applied to the groups with face to face
interview methods.
Results: The mean age was 49.30 ± 13.74 years and 306 (55 %) were female. The FIVE
Scale and HADS-A scale scores of health care workers were significantly higher than other
groups scores (p = 0.001 and 0.006). The second-highest scores belonged to patients with
PID. There was no significant difference between the groups for the HADS-D score (p=0.07).
The lowest score in all scales was observed in patients with hypertension.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated that in the pandemic process, patients with primary
immunodeficiency, asthma patients, and other comorbid patients, especially healthcare
workers, should be referred to the centers for the detection and treatment of mental health
conditions.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it causes,
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), became pandemic worldwide in 2020. When we
started to write the article (May 25, 2020), the total number of cases in the affected 215
countries of the world was 5.304.772 , and the total number of deaths was 342.029 . The total
number of cases was 156.827, and the total number of deaths in Turkey in 4340 (1, 2). The
spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to fatal. Pneumonia is the most common
serious infection, characterized by fever, dry cough ,dyspnea and bilateral infiltrates in chest
imaging (3, 4). COVID-19 also occurs in adults with severe disease in predominantly older
patients or patients with underlying medical comorbidities. Comorbidities associated with
severe disease and mortality include; primary or secondary immunodeficiency disease, preexisting pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and
malignancies (3, 5-7).
The main way of transmission and spread of the infection is with the respiratory tract and in
the form of clumps especially with close contact near the environment. Due to the acute
nature of the pandemic and the spread and infectious power of the virus, it will undoubtedly
cause anxiety, depression, and other psychological disorders in humans (8). People without
immune system defects can recover even with Covid-19 disease, but this may not be possible
in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiency. Patients with primary
immunodeficiency, whose health-related quality of life is lower than healthy people, will
particularly need mental health support in this process (9). Taking into account the
psychological status and mental health support of primary immunodeficiency patients, severe
asthma patients, and other patients with comorbidities ( malignancy, cardiovascular system
diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension ), which are the high risk patient groups in terms of
morbidity and mortality in the COVID-19 pandemic process, is crucial.
In our study, we compare COVID-19 transmission fear induced anxiety and depression in
patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders who are naturally susceptible to infections,
between other comorbid patients and those healthcare workers in the frontline of the COVID19 pandemic.

Methods
Objective, Study design and Setting
Objective of the study : To determine the level of COVID-19 related transmission fear and
anxiety in PID patients, severe allergic asthma and severe eosinophilic asthma patients,
patients with other comorbidities,and health workers. Thus, to reveal the necessity of
supportive

psychological treatments, which are ignored simultaneously by giving full

attention to improving vaccines and other therapies that

control infection during the

pandemic process.
Study design: After the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed on March 11 2020, a
pandemic action plan was initiated in all units at Necmettin Erbakan University Meram
Faculty of Medicine. Hospital buildings are divided into two parts: pandemic hospital and
non-pandemic patient care hospital. Treatment of patients with primary immunodeficiency
and other patients continued at the non-pandemic hospital. The common view of
immunoglobulin therapy in our clinical immunology clinic is SCIG therapy in patients who
can adapt since the majority of our patients with primary immunodeficiency come from
remote areas. Before the pandemic, SCIG treatment hands-on training was given to all
patients who were eligible for the clinic, but only half were able to adapt. Total 80 primary
immunodeficiency patients (58 CVID, 5 CID, 2 Wiskott Aldrich syndrome, 3 Hyper Ig E
syndrome, 8 symptomatic isolated NK deficiency, 3 Chronic Granulomatous Disease, 1
Bloom Syndrome), 80 patients with severe asthma (63 patients receiving Omalizumab
therapy, 17 patients receiving Mepolizumab therapy), 80 HT patients (72 patients receiving
ACEI or ARB therapy), 80 DM patients (38 receiving DPP-4 inhibitor therapy), 80 patients
with cardiovascular system diseases (42 Arrhythmia Patients, 26 congestive heart failure, 12
patients with coronary artery disease), 80 malignancy patients (22 colorectal carcinomas, 18
breast carcinomas, 17 lung carcinomas, 5 prostate carcinomas, 4 pancreatic carcinomas, 4
endometrium carcinomas, 3 gastric carcinomas, 3 cervix uteri carcinomas, 3 bladder
carcinomas, 1 HCC) and 80 health-care workers (36 doctors, 20 nurses, 13 patient caregivers,
6 cleaners, 5 medical secretaries) actively working to combat the COVID-19 pandemic were
included in the study. We started the study on April 20, and we closed the survey on May 15.
Verbal informed consent was obtained from all participants. Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS) and Fear of Illness and Virus Evaluation (FIVE) scales were applied to the

groups with face to face interview methods. The results of the groups were compared with
each other.
Setting: Questionnaires of patients with primary immunodeficiency and severe asthma

Erbakan
performed

University, Konya/Turkey. Questionnaires of

patients with malignancy were

in the Clinical Oncology Department, the questionnaires of patients with

cardiovascular system disease and hypertension patients were organized in the Cardiology
department of the same faculty. The questionnaires of diabetes patients were conducted in the
Department of Endocrinology and metabolism diseases of Kocaeli University Faculty of
Medicine. In these two hospitals, questionnaires were applied to healthcare workers who are
actively working to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of

COVID-19

infection was high in both hospitals.

Questionnaires
Fear of Illness and Virus Evaluation (FIVE) Scale
The Fear of Illness and Virus Evaluation (FIVE) Scale was created by Prof. Dr. Jill
Ehrenreich-May from Miami University. The scale translated to Turkish and firstly used by
Dr. Zekiye Çelikbaş from Gaziosmanpaşa University. The scale has 3 forms: Adult, Child,
and Parent form. Adult form was used in our study. The answers are scored in a 4-point Likert
format and 1-4. The scale consists of 4 parts: Fears about Contamination and Illness (9-item,
9-36

score ranging) , Fears about Social Distancing (10-item, 10-40 score ranging) ,

Behaviors Related to Illness and Virus Fears (14-item, 14-56 score ranging ), Impact of
Illness and Virus Fears (2-item, 2-8 score ranging). There are a total of 35 items on the scale
and the total score ranges from 35 to 140. In the use of the scale, permission was obtained
from those who prepared both the original and Turkish forms.

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
The scale was developed by Zigmond and Snaith (10). It is used to screen depression and
anxiety in those with medical illnesses. The scale consists of 14 items; 7 of them assess
anxiety and 7 of them assess depression. Answers are scored between 0-3 in quadruple Likert
formats. The lowest score that patients can get from both subscales (anxiety and depression

subscale) is 0 and the highest score is 21. Turkish reliability and validity were done by
Aydemir et al. The Turkish version of the HAD scale has been found to be valid and reliable
in medical patients ( Cronbach’s α of 0.8525 and 0.7784 for the HAD anxiety subscale
and depression subscale respectively) . In the Turkish version of the HAD scale, the cut-off
score for anxiety subscale was found to be 10 and 7 for depression subscale (11).

Statistical analysis
SPSS version 22.0 statistical package software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States)
was used for statistical analyses. Continuous variables are demonstrated as mean ± standard
deviation, median (min-max), and categorical variables as numbers and percentages.
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used for evaluating the normality of distribution. When
parametric test assumptions are provided, Independent-Samples T-Test

and

One-way

ANOVA test, when parametric test assumptions are not provided, Mann-Whitney U test and
Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare independent group differences. The linear relation
between the continuous variables was evaluated using Pearson (r) correlation analysis. ROC
analysis method was used for diagnostic performance analysis of variables. The chi-square
test was performed to compare the study groups in terms of categorical variables. The
threshold for significance was defined at p < 0.05.

Results
Patients with PID, severe asthma, malignancy, CVS disease, HT, DM , and healthcare
workers were included in the study. It provided 560 participants, including 80 from each
group. In this study, there were 306 (55%) female and 254 (45%) male subjects. When the
groups were evaluated separately, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of
gender and age ( p = 0.08 and 0.46 ) ( Table 1 ).
In the period of before the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of subjects who received
professional support for their mental problem was the highest in the healthcare workers group
( 28.75% , 23/80). In other groups, this rate was as follows: 16.25% (13/80) in PID group,
15% (12/80) in severe asthma group, 10% (8/80) in malignancy group, 18.75% in CVS
disease group (15 / 80), 11.25% (9/80) in the HT group and 11.25% (9/80) in the DM group
(p = 0.02). Considering those who received professional support for their mental problems
during the COVID-19 pandemic process, the highest rate was again determined in the
healthcare workers group (11.25 %, 9/80, p = 0.4) (Table 1).
Regarding the evaluation of all participants, there were a strong positive correlation between
FIVE scale scores and anxiety (r=0.828; p<0.001) (Figure 1) and pearson correlation analysis
showed a moderate positive correlation between FIVE scale scores and depression (r = 0.660;
p<0.001) (Figure 2). The effectiveness of FIVE scales in distinguishing participants with and
without anxiety; the scale’s cut-off total score was 96 , with 79.1 % sensitivity and 86.6 %
specificity. FIVE scale was found to have a significant discrimination power. (AUC = 0.870,
p <0.0001, 95% CI (lower bound – upper bound) = 0.836 - 0.904 ) (Table 3). The ability of
the FIVE scales to distinguish participants with and without depression was significant,
though not as high as in anxiety. When scale cut-off total score 96 was taken, sensitivity
was 62.8 % and specificity was 76.9 % (AUC = 0.760, p <0.0001, 95% CI (lower bound –
upper bound) = 0.717 - 0.803 ) (Table 4).
The healthcare workers group had the highest score in 4 subscales (Fears about
Contamination and Illness, Fears about Social Distancing, Behaviors Related to Illness and
Virus Fears, Impact of Illness and Virus Fears) and on the whole scale of FIVE (p <0.001
for all). The second group with the highest score after the health care workers (100.3±20.5)
in the total scale score was the PID group (94.6 ± 13.6). The lowest score in the scale was
observed in patients with hypertension (71.3 ± 19.3) (Table 2).

The participants were evaluated in terms of anxiety and depression according to the cut-off
values (10 points for HADS-A and 7 points for HADS-D ) determined in the Turkish
validation study of the HADS scale. The group with the highest proportion of participants
with a HADS-A score higher than the limit value was the healthcare workers (51.2%, 41/80)
then respectively PID (45%, 36/80), malignancy (35%, 28/80) and severe asthma (35%,
28/80) group participants. The group with the lowest rate was the HT group (23.7%, 19/80) ,
(p = 0.006) (Table 2 ).
In the HADS-D subscale, there was no statistically significant difference between groups
(p=0.07). Nevertheless, the group with the highest score was the participants with malignancy
(46.2%, 37/80). PID patients (41.2%, 33/80) and healthcare workers (40%, 32/80) were the
other groups with the highest HADS-D subscale score. In this subscale, the lowest rate
belonged to the HT group participants (% 26.8, 21/80) (p=0.07) (Table 2).

Discussion
Survey results reported by patients in clinical practice have been proposed as a means of
improving doctor-patient communication, revealing patients' problems, screening functional
problems (9). In the current study we applied a new scale, Fear of Illness and Virus
Evaluation (FIVE) . The FIVE scale was evaluated as a useful assessment method for the
detection of anxiety and depression due to fear of disease and virus transmission. The results
indicate that the FIVE scale and HADS-A scale scores of health care workers running to
fight COVID-19 pandemic were significantly higher than those of the primary
immunodeficiency patients and other comorbidity patient groups scores (p = 0.001 and
0.006). The second-highest score after healthcare workers belonged to patients with primary
immunodeficiency. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the
HADS-D score (p=0.07) ; on the other hand, the highest score belonged to patients with
malignancy. The lowest score in all scales was observed in patients with hypertension.
Primary immune deficiency disorders are a group of more than 400 congenital immune
defects that continue to expand with discovered novel defects (12) . Some defects affect basic
immunological pathways and result in susceptibility to both common and opportunistic
pathogens, resulting in recurrent or chronic infections in most patients (13). In a study of
children with primary immunodeficiency, a higher mental health disorder was detected in
these patients than in children with chronic diseases such as severe asthma and chronic renal
disease (14). These mental health disorders include depression, anxiety, somatization, social
withdrawal and decreased social skills. Besides, 18% of pediatric-onset CVID patients had
depression and were associated with mortality, especially in patients with delayed diagnosis
(15). Patients with primary immunodeficiencies are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, and
the disease it causes COVID-19, similar to other infectious agents, compared to immunecompetent individuals (9). So, it is inevitable that the COVID-19 pandemic impacts healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) and the risk of anxiety/depression in patients with primary
immunodeficiency. In patients with primary immunodeficiency, anxiety and depression were
significantly higher compared to the healthy population. Mental disorders contribute to PID
morbidity and mortality (15). In order to improve the quality of life in these patients, referrals
should be made as soon as possible, and treatment should be started (16).
Severe asthma is defined by the presence of ≥ 3 of the following criteria: having >2 asthma
attacks per week, having asthma-induced night awakenings, the constant need a reliever

(short-acting beta-2 agonist) for controlling asthma symptoms, and extremely limited normal
activation (17). Recent studies have shown that stress might increase the risk of asthma and
asthma-related morbidity by affecting the immune system (18). Although asthma does not
seem to be a severe risk factor for COVID-19, poorly controlled asthma can lead to a more
complicated course of disease for patients with COVID-19 (19). However, in a recently
published study authors reported that the most common comorbidities among young patients
hospitalized for COVID-19 are asthma, diabetes, and obesity (20). Due to the role of asthma
in

COVID-19 prognosis uncertain

yet, anxiety remains high in patients. Asthma is a

susceptible disease to viral infections, and about 80% of asthma exacerbations are associated
with viral infections. In allergic asthmatic patients, allergic sensitization and eosinophilic
inflammation can disrupt the integrity of the airway epithelium. Thereby paving the way for
limiting the ability of viruses clearance and foster the location of

viruses in the lower

respiratory tract. Therefore, it is thought that biologic agents, such as Omalizumab (an antiIgE antibody) and Mepolizumab (a monoclonal antibody to IL-5), which are used in the
treatment of severe allergic or eosinophilic asthma , may have positive effects on the
prognosis of COVID-19 (21). Thus, the risk of COVID-19 related anxiety is also expected
to be lower as virus induced asthma exacerbations will decrease as a result of using biological
agents in these patients. The results of our study also support this theory.
There are some pandemic specific problems on the basis of higher FIVE scale scores and
HADS-A scores in healthcare workers. One of the main causes of this distress in healthcare
workers is the fear of being infected with the virus and spreading it to their families (22).
This fear requires isolation from their families and they are also deprived of family support.
Changes in the workplace, increase in working hours and workload are other factors that
negatively affect the mental health of healthcare workers. In addition, social stigmatization
and exclusion behaviors towards healthcare workers, who are considered to be the most
exposed to the virus by the public, contribute to mental stress (23). The increase in the
number of cases and mortality rates, as well as witnessing critical illnesses and deaths of their
colleagues increase the mental breakdown (24). The shortage of

personal protective

equipment (PPE) and other materials is one of the essential reasons that increase anxiety for
transmission (25). It is essential to take urgent measures to protect the mental health of
healthcare workers and the smooth running of health services. The measures that can be taken
in this regard are:

- Working hours should be arranged; breaks should be planned by considering physical and
mental health.
- Personal protective equipment should be supplied in sufficient numbers, and a sense of trust
should be created in the employees.
- Frontline employees should be changed at certain intervals to share risk
- Family, friends should be allowed to support (education of relatives of health professionals
should be provided)
- Rewards should be made
- The detected mood changes should be treated at an early stage, without turning into
permanent psychological disorders.
In a recent study from Wuhan, China, severe symptoms, need for mechanical ventilation, and
risk of death was higher in patients with malignancy compared to COVID-19 patients without
cancer (26). Psychiatric disorders such as major depression are more common in patients with
malignancy compared to the general population (27). Depression is often accompanied by
anxiety in these patients (28). It is crucial to support patients with malignancy and improve
the quality of life, who have a predisposition to mental health disorders, against the adverse
psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic process (29).
Patients with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular system disease, and hypertension have been
demonstrated to be associated with an increased risk of severe disease and mortality risk for
COVID-19 (30-32). SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell by binding to the ACE2 surface receptor.
The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds directly to the cell surface ACE2 receptor of the host
cell, thereby facilitating the entry and replication of the virus into the cell (33). Based on this
information, speculation about renin-angiotensin system inhibitors that may increase ACE2
levels and the use of these drugs will adversely affect the prognosis of COVID-19, which has
ended with multicentre and extensive patient studies. The same applies to speculation between
DPP-4 inhibitor drugs and diabetes mellitus prognosis concerning the COVID-19 (34). In our
study, where we evaluated the mental health of comorbidity patients with high risk in terms
of COVID-19 prognosis, the group with the lowest scores were patients with hypertension.
However, according to our findings, even in patients with hypertension who received the

lowest scale scores and relatively better than other patient groups, only a quarter of patients
who need psychological support are still receiving treatment.
Nowadays, the focus is on drugs and vaccine discovery for the eradication of COVID-19,
ignoring the mental health status of healthcare professionals, patients with primary
immunodeficiency, asthma patients and other comorbidity patient groups, will have important
implications for the community in the long run. Authorities and clinicians should provide
support and take precautions in this regard before time.
The present study has several limitations. First, only a part of the participants had official
diagnoses obtained by examining mental health professionals. Patients who were found
meaningful in terms of mental health disorders with scales evaluation were referred to the
psychiatry clinic. However, due to the harmful effects of the pandemic process, information
feedbacks were not received. Second, since the study was performed during the pandemic
process and in a hospital setting by face-to-face interview method, it was not compared with
the mental health of the control group without comorbidity from the general population.
Finally, it cannot be denied that the face-to-face interview method between the participants
and the physicians in hospital settings may impact individuals' mental health in the pandemic
process. Even if the COVID-19 patients were not followed in these clinics and special
measures were taken for the care of other patients.
In our knowledge, the current study is the first article to compare fear of infection
transmission related anxiety and depression in adults with primary immunodeficiency and
other high-risk group patients. Also, no published study has been found in the literature on the
similar subject of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that the study will increase
knowledge, especially in determining the anxiety and depression levels of patients with
primary immunodeficiency, to be treated and to improve their quality of life.

Conclusion
This study demonstrated that

in the pandemic process, patients with primary

immunodeficiency, asthma patients, and other comorbid patients, especially healthcare
workers, should be referred to the centers for the detection and treatment of mental health
conditions. Due to the mental disorders caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the authorities
should take precautions to prevent healthcare services from being interrupted and prevent
harmful effects on the general population's mental health.
