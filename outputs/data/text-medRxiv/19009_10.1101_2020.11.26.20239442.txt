Summary
This study by Profamilia Association focuses on the social response to COVID19 by reporting and analyzing the
answers to two surveys carried out between April 16 and 25, and throughout September 2020. The study aims to
identify changes in behaviors and immediate expectations after the quarantine was lifted. In general, results show
that people have adopted behavioral changes such as wearing face masks, avoiding people with symptoms, and
reducing mobility. However, it also shows that people's concerns have doubled for many reasons, ranging from
mental health issues, neglected sexual and reproductive health needs, the burden of care for others, and working
from home. Similarly, it was found that some people would accept significant long-term changes such as accepting
most children continuing to be homeschooled or employees choosing whether to work or not, targeted quarantines
in neighborhoods that show high number of cases; and making the use of face masks mandatory in case a vaccine
or treatment for Covid-19 does not become available. This means that during the quarantine and compared to April,
many people consider these options to be acceptable in the long term.
The survey was filled out online via SurveyMonkey by 1,735 people in Colombia between 1st and 11th September,
2020. Overall, 17% mentioned that they had participated in the previous survey, Estudio Solidaridad I early stage of
quarantine (April 2020). The following is a summary of the main findings based on the comparison of the two surveys
in hopes to show evidence for changes in behavior, hygiene, levels of measure compliance, unmet needs, and to
show people´s immediate expectations after six months of strict quarantine.

An online survey was conducted in Colombia between April 8 and 20, 2020, and it was filled out by 3549 adults. This
survey analyzed individuals' social response to the measures adopted by the government to control COVID-19
regarding three different areas. Behaviors of hygiene, physical distancing such as a reduction in mobility and the
ability to engage in mandatory and voluntary quarantines, and respondent perceptions of risk and ability to protect
oneself and others (1); Unmet sexual and reproductive health needs (2); and the impact on mental health, and
respondents´ perception of the response by the government (3). This first assessment also identified that there are
at least three groups of people in the country who respond differently to the pandemic: those who resist the situation
(34%), those who suffer from it (26%), and those who accept it (40%) (4).
Research in other countries has shown the importance of carrying out this type of study during gradual lifting or
deconfinement periods, also known as the “relaxation” phase. The implications of lifting strict measures and the
possibility for people to be released from quarantine require a series of physical distancing policies, alternative
measures, testing, and efficient tracking of cases during, as well as considering the possibility of new outbreaks, even
when COVID-19 is apparently under control (5-7).
Much of the physical distancing measures have started to be loosened in Colombia, and major cities are preparing
for the so-called "new normal." In the country, changes in behavior and immediate expectations during the national
government's relaxation phase are yet to be explored. Therefore, it is considered necessary and equally important
to research changes in behavior, hygiene, compliance with physical distancing measures (mandatory and voluntary
quarantine measures), and perceptions of risk and protection to care for oneself and others, unmet sexual and
reproductive health needs, mental health effects, and perceptions of the government's response to the pandemic.
Again, this this new quarantine lifting phase offers a research opportunity to generate relevant and timely evidence
to analyze behavioral changes to respond to COVID-19.
General Objective: To analyze changes in behavior and immediate expectations during the relaxation and
deconfinement phase decreed by the national government.
Study Design and Survey Implementation
•

•
•

Observational study based on a descriptive exploratory study.
Total sample size was 1,735 adults (18 years and older) nationwide.
The survey was conducted between September 1 and 11, 2020.
The survey was conducted online using SurveyMonkey and was sent by email to contacts in Profamilia's
database and included partners and social networks (Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp) and people who
participated in the previous Solidaridad I survey.

Methods
Study and Sample Design
This research was a cross-sectional descriptive exploratory study. The online survey was developed on
SurveyMonkey® and a non-probabilistic snowball sample was used to disseminate it because it allows the sample
size to increase as the people initially selected to invite others to participate. The total number of completed surveys
for analysis was 1,735. The survey was conducted in all departments of the country, except for Casanare, Vichada,
Guainía, and Vaupés.

The survey in Colombia had six components: 1) socio-demographic characteristics; 2) care and employment burden
of care; 3) perceptions of risk and protection; 4) behavior changes; 5) community mobilization and resilient
practices; and 6) immediate changes and expectations.
Among the advantages of implementing an online survey through SurveyMonkey® is the speed and ease in which
it is conducted as well as the opportunity it presented to take advantage of the quarantine, moment in which many
households increased their connectivity and online presence. Among the limitations found was the sampling
method being biased because people tended to share the survey with people who had similar characteristics.
Therefore, the sample may represent specific population groups more distinctly. A second limitation is that the
results obtained are not representative for the country as a whole. The collection, filtering, processing, and analysis
of information and data was carried out by The Research and Project Management team at Profamilia in Bogotá,
D.C. The research protocol was approved by Profamilia's Research Ethics Committee (CEIP 14-2020 05) in the August
25, 2020 session.
The sociodemographic characteristics considered were age, gender, area of residence, vulnerability groups, level of
education, ethnicity, marital status, department (region) of residence, type of health insurance, employment status,
and household income. Perception of risk and health was measured by perceived susceptibility. To establish
susceptibility, people were asked about their perception on their perceived likelihood of being infected with COVID19, their mental and sexual, and reproductive health under current preventive measures imposed by the Colombian
government.
Behavioral changes included the perceived effectiveness and adoption of preventive behaviors to avoid infection
and subsequent transmission, based on three question categories: 1) hygiene practices; 2) travel suspension; 3)
physical distancing. Willingness and ability to engage in mandatory isolation and physical distancing was measured
using the following question: During the past 5 months, which of the following measures have you personally taken
to protect yourself and others from COVID-19? This includes not going to work, school, or other public places, and
avoiding public transportation or cabs.
Community engagement was measured by two categories of questions: actions taken and community engagement.
For measures taken, the survey asked: 1) In your neighborhood, community, apartment complex, township, or
district, have measures been taken or have campaigns been conducted to prevent the spread of COVID-19?; 2)
What measures that you know of have been implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19? and 3) What kind
of measures would you like to see implemented in your community to keep you safe and reduce any risks? To
measure engagement, we asked: How would you like to be involved in the community to support and cope with

2) Changes in Personal Response and Compliance with Measures
An increase can be observed in the percentage of people who adopted measures to protect themselves and others
against COVID-19 from the start of the quarantine when compared to the relaxation stage. The largest increases
were reported in the use of face masks (28%), travel suspensions (20%) and going out to social events (11%). (Figure
4).

• People between 40 and 59 years of age adopted hygiene and self-care practices as well as preventive behaviors
associated with physical distancing in greater percentages to prevent COVID-19.
• By gender, the most significant differences between the adopted behaviors were found in changing clothes upon
returning home, which was 59% among men and 69% among women; in washing or disinfecting items taken
home, 71% for men and 82% for women; and in increasing the frequency of cleaning at home/work, 56% among
men and 66% among women.
3) Changes in Compliance with the Mandatory Quarantine
77% adopted the government's mandatory preventive isolation; of these people, 42% started working from home.
The percentage of people who began working from home is lower among women heads of household (26%) and
victims of the armed conflict (28%), which reveals that conditions for informal workers and vulnerable populations
is less flexible.

7) Changes in Unmet Sexual and Reproductive Health Needs.
Regarding Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) attention needs in the COVID-19 context presented as follows:
• 39% of people have had some need for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care.
• Among young people (18 to 29 years of age) (51%), people with a family income of less than one million pesos
per month (48%), people from the LGBTI community (48%) and women (43%) had the highest percentages related
to sexual and reproductive health service needs. Of the people who had some need for sexual and reproductive
health care, a little more than half did not receive the required treatment(s) (53.4%).
Amongst women, the main sexual and reproductive health needs are:
• 27% gynecological visits.
• 20% access to contraceptives (condoms, IUD, pills, injections, implants, etc.)
• 16% contraceptive visits.
53% of the women who had some SRH-related need did not get proper treatment. Among the main causes for not
getting appropriate treatment, we found that:
• 30% did not get treatment because they preferred not to leave home until the end of the quarantine.
• 29% did not get treatment because health care providers suspended their health care services as a result of the
quarantine.
• 28% did not get treatment because they did not know whether their health care service was available (lack of
information).
• 27% did not get treatment because they did not have the money to pay for the service and/or product.
• 21% did not get treatment because their health care provider has not authorized it or has delayed it.
Amongst men, the main sexual and reproductive health needs are:
• 9% Access to contraceptives (condoms, IUD, pills, injections, implants, etc.)
• 9% Urological visits.
• 7% Diagnostic tests for Sexually Transmitted Diseases.
• 6% Medical consults regarding the use of Contraceptives.
57% of the men who had some SRH-related need did not get proper treatment; among the main causes for the
inadequacy of treatment, we found that:
• 39% did not get treatment because they opted to remain at home for the duration of the quarantine.
• 35% did not get treatment because health care providers suspended their health care services as a result of the
quarantine.

• 33% did not get treatment because they did not know whether their health care service was available (lack of
information).
• 23% did not get treatment because their health care provider has not authorized it or has delayed it.
Among non-normative gender individuals (11 people), 6 people claimed to have at least one sexual and reproductive
health need; only 3 were able to get treatment(s). Among the reproductive health needs were: 4 cases of people
needing gynecological visits; 3 cases of people needing access to contraceptives; 3 cases in which individuals needed
STD screenings; 2 cases in which respondents needed contraceptive visits and 1 case in which the person needed
endocrinological consults (hormonization, hormone replacement therapy). Some of the reasons why individual needs
have not been met are as follows: 2 people did not access the services because they did could not afford the service;
2 people preferred not to leave home until the end of the quarantine; in 1 case, they did not know whether the
service was available (lack of information); in 1 case, the service was not attainted because the service was not
available in their municipality and finally, in 1 case, the service hours during the quarantine did not adapt to the study
and work schedules of the respondent.
Sexual and reproductive health needs have increased since the beginning of the quarantine, mainly those in
gynecology services (12%), access to contraceptives (12%) and contraceptive visits (11%) (Figure 9).

month of the quarantine and categorizes results by age group:
• The 18-29-year-old group has often felt tired for no evident reason (78%), nervous (66%), restless (65%) and
experienced loss of sleep (62%), compared to the 49+ age group who felt less tired, nervous, restless or did not
experience loss of sleep in the same frequency.
• Among the 49+ age group, feeling tired (54%) was more common during the last month of quarantine and perhaps
was the greatest reported mental health issue.

Key Messages.
1. Protective measures such as wearing face masks and avoiding going out to social events increased. People who
had to go out during quarantine did so mainly to: go to work, look for work, or due issues with anxiety or depression.
2. Changes in people's sexual lives were reported, and it was possible to evidence a drop in basic access to health
services such as services related to access to contraceptives and specialized medical visits such as gynecology and
endocrinology. These explain certain unmet needs in sexual and reproductive health as reported, which, in turn,
are explained by the increase in barriers to access these specific services. Among the most frequently reported
barriers, we found: delays in authorization for health care services (by health care providers), lack of financial
resources, lack of information such as people not knowing that the service was available, and people´s fear of going
out.
3. Mental health issues (feeling fatigued and hopeless) and worries (the pandemic not being controlled and the
vaccine not reaching the country soon) increased during quarantine. Most people have experienced mental health
problems, especially young female heads of household (39 years of age). Living in quarantine increased low selfesteem, fatigue, feelings of fear or hopelessness, as well as anxiety and stress compared to the survey performed
in April.
4. Regarding expectations, some people say they would accept significant changes in the long term if a vaccine or
treatment does not become readily available: they agree that children should continue being educated from home;
that employees should be able to choose whether to work from home or at the office; that the use of face masks
should be made mandatory and that targeted quarantines should be implemented in areas with a high number of
cases. More than half of the people think they will be able to get the COVID-19 vaccine within six months or more,
and they also think that life will return to normal in a year or more.
