Abstract:

108

Objectives: The rapidly evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared a

109

pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. It was first detected in the city of

110

Wuhan in China and has spread globally resulting in substantial health and economic crisis in

111

many countries. Observational studies have partially identified the different aspects of this

112

disease. Up to this date, no comprehensive systematic review for the clinical, laboratory,

113

epidemiologic and mortality findings has been published. We conducted this systematic review

114

and meta-analysis for a better understanding of COVID-19.

115

Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature published from January 1, 2019 to March 3, 2020.

116

Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College

117

Station, TX, USA). The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using

118

random effect model. Publication bias was assessed and p <0.05 was considered a statistically

119

significant publication bias.

120

Results: Out of 1102 studies, 32 satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 4789 patients with a

121

mean age of 49 years were evaluated. Fever (83.0%, CI 77.5 to 87.6), cough (65.2%, CI 58.6 to

122

71.2) and myalgia/fatigue (34.7, CI 26.0 to 44.4) were the most common symptoms. The most

123

prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (18.5 %, CI 12.7 to 24.4) and Cardiovascular disease

124

(14.9 %, CI 6.0 to 23.8). Among the laboratory abnormalities, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP)

125

(72.0% (CI 54.3 to 84.6) and lymphopenia (50.1%, CI 38.0 to 62.4) were the most common

126

findings. Bilateral ground-glass opacities (66.0%, CI 51.1 to 78.0) was the most common CT-Scan

presentation. Pooled mortality rate was 6.6%, with males having significantly higher mortality

128

compared to females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 9.1, P = 0.01).

129

Conclusion: COVID-19 commonly presented with a progressive course of cough and fever with

130

more than half of hospitalized patients showing leukopenia or a high CRP on their laboratory

131

findings. Mortality associated with COVID19 was higher than that reported in studies in China

132

with Males having a 3-fold higher risk of mortality in COVID19 compared to females.

135

What is already known in this topic:

136

•

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020.

137

•

Many observational studies have separately dealt with different clinical and epidemiologic

138
139

features of this new and rapidly evolving disease.
•

Very few systematic reviews about COVID-19 have been done and there was still a need

140

for a systematic review and meta-analysis related to the clinical findings and the mortality

141

of the disease in order to have a better understanding of COVID-19.

142
143

144

•

Previous reports have indicated that older age and presence of multiple comorbidities are
associated with increased mortality.

What this study adds:

145

•

The mortality rate in our study for hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 6.6% and males

146

had around 3-fold higher risk of mortality compared to females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2-9.1,

147

P = 0.01).

148
149

•

These findings could indicate the need for more aggressive treatment of COVID-19 in
males.

Introduction

163

Facing an immediate crisis by the novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

164

Coronavirus 2, (SARS-CoV-2), which has been called the once in a century pathogen requires a

165

global response to this outbreak(1). The disease caused by this virus has been named

166

“coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization. As of now, more than

167

168 countries have reported COVID19 patients. Given the increasing number of countries infected

168

with SARS-CoV-2, WHO declared COVID19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.(2) The SARS-CoV-

169

2 virus is a betacoronavirus and like the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV)

170

and SARS-CoV that caused the previous respiratory syndrome outbreaks, belongs to the family

171

of coronaviruses. However, this is the first pandemic caused by a member of the coronavirus

172

family (3).

173
174

COVID19 started in China in December 2019 when a cluster of patients with pneumonia of

175

unknown cause was identified in the city of Wuhan. Since then, it has infected hundreds of

176

thousands of people around the world and resulted in more than 13000 deaths up to this date (4).

177

Despite governmental travel restrictions in many countries, the confirmed number of new cases

178

has been rising globally. The international community has asked for at least US$675 million for

179

preparedness and protection of states with weaker health systems (5).

181

In the previous two outbreaks of coronaviral respiratory illness, namely Severe Acute Respiratory

182

Illness (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Illness (MERS), gender-based difference in mortality

183

was observed. In SARS, younger males were at twice the risk of death compared to females and

184

the difference in mortality reduced with older age(6). The case fatality rate observed in males was

185

twice that of females in MERS (7). The effect of sex on COVID-19 mortality was unknown. We

186

evaluated this risk for COVID-19 patients as well.

187
188

The novelty of COVID19 has raised many questions about the epidemiology of the disease,

189

clinical and laboratory methods of diagnosis as well as therapeutic measures. Thus far, many

190

observational studies have been dealing with these features separately, however, there is still a

191

necessity for more systematic reviews specially to understand role of the sex in mortality of

192

COVID19. In this meta-analysis study, we reviewed the published literature from January 1, 2019

193

to March 3, 2020 to provide an overview for a better understanding of COVID-19.

Search strategy

197

We searched Pubmed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library for studies

198

published from January 1, 2019 to March 3, 2020. The search strategy was based on the following

coronavirus and Wuhan pneumonia. Lists of references of selected articles and relevant review

203

articles were hand-searched to identify further studies. This study was conducted and reported

204

according to the PRISMA guidelines (8). The study did not require any ethics committee approval.

205

This research was done without patient involvement. Patients were not invited to comment on the

206

study design and were not consulted to develop patient relevant outcomes or interpret the results.

207

Patients were not invited to contribute to the writing or editing of this document for readability or

208

209

Study Selection

210

The records found through database searching were merged and the duplicates were removed

211

using EndNote X7 (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY, USA). Two reviewers (YF and PJ)

212

independently screened the records by title and abstract to exclude those not related to the current

213

study. The full texts of potentially eligible records were retrieved and evaluated by a third reviewer

214

(AT). Included studies met the following inclusion criteria: (i) patients were confirmed and

215

diagnosed with RT-PCR as suggested by WHO; (ii) The raw data for clinical, radiological and

216

laboratory findings were included; and (iii) the outcomes were addressed. Studies with insufficient

217

information about patients’ characteristics and outcomes were excluded. Case reports, reviews,

218

and animal studies were also excluded. Only studies written in English were selected.

220

A data extraction form was designed by two reviewers (AZ and SH). These reviewers extracted

221

the data from all eligible studies and differences were resolved by consensus. The following data

222

were extracted: first author name; year of publication; type of study, country/ies where the study

223

was conducted; distribution of age and sex in the population, number of patients investigated,

224

data for clinical, radiological and laboratory findings, and outcomes.

225

Data Synthesis and Analysis

226

Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College

227

Station, TX, USA). The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using

228

random effect model. The between-study heterogeneity was assessed by Cochran’s Q and the

229

I2 statistic. Publication bias was assessed statistically by using Begg’s and Egger's tests (p<0.05

230

was considered indicative of statistically significant publication bias).

231

Quality assessment

232

The checklist provided by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) was used to perform quality

233

assessment(9).

234

235

Results

236

The search yielded 1102 publications, of which 259 potentially eligible studies were identified for

237

full-text review, resulting in 32 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria (Figure 1) (Table1). The mean

238

age of the patients was 49.0 years and 4789 patients were included. Based on JBI tool, the

239

included studies had a low risk of bias.

240

Clinical manifestations

241

The most common signs and symptoms were fever (83.0%, CI 77.5-87.6), cough (65.2%, CI 58.6-

242

71.2), dyspnea (27.4%, CI 19.6-35.2), myalgia/fatigue (34.7, CI 26.0-44.4) followed by hemoptysis

243

(2.4%, CI 0.8-6.7), diarrhea (5.7%, CI 3.8-8.6) and nausea/vomiting (5.0 %, CI 2.3-10.7). Sputum

244

production (17.2%, CI 10.8-26.4) was a relatively common symptom. (Table 2).

245

Comorbidities

246

The most common comorbidities were respectively hypertension (18.5 %, CI 12.7-24.4),

247

cardiovascular diseases (14.9 %, CI 6.0-23.8), diabetes (10.8 %, CI 8.3-13.3), chronic liver

248

disease (8.1, CI 4.6-11.6) and smoking (8.0%, CI 2.3-13.6) (Table 3).

249

Laboratory findings

250

The most frequent abnormal laboratory findings in patients with COVID-19 were respectively,

251

increased C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (72% CI 54.3-84.6), lymphopenia (50.1%, CI 38.0-62.4), high

252

levels of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) (41%,CI 22.8-62.0), increased serum aspartate

253

aminotransferase (19.7%, CI 10.5-33.7) and thrombocytopenia (11.1%, CI 7.7-15.7) (Table 4).

254

Among the confirmed COVID19 subjects, 14.0% (CI, 6.7-29.0) had viremia. Impaired hepatic

255

function with ALT levels greater than 47.25 U/L was seen in 13.3% (CI 3.2-41.0) of COVID19

256

subjects. Acute cardiac injury with troponin levels greater than 28 pg/ml was seen in 12.4% of

257

the patients. Acute kidney injury was found in 5.5% (CI 1.3-20.8). Shock was reported in 4.0% (CI

258

1.6-12.0) shock. 13.0% (CI 4.8-30.0) met the definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome

259

(ARDS).

260

Radiologic findings

261

Chest X-Ray (CXR) and chest CT-scan were the common imaging modalities used for the

262

diagnosis of COVID19. The pooled sensitivity for CT-scan for COVID19 was 79.3%. The most

263

common sites of the lung involvement based on chest CT-scan were right lower lobe (76.2, CI

264

57.8-82.5) followed by left lower lobe (71.8%, CI 57.8-82.5). Most of the patients (74.8%) had

265

bilateral involvement. The most common pattern of parenchymal involvement was ground-glass

266

opacity (66.0%, CI 51.1-78.0). The chest CT-scan was reported normal in 20.7% of the patients

267

with confirmed RT-PCR results (Table 5).

268

Outcomes

269

Hospitalization was required in 94.6% of patients with severe COVID-19. The pooled mortality

270

rate of these patients was about 6.6% (CI 2.8-15.0) (Table 6, 7). Old age, male sex, presence of

271

underlying diseases, higher level of D-dimer, lower level of fibrinogen and anti-thrombin,

272

progressive radiographic deterioration in follow up CT-scans, developed ARDS and requirement

273

of mechanical ventilation were reported factors associated with increased mortality rate. As shown

274

in Table 8, men had significantly higher mortality in the hospital compared to women (OR 3.4;

275

95% CI 1.2-9.1, P = 0.01). Although ICU admission was higher in men, the difference was not

276

significant. The mean duration between the time of hospitalization and death was 17.5 days with

minimum and maximum periods of 14 and 21 days respectively. The effects and summaries

278

calculated using a random-effects model weighted by the study population is shown in Figure 2.

Discussion

282

We evaluated the signs and symptoms, diagnostic modalities, therapeutic measures and

283

epidemiologic features of COVID-19 to have a better understanding of this pandemic caused by

284

SARS-CoV-2. In terms of clinical manifestations, the most common signs and symptoms were

285

fever and cough. Hypertension and cardiovascular diseases were the most common

286

comorbidities among patients. Between the different abnormal laboratory findings, increased

287

levels of CRP and lymphopenia were the most common findings. Chest X-Ray and chest CT-scan

288

were the most common imaging modalities used for the diagnosis. The pooled sensitivity of CT-

289

san for COVID19 was 79.3%. We found 20.7% of the patients with confirmed RT-PCR who had

290

normal chest CT-Scan suggesting that a normal chest CT-scan cannot rule out the disease in

291

patients who are highly suspicious for COVID-19. Several complications were seen due to

292

COVID-19. Among these, acute hepatitis was the most common one occurring in 13.3% of cases,

293

followed by cardiac injury with troponin levels greater than 28 pg/ml seen in 12.4%. The pooled

294

mortality rate of these patients was 6.6%. We detected several factors contributing to a worse

295

outcome including old age, male sex, presence of underlying diseases and some abnormal

296

laboratory finding such as high level of D-Dimer. Although there was not any significant difference

297

between male and female gender in ICU admissions, male gender showed a significantly higher

298

in-hospital mortality rate.

299
300

The current study showed that fever (83.0%), cough (65.2%) and dyspnea (27.4%) were the most

301

common signs and symptoms. In a study done by Zhang et al in Wuhan, fever was identified as

302

the most common clinical finding present in 91.7% of the patients followed by cough in 75% of

303

patients. Their study showed a higher gastrointestinal (GI) manifestation at presentation of the

304

disease, representing 39.6% of the patients (10). Our study showed a lower prevalence of GI

305

symptoms including diarrhea, which was present in 5.7% of patients and nausea/vomiting in 5%.

306
307

The most prevalent comorbidities in our study were hypertension (18.5 %, CI 12.7-24.4) followed

308

by cardiovascular diseases (14.9 %, CI 6.0-23.8) and diabetes (10.8 %, CI 8.3-13.3). According

309

to a systematic review for comorbidities by Yang et al, hypertension (17 ± 7%, CI 14-22%) and

310

diabetes (8 ± 6%, CI 6-11%), followed by cardiovascular diseases (5 ± 4%, CI 4-7%) were the

311

most common comorbid findings (11). The high prevalence of hypertension and other

312

cardiovascular comorbidities have raised speculation regarding the role of angiotensin-converting

313

enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI) in COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor has

314

been identified as the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells and previous studies

315

have shown that the usage of ACEI results in the upregulation of ACE2 (12) (13). Theoretically,

316

this increase in ACE2 levels could result in a greater risk of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

317

Current evidence against the use of ACEI in patients with COVID-19 or those at risk of the disease

318

is limited, and further studies are needed to analyze this possible association.

319
320

The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (72%),

321

lymphopenia (50.1%) and elevated LDH (41%). Also, thrombocytopenia was seen in 11.1% of

322

the subjects. Analyses by Huang et al and Lippi et al have suggested that lymphopenia and

323

thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 patients are associated with poorer outcomes, respectively (14,

324

15). Interestingly, patients with SARS were reported to have a higher percentage of lymphopenia

325

(68-90%) and thrombocytopenia (20-45%) compared to COVID-19 patients (16). A similar

326

reduction in counts was also observed in patients with H1N1 influenza (17). Thrombocytopenia

327

and lymphopenia have been previously shown to strongly indicate a higher risk of mortality in

328

SARS and influenza (17, 18). Given the current lack of predictive biomarkers in COVID-19,

329

lymphocyte and platelet count may be used as indicators of severe disease in the clinical setting.

330
331

Liver abnormality was the most common complication and was present among 13.3% of the

332

subjects, although the data was reported only in 3 studies. However, a significant number of

333

subjects had elevated AST (19.7%) and ALT (14.6%). Impaired liver function has been observed

334

as collateral damage in some viral infections including SARS, possibly caused by direct damage

335

to the hepatic tissue by the pathogen (19). While this could be the case with COVID19, an

336

iatrogenic effect due to medications like lopinavir cannot be ruled out.

338

Another significant finding in our analysis was the incidence of cardiac injury in 12.4% of the

339

patients, which is a common event seen in a multitude of viral illnesses(20). Gao et al observed

340

that subjects with influenza (H7N9) and cardiac injury had an elevated risk of mortality (HR=2.06)

341

(21). In a study by Ludwig et al for analysis of cardiac biomarkers in influenza patients, 24% of

342

the subjects showed ACI in ≤30 days after influenza diagnosis and half of them were myocardial

343

infarction (22). Although our analysis did not show increased mortality risk in patients with cardiac

344

injury, these findings could indicate the potential need for identifying and optimizing cardiac risk

345

factors in COVID-19 patients during the treatment period.

346
347

The mean duration between hospitalization and death was 17.5 days (range- 14-21 days),

348

compared to 17.4 days in SARS (23). The overall mortality rate in this study was 6.6%, which is

349

more than twice than previously reported (24). Though comparable mortality was reported by Li

350

et al (7%) and Qian et al (8.9%) in their meta-analyses, a study by Rodriguez et al showed a much

351

higher death rate of 13.9% (25-27). On the other hand, a study from the Jiangsu province of China

352

results showed a high cure rate equal to 96.67%. Although the main reason for very low mortality

353

on this study remains unknown, measures including early recognition and centered-quarantine

354

may be contributing factors(28).

355
356

Of note, the in-hospital mortality of males was significantly higher than females (OR 3.4; 95% CI

357

1.2-9.1, P = 0.01). A similar pattern of higher mortality in males has been reported in previous

358

coronavirus outbreaks of SARS and MERS. Karlberg et al also reported that the gender-based
19

359

difference in mortality was higher in younger males (0-44 years) (RR=2), compared to those of

360

age group 45-74 (RR-1.45) (6). Similarly, the study by Alghamdi et al showed that the case fatality

361

rate in males was twice that of females in MERS (52% VS 23%) (29). Although a gender-based

362

difference in the immune response to infections has been suggested as a possible factor, other

363

contributing factors including smoking history and severity of underlying comorbidities cannot be

364

ruled out (30). This is especially of significance in China, where the prevalence of smoking among

365

men (57.6%) is almost 10 times higher than in women (6.7%) (31). This difference in mortality

366

opens the discussion for the need to treat COVID19 more aggressively in males, including the

367

possibility of earlier intubation and mechanical ventilation in this population. Further investigations

368

are also needed to understand this phenomenon.

369
370

This study has several limitations. Due to the rapidly emerging COVID-19 situation around the

371

globe and the novelty of this coronavirus, there is still limited clinical data regarding diagnostic

372

modalities and effective therapeutic measures. Most of the clinical findings were from

373

observational studies. Future clinical trials and animal models are also required to have

374

conclusive clinical information. We also need more studies outside of China for a comprehensive

375

result that reflects COVID-19 globally. In the end, due to the lack of accurate reports of the new

376

cases in different countries, the epidemiologic measures are also limited. As this pandemic is

377

growing fast, future studies are needed for the evaluation of epidemiologic and clinical features

378

of COVID-19.

Conclusion:

381

COVID-19 presents with a significant number of mortalities especially among males around the

382

world. The pooled mortality rate in our study was 6.6%. The high rate of hospitalization and case

383

fatality among hospitalized patients along with the lack of intensive care facilities necessitated the

384

identification of factors associated with the severe disease and mortality. These factors included

385

male gender, age, underlying diseases, higher level of D-Dimer, lower level of fibrinogen and anti-

386

thrombin, progressive radiographic deterioration on follow up, developed ARDS and requirement

387

of mechanical ventilation. It was inferred that higher comorbidities such as hypertension and

388

cardiovascular diseases could be related to the pathogenesis of the virus through ACE II receptor.

389

This association could open doors for future studies to evaluate the role of ACE inhibitor drugs in

390

the high-risk group. There are still a lot of unknown features of COVID-19 for the broad scientific

391

community to investigate in an effort to slow the progression and mortality of COVID-19 and finally

392

defeat this pandemic.
