Abstract
The distinct ways the COVID-19 pandemics has been unfolding in different countries
and regions suggest that local societal and governmental structures play an important
role not only for the the baseline infection rate, but also for the short-term and
long-term reaction to the outbreak. We propose to investigate the question of how
societies as a whole, and governments in particular, modulate the dynamics of a novel
epidemic using a generalization of the SIR model, the controlled SIR model. We posit
that containment measures are equivalent to a feedback between the status of the
outbreak and the reproduction factor. Short-term control of an outbreak, corresponds
in this framework to the reaction of governments and individuals to daily cases and
fatalities. The reaction to the cumulative number of cases or deaths, and not to daily
numbers, is captured in contrast by long-term control. We present the exact phase
space solution of the controlled SIR model and use it to quantify containment policies
for a large number of countries in terms of short- and long-term control parameters. We
find increased contributions of long-term control for countries and regions in which the
outbreak was suppressed substantially together with a strong correlation between the
strength of societal and governmental policies and the time needed to contain
COVID-19 outbreaks. Furthermore, for numerous countries and regions we identified a
predictive relation between the number of fatalities within a fixed period before and
after the peak daily fatality count which predicts the cumulative medical load of
COVID-19 outbreaks that should be expected after the peak. These results suggest
applicability of the proposed model not only for understanding the outbreak dynamics,
but also for predicting future cases and fatalities once the effectiveness of outbreak
suppression policies is established with sufficient certainty.

Author summary
The country specific dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemics has been suggests that local
societal response and governmental structures are critical both for the baseline infection
rate and the short-term and long-term reaction to the outbreak. Here we investigate
how societies as a whole, and governments, in particular, modulate the dynamics of a
novel epidemic using the controlled SIR model, a generalisation of a standard
compartmental model used for modelling the dynamics of infectious diseases. We posit
that containment measures correspond to feedback between the status of the outbreak
(the daily or the cumulative number of cases and fatalities) and the reproduction factor.

We present the exact phase space solution of the controlled SIR model and use it to
quantify containment policies for a large number of countries in terms of model
parameters corresponding to long- and short-term control. Furthermore, we identified
for numerous countries a relationship between the number of fatalities within a fixed
period before and after the peak in daily fatalities. As the number of fatalities
corresponds to the number of hospitalised patients, the relationship can be used to
predict the cumulative medical load, once the effectiveness of outbreak suppression
policies is established with sufficient certainty.

Introduction

1

Epidemic outbreaks differ widely with respect to the parameters defining their
dynamics and societal impact, such as infection rate, fatality rate, and the rate of
critical cases requiring hospitalization. In order to gauge the effectiveness and
suitability of policies enacted for outbreak containment one needs therefore to discern
the outbreak parameters. However, in novel outbreak the precise assessment of any of
these quantities and a prediction of disease spreading is in practice a notoriously
difficult task [1]. Outbreak case data at early stages is often both noisy and biased [2],
which implies that core epidemiological parameters cannot be estimated with sufficient
precision. This is a hard limitation of any epidemics-forecasting approach, as small
differences in disease dynamical properties can lead to drastically different outcomes [3].
However, in spite of these limitations, it is safe to assume that both individuals and
governments will react to a spread of a new infectious disease. Given the severity of the
COVID-19 outbreak [4], it is unsurprising that the raising case and fatality numbers not
only forced governments to impose lock-down measures [5, 6], but also motivated people
to avoid travelling and mass gatherings [7]. Hence, to understand the dynamics of
COVID-19 outbreak, we propose to model the feedback of spontaneous societal and
imposed governmental restrictions using a standard epidemic model that is modified in
one key point: the reproduction rate of the virus is not constant, but evolves over time
alongside with the disease in a way that leads to a ‘flattening of the curve’ [8]. The
basis of the proposed model is the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model, which
describes the evolution of a contagious disease for which immunity persists substantially
longer than the outbreak itself [9]. We extend the model by introducing a negative
feedback loop between the severity of the outbreak and the initial reproduction rate g0 .
Our model contains two parameters, αX and αI , which control respectively the amount
of long- and short-term epidemic control. The first, αX , quantifies the contribution of
the cumulative case count X to the negative feedback loop. For the second parameter,
αI , short-term control, the growth rate is reduced when the current number of active
cases, I, is large. The resulting process is denoted the controlled SIR model.
The controlled SIR model draws its motivation from previous epidemiology
modelling. One of the first evidences showing that human behaviour affects spreading
dynamics [10, 11], came from the study of measles epidemics [12]. Generalizations of the
SIR model account for various effects of societal response to an outbreak, such as
self-isolation [13], contact-frequency reduction and quarantine [14], changes in human
mobility [15], together with the effects of geographic and societal networks [16], and of
explicit feedback loops [17]. For a detailed analysis, epidemiology models can be
extended to cover a range of additional aspects [18], with an example being the
distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases [19]. These kind of complex
models are in general not accessible to an explicit analytic handling. It has also been
questioned, whether detailed modelling leads to improved predictions [1, 2], given that
field data is inherently noisy.
The controlled SIR model was recently introduced in [20], where the authors

analysed long- or short-term control separately, but not arbitrary mixtures. In contrast,
we derive here an analytic solution for the controlled SIR model in the presence of both
long-term and short-term control. Additionally, we show that the descriptions of
COVID-19 field data is substantially improved when both short-term and long-term
control are included. For data analysis and model validation, we use publicly available
COVID-19 case and fatality counts for a wide range of countries and regions.
We find that the cumulative number of fatalities within a given period of a few
weeks before the peak number of daily fatalities increases by 30% for the same period
after the peak. Strikingly, this result is found to hold universally across all considered
countries and regions. In contrast to the universality with regard to the increase in
fatalities, substantial differences in the country-specific intrinsic reproduction factor and
short and long-term control parameters are found. A comprehensive theoretical
description based on an analytic solution of the controlled SIR model is given, together
with a detailed validation (based on simulated data) of the statistical inference used for
estimation of the country specific parameters. We also evaluate search-engine based
measures quantifying the effectiveness of lock-down measures and the impact of
structural factors (e.g. population density) on the infection rate and doubling time.
Finally, we conclude that the controlled SIR model allows precise quantification of the
outbreak dynamics, and provides a predictive framework for assessing the effectiveness
of containment measures and future medical load.

which takes the number of susceptible S = S(t), infected I = I(t) and recovered
(removed) individuals R = R(t), as constituents variables [21]. The sum, S + I + R = N ,
is assumed to be constant at all times t, as the population size N is approximately
unchanged over the course of the the outbreak. In its basic formulation, the SIR model
is characterized by a timescale, τ , and a dimensionless reproduction factor, g.
Note that the Eq. (1) describes an uncontrolled isolated outbreak in an environment
that does not react to the disease. In reality, counter measures will be taken either
spontaneously by the general public, or will be imposed by governmental institutions.
As a result the reproduction factor will fall below its intrinsic value, which we denote
with g0 . We posit that reactions to the unfolding of the epidemic are based either on
the current situation (the current active cases, I) or on the overall history of the

In the following we will use the symbol X to denote cumulative case counts, both for
field data and for theory results. The number of new cases, which are typically reported
in official COVID-19 datasets on a daily basis, we will denote with ∆X. We will add a
time tag subscript d to denote reported
counts on a specific day. In that case, the

following sum rule holds: Xd = d00 ≤d ∆Xd00 . In analogy, we denote with F and ∆F
cumulative and daily fatalities, respectively. Importantly, the model presented here is
explicitly defined for one isolated epidemic outbreak. Our analysis focuses thus
exclusively on the initial outbreak, as defined in more details in Data smoothing / peak
definition.

which reflects the intuition that containment becomes progressively harder.
The controlled SIR model, Eq. (1) together with Eq. (2), can be solved exactly (see

αX = αI = 0, however with distinct shapes of the phase space trajectories. The
phase-space (XI) representation tends to be stretched for short-term control and
parabola-like for long-term control [20].

As an example of the COVID-19 data examined we present in Fig. 2 the timeline of the
outbreak for the US state. Also shown is a comparison of several publicly available data
sources (see Sect. Data sources for details). For most daily values the John Hopkins and
ECDC data agree, as illustrated in Fig. 2b for the case of Spain, Turkey and Germany.
For the latter, the case counts published by the Robert Koch Institute have been added.
Spain is a special case, as the official counting criteria did see a major revision end of
May 2020 [23].

the time it take for the outbreak to build up and to recede. A second, prominent peak is
present. Right: For the XI-representation daily counts are plotted as a function of total

later-stage COVID-19 data for Spain, which is due to changes of official counting
protocols. For the data sources see Sect. Data sources.
A key focus of the present study concerns the evolution of fatality counts. For the
analysis we concentrated on countries with cumulative death toll of at least 1000, a
number which we found to allow for a robust analysis.

In practice, not all active cases (infected individuals) are detected and reported, with
the consequence that the official numbers of daily cases, and likewise the total number,
is subject to under-counting. Furthermore, even when an infected individual is
identified, the report is normally delayed from the moment of the infection to the
occurrence of symptoms, and subsequent positive testing, a process taking up to several
weeks [24, 25]. Individuals identified as infected are most of the time isolated
(quarantined) and the possibility that they further spread the disease is minimal. Hence,
from the perspective of the outbreak dynamics, daily cases counts are an indicator for
the number of individual changing from the group of infectious to the removed
individuals R, which are the ones unable to spread the disease.
Miscounting is present also for official fatality counts, but to a reduced extent [26].
It is possible to estimate the extent to which the history of fatalities and infections trace
each other in phase space, by comparing the functional dependence of (X, ∆X) and
(F, ∆F ):

Fig 3. COVID-19 cases vs. fatalities. Daily new cases ∆X as a function of the
total case count, X (blue) and the rescaled daily fatalities, ∆F → fF ∆F , as a function
of the rescaled total death count, F → fF F (orange). The rescaling factors fF , given in
brackets (first number), have been determined by aligning the initial slopes ∆F/F and
∆X/X. The accuracy of the rescaling, SF , measured as the relative area difference
(shaded area over total area, see Eq. (6)), is given in the brackets (second number).
Shown are countries and regions with the highest cumulative fatality counts, out of the
ones considered here, as listed in Table 1. The data has been terminated once ∆X has
fallen by 70%, which we use to define the first outbreak.
A rational for this procedure is presented within Approximate integration.
In Fig. 3 we show the relationship between daily cases and daily fatalities for the
countries and US states with the highest death tolls. For some countries, like Italy, the
rescaling procedure (5) works surprisingly well. The accuracy can be gauged by

which corresponds to the percentage-wise miscounting of the daily cases ∆Xd with
respect to rescaled daily fatalities
P fF ∆Fd . Note that SF → 1 when the rescaling factor
fF is set to zero, since Xtot = d ∆Xd and |∆Xd | = ∆Xd .
In Table 1 the scaling accuracies in terms of SF are listed for all countries and US
state examined. Values of the order 10%-20% are typical. The quality of the matching
suggest that the respective under-counting factors are stable, and not changing
substantially over time. The results presented in Fig. 3 indicate also that other factors,
like the success of medical treatments, seem to have changed comparatively little over
the observation period, here d < d0 , where the d0 is the cut-off date for the first peak
defined in Data smoothing / peak definition.
The rescaling factors fF reported in Table 1 have been determined separately for
each country and US state by aligning the initial slopes ∆X/X and ∆F/F . The
rational is that the initial phase of an outbreak corresponds to the exponential-growth

reason is that both case and death counts increase in the exponential phase with the

The rescaling factor defined here, f˜F , is in general different from the one used in Eq. (5).
In Fig. 4 a direct comparison of the exact phase-space trajectories (X, I) obtained for
the controlled SIR model with reported death counts is presented. To this extent the
development of ∆F vs. F in phase space has been fitted using the exact solution Eq. (3)
and an appropriated rescaling factor f˜F in Eq. (7). Note that we have estimated the
free model parameters only from the data associated to the initial outbreak, for dates

The data presented in Fig. 3 indicates, as discussed above, that death and case counts
of reported COVID-19 data rescale approximately. It is hence of interest to examine to
which extent one can extract the characteristics of an outbreak directly from the fatality
counts, which tend to be more reliable. For this purpose one could add a variable F to
the SIR model and evaluate fatalities directly from first principles. Here we use the fact
that I and F are necessarily related (only infected can die), modulo a time lag, which
becomes however irrelevant in the XI phase-space representation. For this purpose, we
use the following mapping between reported daily and total fatalities and the variables
X = 1 − S and I of the SIR model, Eq. (1):

long and short-term control, parametrized respectively by αX and αI . An overview of
the extracted parameters is presented in Table 1. It is important to recall that the
growth factor g0 of the effective SIR model used for the description of the fatality
dynamics in terms of an (X, I) representation does not correspond to the medical
growth factor R0 . Instead, the comparison presented in Fig. 4 shows that it is possible
to model the evolution of official fatality statistics directly in terms of an effective SIR
model.

for a relative gauge, L/(L + S), that quantifies the fraction of control due to long-term
control. Here L stays for ’long’ and S for ’short’. The extracted values of L/(L + S) are
given in Table 1. For the countries shown in Fig. 4 one observes, characteristically, that
the epidemics decreases fast for countries with large fractions of long-term control, and
slower when short-term control dominates. Long-term control is therefore substantially
more efficient in containing an epidemic outbreak.

The use of an effective SIR model to describe fatality statistics, as in Fig. 4, allows to
extract containment policies, the key rational for this procedure. In absolute terms, the
contributions αX X and αI I to the reduction of g vary strongly as function of time. We
use therefore the respective values at the peak of daily fatalities, which correspond via
(7) to the peak fraction Xpeak of total cases, as given by (4), and to the corresponding
fraction of active cases, Ipeak .
Hence, we use the following relation

Universal fatality increase after the peak

187

People dying of a COVID-19 infection have been typically on intensive care beforehand,
which implies that the medical load is roughly proportional to the number of fatalities
incurring on a daily basis. Of interest is, in this regard, whether the average medical
load decreases or increase after the peak of the outbreak has been reached, in particular
when averaged over a timescale Tτ of several weeks.
We denote with Fbefore , and respectively with Fafter , the number of deaths occurring
in the Tτ days before/after daily fatalities peaked, ∆Fpeak = I(Xpeak )/f˜F , as
determined by Eqs. (3) and (7). The reference period Tτ is determined in our analysis
by measuring the number of days that passed between fτ ∆Fpeak and ∆Fpeak , that is
between a small initial daily fatality count, fτ ∆Fpeak , and the peak medical load
∆Fpeak . See Fig. 5 for an illustration. We took fτ = 0.1 when possible, namely when
the data for the same number of days after the peak was available and within the
observation period. Otherwise the time span from ∆Fpeak to the end of the reported
timeline (or d0 ) was taken.

Fig 5. Fatalities before and after the peak – data. The observed numbers of
fatalities Fbefore and Fafter incurring over a time span Tτ before/after the peak of the
outbreak. Left: Procedure illustration. See the Methods Section for the determination
of Tτ . Right: All observed ratios Fafter /Fbefore are close to 1.3. The linear fit
corresponds to a linear regression with fixed intercept (R2 = 0.994). Per time, on
average 30% more death incur after the peak.
For all countries and US states examined, Fafter is plotted as a function of Fbefore in
Fig. 5. One finds a near to perfect linear relationship
Fafter ≈ 1.3 Fbefore ,

203

(9)

which is quite remarkable. For the linear regression with fixed intercept we find
R2 = 0.994. It implies, that the average medical load is predictably 30% higher after
the peak, than before. Given that there is a time delay between the onset of an
infection and the eventual fatality, a certain increase was to be expected. The finding
that this holds for a wide range of countries and regions, is however highly non-trivial.
This result facilitates in our view the planning for COVID-19 specific hospital capacities.
The stable relationship between medical load before and after the peak fatalities is in
particular surprising in the view that the functional developments of COVID-19
outbreaks varies considerably, as illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4.
In Fig. 6 we present the ratio Xafter /Xbefore of the cumulative numbers of cases
occurring in the controlled SIR model during the above defined period Tτ before and
after the peak. The theoretical estimates have been obtained keeping g0 = 1.25 fixed

simulation of the controlled SIR model for the ratio of average fatalities after and before
the infection peak. Compare Fig. 5. A large number of simulations over a range of αX

the percentagewise contribution L/(L + S) of long-term control. For most countries
Ipeak /N is typically of the order of 10−4 or smaller.
(see 1), scanning a wide range of αX and αI . Note that the field data, which is also
given, scatters somewhat around the 1.3 ratio, an effect which is not as evident when
using alternative representations, as in Fig. 5.
Given that case and fatality counts are related (re-scalable) for many countries, as
illustrated in Fig. 3, the results presented in Fig. 6 can be understood as a first step
towards an understanding why the ratio Fafter /Fbefore is of the order of 1.3 for the field
data, as shown Fig. 5. In fact one observes in Fig. 6 that two conditions are necessary
for Xafter /Xbefore to be of the order of 1.3, or slightly larger. Firstly, the per-population
peak fraction of infected, Ipeak /N needs to be small, of the order of 10−4 or smaller,
which is typically the case for field data. Secondly, control is dominated by short-term
control, with long-term control contributing only in a minor way. This condition also
holds, albeit only to a certain extent, given that L/(L + S) is generically smaller than
0.5; see Table 1 for details.
The data presented in Fig. 6 indicates that the size of the relative infection count
and the type of containment policy enacted influence relative medical loads. Further
research is however necessary to clarify why Fafter /Fbefore ≈ 1.3 holds to the observed
precision.

Google compiled changes in search-engine queries that are indicative of increasing social
distancing, with an example being a reduction of inquiries concerned with traveling to
the workplace. Using an average of several indicators, we compiled the Google social
distancing index (GSDI); see Google social distancing index (GSDI) for details.
Numerically the index is gauged with respected to its pre-Corona value.
In Fig. 7 we show the correlation between the GSDI and the ratio ∆F/F between
reported daily fatalities ∆F and total fatalities F . As examples we selected France,
Spain, Italy, New York and New Jersey. In orders of magnitude the Google social
distancing index dropped by about 80% for the European countries shown, and by about
60% for the US states. In Fig. 7f the GSDI is shown as a function of per capita fatality
rates. The general trend is that the GSDI acquires somewhat lower values for European
countries, with respect to US states, together with a comparative pronounced recovery.
There is a certain spread in the total fatalities F needed for social distancing to be

Data smoothing / peak definition

The real-world epidemics reports are intrinsically noisy, with common sources of noise
being report delays and under- or over-counting [30]. All data sources used show strong
fluctuations with a seven day period. Accordingly, we utilize a seven-day centred
moving average for data preprocessing.
Due to a multitude of errata in the data sets, it is also necessary to filter out
impossible measurements, such as negative daily new cases or fatalities. As a remedy we
dropped dates with negative daily fatalities ∆Fd < 0. In these isolated cases the 7-day
centered moving average is evaluated over the remaining seven data points, spanning
eight actual days.
Endemic phases and second waves follow in most countries the initial Covid-19
outbreak, with the reason being that policies are generically relaxed when the first wave
has been contained to a certain extent. The here developed framework, the controlled
SIR model, is based in contrast on the assumption that containment policies, in terms
of αX and αI , are constant, with the consequence that the controlled SIR model
describes a single contained outbreak, and not a series of waves. However, only a well
defined peak is needed for a reliable analysis, and not that the epidemic is fully
eradicated. Our framework is therefore well suited to analyze the first wave of a
Covid-19 epidemic, during which the containment feedback parameters αX and αI can
be assumed to not change substantially.
To be specific, we define a cut-off date d0 as the day on which the number of daily
new fatalities has fallen by 70% compared to the first peak: ∆Fd0 = 0.3∆Fpeak . Here
∆Fpeak denotes the maximum number of daily new fatalities in the 7-day centered
moving average. This criterion is used to isolate the first outbreak, d < d0 , from the
subsequent course of the epidemic. The dates d0 used are listed in Table 1.

Equivalently, daily fatalities are equal to the change in the total number of fatalities
∆Fd = Fd+∆t − Fd . We will consider the reports of daily fatalities more accurate in
general than daily cases (or daily recovered) as under or over counting is less severe. In
what follows we will demonstrate how one can relate daily cases and daily fatalities to
the infection rate g(t), and to the XI representation.

Following the approximate integration steps presented in [32], we assume that the
quantities of interest, X(t), I(t), and g(t) are piecewise constant within [d, d + ∆t).
Hence, after setting the integration interval to one day, ∆t = 1, we get the following set
of difference equations

Individuals are removed, ∆Rd , when recovering, or when dying, which implies
∆Fd = cF ∆Rd , or when quarantined, ∆Qd = cQ ∆Rd . We denote here with Qd the
number invididuals that are infected, but unable to infect other, either because they are
quarantined at home, or because they are hospitalized. In general cF + cQ < 1 and
cQ > cF . Using Eq. (24) we obtain two approximate relations for the evolution of daily
quarantined and deaths,

∆Qd ≈ (cQ /τ )Id

(25)

In practice, people tested positive will be advised to quarantine, or hospitalized. In view
that the officially reported new cases, ∆Xd , correspond to the number of positive
Covid-19 tests outcomes, one has, with Eq. (25), that ∆Xd ∼ ∆Qd ∼ Id ∼ ∆Fd , and
hence that ∆Xd scales approximately with ∆Fd . We believe that this reasoning explains
the observed approximate scaling between case- and death counts, as shown in Fig. 3.
As a further test of the procedure outlined above we compare in Fig. 8 the solution
of the controlled SIR model with simulated data. Here we obtained g = g(t) by
numerical integrating Eq. (1), using a 7/6 Runge-Kutta integration [33], with the
phase-space representation matching the analytic expression, Eq. (3). Using Eq. (25)
the timeline of infected, I(t), was used to generate simulated
P data for daily fatalities,
∆Fd , which in turn yields the cumulative death count Fd = d00 ≤d ∆Fd00 . As a last step
we rescaled via Eq. (7), (X, I)=
ˆ f˜F (F, ∆F ), comparing the such obtained simulated
data, (X, I), with the direct solution of the controlled SIR model. The agreement
between the direct solution and simulated data is remarkably good.

Parameter estimation

342

To fit the parameters of the controlled SIR model to the publicly available outbreak
datasets, we have used the theoretical phase relation Eq. (3). The best fitting parameter
values are obtained by direct minimization of the following loss function

2
U=
wd fF ∆Fd − I (fF Fd ) ,
(26)

d

where the weights wd = Fd − Fd−1 = ∆Fd ensure that long stretches of days with low
fatality numbers, which are common at the beginning and the end of an epidemic, do no
dominate. An optimization that weighs every data point equally, i.e. least squares,
overestimates the early and in the case of one isolated outbreak the late stages of the
epidemic outbreak. The rescaling factors fF used are the ones presented in Table 1.
The minimization of Eq. (26) in respect to the parameter set {αX , αI , g0 } has been
performed using Newton‘s method for optimization implemented in Julia by [34]. To
prevent division by zero the denominators of Eq. (3) have been shifted by εi = 0.01i in
the complex plane before taking the real part.

The theoretical values of the ratio of average cases after and before the infection peak
presented in Fig. 6 were calculated simulating the controlled SIR model Eq. (1). The
numerical integration was performed using the SciMl implementation of Jim Verner’s
“most efficient” 7/6 Runge-Kutta method [33]. Unless stated otherwise, the simulations
were run for τ = 1.1 and g0 = 1.2. The population has been initialized with
I(t = 0) = 10−10 N . For every αX and αI we calculated the peak medical load Ipeak
using Eq. (4) and Eq. (3). The percentage-wise contribution L/(L + S) of long-term
control Eq. (8) are evaluated at the point of peak infection rates.
Note that it is not possible to simulate different trajectories for which both
L/(L + S) and Ipeak /N are fixed. For the comparison presented in Fig. 6 simulations

Discussion

367

368

By mid 2020, the world-wide Covid-19 pandemic has entered a second phase. In most
countries and regions the initial exponential growth phase has been contained to an
extent that official case counts dropped substantially after the first peak. For the
majority of countries and regions it is therefore possible to define an endpoint d0 of the
first wave. Here we used a simple criterion, namely a 70% drop in case numbers.
Subsequent to the first wave, the development of the Corona epidemic is showing a large
variety of functional dependencies.
For a large number of Covid-19 outbreaks we analyzed the first wave in terms of an
effective SIR model, the controlled SIR model. The basic assumption is that
containment policies can be parametrized by two parameters, αX and αI , which
describe how much emphasis is placed respectively on long- and short-term control.
This does not imply that containment in terms of a reduction of the basic reproduction
factor is constant, but that the dependence of the reproduction factor on total and daily
case counts is given by a functionally constant feedback loop. For a wide range of
countries and US states we find that the official case and death counts are described
well by the controlled SIR model. This observation allows to extract country-specific
containment parameters, αX and αI . Containment success is found to go hand in hand
with an emphasis on long-term control, with short-term control being more likely to be
followed by an endemic state.
Two types of time-lines can be used to analyse Covid-19 outbreaks, one based on
daily cases and another on daily fatalities. In this study we examined in particular the
death toll, showing that daily and cumulative fatalities provide reliable data sources.
This framework is based on the assumption that the success of medical therapies does
not change substantially over the course of the observation period, here the first wave.
Given the accuracy of the modelling, this assumption sees a posteriori justification,
which is strengthened furthermore by the observation that case and fatality counts scale
in phase-space representation, as shown in Fig. 3.
A particular interesting result of our analysis concerns the predictability of the
medical load. As a measure we compare the cumulative number of fatalities over two
periods of identical length, typically several weeks, just before and just after the peak of
the first wave. In this regard, we find that the medical load increases on the average by
33% after the peak. This is quite a remarkable observation, in our view, given that the
Covid-19 outbreaks vary substantially in between countries.
