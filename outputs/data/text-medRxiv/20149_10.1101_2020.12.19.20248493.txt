mitigation factor for airborne transmission) is expected to sensibly decrease due to outdoor temperatures getting
colder and regulators going to allow less restrictive policies on windows closure. Fundamental questions to be
addressed are therefore: to which extent can we contain airborne transmission risk in schools? what would be the
optimal ventilation strategy during the cold season considering the fact that most schools are not provided with
mechanical ventilation systems? To try answering these questions a risk model for airborne transmission of covid19 in classrooms has been develped based on previous models for tubercolosis and influenza. The separate cases
of infective student and infective teacher, as well as infective teacher with microphone are investigated. We
explored 3500 different air ventilation cycles for different lesson+break times and carried out a numerical
optimization of the risk function. Safety risk-zones for breaks and lessons durations were estimated combining the
effect of surgical masks and optimal windows opening cycles.

1. Introduction

According to past and recent literature (e.g., Leung [2020], Morawska [2020-2], and
Escombe [2007]), long distance oral transmission of infective diseases like Tuberculosis
and Influenza in confined environments could be significantly reduced by proper
ventilation. Although most of the relevant past literature has focused on the spread of
tuberculosis or influenza in hospitals, the general principle of airborne transmission is valid
and pertinent also for SARS-CoV2 in the context of school classrooms since these are
enclosed settings which may host asymptomatic sources. As for mitigation strategies,
indirect oral transmission of SARS-CoV2 is believed to be effectively curbed through the
frequent opening of windows or by mechanical HVAC systems [Morawska 2020-2]. Very
recent (although still unpublished) measurements of SARS-CoV2 air concentrations in
ventilated and non-ventilated hospital rooms performed by the Italian Regional
Environmental Agency “ARPA Piemonte”, confirm this statement [Repubblica 2021].
Compared to natural ventilation, mechanical ventilation systems, when adequately
configured, can be equally or even more effective [Morawska 2020-2, ASHRAE 2020].
However, unlike hospitals, the vast majority of schools worldwide are not equipped with
such systems and will not be, at least for the foreseeable future (including the 2020/2021
school year). In the real context of school classrooms, groups of students, which can
potentially include tens of individuals, share the same premises for hours with potentially
insufficient ventilation. This greatly increases the likelihood of coming into contact with
virus-loaded aerosol droplets generated by even only one infective student or teacher in
the same classroom. This issue is of concern also when social distancing is correctly
implemented because of the volumetric nature of aerosol clouds. On the other hand, as
suggested also by intuition, frequent natural ventilation could help dilute the viral load by
allowing fresh air from the outside to enter classrooms. The extent to which natural
ventilation combined with face masks, may reduce the airborne contagion risk in case of an
infective student source, has been the subject of a preliminary numerical investigation
published by one of the authors in October 2020 [Zivelonghi 2020]. In the present work
we are extending such predictions presenting the infective teacher case while improving
the general GN-model with the effective volume of dilution. Furthermore, we show a
comprehensive mitigation strategy which include the novelties of numerical optimization of
ventilation cycles and predictions for the reduction of group contagion risk through a voice
amplification system at reasonable cost. The duration of lesson intervals (breaks) is one of
the most critical parameters during winter, since only during breaks one can imagine to
fully open the windows and dilute the viral load. Otherwise, complete windows opening
during lesson time will drop the ambient temperature considerably and increase the risks of
other diseases. This motivates a theoretical/computational framework aiming to optimize
air change cycles in classrooms. In the present work, we explored 3500 different air
ventilation cycles for different lesson+break times and carried out a numerical optimization
of the risk function. Safety risk-zones for breaks and lessons durations were estimated
combining the effect of surgical masks and optimal windows opening cycles. The strategy
illustrated in the present analysis is based on natural ventilation, which is simple, efficient,
and virtually free to implement. The same modelling framework, however, can be
employed for mechanical ventilation cycles based on HVAC systems (since what counts is
ultimately the air exchange rate, not its source).

Materials and Methods

The infection risk model used in the present analysis is essentially based on the GammaitoniNucci (GN) model, which is adequate for confined, ventilated environments [Gammaitoni 1997].
This model is based on the assumption that newly-produced viral particles are instantly diluted
over the whole environment volume (perfect-mixing) and that the emission rate parameter ER
(emission rate, i.e. number of viral particles generated per hour by each infective subject) is
known, at least as an averaged value over the exposure time 
 . A correct estimation for
the emission rate parameter ER is not trivial and mostly based on a semi-empirical approach
combining viral load measurements from clinical trials and reverse engineering from observed
outbreaks, assuming for ER averaged values selected from the variability ranges which arise
from the following formula [Morawska 2009]. The “infective viral reduction rate“ (IVRR) is the
second parameter which enters the GN model and takes into account air ventilation (AER) and
gravitational re-deposition (λ):    λ . A λ value equal 0.5 vol/h was considered
during the whole exposure time, on the basis of the half-life in air of the SARS-CoV-2 virus of
about 1h as reported in [van Doremalen 2020]. According to the GN model, the risk of infection
in a volume V, where one infective subject is present and the initial number of viral particles is
n (which can be different from zero) is then given by the general formula:

To account for the effect of PPE (personal protective equipment, in this case, face masks) in
reducing both the number of viral particles generated by infective subjects, and also reducing
the likelihood of inhalation of viral particles by exposed subjects, Eq (1)is extended introducing
two scaling factors:

Windows opening implies a periodic activation of air exchanges per hour, which are supposed to
occur only during lesson breaks. Therefore, the IVRR function in (3) become a periodic
rectangular wave function over the full lesson time, with peaks influenced by higher values of
the air exchange rate (AER) as due to complete windows opening (2vol/h) or mechanical
ventilation (up to 10 vol/h). In this study we explore the influence on the classroom risk
function of different cycles (and levels) of the AER within the IRVV function by changing the
time duration of lecture and breaks. Fig. 2 report only two exemplary cycles (long and short
windows opening cycles) taken as input for the results shown in Fig. 3-4, whereas optimization
of the risk function shown in Fig. 5-6 considered 3500 different combination of t and t with
a time resolution of 1 min which generated the same amount of different ventilation cycles.
Another factor to be considered is the effective volume to be considered to dilute the aerosol
viral cloud under the perfect mixing approximation. According to recent CFD simulations of
aerosol cloud in classrooms [Abuhegazy 2020] , aerosol particles from a student source would
not be diluted over the entire volume even after a transient of 300s and the viral cloud volume
during the first part of the emission transient would be negligible compared to V. For these
reasons an effective lower volume Veff = 0.85 V in equation (3) and (4) was considered for the
present analysis.
In the present work, the GN-model is based on the concept of cumulative risk. In a scenario
where the infective source is removed from the environment (e.g. student or teacher leaving
the classroom), the ER parameter in Eq (1) and (2) would become zero. However, we can
observe that even when ER =0 in (2), the infection risk ܴ௤ீே ሺ‫ݐ‬ሻ would remain greater than zero,
because of the multiplicative factor  (and intuitively, due to the viral load already present
in the environment).

Another underlying assumption, which is valid at least in Italian secondary schools and in many
schools in EU countries, is that the susceptible subjects at the beginning (S0) remain always the
same and do not vary over the course of the school day. For at least one infection to occur, the
cumulative risk Rc(t)= C(t)/S0 must be greater than 1/ S0. Therefore, the condition for zero
infections to occur over the total exposure time is:

local regulation. Two situations were separately considered. First, one positive student
source remaining for 5 h in the same classroom but exiting it at each break interval (ER =0 at
each break). Second, a positive teacher source supposed to remain for 2 hours only with higher
ER levels. In fact, a high school teacher stays in the same classroom not more than two hours
a day on average, moving to a new classroom afterwards. A python routine have been
implemented to solve eq. (1-2) and (4) for both cases.

Cumulative risk curves R (t) are shown in Fig. 1 and 2 as a function of two variable parameters
as shown in Equation (4):   (lecture time, when ventilation is turned off) and  (duration of
breaks, when ventilation is active). All surfaces were calculated for a typical classroom of
volume 8 * 7 * 3 170 m . For the teacher case, higher levels of ER compared to the student
case were required to account for a higher (average) speak activity. In all simulations the ER
values employed were selected from published data [Buonanno 2020] for the case of standing
person with normal (ER about 25 quanta h ) and lowered vocal activity (average ER down to
15 quanta h ). The latter case refers to a person speaking at moderate volume. This could be
the case of a teacher speaking with a microphone connected to a voice amplification system.
Even if staying in a classroom less than students (in average for only two hours), an infective
teacher speaking most of that time will be a much greater viral source for airborne transmission
and the corresponding risk curves will increase more steeply in the first 2h of exposure. After a
teacher left the room, the ER in that room drops to zero, but the viral charge previously
emitted by him/her will still be present for the next hours (although it will lower down after
several ventilation cycles).

As previously stated, a significant risk reduction could be obtained with more frequent
ventilation. Thus, there is motivation for finding an optimal set of  ,  that would minimize

, noting that only limited actions can be undertaken to vary the other exogenous
,   , 
parameters. Classroom volumes are usually fixed (except for the very few cases in which new
spaces have been allocated in the current year). Second, acting on mask filter capabilities is
also limited. That is, one may think it would improve the mask parameters f and f by
requesting students to wear ffp2 masks all of the time, but this prescription for students
younger than 18 years has been excluded by most regulators. In fact, wearing high-filtering
masks in school contexts for long periods may expose students to other respiratory risks. The
average pulmonary inflation p cannot be controlled in a lecture context and is reasonably
known for human body. Finally, the critical emission rate parameter ER depends on actual
habits/behaviors and is affected by uncertainties which were taken into account in the present
study. In any case, both ER and p cannot be controlled by legislation (only ER for the teacher
case could be lowered down by technical countermeasures, like the adoption of a microphone
with amplifier). Instead, acting on ventilation (AER) and then on the directly linked IVVR is
feasible in all schools and can be effective, as shown in this and other studies [Buonanno
2021]. On the other hand, maximizing AER in winter would require mechanical ventilation and
operating HVAC systems, lacking in most schools. We can act only on windows opening for
significant periods of time to increase the air exchange and dilution of the viral load. Therefore,
an effective risk reduction pathway is the identification of a numerical optimum for the
ventilation schedule as a function of time - AERopt(t) - which minimizes the cumulative risk
within certain boundaries. The risk function to be minimized is z = ,    ,   and is
represented in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 and the related contour plots of Fig. 3. As evident, a minimum
exists at around   ,    30 min , 50 since the z function is showing a clear monotonic
behavior in the surrounding of the x=y direction. This would imply an unusual recommendation
for most schools: class breaks should last longer than the classes themselves. This fact is
eventually unsurprising, since opening windows during breaks implies a higher AER-level than
during classes (Fig. A1 in Appendix). In addition, this fact is dictated by practical requirements.
That is, with low outdoor temperatures (particularly in January–March in schools located in the
northern hemisphere) and a concurrent risk for other seasonal diseases, it is only during
“lesson breaks” with no students inside the classroom, that one could think to increase the AER

However, since overly long breaks may also cause practical and organizational difficulties for
schools, wider “safety zones” for the variation of ,
are recommended in Fig. 6. These
zones are defined below so-called “one-infection thresholds” (varying for different values of the
number S of students per classroom). A certain combination of ,
from the safety zone
would thus provide sufficient ventilation and dilution of the viral load to lower the risk for new
indirect infections below 1/S . That is, no infections would be expected in a group of S
susceptible individuals if the room were ventilated for an equal period of time ( ) at every
class break. Green regions suggest values for ,
which would be safe for the infective
teacher as well for the infective student case, i.e. regardless of source type. In order to achieve
complete safety in a classroom of 30 students exposed for 5 hours, classes should last
approximately 45 min but breaks should be very long (about 35 minutes). This would
eventually turn into a complex or even unfeasible scheduling challenge for schools (only 3.75
lesson+break cycles would be possible within 5 hours). On the other hand, in a classroom of
15 students only, lessons could last 45-47 min and breaks easily reduced to 15 minutes,
allowing 5 entire cycles.

Cumulative airborne risk is the key to understanding airborne infections of SARS-CoV-2 within
classrooms. This originates from the cumulative nature of air saturation and viral aerosol
formation. Furthermore, students and teachers exposed in schools for long periods of time to
possible infection sources and standard sanitation/ventilation cycles during breaks cannot lower
the residual viral load in their environment to zero. On the contrary, it has been shown that a
small amount of this load would still be present in a classroom even after ventilation cycles at
high N, with students leaving classrooms during breaks. On the other hand, an infective student
re-entering a classroom would continue to emit viral quanta, and an infective teacher remaining
in the room for a number of hours could emit sufficient viral quanta to indirectly infect other
people, even after she/he exited the classroom. Although the dynamic single-zone model
employed here contains some approximations, clear indications arises from this analysis.
Firstly, windows in schools should be kept open most of the time to decrease the airborne risk
to acceptable levels. Secondly, equipping teachers with microphone and voice amplification
systems could be an additional effective mitigation strategy (in case of teachers as infective
source).
Numerical results have indicated that windows should be fully (not partially) open during breaks
and that breaks should possibly last as long as possible. However, since these
recommendations may cause considerable organizational difficulties in schools and thermal
discomfort in the winter season, compromise solutions are necessary. To prevent thermal
discomfort and other seasonal diseases, schools could limit full natural ventilation during
breaks. Therefore, specific safety regions for break and lecture durations (i.e., the parameters
influencing ventilation profiles) for the different cases of infective teacher and infective student
—have been identified. In this optimization, dilution and lowering of contagion risk were based
entirely on natural ventilation cycles (i.e., opening windows) rather than on mechanical
ventilation. Mechanical ventilation systems are expected at larger scale in future building
upgrades but are not currently present in the vast majority of schools worldwide. Results of the
minimization of the cumulative risk function indicate f.i. that alternating lectures of 45 min with
breaks of 15 min would keep the contagion risk below the one-contagion-threshold in groups of
15 students, but for larger groups of 30 scholars much longer breaks of about 35 minutes
would be necessary. Thus, as a general rule it may be wise, as suggested also by intuition, to
have smaller class sizes to control airborne transmission in schools. Finally, it is once again
remarked that only a combination of optimal air exchange cycles with protection masks worn by
all individuals could lower the risk of airborne contagion in school classrooms to a desirable
safety level of zero contagions in all conditions.
