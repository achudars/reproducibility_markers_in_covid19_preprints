Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 reportedly exhibits substantially higher transmission than the ancestral strain and
may generate a major surge of cases before vaccines become widely available, while the P.1 and B.1.351 variants may be
equally transmissible and also resist vaccines. All three variants can be sensitively detected by RT-PCR due to an
otherwise rare del11288-11296 mutation in orf1ab; B.1.1.7 can also be detected using the common TaqPath kit. Testing,
contact tracing, and isolation programs overwhelmed by SARS-CoV-2 could slow the spread of the new variants, which
are still outnumbered by tracers in most countries. However, past failures and high rates of mistrust may lead health
agencies to conclude that tracing is futile, dissuading them from redirecting existing tracers to focus on the new
variants. Here we apply a branching-process model to estimate the effectiveness of implementing a variant-focused
testing, contact tracing, and isolation strategy with realistic levels of performance. Our model indicates that
bidirectional contact tracing can substantially slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants even in regions where a large
fraction of the population refuses to cooperate with contact tracers or to abide by quarantine and isolation requests.
The frequency of the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 has
grown rapidly from its initial detection in October 2020 to
become the dominant strain in southeastern England by
2021. Studies have estimated the new strain is between
40% and 80% more contagious​1,2​. The rapid exponential
growth of B.1.1.7, now found in dozens of countries, risks
another and potentially higher wave of COVID-19 cases
prior to widespread vaccination. Meanwhile, early reports
suggest that current vaccines​3 and prior SARS-CoV-2
exposure​4 may be less protective against the B.1.351 and P.1
variants now common in South Africa and Brazil.
All three variants share an otherwise rare del11288-11296
(3675-3677 SGF) mutation in orf1ab that can be detected
using a single RT-PCR reaction​5​; B.1.1.7 can also be
distinguished with the TaqPath diagnostic test​6​, twenty
million of which are manufactured weekly​7​. As such,
existing COVID-19 testing infrastructure can be used to
track the transmission of the new variants. Samples testing
positive by other kits can be re-screened​8 without an
emergency use authorization.
Test-trace-isolate (TTI) strategies have been widely used to
mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2​9​. Models by the present
authors​10 and others​11 have found that incorporating
backwards tracing to identify infector individuals could
dramatically increase the efficacy of tracing programs.
However, testing delays, mistrust, and low compliance have
undermined the confidence of health authorities in the

benefits of TTI​12,13​. Moreover, efficacy sharply decreases
when caseloads are high​14​, as is true for SARS-CoV-2 – but
not​ ​yet​ the variants – in many regions.
Given the current low prevalence of the variants in most
jurisdictions and the ability to identify cases of the new
variant using existing testing infrastructure, we
hypothesised that TTI programs dedicated to controlling
them could substantially reduce the harm inflicted prior to
widespread vaccination of populations later in 2021,
especially if vaccine reformulation is needed. Such
programs could be enhanced through incorporation of
bidirectional tracing​10​.
However, the effectiveness of TTI strategies varies widely
from region to region due to programmatic and
population-level differences in variables such as the
proportion of cases who share their contact history with
contact tracers; the proportion who comply with quarantine
and isolation requests; and the overall rate of tracing
success. Given this variation, it is unclear whether tracing
programs exhibiting realistic levels of performance could
feasibly dampen the spread of the new variants.
To evaluate the potential benefits of applying targeted
test-trace-isolate to control variants, we applied a
branching-process model of COVID-19 contact tracing​10 to
estimate the change in the effective reproduction number
achievable across a wide range of parameters.

small reductions in ​R​eff can have a large impact on the total
number of downstream cases arising from a given index
case over a given timespan. For example, under a simple
geometric series approach, reducing ​Reff
​ by 0.1 from a
starting value between 1.2 and 2.0 reduces the total number
of child cases after 10 generations by 37-43%; an ​R​eff
reduction of 0.2 results in a reduction in child cases of
61-66%. Given an average generation time of 6 days, 10
generations equates to roughly 2 months – enough time,
given sufficient delay in the spread of the new variant, to
vaccinate a substantial fraction of the population.

Methods
In our branching-process model​(Bradshaw et al. 2021)​,
each case generates a number of new cases drawn from a
negative binomial distribution according to pre-specified
incubation- and generation-time distributions (Table 1).
Cases are identified and isolated based on symptoms alone
or through contact tracing. Cases either comply with
isolation requests or ignore them completely according to
some fixed probability of compliance; cases that comply
generate no further cases.
Successful tracing depends on the identified case sharing
their contact history with tracers, and on the contact in
question taking place within the time window (measured in
days pre-symptom onset for symptomatic cases, and days
pre-identification for asymptomatic cases). Environmental
transmission is assumed untraceable. Symptomatic cases
require a positive test before initiating contact tracing.

Discussion
Our results suggest that regions with even moderately
functional contact tracing programs focused on the new
variants could substantially slow their spread. Given a 2-day
window for bidirectionally tracing contacts pre-symptom
onset, our model predicts that a program with 70% trace
success, 70% data sharing, and 70% compliance with
isolation could achieve an ​Reff
​ reduction of at least 0.1
relative to the no-tracing case. Given a 6-day window for
efficient bidirectional tracing, regions with just 50%
data-sharing, trace success, and isolation compliance could
achieve a reduction of 0.1.

Each outbreak was initialized with 20 index cases to
minimize stochastic extinction and designated as
“controlled” if it reached extinction (zero new cases) before
reaching 10,000 cumulative cases. Effective reproduction
numbers (​R​eff​) were computed as the mean number of child
cases produced per case.

Under simple assumptions, such a reduction would reduce
the number of child cases produced in two months by
roughly 40%, buying time for vaccination to immunise
many more people. More effective tracing programs can
achieve larger reductions. Higher rates of cooperation
might be achieved through home visits by contact tracers;
exoneration for anything discovered in the course of contact
tracing​13​; and financial and other ​support of people in
quarantine and isolation​16​. In principle, concentrating
vaccination in communities experiencing out-of-control
variant transmission could further impair viral spread and
increase the sustainability of TTI.

Results
To investigate the potential for TTI to mitigate the spread of
variants, we investigated the effective reproduction number
achieved across a range of data-sharing and trace-success
rates (Figure 1). To account for uncertainty in variant
transmissibility, we explored outcomes for reproduction
numbers between 1.2 and 2.0; these values assume that
other interventions are already in place.
In the absence of contact tracing, identification and
isolation of symptomatic cases alone reduced ​R​eff by 0.2 to
0.3 even when quarantine and isolation compliance was low
(Figure 1, top rows). When identification and isolation left
R​eff substantially greater than 1 (when base R ≥ 1.4),
moderate levels of tracing could have substantial effects.

These results assume a high availability of suitable
diagnostic tests and a rapid and consistent testing
turnaround. They also take no account of any medical,
demographic, geospatial or behavioural variation between
cases that could influence the spread of the new variants.

When contacts were traced up to 2 days prior to symptom
onset, ~60-70% data sharing and trace success rates were
required to achieve an ​Reff
​ reduction of at least 0.1, relative
to isolation alone. If the window was extended to 6 days
pre-onset to enable more effective bidirectional tracing,
roughly 45-55% data sharing and trace success was
sufficient. Higher levels of data sharing and trace success
could achieve substantially larger reductions: in many
scenarios, 85% data sharing and trace success reduced ​R​eff
by >0.2 in the 2-day case and >0.35 in the 6-day case.

Our results suggest that TTI programs could help slow the
spread of more transmissible and vaccine-resistant variants
in regions where they are currently rare, providing vital
time for widespread vaccination. As TTI efficacy is limited
at high caseloads​14​, these findings indicate that tracing
programs should immediately prioritise controlling the new
variants rather than less transmissible – but currently more
widespread – ancestral strains.

Due to the exponential growth of uncontrolled epidemics,

Structure of the model - Infection dynamics
A new case is infected at some ​exposure time​, equal to zero if the case is an index case and otherwise drawn from the
generation time distribution​ of its parent case (Table 1). If not asymptomatic, the case develops symptoms at some
onset time​ drawn from an ​incubation time distribution​. Asymptomatic cases do not develop symptoms, but are still
assigned an onset time for the purpose of determining their generation-time distribution .
The number of child cases infected by the case is drawn from a negative binomial distribution, with mean equal to the
appropriate reproduction number and heterogeneity determined by the overdispersion parameter ​k.​ The exposure times of
these child cases are drawn from a skewed-normal ​generation time distribution​ centered on the symptom onset of their
parent 40​
​ , with an SD parameter (ω) of 2 and a skew parameter (α) chosen to give a pre-specified probability of
pre-symptomatic transmission (for a symptomatic parent). The generation time distribution for an asymptomatic parent is
centered on its “effective” onset time (see above). The shape of the generation-time distribution is the same for all cases.
The expected number of children produced by a case depends on its symptomatic status, and is determined by the overall R0
value, the proportion of asymptomatic carriers pasym , and the relative infectiousness xasym of asymptomatic carriers
(expressed as a fraction of R0 ). Given a reproduction number for asymptomatics of Rasym = R0 · xasym , the reproduction
p
number of symptomatic cases that produces the desired overall R0 is given by Rsym = Rasym · 1−pasym .
asym

Structure of the model - Infection control
Once symptoms develop, a case is ​identified​ by public health authorities with probability pisol , with the delay from onset to
identification drawn from a ​delay distribution​. Identified cases are instructed to isolate, and each case complies with
probability pcomply . Cases that comply generate no further child cases after their time of identification; cases that do not are
unaffected. Asymptomatic cases cannot be identified from symptoms, but may be identified via contact tracing from other
cases; once identified, they are instructed to isolate as above.
An identified case is ​tested​, which takes time drawn from a test time distribution and returns a positive result with
probability equal to the sensitivity of the test (since the model does not consider uninfected individuals, the specificity of the
test is also not considered). A positive test result is required to initiate contact tracing.
The contacts of cases testing positive are ​traced​. Tracing can only proceed outward from a case if they share their contact
history with a contact tracer (see below). Tracing can identify the children of the traced case (forward tracing) or its parent
(reverse/backward tracing). The speed and success probability of tracing depends on several factors:
●

If the contact between the trace originator and the tracee occurred environmentally (determined with probability penv ),
tracing cannot take place.

●

If transmission was not environmental, the contact can be traced manually if:
○

The trace originator shares their contact history with a contact tracer (determined independently for each case with
probability pshare_manual );

○

The time between contact (as above) and the identification time or symptom onset of the trace initiator (whichever
came first) is less than the ​contact-tracing window​ of the tracing system;

○

The tracee is successfully traced by the contact tracer (determined independently for each individual case with
probability ptrace_manual ).

Cases that are successfully traced are identified at a time equal to the ​trace initiation time​ of the trace originator plus a
delay time drawn from the appropriate ​trace delay distribution​. Identified contacts are quarantined, with an effect
identical to isolation and governed by the same compliance variable (i.e. a case either complies with both quarantine and
isolation, or neither). Quarantined cases identified through tracing can then be isolated, tested, and traced. If a case is
isolated through tracing earlier than they would have been otherwise, child cases whose exposure time would be later than

Structure of the model - Run initiation
A simulation of an outbreak under the branching-process model is initialised with a given number of index cases (by default
20, in order to reduce the probability of stochastic elimination) and proceeds generation by generation until either no further
child cases are generated (extinction) or the run exceeds one of:
1.

A ​cumulative case limit​ of 10,000 cases, or

2.

A ​time limit​ of 52 weeks.

In practice, virtually all runs either went extinct or reached the cumulative case limit; the overall percentage of runs that
exceeded the time limit was less than 0.02%, and the highest percentage observed for any single scenario was 1.3%. The
cumulative case limit was selected to minimise the chance of a run that would otherwise go extinct being terminated
prematurely while preserving computational tractability; in test runs with a cumulative case limit of 100,000 cases, fewer
than 2% of extinct runs in any scenario had a cumulative case count of over 10,000.
A terminated run was deemed “controlled” if it reached extinction, and uncontrolled otherwise. The control rate for a scenario
was computed as the proportion of runs for that scenario that were controlled. 95% credible intervals on the control rate were
computed by beta-binomial conjugacy under a B eta(1, 1) uniform prior, as the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the beta
distribution B eta(1 + k , 1 + n − k ) , where n is the total number of runs for that scenario and k is the number of controlled
runs. Effective reproduction numbers were computed as the mean number of child cases produced across all cases in a run,
averaged across all runs in the scenario. 1,000 runs were performed per scenario.
