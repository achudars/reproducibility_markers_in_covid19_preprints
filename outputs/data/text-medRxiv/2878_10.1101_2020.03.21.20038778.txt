Abstract
Objective: To find out more characteristics and rules of COVID-19 by
analyzing the clinical course of COVID-19 patients in a region outside
Hubei province.
Methods: 37 cases diagnosed adult COVID-19 cases of general
characteristics, history of epidemiology, chronic underlying diseases,
clinical symptoms and complications, chest CT, biochemical monitoring,
severity assessment, treatment and outcome were retrospectively
analyzed, and according to the duration from onset to release from
quarantine were divided into ≤20 -day group and > 20 -day group,
compare the similarities and differences between the two groups.
Results: Among the 37 patients, 5 were mild, 30 were moderate, 1 was
severe and 1 was critical. All the patients were released from quarantine
without death. The average duration from onset to release from
quarantine was 20.2±6.6 days, The average length of stay from onset to
hospitalization was 4.1±3.7 days, and hospitalization duration average
16.1 ±6.2 days. The average age was 44.3±1.67 years. 78.4% of cases
were caused by exposure to a confirmed patient or the workplace of a
confirmed patient. The main symptoms were cough (67.6%), fever
( 62.2%), shortness of breath (32.4%), fatigue (24.3%), sore throat
(21.6%,) vomiting or diarrhea (21.6%). The white blood cell count was
decreased in 27.0% of the patients, and the lymphocyte count was
decreased in 62.2% of the patients, of which 43.5% patients were

≤0.6×109/L. On admission, 86.5% of patients with chest CT showed
pneumonia, including some asymptomatic patients. 68.8% of patients
showed bilateral infiltration. In the > 20-day group, the average age was
49.9±1.38 years old, and the duration from onset to hospitalization was
5.5±3.9 days. Compared with the ≤ 20-day group, the age was older and
duration was longer, P < 0.05. All the 7 asymptomatic patients were ≤20
–day group. When 37 patients were released from quarantine, the white
blood cell count of 16.2% patients was < 4.0×10 9/L, and the lymphocyte
count of 59.5% patients was <1.1×109/L, and the absolute count of white
blood cells and lymphocytes was 5.02±1.34×109/L and 1.03±0.34×109/L
respectively , compared with those on admission, P > 0.05.
Conclusion: The majority of COVID-19 cases in the study area were
mild and moderate, with good clinical outcomes. There were some
special characteristics in the clinical process. The reasons of duration
from onset to release from quarantine were complex. There was no
significant change in the number of granulocytes at the time of release
from quarantine compared to the time of admission.
Keywords: COVID-19 patients, quarantine, characteristic

Background
Previous articles have introduced the clinical characteristics and
outcomes of COVID-19 [1,2,3,4,5,6]. These were mainly early cases in Hubei
province, especially in Wuhan, and due to the limitation of insufficient

medical conditions at that time, this had a certain impact on the outcome
and treatment of COVID 19. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of
patients in Hubei province and outside of Hubei province were different

. There was an article on the early clinical characteristics of 13 COVID

- 19 patients outside Hubei province, but the number was too small and
the article only described the early clinical characteristics

. Liaocheng

city, in the Middle East of China, is a prefecture-level city in Shandong
province with a population of more than 6 million. As a region outside
Hubei province, what are the similarities and differences between the
characteristics of the cases here and those of Hubei province and even
other countries and regions? Besides, are there any special rules for
patients who cannot be released from quarantine for a long time?
Methods
The diagnosis, release from quarantine and severity of all cases
were determined in accordance with the protocol of diagnosis and
treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia issued by National Health
Commission of the People’s Republic of China and National
Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine

[8,9]

. A confirmed case

was defined as a positive result to real-time reverse-transcriptase
polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for nasal and pharyngeal
swab specimens[10].
The criteria for all cases to be released from quarantine were as

recommended in the above protocol, starting with the following three:
1. Body temperature returns to normal for more than 3 days; 2.
Respiratory symptoms improved significantly; 3. Pulmonary imaging
showed significant absorption of acute exudative lesions. On this basis,
strict nucleic acid negative test standard: after 5 days in hospital, every 2
days test, to nucleic acid test negative case, instead of every 24 hours test,
three consecutive test negative, they can be released from quarantine.
During the dynamic test, if nucleic acid negative cases were once again
positive or suspicious, the above steps were restarted. Some cases were
kept in the hospital for 14 days after they were released from quarantine.
Severe cases were identified in accordance with respiratory criteria,
excluding those who did not meet respiratory criteria and require
intensive management [11].
Of the 38 patients, one was 5 months old, a patient identified by
screening and released from quarantine after 9 days in hospital, and was
excluded from this analysis. The other 37 patients were all adults. For the
incubation period, considering the characteristics of the patients in this
study, the time of the first infection with the novel coronavirus was
difficult to be precise, so it was not discussed.
This study retrospectively analyzed the general characteristics,
epidemiological history, chronic underlying diseases, clinical symptoms

assessment, treatment plan and outcome of 37 patients. The results of the
examination at the study time nodes were reported as ±24 hours. 1 patient
lacked serum amyloid A (SAA) and c-reactive protein (CRP) on
admission, and 1 patient lacked erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) on
admission, which were excluded from the corresponding item statistics.
In addition, these patients were divided into ≤20- day group and > 20-day
group according the duration of release from quarantine, and the
similarities and differences between the two groups in the clinical process
were compared, in order to find the relevant factors of nucleic acid
continued positive.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as the means and standard
deviations or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate.
Categorical variables were summarized as the counts and percentages in
each category. T test or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were applied to
continuous variables, and Fisher’s exact tests were used for categorical
variables, and Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for rank classification
variables. All analyses were conducted with SPSS software version 23.0.

The duration from onset to admission of 37 confirmed patients
ranged from 1 day to 10 days, and the number of asymptomatic patients
detected by screening was calculated as 1 day. The shortest length of stay
was 7 days, the longest was 32 days. From onset to release of quarantine,
the shortest was 8 days, the longest was 34 days, and it was 29 days for 1
severe patient and 11 days for 1 critical patient.
According to the pneumonia severity index (PSI) on admission,
89.2% (17+16/37) of patients were classified as low risk grade I and II. In
terms of epidemiological history, all the six patients initially diagnosed
had a history of sojourn in Wuhan, and the subsequent patients were
mainly in contact with the confirmed patients or their workplaces. High
rates of symptoms on admission were cough, fever, shortness of breath,
fatigue, sore throat, vomiting or diarrhea, and 87.0% of the patients had

low fever. No abnormalities of platelets, creatine kinase, or creatinine
were observed in the routine blood biochemistry on admission (table I).
During the treatment, 2 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS), 1 with mild and 1 with moderate [12], were given high-flow nasal
cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy without noninvasive or invasive
mechanical ventilation. Plasma exchange was performed in critically ill
patients with moderate ARDS. No serious complications such as shock,
kidney injury, pulmonary embolism, and diffuse intravascular coagulation
occurred in all patients. In the treatment, 1 critically ill patient received an
antifungal drug, and all patients received two or more antiviral drugs. The
application ratio of other therapeutic measures was in order: thymosin,
oxygen therapy, albumin, hormone, immunoglobulin. The application
proportion of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) was 100%, including
Chinese medicine preparation, acupuncture, moxibustion, etc. (table II).
In the >20-day group, the age was older and the length of stay from
onset to hospitalization was longer (P>0.05). As for the clinical
symptoms on admission, all the 7 asymptomatic patients were ≤20 -day
group. Symptoms of fatigue, sore throat, and shortness of breath were
higher in the ＞20-day group (table I), and patients were treated with
more albumin and thymus peptide (table II), and had longer hospital stays
(table III).

The small number of cases in this study affected the statistical
analysis of some of the results, but it still showed many obvious
characteristics.
The 37 patients were mainly mild and moderate, with only 1 severe
case and 1 critical case. Finally, all patients were released from
quarantine without death, and the clinical outcome was significantly
better than that in Hubei province. [1,5,6,13] The main reason may be that
the patient was relatively mild and the availability of adequate medical
facilities and personnel made the patient less likely to develop into a
severe or critical condition. After hospitalization, all patients were
stratified according to the PSI, which may be a better strategy to improve
the outcome of COVID-19 patients, especially in the outbreak where
medical resources are relatively insufficient

[14]

. Although the proportion

of patients with chronic underlying diseases in this group was 21.6%, it
did not seriously affect the outcome, since most of the patients were
around 44 years old. According to the epidemiological history, some of
the patients in this study were in direct contact with the confirmed
patients, and some were in the same workplace and did not meet the
conceptual standard of close contact, which suggested the existence of the
transmission route of COVID -19 aerosol. Among these patients, the
proportion of asymptomatic patients accounted for 18.9% of the total
patients. In some patients, chest CT scan still showed pneumonia and

decreased white blood cell and lymphocyte counts. Among the first few
symptoms on admission, the proportion of shortness of breath and
gastrointestinal symptoms was high, which could not exclude the
influence of psychological factors. In addition, the proportion of patients
with fever was not high, and the fever was mainly low. These
characteristics were different from other highly infectious respiratory
virus infections.[15,16]Among the routine blood biochemistry on admission,
the most common was a reduction in the lymphocyte count, and in nearly
half of these patients, the number was ≤ 0.6×109/L. White blood cell
counts were mostly normal, and less than a third of patients were lower.
Other abnormalities with relatively high proportions were ESR, albumin,
SAA and CRP, but most of the changes were slight and less specific. Thus,
a decrease in the lymphocyte count may be the most important
monitoring for routine biochemical tests [1,6]. The changes of chest CT in
this group were similar to those in other COVID-19 studies, and were
significantly different from the characteristics of H1N1 pneumonia [17].
The treatment measures of the patients in this group were mainly in
accordance with the protocol [8,9]. Although the patients were mainly mild
and moderate, the treatment was complicated due to the particularity of
the epidemic

[18,19]

. Two-thirds of the patients were given antibiotics,

although there was not enough evidence of bacterial infection. Although
no specific antiviral drugs were recommended, the patients in this group

COVID-19 need to be further investigated, especially in mild and
moderate patients. Many studies had demonstrated the important role of
TCM in inhibiting coronavirus. [20,21,22]
Although the patients in this study were mainly mild and moderate,
there was still a significant difference in the duration from onset to
release form quarantine. The most important basis for release from
quarantine is the persistence of negative nucleic acid test results, so the
duration from onset to release form quarantine reflects the time it takes
the patient to release the virus from the respiratory tract. The average time
from onset to release form quarantine was 20 days. Since the patient
could only be released from quarantine after three consecutive negative
nucleic acid test results, and each test interval was 24 hours, and the
incubation period reported in previous literature was considered [1], the
average duration of virus release in this study should be similar to that of
professor Cao Bin's study .[23]
Some items in the ≤ 20-day group and the > 20-day group were
significantly different, which may be the reason why the quarantine
cannot be released for a long time. The age of the > 20-day group was
older and the time from onset to admission was later, suggesting that

although there was no specific antiviral drug for COVID-19, systematic
supportive treatment after admission could improve outcomes, even in
mild and moderate patients. There was no difference in PSI score, chronic
underlying disease, epidemiological history on admission between the
two groups, possibly due to the small number of cases or mild illness.
Symptoms on admission, 7 asymptomatic patients screened recovered
quickly, which may be related to the viral load and individual differences.
Symptomatic patients, fatigue and pharyngeal pain were more obvious in
patients in the > 20-day group, for unknown reasons. In terms of routine
blood biochemical examination and pulmonary imaging, although the
abnormal proportion of individual indicators in the ＞20-day group was
higher than that in the ≤20-day group, the number of samples was not
large enough to have sufficient clinical significance. There was no
significant difference in the number of patients between the two groups,
which was related to the fact that almost all of the patients were mild and
moderate, while one critically ill patient was quickly released from
quarantine. These clinical results may suggest that there is a cross
relationship between the sustained positive nucleic acid of novel
coronavirus in respiratory tract specimens and the severity of the disease
[1,23,24]

, but it is not a linear relationship, and the reasons for the sustained

positive nucleic acid are complex. The > 20-day group used more drugs,
which may be related to the eagerness to make the patient's nucleic acid

negative.
In particular, there was no significant improvement in the white
blood cell and lymphocyte counts at the time of release from quarantine
and at the time of admission in either the ≤20 days group or the > 20 days
group. The reasons need to be further studied.
The number of cases in this study is not large and has obvious
regional characteristics, and the disease is mainly mild and moderate,
which cannot represent the characteristics of a large number of patients in
a large geographical range. It is also not representative of severe and
critical patients.
Conclusion
Most of the COVID-19 cases in Liaocheng city are mild and
moderate. The main cause of infection is exposure to a confirmed patient
or the workplace of a confirmed patient. The main clinical symptoms are
cough, fever and fatigue, but shortness of breath, sore throat and
gastrointestinal symptoms are also common. Chest CT scan showing
pneumonia and reduced lymphocyte count are the most important
adjunctive examination. The duration released from quarantine was
related to age, the length of time from onset to admission, the presence or
absence of symptoms, and was not related to mild or normal type. There
was no significant improvement in white blood cell and lymphocyte
counts at the time of release from quarantine compared to the time of
16 / 18
