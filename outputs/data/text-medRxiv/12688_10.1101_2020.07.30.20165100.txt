Abstract

24

Bangladesh is in the rising phase of the ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019

25

(COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

26

The scientific literature on clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients from Bangladesh is

27

scarce. This study aimed to report the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of

28

patients with COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional study at three

29

dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. The severity of the COVID-19 cases was assessed based on

30

the WHO interim guidance. Data were collected only from non-critical COVID-19 patients as

31

critical patients required immediate intensive care admission making them unable to respond

32

to the questions. A total of 103 RT-PCR confirmed non-critical COVID-19 patients were

33

enrolled. Most of the patients (71.8%) were male. Mild, moderate and severe illness were

34

assessed in 74.76%, 9.71% and 15.53% of patients respectively. Nearly 52.4% of patients had

35

a co-morbidity, with hypertension being the most common (34%), followed by diabetes

36

mellitus (21.4%) and ischemic heart disease (9.7%). Fever (78.6%), weakness (68%) and

37

cough (44.7%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Other common symptoms

38

included loss of appetite (37.9%), difficulty in breathing (37.9%), altered sensation of taste or

39

smell (35.0%), headache (32%) and body ache (32%). The median time from onset of

40

symptom to attending hospitals was 7 days (IQR 4-10). This study will help both the

41

clinicians and epidemiologists to understand the magnitude and clinical spectrum of COVID-

42

19 patients in Bangladesh.

Introduction

45

The world has been experiencing one of the most serious public health crises in the history of

46

humankind. The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by

47

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 28 July 2020, over 16

48

million individuals have been infected with over 650,000 deaths worldwide1. SARS-COV-2

49

infection predominantly results in an acute respiratory illness. In addition, it can cause a

50

myriad of extrapulmonary symptoms. The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic or

51

mildly symptomatic flu-like illness to potentially life-threatening critical conditions2. Recent

52

studies suggest that the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 can vary among different ethnicities

53

and geographical locations across the world3.

54
55

Owing to a population of over 160 million, inadequate healthcare system, and poor personal

56

hygiene among the general population, Bangladesh is considered one of the high-risk

57

countries for coronavirus spread. The first official case of COVID-19 was reported on 8

58

March 2020, and the epidemic still appears to be in a growing phase. As of 30 July 2020, a

59

total of 234,889 cases and 3083 deaths have been reported in Bangladesh1. However, the

60

information on clinical manifestations from Bangladesh is scarce in the literature. Therefore,

61

this study aimed to document the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 patients attending fever

62

clinics in Bangladesh.

63
64

Methods

65

This was a cross-sectional study conducted among RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients

66

attending the fever clinic of a dedicated COVID-19 Hospital (Kurmitola general hospital) in

67

Dhaka city of Bangladesh and two Upazila health complexes from different districts (Jessore

68

and Jhenaidah) from 5 July to 18 July 2020. Diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection and

69

assessment of severity were done based on the WHO interim guidance4. Data were collected

70

only from non-critical COVID-19 patients as critical patients required immediate intensive

71

care admission making them unable to respond to the questions. Socio-demographic and

72

clinical data were evaluated and collected by experienced clinicians using a pretested case

record form. Verbal consent was taken from all participants. The institutional review board of

74

Biomedical Research Foundation, Bangladesh approved the study protocol (Ref. no:

75

BRF/ERB/2020/003).

76
77

Data were analysed by SPSS Statistics software 22.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Data were

78

expressed in number (percentages, %) and median (interquartile range, IQR) as appropriate.

79

We used Pearson’s chi square test, Fisher’s exact test and Kruskal Wallis test to compare

80

differences between mild, moderate and severe patients where appropriate. Logistic

81

regression was used to study associations. P <0.5 was set as statistically significant.

82
83

Results

84

A total of 103 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled. About 75% (77) of

85

cases presented with mild symptoms, followed by nearly 15% severe and 10% moderate

86

cases. Overall, the median age of the participants was 37 years (IQR: 31-53); more than 80%

87

of these patients were under 60 years (Table 1). Most of the patients were male (71.8%).

88

More than half of the patients (52.4%) had at least one co-morbidity, including hypertension

89

in 35 (34%), diabetes mellitus in 22 (21.4%) and ischaemic heart disease in 10 (9.7%)

90

patients. Notably, around 80% of moderate and severe cases had comorbidity. The median

91

time from onset of symptom to attending fever clinic was 7 days (IQR 4-10).

92
93

Overall, the most common symptoms reported were fever (78.6%), weakness (68%) and

94

cough (44.7%) followed by loss of appetite (37.9%), difficulty in breathing (37.9%), altered

95

sensation of taste or smell (35.0%), headache (32%) and body ache (32%). Less common

96

symptoms included sore throat (28.2%), diarrhoea (22.3%) and chest pain (14.6%). Fever

97

was the most prevalent symptom in all groups of patients. Interestingly, 80% of moderate

98

patients experienced difficulty in breathing compared to 62.5% severe patients (Table 2).

99

More than half of the severe cases had tachycardia (56.3%) and tachypnoea (56.3%) at

100

presentation; their median oxygen saturation was 87.5% (IQR 77.25-89.0).

101
102

Discussion

103

This study aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of RT-PCR confirmed noncritical

104

patients with COVID-19 attending fever clinics of government hospitals in Bangladesh.

105
106

The most prevalent symptoms of non-critical COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh consist of

107

fever (78.6%), fatigue (68%) and cough (44.7%). Similarly, in a meta-analysis from China,

108

most prevalent symptoms were fever (80.4%), cough (63.1%) and fatigue (46%)5. However,

109

studies from China included both critical and non-critical patients. In contrast, one study from

110

Europe on mild to moderate patients reported that headache (70.3%), loss of smell (70.2%),

111

nasal obstruction (67.8%) were the most common symptoms; fever was reported by only

112

45.4% of patients. Interestingly, 39% of mild cases, 40% of moderate cases and 12.5% of

113

severe cases reported the altered sensation of taste or smell in this study. While olfactory and

114

gustatory dysfunctions were prevalent symptoms in European patients, they were only rarely

115

reported in Chinese patients6,7.

116
117

In this study, about 15% of cases were presented with severe symptoms. This is consistent

118

with a summary report of 72,314 cases from China8. As expected, most of the severe patients

119

(81.3%) had co-morbidity. Age >60 years, patients with diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart

120

disease and chronic kidney disease had significantly higher odds of developing severe disease

121

at presentation (Suppl. Table 1).

123

Our study has some limitations. First, the sample size of this study was small. Second, we

124

could not include critical patients due to the requirement of emergency management.

125

Therefore, our findings could not be generalized in the context of Bangladesh.

126
127

Our study reports the presenting symptoms of SARS-COV-2 infections among the

128

Bangladeshi population. Although there are certain similarities in the range of symptoms with

129

the Chinese population, where the pandemic originated, there are some unique findings like

130

the high prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions. This study will help both the

131

clinicians and epidemiologists to understand the magnitude and clinical spectrum of COVID-

132

19 patients in Bangladesh.
