ABSTRACT

We sequenced the genomes of 5,085 SARS-CoV-2 strains

67

causing two COVID-19 disease waves in metropolitan Houston, Texas, an

68

ethnically diverse region with seven million residents. The genomes were

69

from viruses recovered in the earliest recognized phase of the pandemic in

70

Houston, and an ongoing massive second wave of infections. The virus

71

was originally introduced into Houston many times independently. Virtually

72

all strains in the second wave have a Gly614 amino acid replacement in the

73

spike protein, a polymorphism that has been linked to increased

74

transmission and infectivity. Patients infected with the Gly614 variant

75

strains had significantly higher virus loads in the nasopharynx on initial

76

diagnosis. We found little evidence of a significant relationship between

77

virus genotypes and altered virulence, stressing the linkage between

78

disease severity, underlying medical conditions, and host genetics. Some

79

regions of the spike protein - the primary target of global vaccine efforts -

80

are replete with amino acid replacements, perhaps indicating the action of

81

selection. We exploited the genomic data to generate defined single amino

82

acid replacements in the receptor binding domain of spike protein that,

83

importantly, produced decreased recognition by the neutralizing

84

monoclonal antibody CR30022. Our study is the first analysis of the

85

molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 in two infection waves in a major

86

metropolitan region. The findings will help us to understand the origin,

87

composition, and trajectory of future infection waves, and the potential

IMPORTANCE

92

COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus occurring in

93

communities globally that had an initial disease wave. Metropolitan

94

Houston, Texas, with a population of 7 million, is experiencing a massive

95

second disease wave that began in late May 2020. To understand SARS-

96

CoV-2 molecular population genomic architecture, evolution, and

97

relationship between virus genotypes and patient features, we sequenced

98

the genomes of 5,085 SARS-CoV-2 strains from these two waves. Our study

There is concern about second and subsequent waves of

causing two distinct COVID-19 disease waves.

[Introduction]

106

Pandemic disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome

107

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is now responsible for massive human

108

morbidity and mortality worldwide (1-5). The virus was first documented to cause

109

severe respiratory infections in Wuhan, China, beginning in late December 2019

110

(6-9). Global dissemination occurred extremely rapidly and has affected major

111

population centers on most continents (10, 11). In the United States, the Seattle

112

and the New York City (NYC) regions have been especially important centers of

113

COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. For example, as of August 19,

114

2020, there were 227,419 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in NYC, causing 56,831

115

hospitalizations and 19,005 confirmed fatalities and 4,638 probable fatalities (12).

116

Similarly, in Seattle and King County, 17,989 positive patients and 696 deaths

117

have been reported as of August 18, 2020 (13).

118

The Houston metropolitan area is the fourth largest and most ethnically

119

diverse city in the United States, with a population of approximately 7 million

120

(14, 15). The 2,400-bed Houston Methodist health system has seven hospitals

121

and serves a large, multiethnic, and socioeconomically diverse patient population

122

throughout greater Houston (13, 14). The first COVID-19 case in metropolitan

123

Houston was reported on March 5, 2020 with community spread occurring one

124

week later (16). Many of the first cases in our region were associated with

125

national or international travel in areas known to have SARS-CoV-2 virus

126

outbreaks (16). A central molecular diagnostic laboratory serving all Houston

127

Methodist hospitals and our very early adoption of a molecular test for the SARS-

128

CoV-2 virus permitted us to rapidly identify positive patients and interrogate

129

genomic variation among strains causing early infections in the greater Houston

130

area. Our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes causing disease in Houston has

131

continued unabated since early March and is ongoing. Genome sequencing and

132

related efforts were expanded extensively in late May as we recognized that a

133

prominent second wave was underway (Figure 1).

134

Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to the Houston area

135

many times, independently, from diverse geographic regions, with virus

136

genotypes representing genetic clades causing disease in Europe, Asia, South

137

America and elsewhere in the United States. There was widespread community

138

dissemination soon after COVID-19 cases were reported in Houston. Strains with

139

a Gly614 amino acid replacement in the spike protein, a polymorphism that has

140

been linked to increased transmission and in vitro cell infectivity, increased

141

significantly over time and caused virtually all COVID-19 cases in the massive

142

second disease wave. Patients infected with strains with the Gly614 variant had

143

significantly higher virus loads in the nasopharynx on initial diagnosis. Some

144

naturally occurring single amino acid replacements in the receptor binding

145

domain (RBD) of spike protein resulted in decreased reactivity with a neutralizing

146

monoclonal antibody, consistent with the idea that some virus variants arise due

147

to host immune pressure.

Description of metropolitan Houston. Houston, Texas, is located in the

151

southwestern United States, 50 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico. It is the

152

most ethnically diverse city in the United States (14). Metropolitan Houston is

153

comprised predominantly of Harris County plus parts of eight contiguous

154

surrounding counties. In the aggregate, the metropolitan area includes 9,444

155

square miles. The estimated population size of metropolitan Houston is 7 million

156

(https://www.houston.org/houston-data).

157

Epidemic curve characteristics over two disease waves. The first

158

confirmed case of COVID-19 in the Houston metropolitan region was reported on

159

March 5, 2020 (16), and the first confirmed case diagnosed in Houston Methodist

160

hospitals was reported on March 6, 2020. The epidemic curve indicated a first

161

wave of COVID-19 cases that peaked around April 11-15, followed by a decline

162

in cases until May 11. Soon thereafter, the slope of the case curve increased with

163

a very sharp uptick in confirmed cases beginning on June 12 (Figure 1B). We

164

consider May 11 as the transition between waves, as this date is the inflection

165

point of the cumulative new cases curve and had the absolute lowest number of

166

new cases in the mid-May time period. Thus, for the data presented herein, wave

167

1 is defined as March 5 through May 11, 2020, and wave 2 is defined as May 12

168

through July 7, 2020. Epidemiologic trends within the Houston Methodist Hospital

169

population were mirrored by data from Harris County and the greater

170

metropolitan Houston region (Figure 1A). Through the 7th of July, 25,366

171

COVID-19 cases were reported in Houston, 37,776 cases in Harris County, and

172

53,330 in metropolitan Houston, including 9,823 cases in Houston Methodist

176

a484b85bb5efcb7c07c6914).

177

During the first wave (early March through May 11), 11,476 COVID-19

178

cases were reported in Houston, including 1,729 cases in the Houston Methodist

179

Hospital system. Early in the first wave (from March 5 through March 30, 2020),

180

we tested 3,080 patient specimens. Of these, 406 (13.2%) samples were positive

181

for SARS-CoV-2, representing 40% (358/898) of all confirmed cases in

182

metropolitan Houston during that time period. As our laboratory was the first

183

hospital-based facility to have molecular testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2

184

available on site, our strain samples are likely representative of COVID-19

185

infections during the first wave.

186

For the entire study period (March 5 through July 7, 2020), we tested

187

68,418 specimens from 55,800 patients. Of these, 9,121 patients (16.4%) had a

188

positive test result, representing 17.1% (9,121/53,300) of all confirmed cases in

189

metropolitan Houston. Thus, our strain samples are also representative of those

190

responsible for COVID-19 infections in the massive second wave.

191

To test the hypothesis that, on average, the two waves affected different

192

groups of patients, we analyzed individual patient characteristics (hospitalized

193

and non-hospitalized) in each wave. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found

194

significant differences in the COVID-19 patients in each wave (Table S1). For

195

example, patients in the second wave were significantly younger, had fewer

comorbidities, were more likely to be Hispanic/Latino (by self-report), and lived in

197

zip codes with lower median incomes (Table S1). A detailed analysis of the

198

characteristics of patients hospitalized in Houston Methodist facilities in the two

199

waves has recently been published (17).

200

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. To

201

investigate the genomic architecture of the virus across the two waves, we

202

sequenced the genomes of 5,085 SARS-CoV-2 strains dating to the earliest time

203

of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Houston. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains

204

causing disease in the first wave (March 5 through May 11) identified the

205

presence of many diverse virus genomes that, in the aggregate, represent the

206

major clades identified globally to date (Figure 1B). Clades G, GH, GR, and S

207

were the four most abundantly represented phylogenetic groups (Figure 1B).

208

Strains with the Gly614 amino acid variant in spike protein represented 82% of

209

the SARS-CoV-2 strains in wave 1, and 99.9% in wave 2 (p<0.0001; Fisher’s

210

exact test) (Figure 1B). This spike protein variant is characteristic of clades G,

211

GH, and GR. Importantly, strains with the Gly614 variant represented only 71%

212

of the specimens sequenced in March, the early part of wave 1 (Figure 1B). We

213

attribute the decrease in strains with this variant observed in the first two weeks

214

of March (Figure 1B) to fluctuation caused by the relatively fewer COVID-19

215

cases occurring during this period.

216

Relating spatiotemporal genome analysis with virus genotypes over

217

two disease waves. We examined the spatial and temporal mapping of genomic

218

data to investigate community spread during wave 1 (Figure 2). Rapid and

219

widespread community dissemination occurred soon after the initial COVID-19

220

cases were reported in Houston. The heterogenous virus genotypes present very

221

early in wave 1 indicate that multiple strains independently entered metropolitan

222

Houston, rather than introduction and spread of a single strain. An important

223

observation was that strains of most of the individual subclades were distributed

224

over broad geographic areas (Figure S1). These findings are consistent with the

225

known ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread very rapidly from person to person.

226

Relationship between virus clades, clinical characteristics of infected

227

patients, and additional metadata. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 genome

228

subtypes have different clinical characteristics, analogous to what is believed to

229

have occurred with Ebola virus (18-20) and known to occur for other pathogenic

230

microbes (21). As an initial examination of this issue in SARS-CoV-2, we tested

231

the hypothesis that patients with disease severe enough to warrant

232

hospitalization were infected with a non-random subset of virus genotypes. We

233

also examined the association between virus clades and disease severity based

234

on overall mortality, highest level of required care (intensive care unit,

235

intermediate care unit, inpatient or outpatient), need for mechanical ventilation,

236

and length of stay. There was no simple relationship between virus clades and

237

disease severity using these four indicators. Similarly, there was no simple

238

relationship between virus clades and other metadata, such as sex, age, or

239

ethnicity (Figure S2).

240
241

Machine learning analysis. Machine learning models can be used to
identify complex relationships not revealed by statistical analyses. We built

242

machine learning models to test the hypothesis that virus genome sequence can

243

predict patient outcomes including mortality, length of stay, level of care, ICU

244

admission, supplemental oxygen use, and mechanical ventilation. Models to

245

predict outcomes based on virus genome sequence alone resulted in low F1

246

scores less than 50% (0.41 – 0.49) and regression models showed similarly low

247

R2 values (-0.01 – -0.20) (Table S2). F1 scores near 50% are indicative of

248

classifiers that are performing similarly to random chance. The use of patient

249

metadata alone to predict patient outcome improved the model’s F1 scores by 5-

250

10% (0.51 – 0.56) overall. The inclusion of patient metadata with virus genome

251

sequence data improved most predictions of outcomes, compared to genome

252

sequence alone, to 50% to 55% F1 overall (0.42 – 0.55) in the models (Table

253

S2). The findings are indicative of two possibilities that are not mutually

254

exclusive. First, patient metadata, such as age and sex, may provide more signal

255

for the model to use and thus result in better accuracies. Second, the model’s

256

use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may have resulted in overfitting.

257

Most importantly, no SNP predicted a significant difference in outcome. A table of

258

classifier accuracy scores and performance information is provided in Table S2.

259

Patient outcome and metadata correlations. Overall, very few metadata

260

categories correlated with patient outcomes (Table S3). Mortality was

261

independently correlated with increasing age, with a Pearson correlation

262

coefficient (PCC) equal to 0.27. This means that 27% of the variation in mortality

263

can be predicted from patient age. Length of stay correlated independently with

264

increasing age (PCC=0.20). All other patient metadata correlations to outcomes

265

had PCC less than 0.20 (Table S3).

266

We further analyzed outcomes correlated to isolates from wave 1 and 2,

267

and the presence of the Gly614 variant in spike protein. Being in wave 1 was

268

independently correlated with mechanical ventilation days, overall length of stay,

269

and ICU length of stay, with PCC equal to 0.20, 0.18, and 0.14, respectively.

270

Importantly, the presence of the Gly614 variant did not correlate with patient

271

outcomes (Table S3).

272

Analysis of the nsp12 polymerase gene. The SARS-CoV-2 genome

273

encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, also referred to as Nsp12)

274

used in virus replication (22-25). Two amino acid substitutions (Phe479Leu and

275

Val556Leu) in RdRp each confer significant resistance in vitro to remdesivir, an

276

adenosine analog (26). Remdesivir is inserted into RNA chains by RdRp during

277

replication, resulting in premature termination of RNA synthesis and inhibition of

278

virus replication. This compound has shown prophylactic and therapeutic benefit

279

against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 experimental infection in rhesus

280

macaques (27, 28). Recent reports indicate that remdesivir has therapeutic

281

benefit in some COVID-19 hospitalized patients (29-33), leading it to be now

282

widely used in patients worldwide. Thus, it may be important to understand

283

variation in RdRp in large strain samples.

284

To acquire data about allelic variation in the nsp12 gene, we analyzed our

285

5,085 virus genomes. The analysis identified 265 SNPs, including 140

286

nonsynonymous (amino acid-altering) SNPs, resulting in amino acid

287

replacements throughout the protein (Table 1, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure S3,

288

and Figure S4). The most common amino acid change was Pro322Leu,

289

identified in 4,893 of the 5,085 (96%) patient isolates. This amino acid

290

replacement is common in genomes from clades G, GH, and GR, which are

291

distinguished from other SARS-CoV-2 clades by the presence of the Gly614

292

amino acid change in the spike protein. Most of the other amino acid changes in

293

RdRp were present in relatively small numbers of strains, and some have been

294

identified in other isolates in a publicly available database (34). Five prominent

295

exceptions included amino acid replacements: Ala15Val in 138 strains, Met462Ile

296

in 59 strains, Met600Ile in 75 strains, Thr907Ile in 45 strains, and Pro917Ser in

297

80 strains. All 75 Met600Ile strains were phylogenetically closely related

298

members of clade G, and also had the Pro322Leu amino acid replacement

299

characteristic of this clade (Figure S3). These data indicate that the Met600Ile

300

change is likely the evolved state, derived from a precursor strain with the

301

Pro322Leu replacement. Similarly, we investigated phylogenetic relationships

302

among strains with the other four amino acid changes noted above. In all cases,

303

the vast majority of strains with each amino acid replacement were found among

304

individual subclades of strains (Figure S3).

305

Importantly, none of the observed amino acid polymorphisms in RdRp

306

were located precisely at two sites known to cause in vitro resistance to

307

remdesivir (26). Most of the amino acid changes are located distantly from the

308

RNA-binding and catalytic sites (Figure S4 and Table 1). However,

309

replacements at six amino acid residues (Ala442Val, Ala448Val, Ala553Pro/Val,

310

Gly682Arg, Ser758Pro, and Cys812Phe) may potentially interfere with either

311

remdesivir binding or RNA synthesis. Four (Ala442Val, Ala448Val,

312

Ala553Pro/Val, and Gly682Arg) of the six substitution sites are located

313

immediately above the nucleotide-binding site, that is comprised of Lys544,

314

Arg552, and Arg554 residues as shown by structural studies (Figure 4). The

315

positions of these four variant amino acid sites are comparable to Val556 (Figure

316

4), for which a Val556Leu mutation in SARS-CoV was identified to confer

317

resistance to remdesivir in vitro (26). The other two substitutions (Ser758Pro and

318

Cys812Phe) are inferred to be located either at, or in the immediate proximity of,

319

the catalytic active site, that is comprised of three contiguous residues (Ser758,

320

Asp759, and Asp760). A proline substitution we identified at Ser758 (Ser758Pro)

321

is likely to negatively impact RNA synthesis. Although Cys812 is not directly

322

involved in the catalysis of RNA synthesis, it is only 3.5 Å away from Asp760.

323

The introduction of the bulkier phenylalanine substitution at Cys812 (Cys812Phe)

324

may impair RNA synthesis. Consequently, these two substitutions are expected

325

to detrimentally affect virus replication or fitness.

326

Analysis of the gene encoding the spike protein. The densely glycosylated

327

spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its close coronavirus relatives binds directly to

328

host-cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter host cells

329

(35-37). Thus, the spike protein is a major translational research target, including

330

intensive vaccine and therapeutic antibody (35-64). Analysis of the gene

331

encoding the spike protein identified 470 SNPs, including 285 that produce

332

amino acid changes (Table 2, Figure 5). Forty-nine of these replacements

339

19, 2020. Interestingly, 25 amino acid sites have three distinct variants (that is,

340

the reference amino acid plus two additional variant amino acids), and five amino

341

acid sites (amino acid positions 21, 27, 228, 936, and 1050) have four distinct

342

variants represented in our sample of 5,085 genomes (Table 2, Figure 5).

343

We mapped the location of amino acid replacements onto a model of the

344

full-length spike protein (35, 65) and observed that the substitutions are found in

345

each subunit and domain of the spike (Figure 6). However, the distribution of

346

amino acid changes is not uniform throughout the protein regions. For example,

347

compared to some other regions of the spike protein, the RBD has relatively few

348

amino acid changes, and the frequency of strains with these substitutions is low,

349

each occurring in fewer than 10 isolates. This finding is consistent with the

350

functional constraints on RBD to mediate interaction with ACE2. In contrast, the

351

periphery of the S1 subunit NTD contains a dense cluster of substituted residues,

352

with some single amino acid replacements found in 10–20 isolates (Table 2,

353

Figure 5, Figure 6). Clustering of amino acid changes in a distinct region of the

354

spike protein may be a signal of positive selection. Inasmuch as infected patients

355

make antibodies against the NTD, we favor the idea that host immune selection

356

is one force contributing to some of the amino acid variation in this region. One

357

NTD substitution, H49Y, was found in 142 isolates. This position is not well

358

exposed on the surface of the NTD and is likely not a result of immune pressure.

359

The same is true for another highly represented substitution, F1052L. This

360

substitution was observed in 167 isolates, and F1052 is buried within the core of

361

the S2 subunit. The substitution observed most frequently in the spike protein in

362

our sample is D614G, a change observed in 4,895 of the isolates. As noted

363

above, strains with the Gly614 variant significantly increased in wave 2 compared

364

to wave 1.

365

As observed with RdRp, the majority of strains with each single amino

366

acid change in the spike protein were found on a distinct phylogenetic lineage

367

(Figure S5), indicating identity by descent. A prominent exception is the

368

Leu5Phe replacement that is present in all major clades, suggesting that this

369

amino acid change arose multiple times independently or very early in the course

370

of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Finally, we note that examination of the phylogenetic

371

distribution of strains with multiple distinct amino acid replacements at the same

372

site (e.g., Arg21Ile/Lys/Thr, Ala27Ser/Thr/Val, etc.) revealed that they were

373

commonly found in different genetic branches, consistent with independent origin

374

(Figure S5).

Cycle threshold (Ct) comparison of SARS-CoV-2 strains with either

the Asp614 or Gly614 amino acid replacements in spike protein. It has been

have, on average, higher virus loads on initial diagnosis (66-70). To determine if

379

this is the case in Houston strains, we examined the cycle threshold (Ct) for

380

every sequenced strain that was detected from a patient specimen using the

381

SARS-CoV-2 Assay done by the Hologic Panther instrument. We identified a

382

significant difference (p<0.0001) between the mean Ct value for strains with an

383

Asp614 (n=102) or Gly614 (n=812) variant of the spike protein (Figure 7).

384

Strains with Gly614 had a Ct value significantly lower than strains with the

385

Asp614 variant, indicating that patients infected with the Gly614 strains had, on

386

average, higher virus loads on initial diagnosis than patients infected by strains

387

with the Asp614 variant (Figure 7). This observation is consistent with the

388

conjecture that, on average, strains with the Gly614 variant are better able to

389

disseminate.

390

Characterization of recombinant proteins with single amino acid

391

replacements in the receptor binding domain region of spike protein. The

392

RBD of spike protein binds the ACE2 surface receptor and is also targeted by

393

neutralizing (36, 37, 41, 43-46, 48-62, 71). Thus, single amino acid replacements

394

in this domain may have functional consequences that enhance virus fitness. To

395

begin to test this idea, we expressed spike variants with the Asp614Gly

396

replacement and 13 clinical RBD variants identified in our genome sequencing

397

studies (Figure 8, Table S4A, B). All RBD variants were cloned into an

398

engineered spike protein construct that stabilizes the perfusion state and

399

increases overall expression yield (spike-6P, here referred to as spike) (64).

400

We first assessed the biophysical properties of spike-Asp614Gly, an

401

amino acid polymorphism that is common globally and increased significantly in

402

our wave 2 strain isolates. Pseudotyped viruses expressing spike-Gly614 have

403

higher infectivity for host cells in vitro than spike-Asp614 (66, 67, 69, 72, 73). The

404

higher infectivity of spike-Gly614 is correlated with increased stability and

405

incorporation of the spike protein into the pseudovirion (73). We observed a

406

higher expression level (Figure 8A, B) and increased thermostability for the

407

spike protein construct containing this variant (Figure 8C, D). The size exclusion

408

chromatography (SEC) elution profile of spike-Asp614 was indistinguishable from

409

spike-Gly614, consistent with a trimeric conformation (Figure 8A). These results

410

are broadly consistent with higher-resolution structural analyses of both spike

411

variants.

412

Next, we purified and biophysically characterized 13 RBD mutants that

413

each contain Gly614 and one additional single amino acid replacement we

414

identified by genome sequencing our clinical samples (Table S4C). All variants

415

eluted as trimers, indicating the global structure, remained intact (Figure 8 and

416

Figure S6). However, several variants had reduced expression levels and

417

virtually all had decreased thermostability relative to the variant that had only a

418

D614G single amino acid replacement (Figure 8D). The A419V and A522V

419

mutations were especially deleterious, reducing yield and precluding further

420

downstream analysis (Figure 8B). We next assayed the affinity of the 11 highest-

421

expressing spike variants for ACE2 and the neutralizing monoclonal antibody

422

CR3022 via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (Figure 8E-G and

423

Table S4C). Most variants retained high affinity for the ACE2 surface receptor.

424

However, importantly, three RBD variants (F338L, S373P, and R408T) had

425

substantially reduced affinity for CR3022, a monoclonal antibody that disrupts the

426

spike protein homotrimerization interface (63, 74). Notably, the S373P mutation

427

is one amino acid away from the epitope recognized by CR3022. These results

428

are consistent with the interpretation that some RBD mutants arising in COVID-

429

19 patients may have increased ability to escape humoral immune pressure, but

430

otherwise retain strong ACE2 binding affinity.

431
432

DISCUSSION

433

In this work we analyzed the molecular population genomics, sociodemographic,

434

and medical features of two waves of COVID-19 disease occurring in

435

metropolitan Houston, Texas, between early March and early July 2020. We also

436

studied the biophysical and immunologic properties of some naturally occurring

437

single amino acid changes in the spike protein RBD identified by sequencing the

438

5,085 genomes. We discovered that the first COVID-19 wave was caused by a

439

heterogenous array of virus genotypes assigned to several different clades. The

440

majority of cases in the first wave are related to strains that caused widespread

441

disease in European and Asian countries, as well as other localities. We

442

conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was introduced into Houston many times

443

independently, likely by individuals who had traveled to or from different parts of

444

the world, including other communities in the United States. In support of this

445

conclusion, the first cases in metropolitan Houston were associated with a travel

20

446

history to a known COVID-19 region (16). The data are consistent with the fact

447

that Houston is a large international city characterized by a multi-ethnic

448

population and is a prominent transport hub with direct flights to major cities

449

globally.

450

The second wave of COVID-19 cases also is characterized by SARS-

451

CoV-2 strains with diverse genotypes. Virtually all cases in the second and

452

ongoing disease wave were caused by strains with the Gly614 variant of spike

453

protein (Figure 1B). Our data unambiguously demonstrate that strains with the

454

Gly614 variant increased significantly in frequency in wave 2 relative to wave 1 in

455

the Houston metropolitan region. This shift occurred very rapidly in a matter of

456

just a few months. Amino acid residue Asp614 is located in subdomain 2 (SD-2)

457

of the spike protein and forms a hydrogen bond and electrostatic interaction with

458

two residues in the S2 subunit of a neighboring protomer. Replacement of

459

aspartate with glycine would eliminate both interactions, thereby substantively

460

weakening the contact between the S1 and S2 subunits. We previously

461

speculated (75) that this weakening produces a more fusogenic spike protein, as

462

S1 must first dissociate from S2 before S2 can refold and mediate fusion of virus

463

and cell membranes. Stated another way, virus strains with the Gly614 variant

464

may be better able to enter host cells, potentially resulting in enhanced spread.

465

Consistent with this idea, Korber et al. (66) showed that the Gly614 variant grows

466

to higher titer as pseudotyped virions. On initial diagnosis infected individuals had

467

lower RT-PCR cycle thresholds suggesting higher upper respiratory tract viral

468

loads. Our data (Figure 7) are fully consistent with that finding Zhang et al. (73)

469

reported that pseudovirus with the 614Gly variant infected ACE2-expressing cells

470

more efficiently than the 614Asp. Similar results have been described by Hu et

471

al. (67) and Lorenzo-Redondo et al. (68). Plante et al. (76) recently studied

472

isogenic mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains with either the 614Asp or 614Gly variant

473

and found that the 614Gly variant virus had significantly increased replication in

474

human lung epithelial cells in vitro and increased infectious titers in nasal and

475

trachea washes obtained from experimentally infected hamsters. These results

476

are consistent with the idea that the 614Gly variant bestows increased virus

477

fitness in the upper respiratory tract (76).

478

Additional work is needed to investigate the potential biomedical relevance

479

and public health importance of the Asp614Gly polymorphism, including but not

480

limited to virus dissemination, overall fitness, impact on clinical course and

481

virulence, and development of vaccines and therapeutics. Although it is possible

482

that stochastic processes alone may account for the rapid increase in COVID-19

483

disease frequency caused by viruses containing the Gly614 variant, we do not

484

favor that interpretation in part because of the cumulative weight of the

485

epidemiologic, human RT-PCR diagnostics data, in vitro experimental findings,

486

and animal infection studies using isogenic mutant virus strains. In addition, if

487

stochastic processes solely are responsible, we believe it is difficult to explain

488

essentially simultaneous increase in frequency of the Gly614 variant in

489

genetically diverse viruses in three distinct clades (G, GH, and GR) in a

490

geographically large metropolitan area with 7 million ethnically diverse people.

491

Regardless, more research on this important topic is warranted.

492

The diversity present in our 1,026 virus genomes from the first disease

493

wave contrasts somewhat with data reported by Gonzalez-Reiche et al., who

494

studied 84 SARS-CoV-2 isolates causing disease in patients in the New York

495

City region (11). Those investigators concluded that the vast majority of disease

496

was caused by progeny of strains imported from Europe. Similarly, Bedford et al.

497

(10) reported that much of the COVID-19 disease in the Seattle, Washington

498

area was caused by strains that are progeny of a virus strain recently introduced

499

from China. Some aspects of our findings are similar to those reported recently

500

by Lemieux et al. based on analysis of strains causing disease in the Boston

501

area (81). Our findings, like theirs, highlight the importance of multiple

502

importation events of genetically diverse strains in the epidemiology of COVID-19

503

disease in this pandemic. Similarly, Icelandic and Brazilian investigators

504

documented that SARS-CoV-2 was imported by individuals traveling to or from

505

many European and other countries (82, 83).

506

The virus genome diversity and large sample size in our study permitted

507

us to test the hypothesis that distinct virus clades were nonrandomly associated

508

with hospitalized COVID-19 patients or disease severity. We did not find

509

evidence to support this hypothesis, but our continuing study of COVID-19 cases

510

accruing in the second wave will further improve statistical stratification.

511

We used machine learning classifiers to identify if any SNPs contribute to

512

increased infection severity or otherwise affect virus-host outcome. The models

513

could not be trained to accurately predict these outcomes from the available virus

514

genome sequence data. This may be due to sample size or class imbalance.

515

However, we do not favor this interpretation. Rather, we think that the inability to

516

identify particular virus SNPs predictive of disease severity or infection outcome

517

likely reflects the substantial heterogeneity in underlying medical conditions and

518

treatment regimens among COVID-19 patients studied herein. An alternative but

519

not mutually exclusive hypothesis is that patient genotypes play an important role

520

in determining virus-human interactions and resulting pathology. Although some

521

evidence has been presented in support of this idea (84, 85), available data

522

suggest that in the aggregate, host genetics does not play an overwhelming role

523

in determining outcome in the great majority of adult patients, once virus infection

524

is established.

525

Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog reported to have activity against

526

MERS-CoV, a coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2. Recently, several studies

527

have reported that remdesivir shows promise in treating COVID-19 patients (29-

528

33), leading the FDA to issue an emergency use authorization. Because in vitro

529

resistance of SARS-CoV to remdesivir has been reported to be caused by either

530

of two amino acid replacements in RdRp (Phe479Leu or Val556Leu), we

531

interrogated our data for polymorphisms in the nsp12 gene. Although we

532

identified 140 different inferred amino acid replacements in RdRp in the 5,085

533

genomes analyzed, none of these were located precisely at the two positions

534

associated with in vitro resistance to remdesivir. Inasmuch as remdesivir is now

535

being deployed widely to treat COVID-19 patients in Houston and elsewhere, our

536

findings suggest that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 strains currently circulating in

537

our region should be susceptible to this drug.

538

The amino acid replacements Ala442Val, Ala448Val, Ala553Pro/Val, and

539

Gly682Arg that we identified occur at sites that, intriguingly, are located directly

540

above the nucleotide substrate entry channel and nucleotide binding residues

541

Lys544, Arg552, and Arg554 (22, 23) (Figure 4). One possibility is that

542

substitution of the smaller alanine or glycine residues with the bulkier side chains

543

of Val/Pro/Arg may impose structural constraints for the modified nucleotide

544

analog to bind, and thereby disfavor remdesivir binding. This, in turn, may lead to

545

reduced incorporation of remdesivir into the nascent RNA, increased fidelity of

546

RNA synthesis, and ultimately drug resistance. A similar mechanism has been

547

proposed for a Val556Leu change (23).

548

We also identified one strain with a Lys477Asn replacement in RdRp. This

549

substitution is located close to a Phe479Leu replacement reported to produce

550

partial resistance to remdesivir in vitro in SARS-CoV patients from 2004,

551

although the amino acid positions are numbered differently in SARS-CoV and

552

SARS-CoV-2. Structural studies have suggested that this amino acid is surface-

553

exposed, and distant from known key functional elements. Our observed

554

Lys477Asn change is also located in a conserved motif described as a finger

555

domain of RdRp (Figure 3 and 4). One speculative possibility is that Lys477 is

556

involved in binding a yet unidentified cofactor such as Nsp7 or Nsp8, an

557

interaction that could modify nucleotide binding and/or fidelity at a distance.

558

These data warrant additional study in larger patient cohorts, especially in

559

individuals treated with remdesivir.

Analysis of the gene encoding the spike protein identified 285 polymorphic

561

amino acid sites relative to the reference genome, including 49 inferred amino

562

acid replacements not present in available databases as of August 19, 2020.

563

Importantly, 30 amino acid sites in the spike protein had two or three distinct

564

replacements relative to the reference strain. The occurrence of multiple variants

565

at the same amino acid site is one characteristic that may suggest functional

566

consequences. These data, coupled with structural information available for

567

spike protein, raise the possibility that some of the amino acid variants have

568

functional consequences, for example including altered serologic reactivity and

569

shown here. These data permit generation of many biomedically relevant

570

hypotheses now under study.

571

A recent study reported that RBD amino acid changes could be selected

572

in vitro using a pseudovirus neutralization assay and sera obtained from

573

convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies (86). The amino acid sites

574

included positions V445 and E484 in the RBD. Important to note, variants G446V

575

and E484Q were present in our patient samples. However, these mutations

576

retain high affinity to CR3022 (Figure 8F, G). The high-resolution structure of the

577

RBD/CR3022 complex shows that CR3022 makes contacts to residues 369-386,

578

380-392, and 427-430 of RBD (74). Although there is no overlap between

579

CR3022 and ACE2 epitopes, CR3022 is able to neutralize the virus through an

580

allosteric effect. We found that the Ser373Pro change, which is located within the

581

CR3022 epitope, has reduced affinity to CR3022 (Figure 8F, G). The F338L and

582

R408T mutations, although not found directly within the interacting epitope, also

583

display reduced binding to CR3022. Other investigators (86) using in vitro

584

antibody selection identified a change at amino acid site S151 in the N-terminal

585

domain, and we found mutations S151N and S151I in our patient samples. We

586

also note that two variant amino acids (Gly446Val and Phe456Leu) we identified

587

are located in a linear epitope found to be critical for a neutralizing monoclonal

588

antibody described recently by Li et al. (87).

589

In the aggregate, these findings suggest that mutations emerging within

590

the spike protein at positions within and proximal to known neutralization

591

epitopes may result in escape from antibodies and other therapeutics currently

592

under development. Importantly, our study did not reveal that these mutant

593

strains had disproportionately increased over time. The findings may also bear

594

on the occurrence of multiple amino acid substitutions at the same amino acid

595

site that we identified in this study, commonly a signal of selection. In the

596

aggregate, the data support a multifaceted approach to serological monitoring

597

and biologics development, including the use of monoclonal antibody cocktails

598

(46, 47, 88).

CONCLUDING STATEMENT

601

Our work represents analysis of the largest sample to date of SARS-CoV-2

602

genome sequences from patients in one metropolitan region in the United States.

603

The investigation was facilitated by the fact that we had rapidly assessed a

604

SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic test in January 2020, more than a month

605

before the first COVID-19 patient was diagnosed in Houston. In addition, our

27

606

large healthcare system has seven hospitals and many facilities (e.g., outpatient

607

care centers, emergency departments) located in geographically diverse areas of

608

the city. We also provide reference laboratory services for other healthcare

609

entities in the Houston area. Together, our facilities serve patients of diverse

610

ethnicities and socioeconomic status. Thus, the data presented here likely reflect

611

a broad overview of virus diversity causing COVID-19 infections throughout

612

metropolitan Houston. We previously exploited these features to study influenza

613

and Klebsiella pneumoniae dissemination in metropolitan Houston (89, 90). We

614

acknowledge that every “twig” of the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary tree in Houston is

615

not represented in these data. The samples studied are not comprehensive for

616

the entire metropolitan region. For example, it is possible that our strain samples

617

are not fully representative of individuals who are indigent, homeless, or of very

618

low socioeconomic groups. In addition, although the strain sample size is

619

relatively large compared to other studies, the sample represents only about 10%

620

of all COVID-19 cases in metropolitan Houston documented in the study period.

621

In addition, some patient samples contain relatively small amounts of virus

622

nucleic acid and do not yield adequate sequence data for high-quality genome

623

analysis. Thus, our data likely underestimate the extent of genome diversity

624

present among SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 and will not identify all amino

625

acid replacements in the virus in this geographic region. It will be important to

626

sequence and analyze the genomes of additional SARS-CoV-2 strains causing

627

COVID-19 cases in the ongoing second massive disease wave in metropolitan

628

Houston, and these studies are underway. Data of this type will be especially

629

important to have if a third and subsequent waves were to occur in metropolitan

630

Houston, as it could provide insight into molecular and epidemiologic events

631

contributing to them.

632

The genomes reported here are an important data resource that will

633

underpin our ongoing study of SARS-CoV-2 molecular evolution, dissemination,

634

and medical features of COVID-19 in Houston. As of August 19, 2020, there

635

were 135,866 reported cases of COVID-19 in metropolitan Houston, and the

636

number of cases is increasing daily. Although the full array of factors contributing

637

to the massive second wave in Houston is not known, it is possible that the

638

potential for increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 with the Gly614 may have

639

played a role, as well as changes in behavior associated with the Memorial Day

640

and July 4th holidays, and relaxation of some of the social constraints imposed

641

during the first wave. The availability of extensive virus genome data dating from

642

the earliest reported cases of COVID-19 in metropolitan Houston, coupled with

643

the database we have now constructed, may provide critical insights into the

644

origin of new infection spikes and waves occurring as public health constraints

645

are further relaxed, schools and colleges re-open, holidays occur, commercial air

646

travel increases, and individuals change their behavior because of COVID-19

647

“fatigue.” The genome data will also be useful in assessing ongoing molecular

648

evolution in spike and other proteins as baseline herd immunity is generated,

649

either by natural exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or by vaccination. The signal of

650

potential selection contributing to some spike protein diversity and identification

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient specimens. All specimens were obtained from individuals who

656

were registered patients at Houston Methodist hospitals, associated facilities

657

(e.g., urgent care centers), or institutions in the greater Houston metropolitan

658

region that use our laboratory services. Virtually all individuals met the criteria

659

specified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be classified as a

660

person under investigation.

661
662

SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic testing. Specimens obtained from

663

symptomatic patients with a high degree of suspicion for COVID-19 disease were

664

tested in the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at Houston Methodist Hospital

Infinity or Cepheid GeneXpert Xpress IV instruments, the SARS-CoV-2 Assay

676

using the Hologic Panther instrument, and the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay using

677

the Hologic Panther Fusion system. All assays were performed according to the

678

manufacturer’s instructions. Testing was performed on material obtained from

679

nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs immersed in universal transport media

680

(UTM), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or sputum treated with dithiothreitol (DTT).

were generated with the NexteraXT kit and NextSeq 550 instrument (Illumina).

698
699

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence analysis. Consensus virus genome

700

sequences from the Houston area isolates were generated using the ARTIC

701

nCoV-2019 bioinformatics pipeline. Publicly available genomes and metadata

702

were acquired through GISAID on August 19, 2020. GISAID sequences

703

containing greater than 1% N characters, and Houston sequences with greater

704

than 5% N characters were removed from consideration. Identical GISAID

705

sequences originating from the same geographic location with the same

706

collection date were also removed from consideration to reduce redundancy.

707

Nucleotide sequence alignments for the combined Houston and GISAID strains

708

were generated using MAFFT version 7.130b with default parameters (91).

709

Sequences were manually curated in JalView (92) to trim the ends and to

710

remove sequences containing spurious inserts. Phylogenetic trees were

711

generated using FastTree with the generalized time-reversible model for

712

nucleotide sequences (93). CLC Genomics Workbench (QIAGEN) was used to

713

generate the phylogenetic tree figures.

714
715

Geospatial mapping. The home address zip code for all SARS-CoV-2

716

positive patients was used to generate the geospatial maps. To examine

717

geographic relatedness among genetically similar isolates, geospatial maps were

718

filtered to isolates containing specific amino acid changes.

Time series. Geospatial data were filtered into wave 1 (3/5/2020-

721

5/11/2020) and wave 2 (5/12/2020-7/7/2020) time intervals to illustrate the

722

spread of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients identified over time.

723
724

Machine learning. Virus genome alignments and patient metadata were

725

used to build models to predict patient metadata and outcomes using both

726

classification models and regression. Metadata considered for prediction in the

727

classification models included age, ABO and Rh blood type, ethnic group,

728

ethnicity, sex, ICU admission, IMU admission, supplemental oxygen use, and

729

ventilator use. Metadata considered for prediction in regression analysis included

730

ICU length of stay, IMU length of stay, total length of stay, supplemental oxygen

731

use, and ventilator use. Because sex, blood type, Rh factor, age, age decade,

732

ethnicity, and ethnic group are features in the patient features and combined

733

feature sets, models were not trained for these labels using patient and

734

combined feature sets. Additionally, age, length of stay, IMU length of stay, ICU

735

length of stay, mechanical ventilation days, and supplemental oxygen days were

736

treated as regression problems and XGBoost regressors were built while the rest

737

were treated as classification problems and XGBoost classifiers were built.

738

Three types of features were considered for training the XGBoost

739

classifiers: alignment features, patient features, and the combination of alignment

740

and patient features. Alignment features were generated from the consensus

741

genome alignment such that columns containing ambiguous nucleotide bases

742

were removed to ensure the models did not learn patterns from areas of low

743

coverage. These alignments were then one-hot encoded to form the alignment

744

features. Patient metadata values were one-hot encoded with the exception of

745

age, which remained as a raw integer value, to create the patient features.

746

These metadata values consisted of age, ABO, Rh blood type, ethnic group,

747

ethnicity, and sex. All three types of feature sets were used to train models that

748

predict ICU length of stay, IMU length of stay, overall length of stay, days of

749

supplemental oxygen therapy, and days of ventilator usage while only alignment

750

features were used to train models that predict age, ABO, Rh blood type, ethnic

751

group, ethnicity, and sex.

752

A ten-fold cross validation was used to train XGBoost models (94) as

753

described previously (95, 96). Depths of 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 were used to tune

754

the models, but accuracies plateaued after a depth of 16. SciKit-Learn’s (97)

755

classification report and r2 score were then used to access overall accuracy of

756

the classification and regression models, respectively.

757
758

Patient metadata correlations. We encoded values into multiple columns

759

for each metadata field for patients if metadata was available. For example, the

760

ABO column was divided into four columns for A, B, AB, and O blood type.

761

Those columns were encoded with a 1 for the patients’ ABO type, with all other

762

columns encoded with 0. This was repeated for all non-outcome metadata fields.

763

Age, however, was not re-encoded, as the raw integer values were used. Each

764

column was then correlated to the various outcome values for each patient

766

and ventilator length) to obtain a Pearson coefficient correlation value for each

767

metadata label and outcome.

768
769

Analysis of the nsp12 polymerase and S protein genes. The nsp12

770

virus polymerase and S protein genes were analyzed by plotting SNP density in

771

the consensus alignment using Python (Python v3.4.3, Biopython Package

772

v1.72). The frequency of SNPs in the Houston isolates was assessed, along with

773

amino acid changes for nonsynonymous SNPs.

775

Cycle threshold (Ct) comparison of SARS-CoV-2 strains with either

776

Asp614 or Gly614 amino acid replacements in the spike protein. The cycle

threshold (Ct) for every sequenced strain that was detected from a patient

778

specimen using the SARS-CoV-2 Assay on the Hologic Panther instrument was

FreeStyle 293-F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were cultured and

791

maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 37°C and 8% CO2 while shaking at

792

110-125rpm. Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding spike protein

793

variants using polyethylenimine. Three hours post-transfection, 5μM kifunensine

794

was added to each culture. Cells were harvested four days after transfection and

795

the protein containing supernatant was separated from the cells by two

796

centrifugation steps: 10 min at 500rcf and 20 min at 10,000rcf. Supernatants

797

were kept at 4°C throughout. Clarified supernatant was loaded on a Poly-Prep

798

chromatography column (Bio-Rad) containing Strep-Tactin Superflow resin (IBA),

799

washed with five column volumes (CV) of wash buffer (100mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,

800

150mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA), and eluted with four CV of elution buffer (100mM

801

Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 2.5mM d-Desthiobiotin). The eluate

802

was spin-concentrated (Amicon Ultra-15) to 600μL and further purified via size-

803

exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column

804

(G.E.) in SEC buffer (2mM Tris pH 8.0, 200mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3). Proteins

805

were concentrated to 300μL and stored in SEC buffer.

The RBD spike mutants chosen for analysis were all RBD amino acid

807

mutants identified by our genome sequencing study as of June 15, 2020. We
