Abstract
Starting in December 2020, a sharp increase of COVID-19 cases occurred in Tenerife
compared to the rest of the Canary Islands (Spain). Because of the direct touristic connections
between Tenerife and the UK, and the rapid transmission and dominance of the SARS-CoV-2
B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC-202012/01) by the end of November 2020 in South
England, here we measured the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases occurring between the 18th of
December 2020 and the 25th of February 2021. Out of the 2,091 COVID-19 positive
nasopharyngeal swab samples assessed, 226 showed a spike gene target failure (SGTF).
Subsequent viral genome sequencing further confirmed that 93.2% of them corresponded to
the B.1.1.7 lineage. Furthermore, a rapid increase in the proportion of SGTF variants was
detected in up to 10.7% of positive cases during the Christmas season despite stricter
measures for containing the transmission were imposed in Tenerife in the period. These
results support the local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage in Tenerife since late
December 2020 although it is not yet dominant.
Keywords: B.1.1.7; 20I/501Y.V1; genomic surveillance; spike mutations; SGTF.
Introduction
Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) is one of the top destinations for UK travelers all year long
and was an air corridor until late 2020 (Department for Transport and Foreign,
Commonwealth & Development Office 2020) as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
had <50 cases of accumulated incidence per 100,000 inhabitants in the last 14 days (AI14)
until late September, retaining one of the lowest case levels among all Spanish communities
since the decrease of the first wave during April 2020 (Ministerio de Sanidad 2020). Starting
in December 2020, Tenerife faced an unexplained rapid increase of COVID-19 cases
compared to the rest of the Archipelago as AI14 jumped from <130 cases between August
and late November 2020 to 248 cases by the 23rd of December 2020
(https://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/principal/coronavirus/acceso_datos.html). As a
consequence, the authorities imposed border restrictions and recommended limiting the
mobility between municipalities from the 19th of December 2020 until the 2nd of January
2021.
The emergence of novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) variants is generating widespread concern, as they harbor a constellation of mutations
that might lead to increased transmissibility (Kirby 2021) and/or immune evasion from
previous infection or vaccination (Wu et al. 2021). In particular, the lineage B.1.1.7 (variant
of concern [VOC]-202012/01 according to Public Health England; also known as clade
20I/501Y.V1), firstly identified in the UK in December 2020 (O’Toole et al. 2021), has
rapidly spread worldwide, with 82 countries reporting its detection by the 15th of February
(https://cov-lineages.org/global_report_B.1.1.7.html). By mid-January 2021, this VOC had an
accumulated prevalence over 76% among all UK sequences despite restrictions in many of
the affected areas (O’Toole et al. 2021). Among the mutations characterizing this lineage,
nine are found in the spike (S) protein gene compared to the reference genome (SARS-CoV-2
isolate Wuhan-Hu-1; GenBank accession MN908947). Within these, the deletion of the
21765-21770 genome region that predicts the loss of the amino acids 69 and 70 (Δ69/70) in

the S protein has been associated with a “Spike gene target failure” (SGTF) for two
commercial RT-qPCR kits for COVID-19 diagnosis (Public Health England 2020; FDA
COVID-19 Update, 2021). While this characteristic is an imperfect proxy, it has helped
tracking the rapid emergence of the B.1.1.7 lineage around the world (Washington et al.
2020). Here we aimed to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage cases in Tenerife
beginning in mid-December 2020 by leveraging the SGTF during the RT-qPCR followed by
viral genome sequencing of the prioritized samples.
Materials and Methods
The study was conducted at the University Hospital Nuestra Señora de Candelaria (Santa
Cruz de Tenerife, Spain). We assessed nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2
patients corresponding to independent outbreaks declared from 18th of December 2020 to 25th
of February 2021. Routine COVID-19 testing in the center was conducted using diverse
commercial RT-qPCR alternatives, as described elsewhere (Alcoba-Florez et al. 2020).
We used the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to monitor
the drop out in the S viral gene (one of the three gene targets of the kit) in the COVID-19
positive patients. This SGTF has been suggested to occur by the presence of the Δ69/70
deletion (FDA COVID-19 Update, 2021) that is known to have arisen in multiple lineages
(Davies et al. 2021). We used this assay to assess all RNA extracts (Zymo Quick DNA/RNA
kit, Zymo) from COVID-19 positives in the period as an imperfect proxy of the incidence of
the B.1.1.7 lineage in the population, resulting in a reassessment of a total of 2,091 positive
samples in the period. Thermocycling was conducted on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) following manufacturers recommendations.
Samples were selected for sequencing if they showed a cycle threshold (Ct)<30 for
any of the targets included in the COVID-19 diagnosis kits and were categorized as SGTF.
The libraries were obtained using the COVIDSeq Test (Illumina, Inc.), with a proven high
reproducibility and a sensitivity comparable to that of RT-qPCR assays (Bhoyar et al. 2021),
covering the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome with 98 amplicons and including internal controls
consisting of 11 human mRNA targets. The procedure followed the manufacturers
recommendations and quality control steps. Sequencing was conducted on a NextSeq 550
(Illumina) instrument on High Output mode with 36 bp single end reads at the Instituto
Tecnológico y de Energías Renovables (Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain).
Per sample consensus sequences and variants against the reference (NC_045512.2)
were obtained based on the DRAGEN COVIDSeq Test v1.2.2 pipeline (Illumina, Inc.).
Positive and negative amplification controls were included in each run. To be able to recover
the FASTA sequences that were not automatically provided by DRAGEN COVIDSeq Test,
the fastq files were reprocessed with DRAGEN Lineage v3.5.0 with the following
specifications: coverage threshold of 20, virus detection threshold of 5, virus negative
threshold of 5, and a human control threshold of 3. Phylogenetic Assignment of named
Global Outbreak LINeages (PANGOLIN) software suite v2.1.7 (https://github.com/covlineages/pangolin) was then used for lineage and clade classification following the
nomenclature of Rambaut et al. (2020). Nextclade v.0.12.0 (Hadfield et al., 2018) was used
for variant calling and functional predictions.

The AI14 data was retrieved from the COVID-19 data hub from Gobierno de
Canarias (https://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/principal/coronavirus/acceso_datos.html;
accessed March 6th, 2021).
Results
We closely followed SGTF of the SARS-CoV-2 samples in Tenerife in the period of 2
months (18th of December 2020 to 25th of February 2021). A total of 2,091 COVID-19
positive samples were assessed in the period, resulting in 226 SGTF samples identified and
reaching a maximum of 10.7% at the end of the period under study. Remarkably, we detected
a rapid increase in the prevalence of SGTF over this period, rising sharply during the
Christmas season and steadily after December 28th, 2020 (Figure 1).
We were able to sequence 147 (mean depth of coverage ± SD: 48X ± 9) out of the
226 SGTF samples in the period. The sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 with SGTF were
assigned to five different lineages where B.1.1.7 (VOC-202012/01) was the predominant
(93.2%). Eleven of these had lower sequence quality (according to the quality control
assessment carried out by Nextclade based on the aggregation of four metrics: missing data,
mixed sites, private mutations, mutation clusters) and were not included in downstream
analysis. Among those classified as B.1.1.7 lineage, the sequences carried between nine and
17 of the lineage-defining mutations (Davies et al. 2021), with 93.4% of the sequences
including ≥15 (Figure 2). Other lineages that were linked to the SGTF in this study were
classified as B.1.258 (5), B.1.177 (3), B.1.221 (1), and B.1.1.222 (1).
Discussion
Based on RT-qPCR SGTF and viral genome sequencing, this study supports the local
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage in Tenerife since late December 2020. Despite
vaccination campaign started in Spain on the 27th of December 2020 and given that it has not
reached a large fraction of the population yet, the possibility that the B.1.1.7 lineage is also
responsible for increased transmission in the rest of the Archipelago is high. Thus, a denser
analysis is likely to detect further spread of the B.1.1.7 lineage across the Canary Islands,
especially if sampling is conducted after the 12th of February 2021 when the mobility
increased again in all islands except for the island of Lanzarote.
Our observations for the island of Tenerife support that B.1.1.7 is not yet dominant as
th
of 25 of February 2021. Although neglecting a protective effect from vaccination, the
models for some major cities in Europe indicate that the B.1.1.7 lineage will be the dominant
(>50% of positives) by mid-March 2021 even if accounting for non-pharmaceutical
interventions (Gozzi et al. 2021). Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage could be
dominant also in Tenerife during the first half of 2021.
We anticipate that the data reported here should be taken as an underestimate as there
will be genomes of the B.1.1.7 lineage that escape detection by RT-qPCR SGTF. We also
assume that there is potential that some of the samples may derive from non-resident travelers
that could have introduced an upward bias in the estimated AI14.
