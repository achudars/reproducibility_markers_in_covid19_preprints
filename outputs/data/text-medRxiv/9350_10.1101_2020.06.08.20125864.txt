Abstract

11

Access to safe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services have been recognized as a highly

12

precautionary measure essential to protecting human health during this COVID-19 outbreak.

13

However, it is currently unknown whether poor or non- availability of these services are also closely

14

related to COVID-19 fatalities. We analysed the latest data on COVID-19 fatality rates in Sub Saharan

15

Africa with indicators of safe water and sanitation governance to test this hypothesis. We found a

16

strong correlation between a higher case fatality rate and poorer access to safe drinking water as

17

well as safe sanitation. The Pearson correlation is stronger for access to safe sanitation ( -0.30)

18

compared to access to safe drinking water (-0.20). The Chad, Niger and Sierra Leone were amongst

19

the countries with the highest fatality rates (>6.0) and also had particularly poor access to safe

20

drinking water (<34%) and safe sanitation (<22%). The hypothesis of an association between COVID-

21

19 fatalities and poor

22

analysis does not establish causality. Given the increase spread of COVID-19 and related deaths, this

23

analysis serves as an important reminder that safe water and sanitation services are key for public

24

health interventions and highlights the need to prioritise this sector in all economies.

access to water and sanitation was confirmed by this study. However, our

Introduction

26

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading across countries and within countries. It is estimated

27

that up to 70% of a population are likely to be infected with the coronavirus disease [1]. As of May

28

22, 2020, almost 334 173 people had died globally with the USA recording 96354 deaths [2]. While

29

COVID-19 poses a massive crisis in the West, including deaths and the economic downturn, the

30

nature of essential service provision in the global South presents some

31

to its spread and potential fatalities. For instance, ensuring good and consistent provision of safe

32

water, sanitation, and hygienic services, such as regular water supply, availability of hand washing

33

facilities, good WASH systems in health care facilities as well as good sanitation practices are

34

essential to protecting human health during this COVID-19 outbreak [3] . Although the above

35

highlighted measures are vital to keep up the fight against the spread of COVID-19, can the non-

36

availability of these services be linked to potential COVID-19 deaths?

37

Considering the stark inequalities in water and sanitation provision, increased vulnerability and

38

fragility of WASH infrastructure in most of the global South, we ask; “Are

39

poor access to safe water and sanitation services more vulnerable to COVID-19 fatalities?”.

40

Currently, COVID-19 deaths have been associated with mortality conditions such as cardiovascular

41

disease, diabetes, and hypertension etc and are more pronounced among the aged [4]. Yet, there is

42

no empirical evidence on the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and access to water and

43

sanitation.

44

Drawing on COVID-19 cases in Sub-Saharan Africa, we explored the hypothesis that;

45

access to water and sanitation services are likely to increase potential COVID-19 deaths. It is our

46

hope that findings from this analysis will provide information to the global community about

47

predicting the conditions of COVID-19 and access to safe water and sanitation. This will also feed

48

into ongoing WASH interventions by most global South governments towards the fight against

49

COVID-19 and other pandemics.

Methods

52

To test this hypothesis, we obtained the latest data on COVID-19 fatalities from Our World in Data

53

[5] and merged with some of the indicators present in the quality of governance dataset from

54

Teorell et al. (2018) [6]. Among others, the Teorell et al’s [6] dataset contains the definition of ‘safe’

55

access to water and sanitation from the Environmental Performance Index of Hsu et al. [7].

56

Compared to the World Development Indicators’ notion of ‘improved’ access, ‘safe’ access is a more

57

rigorous definition as water quality assessments also rest on the assumption that ’improved’ water

58

supplies are safe, but a significant amount of water supplies that meet the definition of an

59

’improved’ source still do not meet WHO guidelines, e.g. water supplied through pipes may be

60

contaminated, and groundwater may also be contaminated by faulty latrines, or the treatment of

61

the water is inadequate. Sub- Saharan Africa was chosen to test this hypothesis because; (i)First, the

62

region is the poorest including access to water and sanitation services [8]. It is estimated that of the

63

783 million people who are without access to clean water, 40% live in Sub-Saharan Africa and more

64

than 320 million people lack access to safe drinking water [9] (ii) Secondly, an estimated 70% to

65

80% of the regions diseases are attributable to poor water quality [10] and (iii)lastly, the subsample

66

of countries is relatively homogenous across many variables that potentially drive fatality rates,

67

apart from access to safe sanitation and drinking. Univariate (Pearson correlation) analysis was

68

conducted to test the hypothesis using R-studio.

Results

71

Figure 1 and 2 summarises the relationship between case fatality rates and access to safe water and

72

sanitation. A quick analysis illustrates a strong correlation between a higher case fatality rate and

73

poorer access to safe drinking water as well as safe sanitation (see Figures below). South Africa has,

as of May 20th, reported the highest fatalities (302), followed by Nigeria (192). The correlation is

75

stronger for access to safe sanitation with a Pearson correlation test yielding -0.30 compared to -

76

0.20 for access to safe drinking water, which is intuitive. The Chad, Niger and Sierra Leone are

77

amongst the countries with the highest fatality rates (>6.0) and also have particularly poor access to

78

safe drinking water (<34%), safe sanitation (<22%). Appendix A and B provide an interactive version

Discussion and conclusion

87

The hypothesis of an association between COVID-19 fatalities and poor

88

sanitation

89

is associated with the high percentage of poor access to safe sanitation and drinking water. This is

90

consistent with the observation that handwashing with soap and water are protective measures

91

against increased mortality rates during a crisis impacting most vulnerable populations. While other

92

factors, such as median age, the quality of health services, the resiliency of an economy and above

93

all, the scale of testing and reporting drives the number of fatalities, the sub-Saharan cluster of

access

to

water

and

is confirmed by the results. The above-mentioned analysis show that the case fatality rate

94

countries poses an arguably homogenous sample across many of these variables, with relatively

95

young populations, and comparably poor health services and likely undertesting. The fact that we

96

found such strong correlations between the total COVID-19 fatality rate and access to safe drinking

97

water and safe sanitation is a strong indicator of the pivotal role that basic access to these services

98

plays on an everyday basis. Most often too, WASH services are lacking even in the places where

99

people go to seek treatment. With 57.5% of the Sub Saharan African population being

100

multidimensionally poor and 492 million of them deprived of water [8] people are likely more

101

exposed and vulnerable to the risks (such

102

correlation is therefore plausible given that unsafe sanitation is responsible for 775,000 deaths each

103

year and is the leading risk factor for infectious diseases [11]. This finding underscores the

104

improvements that ought to be made in terms of equitable and safe services, only then can the

105

overall disease burden be sustainably reduced, and the potential deaths associated with WASH be

106

prevented.

107

We are not by anyway suggesting that our analysis is robust (as it cannot establish causality between

108

existing COVID-19 deaths and poor water and sanitation services) nor insinuate that Sub-Saharan

109

African countries may inevitably experience apocalypse as a result of the virus outbreak. However,

110

we are using the trend in this brief analysis as a reminder of the importance of safe and improved

111

WASH services not just for the fight against pandemics but in our daily lives. Apart from preventing

112

potential deaths, many co-benefits will be realized by providing safely managed water and sanitation

113

services and applying good hygiene practices. Times have changed and the current WASH responses

114

for COVID-19 can be a turning point in alleviating the inequalities and poverty that characterise the

115

water and sanitation sector. However, this demands bold policies and actions by all actors

116

(governments, World agencies, utilities etc). COVID-19 is likely to hit the fragile economies in the

117

global South harder and it is our hope that it forces countries to rapidly readjust their resiliency and

118

emergency planning particularly for the water and sanitation sector. Although many national

119

governments are shifting policies and keeping WASH priorities through the lens of COVID-19,

120

adopting blended finance, digital water solutions and establishing low-income WASH response

121

institutions will be useful for all [12]. Whilst our study focused on Sub-Saharan Africa, further studies

122

can draw on additional data and other covariates to explore other key determinants more in-depth.

123

In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that poor access to safe drinking water and

124

sanitation appeared to have an association with COVID-19 fatalities. Although our evidence does not

125

establish causality, it specifically highlights the need for strong policies supporting WASH

126

interventions, prioritising low and marginal populations in both developing and developed countries.

127

It is critical for countries to understand that increasing safe water and sanitation services especially

128

to the unreached will lead to better and healthier populations. Work presented here underscores

129

the importance of all countries sector-specific response plans to prioritise WASH because a

130

crisis is a health crisis.
