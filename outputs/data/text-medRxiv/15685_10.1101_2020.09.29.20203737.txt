Abstract

49

Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at particular risk to acquire SARS-CoV-2

50

infections.

51

Aim: The objectives of this study were to compare SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence and

52

compliance to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) between HCWs working within

53

(high-risk) or outside (intermediate-risk) units treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19

54

patients. In addition, administration staff (low-risk) was included.

55

Materials: Co-HCW is a prospective cohort study among employees at the Jena University

56

Hospital, Germany. Since 16th March 2020, 50 SARS-CoV-2 inpatients and 73 outpatients

57

were treated in our hospital. Mandatory masking was implemented on 20th March 2020. We

58

here evaluated seroprevalence using two IgG detecting immunoassays, assessed COVID-19

59

exposure, clinical symptoms and compliance to wear PPE.

60

Findings: Between 19th May and 19th June 2020 we analysed 660 employees [out of 3,228;

61

20.4%]. Eighteen participants (2.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least one

62

immunoassay. Among them, 13 (72.2%) were not aware of direct COVID-19 exposure and 9

63

(50.0%) did not report any clinical symptoms. We observed no evidence for an association

64

between seroprevalence and risk area (high-risk: 2 of 137 HCWs (1.5%), intermediate-risk:

65

10 of 343 HCWs (2.9%), low-risk: 6 of 180 administration employees (3.3%); p=0.574).

66

Reported compliance to wear PPE differed (p<0.001) between working in high-risk (98.3%)

67

and in intermediate-risk areas (69.8%).

68

Conclusion: No evidence for higher seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs working

69

in high-risk COVID-19 areas could be observed, probably due to high compliance to wear

70

PPE. Compared to administration employees, we observed no additional risk to acquire

71

SARS-CoV-2 infections by patient care.

Introduction

73

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel beta coronavirus

74

that was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1, 2]. As of the beginning of 2020

75

the outbreak progressed and has been characterized as a pandemic in March 2020 [3, 4].

76

The clinical presentation of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, corona virus disease 2019

77

(COVID-19) [4], varies significantly and ranges from asymptomatic and mild to critical courses

78

[5-7]. As asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients can spread the virus [8-11], it is

79

challenging to timely identify and isolate respective cases. Due to the pandemic the disease

80

and

81

(https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases).

82

2020, there were more than 1.3 Mio healthcare workers (HCWs) who have been tested

83

positive for SARS-CoV-2 worldwide [12].

84

SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible from human to human mainly via inhalation of infectious

85

respiratory droplets but also via close personal contact (shaking hands) and via touching

86

contaminated surfaces [2, 13]. As a consequence, nosocomial transmission of insufficiently

87

protected HCWs can occur during aerosol generating procedures [13-14], in the regular

88

patient contact particularly when exposed to patients with a delayed diagnosis of COVID-19

89

and also in close contact with asymptomatic but virus carrying colleagues [15-19]. Hence, it is

90

of great importance to implement infection prevention programs and provide HCWs with

91

sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) in order to reduce nosocomial transmissions

92

[20]. Further reason for HCWs to be tested positive for COVID-19 is community transmission

93

in particular due to local outbreaks [21], and infectious returning travelers [2]. On 11th March

94

2020, the first COVID-19 cases were detected in the city of Jena, Germany. Only five days

95

later, a HCW returning from skiing in Austria caused the first nosocomial outbreak at the Jena

96

University Hospital (JUH) that involved further 31 newly confirmed SARS CoV-2 infections

97

until 19th March.

98

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection by

99

testing for SARS CoV-2 IgG antibodies among employees of JUH with and without patient

100

contact. Secondary objectives were to compare seroprevalence rates between employees

101

working at different COVID-19 risk areas according to working place and to provide insight

102

into the effectiveness of and compliance with the use of PPE.

were hospitalized and additional 73 SARS-CoV-2 positive outpatients were seen at the

110

emergency department (valid at 8th June 2020). Due to the increasing number of SARS-CoV-

111

2 cases (in Jena and at JUH), mandatory masking for all employees at JUH was implemented

112

on 20 March 2020. Research was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki

113

and national and institutional standards. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics

114

committee of the Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena (approval no. 2020-1774) and the study

115

was registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00022432).

Enrolment and data management

118

Participants were recruited between 19 May 2020 and 19 June 2020. All employees of JUH

119

working at predefined areas with (HCWs) and without patient contact (administration

120

employees) (as provided in Supplementary Table 1) were eligible for inclusion. Eligible staff

121

members received information on the planned study per e-mail and/or were directly informed

122

per an on-site visit. Participation was voluntary. Employees were included if they signed a

123

written informed consent form, answered a questionnaire (see below) and agreed on

124

providing a blood sample (not exceeding 9 ml of venous blood).

125

Individuals working outside the precategorized risk areas (namely lab personal where at least

126

a proportion deals with COVID-19 related clinical specimens but has no patient contact) or

127

participating outside the planned study period were excluded.

128

After pseudonymization at the study center, blood samples were sent to the Department of

129

Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (JUH) and the Institute of Medical Microbiology

130

(JUH) for testing of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by two different immunoassays (see

131

below).

132

Pseudonymized questionnaires were digitalized with support of data management of the

133

Institute of General Practice and Family Medicine (JUH). After digitalization, the whole data

134

set was checked for plausibility and obvious errors were corrected.

Questionnaire

137

The questionnaire included questions on demographics, working area, individual exposure to

138

confirmed COVID-19 cases, return from COVID-19 risk areas since February 2020, results of

139

previous polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serology test for COVID-19, clinical symptoms

140

within the last two months such as cold-like symptoms, diarrhea, taste disturbances and smell

141

disorders. The severity of respiratory symptoms, included in the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory

142

Symptom Survey (WURSS-24), was asked. WURSS-24 is identical to the WURSS-21 [22],

143

except for the addition of the items assessing headache, body ache and fever.

144

To evaluate the risk for nosocomial transmissions, HCWs with an individual face-to-face

145

contact within 1 meter with a confirmed COVID-19 patient or at least with its surroundings

146

received an extended questionnaire that also included questions on the compliance

147

concerning use of personal protective equipment (PPE) as recently published by the WHO

SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing

152

Presence of SARS CoV-2 antibodies was investigated by two different commercially available

153

IgG detecting immunoassays: an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay EDI Novel

154

Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Epitope Diagnostics Inc., San Diego, USA) and a

155

chemiluminescence-based

156

Switzerland). Both assays target recombinant nucleocapsid protein and were carried out

157

according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Sensitivities and specificities as provided by the

158

manufacturers are high for both tests (≥98%). In case of two corresponding negative test

159

results by both immunoassays, the participant was regarded as SARS-CoV-2 seronegative.

160

Volunteers with at least one positive test result were regarded as SARS-CoV-2 seropositive.

161

In case of a “borderline” test result for EDI IgG ELISA and a negative Elecsys Roche test, the

162

test persons was neither classified as SARS-CoV-2 seropositive nor seronegative.

163

Re-testing was offered to all participants with a divergent result of both immunoassays.

Outcomes and further definitions

166

The primary outcome of the study was to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2

167

antibodies in employees using two IgG detecting immunoassays. Secondary outcomes were

168

(i) seroprevalence rates stratified by their risk of COVID-19 exposure during work (see below

169

for definition of COVID-19 risk areas), (ii) potential risk factors and clinical symptoms for

170

seropositive employees and (iii) compliance of HCWs in high-risk and intermediate-risk areas

171

to wear PPE in case of an individual reported contact with a confirmed COVID-19 positive

172

patient or its surroundings.

173

We classified employees in three groups according to their risk of a contact with COVID-19

174

patients: low, intermediate and high risk. The low-risk group included employees working in

175

the administration without patient contact. The intermediate-risk group had regular patient

176

contact but did not routinely treat patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2

177

infections. The high-risk group included HCWs working at areas with confirmed COVID-19

178

patients and areas that deal with a high number of suspected COVID-19 cases (see

179

Supplementary Table 1).

180
181

Sample size considerations

182

As previous data on SARS CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence rates of HCWs in Germany were

183

sparse [23], our intention was to conduct an exploratory study focussing on the precision of

184

the prevalence estimate in the defined exposure groups (i.e. the group comparisons by

185

hypothesis test was not the primary objective). Thus, we assumed a true prevalence of 5%.

186

150 employees per group should be targeted to get 95% confidence intervals (for the

187

proportion) with a precision (half width of confidence interval) of about 3.5%.

Statistical analysis

189

Characteristics of participants are summarized (overall, stratified by test result) as absolute

190

and relative frequencies or as median together with first and third quartile (Q1, Q3).

191

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in employees are described with absolute and relative

192

frequencies together with 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals (CIs). To compare

193

seroprevalence rates between participants working at different COVID-19 risk areas, to

194

analyze clinical symptoms and to identify potential risk factors for seropositive compared to

195

seronegative participants, we apply univariable logistic regression modelling with the

196

seropositivity as dependent variable and the investigated factor as independent variable. We

197

provide odds ratios (OR) together with 95% CI. Compliance of HCWs (in high and

198

intermediate-risk areas) to wear PPE is assessed with Fisher exact test. We compare those

199

HCWs who stated to always or mostly wear PPE to those who stated not to wear PPE or did

200

not provide information on this issue.

201

We applied a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and did not correct for multiple testing as all

202

analyses were considered exploratory. Clopper-Pearson CIs were calculated with Microsoft

203

Excel 2016. All other analyses were done with SPSS Statistics version 25.0 for Windows

204

(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

206

Characteristics of the study population

207

We identified 3,228 employees who were eligible for study inclusion. Among them, 721

208

participants (22.3%) were included, and 660 of 721 participants (91.5%) could be analysed

209

(see Figure 1). Of the 660 analysed participants, 174 (26.4%) were males and 486 (73.6%)

210

were females. The median age of the participants was 40.5 (Q1-Q3: 32.0-49.0) years. The

211

most common professions involved included nurses (n=215, 32.6%), followed by

212

administration staff (n=180, 27.3%) and medical doctors (n=103, 15.6%), nursing assistants

213

(n=18; 2.7%), psychologists (n=18; 2.7%) and ergo therapists (n=17; 2.6%). Two-hundred six

214

employees (31.2%) reported direct exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case. Among 198

215

employees with direct COVID-19 contact at work, 12 participants (6.1%) reported contact to a

216

SARS-CoV-2 positive colleague. Direct COVID-19 contact outside the JUH included

217

household contacts (n=4), patient contacts at other health care facilities (n=6), in the

218

ambulance (n=5) or at a home visit (n=1), direct contact in town (n=2), at vacation (n=1) or

219

with a former employee (n=1). Further details on the participants are provided in Table 1.

220
221

Seroprevalence, infection status and previous testing for COVID-19

222

Among the 660 participants, 627 (95.0%) were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG

223

antibodies by both immunoassays. Two participants (0.3%) were tested positive by Elecsys

224

Roche and EDI IgG ELISA and 16 participants (2.4%) were only tested positive by EDI IgG

225

ELISA. Fifteen participants had a “borderline” result for EDI IgG ELISA. Hence, 18 employees

226

(2.7%, 95% CI 1.6%-4.3%), 12 HCWs (2.5% within the group HCWs, 95% CI 1.3%-4.3%) and

227

6 administration employees (3.3% within the group administration employees, 95% CI 1.2%-

228

7.1%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in at least one immunoassay. When

229

considering also previously reported PCR and serology results, cumulative SARS-CoV-2

230

infection rate in our participants was 3.2% (95% CI 2.0%-4.8%).

231

Among the 18 employees with detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, only 9 (50.0%)

232

reported clinical symptoms within the last two months (see Table 2).

233
234

Follow-up of discrepant immunoassay results

235

Thirteen of 15 participants (86.7%) with a “borderline“ test result for EDI IgG ELISA and 12 of

236

16 participants (75.0%) with a positive result for EDI IgG ELISA but negative Elecsys Roche

237

test were retested after 1-2 months. All employees with a previous “borderline“ test result for

238

EDI IgG ELISA became negative in the retest. For clinical symptoms in this group, we refer to

239

Supplementary Table 2. Three of 12 employees (25.0%) with a previous positive test result

240

for EDI IgG ELISA but negative Elecsys Roche test had unchanged test results 1-2 months

241

later, whereas 9 of 12 employees (75.0%) became negative in the retest. All 3 participants (2

242

HCWs and 1 administration employee) with a persistent positive test result for EDI IgG ELISA

243

but negative Elecsys Roche test did not report any clinical symptoms.

244

Potential risk factors and clinical symptoms for antibody positivity of employees

245

As shown in Table 1, we did not observe evidence for an association of antibody positivity

246

with the demographics, the professions or COVID-19 risk area (all p-values from logistic

247

regression >0.05). The two persons who were tested positive by both immunoassays were

248

administration employees. The only parameters that were associated with SARS-CoV-2

249

seropositivity in employees included close COVID-19 contact at home (OR 39.06, 95% CI

250

5.17 to 295.00), taste disturbances (OR 12.94, 95% CI 2.42 to 69.10) and smell disorders

251

(OR 5.90, 95% CI 1.23 to 28.36).

252
253

Compliance to wear PPE in case of a individual contact with a COVID-19 positive

254

patient and/or its surroundings

255

Reported compliance to wear PPE was associated with the COVID-19 risk area according to

256

the working place (p<0.001). Compliance of HCWs working in COVID-19 high-risk was 98.3%

257

(yes: n=114; no: n=2) and in intermediate-risk areas 69.8% (yes: n=62, most time: n=5, no:

258

n=21, no answer given: n=8). Detailed information on compliance to wear different items of

259

PPE and different circumstances is given in Figure 2.

260

A single HCW reported a puncture/sharp accident with material contaminated with biological

261

fluid/respiratory secretions during a healthcare interaction with a COVID-19 patient. This

262

HCW remained seronegative.

263

Discussion

264

Altogether, seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was low in the investigated group (2.7%).

265

Even when we also considered reported previous PCR and serology results, the cumulative

266

SARS-CoV-2 infection rate remained below the expected 5% derived from reports of a similar

267

University hospital in Münster, Germany [23]. Higher seroprevalence rates among frontline

268

healthcare personnel were reported by recent studies outside Germany (ranging from 4.0% to

269

9.0%) [24-26].

270

Among 660 tested employees of JUH, we did not detect an association between

271

seroprevalence and risk area according to their workplace. Contrary, HCWs working at

272

COVID-19 high-risk areas had the numerically lowest (1.5%) and employees without any

273

patient contact had the numerically highest seroprevalence rates (3.3%).

274

We found an association between seroprevalence rates and a reported individual exposure to

275

a SARS-CoV-2 positive household contact. Similarly, Luo et al. who evaluated the risk for

276

transmission in 3,410 close contacts of COVID-19 patients identified household contact as

277

the main setting for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (10.3%) [27]. Community acquisition is

hence a major aspect that needs to be considered.

279

In the present study, HCWs in the high-risk group reported a remarkable compliance of

280

98.2% regarding PPE administration whereas compliance in the intermediate-risk group was

281

significantly lower with 69.8%. Consequent use of PPE is an effective measure to minimise

282

the risk of infection [20, 24]. We assume that the awareness regarding personal protection

283

was higher in those HCWs who are repeatedly exposed to COVID-19 patients. An increased

284

awareness might lead to better adherence to other hygienic measurements as well [28]. In

285

addition, a daily routine in PPE use improves correct donning and doffing and thus, reduces

286

the risk of contamination. The results of the study support the importance of adequate PPE

287

use to prevent transmission from patient to HCW. Additionally, mandatory masking might

288

have reduced nosocomial transmissions also in employees without patient contact. However,

289

compliance to mandatory masking during working hours was not evaluated in our study.

290

According to Wang et al., implementation of mandatory masking of HCWs and patients can

291

be effective to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection rates [29]. In a recently published report by Self

292

et al. that included 3,248 frontline HCWs, seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was

293

lower among HCWs who reported always wearing a face covering while caring for patients

294

compared to those who did not (6% versus 9%) [24].

295

It is known, that pre- and asymptomatic COVID-19 infected persons can be contagious

296

despite absence of any subjective feeling of illness. In a population-based study by

297

Gudbjartsson et al. including 30,576 people from Iceland, nearly one third of the SARS-CoV-2

298

infections were asymptomatic and durability of SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels was over 4

299

months [30]. In our study population, only 50% of those tested positive reported any clinical

300

symptoms, but the presence of taste disturbances or smell disorders were both associated

301

with seropositivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Similarly, the authors Iversen et al. identified loss of

302

smell or taste as the symptom that was most strongly associated with seropositivity in HCWs

303

in Denmark [26]. In a complete cohort study following up a COVID-19 outbreak in a German

304

village, we found that loss of taste and smell were the symptoms exhibiting the highest

305

association with PCR positivity [21].

306

The validity regarding sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 serology testing has not yet

307

been investigated entirely [31]. According to the recently published IDSA guidelines on the

308

diagnosis of COVID-19 there will be false positive and false negative tests, but the most

309

reliable spot of measuring SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is 3-4 weeks after exposure to the

310

virus/onset of clinical symptoms [32]. In the present study we used two different

311

immunoassays, the Elecsys Anti-SARS CoV-2 Roche Diagnostics and the EDI Novel

312

Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA. A recent head-to-head comparison of both

313

immunoassays found acceptable agreement between both tests [33]. In our study the Roche

314

Elecsys assay did not identify asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, which was already observed in

315

the CoNAN study mentioned above [21]. This assay was only positive in 2 participants (0.3%)

316

who were tested at beginning of June 2020 and had developed a symptomatic COVID-19

317

disease in the second half of March 2020. In contrast, the EDI IgG ELISA was positive in

318

2.7% of participants (9 asymptomatic and 9 symptomatic cases) including the two persons

319

with the positive Roche Elecsys assay. It is still a matter of debate to what extend

320

seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG can really reflect immunity and status after infection.

321

Nonetheless, serological examination is a method which is easily available and highly cost-

322

effective compared to PCR [34].

323

This study has the following limitations: Despite the high number of participants, the

324

recruitment rate was below 10% of the total JUH staff and results of previous COVID-19

325

testing and compliance using PPE were only recorded by self-reports. We determined

326

antibody titres repeatedly only in those with discrepant results. As SARS-CoV-2 infection

327

generates two waves of antibodies, the provided data do not reflect long-lived immunity [34].

328

329

Conclusion

330

In our study, reported contact with a COVID-19 patient was not found to be a risk factor for

331

seroprevalence of SARS CoV-2 antibodies, whereas contacts with infected family members

332

was highly predictive. In line, we found a high awareness and compliance with PPE and no

333

evidence for higher seroprevalence in HCWs caring for COVID-19 patients, whereas

334

administration employees with no patient contacts had numerically higher seroprevalence

335

rates. We conclude that for HCWs, community transmission may play a larger role for

336

COVID-19 infection than professional exposure when using appropriate PPE.

Figure 1: Flow chart of the Co-HCW study. The number of employees (n) are provided.
Reasons for exclusions are given. Employees working at predefined areas at Jena University
Hospital (JUH) were eligible for study inclusion. Working areas were classified into three
categories according to the risk to deal with COVID-19 positive patients (see Supplementary
Table 1 for the definition). Note that we decided not to assign lab personal to a precategorized risk area because a proportion dealt with COVID-19 related clinical specimens
but there was no patient contact.
Figure 2. Compliance to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) in case of an individual
reported contact with a confirmed COVID-19 positive patient or its surroundings in healthcare
workers (HCWs) from (a) high-risk COVID-19 areas (n=116 HCWs) versus (b) intermediaterisk COVID-19 areas (n=96 HCWs). The definitions of risk areas are provided in
Supplementary Table 1.
