disease in future. However, a realistic and deterministic prediction strategy in Indian Context is
missing and is not available. This paper is an attempt to predict the outburst of COVID-19 in India
using exponential model without any logistic control support. Currently, the model is developed for
rising trend and control is not assumed to be taking place in near future. The paper predicts
infections of COVID-19 in India, for next one month using developed model.

Current Trend in India
The confirmed cases for India, are taken from the website, earmarked for reporting confirmed cases
of COVID-19 for all the regions, country and states of the world . The data is compiled from 15
March 2020 till 30 April 2020 for daily increase in number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in India.
The variation is plotted to understand the trend (Figure 1). As indicated in the figure, on 30 April
2020, 1823 new confirmed cases are added to the already existing confirmed cases of above 33000.
Although there was a spike on 26 April 2020 (Sunday), but there is continuous rise there onwards.

Figure 1 Daily Increase in Number of Confirmed Cases in India

It is clear that the daily variation has been affected significantly by many factors including lockdown,
bulk infection, public outbursts, government directives, people response, state-level implementation
and so on. So, this cannot be fitted into any mathematical model for further analysis. The data is
compiled for cumulative values of confirmed cases from the same site. As far as variation of
cumulative confirmed cases in India from 15 March 2020, onwards is concerned, it has been on the
rise consistently (Figure 2). It is looking like a smooth variation with monotonous rise. While
considering cumulative figures, the occasional spikes are not clearly visible. So, this graph can be
taken to predict the variation, for ease of mathematical modelling.

However, it is clear that the daily rise or variation is a better data for modelling and trend on the
basis of data of previous dates may be helpful in prediction. Although, mathematically complicated,
the daily variation of confirmed cases are taken for analysis, modelling and prediction. The data for
two of the states of India, where confirmed cases are rising at a faster pace is considered. They are
shown as Figure 3. A sudden spike in both the cases at around 18 April 2020 is obvious from the
graph.

Figure 3. Daily COVID-19 Infections at Maharastra and Gujarat

For completeness, some more states with high daily infection rates are taken, so that the
mathematical model can be validated with them. The data of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and
Uttar Pradesh is taken. They are assumed to be representing infection trends of all the states in India
(Figure 4). It is observed that Delhi is showing many spikes and variation is not at all consistent. Delhi
showed sudden burst of cases, as depicted by upward spikes on 4 April, 10 April, 12 April, 14 April,
19 April and 27 April. Compared to that Madhya Pradesh has relatively smooth variation, but has
upward spikes on 11 April, 15 April, 17 April and 24 April. Rajasthan has further consistent data with
upward spikes on 12 April and 22 April. Unfortunately, the dates of upward spikes in number of
confirmed cases are not the same in any two states. Uttar Pradesh showed an upward spike on 14
April, which matches with one of the spikes of Delhi.

Prediction Strategy
For predicting spread of pandemics, mathematical tools are implemented earlier also. It is reported
that Daniel Bernoulli, mathematician tried to map the spread of smallpox in 18 century. Similarly
statistical tools and mapping were used in next century for predicting Cholera spread. Attempts are
also made to COVID-19 prediction. As per prediction on 24 March 2020, by Centre for Disease
Dynamics, Economics and Policy predicted 3 - 4 Crore infections of mild COVID-19 in India by July
2020, which can be delayed by lockdown and only minor change in number was expected. Similarly,
on 22 March 2020 COV-IND-19 study group predicted, 161 per lakh population by 15 May 2020.
This amounts to 22 lakh cases in total without any control measures. However, the preventive
measures can reduce the same to 1 per lakh, making it a mere 13800. Currently both the numbers
are off by large amount and some intermediate strategy is to be adopted for correct prediction
based on current speed of spread, assuming the rate will continue in same manner and opening
lockdown is not affecting the scenario to a sudden large outburst.
th

th

State wise data is compiled and studied with various mathematical models to understand the
behaviour, assuming that the changes due to sudden outbursts are natural phenomena and not the
isolated cases. It is also assumed that similar sudden outbursts may be possible in future also, due to
attributable reasons. In developing a prediction strategy, following features are indirectly playing
role:- (i) Infection spread rate, (ii) Recovery/Cure rate, (iii) Hidden outburst factor. But the confirmed
cases are taken, which in combined way, takes care of all variations. The prediction strategy
identifies a population growth model, which is applicable for the rise of microorganisms. It is
assumed that there is no logistic model strategy, because currently the rise rate of infection is
increasing and there is no slowing down, observed in the real data.
Since population is different in different areas and India shows a combination of all the states, it is
assumed to rationalize the number of cases by taking Gujarat as reference. The ratio of population
to current infection for each state and India is maintained same and daily infection for all states and
India is rationalized to the population of Gujarat. The modified curve is shown as Figure 5.

Figure 5. Rationalized Data for 6 States of India and India

The data clearly indicates that except for the three states, Delhi, Maharastra and Gujarat, other
states are following almost similar trend. The rationalized number of infections are lower in other
states and accordingly, the predictions will have a slower rise in other states. An attempt is made to
fit the same exponential model for all the cases, with proper constants. The Model used for
prediction is given below

H(t) = H(0) x Exp[s x t] + B, where t = time elapsed from reference (15 March 2020 in this case),
H(0) = number of infections on 15 March 2020, H(t) = Rationalized infection at time t, s = intrinsic
rate of increase, B = Offset value for daily infections (to cater for sudden outburst).
The major assumptions made are the constant are independent of space and time and are virtually
invariant. All infectious microorganisms have equal potency to spread and it is independent of time
lapsed and region. The rate of infection is continuous and not discrete, except for the sudden
outburst due to specific reasons. There is no logical control model is applied, at present because
plateau in rising trend has not been achieved yet.

Prediction
It is clear that three states, Delhi, Maharastra and Gujarat has very high growth rate for the
rationalized data. Same exponential model with different constants are fitted for the entire
population and in the exponential model, the initial infections is changed to fit the proper curve. The
modelled data for the 3 states and India is shown as Figure 6. Despite variation the curve can
assumed to be a good fit.

Figure 6. Modeling of Rationalized Daily Infection

Figure 7. Modeling for High Infection States

However, the same data is not applicable to other states and for them the initial value of infected
case is taken higher and further data is fitted. The model predicts that in these three cases,
Maharastra, Gujarat and Delhi, the initial infection were 2.5 times higher than others. It indirectly
says that the rate of rise of infection is same in all the states, but in these three states the value at
initial time was higher, which resulted in higher growth, currently. The modelling for these three
states is given as Figure 7. Slight upward offset is also applied, to cater for the sudden local timedependent outbursts, in these areas, which will nullify as time progresses. It is also observed that

such outbursts are not reflected in the overall daily infection of India, because of larger population
domain. Based on the developed exponential model, prediction is made for next one month at an
interval of 5 days and the values are tabulated below for all the states and India.

Based on this calculation, the prediction for India is plotted as Figure 8. The variation is found to be
matching to the current confirmed cases, as on 30 April 2020. In absence of correct controlling
factors, the cases are likely to cross 1 lakh mark on 15 May 2020. It will have further rise at a very
fast pace, due to exponential effect of the model. The prediction calculated 2 lakh mark on 22 May
2020 and 3 lakh by 26 May 2020. However, it is expected that some decaying factor will become
prevalent including immunity, environment, awareness and mitigation effects, which prevents the
exponential rise as per model.

Conclusion
The daily infection of COVID-19 in India and 6 of its states are modelled, based on exponential
growth. India on an average has a slower rate of rise, as compared to three states namely
Maharastra, Gujarat and Delhi. However, most of the states of India behaves in same way as India.
These three states also exhibited same rate of growth, but the initial number of infections can be

assumed to be 2.5 times others, due to sudden outbursts. The logistic factor is not applied, as the
rate of rise of daily infections have rising trend at present. If the case proceeds in same manner, then
number of infections in India will reach 1 lakh mark by 15 May 2020.
