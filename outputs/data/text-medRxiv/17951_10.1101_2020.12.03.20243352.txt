ABSTRACT (310 words)
Importance: As countermeasures against the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many countries have introduced or considering financial incentives
for people to engage in economic activities such as travel and use restaurants. Japan has
implemented a large-scale, nationwide government-funded program that subsidizes up to 50% of
all travel expenses since July 2020 with the aim of reviving the travel industry. However, it
remains unknown as to how such provision of government subsidies for travel impacted the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Objective: To investigate the association between participation in government subsidies for
domestic travel in Japan and the incidence of COVID-19 infections.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Using the data from a large internet survey conducted
between August 25 and September 30, 2020, in Japan, we examined whether individuals who
used subsidies experienced a higher likelihood of symptoms indicative of the COVID-19
infection.
Exposure: Participation in the government subsidy program for domestic travel.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Five symptoms indicative of the COVID-19 infection (high
fever, sore throat, cough, headache, and smell and taste disorder) within the past one month of
the survey.
Results: Of the 25,482 respondents (50.3% [12,809] women; mean [SD] age, 48.4 [17.4] years),
3,289 (12.9%) participated in the subsidy program at the time of survey. After adjusting for
potential confounders, we found that participants in the subsidy program exhibited higher
incidence of high fever (adjusted rate, 4.8% for participants vs. 3.7% for non-participants;
adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.90; 95%CI, 1.42-2.54; p<0.001), sore throat (19.8% vs. 11.3%; aOR,

taste disorder (2.6% vs. 1.8%; aOR 1.98; 95%CI; 1.15-3.40; p=0.01) compared with nonparticipants.
Conclusion and Relevance: The participants of government subsidies for domestic travel
experienced a higher incidence of symptoms indicative of the COVID-19 infection.

INTRODUCTION
As of the end of November 2020, 62 million people have been infected by the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), and 1.4 million have died of this infection.1 In order to tackle this
unprecedented pandemic, many countries have implemented public health measures — also
known as non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) — to control the spread of the virus,
including lockdown, movement restrictions, quarantine, and border control.2 Given that the
number of infections and deaths due to COVID-19 has been resurging during this winter, these
NPIs are likely to be implemented intermittently,3 until effective vaccines would be developed
and become widely available. While these NPIs have been shown to be effective in reducing the
spread of COVID-19 infections,2,4 they have a substantial negative impact on the economy.5 To
countermeasure the economic downturn due to the NPIs, many countries have introduced or
actively considering financial incentives such as government subsidies to engage in economic
activities such as to use restaurants or travel domestically.6–9

Evidence is limited as to whether the government interventions to financially incentivize
economic activities such as using restaurants or traveling impact the COVID-19 infection. For
example, the United Kingdom implemented the "Eat out to Help out" campaign, in which the
government subsidized up to 50% of the expenses of food and non-alcoholic drinks for
immediate consumption at restaurants using a budget of around £500 million throughout
August.9 A recent study using ecological data on COVID-19 infections by region suggested that
regions that implemented this campaign experienced 8-17 percentage points higher number of
COVID-19 clusters.10 However, ecological association does not imply that the same association
could be observed at the individual level (known as “ecological fallacy”), and therefore, it

remains unknown as to whether this policy actually led to an increased number of individuals
infected by the COVID-19. Indeed, to our knowledge, no study to date has evaluated the impact
of such economic policy on the risk of the COVID-19 infection using individual-level data.
Moreover, it remains unknown as to how similar policies implemented in other countries that
incentivize economic activities (e.g., eating out, travel) affected the COVID-19 pandemic.

Japan has implemented large-scale, nationwide government subsidies for domestic travel (called
the "Go-To" Domestic Travel Campaign)8 since July 2020 with the aim of reviving the travel
industry, which has been hit hard by a substantial decrease in the number of foreign tourists
visiting Japan. This program incentivizes people to travel domestically by subsidizing up to 50%
of all travel expenses for those who travel, including transport and accommodation expenses. As
of the end of October 2020, more than 200 billion Japanese yen (JPY) (approximately 2 billion
US dollars, using an exchange rate of 100 JPY per US dollar) have been used to subsidize a total
of 40 million people who traveled domestically.11 However, as the number of the COVID-19
infected cases has resurged, the Japanese government is facing fierce criticisms speculating that
increased mobility and human interactions due to this program may be causing the increase in
the number of COVID-19 infections.8 Yet, empirical evidence is lacking as to whether the
introduction of this program is associated with an increased risk of the COVID-19 infection.
Japan’s experience from this social experiment provides a unique opportunity to understand the
impact of government subsidies for travel on the spread of COVID-19 infections.

In this context, using the data from a large internet survey conducted between August 25 and
September 30, 2020, in Japan, we examined whether individuals who used subsidies experienced

a higher incidence of symptoms indicative of the COVID-19 infection (COVID-19-like
symptoms).

METHODS
Study Design, Setting, and Data Sources
We analyzed the data from the Japan "COVID-19 and Society" Internet Survey (JACSIS) study,
a cross-sectional, web-based, self-reported questionnaire survey administered by a large internet
research agency (Rakuten Insight, Inc., which had approximately 2.2 million qualified panelists
in 2019).12 This internet research agency has been used in previous studies.13,14 The
questionnaires were distributed to 224,389 panelists selected by each sex, age, and prefecture
category using simple random sampling (it covered all 47 prefectures, the first-tier administrative
district in Japan). The panelists who consented to participate in the survey accessed the
designated website and responded to the questionnaires, and had the option not to respond or
discontinue at any point of the survey. The questionnaires were distributed starting on August 25,
2020, and was completed on September 30, 2020, when the target numbers of respondents for
each sex, age, and prefecture category were met (the target numbers for each sex, age, and
prefecture category had been determined in advance according to the population distribution in
2019; 28000 respondents; response rate, 12.5%). We excluded 2,518 individuals showing
unnatural or inconsistent responses using the algorithm we developed. The final sample size was
25,482 respondents (91.0% of the total survey respondents).

Exposure Variables

The primary exposure variable was the participation in the subsidy program for domestic travel,
which has been effective since July 22, 2020.

Outcome Variables
Our outcome variable was the incidence of five self-reported COVID-19-like symptoms (high
fever, sore throat, cough, headache, and smell and taste disorder) during the one month prior to
the time of the survey.15 Self-reported COVID-19-like symptoms have been reported as a useful
measure to monitor the spread of the COVID-19 infections.16,17

Adjustment Variables
We adjusted for the respondents’ demographics,18 socio-economic status (SES),19 health-related
characteristics,18 and prefecture fixed effects (effectively comparing individuals living in the
same prefecture). The demographics included age (categorized as 15-19, 20-29, …, 70-79) and
sex. The SES included academic attainment (graduated from college or higher institutions vs.
high school or lower institutions), income level (categorized using the tertiles of household
equivalent income [“low” = less than 2.5 million JPY, “medium” = 2.5 to 4.3 million JPY, and
“high” = more than 4.3 million JPY], and an indicator for those who refused to respond to this
question), household size (number of household members: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5+), employment status
(employer, self-employed, employee, and unemployed), and marital status (married, never
married, widowed, and separated). The household equivalized income was calculated as the
gross (pre-tax) income in 2019, divided by the square root of the number of household members.
Health-related characteristics included smoking status (never, ever, and current smokers),
walking disability (whether the person is experiencing difficulties in walking), and eight

comorbidities (overweight [body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2], hypertension, diabetes, asthma,
coronary disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer). Body mass index
was calculated by dividing self-reported body weight by self-reported body height squared (m2).

Statistical Analysis
First, we compared the demographics, SES, and health-related characteristics of the participants
in the subsidy program for domestic travel vs. non-participants. To account for the possibility
that those who participated and responded to the internet-based survey may differ from the
general population (e.g., a younger population may be more likely to participate and respond to
the internet-based survey), we used the weighted regression models (inverse probability
weighting [IPW]).20 The weights (propensity scores) were calculated by fitting a logistic
regression model using demographics, SES, and health-related characteristics to adjust for the
difference in respondents between the current internet survey and a widely-used nationwide
representative survey (i.e., the 2016 Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions21,22) (see
Supplementary Method 1 for details).

Second, we examined the association between participation in the subsidy program for domestic
travel and the incidence rates of the COVID-19-like symptoms. For each outcome, we adjusted
for the respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics, health-related characteristics, and
prefecture fixed effects. We used weighted multivariable logistic regression models, with
standard errors clustered at the prefecture-level, to account for the potential correlation of the
respondents within the same prefecture. To calculate risk-adjusted incidence rates of COVID-19like symptoms, we used marginal standardization (also known as predictive margins or margins

of response).23 For each respondent, we calculated predicted probabilities of the incidence of the
COVID-19-like symptom with participation in the subsidy program fixed at each category and
then averaged over the distribution of covariates in our sample.

To adjust for multiple comparisons of having five outcome variables using the Holm method,24
which sequentially compares the i-th smallest P value (for i = 1, …, 5) among the five original P
values with progressively less restrictive alpha levels (= .05/(5 − i + 1)). To make the
interpretation easier, we calculated the adjusted P value by multiplying the unadjusted P values
by (5 – i + 1) times, and considered the adjusted P value < 0.05 to be statistically significant.25
All analyses were conducted using Stata version 15 (College Station, TX; StataCorp LLC.). This
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Osaka International Cancer
Institute (No. 20084).

Secondary analysis
We conducted sensitivity analyses. First, the travels to and from Tokyo were ineligible for the
subsidy program until September 15, due to a large number of the COVID-19 cases in Tokyo.8
To assess whether our findings were sensitive to the inclusion of residents of Tokyo (we did not
exclude these individuals in our main analyses as they could still use the subsidy program if their
companion lived in other prefectures than Tokyo), we reanalyzed the data after excluding the
respondents living in Tokyo prefecture. Second, we repeated the analyses without using IPW to
examine how the use of this approach affected our findings. Third, in order to test whether the
impact of the subsidy program differs by the characteristics of respondents, we conducted

stratified analyses by age (15-64 years and 65-79 years), the presence of comorbidities (no
comorbidities vs. having at least one comorbidity), and sex.

RESULTS
Characteristics of respondents
Of the 25,482 respondents, 3,289 (12.9%) had participated in the subsidy program for domestic
travel at the time of the survey. The participants in the subsidy program were younger; have
higher education and higher income; and more likely to be overweight (Table 1).

Participation in the subsidy program for domestic travel and COVID-19-like symptoms
After adjusting for demographics, SES, health-related characteristics and indicators of
prefectures (Table 2), we found that the adjusted incidence rates of COVID-19-like symptoms
were higher for the subsidy program participants compared with the non-participants for high
fever (adjusted rate, 4.8% for participants vs. 3.7% for non-participants; adjusted odds ratio
[aOR], 1.90; 95%CI, 1.42-2.56; p<0.001), sore throat (19.8% vs. 11.3%; aOR, 2.09; 95%CI,
1.37-3.20; p=0.002), cough (19.1% vs. 11.2%; aOR 1.96; 95%CI, 1.27-3.02; p=0.007), headache
(29.1% vs. 25.5%; aOR, 1.24; 95%CI, 1.07-1.43; p=0.007), and smell and taste disorder (2.6%
vs. 1.8%; aOR 1.98; 95%CI; 1.15-3.40; p=0.01).

Secondary analysis
Our findings were largely unaffected by excluding the respondents living in Tokyo
(Supplementary Table 1) or using unweighted regression models (Supplementary Table 2).
The result of the stratified analyses by age showed a higher incidence rate of COVID-19-like

symptoms were more salient among young respondents (Supplementary Table 3). For example,
among respondents aged 15-64 years, the adjusted incidence rate of smell and taste disorder was
higher for the subsidy program participants compared with the younger non-participants
(adjusted rate, 3.4% vs. 2.4%; aOR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.15-3.48; p=0.01), whereas the incidence
rates did not differ between participants and non-participants among those aged 65-79 years
(0.3% vs. 0.6%; aOR, 0.52; 95%CI, 0.20-1.38; p=0.19) (p for interaction = 0.02). We found no
systemic difference in the patterns regarding the association between the subsidy program
participation and COVID-19-like symptoms for the stratified analyses by the presence of
comorbidity and sex (Supplementary Tables 4-5).

DISCUSSION
Using the data from a large cross-sectional internet survey that included more than 25,000 adults
in Japan, we found that individuals who participated in the government’s subsidy program for
domestic travel experienced a higher incidence of COVID-19-like symptoms compared with
those who did not participate. This association was also observed for the incidence of smell and
taste disorder, which is a highly specific symptom of the COVID-19 infection.15,26 This increased
incidence of the COVID-19-like-symptoms was clustered among individuals aged <65 years, but
not for those aged ≥ 65 years, suggesting that, if any, the non-elderly generation may be
contributing to the spread of COVID-19 infection associated with this program. Given that the
Japanese government is currently considering to halt this subsidy program with concerns for
increased risks of COVID-19 infections, and other countries are also actively considering similar
policies to stimulate the economy, our findings should be informative for policymakers to design
policies that could increase economic activities without exacerbating the COVID-19 pandemic.

There are several mechanisms through which participation in this subsidy program was
associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19-like symptoms. First, traveling itself may have
led to a higher risk of incidence of COVID-19 due to increased contact with people in dining and
sightseeing at the destination (causal effect). This explanation is supported by a recent genome
epidemiological study of SARS-CoV-2 in Japan that found the possibility that the COVID-19
clusters in Tokyo metropolitan areas might have spread throughout Japan after the lifting of
movement restrictions.27 Second, the subsidy program participants might have been more likely
to take behaviors that place them at greater risk of contracting the COVID-19 than the nonparticipants (selection effect). However, even if the findings were to be explained by this
selection effect, our findings nevertheless indicate that the subsidy program may be incentivizing
those who had higher risks of COVID-19 transmission to travel, leading to larger cases of
infections. A better policy may be that incentivize individuals with a lower risk of the COVID-19
infection to travel, while those with a high risk to stay at home.

Our study has limitations. First, as with any observational study, we could not fully account for
unmeasured confounders, and our study was unable to identify the exact mechanisms of the
association between the subsidy program participation and increased incidence rates of COVID19-like symptoms. Second, given the cross-sectional design of our study, we could not identify
the temporal relationship between the subsidy program and the incidence of the COVID-19-like
symptoms. Instead of the government subsidy causing the infection of the COVID-19, it was also
possible that individuals who had experienced COVID-19-like symptoms were more likely to
utilize the program and travel domestically. However, this explanation may be unlikely given

that travel agents and hotels have been introducing strict protocols to ensure that nobody with the
COVID-19-like symptoms to use their services, and individuals who spread the virus are likely
to face criticism and stigma in Japan incentivizing people with suspected symptoms to stay at
home.28 Third, it is likely that some individuals who reported five COVID-19-like symptoms had
illnesses that were not COVID-19, as we were unable to collect the data on the confirmed
diagnosis of COVID-19 infection (e.g., diagnosis using the PCR test). However, smell and taste
disorders, one of the outcomes we used, are known to be highly specific (90% specificity) for the
COVID-19 diagnosis,15,26 suggesting these symptoms would be good proxies of the incidence of
COVID-19. Moreover, symptom-based measures would supplement the PCR test-based
surveillance to understand a population-level picture of COVID-19 infection,16,17 because PCR
testing will underestimate the true number of infections because not everyone with symptoms
indicative of COVID-19 is tested. Fourth, our findings may be affected by the possibility that
individuals who presented with COVID-19-like symptoms might recall and report using the
subsidy program for domestic travel (as the cause of their symptoms) compared with those
individuals without such symptoms (recall bias). Finally, because our study sample was collected
through the web-based survey, our findings may not be generalizable to the population with
limited access/literacy to the internet. Nevertheless, we used weighted analysis to minimize the
difference in demographics, SES, and health-related characteristics between respondents of the
current internet survey and the nationally representative survey, and thus would approximate our
estimates to national estimates.

Using a large-scale, concurrent, nationwide internet survey in Japan, we found that the
participants in the government subsidies for domestic travel in Japan had higher incidence rates
of COVID-19-like symptoms compared to the non-participants. Our findings suggest the
implementation of the subsidy program for domestic travel might have contributed to the
increased cases of the COVID-19 infection. In the midst of economic recession due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, economic stimulus policies should incentivize individuals with low-risk of
the COVID-19 infection to engage in economic activities while encouraging high-risk
individuals to stay at home.

SD: standard deviation. The analyses were weighted to account for selection in an internet survey. Because of
weighting, the sum of participants and non-participants did not necessarily equal the number of total respondents.
The numbers are No. (%), except for age. P values are calculated using an adjusted Wald test for age and chi-square
tests for other categorical variables. The analyses of this table were for the purpose of simple description and did not
take into account multiple comparisons in the presentation of the P values.

OR: odds ratio. CI: confidence interval. We examined the association of the participation in the government subsidies for
domestic travel in the past 1-2 months with the incidence of the five COVID-19-like symptoms in the past one month. For each
outcome, we constructed a weighted multivariable logistic regression model with standard errors clustered at the prefecture-level.
We adjusted for the respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics, health-related characteristics, and prefecture indicator
variables. We weighted the regression models using IPW to account for “being a respondent in an internet survey.” Adjusted
rates were calculated using marginal standardization. Adjusted P values using the Holm method for multiple testing were shown
(the adjusted p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant).
