A BSTRACT
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused a tremendous health burden
and impact on the world economy. As one of the European countries
experiencing one of the worst COVID-19 epidemics, the UK government
at the end of March 2020 implemented the biggest lockdown of society
during peacetime in British history, aiming to contain the rapid spread of
the virus. While the lockdown has been maintained for seven weeks in UK,
the effectiveness of the control measures in suppressing the transmission of
the disease remains incompletely understood. Here we applied a Bayesian
SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) epidemiological model to
rebuild the local transmission dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in
nine regions of England. We found that the basic reproduction number
(R0 ) in England is relatively high compared with China. Our estimation of
the temporally varying effective reproduction number (Rt ) suggests that
the control measures, especially the forceful lockdown, were effective to
reduce the transmissibility and curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the
overall incidence rate in the UK has declined, our forecasting highlights
the possibility of a second wave of the disease in several regions, which
may be currently underway in one of the cities there (e.g. Leicester, East
Midlands). This study enhances our understanding of the current outbreak
and effectiveness of control measures in the UK.

Introduction

The unexpected emergence and outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Zhou et al.,
2020; Lu et al., 2020a; Lam et al., 2020), has become an ongoing and serious threat to the
global health and economy. Early cases of the disease were reported in Wuhan city, China
in late December 2019 (Li et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020). Since then,
the geographical diffusion of the disease was expedited by the return-to-home migration
during the Chinese new year, which led to the reports of a number of successive outbreaks
in other provinces of China (Jia et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2020).
Regarding the severe epidemic of COVID-19 in China, the World Health Organization
(WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30
January 2020. Although great efforts were taken to contain the disease, with only few
imported cases initially reported in Europe and North America in early February 2020,
the outbreak soon became global. Outbreaks were reported almost simultaneously in
Lombardy, Italy (Grasselli et al., 2020); Daegu, South Korea (Shim et al., 2020) and Qom,
Iran (Safavi et al., 2020), which quickly spread to neighboring countries. This resulted in
the WHO characterizing COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
The first confirmed case in the UK was identified in York on 31 January 2020. This was
followed by several cases sporadically reported between 1 February and 27 February 2020.
Most of these early cases had a clear overseas travel history and they were quarantined and
received immediate supportive care. As of 14 February 2020, eight of the nine confirmed
cases had recovered. However, the number of confirmed cases in the four nations (England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) of the UK began to increase rapidly from 28
February 2020.
Initially, London was the most severely affected, where the confirmed number of
cases accounted for almost one-third of the total in England by 31 March 2020. Local
transmission chains were identified between large cities and neighboring towns and rural
areas in almost every region of the UK by the end of May. The death toll also increased
along with the number of cases, resulting in the UK overtaking Italy as the country with
the highest death toll in Europe and the second highest in the world on 5 May 2020. As
of 24 June 2020, there are over 306,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases with almost 43,000
deaths in the UK.
Although the majority of infected patients show only mild symptoms (Chen et al., 2020),
including fever and cough (Guan et al., 2020), some patients develop critical symptoms
after the hospital admission with likely immune-mediated and aggravated disease (Ye
et al., 2020). No effective treatment options had been definitively identified at that time, as
demonstrated by well-designed randomized control trials (Zhai et al., 2020), and clinical
trials of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were still in their early stages (Zhu et al., 2020).
Thus, the lack of pharmaceutical interventions, together with the high transmissibility
of the virus was clearly exacerbating the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and elsewhere
(Huang et al., 2020b).
In addition, it is still unclear whether and how SARS-CoV-2 will circulate and interact
with the other seasonal human coronaviruses, in the UK and globally, and to what extent it

may become seasonal (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) (Liu
et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Xie and Zhu, 2020; Yao et al., 2020). Nevertheless, given the
ongoing COVID-19 activities in tropical regions, it is now very unlikely that the current
UK epidemic will naturally end during summer. Therefore, identifying effective, practical
and economic public health interventions both for now and in the future will be critical to
rapidly contain the spread of the virus and alleviate the pressure on healthcare systems.
In China, the government banned all transportations to and from Wuhan on 23 January
2020 and subsequently closed the border of remaining cities in Hubei province. Similar
measures aimed to reduce human mobility were issued in other Chinese cities and have
been shown to effectively mitigate the spread of the infection (Kraemer et al., 2020;
Tian et al., 2020). In Europe, Italy first implemented a national lockdown on 11 March
2020. This was followed by Spain on 15 March and France on 17 March, and finally the
UK on 23 March (https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-oncoronavirus-23-march-2020). All these measures eventually proved effective in curtailing
local COVID-19 outbreaks in these countries, i.e. by reducing the effective reproduction
number below 1 (Gatto et al., 2020; Aleta and Moreno, 2020; Kwok et al., 2020).
Therefore, exploring the transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 and investigating
the effectiveness of various control measures is important to acquire better understanding
of this ongoing pandemic to develop and improve public health intervention policies.
Although there have been a few studies that mainly focused on China, Continental Europe
and North America (e.g., Wu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020; Kucharski
et al., 2020; Liang, 2020; Linka et al., 2020; Leung et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020),
few studies have analyzed the UK COVID-19 epidemic specifically, regarding the local
transmission dynamics and evaluation of the control measures.
Here we applied a Bayesian SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) epidemiological model that incorporates internal migration data and the regional daily number of
laboratory-confirmed cases to reveal the local epidemic progression of the COVID-19 in
nine regions of England, including East Midlands, East of England, London, North East,
North West, South East, South West, West Midlands, and Yorkshire and the Humber. The
regional basic reproduction number (R0 ) and temporally varying effective reproduction
number (Rt ) were estimated by a sequential Monte Carlo method to identify the effectiveness of control measures. We also provide forecasts for the number of daily cases for nine
regions of England.

Method

2.1 Date sources
Two datasets were used in this study to rebuild the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19
epidemic in England: the daily number of laboratory-confirmed cases between 27 February
and 31 May 2020, collected from the publicly available dashboard provided by Public
Health England (PHE: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/); and the internal migration data
collected from the Office of National Statistics of UK (https://www.ons.gov.uk/).
Public Health England (PHE) publishes a case dataset that comprises the number of
laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 within different types of administrative areas

of England (i.e. region, upper-tier local authority, and lower-tier local authority). The
laboratory-confirmed cases were identified in local laboratories of the National Health
System (NHS) by testing specimens from people eligible for SARS-CoV-2 testing, according to the national guidance active at that time. The geographical location of each
specimen was tracked by the home postcode of the person being tested. If repeat tests
were conducted, the date when the first positive test occurred was recorded. Redundant
tests from the same person were removed so there was no double record. Cases were
aggregated according to the corresponding administrative area. Not all local authorities
had complete records, and some administrative regions were too small and did not seem to
have significant or continuous outbreaks. Therefore, we focused on regional level data in
this study.
In addition, our model only considers local transmissions, therefore cases reported prior
to 27 February 2020 (the date when the local transmission was considered to have begun)
were excluded. Note that, data was not always up-to-date as some community test results
would have been delayed (including care home figures). Therefore, the daily number of
laboratory-confirmed cases from all nine regions were collated on 7 June 2020 (one week
after the last date of our collected data) and shown in Figure 1. It is likely that the epidemic
peak in England was reached on 8 April 2020. COVID-19 cases in London and the North
West accounted for the first (18.4%) and second largest (17.6%) number of cumulative
cases by 1 June 2020.
To account for the movement of population between regions in modelling the disease
transmission, we used the annual mid-year internal migration data, where internal migration
was defined as residential moves across the boundaries of the nine English regions. We
used the latest available annual data, from 2018. Inflow and outflow data were aggregated
across sex and age. To have a constant population size in the model, the inflow and outflow

data involved in the model were transformed so that they were both equal to the mean of
the observed inflow and outflow data.
2.2 Mathematical model
A SEIR compartmental model, which is widely used in infectious disease modeling to
describe the transmission dynamics within a community, was applied here. The model
divides the population into susceptible (S), exposed (E; but not infectious), infected (I) and
removed (R) compartments and people progress between these disease statuses, which
have been clinically described elsewhere (Huang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020; Guan
et al., 2020).
Since PHE suggested the citizens with mild respiratory symptoms stay at home and
self-isolate, and the COVID-19 patients with non-respiratory symptoms have been reported
in some studies (Cai et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020b), it is likely that there is an unknown
proportion of the population in England that have been infected and subsequently recovered
without being recognized and tested. Hence, people in the infected (I) compartment are
divided into those who are infected and receive test Ia (i.e. those who have severe
symptoms and receive medical treatment in a hospital) and people who are infected and do
not have a test Ib (i.e. those with mild symptoms and who recovered at home). We know
that the proportions of hospitalized and community patients (infected) are significant (Bird
et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020). We assume that a proportion δ of the exposed population
will enter Ia and a Uniform prior distribution U [0, 1] is used to account for the uncertainty
about δ. The equations of changes in each compartment are set as follows

lockdown. We assume that people show symptoms once they enter Ia , and W (t) is the
number of people who are waiting for their test result after showing symptoms at time t.
C(t) is the estimated cumulative number of cases. η is the rate of being infectious (i.e. the
inverse of the incubation period), µ is the rate of recovery (i.e. the inverse of the infectious
period, which equals the mean serial interval minus the incubation period (Lipsitch et al.,
2003)) and 1/ρ is the number of days between showing symptoms and receiving test results.
We set 1/η = 5.2 and 1/µ = 2.3 days according to the estimates from a comprehensive
study of the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19 (Li et al., 2020) and 1/ρ = 4 based
on the estimates from Chen et al. (2020). Following Kucharski et al. (2020), we assume
a temporally varying transmission rate β(t) that follows a log-normal sequential update
(i.e. log(β(t)) ∼ N (log(β(t − 1)), σ), given a standard deviation σ) and the effective
reproduction number Rt at time t is approximated by (see the Supplementary Method for
details)

from the start to time t
P (Y (t)|R0 , β1:t ) ∼ Pois(ρW (t)).
To account for the early period when the virus started to seed in each English region before
public awareness, we run a preliminary model that is similar to (1) except with a constant
β derived from the R0 . The preliminary model assumes that a single infected person enters
the region of interest 14 days before the date of the first confirmed local case since 27
February 2020.
The analysis was conducted in R version 4.0. The sequential Monte Carlo method was
used to draw samples of R0 and β1:t from the posterior distribution, where the optimal
standard deviation σ that gives the highest likelihood was selected by an exhaustive search.

Results and discussion

3.1 Basic reproduction number
The basic reproduction number R0 is an important parameter that quantifies the disease
transmissibility at the start of epidemic. The estimated basic reproduction numbers R0 for
each of the nine English regions are listed in Table 1 (histograms of the posterior samples
are shown in Figure A). All these regions have R0 between 2.8-3.9, which are significantly
higher than 1.
Notably, we find that the estimated R0 is positively correlated with the population size
in each region. Spearman’s rank correlation is 0.77 which is significantly higher than 0
(p-value < 0.05). These estimates are relatively high (seven of nine regions have their
medians larger than 3) compared with the early estimate in China by WHO (1.4-2.5),
although high R0 (3.8-8.9) was also reported in China more recently (e.g., Sanche et al.,
2020).
Compared with other major airborne viruses, SARS-CoV-2 in England has an estimated
R0 similar to SARS-CoV but significantly higher than MERS-CoV and other human
influenza viruses (Chen, 2020). This indicates that the COVID-19 has very strong transmissibility in the early stage and the infected population size will quickly expand without
human interventions in all nine regions. Our estimates of R0 in England are largely consistent with estimates from other major European countries (e.g., Italy: 3.49-3.84; France:
3.1-3.3) (Gatto et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020; Distante et al., 2020; Roques et al., 2020).
This might explain the rapid spread and high pandemic potential of the COVID-19 when
relatively few control measures were implemented in Europe.
3.2 Effectiveness of control measures
On 25 February 2020, The UK government announced “Contain-Delay-Research-Mitigate”
strategy, but this was only followed by advice that travelers from heavily hit countries
should self-isolate. On 12 March, the government started to issue policies for local
residents, advising those with respiratory symptoms to self-isolate at home.
After the release of the controversial herd immunity strategy, the UK government
advised people against “non-essential” travel and public entertainment venues on 16

March. This was followed by the closure of all pubs, cafes, restaurants, bars, gyms, etc.
four days later. On 23 March, a restrictive national lockdown was announced by the UK
government and the police force was provided with powers to ensure compliance on 26
March.
Since then, people have not been allowed to leave their homes without limited reasons,
gatherings of more than two people are forbidden and social distancing is required in shops.
Public transport use has declined significantly during the lockdown period. The control
measures began to gradually ease from 10 May when the UK government allowed certain
groups of people to work and encouraged outdoor exercise, yet people were warned to
“stay alert”. Given these measures, we define the control period as between 12 and 26
March and the lockdown period as between 26 March and 10 May.
The estimated temporally varying effective reproduction number Rt is shown in Figure
3. Almost all nine English regions’ Rt exhibit an overall decreasing trend during the control
period. London, West Midlands, and South East show a mostly decreasing Rt during the
control period. In the remaining regions, although the Rt increases or oscillates at the
beginning of the control period when measures were largely mild suggestions, it started
to decrease when the more restrictive and forceful national lockdown was implemented.
This reveals the effectiveness of issuing forceful control measures to contain the epidemic.
Although, Rt in East Midlands, North East and North West rise after the control period, in
all cases it subsequently decreases towards 1 within a week. These transmission dynamics
patterns are also consistent with some country-level estimates in literature (e.g., Kwok
et al., 2020).
In general, the control measures issued in England during the March were effective
to contain the spread of COVID-19 in all nine English regions. This is consistent with
a previous study which investigates the effect of the reduction of social contacts on
the transmissibility based on surveys (Jarvis et al., 2020). It is noteworthy that the Rt
remains slightly under 1 during most of the lockdown period, rather than diminish to 0.
This suggests that the local transmissions were maintained, possibly in small towns and
communities even though the overall epidemic has been effectively contained, and the
virus might circulate between different areas within each English region.
3.3 Estimation of the daily number of new cases
To verify the model, we compare the estimated daily number of cases with the observed
daily number of confirmed cases. The result is shown in Figure 4 (the estimates of the
number of the infected population and susceptible population are shown in Figure B).
Although the observed number fluctuates over time, the overall trend of the daily cases is
well captured by our model.
Broadly, the daily number of confirmed cases in the nine English regions achieved their
peak in early April. Notably, London is the first region whose daily number of new cases
rapidly rose in early March. Our findings highlight the serious epidemic in London during
the early phase. This might be due to the fact that London receives the highest proportion of
inbound visitors from other English regions and is the most densely populated area among
all English regions. In addition, a constantly high daily number of cases was maintained
in Yorkshire and the Humber during April, as more infected population may have been

seeded prior to lockdown, resulting in the transmission to their household contacts during
the lockdown. This may explain the delay in the reduction of Rt . The daily number of
cases in two regions of the Midlands rose shortly in late April, yet declines are observed
from the beginning of May. The daily number of cases in the remaining regions declined
during late April and May. These results correspond to our previous estimates that Rt was
generally below 1 during the lockdown period. This again indicates the effectiveness of
the control measures in all regions.
3.4 Forecasting potential second wave outbreaks
In our model forecasting, we assume that Rt stayed constant after 31 May and we use the
posterior samples of Rt on that day to forecast the daily number of confirmed cases in June
and July. Since the lockdown has been lifted after 01 June, we assume that the inflow and
outflow of the population restart. Relevant results are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Estimates and forecasting of the daily number of confirmed COVID-19 cases based on data
between 27 February and 31 May 2020 in nine English regions. The light and deep shaded areas are 95%
credible interval and interquartile range respectively. The dots mark the observed daily number of confirmed
cases. The vertical blue dashed line marks the last date of our collected data (31 May 2020). Beyond the
dashed line are the forecasting results.

Although the daily number of new cases is expected to decrease in most regions, it is
estimated that, except the East of England, North West and South East, where Rt remains
significantly lower than 1, other regions may still witness a second wave of outbreaks.
In particular, the East Midlands, South West, West Midlands, and Yorkshire and the
Humber may experience a rebound of incidence after June, as projected by the upper 95%
CI of the daily number of new cases (which may go up to 40% and above of the number at
the March/April peak).
Notably, Leicester (of East Midlands: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-englandleicestershire-53105336) and Cleckheaton (of Yorkshire: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/ukengland-leeds-53105266) recently reported surges of cases, which corroborates our model
forecast. Moreover, since the estimated Rt in the South West significantly covers high
values on 31 May, it will likely maintain a relatively large median number of infected
population until August (more than 100 individuals). While the UK government has been
considering lifting some control measures to restore the economy, special attentions should
be paid to the regions with the risk of the second wave outbreak.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrated the use of a Bayesian SEIR model to reconstruct the transmission
dynamics of the COVID-19 in nine English regions. Although the true dynamics of
the transmission of the COVID-19 is a complex process, the estimated daily number of
cases follows closely with the trend of the observed daily number of cases, indicating the
validity of our model. Our findings show that the basic reproduction number in England is
generally higher than China but in line with some major European countries. The effective
reproduction number estimates present a temporally varying trend of the transmissibility.
Our results suggest that the transmissibility of the COVID-19 was effectively reduced by
the control measures adopted by the UK government. This leads to a decline of the number
of infected population during May. Notably, although critics may argue that the restriction
of the free movement of people violates basic human rights when the milder measures like
social distancing can be equally useful, such strict measures within a national lockdown
were efficient to contain the transmission in some regions. The forecasting data highlight
the possibility of early secondary outbreaks, so close monitoring of the rate of transmission
and Rt are still required even after lockdown measures are lifted.

Supplementary Method

In this supplementary method, we discuss the formula to estimate the effective reproduction
number Rt at time t. In the main text, we build the SEIR model as:
dS(t)
β(t)I(t)
S(t)
,
=−
S(t) + Lin − Lout
dt
N
N − Ia (t)
dE(t)
β(t)I(t)
E(t)
=
S(t) − ηE(t) − Lout
,
dt
N
N − Ia (t)
dIa (t)
= δηE(t) − µIa (t),
dt
dIb (t)
Ib (t)
= (1 − δ)ηE(t) − µIb (t) − Lout
,
dt
N − Ia (t)
dR(t)
R(t)
= µ(Ia (t) + Ib (t)) − Lout
.
dt
N − Ia (t)
We apply the next generation matrix (van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002) to calculate
the Rt . Given the infected compartments E, Ia , Ib , we have
 β(t)S(t) β(t)S(t) 

N

F (t) = 0

V (t) = 
.

Note that, Figure B shows that the proportion of susceptible population S(t)/N for each
region is very close to 1 during the whole period of study. The daily number of inflow
and outflow are also far smaller than the total number of the population. To simplify the
calculation, we can therefore approximate the matrix V (t) by


η
0 0
µ 0 .
V̂ (t) =  −δη
(δ − 1)η 0 µ
Then we have the approximated next generation matrix:
 β(t)S(t) β(t)S(t)
F (t)V̂ (t)−1 = 

Since the effective reproduction number is the spectral radius of the next generation matrix
(i.e., the eigenvalue which has the largest absolute value), then we have
R̂t =
