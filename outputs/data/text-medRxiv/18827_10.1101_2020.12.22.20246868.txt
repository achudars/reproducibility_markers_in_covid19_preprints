Abstract
Facing shortages of personal protective equipment, some clinicians have advocated the use of
barrier enclosures (typically mounted over the head, with and without suction) to contain aerosol
emissions from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. There is however little evidence
for its usefulness. To test the eﬀectiveness of such a device, we built a manikin that can expire
micron-sized aerosols at flow rates close to physiological conditions. We then placed the manikin
inside the enclosure and used a laser sheet to visualize the aerosol leaking out. We show that with
suﬃcient suction, it is possible to eﬀectively contain aerosol from the manikin even at high flow
rates (up to 60 L min−1 ) of oxygen, reducing aerosol exposure outside the enclosure by 99%. In
contrast, a passive barrier without suction only reduces aerosol exposure by 60%.

The prolonged nature of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted
in global shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially N95 respirators. As
a result, some clinicians have resorted to using barrier enclosures typically mounted on the
hospital bed over the patient’s head to contain any aerosol emissions, especially during
aerosol generating procedures such as intubation [1–3]. Initial barrier design consisted of a
passive enclosure without suction which can eﬀectively stop large respiratory droplets [1], but
not smaller aerosol droplets. It was later realized that active suction is critical to eﬀectively
contain micron-sized aerosol droplets [4–6]. However, the amount of suction required for
eﬀective aerosol containment remains unexplored, especially when the patient is subjected
to treatment modalities involving high gas flow rates, e.g. high flow nasal cannula (HFNC)
oxygen therapy. There is also little quantitative data for the reduction in aerosol exposure
for barrier designs with and without suction.
Here, we used laser sheets to visualize the aerosol flow from a custom-built manikin
expiring micron-sized water-glycerin droplets at flow rates close to physiological conditions
[7]. We found that with suﬃcient suction, it is possible to eﬀectively contain aerosol inside
the enclosure even when the manikin is subjected to high flow rates (up to 60 L min−1 ) of
supplementary oxygen. By spiking the water-glycerin droplets with fluorescein [8] and using
spectrofluorometer to quantify the amount of fluorescein collected by air samplers outside
the barrier, we were able to establish that a barrier enclosure with active suction can reduce
potential aerosol exposure by more than 99%. In contrast, a passive barrier without suction
only reduces aerosol exposure by 60%.
Given the growing evidence that COVID-19 is airborne and can spread through aerosol
[9–11], a well-designed barrier enclosure can be useful in protecting healthcare workers from
infectious COVID-19 patients.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

The barrier enclosure was designed by local institutions of higher learning and used by a
hospital in Singapore (See Supporting Figure S1 for detailed design). The physical enclosure
(width, breadth and height of 92 cm × 60 cm × 70 cm) is made of perspex (Fig. 1a), with
a plastic drape at the front, four openings (two at the headend and one on either side) for
access to patients, and two suction ports (one on either side). Suction is provided by two

wall units typically found in a hospital, each with a maximum suction rate of 60 L min−1 .
COVID-19 patients typically require oxygen therapy, with high flow nasal cannula (HFNC)
oxygen therapy (Fig. 1b) showing positive medical outcomes [12–14]. The high oxygen flow
rate (up to 60 L min−1 ) can however quickly disperse any bioaerosol over large distances,
increasing the infection risk to healthcare workers. In this paper, we will show that aerosol
can be eﬀectively contained in the enclosure when the flow rate of the suction Qsuction exceeds
the sum of the oxygen flow rate QO2 and the expiration rate of the patient Qair (Fig. 1c),
i.e.
Qsuction > QO2 + Qair

We first placed a custom-built manikin inside the barrier enclosure. Micron-sized waterglyerin aerosol droplets were generated inside a box (50 cm × 50 cm × 60 cm) using a fog
machine (typically used in entertainment venues). See Supporting Fig S2 for droplet size
distribution. Glycerin (50 v%) was added to water to prevent the aerosol droplets from
evaporating. A manual resuscitator or an Ambu bag was then used to expel the aerosol
from the box through the manikin into the barrier (Fig. 2a) once every 6 seconds for 20
minutes at flow rates close to human breath (0.63 L in 3 seconds or Qair = 13 L min−1 ). The
aerosol flow can be visualized by shining a blue laser sheet at the sagittal z–y plane (Fig. 2b
and Supporting Video 1). At the same time, we shone a green laser sheet at the transverse
x–z plane in front of the barrier to better visualize any leakage from the barrier enclosure.

To test the eﬀectiveness of the aerosol containment under diﬀerent conditions, we varied
the suction rate Qsuction from 0 (no suction) to 60 and 120 L min−1 (1 and 2 wall suction units,
respectively), while at the same time subjecting the manikin to a HFNC oxygen therapy
at flow rates QO2 = 0–60 L min−1 (Fig. 2c). Experimentally, we found that Equation 1

correctly predicts the criterion for eﬀective aerosol confinement (The transition from eﬀective
to ineﬀective containment as predicted by equation 1 is indicated by the gray line in Figure
2c). For example, at maximal QO2 = 60 L min−1 (and Qair = 13 L min−1 ), two wall units
with a combined Qsuction = 120 L min−1 are able to eﬀectively confine the aerosol inside
the barrier even after 20 minutes (Fig. 2d and Supporting Video 2). The green laser sheet
is not visible since there is no aerosol to scatter the light and fresh air is continually being
drawn in from gaps at the bottom of the plastic drape (dark area in Supporting Video 2 and
Supporting Figure S3 is a region relatively free from aerosol). In contrast, with just one or
no suction, the aerosol cannot be contained and spread quickly throughout the entire room
(with a floor area of about 30 m2 ) within minutes. The aerosol leaking out scatters light
strongly and renders the green laser sheet visible (Fig. 2e and Supporting Video 3) [15].
To assess the level of protection aﬀorded by the barrier enclosure with and without
suction, we added a small amount of fluorescein (0.5 g L−1 ) to the water-glycerin solution.
The level of aerosol exposure can then be quantified by measuring the amount of fluorescein
collected by filters of two air samplers (with a flow rate of 60 L min−1 ) placed 50 and 110
cm away from the barrier (samplers 1 and 2 in Figure 3a, respectively). The fluorescein
trapped by the filter (Fig. 3b) can be dissolved in water (2 mL) and the amount deduced
by spectrofluorometry.

FIG. 3. (a) To quantify the amount of aerosol leak, we placed two air samplers outside the barrier
enclosure. (b) Aerosol droplets (with added fluorescein) were trapped by the filter on the air
sampler, which can then be detected using spectrofluorometer. (c) The amount of fluorescein
collected by air samplers 1 and 2 for enclosure barrier with and without suction can then be
compared to the control, i.e. no barrier. Error bars are the standard deviation for triplicates.

We found that for HFNC oxygen therapy with no barrier at QO2 = 60 L min−1 , the
amount of fluorescein collected after 20 minutes by samplers 1 and 2 are 15 ± 5 ng and 11
± 6 ng, respectively (Fig. 3c). With a passive barrier and no suction (corresponding to case
d in Figure 2c), the amount of fluorescein collected by samplers 1 and 2 were reduced by
about 60% to 5 ± 2 and 4 ± 1 ng, respectively. At maximum suction of Qsuction = 120 L

min−1 (corresponding to case e in Figure 2c), the amount of fluorescein reaching the two
samplers were reduced by 99% to 0.15 ± 0.08 and 0.19 ± 0.01 ng.

CONCLUSIONS

We have established the criterion for eﬀective containment of aerosol for barrier enclosure,
namely that the suction rate must exceed the oxygen flow rate and the expiration rate of
the human breath. We show explicitly that for high flow (60 L min−1 ) nasal cannula oxygen
therapy, it is possible to significantly reduce aerosol exposure outside the enclosure by 99%
with suﬃcient suction (120 L min−1 ). Finally, the concept of barrier enclosure with active
suction is very general and can easily be extended to settings outside of healthcare facilities,
e.g. barrier enclosures can be installed on individual seats on a plane or train for safer travel
during a pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Simulating human breath cycle using a custom-built manikin. A 400 W fog machine,
typically used in entertainment venues, was used to heat up and generate micron-sized
aerosol from a glycerin-water mixture (50 v%) inside a 50 cm × 50 cm × 60 cm box within
3 seconds. See Supporting Figure S2 for the droplet size distribution. Food-grade glycerin
was purhased from a baking shop. A manual resuscitator or an Ambu bag was then used to
transfer the aerosol from the box through the mouth of the manikin into the barrier. The
Ambu bag was compressed by hand and the volume pushed out during each compression
cycle (0.63 ± 0.3 L) was determined by releasing the expelled air into a jar filled with water
and measuring the volume of water displaced. The length of the compression cycle (3 s)
was chosen to closely mimic the physiological parameters of the human breath. We did not
find significant diﬀerence in the expelled volumes between diﬀerent human operators. In a

typical experiment, the Ambu bag was compressed for 3 seconds and released for another
3 seconds to mimic continuous breathing out of aerosol for 20 minutes. A metronome was
used to help the operator keep in time.
Fluorescein quantification. Aerosol (glycerol-water droplets with fluorescein) in the air
was collected using a SASS 3100 Air Sampler from Research International running at a
flow rate of 60 L min−1 for 20 min. SASS 3100 air sampler has been used previously to
collect bioaerosols from the air [16]. The filter paper was then placed in 2 mL of deionized
(DI) water inside a tube and shaken with a vortex mixer for 1 min to dissolve the trapped
fluorescein. Fluorescein has an excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 514 nm,
respectively. The fluorescein concentration (and hence the amount of fluorescein) in the 2
mL solution was then determined using a spectrofluorometer (Duetta, HORIBA scientific)
by comparing its fluorescence intensity at 514 nm with those from calibration standards of
known concentrations. The minimum concentration that can be measured using spectrofluorometer is 0.02 µg L−1 or 0.04 ng in 2 mL solution.
