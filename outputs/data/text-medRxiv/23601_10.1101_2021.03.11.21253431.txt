Summary
Background: To avoid exhaustion of medical resources by COVID-19, policy-makers
must predict care needs, specifically the proportion of severe cases likely to need
ventilator care.
Objective: This study was designed to use a statistical model to elucidate dynamics of
severe cases in Tokyo and to discuss the timing of effective policy activation.
Methods: The study extended from April 27 through October 18, 2020 in Japan’s Tokyo
Metropolitan area. Medical exhaustion was defined as use of more than half of the
ventilator capacity available before the COVID-19 outbreak. We regressed the number
of severe cases on the newly onset patients of more than 14 days prior. As earlier
research indicated, the COVID-19 severity changed at the end of May. Therefore, we
added dummy variables to reflect changing severity from June and its product with
newly onset patients as the explanatory variable. Then we calculated the threshold using
R(t): R(t)=0.99 for the number of patients 14 days prior was used as a threshold at
which strong countermeasures should be activated to keep to avoid medical exhaustion.
Results: The critical number signaling medical exhaustion in Tokyo was defined as 655
cases. We selected 15, 30, 60 and 90 days prior as explanatory variables for explaining
the number of severe cases. A coefficient of determination larger than 0.95 was inferred

as indicating good fit. The threshold was estimated as more than 4500 cases for
R(t)=1.1 and monotonically decreasing by R(t) to be 600 cases for R(t)=2.5.
Discussion and Conclusion: Results showed that newly onset patients reported more
than 14 days prior can explain the number of severe cases very well. We also confirmed
the threshold number of patients 14 days prior by R(t) for which strong countermeasures
should be activated to avoid medical exhaustion with R(t)=0.99. This method is
expected to be useful for countermeasure activation policies for Tokyo.

Introduction

2

As of October 28, 2020, the World Health Organization reported more than 42

3

million confirmed COVID-19 cases and about 1.15 million deaths worldwide (1). In

4

Japan, the outbreak reached its peak at the end of July. By October 29, 2020,

5

approximately 100 thousand cases and 1.7 thousand deaths had been reported (1).

6

For the 29,601 cases reported from February 1 through August 5, 2020, the

7

case–fatality rate (CFR) was low for people 59 years old and younger. Nevertheless,

8

among patients 60 years old and older, CFR was found to increase with age. Similarly,

9

probabilities of ICU admission and ventilator use increased rapidly with age (2).

10

Patients with underlying diseases such as hypertension or diabetes constituted high-risk

11

groups for severe cases of COVID-19 (3,4).

12

The Japanese government set guidelines for countermeasures against COVID-19 on

13

August 28, emphasizing caution for elderly people and high-risk individuals with

14

underlying diseases (5). Based on those guidelines, medical resource allocations

15

thereafter emphasized high-risk groups, including elderly people, rather than patients

16

with mild symptoms or asymptomatic patients.

17

Given these circumstances, understanding and predicting the proportion of severe

18

cases requiring ventilator treatment are necessary for policy makers if a strong policy

19

requiring self-restriction of travel is to be made, or if customer-service businesses must

20

be closed. Therefore, this study was conducted to elucidate the dynamics of severe cases

21

in Tokyo, with discussion of the timing of activating countermeasure policies.

22

Although we applied mathematical models to outbreaks of COVID-19 in Japan,

23

such models are unable to explain why the outbreak reached a peak at the end of July

24

under conditions of no herd immunity or lock-down. Actually, at that time in late July,

25

the Japanese government had encouraged domestic travel and thereby promoted the

26

spread of the outbreak. Nevertheless, the outbreak was contained in August. Therefore,

27

to date, no mathematical model has been able to explain the outbreak in Japan. Instead,

28

we examined a statistical model rather than a mathematical model to explain the course

29

of the outbreak. We propose some thresholds that are useful to signal activation of

30

strong countermeasures.

31

32

Methods

33

Severe cases of COVID-19 were defined as requiring hospitalization of patients

34

with required use of a ventilator. The study period extended from April 27, when severe

35

cases under the current definition began to be reported in Tokyo, to October 18, 2020.

36

The Tokyo Metropolitan area of Japan was the study area. Medical exhaustion was

37

defined as patients using more than half of the ventilator capacity available before the

38

COVID-19 outbreak.

39

We regressed the number of severe cases on the newly onset patients reported more

40

than 14 days prior. As earlier studies have indicated, the severity of COVID-19 changed

41

at the end of May. Therefore, we added dummy variables to reflect changing severity

42

from June and its product with newly onset patients as an explanatory variable. We

43

selected a formula maximizing the adjusted coefficient of determination.

44

Then, we calculated the threshold by assuming constant R(t) after October 19, 2020.

45

The timing of R(t)=0.99 was assessed for activation of strong countermeasures to avoid

46

medical facility exhaustion, with activation occurring when the number of patients 14

47

days prior reached this criterion level. Medical facility exhaustion was defined as

48

patients requiring ventilator use exceeding half of the ventilator capacity available

49

before the COVID-19 outbreak.

50

The study period for the epidemic curve of symptomatic patients was January 16,

51

2020 through October 18, 2020. For severe cases, it was April 27, 2020, when severe

52

cases were defined as patients who needed ventilators, through October 18, 2020.

53

Because incubation periods and delays of reporting varied after onset of symptoms, data

54

of the prior month were expected to be underreported. Therefore, we did not use the

6

55

final month of data available to us. However, collection of data of patients using a

56

ventilator started April 27 in Tokyo. Therefore, data of ventilator usage on or before

57

April 26 were not used for this study. The study area was metropolitan Tokyo, with 14

58

million residents. The epidemic curve and information about severe cases in Tokyo

59

were provided by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government (6).

60

We also performed out of sample prediction assuming that R(t) will be constant

61

from October 19, 2020. We calculated the threshold to activate strong policy measures

62

for reducing R(t) to be 0.99 for the number of newly onset patients in a day in terms of

63

R(t). Such measures might include some requirements of voluntary restrictions against

64

going out of the home or shutting down customer-service businesses. Under such

65

policies, one can expect to avoid exhaustion of medical resources and keep the need for

66

ventilators lower than 655.

67

Finally, to evaluate the model’s predictive power, we performed out of sample

68

forecasting prospectively for 21 days from December 3, 2020. The parameters for

69

forecasting were fixed. The estimation result used data obtained through October 18,

70

2020.

73

All information used for this study was collected under the Law of Infection

74

Control, Japan. Published data were used. Therefore no ethical issue is posed by the

75

procedures used to conduct this study.

76

77

Results

78

In Tokyo, we observed 3,072 patient days of ventilator use from April 27, 2020

79

through the end of July. From January 16, 2020 through the end of July, 11,619 patients

80

with symptoms were reported.

81

Because Tokyo had 2,456 ventilators before the COVID-19 outbreak and because

82

1,310 ventilators were unused by patients (7), if patients needing ventilators were to

83

become more numerous than 655, the situation would be designated as medical facility

84

exhaustion.

85

Figure 1 depicts severe cases and newly onset patients. Severe cases fluctuate with

86

a longer lag than the onset patients. The estimation results are presented in Table 1.

87

Because 120 days before April 27 was earlier than January 16, when the initial case in

88

Tokyo showed onset, the specification with onset patients 120 days prior includes fewer

89

observations than other specifications. Based on adjusted coefficients of determination,

90

we selected the model with up to 90 days prior. Its adjusted coefficient of determination

91

was higher than 0.95. Figure 2 depicts the observed and fitted numbers of severe cases.

92

It is apparent that these were almost equal to one another.

93

The estimated thresholds of the number of patients 14 days prior by R(t) in which

94

the timing of activation of strong countermeasures to be R(t)=0.99 should be activated

95

to avoid medical exhaustion are shown at Figure 3. The threshold was estimated as

96

more than 4500 for R(t)=1.1, decreasing monotonically by R(t) to be 600 for R(t)=2.5.

97

Figure 4 depicts out of sample forecasting prospectively for 21 days from

98

December 3, 2020 through February 23, 2021. The observed peak was January 20, 2021,

99

but the peak in forecasting was January 29, 2021. Before the peak date, forecasting was

100

significantly lower than the observed figure, except for early December. However, after

101

the peak date, no significant difference was found among them.

102

103

Discussion

104

Many mathematical models have been applied to the outbreak of COVID-19

105

worldwide (8,9). Unfortunately, these have not succeeded in explaining the course of

106

COVID-19 outbreaks.

107

Especially, in Japan, two peaks were experienced through October. The first peak

108

was that of earlier April; the second one was at the end of July. The first peak might

9

109

explain the mathematical model with restriction of going out (10) because, since

110

mid-March, the rate of going out declined, as shown in Apple data. However, the

111

second peak is inexplicable by the mathematical model. Herd immunity, of course, was

112

not achieved. No lock-down was activated in Japan at all. Probably, the “new normal”

113

lifestyle with mask-wearing, social distancing, and restrictions against numerous dining

114

or night-life establishments became common.

115

Actually, at that time, the government encouraged domestic travel. It promoted the

116

spread of the outbreak. However, the outbreak was contained in August. Therefore, to

117

date, no mathematical model has been sufficient to explain the outbreak in Japan. The

118

policy for severe cases cannot be discussed using mathematical models.

119

Instead, we used a statistical model. It might always show some association of

120

variables for which there is no causality. We showed clear association among severe

121

cases and patients who had experienced onset 15 days prior. Moreover, we showed the

122

threshold of the number of patients 14 days prior by R(t), for which the timing of

123

activation of strong countermeasures to be R(t)=0.99 should be activated to avoid

124

medical exhaustion. Therefore, the statistical model was probably more useful than the

125

mathematical model for countermeasures against COVID-19.

126

Regarding the increase phase in June and July, the number of newly onset patients

10

127

increased from about 10 to 350 during 60 days. If one assumes an average incubation

128

period to be about 6 (10), then the average R(t) during this period was

129

1.43=(350/10)^(6/60). Figure 3 depicts the threshold as around 2200 at R(t)=1.43. The

130

peak at the end of July was 350. Therefore, the peak at the end of July accounted for

131

only 16% of the threshold.

132

We used no information before t-14. Reporting was usually delayed from onset up

133

to 31 days (10). Therefore, the number of newly onset patients at the same day was that

134

which was usually developing dynamically for at least two weeks. Information of the

135

final two weeks prior to the estimate is not reliable. Therefore, we ignored information

136

during the final two weeks of the study period. Moreover, because the epidemic curve

137

changes gradually, information related to day t is closely correlated with information

138

related to day t-1. Therefore, we used no information related to consecutive days. We

139

used the number of newly onset patients with 15–30 day intervals as explanatory

140

variables.

141

Prospective out of sample forecasting in Figure 4 shows good fit. Especially in the

142

declining phase, it fits very well. Therefore, results demonstrated that the estimated

143

model can predict outcomes well for 21 days.

144

Some limitations might have affected this study. First, we used dummy variables

11

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.11.21253431; this version posted March 12, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

145

after June to reflect the disease’s decreasing severity. However, we do not understand

146

the reason why. It might be attributable to mutations of the COVID-19 virus.

147

Alternatively, treatment for patients might have improved since June. Or younger and

148

therefore milder patients accounted for a larger proportion of the patients than before

149

June. Moreover, the severity of the disease would decrease if a new drug were

150

developed. It might alternatively increase if some mutation were to strengthen its

151

pathogenicity. Severity should be monitored to improve the fit of the statistical model.

152

Secondly, definitions of severe cases differed among prefectures, even in Japan.

153

Moreover, they probably varied among countries. It remains unknown whether the

154

approach used for the present study is applicable to other prefectures than Tokyo or

155

other countries with other definitions of severity. We should check the robustness of

156

usefulness of the statistical model in other areas in Japan or other countries.

157

Thirdly, we might specifically examine only elderly patients or patients older than

158

50 as explanatory variables. If the reason for lower severity after June was the larger

159

proportion of younger patients, then it might be controlled by specifically examining

160

elderly patients as a high risk group. Exploration of that point remains as a challenge for

161

future research efforts.

Conclusion
Results demonstrated that

newly onset patients more than 14 days prior can

165

explain the number of severe cases very well. The prospective out of sample forecasting

166

used for this study can predict observations well for 21 days. Results also show a

167

threshold of the number of patients 14 days prior by R(t). Timing of the activation of

168

strong countermeasures should be R(t)=0.99 to avoid medical facility exhaustion. That

169

signal might be useful for countermeasure activation in Tokyo. Careful real-time

170

monitoring of R(t) and newly onset patients are expected to be extremely important for

171

timing of the activation of strong policy measures.

Note: t-x (x=15,30,60,90, and 120) indicates the number of newly onset patients x days

3

before. Panel lower than “Cross term with dummy variable for after June” shows cross

4

term with dummy variable for after June and he number of newly onset patients x days

5

before. The most left specification with t-120 has fewer observations than other

6

specification because 120 day before from April 27 was earlier than January 16 when

7

the initial case in Tokyo was onset. Based on adjusted coefficients of determinant, we

8

selected the model with up to 90 days before
