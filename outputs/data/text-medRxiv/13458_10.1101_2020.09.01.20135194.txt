Transmission dynamics and secondary attack rates
28

Abstract:

29

Background Reports suggest that asymptomatic individuals (those with no symptoms at all

30

throughout infection) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are

31

infectious, but the extent of transmission based on symptom status requires further study.

32

Purpose This living review aims to critically appraise available data about secondary attack rates

33

from people with asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

34

Data sources Medline, EMBASE, China Academic Journals full-text database (CNKI), and pre-

35

print servers were searched from 30 December 2019 to 3 July 2020 using relevant MESH terms.

36

Study selection Studies that report on contact tracing of index cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection

37

in either English or Chinese were included.

38

Data extraction Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality and risk

39

of bias. We calculated the secondary attack rate as the number of contacts with SARS-CoV-2,

40

divided by the number of contacts tested.

41

Data synthesis Of 927 studies identified, 80 were included. Summary secondary attack rate

42

estimates were 1% (95% CI: 0%-2%) with a prediction interval of 0-10% for asymptomatic index

43

cases in 10 studies, 7% (95% CI: 3%-11%) with a prediction interval of 1- 40% for pre-

44

symptomatic cases in 11 studies and 6% (95% CI: 5%-8%) with a prediction interval of 5- 38%

45

for symptomatic index cases in 40 studies. The highest secondary attack rates were found in

46

contacts who lived in the same household as the index case. Other activities associated with

47

transmission were group activities such as sharing meals or playing board games with the index

48

case, regardless of the disease status of the index case.

49

Limitations We excluded some studies because the index case or number of contacts were

50

unclear.

51

Conclusion Asymptomatic patients can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others, but our findings

52

indicate that such individuals are responsible for fewer secondary infections than people with

53

symptoms.

Transmission dynamics and secondary attack rates
58

Introduction:

59

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) demonstrates efficient

60

transmission in populations without effective public health interventions; basic reproduction

61

numbers (R0) values range between 2-3 [1]. While asymptomatic transmission has been

62

described as the “Achilles’ heel” of control efforts during this pandemic, the extent to which

63

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by people without symptoms drives this pandemic remains

64

uncertain [2]. SARS-CoV-2 infection that is asymptomatic at the time of laboratory testing is

65

widely reported [3]; however, studies that follow infected people over time suggest that many

66

infections are not asymptomatic throughout the entire disease course, and a large proportion of

67

these individuals ultimately develop a diverse range of symptoms [4-7]. For instance, Sugano et

68

al. reported a detailed cluster outbreak in music clubs in Japan, where asymptomatic cases

69

reported also included pre-symptomatic cases [8]. A living systematic review of studies published

70

up to 10 June 2020 estimated that 20% (95% CI 17 to 25%) of people who become infected with

71

SARS-CoV-2 remain asymptomatic throughout infection [7].

72

One of the barriers to understanding the role of asymptomatic transmission is the lack of

73

consistency in case definitions [9]. While symptom severity exists on a spectrum, individuals

74

infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be miscategorized as asymptomatic, when they have milder or

75

atypical symptoms leading to overestimation of the proportion without symptoms [3, 10]. For

76

instance, in a detailed study of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Iceland where individuals deemed at

77

high risk for COVID-19 including those with a consistent syndrome were screened in a targeted

78

manner, and other individuals were tested via a population screening mechanism, more than a

79

third in the second group reported symptoms potentially consistent with COVID-19 [3]. However,

80

it is increasingly becoming clear that some individuals experience more diverse symptoms,

81

including taste and smell disturbance or myalgia, either for the entire course of illness or

82

preceding respiratory symptoms. These symptoms can be so mild and insidious that they do not

83

limit patients’ daily activities [4, 11]. The situation is further complicated by subjective patient

84

perception and differences between studies in the elicitation and reporting of symptoms.

Transmission dynamics and secondary attack rates
85

There are reports describing asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 who are infectious [12]

86

and who have infected one or more contacts [13], but the extent and significance of

87

asymptomatic transmission requires further understanding. The aim of this review is to

88

summarize the available evidence about secondary attack rates (defined as the probability that

89

an infected individual will transmit the disease to a susceptible individual) amongst the contacts

90

of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 with different symptom status to provide information about how

91

contagious they are, and their role in driving the pandemic.

92
93

Methods:

94

Systematic review was registered in PROSPERO on 8 June 2020 (CRD42020188168) and will

95

be updated 4-6 months according to the availability of new evidence as a living systematic

96

review [14]. The larger review aims to answer transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. The

97

analysis in this report addresses one of the review questions; to identify secondary attack rate

98

based on symptom status.

99
100

Definitions

101

We defined “asymptomatic” as an individual with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection but

102

without symptoms throughout their entire course of infection, or after 14 days of follow up;

103

“paucisymptomatic” as an individual with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with mild

104

symptoms, and “pre-symptomatic” as an individual who reports no symptoms at the time of the

105

initial positive test result, but who subsequently develops symptoms attributable to COVID-19.

106

We used these definitions to categorize the index cases. Secondary attack rate was defined as

107

the number of new SARS-CoV-2 infection cases among susceptible contacts of primary cases

108

divided by the total number of susceptible contacts.

109
110

Search Strategy

111

We retrieved articles about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection through systematic searches

112

of eight databases: Medline, EMBASE, Europe PMC, Web of Science, SCOPUS, Chinese

113

database (CNKI), and preprint servers (MedRxiv, BioRxiv) using relevant Medical Subject

Headings (MeSH) terms (Supplementary material). The initial search was completed from 30

115

December 2019 to 21 May 2020, searches were repeated on 8 June 2020 and 3 July 2020,

116

owing to the rapidly increasing numbers of studies.

118

Study Selection

119

Studies were eligible if they met the inclusion criteria: (1) report on Coronavirus disease 2019

120

(COVID-19) or SARS-CoV-2 infection and (2) report an outbreak investigation or contact tracing

121

study. Exclusion criteria were: (1) review articles; (2) observational studies providing only the

122

proportion of individuals infected; (3) studies that do not indicate the number of contacts or

123

secondary infections; and (4) reports in media sources. We also manually screened the

124

references of the included original studies and reviews to identify additional eligible studies.

125
126

Data Extraction

127

Two authors (XQ and AIN) independently reviewed reports by title and abstract for relevance,

128

with at least 20% of all reports being screened in duplicate to ensure consistency. Two authors

129

then independently read the full text report of all studies not excluded by title and abstract, to

130

consider eligibility for inclusion. Any disagreements regarding study inclusion were resolved

131

through discussion with a third author (MC). Data were extracted onto a standardized form. From

132

each study, the following variables were extracted: the name of the first author, year of

133

publication, country, sample size, details of index cases (categorised as asymptomatic, pre-

134

symptomatic and symptomatic); event details such as environment, transmission details; number

135

of contacts, number of secondary cases. If these data were not reported, we contacted authors

136

to request them and checked with the authors about all symptoms that they sought.

137
138

Risk of bias in included studies

139

Two authors (XQ and AIN) independently assessed completeness of reporting and risks of bias,

140

using an adapted version of the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case

141

Series (Supplementary material). Any disagreements were resolved through discussion with a

142

third author (MC).

Data synthesis and statistical analysis

145

The studies are summarized in text and table form, descriptive statistics were completed for key

146

outcome measures. Secondary attack rates were computed from raw data in each study, dividing

147

the number of infected contacts of primary cases by the total number of susceptible exposed

148

contacts. A pooled analysis was carried out to generate summary estimates for the secondary

149

attack rate in each subgroup analyzed (asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic index

150

cases), in the framework of a random effect model. The Freeman – Tukey double-arcsine

151

variance-stabilizing transformation was used to combine data, due to its advantage over log and

152

logit transformations which did not allow to compute the proportion in the presence of zero event

153

counts [15]. Secondary attack rates are presented as a proportion along with 95% CIs in forest

154

plots. Heterogeneity between study estimates was gauged by means of the Cochran’s Q and I2

155

statistic: an I2 value above 75% indicates high heterogeneity [16]. Moreover, a 95% prediction

156

interval is displayed in the forest plots, which is an index of dispersion, providing information on

157

how widely the true effect size varies. It can also provide the range of values in which a future

158

observation will fall [17]. Analyses were performed though the software MetaXL version 5.3

159

(Ersatz, EpiGear International, Sunrise Beach, Australia) [18].

160
161

Results:

162

The systematic search identified 927 potentially relevant articles and 789 records were screened

163

after removal of duplicates. Of 187 articles retrieved for full-text review and assessed for

164

eligibility, 80 studies were included in the systematic review, and among those we identified 69

165

studies that indicated the symptom status of index case(s). In this analysis, we excluded 11

166

studies that reported asymptomatic and symptomatic index cases together or no symptom status

167

of the index case was available. We re-classified three studies from asymptomatic to pre-

168

symptomatic as the index cases developed symptoms later during the disease course after

169

reviewing the details and contacting the authors [19-21]. The number of selected papers at each

170

step of the screening and eligibility are reported in the flow diagram (Figure 1).

Summary of secondary attack rates of asymptomatic index cases

173

Ten studies were included in the quantitative analysis (Table 1) [6, 13, 22-29]. Summary

174

secondary attach rate estimate was 1% (95% CI: 0%-2%) with a prediction interval ranged of 0-

175

10% (Figure 2). All except one tested all close contacts for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of

176

symptoms [26]. Cheng et al. only tested symptomatic cases, but they also tested high risk

177

populations regardless of symptoms including the household and hospital contacts [26]. Six

178

studies reported on household contacts, two studies included hospital contacts and two studies

179

included non-household close contacts.

180
181

Three studies identified no secondary cases after following up 17, 91 and 455 close contacts of

182

asymptomatic index cases (asymptomatic secondary attack rate of 0%) [24-26]. Of those, two

183

studies demonstrated higher symptomatic secondary attack rates; Cheng et al. demonstrated

184

that mild cases had a secondary attack rate of 3.8% (95% CI 1.1, 12.8%) and severe cases had

185

4% (95% CI 1.0, 15.8%) secondary attack rate [26], while Park et al. showing household

186

symptomatic secondary attack rate of 16.2% (95% CI 11.6, 22.0%) [24]. In another study, 305

187

contacts of 8 asymptomatic cases were followed up, identifying one secondary case (secondary

188

attack rate 0.3% (95% CI 0.0, 1.8%) [28]. In the same study, attack rates from index cases with

189

mild, moderate and severe diseases were 3.3%, 5.6% and 6.2%, respectively. Zhang et al.

190

followed up 119 close contacts of 12 asymptomatic index cases and identified one secondary

191

case, an asymptomatic secondary attack rate of 0.8% (95% CI 0.0, 4.6). In the same study, the

192

secondary attack rate was 3.5% (95% CI 1.5-8.0) for those with mild, 5.7% (95% CI 2.5, 12.8%)

193

for those with moderate, and 4.5% (95% CI 0.8, 21.8%) for those with severe symptoms [6]. In

194

this study, close contacts that lived with an index case had 12 times the risk of infection as those

195

who did not live with the index case (RR 12.5 - 95% CI 1.6, 100.8) and those who had frequent

196

contact with an index case-patient, and those who had more than 5 contacts had 29 times the

197

risk of infection as those with fewer contacts (RR 29.0 - 95% CI 3.6, 232.3). Two studies

198

indicated an asymptomatic secondary attack rate of 1% and 1.9% [22, 23]. Chaw et al. reported

199

asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic contacts together. The authors clarified that 3 asymptomatic

200

index cases and their 106 close contacts were followed up, leading to 3 secondary cases, a

201

secondary attack rate of 2.8% (95% CI 0.06, 8.0%). In this study, the overall secondary attack

202

rate was 10.6% in the household setting, which was higher for symptomatic cases (14.4%, 95%

203

CI 8·8, 19·9%) than that of asymptomatic cases and for non-household contacts 0.7 (95% CI 0.1,

204

1,3) [13]. Zeng et al. conducted the largest contact tracing study, following up 753 close contacts

205

of asymptomatic index cases and identified one secondary case, an asymptomatic secondary

206

attack rate of 0.13% (95% CI 0.0, 0.7%) [27].

207
208

Summary of pre-symptomatic secondary attack rates

209

Sixteen papers reported either outbreak investigations or contact tracing studies reporting

210

transmission from an index case during the pre-symptomatic period [13, 19, 21, 26, 30-40]

211

(Table 2). Of those, eleven studies were included in the quantitative analysis. The summary SAR

212

estimate was 7% (95% CI: 3%-11%) with a prediction interval of 1 to 40% (Figure 3). These

213

studies followed up 22 to 585 close contacts whose initial exposure occurred before symptom

214

onset of the index case. Even in studies that followed up large numbers of people, including

215

community contacts, the majority of secondary cases identified were from the same household or

216

among friend gatherings. In these studies, having meals together, or playing cards with the index

217

case were exposure activities associated with transmission. The remaining one study reported

218

an outbreak in a restaurant [40] and four studies exclusively reported family cluster outbreaks

219

[30, 32, 33, 39]; these investigations did not test contacts outside the household, and it is

220

challenging to truly differentiate transmission during the pre-symptomatic period from

221

symptomatic transmission in the household setting (Supplementary Figure 1).

222
223

Summary of symptomatic secondary attack rates

224

Forty-six papers reported either outbreak investigations or contact tracing studies reporting

225

transmission from symptomatic index case(s). Of those, 40 reported contact tracing studies

226

reported secondary attack rates ranging from 0% to 38.89% [13, 24, 27, 28, 38, 41-75] and 6

227

reported outbreak investigation [76-80] (Supplementary Table 1). 40 contact tracing studies with

228

44 observations were included in the quantitative analysis (Figure 4). The summary estimate of

229

SAR from symptomatic index subjects was 6% (95% CI: 5%-8%) with a prediction interval of 5-

38%. Of those, 9 studies reported less than 1% secondary attack rates, 2 of those were in

231

healthcare setting, 2 included outdoor interaction, 4 included non-household contacts. Higher

232

frequency of contacts and household contacts were reported to be higher risk than non-

233

household contacts.

234
235

Quality assessment

236

All papers included a clear definition of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, number of

237

secondary cases and number of contacts. The majority of studies identified index cases with a

238

clear diagnosis, had an acceptable case definition and sufficiently followed up close contacts (for

239

a minimum of 14 days). However, in some studies the definition of close contact and setting of

240

transmission was not provided. In addition, it was unclear in four reports whether all potential

241

close contacts were included, therefore, the direction of bias is uncertain. We summarized the

242

quality assessment in Supplementary Table 2.

243
244

Discussion:

245

This systematic review provides comprehensive data on secondary attack rates based on

246

symptom status of the index case(s). While asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus to

247

others [81], the findings from ten studies in this review found summary secondary attack rates of

248

1% with a prediction interval of 0-10% for asymptomatic index cases compared with secondary

249

attack rates of 6% with a prediction interval of 5-38% in symptomatic cases and 7% with a

250

prediction interval of 1-40% in pre-symptomatic case. These findings suggest that individuals

251

who are asymptomatic throughout the disease course are responsible for fewer secondary

252

infections than symptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. Most transmission events were

253

associated with living with the index case or group activities such as sharing meals and playing

254

board games.

255
256

Given the importance of transmission heterogeneity in propagating the pandemic, it is important

257

that we learn about the various factors that contribute to transmission. According to modelling

258

and contact tracing studies, around 80% of secondary infections can be linked to 20% of cases

Transmission dynamics and secondary attack rates
259

which distinguishes SARS-CoV-2 from seasonal influenza, although a similar pattern was also

260

observed in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [82-84]. While there are multiple factors (environmental

261

factors, contact patterns and socioeconomic inequalities) that contribute to this heterogeneity,

262

some evidence starting to emerge about the influence of individual’s infectiousness on

263

transmission dynamics. In this systematic review, we found that index cases with symptoms had

264

a higher secondary attack rate compared with truly asymptomatic index cases. While there is a

265

need to better understand this difference, it may be due to shorter duration of infectiousness. In a

266

living systematic review including of studies published up to 6 June 2020, we found that cases

267

with asymptomatic people had a shorter duration of RNA shedding than symptomatic individuals

268

[85]. Asymptomatic patients may therefore be contagious but for a shorter duration than

269

symptomatic people; this might contribute to lower transmission to their contacts. However, we

270

do not yet know the relative importance of behavioral factors by the host versus environmental

271

factors in determining transmission risk. It is not known whether the size of the cluster of

272

secondary infections would be different according to index case symptom status in a high-risk

273

environment with no mitigation measures in place.

274
275

Modelling studies suggest that it is not possible to have widespread infection without substantial

276

pre-symptomatic transmission. Viral load dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 derived from confirmed

277

cases suggest that peak viral loads are detected at the start of symptom onset up to day 5 of

278

illness, indicating highest infectiousness occurs just before or within the first few days after

279

symptom onset [85]. So far, several contact tracing studies emphasize that the highest risk of

280

transmission occurs during the prodromal phase or early in the disease course [64, 86]. For

281

instance, in a prospective contact tracing study of 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2761

282

close contacts, no secondary cases were identified when the exposure occurred more than 5

283

days after the symptom onset [26]. Our findings therefore have important implications from a

284

public health perspective. In settings such as nursing homes, homeless shelters, prisons, cruise

285

ships and meat-packing plants in which many people spend prolong period of time together in

286

the same environment including sleeping, dining and sharing common facilities, and where

287

several outbreaks have been documented, pre-symptomatic transmission may contribute

Transmission dynamics and secondary attack rates

substantially to transmission [87, 88]. In these settings, when infection develops, most patients

289

are already inside the facility with high viral loads that increase the risk of onward transmission.

290

This highlights the importance of mitigation measures and surveillance in these settings to

291

identify those patients early in the disease course to prevent onward transmission inside the

292

facility.

293
294

This systematic review has several strengths. Firstly, this is a living systematic review examining

295

the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through contact tracing and outbreak investigation studies.

296

Secondly, we only included studies with clear case definitions, which indicated the number of

297

contacts and secondary cases. We excluded studies in which the index case was unclear, or the

298

numbers of contacts were not provided. The estimates from individual studies are also subject to

299

limitations, such as imprecision resulting from small study size, and multiple sources of bias in

300

the estimation of the true secondary attack rate, which are detailed in this paper [89]. Moreover,

301

while the number of index cases could influence the confidence interval estimation for secondary

302

attack rate due to heterogeneity among index cases, we have constructed a prediction interval to

303

yield conservative confidence interval estimates.

304
305

We identified two other systematic reviews that investigated asymptomatic transmission, with

306

different research questions, which results in different search terms and studies retrieved. One

307

living systematic review, which included studies published up to 10 June 2020, identified five

308

studies that directly compared secondary attack rates between asymptomatic and symptomatic

309

index cases; all were included in our review [7]. This study only included studies that provided

310

data to allow relative risks to be estimated. The summary risk ratios for asymptomatic versus

311

symptomatic (0.35, 95% CI 0.10, 1.27) and pre-symptomatic versus symptomatic (0.63, 95% CI

312

0.18, 2.26) are consistent with our findings. The second review estimated only household

313

secondary attack rates and included studies published up to 29 July 2020 [90]. Of three studies

314

that included asymptomatic index cases, two were included in our review. We excluded one of

315

the studies because the number of contacts of asymptomatic index cases was not specified; we

316

have not yet received details of the study after contacting the authors. Advantages of our review

Transmission dynamics and secondary attack rates
317

over these two studies are inclusion of studies published in Chinese, search terms that aimed to

318

capture studies specifically estimating secondary attack rates.

319
320

In summary, whilst asymptomatic transmission is a major concern for SARS-CoV-2 community

321

spread, secondary attack rates from those who remain asymptomatic throughout their course of

322

infection are low suggesting limited infectiousness. Although it is difficult to estimate the

323

proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission, these patients are likely to be highly infectious just

324

before and around the time of symptom onset and appear to transmit efficiently, particularly

325

within households. Given these results, in the context of limited resources, approaches should be

326

targeted predominantly on identifying and immediately isolating patients with prodromal or mild

327

symptoms and their contacts, which may avert a significant number of community transmission

328

clusters [91]. Future clinical studies should incorporate clear definitions and assess a broad

329

range of symptoms associated with COVID-19, include longitudinal follow up of patients, and

330

calculate secondary attack rates for a wider range of settings and populations [9].
