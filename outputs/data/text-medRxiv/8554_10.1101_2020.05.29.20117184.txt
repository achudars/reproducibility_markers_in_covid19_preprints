Abstract
Background: Given the continuing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and much
of the U.S. implementing social distancing due to the lack of alternatives, there has been a push
to develop a vaccine to eliminate the need for social distancing.
Methods: In 2020, we developed a computational model of the U.S. simulating the spread of
COVID-19 coronavirus and vaccination.
Results: Simulation experiments revealed that when vaccine efficacy exceeded 70%, coverage
exceeded 60%, and vaccination occurred on day 1, the attack rate dropped to 22% with daily
cases not exceeding 3.2 million (reproductive rate, R0, 2.5). When R0 was 3.5, the attack rate
dropped to 41% with daily cases not exceeding 14.4 million. Increasing coverage to 75% when
vaccination occurred by day 90 resulted in 5% attack rate and daily cases not exceeding
258,029when R0 was 2.5 and a 26% attack rate and maximum daily cases of 22.6 million when
R0 was 3.5. When vaccination did not occur until day 180, coverage (i.e., those vaccinated plus
those otherwise immune) had to reach 100%. A vaccine with an efficacy between 40% and 70%
could still obviate the need for other measures under certain circumstances such as much higher,
and in some cases, potentially unachievable, vaccination coverages.
Conclusion: Our study found that to either prevent or largely extinguish an epidemic without any
other measures (e.g., social distancing), the vaccine has to have an efficacy of at least 70%.

Introduction
With the continuing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and much of the U.S.
having implemented social distancing measures due to the lack of alternatives, there has been a
push for efforts to develop a vaccine to eliminate the need for social distancing measures.
However, as these vaccine development efforts progress, it is not yet clear what vaccine
efficacies are necessary to achieve this goal. As we have described previously,1, 2 it is important
to determine efficacy thresholds to aim for early on and during a vaccine’s development. This is
especially true in early-stage development when changes can still be implemented more easily.
Currently, there are sixteen vaccine candidates are under clinical phase I-II evaluation and over
100 preclinical candidate vaccines are in the immunization pipeline.3-6 In order to help establish
the ideal goals for the vaccine efficacies needed to prevent and extinguish a COVID-19
coronavirus epidemic, we developed a computational simulation model representing the United
States population, the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and the impact of a vaccine under various
conditions.
Methods
Model Structure
Using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) with the Crystal Ball add-in
(Oracle Corporation, Redwood Shore, CA), we developed a computational model (in 2020)
representing the U.S. population (357,157,434 persons) and their different interactions with each
other as well as the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential health and economic outcomes7.
The model advances in discrete, one-day time steps for 2.5 years (which is the longest duration
of the epidemic in the evaluated scenarios included in our study). On any given day, each
individual in the model is in one of five mutually exclusive SARS-CoV-2 states: 1) susceptible
(S, not infected and able to become infected), 2) exposed (E, infected, but not able to transmit to
others), 3) infectious and asymptomatic (Ia, infected, but without symptoms, and able to transmit
to others), 4) infectious and symptomatic (Is, infected, showing symptoms, and able to transmit
to others), or 5) recovered/immune (R, not infected and unable to become infected). On day one,
a set number of individuals start in the ‘Ia state’ and ‘Is state’ (i.e., seed coronavirus), with the
remainder starting in the ‘S state’. Each day, individuals interact with each other, and a person
that is infectious can potentially transmit the virus to a person who is susceptible. If a susceptible
person comes in contact with an infectious person, he/she moves from the ‘S state’ to the ‘E
state.’ The following equation determines the number of susceptible individuals who became
exposed each day: β*S*Is + (β*0.5)*S*Ia. Beta (β) equals the basic reproduction number (R0;
the average number of secondary cases generated by one infectious case) divided by the
infectious period duration and the number of individuals in the population, ‘S’ and ‘I’ represent
the number of susceptible and infectious persons, respectively, on any given day. Exposed
individuals remain in the ‘E state’ for the latent period duration (i.e., time between exposure and
ability to transmit) before becoming infectious and moving to the ‘I state’ (at a rate of 1/latent

3

period duration). As individuals can transmit the virus prior to disease onset8, we assume they
could transmit one day prior to the start of symptoms. Each individual moving to the ‘I state’ has
a probability of being symptomatic, which governs if they are in the ‘Is’ or ‘Ia state.’ Each person
in the model draws an infectious period duration from a distribution (range: 4-15 days, including
the day prior to symptom onset). Infectious individuals remain in the ‘I state’ until they recover
and are no longer infectious, moving from the ‘I state’ to the ‘R state’ (at the rate of 1/infectious
period duration).
Vaccination occurs on different days during the epidemic (varying with scenario) and protects in
two different ways: by preventing infection and by preventing symptomatic disease (i.e.,
reducing viral shedding). Individuals who are vaccinated move into the ‘V state’. Each day,
vaccinated individuals mix with others and if they come in contact with an infectious person,
they move to the ‘E state’. When the vaccine prevents infection, individuals in the ‘E state’ will
move to the ‘R state’ based on the vaccine efficacy. (Individuals for whom the vaccine is not
effective move to either the ‘Ia state’ or ‘Is state’.) When the vaccine reduces viral shedding, it
reduces their probability of moving to the ‘Is state’ based on the vaccine efficacy. Effectively
vaccinated individuals in the ‘E state’ move to the ‘Ia state’, where they transmit at a lower rate.
We assume vaccination protection to be immediate (i.e., on day of vaccination) and that the
vaccine had no impact on individuals who had already been infected and/or exposed to SARSCoV-2.
Each symptomatically infected person (i.e., COVID-19 case) travels through a probability tree of
different sequential outcomes.7 An infected person showing symptoms starts with a mild
infection and has a probability of seeking ambulatory care or calling his/her physician (i.e.,
telephone consult). This person then has a probability of progressing to severe disease requiring
hospitalization. If this person has only mild illness and is not hospitalized, he/she self-treats with
over-the-counter medications and misses school or work for the duration of symptoms. If this
person is hospitalized, he/she has a probability of developing severe pneumonia or severe nonpneumonia symptoms and has a probability of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. This patient
then has a probability of having either sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
with or without sepsis. If this patient has ARDS, he/she requires the use of a ventilator. If the
person is hospitalized, he/she has a probability of dying from COVID-19 complications. The
person accrues relevant costs and health effects as he/she travels through the model.
The third-party payer perspective includes direct costs (e.g., ambulatory care, hospitalization),
while the societal perspective includes direct and indirect (i.e., productivity losses due to
absenteeism and mortality) costs. Hourly wage across all occupations9 serves as a proxy for
productivity losses. Absenteeism results in productivity losses for the duration of symptoms.
Death results in the net present value of productivity losses for missed lifetime earnings based on
annual wage9 for the years of life lost based on an individual’s life expectancy.10

Data Sources
Appendix Table 1 shows key model input parameters, values, and sources. All costs, clinical
probabilities, and durations were age-specific when available and come from scientific literature
or nationally representative data sources. Age-specific COVID-19 data are specific to the US
context as of March 16, 2020.11 We report all costs in 2020 values, discounting all past and
future values using a 3% rate. We parameterized seeding SARS-CoV2-infected persons into the
population for a given R0 such that simulated cases reflected case data reported as of March 24,
2020.11
Modeled Scenarios and Sensitivity Analyses
We evaluated the impact of introducing a vaccine with varying efficacies in the absence of other
measures from the third-party payer and societal perspectives. Experiments consisted of 1,000
trial Monte Carlo simulations, varying parameters throughout their range (Appendix Table 1).
Our initial scenario assumes an unmitigated epidemic with no vaccination. Experimental
scenarios consisted of vaccinating individuals to either prevent infection or prevent symptomatic
disease. Sensitivity analyses varied the vaccine efficacy (20%-100%), population coverage
(those vaccinated and those otherwise immune, 50%-100%), timing of vaccination (0-180 days
from the epidemic start), and R0 (2.5-3.5).12-14 We report results as the median and 95%
uncertainty interval (UI).
Results
No Vaccine
Figures 1-2 (and Appendix Figure 1) show the resulting number of persons infected with SARSCoV-2 over time (i.e., epidemic curves) when the R0 was 2.5 and 3.5 in the absence of
vaccination, while Table 1 (and Appendix Table 2) show the number of cases, clinical outcomes,
resources used, and costs over the duration of the epidemic. When the R0 of the virus was 2.5,
the total attack rate was 86% with a maximum number of daily SARS-CoV-2 infections (i.e.,
epidemic peak) of 45.0 million. A higher R0 of 3.5, resulted in a total attack rate of 96% with
72.7 million cases at the epidemic peak.
20% Vaccine Efficacy
Even when R0 was 2.5, which is on the lower range reported, a 20% vaccine efficacy to prevent
infection was not enough to substantially reduce the epidemic, even with 100% coverage. While
reducing the attack rate (to 46%), there were still a total of 143.4 million (95% UI: 134.0-152.5
million) symptomatic cases and 29.7 million (95% UI: 27.8-31.6 million) hospitalizations.
40% Vaccine Efficacy

When the R0 was 2.5, a 40% efficacious vaccine that prevented infection reduced the number of
cases at the peak to 2.3 million with 100% coverage (those vaccinated and those otherwise
immune) and vaccinating within 90 days of the epidemic start (Figure 1a). When covering 100%
of the population, vaccination resulted in 51.6 million (95% UI: 25.3-64.5 million) symptomatic
cases. A 50% coverage reduced the number of cases at the peak by 59% but still resulted in a
total of 154.5 million (95% UI: 147.5-161.9 million) symptomatic cases. Vaccinating on day 180
had no impact. When R0 was 3.5 (Figure 2a), a 40% efficacious vaccine reduced the number of
cases at the peak by 67-83% with a coverage of 75% to 100% (Table 1).
If only reducing viral shedding (Appendix Figure 1a), a 40% vaccine efficacy resulted in a total
of 122.5 million (95% UI: 118.2-126.9 million) symptomatic cases even with 100% coverage.
60% Vaccine Efficacy
A 60% efficacious vaccine that prevented infection decreased the number of cases at the peak by
85-99% and stretch out the epidemic duration by ³2 months when R0 was 2.5-3.5 with coverages
³75% (Figures 1b and 2b). For example, when R0 was 2.5, vaccination with 100% coverage on
day 1 resulted in 2,449 (95% UI: 2,151-2,819) symptomatic cases, 89 (95% UI: 67-109) patients
requiring a ventilator, and 2,815 (95% UI: 2,459-3,226) hospital bed days, costing $9.4 million
in direct medical costs and $30.2 million in productivity losses. A 50% population coverage
reduced the number of cases at the peak to 10.7 million (vs. 45.0 million), resulting in 115.5
million symptomatic cases (Table 1). The impact was robust to changes in the timing of
vaccination, such that vaccinating on day 90 shifted the curve earlier compared to vaccinating on
day 1 but still resulted in a similar magnitude (Figure 2a). However, when vaccinating on day
180, near the peak, vaccination with 100% coverage served to shorten the epidemic duration
(Figure 1b). When R0 was 3.5, vaccination with a 75% coverage (those vaccinated and otherwise
immune) resulted in 103.1 million (95% UI: 95.6-78.9 million) symptomatic cases during the
epidemic. With 100% coverage, vaccination reduced the number of cases at the peak to 1.4
million cases and resulted in an 11% overall attack rate and a total of 34.4 million symptomatic
cases when vaccinating on day 90 (Figure 2b; Table 1).
A vaccine that reduced viral shedding was not enough to effectively control the epidemic, even
when coverage was 100% (Appendix Figure 1b). While reducing the number of cases at the peak
to 20.8 million, there were still a total of 72.6 million symptomatic cases (R0 2.5).
70% Vaccine Efficacy
When preventing infection, vaccinating with a 50% coverage on day 1 reduced the number of
cases at the peak by 83%. A 60% coverage on day 1 largely extinguished the epidemic, reducing
the number of cases at the peak by 93% (to 3.2 million infections), resulting in a 22% attack rate
throughout the epidemic (Figure 2c) and 6.1 million (95% UI: 51.2-68.1 million) symptomatic
cases, costing $938.3 billion (95% UI: $633.3-$1,432 billion) in total costs. A 60% coverage

when vaccinating on day 90, resulted in a 23% attack rate over the epidemic duration and daily
cases did not exceed 3.4 million. When at least 75% of the population was covered on day 1,
vaccination prevented the epidemic and resulted in a total of 90,760 (95% UI: 32,544-647,422)
symptomatic cases, costing $1.4 billion (95% UI: $0.5-$11.0 billion) in total costs (R0 2.5).
When covering at least 75% of the population on day 90, vaccination largely prevented the
epidemic, resulting in an overall 5% attack rate and 13.0 million symptomatic cases (Figure 2c;
Table 1). When R0 was 3.5, covering everyone prevented the epidemic and covering 75% of the
population (those vaccinated and otherwise immune) reduced the number of cases at the peak by
93%, shifting it later into the year by 10 months when vaccinating on day 1 (Figure 2c; Table 1).
With a 50% coverage, vaccinating on day 90 decreased the number of cases at the peak by 69%.
If reducing viral shedding, vaccination reduced the number of cases at the peak by 63%,
resulting in 50.1 million symptomatic cases over the epidemic duration with 100% coverage (R0
2.5; Appendix Figure 1c).
80% Vaccine Efficacy
With an 80% efficacy, a vaccine that prevents infection was reduced the number of cases at the
peak by ³36.6 million SARS-CoV-2 infections and shifted it to later in the year by more than 11
months when R0 was 2.5 with coverages of at least 50% and vaccinating within 90 days of the
epidemic start (Figure 1d; Table 1). Covering 75% of the population resulted in a total of 3,346
(95% UI: 2,946-3,899) symptomatic cases and 3,848 (95% UI: 3,342-4,486) hospital bed days,
costing $12.7 million in direct medical costs and $40.1 million in productivity losses. When R0
was 3.5, 50% coverage of the population reduced the number of cases at the peak by 76% but
still resulted in 123.3 million symptomatic cases during the epidemic (Figure 2d, vaccinating at
epidemic start). A 75% coverage decreased the total attack rate to 12%, resulting in 33.3 million
symptomatic cases during the epidemic when vaccinating on day 90.
If the vaccine only reduced viral shedding, a vaccine efficacy of 80% with 100% coverage
reduced the number of cases at the peak by 32.4 million (R0 2.5), but still resulted in 30.6 million
symptomatic cases, when vaccinating within 90 days of the epidemic start (Appendix Figure 1d;
Appendix Table 2).
100% Vaccine Efficacy
A 100% efficacious vaccine reduced the epidemic peak by ³44.1 million infections and shifted it
³12 months later, even if vaccination occurred 90 after the epidemic started and coverage was
50% (R0 2.5). With a 50% coverage, vaccinating resulted in 33.7 million symptomatic cases and
7.0 million hospitalizations, costing $538.1 billion in total costs during the epidemic. A 75%
coverage at the start of the epidemic resulted in 928 (95% UI: 904-953) symptomatic cases and
1,067 (1,014-1,130) hospital bed days, costing $14.70 million (95% UI: $10.2-$22.0 million) in
total costs. When R0 was 3.5, covering 50% of the population decreased the number of cases at

the peak by 87%, resulting in 86.2 million symptomatic cases, even when vaccinating 90 days
into the epidemic. A 75% coverage prevented the epidemic with 5.4 million symptomatic cases
(2% attack rate) when vaccinating on day 90, and 246 (95% UI: 232-263) symptomatic cases
when vaccinating on day 1.
If the vaccine only reduced viral shedding, covering 100% of the population still resulted in
122.9 million SARS-CoV-2 infections when R0 was 2.5 and 239.8 million SARS-CoV-2
infections when R0 was 3.5 during the epidemic.
Discussion
Our study found that to either prevent or largely extinguish an epidemic without any other
measures (e.g., social distancing), the vaccine has to have an efficacy (i.e., probability of
preventing infection) of at least 70% when vaccination within 90 days of the epidemic start and
covers at least 60% of the population. A 60% coverage would not be unreasonable since a recent
poll by Reuters/Ipsos of 1,215 American adults found that 75% of respondents would get a
coronavirus vaccine if assured it was safe.15 The coverage threshold, which includes those people
who are vaccinated and those people who are immune for other reasons, rises the later
vaccination occurs, until the threshold reaches 100% at the peak of the epidemic. This is
increase is due to the fact that as the epidemic processed the prevalence of infected people is
greater and greater.
There are circumstances that a vaccine with an efficacy between 40% and 70% can obviate the
need for other measures but these require that 75% or more of the population be vaccinated. For
example, when the vaccine efficacy is 60% at least 75% of the population would need to be
vaccinated. If the R0 of the COVID-19 coronavirus goes from 2.5 to 3.5, then this coverage
threshold would increase to 100%.
Our study focused on identifying the efficacy thresholds required to eliminate the need for other
measures (e.g., social distancing) in order for life to "return to normal", because that is a main
concern of the general public.16-20 A vaccine alone may not be able to do this. Nonetheless, a
vaccine with an efficacies lower than the thresholds we identified, could still be useful (e.g., a
vaccine efficacy of 40% could prevent ³2.8 million patients from requiring a ventilator and
³89.5 million hospital bed days).
Limitations
All models, by definition, are simplifications of real-life and cannot account for every possible
outcome.29 Our model inputs drew from various sources, and new data on SARS-CoV2
continues to emerge. The course of an actual COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic may not conform
to our model data and assumptions. For example, we assumed individuals mixed equally with
each other, and that individuals would be vaccinated by a certain day during the epidemic;

however, in reality, individuals may be vaccinated at different time points over the epidemic.
Moreover, assumptions about levels of herd immunity required may depend on differing
individual susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusions
Our study found that to either prevent or largely extinguish an epidemic without any other
measures (e.g., social distancing), the vaccine has to have an efficacy of at least 70% when
vaccination occurs within 90 days of the start of the epidemic and covers at least 60% of the
population. This efficacy threshold increases the deeper one goes into the pandemic. A vaccine
with an efficacy between 40% and 70% can still obviate the need for other measures under
certain circumstances such as much higher, and potentially unachievable, vaccination coverages.
