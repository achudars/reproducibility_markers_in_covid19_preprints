ABSTRACT
Background
The response of the Swedish authorities to the COVID‐19 pandemic was less restrictive than in most countries
during the first year, with infection and death rates substantially higher than in neighbouring Nordic countries.
Because access to PCR testing was limited during the first wave (February to June 2020) and regional data were
reported with delay, adequate monitoring of community disease spread was hampered. The app-based COVID
Symptom Study was launched in Sweden to disseminate real-time estimates of disease spread and to collect
prospective data for research. The aim of this study was to describe the research project, develop models for
estimation of COVID-19 prevalence and to evaluate it for prediction of hospital admissions for COVID-19.
Methods
We enrolled 143 531 study participants (≥18 years) throughout Sweden, who contributed 10·6 million daily
symptom reports between April 29, 2020 and February 10, 2021. Data from 19 161 self-reported PCR tests were
used to create a symptom-based algorithm to estimate daily prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19. The
prediction model was validated using external datasets. We further utilized the model estimates to forecast
subsequent new hospital admissions.
Findings
A prediction model for symptomatic COVID-19 based on 17 symptoms, age, and sex yielded an area under the
ROC curve of 0·78 (95% CI 0·74-0·83) in an external validation dataset of 943 PCR-tested symptomatic
individuals. App-based surveillance proved particularly useful for predicting hospital trends in times of
insufficient testing capacity and registration delays. During the first wave, our prediction model estimates
demonstrated a lower mean error (0·38 average new daily hospitalizations per 100 000 inhabitants per week
(95% CI 0·32, 0·45)) for subsequent hospitalizations in the ten most populated counties, than a model based on
confirmed case data (0·72 (0·64, 0·81)). The model further correctly identified on average three out of five
counties (95% CI 2·3, 3·7) with the highest rates of hospitalizations the following week during the first wave and
four out of five (3·0, 4·6) during the second wave.

INTRODUCTION
In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, this global health crisis has stimulated abundant research that might
help improve our response to future public health challenges. Amongst the most promising is the use of modern
app-based technologies allowing real-time monitoring and prediction of the dynamics of the pandemic. Such an
approach was indeed launched almost simultaneously in the US, UK, and Sweden with the COVID Symptom
Study app 1,2. The Swedish experience of the pandemic, which has received global attention, might be
particularly informative because the public health response to the pandemic was much less restrictive than in
most other countries 3, and also entailed a 4·5 to 10-fold higher death rate up to December 2020 than in
neighbouring Nordic countries 4.
Community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in Sweden in early March 2020 5. By late March,
visits to care homes as well as public gatherings of more than 50 people had been banned, universities and upper
secondary schools had initiated distance learning, and adults were encouraged to work from home if possible.
Other measures recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), such as
household quarantine when one individual in the household had confirmed COVID-19, were not implemented
until the second wave in the autumn 2020. In addition, during the first pandemic wave, PCR testing was only
available for hospital patients and healthcare staff 3, and assessments of national and regional prevalence were
based on a few smaller PCR surveys performed by the Public Health Agency (Folkhälsomyndigheten, FoHM).
Nationwide PCR testing for symptomatic adults was only introduced in June 2020 3 and has since suffered
delays throughout Sweden during periods of high demand.
The aim of the study was to collect symptom data across Sweden, develop models for estimation of symptomatic
COVID-19 prevalence and to evaluate it for prediction of hospital admissions for COVID-19.

METHODS
COVID Symptom Study Sweden
The COVID Symptom Study was launched in Sweden on April 29, 2020, to provide COVID-19 infection
surveillance data and to build a large-scale repeated measures database for COVID-19 research (Figure 1). More
than 166 000 participants (2.4% of the adult population) joined CSSS in the first five weeks after launch. The
non-commercial mobile application used in the study was initially developed by health data science company
ZOE Limited in partnership with King’s College London and Massachusetts General Hospital 1,2, and adapted
for use in Sweden by ZOE Limited in collaboration with Lund University and Uppsala University. The app has
been used to study the contemporary burden and predict future consequences of COVID-19 6-8.
All individuals ≥18 years of age living in Sweden with access to a smart device have been eligible to participate
in the CSSS by downloading the app and providing informed consent. Participants are asked to report year of
birth, sex, height, weight, postal code, if they work in the healthcare sector, and to complete a health survey
including pre-existing health conditions. Subsequently, participants are asked daily (with voluntary response
frequency) if they feel “healthy as normal” or not, and to report the date and result of any COVID-19 PCR or
serology test. If they do not feel healthy, they are asked about an array of symptoms potentially associated with
COVID-19. Questions on COVID-19 vaccinations, added on March 27, 2021, are not included in the current
analysis. All questionnaire variables are presented in Supplementary Table 1, with additional information
available in the Supplementary Material.
In this analysis, we included data from April 29, 2020 to February 10, 2021. Individuals were excluded if they:
1) never submitted a daily report (n=5 931), 2) had missing age or reported an age <18 or >99 (n=801), or 3)
stated their sex as other/intersex (n=236) as this sample size was insufficient for a separate analysis
(Supplementary Table 2). Individuals whose last report was within seven days of joining the study (n=45 483) or
did not provide a valid postal code (n=7 310) were excluded from the prevalence estimation, but included in
model training if they had reported a PCR test and had submitted at least one symptomatic daily report within
seven days preceding or on the test date (n=967). The final study population consisted of 143 531 individuals
(Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1).
Symptom prevalences were investigated in participants with a positive (n=5 178) or negative (n=32 089) PCR
test during 15 days preceding or following the test date. If a participant reported multiple PCR tests during the
study period, only one randomly selected test was included.

Comparison with other data sources
We used external data sources to evaluate the representativeness of the CSSS cohort as a sample of the Swedish
general population. Aggregate population demographic and socioeconomic information was obtained for all
postal code areas from Statistics Sweden 9. We calculated a neighbourhood deprivation index (NDI, lowest =
most disadvantaged) for each postal code based on the proportion of adult inhabitants employed or studying, the
proportion with a university education, and the median yearly net income 10 (for details, see Supplementary
Material). We also obtained data from the Living Condition Surveys in Sweden from 2018-2019 11 on current
smoking status and BMI in the general population.
We compared symptom reporting from CSSS with data collected by NOVUS, a private company which
conducts opinion polls and other surveys using panels recruited by random sampling of the Swedish population
12

. Since March 2020, NOVUS has carried out repeated surveys on COVID-19-related symptoms and healthcare

contacts, not including PCR test results, with a response rate of approximately 70% 13. While in the CSSS
participants report symptoms on the same day they experience them, NOVUS participants report any symptoms
experienced over the past 14 days even if these reflect their baseline health status (Supplementary Material).
Prediction model training
We developed a prediction model to estimate the probability of a positive PCR test in participants with
symptoms. The model was based on participants who reported at least one PCR test between April 29 and
December 31, 2020 and at least one reported candidate symptom within seven days before or on the test date
(n=19 161, of whom 2 586 tested positive). Reports submitted during the first seven days after joining the study
are excluded to reduce participation bias from increased motivation among symptomatic individuals. For
participants who had not submitted daily reports, we assumed the last observation to be current for no more than
seven subsequent days. If a participant submitted more than one report on a given day, all reports were combined
into a single daily report; a symptom was treated as reported if it was mentioned in at least one of these reports.
We used an L1-penalized logistic regression model (LASSO) to select variables predicting symptomatic
COVID-19. The shrinkage parameter was determined using ten-fold cross-validation and set to be the shrinkage
that minimized the cross-validation error most. The starting set of predictors included all symptoms introduced
through May 7, 2020 (excluding hay fever and chills or shivers), as well as their interaction with loss of smell
and/or taste, as the latter constituted the strongest predictor of COVID-19 6. Predictors in the final model were:
fever, persistent cough, diarrhoea, delirium, skipped meals, abdominal pain, chest pain, hoarse voice, loss of

smell and/or taste, headache, eye soreness, nausea, dizzy or lightheaded, red welts on face or lips, blisters on
feet, sore throat, unusual muscle pains, fatigue (mild or severe), and shortness of breath (significant or severe),
interaction terms between 14 of those and loss of smell and taste, as well as age and sex (see Supplementary
Table 3 for model coefficients).
To better assess the time course of symptomatic COVID-19 retrospectively, we constructed a second timedependent model, based on the first model with the addition of restricted cubic splines for calendar time with six
knots placed according to Harrell's recommendations 14 (coefficients in Supplementary Table 4).
Prediction model validation
The models were internally evaluated in terms of discrimination and calibration using the ROC area under the
curve (AUC) estimated by tenfold cross-validation within the dataset from April 29 to December 31, 2020, as
well as based on CSSS data from a time period not used for model training (i.e., January 1 to February 10, 2021).
Model calibration was assessed by plots with expected probabilities divided into deciles. For external validation,
we used data from the CRUSH Covid study, which invites all individuals (≥18 years) to complete a symptom
survey if they have conducted a COVID-19 PCR-test in the Uppsala healthcare county. Using data from October
18, 2020 to February 10, 2021, the classification ability was assessed using ROC analysis among individuals
who had completed the survey on the day of the test, reported at least one symptom, and had a conclusive test
result (n=943; see Supplementary Material and Supplementary Table 5).
Evaluation of prevalence estimates
The daily regional prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 infection was estimated in real-time using a weighted
mean of individual predicted probabilities for a given county weighted by age (<50 and ≥50 years) and sex.
Participants not reporting any of the symptoms included in the prediction model were assigned a probability of
zero. Participants with long-lasting COVID-19 symptoms were excluded after their 30th day of reporting loss of
smell and/or taste to ensure that the estimates were not inflated due to COVID-19 sequelae. We then averaged
the predicted probabilities and the number of participants reported for each subgroup, day, and county.
Prevalence estimates were subsequently reweighed using direct standardization, yielding daily prevalence
estimates for each county.
The odds ratios for all variables in the prediction model were assumed to be generalizable to the background
population. Because the model was trained in a dataset with higher prevalence of COVID-19 compared to the
general population, the intercept was inflated. We therefore recalibrated the model intercept until the nationwide

app-based predictions for 27 May, 2020 matched the estimated nationwide prevalence of 0·3% (95% CI 0·10·5%) between May 25-28, 2020 15. In that survey, performed by FoHM, self-sampling nasal and throat swabs
with saliva samples were delivered to a random sample of 2 957 individuals (details provided in the
Supplementary Material). We assumed both the sensitivity and the proportion of symptomatic COVID-19 in the
FoHM survey to be 70% 16,17.
95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for predictions were generated using the function ageadjust.direct from the
epitools package in R 18, using the method of Fay and Feuer 19. This function accommodates the sum of the
model-generated probabilities, number of participants for each of the four strata on a given day, and the total
population of Sweden. The output is a weighted probability with a 95% CI. The method assumes that the sum of
the model-generated probabilities is Poisson-distributed using an approximation based on the gamma
distribution. Although this method may be regarded as conservative, we assume the FoHM point estimate for
May 25-28, 2020 the PCR sensitivity and the proportion of asymptomatic individuals to be known quantities.
Prediction of cases and hospital visits
To compare CSSS prevalence estimates with reported confirmed cases by FoHM, we extracted a linked dataset
of all COVID-19 cases from SmiNet, an electronic notification system of communicable diseases maintained by
FoHM, where all confirmed cases are registered by law. To evaluate the ability to predict in- and out-patient
hospital visits on a regional level, we acquired data from the National Patient Register from January 1, 2020 to
January 4, 2021. Because the time lag for registrations of COVID-19 hospital visits was upto one month, we
utilized data from the register until December 4, 2020 for these analyses.
We evaluated the agreement of CSSS-estimated prevalence with case notification rates and hospital trends by
inspecting trend plots. We further applied a median regression model with either CSSS-estimated prevalence or
case notification, modelled as linear exposures with new hospital admissions as the dependent variable, assessing
the mean absolute prediction error (lower indicating higher accuracy) for both models during the first and second
wave, respectively, using leave-one-out cross-validation (excluding one week from the model building for each
iteration). We also calculated the Spearman correlation of CSSS prevalence and case notification to
hospitalization the following week, during the first (up to July 6, 2020) and the second (from October 19, 2020)
waves. We defined the end of the first wave based on the date on which there were fewer than three new ICU
COVID-19 admissions per day and the start of the second wave when there were again three or more new ICU

with the five counties with the most new cases and highest hospital notification rates the following week.

RESULTS
Descriptive characteristics
Table 1 shows characteristics of the 143 531 study participants. Compared with the general population, the study
cohort included a larger proportion of women and fewer smokers and people aged ≥65; the cohort had a similar
prevalence of obesity to the national average. The median duration of study participation was 151 days (IQR 52252) with a median of 43 days with submitted reports (IQR 13-119). Thirty percent of participants reported at
least one COVID-19 PCR test during the study period and 20% at least one serology test (Table 1). Six % of
women and 4% of men reported a positive PCR test during the study period. CSSS participants resided in postal
code areas with a higher median NDI, a similar proportion of inhabitants with foreign background, and a higher
population density than the general population. The number of study participants per capita is depicted by county
in Supplementary Figure 2.
The majority of CSSS participants with confirmed COVID-19 experienced loss of smell and/or taste, with
headache, fever, and sore throat constituting other common symptoms (Figure 3a). Among participants who
tested negative, the most common symptoms were headache and sore throat, whereas loss of smell and/or taste
was rarely reported (Figure 3b). The non-adjusted prevalence of different symptoms was considerably higher in
NOVUS than in CSSS, with the exception of loss of smell and/or taste, but temporal trends were similar
(Supplementary Figure 3).
Training and validation of the prediction model
The final model selected by LASSO included 17 symptoms and sex, as well as 2-way interactions between loss
of smell and/or taste and 14 symptoms and a 2-way interaction between loss of smell and/or taste and sex. The
AUC for the main model was 0·76 (95% CI 0·75-0·78) during the training period and 0·72 (95% CI 0·69-0·75)
during the evaluation period from January 1 to February 10, 2021. The AUC for the time-dependent model was
0·84 (95% CI 0·83-0·85) and 0·72 (95% CI 0·69-0·75) for the two time periods, respectively.
Out of the 2 116 participants in the CRUSH Covid study, 943 completed the survey and the COVID-19 test on
the same day, reported at least one of the symptoms included in the CSSS model training, and had a conclusive
test result (144 positive (15.3%)). The AUC for the main model was 0·78 (95% CI 0·74-0·83) and the AUC for
the time-dependent model was 0·75 (95% CI 0·70-0·79). All calibration graphs are available in Supplementary
Figure 4.

Prevalence estimates and prediction of cases and hospitalizations
The prevalence estimates of symptomatic COVID-19 based on data from the CSSS depicted in real-time the first
and second waves of COVID-19 (Figure 4a). In contrast, the SmiNet data on laboratory-confirmed cases of
COVID-19 did not detect the first wave (Figure 5a). Retrospective comparisons with national and regional
register data on COVID-19 hospitalizations showed trends similar to CSSS estimates (Figure 5b, Supplementary
Figures 5a and 5b), with a higher agreement on a national level observed for the retrospective time-dependent
model (Figure 4b).
Overall, the average daily hospitalization rate per week ranged from 0-5 new patients per 100 000 inhabitants
(≥18 years) in the five largest counties in Sweden during the study period (Supplementary figure 5b). During the
first wave, our prediction model estimates demonstrated a lower mean error (0·38 average new daily
hospitalizations per 100 000 inhabitants per week (95% CI 0·32, 0·45)) for subsequent hospitalizations in the ten
most populated counties, than a model based on case notifications from SmiNet (0·72 (0·64, 0·81)). During the
autumn, mean errors were similar (Table 2, Supplementary Table 6). The rank-based correlation of CSSS main
model prevalence with next week hospital admission rate was 0·43 (0·24, 0·62) during the spring and 0·70
(0·49, 0·90) during the autumn of 2020 (Table 2). The main model further successfully identified three (95% CI
2.3, 3.7) out of five counties with the highest rates of hospitalizations the following week during the spring and
four out of five (3.0, 4.6) during the autumn.
We observed a higher estimated prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 in women than in men across the entire
study period, which was most apparent in those aged ≤64 years (Figure 6a). Post-hoc analyses revealed that this
difference was mainly driven by participants who were healthcare professionals, where women were overrepresented (Figure 6b).

DISCUSSION
In this study, our main findings were two-fold. Firstly, app-based prediction estimates allowed for monitoring of
COVID-19 prevalence on county level in Sweden before the general PCR testing programme was initiated and
during gaps in reporting, and secondly, the prediction model could be used to forecast new COVID-19
hospitalizations.
Syndromic surveillance of a novel virus also enables study participants to report an array of symptoms which
allows detection of new disease-specific symptoms 6 and symptom clusters associated with disease severity 21 or
duration 7. In the CSSS data, we observed that the most prevalent symptom in participants with PCR-confirmed
COVID-19 was loss of smell and/or taste, which was rare in participants who tested negative, thus expanding
and confirming other reports on COVID-19 symptomatology. In the event that novel SARS-CoV-2 variants are
associated with other symptoms or symptom clustering, this change will also be captured in CSSS app data.
Covid Symptom Study data from the UK successfully identified hotspots in England, with findings validated in
UK Government test data 8. The CSSS identified a large proportion of the Swedish counties with highest hospital
admissions the following week and predicted new hospital admissions with moderate accuracy. Similar to the
UK, we found higher agreement to external hospital data sources during autumn with regards to ranking of
regions compared with spring 2020. However, only the last part of the spring wave 2020 was captured because
the study was initiated in late April.
The CSSS data collection method allowed rapid data analysis and dissemination of results. National and regional
CSSS prediction estimates from interim models were shared daily with the public via the CSSS dashboard 22. In
addition, weekly summaries have been sent to health care leaders across Sweden since May 2020. In contrast, we
estimate that the time interval between the first presentation of symptoms, confirmation via PCR testing, and the
reporting of COVID-19 test data on the county and municipality level from the FoHM has taken at least 10 days
throughout the study period, with larger delays during weekends, holidays and problems with the national
SmiNet register during suspected data breaches. Furthermore, CSSS data have proven valuable when testing
capacity is suddenly compromised, as happened in the fourth most populated county in Sweden during
November 2020 23. Prevalence estimates derived from the CSSS data were valid during that period, as confirmed
by the concurrent pattern of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the county. This highlights the need of multiple data
sources for optimal surveillance.

More than 166 000 participants (2.4% of the adult population) joined CSSS in the first five weeks after launch,
supporting the feasibility of large-scale app-based surveillance, which can be rapidly scaled-up without needing
additional staff or costly resources. The highest rates of participation were in areas where the study’s two
founding universities are located (Supplementary Figure 5). Run as an academic initiative, the CSSS received
some media attention in national and local press, but it was only explicitly endorsed by a handful of public health
leaders. In a survey, only 18% of adults tested for COVID-19 in one of Sweden’s larger cities, Uppsala, had
heard about the CSSS app. However, among those aware of the CSSS, about half said they were already
participants.
CSSS sought to fulfil the core principles of citizen science 24 by allowing participation in multiple stages of the
scientific process, including defining research questions and study design, gathering and analysing data, and
communicating results. Participant feedback through the CSSS Facebook page, email, and natural language
processing of free-text symptom reporting was used to improve the content and design of the app and to expand
the scope of the research questions. The CSSS dashboard received >8 000 visits per month, and our CRAN R
package covidsymptom 25 for downloading aggregate data was downloaded >900 times (as of April 2021) and
has been used by public health decision makers.
Although the use of a smart device app is intended to minimize barriers to enrolment 26, a lesser proportion of
CSSS participants were male, aged ≥65 years or smokers, and had lower prevalence of comorbidities as
compared with the general population, indicating overrepresentation of healthy individuals. Even though the
rates of daily reporting in male and female CSSS participants were comparable, women were also more likely to
report a PCR SARS-CoV-2 test, which aligns with other Swedish testing patterns (NOVUS 27 and CRUSH), as
well as with international testing data from the UK and Canada 28,29. Furthermore, when we applied the
prediction model to the general population, we observed a higher estimated prevalence of symptomatic COVID19 in women than in men, which was partially explained by higher COVID-19 risk among healthcare
professionals that are more often female.
A limitation of the CSSS app is that, owing to limited resources, it is only available in Swedish, which precludes
inclusion of non-Swedish speakers, who may be at high risk of COVID-19 infection 30. It is also possible that
participants were more likely to join the study and report daily if they experienced symptoms associated with
COVID-19 than if they were healthy, potentially inflating COVID-19 prevalence estimates. We sought to reduce

this bias by excluding the first seven days of data collected for each participant. However, the regional ranking
of hospital admissions was comparable or slightly less strongly correlated to those based on testing.
We observed a peak in app-based COVID-19 prevalence estimates in mid-September 2020 with no
corresponding peak in any disease-specific COVID-19 national register data. The prevalence of loss of smell
and/or taste, sore throat, and headache were similarly elevated in NOVUS. The FoHM also noted acute
respiratory infections symptom reporting at this time 31. Weekly laboratory analyses of respiratory viruses later
indicated a high incidence of common colds caused by rhinoviruses in September 2020 32. Hence, the specificity
of the CSSS data was compromised when prevalence of other pathogens with similar symptomatology to
COVID-19 was elevated. We therefore developed a prediction model, which permitted time-varying coefficients
conditional on the PCR test results during a given period. This model yielded results more consistent with the
national COVID-19 incidence data. Because of the delay inherent in this type of analysis, the time-dependent
model is not suitable for real-time COVID-19 surveillance; it is also ineffective when test positivity varies
greatly across counties. A possible extension of this model would be to use seasonality of symptoms from other
causes to improve the model. Exceptionally few cases of seasonal influenza were confirmed in Sweden in the
winter season of 2020/2021 compared with previous years 31,32, which rendered the lower specificity during this
period less problematic.
Conclusion
Citizen science represents a powerful and rapid asset when combatting public health emergencies. Our
experience with CSSS suggests that app-based technologies should be incorporated into national research and
public health efforts to understand and predict the impact of disease.
