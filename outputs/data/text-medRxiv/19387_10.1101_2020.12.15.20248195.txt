Abstract
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic started a healthcare crisis and heavily impacted cancer services.

Methods
Data from cohort studies of COVID-19 cancer patients published up until October 23rd 2020
from PubMed, PubMed Central, medRxiv and Google Scholar were reviewed. Metaanalyses using the random effects model was performed to assess the risk of death in
cancer patients with COVID-19.

Results
Our meta-analyses including up to 5,678 patients from 13 studies showed that the following
were all statistically significant risk factors for death following SARS-CoV-2 infection in
cancer patients: age of 65 and above, presence of co-morbidities, cardiovascular disease,
chronic lung disease, diabetes and hypertension. There was no evidence that patients who
had received cancer treatment within 60 days of their COVID-19 diagnosis were at a higher
risk of death, including patients who had recent chemotherapy.

Conclusions
Cancer patients are susceptible to severe COVID-19, especially older patients and patients
with co-morbidities who will require close monitoring. Our findings support the continued
administration of anti-cancer therapy during the pandemic. The analysis of chemotherapy
was powered at 70% to detect an effect size of 1.2 but all other anti-cancer treatments had
lower power. Further studies are required to better estimate their impact on the outcome of
cancer patients.

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 which has led to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 65
million COVID-19 cases and 1.5 million deaths globally as of 6 December 2020
[1][2][3]. Cancer patients are considered to be at high risk from COVID-19 compared
to the general population due to underlying immunosuppression from their
malignancy and anti-cancer treatment. A large cohort study of over 20,000
hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the UK identified 1,743 (10%) patients with a
cancer diagnosis, which was significantly associated with hospital mortality (adjusted
HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.24, p=0.017) [4]. Cancer services was intentionally
restricted in many countries at the beginning of the pandemic as a precaution. Since
then, an estimated 20% increase in mortality in patients with new cancer diagnoses
has been attributed to delays in diagnosis and treatment as a consequence of
COVID-19 [5]. A recent survey conducted by Cancer Research UK found that 1 in 3
cancer patients reported that their treatment had been affected by the pandemic [6].
Balancing the benefits and risks of each patient’s cancer treatment by taking into
account factors such as treatment survival and response benefit, co-morbidities,
prognosis, as well as the risks of immunosuppression are important considerations
but often challenging [7]. We aimed to investigate the impact of cancer patients’
characteristics, cancer type and recent treatment history on the risk of death in
cancer patients following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods

Literature review strategy and inclusion criteria
The review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines (Figure 1,
Supplementary Table 1) [8]. PubMed and PubMed Central (PMC) were searched for
articles published in the last year up to 23rd October 2020 using the following
keywords: coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 AND cancer, malignancy and
oncology. The same keywords were also used to identify relevant articles using
medRxiv and Google Scholar. All articles available in English were screened.
Studies reporting on characteristics, treatment history and outcome of cancer
patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) testing or clinical features were included. Minimum inclusion criteria were:

reporting on 10 or more COVID-19 positive cancer patients and provision of data on
sex and age. For studies that had potentially overlapping participants based on the
hospital recruitment sites and authors’ institutions listed, the study with the largest
number of participants was included. Studies that contained abstracts only or
analysed specific cancer types only or paediatric cancers were excluded.
Data extraction process and statistical analysis
Two independent reviewers were allocated for each study. Counts of the number of
patients that died and the number that recovered following SARS-CoV-2 infection,
stratified by the following variables were extracted from each of the source data
papers or requested from the corresponding author: sex, age, co-morbidities,
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), smoking
status, cancer type and stage and anti-cancer therapy. Count data was extracted for
all-cause mortality and deaths caused by COVID-19 where available. Two of the
registry studies identified (UKCCMP and OnCovid) had two publications each. Data
from the more recent publication was extracted where the same variables had been
reported with updated data [9][10][11][12]. Raw, previously unpublished data was
provided by the OnCovid team to allow formal meta-analyses of key variables such
as cancer treatment types. In all meta-analyses, studies were only included if they
had provided counts data on patients with each outcome and variable under
investigation to allow fair comparison across studies.

Meta-analyses of binary outcome data with ‘events’ corresponding to the number of
deaths were performed with the ‘R’ statistical packages meta(v4.15-1) and
metafor(v2.4-0) [13][14]. Random effects model was used as the studies in the metaanalyses originated from multiple different populations. The Mantel-Haenszel method
was selected for data pooling using risk ratios (RR) as the summary measure.
Between-study heterogeneity was tested using the Sidik-Jonkman estimator.
Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and funnel plot asymmetry was
quantified with Egger’s test if necessary. Power calculations for each analysis was
performed using epiR(v1.0-15) package from ‘R’.

Results

Description of the included studies
15 papers published describing a total of 6,711 cancer patients with COVID-19 met
the inclusion criteria. The number of COVID-19 cancer patients included in each
study ranged from 25 to 1289 (Table 1). The search and screening strategies used
to identify each study is shown in Figure 1 and the study characteristics and
variables measured by each are summarised in Table 1. Ten studies were national
or international multi-centre studies involving sites from the United Kingdom (UK),
United States (US), Italy, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, China, Canada
and France. The remaining five studies were single-centre studies originating from
India, Italy, US, UK and Brazil. Studies focusing on a specific cancer type were
excluded but two studies focusing on patients with solid cancers were included
[15][16]. Cancer patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on RT-PCR testing
alone in 10/13 (77%) of the studies (excluding two earlier publications from
UKCCMP and OnCovid). The remaining studies used clinical or radiological
approaches to confirm the diagnosis. All studies reported on the number of deaths in
COVID-19 cancer patients. Mortality rates reported from the studies reviewed ranged
from 13% to 60.4%. However, not all studies reported COVID-19 related deaths only
(Table 1).

Characteristics of COVID-19 positive cancer patients

Age and sex
Age and sex of COVID-19 cancer patients were reported in all the studies reviewed.
The pooled proportion of male COVID-19 positive cancer patients is 0.55 (95%
confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.60) with significant heterogeneity (I2 81%, p<0.01)
(Supplementary Fig. 1). A meta-analysis from 10 studies showed that male cancer
patients had a higher risk of death compared to female cancer patients although this
was not statistically significant (Risk Ratio(RR) 1.25, 95% CI 0.91-1.72, pvalue=0.15) (Supplementary Fig. 2). All studies reported either the median or mean
age of COVID-19 positive cancer patients analysed, which ranged between age 52
to 76 and 55.3 to 71.6 respectively. Four studies showed a statistically significant

higher risk of death in patients who are of age 65 or older (RR 2.27, 95% CI 1.124.62, p=0.04), but with significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 84.1%,
p=0.0003) (Figure 2).

Performance status and smoking status
The outcomes of cancer patients with COVID-19 according to ECOG PS were
reported in three studies. There was a non-significant higher risk of death in cancer
patients with a PS of 3 or greater (RR 2.32, 95% CI 0.64-8.38, p=0.11) with
considerable heterogeneity (I2 73%, p=0.02) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Four studies
reported on outcomes for patients with and without a smoking history. On analysis,
there was a non-significant association between smoking history and an increased
risk of death (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.76-2.49, p=0.19) (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Presence and type of comorbidities
11 studies reported on the proportion of cancer patients with co-morbidities. Between
46% and 86% of the cancer patients in these studies had one or more co-morbidities
(Supplementary Table 2). Meta-analysis from these studies showed a significant
higher risk of death in patients with co-morbidities (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.09-2.65,
p=0.03) with significant inter-study heterogeneity (I2 64.9%, p=0.004) (Figure 3a). Six
studies provided summary data on specific co-morbidities. Chronic lung disease,
diabetes and hypertension were all significantly associated with higher risk of death
(RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.33-3.39, p=0.009, RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.22-3.47, p=0.02 and RR
1.98, 95% CI 1.23-3.19, p=0.01 respectively) with heterogeneity only significant for
hypertension scores (I2 57%, p=0.04) (Figure 3b-d). A meta-analysis of five studies
showed that cardiovascular disease was significantly associated with an increased
risk of death (RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.67-4.24, p=0.004) with also significant
heterogeneity (I2 68.7%, p=0.01) (Figure 3e).

Cancer stage and cancer type

12 studies described the proportion of COVID-19 cancer patients with metastatic
cancer. This ranged from 24.5% to 58.8% (Supplementary Table 2). A meta-analysis
5

of five studies showed that metastatic cancer was associated with a higher risk of
death, but did not meet statistical significance (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.98-2.37, p=0.06)
(Supplementary Fig. 5). However, three of the studies reported on all-cause
mortality, while two studies reported COVID-19 related deaths. Therefore we were
unable, in the former studies, to exclude the possibility that excess death risks could
be attributed to cancer related deaths. 12 studies reported on the cancer types in
their patient cohort.

A meta-analysis of nine studies found a non-significant

increased risk of death in haematological cancer patients (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.911.99, p=0.12) (Figure 4a). Four studies reported haematological cancers as the most
frequent cancer type among patients with COVID-19. Meta-analysis of seven studies
showed that gastrointestinal cancers were not significantly associated with an
increased risk of death (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75-1.62, p=0.56) (Figure 4b). Eight
studies also showed no significant association between breast cancer and risk of
death (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.40-1.47, p=0.36) but there was significant heterogeneity
(I2 88%, P<0.0001) (Figure 4c).

Similarly, eight studies showed no significant

association between death and thoracic cancers (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.75-1.80,
p=0.46) (Figure 4d). As the study by Lièvre only analysed solid cancers, we repeated
the meta-analyses of gastrointestinal, breast and lung cancer without this study. The
results were similar but remained non-significant (Supplementary Table 3).
Impact of anti-cancer treatment

12 studies provided information on cancer treatment history prior to COVID-19
infection. 10% to 65% of cancer patients received recent anti-cancer therapy prior to
admission (Supplementary Table 2). The definition of recent treatment varied
significantly between studies. A meta-analysis of six studies defining recent anticancer treatment as either receiving active treatment or within 60 days prior to
infection showed a borderline significant reduction in the risk of death in those
receiving

anti-cancer

treatment

(Supplementary Fig. 6a). 11/13 studies had data on the types of anti-cancer therapy
received. Chemotherapy was the most commonly administered in 9% to 37% of
patients. A meta-analysis of seven studies demonstrated no significant association
between recent chemotherapy and death (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.88-1.24, p=0.59)
(Figure 5). In addition, six studies showed no significant association between recent

immunotherapy and risk of death (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.63-1.43, p=0.73) and five
studies similarly showed no association between recent targeted therapy and risk of
death (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.50-1.95, p=0.96) (Supplementary Fig. 6b & c). Recent
radiotherapy and hormonal therapy were also not associated with a higher risk of
death (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.46-1.48, p=0.37 and RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.43-1.48, p=0.33
respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 6d & e). Recent surgery was found to be
associated with reduced risk of death with borderline significance (RR 0.79, 95% CI
0.63-0.99, p=0.047) from a meta-analysis of three studies (Supplementary Fig. 6f).
Publication bias

The funnel plot on the effects of co-morbidities appeared slightly asymmetrical, but
no significant publication bias was detected based on Eggers’ test (p-value=0.79).
Similarly, no apparent asymmetry was visualised in the funnel plots on the effects of
recent chemotherapy or surgery (Supplementary Fig. 7a-c).
Discussion

This review and meta-analysis summarises

the current

data

on

patient

characteristics and outcomes in cancer patients with COVID-19. To our knowledge, it
includes the largest number of cancer patients and is the first to extract count data
from all included studies . We also excluded studies that focused on specific cancer
types in order to conduct an unbiased analysis of the risk of death associated with
particular cancer diagnoses. In the case of studies that had recruited patients from
the same geographical locations with overlapping authors’ institutions, we took a
conservative approach of only including one of these studies. Whilst we may have
excluded more patients than necessary, we have ruled out including patients twice,
which strengthens the quality of the research evidence generated.

All of the large

registry-based studies published to date, UKCCMP, CCC19, OnCovid, and
CACOVID-19 are included [10][12][16][17]. None of the meta-analyses presented
had 80% power to detect a RR of 1.2 but the analyses of age, sex, metastatic
cancer, smoking history, all cancer types, all comorbidities apart from hypertension,
and all cancer therapies apart from recent surgery had 80% power to detect a RR of
1.5. All analyses had 80% power to detect a RR of 2.

Consistent with previous meta-analyses of cancer patients by Liu and Zhang et al,
we identified that age, male sex and the presence of co-morbidities were associated
with an increased risk of death, although the meta-analysis of sex did not reach
statistical significance [18][19]. Large population studies of non-cancer COVID-19
patients have also found male patients, increasing age and chronic co-morbidities to
be risk factors for increased hospital mortality [4][20].

Our results also suggest

ECOG PS of 3 or greater and presence of a smoking history as risk factors for
increased death but these results were not significant. Assessment of ECOG PS is
also poorly reproduced in retrospective studies and confounded by the rapid
deterioration from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalised patients.

Co-existent cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, hypertension and diabetes
were all significantly associated with an increased risk of death in our analysis.
Significant between- study heterogeneity observed in the cardiovascular disease and
hypertension meta-analyses were largely driven by the study by de Azambuja. This
could partly be explained by the higher proportion of patients with cardiovascular
disease (44%) than the other studies (6%-21%) [15]. Metastatic cancer patients with
COVID-19 also appeared be at a higher risk of death. However, this analysis did not
meet statistical significance and could be driven by confounding bias given that
patients with higher cancer stages tend to have worse prognoses and not all studies
in the meta-analysis reported on COVID-19 related deaths only.

Our meta-analyses also supported previous reports that patients with haematological
cancers are at higher risk compared to patients with solid cancers [18][21]. A high
risk of death (34%) was also reported in a systematic review of over 3,000
haematological cancer patients [22]. Interestingly compared to the meta-analysis by
Liu et al, our results were not statistically significant, despite showing a trend for
increased risk. When compared to Liu’s study, our analysis included more patients
(396 vs 656 haematological and 1,726 vs 2,896 solid cancer patients) and had fewer
potentially overlapping studies recruiting from the same geographical areas. Both
analyses are not adjusted for other risk factors such as age, sex, performance status
and co-morbidities. These may be important in estimating the true impact of
haematological cancers on risk of death following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our

analysis does suggest that the impact of haematological cancer diagnosis may have
been over-estimated by the smaller earlier studies whilst acknowledging the
significant heterogeneity present (I2 70%, p=0.001). Breast, gastrointestinal and lung
cancers were common in the included studies, but we found no evidence of
increased mortality risk within these cancer types. We did however find a high
proportion of death among thoracic cancer patients from the included studies
(37.7%), which supported the findings from a multi-centre study of 200 thoracic
cancer patients that reported a high mortality rate of 33% in their cohort [23].

A key question during this pandemic has been whether to delay or avoid cancer
treatment during escalating viral transmission. There have been two previous metaanalyses that have focused on the effect of active or recent cancer treatment on
outcomes [24][25]. Yekedüz et al found no evidence of an association between
recent anti-cancer treatment and increased risk of death when summary statistics
from univariate models were analysed. However, they did find a statistically
significant association between recent chemotherapy and an increased risk of death
in multivariate models [25]. Park et al also found evidence of an association between
recent chemotherapy and an increased risk of death when analysing summary
statistics from univariate and multivariate models [24]. The multivariate analysis by
Yekedüz only included 1,398 patients and involved only a subset of 227
haematological cancer patients from Lee et al [25]. In comparison, our meta-analysis
of the impact of recent chemotherapy involved 4,256 patients and included all of the
published large registry-based studies [9][12][16][17]. Only one study from our metaanalysis found a borderline significant association between recent chemotherapy
and an increased risk of death in RT-PCR positive patients [16]. Our larger analysis
provided no evidence that recent chemotherapy is associated with an increased risk
of death and was powered at 71% to detect an effect size of 1.2. Previous analyses
including fewer patients will also have been underpowered. Whilst we can rule out
large risks associated with recent anti-cancer treatment, generally there is a need for
new and ongoing cohort studies registering COVID-19 positive cancer patients to
report on outcomes in patients on and off active treatment in the 60 days prior to a
positive COVID-19 diagnosis in order to provide a definitive answer on the impact of
recent treatment and to examine risk in particular subgroups such as haematological
cancer patients.

Whilst the analyses of other cancer therapies included fewer patients, recent
radiotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted and hormonal therapy were not associated
with an increased risk of death. Although the analysis for recent surgery showed a
borderline significant association with a lower risk of death, this analysis was
underpowered to detect an effect size of 0.79 and potential confounders such as
patients’ age, ECOG PS and type of surgery were not considered in the included
studies. In addition, none of the studies provided details on median time between
surgery and COVID-19 diagnosis. The COVIDSurg collaboration have published
work to show that timing between surgery and a SARS-CoV-2 positive swab had a
large impact on outcome and complications and that surgery in COVID-19 patients is
associated with a high rate of pulmonary complications and deaths [26][27]. This
collaborative project has also recently published another study showing that cancer
patients treated in hospitals with COVID-19-free surgical pathways had lower rates
of pulmonary complications and post-operative infection compared to patients
treated in hospitals with no defined pathway [28].
Limitations

Our analyses had several limitations. We were only able to include a limited number
of studies in the meta-analyses for age, ECOG PS, smoking status, recent surgery,
radiotherapy and hormonal therapy due to the lack of summary statistics from other
studies for these variables. Statistical power to detect moderate effects (RRs)
between 1.2 and 1.5 was low for the analyses of the impact of the different anticancer therapies on mortality. We were also unable to conduct further meta-analyses
of odds ratios as most of the studies had adjusted their reported results for different
variables. In addition, our review did not cover the rates and outcomes of
haematological cancer patients who received either bone marrow or stem cell
transplant or immunomodulatory medication due to the lack of data available for
these therapies. Therefore, there is a need for further studies to evaluate the risks of
patients receiving these therapies.

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis of up to 5,678 patients has identified older age and presence of
co-morbidities including cardiovascular, chronic lung conditions, diabetes and
hypertension as significant risk factors among cancer patients with COVID-19.
There was no clear increase in risk of death for a particular cancer type, although
there was a trend towards haematological cancers being at higher risk compared to
solid cancers. There was also no increase in risk of death with any recent anticancer therapy, including chemotherapy.
