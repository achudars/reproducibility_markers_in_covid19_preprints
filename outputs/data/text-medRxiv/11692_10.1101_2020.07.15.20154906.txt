ABSTRACT
Background
African-Americans/Blacks have suffered higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19
than all other racial groups. This study aims to identify the causes of this health
disparity, determine prognostic indicators, and assess efficacy of treatment
interventions.
Method
We performed a retrospective cohort study of clinical features and laboratory data of
COVID-19 patients admitted over a five-week period at the height of the pandemic in
the United States. This study was performed at an urban academic medical center in
New York City, declared a COVID-only facility, serving a majority Black population
Result
Of the 1,070 consecutive patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 496 critically ill
patients were hospitalized and included in the study. 88% of patients were Black; and a
majority (53%) were 61-80 years old with a mean body mass index in the “obese”
range. 97% had one or more comorbidities. Hypertension was the most common (84%)
pre-existing condition followed by diabetes mellitus (57%) and chronic kidney disease
(24%). Patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease who received
hemodialysis were found to have significantly lower mortality, then those who did not
receive it, suggesting benefit from hemodialysis (11%, OR, 0.35, CI, 0.17 - 0.69
P=0.001). Age >60 years and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of
mortality in multivariate analysis. Cox Proportional Hazards modeling for time to death
demonstrated a significantly high ratio for COPD/Asthma, and favorable effects on
outcomes for pre-admission ACE inhibitors and ARBs. CRP (180, 283 mg/L), LDH
(551, 638 U/L), glucose (182, 163 mg/dL), procalcitonin (1.03, 1.68 ng/mL), and
neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio (8.5, 10.0) were predictive of mortality on admission and at
48-96 hrs. Of the 496 inpatients, 48% died, one third of patients died within the first
three days of admission. 54/488 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, of
which 87% died and of the remaining patients, 32% died.
CONCLUSIONS
COVID-19 patients in our predominantly Black neighborhood had higher mortality, likely
due to higher prevalence of comorbidities. Early dialysis and pre-admission intake of
ACE inhibitors/ARBs improved patient outcomes. Early escalation of care based on
comorbidities and key laboratory indicators is critical for improving outcomes in AfricanAmerican patients.

Methods

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, has been declared by the World Health
Organization to be a pandemic, with over five million confirmed cases.1 New York became
the epicenter of the epidemic in the United States, accounting for more than 23% of the
total U.S. cases by the end of May, 2020.2 Such burden of disease is of particular concern
since it disproportionately affects communities with considerable health disparities, where
African-Americans and Latinos constitute as much as 53% of the population.3
The spectrum of COVID-19 presentation ranges from mild influenza-like illness to lifethreatening severe respiratory disease requiring ventilatory support.3 Comorbid
conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary and heart diseases, and
demographic factors have been reported to influence outcomes.4–6 However, the relative
influence of each of these comorbidities in different patient populations and age strata
has not been assessed, leading to variability in management and outcomes. Key
decisions in patient management such as the choice of antibiotic, blood pressure goals,
and perhaps most importantly, airway management strategies, have remained variable
across or within hospitals.
National health statistics have documented extensive health disparities for Black COVID19 patients. They suffer a three-fold greater infection rate, and a six-fold greater mortality
rate than their white counterparts.7 However, clinical features and laboratory data of
prognostic significance from Black COVID-19 patients remain unexplored and
undocumented. A range of cultural, linguistic, and healthcare access barriers have
prevented clinical investigation. Our hospital, located in New York City, serves a
predominantly Black population, and being declared a COVID-only facility, we were able
to maintain a standard quality-of-care across all COVID-19 patients.
Here we explore the clinical aspects of COVID-19 and its outcomes in Black patients; we
also identify comorbidities and demographic factors that help explain the greater mortality
from COVID-19 observed in this vulnerable population. This study evaluated clinical signs
and symptoms, laboratory indicators, and management strategies to develop a datadriven COVID-19 patient-care approach. We evaluated these factors at admission and at
48-96 hours after admission, as one-third of our patients died within the first few days of
admission, and we found early recognition of critical indicators pivotal in assessing risk of
mortality. To our knowledge, this is the only study that correlates early laboratory
indicators at two critical time points with outcomes. Therefore, our findings are expected
to provide an evidence-based resource for physicians to assess patient progress within
the first three days of hospitalization to direct patient management decisions.

This study analyzed COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the State University of New York
(SUNY), Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York, that was designated a COVIDonly facility by the State of New York as of March 4th, 2020. The hospital is located in a

majority Black neighborhood with high rates of poverty.8 This study was approved by the
SUNY Downstate Institutional Review Board [1587476-1].
We examined 496 consecutively admitted COVID-19 patients during a five-week period
(March-April) when the hospital was under peak caseload and admission was reserved
for critically ill patients. COVID-19 diagnosis was based on clinical presentation and a
positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) from a
nasopharyngeal swab (Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). Patients
were admitted if deemed to be in respiratory distress (respiratory rate >22 breaths/min
and in need of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation >92%), were
encephalopathic, or were judged sufficiently ill to require hospitalization. Only patients
with final clinical outcomes, such as discharge or expiration, were included. Patients with
“fluid overload” (due to missed dialysis), pregnancy, or those still hospitalized were
excluded from this analysis.
Demographic factors, comorbidities, presenting clinical symptoms, and outcomes
(discharge/death) were available for 496 patients. Of these, laboratory data were
recorded for 281 patients on admission or within 24 hr of hospitalization, and at a second
time point between 48-96 hr post-admission. Pre-admission medications were recorded
based on admission medication reconciliation by admitting physicians. Based on selfreported race/ethnicity, patients were grouped into Black and Others (White
Hispanic/non-Hispanic and Asian). HIV-positive patients (with low CD4 counts) and
transplant recipients were categorized as “immunocompromised”.
Patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice a day, for five days) and
azithromycin (250 mg once a day, for five days). All patients received standard venous
thromboembolism prophylaxis with low-molecular weight heparin or direct oral
anticoagulants based on their creatinine clearance rate. Patients with elevated D-dimer
received a full dose anticoagulation regimen. Hypoxia, a sign of Acute Respiratory
Distress Syndrome (ARDS), was monitored by a continuous pulse oximeter and with
arterial blood gas measurements, and supplemental oxygen was provided as needed via
noninvasive ventilation. Patients with worsening respiratory distress despite supportive
care, as determined by declining pulse oximeter saturation, increasing respiratory rate, or
worsening partial pressure of arterial oxygen/percentage of inspired oxygen ratio) were
intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Patients who developed acute kidney
injury (AKI), defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine greater than or equal to
0.3 mg/dL within 48 hr, with oliguria, with or without hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis,
received hemodialysis.
Computational analysis was conducted using R (ver. 3.6.3).9 Continuous variables are
presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Categorical variables such as gender
or race are presented as number and percent of patients with 95% confidence intervals
(CI). Percentages are expressed based on the available data for the subgroup relative to
the total available data for that variable.

Parametric variables were evaluated through a Shapiro-Wilk test of normality with a
significance cutoff of P<0.01. Non-parametric variables were compared using MannWhitney rank sum test, with 95% CIs reported. Categorical variables were evaluated
using the Fisher exact test, and odds ratios (OR) alongside 95% CIs are presented. All
tests were two-tailed and statistical significance was defined as P<0.05. No multiple
testing correction was applied. A multivariate linear regression analysis was performed
on comorbidities and demographic factors for mortality, and ORs with 95% CIs are
presented. Cox proportional hazards analysis for time to death was conducted on
comorbidities, demographic factors, and pre-admission medications (angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and
hazard ratios with 95% CIs are presented.

Results
1,070 patients were tested for COVID-19 over a 5-week period. After excluding 292
patients who tested negative and 282 who were treated as outpatients, 496 inpatients
with positive test results and symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were included in this
study.
Demographic Information
The median patient age was 70 years (Interquartile Range (IQR), 60 - 78). A majority of
patients were in the age range of 61-80 years (53%, 255/483) and a small minority were
<40 years old (5%, 25/483). Mortality rates inversely correlated with patient age, with the
highest mortality rate recorded for the >80-year age group (65%, 64/99). 88% of the
patients were Black (424/481) and the remaining 12% were Other. No difference in
mortality rates were found between the two groups. Male-to-female ratio was 1.17:1, with
a higher mortality rate for males (53%, 139/260). The mean BMI of patients was 30 kg/m2
(obese) and no correlation with mortality was found. A majority of patients (81%, 157/194)
never smoked and, while not statistically significant, mortality rate increased with any
history of smoking (Table 1).
Presenting Signs and Symptoms, Comorbidities, and Pre-admission Medication
Presenting patient complaints grouped based on systemic symptoms were “fever” (42%,
headache, weakness, lethargy), respiratory (76%, cough, shortness of breath),
gastrointestinal (21%, diarrhea, vomiting), and neurological (16%, altered mental status,
seizure, unresponsiveness).
Comorbidities were present in 97% (484/496) of patients. The most common
comorbidities were hypertension (HT) (84%, 406/484) and diabetes mellitus (DM) (57%,
276/484), followed by chronic kidney disease (CKD)/end stage renal disease (ESRD)
(24%,117/485), hyperlipidemia (16%, 81/496), history of cancer (9%, 44/482), coronary
artery disease (CAD) (8%, 40/496), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (7%,
30/451), and asthma (6%, 28/449). These comorbidities showed correlation with
increased mortality except for HT. Autoimmune diseases (38/482) did not affect outcomes
(Table 2). Patients with CKD/ESRD and on dialysis (11%, 52/485) showed lower mortality
(P=0.001) than counterparts with CKD/ESRD without dialysis (13%, 65/485). These

results are notable considering patients with CKD/ESRD suffered higher mean number
of comorbidities (mean 4.2) than other patients (mean 3.3, P = <0.001) (Table 3).
In multivariate analysis, age >60 years and CAD were independent predictors of mortality.
Hemodialysis in patients with CKD/ESRD was an independent predictor of lower mortality
(P = 0.007) (Figure 1). Cox proportional hazards analysis for time to death showed that
COPD/Asthma (HR: 1.79, P =0.005) had a significantly higher hazards ratio for death
(Figure 2). Additional analysis demonstrated patients on pre-admission ACE inhibitors
(20%, 29/142) and ARBs (25%, 35/142) had a beneficial effect (P = 0.013 and 0.036
respectively).
Complications during clinical course in 312 patients were: acute hypoxic respiratory
failure (37%), AKI (15%), cardiogenic shock (18%), neurological shock (5%), sepsis (4%),
and diabetic ketoacidosis (3%).
Laboratory Data
At admission and at 48-96 hr, leukocyte (8.7K/μL, 10.6K/μL) and neutrophil counts
(7.3K/μL, 8.9K/μL) were higher (P<0.001) and lymphocyte counts (0.8K/μL) were lower
at 48-96 hr (P=0.003) for non-survivors. The median neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR)
was higher both at admission and at the second time point in patients who did not survive
(8.5,10, P<0.001). Platelet and hemoglobin were marginally decreased but were not
significantly different in survivors and non-survivors. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (33, 39
mg/dL), creatinine (1.7, 1.6 mg/dL), glucose (182, 163 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase (66,
75 U/L), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (52, 64 μ/L) levels were higher in nonsurvivors at both time points (P<0.001). Bilirubin and total protein were mildly increased
in non-survivors, but were within their respective reference ranges. Albumin (3.4, 2.8
g/dL) was lower for non-survivors at both time points (P<0.001). Lactate dehydrogenase
(551, 638 U/L), C-reactive protein (180, 283 mg/L), and procalcitonin (1.03, 1.68 ng/mL)
showed significantly higher serum levels at admission and at 48-96 hr (P = <0.05) for
non-survivors. D-dimer (3.0 mcg/mL, 7.5 times elevation), prothrombin time (PT) (17.2
sec), and international normalized ratio (1.4 U) were increased in non-survivors at the
second time point (P<0.05). Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was not found
to be different in the two groups (Table 4).
Outcomes
Of the 496 hospitalized patients evaluated, 255 survived and 241 (48.5%) died by the end
of the study. Of 488 patients examined, 154 received invasive mechanical ventilation, of
which 134 (87%) died. Patients who received supplemental oxygen therapy via noninvasive mode suffered a 32% mortality rate (106/334). This also included patients who
self-declared “Do Not Intubate” (DNI), “Do not Resuscitate” (DNR) or came to the hospital
in severe respiratory distress and died within the first few hours of admission. More than
one third of admitted patients died within the first three days of admission (38%, 91/241),
which was similar for both Blacks (77/206) and Others (13/32) (Figure 3). Average time
to death for ventilated patients was 7.5 days, while for non-ventilated patients it was 6.2
days from admission.

Discussion
This study documents the demographic, clinical features, and outcomes for patients
admitted with COVID-19 at an urban hospital located in an underserved majority-Black
neighborhood. We also identify indicators available to physicians at two early time points
of evaluation to predict outcomes and develop management plans for appropriate levels
of care.
The Black patient population in our study faces unique obstacles such as linguistic and
cultural barriers to care and understudied comorbidities.10,11 Despite reports that AfricanAmericans face significantly greater mortality from COVID-19, recent studies have
examined the clinical outcomes in largely East-Asian or Caucasian cohorts.10 Here, we
present an analysis of 496 consecutively hospitalized patients who had been diagnosed
with COVID-19 over a 5-week period at the height of the pandemic in New York City, and
have either been discharged or died.
Older age at admission correlated with higher mortality rate, with the 60+ year age group
most at risk, and was an independent risk factor for mortality. Males suffered significantly
higher mortality than females, despite identical representation at admission. Recent
reports of high plasma concentrations of ACE-2, a receptor for coronavirus, in men may
account for higher mortality.12 Our inpatient population had a mean BMI in the “obese”
range, higher than the national average; this finding mirrors higher BMI amongst the Black
population nationwide.13 However, BMI was not an independent predictor of survival;
higher BMIs were more commonly seen amongst younger patients. Smoking was less
prevalent in our patient population than the national average; 4% were current smokers
and 15% had quit.14 We found smoking to be unrelated to poor outcome.
The majority (88%) of our patients were Black. Race was not an independent prognostic
factor for survival; higher mortality in our patient population can be attributed to a greater
number and prevalence of comorbidities common amongst this group. Comorbidities
were present in 97% of our patients, and the presence of any comorbidity was a strong
predictor of mortality, as noted in other recent studies.15,16 HT and DM were the two most
prevalent preexisting conditions; prevalence of HT (84%) and DM (57%) was
considerably higher than previously reported (up to 63% and 36%, respectively).17–19 In
the multivariate analysis, coronary artery disease was strongly associated with adverse
outcome (OR, 2.45, CI, 1.14 - 5.69, P=0.034), followed by DM (OR, 1.38, CI, 0.91 - 2.11,
P=0.13). A 2.5-fold increase in the risk of mortality from COVID-19 in hypertensive
patients has been reported, however, this was not discernable in our patients.18 Although
past history of cancer, HT, autoimmune diseases, and immunosuppression were not
independent predictors of mortality, the combined effect of these comorbidities on multiple
organ systems and resultant dysregulation of the immune system likely increases
susceptibility to COVID-19.19,20
A notable finding in multivariate analysis was that patients with CKD who were dialyzed
early in the course of treatment had better outcomes than those who did not. This group
consisted of ESRD patients receiving continued dialysis during hospitalization and

patients with worsening CKD who were started early on dialysis (OR, 0.37, CI, 0.17 - 0.74,
P=0.007). These findings are notable considering patients with CKD/ESRD had more
comorbidities as compared to all other patients in the study. Early dialysis stands out as
a potentially beneficial treatment option for patients with CKD/ESRD. It is likely that
dialysis removes inflammatory mediators, cytokines, and other effector molecules
responsible for the end-organ damage. CKD and ESRD were more prevalent in our
patient population (24%) than reported in other studies (between 3% to 8.5%), most likely
due to complications from HT and DM.4,21 Thus, early hemodialysis is critical in Black
patients.
We found laboratory data at admission vital for triaging patients to receive intensive care.
CRP, LDH, and procalcitonin were significantly increased at both admission and at 48-96
hr in non-survivors. Indicators of AKI, elevated levels of BUN, creatinine, glucose, and
reduced levels of bicarbonate or albumin were significant predictors of adverse outcome
at both initial and secondary time points. These findings correlate with reported tubular,
endothelial, and glomerular capillary loop injury, likely the result of direct injury or systemic
hypoxia.22 Hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia in non-survivors may result from renal
insufficiency and suboptimal nutritional status in critically-ill patients, or could reflect
stressed state.21 As reported elsewhere, we found hyperglycemia to be a predictor of
adverse outcome in COVID-19 patients, regardless of their history of diabetes.23
Multivariate analysis of laboratory data was not performed due to sample size limitations.
Peripheral blood analysis showed that a high median NLR at admission and at 48-96 hr
was an independent predictor of adverse outcome in COVID-19 patients, as had been
reported in other studies.24 The presence of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC),
a condition characterized by elevation in fibrinogen and D-dimer levels, high PT, relatively
normal aPTT, and mild thrombocytopenia without evidence of microangiopathy, was
confirmed in our study.25 The mechanisms underlying CAC remain poorly understood,
but it can possibly result from activation of extrinsic coagulation pathway, leading to
excess consumption of Factor-VII following endothelial cell infection by the virus.26,27
Elevated D-dimer levels at the second evaluation time point were associated with higher
mortality, likely reflecting coagulation activation from sepsis, “cytokine-storm”, or
impending organ failure.
By the end of our 5-week study, 48.5% of the inpatients had died, including 87% of
patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation. Reported mortality rates from
other retrospective cohort studies ranged from 21% (New York metropolitan area) to 26%
(Lombardy region, Italy) and 33% (UK).4,6,28 Our mortality rate was elevated relative to
other studies, which we believe is due to the largely poor and disadvantaged
neighborhood that our hospital serves. Race was not found to be an independent
predictor of mortality. The high mortality rate from COVID-19 from this predominantly
Black neighborhood demonstrates the large racial disparity in outcomes between these
patients and their counterparts elsewhere.
Our study has limitations. It examined a predominantly Black patient cohort, which makes
comparisons to other races and ethnicities difficult to quantify. This study was carried out

over a five week period at the height of the pandemic in New York City, admissions were
restricted to the most seriously ill and hospital resources were under strain, which may
have contributed to an increase in overall mortality rates. As knowledge and
understanding of COVID-19 was developing during March and early April, complete
laboratory studies were not systematically ordered for all patients.

Legends to Tables and Figures

In our predominantly Black cohort we have recorded a mortality rate from COVID-19
which is significantly greater than that reported in other studies. While race was not an
independent predictor of death, this population had a greater burden of comorbidities than
the national average and the prevalence of these chronic comorbidities contributed to
both disease severity and higher mortality. Our study identified that early escalation of
care is important in patients from minority neighborhoods as one third of the admitted
patients die within the first three days of admission. Laboratory indicators at admission
are predictors of outcome and can be utilized by physicians to triage patients and monitor
disease course. As early dialysis in patients with chronic renal insufficiency showed
considerable benefit, we believe early dialysis in patients with renal disease can improve
outcomes.
