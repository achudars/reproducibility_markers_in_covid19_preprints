Abstract (230/250)

25

The scientific community is focussed on developing antiviral therapies to

26

mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.

27

This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected

28

hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load

29

data collected from the same specimen (throat / nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal /

30

sputum / tracheal aspirate), we compare within-host dynamics for patients infected in

31

the current outbreak with analogous dynamics for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV

32

infections. Our quantitative analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics

33

are more severe than those for mild cases of MERS-CoV, but are similar to severe

34

cases, and that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV infection are similar to those of

35

MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in severe case. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2

36

generates infection dynamics that are more severe than SARS-CoV. Furthermore,

37

we used our viral dynamics model to predict the effectiveness of unlicensed drugs

38

that have different methods of action. The effectiveness was measured by AUC of

39

viral load. Our results indicated that therapies that block de novo infections or virus

40

production are most likely to be effective if initiated before the peak viral load (which

41

occurs around three days after symptom onset on average), but therapies that

42

promote cytotoxicity are likely to have only limited effects. Our unique mathematical

43

approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, which

44

are useful for development of antiviral therapies.

Significance Statement (80/120)

48

Antiviral agents with different mechanisms of action have different curative effects

49

depending on precisely when therapy is initiated. Based on a model of viral

50

dynamics, parameterised using viral load data from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients

51

reported by Zou et al. (1), computer simulations were performed. We propose that

52

effective treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection requires an appropriate choice of class-

53

specific drugs and initiation timing as reported for treatment of other viral infections

54

(2); otherwise, antivirals do not have a significant effect on the within-host viral

55

dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and are wasted.

Text

58

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was first

59

reported in Wuhan, China in late December 2019 (3, 4). Since then, the causative

60

agent (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) has been

61

transmitted elsewhere in China and to 80 other countries and territories around the

62

world. The number of confirmed cases currently stands at 139,061 (as of 13 March

63

2020). The possibility of presymptomatic or asymptomatic cases (5), combined with

64

underreporting of symptomatic infections, suggests that the true number of cases is

65

likely to be even higher than this.

66

Antiviral drugs (for treatment and to avoid onwards transmission) and a

67

vaccine (for prevention) are currently under development to counter this outbreak. To

68

aid the development process, characterisation of the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2

69

both in vivo and in vitro is crucial. The virus has been isolated, genome sequencing

70

has been completed and the resulting data were made publicly available early in the

71

outbreak (6, 7). Furthermore, the viral load in upper respiratory specimens (throat

72

and nasal swabs) of infected patients over 20 days after symptom onset has been

73

reported (2). However, the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections have not been

74

studied quantitatively, and the data have not been compared with analogous

75

datasets for other coronaviruses. Such quantitative analyses are informative for the

76

development of antiviral agents, addressing questions such as the optimal viral-host

77

processes for antiviral drugs or vaccines to target.

Results and Discussion

79

Characterising SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV infections by analysing viral load

80

measurements collected from throat swabs

81

We analysed data describing SARS-CoV-2 viral loads reported by Zou et al.

82

(1) and MERS-CoV viral loads reported by Oh et al. (8) using a simple mathematical

83

model (see Methods). To consider inter-individual variations in viral loads, a

84

nonlinear mixed-effect modelling approach was employed to estimate parameters

85

(see Methods). The estimated parameters and initial values are listed in Table 1,

86

and the typical behaviour of the model using these best-fit parameter estimates is

87

shown together with the data in Fig. 1A for SARS-CoV-2 (pink) and MERS-CoV

88

(black and grey for severe and mild case, respectively). In addition, to parameterise

89

and compare these coronaviruses infections, we calculated the following important

90

quantities (Fig. 2) using estimated parameter values; the mean length of virus

91

production of an infected cell (𝐿𝐿 = 1/𝛿𝛿), the within-host basic reproduction number

92
93
94
95
96

(𝑅𝑅0 = 𝛾𝛾/𝛿𝛿) which is the average number of newly infected cells produced by any

single infected cell (9), and the critical inhibition rate (𝐶𝐶 ∗ = 1 − 1/𝑅𝑅0 ) induced by

antivirals to prevent primary virus infection (10, 11). We showed that 𝐿𝐿 is not

significantly different for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. However, interestingly, we
found that 𝑅𝑅0 and 𝐶𝐶 ∗ for SARS-CoV-2 are significantly different from analogous

98

values for mild cases of MERS-CoV (𝑝𝑝 = 8.9 × 10−4 and 2.0 × 10−6 by the bootstrap

99

t-test, respectively), but not for severe MERS-CoV (𝑝𝑝 = 0.41 and 0.41) (see Fig. 2),
although we were unable to separate mild and severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 due to

100

limited clinical information for the cases. This demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2

101

causes infection more effectively than in mild cases of MERS-CoV, but a general

102

SARS-CoV-2 infection follows infection dynamics that are similar to severe cases

103

due to MERS-CoV. In addition, as a median estimate, 65% inhibition of the initial

104

virus expansion is required to prevent the establishment of SARS-CoV-2 infection

105

(we provide a detailed analysis later). We also calculated the duration of infection in

106

which the viral load is above the detection limit (𝑇𝑇𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 ) in Table 1, showing that SARS-

107

CoV-2 is maintained in hosts for more than a week based on the median estimate.

108
109

Characterising SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections by analysing viral load

110

measurements collected from nasopharyngeal/sputum/tracheal aspirate

111

To extend our analysis to include SARS-CoV, we analysed SARS-CoV viral

112

loads in nasopharyngeal aspirate reported by Peiris et al. (12) and MERS-CoV viral

113

loads reported by Oh et al. (8) in sputum or tracheal aspirate. The estimated

114

parameters, viral load at symptom onset, and the indices derived from the estimated

115

parameters are listed in Table 1 and Fig. 2, and the typical behaviour of the model is

116

shown together with the data in Fig. 1B for SARS-CoV (blue) and MERS-CoV (black

117

or grey). The estimated values of 𝐿𝐿 for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not

118
119

significantly different. Surprisingly, the estimated values of 𝑅𝑅0 and 𝐶𝐶 ∗ for SARS-CoV

120

are significantly different from those for severe cases of MERS-CoV (𝑝𝑝 = 0.03 and

121

0.02 from bootstrap t-test), but not for mild MERS-CoV cases (𝑝𝑝 = 0.52 and 0.47

from bootstrap t-test) (Fig. 2). This demonstrates that in vivo viral dynamics of

122

SARS-CoV infection are similar to those for MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in

123

severe cases. Collectively, the findings from the viral load data analyses for the two

124

different specimens (throat/nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal/sputum/tracheal

125

aspirate) implied that SARS-CoV-2 also causes infection more effectively than

126

SARS-CoV.

Evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies

129

Our quantitative analyses provide insights into optimal usage of anti-SARS-

130

CoV-2 therapies under development. In particular, it remains poorly understood how

131

a delay of treatment initiation after primary infection, or how incomplete blocking of

132

virus infection/replication, impacts the viral load dynamics. Based on our

133

mathematical model and estimated parameter values (Table 1), we conducted in

134

silico experiments for possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies to investigate the

135

expected outcome under hypothetical drug therapies (or vaccine use) possessing

136

different antiviral mechanisms (Fig. 3).

137
138

(i) Blocking de novo infection

139

One of the major mechanisms of action for antivirals is blocking de novo

140

infections. This can be induced by drugs including human neutralising antibodies,

141

viral entry-inhibitors and/or antibodies raised by vaccination (13, 14). For example, a

142

SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody has been reported to cross react

143

with SARS-CoV-2 (14). We conducted in silico experiments with varying drug

144

efficacy (considering inhibition rates from 10% to 100%, i.e. 0.1 ≤ 𝜀𝜀 ≤ 1) and with the

145

timing of initiation of therapy from 0 days (i.e., post-exposure prophylactic use of

146
147

antivirals) until 5 days after symptom onset (i.e., 0 ≤ 𝑡𝑡 ∗ ≤ 5) (see Methods). Our

148

even a relatively weak drug (inhibition rates as low as 50%) might effectively reduce

149

the area under the curve of viral load (AUC) and prevent significant reductions in the

150

numbers of target cells because of cytopathic effects due to cell invasion. A therapy

151

of this type initiated four days after symptom onset, on the other hand, is not

152

predicted to induce a clear antiviral effect (Fig. 3AD). This suggests that blocking de

results show that early initiation of therapy (especially within two to three days) with

153

novo infections is not likely to be effective unless the intervention is initiated before

154

the peak viral load. Hence, appropriate initiation timing (i.e., before or very soon after

155

symptom onset) is an important factor for suppressing viral load in addition to the

156

therapy having the potential for antiviral effects.

157
158

(ii) Blocking virus production

159

The majority of antiviral drugs inhibit intracellular virus replication. Although

160

their antiviral efficacies need to be confirmed, lopinavir/ritonavir (HIV protease

161

inhibitors), remdesivir (anti-Ebola virus disease candidate) and other nucleoside

162

analogues, and interferon have the potential to suppress SARS-CoV-2 by blocking

163

virus production(15, 16). Interestingly, our results suggest that, even for relatively

164

small inhibition rates of around 30%, the AUC of viral load is partially reduced if

165

therapy is initiated early (within three days after symptom onset) (Fig. 3BE).

166

However, if treatment is applied after the peak viral load, even drugs with 100%

167

inhibition rate are not able to reduce viral loads, which is similar to the predicted

168

outcomes of de novo blocking therapy.

169
170

(iii) Promoting cytotoxicity

171

Another possible antiviral mechanism is cytotoxic effects by adaptive

172

immunity including those mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Here, we assume

173

that promoting cytotoxicity increases the virus death rate by at most two times (i.e.,

174
175

0.1 ≤ 𝜃𝜃 ≤ 1), that is, achieves up to 50% reduction of the mean length of virus

176

virus production), the induction of cytotoxicity had relatively mild effects on the AUC

177

reduction if initiated before peak viral load. However, cytotoxicity induction initiated

production. Compared with the other two therapies (blocking de novo infection and

178

after peak viral load could effectively reduce the viral load AUC (Fig. 3CF). This

179

implies that there is an optimal time to apply this therapy, and that significant antiviral

180

effects are expected unless the promoting rate is too low or therapy is initiated either

181

too early or too late. However, large reductions of target cells due to ongoing de

182

novo infection cannot be avoided even with very early initiation (i.e., immediately

183

after symptom onset) of the therapy.

184

Conclusions

185

There are a number of potential transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2,

186

including direct person-to-person transmission due to viral particle inhalation and

187

contact transmission due to contact with nasal/oral/eye mucuous membranes. The

188

risk of transmission depends on the viral load of the potential infector. Consequently,

189

treatments reducing the viral load are important for the prevention of secondary

190

transmission and aid population-scale outbreak control. We characterised viral

191

infection dynamics using a mathematical model, and assessed potential strategies to

192

reduce viral loads. Our analyses showed that both blocking de novo infection and

193

virus production effectively reduces AUC of SARS-CoV-2 load; for example, if the

194

therapy can reduce more than 90% of de novo infections and is initiated 3 days after

195

symptoms onset, the viral load AUC is expected to be reduced by 81.4% (Fig. 3DE).

196

However, if therapy is initiated after peak viral load (more than 2-3 days following

197

symptom onset), the effect on viral load AUC is limited. Compared with either

198

blocking de novo infection or virus production, promoting cytotoxicity showed

199

relatively mild effects on AUC reduction, however initiation of that therapy after the

200

peak viral load has the potential to still reduce viral load AUC (Fig. 3F).

201

The effectiveness of the hypothetical drugs can be evaluated in detail using a

202

cell culture system supporting SARS-CoV-2 infection (13). Wang et al. proposed

203

different classes of drugs for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections: chloroquine inhibited

204

viral entry and remdesivir suppressed the virus post-entry, likely by suppressing viral

205

replication (13). Although animal models for testing treatments have not been

206

reported for SARS-CoV-2, a number of animal models exist for SARS-CoV including

207

mice, hamsters, ferrets, and macaques (17). Animals could be used to verify the

208

conclusions from our models, by monitoring the viral loads in animals treated with
10

209

different types of drugs at different doses and different initiation timings. Such viral

210

load data would allow further investigation of the effectiveness of drugs with different

211

action mechanisms, which would be informative for development of appropriate

212

treatment strategies (i.e., the optimal dose/timing of antivirals) for SARS-CoV-2

213

infections.

214

In conclusion, effective treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections requires an

215

appropriate choice of class-specific drugs; otherwise, the antivirals do not alter the

216

viral load significantly and are wasted. Identification of SARS-CoV-2-specific virus

217

characteristics is needed to design optimal treatments and to ensure that limited

218

resources are deployed effectively. Additionally, effective combinations of anti-

219

SARS-CoV-2 drugs and vaccines will maximise the impacts of control, reduce the

220

required drug dose and potentially limit side effects, all of which are highly desirable.

221

Our theoretical approach could complement ongoing experimental investigations into

222

SARS-CoV-2 infection in BSL-3 laboratories and help establish a basis for COVID-

223

19 treatment. To our knowledge, previous studies have neither characterised SARS-

224

CoV-2 dynamics in humans using viral dynamics models, nor compared the resulting

225

dynamics against those of other coronaviruses (i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV).

226

Our mathematical modelling approach has led to an improved understanding of the

227

characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo, and can be used to test possible treatments

228

for COVID-19 further going forwards.

Methods

230

Study data

231

The data examined in our manuscript came from studies of SARS-CoV-2,

232

MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV by Zou et al. (1), Oh et al. (8) and Peiris et al. (12),

233

respectively. To extract the data from images in those publications, we used the

234

program datathief III (version 1.5, Bas Tummers, www.datathief.org). We excluded

235

patients for whom data were measured on only one day, and assumed that viral load

236

values under the detection limit were set as the detection limit for the purposes of

237

fitting the model. We converted cycle threshold (Ct) values reported in Zou et al. (1),

238

Oh et al. (8) and Peiris et al. (12) to viral RNA copies number values, where these

239

quantities are inversely proportional to each other (18).

240
241

Mathematical model

242

To parameterise coronavirus infection dynamics from patient viral load data,

243

we derived a simplified mathematical model from the following virus dynamics

244

model:

where the variables 𝑇𝑇(𝑡𝑡), 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡) and 𝑉𝑉(𝑡𝑡) are the numbers of uninfected target cells,

infected target cells, and the amount of virus at time 𝑡𝑡, respectively. The parameters

252

the clearance rate of virus is typically much larger than the death rate of the infected

253

cells in vivo (10, 19, 20), we made a quasi-steady state (QSS) assumption,

254

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡)⁄𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 0 , and replaced Eq.(3) with 𝑉𝑉(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡)⁄𝑐𝑐 . Because data on the

255
256
257
258

numbers of coronavirus RNA copies, 𝑉𝑉(𝑡𝑡), rather than the number of infected cells,
𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡), were available, then 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡)⁄𝑝𝑝 was substituted into Eq.(2) to obtain
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡) 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
=
𝑇𝑇(𝑡𝑡)𝑉𝑉(𝑡𝑡) − 𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿(𝑡𝑡).

259

Furthermore, we defined the ratio of the number of uninfected target cells at time 𝑡𝑡 to

260

the initial number of uninfected target cells 𝑇𝑇(0) , that is, 𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑇𝑇(𝑡𝑡)⁄𝑇𝑇(0) .

Accordingly, we obtained the following simplified mathematical model, which we

261

employed to analyse the data in this study:

262

263
264
265

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡)
= −𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽(𝑡𝑡)𝑉𝑉(𝑡𝑡),
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡)
= 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾(𝑡𝑡)𝑉𝑉(𝑡𝑡) − 𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿(𝑡𝑡),
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

(5)
(6)

where 𝛾𝛾 = 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝(0)/𝑐𝑐 is defined as the maximum viral replication rate for coronavirus

266

infections. Note that the ratio 𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡) is always less than or equal to 1.

267

for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and in nasopharyngeal/sputum/tracheal aspirate

268

for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In the case of acute coronavirus infection, the loss

269

of target cells by physiological turnover could be ignored, considering the long life-

270

span of the target cells. Patient viral load data for SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV/MERS-

In silico experiments for possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies

276

By utilising our novel mathematical model and the estimated parameter

277

values, we investigated the antiviral effects of unlicensed but developing (promising)

278

drugs with the following different mechanisms of action, depending on inhibition rates

279

and timings of therapy initiation: (i) blocking de novo infection (e.g. via human

280

neutralising antibodies, viral entry-inhibitors and antibody levels raised by

281

vaccination (13, 14)); (ii) blocking virus production (such as lopinavir/ritonavir (HIV

282

protease inhibitors), remdesivir (an anti-Ebola virus candidate) and other nucleoside

283

analogues, and interferon (15, 16)); and (iii) promoting cytotoxicity (by adaptive

284

immunity such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes). To simulate possible variations in the

285

viral load and in the target cell numbers under these different types of anti-SARS-

286

CoV-2 therapy, the median parameter sets were used to predict the expected

287

outcome of each therapy. In other words, even though no drug administration trials

288

have been conducted yet, we were able to infer the efficacy of each drug treatment

289

based on our in silico experiments. We implemented the different mechanisms of

290

action in the model as follows:

291

(i) Blocking de novo infection. The antiviral effect of blocking de novo infection

where 𝐻𝐻(𝑡𝑡) is a Heaviside step function defined as 𝐻𝐻(𝑡𝑡) = 0 if 𝑡𝑡 < 𝑡𝑡 ∗ : otherwise

𝐻𝐻(𝑡𝑡) = 1. We evaluated the expected antiviral effect of the therapy under different
inhibition rates (𝜀𝜀) and initiation timings (𝑡𝑡 ∗ ) using our estimated parameter values.

virus production of 0 < 𝜂𝜂 ≤ 1. The antiviral effect by blocking virus production (0 <

that the former reduces 𝛽𝛽, whereas the latter reduces 𝑝𝑝 in the full model (1)-(3).

patient variability. Including a random effect amounts to a partial pooling of the data

324

between individuals to improve estimates of the parameters applicable across the

325

population of patients. By using this approach, the differences between viral

326

dynamics in different patients were not estimated explicitly, nor did we fully pool the

327

data which would bias estimates towards highly sampled patients. In this method of

328

estimation, each parameter estimate 𝜗𝜗𝑖𝑖 (= 𝜗𝜗 × 𝑒𝑒 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 ) depends on the individual where

329

parameters and initial values for patients are summarized in Table S1. Using

estimated individual parameters and a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, the

conditional distribution is obtained which can represent the uncertainty in individual

parameter values. We obtained 100 sets of estimated parameters for each individual

patient by fitting the simplified mathematical model (Eqs. (5-6)) to the data. The

338

estimation was performed for viral loads in throat swab from SARS-CoV-2, mild

339

MERS-CoV, and severe MERS-CoV separately, and the distributions of the

340

parameters were compared and tested using the bootstrap t-test. Due to the small

sample size for viral loads in sputum/tracheal aspirate for MERS-CoV, we assumed
