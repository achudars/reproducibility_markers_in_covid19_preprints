SUMMARY
The December 2019 outbreak of a novel respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2, has become an ongoing
global pandemic due in part to the challenge of identifying symptomatic, asymptomatic and presymptomatic carriers of the virus. CRISPR-based diagnostics that utilize RNA and DNA-targeting
enzymes can augment gold-standard PCR-based testing if they can be made rapid, portable and
accurate. Here we report the development of an amplification-free CRISPR-Cas13a-based mobile
phone assay for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal swab RNA extracts. The assay
achieved ~100 copies/µL sensitivity in under 30 minutes and accurately detected a set of positive
clinical samples in under 5 minutes. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to
improve sensitivity and specificity, and we directly quantified viral load using enzyme kinetics.
Combined with mobile phone-based quantification, this assay can provide rapid, low-cost, pointof-care screening to aid in the control of SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION
In late 2019, a novel infectious respiratory RNA virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2, emerged in the human population, likely from a zoonotic source
(Wang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). In most people, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes mild or no
symptoms. Critically, however, asymptomatic or lowly symptomatic carriers spread the virus (Lee
et al., 2020), leading to delayed isolation of carriers and massive worldwide spread (Bai et al.,
2020; Lavezzo et al., 2020).
The current gold-standard diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2 infection, quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), is well established and widely used for
screening. Based on primers directed against the nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), and open
reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) genes, RT-qPCR has an analytical limit of detection (LOD) of 1,000
viral RNA copies/mL (1 copy/µL) (Vogels et al., 2020). However, recent modeling of viral dynamics
suggests that frequent testing with a fast turn-around time is required to break the current
pandemic (Larremore et al., 2020). Notably, the model ranked sensitivity of the test as a lower
priority, and estimated that an LOD of 100,000 copies/mL (100 copies/µL) would be sufficient for
screening (Larremore et al., 2020). In clinical studies, when the viral load drops below a million
copies/mL (1,000 copies/µL), few infectious particles are detected and consequently the risk of
viral transmission is low (La Scola et al., 2020; Quicke et al., 2020; Wolfel et al., 2020). Since the
high sensitivity of RT-qPCR may pick up RNAs freed by infected and dead cells after infectious
particles have waned, use of qPCR for screening may lead to unnecessary isolation of individuals
that are SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive but no longer infectious (Alexandersen et al., 2020).
The need for SARS-CoV-2 tests that are rapid, widespread, and able to identify infectious
individuals has motivated efforts to explore new strategies for viral RNA detection based on
CRISPR technology. Cas12 and Cas13 proteins are RNA-guided components of bacterial
adaptive immune systems that directly target single- and double-stranded DNA or single-stranded

(ss)RNA substrates, respectively (Abudayyeh et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018; East-Seletsky et al.,
2016; Zetsche et al., 2015). Cas13 is complexed with a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) containing a
programmable spacer sequence to form a nuclease-inactive ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP).
When the RNP binds to a complementary target RNA, it activates the HEPN (higher eukaryotes
and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding domain) motifs of Cas13 that then indiscriminately cleave any
surrounding ssRNAs. Target RNA binding and subsequent Cas13 cleavage activity can therefore
be detected with a fluorophore-quencher pair linked by an ssRNA, which will fluoresce after
cleavage by active Cas13 (East-Seletsky et al., 2016). To date, four type VI CRISPR-Cas13
subtypes have been identified: Cas13a (previously known as C2c2) (Abudayyeh et al., 2016;
East-Seletsky et al., 2016; Shmakov et al., 2015), Cas13b (Smargon et al., 2017), Cas13c
(Shmakov et al., 2017), and Cas13d (Konermann et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018).
What initially evolved as a successful strategy in bacteria to destroy incoming phages and
build a immunological memory is now being harnessed for viral diagnostics (Chen et al., 2018;
East-Seletsky et al., 2016; Gootenberg et al., 2018; Gootenberg et al., 2017; Myhrvold et al.,
2018). To achieve high sensitivity, current CRISPR diagnostic (CRISPR Dx) strategies rely on
pre-amplification of target RNA for subsequent detection by a Cas protein. In the case of the RNAsensing Cas13 proteins, this typically entails the conversion of RNA to DNA by reverse
transcription, DNA-based amplification (i.e., isothermal amplification, loop-mediated isothermal
amplification), and transcription back to RNA for detection by Cas13a or Cas13b, called
“SHERLOCK” (Gootenberg et al., 2018; Gootenberg et al., 2017). This was recently adapted for
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (Joung et al., 2020), and further developed as “SHINE” for testing
unextracted samples (Arizti-Sanz et al., 2020). The conversion of amplified DNA back into RNA
can be avoided by using the DNA-sensing Cas12 for detection, a method called “DETECTR”
(Chen et al., 2018), which has recently been adapted for SARS-CoV-2 detection (Broughton et
al., 2020). Both SHERLOCK and DETECTR reactions take approximately an hour to complete

and can be read out with paper-based lateral flow strips appropriate for point-of-care use,
although their current FDA-approved protocols are still laboratory-based.
Here, we report the development and demonstration of a rapid CRISPR-Cas13a-based
assay for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This assay, unlike previous CRISPR
diagnostics, does not require pre-amplification of the viral genome for detection. By directly
detecting the viral RNA without additional manipulations, the test yields quantitative RNA
measurements rather than simply a positive or negative result. To demonstrate the simplicity and
portability of this assay, we measure fluorescence with a mobile phone camera in a compact
device that includes low-cost laser illumination and collection optics. The high sensitivity of mobile
phone cameras, together with their connectivity, GPS and data-processing capabilities, have
made them attractive tools for point-of-care disease diagnosis in low-resource regions (Breslauer
et al., 2009; D'Ambrosio et al., 2015; Kamgno et al., 2017; Wood et al., 2019). By combining
multiple crRNAs to increase Cas13a activation and analyzing the change in fluorescence over
time rather than solely endpoint fluorescence, we are able to achieve SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA
detection of ~100 copies/µL within 30 minutes. We also correctly identified all SARS-CoV-2
positive patient samples tested (Ct values 14.37 to 22.13) within 5 minutes. This approach has
the potential to enable a fast, accurate, portable, and low-cost option for point-of care SARS-CoV2 screening.

RESULTS
Quantitative Direct Detection of Viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA with Cas13a
When the SARS-CoV-2 sequence became public in January 2020, we set out to develop
a Cas13-based direct-detection assay for viral RNA that would avoid the need for amplification
and enable point-of-care testing. To do this, we needed to optimize Cas13 activation through
careful crRNA selection and develop a sensitive and portable fluorescence detection system for
our assay (Figure 1A). Initially, we designed 12 crRNAs along the nucleocapsid (N) gene of
SARS-CoV-2, corresponding to the three Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) N
primer sets and the N primer set developed early in the pandemic in Wuhan, China (Zhu et al.,
2020). Every Cas13-crRNA RNP should detect a single 20-nucleotide region in the N gene (Figure
1B).
We first tested each crRNA individually in a direct-detection assay on a plate reader. We
selected the Cas13a homolog from Leptotrichia buccalis (Lbu) as it demonstrated the highest
sensitivity and robust trans-cleavage activity relative to other characterized Cas13a homologs
(East-Seletsky et al., 2017; East-Seletsky et al., 2016). The assay used purified LbuCas13a (EastSeletsky et al., 2017; East-Seletsky et al., 2016) and a quenched fluorescent RNA reporter (EastSeletsky et al., 2017; East-Seletsky et al., 2016), together with in vitro transcribed (IVT) target
RNA corresponding to the viral N gene (nucleotide positions 28274–29531). At a target RNA
concentration of 480 fM (2.89 x 105 copies/µl), we identified 10 crRNAs with reactivity above the
RNP alone control that contained the same RNP and probe but no target RNA (Figure 1C). The
use of RNase-free buffers minimized background fluorescence, and the plate reader gain and
filter bandwidth settings were optimized to capture low-level reporter cleavage. Similar results
were obtained when full-length viral RNA was used as target RNA (Supplemental Figure 1A). For
the initial studies, we selected two crRNAs (crRNAs 2 and 4) that generated the greatest Cas13a
activation as determined by the fluorescent reporter while maintaining low levels of targetindependent fluorescence (indicated by the RNP alone curve).

We next carried out serial dilutions of the target RNA to independently determine the limit
of detection for each crRNA. LbuCas13a exhibited detectable reporter cleavage with as little as
10 fM (~6000 copies/µL) of target RNA (East-Seletsky et al., 2017). Consistent with this, we found
that RNPs made with either crRNA 2 and crRNA 4 did not appear to generate signals above the
RNP controls for an IVT target RNA concentration of 1,000 copies/µL (Figure 1d). The signal
generated by direct detection with Cas13a appeared proportional to the concentration of target
RNA in the assay. Given that the signal generated depends solely on the RNase activity of
Cas13a, the linear rate of the reaction should approximate Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics. To
determine if our assay was indeed quantitative, we compared the slopes determined by linear
regression for different target RNA concentrations, using 1 to 10 µM KM and 600/s Kcat for the
modeling (Slaymaker et al., 2019) (Figure 1E). The results confirmed that crRNA 2 and 4 each
facilitated detection of at least 10,000 copies/µL of IVT N gene RNA. Since the measured slopes
are proportional to the concentration of activated Cas13a, we could confirm that the rate of
Cas13a activity scaled with concentration of target RNA (Supplementary Figure 2). This ability to
estimate target RNA concentration from the measured slope allows for direct quantification of viral
load in unknown samples.
Combining crRNAs Improves Sensitivity of Cas13a
We next wondered whether combining crRNAs to form two different populations of RNPs
in the same reaction could enhance overall Cas13a activation and, therefore, the sensitivity of the
direct detection assay. In theory, a single target RNA could activate multiple Cas13a RNPs if each
RNP is directed to different regions of the same viral target RNA, effectively doubling the active
enzyme concentration (Figure 2A). To test this, we combined crRNAs 2 and 4 in the same
reaction, keeping the total concentration of Cas13a RNPs constant but divided equally between
RNPs made with each crRNA. We found that combining crRNA 2 and 4 markedly increased the
slope of the detection reaction and the sensitivity of the reaction when measured with a fixed IVT

target RNA concentration (480 fM) (Figure 2B). The slope increased from 213 AU/min (SE ± 1.6)
(crRNA 2) and 159 AU/min (SE ± 1.7) (crRNA 4), individually, to 383 AU/min (SE ± 3.0) in
combination, without increasing the slope of the RNP control reactions. This nearly doubling of
the average slope compared to the individual crRNA reactions demonstrates the advantage of
crRNA combinations.
To determine how crRNA combinations affect the limit of detection, we tested crRNA 2+4
with a dilution series of IVT N gene RNA. The RNP combination improved the limit of detection,
compared to the no-target RNP control (RNP 2+4), below 1,000 copies/µL of IVT target RNA
(Figure 2C). We performed the same assay with full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA isolated from the
supernatant of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero CCL-81 cells and found the limit of detection was 270
full-length viral copies/µL (Slope 12.4 ± SE 0.3) (Figure 2D). Viral copy numbers were determined
by standard RT-qPCR. The difference between the viral IVT and full genome limits of detection
could be explained by different quantification techniques of the target RNA or by considerable
secondary structure in the viral RNA (Manfredonia et al., 2020; Sanders et al., 2020) that reduces
RNP on-rates, thereby lowering the affinity of the RNP for the target (Abudayyeh et al., 2016).
One major advantage of CRISPR diagnostics is that they can be highly specific. To confirm
the specificity of our crRNAs, we tested them against a set of other respiratory viruses, including
alphacoronavirus HCoV-NL63 and betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which are among seven coronaviruses that infect human
hosts and cause respiratory diseases (Fung and Liu, 2019). We extracted RNA from the
supernatant of Huh 7.5.1-ACE2 or Vero E6 cells infected with HCoV-NL63 or HCoV-OC43,
respectively, and produced IVT N gene RNA from MERS-CoV. In our Cas13a direct-detection
assay with crRNA 2 and 4, individually and in combination, we detected no signal above RNP
background for any of viral RNAs tested (Figure 3A). Similarly, no signal was detected with H1N1

Influenza A or Influenza B viral RNA, or with RNA extracted from primary human airway organoids
(Figure 3B).
Cas13a Directly Detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Patient Samples
We next examined whether our assay could be used with patient samples, where the swab
and patient matrix (e.g., mucous from a nasal swab) could contribute additional background signal
and reduce sensitivity. To increase assay performance prior to testing patient samples, we
examined an additional set of crRNAs (crRNAs 19-22) targeting the viral E gene, based on
published PCR primer and Cas12 guide sets (Corman et al., 2020) (Broughton et al., 2020)
(Supplementary Figure 3A). When tested against full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the crRNA that
performed best, both individually (Supplementary Figure 3B) and in combination with crRNA 2
and 4, was crRNA 21 (Figure 3D). When tested on RNA from five SARS-CoV-2-confirmed
negative nasal swab samples, the triple combination (RNP 2+4+21) also did not exhibit signal
above the RNP control reaction (Figure 3C).
To determine if adding crRNA 21 would improve the limit of detection of our assay, we
tested a combination reaction with crRNAs 2+4+21 on precisely titered SARS-CoV-2 genomic
RNA obtained from the Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository
(BEI Resources). In serial dilution experiments over 2 hours using 20 replicate reactions, the triple
combination detected as few as 31 copies/µL (Figure 3D, left), based on the viral copy number
independently determined by BEI with digital droplet (dd) PCR. By comparing the slope of an
individual reaction with that of the RNP control, we determined that, for all dilutions, 20/20
individual tests (100%) would be correctly identified as “positive” with the 95% confidence level
(Figure 3D, right).
Finally, we obtained five de-identified RNA samples extracted from nasal swabs taken
from SARS-CoV-2+ individuals. Clinical RT-qPCR measurements resulted in Ct values of 14.37–
22.13 for the patient samples, correlating to copy numbers 2.08 x 107–1.27 x 105 copies/µL. We

added 0.3 µL of RNA from Patient Swabs 1-4 and 0.26 µL of RNA from Patient Swab 5 to each
20 µL Cas13a reaction (in triplicate). Using the direct detection assay on a plate reader, we
correctly identified all five positive samples (ranging from 3.2 x 105–1.65 x 103 copies/µL in the
Cas13a reaction), which showed slopes significantly above that of the RNP control (Figure 3E).
The slopes correlated significantly with their input copy number (Pearson r coefficient = 0.9966,
two-tailed p value = 0.0002), reinforcing the quantitative nature of the assay.
Harnessing the Mobile Phone Camera as a Portable Plate Reader
To demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 screening with Cas13a can be used outside of
laboratory settings, we designed a mobile phone-based fluorescence microscope that measures
the fluorescent signal generated by the Cas13a direct-detection assay (Figure 4A). Contrary to
our expectation that a commercial laboratory plate reader would perform better than a mobile
phone-based detection system, we found that our device was approximately an order of
magnitude more sensitive than the plate reader due to reduced measurement noise and the ability
to collect more time points, which decreased the uncertainty in slope estimations (Supplementary
Figure 4).
We tested the performance of the device for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the triplecrRNA Cas13a assay and a dilution series with full viral RNA isolated from supernatants of
infected Vero CCL-81 cells (Figures 4B-D). As with the plate reader, fluorescence generated in
each reaction chamber was collected over time, with measurements every 30 seconds, showing
a steady increase in fluorescence for full-length virus concentrations of 500–200 copies/µL,
compared to RNP controls (Figure 4B). As before, the slopes of each curve can be calculated,
along with the 95% confidence interval indicated by the error bars (Figure 4C). To determine the
limit of detection of the direct detection assay on the device, 7-11 replicates each of dilution of
virus corresponding to 500, 200, 100, and 50 copies/µL were measured, as determined by RTqPCR. Slopes were calculated based on data for the first 30, 20, and 10 min of the assay, and

each slope was then compared to the RNP control slope calculated over the same time. For each
dilution and assay time, the ability of the assay to detect the target RNA relative to the RNP control
was quantified as percent accuracy, with eight positive tests out of eight replicates for 500
copies/µL for all assay times corresponding to 100% accuracy (Figure 4D). The results over all
dilutions indicate that the limit of detection is approximately 200 copies/µL in under 30 minutes,
with accuracy dropping to 50% at 50 copies/µL.
Next, we analyzed the same patient samples as in Figure 3e to compare detection on the
plate reader to that on the mobile phone-based device. We imaged each reaction for 60 minutes,
along with the RNP control (Figure 4E), and the slope for a patient with Ct = 17.65 (Positive Swab
3) is significantly greater than the slope for a patient with Ct = 20.37 (Positive Swab 4) (Figure
4F), as expected. To assess the detection accuracy, we performed a linear fit using data from the
first 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes of the run and compared the slope of each sample to the RNP
control. We determined all five samples to be positive within the first 5 minutes of the assay,
indicating that the device can provide a very fast turnaround time of results for patients with
clinically relevant viral loads (Figure 4G). This result highlights the inherent tradeoff between
sensitivity and time in the Cas13a direct detection assay. High viral loads can be detected very
rapidly because their high signals can be quickly determined to be above the control, and low viral
loads can be detected at longer times once their signal can be distinguished above the control. In
this way, our assay demonstrates a time-dependent sensitivity (Supplementary Figure 5) that can
potentially be tuned to address both screening applications and more sensitive diagnostic
applications.

DISCUSSION
Here we show that direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with CRISPR-Cas13a and a
mobile phone offers a promising option for rapid, point-of-care testing. A key advance in this work
is demonstrating that combinations of crRNAs can increase the sensitivity of Cas13a directdetection by activating more Cas13a per target RNA. We show that combinations of two or three
crRNAs can be used to detect viral target RNA in the attomolar range or as few as ~30 copies/µL.
The use of multiple crRNAs that target different parts of the genome also safeguards against a
potential loss of detection due to naturally occurring viral mutations.
A second key advance is the ability to directly translate the fluorescent signal into viral
loads. Other CRISPR Dx assays, such as CRISPR-COVID, achieve high sensitivity via isothermal
amplification but provide only qualitative information rather than information on viral copy number.
Fluorescent signal from 7500 copies/µL to 7.5 copies/µL are remarkably similar, despite three
orders of magnitude difference in copy number (Hou et al., 2020). By avoiding amplification and
employing direct-detection, we show that the reaction rate directly correlates with viral copy
number and may be used for quantification. When coupled with frequent testing, quantitative data
are potentially beneficial: the course of a patient’s infection can be monitored, and one can
determine if the infection is increasing or decreasing. In symptomatic cases, viral loads follow the
course of the infection (Wolfel et al., 2020). Notably, samples with viral loads below 106 copies/mL
or 1000 copies/µL did not yield viral isolates in one study in Germany (Wolfel et al., 2020). Less
is known about infectivity in asymptomatic cases, but SARS-CoV-2 transmission from
asymptomatic patients has been documented (Bai et al., 2020), and asymptomatic patients may
have viral RNA loads similar to those of symptomatic patients (Lee et al., 2020). Monitoring viral
loads quantitatively will allow estimation of infection stage and will help predict infectivity, recovery
and return from quarantine in real time.

A third key advance in our work is that a mobile phone-based device can accurately read
the direct-detection assay, enabling ~100 copies/µL sensitivity in 30 minutes and accurate
diagnosis of a set of patient samples in 5 minutes. The device avoids the need for a bulky
laboratory-based plate reader, makes the assay portable, and opens up the possibility for future
point-of-care or at-home use. The choice of a mobile phone as the basis for our detection device
was motivated by the high sensitivity of current mobile phone cameras, the simplicity of integrating
a mobile phone for detection, their robustness and cost-effectiveness, and the fact that they are
widely available today, meaning that they do not compete with other devices for limited production
resources in the midst of a pandemic. For similar reasons, previous diagnostic efforts utilized
mobile phones to detect fluorescent signals generated by molecular diagnostic, such as loopmediated isothermal amplification (Chen et al., 2017; Ganguli et al., 2017; Kong et al., 2017; Priye
et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2020), PCR (Angus et al., 2015; Gou et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2014), nextgeneration DNA sequencing (Kuhnemund et al., 2017), and recombinase polymerase
amplification reaction (Chan et al., 2018). Combined with efficient contact tracing and HIPAAcompliant upload into cloud-based systems, a mobile phone-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic could
play an important role in control of the current and future pandemics.
The direct-detection assay reported here, if scaled up, could fulfill the need for a test that
provides rapid results and is available to be administered frequently (Larremore et al., 2020).
Other tests in this category include Abbott Lab’s ID NOW, a PCR-based test, and several antigen
tests, such as Quidel’s Sofia 2 SARS Antigen FIA and Abbot Lab’s BinaxNOW Antigen Test. In
the case of influenza, antigen tests span a wide range of sensitivities (e.g., 51–67.5%) (Babin et
al., 2011; Chartrand et al., 2012; Chu et al., 2012). Due to the low-to-moderate sensitivity of these
tests, the CDC still recommends re-testing samples that are negative with a more sensitive test,
such as RT-qPCR (Green and StGeorge, 2018). Notably, none of the current rapid testing options
provides quantitative results, which could help assess vial dynamics and evaluate an individual’s
level of infection and progression of disease.

While we demonstrate rapid detection with reasonable sensitivity using crRNAs based on
existing PCR primers, we anticipate further improvement by systematically searching for the best
crRNA combinations across the entire viral RNA genome. As more information becomes available
about viral variants (Osorio and Correia-Neves, 2020; Vanaerschot et al., 2020), crRNA design
can be adapted to avoid false negatives or to specifically differentiate viral variants in the assay.
Further improvements are also anticipated in the reporter, the choice of Cas13 orthologs and
homologs, and in device and camera sensitivity. These advancements can improve the rate of
the reaction, allowing for improvements in detection accuracy and limit of detection in shorter
periods of time.
A recent national survey of over 19,000 respondents showed that the average wait time
for nasal swab-based qPCR test results was 4.1 days, with 31% of tests taking more than 4 days
and 10% of tests taking 10 days or more (Lazer et al., 2020). The national backlog in processing
these laboratory-based tests clearly illustrates the need for rapid, point-of-care tests that can
reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. As the long-term immunity induced by natural infection or
vaccination may decay in as little as 2–4 months (Ibarrondo et al., 2020; Long et al., 2020), the
need for rapid and frequent testing for SARS-CoV-2 will likely remain. In the future, direct
detection by Cas13a as outlined here could be quickly modified to target the next respiratory
pathogen that emerges, hopefully in time to help curb global spread.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1: Quantitative Direct Detection of Viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA with Cas13a
(A) Schematic of a Cas13a (beige)-crRNA (red) RNP complex binding target RNA (black),
resulting in activation of the HEPN nuclease (denoted by scissors) domain. Upon target
recognition and RNP activation, Cas13a indiscriminately cleaves a quenched-fluorophore RNA
reporter, allowing for fluorescence detection as a proxy for Cas13a activation and target RNA.
(B) Schematic of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene, and the corresponding locations of
each crRNA spacer region.
(C) Cas13a RNPs made individually with each crRNA (final RNP complex concentration of 50
nM) were tested against 2.9 x 105 copies/µL (480 fM) of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro transcribed N gene
RNA in a total 20 µL reaction volume. Background fluorescence by the individual RNP in the
absence of target RNA is shown as “RNP.” Raw fluorescence values over two hours is shown.
Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three technical replicates.
(D) Limit of detection of crRNA 2 and crRNA 4 was determined by testing each 100 nM of each
RNP individually against 105, 104, and 103 copies/µL of N gene IVT RNA. “RNP 2” and “RNP 4”
represent no target RNA RNP alone controls. Background correction of fluorescence was
performed by subtraction of reporter alone fluorescence values. Data are represented as mean ±
standard error of the difference between means of three technical replicates.
(E) Slope of the curve over two hours from Figure 1D was calculated by simple linear regression
and shown as slope ± 95% confidence interval. Slopes were compared to the RNP alone control
through an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA): ****p<0.0001, ***p<0.001, ns=not significantly
higher than RNP control.

(A) Schematic of two different RNPs binding to different locations of the same SARS-CoV-2 RNA,
leading to cleavage of the RNA reporter and increased fluorescence.
(B) RNPs made with crRNA 2 and crRNA 4 individually and in combination (50 nM total RNP

2,” “RNP 4,” and “RNP 2+4”). Background correction of fluorescence was performed by
subtraction of reporter alone fluorescence values. Data are represented as mean ± standard error
of the difference between means of three technical replicates.
(C) Limit of detection of crRNA 2 and crRNA 4 in combination was determined by combining 50
nM of RNP 2 and 50 nM of RNP 4 (100 nM total RNP) against 1,000, 100, and 1 copy/µL of
SARS-CoV-2 IVT RNA (n=3, technical replicates). Slope of the curve over two hours was
calculated by simple linear regression and is shown as slope ± 95% confidence interval. Slopes
were compared to the no target RNA RNP alone control using ANCOVA: ****p<0.0001,
**p=0.0076, ns=not significant.
(D) Limit of detection of crRNA 2 and crRNA 4 in combination was determined by combining 50
nM of RNP 2 and 50 nM of RNP 4 (100 nM total RNP) against 1.35 x 103, 5.4 x 102, 2.7 x 102,
and 1.8 x 102 copies/µL of SARS-CoV-2 full-length viral RNA as quantified by qPCR (n=3,
technical replicates). Slope of the curve over two hours was calculated by simple linear regression
and is shown as slope ± 95% confidence interval. Slopes were compared to the no target RNA
RNP alone control using ANCOVA: ****p<0.0001, ***p=0.0002, **p=0.0023, ns=not significant.

METHODS
Cas13a protein expression and purification
Expression vectors deposited with Addgene (Plasmid #83482) were used for expression of
LbuCas13a. The codon-optimized Cas13a genomic sequences are N-terminally tagged with a
His6-MBP-TEV cleavage site sequence, with expression driven by a T7 promoter. Purification of
was based off of a previously published protocol with some modifications (East-Seletsky et al.,
2017; East-Seletsky et al., 2016). Briefly, expression vectors were transformed into Rosetta2 DE3
or BL21 E. coli cells grown in Terrific broth at 37°C, induced at mid-log phase (OD600 ~0.6) with
0.5 mM IPTG, and then transferred to 16°C for overnight expression. Cell pellets were
resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, 0.5
mM PMSF, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche)), lysed by sonication, and clarified by
centrifugation at 35,000xg. Soluble His6-MBP-TEV-Cas13a was isolated over metal ion affinity
chromatography, and in order to cleave off the His6- MBP tag, the protein-containing eluate was
incubated with TEV protease at 4°C overnight while dialyzing into ion exchange buffer (50 mM
Tris-Cl pH 7.0, 250 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP). Cleaved protein was loaded onto a HiTrap
SP column (GE Healthcare) and eluted over a linear KCl (0.25-1.0M) gradient. Cas13a containing
fractions were pooled, concentrated, and further purified via size-exclusion chromatography on a
S200 column (GE Healthcare) in gel filtration buffer (20 mM HEPES-K pH 7.0, 200 mM KCl, 10%
glycerol, 1 mM TCEP) and were subsequently flash frozen for storage at -80°C.
In vitro RNA transcription
SARS-CoV-2 N gene was transcribed off a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide template (IDT).
HCoV-MERS N gene was transcribed off of a MERS-CoV Control plasmid (IDT, Cat # 10006624)
by first adding a T7 promoter via PCR using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) (see table
for primers). A single PCR product was confirmed via gel electrophoresis. In vitro transcription
was performed using HiScribe T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB) following
manufacturer’s recommendations. Template DNA was removed by addition of DNase I (NEB),
and IVT RNA was subsequently purified using RNA STAT-60 (AMSBIO) and the Direct-Zol RNA
MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research). RNA concentration was quantified by Nanodrop and copy number
was calculated using transcript length and concentration.
SARS-CoV-2 virus culture
Isolate USA-WA1/2020 of SARS-CoV-2 was used for full-length viral RNA. All live virus
experiments were performed in a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. SARS-CoV-2 stocks were
propagated in Vero CCL-81 cells. Viral supernatant was collected by centrifugation for RNA
extraction (see below).
HCoV-NL63 virus culture
Isolate Amsterdam I of HCoV-NL63 (NR-470, BEI Resources) was propagated in Huh7.5.1-ACE2
cells. Supernatant was harvested 5 days post infection, filtered and stored at -80C.
HCoV-OC43 virus culture
HCoV-OC43 (VR-1558, ATCC) was propagated in Vero E6 cells. Supernatant was harvested 6
days post infection, filtered and stored at -80C.
Influenza virus
H1N1 Influenza virus A (California/04/2009) and Influenza virus B (Brisbane/60/2008) in chicken
allantoic fluid was purchased from Virapur and used directly for RNA extraction (see below).

RNA extraction
RNA was extracted from SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, Influenza A, and Influenza B
viral supernatant via RNA STAT-60 (AMSBIO) and the Direct-Zol RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo
Research). RNA was extracted from human airway organoid cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen).
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction
RNA from SARS-CoV-2 viral supernatant was quantified via qPCR. Briefly, RNA was reverse
transcribed to cDNA via AMV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) using oligo(dt)18 and random
hexamers (Thermo Scientific). cDNA was added to the qPCR reaction using PrimeTime Gene
Expression Master Mix (IDT). N and E gene standards were used to generate a standard curve
for copy number quantification. N gene standard was generated by PCR from the 2019nCoV_N_Positive Control Plasmid (IDT, Cat #10006625). E gene standard was generated by
PCR using extracted full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA as template. A single product was confirmed
by gel electrophoresis and DNA was quantified by Nanodrop. cDNA was analyzed using the 7500
Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). See table for primers.
Fluorescent Cas13a nuclease assays
LbuCas13a-crRNA RNP complexes were individually preassembled by incubating 1.33 µM of
LbuCas13a with 1.33 µM of crRNA for 15 minutes at room temperature. In Figures 1C and 2B,
677 nM of crRNA was used. These complexes were then diluted to 100 nM LbuCas13a and 100
nM (or 50 nM for Figures 1C and 2B) crRNA in cleavage buffer (20 mM HEPES-Na pH 6.8, 50
mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 5% glycerol) in the presence of 400 nM of reporter RNA (5’-FAMrUrUrUrUrU-IowaBlack FQ-3’), 1 U/µL Murine RNase Inhibitor (NEB, Cat #M0314), and varying
amounts of target RNA. In Figures 1C and 2B, 167 nM of RNase Alert substrate (IDT) was used
as the reporter RNA, and in Figure 2D, 400 nM of RNase Alert substrate was used. In Figure 3D
and 3E, the complexes were also diluted in 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma) and the cleavage buffer was
pH 7.1. These reactions were incubated in a fluorescence plate reader for up to 120 minutes at
37°C with fluorescence measurements taken every 5 minutes (or every 2.5 minutes in Figure 3E)
(lex:485 nM; lem:535 nM). Background-corrected fluorescence values were obtained by
subtracting fluorescence values obtained from reactions carried out containing only reporter and
buffer. For assays containing more than one crRNA simultaneously, the LbuCas13a-crRNA RNP
complexes were separately assembled by incubating for 15 minutes at room temperature, then
combined in the reaction at half (in 2 RNP combinations) or one-third (in 3 RNP combinations)
the volume to keep the total or combined concentration of RNP constant. Representative graphs
of experiments are shown. Most experiments were replicated at least twice, with the exception of
Figure 3E (only Patient Swabs 1-3 and 5 were repeated twice) due to limited sample material.
Patient Samples
De-identified RNA samples from nasopharyngeal swabs from patients testing positive and
negative for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. Positive samples
were quantified previously using CDC N1 and N2 SARS-CoV-2 primers.
Mobile phone fluorescent microscope
We built a mobile phone fluorescent microscope using a 488 nm diode laser (Sharp 55mW, DTR’s
Laser Shop), a green fluorescence interference filter (Chroma Technology AT 535/40), and a
Pixel 4 XL phone camera (12.2 mega-pixel, pixel size 1.4μm, aperture f/1.7, Google). The laser
beam was expanded using a glass collimation lens (10° divergence half-angle) (DTR-G-8, DTR’s
Laser Shop), directed towards the sample plane using two ND4 filters used as mirrors (ND40B,
Thorlabs), and reduced by an elliptical aperture to fill the circular image field-of-view with a uniform

field intensity. The sample was illuminated with an oblique epi configuration and the illumination
power was 18 mW at the sample plane. The imaging optics consist of an f=20mm compact triplet
lens (TRH127-020-A, Thorlabs) followed by the interference filter for selection of the fluorescence
reporter emission wavelength and the Pixel 4 XL camera lens. Total magnification from object to
image plane is 1/3 and the numerical aperture is 0.06. All optical and illumination components
were enclosed in a custom-made dark box, into which a sample chip is loaded for imaging.
Automated time-lapse imaging was implemented by a custom Android application and a Bluetooth
receiver (Bluefruit Feather M0, Adafruit), which triggered the laser at the time of image acquisition.
The Cas13a reaction was performed by placing the device in a 37°C incubator for temperature
control and the reaction curve was obtained by analyzing the image time series offline using a
custom MATLAB (Mathworks) code.
Sample chip fabrication
Sample chips containing three fluid channels were made by casting polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS,
Ellsworth adhesives) on an acrylic mold. The acrylic mold was assembled by adhering three laser
cut acrylic lanes on a flat acrylic base. The width, height, and length of each acrylic lane were 2
mm, 2 mm, and 10 mm, respectively, resulting in a fluid channel volume of 40 µL. Inlet and outlet
ports were created on both ends of the channels after curing and demolding the PDMS using a
biopsy punch. The PDMS chips were subsequently adhered to a siliconized cover glass (Hampton
research) to close the fluid channels. To avoid generation of bubbles in the chip during the
measurement, both the Cas13a reaction mix and the sample chip were degassed in a house
vacuum for 15 minutes before loading the samples and starting the measurement.
Mobile phone image acquisition and analysis
During typical device operation, an RGB image was acquired every 30 seconds for the duration
of 1 hour and the images were analyzed offline using a custom MATLAB code. First, the RGB
image was demosaiced to a greyscale image. Second, the saturated pixels or pixels exhibiting
two very different green submosaic values were excluded. Third, a rectangular image region-ofinterest (ROI) was drawn within an area of each fluid channel and the reporter signal in each ROI
was determined by averaging the pixel values.
Quantification and statistical analysis
Data in Figures 1-3 were processed and visualized using GraphPad Prism.
