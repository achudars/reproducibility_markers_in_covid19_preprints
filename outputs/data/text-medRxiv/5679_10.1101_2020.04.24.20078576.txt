Serological testing remains a passive component of the current public health response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Using a transmission model, we examined how serology can be
implemented to allow seropositive individuals to increase levels of social interaction while
offsetting transmission risks. We simulated the use of widespread serological testing in three
metropolitan areas with different initial outbreak timing and severity characteristics: New York
City, South Florida, and Washington Puget Sound. In our model, we use realistic serological
assay characteristics, in which tested seropositive individuals partially restore their social
contacts and act as immunological ‘shields’. Compared to a scenario with no intervention,
beginning a mass serological testing program on November 1, 2020 was predicted to avert
15,000 deaths (28% reduction, 95% CrI: 0.4%-30.2%) in New York City, 3,000 (31.1%
reduction, 95% CrI: 26.4%-33.3%) in South Florida and 10,000 (60.3% reduction, 95% CrI:
50.2%-60.7%) in Washington State by June 2021. In all three sites, widespread serological
testing substantially blunted new waves of transmission. Serological testing has the potential to
mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic while also allowing a substantial number of
individuals to safely return to social interactions and economic activity.
Significance: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led many countries to implement broadly impactful
social distancing interventions. In the U.S., many measures are still partially in place. While
these policies slowed the epidemic, they also caused substantial social and economic disruption.
Here, we explore how using available serological assays to inform the individualized relaxation
of social distancing could allow a gradual return to more normal levels of economic and social
activity while mitigating public health risk. We find that large scale serological testing in major
metropolitan areas has the potential to lower expected COVID-19 deaths, reduce peak health
system burden to manageable levels, and also allow social distancing interventions to be
substantially relaxed.

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in late 2019 leading to the pandemic of COVID-19, with over
50 million detected cases and over 1.2 million deaths globally as of November 9, with nearly 10
million detected cases and 237,000 deaths reported in the U.S. by that same date (1).
Unprecedented social distancing measures were enacted in early 2020 to reduce transmission and
thereby blunt the epidemic peak (i.e. “flatten the curve”). In early March, U.S. states began to
close schools, suspend public gatherings, and encourage employees to work from home if
possible. By mid-April, 95% of the U.S. (2) and over 30% of the global population were under
some form of shelter-in-place order (3). Federal social distancing guidelines expired on April
30, 2020; in late April and May, many state and local governments relaxed stay-at-home orders
partially or completely to move towards 're-opening' (4).
Relaxing these initially effective social distancing policies resulted in increased contacts and
community transmission, and case counts began to increase as states further relaxed restrictions
on public gatherings, restaurant dining, and operation of businesses (5). However, many
workplaces remain completely or partially closed, schools have transitioned to some level of
virtual instruction, and many businesses remain only partly operational. With the goal of
maintaining the reproductive number at or less than one, public health efforts advocate a gradual
return to such activities together with enhanced hygiene and mask-wearing, while maintaining
stricter distancing measures for individuals at higher risk (6).
In addition to these non-specific measures, a ‘shielding’ strategy could aim to identify and
deploy recovered (and likely immune) individuals as focal points for sustaining less risky
interactions via ‘interaction substitution’. This strategy has the objective of sustaining
interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services while reducing the risk
of exposing individuals who remain susceptible to infection. As the basis for a ‘shielding’
strategy, widespread serological testing programs have the potential to identify individuals or
groups who are likely immune, allowing some individuals to return to activities while keeping
deaths and hospital admissions at sufficiently low levels. In this strategy, individuals who test
positive would preferentially replace susceptible individuals in close-contact interactions, such
that more contacts are between susceptible and immune individuals rather than between
susceptible and potentially infectious individuals (7).
Recent serosurveys of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. vary in their estimates of seroprevalence but
collectively suggest that infections far outnumber documented cases (8–12). To the extent that
antibodies serve as a correlate of immunity, serological testing may be used to identify protected
individuals (13). While our understanding of the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2
infection remains incomplete, the vast majority of infected individuals seroconvert (14) , with
detectable antibody levels persisting at least several months after infection (15). Few reinfections
with SARS-CoV-2 have been documented, suggesting that, while possible, reinfection is rare.
Together, these data suggest that recovered individuals have substantial protection against
subsequent reinfection. Once identified, antibody test-positive individuals could return to pre2

pandemic levels of social interactions and therefore dilute (via ‘serological shielding’)
potentially risky interactions between susceptible and infectious individuals (7).

Such strategies, however, rely on correctly identifying immune individuals. There are currently
more than 50 serological assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that have been
approved for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration (16) with others currently in
development and approved in other countries (17). The performance of these tests varies
considerably (16,18,19). For the purpose of informing safe social distancing policies, specificity
rather than sensitivity is of primary concern. An imperfectly specific test will result in false
positives, leading to individuals being incorrectly classified as immune. If used as a basis to relax
social distancing measures, there is concern that this error could heighten risk for individuals
who test positive and lead to an increase in community transmission. For this reason, this paper
evaluates the integration of serological testing into a COVID-19 transmission model to evaluate
the level of serological testing needed to reduce expected fatalities while increasing the fraction
of focal populations from social distancing.
Model overview
To evaluate the epidemiological consequences of using mass serological testing to inform the
relaxation of social distancing measures, we modeled transmission dynamics and serological
testing for SARS-CoV-2 using a deterministic, compartmental SEIR-like model. Recovered,
susceptible, latently infected, and asymptomatic test positive at rates that are functions of testing
frequency, sensitivity (for recovered individuals), and specificity (for non-immune individuals).
(Figure 1A) We model contacts at home, work, school, and other locations among three age
groups: children and young adults (<20 years), working adults (20-64 years), and elderly (65+
years). We used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to fit the model to time series
of deaths (20) and cross-sectional seroprevalence (12) data from three U.S. metropolitan areas
with distinct COVID-19 epidemic trajectories: the New York City Metro Region, South Florida,
and the Washington Puget Sound region.

Figure 1. Methods diagram overview A) Overall model diagram. Serological antibody testing is
shown by dashed arrows. Red dashed arrows indicate either false positives (i.e., someone is not
immune, but is moved to the test-positive group) and occur at a rate that is a function of 1specificity, or false negatives (i.e., someone is recovered, but stays in the test-negative group).
True positives occur at a rate that is a function of the sensitivity. *Symptomatic infections in the
test-positive group have similar severity to symptomatic infections in the not tested/test-negative
group, but symptoms are not recognized as being caused by SARS-CoV-2 unless they are severe
enough to warrant hospitalization. Note that the hospitalization compartments are located in the
‘Not tested/test-negative’ layer for simplicity, though individuals who incorrectly test positive
could move to these compartments after developing symptomatic infection. B) All three
municipalities enacted social distancing regulations in mid-March (21–23). Under these
measures, we assume all contacts at school and daycare were eliminated and contacts outside of
home, work, and school (‘other’) locations were substantially reduced (24) while contacts at
home remained unchanged, with distancing starting at the time that stay-at-home orders were
enacted in each site. (Figure 1A) We used the ‘reopening’ date, or date that stay-at-home orders
were lifted in each location, as the time at which social distancing was partially relaxed. In
accordance with school reopening plans in each location, we assume that schools and daycares
remained closed until September 1, 2020 in South Florida and October 1, 2020 in Washington
and New York, after which they reopen at 50% capacity. This 50% reduction is meant to capture
that interactions in schools in Fall 2020 are substantially reduced from pre-pandemic levels due
to the combination of online instruction as well as physical distancing and mask-wearing for
students attending in-person. We assumed a serological testing and shielding strategy starts on
November 1, 2020.
Results:
Model Fits to Fatalities and Serological Data
We explored the impacts of social distancing on epidemic outcomes in the absence of serological
testing. To do so, we first fit the model to reported deaths and to seroprevalence point estimates
from each of three metropolitan areas. Model fits for each location converged and closely
reproduced reported death trends through June 2020 and also matched seroprevalence estimates
early in the outbreak (see Figure 2 for fits; Figures S1-S10 for full model diagnostics). We note
that the probability of infection per contact and the fraction of symptomatic cases had narrow
credible intervals (CrI), indicating posterior confidence in the ability of the model to uniquely
identify parameter sets consistent with key features of infection and transmission. While mixing
parameters exhibit parameter identifiability concerns and additional data would be needed to
disentangle these parameters, the robustness of fits implies that the model outcomes early in the
epidemic are insensitive to variation in these parameters – enabling us to evaluate baseline
predictions with and without serological testing.
Epidemic dynamics in the absence of serological testing
In all three sites, our models predict a second epidemic peak in the fall and winter of 2020-2021.
(Figure 3) For New York, the second peak is predicted to be smaller than the first, whereas the
second wave is expected to be larger than the first wave in Washington and South Florida. If
social distancing is sustained at current levels without any further interventions, our model
predicts that 30-45% of the population across the three metropolitan areas (45% in New York
City, 95% credible interval (CrI): 18-66%; 30% in South Florida, 95% CrI: 25-33%; and 37% in
Washington, 95% CrI: 18-43%) will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by June 2021, resulting in

Epidemic dynamics with serological shielding
Next, we evaluated the benefit of serological shielding by considering the impacts of monthly
testing in each metropolitan area such that test-positive individuals increase their relative rate of
interactions, thereby shielding susceptible individuals and reducing the risk of transmission.
Specifically, individuals who test positive return to work and increase other contacts to normal
levels. We assume that test-negative/untested individuals continue to work from home if their job
allows them to do so (Figure 1B). To reflect the placement of test-positive individuals in highcontact roles, we assume that contacts at work and other (non-home, non-school) locations are
preferentially with test-positive persons. When shielding is 5:1 (moderate shielding) the
probability of interacting with a test-positive individual is 5 times what would be expected given
the frequency of test-positive individuals in the population, following the model of ‘fixed
shielding’ (described in (7)). In each site, serological testing leads to a flattened epidemic curve
in the fall and winter of 2020-2021. Widespread serological testing combined with moderate
serological shielding (5:1) starting on November 1, 2020, using a highly specific test, could
reduce cumulative deaths by June 2021 by 35% across the three sites combined. The strongest
reductions are in Washington (60%, 95% CrI: 50-61%), with a lower relative impact in New
York City (28%, 95% CrI: 0-30%) and South Florida (31%, 95% CrI: 26-33%). (Figure 4, top
row)
Impacts of serological testing frequency on epidemic outcomes and release from social
distancing
The magnitude of the benefit from serological shielding depends on the frequency of testing,
with more frequent testing resulting in both larger reductions in deaths and in a greater
proportion of the population being released from social distancing if a highly specific test is
used. (Figure 4, bottom row) In New York, monthly population testing is needed to maximize the
potential benefit, leading to 35% of the population being released from social distancing after
one year (95% CrI: 20%-68%) and deaths being reduced by 14,500 (95% CrI: 100-15,600). In
contrast, annual population testing would be expected to release 19% of the population from
social distancing (95% CrI: 8-35%) with 6,800 deaths averted (95% CrI: 0-6,700). More frequent
testing was also beneficial in Washington; monthly testing was expected to release 16% of the
population from social distancing before June 1 (95% CrI: 9-20%) with 10,000 deaths averted
(95% CrI: 4,00-13,000), compared with only 10% released (95% CrI: 4-14%) and 4,000 deaths
averted (95% CrI: 1,500-5,200) with annual testing. In South Florida, 22% (95% CrI: 19-25%) of
the population would be released from social distancing with monthly testing, compared with
11% (95% CrI: 9-13%) with yearly testing. Monthly testing was expected to avert 2,900 deaths
in South Florida (95% CrI: 2,100-3,300), whereas annual testing would avert 900 deaths (95%
CrI: 700-1,100).
While increasing the intensity of social distancing towards the level of restrictions observed in
April could help reduce deaths, these same benefits could be achieved by adding serological
testing as part of a control strategy, allowing social distancing to be safely relaxed. As social
distancing measures are relaxed further, testing frequency must increase to minimize deaths and

maximize the proportion of the population that can be released (Figure 5). The extent to which
testing frequency must increase to compensate for relaxing social distancing varies by location.
In New York City and South Florida, distancing can be relaxed fully if monthly testing is
employed.

Impacts of serological testing performance on epidemic outcomes and release from social
distancing
The value and safety of a serological testing strategy depends on the level of shielding and test
specificity. Thus far, our results centered on dynamics enabled by a high-performance test with a
specificity of 99.8%, consistent with the high end of the range of reported specificity of available
antibody tests, and a suboptimal test with 96% specificity, consistent with the low end of this
range (16). If monthly testing with a suboptimal assay (96% specificity) were implemented
without shielding, 58-72% of the population would be released from social distancing (72% in
New York City, 95% CrI: 46-92%; 58% in South Florida, 95% CrI: 54-61%; and 60% in
Washington, 95% CrI: 43-66%) but 85,000 deaths would be expected, more than if no testing
were implemented. Increasing the strength of shielding (5:1) while using a suboptimal assay
results in fewer deaths (55,000) with 25-48% of the population released from social distancing
(61% in New York, 95% CrI: 46-91%; 51% in South Florida, 95% CrI: 47-53%; 44% in
Washington, 95% CrI: 38-47%). Overall, adding shielding to a monthly testing strategy results in
30-55% fewer deaths compared to testing at the same frequency without shielding (30% in New
York, 95% CrI: 1-33%; 30% in South Florida, 95% CrI: 24-34%; 55% in Washington, 95% CrI:
39-56%). We also set test specificity to 50% to represent a scenario in which antibodies are not a
reliable correlate of immunity (i.e., the test is poor at distinguishing between immune and nonimmune individuals). If antibodies are not a reliable correlate of protection (which would be
counter to current evidence that shows neutralizing antibodies persist for months (25)) then
serological testing could lead to more deaths than if not used at all (Figure 4, top panel). We
conclude that even if a moderately specific test (96%) is used and antibodies provide a
reasonably good correlate of protection, increases in serological testing provide benefits in terms
of deaths averted when used with any level of social distancing. (Figure 5)

Discussion:
Strategies are needed to permit safely easing social distancing measures and returning to productive levels of
economic and social activity. Our results suggest that widespread serological testing can make a substantial
contribution to these efforts. As schools reopen this fall and social distancing measures relax, there is a window
of opportunity to reduce the intensity of the pandemic through the use of serological testing, without resorting to
further stay-at-home measures or ‘lockdowns.’ In order to explore the impact of this concept in metropolitan
areas, we find that maintaining moderate social distancing at the current level of intensity together with
widespread serological testing (monthly testing) could relieve 16-35% of local populations from social
distancing by June 2021. Moreover, if moderate shielding is employed, a strategy with serological testing
results in up to 21,000 fewer deaths than a strategy without testing across the three focal areas. Moderate social
distancing and shielding alongside monthly testing results in a flattened curve that provides time to improve
treatments and expand healthcare capacity and perhaps roll-out vaccination, which could further reduce
mortality rates (26). Thus, serological testing would allow a substantial fraction of the population to return to
work and other activities with relative safety, compared to a universal rollback of social distancing policies and
without the social and economic costs of a new wave of stay-at-home measures or ‘lockdowns.’
The eventual number of deaths remains uncertain, reflected in the wide, overlapping credible intervals for some
testing scenarios. However, sufficiently frequent testing using high-performance tests combined with
serological shielding consistently decreased deaths and was consistently able to allow relax social distancing for
a substantial fraction of the population. The largest source of uncertainty for estimating future deaths is the
extent to which individuals will continue to practice social distancing over the coming months. The width of our
credible intervals thus reflects the importance of ongoing social distancing to determining both the trajectory of
the U.S. epidemic and the potential impact of any other control interventions. Social distancing was broadly
adopted in the initial response (27), but there is a pressing need to continue collecting mobility and mixing data
as the epidemic unfolds to better predict risk.
An aggressive testing approach (monthly testing of the whole population) may appear unprecedented but, we
argue, is feasible and warranted considering the social and economic impact of the epidemic. Other countries
including Germany have implemented serological testing, including repeat testing of the same individuals on a
regular (i.e. monthly) basis (28). Implementation in the U.S. would require a significant and rapid scale-up of
serological testing capacity. Parallel gains have already been achieved for diagnostic PCR testing; the U.S.
expanded testing from fewer than 1,000 tests per day in early March to nearly 250,000 tests per day in mid-May
and about 1 million per day by September. Moreover, recently developed serological tests are quicker to
perform than RT-PCR, with a potential throughput of 300 tests/hour/machine, compared with 94 RT-PCR tests
performed every 3 hours (29,30). While to our knowledge South Florida and Washington have not reported
their current serological testing capacity, New York City reported performing a peak of 187,000 tests per week
in late March (31). The testing rate in March corresponds to a rate between the yearly testing and 10% per year
testing scenarios we include in our analysis and could likely be increased with a concerted focus on antibody
testing. To scale up testing capacity on a local level, municipalities would need to take advantage of existing
infrastructure (testing locations, healthcare personnel to staff locations, etc.). Highly sensitive and specific
bloodspot assays than can be self-administered (32) have also been developed (33), and could be used for this
purpose, easing some of the logistical issues with widespread testing.
Even if testing can be scaled up, legal and ethical concerns remain. Requiring evidence of a positive test to
return to work may create incentives for individuals to misrepresent their immune status or intentionally get
infected. A large-scale testing program must consider how such policies might reinforce social disparities and
guard against inequities in test availability (34). However, the use of serological testing to reduce new

transmission can also be supported on ethical grounds, insofar as serological tests are sufficiently accurate (35).
Indeed, current policy approaches to utilize Covid-19 positive, asymptomatic health-care workers to treat
hospitalized patients suggests that principled, test-driven policies are needed. Relatedly, a history of a positive
antibody test should not change the clinical care of individuals with respiratory symptoms suggestive of SARSCoV-2 infection if a PCR diagnostic test would otherwise be indicated.
While others have raised concerns that using serological tests to relax social distancing could increase
population risk (36), we show that coupling serological testing with available diagnostic tests with immune
shielding can form the basis of a successful strategy. If testing employs the most specific assays available, the
false positive proportion would remain low and decrease over time as seroprevalence increases. As such,
deploying immune individuals such that they are responsible for more interactions than susceptible individuals
will reduce risk. If shielding is not employed, this benefit disappears, and testing can become a liability –
reinforcing the critical need to combine serological testing with a shielding strategy. In our model, cumulative
deaths are not substantially impacted by the false positive rate: deaths are similar under scenarios assuming a
sub-optimally specific test (96% specificity) and a high-performance test (99.8% specificity) except at very high
testing rates. Thus, false positives are unlikely to substantively impact population-level risk at levels of
specificity reported by most authorized serological tests (16,37).
Our models assumed random allocation of serological testing. In practice, targeting testing to specific groups,
such as healthcare workers, nursing home care providers, food service employees, or contacts of confirmed or
suspected cases might increase efficiency by increasing the test-positive rate (and consequently, costeffectiveness (38)), allowing for similar numbers of individuals to be released from social distancing at lower
testing levels. This strategy would also decrease the false positive rate, an important consideration if a less
specific test is used (39). Many healthcare organizations have already begun to offer antibody testing to their
employees (40). The use of serological testing and shielding within healthcare settings represents a potential
application of a more targeted strategy and may also help to allow ethical concerns on misrepresentation of
antibody status and/or intentionally seeking infections.
There remains much to learn about immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and we have made three critical simplifying
assumptions in our model. First, we assume that antibodies are immediately detectable after resolution of
infection. In reality, this generally occurs between 11 and 14 days post infection (41). A small fraction of recent
infections would be undetected, but this would have a minor effect on our results. Second, we assume that
immunity lasts for at least a year. Given that the virus has only been circulating for about nine months in
humans, both the duration of antibody protection and the extent to which those antibodies protect against future
infections remains unclear. However, the great majority individuals who are infected seroconvert (14), and
ongoing studies of SARS-CoV-2 show that antibodies persist for at least months (41). Evidence is emerging
that antibodies can wane in a matter of months though waning antibodies does not necessarily imply the loss of
immune protection (42). Third, we assume that antibodies detected by serology are a correlate of protection.
While antibody levels have been shown to wane after several months, especially for individuals with mild
infection (25,42), antibody kinetics of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS suggest that protection will last for at least
months and as long as several years (43). Reinfections, while documented, have been extremely rare.
While we have focused our analysis on serological testing, using the principles of serological shielding to
reduce risks of infection for susceptible individuals also applies to other public health interventions (44). As of
October 2020, many phase III trials of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are underway and efficacy readouts are
expected at the end of 2020 or early 2021. If and when an effective vaccine becomes available, vaccinated
individuals could also be preferentially placed in high contact positions to serve as immune ‘shields.’ This could
both allow vaccinated individuals to resume more normal levels of social and economic activity and also allow
herd immunity to be reached more quickly. However, even after a vaccine becomes licensed, scaling up access
to vaccination will likely take several months, with individuals at highest risk likely receiving vaccines first
(45). In the interim, using serological testing as an additional strategy to reduce transmission could be helpful to
reduce the public health and socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic.

A serological testing strategy is one component of the public health response to COVID-19, alongside viral
testing, isolation and rigorous contact tracing. If implemented simultaneously, such measures would likely
reduce the extent of shielding required to achieve the same benefit, in addition to further reducing overall
transmission. In summary, our results suggest a role for large-scale serological testing programs in the public
health response to COVID-19. While maintaining a degree of social distancing, serology can be used to allow
people with positive test results to return to work and other activities while mitigating the health impacts of
COVID-19.
Materials and Methods:
Model
We modeled the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using a deterministic, compartmental SEIR-like
model. (Figure 1) We assume that after a latent period, infected individuals progress to either asymptomatic or
symptomatic infection. A fraction of symptomatic cases are hospitalized, with a subset of those requiring
critical care. Surviving cases, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, recover and are assumed to be immune to
reinfection. All individuals who have not tested positive and are not currently experiencing symptoms of
respiratory illness are eligible to be tested and all hospitalized cases are tested prior to discharge. Recovered
individuals are moved to the test-positive group at a rate that is a function of test sensitivity. Susceptible,
latently infected, and asymptomatic cases may falsely test positive and are moved to the test-positive group at a
rate that is a function of test specificity. False positives may become infected, but the inaccuracy of their test
result is not recognized unless they develop symptoms that are sufficiently severe to warrant hospitalization and
health providers correctly diagnose COVID-19, overriding the history of a positive antibody test. The ordinary
differential equations corresponding to this model are included in section S1 of the SI. All models were run in R
version 3.6.2 using the package ‘deSolve’. Code is available at
https://github.com/lopmanlab/Serological_Shielding.
There are three age groups represented in the model: children and young adults (<20 years), working adults (2064 years), and elderly (65+ years). We modeled age-specific mixing based on POLYMOD data adapted to the
population structure in the United States (46,47). Contacts in this survey were reported based on whether they
occurred at home, school, work, or another location. All baseline social contact matrices were based on Prem et
al. (47) and calculated to be symmetric using the socialmixr R package.
‘General’ social distancing began on the day that stay-at-home orders were enacted in each location. Although
adherence to these measures varied and is generally difficult to measure, we made several assumptions about
how these policies changed location-specific contacts. First, we assume that under these measures, all contacts
at school and daycare were eliminated and that contacts outside of home, work, and school (‘other’) locations
were reduced by a fraction, which was fitted for each metropolitan location. We assume that contacts at home
remained unchanged. To address differences in work-based contacts by occupation types, we classified the
working adult population into three subgroups based on occupation: (i) those with occupations that enable them
to work exclusively from home during social distancing, (ii) those continuing to work but reduced their contacts
at work (e.g., customer-facing occupations such as retail), and (iii) those continuing to work with no change in
their contact patterns (e.g., frontline healthcare workers). The percent reduction in ‘other’ contacts and percent
contact reductions at work for essential workers who could reduce their contacts was fitted (see next section).
This period of intense social distancing lasts until stay-at-home orders are lifted (referred to as ‘reopening’) in
each location. After this date, we assume that schools and daycares remain closed but that social distancing
measures for the general population can be relaxed, by allowing work and other contacts to be increased. To
represent this, we scale contacts at work and ‘other’ locations to a proportion of their value under general social
distancing based on a scalar constant, c, such that c = 1 is equivalent to the scenario in which social distancing
measures as put into place in March are maintained and c = 0 is equivalent to a return to pre-pandemic contact

levels for both ‘work’ and ‘other’ contacts for essential workers and pre-pandemic contact levels for ‘other’
contacts for all other groups. Based on local policies, we assume that children returned to school and daycare on
September 1, 2020 in South Florida and October 1, 2020 in Washington and New York City. To account for the
fact that schools have taken a variety of measures to reduce contact among students, we assumed that children
are halving (50%) their pre-pandemic contacts at school.
Fitting data
We fit the model for each location to deaths reported due to COVID-19 from March to July 2020 (20) as well as
seroprevalence data (12) using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach using the MCMCstat toolbox
(https://mjlaine.github.io/mcmcstat/). Each location was defined using the same counties as were included in a
CDC-led seroprevalence study (12). For each location, we estimated the six parameters listed in Table S1. We
ran ten, randomly seeded chains of 100,000 iterations each (95,000 burn-in; 5,000 samples). To infer the initial
conditions, we first calculated the number of weeks between the first reported death in each location and the
first week where the cumulative death toll exceeded 10. Using region-specific conditions (population
demographics, stay-at-home order enactment and lifting dates, and death data), we initialize an epidemic
consisting of a single exposed adult, forward simulated until a death count threshold was met, and then the
population distribution was used as the initial condition for subsequent intervention scenarios.
We used a Poisson likelihood function that included penalty terms for R0 (expected R0 = 3.0), the cumulative
midpoint and final number of deaths in each location, as well as population-level seroprevalence estimated for
each location from Havers et al. (12) We checked for chain convergence using the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic
(Figure S1). Figures S2, S5, and S8 show the trace plots for each model, and Figures S3, S6, and S9 show the
resulting joint distributions of estimated parameters. The consistency between the fitted model and
death/seroprevalence data for each location is shown in Figures S4, S7, and S10. After fitting to death data
spanning March to July 2020, we use fitted parameters to forward-simulate the epidemic through June 1 in each
location.
To capture uncertainty in model predictions, we randomly sampled 20 parameter sets in the final 5,000
iterations in each chain for each location. For Washington, one of the chains did not converge, so we used
sampled parameter sets from the other 9 chains. For South Florida and New York, all 10 chains converged to
the same final state, so we randomly sampled parameter sets from all 10 chains. This resulted in 200 randomly
sampled parameter sets for New York and South Florida and 180 for Washington. We simulated the epidemic
forward using each parameter set for the key testing and shielding interventions we report in the text. We report
the middle 95% of the distribution of outcomes from these runs as our credible intervals. We have uploaded a
supplementary .csv file with the number of deaths, critical care cases, cumulative incidence, and the fraction of
the population released from social distancing after one year from each of these simulations as supplemental
material.
