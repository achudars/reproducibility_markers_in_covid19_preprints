Abstract
Within Europe, death rates due to covid-19 vary greatly, with some countries being hardly hit
while others to date are almost unaffected. It would be of interest to pinpoint the factors that
determine a countryâ€™s susceptibility to a pandemic such as covid-19.

Here we present data demonstrating that mortality due to covid-19 in a given country could

mortality caused by covid-19 in 2020 (R =0.48, p<0.0001). In contrast, we found no correlation
between such excess mortality and age, population density, degree of urbanization, latitude,
GNP, governmental health spendings or rates of influenza vaccinations.

These data may be of some relevance when discussing the effectiveness of acute measures in
order to limit the spread of the disease and ultimately deaths. They suggest that in some
European countries there is an intrinsic susceptibility to fatal respiratory viral disease including
covid-19; a susceptibility that was evident long before the arrival of the current pandemic.

Introduction
Seasonal fluctuations in all-cause mortality are well known with deaths typically peaking in the

winter.

A main factor driving excess winter mortality is seasonal flu.

When examining mortality

across Europe we noted that some countries repeatedly exhibit excess deaths during the winter

flu season while others show only minimal variations.

In 2020 the peak in excess mortality was

pandemic.

Again,

however, the higher death rates were unevenly spread throughout Europe. Here we decided to

relate historical death rates 2015-2019 with the mortality rates seen in Europe during 2020

using a publically available database.

We find a remarkable correlation between these two

paramaters.

Results and Discussion

first months of 2020. The overall excess in all cause mortality in these countries correlated well

fluctuating mortality exhibited higher excess mortality also in 2020 (R2 = 0.48, p <0.0001), while

when

longitudinal mortality rates (Z-scores) for some countries are exhibited (Fig. 1c). Thus, some

countries including Spain, Belgium and Italy that were severely hit by the current pandemic also

displayed high excess mortalty during the preceeding winter influenza seasons. Conversely,

countries like Norway, Luxembourg and Estonia display hardly visible fluctuations in mortality

rates over the entire study period including 2020.

This suggests that it was in fact possible to predict high death rates caused by covid-19 even

before the pandemic hit Europe simply by looking at excess mortality in a country during the

preceding normal influenza seasons. Why then are some countries apparently unaffected year

, and cultural differences along with the organization of health care and elderly nursing

homes. However, we found no correlation between population age and excess mortality in 2020

and neither was there any correlation with population density, latitude, GNP, governmental

health spending, degree of urbanization, or rates

of influenza vaccination (Table 1 and

2).

General organization and quality of health care and in particular elderly nursing homes, where a

large portion of the 2020 covid-19 related deaths originated, are more complex factors that

cannot be evaluated using these data alone. It will be interesting also to study if regional cultural

differences across Europe might explain the pattern observed here. Again, such analysis will

require more sophisticated analytical tools and datasets. In the case of the ongoing covid-19

pandemic, the degree of social interactions are influenced by governmental policies ranging

from milder regulations to lockdowns. The effectiveness of these measures in preventing the

spread of infection and ultimately death is currently a matter of great debate. It seems clear to

date that many countries that applied very strict measures, still have experienced very high

infection rates and death tolls during the current pandemic. Although the present data cannot

be used to evaluate the success of governmental measures, it is noteworthy that whatever

factors that drove excess mortality rates in 2020 were present already in 2015-2019, ie during a

period when no measures were undertaken in any country. Thus, our data suggest that there is

an intrinsic susceptibility in certain countries to excess mortality associated with respiratory viral

in preparing health care systems and directing timely help to a certain region when a pandemic

hits a continent.

Excess mortality in Europe 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic.

(a) Map of Europe

showing countries with varying degree of excess mortality during the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020,

(b) variability in death rates 2015-2019 for 25 European countries plotted against the degree of

excess deaths during the covid-19 outbreak and (c) longitudinal mortality patterns (Z-scores) for

10 representative countries demonstrating low (left) or high (right) death rates during 2020.

Note that countries with high death rates 2020 also exhibit considerable peaks in mortality

during the preceeding influenza seasons.

Dotted lines represent a Z-score of 2 which here is

defined as the threshold for excess mortality. Countries in gray in the map are not included in

the database used. For Germany two regions (Hesse, Berlin) are included in the database and

calculations. Colours in the map represent different degrees of excess mortality (sum of Z-scores

>2) with red being highest, yellow intermediate and green low.
