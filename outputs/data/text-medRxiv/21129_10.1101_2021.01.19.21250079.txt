SUMMARY
Viral pandemics, such as Covid-19, pose serious threats to human societies. To control the spread of
highly contagious viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, effective test-trace-isolate strategies require
population-wide, systematic testing. Currently, RT-qPCR on extracted RNA is the only broadly
accepted test for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, which bears the risk of supply chain bottlenecks, often
exaggerated by dependencies on proprietary reagents. Here, we directly compare the performance
of gold standard diagnostic RT-qPCR on extracted RNA to direct input RT-PCR, RT-LAMP and
bead-LAMP on 384 primary patient samples collected from individuals with suspected Covid-19
infection. With a simple five minute crude sample inactivation step and one hour of total reaction
time, we achieve assay sensitivities of 98% (direct RT-PCR), 93% (bead-LAMP) and 82% (RTLAMP) for clinically relevant samples (diagnostic RT-qPCR Ct <35) and a specificity of >98%. For
direct RT-PCR, our data further demonstrate a perfect agreement between real-time and end-point
measurements, which allow a simple binary classification similar to the powerful visual readout of
colorimetric LAMP assays. Our study provides highly sensitive and specific, easy to implement,
rapid and cost-effective alternatives to diagnostic RT-qPCR tests.
Keywords: Covid-19 diagnostics, RT-LAMP, RT-PCR, Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2

RESULTS & DISCUSSION
We obtained 384 primary patient samples to
benchmark, in parallel, three laboratory-developed
SARS-CoV-2 tests [1] against a diagnostic RTqPCR assay, which uses extracted RNA as input
[2] (Figure 1A). 271 samples were nasooropharyngeal swabs in viral transport medium
(VTM) or 0.9% NaCl solution (saline), and 113
were gargle samples in saline or Hank's Balanced
Salt Solution (HBSS). For all samples, we
quantitatively determined SARS-CoV-2 levels via
the gold-standard RT-qPCR (E-gene) on extracted
RNA in the diagnostic laboratory of the Austrian
Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES), the
Austrian national public health agency. This
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 virus in 161/384 samples
(102 swabs and 59 gargle specimens) with viral
titres ranging between 0.2 and 100 million copies
per microliter primary sample (Supplementary
Figure S1A). Each of the three rapid assays
described below direct RT-PCR, RT-LAMP, beadLAMP bypasses the time-consuming and costly
RNA extraction step. Instead, we used a fiveminute inactivation procedure of the primary
sample in QuickExtract (Lucigen) buffer, which
effectively lyses virions and permanently
inactivates RNases, thereby generating a noninfectious sample with stable viral RNA [3]. This
method is compatible with naso-oropharyngeal
swabs, sputum, saliva and gargle [1,4].

Direct RT-PCR
The direct RT-qPCR method is analogous to
diagnostic RT-qPCR assays but circumvents the
dedicated RNA extraction step and uses
inexpensive, readily available reagents [3,5]. We
performed direct RT-qPCR using Luna One-Step
RT-qPCR reagents (New England Biolabs) and the
CDC N1 SARS-CoV-2 reference primer/probe set
(IDT) [1]. The obtained Ct-values correlated
strongly with the diagnostic RT-qPCR values
(Spearman correlation Rho = 0.93), demonstrating
that omitting the RNA extraction step does not
distort quantitative measurements and that RTPCR-inhibiting substances are not prevalent in
naso-oropharyngeal swab and gargle samples
(Figure 1B). On average, Ct values of the direct
RT-PCR assay were ~2 cycles higher compared to
the diagnostic Ct-values. This indicated minor
losses in sensitivity (Figure 1B), which we
attribute to the lower input amount per reaction in
direct RT-PCR (no RNA extraction and enrichment
compared to the diagnostic RT-qPCR). With the
exception of two outliers (Ct 28 and Ct 29), all
samples with a diagnostic RT-qPCR Ct value
below or equal to 35 (more than ~30 viral copies
per reaction; n = 104 samples) as well as 35 out of
55 samples with clinical Ct values above 35
(63.3%) were positive by direct RT-qPCR (Figure
1B, H). Thus, specimens yielding false negative
results by the direct RT-qPCR method had very
low viral copy numbers (Figure 1B, H). Among the

diagnostic RT-qPCR
A. Schematic illustrating the workflow for the head-to-head comparison of three rapid, laboratorydeveloped tests (direct RT-PCR, RT-LAMP, bead-LAMP) against diagnostic RT-qPCR for rapid SARSCoV-2 diagnostics. A five-minute heat-inactivation step in QuickExtract buffer circumvents the RNA
extraction of the gold-standard diagnostic RT-qPCR protocol.
B. Comparison of real-time direct RT-qPCR to diagnostic RT-qPCR. Each dot represents the Ct (cycle
threshold) value of an individual sample measured by the two techniques. The color indicates the
sample type (naso/oropharyngeal swab or gargle). The dashed line indicates a 100% theoretical
agreement. Spearman’s correlation coefficient (Rho) was calculated for the correlation analysis
between diagnostic RT-qPCR and direct RT-qPCR.
C. Comparison of real-time direct RT-qPCR and end-point direct RT-PCR. Each dot represents the Ct
value of an individual sample and its corresponding end-point relative fluorescence units (RFU)
measured from the same reaction. Sample type is indicated by the color of the data-point (naso/
oropharyngeal swab or gargle).
D. Data shown in C) split up into groups by diagnostic RT-qPCR Ct values. Mann-Whitney test was
used to compare end-point RFUs within individual groups to the values measured for RT-qPCR
negative samples (**** < 0.0001 significance).
E. Heatmap showing measured direct RT-qPCR Ct values for a 96-well sample plate (top) and the
corresponding end-point fluorescence smartphone image taken on a standard LED blue-light
transilluminator (bottom).
F. Comparison of RT-LAMP to diagnostic RT-qPCR. Each dot represents the Ct value of an individual
sample and its corresponding end-point RFU values measured by RT-LAMP reactions containing HNB
and the fluorescent SYTO-9 dye. The color of each data point indicates the final reaction color
obtained by RT-LAMP. Representative examples of final reaction colors (raw images) and the
corresponding color-rotated images (colorimetry.net), which facilitate scoring of the color changes, are
shown underneath.
G. Same as shown in F) but for Kingfisher bead-LAMP using 60 µl of lysate as input.
H. Determined assay sensitivity and specificity of direct RT-PCR (black), RT-LAMP (blue) and beadLAMP (yellow) in comparison to diagnostic RT-qPCR performed on the same 384 samples. The binned
(left) and cumulative (middle) sensitivity graphs show the mean detection rate with error bars
representing the 95% confidence interval (Wilson/Brown binomial confidence interval). The assay
specificity graph (right) shows the percentages of negative agreement between each of the alternative
tests with the diagnostic RT-qPCR.
I. Overview of different SARS-CoV-2 detection assays and their respective limits of detection. The
SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration for each clinical naso/oro-pharyngeal swab sample was calculated
from diagnostic RT-qPCR Ct values and plotted (log10). Dotted lines indicate the limit of detection
(95% confidence interval) for various assays measured in this study (RT-LAMP, bead-LAMP, direct
RT-PCR) or elsewhere (Abbott Panbio Antigen-test and Coris Bioconcept Covid-19 Antigen RespiStrip [13], clinical RT-qPCR [2]). A viral titre at or above the indicated “infectious” line (red) has
previously been determined in a virological assessment study of hospital patients [11].

samples yielding false negative results, gargle and
swab specimens showed no statistically significant
difference in sample Ct (P = 0.89, Mann-Whitney
test) or Ct value distribution (Pgargle = 0.27, Pswab =
0.17, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) (Supplementary
Figure S1B). Direct RT-qPCR detected SARSCoV-2 in four specimens defined as ‘negative’ by
the diagnostic RT-qPCR assay (Figure 1B). The
estimated viral loads of these samples were at the
limit of detection by diagnostic RT-qPCR (Ct
above 38, less than ~5 copies per reaction). Given
the otherwise high specificity of the direct RTPCR method (98.2% negative predictive agreement
for 223 samples; Figure 1H), we suspect minor
cross-contamination from positive samples as the
likely cause (e.g. three out of the four samples

were adjacent to SARS-CoV-2 positive sample
wells).
When using real-time qPCR instruments, the
direct RT-qPCR assay is quantitative in nature
(Figure 1B). For a simple virus-positive or
negative classification, however, an end-point
measurement using a standard laboratory PCR
machine and a simple illumination device would be
sufficient. To test this, we performed end-point
fluorescence measurements of RT-qPCR reactions
that were also monitored in real-time. This
revealed a clear quantitative difference in relative
fluorescence units (RFU) between RT-qPCRpositive and -negative samples (P < 0.0001, MannWhitney test) (Figure 1C, D). Primary samples
with diagnostic Ct values below or equal to 35

(more than ~30 viral copies per reaction) displayed
the strongest signal intensity (RFUmax = 5590), and
even weakly positive samples with Ct values above
37 (less than ~5 copies per reaction) displayed
RFU values greater than the maximum measured
for any of the 240 negative samples (Figure 1C,
D). Endpoint RT-PCR therefore allows a robust,
automated yes/no classification based on comeasured positive and negative control reactions.
The strong fluorescent signal is visible in PCR
plates or strips when using a standard blue-light
transilluminator or a simple blue light LED lamp
(Figure 1E, Supplementary Figure S1C), and
images can be captured with a standard smartphone
camera. We observed 100% concordance between
machine-read (RT-qPCR cycler or plate reader) and
visible fluorescence (Figure 1E, Supplementary
Figure S1C). For an automated, rapid classification
of the assay, fluorescent images can be converted
into signal intensities using the FIJI6 plugin
ReadPlate (Supplementary Figure S1D).
RT-LAMP
Isothermal, loop-mediated amplification after
reverse-transcription (RT-LAMP) is a powerful
nucleic acid amplification method [7] that requires
minimal equipment (in its simplest form, a water
bath at 62 - 65°C [1]; Figure 1A, Supplementary
Figure S2A, B). RT-LAMP based DNA
amplification is rapid (< 30 minutes) and, due to
the large amount of generated DNA products,
allows the use of a colorimetric and/or
fluorescence readout [8]. Instead of the pHdependent dye Phenol Red commonly used in RTLAMP assays, we chose the metal-indicator HNB
[9] as it is compatible with the QuickExtract buffer
and all commonly used specimen types (like
swabs, gargle samples, saliva, sputum) and media
(VTM, saline, HBSS) [1,4]. To simultaneously
detect fluorescence, we used the SYTO-9 dye
(detailed LAMP protocol available at https://
www.rtlamp.org/). From the 384 patient samples,
RT-LAMP targeting the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab
gene [10] detected 94 out of the 161 RT-qPCR
positive samples (58%) while maintaining a 100%
negative predictive agreement rate with no false
positive results among the 223 specimens that were
determine ‘negative’ by diagnostic RT-qPCR
(Figure 1F, H). Concordance between colorimetric
results (sky-blue = positive, purple = negative) and
fluorescence intensity (LAMP end-point RFU) was
100%, demonstrating the reliability in detecting
positive specimens based on colorimetric signal
alone (Figure 1F, Supplementary Figure S3). The
assay sensitivity for samples with a diagnostic RTqPCR Ct value below or equal to 30 was 96.1%
(74/77), 44.8% for Ct values between 30 to 35
(13/29), and 12.7% for weakly positive samples
with Ct values above or equal to 35 (7/55) (Figure

1F, H). The mean time-to-threshold (time until
fluorescent signal reached a threshold value) was
~15 minutes (range from 9.9 to 23.3 minutes)
(Supplementary Figure S2C). Reactions displaying
an intermediate colour had time to threshold values
o f m o r e t h a n 2 0 m i n u t e s ( F i g u r e 1 F,
Supplementary Figure S2C), indicating that for
lower viral loads (RT-qPCR Ct values above 33)
fluorescence is the more robust readout. Thus, RTLAMP is a very fast, simple and versatile assay
that has a sensitivity sufficient to identify SARSCoV-2 in samples from infectious individuals [11]
(Figure 1I).
Bead-LAMP
To increase the sensitivity of RT-LAMP, we
developed bead-enriched RT-LAMP (in short,
bead-LAMP), which uses a 15-minute, magnetic
bead based enrichment step to capture RNA from
up to 100 µl inactivated patient samples (Figure
1A, Supplementary Figure S2B) [1]. RNA elution
in bead-LAMP is done directly with the RT-LAMP
reaction mix, increasing speed and allowing for
maximum RNA enrichment. As bead-enrichment
removes sample buffer and matrix components, it
is compatible with Phenol Red-based colorimetric
detection (pink = negative; yellow = positive)
(Figure 1G, Supplementary Figure S2B,
Supplementary Figure S3; for detailed bead-LAMP
protocols visit https://www.rtlamp.org/). BeadLAMP can be performed manually as well as on
the commonly used, fully automated Kingfisher
Flex purification system, which reduces the
amount of valuable reaction consumables such as
pipette tips. Bead-LAMP detected 115 out of 161
RT-qPCR positive samples (71.4%) (Figure 1G).
As expected, bead-LAMP improved assay
sensitivity, detecting 83% (30/36) of samples with
diagnostic Ct values between 30 and 35, 31% for
Ct values above 35 (17/55) and even 19.5% (8/41)
of samples with Ct values above 37 (Figure 1G,
H). In comparison, direct RT-LAMP detected only
1 out of 41 samples in the Ct range above 37
(Figure 1F, H). Out of 223 specimens that yielded
negative results by RT-qPCR, three specimens
(1.3%) showed positive results when tested by
bead-LAMP (Figure 1G). None of these three
samples were positive in direct RT-qPCR or RTLAMP, suggesting that they were in fact incorrect
positive results of the bead-LAMP assay. We
suspect that minor cross-contaminations during
sample handling are the underlying cause of the
false positive results. Compared to the manual
bead-LAMP protocol, the automated KingFisher
system improved the overall performance of beadLAMP despite using lower sample input volume
per sample (60 µl versus 100 µl). We measured a
subset of samples (n = 288) in parallel using
manual and automated bead-LAMP and observed

higher detection rates in the fully automated
KingFisher version (Supplementary Figure S2D,
S3). As for RT-LAMP, no difference in sensitivity
was observed for bead-LAMP between gargle and
swab samples (Supplementary Figure S2E),
demonstrating compatibility with diverse input
samples. Taken together, bead-LAMP is an
attractive solution for applications where increased
assay sensitivity is required, such as for pooled
testing [1].

massively scale up testing in cases of low viral
prevalence in the population [17]. In this, our rapid
and cost-effective methods could enable any
country to establish population-wide testing
strategies, which would be highly effective in
limiting the spread of contagious viruses such as
SARS-CoV-2 [18,19].

Our comparative study highlights three
laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 tests that are
cheap (reagent costs ~1 USD for RT-qPCR and RTLAMP, ~1.2 USD for bead-LAMP), rapid (45 - 80
min total test time), simple, and that circumvent
supply chain bottlenecks. The three assays hold the
potential to greatly expand the availability of
affordable testing strategies anywhere in the world.
Our data demonstrate that direct RT-PCR, RTLAMP and bead-LAMP are fully compatible with
crude sample lysates without measurable reaction
inhibition. In line with previous studies [5,10,12],
this strongly supports the validity of extraction-free
nucleic acid diagnostics. All three assays are
inherently scalable and have a sensitivity that
exceeds the required threshold to detect infectious
individuals, which only the best commercial rapid
Antigen point-of-care tests achieve [13] (Figure
1I). All three assays are compatible with various
input types such as swabs or gargle, the latter
offering a simple, non-invasive way of selfcollecting the specimen without the need of
trained, specialized personell. Finally, all three of
the rapid assays highlighted here take advantage of
the dUTP/UDG system [14-16], which we used
throughout this study in order to minimize
technical false-positive results due to carry-over
contamination with prior PCR or LAMP
amplicons.

Depending on the available equipment and
desired assay sensitivity, our nucleic acid
amplification assays provide an effective
alternative to diagnostic RT-qPCR testing, where
dependencies on commercial testing platforms and
reagent supply shortages could lead to unused
testing capacities. Laboratories already performing
RT-qPCR or regular PCRs could implement direct
RT-qPCR or end-point RT-PCR, while our endpoint RT-PCR and colorimetric RT-LAMP
protocols provide powerful, simple testing methods
to greatly increase the testing capacity particularly
in settings where qPCR detection instruments are
unavailable. For settings in which speed and
simplicity matters, colorimetric RT-LAMP is the
most powerful method. Furthermore, the sensitivity
of RT-PCR for pooled tests, and the speed of RTLAMP for de-pooling could be combined to

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical sample collection
Patient samples (oro/nasopharyngeal swabs and
gargle) were obtained as part of a clinical
performance study approved by the local Ethics
Committee of the City of Vienna (#EK
20-292-1120). Oro/Nasopharyngeal swabs were
collected in 3 ml Viral Transport Medium (VTM)
or 0.9% NaCl solution (saline). Gargle samples
were collected from patients by letting individuals
gargle for 1 minute with 5 ml of Hank’s Balanced
Salt Solution (HBSS) or 0.9% saline solution.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients.
RNA extraction and clinical RT-qPCR
RNA was extracted from 200 µl of NP and OP
swab supernatants using a commercial kit
(BioExtract® SuperBall®, BioSellal, France) and
the KingFisher™ Flex Purification System
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Negative
extraction controls (nuclease-free water) were
prepared alongside clinical samples to monitor for
potential cross-contamination. Detection of SARSCoV-2 RNA was performed using a commercial
primer/probe mix (LightMix® Modular SARS and

Wuhan CoV E-gene; TIB Molbiol, Germany) and
SuperScript™ III Platinum® One-Step
Quantitative RT-PCR System with ROX (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, USA) on the ABI7500Fast
system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Assays
were performed as in duplicate as real-time RTPCR reactions, also targeting β-actin mRNA as
extraction control [20]. Nuclease-free water and a
synthetic RNA control provided with the primer/
probe mix were included as respective notemplate-control (NTC) and positive control (PC).
A CT-value of >40 was considered a negative
result.
Crude sample inactivation using QuickExtract
DNA solution
120 µl of naso/oro-pharyngeal swab or gargle
sample was mixed 1:1 with QuickExtract™ DNA
Extraction Solution (Lucigen) and heat inactivated
for 5 minutes at 95°C. Samples were then stored on
ice until further use or frozen at -80°C.
Direct RT-PCR
For detecting the viral N-gene via RT-qPCR, 1-step
RT-qPCR was performed using the Luna Universal
One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (NEB), 1.5 µl of reference
primer/probe sets CDC-N1 (IDT 10006713), 0.4 µl
of Antarctic Thermolabile UDG (NEB), and 2 µl of
QuickExtract inactivated crude sample lysate per
20 µl reaction. Reactions were run at 55°C for 10
minutes, 95°C for 1 minute, followed by 45 cycles
of 95°C for 10 seconds and 55°C for 30 seconds in
a BioRad CFX qPCR cycler. End-point
measurements were taken on the BioRad CFX
qPCR cycler after 45 cycles of amplification and
plotted without baseline subtraction. Alternatively,
PCR plates were placed on a LED Blue-light
Transilluminator (Safe Imager 2.0, Thermofisher)
and photographed using a regular smartphone
camera (iPhone XS). The Fiji plugin ReadPlate
was used to convert the smartphone image into
numerical values according to the plugin’s manual
instructions.
RT-LAMP
For detailed, up-to-date protocols on the RT-LAMP
assay visit https://www.rtlamp.org/get-started/rtlamp-commercial/. In brief, RT-LAMP reactions
were set up by mixing 10 µl of the 2X NEB
WarmStart® RT-LAMP Master Mix (1x final, 2x
stock) with 2 µl of 10x ORF1a-HMS primer
solution [10] (1x final equals 1.6 µM of FIP, 1.6
µM of BIP, 0.4 µM of LB, 0.4 µM of LF, 0.2 µM
of F3, 0.3 µM of B3), 0.4 µl of 100 µM SYTO-9
dye (Thermofisher, made from 5 mM Stock in
DMSO), 0.4 µl of NEB Antarctic thermolabile
UDG, 0.14 µl of 100 mM dUTP solution (NEB,
0.7 mM final dUTP added), 0.14 µl of 100 mM
MgSO4 (NEB, 0.7 mM added), 0.8 µl of 3 mM

hydroxynapthol blue (120 µM final, stock solution
made from HNB powder (Hach) in nuclease-free
water and filtered through 0.22 µm filter), 2 µl of
QuickExtract inactivated crude sample lysate and
nuclease-free water to a final volume of 20 µl.
Reactions were run at 63°C for 35 cycles (1 minute
cycle length) in a BioRad CFX Connect qPCR
cycler with SYBR readings after every cycle.
Colorimetric signal was read out after reaction
completion using a simple smartphone camera.
Reactions with sky blue color were scored as
positive, purple color as negative and everything
between as intermediate. A separate classification
was done to compare results using a color
conversion tool (colorimetry.net) which rotates the
color space by 180° to invert reaction colors into
orange (positive) or yellow (negative).
Bead-LAMP
For detailed, up-to-date protocols on the beadLAMP assay visit https://www.rtlamp.org/getstarted/bead-lamp-commercial/. In brief, for bead
enrichment, 60 µl or 100 µl of QuickExtract
inactivated crude lysate was mixed with 0.6x of
magnetic beads (1:5 dilution of Agencourt
RNAClean XP in 2.5 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8.0, 20% (w/v) PEG 8000, 0.05% Tween 20, 5
mM NaN3) and either manually or automatically
processed. For manual bead-LAMP, bead-sample
mixtures were incubated for 5 minutes at room
temperature followed by bead capture on a
magnetic rack (Alpaqua 96S Super Magnet) for 5
minutes. The liquid was removed and beads were
washed twice with 85% ethanol for 30 seconds.
The beads were air dried for 5 minutes and then
eluted directly in 20 µl colorimetric LAMP
reaction mix containing 10 µl of 2x NEB
WarmStart® Colorimetric LAMP Master Mix with
UDG (1x final), 2 µl of 10x ORF1a-HMS [10] and
2 µl of NEB E1 primer solution [21] (1x final
equals 1.6 µM of FIP, 1.6 µM of BIP, 0.4 µM of
LB, 0.4 µM of LF, 0.2 µM of F3, 0.3 µM of B3),
0.4 µl of 2M GuHCl (40 mM final, 2M Stock made
from pH 8.5 buffered solution in water (Sigma
G7294)), 0.4 µl of 100 µM SYTO-9 dye
(ThermoFisher, made from 5 mM Stock in DMSO)
and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 20 µl.
For automated bead-LAMP, we established a
custom protocol for the KingFisher™ Flex
Purification System: The protocol was designed for
a 96-well PCR magnetic head and maximum 100
µl of total sample volume. After mixing 60 µl of
crude lysate with 40 µl of magnetic beads (1:5
dilution of Agencourt RNAClean XP in 2.5 M
NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 20% (w/v) PEG
8000, 0.05% Tween 20, 5 mM NaN3), the sample
plate was placed into the KingFisher system. The
protocol was initiated by mixing for 5 minutes at
medium speed. Next, beads were collected through

5 iterations of 30 seconds each. Then beads were
washed for 15 seconds in a wash plate containing
85% EtOH. For this, a bead-release step of 15
seconds was done in the beginning of the wash
step, followed by collecting the beads three times
for 5 seconds. Beads were then air-dried for 3
minute and released into the bead-LAMP reaction
mixture for 1 minute at fast speed. The protocol is
available upon request.
Both manual and automated KingFisher beadLAMP reactions were run at 63°C for 25 cycles (1
minute cycle length) in a BioRad CFX Connect
qPCR cycler with SYBR readings after every
cycle. Colorimetric signal was read out after
reaction completion using a simple smartphone
camera. Reactions with yellow color were scored
as positive, pink color as negative and everything
between as intermediate.

Figure S2: RT-LAMP and bead-LAMP
A. Schematic illustrating the reaction principle of reverse transcription loop-mediated amplification (RT-LAMP) of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the RNA region targeted in this study (Orf1ab). The target region is recognized by a
defined set of primers (B3, LB, BIP, LF, FIP, F3). The RNA template (red) is reverse transcribed and displaced after
first-strand synthesis; the outer primer binding sites are added in the subsequent amplification step. The resulting
dumbbell DNA structure acts as template for further rounds of amplification, ultimately leading to high molecular
weight amplicons.
B. Schematic illustrating the workflow for the clinical assessment of RT-LAMP using HNB colorimetric read-out
(top) or bead-LAMP using Phenol-red colorimetric read-out (bottom). Bead-LAMP includes an upstream step, in
which RNA is captured from crude lysate using magnetic beads, followed by elution by the RT-LAMP reaction
mixture [1].
C. Scatterplot comparing RT-LAMP reaction times to direct RT-qPCR Ct values for each sample. The RT-LAMP
reaction time was obtained by real-time fluorescence RT-LAMP, using SYTO-9 as fluorescent dye, and
corresponds to the time at which the fluorescence RT-LAMP signal crosses the signal threshold.
D. Determined binned (left) and cumulative (right) assay sensitivity of RT-LAMP (blue), bead-LAMP (yellow) and
direct RT-PCR on 288 individual clinical samples. For bead-LAMP, both manual and automated (KingFisher)
protocol performances using different amounts of sample input are shown.
E. Scatterplots comparing real-time diagnostic RT-qPCR Ct values (x-axis) to RT-LAMP relative fluorescence units
(y-axis). The color indicates the sample type (naso/oropharyngeal swabs or gargle). RT-LAMP is shown on the left,
bead-LAMP is shown on the right.
