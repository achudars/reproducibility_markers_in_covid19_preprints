Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading throughout the world and all
healthcare systems are loaded beyond its capacity. The virus is named as SARS-CoV-2.
In this situation, rational decisions need to be made on how the care is provided for
patients with COVID-19. The Incidence report, general symptoms and readily available
testing kits, different control strategies, the basic compartmental model, and some of the
current research on the epidemiology of the disease are discussed and previously published models are reviewed. Modeling this disease helps in understanding the spread,
and predict its future to evaluate different control strategies (Social Distancing, Contact
Tracing and Hospitalization). Compartmental modeling framework is used in this work.
The non-linear equations are formulated and fitted to the cumulative case and mortality data. Analytical analysis along with uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis is
performed, and the conditions to achieve disease free equilibrium is evaluated. Finally,
Different control strategies are simulated to show their importance. This paper aims to
shows the advantage of mathematical modeling and their simulations in times like now,
during which the COVID-19 spreading like wildfire. It also includes Pre-symptomatic
and asymptomatic individuals in the modeling. The simulations are performed for the
model fit to Cumulative Case and Mortality data in the United States of America.
The Reproduction number is found to be 2.71914.

Keywords: COVID-19, Social Distancing, Contact Tracing, Hospitalization, PreSymptomatic cases, Compartmental Disease Modeling

Introduction

This paper is an effort to model the epidemiology and stop the spread of the novel
coronavirus, which is causing huge detrimental effects all around the world. The ultimate
goal is to slow the spread of the virus, using evidence based public health interventions,
which includes early case recognition, isolation and contact tracing. This disease has
grown from being a small cluster of pneumonia in china to a global pandemic causing
huge loss of life. Therefore, there is a huge need for modeling the disease, and simulation
of various control strategy implementation is necessary to make well informed decisions.

1.1

Incidence

Incidence is the number of new cases of coronavirus in a particular population in a period
of time. In general, incidence is reported for each country’s population. The table below

The incidence per 1Million calculated in the Table gives a better picture than the
number of cases, on how the country is affected. For example, by comparing India and
Singapore, India has twice the number of cases than in Singapore, and it does not mean
that India more is affected. The incidence per 1 Million for Singapore is more than 100
time to that of India’s. It is because the population of Singapore is far less than India.
The death per 1Million data also gives the information on how each country is handling the infected cases.
Among all the countries, Spain is in a very bad state with a mortality rate of 11.16%.
The United States of America has the most number of cases (1.2 Million as of May 8th,
2020) and has more than 75,000 deaths.

1.2

Spread of Virus from one to another

The Coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person, through respiratory droplets
from an infected person (via. coughs or sneezes). These droplets can go into people who
are nearby. It spreads, when people are near to each other. The droplets do not hang
around in the air and can not go more than six feet from the source (about two meters).
COVID-19 spreads sustainably in a community in many affected Regions. People are
getting infected with the virus, mostly without knowing where they are infected.
People also get infected when they come in contact with an infected surface and then
touches their eyes or face.

1.3

Symptoms and Testing

Symptoms for COVID-19 is not constant, and ranges from mild disease to severe illness.
Symptoms usually appears 14 days after being exposed to the virus. Major indications of
COVID-19 are Cough, Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, Fever, Chills, Muscle
pain, Sore throat, New loss of taste or smell [2].
Medical attention should be sought immediately if the following symptoms are noticed: Trouble breathing, Persistent pain or pressure in the chest, New confusion or
inability to arouse, Bluish lips or face [2].
With the restricted availability of testing kits, not everyone is eligible for being tested.
If it only causes mild illness, people are asked to recover at their home itself. Decisions
on who to be tested are made by health departments and healthcare providers.
By the end of April, a viral test has been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) that lets people to collect a respiratory sample (a swab inside of
the nose) at home, and send it to a laboratory for analysis. In most areas the collection
kits were made available via healthcare workers [3]. .

1.4.1

Control Strategies
Social Distancing

Things to do to implement social distancing: Avoid contact with people who could be at
risk, Avoid public places, gathering and crowds, Avoid clinics and hospitals, and Avoid
restaurants.
It is every individuals responsibility to prevent this virus from spreading, and social
distancing is a way collective effort in stopping the spread of this disease. In case of

emergencies in which we can not avoid going to different places, one should maintain at
least a distance of 6 feet from one another.
1.4.2

Contact Tracing

Contact tracing is carried out by a public health staff. They get data from the patients
with coronavirus to help everyone they have had contacted during the previous weeks
while they were infectious. The identity of the patient is not revealed for their privacy.
Traced individuals are given information on the risk of being infected, and are asked
to separate themselves from other susceptible people, and check for symptoms and illness. They are asked to monitor their body temperature twice a day, and if they have
symptoms, they should isolate themselves and report to a health care worker.
1.4.3

Hospitalization/Isolation

Hospitalization or isolation is the process of separating the sick people from the non sick
ones. With a steady rise in new cases of coronavirus, hospitals are working at maximum
capacity, and infected individuals are admitted only when they show severe symptoms
or have extreme illness. Temporary medical clinics can be setup in areas where most
infections occur can reduce the spread of the disease.
1.4.4

Quarantine

Quarantines are used by governments to prevent the spread of the virus. It is especially
for individuals have no symptoms but were exposed to the sickness. It is important to
keep them separated from susceptible people so that they don’t infect others without
their knowledge. Quarantines are used during an outbreak, or an epidemic, or during a
pandemic.
1.4.5

Masks

It has been debated whether masks are effective or not. The truth is that it works. The
effect of face masks is illustrated very clearly in the paper, ’To mask or not to mask’ [14].
Both hands should be cleaned before wearing the mask. There should be no gaps
between ones face and the mask. Never touch the mask, and discard them in a closed bin
quickly, once they are damp. Masks are effective only if the hands are washed properly
and the used masks are disposed properly.
1.4.6

Hand washing

Hands should be cleaned with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. Our hands
mostly touch different surfaces when we go out. Virus sticks to ones hands and can
infect us. Therefore, it is important to wash our hands regularly to prevent the infection.

1.5

Risk-High groups

Elderly people are affected the most compared to the young population. Mortality rate
for people in 75 to 84 years is in the range of 4-10%, and the rate goes up to an average
20% for people who are more than 85 years old. [22]

Individuals with medical conditions like heart/lung disease or diabetes are at a greater
risk for developing serious illness due to the disease [4]. People who are most affected
are ones with the following conditions: asthma, immunocompromised conditions, severe
obesity, chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, and liver diseases.

1.6

Kermack-Mckendrick model

The Kermack-McKendrick model [5] is a SIR epidemiological model. It explains the
rapid rise and fall in the number of infected cases reported in an epidemic. The model
assumes that there is no change in the total population size (i.e., no vital dynamics and
deaths due to disease), and that there is no incubation period.
The model has three nonlinear ODEs:
dS
= −βSI
dt
dI
= βSI − γI
dt
dR
= γI
dt

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

where, S is the number of susceptible people, I is the number of Infected people, R
is the number of recovered people who gained immunity, β is the infection rate, and γ is
the recovery rate.
The Reproduction number of this model is was called as epidemiological threshold.

R0 =

βS
γ

(5)

To control the disease outbreak, R0 should be less than 1.
This basic model structure first published in 1927 have been developed into many
complex epidemiological models over a century, and currently there are thousands of
published models. This paper also uses the same type of modeling methodology.

1.7

Literature Review of Major Models of COVID-19

As there are many uncertainties in hoe the corona-virus is spreading, there is is a huge
need for modeling the spread of the disease. Many papers are being published once the
pandemic began. The most predominant modeling papers are discussed here.
 A mathematical model for simulating the transmission of Wuhan novel Coronavirus
[6] is a different Paper than other modeling papers being published. They have
developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model. They have
simplified their model as Reservoir-People transmission network. It is a brief paper
with the modeling framework, the nonlinear equations and the first generation
method derivation for the reproduction number.

 A mathematical model for the novel coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan, China [7]. The
model is a basic SEIR compartments with a V compartment(concentration of the
coronavirus in the environmental reservoir) at the end. The model also includes the
vital dynamics of the population. They got a high Reproduction number estimate of
4.25. The inclusion of the vital dynamics in the model seems to have increased the
ability of the disease to spread more. It is also noticeable that they have modeled
three different transmission rate for every class that can be infectious. The paper
is concentrated towards Wuhan and therefore the dynamics vary a little from other
modeling papers.
 Report 9: Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19
mortality and healthcare demand.[16] This report is a very important, because
many policies in the UK and other countries are made based on it. It discusses
about various non-pharmaceutical interventions that are aimed at reducing contact
rates in the population, and the conclusion was that no intervention can impact
the contact rate if they are implemented separately. All interventions should be
implemented to achieve a synergistic effect.
 Forecasting the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 1 pandemic on hospital
demand and deaths for the USA and 2 European Economic Area countries.[8]. This
paper used data identification tools and statistical modeling to model the disease.
They have predicted a huge demand for hospital and ICU bed-days, and their
estimation of the number of deaths of around 1,584,737 in USA from the first wave
of seems unlikely. This gives us an idea on how compartmental modeling is better
than statistical data analysis for epidemiological models.
 Flattening the curve before it flattens us: hospital critical care capacity limits and
mortality from novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) cases in US counties. [9]. This
paper concentrates on the relation between available critical care and deaths that
occurs when critical care bed limits are exceeded. They have devised for 4 critical
care surge response scenarios. Their concern is that the mortality data does not
include normal patients with injury, who could not get treated due to suddenly
overloaded healthcare system.
 To mask or not to mask: Modeling the potential for face maskuse by the general
public to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic. [14]. This paper considers the importance of face mask in the prevention of the disease. Two models, one with no mask
use and the other with mask use and control strategies are created. Simulations
are done in both these models and the results are compared. It talks about inward
efficiency (prevention from catching the disease) and outward efficiency (preventing the transmission of the disease). The model for the exponentially decaying
infectious contact rate in this work is inspired from this paper. The model is parameterized for the data for New York and Washington. They found that the usage
of masks have a huge impact than what we already believed it to have.

the other has re-Susceptible factor in the model. Other simulations such as short
lock down, and healthcare system saturation is also presented.

COVID-19. [11]. This paper talks about the various possible compartmental models which can be used as the base model for the novel coronavirus. A discussion on
these models (modified SEIR, splitting the exposed group into different compartments, and including asymptomatic population), explains them well. This paper is
highly illustrative with many simulations.
 Construction of Compartmental Models for COVID-19 with Quarantine, Lockdown and Vaccine Interventions [12]. Many epidemiological models are formed
and the dynamics are analysed. They also explore the transmissibility of the viral
infection during different control strategies like quarantine, lock-downs, and vaccinations. The dynamics of coronavirus is simulated for the data in Ghana. It is
interesting to see that the basic reproduction number is less than 1, and they expect
that the disease will be gone in two to four months. The graphical representation
of the model framework used in this work is inspired from this paper.
 Modeling the Spread of COVID-19 with COMSOL Multiphysics [13]. COMSOL
Multiphysics is a virtual dynamical simulation software. They have used the software to simulate the compartmental models with an aim to flatten the curve. They
have presented a basic SEIR model an a SEIR model with many sub-compartments
of Exposed and Infectious class. It is amazing how a physics simulation software
can be used to simulate dynamics of epidemiology.

The modeling framework consists of susceptible, exposed, pre-symptomatic infectious, symptomatic infectious, asymptomatic infectious, hospitalized-non ICU, hospitalized ICU,and recovered, with the classes respectively denoted S(t), E(t), P(t), I(t), A(t),
H(t), C(t), and R(t). In addition, a cumulative death class is also included and is denoted
as D(t).
After the incubation period in exposed class, they become infectious, but they are
pre-symptomatic for a period; a part of them eventually become symptomatic and the
others asymptomatic. A fraction of detected infectious individuals (by symptoms for
I(t) class; by contact tracing for A(t) class) are moved to the hospitalized class (nonICU), H(t), where they are isolated from general public. Some fraction of hospitalized
patients ultimately require critical care and they are moved to hospitalized ICU class.
Some fraction recover and some die in the classes I(t), A(t), H(t) and C(t). Based on
these assumptions, the deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19
is given by the framework in Figure 1, and the corresponding deterministic system of
nonlinear differential equations is given below.

All the parameters in the model is defined and a default value is estimated. They are
found by searching research literature, official reports or by fitting the model to the
available data.

We assume that β decrease right from the beginning (without delay) because our initial
condition β0 for the model is set to be on 01-March-2020, during when they started to
implement preventive measures. It decreases to βmin as the time passes at the rate of
r. βmin required to get to disease free equilibrium is calculated from conditions for the
basic reproduction number. The βmin and r are fixed during the model fitting process.

 φIH is the rate of hospitalization of symptomatic people. The median interval from
symptom onset to admission was 7 days (interquartile range [IQR] = 3–9 days)[21].
The percentage of hospitalization is 20 [22]. So, φIH = (1/7)*0.2 = 0.028.
 σA is the rate at which asymptotic individuals are detected using contact tracing
and hospitalized. It is the product of the percentage of contact-tracing execution
and the rate of asymptomatic hospitalization. Contact tracing reduced the time
taken to identify and isolate patients after onset of symptoms to 2.7 days [23]. ct
ia control variable (varied in the simulations)
σA = ct . φAH ; 0 < ct < 1 ; φAH = 1/2.7.
Default ct is taken to be 0.1. Therefore, default σA is (1/2.7)*0.1 = 0.037.
 φHC is the rate of ICU admission from Hospitalization. In a study by Chen Wang
et al. [25], of the patients hospitalised 32% required admission to an intensive care
unit. In another report from Imperial College [24], they calculate bed demand
numbers assuming a total duration of stay in hospital of 8 days if critical care is
not required and 16 days (with 10 days in ICU) if critical care is required. With
30% of hospitalised cases requiring criticalcare, they obtained an overall mean duration of hospitalisation of 10.4days, slightly shorter than the duration from hospital
admission to discharge observed for COVID-19 cases internationally. Therefore,
if someone needs critical care, on an average they stay in the hospital for 6 days
before moving to ICU.
So, φHC = (1/6)*0.32 = 0.0533.
Also γH , the recovery rate of Hospitalized people for whom critical care is not
required is 1/8; and γC , the recovery rate of Hospitalized in need of ICU is 1/9
[26].
 Both γI , the recovery rate of Symptomatic individuals and γA , the recovery rate of
Asymptomatic individuals, is on an average found to be 1/7. It is because, on an
average the people in these classes recover in 7 days.
 δI , the death rate of Symptomatic individuals. It is found that the average duration
between the onset of symptoms and death is 22 days [26]. The mortality rate among
the cases found is 3.4% [28].
So, δI = (1/22)*0.034 = 0.00154.
 δA is the death rate of the Asymptomatic population, is assumed to be half of δI
[29]
So, δA = δI / 2 = 0.00077.
 δH (death rate, Hospitalized - Non ICU) It is found that the average duration
between hospitalization and death is 8 days [26].
With the mortality rate of 3.4%, δH = (1/8)*0.034 = 0.00425.
 δC (death rate, Hospitalized - ICU) It is found that the average duration between
ICU admission and death is 7 days [26].
With the mortality rate of 3.4%, δH = (1/7)*0.034 = 0.00485.

Model fitting

The state-level time series for both cumulative mortality data and cumulative case data,
compiled by Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University
[31], from March 1, 2020, through April 27, 2020, is used to calibrate the model initial
conditions I(0) and infective contact rate, β0 , when β(t) is taken as an explicit function
of time. Other parameters are fixed at default values in Table 2. Parameter fitting was
performed using nonlinear least squares algorithm im-plemented using the lsqcurvefit
function in MATLAB.
2.2.1

Model fitting using Mortality data only

Parameters calibrated for the model fitted for the mortality data (with βm set to be 0.1):
 The initial condition I(0) is fitted to be 11222.24501, that is 11223 cases should
have been actually reported on March 1, 2020, but this condition seems to be high
compared to the actual case data on that day.
 The infective contact rate, β0 is fitted to be 1.16562.

(a)
Cumulative Deaths data fitting till 04/27
β0 = 1.16562; I(0) = 11222.24501

(b)
The fitted model simulated till 11/06
β0 = 1.16562; I(0) = 11222.24501

Figure 2: Model fitting using Mortality data only
Even though the model fits the death data nicely, the the number of cases through
the time simulated is underestimated, and the initial case number I(0) is overestimated.
Therefore, the case data should also be used while fitting the model.
2.2.2

Model fitting using both Mortality and case data simultaneously

Parameters calibrated for the model fitted for mortality and case data (with βm set to
be 0.1) are the initial condition and β0 .
The initial condition I(0) is fitted to be 5848.92619, that is 5849 cases should have
been actually reported on March 1, 2020, and this condition could have been the actual
case data (combining the reported and unreported cases) on that day.

Therefore, in order to get the corona-virus to disease free equilibrium, the R0 given

be increased, by reducing the number of days it takes to admit individuals after

hospitalization facilities in places where the cases are increasing steadily; and by
increasing testing speed and availability.

Uncertainity Analysis
Uncertainity in the fraction of people remaining asymptomatic (f )

As presented in the report from the center of evidence based medicine [20], the percentage of people remaining asymptomatic varies drastically in many different case studies.
Therefore, analyzing uncertainty in f is important.

As seen in the Figure 4, even 10% deviation of f from the default value causes a huge
difference in the model simulation. It is always better to expect the worst case scenario
in situations like this and make decisions so that many lives can be saved.
It can also be observed that the actual data till 4/27 lies well within the range, and
the future data is expected to be within the limits till 08/28 as shown in the simulations.
3.2.2

Uncertainity in infectiousness of people with no symptoms (η)

The infectiousness vary from person to person, this factor is very sensitive and affects
the predictions hugely. Therefore, analyzing uncertainty in η is also important.
As seen in the Figure 5, even 4% to 6% deviation of η from the default value causes
a huge difference in the model simulation. It is always better to expect the worst case
scenario in situations like this and make decisions so that many lives can be saved.
It can also be observed that the actual data till 4/27 lies well within the range, and
the future data is expected to be within the limits till 08/28 as shown in the simulations.

Sensitivity Analysis

It is important to analyze how changes in control parameters of our mathematical model
affects the whole model. This can be done by analyzing correlation of the parameters
with Reproduction number.

social distancing.

When ct is increased, R0 decreases. Therefore, to keep the reproduction number as

Simulations of Control Strategies

Simulations of the epidemiological model is performed in MATLAB. The differential
equations are solved using the function called ODE45, which solves non-stiff differential
equations using medium order method. The sample code is given in the Appendix for
reference
Three control strategies (Social Distancing, Contact Tracing Asymptotic population,
and Increasing Hospitalization rate) are simulated, and the parameters responsible for
implementing these strategies are varied and plotted together to analyze and compare.
These kind of simulations helps in making decisions during a pandemic.
3.4.1

Strategy 1 - Social Distancing

Strict rules on Social distancing should be implemented and followed, to prevent the
spread of the disease. The simulation in Figure 6 shows that, if strategies to increase
social distancing are implemented (that is, reducing β), the number of new cases can
be reduced, and the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is quicker. The number of
estimated deaths also decreases by a significant amount in the order of 105 .
Two new conditions (with β = 1 and β = 0.5) are simulated along with previously
simulated model, and the plots are shown in Figure 6 for comparison.
The time taken to reach reasonably low number of cases is reduced by at least two
weeks. Considering that the control measures are implemented continuously, the best
possible time to remove social distancing without getting the disease back again, would
be by early August of 2020.

The plot of simulations in 7 shows what will be the situation if that happens (say
from 05/20). The number of cases will start to rise again, this eventually will force us to
maintain social distancing again. Therefore, there will be a bigger peak in the number of
reported cases, and it will take 5 more months to get out of this situation. The number
of deaths will also increase as it takes longer to stop the spread of the disease.

upto 40 Million.
3.4.2

Strategy 2 - Contact Tracing Asymptotic population

The majority of new infections are created by infected people who is showing no symptoms, they can either be totally asymptomatic or presymptomatic. To reduce the spread
through them, contact tracing should be implemented. It is done by finding about all
the people who were contacted by symptomatic individuals in the last two weeks. If they
are tested to be positive of the disease, then they are hospitalised.
It is also possible that the person traced was the one actually who got infected, when
they got in contact with this symptomatic person. Either way, contact tracing is a way
to find and isolate people who could potentially carry the virus around and causing new
infections. This process of isolating those who could potentially carry the disease around,
is not executed at full potential, because not everyone who are exposed or asymptomatic
can be found out by tracing previous contacts.
The simulations in Figure 10 shows the predictions for two new values for the percentage of contact tracing implementation (ct = 0.3 and ct = 0.7), along with the default
value of 0.1. There is significant reduction in the number of cases over the month of May
and after.
It can also be seen that the number of recorded death estimate increases, this is
because the people who will die from this disease without knowing they had the disease,
are now found and tested using contact tracing, and their deaths are recorded.

3.4.3

Strategy 3 - Increasing Hospitalization rate (φIH )

Hospitals are struggling to handle the load of new cases. Therefore, it is reasonable to increase the number of temporary facilities and in many areas as possible. This will reduce
the time taken from symptom onset to hospital admission, and thus the hospitalization
increases.
φIH is increased in the simulations as shown in Figure 11. Two new rates - φIH =
0.04 (in which takes 5 days to hospitalize someone), and φIH = 0.05 (in which takes
4 days to hospitalize someone), are simulated. It can be seen that there is a decrease
in the number of reported case estimate. Increasing φIH did not impact the number of
cumulative deaths very much, as seen in the simulations below.

Figure 11: Model simulations for control strategy - Hospitalization
From the simulations of the three control strategies, Social distancing seems to have
a bigger reduction in the number of diagnosed cases. No single control meothod will
give the best result. It is only when all the control strategies are implemented, the
considerable change is seen.

Discussion & Conclusion

A good compartmental framework of the model is designed by including all major classes
of people. The most unnoticed classes during the modeling process of the coronavirus
are the Pre-Symptomatic people and those that are in need of critical care. They are
included in the model, and the model parameters are defined using the data from various
research papers, official reports, and interviews. Once the parameters are fixed, model is
fitted to the cumulative case and mortality data given by John Hopkins University. The
fit gave the values for β0 to be 1.33877 and I(0) to be 5849, which actual infected cases
in the US (on March 1, 2020).

Different aspects of the model have been analyzed and the effect of various control
strategies have been simulated.
The disease free equilibrium is discussed and using the threshold analysis, basic contact rate to achieve DFE is calculated to be 0.215. The basic Reproduction Number is
also calculated using the default values, and is found to be 2.71914, which is in the range
similar to what most modeling papers produce.
Uncertainty in the fraction of the infectious people being asymptomatic and in the
infectiousness of people with no symptoms are simulated, and the worst case scenarios
are found. In the worst case, the number of cases can go up to 1.9 Million by second
week of March, 2020. The death toll can go up to 0.5 Million by the end of August, 2020.
Basic sensitivity analysis is performed, and the correlation between different control
parameters and the basic reproduction number are found. β0 is the positively correlated,
and therefore should be reduced. The contact tracing implementation and hospitalization
rate of symptomatic people are inversely correlated, and therefore they must be increased
as much as possible.
The Control strategies are simulated and the results are analyzed. The Social distancing strategy seem to be best possible one right now. With the absence of vaccines, it
is better to prevent the disease. If the social distancing strategy was highly implemented
as shown in the simulations the number of cases during the peak can be reduced up to
1.1 Million. The duration of the implementation is also reduced by at least two weeks.
Other simulations have also been added to discuss what will happen if the social distancing is stopped in mid of May, 2020, or June, 2020 and then the control measure is
followed again. If the distancing is stopped in May and implemented again, it will take
till the end of the year to recover from the disease. If the distancing is stopped in June
and implemented again, it will take us to first few months of next year, which is not a
welcomed situation.
Another simulation in which the social distancing is stopped totally on 06/09 is plotted and the results are alarming. The peak will drastically rise up to 40 Million, and the
death toll will go upto 4.5 Million. Fortunately, this will not happen, because the control
measure can not be stopped abruptly as done in the simulations, and the government
will take actions before something like that happens.
Another Control Strategy is contact tracing of asymptomatic individuals. The simulations shows that the number of cases can be decreases, though the change is not as
predominant as it was in the case of social distancing. Anyhow, implementing contact
tracing along with social distancing will produce a good improvement of the control of
the disease.
The last control measure simulated was the hospitalization rate. Increasing this rate
is difficult , but even minor changes can bring a huge change. The current time it takes
to hospitalize someone showing symptoms is 7 days. The simulation shows the effect
of reducing this time to 5 and 4 days. As the rate increases to 0.05 (that is 4 days for

admission), the peak number of cases could have been reduced to 1 Million.
In summary, this paper shows the advantage of mathematical modeling and their
simulations during a pandemic like COVID-19. The process helps in making good well
informed decisions. In our case the United States of America should stay in lock down
at least until July, 2020, to prevent major catastrophe. Despite the protest against the
lock down and people’s social needs, the control strategies should be implemented for the
greater good. It is only when humanity works together, this pandemic can be eradicated.
