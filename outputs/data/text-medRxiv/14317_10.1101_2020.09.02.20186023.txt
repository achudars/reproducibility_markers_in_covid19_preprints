Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus motivates diverse diagnostic
approaches due to the novel causative pathogen, incompletely understood clinical sequelae, and limited
availability of testing resources. Given the variability in viral load across and within patients, absolute
viral load quantification directly from crude lysate is important for diagnosis and surveillance. Here,
we investigate the use of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 viral load measurement directly
from crude lysate without nucleic acid purification. We demonstrate ddPCR accurately quantifies
SARS-CoV-2 standards from purified RNA and multiple sample matrices, including commonly utilized
universal transport medium (UTM). In addition, we find ddPCR functions robustly at low input viral
copy numbers on nasopharyngeal swab specimens stored in UTM without upfront RNA extraction. We
also show ddPCR, but not qPCR, from crude lysate shows high concordance with viral load
measurements from purified RNA. Our data suggest ddPCR offers advantages to qPCR for SARS-CoV2 detection with higher sensitivity and robustness when using crude lysate rather than purified RNA
as input. More broadly, digital droplet assays provide a potential method for nucleic acid measurement
and infectious disease diagnosis with limited sample processing, underscoring the utility of such
techniques in laboratory medicine.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic represents a global health emergency with over 6 million cases of
SARS-CoV-2 infection and 359,000 deaths reported to date.1 Accurate diagnostic testing is essential,
yet false negative results persist with current COVID-19 tests, particularly during early stages of
infection prior to symptom onset.2 In addition, SARS-CoV-2 viral load varies throughout an individual
patient’s disease course.3 Indeed, repeat testing of patient specimens can yield disparate viral loads
without a change in clinical status, increasing the false negative rate and complicating patient
management. Given the key role of diagnostic testing in guiding public health initiatives and strong
relationship between viral load and transmissibility,4 these observations underscore the importance of
accurate approaches for SARS-CoV-2 quantification.
The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR)
as recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).5 Although robust in
many settings,6 qRT-PCR is limited by its reliance on a standard curve, sensitivity to inhibitors in
clinical samples, and inconsistent performance at low concentrations. Furthermore, current COVID19 qRT-PCR tests require multiple upstream processing steps, including sample collection, viral lysis,
and RNA purification, a workflow limited by shortages in laboratory supplies and RNA extraction kits
leading to bottle necks in COVID-19 testing. To mitigate these shortcomings, numerous tests are under
development, including loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)7,8 and CRISPR-based
assays.9,10 Although promising, these methods generally require upfront nucleic acid purification.
Experimental approaches attempt to analyze crude lysate directly,11,12 but the resulting viral load
measurements are not quantitative and overall assay performance remains unknown. Thus, a robust
method to quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral load directly from crude lysate would both simplify testing and
provide additional information to potentially guide clinical management.
Digital droplet PCR quantifies target nucleic acid sequences using many partitioned reactions.
In contrast to qRT-PCR, in which concentrations are inferred from amplification rates relative to a
standard curve, ddPCR cycles the sample to endpoint, after which target molecules are counted directly
by enumerating positive droplets. This approach provides several advantages over qRT-PCR, including
more precise measurements and absolute quantification without the need for a standard curve. 13,14
Moreover, ddPCR can detect a variety of viral pathogens including human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV),15 cytomegalovirus (CMV),16 and human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6).17 In COVID-19 patients, ddPCR
of purified RNA extracts demonstrates advantages for diagnosis and monitoring, particularly in patients
exhibiting low viral load.18–20 Although recent studies suggest ddPCR may be resistant to lysate-based
inhibition,21 fidelity from crude viral lysate without RNA extraction for SARS-CoV-2 viral load
quantification remains unknown.
Here, we show that digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) enables accurate SARS-CoV-2 RNA
quantification from viral lysate without nucleic acid purification. It provides absolute viral counts from
crude lysate, obviating the need for a standard curve while being resistant to reaction inhibition. In
addition, we find that ddPCR, but not qRT-PCR, yields accurate measurement of SARS-CoV-2 viral
load when applied directly to crude lysate without RNA extraction. In addition, ddPCR from crude
lysate provides comparable viral load estimates to qRT-PCR from purified nucleic acid. Finally, ddPCR
detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a clinically suspicious case negative by conventional qRT-PCR. Taken
together, these data indicate that ddPCR robustly quantifies SARS-CoV-2 RNA from crude viral lysate,
thus representing a complementary approach to conventional qRT-PCR in clinically ambiguous

scenarios where ultra-high sensitivity is needed or when RNA purification cannot be incorporated
within the diagnostic workflow.
Materials and Methods

SARS-CoV-2 quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. N1 and N2 nucleocapsid
primers from the CDC assay were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). PCR cycling
conditions including reverse transcription were run per the CDC EUA-approved protocol5 with the
Promega GoTaq Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR system (Catalog # A6120). In brief, a 20 L reaction comprising
10 L GoTaq, 0.4 L GoScript, 1.5 L primer master mix, 3.1 L water, and 5 L input RNA (or crude
lysate) was reverse transcribed by incubating at 45 C for 15 minutes followed by 95 C for 2 minutes
per CDC protocol. The reaction was then thermocycled for 45 cycles of 95 C for 20 seconds
(denaturation) and 55 C for 30 seconds (annealing) on either the ABI 7500 Fast DX (Applied
Biosystems) or the QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher).

Digital droplet polymerase chain reaction. The N1 nucleocapsid primers from the CDC assay were used
for all ddPCR data with the 1-step RT-ddPCR Advanced Kit for Probes (Bio-Rad Catalog # 1864022).
In brief, a 20 L reaction comprising 2 L reverse transcriptase, 1 L DTT, 1.5 L primer master mix,
5.5 L water, and 5 L input RNA (or crude lysate) was used for each sample. Droplets were generated
with the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad), sealed, and reverse transcription was performed
by incubating at 50 C for 60 minutes followed by 95 C for 10 minutes per manufacturer’s protocol.
The reaction was then thermocycled with the same conditions as used for the CDC EUA-approved bulk
qRT-PCR assay described above, and then read with the QX200 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad) with
thresholds between positive and negative drops set by QuantaSoft Software and confirmed by manual
inspection. For qualitative assessment of fluorescence, thermocycled drops were imaged using the
EVOS Cell Imaging System (Thermo Fisher).

SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viral standard preparation. In vitro transcribed SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards
obtained from Twist biosciences (Catalog #102916) were used for standard curve calculation across
qRT-PCR and ddPCR. Replication defective virus was obtained from Seracare via the AccuPlex SARSCoV-2 Reference Material Kit (Catalog #0505-0126), and purified RNA was generated from these
standards with the Qiagen DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit (Catalog #61904) as described in the CDC EUA
approved protocol. For crude lysate, samples were processed either using the QuickExtract lysis buffer
(Lucigen Catalog # QE09050) as previously described,11 simply heated for 5 minutes at 95 C, or added
directly to UTM for downstream analysis.

Human nasopharyngeal swab sample collection and preparation from COVID positive patients. Clinical
nasopharyngeal swab samples from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were collected in UTM and
acquired by the Chiu laboratory with approval of the University of California San Francisco (UCSF)
Institutional Review Board (IRB). The approved study was a no-subject contact biobanking protocol
using remnant clinical samples with waiver of consent under approval from the University of California
San Francisco (UCSF) Institutional Review Board (IRB). All experiments were performed in accordance
with relevant guidelines and regulations per approved UCSF IRB protocol. RNA purification and crude
lysis extraction was performed as described above. For qRT-PCR from purified RNA, samples were

diluted 1:4 given they were concentrated two-fold during purification and not mixed 1:1 with Quick
Extract buffer in order to provide direct comparison to crude lysis conditions. Of the 33 original clinical
samples obtained for analysis, 32 had sufficient material for qRT-PCR from both purified RNA and
crude lysate while 22 had sufficient material for adequate dropmaking and subsequent comparison
across all three assays (qRT-PCR from purified RNA, qRT-PCR from crude lysate, and ddPCR from
crude
Results
We sought to compare the performance of conventional qRT-PCR and ddPCR for SARS-CoV2 detection (Figure 1). The standard qRT-PCR workflow for SARS-CoV-2 testing requires sample
collection via nasopharyngeal swab, placement of swabs into sterile tubes containing universal
transport medium (UTM), and nucleic acid extraction to obtain purified RNA free of PCR inhibitors
(Figure 1, top workflow). The subsequent qRT-PCR result is thus critically dependent on the amount
and quality of template RNA extracted, potentially resulting in false negatives at low input viral copy
numbers. A simpler approach would be to omit the RNA extraction step, thus performing quantification
directly on cell lysate. However, inhibitors present in unpurified cell lysate decrease reaction efficiency
and interfere with accurate quantification, potentially leading to false negatives. We hypothesize
ddPCR circumvents this shortcoming by partitioning the target nucleic acid and sequestering
inhibitory molecules in separate droplets, permitting normal reaction kinetics and accurate viral
quantification (Figure 1, bottom workflow). From a practical perspective, such an approach would
simplify the overall workflow and obviate the need for a standard curve.
We first adapt the nucleocapsid N1 primer used in the CDC qRT-PCR assay for ddPCR and
evaluate our ddPCR assay on purified, in vitro transcribed SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards (Twist
Biosciences, Catalog #102916). Visualization of droplet fluorescence reveals a clear qualitative
difference between positive and negative drops (Figure 2a) with minimal background fluorescence with
a no template control (Figure 2a’). Quantitative analysis of fluorescence intensity similarly shows clear
separation with an approximately two-fold increase in fluorescence of positive compared to negative
drops (Figure 2b), again with minimal false positives in the no-template control (Figure 2b’). To confirm
the linearity and dynamical range of ddPCR, we compare SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards analyzed by
conventional qRT-PCR (Figure 2c) versus ddPCR (Figure 2d). Both bulk qRT-PCR (r2 = 0.96) and
ddPCR (r2 = 0.92) robustly quantify input RNA across the tested range and exhibit similar limits of
detection at 10 copies per reaction, consistent with published reports.18–20
Unlike purified standards, crude lysate from patient samples contains target viral nucleic acids
mixed with numerous inhibitory molecules. Thus, novel approaches aiming to directly analyze patient
samples without nucleic acid purification implement lysis strategies, such as heating input samples or
utilizing extraction buffers that stabilize reaction enzymes and neutralize inhibitors. To determine how
such workflows impact assay performance, we compare qRT-PCR and ddPCR quantification of
SeraCare SARS-CoV-2 viral standards using three crude lysis workflows without RNA purification: (1)
incubation at 95 C for 5 minutes directly (heat lysis), (2) addition of QuickExtract buffer in a 1:1 ratio
followed by incubation at 95C for 5 minutes,11 or (3) directly from UTM. Conventional qRT-PCR
detects SeraCare SARS-CoV-2 standards across all three crude lysis conditions as well as purified RNA
at both 125 and 12.5 input copies per reaction using an assay cycle threshold (Ct) of less than 40 per
CDC recommendations (Figure 3a). However, we observe increased Ct values for all tested crude lysate
conditions in the absence of upfront RNA purification except for QuickExtract buffer at 125 input

copies, suggesting decreased efficiency when amplifying template from crude lysate by qRT-PCR. In
contrast, ddPCR accurately and reproducibly quantifies input viral copy number across all conditions
(Figure 3b). Intriguingly, UTM inhibits bulk qRT-PCR but does not affect ddPCR, suggesting ddPCR
may be useful for retrospective analysis of patient samples stored in UTM. No false positives are present
in the QuickExtract buffer samples analyzed by ddPCR, suggesting adequate digestion of background
nucleic acid. When compared to estimated SARS-CoV-2 viral load by relative quantification from qRTPCR standard curves, ddPCR offers more accurate viral load measurement both at 125 input copies per
reaction (Figure 3c) and 12.5 input copies per reaction (Figure 3d). Taken together, this shows that
ddPCR, but not qRT-PCR, accurately quantifies SARS-CoV-2 viral load from crude lysate without RNA
purification at low input copy numbers and in the presence of UTM.
To evaluate both qRT-PCR and ddPCR methods for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification from
patient samples collected by nasopharyngeal swab and stored in UTM, we test 33 clinical specimens
collected from patients suspected of having COVID-19. When comparing qRT-PCR from purified RNA
versus crude lysate, the Ct values obtained following amplification from crude lysis processed with
QuickExtract buffer are consistently increased compared to Ct values from purified RNA, suggesting
decreased reaction efficiency and subsequently, inaccurate estimate of viral load (Figure 4a). In
contrast, absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral load by ddPCR from crude lysate shows
consistency with relative quantification by qRT-PCR from purified RNA rather than viral load
estimates obtained by qRT-PCR from crude lysate (Supplemental Figure 1a). Direct inspection of
fluorescence intensities confirms clear separation between positive and negative drops in patient
samples without false positives in the no-template control (Supplemental Figure 1b), consistent with
robust detection by ddPCR. When estimating bias by calculating the difference in viral load
quantification relative to qRT-PCR from purified RNA, qRT-PCR from crude lysate shows increased
differences compared to ddPCR from crude lysate at both low input viral load < 10 3 copies per reaction
(Figure 4b) but not high input viral load > 103 copies per reaction (Figure 4b’). Finally, relative
quantification by qRT-PCR directly from crude lysate, while positively correlated with measurements
from purified RNA (y = 0.69x – 190, r2=0.53), consistently underestimates SARS-CoV-2 viral load in
clinical patient samples, particularly at lower input viral load where qRT-PCR variance is increased
(Figure 4c). In contrast, absolute quantification by ddPCR demonstrates strong correlation with
estimates from qRT-PCR performed from purified RNA (y = 0.80x - 172, r2=0.92), highlighting the
improved assay fidelity with ddPCR compared to qRT-PCR when working from crude lysate (Figure
4d). In sum, ddPCR demonstrates better correlation with the current gold standard of qRT-PCR from
purified RNA for quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 viral load.

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the importance of diagnostic testing for novel pathogens
with assays that minimize sample processing and reagent requirements while maintaining accuracy.
Here, we show ddPCR allows accurate SARS-CoV-2 quantification from crude lysate while
conventional bulk qRT-PCR, the current gold standard, appears more sensitive to inhibition. When
analyzing crude lysate from patient samples, the result is higher rates of false negatives by qRT-PCR
with viral loads near the limit of detection. In contrast, ddPCR is robust to inhibition and accurately
quantifies viral load without nucleic acid purification. While the clinical relevance of patients
harboring virus at low titers with Ct values > 36 remains unclear, robust detection of such individuals
may facilitate identification of asymptomatic spreaders, monitoring disease progression, and evaluating
the efficacy of antiviral therapy.
While our results are consistent with previous reports that ddPCR is more resistant to reaction
inhibition than bulk qPCR,21 the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. One hypothesis is
that sequestration of inhibitors in empty droplets facilitates more efficient PCR amplification in
droplets containing template. In this scenario, the fidelity of droplet assays in crude lysate would likely
be independent of the specific molecular biology used for nucleic acid detection, and thus, such
resistance to inhibition may extend to other assays such as isothermal and CRISPR-based target
detection. Indeed, droplet LAMP for influenza exhibits increased resistance to reaction inhibition. 21
Future work investigating the mechanism underlying the improved performance of droplet over bulk
assays for other SARS-CoV-2 detection methods from crude lysate will be important to extend the
generalizability of our findings.
Detection of low titer SARS-CoV-2 RNA by ddPCR in patients negative by the ‘gold standard’
clinical qRT-PCR assay raises a potential concern of false positive results. While current qRT-PCR
COVID-19 testing appears prone to false negatives,22–25 it nevertheless remains possible ddPCR
demonstrates the opposite predilection for false positives. We attempt to control for this by including
bona fide no template controls for all assay runs. Furthermore, our finding of similar limit of detection
but improved precision with ddPCR compared to qRT-PCR is consistent with prior work in cancer.26
Importantly, comparison of ddPCR to qRT-PCR from purified nucleic acid extracts in larger COVID19 patient cohorts similarly demonstrates detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by ddPCR in patients
negative by qRT-PCR.19,20 Nevertheless, additional prospective comparisons of qRT-PCR and ddPCR in
larger patient cohorts are needed to confirm these observations.
Our work highlights the potential advantages of ddPCR for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, particularly
to obtain quantitative results from crude lysate, thus obviating the need for nucleic acid purification.
Our results motivate further validation of droplet assays for COVID-19 in the clinical laboratory setting
for patients at high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection despite negative qRT-PCR test results.
While the clinical relevance of patients harboring virus at low titers with Ct values > 36 remains
unclear, robust detection of such individuals may facilitate identification of asymptomatic spreaders,
monitoring disease progression, and evaluating the efficacy of antiviral therapy. Furthermore,
monitoring low viral loads may potentially be useful in the public health arena for disease monitoring
in presymptomatic or asymptomatic cases with low viral loads27,28 or across point-of-care applications
where minimal sample processing is essential. More broadly, the present data support the role of ddPCR
as a potential alternative to bulk qPCR in settings requiring nucleic acid quantification at low input
copy numbers without upfront nucleic acid extraction.

Figure 1. Comparison of the CDC SARS-CoV-2 detection assay requiring RNA extraction followed by
bulk qRT-PCR (top workflow) versus our ddPCR approach directly on crude lysate (bottom workflow).
Red molecules represent target nucleic acids while black molecules represent viral proteins and other
reaction inhibitors present in unpurified cell lysate. Digital droplet PCR potentially improves viral load
quantification by sequestering reaction inhibitors in separate droplet from target nucleic acid
sequences.

Figure 4. Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), but not bulk qRT-PCR, accurately quantifies SARS-CoV-2 viral
load from patient nasopharyngeal samples without nucleic acid isolation. (a) Ct values for qRT-PCR
from purified RNA (black) versus RNA prepared from crude lysate (red) shows decreased PCR
efficiency without upfront nucleic acid purification of patient samples as evidenced by increase Ct
values (n=32 samples). (b) Average difference in viral load between qRT-PCR from purified RNA versus
