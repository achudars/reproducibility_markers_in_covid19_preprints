Introduction

The ongoing pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 infection has already
claimed

more

than

1.35

million

lives,

with

close

to

60

million

documented

infections

worldwide. The acute respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV2 infection, the coronavirus
disease 2019 or COVID-19, present with a plethora of symptoms usually found to be spread
over two distinct temporal phases in patients who are symptomatic. The symptoms in the
initial milder phase variably include malaise, fatigue, fever, cough, loss of smell and taste
and

diarrhoea

in

some,

mostly

followed

by

recovery

(Huang

et

al.,

2020).

But

in

a

considerable fraction of patients this milder phase later on culminates in a more severe
disease,

characterized

by

gradually

worsening

hypoxemia

requiring

exogenous

O2

supplementation. In some patients suffering from this severe disease a progression to acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is encountered, leading to untoward fatal outcomes in
a

number

of

them

(Huang

et

al.,

2020;

WHO,

2020).

Individuals

having

metabolic

co-

morbidities have been shown to have a predilection for COVID-19 disease severity (Lim et
al.,

2020).

An

aberrant

hyper-activation

of

the

immune

system

has

been

found

to

be

associated with these severe symptoms, most notably characterized by by a systemic deluge
of inflammatory cytokines or ‘cytokine storm’ (Laing et al., 2020; Arunachalam et al., 2020;
Lucas et al., 2020).

Apart

from

the

medical

interventions

aimed

at

mitigating

symptomatologies,

different

therapeutic approaches are currently being explored, either by repurposing specific antiviral agents, viz. remdesivir (Goldman et al., 2020), or by using corticosteroids to affect
immunomodulation (Horby et al., 2020), to treat patients progressing to the severe disease.
A

number

of

patients

also

present

with

intravascular

thrombosis

and

thus

a

role

for

prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation has also found place in the standard of care in
severe patients (Billett et al., 2020). But in the absence of proven efficacy of any specific
pathogen-targeted

therapy,

convalescent

plasma

transfusion

is

an

age-old

strategy

for

passive immunization, with the primary intention to supplement non-recovering patients
with

antibodies

against

specific

pathogens

(Rubin,

2020).

Convalescent

plasma

therapy

(CPT) has emerged as a widely tried strategy against COVID-19 too, having been explored in
a large number of clinical trials all over the world (Agarwal et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020;
Joyner et al., 2020; Rubin, 2020; Li L et al., 2020). We report here the insights gathered from

Collection of convalescent plasma
Convalescent

donors

were

recruited

and

screened

at

the

Department

of

Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Medical College Hospital, Kolkata, India. The
inclusion criteria for donors were: age > 18 years, males or nulliparous female convalescent
volunteers with history of being positive for SARS-CoV2 on RT-PCR, having weight > 55Kg,
complete resolution of symptoms at least 28 days prior to donation, and a negative RT-PCR
test for SARS-CoV2 before plasma donation. Consenting convalescent patients not fit to
donate blood based on the history and examination, who have had transfusion of blood
products in last one year were excluded from donation. A questionnaire was used to collect
data on the disease course from all convalescent donors. On the screening day, peripheral
blood samples were drawn for the following pre-donation tests: blood group (ABO grouping
and Rh phenotyping) and antibody screening for clinically significant antibodies (Extended
Rh, Kell, Duffy, Kidd, MNS, antibody screen positive donors were excluded), complete blood
count

including

count (Hb >

hemoglobin,

hematocrit,

platelet

count,

total

and

12.5g/dl, platelet count > 1,50,000 per microliter of

differential

leucocyte

blood and TLC within

normal limits were included), screening for HIV, HBV and HCV, MP and syphilis by serology
and ID-NAT for Hep B and C and HIV1 (all non-reactive donors by both tests were included),
total serum protein (donors with total serum protein > 6gm/dl will be accepted, as per
Drugs and Cosmetics (Second Amendment) Rules, 2020. For initial 18 convalescent donors
pre-donation screening for anti-SARS-CoV2 spike protein IgG content of their plasma could
not be done due to absence of dependable assay kits. Once it was available (Euroimmun) all
donors were also pre-screened for anti-SARS-CoV2 spike IgG. For first 18 donors it was done
retrospectively.

All

donated

plasma

were

tested

for

their

neutralizing

antibody

content

using an in vitro surrogate neutralization kit (Tan et al., 2020). For prescreened donors a
value of 1.5 for the ratio optical density between the sample and calibrator was taken as a
cut-off for inclusion. A fraction of convalescent plasma sample was also characterized for
their proteome using LC-MS/MS (described below). Plasmapheresis on eligible donors were
done on a Haemonetics MCS+ Cell Separator. 400 ml of plasma was collected and aliquoted
with sterile connections (Terumo TSCD) in two plasma bags containing 200ml each and
cryostored at -80 deg C, until commissioned for transfusion in an ABO-matched recipient.

precluding infusion of blood products were excluded. The trial was designed to recruit 40
patients

in each arm.

Accordingly, 80 patients were enrolled in to the

trial at ID & BG

Hospital, Kolkata, India, the first patient being recruited on May 31, 2020 and the last on
October 12, 2020. Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were randomized into either the
SOC arm receiving only the standard of care therapy, as per current advisory, or in to the
CPT group to receive two consecutive doses of ABO-matched 200ml convalescent plasma on
two consecutive days, the first transfusion being on the day of enrolment, in addition to
standard of care. Nasopharyngeal swabs, fecal samples and peripheral blood in EDTA vials
were collected on the day of enrollment (time point 1 or T1). Then on the 3
post-enrollment (time point 2 or T2) and finally on the 7

Standard-of-care
Most patients infected with SARS-CoV2 at diagnosis received Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg
BD on first day followed by 400 mg OD for four days, Azithromycin 500mg OD for 5 days,
Ivermectin 12 mg OD for 5days and Doxycyclin 100 mg BD for 10 days. At the clinical trial
site (ID & BG Hospital, Kolkata, India) standard-of-care (SOC) in all patients with evidence for
ARDS were: O2 therapy as per requirement, either intravenous or oral corticosteroids, for
patients with D-dimer <1000 Fibrinogen Equivalent Units (FEU) prophylactic anticoagulation
and for patients with D-dimer >1000 ng/ml FEU therapeutic anticoagulation using either low
molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin, appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic
therapy based on clinical, biochemical and microbiological assessment, appropriate antidiabetic therapy

(Klenow) fragment (New England Biolabs, Cat. No. M0210S). Double stranded cDNA thus
obtained was purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Cat. No. A63881). SARSCoV-2 genome was then amplified from 100ng of the purified cDNA following the ARTIC V3
primer protocol. Sequencing library preparation consisting of End Repair/dA tailing, Native
Barcode Ligation, and Adapter Ligation was performed with 200ng of the multiplexed PCR
amplicons according to Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) library preparation protocolPCR tiling of COVID-19 virus (Version: PTC_9096_v109revE_06Feb2020). Sequencing in sets
of 24 barcoded samples was performed on MinION Mk1B platform by ONT.

Nanopore analysis
The ARTIC end to end pipeline was used for the analysis of MinION raw fast5 files up to the
variant calling. Raw fast5 files of samples were basecalled and demultiplexed using Guppy

and aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference (MN908947.3) using the aligner Minimap2 v2.17
(Li H, 2018). Nanopolish were used to index raw fast5 files for variant calling from the
minimap output files (Loman et al., 2015). To create consensus fasta, bcftools v1.8 was used
over normalized minimap2 output.

Phylogenetic reconstruction
The assembled SARS-CoV-2 genomes were aligned using MUSCLE aligner in default mode
using the software UGENE v34 (Edgar, 2004; Okonechnikov et al., 2012). The phylogenetic
tree construction was performed using the Maximum Likelihood method. Visualization and
further editing of the tree was done in FigTree 1.4.4 (Rambaut, 2012).

groups. All calculations were done using the ‘Hmisc’ R package and finally converted to a
network file using the ‘igraph’ R package. Visualisation of the network was performed using
Cytoscape 3.7.2. Each cytokine was color coded and node size was set proportional to the
fold change of median as compared to the same cytokine in the mild datasets.

Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses, as depicted in the results as well in appropriate figure legends, were
performed using R and in some cases using Graphpad Prism 8 or STatistica64 (StatSoft).

Results

Recruitment of convalescent donors and characterization of antibody response
61 convalescent individuals (female:N:12, Age: 26 ± 2.98 years; male: N:49, Age: 35.37 ±
9.06 years) who recovered from COVID-19 at least 28 days prior to screening, were screened
for eligibility for plasma donation. 46 donors were found eligible for plasmapheresis. All of
them were screened at 40-80 days after they were first tested positive on RT-PCR for SARSCoV2 (Figure 1A). The nature of their disease course were assessed to be between 1-5 on

Inter-arm patient characteristics with viral load and humoral response

Age of

the

patients between two parallel arms was not significantly different (Figure 2A). The number
of days since hospital admission at enrolment was 3.85±2.63 days for SOC arm and 4.2±2.21
days for CPT arm, showing no significant difference. Most of the patients recruited were
suffering from moderate ARDS at the time of recruitment with a mean SpO2/FiO2 ratio of
108.38 on the day of enrolment for SOC arm and 111.43 for the CPT arm.

13 female

patients and 27 male patients were randomized into the SOC arm. 10 female patients and
30 male patients were randomized

into the CPT arm. All patients recruited in CPT arm

received two transfusions of 200ml ABO-matched convalescent plasma on two successive
days, first one being on the day on enrolment, except for one patient who succumbed
before he could be transfused with second unit, but not due to any adverse effect that could
be temporally linked to the first plasma transfusion. Transfusion-related adverse effects
were reported in none of the patients in CPT arm.
Viral loads at the day of enrolment (T1) were comparable between patients in the two arms
(Figure 2B). Viral isolates were sequenced from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from 14
patients in the SOC arm and 8 patients in the CPT arm. There was no notable difference in
viral clade representation among these patients recruited into two arms. All 22 patients
showed infection with SARS-CoV2 clade 20A (Figure 2C). The neutralizing antibody content
of plasma at T1 was also not significantly different between SOC and CPT (Figure 2D). A
significant correlation between the neutralizing antibody content of plasma was noted with
number of days passed since the patients first got tested positive for SARS-CoV2 on RT-PCR
(Figure 2E). Across all patients, from both arms, a significant negative correlation between
the neutralizing antibody content of plasma at T1 and concomitant viral load was found, as
expected (Figure 2F).

Greater attenuation of the cytokine storm with convalescent plasma therapy
The severe COVID-19 patients have been found by previous studies to experience a systemic
immune hyper-activation characterized by a cytokine storm. We had previously reported
nature and dimension of the cytokine storm in a fraction of these patients, comparing them
to patients suffering from mild COVID-19 disease (Bandopadhyay et al, 2020). On measuring
plasma abundance of a panel of 48 cytokines in patients from both arms we found that
correlative nature and magnitude of the individual components of the cytokine storm were
not notably different at T1 in a correlative network analysis (Figure 3A). Data from a panel of

As reported in this earlier

study done in a smaller fraction of these patients, a more significant attenuation of the
systemic deluge of cytokines at T2 were noted in patients in the CPT arm, both in terms of
calming down of the correlative upregulation and reduction in the median abundance of
major pathogenically significant cytokines (Figure 3B), as well as in terms of number of
patients in CPT arm registering such a change (Figure 4).

following enrolment (Figure 5A), survival (Figure 5B, Mantel-Haenszel Hazard Ratio 0.6731,
95% confidence interval 0.3010-1.505, with a P value of 0.3424 on Mantel-Cox Log-rank
test), duration of hospital stay since the day of enrolment (Figure 5C, median of 17 days for
SOC vs 13 days for CPT arm, P value of 0.098 on Mantel-Cox Log-rank test) or duration of
hospital stay since admission (Figure 5D, median of 23 days for SOC vs 17 days for CPT arm,
P value of 0.0797 on Mantel-Cox Log-rank test).
Then we performed a sub-class analysis on the clinical outcome data taking different agegroups into consideration, with an aim to find an age-threshold which registers minimum
hazard ratio but retains statistical power in this study with a relatively small size of the
cohort. On this analysis, with an age threshold of <67 years significant differences in terms
of clinical outcomes between two arms were noted. For patients with aged <67 years, a

Also the surviving patients registered early remissions in terms of duration of hospital stay
since the day of enrolment (Figure 5G, median of 17 days for SOC vs 13 days for CPT arm, P
value of 0.031 on Mantel-Cox Log-rank test) or duration of hospital stay since admission
(Figure 5H, median of 21 days for SOC vs 15 days for CPT arm, P value of 0.0235 on MantelCox Log-rank test). For patients aged ≥67 years there was no significant difference in terms
of either mitigation of hypoxia, survival or time to remission between the two arms (Figure
5I-L).

The

patients with convalescent plasma therapy adds to the growing literature on these trials of
different designs and sample sizes. The present RCT was done in a low clinical resource
setting in a single center. The clinical outcome comparisons revealed a significant benefit
registered in severe COVID-19 patients, most of whom had progressed to moderate acute
respiratory syndrome, and were aged less than 67 years. The trial also found a significantly
early mitigation of hypoxia among patients in the same age-group receiving CPT and reaping
the relative survival benefit. Of note here the patients in the SOC group who belonged to
the same age-group also could catch up on this by day 6 post-enrolment. This may represent

content of plasma and the efficiency

of

plasma to neutralize the SARS-CoV2 spike protein RBD-ACE2 interaction is shown. (F) A heat
map showing correlative clusters of 50 proteins present in convalescent donor plasma that
show highest variance among donors. Pearson correlation was computed and the R and P
values are noted when significant correlation is found.

SOC and CPT arms. (E) Correlation between the neutralizing antibody content of plasma at
T1 and day since the patients were tested positive on RT-PCR is shown. (F) Correlation
between the neutralizing antibody content of plasma at T1 and CT values obtained from
SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs collected at T1 is shown. For all comparisons
unpaired T tests were performed. Pearson correlation was computed and the R and P values
are noted when significant correlation is found.
