Abstract
Background: The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019.
The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as pandemic by WHO.
Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial for epidemic
prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and
public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the
Covid-19 pandemic.
Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model is developed to study
transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of non-linear differential equations
was formulated and the basic reproduction number R0 was computed. Stability of the model
was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel
restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted.
Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and
foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and
subsequent hospitalization of the population increases while placing interstates individuals
and foreigners under quarantine, decreases the chances of exposure and subsequent infection,
leading to an increase in the recovery rate.
Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, help in
effectively controlling the epidemic.

Modelling COVID-19 Transmission in United States
through Interstate and Foreign Travels and
Evaluating Impact of Governmental Public Health Interventions
1. Introduction
In December 2019, an unidentified pneumonia was found in Wuhan, Hubei province,
China. The responsible virus was later identified as the novel coronavirus 2019, and the
disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Cohen and Normile 2020). COVID-19 is
transmitted via direct contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets when a
person coughs or sneezes, or by indirect contact with contaminated surfaces with respiratory
droplets from infected person and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth(Holshue et al.
2020). Furthermore, the virus remains on surfaces from few hours to several days and has an
incubation period between 1-14 days. Consequently, the disease spread rapidly from Wuhan
to all parts of the country and overseas.
Introduction and spread of Coivd-19 within the United States is a direct result of
transmission through foreign and interstate travel. The first known case of COVID-19 in
U.S.A. was confirmed on 20th January 2020 in a 35-year-old individual who had travelled
from Wuhan to Washington state(Holshue et al. 2020). Soon, cases started appearing and
rising in many other states of U.S.A. including New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Florida,
Georgia, Texas, Pennsylvania due to interstate travel. The CDC alarmed that hospital may get
overwhelmed by large number of people seeking care at the same time due to widespread
transmission of disease which may lead to otherwise preventable deaths (2020). In response
to the oncoming epidemic the US government implemented the following regulations:

While the United States has implemented numerous public health interventions, it has
not implemented a ban on interstate travel. According to World Health Organization (WHO),
New cases of COVID-19 have emerged in 210 countries with 1,733, 945 confirmed cases and
106, 518 confirmed deaths globally as of 10th April 2020. The United States has implemented
quarantine measures, close contact tracing, early testing for individuals with symptoms,
hospitalization if needed, and closing of teaching institutes and non-essential businesses.
Studies have shown that in other countries, the complete lockdown of travel has decreased
the spread of the disease in the surrounding states(Castillo-Chavez et al. 2003; Tang et al.
2020). In order to prevent the transmission of Covid-19 within the US, the mode of
transmission must first be modeled and understood. Mathematical modeling is ideal for
evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission. Data-driven mathematical
modelling plays an important role in epidemic mitigation, in preparedness for future epidemic
and in the evaluation of control effectiveness.(Wu et al. 2020). In this study, we adopted a
disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model to shed light on the transmission dynamics
from foreign and interstate travel of the novel coronavirus and our aim is to assess the impact
of public health interventions on infection by measuring basic reproduction number, contact
rate, newly confirmed cases, total confirmed cases, total death. Our estimated parameters are
largely in line with World Health Organization estimates and previous studies(2019).
2. Mathematical Modeling
Mathematical modeling plays vital role in determining dynamics of diseases. In this paper we
consider disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model with compartments as follows:
Exposed to Covid-19 E , Covid-19 transmission in interstate IS , Covid-19 transmission
through foreigners F , Quarantined class Q , Covid-19 Infected I , Hospitalized H , and
Recover R .
Notations and parametric values used in the formulation of dynamical system model are
given in the following Table 2.

Table 2: Parametric definitions and its values
This model considers new recruitment in the exposed class at the rate B and all the
compartments have mortality rate μ . Here interstate population (it is the population within
the country) is exposed to Covid-19 at the rate β 1 and Foreigner population (it is population
arriving in a particular country through air ways) is exposed to Covid-19 at the rate β 2 . Next,
foreigners F come in contact with interstate population at the rate β 3 joining I S . Interstate
population and foreigners quarantine themselves at the rate β 4 and β 6 respectively. Similarly,
after getting exposed to Covid-19, interstate and foreigner population gets the infection
joining infectious class I with the rate β 5 and β 7 respectively. Quarantined humans also get
the infection at the rate β 8 . Next, we assume infected population gets hospitalized at the rate
β 9 joining H .We also assume population gets admitted to the hospital at the initial exposure
of the disease at the rate β10 . Hospitalized patients after undergoing treatment gets recover
joining R at the rate β11 We take into the consideration death due to Covid-19 when the
individual is hospitalized.

Reproduction number:
Basic reproduction number is defined as the total number of secondary infections in a total
susceptible population.
Here, we calculate reproduction number using Diekmann et al, when the disease in its
endemic stage i.e. for this model it is defined as percentage of population infected by a single
infection in a totally exposure situation(Diekmann et al. 2010).

We also compute the value of reproduction number RF when there are no foreigners present
in the total population.

In this section we discuss the simulation performed for the system (1).

Fig. 2. Transmission of individuals in various compartments
From fig.2. we observe 30% of interstate population is exposed to Covid-19 in 17.2 days.
Whereas 24.55% of foreigner’s population is exposed to Covid-19 in 21.8 days. 21% of
foreigners come in contact with Interstate individuals in 7.1 days which increases the
infectives of interstate to 22.78% in 9.2 days. Also 27.59% of interstate population gets
hospitalized in 14.5 days.

Scatter plotting is shown in figure 3. Combined effect of group of three compartments is
revealed in each plot. Fig. 3(a) depicts that; more infected interstate and foreign
individuals will be hospitalised at higher rate of level. Fig. 3(b) shows that, individuals
who travelled more will be quarantined. From figure 3(c), one can say that infected
foreigner would be quarantined at higher rate. All quarantined individuals infected more
than, they get hospitalised which is observed in figure 3(d). Figure 3(e) describes that
how interstate infected individuals are quarantined.

Fig.4 shows the periodic nature of the interstate class exposed to the virus Covid-19. It
indicates that interstate population is exposed again and again to the disease. It happens if the
lockdown, social distancing is not followed as per government system. Which shows the
importance of the government action taken against Covid-19 to protect the population. Fig.5
Shows the stability of the respective compartments at endemic equilibrium point. Since the
government has decided to quarantine foreigners as soon as they arrive in their countries this
makes the system stable as they are not exposed much to the Covid-19.

Fig. 11. Oscillations Effect
Figures 11 (a)-(g) show the oscillating behaviour of each compartment. As epidemic nature
of disease increases, this can oscillate whole situation of model. In some interval of data,
exposed individuals increase (Fig. 11(a)) who are either interstate (Fig. 11(b)) or foreigner
(Fig. 11(c)). If quarantined individuals do not follow quarantines rules which has been
observed in Fig. 11(d). This leads to a greater number of infected individuals (Fig. 11(e))
hence they should be hospitalised (Fig. 11(f)) which effects on recovery rate (Fig. 11(f)).

The above oscillating nature of the model is controlled by the fig.12(a)-(g). All the four
controls are effective to this model. Control applied decreases the number of exposed
individuals. Quarantining interstate and foreign individuals reduce the infection leading to
increase in recovery rate.

Fig.15. Percentage wise distribution of all the compartments of the model
From the fig.15 it can be observed that 7% of population is exposed to Covid-19. Interstate
population share the largest percentage. 14% of the population is quarantined including
foreigners and interstate population. Similarly, the infection is 13%. The hospitalization is
done at 15%. Of the total population recovery is 16%.
Discussion
Our model indicates that foreigners exhibit a larger infected population,
hospitalization rate, and infection rate when compared to the interstate population. Moreover,
as foreign individuals make contact with interstate individuals, the rate of infection within the
interstate population increases significantly. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the
first to create a disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model. Our model suggests that
both foreign and interstate travel lead to increased risk of infection within the United States
population. Consequently, we validate the effectiveness of quarantine as a public health
intervention model by the US government and encourage implementation of efforts to
mitigate interstate travel.
There are multiple reasons that foreigners have increased risk of obtaining Covid-19
when compared to interstate population. First, as people travel, they risk exposing themselves
to a greater number of other individuals. The WHO indicates that transmission of Covid-19
occurs primarily through droplet transmission(2019). Most methods of international travel,
including airways, railways, and waterways, crowd individuals in compact and enclosed
spaces. Being in close contact with individuals with respiratory symptoms in an enclosed
environment increases the risk of being exposed to infected mucosae(Tatem et al. 2006).
Second, the guidelines and strategies for addressing the epidemic differ among countries. For
example, while India has enforced total lockdown, the US government have not mandated
enforced lockdown(Chatterjee et al. 2020). Consequently, when individuals from countries
with different regulations arrive, they may be infected and increase the incidence of covid-19.
Finally, the vaccination standards differ among countries. In particular, BCG vaccine,
believed to confer protective effects against Covid-19 is recommended in some countries, but
not the US(Aaron Miller, Mac Josh Reandelar, Kimberly Fasciglione, Violeta Roumenova,
Yan Li and Otazu 2013). As a result, future research and modelling is necessary to determine
the protective effects of the BCG vaccine, and its potential to reduce the incidence of Covid19 within the United States.
Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, we recommend the
United States government close their borders to both foreign and interstate travel. We

recommend significant public health interventions at both international and interstate levels
otherwise large cities with close inter-transport systems could become outbreak epicenters.
Finally, we recommend preparedness plans and mitigation interventions be readied for quick
deployment on both a state and federal level. Based on our model, compliance with these
recommendations will effectively reduce the transmission of Covid-19 as a result of foreign
and interstate travel.
