Several studies from different parts of the world showed a significant association of

ABO blood group and COVID-19 susceptibility. It was shown that individuals with blood

group O are at the lower risk of coronavirus infection. To establish the association of

ABO blood group in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, we for the first time analysed SARS-CoV-

2 neutralising antibodies as well as blood groups among 509 random individuals from

three major districts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh region of India. . Interestingly, we found

neutralising antibodies in significantly higher percentage of people with blood group AB

(0.36) followed by B (0.31), A (0.22) and lowest in people with blood group O (0.11).

This indicates that people with blood group AB are at comparatively higher risk of

infection than other blood groups. Further, in line to previous reports we too observed

those individuals whose family members had ever been diagnosed with COVID-19. This

study was conducted between months of September 2020 to October 2020. The aim of

the study was explained to the people and informed consent were obtained. This study

was approved by the ethical committee of Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India.

The

Remarkably, other independent regions in the

country have also demonstrated a high level of seroprevalence

Nevertheless, it is

not uniform, rather sporadic.

In the collection of random 509 samples, we found a frequency distribution of 0.204,

high level of correlation between our data as well as published data, suggesting that our

sampling indeed captured the regional distribution of the blood groups.

We further grouped COVID-19 positive samples and estimated their ABO blood group

division. The 215 seropositive individuals showed their ABO blood group distribution of

(Supplementary Table 1). The relative comparison of blood group distribution have

type

(Table

and

Supplementary Table 2). On the risk scale, our investigation suggested blood group AB

at the maximum, followed by blood group A and B, whereas blood group O had lowest.

We would like to stress that our data does not include COVID-19 severe patients, due to

our sampling methodology. Thus, it limits us to understand the association of blood

group

with the

COVID-19 severity.

On

the

other hand,

it is highly enriched

for

the

asymptomatic patients. Therefore, our result can also infer an important insight that,

though blood group AB has the highest risk of infection, it may not have high risk of

severity. The large number of hospital data will be able to testify it further.

It has been shown recently that the Rh negative blood type has a protective role against

SARS-CoV-2

12.

We have tested this association and found out 0.333(95% CI 0.152-

0.587) seroprevalence for Rh negative individuals, which is not significantly different

than

(p>0.05)

(Supplementary Table 2). Thus, we did not find any association of Rh factor with COVID-

19. However, the limited sample size (15), of Rh negative individuals should be taken

with caution.

In summary, this is the first study in our knowledge which has been done on association

of ABO locus with the COVID-19 susceptibility in India using asymptomatic COVID-19

positive individuals. Consistent with the previous observations, we have also found that

the blood group O has least risk. However, we did not find any higher risk for blood
group A as reported earlier, rather we see severalfold increased risk of infection for
blood group AB.

With our novel sampling methodology, we have also able to deduce

that though blood group AB is highly susceptible for SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is unlike
for them to develop disease severity.
