Abstracts
Purpose As global healthcare system is overwhelmed by novel coronavirus disease
(COVID-19), early identification of risks of adverse outcomes becomes the key to optimize
management and improve survival. This study aimed to provide a CT-based pattern
categorization to predict outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia.
Methods 165 patients with COVID-19 (91 men, 4-89 years) underwent chest CT were
retrospectively enrolled. CT findings were categorized as Pattern0 (negative), Pattern1
(bronchopneumonia), Pattern2 (organizing pneumonia), Pattern3 (progressive organizing
pneumonia) and Pattern4 (diffuse alveolar damage). Clinical findings were compared across
different categories. Time-dependent progression of CT patterns and correlations with clinical
outcomes, i.e. discharge or adverse outcome (admission to ICU, requiring mechanical
ventilation, or death), with pulmonary sequelae (complete absorption or residuals) on CT after
discharge were analyzed.
Results Of 94 patients with outcome, 81(86.2%) were discharged, 3(3.2%) were admitted to
ICU, 4(4.3%) required mechanical ventilation, 6(6.4%) died. 31(38.3%) had complete
absorption at median day 37 after symptom-onset. Significant differences between
pattern-categories were found in age, disease-severity, comorbidity and laboratory results (all
P<0.05). Remarkable evolution was observed in Pattern0-2 and Pattern3-4 within 3 and 2
weeks after symptom-onset, respectively; most of patterns remained thereafter. After
controlling for age, CT pattern significantly correlated with adverse outcomes (Pattern4 vs.
Pattern0-3 [reference]; hazard-ratio[95%CI], 18.90[1.91-186.60], P=0.012). CT pattern
(Pattern3-4 vs. Pattern0-2 [reference]; 0.26[0.08-0.88], P=0.030) and C-reactive protein (>10

Introduction

Since the latter part of December of 2019, an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic [1]. As of
May 4, 2020, 3,356,205 laboratory-confirmed cases and 238,730 deaths have been reported
[2]. Numerous studies have revealed the epidemiological, clinical and radiological
characteristics of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [3-6]. Despite the fact that more
than 80% of infected patients manifest with only mild clinical symptoms3, early identifying
the risks of an adverse outcome remains the key to optimize management and improve
survival. Previous studies found that advanced age and presence of comorbidity (e.g.
cardiovascular disease or hypertension) were risk factors associated with an adverse outcome
such as admission to intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, or death [7,8].
In addition, some laboratory indicators e.g. elevated hypersensitive troponin I, leukocytosis,
neutrophilia, lymphopenia and elevated D-dimer were found to be linked with unfavorable

clinical outcomes [7-9]. Presence of consolidation on computed tomography (CT) was also
considered to be predictive of poor outcome in COVID-19 [10]. Despite the above, the
identification of early prognostic signs of COVID-19 remains of urgent importance due to the
diversity in clinical and imaging findings as well as the severity and rapid progression of
disease.
It is recognized that CT plays a central role in diagnosis and management of COVID-19
pneumonia [11-13]. Reported CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia included the ground
glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, septal thickening mainly along the subpleural lungs or
bronchovascular bundles or diffusely in the entire lungs [14]. These are highly suggestive of
lung organization response to injury from COVID-19 pneumonia, similar to radiological
findings in the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and organizing pneumonia (OP) [15].
Pathological studies also observed DAD in patients who succumbed to COVID-19 [16].
Previous studies have demonstrated a decreased survival rate of 35-50% in DAD, while most
patients with OP had better prognosis [15]. In this regard, a pattern categorization of
COVID-19 pneumonia, i.e. DAD and OP patterns may help the prognostic stratification.
Based on the prior study regarding influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia [17], Lee also suggested a
pattern categorization of COVID-19, i.e. bronchopneumonia, OP and DAD [18]. A rapid
progression of OP-like injury in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was considered
to be predictive of a protracted clinical course [19]. This may suggest a progressive subtype of
OP pattern. Based on the aforementioned knowledge, a CT pattern categorization of
COVID-19 pneumonia, i.e. bronchopneumonia, OP, progressive OP and DAD may have
potential prognostic implications, e.g. adverse outcome, clinical course with recovery. As

healthcare systems in many countries are overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients, improved
prediction of the course of the disease based on early findings can assist with improved
utilization of limited resources. To this end, this study aimed to investigate the prognostic
significance of a CT pattern categorization in conjunction with the clinical indicators on
clinical outcome and pulmonary sequelae in COVID-19.

Methods

Participants

The internal review board approved this retrospective study. Written informed consent was
waived with approval. Between January 22, and March 16, 2020, 172 laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19 patients who underwent chest CT were collected from 8 hospitals in China. The
cases were from 4 regions (Xi’an, n=80; Baoji, n=10; Ankang, n=18; Hanzhong, n=17) in
Shaanxi province and Wuhan (n=47) in Hubei province.
A case of COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive result on next-generation sequencing
or real-time RT-PCR. The disease type, i.e. uncomplicated illness, mild pneumonia, severe
pneumonia, critical illness (acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis or septic shock) was
evaluated based on the criteria published by World Health Organization (WHO) [20].
All the patients were treated based on Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by
COVID-19 (version 7) issued by National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of
China1, which includes initiation of antivirals, interferon, Chinese herbal medications,
supplemental oxygen as needed and hospitalization. The criteria for patient discharge with
recovery included: (1) afebrile for >3 days, (2) improved respiratory symptoms, (3) chest

imaging shows obvious resolution of inflammation, and (4) two consecutively negative
nucleic acid test results (sampling interval ≥ 1 day) [21]. The recommendations for
discharged patients included (1) 14 days of isolation management and health monitoring; (2)
follow-up hospital visits with a next-generation sequencing or real-time RT-PCR test and
chest CT scan to detect whether there exist a positive return and/or pulmonary residuals
excluding the underlying lesions on CT with linear opacities, and/or a few consolidation
with/without GGO at 2 and 4 weeks after discharge [21].

CT image acquisition

All chest CT were acquired by using 16- or 64-multidector CT scanners (GE LightSpeed 16,
GE VCT LightSpeed 64, GE Optima 680, GE Healthcare; Philips Brilliant 16, Philips
Healthcare; Somatom Sensation 64, Somatom AS, Somatom Spirit, Siemens Healthcare).
Patients were scanned in the supine position from the level of the upper thoracic inlet to the
inferior level of the costophrenic angle with the following parameters: tube voltage of 120
kVp, current intelligent control (auto mA) of 30-300 mA, and slice thickness reconstructions
of 0.6-1.5 mm.

Data collection and evaluation

We extracted the demographic data, clinical symptoms, and laboratory tests on admission
from electronic medical records. The date of disease onset was defined as patients’ reported
date of symptom onset. The time intervals from symptom onset to each CT were determined.
The primary clinical outcome was discharge or adverse outcome (admission to ICU, use of
mechanical ventilation, or death). The secondary outcome was pulmonary sequelae, i.e.

complete absorption or residuals on CT at the first follow-up visit after discharge.
All CT images and pattern categorization were independently evaluated by two
experienced radiologists respectively with 4 and 10 years of pulmonary imaging experience,
who were blinded to the clinical and laboratory data of patients. Prior to the evaluation, they
were trained by a lecture- and literature-based session that explained CT findings [10-13], a
chest imaging score assessing the degree of lobar involvement [22], and pattern
categorizations [15,17] of COVID-19. During the session, 209 CT images from 56 cases
randomly selected from this study cohort were individually evaluated and then differences
were discussed with a final consensus. The remaining CT images were first individually
evaluated and then evaluated together 3 weeks after individual evaluation. Any difference was
discussed with a final consensus. Individual evaluations were used for calculation of
inter-observer agreement (See more in the Supplement), and consensus evaluations were used
for subsequent analysis.
CT findings including the presence and distribution of GGO, consolidation, linear opacity,
pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were evaluated. The degree of lobar involvement and
total lung severity score were also evaluated [22]. Based on the degree or area of involvement,
each of the five lung lobes was scored of 0 for 0 % lobe involvement, 1 for 1-25% lobe
involvement, 2 for 26-50% lobe involvement, 3 for 51-75% lobe involvement, or 4 for
76-100% lobe involvement. A total severity score was calculated by summing the scores of
the five lobes (range, 0-20).
CT pattern categorization was performed by taking previous reports [15,17] (Table 1). In
cases with two or more patterns, predominant pattern was designated.

Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables were represented as means and standard deviations, while categorical
variables were expressed as counts and percentages. Differences of demographic, clinical and
CT imaging characteristics across pattern groups were analyzed by dependent sample t-test,
Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. Bonferroni correction was used in
multiple comparisons. Chi-square test for trend was used to explore the time-dependent
change of each CT pattern. Univariate Cox proportional-hazards regression was first used to
explore the risk factors related to clinical adverse outcomes and pulmonary residuals.
Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression with Kaplan-Meier curve plots were further
used to explore the risk factors based on the significant variables in the above univariate
analysis.
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS; Chicago, IL, USA) and
Medcalc 19.1.7 (MedCals Software Ltd; Ostend, Belgium). P<0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Result

Patient demographic and clinical characteristics

Of 172 patients, 165 patients were included. As of 16 Mar 2020, 94 patients had clinical
outcomes and 71 were follow-up lost without clinical outcome records due to hospital transfer
(Figure 1). Of 94 patients, 81(86.2%) were discharged, 3(3.2%) were admitted to ICU,
4(4.3%) required mechanical ventilation, 6(6.4%) died. 31(38.3%) patients had complete
absorption of lesions on CT after discharge. The median time from symptom onset to

discharge was 21 (range, 10-41) days, and median times from symptom onset to being
admitted to ICU, to requiring mechanical ventilation, and to death were 7 (range, 2-8) days, 8
(range, 8-49) days, and 33.5 (range, 7-39) days, respectively. The median times from
symptom onset and from discharge to post-discharge CT scan were 37 (range, 14-58) days, 15
(range, 9-29) days, respectively.
Patients were categorized into five CT patterns based on the baseline CT: 7(4.3%) were
Pattern 0, 36(21.8%) were Pattern 1, 67(40.6%) were Pattern 2, 32(19.4%) were Pattern 3 and
23(13.9%) were Pattern 4. All the patients had 478 chest CT, 34(21.2%) had 1 CT, 41(23.6 %)
had 2 CT, 39(23.7%) had 3 CT, and 51(31.5%) had more than 3 CT. The median time from
symptom onset to baseline CT was 7 (range, 1-44) days.
Table 2 detailed the clinical characteristics and laboratory results of patients by CT
pattern group. In the full cohort, the mean age was 49.5 (SD, 15.9; range, 4-89) years and
there was no gender difference (91[55.2%] men, 74[44.8%] women). Significant differences
between pattern groups were found in age, sex distribution, disease severity, comorbidity, CT
findings and laboratory results (all P<0.05). Significant differences were also observed in
multiple comparisons between any two patterns in one or more than one terms of age, sex
distribution, disease severity, comorbidity, CT findings and laboratory results (all P<0.017).

Evolution of COVID-19 pneumonic CT pattern with disease progression

Chi-square tests for trend indicated that as disease progresses from 1 to >3 weeks, proportions
of Pattern 1 and 2 remarkably decreased, while those of Pattern 3 and 4 increased (all P<0.01).
With regard to evolution of CT pattern, Pattern 0 to 2 showed a remarkable evolution with
overlaps of progression and downgrade within 3 weeks after symptom onset, and mostly

remained the same thereafter. Pattern 3 and 4 showed a remarkable evolution (progression or
downgrade) within 2 weeks, and most of them remained afterwards. (Figure 2)
Figure 3-6 presented CT findings with disease progression in Pattern 1 to 4 cases. Pattern
1 and 2 showed limited progression with increasing density and size of lesions from 1 to 2
weeks after onset, while had complete absorption subsequently. Pattern 3 showed a fast
progression from patchy GGO to extensively mixed GGO and consolidation within 2 weeks,
and subsequently turned into mixed GGO and linear opacities. Pattern 4 showed a
considerably fast progression to diffusely mixed consolidation and interlobular septal
thickening in both lungs and had adverse outcome within 1 week.

Prognostic significance of pneumonic CT pattern in COVID-19

Table E1 detailed the clinical, laboratory and CT imaging characteristics of patients in clinical
outcome and pulmonary sequelae on CT. Significant differences between discharge and
adverse outcome were found in age, disease severity, comorbidity, laboratory results, CT
pattern and CT score (all P<0.05). For pulmonary sequelae, significant differences between
complete absorption and residuals were found in age, elevated neutrophil percentage, elevated
C-reactive protein, CT pattern and CT score (all P<0.05).

Correlations of CT pattern with clinical outcomes

Univariate Cox proportional-hazards regression indicated that CT Pattern 4 (Hazard ratio
36.67, 95%CI 4.38-307.25, P=0.001) significantly correlated with adverse outcomes. Besides,
age ≥65 years (9.39, 2.38-37.11, P=0.001), comorbidity (4.14, 1.09-15.71, P=0.037), severe
or critical illness (4.62, 2.04-10.46, P<0.001), presence of fatigue (3.62, 1.16-11.28, P=0.027)

and chest congestion and/or shortness of breath (3.81, 1.19-12.18, P=0.024), neutrophil
percentage >75% (14.12, 1.75-114.21, P=0.013), CT score ≥10 (11.66, 2.31-58.75, P=0.003)
were associated with adverse outcomes (Table 3). Multivariate analysis indicated that after
controlling for age, Pattern 4 was found to be an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes
(18.90, 1.91-186.60, P=0.012) (Figure 7).

Correlations of CT pattern with pulmonary sequelae on CT after discharge

By univariate Cox proportional-hazards regression, it was found that CT Pattern 3 or 4 (0.23,
0.07-0.78, P=0.017) were significantly related with pulmonary sequelae. Beyond, significant

0.13-0.72, P=0.006) were two independent factors associated with pulmonary residuals
(Figure 8).

Discussion

By delineating the COVID-19 pneumonic CT patterns and their evolutional characteristics,
this study aimed to determine their value in predicting adverse outcomes. Results indicated
that CT Pattern 4 was associated with a higher rate of an adverse outcome after controlling for
age; meanwhile, Pattern 3 and 4 showed remarkably more prevalence of pulmonary residuals
on CT. Individual CT pattern for prognostic implication can be determined within 2 weeks
after symptom onset due to the remarkable evolution of patterns before 2 weeks and

subsequent stabilization or evolution without prognostic impacts.
A categorization of CT patterns was performed by detailing the extent of lung injury in
COVID-19. Differently from prior categorization of bronchopneumonia, OP and DAD [17],
lung involvement characterized by CT score was evaluated besides the CT signs. Specifically,
receiver operating characteristic curve analysis estimated the cutoff CT scores of 6 and 10 in
discriminations of Pattern 2 vs. 3 and Pattern 3 vs. 4, respectively (See more in Supplement).
Pattern 1 was found to be linked with a good prognosis as well as Pattern 0. This resembled
the prior reports of H1N1 pneumonia [17]. In contrast to other patterns, Pattern 1 may
represent the early stage of COVID-19 pneumonia and can be considered as mild illness
group. Pathologically, organization has been recognized as a common response in lung injury
[15,23]. In this study, OP patterns accounted for 60% and the overall degree of lung injury in
most cases especially for Pattern 2 was mild where reparative process and resolution of
lesions seem to follow. Note that more prevalence of residuals may indicate a protracted
disease course in Pattern 3. This may be related to the facts that Pattern 3 cases tend to be
older with higher prevalence of comorbidity and decreased lymphocyte percentage. For
Pattern 4, 85.7% cases had an adverse outcome. Pathologically, intraalveolar edema, fibrin,
and variable cellular infiltrates with a hyaline membrane were observed in DAD [16,24].
Pattern 4 cases had more severe disease, more prevalence of elevated creatine kinase,
neutrophil percentage and C-reactive protein than other patterns. It may be such facts that led
to the higher rate of adverse outcomes in Pattern 4. Previous studies have demonstrated the
residual fibrosis in 38% and 85% of DAD survivals, which may be related to barotrauma due
to mechanical ventilation or oxygen toxicity [25]. Differently, fibrosis was not pathologically

observed in COVID-19 death perhaps due to the short disease course of 15 days from onset to
death [26]. A long-term follow up of discharged DAD patients who survived after mechanical
ventilation or continuous high-flow oxygen therapy would be required to further understand
the sequelae. All the above demonstrated the potentials of CT pattern categorization in
predictive of prognosis in COVID-19.
Diverse evolutions with overlaps of progression and downgrading were found in Pattern
0-2 within 3 weeks and Pattern 3-4 within 2 weeks after onset. Most of them remained
thereafter. It is noting that 28.6% of Pattern 1 progressed to Pattern 2 from 2 to 3 weeks. This
evolution was consistent with prior report of acute and progressive characteristics of
COVID-19 [11]. In addition, this progression from Pattern 1 to 2 after 2 weeks may reflect the
organization regarding lung repair and would have good prognosis [15]. From the above,
individual CT pattern for prognostic implication can be determined within 2 weeks after onset
due to the remarkable evolution of patterns before 2 weeks and subsequent stabilization or
evolution without prognostic impacts.
Univariate analysis indicated that age ≥65 years, presence of comorbidity (70%
hypertension and diabetes mellitus), severe or critical illness, neutrophil percentage >75%,
CT score ≥10, CT Pattern 4 were significantly related with adverse outcome. These findings
echo the latest reports [7,8]. In details, a poor clinical outcome was associated with increased
age (>65 years) and presence of comorbidity in COVID-19 patients [7,8]. Laboratory
parameters including elevated levels of hypersensitive troponin I, leukocyte and neutrophil
were also found to be predictive of a poor outcome [7-9]. By multivariate analysis, only
Pattern 4 was associated with an adverse outcome after controlling age. In our cohort, most of

Pattern 4 cases were age ≥65 years (64.3%), presence of comorbidity (71.4%) and critical
illness (57.1%). This may be the underlying reason regarding Pattern 4 as only significant
factor in multivariate analysis. This further enhanced the potential role of CT pattern in
predicting the risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19.
As for pulmonary sequelae, CT Pattern 3 or 4 and elevated C-reactive protein were two
independent factors associated with pulmonary residuals on CT. Pattern 3 and 4 showed more
prevalence of pulmonary residuals than others. This may be linked with more severe CT
findings of these cases with more number of lobe affected and CT scores. In concert with
MERS studies that radiological sequelae can remain at least 1 year after infection [27], our
study found similar but slighter residuals mainly presenting with linear opacities and/or a few
consolidation and GGO. Beyond, elevated C-reactive protein may indicate the state of tissue
injury and/or acute inflammation. Continuous high levels of C-reactive protein in respiratory
infections were suggestive of a risk indication of progression to a critical disease state [28]. In
this regard, elevated C-reactive protein may be predictive of radiological sequelae. Prior
studies indicated that radiological sequelae from SARS and MERS may suggest the abnormal
or repaired lung function [27,29]. Despite the slight residuals in COVID-19, a long-term
follow-up is required to further trace the resolution and associations with lung function.
This study had some limitations. The first was the small sample, especially for those with
adverse outcomes. A larger sample is required to further verify the findings regarding the risk
factors affecting the adverse outcome. Second, because discharged patients remained during
the recovery and pulmonary CT residuals were unknown at the time of our analysis, a
long-term follow-up is required to further trace the outcome of lesion absorption, as well as

changes in lung functions. Last, multicenter data collection may lead to selective bias of
patients with various CT patterns. Although no significance in univariate analysis (see more in
Supplement), potential impacts from varying hospital, epicenter vs. non-epicenter should be
considered in further studies.
In conclusion, CT pattern categorization of COVID-19 pneumonia based on chest CT
within 2 weeks after symptom onset has prognostic significance. CT pattern 4 cases present
high risk of admission to ICU, need for mechanical ventilation or death, while Pattern 3 and 4
signal likelihood of pulmonary residuals on CT. These findings would help early prognostic
stratification of COVID-19 and facilitate the decision making for treatment strategy and
optimal use of healthcare resources.

Figure 1 Study flow diagram. COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019, ICU = intensive care unit.

Figure 2 Evolution of proportions of COVID-19 pneumonic CT pattern with the disease
progression. Pattern data were designated to four time groups according to the time from symptom
onset to CT scan: ≤1 week (CT pattern number=153), >1 to 2 weeks (CT pattern number
=147), >2 to 3 weeks (CT pattern number =101) and >3 weeks (CT pattern number =77). The
circular area indicated the proportion of CT pattern in each time group, e.g. proportions of Pattern
0 to 4 were 3.9%, 28.8%, 49.0%, 12.4% and 5.9% during 1 week after symptom onset,
respectively. Arrow line indicated the evolution of each CT pattern from a time group to the
following, e.g. 33.3% of Pattern 1 progressed to Pattern 2 from 1 to 2 weeks after symptom onset;
here four arrow line style denoted the categorization of evolution proportion, i.e. >50% (thick
solid line), >20 to 50% (medium solid line), >10 to 20% (thin solid line) and ≤10% (dashed line).

Figure 3 CT Pattern 1 (bronchopneumonia pattern) in a 38-year-old woman with COVID-19
pneumonia who was admitted to hospital at day 2 after symptom onset. (A, B, C) Axial and
coronal CT images demonstrate multifocal peribronchial ground-glass opacity (GGO) at day 2;
Axial CT images demonstrate increasing density and size of lesions at day 9 (D) and subsequently
complete absorption at day 19 (E).

Figure 4 CT Pattern 2 (organizing pneumonia pattern) in a 49-year-old woman with COVID-19
pneumonia who was admitted to hospital at day 7 after symptom onset and discharged at day 24.
(A, C) Axial and coronal CT images demonstrate multifocal ground-glass opacity (GGO), mixed
GGO and consolidation at day 7; Axial CT images demonstrate consolidation at day 13 (B),
subsequent absorption with mixed GGO and linear opacities at day 19 (D), and complete
absorption at day 45 (E).

at day 24. Axial and coronal CT images demonstrate a fast progression from patchy ground-glass
opacity (GGO) with slight bronchial dilatation (arrow) at day 7 (A), to extensive GGO and
consolidation with progressive bronchial dilatation (arrow) at day 12 (B, C); Axial CT images
reveal that extensive GGO and consolidation turned into consolidation and reticulation at day 21
(D) and into mixed GGO and linear opacities at day 46 (E).

Figure 6 CT Pattern 4 (diffuse alveolar damage pattern) in an 82-year-old woman COVID-19
pneumonia and with history of cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
who was admitted to intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation at day 7 after symptom onset.
Axial CT images demonstrate a fast progression from mixed ground-glass opacity (GGO) and
consolidation at day 2 (A) to a geographic distribution of mixed consolidation and interlobular
septal thickening at day 4 (B); (C) Coronal CT image demonstrates mixed consolidation and
interlobular septal thickening with diffused distribution of both lungs.

(admission to intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death) by categories of
COVID-19 pneumonic CT pattern (Pattern 4 vs. Pattern 0-3 as reference).

pulmonary lesions by (A) categories of COVID-19 pneumonic CT pattern (Pattern 3-4 vs. Pattern
0-2 as reference), and (B) conditions of C-reactive protein.
