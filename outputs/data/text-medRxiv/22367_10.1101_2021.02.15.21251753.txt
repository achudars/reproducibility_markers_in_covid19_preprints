Abstract
Although the COVID-19 pandemic has left no country untouched there has been limited research to
understand clinical and immunological responses in African populations. Here we comprehensively
characterise patients hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and healthy community
controls. PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants were more likely to receive dexamethasone and a
beta-lactam antibiotic, and survive to hospital discharge than PCR-/IgG+ and PCR-/IgG- participants.
PCR-/IgG+ participants exhibited a nasal and systemic cytokine signature analogous to PCRconfirmed COVID-19 participants, but increased propensity for Staphylococcus aureus and
Streptococcus pneumoniae colonisation. We did not find evidence that HIV co-infection in COVID-19
participants was associated with mortality or altered cytokine responses. The nasal immune
signature in PCR-/IgG+ and PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants was distinct and predominated by
chemokines and neutrophils. In addition, PCR-/IgG+ individuals with high COVID-19 clinical suspicion
had inflammatory profiles analogous to PCR-confirmed disease and potentially represent a target
population for COVID-19 treatment strategies.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has, to date, been less severe in sub-Saharan
Africa compared to Europe and the Americas (1). However, clinical diagnosis, triage and treatment
decisions for COVID-19 patients is particularly challenging in resource-poor settings. The increased
transmissibility of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants
observed in the second wave of the pandemic has made the need to address these challenges even
more urgent (2). Limited access to advanced life-preserving therapies such as mechanical
ventilation, and delayed presentation to hospital is common (3). This increases clinical and
diagnostic complexity as patients may present when severely unwell, and potentially, without
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-detectable SARS-CoV-2 (4).

Cytokine dysregulation has been consistently observed in COVID-19 patients in multiple settings (5,
6). Consequently, cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-, have shown potential prognostic value to
guide decisions on clinical management of COVID-19 (7, 8) but they lack adequate specificity. For
example, IL-6 levels may be 10- to 200- fold higher for patients with the hyperinflammatory
phenotype of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to patients with severe COVID19 (9). Beyond the use of single markers, systems approaches have demonstrated immune
signatures distinct to COVID-19 aligned with disease severity (10-12). They have identified a systemic
immune signature showing profoundly altered T-cells, selective cytokine/chemokine upregulation
(10) and monocyte and neutrophil activation in hospitalised COVID-19 patients (11, 12). Further,
inflammatory dysregulated IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-15 are associated with COVID-19 related mortality
(13). However, there are very few studies that have investigated the respiratory tract, the initial site
of infection and disease pathogenesis.

SARS-CoV-2 infection is established when the virus binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2)-expressing epithelial cells in the nasal mucosa (14). The few studies reporting mucosal
cellular or cytokine responses in COVID-19 have shown cytokine dysregulation and immune cell
disruption in the lower airway, correlating with disease severity (15, 16). However, there is a paucity
of information on immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper airway (17).
Minimally invasive sampling techniques of the nasal mucosa are well-tolerated, and highly useful in
human challenge models of respiratory syncytial virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (18, 19). Given
importance of the nose in SARS-CoV-2 infection (20), understanding the host–viral interaction at the
nasal mucosa could provide additional insights to understand and potentially modulate COVID-19
prognosis.

Immunological responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection at the nasal mucosa are still poorly
understood. Here, we analysed nasal mucosa and peripheral blood samples from a comprehensively
characterised cohort of patients admitted to hospital with suspected and/or confirmed COVID-19.
These patients were compared with adult healthy community controls. Immunological parameters
were studied using 38-multiplex cytokine assays and flow cytometry, while profiling of respiratory
pathogens was done using a 33-multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) respiratory pathogen
diagnostic panel. Our study provides insights on the cytokine responses in the nasal mucosa
following SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe COVID-19 patients and the potential importance of
additional confirmatory antibody tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative patients with high
clinical suspicion of COVID-19.

Results
Clinical Overview
Between 21st April 2020 and 25th September 2020, 87 patients (median age 47 years, IQR: 34-62)
presenting with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) were recruited, of whom 60 (69.0%) were
male (Table 1). SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) in 41 participants
(classified as ‘PCR-confirmed COVID-19”) (Figure 1a). The remaining 46 participants with suspected
disease were NAAT negative (Figure 1a). Of these, 25 were IgG positive against spike protein 2 and
nucleoprotein on serological testing. Using nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) and antibody test
results, we reclassified the patient groups into PCR-confirmed COVID-19, PCR-/IgG+ SARI (n=25) and
PCR-/IgG- SARI (n=21) participants (Figure 1b). In addition, we recruited 25 ambulatory healthy
volunteers. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics are reported in Table 1. Hospitalised
individuals with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were significantly older (median 50 [PCR+] vs. 34 [PCR/IgG+] vs. 41 [PCR-/IgG-], p=0.017), more likely to have received dexamethasone (63% vs. 4% vs. 0%,
p<0.001) and more likely to have received a beta-lactam antibiotic (78% vs. 52% vs.48%, p=0.022)
compared to the PCR-/IgG+ and PCR-/IgG- SARI participants. Additionally, PCR-confirmed COVID-19
participants were more likely to survive (93% vs. 80% vs. 57%, p=0.004) with increased hospital
length of stay (median days 8 vs. 6 vs. 6, p=0.028) compared to the PCR-/IgG+ and PCR-/IgG- SARI
participants. PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants also tended toward longer times from symptom onset to
hospital admission compared to PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants (median 6 vs. 4 days) (Table
1).

Distinct cytokine responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasal mucosa and systemic
circulation
We investigated the cytokine response in nasal lining fluid and serum of our four participant groups.
Our analysis was limited to 25 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants (who were IgG positive), 16
PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants, 11 PCR-/IgG- SARI participants and 25 healthy controls, from whom we
had paired nasal lining fluid and serum samples. We measured the concentration of 37 cytokines
(and sCD40L) in paired nasal lining fluid and serum samples of the four study groups (Figure S2 and
S3). We found altered cytokine levels in both nasal lining fluid and serum of PCR-confirmed COVID19 participants, PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants and PCR-/IgG- SARI participants, relative to healthy
controls (Figure 2a). Specifically, high concentrations of inflammation-related cytokines were
common among all the patient groups compared to healthy controls, including IL-1, IL-1, IL-6,
MIP-1 and TNF- in nasal lining fluid, and raised levels of IL-6, IL-10, IP-10 and IL-15 in serum
(Figure 2b).

In comparison to PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (nasal, n=7; serum, n=5) and PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants
(nasal, n=8; serum, n=8), PCR-/IgG- SARI participants (nasal, n=11; serum, n=14) had an increased
number of cytokines with higher concentrations than healthy controls in nasal lining fluid and serum
(Figure 2a-b). In comparison to PCR-/IgG- SARI participants (nasal, n=0; serum, n=2), PCR-confirmed
COVID-19 (nasal, n=9; serum, n=5) and PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants (nasal, n=5; serum, n=8) had an
increased number of cytokines with lower concentrations than healthy controls in nasal lining fluid
and serum (Figure 2a-b). Relative to healthy controls, low levels of IL-4, IL-1RA, GRO and VEGF, and
high levels of IL-2 in nasal lining fluid, were confined to PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and PCR-/IgG+ SARI
participants (Figure 2b). While in serum, low levels of EGF, Flt-3L, MDC and IL-12p70 in serum were
distinctive to PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants (Figure 2b). In addition, IL-3
levels were distinctively high in nasal lining fluid and serum of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and PCR/IgG+ SARI participants, relative to healthy controls (Figure 2a, S3 and S4). The results demonstrate
SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a distinct cytokine response in the nasal mucosa compared to systemic
circulation. This also suggests that PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants may be
presenting at different stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection spectrum.

Severe COVID-19 is associated with a distinct nasal and serum cytokine profile to non-COVID-19
SARIs
Due to the similarity of the cytokines induced in PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants relative to PCRconfirmed COVID-19 (Figure 2a-b), coupled with clinical manifestations of COVID-19 (Table 1), and

the positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology result (Figure 2b), we explored if clinical reclassification of PCR/IgG+ SARI participants as COVID-19 disease was warranted. We hypothesised that using an
unsupervised analysis the immunological phenotype of PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants would be
analogous to PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants, but distinct from PCR-/IgG- SARI participants
and healthy controls. First, we performed a principal-component analysis (PCA) of all the analytes for
the patients and controls in either nasal lining fluid and serum. In both compartments, PCA
segregated together PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants and PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants, away
from healthy controls, whereas PCR-/IgG- SARI participants appeared as a heterogeneous group
(Figure 3a and Figure 3b). Second, we analysed the active cytokine functional families in nasal and
serum, to ascertain whether PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants had immunological pathways similar to
PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants. Analysis of the active cytokine functional families has
previously been used to define immune signatures unique to COVID-19 (10-12). To aid interpretation
of the data, the cytokines were divided into functional groups including growth factors, chemokines,
adaptive, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. In both nasal lining fluid and serum, differential
interaction of cytokines was observed among the study groups, with the cytokine interaction profile
being generally similar between PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants and PCR-confirmed COVID-19
participants, but distinct from PCR-/IgG- SARI participants and healthy controls (Figure 3c and Figure
3d). Specifically, in the nasal lining fluid, we observed a strong interaction in the chemokine family,
including between chemokines and growth factors, in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants and
PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants (Figure 3c). In the serum, fewer interactions were observed, but still a
distinct pattern in the adaptive cytokine family in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants and PCR/IgG+ SARI participants (Figure 3d). Third, in a subset of participants, we explored the nasal immune
cellular profile in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants compared to healthy
controls. We observed a higher frequency of neutrophils and lower frequency of CD3+ T cells in the
nasal mucosa of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants compared to healthy
controls (Figure 4). Collectively, the findings demonstrate that the PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants
induced similar immunological pathways to PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants but that this was
distinct from PCR-/IgG- SARI participants. Taken together, these findings suggest that clinical
reclassification of COVID-19 status could be warranted.

PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants exhibit reduced propensity for bacterial colonisation
Due to the differential clinical management pathways experienced by the PCR-confirmed COVID-19
and PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants in the study, including beta-lactam antibiotic usage and steroid
treatment, we sought to determine the presence of other respiratory pathogens in NP/throat swabs.

Bacterial co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with adverse outcomes (21, 22). A total of 80
participants from the patient groups (from whom we had complete clinical and antibody data) were
tested for presence of respiratory pathogens using the fast-track diagnostics (FTD)-33 respiratory
panel. The median time from admission to NP/throat swab collection for the respiratory panel
testing was three days (IQR 1-5). Using the FTD-33 panel we identified 12 other respiratory
pathogens present in our patient population, in addition to SARS-CoV-2 and HIV (Figure 4a). Overall,
74% (59/80) of participants had one or more pathogen(s) (Figure 5a). Presence of bacterial
pathogens was common, identified in 74% (59/80), but viral pathogens (excluding HIV) was only
present in 14% (11/80) of participants (Figure 5a and S4a). The most common respiratory pathogen
across all study groups was Klebsiella pneumoniae (Figure S4b). A total of 27/44 of the participants
with a K. pneumoniae had received ceftriaxone or amoxicillin within 24 hours of admission,
suggesting that this was likely a hospital-acquired multidrug resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae. MDR K.
pneumoniae is known to be endemic at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (23). Furthermore, we
observed differences between PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants. The PCRconfirmed COVID-19 participants had lower prevalence rates of Staphylococcus aureus (3/38 [8%] vs.
6/24 [25%], p=0.018) and tended toward lower Streptococcus pneumoniae (8/38 [21%] vs. 10/24
[42%], p=0.071) than PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants (Figure 5b-c). These findings show that presence of
bacterial pathogens in the upper respiratory tract was very common in our hospitalised patient
cohort. They also show that PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients had lower proclivity for S. aureus and
S. pneumoniae colonisation than PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants, potentially impacted by increased use
of beta-lactam antibiotic usage in this study group.

Association of HIV co-infection with cytokine responses, respiratory bacterial prevalence and clinical
outcomes in COVID-19 patients
In our cohort, people living with HIV were distributed across the patient groups (Table 1). We
therefore explored the influence of HIV co-infection on the cytokine responses, presence of
respiratory pathogens, and mortality. We reclassified the PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants as COVID-19
and combined them with the PCR-confirmed COVID-19 to form a single COVID-19 patient group.
There were no statistically significant differences in the levels of cytokines in nasal lining fluid and
serum between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected COVID-19 participants (Figure 6a-b). Furthermore,
we did not observe increased frequency of respiratory pathogens in NP/throat swab nor higher
mortality (Fisher’s exact test, p=0.277) in HIV-infected compared to HIV-uninfected COVID-19
participants (Figure 5b-c and S4b). Together, in our cohort, we did not find evidence suggestive that

HIV co-infection in COVID-19 participants was associated with altered cytokine responses, increased
prevalence of respiratory pathogens nor increased mortality.

Discussion
We provide the first clinical and immunological analysis to our knowledge of suspected or confirmed
COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital in a low-income sub-Saharan African country. We identified
individuals with manifestations of COVID-19 who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR negative but IgG
positive that showed immunological profile analogous to PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants. This
was distinct from PCR-/IgG- SARI participants and healthy controls. The PCR-/IgG+ SARI subgroup
experienced poorer clinical outcomes compared to PCR-confirmed participants, potentially due to
later hospital presentation or failure to access effective treatment for COVID-19. In our cohort,
access to drugs such as dexamethasone in patients suspected of COVID-19 was determined by RTqPCR test positivity and not SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody status. Identification of this subgroup of SARI
patients highlights the importance for further optimisation of triage and clinical treatment pathways
in the era of COVID-19, especially in low-resource settings.

Low cost, effective and pragmatic interventions such as dexamethasone have been widely adopted
and incorporated into treatment pathways (24). The COVID-19 treatment guidelines recommend
against dexamethasone administration for patients who do not require supplemental oxygen (25)
but there are no specific recommendations for how COVID-19 should be diagnosed. The RECOVERY
dexamethasone trial (24) that showed efficacy in hospitalised COVID-19 patients, included patients
with “clinically suspected” or laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The PCR-/IgG+ SARI
subgroup could potentially fit into this “clinically suspected” COVID-19 classification. Empirical
antibiotics are recommended for severe COVID-19 patients if co-existing bacterial pneumonia
cannot be excluded (26). Consistent with this recommendation, there was increased beta-lactam
antibiotic usage in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants who demonstrated a lower prevalence of S.
pneumoniae and S. aureus colonisation. The PCR-/IgG+ participants did not access these
standardised clinical management strategies and may be at a disadvantage compared to PCRconfirmed patients, with whom they share analogous immunological profiles, potentially putting the
patients at increased risk of poor prognosis. Well conducted interventional trials are required to
determine if this important subgroup could benefit from diagnostic reclassification and treatment as
COVID-19.

Cytokine dysregulation is a hallmark of severe COVID-19 (27). Consistent with published studies (5,
6), we observed high concentrations of inflammation-associated cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-, IP10, IL-10, IL-1 and IL-1 in serum and nasal lining fluid from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients.
However, elevation of these cytokines was also observed in serum from non-COVID SARI
participants. Instead, the induction of the chemokine family in the nasal mucosa was distinctive to
severe COVID-19 and was distinct from systemic circulation. The predominance of the chemokine
family was in line with the infiltration of neutrophils in the upper airway observed in this cohort and
others (28, 29). A study that performed transcriptomic analysis on paired upper and lower
respiratory tract samples from two COVID-19 patients and showed very high congruency in the
majority of the cell types between the sites (28), suggesting a shared immune response between the
sites. Consistent with this suggestion, the chemokine-dominated signature and neutrophil
infiltration observed in the upper airway of severe COVID-19 patients in our study was similar to that
reported in the lower airway (15, 16, 30). Neutrophils promote inflammation and play a pathogenic
role in COVID-19 (31). Circulating neutrophils from severe COVID-19 patients show exaggerated
oxidative burst, NETosis and phagocytosis relative to healthy controls (32). Measurement of
dysregulated neutrophil function in the nose was not possible in this study, but presence of NETs has
been reported in the lungs of deceased severe COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) (33), where they are thought to drive severe pulmonary complications of COVID19. In ARDS patients, low levels of VEGF in the lower airway are a marker of acute lung injury (34),
and in our study, severe COVID-19 patients exhibited distinctively low concentrations of VEGF in
nasal lining fluid. Collectively, this suggests that the nasal mucosa could provide a snapshot of
immunological activity in the lung in patients with COVID-19. This warrants further investigation as
nasal sampling is well tolerated and more easily accessible than lower airway sampling.

Some of the major features of severe COVID-19 are lymphopenia and neutrophilia in the systemic
circulation (35, 36). As such, the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio has been shown to have prognostic
value, predicting those at high risk of severe disease or death (37). However, the mechanisms behind
lymphopenia and neutrophilia during COVID-19 are still not well understood. Interestingly, in our
study, concentrations of IL-3 and Flt-3L were distinctively altered in severe COVID-19 participants
compared to non-COVID-19 SARI participants. Specifically, in severe COVID-19 participants, IL-3 was
detected at very high levels in the nasal lining fluid, while Flt-3L was repressed in serum. IL-3 and Flt3L are key cytokines involved in haematopoiesis of leukocytes (38, 39). IL-3 induces expansion and
generation of myeloid cells (38, 39), while Flt-3L binds to Flt-3 and activates common lymphoid
progenitor cells to increase the number of lymphocytes (40, 41). Alterations in these cytokines in

mouse models are associated with dysregulated haematopoiesis and altered leukocyte cellularity
(39, 41). Therefore, it is plausible that high levels of IL-3 and repressed levels of Flt-3L could
contribute to the high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and altered leukocyte numbers observed in
severe COVID-19 patients.

Due to the high HIV prevalence in our setting, we were able to explore the impact of HIV co-infection
on COVID-19. While data from the United Kingdom and South Africa suggests an increased risk of
mortality in HIV-infected COVID-19 patients (42-44), a systematic review and data from the United
States did not demonstrate this association (45-47). In our cohort, we did not find statistically
significant differences in the cytokine responses, prevalence of respiratory pathogens nor mortality
between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected COVID-19 participants. The small sample size of this study
limits our ability to adjust for the multiple potential confounders that could impact on clinical
outcomes, including age, gender, co-morbidities, antiretroviral therapy status and HIV viral load.
Larger cohort studies with comprehensive immunological data and sufficient power to adjust for
multimorbid diseases are required to provide further clarity on this issue.

Despite the strengths of this study including use of an internationally recognised protocol with
standardised data collection tools, well-characterised clinical cohort and paired nasal and systemic
immune responses, our study had some limitations. Due to programmatic constraints, it was not
feasible to conduct longitudinal sampling among our participants to monitor recovery and response
to therapy. In addition, whilst the majority of participants were recruited within the first 72 hours of
admission, a proportion of our participants were recruited later in their hospital admission. Lack of
critical care facilities precluded universal recruitment and sampling in the most severe cases, and our
patient population may therefore not be entirely representative of all participants with SARS-CoV-2
induced SARI. Furthermore, we cannot exclude secondary bacterial infections as potential
contributors to increased mortality in the PCR-/IgG+ SARI participants, as we did not have access to
blood culture or autopsy results.

We have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a chemokine and neutrophil-dominated
profile in the nasal mucosa different from systemic circulation, and distinct from non-COVID-19 SARI.
We have identified a subgroup of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative IgG positive individuals with clinical and
immunological manifestations of COVID-19, who may benefit from standardised COVID-19 clinical
management protocols (including use of steroids and beta-lactam antibiotics). Further,
operationalisation of sensitive and specific antibody assays for SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection to support

clinical diagnosis needs to be considered in resource-limited settings. We recommend that
interventional trials should target this clinically important subgroup of patients to determine if
treatment pathways applied for PCR-confirmed COVID-19 can be implemented safely for PCR-/IgG+
SARI patients to improve clinical outcomes.

Methods
Study design and recruitment
We prospectively recruited patients using the tier one sampling strategy from the International
Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) Clinical Characterisation
Protocol (CCP) (48). Briefly, the CCP is a standardised protocol that enables data and biological
samples to be collected rapidly in a globally harmonised manner for any severe respiratory infection
of public health interest (48). Patients over 18 years old were approached for informed written
consent if they met inclusion criteria: severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) with suspected or
confirmed SARS-CoV-2. For patients who lacked capacity, assent was sought from a proxy as per our
ethical approvals. Subsequently, informed consent was obtained retrospectively from these
patients, where possible. Patients were excluded from recruitment if they or their proxy declined to
participate. We aimed to recruit within 72hrs of hospital admission. Nasopharyngeal airway,
nasosorption, nasal biopsy and peripheral blood samples were collected at the point of patient
recruitment (Figure S1). Thereafter, patients were followed up until hospital discharge or death.
All participants were recruited at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), Blantyre, Malawi. QECH
is a government hospital of 1000 beds, providing free inpatient medical care to the city of Blantyre
(population 800,264), and tertiary care to those referred from the Southern region (population
7,750,629, 2018). Most adults present directly to the hospital or are referred from community
healthcare facilities. After triage and testing in dedicated areas, patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2
were treated in a cohort ward, including a high dependency area. Additionally, patients with SARI
were screened for SARS-CoV-2 in two separate adult medical wards. Context-sensitive standard
operating procedures were used to treat SARS-CoV-2 as detailed in a separate publication (49).
Invasive mechanical ventilation, continuous positive airways pressure and high flow oxygen were not
available for SARS-CoV-2 at this institution during this period.

During the period November 2019 to October 2020, we recruited healthy participants with no acute
intercurrent or chronic illness as a healthy control group. All healthy participants, recruited
immediately before (November 2019-March 2020) and after (September 2020-October 2020) the

first peak in Malawi’s reported COVID case count (Figure 1a), were confirmed as seronegative for
HIV-infection and had no known medical conditions. We incorporated baseline samples for healthy
participants who had volunteered to participate in another study in this analysis (50).

The two study protocols were approved by the Malawi National Health Science Research Committee
(NHSRC, 20/02/2518 and 19/08/2246) and Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (study sponsor)
Research Ethics Committee (LSTM REC, 20/026 and 19/017). Patient and health participant samples
were anonymised at the point of sample collection by the research nurses using unique participant
identification barcodes. Study activities were monitored by the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust
Clinical Research programme (MLW)’s Clinical Research Support Unit and we complied with all
relevant ethical regulations.
SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostic testing
After collection, nasopharyngeal swabs in Universal Transport Medium (UTM) (Copan, Brescia, Italy)
were stored at 7°C and processed for 2019-nCOV RNA testing within 48 hours, using the CDC 2019nCoV RNA real time reverse transcriptase PCR diagnostic panel (Integrated DNA Technologies, Iowa,
USA) or the Da An-RT-PCR reagent set for 2019-nCoV RNA detection (Da An Gene Co., Ltd of Sun YatSen University, Guangdong, P.R. China). A cycle threshold (Ct) value of <40 was considered positive
for both assays based on CDC and Da An guidelines. Both assays utilize an internal control to identify
presence of human RNA (CDC - ribonuclease Protein, Da An internal control is not published). A
negative extraction control and a PCR no-template control were also performed with every test.

Respiratory fast track diagnostic panel
Aliquots of UTM were stored at -80°C and tested in batches using the FTDⓇ Respiratory Pathogens
33 kit (Fast track Diagnostics Ltd., Luxembourg) as per the manufacturer's instructions. In brief,
samples were extracted using the QIAamp UCP Pathogen Mini Kit (Qiagen Ltd., UK) for both DNA
and RNA. Each sample was then tested using the RT-qPCR based FTD panel. This panel includes the
following pathogens: parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 and 4; human coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43
and HKU1; human metapneumoviruses A/B; human rhinovirus; human respiratory syncytial viruses
A/B; human adenovirus; enterovirus; human parechovirus; human bocavirus; Pneumocystis jirovecii;
Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Haemophilus
influenzae B; Staphylococcus aureus; Moraxella catarrhalis; Bordetella spp.; Klebsiella pneumoniae;
Legionella pneumophila/longbeachae; Salmonella spp.; Haemophilus influenzae and internal control.
Ct values <40 were considered positive.

SARS-CoV-2 IgG Enzyme Linked-Immunosorbent Assay
Peripheral blood collected in serum separation tubes underwent centrifugation at 500g for 8 mins to
isolate serum. Serum was stored at -80°C. To measure SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, we used a
commercial enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting Spike (S2) and Nucleoprotein
(NP) from SARS-CoV-2 (Omega diagnostics, UK; ODL 150/10; Lot #103183). The assay was performed
as per the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, participant serum was diluted (1:200) in sample
diluent (150mM Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.2 with antimicrobial agent). The diluted samples, diluent
alone (negative control), manufacturer’s cut-off control and positive control were added at 100μl
per well to a plate pre-coated with S2 and NP. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 30
mins. After incubation, the plate was washed three times with a wash buffer (100mM Tris-buffered
saline with detergent, pH 7.2) using a plate washer (Asys Atlantis, Biochrom Ltd, UK). 100μl antihuman IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was then added to each well and incubated for 30
minutes at room temperature. After incubation, the plate was washed four times with a wash
buffer, and 100μl of TMB (3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine) Substrate (aqueous solution of TMB and
hydrogen peroxide) was added. The plate was incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature,
before addition of 100μl of Stop Solution (0.25M sulphuric acid). The optical density (OD) of each
well was read at 450nm in a microplate reader (BioTek ELx808, UK) within 10 minutes of adding the
Stop Solution. The ratio of OD in the test samples to the assay threshold control was calculated. The
assay interpretation was as follows; positive result (ratio ≥1) and negative result (ratio <1).

Flow cytometry analysis
For immunophenotyping, nasal cells were dislodged from curettes by pipetting and stained with an
antibody cocktail containing anti-human CD3 APC, anti-human CD14 PE-Cy7, anti-human CD66b PE,
anti-human CD19 Brilliant Violet 510, and anti-human CD45 Alexa Fluor 700 (all BioLegend,
UK). Samples were acquired on an LSR FORTESSA flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, UK) and analyzed
using Flowjo v10.5.3 (BD Biosciences, USA).

Luminex analysis of nasal lining fluid
Cytokines were eluted from stored nasosorption filters (Mucosal Diagnostics, Hunt Developments
(UK) Ltd., Midhurst, UK) using 200 μl of elution buffer (Millipore) by centrifugation at 1500g, then
the eluate was cleared by further centrifugation at 1595g. The samples were acquired on a MAGPIX
(Luminex, UK) using a 38-plex magnetic human cytokine kit (Millipore) and analyzed with xPONENT
software following the manufacturer’s instructions. The analytes included sCD40L, EGF,
Eotaxin/CCL11, FGF-2, Flt-3 ligand, Fractalkine, G-CSF, GM-CSF, GRO, IFN-α2, IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-

Statistical analysis
Clinical data were analysed using Stata V15.1 (StataCorp, Stata Statistical Software: Release 15,
College Station, Texas, USA). Categorical variables were compared using the Fisher’s exact test.
Continuous variables were tested for normality and appropriate statistical tests applied. Nonnormally distributed measurements are expressed as the median and were analysed by the KruskalWallis test. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Immunological and diagnostic
data and all figures were produced using R v.3.5.1 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria) and
GraphPad Prism v9.0.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA).

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Study recruitment timeline and SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. a) Suspected and SARS-CoV-2 RTqPCR confirmed COVID-19 patients recruited at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre (positive
(red) and negative (blue)) reported as cases/week compared to the national data (light gray).
National data includes SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR confirmed symptomatic and non-symptomatic COVID19. b) SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 2 (S2) and nucleoprotein (NP) IgG antibodies in PCR-negative and
positive individuals. Pre-pandemic historical samples (2016-2019) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 S2
and NP IgG antibodies. The data are reported as the ratio of OD in the test samples to the assay
threshold control. The horizontal bars represent the median and interquartile range (IQR). Data
were analysed using Kruskal-Wallis test (Historical samples, n=132; PCR-positive, n=38; PCRnegative, n=45). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; COVID-19, coronavirus disease of
2019; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IgG, immunoglobulin G; SARI, severe acute respiratory
infection.

Figure 2. Cytokine concentrations in nasal lining fluid and serum. a) Volcano plots showing
differential cytokine concentrations in nasal lining fluid and serum of PCR-confirmed COVID-19, PCR/IgG+ SARI and PCR-/IgG- SARI patients compared to health controls. The horizontal dotted line
represents a cut-off for statistical significance, while the vertical dotted line represents a cut-off
point for determining whether the levels of the cytokines were higher (right, red) or lower (left,
blue) compared to healthy controls. b) Venn diagrams showing similarities in cytokine
concentrations among the PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (green), PCR-/IgG+ SARI (turquoise) and PCR/IgG- SARI (purple) patients in nasal lining fluid and serum relative to healthy controls. Numbers in
Venn diagrams represent the number of cytokines that were either higher (red) or lower (blue) than
healthy controls common among the study groups. Data were analysed using empirical Bayes
moderated t-tests (Healthy controls, n=25; PCR-confirmed COVID-19; n=25; PCR-/IgG+ SARI, n=16;
PCR-/IgG- SARI, n=11). SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; COVID-19,
coronavirus disease of 2019; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IgG, immunoglobulin G; SARI, severe
acute respiratory infection

Figure 3. Nasal and serum cytokine profiles. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the 38 analytes
(37 cytokines and sCD40L) in a) nasal lining fluid and b) serum of healthy controls, PCR-confirmed
COVID-19, PCR-/IgG+ SARI and PCR-/IgG- SARI patients; showing similarity of nasal cytokine
responses between PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and PCR-/IgG+ SARI patients. Correlogram of cytokine
