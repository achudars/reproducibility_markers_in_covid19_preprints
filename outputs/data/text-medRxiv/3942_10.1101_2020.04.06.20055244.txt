Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) has spread to 181 countries and regions and leaving behind
1,133,788 confirmed cases and 62784 deaths worldwide. Countries with lower health services and
facilities like Pakistan are on great risk. Pakistan so far has 3,277 confirmed cases and 50 reported
deaths due to COVID19. Various mathematical models had presented to predict the global and
regional size of pandemic. However, all those models have certain limitation due to their dependence
on different variables and analyses are subject to potential bias. As each country has its own dimension
therefore country specific model are required to develop accurate estimate. Here we present a data
model to predict the size of COVID19 in Pakistan. In this mathematical data model, we used the time
sequence mean weighting (TSMW) to estimate the expected future number of COVID19 cases in
Pakistan until 29th April 2020. For future expected numbers of cases for long terms the data collection
have to be maintained in real time.

Value of the Data




This data will be helpful for Pakistan health authorities to prepare themselves to contain
COVID-19.
As Pakistan is very low in the Global Health Security (GHS) Index therefore they need to
utilised their resources in targeted ways and this data will be important for them to take
their strategic decisions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in their country.
Further our model can also use for monitoring and evaluation purpose of their own gown
efforts and precautionary measures.

Data description
The daily prevalence data of COVID-2019 from March 10, 2020 to April 1st, 2020 was collected from
the official website of COVID-19 Health Advisory Platform by Ministry of National Health Services
Regulations and Coordination, Pakistan http://covid.gov.pk/. 1 The Matlab was used to build
associated mat files and data was analysed by the time sequence mean weighting (TSMW) to predict
the future state of the confirmed cases of COVID19 and deaths in Pakistan until 29th April, 2020
(Figure 1). The analysis predicted the expected count of patients 77,905 with minimum 8285
confirmed cases of COVID-19 while expected deaths count of 1382 with lower limit of 45 until 29th
April 2020. Currently COVID19 has spread to 181 countries and regions, infected 1,133,788
individuals, and caused 62784 deaths worldwide.2 Countries with lower health services and facilities
like Pakistan are on great risk.3 Pakistan so far has 3,277 confirmed cases and 50 reported deaths
due to COVID19.
Experimental Design, Materials and Methods;
To derived this model, Let 𝑦𝑖 represents the number patients reported at 𝑖 𝑡ℎ day then we define
the ratio 𝑥𝑖 as
𝑦𝑖−1
𝑥𝑖 =
𝑦𝑖−1 + 𝑦𝑖
Where, 𝑖 − 1 represents the previous day and the current day is denoted by 𝑖. The 𝑥𝑖 is calculated
for all 𝜖 1, … , 𝑛 , where 𝑛 is the total number of days for which estimation is performed. The mean
of all 𝑥𝑖 is calculated as 4
∑𝑛𝑖=1 𝑥𝑖
𝜂=
𝑛

(2)

Let 𝑑𝑖 represents the total deaths and 𝑅𝑖 is the count of patients recovered until 𝑖 days. Then the
expected number of patients at day 1 was modelled as

𝑦1 = (𝑦0 − 𝑑0 ) ( − 1) − 𝑅0

We have assumed the dead patients were eliminated from community without any further virus
spreading capability. Similarly, the recovered patients were subtracted from the total number of
patients. Extending the Eq. [3] for 𝑦2 , … , 𝑦𝑛 as

1
𝑦2 = (𝑦1 − 𝑑1 ) ( − 1) − 𝑅1
𝜂
1
𝑦𝑛 = (𝑦𝑛−1 − 𝑑𝑛−1 ) ( − 1) − 𝑅𝑛−1
𝜂

(4)

Let 𝑃 be the total population of the sample space then the spread will grow until difference
between 𝑃 and 𝑦𝑛 is a positive integer defined as
𝑃 − 𝑦𝑛 > 0

(5)

When, 𝑃 − 𝑦𝑛 ≤ 0, 𝑛 is the expected number of days at which the whole population will be
impacted. The proposed model is different from standard normal distribution as it continuously
trains itself from the existing data to estimate the future state. Therefore, it can apply for future real
time data.
Lower bound: Let be the lower bound estimated from 𝑥𝑖 as
ζ = max(𝑥𝑖 ) ⩝ 𝑥𝑖 < 0.5
ζ = max(𝑥𝑖 ) −

∑(𝑥𝑖− 𝜂)2
⩝ 𝑥𝑖 ≥ 0.5
𝑖−1

(6)

We use 𝜂 = : ζ in Eq. [4] to find the lower bound on the estimated number of patients. The
convergence of lower bound remains very close to the actual data set until the same situation
prevails and subjected to change with new precautionary measures to contain pandemic.

strict precautionary measures due to its week health system its whole population will be on risk.3 Our
data shows that it will take roughly 90 days (1-July-2020) to affect the 95% population under the
constraint that there is no isolation policy implemented among the population.
