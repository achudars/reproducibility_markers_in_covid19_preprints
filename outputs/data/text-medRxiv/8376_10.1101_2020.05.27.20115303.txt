Abstract
Background
Cancer patients with COVID-19 disease have been reported to have double the case fatality rate of the
general population.
Materials and methods
A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv
was done for studies on cancer patients with COVID-19. Pooled proportions were calculated for
categorical variables. Odds ratio and forest plots were constructed for both primary and secondary
outcomes. The random-effects model was used to account for heterogeneity between studies.
Results
This systematic review of 31 studies and meta-analysis of 181,323 patients from 26 studies involving
23,736 cancer patients is the largest meta-analysis to the best of our knowledge assessing outcomes in
cancer patients affected by COVID-19. Our meta-analysis shows that cancer patients with COVID-19
have a higher likelihood of death (odds ratio, OR 2.54), which was largely driven by mortality among
patients in China. Cancer patients were more likely to be intubated, although ICU admission rates were
not statistically significant. Among cancer subtypes, the mortality was highest in hematological
malignancies (OR 2.43) followed by lung cancer (OR 1.8). There was no association between receipt of a
particular type of oncologic therapy and mortality. Our study showed that cancer patients affected by
COVID-19 are a decade older than the normal population and have a higher proportion of co-morbidities.
There was insufficient data to assess the association of COVID-directed therapy and survival outcomes in
cancer patients. Despite the heterogeneity of studies and inconsistencies in reported variables and
outcomes, these data could guide clinical practice and oncologic care during this unprecedented global
health pandemic.

Conclusion
Cancer patients with COVID-19 disease are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity. A more nuanced
understanding of the interaction between cancer-directed therapies and COVID-19-directed therapies is
needed. This will require uniform prospective recording of data, possibly in multi-institutional registry
databases.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel beta-coronavirus, and
is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)[1]. COVID-19 has caused an
unprecedented global health pandemic, with more than 5 million cases and 0.33 million deaths reported
worldwide (at the time of writing)[2]. Worldwide data suggest that there are around 18 million new
cancer patients every year, with around 43 million patients living with a cancer diagnosis within the past 5
years [3, 4]. A systematic review showed a pooled prevalence of cancer patients with COVID-19 to be
around 2.0%[5]. However, cancer patients have been reported to have double the case fatality rates as
compared to the general population[6]. The majority of cancer patients tend to be older, have multiple
preexisting comorbidities, and are immunosuppressed from numerous causes[7]. Moreover, owing to
oncologic interventions and follow-up thereof, time spent in the hospital as well as interaction with
healthcare providers may further increase the proclivity to develop infections. For instance, radiotherapy
requires multiple visits to the hospital due to its fractionated nature of the treatment and has been known
to deplete circulating and resident T lymphocyte populations[8]. Since the main pathophysiologic driver
of mortality in COVID-19 is the cytokine storm and macrophage activation, immunotherapy agents might
augment the heightened immune activation seen in severe COVID-19 disease[9],[10]. Lastly, many
chemotherapy and targeted therapies require high dose steroid premedication or therapy and need hospital
visits for infusion, both of which predispose to infections.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a conundrum of problems specific to cancer patients such as
increasing need for intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and ventilatory support; redeployment of
resources resulting in delayed cancer care; suspension of clinical trials limiting availability of lifesaving
therapies; delay in diagnostic and screening programs; modification of standardized protocols that might
compromise cancer control; and reduced willingness among cancer patients to visit hospitals owing to the

fear of infection[11, 12]. The majority of published reports on cancer patients with COVID-19 have been
single institutional retrospective studies with selective reporting of outcomes. There remain a multitude of
unanswered questions regarding the actual of impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients such as differences
in survival outcomes in patients with active cancer and cancer survivors; the impact of various oncologic
therapies; difference in outcomes in subtypes of cancer; along with the safety and interaction of COVID19-directed therapy with cancer-directed therapy. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis
to interrogate and summarize the lessons learned from the clinical reports on various malignancies that
have reported mortality outcomes in cancer patients affected by COVID-19.
Methods:
This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations[13]. The complete search protocol is provided
in Supplement 4. Institutional review board approval was not required for this study since no patient
identifiers were disclosed. The systematic review has been registered in the PROSPERO database
(CRD42020186671).
Data sources
A systematic electronic search was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Google
Scholar, and MedRxiv databases to identify studies reporting outcomes on cancer patients with COVID19 from December 1, 2019 to May 23, 2020. The Medical Subject Heading terms used for the search have
been provided in Supplement 5. An independent review of the abstracts and full paper articles was
performed by 2 reviewers (BV and VC). The duplicates were removed and the titles of articles were then
evaluated. Abstracts found to be relevant to the topic of interest were shortlisted. Full-length papers of the
shortlisted articles were assessed for the eligibility criteria. The articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria
were shortlisted for final systematic review. The included study references were cross-searched for
additional studies. ClinicalTrials.gov, World health organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Cochrane COVID registry were assessed for completed and ongoing

clinical trials related to cancer patients with COVID-19. The articles were reviewed independently by two
authors (BV and VC) and any disagreement was resolved by consensus with a third author (SK). Reasons
for excluding studies were documented.
Study selection
The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) studies reporting mortality outcomes in cancer patients with
SARS-CoV-2 infection; 2) all types of studies (including randomized controlled trials (RCTs),
prospective, retrospective and case series) comprising more than 10 patients; and 3) patients ≥ 18 years of
age.
Exclusion criteria were: 1) Studies that did not report mortality outcomes in cancer patients with SARSCoV-2 infection; and 2) pre-clinical studies, epidemiological studies, autopsy series, incidence and
prevalence studies, or news reports.
Data extraction and quality assessment:
The data was extracted by two authors independently into pre-defined forms. The following data was
extracted from the studies: First author, mean age, study design, number of patients, gender,
comorbidities, COVID-19-directed treatment, cancer subtypes, different treatments received, number of
cancer patients and cancer survivors with corresponding mortality outcomes, ICU admissions, DNR/DNI
numbers, need for mechanical ventilation, and progression to severe disease. Data for both cancer and
non-cancer patients (for available studies) were extracted separately.
Data synthesis
Percentages for categorical variables and medians with interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables
were presented. Pooled rates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for individual arms.
Odds ratios (OR) comparing cancer patients with non-cancer control patients was reported with 95% CI
and p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The random-effects model described by
DerSimonian and Laird was used for analysis. Corresponding forest plots were constructed for both
primary and secondary outcomes. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the inconsistency index (I2-

statistic) with values of 0-30%, 31%-60%, 61%-75% and 76%-100% indicating low, moderate,
substantial and considerable heterogeneity, respectively. All analyses were performed using statistical
software Open Meta analyst (CEBM, Brown University, Rhode Island, USA) and Review Manager
Version 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Sub-group analyses were performed
for the following, when data was available: 1) subtypes of cancer; 2) type of cancer-directed therapy; 3)
patients with active cancer versus cancer survivors; and 4) mortality outcome based on geographic
location.

Results:
Study search and study characteristics
The literature search resulted in 4,854 articles, of which 92 articles underwent full review and 31 were
included in the final analysis (Figure 1). Among the studies included for systematic review, 26 were
retrospective studies (Supplementary data 1) and 5 are ongoing clinical trials on cancer patients with no
reported outcomes at the time of conducting this meta-analysis (Supplementary data 2). The data from
26 studies were included in the meta-analysis; 17 studies had multiple cancer types and 9 studies
pertained to a single cancer type. Ten studies were performed in China, 6 in the United States, 3 in the
United Kingdom, 3 in Italy, and 2 each in Spain and France.
Patient characteristics
There were 23,736 cancer patients (mean age 65.1 ± 8.02 years) versus 157,587 non-cancer patients (50.3
± 11.9 years). The proportion of males were 52.6% (n=1,413) versus 52.9% (n=9,067), respectively. The
proportion of comorbidities was higher in the cancer arm with the prevalence of smoking being 31.1%;
hypertension 46.6%; diabetes mellitus 20.4%; cardiac disease 34.9%; cerebrovascular disease 9.1%;
chronic liver disease 9.2 %; chronic kidney disease 10.8%; and chronic lung disease 14.7% compared to
the non-cancer arm with prevalence of smoking being 7.3%; hypertension 24.2%; diabetes mellitus 5.4%;

cardiac disease 7.3%; cerebrovascular disease 3.9%; chronic liver disease 6.5 %; and chronic kidney
disease 4.1%.The demographics are provided in Supplementary data 3.
Primary outcomes reported in the studies
Twenty-six studies provided data on cancer patient mortality. The pooled all-cause in-hospital mortality
rate was 19.2% (95% CI: 14.9% - 23.5%) (n=23,736) with a median follow up duration of 45 days (range
of 21-104 days). Comparing the mortality between the cancer and non-cancer patients, 10 studies (n =
165,980) provided such data, with a pooled rate of 16.6% (95% CI: 10.4% - 22.8%) and 5.4% (95% CI:
4.1% - 6.7%), respectively (odds ratio (OR) 2.54, 95% CI: 1.47 – 4.42, I2 = 92%, p = 0.00009). Further
sub-group analysis performed on studies with sample size over 100 confirmed the aforementioned
findings (OR 2.17, 95% CI: 1.16 – 4.07, I2 = 95%, p = 0.02).
In subgroup analysis stratifying based on geographical location, cancer patients in China had higher
mortality than non-cancer patients (OR 6.62, 95% CI: 2.68 – 16.34, I2 = 59%, p = 0.001), but this trend
was not observed in the United States (OR 1.56, 95% CI: 0.62 –3.96, I2 = 95%, p = 0.35) or Europe (OR
1.69, 95% CI: 0.81 – 3.52, I2 = 89%, p = 0.161).
Seventeen studies reported ICU admission rates in cancer patients, with a pooled ICU admission rate of
12.6% (95% CI: 8.9%-16.3%) (n = 1,834). When evaluating the 3 studies (n = 11,587) which also
provided information on the non-cancer population, the pooled ICU admission rates in the respective
cohorts were 12.6% (95% CI: 4.7% - 20.5%) and 7.1% (95% CI: 5.1% - 9.1%), with no significant
difference between the two groups (OR 2.18, 95% CI: 0.78 – 6.04, I2 = 85%, p = 0.13).
Fifteen studies reported the need for mechanical ventilation in cancer patients, with a pooled intubation
rate of 10.9% (95% CI: 6.8% - 15.0%) (n = 1,813). When examining the 3 studies (n = 6,353) which also
provided information on non-cancer cases, the pooled rates were 10.8% (95% CI: 7.9% - 13.7%) and
4.9% (95% CI: 2% - 7.8%), respectively (OR 2.43, 95% CI: 1.43-3.88, I2 = 19%, p = 0.0002).

Cancer subtype specific outcomes
The most common type of cancer reported among COVID-19 patients were hematological malignancies
with a reported pooled proportion of 34.3% (95% CI: 7.4% - 61.3%) (n=2,316). This was followed by
breast cancers at 29.2% (95% CI: 6.1% - 51.40%) (n=1,945), lung cancers 23.7% (95% CI: 2.0% 45.3%) (n=2,051), gastrointestinal malignancies 15.2% (95% CI: 11.7% - 18.7%) (n=2643), prostate
cancers 11.1% (95% CI: 5.7% - 16.6%) (n=2039), gynecological cancers 9.6% (95% CI: 5.7% - 13.5%)
(n=1077), head and neck cancers 3.7% (95% CI: 2.4% - 5.0%) (n=883), brain tumors 3% (95% CI: 0.8%
- 5.3%) (n=465), and other cancers 2.63% (95% CI: 0.7% - 5.19%) (n=2033). Hematological
malignancies had the highest pooled all-cause in-hospital mortality rate of 33.1% (95% CI: 16.1-50.1%)
(n=266) followed by lung cancer at 28% (95% CI: 18.8-37.1%) (n=161), gastrointestinal malignancies at
19.8% (95% CI: 6.3-33.3%) (n=99), and breast cancer at 10.9% (95% CI: 3.5%-18.3%) (n=193). The
numbers reported in the other malignancies were insufficient to perform a subset analysis.
We performed an additional subgroup analysis for mortality by stratifying hematological malignancies vs.
other malignancies, lung vs. other malignancies, gastrointestinal malignancies vs. other and breast vs.
other malignancies. Hematological malignancies had the highest OR of death (2.39, 95% CI: 1.17 – 4.87,
I2 = 49%, p = 0.02) (n=878) followed by lung cancer (1.83, 95% CI: 1.00 – 3.37, I2 = 19%, p = 0.05)
(n=646), which were both statistically significant; the remainder were not (p>0.05 for both).
Treatment related outcomes
The most common treatment modality reported in cancer patients affected with COVID-19 was
chemotherapy (pooled rate of 30.3%, 95% CI: 22.3%-37.8%) (n=1,166) followed by hormonal therapy
(17.4%, 95% CI: 6.9%-27.9%) (n=332), targeted therapy 15.4% (95% CI: 9.5%-21.2%) (n=837),
radiotherapy 13.8% (95% CI: 7%-20.7%) (n=790), immunotherapy 9.1% (95% CI: 5.2%-12.9%)
(n=1345) and surgery 7.3% (95% CI: 5.2%-9.4%) (n=776). Subgroup analysis of treatment modalities
showed no significant differences in mortality associated with radiotherapy (OR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.36 –

1.42, I2 = 0%, p = 0.34) (n=335), chemotherapy (OR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.40 – 1.39, I2 = 0%, p = 0.35)
(n=386), immunotherapy (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 0.65 – 4.00, I2 = 30%, p = 0.31) (n=467) and targeted
therapy (OR 2.57, 95% CI: 0.93 – 7.09, I2 = 0%, p = 0.07) (n=181). The number of reported patients
having undergone hormonal therapy and surgery were not adequate for subgroup analysis.
Cancer survivors
The definition of cancer survivors was defined variably by different studies. Wang et al. defined cancer
survivors as patients treated for cancer within the past 5 years without any active disease [14]. Zhang et
al. defined cancer survivors as patients who had not received cancer-directed therapy in the in the past one
month[15]. Liang et al. defined cancer survivors as patients who had not received cancer-directed therapy
recently[16]. Patients receiving active cancer-directed therapy were at higher risk of developing severe
disease compared to patients classified as cancer survivors with OR 2.58 (95% CI: 1.35 – 4.95, I2 = 0%, p
= 0.004) (n=366).
Ongoing cancer-directed therapy clinical trials in COVID-19 patients
There are currently only 5 active ongoing clinical trials that are assessing interventions specific to cancer
patients. This represents only 0.7% of all the ongoing treatment based studies[17]. The interventions
being assessed include the chloroquine analog (GNS561), an anti PD-1 antibody (nivolumab); an antiinterleukin-6 receptor (tocilizumab); an anti-interleukin-8 (BMS-986253), a SUMOylation inhibitor
(TAK-981), and azithromycin. The chloroquine analog and azithromycin are being tested as prophylactic
agents whereas the others are being evaluated as therapeutic agents (supplementary data 2).
Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis of 181,323 patients from 26 studies involving 23,736 cancer
patients is the largest meta-analysis to the best of our knowledge assessing outcomes in cancer patients
affected by COVID-19. Our meta-analysis shows that cancer patients with COVID-19 have an increased

likelihood of death compared to non-cancer COVID-19 patients, which was particularly driven by
patients in China. Cancer patients were more likely to be intubated than non-cancer patients but ICU
admission rates were not statistically significant between the two groups. Hematological malignancies
were associated with the highest mortality, followed by lung cancer. There was no association between
receipt of a particular type of oncologic therapy and mortality.
Some of our findings are rather intuitive; nonetheless, having objective data to confirm our suspicions is
helpful in making evidence-based recommendations for deployment of limited resources within
healthcare environments. For instance, the higher mortality in patients with hematological malignancies
could be readily explained by the greater degree of immunosuppression utilized in the treatment of these
patients, even in the absence of bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. The underlying
immunosuppressive microenvironment due to dysfunctional immune cell production is a fundamental
attribute of the malignancies that drives their pathogenesis[18]. Faced with an added insult (e.g. COVID19), these patients may not have adequate immune reserves to combat the infection. In a flow cytometric
analysis of 522 patients from China, T-cell lymphopenia was an important prognostic factor for mortality
in COVID-19 patients[19]. The OpenSAFELY Collaborative from United Kingdom published one of the
largest epidemiological reports, stating that the hazard ratio (HR) of death in patients with hematological
malignancies was 3.52 (2.41-5.14) as compared to 1.56 (1.29-1.89) for solid tumors[7].
Our investigation did not show any clear association between treatment modality and mortality, which is
reassuring. There have been concerns regarding an association between immune checkpoint inhibitors and
the hyperactive phase of COVID-19 infection. In an analysis of 67 consecutive lung cancer patients with
COVID-19 treated with PD-1 blockade, no significant association was found between the timing of PD-1
blockade and COVID-19 severity as well as mortality[9]. We observed a numerical increase in the odds
of death from targeted therapy and chemotherapy, but it was not statistically significant. However, there
was a lack of information regarding the particular agent/class; hence, we were not able to perform

corresponding subgroup analyses. Of note, no association was found between radiation delivery and
COVID-19. Radiation is known to deplete the circulating as well as resident lymphocyte subpopulations
and this lymphopenia is known to last months to years[8]. However, these results should also be
interpreted with caution in view of the lack of robust numbers in the groups analyzed.
A few caveats about our analysis are noteworthy. The pooled mortality rates in such a meta-analysis may
be misleading given that cancer patients are often older and have more comorbidities. Hence, the actual
magnitude of mortality in cancer patients with COVID-19 using age-matched cohorts might be lower than
reported in these studies. Additionally, mortality differences seemed to be driven by Chinese patients,
which could imply unforeseen COVID-19-treatment-related effects or genetic polymorphisms as
compared to Western populations. Within Western populations, the findings of our analysis may still help
inform how resources are redeployed within oncology units or cancer centers. For instance, the greater
mortality among patients with hematological malignancies may argue for marshalling additional
resources to these units in a cancer center. It may also support a conscious decision to delay highly
immunosuppressive treatment such as bone marrow transplantation, stem cell transplantation or CAR-T
cell therapy. However, modifying standard therapeutic protocols to accommodate predicted disparities in
mortality engenders additional risks in terms of disease progression. Clearly, such modifications should
be guided by a nuanced risk-benefit analysis based on the best available data.
Limitations of the study
As is customary with such data, the results should be interpreted cautiously, as the studies were
heterogeneous and sample sizes were variable. The majority of studies were single-institutional series
with selective reporting of data and high publication bias. The contribution of age, co-morbidities, preexisting immunodeficiency, and polypharmacy to mortality outcomes in cancer patients with COVID-19
remain difficult to assess. Furthermore, none of the studies reported mortality outcomes in relation to
COVID-19-directed therapy. Accordingly, the potential interactions between cancer-directed therapy and

COVID-19-directed therapy were not documented in any of the studies[20]. Taken together, these
attributes make the conclusions arising from our meta-analysis predominately hypothesis-generating
rather than definitive and/or conclusive. However, at this point in time, these studies remain the core of
the limited evidence on this topic to date, and higher quality of studies in the future may allow for
corresponding improvements to future meta-analyses.
Implications for clinical practice
Cancer patients with COVID-19 have a higher probability of severe disease, increased ventilatory
requirements, and mortality compared to the general population. Patients with hematological
malignancies and lung cancer are at increased risk of death compared to other subtypes of cancer. There is
a need for prospective registration of cancer patients with COVID-19 in registry initiatives like the UK
Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP) and ASCO Survey on COVID-19 in Oncology
Registry (ASCO Registry) for better understanding of the impact of cancer-directed therapies as well as
COVID-directed therapies on mortality and morbidity outcomes[21].
