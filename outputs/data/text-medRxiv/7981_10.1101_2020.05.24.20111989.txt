Abstract
We propose a new epidemic model (SuEIR) for forecasting the spread of COVID-19, including
numbers of confirmed and fatality cases at national and state levels in the United States.
Specifically, the SuEIR model is a variant of the SEIR model by taking into account the
untested/unreported cases of COVID-19, and trained by machine learning algorithms based on the
reported historical data. Besides providing basic projections for confirmed and fatality cases, the
proposed SuEIR model is also able to predict the peak date of active cases, and estimate the basic
reproduction number (R0 ). In particular, the forecasts based on our model suggest that the peak
date of the US, New York state, and California state are 06/01/2020, 05/10/2020, and 07/01/2020
respectively. In addition, the estimated R0 of the US, New York state, and California state are 2.5,
3.6 and 2.2 respectively. The prediction results for all states in the US can be found on our project
website: https://covid19.uclaml.org, which are updated on a weekly basis, and have been
adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for COVID-19 death forecasts
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html).

Introduction

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Chan et al., 2020; WHO, 2020b), has emerged into a global
pandemic and lead to 233, 839 death toll in the world as of April 30, 2020 (WHO, 2020a). The
treatments for COVID-19 are still under investigation and in early stages. There are no specific
vaccines or medicines that showed significant effectiveness on COVID-19 so far. As a consequence,

one of the best ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the short term is to follow the mitigation
strategies such as social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. For example, the state of California
in the US has issued mandatory stay-at-home order on March 19, shutting down all non-essential
businesses. Only essential services, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, delivery restaurants, have
remained open, and residents who need to leave home to take part in essential activities are advised
to practice social distancing.
With the increasing availability of public data on COVID-19, more and more researches (Flaxman
et al., 2020; Bendavid et al., 2020; Sutton et al., 2020; Altieri et al., 2020; Bertozzi et al., 2020;
Murray et al., 2020) have been carried out to understand and prevent the spread of COVID-19
from different aspects. Among them, one important research direction is to model and forecast
the spread of COVID-19, such as predicting the peak of the active cases on the virus and the size
of the coronavirus outbreak. Such results can help government agencies better understand the
overall impact of the disease and also facilitate policy makers in terms of pandemic preparedness
and response such as allocating the medical resources.
One widely used method for modeling the spread of infectious disease is to use epidemic models
such as Susceptible-Infected-Resistant (SIR) (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) and SusceptibleExposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) (Hethcote, 2000). Such epidemic models are quite useful in
describing the dynamics of transmission and are well-suited for predicting the peak of active cases
on the virus. From the decision-making perspective, the peak prediction is able to forewarn the
health system when to expect a surge in cases. Furthermore, the reproduction number (Fraser et al.,
2009) estimated by the epidemic model can be directly used to measure the effectiveness of the
intervention strategies such as social distancing and quarantine.
Several recent work used epidemic models such as the SIR and SEIR models (Imai et al., 2020;
Li et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 2020; Kucharski et al., 2020; Read et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Ferguson
et al., 2020) to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in different regions and were able to forecast
the size and severity of such epidemic outbreak. Some other work (Chinazzi et al., 2020; Kraemer
et al., 2020; Dandekar and Barbastathis, 2020) also applied these epidemic models to study the
role of quarantine controls such as travel restrictions in the spread of COVID-19. Most of the
aforementioned studies consider classical epidemic models, e.g., the SIR and SEIR models, and
base their analyses on the public reported data. However, it is often the case that the number of
publicly reported cases (including confirmed cases and recovered cases) are much less than their real
numbers as many infectious cases have not been tested due to test capability and asymptomatic
patients, or even possibly under-reporting (Li et al., 2020b). As a result, classical epidemic models
such as SIR and SEIR cannot accurately characterize the epidemic evolution of COVID-19 without
taking such unreported cases into consideration. In addition, most existing work is focused on the
nation-wide prediction. Nevertheless, it is also very important and beneficial to provide state and
county level forecasts to assist local public health departments and governments to prevent the
spread of COVID-19.
The goal of this paper is to make good use of the current public data on COVID-19 to better
understand the spread of the coronavirus and to facilitate informed decisions by policy makers. In
order to achieve this goal, we develop a new epidemic model, called the SuEIR model, to forecast the
active cases and deaths of COVID-19 by taking the untested/unreported cases into consideration.
In addition, we use machine learning based methods to train our model, which enables us to train
the model efficiently. Based on the proposed model, we are able to make accurate predictions on the

numbers of confirmed cases and fatality cases for nation, states and and counties. Moreover, our
model can also predict the peak dates of active cases and estimate the basic reproduction number
(R0 ) of different states in the US.

1.1

The SIR and SEIR Models

In this subsection, we briefly introduce two classical epidemic models, i.e., the SIR (Kermack and
McKendrick, 1927) and SEIR models (Hethcote, 2000), which have been adopted in many previous
work to study the epidemic outbreaks such as SARS (Fang et al., 2006; Saito et al., 2013; Smirnova
et al., 2019) and the ongoing COVID-19 (Read et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020).
The SIR model. The SIR model is an epidemic model that shows the change of infection rate over
time. More specifically, it characterizes the dynamic interplay among the susceptible individuals
(S), infectious individuals (I) and removed individuals (R) (including recovered and deceased) in
a certain place. In the SIR model, the susceptible individuals may become infectious individuals
over time, which depends on the spread rate of the virus, often called the contact rate. Recovered
individuals are assumed to be immune to the virus and thus cannot become susceptible again. To
characterize this dynamics, we use St , It , Rt to represent the number of susceptible, infectious, and
removed individuals at time t, respectively. Suppose that the total population in a certain area is
fixed as N , then the evolving equations of the above variables over time are defined as follows:
dSt
βIt St
=−
,
dt
N

dIt
βIt St
=
− γIt ,
dt
N

dRt
= γIt ,
dt

where β is the contact rate between the susceptible and infectious groups, and γ is the transition
rate between the infectious and removed groups. The above ordinary differential equations indicate
that at every time unit the total number of susceptible individuals will decrease by a quantity
−βIt St /N , which will transit into the infectious group. Apart from the increase from the transition
of susceptible individuals, the size of the infectious group will also decrease by a factor of γ.
The SEIR model. For many diseases, there is often an incubation period during which individuals
who have been exposed to the virus may not be as contagious as the infectious individuals. Therefore,
it is necessary to separately model these cases as the “Exposed” group, and this gives rise to the
SEIR model. The dynamics of the SEIR model introduces a new compartment Et , which models the
number of individuals that are exposed to the disease but have not developed obvious symptoms.
Among all the exposed cases, there are only a σ fraction of people who will develop observable
symptoms in a time unit. Therefore, the dynamic of this model can be defined by the following
ordinary differential equations:
dSt
βIt St
=−
,
dt
N

dEt
βIt St
=
− σEt ,
dt
N

dIt
= σEt − γIt ,
dt

dRt
= γIt .
dt

Compared with the SIR model, the SEIR model has more elaborated model parameters. The
parameters σ, β and γ can be learned from the reported data.
Reproduction number. An important quantity to characterize the dynamic of a pandemic is the
basic reproduction number R0 , which is the expected number of cases directly generated by one
case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection (Fraser et al., 2009). The

basic reproduction number in the SIR and SEIR models can be computed as R0 = β/γ.

Methods

In this section, we propose a new epidemic model and a machine learning method to train this
model.

2.1

The SuEIR Model

It is observed that COVID-19 has an incubation period ranging from 2 to 14 days (Lauer et al.,
2020). It has also been observed that individuals who have been exposed to the coronavirus can also
infect the susceptible group during this period. In addition, it is often the case that the number of
reported cases (including confirmed cases and recovered cases) are less than their real numbers as
many exposed cases have not been tested, which will not pass to the next compartment. However,
such important factors cannot be characterized by the classical epidemic models such as the SIR
and SEIR models. We also observe that directly applying SIR or SEIR model to fit the reported
data will lead to unreasonable predictions. Therefore, we proposed a new epidemic model that
takes the untested/unreported cases as well as the “silent spreaders” into consideration. We call our
model the SuEIR model and it is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Illustration of the SuEIR model. Solid lines represent the transitions of individuals and
dashed lines represent the routes of infection.
In particular, the compartment Exposed in our model is considered as the individuals that have
already been infected and have not been tested. Therefore, they also have the capability to infect the
susceptible individuals. Moreover, some of such individuals can receive a test and be further passed
to the Infectious compartment (as well as reported to the public), while the others will recover but
not appear in the publicly reported cases. Therefore, we introduce a new parameter 0 < µ < 1
in the evolution dynamics of It to characterize the ratio of the exposed cases that are confirmed
and reported to the public, which we call it the discovery rate. This discovery rate reflects the
unreported/undiscovered cases, which is an important latent factor in the dynamics of the epidemic
model. As a result, we propose to use the following ordinary differential equations to describe our

2.2

Parameter Learning for the SuEIR Model

In this subsection, we will introduce our proposed machine learning method for training the SuEIR
model. In addition, we will also present the detailed configurations used in our experiments.
Model training. As aforementioned in this paper, our model can be described by the ODE (1),
which is determined by the parameters θ = (β, σ, γ, µ). In particular, given the model parameters θ
and initial quantities S0 , E0 , I0 , and R0 , we can compute the number of individuals in each group

(i.e., S, E, I, and R) at time t, denoted by Sbt , E

ODE solvers onto the ODE (1). Then we propose to learn the model parameter θb = (β,

where I = {It }Tt=1 , R = {Rt }Tt=1 with It and Rt denote the reported numbers of infected cases and
removed cases (including both recovered cases and fatality cases) at time t (i.e., date), and p is
the smoothing parameter used to ensure numerical stability. Note that given S0 , E0 , I0 and R0 , Ibt
bt can be described as differentiable functions of the parameter θ. Then the model parameter
and R
θb = argminθ L(θ; I, R) can be learnt by applying standard gradient based optimizer (e.g., BFGS)
onto the loss function (2) under the constraint that β, σ, γ, µ ∈ [0, 1].
Estimation of the number of removed cases Rt . Note that It and Rt in our model determine
the number of “current” infectious cases (a.k.a., active cases) and the removed cases, i.e., the sum
of recovered and fatality cases, respectively. However, most of the reported data only include the
number of confirmed cases, i.e., sum of infected cases and removed cases It + Rt . In order to train
the model, we need to get It and Rt separately. In addition, the SuEIR model can only predict
the number of removed cases, while in many cases people are more interested in the number of
fatality cases. Therefore, in order to enable the training of the SuEIR model, as well as provide the

predictions for the number of fatality cases, we have to: (1) estimate the number of removed cases;
(2) determine the number of active cases in the reported data by subtracting the estimated number
of removed cases. In order to do so, we propose to use the following exponential function to model
the ratio between the daily increased fatality cases and the removed cases,
r(t) = a exp(−bt),

where a, b > 0 are parameters controlling the shape of the exponential function and t denotes the
number of days since the starting date. In order to demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluate the
approximation error based on the reported data in four countries: US, China, France, and Italy,
which have separately reported fatality and recovered cases. More specifically, given parameters a, b
and the number of fatality cases, we are able to estimate the corresponding number of removed cases.
Then the optimal parameters a and b are obtained by minimizing the MSE between the reported
number of removed cases and the estimated one on different dates. The results are displayed in
Figure 2, which clearly shows that the exponential functions can well describe the ratio between the
daily increased numbers of fatality and removed cases. For each state and county in the US, we try
several different choices of a and b around the optimal ones we obtained for the US, and pick the
one with the smallest validation error.

days as the validation set, while treating the remaining as the training set. For example, suppose
we have the data up to May 10, 2020, the data after May 3, 2020 will be used as the validation
set, and the data up to May 3, 2020 will be used as the training set. We then do a grid search
on different combinations of N0 and E0 and train different models on the training set accordingly.
Finally, we choose the combination of N0 and E0 with the smallest validation loss (evaluated using
the loss function (2)) along with the best model parameters (i.e., β, γ, σ, µ) to build the SuEIR
model for prediction.

Confidence Interval

Given the initial quantities S0 , E0 , I0 , R0 , we can solve the optimization problem in (2) to obtain

the model parameter θb = (β,

 (Ma, 2020). More specifically, for a valid
model parameter θ, we can compute the loss L θ in (2), and construct the test statistic as

b , which represents the loglikelihood ratio between the point estimator θb
T θ = 2T L θ − L(θ)
and θ. Note that θ contains four free parameters
(i.e., β, σ, γ and µ) while θb is fixed. By Wilks’s

Theorem (Wilks, 1938),
we know that T θ follows χ24 distribution asymptotically. As a result, we

can compare T θ with the (1 − α) quantile of the χ24 distribution and determine whether θ is in
the confidence interval or not. In our experiment, we apply grid search on both sides of the point
estimator θb to find the boundary of the confidence interval.

2.4

Computation of the Basic Reproduction Number R0

We can also compute the basic reproduction number based on our proposed SuEIR model. Note that
our model has a different dynamics from that of SIR and SEIR models. Thus we cannot directly
apply the standard computation method of R0 for the SIR or SEIR model to compute such number.
Instead, we use the method proposed in Heffernan et al. (2005) to calculate R0 based on the nextgeneration matrix. In specific, let x = (x1 , . . . , x4 )> with xi being the number of infected individuals
in the compartment i. Then we denote by function Fi (x) the rate of new infections in compartment
i, and denote by Vi− (x) and Vi+ (x) the rate of individuals transferred out of the compartment i
and the rate of individuals transferred into the compartment i by all other means respectively. Let
Vi (x) = Vi− (x) − Vi+ (x), F (x) = (F1 (x), . . . , F4 (x))> and V (x) = (V1 (x), . . . , V4 (x))> . The ODE

Results

In this section, we present the forecast results, including confirmed cases and deaths, peak date and
reproduction number, by our method.
Data collection. We use the data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science
and Engineering2 (Dong et al., 2020) to train our model for national-level forecasts. To train the
state-level models, we use the data from The New York Times3 . In addition, we use the data from
03/22/2020 (most states have already issued the stay-at-home order by this date) to 05/10/2020 to
train our models. More specifically, we use the reported data from 03/22/2020 to 05/03/2020 to
train the SuEIR model while using the data from 05/04/2020 to 05/10/2020 for validation.
Prediction Results. For the interest of space, we present the forecast results of our models for
the US and states with more than 40, 000 total cases, including New York, New Jersey, Illinois,
Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Maryland. For more forecast results,
please refer to our forecast website https://covid19.uclaml.org
Table 1 summarizes the projected death and its corresponding 95% confidence interval in the
aforementioned regions from 05/12/2020 to 05/18/2020. The results show that our predictions are
very close to the reported data, which suggests that our method performs very well in terms of the
death forecasts. We also show the long term death forecasts by our method in Table 2. Our results
suggest that by June 30, the projected death for the US is 123.4×103 (95% CI 109.7×103 -140.4×103 ).
We demonstrate the projected number of confirmed cases by our approach along with its 95%
confidence interval in Table 3. The results suggest that our predictions in terms of the number

of confirmed cases are also reasonably accurate. For example, the reported number of confirmed
cases in the US on 05/18/2020 is 1508 × 103 , and our projected number is 1496 × 103 (95% CI
1443 × 103 -1572 × 103 ), which underestimates 12 × 103 cases. In addition, the projected number
of long term confirmed case is presented in Table 4. It shows that by 06/30/2020, the projected
number of confirmed cases for the US is 1900 × 103 (95% CI 1638 × 103 -2362 × 103 ).
Our method can also forecast the peak date in different regions, i.e., the date with the largest
number of active cases, as shown in Table 5. It can be seen that the projected peak date of the
US is 06/01/2020, New York state is 05/10/2020, New Jersey is 05/19/2020, Illinois is 06/07/2020,

Table 6 summarizes the basic reproduction number R0 estimated by (4) in different regions,
which characterizes the spread of the virus at the beginning of the epidemic. The results vary for
different states, which are consistent with the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in these regions
since mid March. For example the R0 values of the states in the Northeastern US (e.g., NY: 3.6,
NJ: 4.5, MA:4.2) are significantly higher than those of other states (e.g. CA: 2.2, MI: 2.1, FL: 2.4).

Discussion

We developed a novel epidemic model called SuEIR to infer the unreported cases of individuals
contacting COVID-19. Based on this new model, we further develop a machine learning approach
to forecast the numbers of confirmed and fatality cases in the US.
Our model can provide accurate short-term (daily ahead) projections for both confirmed cases
and fatality cases at national and state levels, which demonstrates its effectiveness. In the long term,
the prediction results by our model suggest that the numbers of confirmed cases and death will
keep increasing rapidly within one month. In particular, at the end of June, our model forewarns
that there will be approximately 2 millions confirmed infectious cases and 120K reported deaths in

the United States.
Our model uses training data since 03/22/2020 at which most states have already issued stay-athome order, and assumes that the contact rate maintains the same level during the training and
prediction period. However, starting in May, many states have already lifted the restrictions of
businesses and public spaces and considered reopening that allows people to go back to restaurants
and offices and places of worship. It remains unclear how these reopening orders affect the contact
rate as well as the spread of the virus and therefore our current model does not take this into
consideration.

Moreover, we found that for most states, the learned discover rate (i.e., µ) is less than 0.1, which
implies that a large fraction of “Exposed” individuals will finally recover/die without being tested
and reported. This further suggests that the actual number of infected cases in the US may be
more than 10 millions, while most of them are not counted. This result is consistent with the recent
findings by the researchers from the University of Southern California (Sood et al., 2020), which
show that 4.65% (CI: [2.8%, 5.6%]) of Los Angeles residents have already contracted the COVID-19
virus, which is approximately 23 times more than the official reported numbers.
