DESIGN

Prospective cohort study including patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19.

SETTING

Copenhagen University Hospital Amager and Hvidovre, Hvidovre, Denmark.

PARTICIPANTS

407 patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 were included from the Emergency Department

(ED). Patients were included from March 19 to April 3 and follow-up data was collected until April 17,

2020.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

Primary outcomes were respiratory failure in patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 and in

those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. Furthermore, we analysed differences

between patients testing positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2, and disease severity outcomes in

SARS-CoV-2 positive patients according to baseline suPAR.

BACKGROUND

Patients admitted to ED with clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection need a safe and quick

triage, in order to determine if an in-hospital stay is necessary or if the patient can safely be isolated

Furthermore, we examined demographic, clinical, and biochemical differences between SARS-CoV-2-

RESULTS

Among the 407 symptomatic patients, the median (interquartile range) age was 64 years (47-77), 58%

were women, and median suPAR was 4.2 ng/ml (2.7-6.4). suPAR level below 4.75 ng/ml at admission

ruled out respiratory failure during follow-up with an area under the curve (95% CI) of 0.89 (0.85-

0.94) and a negative predictive value of 99.5%. Of the 407 symptomatic patients, 117 (28.8%) had a

positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and presented with significant differences in vital signs, cell

counts, and biomarkers compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. In SARS-CoV-2 positive patients

Introduction

The

SARS-CoV-2

pandemic

puts

extraordinary

pressure

on

hospital

resources

and

capacity, especially for the Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Clinical and laboratory markers of potential

respiratory failure are needed in order to safely and quickly distinguish between patients who will

require admission to hospitals with ICU facilities, and patients who can be discharged to recover in

1

another institution or in their private home.

Several routine biomarkers have been shown to be associated with severe illness and mortality in

patients with COVID-19. These include decreased white blood cell count, lymphocyte and platelet

counts,

and

increased

resources, such as protective equipment, free up bed capacity, and lower the pressure on hospital

staff. The main complication of patients with COVID-19 is the sudden development of respiratory

failure, and safe discharge would require little or no risk of development of respiratory failure.

There are several reasons why suPAR may be a suitable marker for discharge or admission of patients

with symptoms of COVID-19: First, suPAR is a marker of chronic inflammation, and patients with high

suPAR have a chronically activated immune system that is less capable of fighting disease. Second,

suPAR is elevated in elderly with comorbidities and identifies the frail patients. In unselected acute

medical patients, suPAR is a strong marker of readmission and mortality.

Third, suPAR has been

investigated in several viral infections, including HIV, hepatitis C, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever,

and hantavirus. In all cases, suPAR is associated with clinical severity and mortality.

We aimed to investigate whether suPAR and other biomarkers and clinical symptoms can aid in

identifying patients with low risk of respiratory failure when presenting with symptoms of COVID-19.

We aimed to identify a clinical cut-off value for suPAR for patients with symptoms of COVID-19 (Obs-

COVID-19) and for those tested positive in reverse transcription – polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

testing for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether the existing cut-off of 6 ng/ml

is associated with disease severity in those who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we compared

biomarkers and clinical signs between SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative Obs-COVID-19 patients.

Methods

A single center prospective cohort study at Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre. Patients with

mild symptoms and without need for clinical evaluation for admission were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in a

temporary COVID-19 clinic. Only patients with more severe symptoms were referred to the ED and

had blood drawn and were included in the study. Patient inclusion took place in the period from

Japan).

Plasma suPAR was measured using suPARnostic Quick Triage point-of care test (ViroGates, Birkerød,

Denmark) and quantified using an aLF reader (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Blood for this test (EDTA, 4

ml) was drawn on arrival and centrifuged for 3 minutes. The test provides a result in 20 minutes.

suPAR was measured real time 24/7, but the result was not available to the attending physicians as it

was unknown whether suPAR added value in triage of patients with symptoms of COVID-19. Data

were transferred from electronic patient health records into a Research Electronic Data Capture

program (REDCap), and quality control of data was performed by three medical doctors (IA, MS, and

Incident organ dysfunction or worsening of chronic organ dysfunction during hospitalization

Organ dysfunction during hospitalization was defined as either kidney failure (defined as dialysis

initiated), liver failure (defined as INR >1.6 for patients without anticoagulant therapy, and/or ALAT

>400 U/L, and/or bilirubin >50 umol/L, and/or albumin less than 15 g/L); lung failure (defined as > 10 L

oxygen per minute and respiratory rate ≥28/minute or need of mechanical ventilation); heart failure

(defined as Troponin T above 100 ng/ml, echo with newly decreased pump function or lowering of

pump function, or acute heart failure that is not caused because of hypoxia following interruption of

ventilation).

Patient and Public Involvement
Our study did not involve patient or public involvement as there were no impact/change in clinical
practice during the study as we did not know whether the clinical signs or biomarker measurements
could impact on the outcome of the patients with symptoms of COVID-19.

failure, heart failure.

Statistical analysis

A schematic presentation of the analysis is shown in supplementary table 1.

Continuous and categorical variables are presented as median (interquartile range; IQR) and n (%),

respectively.

Comparisons of baseline parameters between patients eligible/not eligible for intubation and SARS-

COV-2 status (positive/negative) were done by chi-squared test, fishers exact test, or Wilcoxon sum

rank test.

Optimal cut-off points for suPAR, age and all other biomarker measures in relation to respiratory

failure was calculated by separate receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. The Youden index

(maximization of sensitivity and specificity) was used to determine optimal cut-off values. Area under

the curve (AUC) with 95 % confidence interval (CI), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value

(PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for cut-off values were reported for all ROC analysis.

Comparisons of outcome parameters between suPAR below/above cut-off from ROC analysis were

done by chi-squared test or fishers exact test.

Because of multiple testing when comparing baseline or outcome variables Bonferroni correction was

used, scaling the significance level according to the number of tests performed. Since different

numbers of variables were tested in the comparisons the significance level also varied, and specific

significance levels is listed in the tables.

Incidence plots for time to development of respiratory failure in all patients with symptoms of COVID-

19 and eligible to receive intensive care treatment and for those with additionally a positive test for

SARS-CoV-2 within suPAR groups were made, using cut-off values from the ROC analysis to group

patients. The statistical program R v3.60 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was

used for analysis and figures.

Discussion

In the ED at Hvidovre Hospital, approximately 1/3 of the patients presenting with symptoms of

COVID-19 were tested positive, and 1/3 of these developed respiratory failure requiring intubation

and mechanical ventilation. It should be emphasized that only patients with more severe symptoms

are referred to the ED for blood works and examination. We have previously shown that low suPAR

can is associated with low risk of adverse outcomes for acute medical patients.

. Our present

results suggest that suPAR may also be useful for risk stratification of patients with symptoms of

COVID-19, as suPAR below 4.75 ng/ml had a negative predictive value of 99.5% of requiring ventilator

support during the 14 days of follow-up. Obs-COVID-19 patients with low suPAR might therefore be

discharged to facilities without ventilator access.

Major differences between Obs-COVID-19 patients who tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2

At baseline, clinicians evaluated whether a patient was eligible for intubation if necessary. Deciding

which patients are eligible for intubation is more relevant than ever. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes

severe lung injury with patients often being intubated for weeks, often on their stomach and with

high

levels

and

high

pressure

function.

Furthermore, a high patient load may also necessitate selection of patients that have the best chance

of surviving mechanical ventilation. We provide the clinical and biochemical characteristics according

to patient eligibility in our hospital. Those not eligible for ICU treatment were, in general, elderly

fragile comorbid patients.

Elevated

suPAR

is

associated

with

increased

risk

of

respiratory

failure

in

SARS-CoV-2

positive

patients

In patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, approximately 1/3 developed respiratory failure and

were intubated and ventilated during the 14 days follow-up. Among the biomarkers examined in this

study, we identified baseline suPAR as a good baseline predictor of respiratory failure during follow-

up (AUC of 0.88), suggesting that suPAR can aid in the identification of COVID-19 patients at low or

high

risk

of

respiratory

failure.

Our

study

is

in

accordance

with

the

findings

of

a

recent

Greek/American study on COVID-19 patients that found a 16-fold increased risk of intubation in

3

patients with baseline suPAR above 6 ng/ml.

Baseline suPAR as a marker of disease progression and disease severity in acute medical patients

Since 2013, our hospital has measured suPAR in acute medical patients. We have shown that elevated

suPAR is a strong marker of disease severity, readmission, and mortality.

45

However, as an unspecific

biomarker reflecting overall patient disease severity, low suPAR seems particular useful as a discharge

marker. A randomized controlled study found more patients were discharged when clinicians had

17

access to suPAR.

The present study find that elevated suPAR is also associated with disease severity

and outcomes in patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19, as shown by the higher number of

long-term hospital admission, increased number of patients developing respiratory and organ failures.

A recent position paper from the Hellenic Sepsis study group suggests suPAR below 4 ng/ml for

18

discharge and above 6 ng/ml for further examination.

While suPAR above 6 ng/ml may be a good

cut-off level indicating need for clinical attention and further examination, suPAR below 6 ng/ml may

be

too

high

for

safe

discharge.

The

Youden

Index

identified

a

suPAR

cut-off

of

4.75

ng/ml

for

respiratory failure in Obs-COVID-19 patients in the current study, in agreement with safe discharge

after thorough clinical examination if the patient has a suPAR level below 4 ng/ml.

Perspectives of the findings

Currently, many potential treatments and drugs that may aid COVID-19 patients are in the pipeline or

being tested. We propose that trials include patients with high risk of negative outcomes as the

possible benefit may outweigh the potential side effects in low risk patients. The first trial only

including

patients

with

elevated

suPAR

has

been

initiated

(suPAR-guided Anakinra Treatment

for

Validation of the Risk and Management of Respiratory Failure by COVID-19, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

NCT04357366).

We show that patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had elevated suPAR, and a suPAR level of 5.2

ng/ml had the maximum sensitivity and specificity for respiratory failure. COVID-19 patients with suPAR

above 5.2 ng/ml also had increased risk of developing acute kidney injury. Recent studies have shown

that elevated suPAR is not only associated with, but may also be causative in the development of acute

19 20

kidney injury.

This raises the question of whether anti-suPAR antibody treatment may lower the

19

overzealous immune activation observed in severe COVID-19 patients and protect against AKI.

Further

studies are needed to examine this.

Another

question

raised

by

our

findings

is

whether

the

suPAR

level

is

a

risk

factor

susceptibility? First, suPAR is a marker of chronic inflammation, and patients and

for

even

COVID-19

individuals

19 21

without disease are prone to disease development and disease progression with elevated suPAR.

Second, a chronically activated immune system may also allow for higher risk of infection with virus, as

virus may have an easier time evading the immune system, settling, and replicating. Third, suPAR is the

soluble form of the urokinase receptor, uPAR, a receptor that promotes plasminogen activation to

plasmin.

Plasmin

proteolytically

breaks

down

excess

fibrin

to

generate

D-dimer,

a

biomarker

also

observed to be associated with outcome in COVID-19. Plasmin may cleave the S protein of SARS-CoV-2,

22

which increases its infectivity and virulence.

Thus, an elevated suPAR before infection may increase

susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but further studies are needed to verify this.

Limitations

This is a single center study and larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm suPAR as a

predictive marker in COVID-19. Another limitation is that we were not able to compare suPAR to D-

dimer, IL-6 and ferritin which have also been shown to be associated with respiratory failure in COVID-19

2, 23

patients.

In conclusion,

suPAR

is

a

marker

of

disease

development

in

patients

presenting

at

the

ED

with

symptoms of COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus affects several biomarkers of the infected patients.

Patients with elevated baseline suPAR were at increased risk of respiratory failure during 14-day

follow-up. Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 and a suPAR level less than 4-.75 ng/ml can be

discharged following thorough clinical examination to facilities without ventilator access.
