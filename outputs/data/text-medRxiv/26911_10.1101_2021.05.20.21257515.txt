Abstract
Several collected data representing the spread of some infectious disease have demonstrated
that the spread does not really exhibit homogeneous spread. Clear examples can include the spread
of Spanish ‡u and Covid-19. Collected data depicting numbers of daily new infections in the case
of Covid-19 from countries like Turkey, Spain show three waves with di¤erent spread patterns.
A clear indication of crossover behaviors. While modelers have suggested many mathematical
models to depicting these behaviors, it becomes clear that their mathematical models cannot really
capture the crossover behaviors, especially passage from deterministic resetting to stochastics.
Very recently Atangana and Seda have suggested a concept of piecewise modeling consisting in
de…ning a di¤erential operator piece-wisely, the idea was …rst in chaos and outstanding patterns
were captured. In this paper, we extend this concept to the …eld of epidemiology with the aim
to depict waves with di¤erent patterns. Due to the novelty of this concept, a di¤erent approach
to insure the existence and uniqueness of system solutions are presented. A piecewise numerical
approach is presented to derive numerical solutions of such models. An illustrative example is
presented and compared with collected data from 3 di¤erent countries including Turkey, Spain
and Czechia. The obtained results let no doubt for us to conclude that this concept is a new
window that will help mankind to better understand nature.
Keywords: Piecewise modeling, piecewise existence and uniqueness, piecewise numerical scheme,
Covid-19 model, fractional operators and stochastic approach.

Introduction

Although mankind has been using mathematical model to attempt replicating the spread patterns
of infection diseases within given settlements, however in several cases, one will notice that their
mathematical models do not always capture the wave and the di¤erent crossovers exhibiting by these
waves. Some examples including the Spanish ‡u that started in 1918 and ended after three waves in
1920. Another recent one is the spread of Covid-19. The disagreement between experimental data and
the solutions of mathematical equation is perhaps due to the fact that complexities of collected data
are not sometimes taken into account. Another reason is perhaps the non-updating of existing theory,
for example, many years the reproductive number have been used in many research papers with no new
modi…cation , indeed it is perhaps not worth to consider a reproductive number of a model describing
spread that present three waves where each wave present a di¤erent pattern. Another example is the
use of rates that have been always suggested to be constant, white a constant rate clearly show the
homogeneity of the spread. Whereas in the normal situation rate of infection could be a function of
time to indeed include into the mathematical equation the spread complexities or non-homogeneity.
Another quit useful function to evaluate the stability of equilibrium point is the Lyapunov function.
Such function cannot however inform about the wave and their patterns. Recorded data of Covid-19
spread of some countries show multiple waves. For example, collected data from Turkey, Czechia and
Spain show three waves at least, where each wave present a di¤erent processes. Neither the concept
of reproductive number or the Lyapunov function or the existing way of modeling epidemiological
problems could possibly predict these waves. Indeed, modeling real world problems with crossover
e¤ects has always been a great challenge to modelers. Even though signi…cant e¤orts have been
made by researchers from di¤erent background, nevertheless there are still many real world problem
exhibiting crossover behaviors with complex patterns. An e¤ort made to address this resulted to an
introduction of a fractional di¤erential operators with non-singular kernel exhibiting a crossover from
stretched exponential to power-law in terms of mean-square displacement. This non-singular kernel
also has crossover from normal to sub-di¤usion, also the kernel can express crossover from random
walk to power-law. However, crossover from deterministic setting to stochastic or from stochastic to
deterministic cannot be captured by this kernel, thus a great limitation of such operators to be used
in this scenarios.
Very recently, Atangana and Seda suggested the concepts of piecewise di¤erential and integral
operators. Additionally, the extended their innovative idea to modeling by suggesting a piecewise
modeling. This idea is perhaps the future of modeling with this innovative idea, we suggest in this
paper a new way to model epidemiological problems exhibiting crossover behaviors. In this paper, two
illustrative examples will be presented. We will assume that real world spread exhibit three waves with
di¤erent patterns, classical, nonlocal and randomness, a permutation can be done to have di¤erent
behaviors based on the above processes.

Modeling spread of infectious diseases with waves

In this section, we present a new way to model spread of infectious diseases exhibiting waves with
di¤erent patterns. Let assume without loss of generality that a mathematical model with n classes
describes spread of an infectious diseases with three waves where each wave exhibits di¤erent patterns,
assume with no loss of generality that classical mechanical processes, non-local processes, randomnessly
and their permutation, which will be considered in di¤erent cases.

2.1

Case 1: Classical-power-law-randomness

In this case, we assume a scenario where the three waves of the spread exhibit the above processes.
We assume that the …rst process starts from 0 to T1 , the second from T1 to T2 , and the last from T2
to T . A piecewise mathematical model associate to this can be given as

Case 2: Classical-Mittag–Le- er law-randomness

In this case, we assume a scenario where the three waves present processes with classical behaviors,
passage from stretched exponential to power-law and randomness, within the intervals described earlier
in case (1). A piecewise model associate to the above scenarios can be given as

Case 3: Classical-fading memory-randomness

In this case, it is assumed that three waves are observed where the second wave displays fading memory
process, which was known to be described best with the di¤erential operator with exponential kernel.
We also assume that three waves appear in the intervals described in case (1), then, the mathematical

Existence and uniqueness of Covid-19 model

In this section, we attempt to present a proof of existence and uniqueness of system solution of this
model. However, we shall note that, di¤erent techniques will be applied in respect to each interval,
indeed for the …rst and second case,the well-known procedure using the Banach …xed-point theorem
or modi…ed versions will be applied, however, the last part, since concerning stochastic a di¤erent
technique is applied.

Applications for Covid-19 model

A demonstrative example is better than precept, therefore, in this section, we present an application
of the suggested theory. In particular, we will consider a mathematical model that was suggested to
depicting the spread of Covid-19 within a given settlement. The model will be later modi…ed to follow
the steps presented in piece-wise modeling and for each model, a numerical method will be used to
provide a numerical solution to the model. Numerical simulation using the suggested numerical are
performed and depicted in Figure 1 to 7 for the …rst case, Figure 8 to 21 for second case and lastly
Figure 22 to 28 for third case.

6.1

Numerical simulation of Covid-19 model for Case 1

In case one, we consider a country within which the spread displays three processes, including classical
behaviors, power law behavior and …nally stochastic behaviors. In this case, if we consider T as the
last time of the spread, this is to say, the last day where a new infection occur, then, for the …rst period
of time ranging from 0 to T1 , the mathematical model will be constructed with classical di¤erential
operator, the second phrase, the model will be with the Caputo-Power law di¤erential operator and

Numerical simulation of Covid-19 model for Case 2

In case two, we consider a given community where the spread displays three processes, including
classical behaviors, fading memory behavior and …nally stochastic behaviors. In this case, if we consider T as the last time of the spread, this is to say, the last day where a new infection occur, then,
for the …rst period of time ranging from 0 to T1 , the mathematical model will be constructed with
classical di¤erential operator, the second phrase, the model will be with the Caputo-Fabrizio di¤erential operator and …nally stochastic approach will be used at the last phase. The mathematical model
explaining this dynamic is then presented below.

Comparison between piecewise model and real data for some
countries
Comparison between a piecewise model and real data in Turkey

In this subsection, we compare modi…ed model by using model that we introduced in the previous
chapters with daily number of cases between March 11 and April 20, 2021 in Turkey. Since it will
not be easy to predict such long time interval data, to achieve greater compatibility between model
that we will suggest and data, we will write our model in more pieces. In other words, although we
presented our model in 3 pieces in the previous chapters, of course, we should know that we can write
the model in more pieces in order to capture more reality in modeling daily problems. Thus, it will
be inevitable for us to achieve our goal. But since this situation brings much more complexity with
it, that’s why let us …rst present some notations to avoid this complexity. We will use the notation
Xi ; i = 1; 2; ::; 7 such that
X1 = S; X2 = E; X3 = I; X4 = Q; X5 = C; X6 = R; X7 = W

Conclusion

Nature can be better understood or even predicted if the limitations of existing theories, approaches,
methods are questioned, revised and updated. This is also the case in epidemiological modeling, for
many decades several theories have not been revisited but are still used even to analyze complex
problems that cannot be really understood using existing theories. For example, how can we predict
waves for a given infectious disease using existing methods? Although signi…cant results have been
suggested and some highly informative, however, when looking at the spread of Covid-19, especially
data from some countries, one will quickly realize that some of them exhibit crossover behaviors, for
example a passage from patterns with deterministic features to stochastic. We have attempted to
open a new window of modeling such problems, by using the concept of piecewise modelling. We
present some illustrative examples. The agreement of the piecewise models and experimental data
let no doubt that this approach will help mankind to better predict crossover behaviors appearing in
nature.
