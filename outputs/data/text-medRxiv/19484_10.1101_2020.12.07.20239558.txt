Abstract
The current scale of public and private testing cannot be expected to meet the emerging
need for higher levels of community-level and repeated screening of asymptomatic Canadians
for SARS-CoV-2. Rapid point-of-care techniques are increasingly being deployed to fill the gap
in screening levels required to identify undiagnosed individuals with high viral loads. However,
rapid, point-of-care tests often have lower sensitivity in practice. Reverse transcription loopmediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 has proven sensitive and
specific and provides visual results in minutes. Using a commercially available kit for RT-LAMP
and primer set targetting nucleocapsid (N) gene, we tested a blinded set of 101 archived
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples with known RT-PCR results. RT-LAMP reactions were
incubated at 65˚C for 30 minutes, using heat-inactivated nasopharyngeal swab sample in viral
transport medium, diluted tenfold in water, as input. RT-LAMP agreed with all RT-PCR defined
negatives (N=51), and all positives with Ct less than 20 (N=24), 65% of positives with Ct
between 20-30 (N=17), and no positives with Ct greater than 30 (N=9). RT-LAMP requires
fewer and different core components, so may not compete directly with the mainline testing
workflow, preserving precious central laboratory resources and gold standard tests for those with
the greatest need. Careful messaging must be provided when using less-sensitive tests, so that
people are not falsely reassured by negative results – “glass half empty” – in exchange for
reliable detection of those with high levels of virus within an hour, using <$10 worth of
chemicals – “glass half full”.

Introduction
In an unprecedented scientific feat, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for SARSCoV-2 were published 21 days after the Chinese communicable disease control team arrived in
Wuhan on 31 December 2019 1, based on complete genome sequences published 10 days
earlier 2. Hundreds of molecular diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been introduced since
then 3-5. The main diagnostic targets rely on specific host antibodies, viral proteins and viral
RNA, each with its own specific benefits and limitations in accurately detecting the SARS-CoV2 infectious period to prevent its spread. The best, most sensitive examples of tests to detect each
target require high levels of laboratory expertise and specialized facilities that massively increase
expense and turnaround time, especially when challenged with recent, unprecedented testing
volumes. In addition, high throughput platforms used in laboratories have been diverted to
testing for SARS-CoV-2 at the expense of other infectious disease testing 6.
Advice on whether to test people “without symptoms” (which represents a range of presymptomatic, peri-symptomatic, sub-symptomatic and truly asymptomatic phenotypes) wavers
as much over time as actual demand for testing by people “without symptoms” 7,8. Constant
demand on the testing sites has led to “covid fatigue”, exhaustion of resources and delays in
testing for sexually transmitted infections that have not diminished during the current pandemic.
The arguments for not testing individuals “without symptoms”, since only a small percentage test
positive, make sense when investing the most precise, most expensive and most time-consuming
test available, for such a small return, considering the cost for human and reagent resources. In a
parallel system for screening people “without symptoms” (for example, the Iceland model 9), that
is much cheaper and faster per person, doesn’t occupy the commercial platforms used in
diagnostic laboratories, and with a 50-75% sensitivity might start looking like “a glass half full”.

Point-of-care assays that can rapidly indicate infection outside the laboratory have been
approved for use in many jurisdictions. These include rapid antibody-detecting cassettes that use
serum or a few drops of peripheral blood, rapid antigen tests on nasopharyngeal samples, and allin-one qRT-PCR platforms such as Cepheid’s GeneXpert, which provides highly sensitive and
specific results relative to the gold standard in a fraction of the time 10,11. However, a key
limitation is lack of scalability, with each (very expensive) machine only able to run one or a few
samples at a time, with only a fixed number of single-source, single-use cassettes available per
site per day. The intense demand for cartridges across all jurisdictions makes overall access
limited.
More recently, nucleic acid isothermal amplification (NAIA) techniques, including loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), recombinase-polymerase amplification (RPA) and
transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) have been shown to detect SARS-CoV-2 with very
high sensitivity and specificity 12,13. Isothermal amplification underlies several tests recently
authorized for emergency use, including the ID NOW from Abbott (recently approved in
Canada) and CRISPR-based detection using SHERLOCK 14 (currently not approved for sale
outside the United States).
The ID NOW compares favourably to GeneXpert 15, but also shares its disadvantages in
terms of single sample per use and single-source cartridges. The LAMP/CRISPR test requires no
special machines or cartridges, requiring only strip tubes or plates and p10 filter tips, hence it can
easily be scaled up to conduct hundreds or thousands of tests. New England Biolabs’
Colorimetric WarmStart LAMP kit can also be scaled and, thankfully, is available in Canada in
various formulations. Incubation requires a simple heating block, or even a warm thermos that
can hold the required temperature until DNA amplification is complete. Since DNA

amplification produces protons, the pH of the reaction drops and can conveniently be interpreted
by eye using colour-sensitive pH stains, such as cresol red. In this study, we evaluated how a
commercial colorimetric RT-LAMP kit combined with published SARS-CoV-2 primer sets and
heat-treated, diluted sample compares with “gold standard” RT-PCR analysis conducted by our
central laboratory.

Materials and Methods
Archived sample set – A total of 101 leftover nasopharyngeal swab samples in viral
transport medium, previously tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR using E gene primers and
purified RNA template on the Cobas or Panther Fusion platforms, were used to validate a
recently described RT-LAMP assay. 50 samples were RT-PCR positive, with fluorescence
threshold values between 10 and 37 cycles, and 51 samples were RT-PCR negative. Samples
were de-identified and only RT-PCR and RT-LAMP results were retained for analysis. All study
procedures were reviewed and approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Board, University of
Manitoba.
Sample processing and heat treatment – After assigning blinded sample identifiers to
reduce potential bias in interpretation, samples were thawed and briefly spun down in a minicentrifuge to collect cells and debris. An aliquot of 60 μl, drawn from the bottom of the tube near
the pelleted material, was transferred to a 1.7 ml Eppendorf tube, labelled with the blinded code,
then incubated in a heating block at 95˚C for 5 minutes. Serial tenfold dilutions of sample were
prepared in nuclease-free water (New England Biolabs, Whitby, ON).
RT-LAMP assay and controls – RT-LAMP was carried out using the Colorimetric
WarmStart LAMP Kit (New England Biolabs) and a published LAMP primer set targeting the N

gene of SARS-CoV-2, previously shown to have high sensitivity 16,17 (Integrated DNA
Technologies, Coralville, IA). A 10X mixture of the six primers in the set was prepared by first
suspending all primers separately in nuclease-free water at a concentration of 100 μM, then
combining 16 μl each of FIP/BIP, 4 μl each of LF/LB, 2 μl each of F3/B3, and 56 μl nucleasefree water (final volume 100 μl). Serial tenfold dilutions in nuclease-free water of SARS-CoV-2
or MERS-CoV DNA (Integrated DNA Technologies) were used as positive and negative
controls, respectively, and included in every test batch. Reactions were set up in a final volume
of 20 μl (10 μl 2X Master Mix, 2 μl 10X primer mix, 6-7.5 μl nuclease-free water and 0.5-2 μl
sample, either diluted or undiluted) and incubated in a heat block at 65˚C for 30 minutes. After
sitting on ice for a few minutes to sharpen contrast, colour was assessed visually and
photographed. Bright yellow colour indicates a positive result, while magenta indicates a
negative result. Tests with orange or pink colour were considered ambiguous and re-tested.
Data analysis – After categorization as either positive (yellow) or negative (magenta),
samples were unblinded and compared. Sensitivity, specificity and positive/negative predictive
values with confidence intervals were calculated using standard formulas with the help of
MedCalc: https://www.medcalc.org/calc/diagnostic_test.php .

Results
Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values – Sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay using
raw, heat-inactivated sample was 77% compared to RT-PCR of purified RNA extracts (Table 1).
Samples with the lowest Ct values (<22) were all bright yellow by RT-LAMP, even when
diluted up to 1000-fold, indicating a similar range of detectable concentration to the positive
control. All RT-PCR negatives were also RT-LAMP negative (Table 1). This indicates that RT-

Interpretation of colour change – Only samples that were bright yellow after 30 minutes
incubation were considered positive (Figure 1). In some cases, a partial colour change resulted,
from magenta to pink to orange, but did not become yellow within the period of observation in
which the positive control always turns yellow (20-30 minutes, regardless of dilution factor
down to 1,000 copies). This partial colour change may indicate a weak positive (all samples do
eventually turn yellow), a failed reaction (not indicating anything about the sample itself), or a
true negative, depending on the reason for the weak change in pH. Pink and orange reactions
were also more frequent when undiluted raw sample or 10% v/v template/reaction mixture was
used.

Interpretation of colour in tests on Samples 9-24 – Only bright yellow results

after 30 minutes at 65˚C are considered positive. Magenta colour indicates a “true” negative
(insufficient viral RNA), while orangey colour is considered “indeterminate” and re-tested.

Controls and limit of detection – Negative controls were reliably magenta throughout the
experiments (Figure 2) but did eventually get contaminated. Routine cleanup with DNAse and
careful separation of pre-amplification and amplification/post-amplification areas are required
(unless you use NEB’s more expensive dUTP kit) to prevent the massive DNA contamination
that LAMP is prone to. The MERS DNA negative control at 1,000 and 10,000 copies did not
produce any yellow colour, however 100,000 copies resulted in a positive reaction (not shown).
SARS-CoV-2-N DNA positive control produced a bright yellow reaction within 30 minutes
down to 1,000 copies, but remained magenta at lower dilutions, indicating 103 viral copies per μl
as the lower limit of detection for the current conditions (Figure 2).

Discussion
In this study, we confirm that one of the fastest, simplest, cheapest and most scalable
protocols available for detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is so far reliable for strong positives
only, but highly specific compared to “gold standard” qRT-PCR detection. Other studies have

shown similar reduced sensitivity but high specificity 17-21. One early study found that RT-LAMP
was more sensitive than RT-PCR at detecting virus in an asymptomatic carrier monitored for
several days 22. RT-LAMP has been tested extensively at large scale in the UK and has recently
been shown to have less-than-expected sensitivity (<50%) when rolled out to large populations
as part of Operation Moonshot 23. However, similarly to the current study, sensitivity was
greatest in strong positives, indicating that only those with high viral loads may reliably be
detected with this diagnostic platform, especially when performed by non-experts in field
settings.
The pace of Canadian approvals for SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care diagnostic tests has been
much faster than for other infections over the years (such as HIV/STBBI). Initial conditional
approvals were revoked for the isothermal amplification-based Spartan Cube and its apparently
inadequate silicon sampling devices. Recent approvals have included a rapid isothermal platform
(Abbott’s IDNow, based on nicking enzyme amplification reactions or NEAR) and a rapid
antigen-detecting cassette (Abbott’s PanBio Ag Rapid Test Device), adding to the successful
Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid®). No rapid, point-of-care antibody tests have yet been
approved for use in Canada.
The FDA has meanwhile provided Emergency Use Authorization for dozens of
diagnostics of all descriptions, from the Sherlock Biosciences LAMP/CRISPR platform to the
recent LAMP-based home test by Lucira 24. All of these tests are imperfect and do not work as
well in practice as manufacturer’s claim. Despite these limitations, all tests applied on a wider
scale, with proper messaging about the limited significance of negative results, could be highly
useful if strong positives are identified and acted upon more quickly 25. For example, several

jurisdictions are exploring use of PanBio Ag Rapid Test Device to identify positives early,
assuming that negative results will need additional testing in order to be confirmed 26-28.
Molecular diagnostic techniques that use raw or minimally processed sample are fastest,
but less sensitive, since the background chemistry of a raw sample may introduce uncontrolled
variability 18,29. Potential inhibitors or other contaminants may reduce the reliability of both
positive and negative results. This concern is somewhat lessened in the context of the current
report, which we have confirmed is highly specific and can amplify target molecules even in
highly diluted samples. However, the current assay’s limit of detection (currently 1,000
copies/μl, similar to other studies 18) does decrease the likelihood of detecting a person with low
viral load. In contrast, Sherlock Biosciences claims on its website (www.sherlock.bio) that its
LAMP-based assay can detect 7 copies per μl VTM or up to 150 times less than this report.
Is the risk of missing someone with a low viral load greater than making a person with a
high viral load wait days to find out they are positive? In all cases, expectations about what a
negative test result actually means must be properly managed. In this study, RT-LAMP with
raw, heat-treated sample was ~75% sensitive compared to nasopharyngeal RT-PCR (“the gold
standard”), meaning that a false negative result can be expected 1 out of 4 times the test is
performed. Therefore, careful explanation that a single negative test does not mean a person is
free of SARS-CoV-2 must be included as part of pre-test and post-test counselling.
However, RT-LAMP using raw sample is much cheaper and faster than RT-PCR using
purified RNA (Table 2). Multiple RT-LAMP tests can be conducted in less time and at less cost
than a single “gold standard” RT-PCR test. Repeat screening over several days may also help
identify the earliest timepoint at which a person is infectious, increasing confidence that a

laboratories and diagnostic services in hospitals are diverting high throughput platforms in
attempt to keep up with surges in testing for SARS-CoV-2 at the expense of testing for other
pathogens. Developing multiple testing platforms that do not require the same instruments,
reagents and laboratory infrastructure are of paramount importance in order to increase testing
capacity 25. RT-LAMP uses Bst instead of Taq for amplification, does not compete for tips and
reagents for RNA extraction (if raw sample is used), and is simple enough for a trained nonspecialist to execute with oversight and support, freeing nurses and other front-line staff for less
technical duties. Increased validation and application of rapid tests such as RT-LAMP is only
worthwhile if it frees up central laboratories to get back to providing diagnostics services, of all
kinds, to those most in need.
In conclusion, scalable rapid tests, such as the one evaluated in this study, may efficiently
detect individuals with high viral loads at the point of care. Our findings suggest RT-LAMP
could be useful as a screening mechanism for prioritized samples within the existing test chain,
reliably identifying those with highest virus concentrations hours ahead of the standard RT-PCR
workflow, and able to be scaled to any required number of tests per day. Further work must
focus on improving sensitivity, incorporating saliva or other self-collected samples, and
triangulating evidence from different testing modalities 31, to better ascertain an individual’s
infectious period.
