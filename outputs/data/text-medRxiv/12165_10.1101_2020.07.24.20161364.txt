Abstract
Many countries worldwide that were successful in containing the first wave of the COVID19 epidemic are faced with the seemingly impossible choice between the resurgence of infections and endangering the economic and mental well-being of their citizens. While blanket
measures are slowly being lifted and infection numbers are monitored, a systematic strategy for
balancing contact restrictions and the freedom necessary for a functioning society long-term
in the absence of a vaccine is currently lacking. Here, we propose a regional strategy with
locally triggered containment measures that can largely circumvent this trade-off and substantially lower the magnitude of restrictions the average individual will have to endure in the near
future. For the simulation of future disease dynamics and its control, we use current data on
the spread of COVID-19 in Germany, Italy, England, New York State and Florida, taking into
account the regional structure of each country and their past lockdown efficiency. Overall, our
analysis shows that tight regional control in the short term can lead to long-term net benefits due to small-number effects which are amplified by the regional subdivision and crucially
depend on the rate of cross-regional contacts. We outline the mechanisms and parameters responsible for these benefits and suggest possible was to gain access to them, simultaneously
achieving more freedom for the population and successfully containing the epidemic. Our
open-source simulation code is freely available and can be readily adapted to other countries.
We hope that our analysis will help create sustainable, theory-driven long-term strategies for
the management of the COVID-19 epidemic until therapy or immunization options are available.

Main
While the levels of daily new infections with COVID-19 around the world are still at an all-time
high [1], many countries that were hit early on by the epidemic have demonstrated that its control
is possible through population-wide contact bans and radical restrictions on public and economic
life [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], which were deemed necessary despite their socioeconomic cost. However,
after the decline of infection numbers, these countries now face an equally important task, which is
restoring socioeconomic life to sustainable levels without risking the resurgence of the epidemic.
Although some aspects of public life in these countries have already resumed, it has so far been
possible to maintain relatively low, stable infection numbers, suggesting that the basic reproduction number is in the vicinity of 1. Given the volatility of a situation with R ≈ 1, governments
must now prepare to systematically manage the epidemic with non-pharmaceutical interventions
until medication or a vaccine is available. If the further reopening leads to a basic reproduction

number > 1 even under the continued enforcement of hygiene rules, effective contact tracing and
quarantine [7, 8], it is essential that such control strategies are capable of containing new outbreaks
with minimal restrictions, in order not to stall the recovery process.
A natural idea for such more fine-grained approaches is to give more control to local authorities
and employ regional containment measures only when necessary. In Germany, for example, many
counties have not seen any new infections with the last 7 days [9], rendering control measures
unnecessary until infections are reintroduced from outside (given sufficient testing).

An adaptive local containment strategy
We set out to investigate a family of containment strategies for COVID-19 which aim at giving
communities without substantial infection levels as much freedom as possible at any given time
while trying to contain local outbreaks. We then determine the ability ob these strategies to avoid
harsh contact restrictions for the average person in the population. Our proposed rules are based on
critical infection thresholds that trigger restrictions in individual counties. To this end, we obtained
the county structure of five countries/states, namely Germany, England, Italy, New York State and
Florida, to set up a mathematical model composed of individual sub-populations and numerically
simulate the future evolution of the epidemic starting from current case numbers. While the free
spread of diseases through such subdivided populations [10, 11, 12] or networks [13, 14] has been
investigated theoretically, we are not aware of previous studies that have considered the regional
structure of specific countries and its relation to local containment measures in the context of
COVID-19.
We use an extended SIR model that differentiates between internal contacts within a region
and cross-regional contacts with the general population (Fig. 1a). Because of low infection numbers in each region, it is necessary to use a stochastic model with discrete infection events [15]
(see Appendix for exact model definition). We assume that the reproduction number R0 in the

overall population in the absence of stringent restrictions is slightly above 1. This is a reasonable
assumption given that many countries have been successful in maintaining low infection numbers
even after lifting their most strict lockdown measures [6], and while some restrictions remain to
be removed, general hygiene and distancing measures are unlikely to be given up in the near future. However, to cover a wider range of parameters, we also simulated higher values of R0 up to
R0 ≈ 1.7. The majority of an individual’s contacts take place in the local sub-population (small
arrows in Fig. 1a), while some proportion of contacts with the general population (large arrows
in Fig. 1a; parameterized by the leakiness ξ ) can potentially lead to the spreading of the disease
across sub-population boundaries.
To give the population as much freedom as possible, local sub-populations only activate local
restrictions (red county in Fig. 1a) whenever infection numbers cross a certain threshold θ , specified as number of infections per 100,000 inhabitants. For our main investigation, we assumed that
the effect of local restrictions on the contact rate is similar to that of the recent population-wide
lockdown measures, which allowed us to extract the corresponding reproduction number during
the lockdown, Rl , for each country directly from the available infection number data (see Appendix
and Supp. Fig. 1). Similar values in the range between 0.77 and 0.79 were found for Germany,
England, Italy, and New York State, which have had low infection numbers since the measures
were imposed, and Rl ≈ 0.9 was found for Florida, which has had a resurgence after the initial
period of control.
Since authorities have to rely on reported infection numbers, we make the conservative assumption that local restrictions can only be activated with a delay of τ = 14 days, which is made
up of at least three contributions: First, case numbers are themselves reported with considerable
delay because most testing only happens after the onset of symptoms and the administrative reporting process needs time. Second, in the presence of a constant background noise of fluctuating
infection levels, heightened case numbers can only be detected with statistical significance after
a certain amount of time [5]. Finally, a local lockdown needs to be ordered by the responsible

government agencies, which adds additional reaction time. On the other hand, when local restrictions finally bring infection numbers down, they are only lifted after a period τsafety , which can be
extended at will to allow for stringent control of the epidemic in a region.

Local restrictions can be more effective than population-wide
measures
With the rules set up as specified above, we could then compare the impact of such local containment strategies to equivalent population-wide strategies with the same parameters, where a
population-wide lockdown reducing the reproduction number to Rl is activated once case numbers in the whole population reach θ (with identical delays τ and τsafety ). To characterize this
impact, we simulated the future evolution of the epidemic in the next 5 years and recorded the
average time individuals in the population experience restrictions imposed during supra-threshold
infection levels.
Assuming a high leakiness that leads to a strong exchange of infections between regions, we
find that population-wide strategy (‘global control’) and local measures (‘local control’) perform
similarly on average (Fig. 1b). On the one hand, this confirms that individuals on average are not
worse off under thoroughly enforced local strategy than they would have been under a centrally
managed lockdown strategy with equivalent parameters. However, it also means that the avoidance
of unnecessary restrictions on the local level during times of low infection levels is a deception:
On average, they will have to suffer the same amount of restrictions in both cases. This can also
be seen in the evolution of overall infection numbers (Fig. 1c): While the fingerprint of alternating
phases of population-wide freedom and population-wide lockdown can be clearly seen for the
population-wide strategy, the local strategy with the same strong exchange between regions settles
at very similar infection levels. Therefore, it does not come at a surprise that a similar amount
of restrictions is required to manage them. Note that the local strategy at high leakiness, while

not changing the average restriction time, introduces a large variability across members of the
population (Fig. 1b), so some individuals will actually see an increase in restrictions compared to
the population-wide strategy.
For a lower leakiness, stark differences appear: The lower exchange between sub-populations
has almost no impact on the population-wide strategy, neither in terms of the average lockdown
time required (Fig. 1b) nor in terms of disease dynamics (Fig. 1c). In contrast, the local strategy can control the epidemic while imposing restrictions for a substantially lower amount of time
(Fig. 1b). The evolution of infection numbers in this case shows a steady decline towards complete extinction of the disease (Fig. 1c). This is the result of a cooperative effect between the local
measures in different regions: Because of the targeted way in which local measures are applied,
they have the chance of rendering individual regions disease-free by the end of the local lockdown
or shortly afterwards through extinction [12], initiating periods of quiescence without the need for
restrictions. This happens at a faster rate than infections can be reintroduced through cross infections for sufficiently low ξ . In contrast, since the population-wide strategy is not dependent on
infection numbers in any specific region, the population structure is less important and the disease
is only rarely completely eliminated from some sub-populations (Supp. Fig. 3). Therefore, a striking reduction in the required restrictions originates from small number fluctuations, the ability of
the local strategy to impose restrictions exactly where needed, and its emergent effect of rendering
more and more regions disease-free. We find that the weak dependence of restriction time on the
leakiness ξ for the population-wide strategy and a contrasting threshold-like dependence of the
restriction time for the local strategy (Fig. 1d, cf. Supp. Fig. 2) are universal features (across the
entire parameter space) that emphasize the benefit of local strategies and the role of cooperativity.

The role of large sub-population structure
One major difference between individual sub-populations besides their current number of infections is their size. We find that, when the lockdown threshold is defined as a relative proportion θ as
introduced above, frequent lockdowns are more likely to be required in larger sub-populations. For
certain values of the leakiness, R0 and the lockdown threshold θ , these particularly active regions
can prevent the overall number of infections from declining, leading to a loss of any advantage
that local containment measures can have over a population-wide strategy. For example, using the
original sizes of all 412 counties in Germany, there is a clear correlation between the county size
and the time span for which the corresponding county has to activate severe restrictions to fight
local outbreaks (Fig. 2a, red data).
Densely populated areas prevent the reduction of restrictions in at least two ways: First, the
dynamics are characterized by almost periodic switching between lockdown and restriction-free
periods (Fig. 2b). The mechanism is similar to the one which leads to the unfavorable performance of the nation-wide lockdown strategy (cf. Fig. 1c), in that absolute case numbers in a
sub-population are generally too high to achieve complete elimination of the disease, and so lifting the lockdown even after a long safety margin τsafety leads to the immediate resurgence of the
epidemic. Besides leading to persistence of the disease in the group itself, this first effect also
turns large sub-populations into a continuous source of infections for other regions in the country.
Secondly, lockdowns in large-population regions affect a large number of individuals at the same
time and thus have a strong impact on the population-wide average time span a person has to live
with severe restrictions.
In contrast, if large regions are split up to limit the maximum population size to, e.g., 200,000
people (yellow data in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2c), all sub-populations are given the chance to become intermittently disease-free, avoiding lockdowns for longer periods of time and, cooperatively, leading
to a long-term decline of infection numbers in the whole population (compare top rows between

Figs. 2b and C). For a maximum size of 100,000 individuals, the effect becomes even stronger
(Fig. 2a, green data). For relative thresholds, the further subdivision of large counties effectively
leads to smaller absolute thresholds, so it is not surprising that a similar improvement can be observed when regions are not split up, but instead, the same absolute lockdown threshold is used
in each sub-population, regardless of its size. This strategy removes the size correlation almost
entirely (Fig. 2a, black data) and reduces the average restriction time required to control the epidemic in a similar way. However, it remains to be seen whether such absolute thresholds would be
realistic in terms of a practical implementation.

Differences between countries
Without further subdivision of counties, the effects described above therefore lead to pronounced
differences in the reduction that can be achieved in different countries. Countries with larger counties are at a disadvantage when exploiting this natural administrative level for the implementation
of a local containment strategy. Using parameters representing a tight control of the epidemic,
we therefore find that Germany, with its comparably small counties (7% of the population live in
counties with a population larger than 800,000), can substantially reduce restriction time (Fig. 3a)
with a local strategy based on a subdivision by county. In contrast, England (25%), Italy (50%),
New York State (65%) and Florida (51%) perform considerably worse, with Italy, New York State
and Florida not even achieving a 50% reduction. For comparison, when regions are further subdivided into sub-populations of a maximum of 200,000 people, reduction in all countries becomes
comparable and substantial (Fig. 3b).

Discussion
After the successful control of the acute phase, local containment strategies offer a sustainable
route for the long-term management of the COVID-19 epidemic. While the exact value of R0 after
all contact and travel restrictions have been lifted is not yet known, our analysis shows that local
containment with the same relative lockdown threshold θ on average never performs worse than
its population-wide equivalent1 , although parameters that do not achieve an average improvement
can lead to an unequal distribution of restrictions across the population (Fig. 1b). However, local
containment can lead to a large reduction in the required restrictions for R0 sufficiently close to
one and sufficiently small leakiness. Note that these benefits are based explicitly on discrete, low
numbers of infected individuals, similar to effects such as extinction [12] and persistence [10,
11] observed for the ‘free’ evolution of the epidemic. They would therefore not be present in a
deterministic mean-field description [3] (see Appendix) as commonly used to track the dynamics
of the pandemic.
The importance of entering the ‘small-number regime’ in individual sub-populations becomes
evident in at least two ways: First, as we have seen, large sub-populations with the same relative
thresholds are less likely to transiently eliminate the epidemic. This is precisely because absolute infection numbers are higher in these sub-populations, and so they fail to benefit from the low
number and discreteness of infection events in exactly the same way that the population-wide strategy does. This means that countries such as Germany with its rather small-scale county structure
naturally lend themselves to implementing such an approach using existing administrative structures. However, coarse county structure can be compensated for if countries can treat regions over
a few hundred thousand inhabitants more strictly or monitor infections (and trigger measures) in
less connected smaller sub-populations within those regions separately. The second place where
the importance of small numbers shows up is the choice of the relative lockdown threshold. Our

results indicate that θ around 10 : 100,000 achieves desirable results, which are further improved
by choosing a large safety margin τsafety (Supp. Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). It is worth putting this θ into
context: Since we use a mean infectious period of 1/k ≈ 7 days based on effective quarantining
measures [6, 7], our thresholds can be interpreted as new infections (per population) in the past 7
days. For comparison, a threshold incidence of 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the last 7 days
is currently used as an emergency indicator in Germany [9]. Our results therefore suggest that a
substantially lower threshold should be employed to get access to the cooperative benefits of local
containment measures. Given the current low numbers, this does not seem unrealistic.
In this context, it is interesting to note that, when starting from already low infection numbers,
the strength of local control itself is not as critical for the benefit of local measures as it first
seems: For a direct comparison, we assumed that, in Germany, instead of Rl = 0.77 during a local
lockdown, only a mild reduction in contact rate is achieved, such that the reproductive number is
Rl = 0.95, only slightly below 1. For parameters that are otherwise identical to those in Fig. 1,
naturally, the absolute restriction time increases (Supp. Fig. 2c) compared to local restrictions with
the actual value of Rl (Supp. Fig. 2a). However, there is still a substantial benefit of the local
over the global strategy, with a dependence on leakiness that is shifted slightly towards smaller
leakiness, similar to that for a higher R0 (Supp. Fig. 2b). This is similar to the situation of Florida
with Rl ≈ 0.9, which could still achieve a reduction in certain parameter regimes (cf. Fig. 3, Supp.
Fig. 9). This finding is important for countries which are not willing to apply overly strict measures
during a local lockdown.
In the practical implementation, the priority should therefore be on detecting and promptly responding to local increases in case numbers, rather than on an exceedingly strong response. An
important contribution is effective testing, essentially reducing the effective lockdown threshold
θ , which can avoid unnecessary restrictions through a trickle-down effect (see bottom rows in all
panels of Supp. Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), even though in the short run it paradoxically causes more
local restrictions. Conversely, less stringent testing leads to a net increase in the absolute time
10

restrictions have to be applied and also diminishes the relative improvement of local over global
measures. Therefore, insufficient testing might create conditions that make it difficult for the avoidance of unnecessary restrictions as compared to a population-wide strategy to actually materialize,
in addition to the general problems it causes [16]. Secondly, in the same way that masks are primarily worn to protect others [17, 18], local containment primarily prevents the spread of the disease
to other sub-populations, reducing the average required restrictions for everyone else. Cooperation
therefore plays a critical role not only on the physical, but also on the political level. Thus, it
seems advisable to have national policies in place which define minimum standards for thresholds
and local measures to be taken, such that the reaction to local outbreaks is swift and automatic, and
not delayed due to political and administrative processes.
An important unknown parameter in our study is the proportion of cross-regional contacts.
While related to travel and mobility [19, 20, 21], concrete values for ξ are difficult to ascertain.
Spatially resolved data on infection chains (for example recorded by the the local health agencies
performing the contact tracing) would be of great value in order to quantitatively monitor ξ and, if
an excessive leakiness is found to impede the efficient management of the epidemic, to implement
measures to reduce it. This would only affect cross-region contacts while maintaining freedom for
citizens and small businesses within local regions. Note also that a reduction of cross-regional contacts does not necessarily require restrictions in mobility. Rather, policies could aim at reducing
their potential infectiousness, which could be achieved, e.g., through frequent testing of the involved personnel or special protective equipment similar to that used in the healthcare setting. As
a general principle, our study highlights that the transfer of responsibility to local regions should
always go hand in hand with a close monitoring of cross-regional infections in order not to miss
out on the benefits.
While first treatment options for COVID-19 are starting to emerge [22] and trials for various
vaccine candidates are underway, it is likely that the world will have to live with a simmering
epidemic for a while. In our view, thinking about sustainable long-term strategies is indispensable

discussion on the basis of rigorous predictions.

Appendix
Mathematical model
SIR model with subdivision —

We model the epidemic spreading dynamics by considering

n separate groups or sub-populations with internal SIR dynamics [23] and coupling between the
groups. Let S j and I j with j ∈ 1 . . . n denote the number of susceptible and infected individuals in
group j, respectively, and N j the group size. Let

be the corresponding population totals. As in the original SIR model, we assume that individuals
have a certain total infectious contact rate b = κν, where κ is the number of contacts with a
random other individual per unit time and ν is the probability of infection for a contact between
a susceptible and an infected individual. We denote by α j (I j , I) the probability per unit time for a
single susceptible individual in group j to become infected, and call this quantity the infection rate
in group j in the following. The removal of a single infected individual happens with a constant

rate, k, and can be due to recovery, death or quarantine. We define a leakiness ξ to characterize the
coupling between local groups: a fraction ξ of an individual’s contacts take place with the entire
population, whereas the remaining fraction of 1 − ξ contacts are restricted to the local group. For
this scenario (without containment measures), we therefore have an infection rate for group j of
α j = b[(1 − ξ )I j /N j + ξ I/N],

j ∈ 1 . . . n.

(2)

For ξ = 0, sub-populations are completely decoupled (no cross-infections between groups occur),
whereas for ξ = 1, the original SIR model for the population totals S and I is recovered.

Mean field evolution —

In a large population with a large number of infected individuals in all

sub-populations, deterministic mean field equations capture the dynamics of the epidemic, such
that, for all j ∈ 1 . . . n
dS j
= −α j (I j , I) S j
dt
dI j
= α j (I j , I) S j − k I j .
dt

(3)
(4)

Given a homogeneous initial condition, i.e. with S j /N j = S/N and infected I j /N j = I/N for all
j, α j reduces to b I/N, such that the population totals S and I follow classical SIR dynamics and
homogeneity among the groups is preserved, independent of the value of ξ . For ξ = 1, α j also
reduces to b I/N, i.e. the subdivision structure becomes irrelevant. Since, by definition, the total
infectious contact rate of an individual is always b, it is intuitive that the reproductive number is
R0 = b/k as in the original SIR model, and disease invasion takes place above a critical value of
R0 > 1.
This can be seen rigorously by calculating the average number of infections a single infected individual causes in a fully susceptible population. Let l be the group in which the infected individual
resides. Then Il = 1 and I j = 0 for j 6= l. During some time T , the number of secondary infections

In the last step, we took the large-population limit, where full susceptibility implies S j /N j → 1 for
all j (for j 6= l the equality holds even for finite populations). With the average duration of a single
infection, hT i = 1/k, we get

Applying other ‘threshold theorem’ formalisms for subdivided populations [24, 25] leads to the
same result.

Local lockdown —

During a local lockdown, we assume a reduced contact rate of bl = q2 b,

where 0 < q < 1 is a ‘presence factor’ that indicates the effective availability of an individual
for interactions with other individuals during a lockdown. The purpose of this definition of q is
to be able to associate the reduction in contacts with each class, i.e. susceptibles and infected,
individually, as one of them might be in lockdown, while the other one is not, in the case of crossgroup infections. During a local lockdown of group j, the effective number of susceptible and
infected individuals available for contacts will therefore be reduced to qS j and qI j , respectively.
Group-local interactions between them lead to a contribution
(1 − ξ )b(qS j )(qI j /N j )

(8)

to the infection rate, which simply reduces to (1 − ξ )bl S j I j /N j as expected. To be able to express
the effect of local lockdowns on cross-group infections represented by the second term of Eq. (2),
we further differentiate between the total number of infected I l in all groups that are currently in
lockdown and the corresponding total I f in all groups that are currently free, with I = I f + I l . This
19

leads to an overall rate of infections in group j of
(
b qS j [(1 − ξ )qI j /N j + ξ (I f + qI l )/N] if group j is in lockdown
α jS j =
b S j [(1 − ξ )I j /N j + ξ (I f + qI l )/N] if group j is not in lockdown.

(9)

When a group goes into local lockdown, the reduced availability of its susceptible and infected
members therefore has two effects: (1) for internal contacts, b is reduced to bl , and (2) for crossinfections to/from other groups, the effective rate is reduced and takes an intermediate value between bl and b, which depends on the lockdown state of other groups.
Consequently, if the whole population is in lockdown (I l = I, I f = 0), we have α j = bl [(1 −
ξ )I j /N j + ξ I/N], identical to Eq. (2), with b replaced by bl as intended. Thus, we can associate
the reduced contact rate with a reproduction number
Rl = q2 R0 =

bl
k

during a population-wide lockdown.

Numerical simulation

We carry out exact, stochastic Gillespie simulations [26] of the infection

dynamics in the subdivided population, where susceptible and infected individuals in each group
are treated as a separate species, i.e. for a total of 2n species. The rate for the infection reaction
with (∆S j , ∆I j ) = (−1, 1) is α j S j according to Eq. (9), the rate for the removal reaction with ∆I j =
−1 is kI j . Local lockdown is initiated in group j when I j continuously exceeds the lockdown
threshold Θ j for 14 days, to account for detection uncertainties and reporting delay (see main
text). For relative lockdown thresholds θ specified as the infected fraction of the population, we
set Θ j = θ N j . For absolute thresholds, we set Θ j = Θ for all j with a universal absolute number
of active infections Θ. The lockdown in group j is lifted when I j stays continuously below Θ j
for a specified amount of time τsafety which we call the safety margin. While τsafety has a certain
minimum value because of the same unavoidable processes that delay the detection of a local
outbreak and initiation of lockdown, further increasing τsafety can be an element of the containment
strategy and is therefore up to the policy makers. For the population-wide lockdown strategy, the

threshold and delay criteria are applied to the total number of infected individuals I and lockdown
is initiated/lifted in all groups simultaneously.

Data sources and parameter estimation
Estimation of Rl — During the initial period of the pandemic, many countries enforced a nationwide lockdown for multiple weeks. Infection data for this time frame allows for a straight forward
estimation of the reproduction factor Rl with mitigation strategies in place. We employ the software EpiEstim [27] along with daily case data (up until June 12, 2020) for a time-resolved estimate
of the reproduction number. For Germany, the infection data is retrieved from the Robert-KochInstitute [28] using the REST api [29]. Data for Italy and England were available on respective
government websites [30, 31] and for the US we used data provided by the Johns Hopkins University [1]. We impose a distribution over the serial interval for COVID-19 [32] to make use of
the EpiEstim method uncertain_si. For daily estimates of R a 14-day interval is considered. As is
illustrated in Supp. Fig. 1, we average over the ten lowest daily estimates to extract a reasonable
value for Rl .
Initial conditions and group sizes — To simulate approximations of real countries we gather
official census data on a county level resolution for England [33], Italy [34], the US [35] and
Germany [36] to set up the sub-populations. These data are then combined with the infection
numbers (as of June 12, 2020) to compute the current sizes of the susceptible and infected parts of
the population in each county. Where no information about recoveries is available we approximate
the number of active cases to be equal to all new infections reported within the previous 14 days (a
conservative estimate given our assumed infectious time of 1/k = 7 days, see main text). For more
fine-grained control when investigating the size-dependent effects in the mitigation strategy, the
counties are optionally further subdivided such that no individual group exceeds a certain number
of individuals. Infected individuals are randomly assigned to one of the equally sized sub-groups

Figure 1 Freedom from restrictions through local containment measures. a, Illustration of core model
ingredients: Individuals have contacts with random individuals inside their local sub-population (small arrows),
which is defined, e.g., by a county. A certain proportion of contacts takes place across sub-population boundaries
with random individuals from the whole population (large arrows). This leakiness ξ is defined such that the total
number of contacts an individual has per unit time is a ξ -independent constant, which determines the reproductive
number R0 . If the number of infected individuals (red) in a sub-population exceeds a certain threshold, the subpopulation enters a temporary local lockdown that lowers R0 and infection numbers can decline (red county). A
precise model definition is available in the Appendix. b, Number of days the average person in the population

plotted against their corresponding size, in simulations of the epidemic over the next 5 years. Scatter plot shows
data from 10 realizations of the stochastic dynamics each, for the original German county sizes (red) and further

all for the same relative lockdown threshold of θ = 10 : 100,000. Data for an absolute lockdown threshold of 10
infected individuals for every sub-population regardless of its size is shown in black. The marginal distributions of
the time spent under local lockdowns for individuals across the entire population are displayed on the right hand
side using the same colors. Remaining parameters: R0 = 1.29, ξ = 1%, τsafety = 21. b, Dynamics of infection
numbers for the case of original county sizes (red data points in panel A) in the first 5 years. Infection numbers in
the total German population are shown in the top row. The lower rows show the dynamics in a number of sample
counties A-H, with the population size shown in parentheses. Red shading indicates periods with lockdown, green
shading indicates no lockdown. c, Dynamics in a simulation with large counties further split into equally sized

parameters are identical to those in panel B. Gray areas connecting panels B and 2c indicate the split-up.

Supplementary Figure 4 Absolute comparison of different strategies for Germany. All data represent
averages from 20 simulations. a, Number of days the average person in the population will have to spend under
1
restrictions within the next 5 years under the population-wide
control strategy, using the county structure and
current active case numbers from Germany without further subdivision. Data normalized by the data for ξ = 1,
i.e. a fully interconnected population without subdivision. b, Same as in panel A, but for the local control
strategy.
