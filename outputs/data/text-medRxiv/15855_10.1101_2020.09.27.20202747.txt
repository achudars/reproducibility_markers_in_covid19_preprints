ABSTRACT

51

Rationale

52

Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) is the major complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet optimal respiratory support

53

strategies are uncertain.

54

Objectives

55

To describe outcomes with high-flow oxygen delivered through nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in

56

COVID-19 AHRF and identify individual factors associated with failure.

57

Methods

58

We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 treated with HFNC and/or NIPPV to describe rates of success

59

(live discharge without endotracheal intubation (ETI)), and identify characteristics associated with failure (ETI and/or in-hospital mortality) using

60

Fine-Gray sub-distribution hazard models.

61

Results

62

A total of 331 and 747 patients received HFNC and NIPPV as the highest level of non-invasive respiratory support, respectively; 154 (46.5%) in

63

the HFNC cohort and 167 (22.4%) in the NIPPV cohort were successfully discharged without requiring ETI. In adjusted models, significantly

64

increased risk of HFNC and NIPPV failure was seen among patients with cardiovascular disease (subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 1.82; 95%

65

confidence interval (CI), 1.17-2.83 and sHR 1.40; 95% CI 1.06-1.84), respectively, and among those with lower oxygen saturation to fraction of

66

inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) ratio at HFNC and NIPPV initiation (sHR, 0.32; 95% CI 0.19-0.54, and sHR 0.34; 95% CI 0.21-0.55, respectively).

Conclusions

68

A significant proportion of patients receiving non-invasive respiratory modalities for COVID-19 AHRF achieved successful discharge without

69

requiring ETI, with lower success rates among those with cardiovascular disease or more severe hypoxemia. The role of non-invasive respiratory

70

modalities in COVID-19 related AHRF requires further consideration.

INTRODUCTION

80

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,

81

resulting in over 16.5 million cases and more than 655,000 deaths across 216 countries (1). The burden of cases in the United States has

82

exceeded that of any other country, with New York City as the epicenter of the pandemic at the time of this study, accounting for over 226,000

83

cases as of July 30, 2020 (2). The hallmark of COVID-19 is the development of acute respiratory illness, with a significant number of hospitalized

84

adult patients progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (3-6), and up to 18% ultimately requiring endotracheal intubation (ETI)

85

and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (5-9). Importantly, mortality rates after ETI are substantial, ranging from 65-96% (3, 4, 7, 10).

86
87

While some experts during the pandemic have advocated for early ETI and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (11), the optimal respiratory

88

support strategy for COVID-19 acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) remains unclear (12). Compared to low-flow supplemental oxygen,

89

HFNC improves oxygenation and work of breathing (13) and reduces ETI rates (14-16), while NIPPV may be associated with a lower risk of both

90

ETI and mortality in certain non-COVID-19 populations with AHRF (16). Despite these benefits, some studies have shown that treatment failure

91

with HFNC and NIPPV is associated with worse outcomes, including increased mortality, possibly related to delayed ETI and initiation of IMV (17-

92

19). Reports of outcomes with HFNC and NIPPV in the COVID-19 population, however, remain limited to small case series (20, 21), with

93

significant variability in use of these modalities across centers (3, 9, 10, 22). Accordingly, individual characteristics associated with HFNC and

94

NIPPV failure in COVID-19 AHRF are unknown. Unclear benefits of HFNC and NIPPV have resulted in some experts advocating for avoidance of

95

these modalities in favor of early ETI during the pandemic (23).

96
97

To address this knowledge gap, we sought to describe patterns of HFNC and NIPPV use and outcomes for patients admitted with COVID-19 AHRF

98

within a large New York City academic health system. We subsequently identified specific demographic and clinical characteristics at the time of

99

HFNC and NIPPV initiation that were associated with HFNC and NIPPV failure, highlighting patient subgroups particularly susceptible to poor

100

outcomes with non-invasive respiratory support.

101
102

METHODS

103

Study design and participants

104

This retrospective cohort study included patients admitted to one of five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System, New York City,

105

including a large quaternary referral center, a tertiary care hospital, and three community hospitals, totaling 2,590 beds. The Icahn School of

106

Medicine at Mount Sinai institutional review board approved the study, and the requirement for informed consent was waived due to minimal

107

risk.

108
109

For the descriptive study aim, we included all hospitalized patients between >18 and 100 years of admitted between March 1 and April 28, 2020

110

with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swab samples, and who required HFNC and/or

111

NIPPV prior to achieving an outcome of first ETI, live hospital discharge, or in-hospital mortality (Figure 1). Patients were followed up to May 31,

112

2020. Patients from the descriptive population without missing covariates were included in the analytic subset (Figure 1). For transferred

113

patients, defined as discharged from one of five hospital sites with readmission at another within 12 hours, both admissions were included as a

114

single hospitalization. If a patient was discharged for a period of >12 consecutive hours and subsequently readmitted, only the first admission

115

was considered.

116
117

Data were extracted from electronic databases, including Epic Clarity and Epic Caboodle (Epic Systems Corporation). ETI timings for 400 patients

118

were validated using chart review; only 3 out of 400 (0.75%) showed inconsistencies with the automatically extracted data due to charting

119

errors. Data collected included hospital disposition (either live discharge or death), patient demographics, code status of do-not-intubate (DNI),

120

comorbidities (captured using ICD-10 codes), medications (including anticoagulation therapies and corticosteroids), vital signs, laboratory tests,

121

and treatment with respiratory support devices (nasal cannula, face mask, non-rebreather mask, HFNC, NIPPV (defined as continuous or bilevel

122

positive pressure devices), and/or ETI with IMV). The last recorded vital signs and laboratory values prior to device initiation were selected; if

123

these were not available (for example, if the patient was placed on a device immediately at the time of admission) the measurements occurring

124

soonest after device initiation were selected.

125
126

Outcomes

127

The primary outcome was treatment success, defined as live hospital discharge without need for ETI. Treatment failure was defined as ETI

128

and/or in-hospital mortality, whichever occurred first, to account for patients who may have died before ETI documentation (e.g. during

129

cardiopulmonary resuscitation), or for whom IMV may have been indicated but who died without ETI due to DNI code status. Secondarily, in

130

multivariable models including the subset of patients with non-missing data for covariates included in the main model, we explored specific

131

demographic and clinical characteristics at the time of HFNC or NIPPV initiation that were associated with treatment failure.

132
133

Non-invasive respiratory support cohorts

134

To simplify multiple transitions between HFNC and NIPPV that often take place during hospitalization, each patient was categorized into one of

135

two cohorts based on the highest level of non-invasive respiratory support required prior to outcome (as defined above), or if no outcome was

136

observed, the end of the study period. Accordingly, the HFNC cohort included patients who received HFNC but never NIPPV, while the NIPPV

137

cohort included patients who received NIPPV, or both HFNC and NIPPV at any point between hospital admission and outcome, irrespective of

138

sequence. In addition, timing of initiation and total duration of HFNC and/or NIPPV use from hospital admission to an outcome were calculated.

139
140

Covariates

141

Patient demographics included age, sex, race/ethnicity, and insurance type, as well as hospital site. Clinical factors included comorbidities,

142

smoking status, body mass index (BMI), and DNI code status (if documented prior to HFNC or NIPPV initiation), as well as vital signs, ratio of

143

peripheral blood oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2), and laboratory tests at the time of HFNC or NIPPV initiation.

144

Enrollment into investigational drug trials for COVID-19 was not included as a covariate, as only a portion of those enrolled ultimately received

145

the investigational agent and data regarding specific therapies could not be reported due to embargo.

147

Statistical Analyses

148

Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics at the time of device initiation are presented for both HFNC and NIPPV cohorts. Frequencies

149

and proportions are described for categorical variables and median and interquartile range (IQR) used for continuous measures. We determined

150

detailed follow-up time by outcome subgroups. For each cohort, Fine-Gray competing risk regression models were performed at univariable and

151

multivariable levels to estimate the sub-distribution hazard ratios (sHR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of treatment failure,

152

treating live hospital discharge as a competing risk. Patients were censored if they did not experience an outcome by end of the study period.

153

Covariates in the univariable models with p≤0.15 were entered into multivariable models for each cohort (Table E1). All continuous variables

154

used in models, except for age and temperature, were natural-log transformed to address observed skew in their underlying distributions (a

155

standard procedure in regression models).

156
157

We performed the following sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the outcomes from the main model: (1) Addition of prophylactic- and

158

therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and/or corticosteroids administered prior to device initiation as individual covariates in the multivariable

159

models, as these interventions may have impacted the risk of failure and clinical characteristics may also differ by treatment status; (2) excluding

160

interleukin-6 and BMI, the two covariates with the most missing values, from the multivariable models to increase sample size and better

161

represent the initial study population; and (3) evaluating differences in demographics and clinical characteristics between patients with and

162

without any missing covariates (irrespective of whether they were included in adjusted models). P-values <0.05 were considered statistically

significant. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and R (Version 3.5.0) using Rstudio (Version 1.1.453,

164

RStudio, Inc.).

165
166

RESULTS

167

Population characteristics

168

Of the 1,078 total patients receiving high-level non-invasive respiratory support at any point during their hospitalization, 331 (30.7%) and 747

169

(69.3%) required HFNC and NIPPV, respectively, as their highest level of non-invasive respiratory support with almost half of the NIPPV group

170

receiving both HFNC and NIPPV (316 patients, 42.3%) (Table 1). There was significant variability in HFNC and NIPPV use across hospital sites,

171

ranging from 3.5 to 9.5% for HFNC and 11.0 to 21.6% for NIPPV.

172
173

Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients in the HFNC and NIPPV cohorts are presented in Table 1. In both cohorts, comorbidities,

174

including chronic lung and cardiovascular diseases (Table E2), were common, and distributions of age, sex, and race/ethnicity were similar. At

175

time of HFNC and NIPPV initiation, patients had a median (IQR) SpO2/FiO2 of 98 (93, 125) and 97 (92, 121.4), respectively, suggesting severe

176

hypoxemia. Inflammatory markers were elevated in both groups (Table 1).

177
178

Considering dynamic respiratory support requirements including room air and low flow supplemental oxygen over time for a given patient, the

179

highest time-varying probability of receiving HFNC was 36% among those in the HFNC cohort, occurring between days 5-6 of admission (Figure

11

180

2). Among patients in the NIPPV cohort, the highest time-varying probability of being on NIPPV (31%) occurred within the first day of admission,

181

while HFNC use in the same group was 12% on day 5 of admission (Figure 2).

182
183

Outcomes in the HFNC cohort

184

Out of 331 patients in the HFNC cohort, 154 (46.5%) were successfully discharged without needing ETI during their hospital stay (Figure 3A). Of

185

the 177 (53.5%) who experienced HFNC failure, 100 (56.5%) required ETI and 77 (43.5%) died without ETI. Among the 100 patients who

186

ultimately required ETI, 35 (35.0%) were eventually discharged, 58 (58.0%) died and 7 (7.0%) were censored (Figure 3A). The median (IQR)

187

follow-up time in the overall HFNC cohort from time to device initiation to any of the defined outcomes (failure, success, or the end of study for

188

those who did not experienced failure or successful discharge) was 5.40 (1.00, 10.7) days, and specifically, was 1.36 (0.54, 3.77) days and 10.2

189

(6.72, 15.5) days among those who experienced treatment failure and successful discharge, respectively.

190
191

Factors associated with HFNC failure

192

In multivariable analysis, limited to the subset of patients in the HFNC cohort with complete data for all adjusted covariates (n = 232, 70%), a

193

significantly increased incidence of HFNC failure was observed among patients with cardiovascular disease (sHR 1.82; 95% CI, 1.17-2.83) (Figure

194

4). A lower SpO2/FiO2 ratio also increased the risk of HFNC failure (sHR 0.32; 95% CI, 0.19-0.54), as did a lower platelet count (sHR 0.61; 95% CI,

195

0.43-0.87). Admission to Community hospital C and the tertiary hospital reduced the risk of failure compared to the quaternary referral hospital

196

(sHR 0.55; 95% CI 0.31-0.99, and sHR 0.29; 95% CI, 0.16-0.55, respectively) (Figure 4).

198

Outcomes in the NIPPV cohort

199

Of 747 total patients requiring NIPPV, 167 (22.4%) were successfully discharged without requiring ETI. Of the 572 (76.6%) patients who

200

experienced NIPPV failure, 338 (59.1%) required ETI and 234 (40.9%) died without ETI. Of 338 patients who required ETI, 47 (13.9%) were

201

eventually discharged and 263 (77.8%) died (Figure 3B). The median (IQR) follow-up time for the NIPPV cohort was 4.1 (1.2, 9.1) days, and

202

specifically, was 2.6 (0.8, 6.7) days and 11.2 (6.8, 17.6) days for those with treatment failure and success, respectively.

203
204

Factors associated with NIPPV failure

205

In multivariable analysis limited to the subset of patients in the NIPPV cohort with complete data for all adjusted covariates (n = 408), co-morbid

206

cardiovascular disease and higher interleukin-6 were associated with increased risk of failure (sHR 1.40; 95% CI, 1.07-1.84, and sHR 1.13; 95% CI

207

1.02-1.26, respectively) (Figure 5). Increased risk of failure was also associated with a lower SpO2/FiO2 ratio (sHR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.21-0.55), lower

208

hemoglobin (sHR 0.41; 95% CI, 0.19-0.88), and lower peripheral lymphocyte percentage (sHR 0.74; 95% CI 0.59-0.94).

209
210

Sensitivity analyses

211

In sensitivity analyses where receipt of prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation and/or corticosteroids prior to device initiation were added

212

as covariates, co-morbid cardiovascular disease and lower SpO2/FiO2 ratio remained significantly associated with increased risk of failure in both

213

HFNC (Table E3) and NIPPV cohorts (Table E4). Similarly, despite differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between patients with

214

overall complete vs. incomplete covariate data (Table E5), significant associations between cardiovascular disease and SpO2/FiO2 ratio remained

215

in models where interleukin-6 and BMI were excluded to encompass a larger subset of patients (Tables E3 and E4).

216
217

DISCUSSION

218

This is the largest cohort study in patients with COVID-19 AHRF to date to describe patterns of use and outcomes with non-invasive respiratory

219

support modalities of HFNC and NIPPV. We observed that nearly half of the patients treated with HFNC and one-fifth of the patients treated with

220

NIPPV were successfully discharged without requiring ETI. As outcomes with HFNC and NIPPV were variable, we subsequently identified specific

221

clinical features, e.g. co-morbid cardiovascular disease, associated with increased risk of treatment failure (need for ETI and/or in-hospital

222

mortality). Recognition of these characteristics may help to identify vulnerable patient subgroups at higher risk of failure with non-invasive

223

modalities, thus necessitating closer monitoring. Similarly, more severe hypoxemia was associated with a higher rate of treatment failure in

224

those receiving non-invasive strategies, supporting their consideration primarily in patients with milder disease. Dedicated studies to evaluate

225

the efficacy of non-invasive modalities to reduce risks of ETI and mortality in COVID-19 AHRF are clearly warranted.

226
227

Limited studies of non-invasive respiratory support outcomes in COVID-19 patients report survival rates of 19.5% to 100% with HFNC (4, 20, 21)

228

and 7.7% to 37.7% with NIPPV (3, 4). Although our aim was not to directly compare these non-invasive modalities, we found that a lower

229

proportion of patients receiving NIPPV were successfully discharged compared to HFNC. A higher failure rate among patients receiving NIPPV

230

may be due to higher illness severity or inherent differences in physiologic mechanisms of HFNC and NIPPV for AHRF (24). Specifically, NIPPV

use in non-COVID-19 severe ARDS patients has been shown to result in higher ICU mortality (19), which is potentially attributable to the self-

inflicted lung injury phenomenon of high spontaneous respiratory drive, generation of large tidal volumes, and heterogeneity of ventilation and

233

regional distribution ventilation resulting in uncontrolled, potentially injurious transpulmonary pressures (25). Historically, treatment with NIPPV

234

for H1N1 influenza and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus resulted in high failure rates leading to ETI, and clear benefits of

235

NIPPV use in SARS-CoV-1 have not been established (26). While we observed that a small subset of patients experienced good outcomes with

236

NIPPV, further studies comparing NIPPV with other forms of respiratory support are needed. Importantly, our observation that a subset of

237

patients using non-invasive respiratory support was successfully discharged from hospital without requiring ETI suggests that a uniform

238

approach of early ETI for all patients with COVID-19 AHRF deserves consideration (27-30). Avoidance of unnecessary ETI and IMV is paramount

239

to reduce IMV-associated complications, limit healthcare worker exposure associated with the ETI process (31), and preserve mechanical

240

ventilators in resource-constrained pandemic settings. Thus, the impact of non-invasive respiratory support modalities on reducing risk for ETI

241

and IMV and mortality merits further investigation.

242
243

Closer examination of non-invasive respiratory support use patterns revealed that the highest probabilities of requiring HFNC or NIPPV occurred

244

relatively early in the hospital course, consistent with other studies reporting deteriorating respiratory status and development of ARDS soon

245

after admission (4, 5, 32). Notably, we found that the median time to treatment failure was within two days after initiation of HFNC or NIPPV,

246

highlighting that the immediate period after initiation of non-invasive respiratory support represents a crucial window for clinical deterioration

247

and progression of disease. This is consistent with non-COVID-19 studies which have demonstrated that, for example, a ROX index (ratio of

248

oxygen saturation/FiO2 to respiratory rate) (33), of ≥4.88 after 12 hours of HFNC treatment for AHRF, is associated with a significantly lower

249

likelihood of requiring ETI (33). Furthermore, analysis of a subset of patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS treated with NIPPV from a large,

250

multicenter observational study showed that higher severity of illness, and worse oxygenation and ventilation over the first two days of NIPPV

251

use, were independently associated with the need for ETI (19, 34). Thus, in keeping with recommendations from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign

252

guidelines for COVID-19 (12), close monitoring and frequent reassessment of patients receiving non-invasive respiratory support, particularly

253

immediately after initiation, is essential.

254
255

Notably, we found that comorbid cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmias, was

256

independently and robustly associated with increased risk of both HFNC and NIPPV failure. This finding is consistent with and expands upon

257

other observational studies, which have demonstrated that cardiovascular disease is a common comorbidity among COVID-19 patients treated

258

with non-invasive respiratory support and is associated with poor outcomes (35). This relationship has been hypothesized to stem from viral-

259

mediated cardiac complications, including myocarditis, vascular inflammation with resultant cardiac injury and dysfunction, and new or

260

worsening cardiac arrhythmias (4, 36-39). Our work further highlights patients with cardiovascular disease as a vulnerable subgroup that is

261

susceptible to worse outcomes once initiated on non-invasive respiratory support.

262
263

We also observed other important clinical characteristics associated with HFNC and NIPPV outcomes. As expected, patients with higher severity

264

of illness--as represented by more severe hypoxemia at non-invasive respiratory support initiation--were at significantly higher risk of both HFNC

265

and NIPPV failure. Further characterization of the mechanisms and the extent to which the distribution of gas exchange and regional ventilation

266

can be corrected by non-invasive therapies are needed to better predict disease trajectory and outcomes specific to COVID-19. Additionally,

267

laboratory markers suggestive of more severe immune dysregulation, specifically elevated interleukin-6 and lymphopenia, were independently

268

associated with failure in the NIPPV cohort. Interleukin-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine frequently upregulated in patients with severe COVID-

269

19 as part of a dysregulated immune response, and elevated levels have been suggested to portend worse outcomes, including worsening acute

270

respiratory failure and need for IMV (40, 41). Furthermore, viral-mediated disruption of usual immune function may cause lymphocyte

271

exhaustion and lymphopenia (40), which has been associated with more severe disease and increased mortality (3, 5, 42). Lastly, hospital site

272

influenced outcomes in the HFNC cohort, which may be attributable to differences in patient severity of illness, resources, or capacity strain

273

during pandemic settings. Determination of the cause is beyond the scope of this study but deserves further exploration. Taken together,

274

specific demographic and early clinical characteristics at the time of non-invasive respiratory support initiation may inform clinicians of

275

susceptible subgroups of patients for whom close monitoring and early consideration of alternative management strategies is warranted if clear

276

clinical improvement is not evident.

277
278

Our study has notable strengths. First, this is the largest longitudinal cohort study to date to evaluate outcomes in patients treated with HFNC

279

and NIPPV on COVID-19 AHRF. Second, the granularity of our data enabled capture of accurate longitudinal data representing time-varying

280

laboratory results, vital signs and oxygenation status, and allowed us to map outcome trajectories associated with these devices. Third, the

281

diversity of our cohort, drawn from hospital sites representing distinct communities, improves the generalizability of our findings to other

282

COVID-19 populations. Fourth, we explored potential bias with several sensitivity analyses, accounting for patients with missing data and the

283

impact of anticoagulation and corticosteroids on the main analysis. Finally, we had a minimal number of censored patients, improving the

284

reliability of our outcomes.

285
286

This study also has several limitations. As an observational study, we cannot draw conclusions on the utility of HFNC and NIPPV compared to

287

low-flow supplemental oxygen. However, our study provides a strong basis for further efforts, including case-control studies and randomized

288

controlled trials to investigate the efficacy of non-invasive respiratory support in reducing risks of ETI and mortality. Additionally, we chose to

289

focus on factors at the time of HFNC or NIPPV initiation associated with treatment outcome and did not address the impact of subsequent

290

changes in clinical characteristics or treatments administered. We were also limited to using SpO2/FiO2 ratios to approximate degree of

291

hypoxemia (43), for which accurate interpretation of severity may be limited as arterial blood gases were unavailable for most patients.

292

Furthermore, we did not account for HFNC flow rates and NIPPV inspiratory/expiratory pressures, which may have influenced outcomes. Finally,

293

we did not assess healthcare worker infectious exposure risk, though prior studies of healthcare workers exposed to SARS-CoV 1 patients on

294

HFNC or NIPPV did not report significantly higher transmission risk (44, 45) and in a COVID-19 simulation study, the exhaled air dispersion during

295

well-fitted HFNC and CPAP use was limited (46).

A subset of patients treated with HFNC and/or NIPPV achieved hospital discharge without requiring ETI and IMV, suggesting that some patients

299

with COVID-19 AHRF can be managed effectively with these respiratory support modalities. Attention to specific demographic and early clinical

300

factors, such as co-morbid cardiovascular disease and severity of hypoxemia, may help inform use of non-invasive respiratory strategies,

301

allowing for a more personalized approach to the management of AHRF in pandemic settings.
