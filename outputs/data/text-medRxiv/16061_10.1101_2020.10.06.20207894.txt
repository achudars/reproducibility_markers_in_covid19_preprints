ABSTRACT

36

Despite the vast scientific evidence obtained from the genomic sequencing of COVID-19, a

37

controversy regarding its origin has been created in the mass media. This could potentially have

38

a long-term influence on the behavior among individuals, such as failure to comply with

39

proposed social distancing measures, leading to a consequent rise in the morbidity and mortality

40

rates from COVID-19 infection. Several studies have collected information about knowledge,

41

attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19; however, very little is known about the relationship

42

of the perceptions of the individuals regarding the origin of the virus with the knowledge and

43

perception about social distancing. This study aimed at ascertaining this relationship. For such

44

purpose, a web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample population from five

45

provinces of the Dominican Republic within the period of June to July of 2020. The data

46

collection instrument exploited in the study was a self-designed questionnaire distributed

47

throughout different social media platforms. A purposive sampling strategy was implemented

48

and a total of 1195 respondents completed the questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed

49

using SPSS. Descriptive statistics, stepwise multiple linear regression and one-way multivariate

50

analysis were implemented to test the hypotheses. The level of education was significantly

51

associated (P = 0.017) with individuals’ perception about the origin of COVID-19, whilst only

52

age (P = 0.032) and education level (P < 0.001) statistically significantly predicted ‘knowledge

53

about social distancing’. Perception of COVID-19 origin was statistically significant associated

54

(P = < 0.001) with the measures of the dependent variables (knowledge and perception on social

55

distancing). The present study has established a possible link between the ‘perception of

56

COVID-19 origin’ and ‘the perception and knowledge about social distancing’.

INTRODUCTION

58

Following the bubonic plague, there has been myriad well-recognized epidemics and pandemics

59

worldwide [1,2], which have recorded a rapid increase in morbidity and mortality rates coupled

60

with a disruption in the dynamics of environmental, ecological and socio-economic factors

61

among humans [2,3]. Recent occurring pandemics are zoonotic in nature [3] due to the rapid

62

growth rate among both the human and animal populations, thereby bridging the transmission

63

gap between the two and consequently easing the expansion of such zoonotic infections globally

64

[4,5]. In 2019, a brand-new viral infection emerged in Wuhan, China [6] caused by the

65

coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19. The infection has been declared in the

66

current year as a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern '' and has posteriorly

67

become a pandemic [7].

68

The coronavirus family is characterized by a low fidelity RNA polymerase, nucleic acids with a

69

high recombination frequency and an unusual extended genome, which facilitate their diversity

70

and the emergence of viruses that can easily adapt to new hosts and environments [8-10]. The

71

genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has been documented to be akin to SARS-CoV [11].

72

Following the foregoing discovery, many other β-coronaviruses have been identified in both bats

73

and humans. Notable among them was the BatCoV RaTG13 (isolated from Rhinopulus affinis),

74

which shares about 96% of its genomic sequence with the novel SARS-CoV-2 [12,13]. Further,

75

Pangolin-CoV harbored in Guangdong pangolins was again noted to have a genomic sequence

76

very similar [12,14] to the amino acid residues of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-

77

CoV-2 [13,15]. BatCoV RaTG13 [15], on the other hand, shares only one amino acid residue in

78

the RBD as that of the novel coronavirus, despite sharing 96% homology otherwise. Moreover, a

79

scientific theory published in a pre-printed repository vis-à-vis the origin of COVID-19 [16]

80

found shared amino acids with those of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) in the

81

genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2. The validity of such findings was immediately questioned

82

and dismissed by several researchers, which subsequently led to a formal retraction by the

83

authors and a withdrawal of the paper from the repository [17]. However, despite the withdrawal

84

of the article and the reassurance made by other scientists who verified the genomic sequence of

85

SARS-CoV-2 and the natural origin of the virus [18,19] these findings spread in the news and

86

social media around the world, generating more controversy and reinforcing existing unofficial

87

and popularly disseminated theories that established that the virus “leaked from a laboratory in

88

Wuhan” and is probably a product of genetic manipulation in an effort to discover a vaccine for

89

HIV-1[20-22].

90

In a short period of time, millions of infections and thousands of deaths have been reported from

91

SARS-CoV-2 around the world. In the Dominican Republic, more than 100,000 cases have been

92

recently reported with a case fatality ratio of 1.9% and a tendency to increase, similar to other

93

countries of the region [23]. Owing to the ease of person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-

94

2, a non-pharmacological intervention deemed ‘social distancing’ is currently being practiced to

95

minimize spread of the virus [24]. Conventionally, early and sustained imposition of these

96

interventions have been demonstrated to reduce mortality rates and flatten the epidemiologic

97

curve significantly among varied countries, such as the United States, during the last registered

98

pandemic in 1918 [25-26]. Currently, early interventions like social distancing have significantly

99

limited the effects and slowed the transmission of COVID-19 in its stage of epidemic in

100

mainland China [27] and New Zealand [28]. Among the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic has

101

adapted the mandatory usage of nose masks in public places, as well as the suspension of small

102

businesses, public transportation and a 10 hours’ curfew (7 p.m.-5 a.m.) as an additional measure

103

to strengthen the social distancing protocols in an attempt to flatten the epidemiologic curve [29].

104

Despite these measures to contain the spread of the virus, some rule-breaking events have still

105

occurred [30,31].

106

Various observational studies have been performed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and

107

perceptions about COVID-19 among healthcare workers and the general populace, and some of

108

them assess the perception and knowledge about the origin of COVID-19 and social distancing

109

[32-35], yet very little literature exists on the relationship between an individual’s understanding

110

of social distancing and their perceptions regarding the origin of SARS-CoV-2; it is possible that

111

the controversy revolving around the origin of COVID-19 in the mass media is influencing the

112

perceptions and knowledge about social distancing of the general population. This study sheds

113

light on this issue and therefore was conducted to verify the hypothesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

116
117

Study area and sampling technique

118
119

This web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among five provinces of the Dominican

120

Republic population within a period of June to July, 2020. The data collection instrument was an

121

online administered questionnaire. Five provinces included in the study were described as the

122

Ozama region (comprising Santo Domingo and the National District), Santiago, La Vega and

123

Duarte. The study area was chosen due to the significant mortality trend from COVID-19

124

[36,37]. Overall, a total of 1195 participants who completed the survey questionnaire were

125

included for the study. Purposive sampling was adopted for participants’ recruitment from the

126

targeted provinces.

127

Data collection instrument

128
129

The data collection instrument exploited in the study was a short and precise web-based self-

130

designed questionnaire containing closed-ended questions adapted to the target population. The

131

closed-ended items enabled to obtain specific responses from the respondents. The questionnaire

132

comprised four sections: the first section (6 items) obtained sociodemographic data from the

133

respondents, the second section (2 items), third section (1 item) and the fourth section (2 items)

134

were designed to obtain information on the ‘perception of COVID-19 origin’, ‘perception of

135

social distancing’ and ‘knowledge of social distancing’, respectively. An open-ended question

136

about the year of birth was included with the purpose of confirming the age of the participants,

137

due to the easy access that adolescents have to the internet in the Dominican Republic, according

138

to our experience. A pilot study utilising 65 respondents was conducted prior to the actual data

139

collection. To avoid instrumentation which introduces bias to the research, participants’ data for

140

the pilot testing were not selected again for the main study.

141

Data collection procedure

142
143

A SurveyMonkeyTM collector web link containing the self-designed questionnaire was distributed

144

among participants from the study site at the time of data collection. Individuals aged ≥ 18 years

145

and only from the Dominican Republic were eligible for participating in the study. The survey

146

link was sent as a message via the social media platforms WhatsAppTM, FacebookTM and

148

Dominican Republic populace [38,39].

149

Statistical analysis

150

Collected data from SurveyMonkeyTM was exported into an excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel

151

365®, 2016) for data cleaning, and the dataset was analyzed using SPSS software (IBM SPSS®

152

version 21). Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) were computed to describe the

153

perception and knowledge about the origin of COVID-19 among the study participants, whilst

154

frequencies and percentages were performed to describe the sociodemographic variables (gender,

155

age, province, educational level and monthly income). Stepwise multiple linear regression

156

(MLR) was adopted to estimate the perception of COVID-19 origin using selected

157

sociodemographic variables (gender, age, educational level and income) as predictor variables.

158

Further, one-way multivariate analysis of variance (one-way MANOVA) was performed to

159

determine whether any differences existed between independent groups on more than one

160

continuous dependent variable. The dependent variables were described as ‘perception and

161

knowledge on social distancing’ and the independent variable was ‘perception of COVID-19

162

origin’. For the purpose of the present study, a P value less than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval

163

(P < 0.05) was deemed statistically significant.

participants were recorded as categorical values in this order: > 25-44 years (n = 630, 52.2%), >

170

45-64 years (n = 284, 23.8%), > 18-24 years (n = 211, 17.7%), > 65 years (n = 70, 5.9%). The

171

overall average age was documented as the mean value 2.18 (± 0.786), thus falling in the age

172

range 25-44 years. About 244 (20.4%) of the respondents originated from Santiago, 723(60.5%)

173

from Santo Domingo and the National District, 124 (10.4%) from La Vega and 104(8.7) from

174

Duarte. Regarding education level, 93(7.8%) were in primary school, 247(20.7%) in secondary

175

or elementary school, 95(7.9%) had technical/vocational degree, 611(51.1%) were university

176

students, 101(8.5%) had professional degree, 41(3.4%) had master’s degree and only 7(0.6%)

177

had doctorate (PhD) degree. The household income in Dominican Pesos (DOP) was also

178

explored. 440 (36.8%) of the respondents earned less than RD$ 41,164 (DOP) per month (low

179

income), 46 (3.8%) and 335 (28%) of the respondents earned exactly RD$ 41,164 (DOP) per

180

month (average income) and more than RD$ 41,164 (DOP) per month (high income),

181

respectively. About 217 (18.2%) did not know their monthly income whilst 157(13.1%) decided

182

to keep their monthly income confidential. Distribution of sociodemographic characteristics

distancing). Since the scales were five-point Likert-type scales format, three (3), the mid-value,

194

was chosen as an average value so that, mean scores below it, were considered a poor response

195

and vice versa. Further, the analyses of the responses were computed in terms of the percentage

196

of the respondents who either “Affirmed” or “Rejected” a given statement. If the summation

197

percentage of respondents who indicated ‘mostly true’ or ‘true’ (or ‘strongly agree’ or ‘agree’)

198

exceeded the percentage of active respondents who revealed ‘mostly false’ or ‘false’ (or

199

‘strongly disagree’ or ‘disagree’), then the statement was said to have been “Affirmed” in the

200

study and vice versa.

201

Our study showed that 332 (27.8%) of the respondents affirmed that ‘COVID-19 is a virus that

202

comes from the interaction between bat and pangolin (a carnivorous animal from Guangdong,

203

China), and may later become capable of producing disease in humans (S1)’. About 517

(43.2%) of the study participants, ‘COVID-19 is a virus whose genes were handled by scientists

205

inside a laboratory in Wuhan, China in order to discover a vaccine against the Human

206

Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/ AIDS) and that accidentally escaped from that laboratory (S2)’.

207

A greater proportion of the respondents (n = 1079, 90.3%) affirmed that ‘Social distancing

208

measures are effective in the reduction of the transmission and spread of COVID-19 infection’.

238

This study further estimated the relationship between the “perception of COVID 19 origin” and

239

“knowledge and perception on social distancing”. The dependent variables were described as

240

“knowledge and perception on social distancing” and the predictor variable or the independent

241

variable was documented as “perception of COVID 19 origin”. A P value of less than 0.05 (P <

242

0.05) was considered statistically significant.

243

Using an alpha level of 0.05 (95% confidence interval), we observe that the MANOVA test

244

produced a statistically significant result; Wilk’s Lamba = 0.967, F (4, 1190) = 5.105, P <0.001.

245

This significant F indicates that there are significant differences among the “perception of

246

COVID 19 origin” groups on a linear combination of the two dependent variables (knowledge

247

and perception on social distancing). This disclosure explicates that perception of COVID-19

248

origin were statistically significant (P = <0.001) with the measures of the dependent variables

249

(knowledge and perception on social distancing). Distribution of the Multivariate test is

250

presented in Table 4.

Since the MANOVA test was significant, we then examined the univariate ANOVA results to

256

look at the association between the awareness of social distancing and the origin of COVID-19.

257

Follow-up univariate ANOVAs indicated that both knowledge and perception on social

258

distancing were statistically significantly different for participants’ perception about the origin of

259

COVID 19; F (4, 1190) = 5.370, P = <0.001, multivariate ŋ2 (partial eta squared) = 0.018 and F

260

(4, 1190) = 4.685, P = 0.001, multivariate ŋ2 (partial eta squared) = 0.016 respectively. The

261

partial eta squared of 0.018 and 0.016 explains that only 1.8% and 1.6% of the multivariate

262

variance in the dependent variable; perception and knowledge of social distancing, respectively,

263

is associated with the group factor (perception of COVID-19 origin). Distribution on the follow-

DISCUSSION

273

To date, no research has been conducted in the Dominican Republic focusing on associations

274

between the perceptions about the origin of COVID-19 and the knowledge and perception about

275

social distancing among the general population. Therefore, the present study was conducted to

276

ascertain the associations between the triage (perceptions regarding the origin of COVID-19,

277

knowledge about social distancing and perception about social distancing), as well as the

278

socioeconomic status of the population.

279

The results of the study indicate that the majority of the participants’ perception is ‘COVID-19

280

emerged from genetic manipulation by scientists within a laboratory in Wuhan, China, whose

16

281

purpose was to produce a vaccine against HIV, and spread from an accidental escape’ [16,19-

282

22], while the remaining minority of the individuals’ perception is ‘COVID-19 emerged from

283

the genetic interactions between bat’s and pangolin’s genomic, and may later become capable of

284

producing infection in humans’[8-15].

285

Most of the participants perceived social distancing as an effective preventative measure for

286

COVID-19 infection and have ample knowledge about it, results that match those of other

287

studies such as that of Taghrir et al.[40]. Since social media outlets have been the primary

288

reported source for research of information regarding COVID-19 by participants in similar

289

studies [34], our findings suggest that the message about social distancing is being propagated

290

correctly via social media, the news and, most importantly, international health organizations

291

[24]. Interestingly, however, this is the same way misinformation about conspiracy and

292

contradicting scientific theories regarding the origin of COVID-19 have also been reproduced

293

[20-22].

294

A significant association was found between those that perceived the origin of the virus coming

295

from manipulation within a laboratory and their knowledge and perception about social

296

distancing, supporting our hypothesis that there is a relationship between these variables.

297

Although we cannot specifically prove a causal association, these results suggest that the

298

controversy surrounding the origin of COVID-19 and the misinformation disseminated through

299

mass media may also influence other aspects related to individuals’ perceptions and their

300

behavior towards the virus, such as the lack of compliance to government protocols [35,41] and

301

social distancing. These perceptions may also promote distrust in the scientific community, a

302

matter that scientists have tried to raise awareness about [42-47].

303

Most of the participants in this study were young university students, followed by those with a

304

professional degree. Interestingly, among the sociodemographic characteristics reported, the

305

educational level was the only variable significantly associated with the perceptions about the

306

origin of COVID-19, while both educational level and age were, at the same time, found to be

307

associated with the knowledge about social distancing. However, the variations in the

308

perceptions about the origin of COVID-19 and the knowledge about social distancing within the

309

sample were only 0.9% to 3.2%, respectively, a result that reveals, perhaps, that other

310

sociodemographic factors were not considerably correlated with these variables. These findings

311

contradict those of Bhagavathula [34], where factors such as a professional degree and age of

312

participants were found to be significantly associated with a poor perception and knowledge

313

regarding COVID-19. Further, our findings differ from those in the study of Morinha et. al [35],

314

where the lower the educational level, the more the individuals considered the virus a result of

315

genetic manipulation within a scientific laboratory.

316

Particularly, the results of our study may suggest that the lack of education level is not the main

317

factor related to perceptions regarding the source of the virus. We think that this phenomenon,

318

resembling the ‘polarization effect’, may support the tendency of individuals with a higher

319

educational level and greater knowledge in science to have more polarized beliefs [48]; a

320

propensity that could be incited by the way the information regarding the origin of COVID-19 is

321

being reproduced in the media. Nonetheless, it is important to highlight that our study differs in

322

several aspects compared to the aforementioned studies, such as the scenario where their

323

research was conducted, and the target populations, and therefore, their results may be not

324

reproducible to our study´s setting. Further, the data collected about these variables may suggest

325

that other sociodemographic factors could be potentially involved with the knowledge and

326

perception about social distancing. Further studies are necessary to be conducted to help clarify

327

these surprising findings.

328

Study limitations

329

A web-based approach was adopted for the purposes of collecting data from the participants.

330

Hence the data collection was made through varied social media platforms which is relatively

331

less utilized among the aged and persons with low socioeconomic background. This approach

332

albeit regarded as an effective and innovative considering the current pandemic situation [49]

333

may introduce a high level of biasness among the group of selected participants for the study.

334

For instance, among the Dominican Republic populace, the average profile of social media users

335

comprises young people from urban areas with a relatively high socioeconomic status compared

336

to the average in other countries of the region [38,39]. Further, about 32.5% of the overall

337

Dominican population do not have access to the internet [50]. This directly implies, this group of

338

the population will be unfairly ruled out automatically. Similar drawbacks have been elaborated

339

by previous researchers [49,51]. Furthermore, another limitation was the difficulty in finding

340

current information about the total population of the country and the national income per capita

341

in public databases; however, for this purpose, data available from the national office of statistics

342

[37] and the central bank of the Dominican Republic [52,53] was used to obtain the most

343

accurate estimation of these values.

344

Nevertheless, a self-administered online questionnaire is not only an effective and innovative

345

tool at the forefront of the current situation, but provides a relatively feasible monitoring of

346

potential non-respondents, as well as a reduction in the implementation time of the collection

347

instrument, the overall cost of the study [51] and, most importantly, allows compliance with

348

social distancing and other preventive measures imposed by the Dominican government

349

authorities to reduce COVID-19 infection.

350

351

CONCLUSIONS

352

Our study strongly suggests that more attention needs to be paid to the misinformation regarding

353

the origin of COVID-19 in social media and the news. Further variables are also warrant

354

studying, such as the attitudes of the participants towards social distancing, in order to find

355

associations with these factors and their perceptions about the origin of COVID-19. We

356

acknowledge that inquiring into the perceptions of people from rural areas is also of vital

357

importance and is a matter that demands more research.
