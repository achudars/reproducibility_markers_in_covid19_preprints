Abstract:

8

Background: COVID-19 found the world in a state of unpreparedness. While research efforts to

9

develop a vaccine are on-going, others have suggested the use of available vaccines to boost innate

10

immunity.

11

Objective: We analysed three databases: UNICEF Immunization Coverage, Worldometer Corona

12

Virus Updates and World Bank List of Economies to establish the association, if any, between

13

vaccination for various diseases and COVID-19 death rates and recoveries across world economies.

14

Results: Mean percentage death rates were lower in countries that vaccinated for Hepatitis-B birth

15

dose (2.53% vs 3.79%, p = 0.001), Bacille Calmette-Guérin Vaccine (2.93% vs 5.10%, p = 0.025) and

16

Inactivated Polio Vaccine 1st dose (2.8% vs 4.01%, p = 0.022) than those which did not report

17

vaccination. In high income countries, a significant negative correlation with death rates was

18

observed with vaccination for Measles-containing vaccine 2nd dose (r = -0.290, p = 0.032), Rubella-

19

containing vaccine 1st dose (r= -0.325, p = 0.015), Hepatitis B 3rd dose (r = -0.562, p = 3.3 x10-5),

20

Inactivated Polio vaccine 1st dose (r = -0.720, p = 0.008). Inactivated Polio Vaccine 1st dose and

21

Measles-containing vaccine 2nd dose also correlated with better recoveries. In Low Income countries,

22

only Rubella-containing vaccine correlated with lower deaths while Yellow fever vaccine was

23

associated with poorer recoveries.

24

Conclusion: Our analysis corroborates the potential benefit of vaccination and warrant further

25

research to explore the rationale for repurposing other vaccines to fight COVID-19.

Introduction

31

A number of recent publications have raised conversations regarding the potential benefits of BCG

32

vaccine in mitigating the adverse effects of SARS COV-2 infection(1, 2). Such hypotheses were inspired

33

by past reports where BCG vaccination was observed to have benefits beyond prevention of

34

tuberculosis alone. These included protection against some viral infections(3) as well as overall

35

reduction in childhood mortality occasioned by other infectious agents(4). A recent publication based

36

on country policies reported that countries with a long history of BCG vaccination experienced lower

37

numbers of SARS COV-2 infections and fewer deaths(1). Another study found a strong correlation

38

between the BCG index and reduced COVID-19 mortalities in European countries (5).

39

While most vaccines confer immunity through antigen-specific immune responses, some reports

40

suggest that vaccination against one disease may confer protection against another, as evidenced in

41

the upregulation of a wide range of innate immune responses to BCG vaccine(6). This phenomenon is

42

attributed to the development of “trained” immunity, in which BCG-activated monocytes are primed

43

to produce more cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF(2).

44

In fact, other investigators have reported increased expression of pathogen-associated molecular

45

patterns on cells of monocytic origin up to one year after exposure to BCG, enabling a more robust

46

induction of TH1/Th17 responses(7). BCG vaccination was also noted to enhance production of such

47

cytokines as IFN-ƴ, IL-2 and IL-12, which are important for potentiation of cell mediated immunity(8).

48

The above notwithstanding, other investigators have cast doubt on the potential benefits of BCG

49

vaccination in the fight against COVID-19(9).

50

The afore-mentioned discussions have inevitably culminated on the debate to consider the potential

51

prophylactic use of BCG against COVID-19(10), with some data corroborating the anti-COVID-19

52

effect(11). In the current report, we analysed global vaccination coverage and global COVID-19 data

53

to determine if any association existed between the degree of vaccine coverage and the death rates

54

attributed to COVID-19, as well as recovery rates.

55

Methods:

56

We studied global vaccination coverages as reported by UNICEF(12) and compared them to COVID-19

57

deaths and recoveries across the world as reported on the Worldometer(13). These vaccines included

58

the measles-containing-vaccine first dose (MCV1), measles-containing vaccine second dose (MCV2),

59

Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine – 3rd Dose (PCV3), Rubella-containing vaccine first dose (RCV1),

60

Rotavirus-containing vaccine, (RotaCV), Diphtheria and tetanus toxoid and pertussis-containing

61

vaccine (DTP3), Hepatitis B vaccine – Birth dose (HepB_BD), Hepatitis B third dose (HepB3),

62

Haemophilus influenzae type b-containing vaccine (HibV), Bacille Calmette-Guérin Vaccine (BCG),

63

inactivated Polio virus vaccine (IPV) and Yellow fever vaccine (YFV).

64

The death rate for each country was computed as the total number of deaths per million divided by

65

the total number of confirmed cases per million, expressed as a percentage. The independent samples

66

t-test was used to compare the mean percentage of COVID-19 deaths between countries that

67

reported vaccinations and those which did not, using data extracted on the 3rd August 2020 from the

68

COVID-19 Worldometer. Death and recovery data were available for 168 and 175 countries,

69

respectively. However, some vaccination data was missing for some countries and this resulted in

70

different sample sizes as reflected in the analyses. Mean vaccination coverages were correlated with

71

recovery and death rates where such vaccination data was available. Otherwise we compared country

72

death rates and recoveries according to categories of whether vaccine data was reported or not. Data

73

was also disaggregated according to the World Bank economic classification (June 2020)(14).

74

Results

75

The mean death rate (±sd) from COVID-19 for 168 countries was 3.2±3.5% with a range of 0.06-29.3%,

76

while the mean recovery rate for 175 countries was 68.2±22.3%. Recoveries ranged from 8-100%. The

77

results showing a comparison of mean COVID-19 death rates between vaccinating and non-

78

vaccinating countries is shown in Table 1. Only Hepatitis B-BD, BCG and IPV (p= 0.01, p=0.025 and

79

p=0.022, respectively) showed significant differences in mean COVID-19 death rates across vaccinating

Discussion

117

We undertook an analysis of COVID-19 deaths and recoveries in light of immunization with various

118

vaccines to determine the association, if any, of vaccination in mitigating the adverse outcomes of

119

infection with the SARS CoV-2 virus. Vaccination with Hepatitis B birth dose, BCG and inactivated Polio

120

vaccine were associated with lower Covid-19 deaths. This is consistent with other reports where BCG

121

vaccination was associated with lower mortalities and severity of the disease(1, 5). We also observed

122

a weak but significant correlation suggesting that COVID-19 deaths are generally lower in countries

123

where vaccination for BCG, Rubella-containing vaccines and Hepatitis B 3rd dose are given. Moreover,

124

we observed that vaccine coverage, rather than the longevity of use, has a better correlation with

125

percent deaths attributed to COVID-19.

126

We note that death or recovery is also a function of the effectiveness of the health care system in any

127

country. We presumed that higher income countries would generally afford better health care

128

systems and therefore better recoveries and lower deaths.

129
130

Paradoxically, percent recoveries were significantly higher in non-vaccinating countries for

131

Pneumococcal Conjugate vaccine (PCV), RotaCV and Hepatitis B-3 vaccines. We hypothesize that if

132

vaccines, as has been established, promote innate immunity (4, 7, 15, 16), then both death rates and

133

recoveries should be expected to be favourable in vaccinated individuals. However, since recovery

134

includes individuals who must have been hospitalized for symptomatic presentation or those who

135

tested positive but never needed to recover since they were asymptomatic, those with competent

136

immune systems would not be expected to be hospitalized, and would therefore be under-

137

represented among documented recoveries. We propose that this under-representation may account

138

for the higher recoveries in non-vaccinating countries for the specified vaccines.

139
140

There is evidence suggesting that vaccination against tuberculosis, and other vaccinations presented

141

in this work, could provide protection or ameliorate the severity of COVID-19 deaths. Given the gravity

142

of the current COVID-19 threat and the relative unpreparedness of most developing countries, we

143

strongly recommend coordinated clinical trials on vaccination or revaccination as an additional

144

strategy to mitigate the effects of COVID-19. This may imply carrying out clinical trials in designated

145

areas, especially in countries such as Botswana, where the pandemic is still evolving.

146
147

Study limitations

148
149

Our study has several limitations. There could be confounding factors in our data that affect both

150

vaccination coverage and COVID-19 deaths such as genetic diversity, age of population, prevalence of

151

comorbidities, global traveling, population density and quality of health care services. While we did

152

not test for causal effects of vaccination coverage on COVID-19 death rates, we observe that our

153

findings corroborate earlier reports on the potential of other vaccines in mitigating the deleterious

154

effects of COVID-19.

155

Another potential limitation is the fact that the disease is still developing in many countries, so the

156

true resilience of many countries is still to be tested. It is also not clear how to interpret lower

157

recoveries especially in view of the different definitions of recovery. In Botswana, for example,

158

recovery was initially defined in the context of two successive nucleic acid tests at least twenty four

159

hours apart. The current definition now relies on the clinical manifestations and age of the infection.

160

Nevertheless, the data seems to corroborate reports alluding to potential benefit of BCG of some

161

vaccines against COVID-19.
