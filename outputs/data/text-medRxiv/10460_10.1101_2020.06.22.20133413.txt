Abstract

43

Introduction

44

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to respiratory failure due to severe immune

45

response. Treatment targeting this immune response might be beneficial but there is limited

46

evidence on its efficacy.

47

The aim of this study was to determine if early treatment of patients with COVID-19

48

pneumonia with tocilizumab and/or steroids was associated with better outcome.

49

Methods

50

This observational single-center study included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who

51

were not intubated and received either standard of care (SOC, controls) or SOC plus early

52

(within 3 days from hospital admission) anti-inflammatory treatment. SOC consisted of

53

hydroxychloroquine 400mg bid plus, in those admitted before March 24th, also

54

darunavir/ritonavir. Anti-inflammatory treatment consisted of either tocilizumab (8mg/kg

55

intravenously or 162mg subcutaneously) or methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg for 5 days or both.

56

Failure was defined as intubation or death, and the endpoints were failure-free survival

57

(primary endpoint) and overall survival (secondary) at day 30. Difference between the groups

58

was estimated as Hazard Ratio by a propensity score weighted Cox regression analysis

59

(HROW).

60

Results

61

Overall, 196 adults were included in the analyses. They were mainly male (67.4%), with

62

comorbidities (78.1%) and severe COVID-19 pneumonia (83.7%). Median age was 67.9

63

years (range, 30-100) and median PaO2/FiO2 200 mmHg (IQR 133-289). Among them,

64

130 received

65

methylprednisolone (n=45, 34.6%), or both (n=56, 43.1%). The adjusted failure-free survival

66

among tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC treated patients vs. SOC was 80.8% (95%CI,

67

72.8-86.7) vs. 64.1% (95%CI, 51.3-74.0), HROW 0.48, 95%CI, 0.23-0.99; p=0.049. The

Conclusion

71

Early adjunctive treatment with tocilizumab, methylprednisolone or both may improve

72

outcomes in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Introduction

79

Pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has

80

recently emerged [1]. Although most of the infected patients will remain asymptomatic or

81

develop mild symptoms, up to 20% may develop severe disease with pneumonia and

82

respiratory failure [2]. Oxygen administration is the cornerstone of supportive treatment and

83

is required in approximately 15% of cases, while invasive mechanical ventilation is necessary

84

in up to 5-7% of severe cases [3-5]. Since mortality in patients with invasive ventilation can

85

be very high, halting the progression from moderate to severe respiratory failure should

86

reduce the mortality in COVID-19 [6].

87

At the beginning of COVID-19 pandemics, based on the experience with previous studies in

88

viral pneumonia, including SARS-CoV and MERS, the use of steroids was discouraged,

89

mainly due to undocumented benefit and fearing potential increase in viral proliferation and

90

side effects [7, 8]. However, with the increasing knowledge about COVID-19, a biphasic

91

model of the disease has been proposed [9, 10]. According to this model, the first phase is

92

caused directly by viral replication, while in the second phase, the symptoms and respiratory

93

failure are due to inflammatory response, and could be treated with agents which reduce

94

inflammation, such as corticosteroids, or inhibitors of pro-inflammatory interleukins and

95

Janus kinase (JAK) [9-11].

96

Indeed, some real life experiences in COVID-19 patients showed that the use of anti-

97

inflammatory treatments might be beneficial [12]. In fact, short-term steroid therapy was

98

associated with lower mortality in 201 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome

99

(ARDS) [13]. Additionally, following the data on presence of inflammatory cytokine storm in

100

severe COVID-19, tocilizumab use has been advocated. This monoclonal antibody, which

101

binds to interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor and blocks the IL-6 mediated inflammatory response, is

102

approved for treatment of rheumatologic disorders and cytokine-release syndrome associated

with Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) administration. It was reported to reduce

104

COVID-19-associated inflammation, and was approved in China for this indication [12, 14].

105

Based on the first evidences, we formulated the hypothesis of potential benefit of anti-

106

inflammatory treatment, and progressively modified our therapeutic approach to COVID-19.

107

We started using tocilizumab in patients with respiratory failure, and subsequently, we

108

introduced into our protocol early administration of methylprednisolone treatment, followed

109

in more severe cases by the administration of tocilizumab.

110

We hypothesized that outcomes such as no need for intubation and survival of patients with

111

severe COVID-19 pneumonia in whom tocilizumab and/or methylprednisolone were

112

administered in addition to standard of care (SOC) could be better than in those who received

113

only SOC.

Patients and methods

116

Setting and patients

117

In this observational single-center study, adult patients admitted to the San Martino

118

University Hospital, Genova, Italy, for COVID-19 pneumonia were included as cases if

119

treated with tocilizumab and/or methylprednisolone, not intubated, not treated with remdesivir

120

and not pregnant. The outcomes of patients treated with tocilizumab/methylprednisolone were

121

compared to data from consecutive patients admitted to our hospital for COVID-19

122

pneumonia who received only SOC, mainly because they were admitted before the routine

123

use of tocilizumab/methylprednisolone (control group).

124

All patients provided an informed consent for treatment with off label agents according to the

125

local protocol approved by Hospital Authorities, for data collection and for participation in

126

the study. The study was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of

127

Helsinki and approved by the Regional Ethic Committee (N. CER Liguria 114/2020-ID

128

10420).

129

Data collection and definitions

130

Data were collected from hospital information system by a standard based automatic

131

procedure and stored in an online database with pseudo-anonymization features suitable for

132

secondary use of clinical data [15]. Controls were identified through this prospectively

133

collected database of hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients.

134

Patients who had any of the following features at the time of, or after, admission were

135

classified as having severe pneumonia: (1) respiratory distress (≥30 breaths per min); or (2)

136

oxygen saturation at rest ≤93%; or (3) ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional

137

concentration of oxygen inspired air (PaO2/FiO2) ≤300 mm Hg; or (4) severe disease

138

complications (e.g., respiratory failure, requirement of mechanical ventilation, septic shock,

139

or non-respiratory organ failure) [7, 14, 15].

140

Systemic inflammation was defined as presence at baseline of one of the following: fever >

141

38°C, C-reactive protein (CRP) 10 times above the upper limit of normal (ULN) of 5 mg/dl,

142

ferritin 2 times above the ULN (400 µg/L), or IL-6 10 times above the ULN of 3.4 ng/L. The

143

first results obtained at hospital admission, and in any case not later than within day 3 of

144

admission were considered.

145

Adverse events possibly or probably related to steroid and tocilizumab treatment, such as

146

neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels,

147

(UNL < 40 U/L), microbiologically documented infections and allergic reactions were

148

evaluated for both treated patients and controls. Adverse events were collected up to the last

149

available follow up from starting of tocilizumab and/or methylprednisolone in treatment

150

group and from hospital admission in the control group. The common terminology criteria for

151

adverse event (CTCAE) version 5.0 was used.

152

Standard of care and treatment procedures

153

The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made with a positive RT-PCR assay performed on nasal

154

swab or broncoalveolar lavage fluid according to World Health Organization interim guidance

[16]. Patients received treatment with oral hydroxychloroquine 400mg bid, unless glucose-6-

156

phosphate dehydrogenase deficient. Until March 24th, darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 qd was also

157

administered [17]. Thereafter, the protocol was amended and darunavir/ritonavir was

158

withdrawn [18]. Short-term antibiotic coverage was prescribed at admission. Low-molecular-

159

weight heparin prophylaxis was administered unless contraindicated. These treatments were

160

defined as SOC.

161

Since March 11th, we started adding tocilizumab to SOC in case of severe COVID-19

162

pneumonia and systemic inflammation. Tocilizumab was administered intravenously at the

163

dose of 8mg/kg (maximum 800mg), with the possibility of repeating the dose after 24 hours if

164

no response was obtained. Due to a temporary shortage of intravenous formulation, the

165

available subcutaneous formulation (162 mg) was administered. Following an internal review

166

of risks and benefits of steroid treatment in patients with severe COVID-19, since March 16th

167

methylprednisolone (1mg/kg for 5 days intravenously, then 0.5mg/kg for 5 days) was

168

included in the protocol. Tocilizumab was added in case of systemic inflammation or rapid

169

respiratory function deterioration.

170

Statistical analysis

171

No sample-size calculations were performed. The primary end point was time to failure,

172

defined as intubation and mechanical ventilation or death, whichever occurred first, within 30

173

days from the hospital admission.

174

The secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Time was calculated from time of

175

hospitalization for the comparison between tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC and SOC

176

patients and from the date of starting anti-inflammation treatment for the comparison among

177

treatment groups.

178

The landmark analysis was applied in order to minimize the potential immortal time bias that

179

can arise in non-randomized studies and is related to the fact that patients treated after a

180

longer time from admission must have not experienced the event up to that time, and that

181

patients with a very early event (e.g. death) were more likely assigned to the untreated group.

182

This is a conservative analysis which reduced the risk that the treatment choice was motivated

183

by the patient’s disease course. Therefore, day 3 from hospital admission was set as a

184

landmark time point: those who died, were intubated or discharged from the hospital before

185

day 3 were excluded, while patients were included in the tocilizumab/methylprednisolone

186

treatment group if the treatment was started within 3 days from hospital admission (see Figure

187

1).

188

To minimize baseline differences between treated and untreated patients a propensity score-

189

based analysis was performed. Propensity score (PS) was derived by a logistic regression

190

model including the following baseline variables: age, gender, presence of comorbidities and

191

week of treatment start, ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional concentration

192

of oxygen inspired air (PaO2/FiO2), non-invasive ventilation (NIV), time from symptoms

193

onset to hospital admission, IL-6, ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and d-dimer serum levels.

194

Positivity assumption of PS was checked after the calculation. For each patient, the overlap

195

weight (OW) based on PS was calculated [19]. To assess the balance of covariate distribution

196

between the two groups, Cohen’s standardized mean differences were calculated between the

197

two groups in the original samples and after weighting. An absolute value of difference < 0.10

198

was considered an acceptable balance.

199

The OW-weighted Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to calculate the

200

adjusted hazard-ratio (HROW) of tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC vs SOC patients.

201

Weighted cumulative probability of failure or death was calculated by mean of Kaplan-Meier

202

(KM) survival curves.

203

To define risk factors associated with outcomes and to compare the three treatment groups,

204

adjusted HRs were estimated by a multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model.

205

The same baseline variables used in the calculation of PS were considered for the

206

multivariable analysis. To avoid overfitting, only those characteristics who showed a p-value

≤ 0.15 at univariable analysis and after inclusion in the multivariable model were considered,

208

with age and gender forced into the model. For a better interpretation and to avoid the

209

influence of outliers on estimation, the IL-6, ferritin, CRP and d-dimer were log-transformed

210

before the analysis due to the highly skewed distribution. All results were reported as HR with

211

95% confidence interval (95%CI).

212

A subgroup analysis was performed to assess if the treatment effect of tocilizumab versus

213

methylprednisolone on primary outcome was different between subgroups defined according

214

to categorized baseline variables. An interaction test was used to assess a different treatment

215

effect in subgroups.

216

The

217

tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC and SOC patients was reassessed excluding from the

218

SOC group the patients that received tocilizumab or methylprednisolone after 3 days from

Patients

224

Overall, 215 patients were evaluated: 135 (62.8%) received tocilizumab/methylprednisolone

225

within 3 days from hospitalization, 20 (12.9%) were treated after 3 days from hospitalization

226

and were included in the SOC group, and 60 (38.7%) patients received only SOC. After

227

excluding the patients who were discharged or developed a failure event (intubation or death)

228

before the day 3 set for landmark analysis, 196 patients were included (130

229

tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC and 66 SOC patients) (Figure 1).

230

Patients were mainly male (67.4%), with a median age of 67.9 years (range, 30-100), and

231

most of them (78.1%) had comorbidities (Table 1). The median PaO2/FiO2 was 200 mmHg

234

130 patients was 8 days, IQR: 9-15; range 5-23.

235

Failure rate

236

In univariable and multivariable analyses, older age, male gender, higher baseline

237

inflammatory markers, especially IL-6, and PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mmHg were identified as risk

238

factors for failure (Table 2).

239

Differences between the two groups were consistently reduced after OW. OW weighted

240

characteristics of two groups of patients are shown in Table 3.

241

After a median follow-up of 49 days (range 4-70, IQR 30-56), 17 patients were intubated

242

(14/130 in tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC and 3/66 in SOC group) and 36 died (14/130

243

in tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC and 22/66 in SOC group). Overall, 28 (21.5%)

244

failure events were detected among tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC patients and 25

245

(37.9%) among SOC patients.

246

At day 14, the weighted failure-free survival was 86.5% (95%CI, 79.1-91.7) among

247

tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC and 75.8% (95%CI, 63.7-84.1) among SOC patients,

248

while at 30 days (primary endpoint) it was, respectively, 80.8% (95%CI, 72.8-86.7) and

249

64.1% (95%CI, 51.3-74.0) (Figure 2). The Cox regression analysis adjusted by OW weighted

250

propensity score estimated a significant effect of therapy in reducing the risk of failure (HROW

251

= 0.48 95%CI, 0.23-0.99; p=0.049).

252

Tocilizumab/methylprednisolone treatment strategies

253

Within the cohort of 130 treated patients, 45 (34.6%) received methylprednisolone, 29

254

(22.3%) tocilizumab and 56 (43.1%) combined therapy. Patients in combined treatment group

255

were younger and with fewer comorbidities but with comparable inflammatory markers, the

256

frequency of low PaO2/FiO2 and NIV (Table 4).

Discussion

305

In this observational study in not intubated patients with mainly severe COVID-19

306

pneumonia, the early addition of tocilizumab and/or methylprednisolone to SOC resulted in

307

adjusted failure-free survival of 86.5% and 80.8% at day 14 and 30, which was, respectively,

308

10.7% and 16.7% higher than in SOC patients.

309

Even though only the minority of patients develop the severe form of COVID-19 (14% in the

310

Chinese cohort of 72.314 patients), the outcomes in this group are poor, with 24.9% rate of

311

failure (intubation or death) reported in 173 patients with severe disease [2, 20]. The

312

observation that COVID-19-associated respiratory failure can be caused by cytokine storm

313

rather than viral progression is the rationale for administering anti-inflammatory treatments,

314

including tocilizumab [9, 10, 21]. The initial studies on tocilizumab in COVID-19 reported a

315

clinical benefit in retrospective cohorts of 21 and 15 patients with moderate to critical

316

COVID-19 pneumonia, in whom steroids were also administered [12, 22]. However, none of

317

studies reported and evaluated the impact of steroid co-administration, nor included a control

318

group which did not receive tocilizumab. Subsequently these treatments were recommended

319

by Chinese Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6

320

and 7) [14]. However, considering the rapid widespread increase in severe cases of COVID-

321

19 worldwide, the availability and the cost of anti-IL-6 treatment might limit its use.

322

Therefore, at the peak of COVID-19 epidemics in our city, we implemented the early use of

323

corticosteroids and the use of subcutaneous tocilizumab if intravenous formulation was not

324

readily available. We acknowledge that the benefit of subcutaneous formulation might be

325

lower and slower than in case of intravenous drug, but no standard intravenous dose for

326

COVID-19 has been established, as one study used 400 mg and the other the rage of doses

327

from 80 mg to 600 mg, irrespective of the patients’ weight [12, 22].

328

The first study that reported the impact of steroid treatment in COVID-19, showed that it was

329

administered to 30.8% of patients, mainly in case of more severe disease, and was associated

330

with a significant reduction of the risk of death in patients with ARDS (HR=0.38) [13]. While

331

other cohorts reported steroid use in approximately 44% of severely ill patients, they did not

332

analyze their influence on outcome [20, 23]. Subsequently, an observational study reported a

333

benefit of early administration of steroid therapy on composite outcome of ICU admission,

334

mechanical ventilation or death at 14 days (34.9% vs. 54.3%) and overall survival (86.4% vs.

335

73.7%) [24]. In addition to these data, we were able to demonstrate that, after minimizing as

336

much as possible the differences between the groups through OW adjustment, the outcome of

337

patients was better in case of early treatment with tocilizumab and/or methylprednisolone.

338

Indeed, in SOC group the rate of failure at day 14 of 24.2% was very similar to what reported

339

in other cohorts with severe pneumonia (24.9%), while it was reduced to 13.5% in our

340

tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC group [20]. Our data show that this benefit was also

341

present with month-long follow up (overall HRow of 0.48), which is important in establishing

342

long

343

tocilizumab/methylprednisolone was also noted on overall survival, both at 14 and 30 days

344

(respectively, 92.7% vs. 78.2% and 85.9% vs. 71.9%). Compared to the study with steroid use

345

only, the 14-day survival was higher in our cohort, providing background for the hypothesis

346

that combined tocilizumab/steroid treatment might be warranted [24]. Finally, preliminary

347

results of the RECOVERY trial reported higher survival rate in patients with severe COVID-

348

19 pneumonia treated with dexamethasone, although the detailed results are not available yet.

349

Interestingly, our observational study, which showed the effectives of early anti-inflammatory

350

treatment in a cohort of non-intubated patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia,

351

documented that these patients were treated at a median time of 8 days after the onset of

352

symptoms, which is exactly the time of initial cytokine storm, and therefore might be optimal

353

for the effect of anti-inflammatory treatment.

354

Consistent with other studies, we identified older age, high IL-6 levels and poor respiratory

355

function as independent predictors of failure, with possible impact also of CRP and d-dimer

356

levels [25]. Possibly due to a limited sample size, we were unable to document which of three

357

treatment groups provided most benefit, and if there were predictors of better response to

358

tocilizumab/methylprednisolone compared to methylprednisolone alone in any subset of

359

patients. However, the rate of failure-free survival was the highest in the combination

treatment group. In addition, based on our sensitivity analyses, adding the anti-inflammatory

361

treatment later after hospital admission might still provide some clinical benefit. In fact,

362

including in the SOC group patients who received anti-inflammatory treatment later during

363

the infectious course possibly reduced the difference between the study arms, highlighting the

364

benefit of an early anti-inflammatory treatment.

365

The limitations of this study include the non-randomized design, yet the inclusion of

366

consecutive patients using the same SOC but not treated with tocilizumab or

367

methylprednisolone, and adjustment for the outcome-associated variables, allowed to notice

368

the improvement in patient outcomes. Nonetheless, it is possible that some benefit observed

369

was partially due to general improvements in patient clinical care that occur with time.

370

Additionally, this being a single-center experience might limit the applicability to other

371

settings, since our hospital managed to rapidly increase the capacity for hospitalization and

372

ventilation support, potentially improving general patient care. However, the adjustment for

373

the differences between patient groups through propensity score and conservative approach

374

with the use of landmark analysis were directly at minimizing the risk associated with an

375

absence of randomization. Finally, we believe that the rate of failure observed in this study of

376

7.3%

377

tocilizumab/methylprednisolone might help to better define the expected rate of response and

378

calculate the number of patients needed to include in the studies assessing various treatment

379

options.

380

Conclusion

381

In conclusion, the negative impact of immune response in COVID-19 might be mitigated by

382

early administration of anti-inflammatory therapy with tocilizumab, methylprednisolone or

383

both. Randomized studies are warranted to establish the best treatment options, their timing

384

and limitations.
