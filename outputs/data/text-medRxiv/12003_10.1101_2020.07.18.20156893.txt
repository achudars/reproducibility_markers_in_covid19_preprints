Abstract
Background: Emergence of new

multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children

(MIS-C) is thought to be associated with COVID-19 pandemic.

Covid-19 morbidity and

mortality variances among countries have been suggested by previous works to be
influenced by BCG and previous latent TB infection (which is reflected by TB prevalence)
possibly through inducing heterogeneous immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
Aim: To examine influence of BCG status and TB prevalence on variances among
countries which report new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).
Methods: We choose all countries which report MIS-C till 23/6/2020, number of cases
for each 10 million inhabitants was examined among 3 categories of countries classified
according to BCG program status. TB prevalence, MIS-C no. / 10 million (M) population
and Covid- 19 deaths/M are taken as markers. Receiver operation characteristic - (ROC)
curve, with some relative indicators such as (sensitivity and specificity rates), estimation
area of trade - off between sensitivity and specificity, and cutoff points are used with
different studied markers for discriminating different three pairs of countries (which have
different BCG practices).
Results: BCG vaccinations and high TB prevalence are found to be associated with
decrease MIS-C no. and COVID-19 deaths
Conclusions: Findings might explain variances in MIS-C incidence and in COVID-19
mortality among countries worldwide. Further studies to confirm this relation and to
confirm possible similar relations in

Kawasaki disease(KD) in previous epidemics is

recommended.

What is Known:
- Although the etiology for KD remains unknown, available evidence supports the
hypothesis that the pathogenesis is closely associated with dysregulation of immune
responses to an infectious agent.
- BCG and / or Latent TB have heterogeneous beneficial effects.

What is New: Our study shows that TB prevalence and implementing BCG vaccination
have negative statistical association with MIS-C cases and COVID-19 mortality.

Introduction
In April 2020, reports emerged from the United Kingdom of a presentations in children
similar to incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD) or toxic shock syndrome (TSS)1,2,3. In Italy,
approximately 10 suspected Kawasaki-like disease cases have been recorded since 1
January 2020, eight of which were reclassified as new pediatric inflammatory multisystem
syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children (PIMS-TS)4 or

multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or pediatric hyper inflammatory
syndrome, or pediatric hyper inflammatory shock1which is

hyper inflammatory

syndrome with multiorgan involvement have some features similar to those of Kawasaki
disease and TSS5. MIS-C cases also been reported since then in USA and countries in
Europe. Classical KD with concurrent COVID-19 also have been reported6.
(KD) is an acute febrile systemic vasculitis that predominantly occurs in children younger
than 5 years of age and the most common acquired heart disease during childhood in most
industrialized countries7. The annual incidence of KD is highest in Japan, with more than
300 per 100 000 children aged 4 years or younger affected8, compared with 25 per
100 000 children aged 5 years or younger in North America9and is rarely reported in subSaharan Africa10. Although KD is less common in western countries KD shock syndrome (
KDSS) a rare form of KD has a higher incidence in these countries (2.60 to 6.95%)11,12 ,13, 14
,compared with Asian

countries like Taiwan which reported lower incidence rate

(1.45%)15.
KDSS is often associated with myocarditis and requires critical care support during the
acute phase of illness KDSS might mimic toxic shock syndrome11. The severity of
inflammation in KD is reflected by inflammatory parameters; thus, laboratory findings are
helpful for diagnosing incomplete KD just like MIS-C. Patients are considered to have
incomplete KD when they lack a sufficient number of criteria to fulfill the epidemiologic
case definition1. “Atypical KD” should be used in the presence of an unusual or odd
manifestation of KD (e.g., nephritis or central nervous system complication)16.
A high level of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines might contribute to the distributive
component of shock. Indeed, KDD has been found associated with high levels of IL-6, and
procalicitonin12. Patient with MIS-C also high levels of inflammatory markers, including
procalcitonin, and serum interleukin 617. Furthermore elevation of inflammatory markers
(cytokines)

has been previously demonstrated

in inflammatory state for multiple

conditions18including cytokine storms. Cytokine storm denotes a hyperactive immune
response characterized by the release of interferons, interleukins, tumor-necrosis factors,
chemokines, and several other mediators. Cytokine storms can be caused by a number of
infectious, especially viral respiratory infections such as H5N1,H1N1 influenze and SARS3

CoV219,20 Other causative agents include the Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus21.
Likewise in KD circumstantial evidence points to an infectious cause22. In the past 20
years, viruses of the coronavirus family have been proposed as possibly implicated in the
pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease in small percentage23,24.
The case definition of MIS-C was regarded by some experts as quite broad and overlaps
with Kawasaki disease,25. On the contrary other experts are concerned that current
diagnostic criteria may not capture the true scope of the problem26.
Erythema or induration of the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) injection site has been
listed by the American Heart Association as a significant finding among the diagnostic
guidelines for KD27. Such finding might account to 50%of patients28,29 BCG reactivation
is thought to happen due to suggested cross reactivity of mycobacterial Heat Shock Protein
65 (HSP65) and the human homologue HSP63. Furthermore, cross immune heterogenecity
was suggested between BCG and certain viral diseases since

BCG induces trained

immunity through expressing heterologous antigens of different pathogens which have
been developed and tested since 199130. Different studies have already show statistical
associations of BCG vaccinations and TB prevalence status
COVID-19 disease31,32,33,34

,35

. These studies suggest

with reduced severity of

that BCG and natural latent TB

infection induce heterogeneous immunity against SARS-CoV2. Studies are lacking
regarding possible role of BCG or possible latent TB

protective effects on incidence of

MIS-C or KD including KDSS. This study is the first in aspect of looking for MIS-C
incidence in relation to TB prevalence status and COVID-19 deaths in different countries
classified according to BCG vaccination status and will address possible cause of disparities
raised regarding variances in incidence of MIS-C and COVID-19 deaths rates among
countries.
This study also discusses possible relation of KD with previous pandemics according to
various TB prevalence and BCG status of some countries.

It was not appropriate or possible to involve patients or the public in this work given that
we used general practice level summated data and related publically published morbidity
and mortality statistics. Patients were not involved

Results and Findings:
Group 1 (countries with no vaccination at all and no previous BCG national programs)
shows highest mean value for COVID-19 deaths/M inhabitant and lowest for TB
prevalence.
Group 3 (countries currently giving BCG vaccine) shows lowest MIS-C no./10 M and
lowest COVID-19 mortality and highest TB prevalence.
Group 2 No current vaccination (previous vaccination) group shows highest MIS-C and
other parameters were in between.
Table No. (2) and fig (1) show estimated area of trade - off between sensitivity and
specificity of markers through plotting sensitivity against a complement specificity outcome
to examine the trade - off, which is called (ROC) curve, table 2 also show a significant level
for testing area under the guideline of fifty percent, with 95% confidence interval of all
probable combinations of pairs of countries and were as follows:
1- Pair of countries with no vaccination program at all (x axis) & no current vaccination
program but have previous vaccination program (y axis):
The common think in this pair is that both groups had no vaccination programs at this
time whether had previous history of vaccinations or not.
2- Pair of countries with never gave BCG vaccination program (x axis) & those with
currently giving BCG vaccination (y axis).
3-Pair of countries with currently no vaccination (ceased vaccination program) (x axis) &
currently vaccinated (y axis). The common think in this pair is having vaccination whether
in the past or at the current time.
Findings are as shown in table 2 and fig. 1 : MIS-C no./10 M inhabitants in countries never

Important not significant finding is that MIS-C no./10 M inhabitants in countries never

ROC- curve equal to 0.583 with a symbiotic significant of 0.683 and (95% CI interval of

not currently giving vaccine

are in the 3d pair of countries (i.e. with countries currently

given BCG vaccine) and not in 1st pair (i.e. with countries never gave national BCG
vaccination).
COVID-19 deaths / M inhabitants in countries never gave BCG vaccination vs countries

Important finding is the non-significant association of COVID-19 deaths no. /M inhabitants
in countries never gave BCG vaccination vs countries not currently give vaccine (1st pair)
which shows area under ROC- curve equal to 0.417 with a symbiotic significant of 0.683
and (95% CI interval of 0.078 - 0.755). COVID-19 deaths are a good discriminator in a
significant association when countries not currently give vaccine are in third pair of

reportable asymptotic values were 0.102,0.157 and 0.174 for 3 pairs respectively.
In figure (1) TB prevalence marker or discriminator looks to be too generating with
the leftover markers in all 3 pairs.
Discussion
According to ECDC there is lack of understanding with regard to the SARS-CoV-2induced humoral and cellular immune responses; furthermore, ECDC considered children
with this MIS-C for recruitment in research and surveillance studies in addition to
descriptive observational studies to further understand the basic clinical and
epidemiological parameters associated with this emerging condition.
We suggest that TB and /or BCG might have a role in trained immunity modulation as
back ground hypothesis for this study.
Limitations of this study includes but not limited to the following: overlap case definition
with Kawasaki disease25, retrograde classification of cases, underreporting, under
registration, limited no. of countries reported the disease up to 13/6/2020 and limited
number of reported cases. Furthermore, this study is done at early time of emergence of
this new disease with existence of continuous reporting new cases from different countries
in the view of increased awareness of the disease 39,40,41,42,43 ,44. Also, there was no agreed
international nor EU case definition for MIS-C neither specific diagnostic code during
study period making the impact of the new syndrome more difficult to be fully assessed.
The statistical negative association between MIS-C and BCG is highly significant between
countries which give BCG vaccination versus those not given BCG vaccine. This is
statistical association and not necessary means causation although direct beneficial effect
to BCG vaccination is suggested. Another mode of protection which might explain this
relation in countries already ceased BCG vaccinations which also shows significant
negative association is through herd immunity. On the other hand, those with no BCG
vaccination are the worst among 3 groups. This negative association also found between
BCG practicing and COVID-19 deaths. Similar to BCG ,TB prevalence( which reflects
latent TB status ) shows less significant but informative and reportable association and
too generating with the leftover markers. Our findings consolidate previous literatures
which suggest influence of BCG and TB prevalence status in lowering COVID-19
mortality31,32

KD emergent cases were back to 1961 when first case identified. In 1967, 50 patients
reported by Dr. Tomisaku Kawasaki46. Incidence of KD (per 100,000 less than 5-yearolds)47 is 308 in Japan in 201448,194.7-217.2 in South Korea in 201449,50, 71.9.03 -116.6 in
China in 2010- 201451. Recently, greater numbers of countries report incomplete KD
cases52.
During 1918 pandemic there were no reports for KD or KD like disease condition. Since
that time literature research on the impact of Spanish influenza does indicate that the
Chinese people survived much better than people in the USA and Europe. There is no
evidence of KD like condition in China apart from viral erythema misdiagnosed as scarlet
fever reported in some patients in China53.
In Europe and USA it seems that the epidemic was started earlier than 191854,55,
58,59, 60

. In USA there was widespread of

56, 57 ,

measles epidemic by early October 1917 and

continuing into 1918 according to medical reports 61. At same time there were increases in
scarlet fever and in measles case-fatalities. Measles produced the highest infection rates in
97 years of continuous military surveillance and extreme case-fatality from aggressive
bronchopneumonias and other complications62. Furthermore, some of the reported
deaths were caused by primary pneumonia or empyema without measles61. It seems that
skin rashes were not reported as a sign of spanish flu in affected persons in USA unlike in
China. When KD becomes well known disease, differentiation between KD and measles
reported be difficult sometimes

63

. Furthermore, differentiation between KD or KD like

ilness and measles was impossible in 1917-1918 since KD is not yet known, added to that
there

were

no

lab

facilities

to

differentiate

between

2

diseases.

Interstitial

bronchopneumonia was used to describe both of 1917 measles and 1918 influenza autopsy
findings61, 64,65.
Tuberculosis mortality was in decline in the USA since at least the mid-nineteenth century
and continued to decline through 1918 during pandemic and later on66.
In Japan large-scale influenza epidemics have occurred in the past, including the Spanish
flu during 1918–1920, Asian flu during 1957–1958, Hong Kong flu during 1968–1969, and
2009 H1N1 pandemic during 2009–2010. Influenza outbreak in 1957 is caused by ( H2N2)
and

the quite extensive outbreaks in 1962 and 1965 were due to
10

drift variants67.

Furthermore 13 outbreaks of swine influenza were recognized in Japan from 1978 – 197968.
Influenza type B viruses were also associated with increased morbidity in 198269. The
1986-87 influenza epidemic was caused by influenza A(H1N1) variant first isolated in
China, Malaysia, Japan, and Singapore70. It seems that temporally associated with 4
previous out brakes, three large KD epidemics were recorded in Japan—in 1979, 1982, and
in 1986 in addition to the first reported cases by Tomisaku Kawasaki in 196746.
In 1953, Japan was highly endemic with TB. By developments in TB treatments,71,72 , and
giving mass BCG vaccinations since 1948 till now, (boosters were given also before 2003 ),
the mortality rate from TB dropped sharply72.
The reported annual incidence rates of KD per 100,000 children aged 0 to 4 years in Japan
was 206.2 in 2009 and 239.6 in 2010, the 2010 rate was the highest ever reported before.
The influenza epidemic in 2009, (H1N1) was suggested for this increase in incidence73.
TB prevalence in Japan was 17 in 201174decreased to 14 in 201875, while KD incidence
increased to 308 in 2014. It is possible that decreasing in TB prevalence might be a factor
in emerging of KD (in the presence of BCG national vaccination program), while it seems
that decreasing TB prevalence might be a factor in KDSS or MIS-C in countries with no
current mass BCG vaccinations. This should be confirmed by further studies.
In USA a wide outbreak of KD, apparently the 1st in the USA, occurred in Hawaii in the
first half of 1978. Isolates of H1N1 in 50 states in 1977 were reported with new variant of
H1N1 reported in few states including Hawaii76. During 1984 - 1985, 10 outbreaks of (KD)
outbreaks occurred in 10 states and the district of Columbia 77 . According to CDC, during
the 1983-1984 influenza season, school and college outbreaks of type A(H1N1) strains
began and increased sharply after January 1 and peaked in February78, just few months
before KD outbreaks.
In South Korea the incidence rates of KD after 2009 influenza pandemic increased from
115.4 in 2009 to 134.4 per 100,000 children in 201149,50 This furtherly increased to 170.9,
194.9 and 194.7 in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively50.TB prevalence in south Korea was 80
in 2011 decreased to 66 in 201879. Compared to Japan, South Korea have lesser incidence

of KD and higher TB prevalence since South Korea start BCG at late times in 70s and
stopping boosters in 200780.
In China the start and peak of KD epidemics were in 1979, 1982, and 1986, these out
brakes were coincidental to Japan’s for mentioned peaks of KD , furthermore there were
seasonal outbreaks between 1987-2010

81

. In general, KD incidence is low in China with

trends to increase in recent years. In Sichuan Province, the mean incidence (2003-2007)
was 7.182and in Hong Kong were 26, 39 and 74 showing increasing manner in 1994 , 2000
and 2011 respectively83. The incidence is as high as 116.6 in 2014 in Beijing51.
The “flu” of 1979( H2 N2) in USA originated in fact in mainland China in early 1977 which
was caused by another “new” virus that is not new at all but which circulated widely in the
early 1950’s, then vanished with the advent of “Asian” (H2N2) influenza in 1957

was 134.27 in 1990 and 137.93 in 2015 per 100,000 persons86 and decreased to 61 in 201875.
In Europe, the epidemiology of KD ranges from 3.6 to 15.2/100,00087 but (KDSS) has a
higher incidence in these countries13, compared with Asian countries, the real cause for
high incidence of KDSS in western countries is unknown yet.
BCG unlike natural infection gives protection to 50%-60 %88 of target population against
TB and has immunological heterogeneous effect against some other pathogens30. Clinical
trials are in progress to establish relations to prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The temporal associations of MIS-C emergence in different countries with concurrent virus
outbrakes and relations of KD or MIS-C emergence to low TB prevalence are of possible
concern ad this points to probable

but yet not definite causation relation. Furthermore,

causation might be back to 1917-1918 pandemic or even before. Furtherly, possible relation
of lack of BCG with KDSS or to MIS-C is of further concern too.
Conclusions: This study shows a significant relation between BCG and both of incidence
of MIS-C and COVID – 19 deaths, also between TB prevalence and both of incidence of
MIS-C and COVID-19 deaths.
