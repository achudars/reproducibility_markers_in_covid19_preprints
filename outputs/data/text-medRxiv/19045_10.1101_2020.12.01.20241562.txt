ABSTRACT

24

Objectives: There is limited information on the performance of rapid antigen detection

25

(RAD) tests to identify SARS-CoV-2-infected asymptomatic individuals. In this field

26

study, we evaluated the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (Abbott

27

Diagnostics, Jena, Germany) for the purpose.

28

Methods: A total of 634 individuals (355 female; median age, 37 years; range, 9-87)

29

were enrolled. Household (n=338) contacts were tested at a median of 2 days (range, 1-

30

7) after diagnosis of the index case and non-household contacts (n=296) at a median of

31

6 days (range, 1-7) after exposure. RAD testing was carried out at the point of care. The

32

RT-PCR test used was the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

33

Massachusetts, USA).

34

Results: In total, 79 individuals (12.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR, of whom 38

35

(48.1%) yielded positive RAD results. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the

36

RAD test was 48.1% (95% CI: 37.4-58.9) and 100% (95% CI: 99.3-100), respectively.

37

Sensitivity was higher in household (50.8%; 95% CI: 38.9-62.5) than in non-household

38

(35.7%; 95% CI:16.3-61.2%) contacts. Individuals testing positive by RAD test were

39

more likely (P<0.001) to become symptomatic than their negative counterparts.

40

Conclusion: The Panbio test displays low sensitivity in asymptomatic close contacts of

41

COVID-19 patients, particularly in non-household contacts. Nonetheless, establishing

42

the optimal timing for upper respiratory tract collection in this group seems imperative

43

to pinpoint test sensitivity.

INTRODUCTION

48

Rapid antigen detection (RAD) immunoassays have emerged as a valuable alternative to

49

RT-PCR for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients presenting with clinically

50

compatible COVID-19 [1]. RAD tests are simple to carry out and return results within a

51

short time, thus being well-suited for point-of-care testing (POCT). Moreover, RAD

52

tests can be used as a proxy for SARS-CoV-2 cultured from respiratory tract specimens,

53

thus allowing reasonably accurate prediction of contagiousness [2,3]. The possibility of

54

using RAD tests to identify SARS-CoV-2-infected asymptomatic contacts of COVID-

55

19 patients is appealing, as it could effectively contribute to minimize community

56

SARS-CoV-2 spread through early detection of highly infectious individuals [1], yet

57

little is known about how RAD tests perform in this population group [4-6]. Here, we

58

report on the performance of the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (Abbott

59

Diagnostic GmbH, Jena, Germany) conducted at POC in this setting.

60

Material and methods

61

Patients

62

A total of 634 consecutive asymptomatic individuals (female, n=355; median age, 37

63

years; range, 9-87 years) attended at the Clínico-Malvarrosa Health Department

64

(Valencia, Spain) were enrolled between October 16 and November 20, 2020.

65

Participants were either household (n=338) or non-household (n=296) close contacts of

66

COVID-19 patients, as defined by the Spanish Ministry of Health [7]. Timing of sample

67

collection was prescribed at the discretion of either the physician in charge of the index

68

case or local health authorities. The study was approved by the Hospital Clínico de

69

Valencia (HCU) INCLIVA Research Ethics Committee.

71

Nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) for RAD and RT-PCR testing were collected by

72

experienced nurses at the POC site located at Hospital Malvarrosa, as previously

73

detailed [3]. RAD testing was carried out at POC immediately after sampling. RT-PCRs

74

were conducted within 24 h. of specimen collection at the Microbiology Service of

75

Hospital Clínico Universitario (Valencia, Spain) with the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo

76

Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). RT-PCR Ct values were

77

normalized to copies/ml as previously described [3].

78

Statistical analyses

79

Agreement between RAD and RT-PCR tests was assessed using Cohen’s Kappa (κ)

80

statistics. Differences between medians were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test.

81

The Chi-squared test was used for frequency comparisons. Two-sided P-values <0.05

82

were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS

83

version 25.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

84

Results

85

Overall performance of the RAD test in asymptomatic close contacts

86

A total of 79 out of 634 individuals (12.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR, of whom 38

87

(48.1%) returned positive RAD test results. There were no RT-PCR positive/RAD

88

negative cases. Accordingly, concordance between RT-PCR and RAD results was

89

moderate (κ index, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.5-0.73). As shown in Figure 1, SARS-CoV-2 RNA

90

load in NP was significantly higher (P<0.001) in RAD-positive (median, 8.7 log10

91

copies/ml) than in RAD-negative individuals (4.9 log10 copies/ml).

92

Overall sensitivity and specificity of RAD was 48.1% and 100% (Table 1). For the

93

above-mentioned prevalence (12.4%), the negative predictive value (NPV) of the RAD

94

test was 94.5%. As expected, RAD sensitivity was directly related to SARS-CoV-2 load

95

in NP specimens (Supplementary Table 1), reaching 96.8% when specimens with viral

96

load ≥ 7.4 log10 copies/ml (Ct ≤20) were analyzed separately.

97

Performance of RAD test in household and non-household asymptomatic close

98

contacts

99

Household contacts (n=338; median age, 36.5; range, 10-86 years; 175 female) were

100

tested at a median of 2 days (range, 1-7) after diagnosis of the presumed index case.

101

Sixty-five (19.2%) tested positive by RT-PCR, of whom 33 (50.7%) were positive by

102

RAD test. The likelihood of obtaining either a positive or a negative RAD result was

103

unrelated to the time elapsed since diagnosis of the index case (P=0.33).

104

Non-household contacts (n=296; median age, 38.5 years; range, 9-87 years; 180 female)

105

were tested at a median of 6 days (range, 1-7) after self-reported exposure. Five

106

individuals yielded RT-PCR-positive/RAD-positive results (1.6%) and 9 had RT-PCR-

107

positive/RAD-negative results (3.0%). Overall, median time from exposure to testing

108

was similar among individuals displaying either positive or negative RAD results

109

(P=0.89).

110

The agreement level between RT-PCR and RAD results was significantly higher

111

(P<0.001) for household (κ, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.50-0.75) than for non-household (κ, 0.51;

112

95% CI, 0.20-0.83) contacts. RAD sensitivity was significantly higher (P <0.001) in

113

household contacts, while the opposite was true for NPV (Table 1).

114

SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was comparable (P=0.21) across household (median, 6.8 log10

115

copies/ml; range, 3.4-10.9) and non-household (median, 5.9 log10 copies/ml; range, 3.5-

116

10.6) contacts, and was significantly higher (P<0.001) in RAD-positive than in RAD-

117

negative individuals, irrespective of the subcohort considered.

119

Thirty-nine out of the 79 individuals testing positive by RT-PCR eventually became

120

mildly symptomatic (49.3%), without requiring hospitalization. Individuals testing

121

positive by RAD were more likely (P<0.001) to develop COVID-19 (30 out of 38) than

122

those who did not (9 out of 41).

123

Discussion

124

In this field study, overall sensitivity of the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device

125

for identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals among asymptomatic close

126

contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases was 48.1%, close to the figures reported by

127

Linares et al. (54.5%) [4], Fenollar et al. (45.4%) [5] and Bulilete et al. (59.0%) [6], in

128

apparently comparable cohorts. However, in two of these studies [4,5], the RAD test

129

was carried out at a central laboratory, and timing of sample collection was not

130

disclosed [4,5]. In the study by Bulilete at al. [5] most participants (70.6%) were tested

131

within 5 days of exposure. Sensitivity of the PanbioTM test was lower than was

132

previously found [3-6] in symptomatic patients (around 80%), yet as reported for the

133

latter patients, RAD sensitivity was directly related to the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2

134

RNA load in NP specimens. Such a striking difference might reflect dissimilarities

135

across symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 load

136

in the upper respiratory tract [8,9]. While it is well known that SARS-CoV-2 load peaks

137

around the time of symptoms onset in the former group [10,11], the timing is uncertain

138

in asymptomatic cases.

139

Interestingly, individuals testing positive by RAD were more likely to become (mildly)

140

symptomatic than their negative counterparts, pointing to a pathogenetic link between

141

SARS-CoV-2 RNA load and development of overt COVID-19.

142

The strength of the current study is that it reflects the real-life performance of the RAD

143

test at POC. Among its limitations are the relative low number of cases, and the

144

possibility that samples were collected too early after exposure, particularly in non-

145

household contacts, in whom RAD sensitivity was strikingly low. In this sense, Linares

146

et al. [4] reported the sensitivity of the PanbioTM test as very low in close contacts at

147

less than 7 days from exposure.

148

In summary, we found the Panbio™ test to display low sensitivity in asymptomatic

149

contacts of COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, establishing the optimal timeframe for

150

NP collection in household and non-household contacts seems crucial to accurately

151

determine the sensitivity of the test.
