Abstract
Background: Unprecedented public health interventions including travel restrictions and national
lockdowns have been implemented to stem the COVID-19 epidemic, but the effectiveness of
non-pharmaceutical interventions is still debated. International comparisons are hampered by
highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale
of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of
epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented.
Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify
how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be
analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic
growth in different settings.
Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole
genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic
originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most
stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths
following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early
epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size.
Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly
associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers
infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated
with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated
with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to

Introduction
To prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, countries have implemented unprecedented
measures ranging from school closures and travel bans to large-scale lockdowns1. Because of the
immense economic and social consequences of such interventions, the utility of travel restrictions
and lockdowns have been questioned by the public and media. Mathematical models can help
determine whether these “non-pharmaceutical interventions” (NPI) have been effective in
reducing transmission. Previous investigations based on mathematical models have shown that
travel restrictions in Wuhan delayed arrival of the virus into other Chinese cities by around 3 days,
and early implementation of control measures was associated with lower incidence2. And in
Germany, changes in epidemic growth rates are correlated with the timing of interventions3. In
order to assess the impacts of NPIs across European countries, Flaxman et al. estimated the rate of
epidemic growth over time from reported COVID-19 deaths and pooled information across
European countries4. The impact of NPIs was significant across all countries, reducing the
reproduction number below 1, and implied a substantial reduction in the number of deaths
compared to a scenario with no intervention. Differences in case reporting complicate
international comparisons, but as the scale of epidemics has varied so drastically across countries,
such comparisons are essential. Dye et al.5 found that the 100-fold difference in cumulative
COVID-19 deaths across European countries was not attributable to lower rates of transmission
and epidemic growth, but rather due to differences in dates of national lockdown.
Comparisons beyond Europe are more complex due to greater variability in epidemiological
surveillance and epidemic growth rates. Furthermore, while sustained transmission took place
across most of Europe from around mid-February6, global comparisons are complicated by the
fact that the virus was introduced at very different times in different places. Epidemiological
models are typically fitted using data on reported infections, deaths, and seroprevalence surveys.
These provide estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, the average number of onward
transmissions per case in a susceptible population; and the time-varying reproduction number, Rt.
However, because a high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections are not detected and
seroprevalence surveys have only recently been carried out, parameterizing models for epidemics
in February through April when large scale NPIs were enforced is not easy. Critically, it is usually
not understood how long SARS-CoV-2 circulated in populations prior to detection which is
essential information for comparing timing of NPIs between locations.
Viral genetic data provide an alternative source of information for understanding when epidemics
originated and how quickly they grew. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can help
distinguish between imported and local transmission; and inclusion of sample dates allows for
further time-resolution of epidemic dynamics, yielding dates of viral introduction into specific
regions. Phylodynamic analysis uses genetic data to parametrise epidemiological models, for
example estimating Rt directly from viral sequences7. Analyses of viral sequences have
demonstrated that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 went undetected within the USA from
mid-January8–11 and many epidemics were seeded between states rather than as a result of
international travel. In contrast in Guangdong, China, the majority of new diagnoses appeared to
be imports, demonstrating the effectiveness of surveillance and interventions in interrupting
community transmission12.

In the present analysis, we reconstruct the epidemic trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks for
locations across the world for which genetic data were available. We estimate the time of viral
introduction into each region and calculate time to lockdown for each region. We then determine
whether reported and estimated epidemic sizes relate to the duration of times to lockdown.
Methods
Genetic data preparation and selection of study sites. SARS-CoV-2 sequences were downloaded
from GISAID (http://gisaid.org )13 on June 7th 2020. Genetic data were cleaned and prepared for
time-resolved phylogenetic analysis in R v3.6.1 (Supplementary Methods). We chose to focus our
analysis on sites with at least 100 sequences available (although some sites with fewer sequences
were analysed, see Supplementary Methods for details). When data were available for sites
located within each other (e.g. New Orleans in Louisiana), the smaller geographic unit was
preferentially selected (see Supplementary Methods and Discussion). Sites known to comprise
many sequences from travellers or generated as a result of contact tracing were excluded. Because
our model assumes that samples are taken at random from the population, we excluded duplicate
sequences from our analyses as a proxy for membership with the same transmission chain. We
investigated the effect of this choice through simulation (see Supplementary Methods).
Transmission model and comparative phylodynamic analysis. We utilized a compartmental
structured coalescent model in the BEAST2 v6.1 PhyDyn package14,15 to estimate the effective
reproduction number and the number of infections through time from SARS-CoV-2 genetic
sequences. The compartmental model has been previously described16–18 and applied to
SARS-CoV-2 sequence data. Importantly the model allows for bidirectional migration from and
into an international reservoir, and splits the infected compartment into categories representing
individuals with high or low rates of onward transmission. Earlier modeling efforts in
SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that the inclusion of a high transmission rate
compartment is crucial to realistically capturing case numbers18,19. The ability to accurately
reconstruct epidemic dynamics using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
inferential framework and phylodynamic model was assessed in a simulation experiment
(Supplementary Methods). For each site under investigation, we simultaneously reconstructed a
phylogeny and estimated epidemiological parameters in BEAST2 (see Supplementary Methods
for details). In order to expand our analysis to sites that did not converge in the Bayesian MCMC
using default parameters, we additionally calculated viral effective population size through time
for each site using a non-parametric skygrowth model20,21 (Supplementary Methods).
Independently, we estimated the timing of viral introductions through time-resolved phylogenetic
analysis and parsimony reconstruction (Supplementary Methods). From the distribution of viral
introduction times, we calculated the mean time of viral introduction weighted by the number of
samples descended from each viral introduction. We refer to this weighted mean as the central
epidemic seed time (CEST).
Comparison with other sources of data and statistical analysis. For sites analysed using BEAST,
we examined the relationship between mobility data provided by Google
(google.com/covid19/mobility, analysis limited to “transit stations” only) and Rt 22 by calculating

Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Google mobility data are measured in relative deviations from
maximum mobility prior to the WHO pandemic declaration.
For every site, we extracted dates of lockdown from the Oxford COVID-19 Government
Response Tracker1. If the region never underwent a full lockdown, we used the date of the most
severe national intervention (Sup Tab 2), henceforth named maximum NPI. We obtained case and
death counts for comparison with our own results and to assess case reporting (Sup Tab 2). We
then calculated the time from epidemic origin (CEST) to maximum NPI and the time from the
tenth reported case to maximum NPI for each site and constructed a series of linear regression
models. Time delays were counted in days. For all sites, we built linear regression models with
time from CEST to maximum NPI as predictor variable and number of reported cases at
maximum NPI and number of deaths one month after the maximum NPI as outcomes,
respectively. To evaluate if the time that cases were first reported could serve as a proxy for time
of epidemic origin, we reran these models changing our predictor variable to time between the
tenth reported case and maximum NPI. For BEAST locations, we built a univariate regression
model with time from CEST to maximum NPI as a predictor variable and the estimated number of
infections as an outcome. We then expanded all three CEST-based models into multivariable
models, including population size and R0 as predictors. When results appeared sensitive to the
presence of outliers, we verified associations using median-based linear models23 implemented in
the mblm R package v0.12.124. We computed Pearson correlation coefficients between reported
and estimated infections among BEAST locations. Population size, effective viral population size,
estimated infections, reported infections and death counts were log-transformed prior to analysis.
All analyses were conducted in R v3.6.1.
Results
We identified 30 locations (15 in Europe, six in North America, five in the Middle East, three in
Asia and one in Africa) where dates of public health interventions could be obtained and where
publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences enabled inference of epidemic origin dates and
reproduction numbers using model-based phylodynamic methods. We further identified a larger
set of 57 locations (24 in Europe, 20 in North America, five in the Middle East, six in Asia, one in
South America and one in Africa) meeting inclusion criteria that could be analyzed using
non-parametric phylodynamic methods. In total, 29,163 SARS-CoV-2 sequences were analysed,
in regional datasets ranging from 23 sequences (Innsbruck, Austria) to 677 sequences (Denmark).
Sample dates ranged from 2020-01-08 to 2020-05-30.
Phylogenetic analysis indicates that epidemic seeding was a continuous process with all regions
showing evidence for more than one epidemic origin (Figure 1). The earliest seeding events
among the 57 sites took place in January and in most locations seeding continued with a
maximum frequency occurring in March before maximum NPI and travel restrictions were
implemented in most locations. Sites with larger census population sizes had older central
epidemic seeding times (CEST, see Methods; r2=0.20, p<0.001).

Figure 1 | Distribution of phylogenetically-inferred seeding times for the 57 sites included in our
analysis. Central box-plot lines represent the central epidemic seeding time (CEST). Boxes
represent the interquartile range of the distribution. Sites from the same country or U.S state are
grouped together and sites are ordered based on the first CEST for that country or U.S. state.

Among the 57 sites, CEST to maximum NPI was significantly associated with the number of
reported infections at maximum NPI (p=3.8x10-5; Figure 2, Sup Fig 1, Sup Tab 1). This time delay
explains over a quarter of the variance in the reported number of infections at time of maximum
NPI (R2=0.27), and an additional 14 days of transmission before maximum NPI was associated
with a 1.06 (95%CI: 0.59-1.54) log increase in number of reported infections. The time delay
from the tenth reported case to maximum NPI was also predictive of the number of reported
infections but explained less of its variance (R2=0.24, p=1.0x10-4). Census population size was a
significant predictor of reported infections in univariate models (R2=0.17, p=1.3x10-3), but when
included alongside time from CEST in multivariable models, it was no longer significant.
Among the 30 sites analysed using the Bayesian phylodynamic model, we generated estimates of
the effective reproduction number R0, Rt and the number of infections over time (Sup Fig 3 and 4,
Sup Tab 1 and 2). The time to maximum NPI was associated with the model-based estimates of
the number of infections at maximum NPI (R2=0.19, p=1.7x10-2; Figure 3). An additional 14 days
of transmission before maximum NPI was associated with a 0.60 (95%CI:0.11-1.08) log increase
in the number of estimated infections at time of maximum NPI. In the multivariable model (R2
=0.44), time to maximum NPI remained significant (p=2.4x10-3). The estimated reproduction
number R0 was also significant (p=7.0x10-3) as R0 is co-inferred alongside the number of
infections in the model. A 25% increase in R0 was associated with a 0.90 (95%CI: 0.27-1.54) log
increase in the number of estimated infections at maximum NPI.

Figure 2 | Dates of central epidemic seeding time (CEST), tenth case report and maximum
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) for 14 of 57 sites included in our analysis. Sites are
ordered by the duration of time between CEST and maximum NPI. Note that the CEST does not
represent the earliest viral introduction but rather the mean time of viral introduction weighted by
the number of samples descended from each viral introduction; thus it can be preceded by the
tenth diagnosis if early diagnoses are not phylogenetically related to later infections (e.g.
Singapore). We selected up to three sites from each world region for which sites were available
(Europe, North America, Middle East, Asia, Africa) based on their having the highest death
counts in the region. Sup Fig 1 shows these dates for all 57 sites.

We observed the same associations using non-parametric inference methods. Viral effective
population size at maximum NPI, a proxy for the number of infections, was associated with time
to maximum NPI (R2=0.32, p=1.2x10-5; Figure 3, Sup Tab 1). An additional 14 days of
transmission before maximum NPI was associated with a 0.73 (95%CI:0.43-1.04) log increase in
effective population size at time of maximum NPI. In a univariate model, census population size

was predictive of viral effective size (R2=0.15, p=4.6x10-3). In a multivariable model (R2=0.38),
time from CEST to maximum NPI remained a significant predictor (p=5.4x10-4) but census
population size did not (p>0.05).
As an alternative measure of epidemic severity, we also considered the number of deaths reported
at each site one month following the time of maximum NPI (Sup Fig 4, Sup Tab 1 and 2). The
number of deaths was correlated with the estimated number of infections at maximum NPI (30
BEAST sites only, Pearson’s r=0.39, p=3.2x10-2; Figure 3) and with viral effective population size
(all 57 sites, Pearson’s r=0.58, p=5.2x10-6; Figure 3). Time from CEST to maximum NPI was
predictive of the number of deaths one month later (R2=0.11, p=1.1x10-2), but time from the tenth
case was not (p>0.05). An additional 14 days of transmission before maximum NPI was
associated with a 0.69 (95%CI:0.17-1.20) log increase in deaths one month after maximum NPI.
Census population size of each location was not significant in a model predicting deaths (p>0.05).
Across all sites and using non-parametric methods, we estimated the mean epidemic doubling
time was 3.68 days (IQR: 2.45-5.76). Across 30 sites analysed in BEAST using model-based
phylodynamic methods, doubling time was 3.47 days (IQR: 3.09-4.83). Estimates of R0 varied
between 1.53 (in Makkah, Saudi Arabia) and 4.18 (in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA; Sup Tab 3;
Sup Fig 3). We did not detect an association between R0 and climatological variables consisting of
mean rainfall and temperature over the period of uninhibited growth (results not shown).
To corroborate inference of effective reproduction numbers and epidemic size from genetic data,
we examined the relationship between inferred quantities and reported numbers of cases as well as
independent information about human mobility patterns. We found that changes in the inferred
reproduction number through time, Rt , corresponded with changes in Google human mobility
metrics for 29 of 30 locations where these data were available (Sup Tab 3; Sup Fig 2). Large
reductions in human mobility metrics consistently correspond with periods when Rt decreases.
The mean cross-correlation between Rt and mobility metrics among those 29 locations was 0.79,
ranging from 0.48 to 0.93 (all p<0.001). We then examined the relationship between the number
of inferred cumulative infections at maximum NPI and the number of reported infections at that
point. These were highly correlated (Pearson’s r=0.64, p=1.5x10-4; Figure 3). Using phylodynamic
estimates of the cumulative number infected we estimated that the mean reporting rate (proportion
of infections diagnosed) at the time of maximum NPI was 11.1% but varied greatly between
regions and over time (Sup Tab 3).
We examined the sensitivity of the results to choice of phylodynamic methodology and compared
inferred numbers infected to non-parametric estimates of viral effective population size. Estimates
of size were highly correlated (Pearson’s r=0.67, p=1.4x10-4), but estimates of R0 were not
(p>0.05). Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by excluding our data point for “Abruzzo,
Italy” (circled in Figure 3) in case it was driving observed associations. All relationships were
maintained except the regression of estimated number of infections over time from CEST to
intervention, which was no longer significant (Figure 3, panel B). However, when we applied a
median based linear model23 to the dataset, the association between the estimated number of
infections and time from CEST to intervention remained significant whether or not Abruzzo was
excluded (p=8.9x10-4 and p=7.1x10-5, respectively).

Discussion
Among 57 geographical sites sampled across five continents, we found that time from
SARS-CoV-2 introduction to time of lockdown (or maximum non pharmaceutical intervention
[NPI] in locations that never underwent a full lockdown) was associated at a significance level of
0.001 with the severity of the epidemic in each location. This result is consistent with analyses25
conducted thus far separately in China2,26 and Europe3–5 and demonstrates the importance of
cryptic transmission before testing and interventions were implemented in exacerbating epidemic
severity. Notably, the time between detection of the tenth case at each site at the maximum NPI
was not predictive of the number of deaths. This indicates that many locations experienced long
and variable periods of cryptic transmission before epidemics were detected 8–11. This analysis
implies that although outcomes are highly variable, on average implementing a strong NPI such as
national lockdown two weeks earlier would approximately halve cumulative deaths in the period
immediately following lockdown.
A previous comparison across European countries found that earlier lockdown dates were
associated with fewer deaths, and that countries with fewer COVID-19 deaths had fewer
inhabitants5. An association between population size and the number of deaths suggests that the
depletion of susceptibles limited onward spread in places with smaller populations. However,
serological surveys and patterns of per-capita death do not support the hypothesis that herd
immunity has been reached anywhere in Europe27. In our global analysis, census population size
was predictive of the number of estimated infections, viral effective population size and the
number of deaths in univariate models. But when controlling for the time from CEST to
lockdown, population size no longer had an effect, which is consistent with the hypothesis that
herd immunity has not substantially limited transmission.
International comparisons of NPI effectiveness have been complicated by widely varying testing
strategies in different locales and most epidemiological models are highly reliant on reported
COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths. Our ability to run analyses on such a wide range of locations
derives from the fact that our model is parameterised entirely by genetic data. We have shown that
this approach produces accurate estimates of the numbers of infections in simulations
(Supplementary Methods), and among the study sites, we found that the number of estimated
infections was highly correlated with the numbers of COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths. Our
analyses further support the use of viral effective population size at maximum NPI as a proxy for
SARS-CoV-2 epidemic size. Where possible, we compared our estimates to those modelled or
measured elsewhere. Estimates of R0 and Rt were in line with those previously reported for the
same locations28–32 and Rt showed a strong association with changes in human mobility over time,
as previously demonstrated for Rt estimates derived from traditional epidemiological models 22.
Dates of introduction into Europe aligned with previous reports demonstrating sustained
transmission from mid-February6.
A limitation of our analysis is that the Bayesian MCMC for our phylodynamic model did not
converge for all the locations. This can occur because one of the model assumptions is violated;
for example, samples may not be collected at random, or the population is not randomly mixing.
We addressed these concerns by excluding sites known to have prioritised sequencing from
travellers16,33 or contact tracing and by focusing on smaller geographical units, such as cities and
small regions where within-sample geographic structure is less biasing. Further optimisation of

some parameters, such as the parameter for transmission overdispersion could have improved
estimates, as has been recently demonstrated by Miller et al.16, but we chose to keep this
parameter constant across sites to facilitate meta-analysis.
The non-parametric phylodynamic analysis allowed us to include sites for which data were
available but the Bayesian MCMC did not converge20,21 as well as to examine sensitivity of results
to choice of modelling framework. Results echoed those from the compartmental phylodynamic
model. Viral effective population size at maximum NPI was associated with deaths one month
after maximum NPI and with time to maximum NPI.
In conclusion, we have shown that across five continents, longer delays from viral introduction to
lockdowns have led to more infections at lockdown and more deaths one month after lockdown.
Our models were calibrated entirely using genetic data and thus provide an independent
confirmation of mathematical models calibrated to traditional data sources. These findings
emphasize the importance of NPI for decreasing epidemic severity, reinforce previous findings
that seroprevalence is far below that needed for herd immunity 27 and highlight the risk for
re-emergence and continued transmission.
