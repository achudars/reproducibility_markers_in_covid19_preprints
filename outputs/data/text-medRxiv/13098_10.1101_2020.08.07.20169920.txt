Abstract

9

SARS-CoV-2 is difficult to contain because many transmissions occur during the pre-

10

symptomatic phase of infection. Moreover, in contrast to influenza, while most SARS-CoV-2

11

infected people do not transmit the virus to anybody, a small percentage secondarily infect large

12

numbers of people. We designed mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza which link

13

observed viral shedding patterns with key epidemiologic features of each virus, including

14

distributions of the number of secondary cases attributed to each infected person (individual R0)

15

and the duration between symptom onset in the transmitter and secondarily infected person

16

(serial interval). We identify that people with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza infections are usually

17

contagious for fewer than one day congruent with peak viral load several days after infection,

18

and that transmission is unlikely below a certain viral load. SARS-CoV-2 super-spreader events

19

with over 10 secondary infections occur when an infected person is briefly shedding at a very

20

high viral load and has a high concurrent number of exposed contacts. The higher predisposition

21

of SARS-CoV-2 towards super-spreading events is not due to its 1-2 additional weeks of viral

22

shedding relative to influenza. Rather, a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 exposes more people

23

within equivalent physical contact networks than a person infected with influenza, likely due to

24

aerosolization of virus. Our results support policies that limit crowd size in indoor spaces and

25

provide viral load benchmarks for infection control and therapeutic interventions intended to

26

prevent secondary transmission.

Introduction

28
29

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an ongoing tragedy that has caused 700,000 deaths and

30

massively disrupted the global economy. The pandemic is rapidly expanding in the United States

31

and is re-emerging focally in many countries that had previous success in limiting its spread.1

32

Two features have proven challenging in containing outbreaks. First, most transmissions

33

occur during the pre-symptomatic phase of infection.2 Underlying this observation is a highly

34

variable incubation period, defined as time between infection and symptom onset, which often

35

extends beyond an infected person’s peak viral shedding.3

36

Second, there is substantial over-dispersion of the basic reproduction number (R0) for an

37

individual infected with SARS-CoV-2,4 meaning that most infected people do not transmit at all,

38

while a minority may transmit to dozens of people, with the average, population R0 achieving a

39

high enough level (>1) to allow exponential growth of cases in the absence of an effective

40

intervention.5 Approximately 10-20% of infected people account for 80% of SARS-CoV-2

41

transmissions.4,6 Super-spreader events, in which the duration of contact between a single

42

transmitter and large number of secondarily infected people is often limited to hours, are well

43

documented.7,8 This pattern is not evident for influenza which has more homogeneous individual

44

transmissions numbers.9,10 Differing shedding kinetics between the two viruses might explain

45

this distinction; SARS-CoV-2 is often present intermittently in the upper airways for many

46

weeks,11,12 while influenza is rarely shed for more than a week.13 Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2

47

aerosolization may predispose to wider exposure networks given the presence of an infected

48

person in a crowded indoor space.

49

Viral load is recognized as a strong determinant of transmission risk. For influenza, the

50

dose of viral exposure is related to the probability of infection in human challenge studies,14 and

51

early treatment reduces household transmission.15,16 Household shedding of human herpesvirus-6

52

is closely linked to subsequent infection in newborns,17 and infants shedding high levels of

53

cytomegalovirus in the oropharynx predictably transmit the virus back to their mothers.18

54

The epidemiology of viral infections can also be perturbed by biomedical interventions

55

that lower viral load at mucosal transmission surfaces. Reduction of genital herpes simplex virus-

56

2 shedding with antiviral treatments decreases probability of transmission.19 Suppressive

57

antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV virtually eliminates the possibility of partner-to-partner

58

sexual transmission and has limited community transmission dramatically.20,21

59

These concepts are relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection and require urgent attention as the

60

pandemic continues to wreak havoc. Early therapies that lower peak viral load may reduce the

61

severity of COVID-19 but may also decrease the probability of transmission and of super-

62

spreader events.22 Similarly, the effectiveness of policies such as limiting mass gatherings, and

63

enforcing mask use can be directly evaluated by their ability to reduce exposure viral load and

64

transmission risk.23 Here we developed a transmission simulation framework to capture the

65

contribution of viral load to observed epidemiologic transmission metrics for influenza and

66

SARS-CoV-2 and used this approach to explain why SARS-CoV-2 is predisposed to super-

67

spreading events.

Results

69
70

Overall approach. We designed a series of steps to estimate the viral load required for SARS-

71

CoV-2 and influenza transmission, as well as conditions required to explain the observed over-

72

dispersion of secondary infections (individual R0) and frequent super-spreader events associated

73

with SARS-CoV-2 but not influenza. This process included within-host modeling of viral loads,

74

simulations of exposures and possible transmissions based on various transmission dose response

75

curves, testing of various parameter sets against epidemiologic data and exploratory analyses

76

with the best fitting model (Fig S1).

77
78

Within-host mathematical model of SARS CoV-2 shedding. First, we used our previously

79

developed within-host mathematical model (equations in the Methods),24 to generate plausible

80

viral load patterns in the upper airway of an infected person or transmitter who could potentially

81

transmit the virus to others (Fig 1, Fig S2a). Briefly, the model captures observed upper airway

82

viral kinetics from 25 people from four different countries.25-28 Key observed features include an

83

early viral peak followed by a decelerating viral clearance phase, which in turn leads to a

84

temporary plateau at a lower viral load, ultimately followed by rapid viral elimination. Our

85

model captures these patterns by including a density dependent term for early infected cell

86

elimination and a nonspecific acquired immune term for late infected cell elimination.

87

One limitation of our model is that only half of study participants provided longitudinal

88

viral load data from the very early days of infection when COVID-19 is often pre-symptomatic.

89

Therefore, the model's output is most reliable for later time points. In particular, we have somewhat

90

limited information on viral expansion rate and duration of peak shedding. To impute possible

91

variability, we generated a set of heterogeneous shedding curves in which the viral upslope, the

92

downslope of viral load after peak and the viral load during plateau phase were varied (Fig S2b).

93

Overall, the model generated several distinct patterns of infection: rapid elimination after the initial

94

peak, a prolonged plateau phase with a low viral load, and a prolonged plateau phase with higher

95

viral load. We simulated the transmission model with and without imputed heterogeneity.

Fig 1. SARS-CoV-2 and influenza transmission model schematic. In the above cartoon, the
transmitter has 2 exposure events at discrete timepoints resulting in 7 total exposure contacts and
3 secondary infections. Transmission is more likely at the first exposure event due to higher
exposure viral load. To model this process, the timing of exposure events and number of exposed
contacts is governed by a random draw from a gamma distribution which allows for heterogeneity
in number of exposed contacts per day (Fig S3). Viral load is sampled at the precise time of each

exposure event. Probability of transmission is identified based on the product of two dose curves
(Fig S2C, D) which capture contagiousness (probability of viral passage to an exposure contact’s
airway) and infectiousness (probability of transmission given viral presence in the airway).
Incubation period (Fig S4) of the transmitter and secondarily infected person is an input into each
simulation and is depicted graphically. Individual R0 is an output of each simulation and is defined
as the number of secondary infections generated by an infected individual. Serial interval is an
output of each simulated transmission and is depicted graphically.

114
115

Transmission dose response curves. We defined an exposure event in very specific biologic terms

116

as a discrete event consisting of sufficient contact in time and space between a transmitter and one

117

or more uninfected persons (exposure contacts) to allow for the possibility of a successful

118

transmission. We next designed hundreds of dose response curves which separately predict

119

contagiousness (CD curves) and infectiousness (ID curves) at a certain viral dose given an

120

exposure contact. Contagiousness is defined as the viral load dependent probability of passage of

121

virus-laden droplets or airborne particles from the airways of a potential transmitter to the airway

122

of an exposure contact. Infectiousness is defined as the viral load dependent probability of

123

transmission given direct airway exposure to virus in an exposure contact. Transmission risk is the

124

product of these two mechanistic probabilities derived from the ID and CD curves and results is a

125

transmission dose (TD) response curve. Each CD or ID curve is defined by its ID50 (l) or viral

126

load at which contagion or infection probability is 50% (Fig S2c), as well as its slope (a) (Fig

127

S2d).29 The TD50 is defined as viral load at which there is 50% transmission probability. We

128

assumed equivalent curves for contagiousness and infectiousness for model fitting purposes. We

129

also considered a simpler model with only a single TD curve (for infectiousness) and obtained

130

qualitatively similar results (Supplement and Methods). Our model is inclusive of the hypothesis

131

that viral load is not a key determinant of transmission when a<<1 (Fig S2d).

133

Exposure contact rate simulations. We introduced heterogeneity of exposure contact rates among

134

possible transmitters by randomly selecting from a gamma distribution defined by mean number

135

of exposure contacts per day (q) and a scaling factor (𝜌) that controls daily variability (Fig S3).

136
137

Transmission simulations. For each defined exposure contact, viral load in the transmitter was

138

sampled and transmission risk was then identified based on the product of the CD and ID curves,

139

or the TD curve (Fig S2e, f; Fig 1). Based on these probabilities, we stochastically modeled

140

whether a transmission occurred for each exposure contact. This process was repeated when there

141

were multiple possible exposure events within a given discretized time interval and the total

142

number of exposures and transmissions within that interval was calculated.

143

For each successful transmission, we assumed that it takes 𝜏 days for the first infected cell

144

to produce virus. To inform simulated values of serial interval (SI or time between symptom onset

145

in the secondarily infected and transmitter), we randomly selected the incubation period (IP), for

146

both the transmitter and the newly infected person, from a gamma distribution based on existing

147

data (Fig S4a).3,30 Incubation period was defined as time from infection to the time of the onset of

148

symptoms, where the mean incubation for SARS-CoV-2 is 5.2 days compared to 2 days for

influenza.3,9,30

features of the observed epidemiologic and individual-level data for SARS-CoV-2: mean R0

157

across individuals (R0 ∈ [1.4, 2.5]),3,4,6,31,32 mean serial interval across individuals (SI ∈

159

distribution functions of serial intervals derived from SARS-CoV-2 transmission pair studies that

160

were conducted early during the pandemic,31 prior to any confounding influence of social

161

distancing measures. Here, we define individual R0 as the total number of secondary

162

transmissions from the transmitter in a fully susceptible population (Methods). Given that viral

163

RNA is composed mostly of non-infectious material, we further checked the closeness of the

solved ID curve with the observed relationship between viral RNA and probability of positive

viral culture from a longitudinal cohort of infected people.37

and less variable than for SARS-CoV-2 and were randomly selected for each simulation of the

similar set of parameter values but with a higher daily rate of exposure contacts ([𝛼, 𝜆, 𝜏, 𝜃, 𝜌] =

[0.8, 107.5, 0.5, 20, 30]). Despite assuming that each infected person sheds at a high viral load for

a period of time (Fig 1, Fig S2b), the model captured the fact that ~75% of 10,000 simulated

transmissions is associated with a decreasing probability (Fig. 2a).

SARS-CoV-2 viral load was recently measured with viral RNA levels and mapped to

196

concurrent probability of positive viral culture in a Dutch cohort.37 Our model output

197

demonstrated a nearly equivalent infectious dose response curve if we multiplied modeled viral

198

RNA levels by 25 (Fig S5): this adjustment was likely necessary because viral loads in the Dutch

199

study participants were notably higher than those in German, Singaporean, Korean and French

200

participants used in our intra-host model fitting.25-28,37

201

The model also generated super-spreader events with 10,000 simulated transmissions

202

(Fig. 2b). If super-spreaders are defined as those who produce at least 5 secondary infections, we

203

estimate that ~10% of all infected people and ~35% of all transmitters are super-spreaders. If

204

super-spreaders are defined as those who produce at least 10 secondary infections, we estimate

205

that ~6% of all infected people and ~25% of all transmitters are super-spreaders. If super-

206

spreaders are defined as those who produce at least 20 secondary infections, we estimate that

207

~2.5% of all infected people and ~10% of all transmitters are super-spreaders. If super-spreaders

208

are defined as those producing ≥5, ≥10, or ≥20 secondary infections, the contribution to all

209

secondary infections is estimated at ~85%, ~70%, or ~44%, respectively (Table 1).

210

The model also recapitulated the high variance of the serial interval observed within

211

SARS-CoV-2 transmission pairs, including negative values observed in the data (Fig 2c, d). We

212

next projected generation time, defined as the period between when an individual becomes

213

infected and when they transmit the virus, for all transmission pairs and identified that the mean

214

serial interval (4.4 days) provides an accurate approximation of mean generation time. However,

215

the variance of generation time was considerably lower and by definition does not include

Viral load thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The optimized ID curve has an ID50 of

226

107 viral RNA copies and a moderately steep slope (Fig 3a). The TD50 for SARS-CoV-2 was

227

slightly higher at 107.5 viral RNA copies (Fig 3a). To assess the impact of these parameters on

228

transmission, we performed simulations with 10,000 transmitters and concluded that

229

transmission is very unlikely (~0.00005%) given an exposure to an infected person with an upper

230

airway viral load of <104 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies, and unlikely (~0.002%) given an exposure

231

to an infected person with a viral load of <105 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies. On the other hand,

232

transmission is much more likely (39%) given an exposure to an infected person who is shedding

>107 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies, and 75% given an exposure to an infected person with a viral

the window of high probability transmission is limited to time points around peak viral load, and

some heterogeneity in regard to peak infectivity is noted between people (Fig 3b-d). In general,

infected persons are likely to be most infectious (i.e., above TD50) for a ~0.5-1.0-day period

between days 2 and 6 after infection. We therefore conclude that the observed wide variance in

253

serial interval (Fig 2c) results primarily from the possibility of highly discrepant incubation

254

periods between the transmitter and infected person, rather than wide variability in shedding

255

patterns across transmitters.

(Fig S3d) with a high average number of exposed contacts per day (q=4). We generated a heat

map from our TD curve to identify conditions required for super-spreader events which included

viral load exceeding 107 SARS CoV-2 RNA copies and a high number of exposure contacts on

278

that day. We observed an inflection point between 106 and 107 SARS CoV-2 RNA copies where

279

large increases in the number of daily exposure contacts had a more limited impact on increasing

280

the number of transmissions from a single person (Fig 4a). The exposure contact network

281

occasionally resulted in days with ≥150 exposure contacts per day, which may allow an

282

extremely high number of secondary infections from a single person (Fig 4a).

283

We next plotted transmission events simulated on a daily basis over 30 days since

284

infection, from 10,000 transmitters, according to viral load at exposure and number of exposure

285

contacts on that day (Fig 4b). Secondary transmissions to only 1-3 people occurred almost

286

exclusively with daily numbers of exposure contacts below 10 with any exposure viral load

287

exceeding 106 RNA copies or with higher numbers of exposure contacts per day and viral loads

288

exceeding 105 RNA copies. Massive super-spreader events with over 50 infected people almost

289

always occurred at viral loads exceeding 107 RNA copies with high levels of concurrent

290

exposure contacts (Fig 4b).

291

We next identified that over 50% of secondary infections were associated with a

292

transmitter who has a high number of exposed contacts (11-100 per day) and a viral load

293

exceeding 106 RNA copies (Fig 4c), which is the mechanistic underpinning of why ~70% of all

294

secondary infections arose from transmitters who produced more than 10 secondary infections

(Table 1).

commonly used for measurements of influenza viral load, whereas viral RNA is used for SARS-

303

CoV-2. Nevertheless, TCID is a closer measure of infectious virus and it is thus reasonable that

304

ID50 based on TCID for influenza would be ~30-fold lower than ID50 based on total viral RNA

(infectious and non-infectious virus) for SARS-CoV-2.37

The other notable difference was a considerably lower 𝜌 value for influenza (Fig S3b),

317

denoting much less heterogeneity in the number of exposure contacts per person while the

318

average daily exposure contact was the same for both viruses (4 per day). The model captures the

319

fact that 40% of influenza infected people do not transmit to anyone else and that each increase

320

in the number of individual transmissions is associated with a lower probability (Fig. 5a).

321

Relative to SARS-CoV-2, super-spreader events involving 5 or more people were predicted to be

322

5-fold less common overall and 10-fold less common among transmitters (~2% of all infected

323

people and ~3% of transmitters) (Fig. 5b, Table 1). Super-spreaders defined as those infecting

324

≥5 individuals contributed to only ~10% to all transmissions (Table 1).

325

The model also recapitulated the lower variance of serial interval for influenza relative to

326

SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 5c, d). We next identified that the mean and variance of the serial interval

327

provide good approximations of the mean and variance for generation time. A majority of

328

generation times fell between 2 and 6 days (Fig 5e).

Viral load thresholds for influenza transmission. Based on the optimized TD curve for

339

influenza (Fig 6a), we next plotted the probability of infection given an exposure to an infected

340

person. The TD50 for influenza was 106.1 TCID/mL. Under various shedding scenarios, the

341

window of high probability transmission was limited to time points around peak viral load (Fig

342

6b-d). In general, infected persons were likely to be most infectious (i.e., above TD50) for a

343

~0.5-1.0 days period. The observed low variance in serial interval (Fig 5c) resulted primarily

344

from the narrow range of incubation periods within the transmitter and secondarily infected

345

person, as well as the limited variability in shedding patterns across transmitters.

364

exceeding 106 influenza TCID and a high number of exposure contacts per day. The contact

365

network never resulted in days with more than 15 exposure contacts per day, which severely

366

limited the possible number of transmissions from a single person relative to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig

367

7a, S3b).

368

We plotted transmission events simulated on a daily basis over 30 days since infection

369

from 10,000 transmitters according to viral load at exposure and number of exposure contacts on

370

that day (Fig 7b). Secondary transmissions to fewer than 5 people accounted for 90% of

371

infections (Table 1) and occurred with fewer than 10 daily exposure contacts and exposure viral

372

loads exceeding 104 TCID. Small scale super-spreader events with 5-10 infected people almost

373

always occurred at viral loads exceeding 105 TCID with 5-10 concurrent exposure contacts (Fig

374

7b).

375

We next identified that over 50% of infections were associated with a transmitter who

376

had fewer than 10 exposure contacts per day and a viral load exceeding 104.5 TCID (Fig 7c),

377

which is why no infected person ever transmitted to more than 10 other people (Table 1).

378
379

Differing exposed contact distributions, rather than viral kinetics, explain SARS CoV-2 super-

380

spreader events. We sought to explain why SARS-CoV-2 has a more over-dispersed distribution

381

of individual R0 relative to influenza. To assess viral kinetics as a potential factor, we

382

comparatively plotted transmission risk per exposure contact as a function of time since infection

383

in 10,000 transmitters for each virus. The median per contact transmission risk was slightly

384

higher for influenza; however, 75% and 95% transmission risks were marginally higher for

385

SARS-CoV-2 compared to influenza with slightly higher peak transmission risk, and a longer tail

386

of low transmission risk beyond 7 days (Fig 8a). The transmission risk was considerably higher

388

substantial subset of infected people may be more pre-disposed to super-spreading. When plotted

389

as time since onset of symptoms, the variability in transmission potential was considerably larger

for persons with high SARS-CoV-2 viral load, owing to the variable incubation period of this

virus (Fig 8b).

The median duration of shedding over infectivity thresholds was short and nearly

was 2.7 [0, 7] and 2.4 [1.6, 3.7] days respectively; median time above ID25 was 1.7 [0, 3] and

above ID90 was 0 [0, 0] and 0 [0, 0] days respectively. ID10, ID25 and ID50 values were more

424

We next plotted the frequency of exposure contacts per day for both viruses and noted a

425

higher frequency of days with no exposed contacts (Fig 8d), but also a higher frequency of days

426

with more than 10 exposure contacts (Fig 8e) for SARS-CoV-2 relative to influenza, despite an

427

equivalent mean number of daily exposure contacts. To confirm that this distribution drives the

428

different observed distributions of individual R0 values (Fig 8f), we simulated SARS-CoV-2

429

infection with an assumed 𝜌=1 and generated a distribution of individual R0 similar to that of

430

influenza (Fig S6a). Similarly, we simulated influenza infection with an assumed 𝜌=40 and

431

generated a distribution of individual R0 similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig S6b). Under all

432

scenarios, predicted distributions of serial interval (Fig 8g, Fig S6) and generation time (Fig 8h,

433

Fig S6) were unchanged by shifts in the exposed contact network.

434
435

Projections of targeted physical distancing. Physical distancing is a strategy to decrease R0. We

436

simulated a decrease in the contact rate uniformly across the population and noted a decrease in

437

population R0 (Fig S7a) as well the percent of infected people who will transmit (Fig 7b) and

438

become super-spreaders (Fig S7c-d). An approximately 40% decrease in the average exposed

439

contact rate decreased R0 below 1 (Fig S6a). We further investigated whether lowering contact

440

rate among larger groups only, in particular by banning exposure events with a high number of

441

exposure contacts, could control the epidemic. We identified that limiting exposure contacts to

442

no more than 5 per day is nearly equivalent to limiting exposure contacts altogether and that only

443

a small decrease in mean exposure contact rate can achieve R0<1 if exposure events with less

444

than 20 contacts are eliminated (Fig S8).

Pre-symptomatic transmission and super-spreading risk. Much of the highest transmission risk

for SARS-CoV-2 exists in the pre-symptomatic phase (Fig8b) which explains why 62% of

secondary transmissions R0≥10 fell in the pre-symptomatic period.

453

Discussion
Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 shedding kinetics are directly linked to the

454

virus’ most fundamental epidemiologic properties. First, we identify a transmission dose

455

response curve which specifies that a nasal viral load below 105 RNA copies is unlikely to

456

commonly result in transmission. For SARS-CoV-2, this threshold is consistent with the overall

457

rarity of positive cultures at these levels.37 We also predict a relatively steep TD curve such that

458

transmission becomes much more likely when shedding exceeds 108 viral RNA copies and there

459

is an exposure contact between an infected person and susceptible person. The amount of viral

460

RNA can be roughly converted to the probability of a positive viral culture which approximates

461

infectiousness. Our results therefore have relevance for dosing of SARS-CoV-2 in human

462

challenge experiments that are being considered for vaccine trials.

463

While the duration of shedding for SARS-CoV-2 is often three weeks or longer,11,12 we

464

predict that the duration of shedding above thresholds required for a moderate probability of

465

transmission per contact is much shorter, often less than half a day, and is comparable to that of

466

influenza. While transmission after the first week of infection is quite rare, our model is

467

consistent with the observation that transmissions commonly occur during the pre-symptomatic

468

phase of infection,2 given the highly variable incubation period associated with SARS-CoV-2.

469

The observed high heterogeneity in serial interval is attributable almost entirely to the

470

variable nature of the incubation period, rather than transmission occurring extremely late after

471

infection. While our estimate for mean generation time is equivalent to that of mean serial

472

interval, it is notable that the range of SARS-CoV-2 serial intervals is much wider than the range

473

of generation times. This result is evident even though we built substantial heterogeneity into our

474

viral shedding curves beyond that observed in the somewhat limited existing shedding data.

475

The finding of limited duration of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity has practical implications.

476

First, considerable resources are being used in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities to isolate

477

patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 shedding. We propose that a low nasal viral load,

478

particularly during late infection, need not justify full patient isolation procedures in the absence

479

of aerosolizing procedures. This observation could save substantial hospital resources and

480

valuable isolation beds during subsequent waves of infection. Similar considerations are relevant

481

for employees wishing to return to work. Our results also suggest that time since first positive

482

test may be predictive of lack of contagion, though more viral load kinetic studies will be needed

483

to confirm the existing observation that viral loads after a week of infection are usually low and

484

associated with negative viral cultures.37 Finally, our conclusions are supportive of rapid, less

485

sensitive assays which are more likely to detect infection at periods of contagion.43

486

Many of these conclusions, including specific viral load thresholds for transmission, a

487

steep dose response curve and a maximum 2-day duration of contagion within an infected

488

individual are equally relevant for influenza infection. One important difference is that

489

incubation periods for influenza are far less variable which means that at the individual level, the

490

serial interval is much more likely to be predictive of the generation time.

491

Another finding is that SARS-CoV-2 super-spreading events are dependent on a large

492

number of exposure contacts during the relatively narrow 1-2 days window during which a ~25%

493

subset of infected people is shedding at extremely high levels above the TD50. Because we

494

predict that super-spreader potential may be somewhat of a generalized property of infection,

495

rather than a characteristic of a tiny subset of infected people, this result also has practical

496

implications. A common experience during the pandemic has been early identification of a

497

cluster of infected people within a specific confined environment such as a senior living home,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.07.20169920; this version posted September 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this

498

crowded work environment, athletic team, or restaurant. Our results demonstrate that newly

499

diagnosed people within small clusters may be past the peak of their super-spreading potential.

500

At this stage, many more infections have often been established and drastic quarantine

501

procedures should be considered. Other undiagnosed, pre-symptomatic infected people may have

502

super-spreader potential while the known infected person is no longer contagious, highlighting

503

the importance of effective contact tracing.

504

At the prevention level, school opening and work opening strategies should focus on

505

severely limiting the possible number of exposure contacts per day. Where large numbers of

506

exposure contacts are unavoidable, mandatory masking policies, perhaps with N95 masks that

507

may more significantly lower exposure viral loads should be considered.23

508

Influenza infection is much less predisposed to super-spreader events than SARS-CoV-2.

509

Yet, influenza shedding at levels above those required for a high probability of transmission

510

occurs with only slightly lower frequency. Therefore, the markedly different probability of

511

super-spreader events between the two viruses is unlikely to relate to different viral host kinetics,

512

despite the fact that the overall duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding exceeds duration of influenza

513

shedding often by more than two weeks.

514

Rather, our analysis suggests that the exposure contact networks of SARS-CoV-2

515

transmitters are highly variable relative to those of influenza. One possible explanation

516

underlying this finding is that SARS-CoV-2 is more predisposed to airborne transmission than

517

influenza.44 Here our precise definition of an exposure contact (sufficient contact between a

518

transmitter and an uninfected person to potentially allow transmission) is of high relevance. Our

519

result suggests that a SARS-CoV-2 infected person in a crowded, poorly ventilated room, may

520

generate more exposure contacts than an influenza infected person in the same room, likely

521

based on wider dispersal and / or longer airborne survival of the virus. Thus, our results suggest a

522

possible downstream quantitative effect of airborne transmission on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology.

523

Another possibly important variable is that pre-symptomatic transmission, which is a common

524

feature of SARS-CoV-2 may predispose to multiple transmissions. This prediction reinforces

525

current public health recommendation to avoid crowded indoor spaces with poor air

526

recirculation.

On the other hand, a much higher proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected people than

528

influenza infected people do not transmit at all. This result lacks a clear mechanistic explanation

529

but may imply that aerosolization occurs only in a subset of infected people. One theoretical

530

explanation is that high viral load shedding in the pre-symptomatic phase is defined by lack of

531

cough or sneeze leading to limited spatial diffusion of virus. Alternatively, it is also possible that

532

a proportion of infected people never shed virus at high enough viral loads to allow efficient

533

transmission. This possibility speaks to the need for more quantitative viral load data gathered

534

during the initial stages of infection.

535

Age cohort structure differs between the two infections, with a lower proportion of

536

observed pediatric infections for SARS-CoV-2. If adults have more high exposure events than

537

children, then this could also explain super-spreader events. We are less enthusiastic about this

538

hypothesis. First, SARS-CoV-2 super-spreader events have occurred in schools and camps and

539

would likely be more common in the absence of widespread global school closures in high

540

prevalence regions. Second, a sufficient proportion of influenza cases occur in adults to rule out

541

the presence of frequent large super-spreading events in this population.

542
543

Our analysis has important limitations. First, exposure contacts were assumed to be
homogeneous and we do not capture the volume of the exposing aerosol or droplet. For instance,

544

if a large-volume droplet contains ten times more viral particles than an aerosol droplet, then the

545

exposure could be dictated by this volume as well as the viral load of the potential transmitter. It

546

is possible that under rare circumstances with extremely high-volume exposures, even persons

547

with extremely low viral loads may transmit. Second, based on the quality of available data, we

548

fit our models for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza to viral RNA and viral culture respectively.

549

Existing data suggest that kinetics of viral RNA and culture are similar during both infections,

550

with culture having lower sensitivity to detect virus.37 Third, our intra-host model of SARS-

551

CoV-2 was fit to heterogeneous data with different sampling techniques and PCR assays.24

552

Moreover, R0 estimates have varied across the globe. Our estimates of TD50 are necessarily

553

imprecise based on available data and should serve only as a conservative benchmark. Most

554

importantly, we cannot rule out the possibility that a small minority of infected people shed at

555

sufficient levels for transmission for much longer than has been observed to date. Fourth,

556

contagiousness could have different dose response dynamics than viral load dependent

557

infectiousness and may require investigation in the future upon the availability of

558

epidemiologically relevant additional data. Finally, the model is intended to capture a general

559

property of SARS-CoV-2 infection but is not specific for local epidemics. The degree of R0

560

overdispersion in various countries and regions is likely to vary dramatically according to

561

numerous factors related to social contact networks that are not explicitly captured in our model.

562

In conclusion, fundamental epidemiologic features of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza

563

infections can be directly related to viral shedding patterns in the upper airway as well as the

564

nature of exposure contact networks. We contend that this information should be leveraged for

565

more nuanced public health practice in the next phase of the pandemic.

SARS-CoV-2 within-host model. To simulate SARS-CoV-2 shedding dynamics, we employed our

569

previously-described viral infection model.24 In this model, susceptible cells (S) after coming into

570

contact with SARS-CoV-2 (V) become infected at rate 𝛽𝑉𝑆. The infected cells (I) produce new

571

virus at a per-capita rate 𝜋. The model also includes the clearance of infected cells in two ways:

(1) by an innate response with density dependent rate 𝛿𝐼 ! ; and (2) an acquired response with rate

immunity depends on the infected cell density and is controlled by the exponent 𝑘. The Hill

575

coefficient 𝑟 parameterizes the nonlinearity of the second response and allows for rapid saturation

of the killing. Parameter 𝜙 defines the effector cell level by which killing of infected cells by 𝐸 is

577

half maximal.

In the model, SARS-CoV-2-specific effector cells rise after 2 stages from precursors cells

580

with rate 𝜔𝐼𝑀) and differentiates into the effector cell at a per capita rate 𝑞 during the next

581

intermediate stage. Finally, effector cells die at rate 𝛿𝐸 . The model is expressed as a system of

582

ordinary differential equations:

590

continue for long period (over 6 weeks). Indeed, while median viral shedding duration has been

591

estimated at 12-20 days, shedding for many months is also observed commonly.45 We assumed

592

that viral loads after day 20 drop to a exposure-level viral load level (i.e., 𝑉(0)) as most viral

593

shedding observed after this point is transient and at an extremely low viral load.46 The population

Transmission Model and Reproduction number. Our transmission model assumes that only some

615

contacts of an infected individual with viral load dependent infectiousness are physically exposed

616

to the virus (defined as exposure contacts), that only some exposure contacts have virus passaged

617

to their airways (contagiousness) and that only some exposed contacts with virus in their airways

618

become secondarily infected (successful secondary infection). Contagiousness and infectiousness

619

are then treated as viral load dependent multiplicative probabilities with transmission risk for a

620

single exposure contact being the product. Contagiousness is considered to be viral load dependent

621

based on the concept that a transmitter’s dispersal cloud of virus is more likely to prove contagious

622

at higher viral load, which is entirely separate from viral infectivity within the airway once a virus

623

contacts the surface of susceptible cells.

624

We next assume that the total exposed contacts within a time step (𝜂9# ) is gamma

625

distributed, i.e. 𝜂9# ~𝛤 Q; , 𝜌R Δ5 , using the average daily contact rates (𝜃) and the dispersion

626

parameter (𝜌). To obtain the true number of exposure contacts with airway exposure to virus, we

627

simply multiply the contagiousness of the transmitter with the total exposed contacts within a time

628

step (i.e., 𝜁5 = 𝜂9# 𝑃5 ).

:

629

Transmissions within a time step are simulated stochastically using time-dependent viral

630

load to determine infectiousness (𝑃5 ). Successful transmission is modelled stochastically by

631

drawing a random uniform variable (𝑈(0,1)) and comparing it with infectiousness of the

632

transmitter. In the case of successful transmission, the number of secondary infections within that

633

time step (𝑇9# ) is obtained by the product of the infectiousness (𝑃5 ) and the number of exposure

634

contacts drawn from the gamma distribution (𝜁5 ). In other words, the number of secondary

635

infections for a time step is 𝑇9# = 𝐵𝑒𝑟(𝑃5 )𝑃5 𝜂9# . If we disregard contagiousness by assuming 𝑃5 =

636

1 in 𝜁5 , we identify that there are little to no differences on overall results other than the emergent

637

TD curve and optimal parameter set describing dose-response curve and exposed contact network,

638

which no longer agrees as closely with in vitro probability of positive virus culture (Fig S5).37

639

We obtain the number of secondary infections from a transmitter on a daily basis noting

640

that viral load, and subsequent risk, does not change substantially within a day. We then summed

641

up the number of secondary infections over 30 days since the time of exposure to obtain the

642

individual reproduction number, i.e. 𝑅0 = ∑9# 𝑇9# .

Serial interval and generation time. We further assume that upon successful infection, it takes 𝜏

645

days for the virus to move within-host, reach infection site and produce the first infected cell.

646

To calculate serial interval (time between the onset of symptoms of transmitter and secondarily

647

infected person), we sample the incubation period in the transmitter and in the secondarily infected

648

person from a gamma distribution with a shape described in the Fig S4.3,30 In cases in which

649

symptom onset in the newly infected person precedes symptom onset in the transmitter, the serial

650

interval is negative; otherwise, serial interval is non-negative. We calculate generation time as the

651

difference between the time of infection of transmitter and the time of infection of secondarily

infected person.

Individual R0 and serial interval data for model fitting. There is abundance of data confirming

655

over-dispersed R0 for SARS-CoV-2. From contact tracing of 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases in

656

Shenzhen, China, 1286 close contacts were identified: the distribution of individual R0 values in

657

this cohort was highly over-dispersed, with 80% of secondary infections being caused by 8-9% of

658

infected people.6 In another study, authors analyzed the contact/travel history of 135 infected cases

659

in Tianjin, China and determined heterogeneity in the individual R0.34 Another contract tracing

660

study also identified and characterized SARS-CoV-2 clusters in Hong Kong and estimated that

661

20% of cases were responsible for 80% of local transmission.35

662

A modeling study that simulated observed outbreak sizes in ~40 affected countries during

663

the early phase of epidemics also confirmed that ~80% of secondary transmissions may have been

664

caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (~10%).4 The latter study provided the

665

distribution of individual R0 (Fig 2A) that we employed for fitting purposes. Using the data on

The cumulative distribution function of individual R0 for influenza was obtained from a

modeling study that simulated the transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza in Switzerland

671

from 2003 to 2015.10 We picked the parameters mean R0=1.26 and dispersion parameter=2.36 in

672

the negative binomial distribution that corresponded to the 2008-2009 influenza A H1N1

673

pandemic.10 Another modeling study that simulated the age-specific cumulative incidence of 2009

674

H1N1 influenza in 8 Southern Hemisphere Countries yielded similar results.40 By following the

675

household members of index cases, a study estimated the cumulative distribution of serial interval

based on symptom-onset times from 14 transmission pairs.9 We employed these cumulative

We visually checked whether our dose-response curve matched the observed probability

707

of positive virus culture.37 We assumed that viral loads derived from positive culture37 can be

708

considered equivalent to viral loads in the within-host model if divided by a positive integer. We

709

identified an integer of 25 to provide closest fit to the empirical data (Fig S5).

We performed a global sensitivity analysis to identify which parameter variability

711

accounted for fit to different components of the data. Only narrow ranges of l permitted close fit

712

to the mean of R0 and distribution functions of individual R0 (Fig S9), while a specific value for

713

a was necessary to fit to mean serial interval and distribution functions of individual R0 (Fig

714

S9). Only narrow ranges of q permitted close fit to the mean of R0 and distribution functions of

715

individual R0 (Fig S10), while a specific value for r was necessary to fit to distribution functions

716

of individual R0 (Fig S10).

Fig S5. Mathematical model recapitulation of relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load
and viral culture. In a clinical study, probability of positive viral culture was projected against
SARS-CoV-2 RNA (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.20125310v1). When
we divided these PCR values by 25 (light blue line), we identified high similarity between the
clinical data and our projected infectiousness dose response curve (red line).

Fig S6. Impact of changes in contact network heterogeneity on individual R0, serial
interval, and generation time. A. SARS-CoV-2, and B. influenza. Lowering exposed contact
network heterogeneity to levels observed with influenza decreases SARS-CoV-2 individual R0
over-dispersion. Increasing exposed contact network heterogeneity to levels observed with
SARS-CoV-2 increases influenza R0 over-dispersion. Neither change impacts observed serial
interval or estimate generation time.

Fig S8. Potential impact of enhanced physical distancing only within high exposure contact
networks on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. Simulations assume limitation of exposed contacts
only among daily exposures of more than 5, 10, 20 or 50 people. Mean reproductive number
decreases below one with only marginal decreases in overall rate of exposure contacts when
contacts are limited to fewer than 20 people.
