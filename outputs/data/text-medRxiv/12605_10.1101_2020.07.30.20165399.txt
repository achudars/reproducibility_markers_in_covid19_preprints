Abstract

Objectives.

We analysed mortality rates in a non­metropolitan UK subregion (Northamptonshire) to

understand SARS­CoV­2 disease fatalities at sub 1,000,000 population levels. A numerical (SEIR) model was
then developed to predict the spread of Covid­19 in Northamptonshire.

Methods. A combined approach using statistically-weighted data to fit the start of the epidemic to
the mortality record. Parameter estimates were then derived for the transmission rate and basic
reproduction number.

Results. Age standardised mortality rates are highest in Northampton (urban) and lowest in semi-

rural districts. Northamptonshire has a statistically higher Covid-19 mortality rate than for the East
Midlands and England as a whole. Model outputs suggest the number of infected individuals exceed
official estimates, meaning less than 40% of the population may require immunisation.

Conclusions. Combining published (sub-regional) mortality rate data with deterministic models on
disease spread has the potential to help public health practitioners develop bespoke mitigations,
guided by local population demographics.

Introduction
Since the global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, the UK has been one of the hardest hit
nations in reported mortality rates, with deaths by 1 million of the population second only to
Belgium. Lockdown in the UK started on March 24 2020, several weeks later than elsewhere in
mainland Europe. The UK response has been criticised by some for lagging, despite early mortality
data from Hubei, China, South Korea and Italy, where sufficient data have been gathered to model
the initial spread of the virus1,2,3.
Despite this, it is important not to rely entirely on data aggregated at national level to make local
public health interventions, once the virus has taken a steady hold. Given the duration since the first
recorded deaths in the UK, the opportunity now presents itself to look more closely at regional and
sub regional trends that impact on location-specific public health mitigations4. The aim of this
research is to analyse in detail mortality rates due to Covid-19 in a non-metropolitan UK subregion
(Northamptonshire) to understand SARS-CoV-2 disease fatalities at granular (< 1 million) population
level. Northamptonshire was chosen as case study because while largely a rural county, it has

significant centres of urban population with mixed ethnicity, typical of English counties more
generally. The detailed comparisons made on mortality rates (and place of death) are a useful
catalogue in themselves. In addition, they provide robust input for deterministic models seeking to
understand how the virus is spread.2
This paper comprises two parts: 1. An analysis of publicly available mortality data in
Northamptonshire benchmarked nationally and regionally, and 2) a SEIR mathematical model that
applies these data to better understand viral spread locally. Our goal is to combine observations
with mathematical models to help prepare for better long-term regional planning in event of a
second (or move) waves of Covid-19, should it occur.

Methods
Data on age standardised mortality rates involving Covid-19 form the period March to June 2020,
published on July 24 by the ONS for each district and local authority in Northamptonshire, were
analysed5. The rates between geographical areas were different (p<0.05) if there was no overlap in
the 95% confidence intervals for the comparison areas. All data used in this study are publicly
available and licenced for use under ONS Open Access rules. The SEIR model was run using COMSOL
v. 5.5 Multiphysics (Finite Element) software, calibrated against weekly ONS death rates by
occurrence in Northamptonshire.

Regional Mortality Rates
East Midlands
The East Midlands is one of nine official regions of England at the first level of NUTS (The
Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) for statistical purposes. It consists of six English
counties, including Northamptonshire, with a combined population of 4.811 million6. The largest
city by population is Leicester, site of the first sub-national lockdown in the UK. Northampton is the
fourth largest conurbation in the region. A time-series comparison of national to sub-regional
mortality rates, is shown in Fig. 1.

Northamptonshire
Northamptonshire (population 753,2786, density 316 km squared), is the southernmost county in
the East Midlands region, covering an area of 2,364 square kilometres. The major urban centre is
Northampton (population, 224,6106). The 2011 census showed the county split evenly between
males (49.5%) and females (50.5%), with 18.1% of the population aged 65 years and older. Nearly
90% of the population are white (British or other). In terms of governance, Northamptonshire is
currently divided into seven boroughs and local district councils following a two-tier structure
of local government. In March 2018, new structural changes were proposed that see the existing
boroughs and district councils replaced by two unitary authorities of West and South
Northamptonshire.

Analysis
Comparison of age-standardised Covid-19 death rates between Northamptonshire
areas
Registered deaths due to Covid-19 in Northamptonshire over the current period of study are 715,
comprising approximately 25% of total registered deaths over the same period. The data have been
broken down by region and district to allow comparisons. The first recorded Covid-19 death was on
March 17 (t = 0, week 11), peaking individually at total 98 registered deaths in week 15 (April 13-19).
Regarding place of death, the majority (c. 72%) occurred in hospital. When disaggregated into the
seven comprising districts it becomes clear that Northampton is the dominant contributor to the

overall curve profile with the highest Covid-19 mortality rate (Table 1). This is statistically different,
at the 5% level, from all other local authority areas except for Corby. South Northamptonshire has
the lowest Covid-19 mortality rate, although only the differences with that of Northampton and
Kettering are statistically significant. Compared regionally, Northamptonshire has a statistically
higher Covid-19 mortality rate than for the East Midlands as a whole. Both the East Midlands region
and Northamptonshire have statistically significantly higher rates than for the whole of England (Fig.
2 and Table 1).
The new political structure, due to take effect in April 2021, has consequences for the future
management and resourcing of public health in its ambition to reduce health inequalities. However,
if the new Unitary Authorities were in place, then there would be no statistically significant
difference in the Covid-19 mortality rates between them. This is because Northampton, with the
highest rate in the county, and South Northamptonshire, with the lowest, are both in the West
Northamptonshire Unitary Authority.

Provisional SEIR model for Northamptonshire
One of the simplest mathematical techniques used to predict disease transmission is the SEIR (or
SIR) model7,8,9 which divides a population N at t = 0 into four ‘compartments’ of susceptible S(t),
exposed (meaning infected but not yet infectious) E(t), Infectious, I(t) and recovered R(t). Individuals
move between compartments in the model at a rate determined by four interlinked ordinary
differential equations such that S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N. SEIR models are deterministic and average
the infectiousness across a susceptible population. They are thus different from stochastic models
where infection is modelled via discrete interactions between individuals10,11. Key variables in both
include the transmission rate by infectious individuals (β), the average number of days a person is
infectious (n), and the recovery rate γ (1/n). They are related via: β = R0/n, where R0 is the basic
reproduction number. Any mitigation strategy must aim to reduce the reproduction number, for
example by decreasing the transmission rate or the time infections individuals are isolated 12.
Current uncertainties in the modelling relate explicitly to the details of disease transmission. Covid19 is transmitted from symptomatic (infected) people through respiratory droplets or contact with
contaminated materials13. The infectious period (n) appears maximised in the first three days after
infection. The incubation period for COVID-19, which is the time between exposure and symptom
onset is 5-6 days on average but can be up to 14 days14. During this time (pre-symptomatic) period,
an unknown fraction of infected individuals may be contagious, meaning transmission can occur
before symptom onset. The model assumes homogenous mixing within the population and does not
account for asymptomatic transmission. Imported cases are also excluded, although provision exists
to add this variable in future modelling.
Two scenarios are presented, one where the virus is left to run its course after the first registered
deaths at t = 0 for a period of 120 days. The second model (with restrictions), follows the UK
Government response with lock down mitigations imposed on March 24, seven days later. It mimics
the effects of social distancing from t = 7 onwards by reducing the transmission rate and basic
reproduction number relative to the ‘no restrictions’ case by 40% (Table 2). Although the results are
provisional and subject to revision as new data emerge (meaning the parameterised fit to the
mortality data may change), they nonetheless provide information about disease veracity and
spread useful for guiding public health mitigation at sub-regional level4 (see discussion).

Results
Results from the SEIR models are summarised in Table 2. The basic reproduction number (2.9) in the
‘no-reductions’ case lies within the reported range for Covid-1915, consistent with early exponential

spread of the virus7. The simulations highlight the positive impact of reductions on the mortality
rate. Allowed to spread uninhibited, total predicted deaths exceed 4500 against an actual registered
of 715, c. six times higher than currently recorded. In contrast, the ‘with reductions’ scenario
predicts 633 deaths over the same period. The potential number of infected individuals is reflected
in the number of recovered (Rt) cases. The ‘with reductions’ model implies 135,800 discrete
exposures to the virus over the simulation period, equating to approximately 18% of the total
population. This value is significantly in excess of cases reported for Northamptonshire16 and is
received with caution. It is however consistent with evidence for significant underreporting of
infections during the initial phase of the pandemic. For example, only around 15% of active cases
were registered in Wuhan,17,18 while SIR modelling by Lourenco et al19 suggest the epidemic in the
UK started at least a month before the first reported death. If so, that introduces a minimum lag in
the Northamptonshire data of t = -78 days, enough in principle to build up a sizeable reservoir of
unreported cases.

Discussion
Implications for vaccination and herd immunity
We end with a practical example of how SEIR model outputs can be used to help inform public
health interventions locally. Predictions of numbers of recovered cases allow estimates of the critical
fraction (ρc) of the total susceptible population S(t) needed to be vaccinated to ensure herd
immunity8. This threshold is equal to 1-1/R0.
At the onset of a new infection where there are no prior cases, it is reasonable to assume S(t) = ρ,
the proportion that require vaccination. However, the SEIR models reveal a sizeable (hidden)
fraction R(t) of recovered cases. These individuals can be excluded, reducing the overall size of the
susceptible population by /  . Thus, to prevent sustained spread, the revised fraction of
the population requiring immunisation must satisfy the inequality:



௖ (1-ϕ).

(1)

From the SEIR ‘with reductions’ model, ρc is estimated at a provisional 37% of the population (Table
2). Other independent estimates of heard immunity support the idea that Covid-19 critical
immunisation thresholds may be substantially less than 50%, especially where some fraction of the
population is prevented from transmitting the virus20. Should the need arise, statistical analysis
(Table 1), suggests Northampton should be treated as a priority target.
We stress again caution is required in when interpreting SEIR model outputs based on data early in
the pandemic. As experience from previous epidemics has shown7,9,12, initial results may require
subsequent revision. Future work will seek to incorporate the geographical and demographic
variations identified in the statistical analysis (Table 1) to help refine SEIR models that provide
deeper understanding of the dynamics of Covid-19 at sub-regional level.

Conclusions
Initial results show Northamptonshire mortality rates due to Covid-19 are higher than both regional
and national averages. Northampton is the single biggest contributor to mortality rates, with South
Northamptonshire the lowest (significance level 0.05). This trend follows current known
distributions in health inequalities16. A SEIR model, collaborated by fitting to mortality rate, yields
predictions about the dynamics of virus spread and local impact of reductions in β and R0. The
introduction of national restrictions (social distancing) may have resulted in up to 4000 fewer deaths
in Northamptonshire. Estimates of recovery rates suggest up to 18% of individuals in the county may
