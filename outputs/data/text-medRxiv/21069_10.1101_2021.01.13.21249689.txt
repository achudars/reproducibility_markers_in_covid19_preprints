Running Head: Professional trainings’ impact on COVID-19

Abstract
Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 has remained a massive challenge for healthcare
workers specially physicians. Effective professional training has a crucial role in preparing
doctors for responding to pandemics.
Objective: To assess the effectiveness of existing training modules on enhancing knowledge,
ensuring safe practice, and improving behavior on COVID-19 among physicians.
Methods: This is a descriptive, cross-sectional, online survey; where a virtual questionnaire was
used to collect data through online professional platforms. A pre-tested survey tool was
employed to assess the impact of professional training on infection prevention and control.
Results: Total 161 physicians participated in this survey from 15 different countries. Most of the
respondents (72%) received training from various sources like the workplace (60%) and
international agencies (21%), through the in-person or online format. Knowledge assessment
revealed advanced (43%) and competent (40%) understanding by the participants. Improving
knowledge progression was displayed by the cohort who received professional training (p<0.00).
Physicians’ positive behavior and good practices were observed with the training modules.
Conclusion: It became evident from this study, that professional training is effective in
enhancing knowledge, improving behavior, and ensuring safe practices. Hence, designing such
training modules for the physicians is warranted to tackle ongoing and future pandemics.
Keywords: COVID-19; professional training; pandemic; knowledge assessment.

1. Introduction
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a global threat since it was identified in late 20191.
COVID-19 infection is a highly contagious disease and has affected a large population, the total
number of deaths caused by this virus has exceeded any of its predecessors. As of early
November 2020, more than 49 million confirmed cases, and one million confirmed deaths across
the globe, as reported by the WHO2. The first wave of the outbreak took place between March
and July 2020. The world is clearly in the grip of a second wave of COVID-19 since JulyAugust, with no imminent vaccine in sight3, 4. This pandemic has instigated a global economic
downturn regardless of the income level of the country5. It is essential to provide the safety of
healthcare workers not only to sustain continuous patient care but also to ensure they do not
transmit the virus6. The medical community worldwide was confronted with the need to treat a
new, unknown disease, where patients’ management was challenging as current guidelines are

lacking and some of the used therapies are only addressed to patients included in trials7, 8.
Medical information is rapidly and continuously being updated as new data are available while
fighting this emerging disease8.
The COVID-19 outbreak is a huge challenge for physicians, who need strong comprehensive
skills to deal with it effectively. Continuing medical education has an imperative role in
preparing for and responding to such emergencies. To mitigate the outbreak and defy the
pandemic, different online courses for healthcare workers around the world were initiated; funds
were raised globally; strategic preparedness and response plan (SPRP) was set up aimed to
protect the health care systems7. In this era of physical distancing, numerous online training for
physicians provides an additional advantage of instant knowledge acquisition, flexible learning,
and rapid management of patients. Increasing the level of knowledge and proper training of
physicians can significantly curb the development and transmission of disease to other patients
and health care workers (HCW). Therefore, hospitals that provide services to patients with
suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should aim to increase the level of knowledge of HCW and
provide them with high-level training9.
Though there are many training modalities available in various formats, we have scanty reports
on their effectiveness. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of existing training
modules on enhancing knowledge, ensuring safe practice, and improving behavior among the
physicians. Our findings would increase awareness to gain professional knowledge through
Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) training and prepare physicians for COVID-19's next
waves to come.

2. Methods
An observational, cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among physicians who are
licensed to practice in different countries by using a validated structured questionnaire in
September 2020; when the world has experienced the first wave of COVID-19 infection and
waiting for proper vaccination.
A questionnaire was developed containing 31 items by using WHO guidance document10,
previously used survey tools11, 12, and web-based materials13 on emerging respiratory viruses,
including COVID-19. The survey covered physicians’ characteristics, awareness, information
sources, knowledge, behavior, and practices related to COVID-19. The draft survey instruments
were created using Google© form and were made accessible through a web link to 15 experts
from different geographic regions to assess its consistency, clarity, relevance, and acceptability.
Another seven (7) physicians evaluated the feasibility of the survey as well as assessed the
approximate time to finish. Those responses were not included in the final analysis of the
research project.
Refinements were made as needed to encourage a clearer understanding and organized the
questions before the final survey was circulated via a Web link to the targeted population. The
31-item survey took approximately 15 minutes to complete. The survey instruments were
divided into four parts having questions on participants’ information (13 items), and knowledge
(08 items), behavior (05 items), practice (05 items) related to COVID-19.

The information section included questions on general demographic, knowledge was evaluated
by multiple-choice questions focusing on etiology, signs and symptoms, transmission, and risk
avoidance of COVID-19. Each response was scored either as correct or wrong, with total scores
ranging from 0 to 8. A cut-off level of <4 was considered to indicate poor knowledge about
COVID-19, whereas 4-6 was deemed to be competent and >6 as advanced. Behavior and
practices toward COVID-19 were assessed using 05 items in each section, and each question was
labeled as “Yes” or “No”; scores ranged from 0 to 5.
Data Analysis:
The collected data were validated, coded, and analyzed using SPSS version 24 (IBM).
Descriptive analysis was applied to calculate frequencies and proportions. The chi-square test
was used to investigate the level of association among variables. A p-value of less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Ethical Consideration:
The institutional review and approval for the study protocol were obtained (Ref: HFRCMCIRC/2020.09.050). Throughout the analysis, the confidentiality of personal information was
protected by keeping the data of participants anonymous and asking participants to provide
truthful answers. The involvement of qualified physicians in this survey was voluntary and was
not paid. Electronic informed consent was shown on the initial page of the survey. The study was
performed following the Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2013.
Study Subjects:
A convenience purposive sampling technique was used to select participants. The survey link
was circulated to the physicians through verified online professional and social media platforms.
A total of one hundred sixty-one (161) physicians participated in this study from different
countries worldwide and responded voluntarily. During the data collection process, participants
confidentially were strictly and adequately maintained, and all collected data were doublechecked, sorted, and cleaned for consistency.

3. Results
Overview
A total of 161 physicians participated, including 128 (79%) men and most of them were either in
the age group of 25-35 years (35%) or 46-55 years (37%). Doctors from 15 different countries
responded to our survey and the majority belonged to lower-middle-income countries 114 (71%).
Professionally, most of our participants were in early career stage 69 (43%), working primarily
in outpatient setup (39%). More than one-third of the respondents were directly involved in
dealing with known COVID-19 cases, and about half of them (n=25) were diagnosed positive for
novel coronavirus infection. Table 1 shows the sociodemographic details and table 2 summarized
the professional and COVID-19 related information of the participants.

Association of professional training with knowledge on COVID-19
Participants’ IPAC training was found to be effective in the areas of knowledge progression,
behavior, and practice towards COVID-19. There was an uptrend in the total knowledge among
the respondents who received training, while the opposite was displayed by the non trained
cohort (Figure 1). A significant relationship (p<0.000) was observed in responding to high
difficulty questions by the advanced trained participants. Duration or source of training showed
no differences yet, training duration had a positive impact on knowledge progression.

Behavior towards COVID-19
More than 68% of the physicians exhibited a positive behavior towards COVID-19. Though
statistically not significant (p=0.06), our respondents showed more positive behavior patterns in
the professionally trained group. Almost similar behavioral status was observed across the
clusters of participants.

Practice about COVID-19
While dealing with COVID-19 issues, the majority of the doctors (60%) demonstrated good
practice. Training has positively impacted the physicians’ practice to the disease, not
significantly (p=0.06), but some extent. Almost similar practices were observed across the
clusters of participants. Overall knowledge, behavior, and practice level of the respondents are
displayed in Table 5.

4. Discussion
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has put an overwhelming burden on the health systems of all
the countries. To face the challenges immediate, effective, and appropriate responses along with
interventions and policy changes were needed10. Health and safety of first-line (healthcare)
workers are of great concern, as they are one of the most vulnerable groups to get exposed to
infections11 while caring for patients. Proper IPAC training can significantly prevent the spread
of infection among healthcare workers by enhancing knowledge, altering attitudes, and affecting
the practice14.
The present cross-sectional, online survey was conducted to explore the effects of IPAC training
interventions on the knowledge, behavior, and practice of physicians in a global context. This is
one of the earliest among such studies conducted on physicians’ perspectives about the COVID19 pandemic. This study was conducted toward the later phase of the pandemic (September
2020). The findings would help us to explore the causal relationship between the knowledge
domain of IPAC, behavior, and practice among physicians. As well it would reveal the role of
IPAC training on physician’s practices, and the risk of getting infected. Previous studies proved
the efficacy of training in altering the knowledge, perception, confidence, psychosocial attitudes,
and beliefs of the physicians in other clinical areas15, 16. Some recent studies also have suggested
more focused training towards improving understanding of risks and prevention of COVID-1912,
17
. An assessment of HCW knowledge, attitudes, and practices could provide an insight into the
prevention of COVID-19 and stopping further spread of the epidemic11, 12, 14.
More than half (54%) of the respondents in the present survey belonged to a relatively younger
age group (<25 years to 45 years). This finding is supported by previous works where the
majority of respondents belonged to similar groups18-20. We used an online platform for reaching
out to our target population, as this media is more popular among this age group of people, it was
reflected through this finding.

Considering the geographical location, we had physicians from fifteen countries: Canada, USA,
Brazil, Malaysia, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, UK, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Oman, Saudi Arabia,
Australia, Turkey, and UAE. We have categorized the country distribution based on the world
bank’s economic data21 into; high-income, middle-income, and lower-middle-income groups.
Though the overall health system performance index is higher for wealthy nations22, our study
results did not show any significant differences in knowledge, behavior, and practices impacted
by IPAC training throughout the geographical span of respondents.
There was a distinctive almost even pattern of the current professional level among our
respondents. They belonged to the two extreme levels, 43% were in their early career, followed
by 35% either being professors or consultants, and the least 24% were at their intermediate
career. In previously published reports the respondents were mostly between 1-5 years’
experience category 66%11, 72%18, and 64%23. There were no significant differences observed
between the professional levels of our physicians.
When asked about ever being infected with COVID-19, more than 14% of the respondents said
they were tested positive for the disease. Up to mid-June 2020 in Ontario, Canada 5815 HCW
were confirmed to have COVID-1924. In Bangladesh, till August 10, 2020, a total of 7442 health
workers have been infected with the coronavirus, among them, 2542 were physicians with 105
deaths25.
The majority of respondents in the present study sought medical/scientific information about
COVID-19 from national/international guidelines like- WHO/CDC/local ministry of health
(>86%). Similar findings were reported before26, however, many articles have denoted that
majority of their respondents relied on unverified resources like social media, web blogs, word of
mouth, and so on18, 19, 23, 27. Since most of our respondents obtained information from
international or national official sources, this signifies the validity of their information, which
ensures proper behavior and practice pertaining to infection prevention and control.
Receiving IPAC training for COVID-19 was very high (72%) among our respondents. The
majority (60%) of the training were from their workplace, and 21% from WHO/CDC. About
50% of the responding physicians received their training both online and in-person and 62% of
those training sessions were for more than 3 hours. Despite reasonable searches, we did not find
any studies revealing the information about IPAC training and its correlation with knowledge,
behavior, and practice of physicians or HCWs.
In the knowledge domain, most of our respondents could correctly choose the right answers. The
majority of our participants showed high knowledge scores and they were considered either as
competent (40%) or as advanced (43%). Receiving training influenced the knowledge score
considerably, which also varied significantly among the knowledge categories. About 70% of the
respondent scored more than 6 out of 8 and 9% scored 100% correct. Considering the cut-off
score of 4, more than 96% of the respondents had good knowledge of COVID-19. The reason
behind this high knowledge score could be because the study was conducted towards the later
phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as receiving IPAC training from different sources.

Knowledge is an important factor that directly affects behavior and practice11, 19. High levels of
knowledge score in our study are in keeping with high confidence levels among the physicians.
Most of our respondents showed positive behavior (69%) and good practices (60%) towards
COVID-19. This trend was higher in the cohort that received IPAC training. The relationship
between higher knowledge and better behavior/practices were reported before by other studies18,
26-28
.
Strength:
To our knowledge, this is the earliest report of training effectiveness on knowledge, behavior,
and practice of physicians regarding COVID-19. The questionnaire was designed based on the
information available on WHO, CDC, and national regulatory websites. Moreover, a dual
validation was performed to increase the reliability of the study results.
Limitations:
As convenience sampling was used, the results could not be generalizable. Since it was an
asynchronous, web-based, cross-sectional survey, there are fair chances for the participants to
seek the correct answers online before responding.
Future Directions:
Considering the training effectiveness pattern of our study, a robust, multicentre, and systematic
experiment could be designed to better understand the significance of training modules.

5. Conclusion
The unprecedented global pandemic calls for substantial awareness about the novel coronavirus.
Particularly, physicians as the leader of combating this challenge should have extensive
readiness to prevent and manage COVID-19 efficiently. Proper information and data need to be
cascaded from the authentic sources to avoid the ongoing jeopardy around this novel contagion.
Our study finding highlights that IPAC training is effective in enhancing the knowledge of the
doctors. We also revealed improvement in behavior and practices in response to the training.
Therefore, we strongly recommend to design and implement appropriate training modules for the
physicians as well as other HCW to alleviate the waves of COVID-19 and other outbreaks to
come.
