Abstract
Introduction: There has been a substantial reduction in admissions to hospital with exacerbations of
airways diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic, likely because measures introduced to prevent the
spread of SARS-CoV-2 also reduced transmission of other respiratory viruses. The acceptability to
patients of continuing such interventions beyond the pandemic as a measure to prevent
exacerbations is not known.
Method: An online survey of people living with respiratory disease was created by the Asthma UK –
British Lung Foundation Partnership. People were asked what infection control measures they
expected to continue themselves, and what they thought should be policy for the population more
generally in the future, once the COVID-19 pandemic had subsided.
Results: 4442 people completed the survey: 3627 with asthma, 258 with bronchiectasis and 557
with COPD. Regarding personal behaviour, 79.5% would continue increased handwashing, 68.6%
social distancing indoors, 46.9% would continue to wear a face covering in indoor public places
(45.7% on public transport), and 59.3% would avoid friends and family who were unwell with a
respiratory infection. 45.6% wanted healthcare professionals to continue wearing a mask when
seeing patients. 60.7% thought that face coverings should continue to be worn by everyone in
indoor public spaces during the ‘flu season. Women and older people were, in general, more
cautious.
Conclusion: People living with airways diseases are supportive of infection control measures to
reduce the risk of exacerbations and such measures should be considered for inclusion in guidelines.
Further research to refine understanding of the most effective approaches is needed.

Introduction
Chronic airway diseases comprising asthma, bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) are very common [1-3]. People living with these conditions are susceptible to
recurrent deteriorations in their respiratory health called ‘exacerbations’ which cause much of the
morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs [1-3]. Patients with COPD, for example, rate
exacerbations as the most disruptive aspect of their disease [4]. Most exacerbations are caused by
acquisition of airway infection, particularly with respiratory viruses including coronaviruses and
rhinoviruses [5-7].
During the COVID-19 pandemic, a range of measures to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 were
introduced including encouraging hand hygiene, social (physical) distancing, and the wearing of face
coverings. People living with chronic airway diseases were thought, and subsequently shown to be
at increased risk of poor outcomes with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 [8, 9]. Such
individuals, perceived to be particularly vulnerable, chose or were advised to take additional
precautions including ‘shielding’ (maximal reduction of face-to-face social contact [10]) during the
pandemic. Such recommendations varied within and between countries, and over time.
The pandemic was associated with a dramatic fall in cases of influenza [11] and multiple studies have
reported a substantial reduction in hospitalisations due to asthma and COPD exacerbations,
temporally associated with the COVID-19 pandemic including introduction of respiratory virus
infection control measures [12-20], likely because vulnerable people avoiding SARS-CoV-2 were also
avoiding other respiratory viruses that are common causes of exacerbations [21].
Current clinical guidelines in chronic airway diseases such as the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA
[1]), Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD [3]) and the European Respiratory
Society (ERS) guidelines on bronchiectasis [2] focus on exacerbation prevention but do not
specifically recommend respiratory virus infection control measures. This is despite a Cochrane
review first published in 2011 suggesting that such interventions can be effective [22].
The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that individuals both with and without long term health
conditions are prepared to accept measures to reduce the transmission of infection. This can be
driven both by a desire to protect the self, or to protect others, and will reflect national guidance or
legislation as well as personal beliefs about what is effective. Understanding the attitudes of people
living with respiratory disease is an important first step in developing policy and guidelines in this
area.

Methods
An online survey of people with respiratory disease was created by the Asthma UK – British Lung
Foundation (AUK-BLF) partnership, the largest UK respiratory disease charity, as part of ongoing
work to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and guide responses to it. The survey was
distributed and promoted via AUK-BLF social media and mailing lists and open for responses
between the 3rd and 10th of March 2021. Data collection was via Typeform. Data were collected on
demographics and self-reported respiratory diagnosis. As part of the survey, respondents were
asked their views about measures to reduce respiratory virus transmission. These questions were
deliberately framed to cover a future period after the COVID-19 pandemic was over, based on the
possibility that such measures could reduce the risk of exacerbations of lung disease. We used the
following wording: “There is some evidence that the measures to control spread of COVID-19 during

the pandemic have also reduced the spread of other viruses (such as colds and ‘flu) that can cause
asthma attacks / exacerbations of lung disease. Thinking about the future (after the lockdown has
been eased and most people have been vaccinated against COVID-19), which of the following…” (see
Table 1). The survey asked what people expected themselves to be doing to reduce exacerbation
risk one year from now, as well as what recommendations should be in force for the wider
population both “all the time” and “during the ‘flu season”.
Data were collated in Excel and analysed in SPSS (version 25). Proportions across groups were
compared with Chi Square analysis. p≤0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance. A two
thirds or more majority was arbitrarily and a priori chosen as indicating general support for a
measure, whilst a one third or fewer proportion was taken as indicating the absence of significant
support. A difference of more than ten percentage points between groups was arbitrarily and a
priori chosen to indicate a potentially meaningful difference.
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Imperial College Research Governance and
Integrity Team (RGIT) (ICREC Ref: 20IC6625). Survey respondents consented to use of their
responses for analysis and publication.

Results
The survey was completed by 4442 people living with airways diseases, including 3627 (81.7%)with
asthma, 258 (5.8%) with bronchiectasis and 557 (12.5%) with COPD. The commonest age categories
were 50-59 (1165 respondents) and 60-69 years (1200 respondents) with 1218 younger and 802
older participants. 3381 (76%) participants were female, 1013 (23%) were male, and six (0.02%)
responded ‘other’ or did not leave a response. 4260 (96%) self-reported their ethnic group as
‘white’.
Responses on the longer-term acceptability of respiratory virus infection control measures by people
living with chronic airways diseases, in relation to personal choice, policy and regulation, are
presented in Table 1. Given the high proportion of respondents with asthma, results are also
presented separately for asthma, bronchiectasis and COPD.
The main finding is that a substantial proportion of respondents expected that they would continue
to take some steps to reduce their future risk of exacerbation. 79.5% would continue increased
handwashing and 68.6% would continue social distancing indoors. 46.9% would continue to wear a
face mask in indoor public places (45.7% on public transport), as well as avoiding friends and family
who are unwell with a cold or ‘flu (59.3%). There was little support for wearing face coverings or
social distancing outdoors (11.6% and 38.0% respectively).
Regarding policy for people more generally, responses were similar between what the population
should be asked to do “at all times” compared to “during the ‘flu season”, except for wearing a face
covering indoors (44.9% vs 60.7%) and social distancing indoors (52.5% vs 62.9%). Around half of
this population with long term respiratory conditions would want healthcare professionals to
continue the current COVID-19 pandemic practice of wearing a mask when seeing patients.
Women were, in general, more likely to plan to continue measures to reduce viral transmission
compared to men, maintaining indoor social distancing (71.6% vs. 58.6%, p<0.001), avoiding busy
public spaces (62.6% vs. 51.6%, p<0.001) and avoiding friends and family who are unwell (63.5% vs.
45.1%, p<0.001).

Given the lower proportion of people with COPD and bronchiectasis, and the potential for them to
differ from people with asthma, we examined the effect of age on respiratory virus infection control
measures in people with asthma alone. The data are reported in Table 2. There were statistically
significant differences together with differences of more than 10% points between groups by age in
willingness to wear a face covering indoors and on public transport, social distancing in an indoor
public space, avoiding busy public spaces and avoiding friends and family who are unwell (Figure 1).
In general, older people (except the oldest old) were more cautious, with the exception of not
visiting friends and family who are unwell where younger people were more cautious.

asthma, by age (in years). n=3627.

Discussion
The results of this UK study of 4442 people living with asthma, bronchiectasis and COPD suggests
that many intend to continue to adopt respiratory virus infection control measures, first employed
during the COVID-19 pandemic, to reduce their future risk of exacerbations. There was also support
for the adoption of such measures in the general population during the ‘flu season. Given the
evidence base supporting the effectiveness of these measures to reduce exacerbations,
consideration should be given to including such measures in guidelines for airways diseases.
The basic premise of our survey was that widespread, continued implementation of pandemic
infection control measures was able to reduce the transmission of other viruses which in turn
reduced exacerbations of airways diseases in both community and hospital settings [12-20] (noting
that other circumstances of the pandemic such as cleaner air may also have contributed).
Importantly, the pattern of residual disease severity does not support the counter-hypothesis that
this reduction is due to patients avoiding healthcare during the pandemic. The reduction in
hospitalisation is of greater magnitude than ever previously achieved with optimisation of nonpharmacological and pharmacological care [1-3]. For example, Tan et al reported a 50% reduction in
hospitalised COPD [14] (and asthma [17]) exacerbations in Singapore, and a reduction in the
proportion of residual exacerbations associated with respiratory viruses. In a hospital in Hong Kong,
admissions for COPD exacerbations decreased by 44% during the first three months of 2020
compared with the previous year [13]. In a UK hospital, total COPD and asthma exacerbation
admissions in 2020 were 44% and 40% respectively of those in 2019 [16], without an increase in
severity. COPD exacerbation admissions at a German hospital fell by 42% during the pandemic, a
reduction greater than that seen in myocardial infarction or stroke [12]. We are not aware of any
data in relation to bronchiectasis. Although one small study in the UK suggested an increase in
community exacerbations [15], robust population data in asthma suggests a reduction in both
community [20] and hospital treated events [18] without an increase in asthma deaths, arguing

against people inappropriately avoiding hospital care. In the UK, there has also been a striking
reduction in community prescriptions for oral corticosteroids [23]. Thus, whilst affecting care
delivery and health, including the mental health [24, 25], of people living with chronic airways
diseases, the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing restrictions have demonstrated the potential for
dramatically reducing the future burden of exacerbations of airways diseases.
Exacerbations of airways diseases cause a major burden to patients and health services [26] and
preventing exacerbations is a cornerstone of respiratory care. Currently, ‘infection control’
measures against micro-organisms associated with exacerbations are not part of routine guidelines
including those for asthma (GINA [1]), bronchiectasis (ERS [2]) and COPD (GOLD [3]). This is despite
guidelines highlighting the importance of patient education and training in “essential skills” such as
inhaler technique and self-management. Primary prevention of exacerbations focuses on
optimisation of medical treatment and smoking cessation. Interventions to reduce the acquisition of
respiratory viruses are a notable omission. A Cochrane review of physical interventions to reduce
the spread of respiratory viruses concluded that simple interventions had the potential to reduce
transmission of respiratory viruses while acknowledging that routine, long-term use would be
challenging outside the context of an epidemic [22]. However, the profound reduction in
exacerbations that has been seen during the pandemic period and the attitudes elicited by our
survey suggests that guideline recommendations around respiratory virus infection control
measures for people living with chronic respiratory diseases should be revisited.
The questions we asked people living with airways diseases were framed around the potential
benefit of continuing respiratory virus infection control measures in the light of evidence that they
may be effective at preventing exacerbations. We have shown that there is wide support for
continuing measures such as general hand hygiene and the continuing provision of hand sanitiser in
public spaces. Whilst over half the respondents thought there should be a recommendation for
everyone to wear a mask in indoor public spaces (especially during the (northern hemisphere)
Winter), fewer (47%) would personally continue to do this in the absence of such a
recommendation. There was more support for continuing ‘social’ (physical) distancing, avoidance of
busy public spaces, and restricting visits with friends and family who are unwell. We observed some
differences between the major airways diseases (participants with bronchiectasis were the most
supportive of continuing infection control measures), between male versus female respondents, and
by age. In general, older people (except the oldest old) and women were more willing to adopt a
more cautious approach and were more likely to choose to continue with preventative measures
even where these were not mandated. The exception to this was willingness to visit family and
friends who are unwell, where younger people were most cautious.
More frequent hand washing would be the simplest measure to encourage as it is already part of
widely accepted social behaviour, meaning there would be little behaviour change involved. A
randomised control trial in primary care in the UK has demonstrated that a web-based hand-washing
intervention maximised handwashing behaviours and improved infection rates over three Winters
[27]. If it is measures other than hand hygiene that are the most effective at reducing transmission,
further work will be required to support people living with airways diseases in making additional
behaviour changes. Factors determining compliance with advice in the general population have
recently been described and were most closely related to confidence in the source of advice [28].
Pulmonary Rehabilitation could provide a forum in which to disseminate such messages to people
living with airways diseases. Other interventions could include reducing presenteesism, where
people go to work when unwell and are a risk to others, especially as attitudes to and possibilities
for working from home have developed. The pandemic has demonstrated that social and

employment measures to ensure that people can afford not to go to work are a key element in
protecting the vulnerable in society more widely. Normalising social distancing would require wider
public health messaging and there is thus a distinction between measures aimed at the general
population versus those targeted to people living with airways diseases. A substantial proportion of
respondents thought that measures to reduce infection should apply to the general population as
well as to themselves, especially during the ‘flu season. This should at least prompt public discussion
about behaviours in enclosed public spaces where transmission risk is highest. Face coverings are
probably most effective at reducing transmission of infection rather than protecting the wearer, so
the protection for an individual wearing one may be limited. Interestingly around 60% of
respondents expressed the view that face coverings should be required for all in indoor spaces and
on public transport during the ‘flu season. Acceptability of interventions is dependent on many
factors including cultural norms, such that it has already been commonplace in people from South
East Asia to wear face coverings. In other jurisdictions the use of face coverings has become
politicised which may further affect implementation, and some people with respiratory disease have
been exempt from wearing face coverings because of a perceived effect on breathlessness which
could also limit future adoption. The potential benefits of measures must be balanced against
potential harms including costs and psychological harms such as stigma and drawing attention to
disease status [24]. Acceptability of measures may change with time, particularly with changes in
the impact of COVID-19 risk such as vaccination.
There are strengths and limitations to our work. Our survey was conducted online, so required a
degree of digital literacy. The sample was large but a convenience sample and the extent to which
respondents were representative of people with airways disease more broadly is unclear. The face
validity of the responses is supported by the rational pattern of responses, with substantially greater
support for measures that are likely to be effective such as greater support for the use of face
coverings indoors compared to outdoors. Although the questions were framed to address the
period “after COVID”, attitudes may change over time. However, even if only a small proportion of
patients adhere to infection control measures, the simplicity and cost-effectiveness could justify
highlighting their importance in guidelines and promoting implementation as part of exacerbation
reduction strategies. Including such measures in guidelines may also prompt clinicians to encourage
patients to adopt such interventions, thereby also increasing uptake. Furthermore, these nonpharmacological measures may appeal to people reluctant to comply with pharmacotherapy.
Further work is required to optimise the behaviour-change interventions that would be necessary to
maximise the benefit of continued respiratory virus infection control measures.
The impact of pandemic respiratory virus infection control measures indicate that local, national and
international guideline committees in asthma, bronchiectasis and COPD should consider including
advice on such interventions to reduce the burden of exacerbations. This is particularly important in
the absence of a vaccine or drugs to combat rhinovirus – the commonest cause of acute
exacerbations [5]. Our findings suggest that there is likely to be a significant level of acceptance by
people with these conditions and infection control measures are affordable, not pathogen specific
and mostly well tolerated [22]. Whilst no single measure had universal support, there was
substantial support for a number of interventions enabling people living with chronic airways
diseases to make informed choices about their own risk of exacerbation and how they choose to
mitigate that risk. Recommendations to encourage the general public to take steps to protect
vulnerable fellow citizens should also be supported by healthcare professionals.
