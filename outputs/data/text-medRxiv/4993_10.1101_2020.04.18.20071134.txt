Cluster of COVID-19 in northern France: A retrospective closed cohort study
Summary
Background: The Oise department in France has been heavily affected by COVID-19 in early 2020.
Methods: Between 30 March and 4 April 2020, we conducted a retrospective closed cohort study among
pupils, their parents and siblings, as well as teachers and non-teaching staff of a high-school located in
Oise. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered history of fever and/or respiratory symptoms
since 13 January 2020 and had blood tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The
infection attack rate (IAR) was defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection based on antibody detection. Blood samples from two blood donor centres collected between
23 and 27 March 2020 in the Oise department were also tested for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibodies.
Findings: Of the 661 participants (median age: 37 years), 171 participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibodies. The overall IAR was 25.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 22.6-29.4), and the infection
fatality rate was 0% (one-sided 97.5% CI = 0 - 2.1). Nine of the ten participants hospitalised since midJanuary were in the infected group, giving a hospitalisation rate of 5.3% (95% CI = 2.4 –9.8). Anosmia
and ageusia had high positive predictive values for SARS-CoV-2 infection (84.7% and 88.1%,
respectively). Smokers had a lower IAR compared to non-smokers (7.2% versus 28.0%, P <0.001). The
proportion of infected individuals who had no symptoms during the study period was 17.0% (95% CI =
11.2 – 23.4). The proportion of donors with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in two nearby blood banks
of the Oise department was 3.0% (95% CI = 1.1 - 6.4).
Interpretation: The relatively low IAR observed in an area where SARS-CoV-2 actively circulated
weeks before confinement measures indicates that establishing herd immunity will take time, and that
lifting these measures in France will be long and complex.

Research in context
Evidence before the study
The first COVID-19 cases in France were reported on 24 January 2020. Substantial transmission has
occurred since then, with the Oise department, north of Paris, one of the heaviest affected areas in the
early stages of the epidemic in France. As of 13 April 2020, 98,076 cases had been diagnosed in France,
including 5,379 deaths.
Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been widely reported, but
this has largely been centred on cases requiring medical care. What remains unclear at this stage is the
extent to which SARS-CoV-2 infections may be asymptomatic or present as subclinical, non-specific
symptoms. While extensive contact tracing has identified asymptomatic infections using RT-PCR
testing, serologic detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is needed to determine the real infection
attack rate and the proportion of all infections that are asymptomatic or subclinical.
Added value of this study
Using a combination of serologic assays with high sensitivity and specificity for anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibodies, we conducted a retrospective closed cohort study. In a high school linked to a cluster of
COVID-19 in the Oise department, we showed an overall infection attack rate (IAR) of 40.9% in the
high school group, and 10.9% in parents and siblings of the pupils. The proportion of infected
individuals who had no symptoms during the study period was 17.0%.
Implications of all of the available evidence
The relatively low IAR in this area where SARS-CoV-2 actively circulated before confinement
measures were introduced indicates that establishing herd immunity will take time, and that the lifting
of these measures in France will be long and complex.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus that was first
reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) as a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown
etiology in Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019. It is now known to cause coronavirus disease (COVID19), which primarily affects the upper and lower respiratory tract. On 30 January 2020, WHO declared
the COVID-19 outbreak to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.1 Since then,
the outbreak has continued to spread around the world and was described by WHO as a pandemic on 11
March 2020.
The first three COVID-19 cases identified in France were reported on 24 January 2020 in travellers
returning from Wuhan, China.2 On 24 February, a patient from the Oise department, north of Paris, was
admitted to hospital in Paris in a critical condition and diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. He died
on 25 February and was the first reported COVID-19 case in France without a direct or indirect
epidemiological link to China. The ensuing epidemiological investigation led to the identification of a
cluster of COVID-19 that involved a high school in the Oise department.
With any emerging infectious disease, including COVID-19, initial surveillance focuses primarily on
severe infections, leading to overestimates of the case fatality rate (CFR). Likewise, in the absence of
knowledge of subclinical or asymptomatic forms of the infection, it is not possible to estimate infection
fatality rates (IFR) except through mathematical modelling.3 However, population-based serological
investigations use serologic assays to determine infection attack rates (IAR) in the population in an
epidemic area, and are able to determine the proportion of subclinical and asymptomatic infections. This
information is key for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 circulation, more precise estimates of
fatality rates, and calibration of mathematical models used to forecast the dynamics of the ongoing
epidemic.
To date, access to validated serologic assays for SARS-CoV-2 is limited.4,5 However, a series of
serologic assays recently developed by the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France have shown high sensitivity
and specificity for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.6
Here, we describe a retrospective closed cohort study aiming at estimating the IAR and its determinants
in an area affected by COVID-19, using these serologic assays.

Methods
Initial case and contact investigation
Following the confirmation of COVID-19 in the patient from the Oise department, case investigation
and contact tracing identified two cases in a high school and who had symptoms consistent with COVID19 on 2 February 2020, suggesting circulation of the virus in the Oise department since the end of
January 2020.
Study design
As a follow-up to the initial case investigation and contact tracing, a retrospective closed cohort study
was conducted in the high school. Between 30 March and 4 April, all pupils, as well as teachers and
non-teaching staff (administrative, cleaners, catering) from the high school were invited to participate
in the investigation. Since most pupils were minor, at least one parent was invited to participate in the
study, to provide informed consent for their child and for any of the other children over the age of 5
years in the household enrolled in the study.
Following informed consent, participants completed a questionnaire which covered sociodemographic
information, underlying medical conditions, history of symptoms since 13 January 2020, and history of
COVID-19 diagnosis prior to this investigation. A 5 mL blood sample was taken from all participants,
irrespective of whether they had reported fever or respiratory symptoms since 13 January 2020.
Seroprevalence investigation in nearby blood donation centres
Between 23 and 27 March, 200 serum samples were collected from two blood donation centres, located
50 and 60 km from the place of the seroepidemiological investigation.
Laboratory analyses
All serum samples were tested for antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 using several assays developed
by Institut Pasteur : an ELISA N assay, detecting antibodies binding to the N protein; a S-Flow assay,
which is a flow-cytometry based assay detecting anti-S IgG; and a LIPS assay, which is an
immunoprecipitation-based assay detecting anti-N and anti-S1 IgG. Participants were considered
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 if any test was positive, since all tests had a specificity higher than 99%
with the cut-offs chosen for positivity.6
Case definitions
Any participant with a positive serology at the time of blood sampling was considered as a confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Each infection was categorised as symptomatic if any symptoms were reported
by the participant since 13 January 2020, or, alternatively, as asymptomatic. Symptoms were considered
only if they occurred at least 7 days prior to the date of blood sample collection to allow time for

seroconversion.4,7 Symptoms were further categorized as major (fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, anosmia
and ageusia) or minor (sore throat, rhinitis, muscle pain, diarrhoea, headache, asthenia).
Statistical analyses
The infection attack rate (IAR) was defined as the proportion of all participants with confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection based on antibody detection. It was compared by age, sex, occupation, smoking,
comorbid conditions and recent symptoms using chi-squared test. Logistic regression was used to adjust
for age or occupation when analysing the association between smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results
Retrospective closed cohort study
From 30 March to 4 April 2020, 878 of 1262 high school pupils, teachers, and non-teaching staff were
invited by e-mail to participate in the investigation (email addresses were not available for 384). Of
these, 326 (37%) responded and accepted to participate in the study. An additional 345 parents and
siblings of high school pupils were also invited to participate in the study. This formed a study
population of 661 participants (see Figure 1). Table 1 indicates the characteristics of the 661 participants.
Pupils and their parents constituted the majority of the study population (36.3% and 31.9%,
respectively). The median age was 37 years (IQR: 16-47) and 251 (38.0%) were male.
Overall, 452 (68.4%) participants reported respiratory symptoms between 13 January and up to one
week before blood sampling. Major symptoms had been experienced by 321(48.6%) of study
participants, minor symptoms by 131 (19.8%), while 209 (31.6%) had not noticed any symptom during
the period covered by the study. Most common symptoms were rhinitis (38.3%), followed by cough
(35.4%), headache (30.9%), asthenia (29.6%), sore throat (26.8%), and fever (26.2%). Ten participants
reported hospital admission in relation to the reported symptoms. Further investigation established no
fatalities among the 1262 members of the high school population since the beginning of the study period.
Of the 661 participants, 171 participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (see Supplementary
material), giving an overall IAR of 25.9% (95% confidence interval (CI); 22.6-29.4), and an infection
fatality rate (IFR) of 0% (one-sided 97.5% CI = 0 - 2.1). Nine of the ten hospitalised were in the SARSCoV-2 infected group, giving a hospitalisation rate of 5.3% (95% CI = 2.4 –9.8). The median age of
hospitalised participants was higher compared to non-hospitalised in the SARS-CoV-2 infected group
(49.0 versus 17.7 years, respectively; P = 0.04). Among the 171 participants with confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection, the proportions of those with major, minor or no symptoms were 70.8% (95% CI =
63.3-77.5), 12.3% (95% CI = 7.8-18.2), and 17.0% (95% CI = 11.2 – 23.4), respectively.
Table 2 shows the proportion of those with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. There was no difference in
IAR between males and females, while IAR was highest (40.0%) in the 15-17 years age group. The IAR
was higher in the high school group (38.3% 43.4%, and 59.3% for pupils, teachers, and school staff,
respectively) than in parents and siblings (11.4% and 10.2%, respectively) (P <0.001). Smoking was
found to be associated with a lower risk of infection (7.2% versus 28.0% for smokers and non-smokers,
respectively; P<0.001; OR = 0.20, 95%CI = 0.08-0.51), and this association remained significant after
adjustment for age (OR = 0.23; 95% CI = 0.09 – 0.59) or occupation (OR = 0.27; 95% CI = 0.10 – 0.71).
There was no increase in IAR among those who had comorbidities, otherwise known to be associated
with severe forms of COVID-19.

Participants who had experienced major symptoms were more likely to be infected, compared to those
who had had minor or no symptoms (37.8%, 26.0%, and 13.9%, respectively, P <0.001). Of all
symptoms considered, two had high positive predictive value for SARS-CoV-2 infection: anosmia
(50/59 = 84.7%) and ageusia (52/59 = 88.1%). For all those who had anosmia and ageusia and negative
serological findings, the time between reported symptoms and blood sampling was longer than one
month, so the negative serological finding is unlikely to reflect delayed seroconversion.
Figure 2 displays the epidemic curve by week of onset of symptoms, serological status, and presence of
major or minor symptoms. Among those with confirmed infection, the number of new cases dropped
dramatically after week 7, corresponding to the beginning of the school holidays, and again after local
confinement measures were introduced in the Oise department. As can be seen on Figure 2B, the
symptoms among those who were not infected suggest that other respiratory viruses were circulating in
that community during the study period.
Seroprevalence investigation among blood donors
Of the 200 serum samples that were collected from two blood donation centres between 23 and 27
March, 6 (3.0%, 95%CI = 1.1.- 6.4) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Discussion
This is, to our knowledge, the first study estimating by antibody detection the IAR of SARS-CoV-2
infection in a community affected by COVID-19, and the fist description of a COVID-19 outbreak in a
school. In this cluster, we estimated that the IAR was 25.9%, approximately 8 weeks after the most
likely introduction of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in this community. The epidemic presumably started
during the third week of January, continued until school closure for holidays on February 15, and
declined further following the introduction of confinement measures on March 1, with few confirmed
cases on week 13.
The IAR was highest among the high school staff, teachers and pupils, and much lower among the
parents and siblings of pupils. The secondary IAR in households was similar among parents (11.4%)
and siblings (10.2%), and was close to the 15% observed in a study from Shenzen, China.8 In the context
of the ongoing debates around the contribution of children and schools to viral transmission, these
findings are of interest, and the impact of the school closure on the epidemic dynamic is particularly
striking, with the limitation that these findings are restricted to high school setting only. High school
pupils and their teachers had comparable IAR, similar to what was observed in Iceland when comparing
the viral detection proportion between the 10-19 years old and adults in the targeted testing group.9
In the infected study population, the overall hospitalisation rate was 5.3%, and no death was observed.
These relatively low figures need to be considered against the young age of a large part of the study
population (40% were between 15 and 17 years of age; median age was 37 years; only two were older
than 65 years). The current understanding of COVID-19 severity is that clinical presentation,
hospitalisation rate and the CFR are lower among younger age groups.3,10,11
The IAR was higher among those with major symptoms, compared to those with minor or no symptoms.
As documented before, anosmia and ageusia had high predictive values for COVID-19.12,13 While 17%
of the infected had no symptoms during the study period, the true proportion of asymptomatic SARSCoV-2 infections is likely higher since symptoms among those infected may also be attributable to the
other respiratory viruses that were circulating in the community during that time period.
Smokers had a lower IAR compared to non-smokers. The association remained after adjustment for age
or occupation. Earlier studies in China and the U.S. have documented a low proportion of smokers
among COVID-19 patients (6% of 191 hospitalised patients in Wuhan14, and 1% of 7162 patients in the
U.S.15). The protection associated with smoking in our study was very substantial (75% decrease in risk
of infection), and deserves full attention. One possible explanation would be the downregulation of
ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor16, by nicotine17. Such findings need replication, a solid understanding
of the physiopathological process underlying it, and careful consideration in light of the increased risk

of severe form of COVID-19 among smokers once infected18, and the long-term harmful consequences
of smoking.
The main limitation of the study is the relatively low participation rate among all those invited. It is
difficult to speculate whether this has led to an overestimation (if those who felt well during the study
period did not come) or an underestimation (if those who had PCR-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis
during the study period did not come) of the IAR. Nevertheless, the overall findings were consistent
with the literature to date in terms of the overall age-standardised CFR, hospitalisation rate, predictive
values of symptoms such as ageusia and anosmia, and the possible effect of school closure on respiratory
viruses epidemic dynamics.3,9,10 The clinical findings of our investigation were also limited by the fact
that symptoms were retrospectively self-reported, in the absence of clinical evaluation, and that other
respiratory viruses were presumably circulating at that time in the study population.
The choice of serological test has been a challenge in the absence of validated assays. We selected three
serological methods with high (>99%) specificity, so that a positive signal with any of the three tests
would be considered as a true positive.6 This, combined with the very high sensitivity of one of the three
methods, the S-Flow assay, suggests that we were able to capture most if not all individuals with
antibodies. A further concern relates to the antibody kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most patients
seroconvert within two weeks after onset of symptoms, but it is not clear whether time to seroconversion
may be longer in patients with asymptomatic or subclinical infection.5 In such case, our estimate of the
IAR might be an underestimate of the true one. Still, with a lockdown in place more than four weeks
before the blood sampling, we believe that time to seroconversion has been sufficient for the majority
of infected individuals. One important knowledge gap remains the extent to which the antibodies
detected in this study would be immunoprotective. In the absence of this knowledge, we suggest that
barrier measures and social distancing continue to apply the same way for people with and without
antibodies.
We also found 3% of blood donors residing in the surrounding area to have evidence of anti-SARSCoV-2 antibodies. While this proportion may seem low, despite circulation of the virus in the region,
this fraction is likely to be lower than the true seroprevalence among adults in the region for a number
of reasons. Blood donors tend to be more “health conscious”; they are not allowed to give blood if they
have been ill in the month before; and tend to refrain from donating blood if a family member was
recently ill. Nonetheless, tracking seropositivity in blood donors over time gives an indication of the
trend in antibody dynamics in the general population, and for this reason, has been used effectively in
previous epidemics, including pandemic H1N1 influenza19 and Zika virus.20 Repeated serologic testing
for anti-SARS-COV-2 antibodies in blood donor populations needs to continue, in both affected and
unaffected areas.

Overall, the findings of this study have important implications for public health measures and outbreak
investigations specific to COVID-19. The overall IAR of 25.9% in a community living within the
epicentre of the epidemic in France, and the low prevalence of antibodies among blood donors in the
vicinity suggest that herd immunity will not be established quickly. Other areas of France, where the
virus has not circulated, remain immunologically naive to the virus. Since 17 March 2020, the French
government has implemented public health measures to restrict movement of individuals outside their
home. The findings of this study suggest that lifting these confinement measures may be long and
complex. For this reason, effective therapeutics treatments and vaccines specific to SARS-CoV-2 are
urgently needed.
