The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is heterogeneous and our understanding of the
biological mechanisms of host response to the novel viral infection remains limited. Identification
of meaningful clinical subphenotypes may benefit pathophysiological study, clinical practice, and
clinical trials. Here, our aim was to derive and validate COVID-19 subphenotypes using machine
learning and routinely collected clinical data, assess temporal patterns of these subphenotypes
during the pandemic course, and examine their interaction with social determinants of health
(SDoH). We retrospectively analyzed 14418 COVID-19 patients in five major medical centers in
New York City (NYC), between March 1 and June 12, 2020. Using clustering analysis, four
biologically distinct subphenotypes were derived in the development cohort (N = 8199).
Importantly, the identified subphenotypes were highly predictive of clinical outcomes (especially
60-day mortality). Sensitivity analyses in the development cohort, and re-derivation and
prediction in the internal (N = 3519) and external (N = 3519) validation cohorts confirmed the
reproducibility and usability of the subphenotypes. Further analyses showed varying
subphenotype prevalence across the peak of the outbreak in NYC. We also found that SDoH
specifically influenced mortality outcome in Subphenotype IV, which is associated with older age,
worse clinical manifestation, and high comorbidity burden. Our findings may lead to a better
understanding of how COVID-19 causes disease in different populations and potentially benefit
clinical trial development. The temporal patterns and SDoH implications of the subphenotypes
may add new insights to health policy to reduce social disparity in the pandemic.

Introduction

42

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory

43

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has led to a pandemic that imposed

44

tremendous pressure on healthcare systems globally1. As the pandemic continues and the

45

second wave has emerged in the US and many other countries, research is still needed to

46

understand how SARS-CoV-2 causes the wide spectrum of COVID-19 disease. Previous

47

studies have uncovered substantial variation in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 and the

48

variable clinical manifestations of this disease, including respiratory failure, kidney injury, and

49

cardiovascular dysfunction2-8. Pivotal studies of corticosteroids9 and anticoagulation10,11

50

demonstrate differential responses in distinct subpopulations based on severity of disease. The

51

pathophysiology of differential organ dysfunction in COVID-19 remains unclear across varied

52

patient populations. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, identification of biologically distinct, data

53

driven subphenotypes12,13 has helped to disentangle complex syndromic disease such as

54

sepsis14,15 , ARDS16, heart failure17,18, diabetes19, and Alzheimer’s disease20.

55
56

Identifying robust subphenotypes in COVID-19 patients could lead to improved understanding of

57

biological mechanisms of host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may identify

58

subpopulations that could be prioritized for clinical trial enrollment13,21. Previous efforts22-25 have

59

been made in this area but remain limited probably due to cohort size, data availability, and

60

lacking evaluation of robustness and usability of the identified subphenotypes. In addition, the

61

hospitalized case fatality rate of COVID-19 has varied over the course of the pandemic26,27 and

62

according to social determinants of health (SDoH)28-30. Exploration of temporal patterns and

63

SDoH characteristics in conjunction with subphenotypes may derive new insights to improve

64

public health.

65
66

In this analysis, our goal was to derive and validate COVID-19 subphenotypes amongst a

67

population of patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) or were hospitalized in

68

multiple health systems in New York City (NYC). Specifically, we used routinely collected clinical

69

data to first derive subphenotypes using the agglomerative hierarchical clustering model. Then,

70

multiple strategies in data pre-processing, data filtering, and data-driven models (both

71

unsupervised clustering model and supervised predictive model) were used to confirm

72

reproducibility and usability of the identified subphenotypes. After that, statistical analyses were

73

conducted to evaluate the characteristics and clinical outcomes of the subphenotypes. Further

74

analyses were performed to examine temporal patterns of the subphenotypes and impacts of

75

SDoH status on subphenotype-level outcomes. The overall workflow of our study is illustrated in

76

Figure 1.

Patients

81

A total of 14418 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 1st and June 12th 2020,

82

treated in ED (N=2354, 16.3%) or inpatient (N=12064, 83.7%) settings, were included for

83

analysis from the five major medical centers in New York City (NYC), including New York

and New York Presbyterian - Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC). Details of

87

inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in eFigure 1 in Supplement. We identified 2853

88

(19.8%) deaths within 60-day after COVID-19 confirmation in total, including 2801 (19.4%) in-

89

hospital deaths and 52 (4%) deaths after discharge from COVID related hospitalization or ED

90

visits. Considering population diversity (especially race) of the five medical centers (see eTable

91

1 in Supplement), we combined four centers and randomly divided them into the development

92

cohort (70%) and internal validation cohort (30%); patients of the remaining center were used as

93

the external validation cohort (see Figure 1 and eFigure. 1 in Supplement).

94
95

The development cohort contained a total of 8199 patients with a median age of 65.35

96

(interquartile range [IQR] [50.57, 75.17]) years old, consisting of 3787 (46.2%) females, 2036

97

(24.8%) white patients, and 2155 (26.3%) black patients.

98

contained a total of 3519 patients with similar patient characteristics when compared with the

99

development cohort, with a median age of 63.51 (IQR [50.95, 75,17]) years old, consisting of

100

1585 (45.0%) females, 838 (23.8%) white patients, and 915 (26%) black patients. The external

101

validation cohort contained a total of 2700 patients. It had a median age of 65.85 (IQR [51.08,

102

77.38]) years old and consisted of 1305 (48.3%) females, 675 (25.0%) white patients, and 545

103

(20.2%) black patients. Across the three cohorts, the overall 60-day mortality rates after ED or

104

hospital discharge were 18.65%, 19.78%, and 20.59%, respectively. More details of the

105

characteristics of the studied cohorts appeared in Table 1.

106

Subphenotypes derivation

107

In the development cohort, the agglomerative hierarchical clustering model identified 4 distinct

108

subphenotypes based on presenting clinical data of the patients (see eResults, eFigures 3 and

109

4 in Supplement). Characteristics including demographics, clinical variables, comorbidities,

110

clinical outcomes, and medication treatments across the 4 subphenotypes were presented in

111

Table 2 and Figures 2 and 3.

112
113

Subphenotype I consisted of 2707 (33.02%) patients. Compared to the others, it included more

114

younger (median age 57.45 years, IQR [42.70, 70.02]) and female (N = 1601 [59.15%]) patients.

115

Those patients had more normal values across all clinical variables and lower chronic

116

comorbidity burden. The patients also had better clinical outcomes including a low 60-day

117

mortality (N = 188 [6.94%]) and a low rates of mechanical ventilation (N = 190 [7.02%]) and ICU

118

admission (N = 242 [8.94%]).

119
120

Subphenotype II consisted of 3047 (37.16%) patients. Compared to other subphenotypes, it

121

included more male patients (N = 1941 [63.70%]) and was likely to have more abnormal

122

inflammatory markers (such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, interleukin 6,

123

lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, white blood cell count, and ferritin)

124

and markers of hepatic dysfunctions (such as ferritin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate

125

aminotransferase, and bilirubin). Overall comorbidity burden of Subphenotype II was low.

126

Clinical outcomes including 60-day mortality (N = 528 [17.33%]), mechanical ventilation (N =

127

527 [17.30%]), and ICU admission (N = 675 [22.15%]) of Subphenotype II were at a moderate

128

level.

129
130

Subphenotype III included 1486 (18.12%) patients, consisting of more older (median age 69.45

131

years, IQR [57.05, 79.62]) and black (N = 503 [33.85%]) patients, compared to subphenotypes I

132

and II. Those patients of Subphenotype III were likely to have more abnormal renal dysfunction

133

markers (such as blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, chloride, and sodium) and hematologic

134

dysfunction markers (such as d-dimer, hemoglobin, and red blood cell distribution width).

135

Overall comorbidity burden of Subphenotype III was high. Clinical outcomes including 60-day

136

mortality (N = 337 [22.68%]), intubation (N = 195 [13.12%]), and ICU admission (N =242

137

[16.29%]) of Subphenotype II were close to that of Subphenotype II and at a moderate level as

138

well.

139
140

Subphenotype IV included 959 (11.70%) patients. Compared to other subphenotypes, it

141

included more older (median age 75.53 years, IQR [64.10, 84.83]) and male (N = 588 [61.31%])

142

patients. Those patients of Subphenotype IV had more abnormal values across all clinical

143

variables and higher chronic comorbidity burden than the others. Obesity burden is lower in

144

Subphenotype IV than others. In line with its biological characteristics, Subphenotype IV had the

145

worst clinical outcomes in 60-day mortality (N = 476 [49.64%]), intubation (N = 242 [25.23%]),

146

and ICU admission (N =335 [34.93%]). In addition, the medications including antibiotics,

147

corticosteroids, and vasopressor were more frequently used in Subphenotype IV.

148

149

Subphenotype reproducibility and prediction

150

In the development cohort, sensitivity analyses under two different settings (sensitivity

151

to quality control and outliers and sensitivity to clustering methods) confirmed the

152

underlying 4-cluster structure of the data (see eResults, eFigures 3 and 4, and eTable 5 in

153

Supplement). Patients’ memberships of the 4 clusters re-derived by sensitivity analyses

154

were highly consistent with those derived in the primary analysis (see eFigure 6 in

155

Supplement). Moreover, we did not find substantial changes in clinical characteristics of

156

the subphenotypes in the sensitivity analyses (see eTables 6 and 7 in Supplement).

157
158

Subphenotypes were also re-derived in the internal validation cohort, where the 4-

159

cluster structure was found as the optimal fit as well (see eResults and eFigure7 in

160

Supplement). Clinical characteristics of the re-derived subphenotypes in the internal

161

validation cohort, including demographics, laboratory variables, comorbidities, and

162

clinical outcomes, also showed very similar patterns with the subphenotypes derived in

163

the primary analysis (see Figure 3, and eTable 8 and eFigure 8 in Supplement).

164
165

To further evaluate subphenotype robustness and usability, we trained a predictive

166

model of subphenotypes in the development cohort and used it to predict subphenotype

167

membership in the external validation cohort. Clinical variables of presenting laboratory

168

tests for clustering analysis were used as candidate predictors. The trained predictive

169

model (XGBoost classifier) achieved very high performance in predicting each

170

subphenotype (see eFigure 9 in Supplement). SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values

171

illustrated contributions of the clinical variables in distinguishing each subphenotype from others

172

(see eFigure 10 in Supplement). Patterns of the produced SHAP values were highly in line with

173

the subphenotype characteristics:

174

Subphenotype I; 2) abnormal inflammatory and hepatic markers were predictive of

175

Subphenotype II; 3) abnormal renal and hematologic markers indicated were likely to indicate

176

Subphenotype III; 4) Subphenotype IV was associated with abnormal values of most variables.

177

After that, the trained predictive model was used to predict subphenotype memberships of

178

patients in the external validation cohort. The predicted subphenotypes in the external validation

179

cohort were well separated in the UMAP space (see eFigure 11 in Supplement) and showed

180

clinical characteristics similar to findings in the primary analysis (see Figure 3, and eTable 9 and

181

eFigure 12 in Supplement).

183

Last, results from leave-one-center-out analysis also confirmed the four-cluster structure

184

underlying our data (see eFigure 13 in Supplement). Meanwhile, subphenotypes identified by

185

the leave-one-center-out analysis among the whole population showed characteristics in line

186

with those identified in the primary analysis (see eTable 10 in Supplement). Those above

187

demonstrated stability of the identified subphenotypes across the five centers.

188

Temporal characteristics of subphenotypes

189

Temporal patterns of the COVID-19 subphenotypes were illustrated by the bar charts, showing

190

the composition of subphenotype memberships of patients confirmed per week, since the

191

outbreak in NYC, i.e., March 1, 2020 (see Figures 4a-c). Except week 1 and week 14 that had

192

few patients confirmed, the composition of the four subphenotypes per week evolved over time

193

and showed similar patterns across the development, internal validation, and external validation

194

cohorts. In general, patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection rapidly increased within the

195

first month since the outbreak and reached the peak at week 5 (early April). Subphenotype I

196

(mild symptom) and Subphenotype II (moderate symptom, low comorbidity burden) dominated

197

the time period prior to the peak (first 4 weeks since outbreak). In contrast, Subphenotype IV

198

(severe symptom, high comorbidity burden) had a low proportion within the first 4 weeks but

199

showed a largely increased proportion from week 6 to week 9. Since week 10, the proportion of

200

Subphenotype I gradually increased while others especially Subphenotype IV shrank.

201

Subphenotype III (moderate symptom, high comorbidity burden) had a relatively stable

202

proportion over time.

203

Impact of SDoH on subphenotypes

204

In general, worse SDoH in terms the socioeconomic variables were likely in Subphenotype IV

205

(see eTable 11 in Supplement). Moreover, logistic regression analysis identified similar patterns

8

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.28.21252645; this version posted May 19, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

206

of relationships between the SDoH variables with 60-day mortality risk across subphenotypes;

207

however, absolute log odds and Hazard ratio of the SDoH variables varied across

208

subphenotypes (see Figure 4d and eTables 12-13 in Supplement). For example, low absolute

209

log odds were observed in all six SDoH variables in Subphenotype I. In contrast, we did see

210

increased absolute log odds of all six SDoH variables in Subphenotype IV. Hazard ratio showed

211

similar pattern.

212
213

Agglomerative hierarchical clustering based on the SDoH variables grouped the patients into a

214

3-cluster model (see eResults and eFigure 14 in Supplement), which can be interpreted as high

215

(H), middle (M), and low (L) SDoH strata (see eTable 14 in Supplement). Stratum L,

216

representing disadvantaged SDoH status, accounted for a slightly higher mortality rate (H vs. M

217

vs. L, 17.59% vs. 19.91% vs.19.98%, P-value = 0.08). In addition, stratum L had a lower ICU

218

admission rate (16.16%, P-value < 0.001). The relative high mortality but low ICU admission

219

rate may be caused by critical care strain during periods of increased COVID-19 ICU demand,

220

as suggested by a recent study31. Distributions of the SDoH strata by biological subphenotypes

221

were shown in eTable 15 in Supplement. In the analysis to further explore how SDoH strata

222

affected the outcome of each biological subphenotype, we found varied patterns of correlations

223

between SDoH strata and 60-day mortality (see Figure 4e) by subphenotypes. Notably, in line

224

with the results of the univariate analysis above, SDoH strata were likely to have a strong

225

impact on the 60-day mortality in Subphenotype IV. Particularly, in Subphenotype IV, SDoH

226

stratum L was associated with a 55.19% 60-mortality rate, which was 5.55% higher than the

227

subphenotype level (49.64%, see Table 2) and 8.52% higher than that of the SDoH stratum H.

228

In subphenotypes I, II, and III, we didn’t find mortality rate discrepancy higher than 3% between

229

any pair of SDoH strata. Similarly, considering stratum H as reference, stratum L had largely

230

increased log odds of mortality in Subphenotype IV (log odds = 0.40, SD = 0.19, P-value = 0.04).

231

(see eTable 16 in Supplement)

232

233

Discussions

234

We derived subphenotypes of COVID-19 patients treated at five major medical centers in NYC

235

across the whole course of the first wave of the pandemic, using the clinical data at the

236

presentation to the emergency department (ED) or hospital. Different from the previous

237

subphenotype studies of COVID-1922-24, we focused on a larger, more representative, and

238

diverse population presented at the ED and/or hospitalized without COVID-19 specific therapy.

239

We derived subphenotypes using clustering analysis in the development cohort and validated

240

them using a combination of multiple validation strategies, including the use of different data

241

processing, different data filtering, and different machine learning models (both unsupervised

242

clustering and supervised predictive models). All validation approaches confirmed the

243

reproducibility of the 4-cluster structure of the data and clinical characteristics of the identified

244

subphenotypes. We would also highlight that all machine learning models used for

245

subphenotype derivation and validation were performed only on the presenting clinical variables

246

that were routinely collected in daily patient care and are available to providers by ED or

247

hospital admission. This allows us to potentially capture the underlying variable mechanisms of

248

the complex disease, but also enhances the generalizability and feasibility of the identified

249

subphenotypes to be used in clinical practices and patient enrollment in clinical trials.

250
251

Importantly, the 4 subphenotypes identified were significantly separated in demographics,

252

clinical variables, and chronic comorbidities, and strongly predictive of the 60-day mortality

253

outcome. Subphenotype IV included more older, male patients, abnormal markers indicating

254

hyperinflammation, liver injury, cardiovascular problems, renal dysfunctions, and coagulation

255

disorders, and a higher comorbidity burden (except for obesity) compared to the other

256

subphenotypes. In contrast, Subphenotype I was composed of relatively healthy, younger

257

females who had more normal values across all markers and comorbidity burdens compared to

258

the other subphenotypes. There was a strong concordance between their clinical profiles and

259

outcomes, such as Subphenotype IV showed the worst clinical outcome while Subphenotype I

260

showed the best outcome among the 4 subphenotypes. These are in line with observations

261

reported in a previous small cohort study23. Interestingly, Subphenotypes II and III showed

262

similar, moderate-level 60-day mortality rates, but their clinical characteristic profiles suggested

263

that they were likely to have distinct biological mechanisms. In particular, results from our

264

primary analysis and validation approaches demonstrated that Subphenotype II was correlated

265

with relative hyperinflammation, while Subphenotype III was associated with renal injury, lower

266

platelet level and a high comorbidity burden (significantly higher than Subphenotypes I and II,

267

and equivalent to Subphenotype IV). Moreover, in accordance with the clinical characteristics

268

and outcomes, the worse subphenotypes (Subphenotypes III and IV) were more likely to receive

269

medications in antibiotics, corticosteroids, and vasopressor than the others. These findings

270

suggested that our identified subphenotypes offer insight into the varied mechanisms of COVID-

271

19.

272
273

Typically, data-driven approaches for the identification of subphenotypes of human disease are

274

based on the unsupervised clustering methods12,14-16,22-24,32. The natural attributes of the

275

unsupervised methodology in discovering underlying patterns from data make them the best fit

276

for subphenotype identification. Once the subphenotypes were determined, there would be a

277

need of subphenotype membership assignments for new patients. However, previous studies

278

barely discussed such down-stream usability of the identified subphenotypes. In this analysis,

279

280

achieved an ideal prediction performance in the development cohort and predicted

281

subphenotypes in the external validation cohort that presented the same pattern of clinical

282

characteristics with that of the originally derived subphenotypes. In this way, instead of

283

validating the subphenotypes in a different route, the predictive model brought additional

284

implications as: 1) it provides a feasible and accurate way to apply the identified subphenotypes

285

to clinical practice; and 2) contributions of the clinical variables in subphenotype prediction

286

calculated by the SHAP method showed concordant patterns with the subphenotypes’ clinical

287

characteristics and hence confirmed biological profiles of the subphenotypes in the multivariate

288

prospective.

289
290

Time is a crucial factor in the spread of COVID-19. Previous studies have examined the

291

temporal trends of COVID-19 outcomes such as in-hospital mortality rate during the course of

292

the pandemic26,27, but limited attention has been drawn on evolving patterns of COVID-19

293

phenotypes. We filled this gap in the present study. Our observations suggested varied

294

temporal trends of the identified subphenotypes during the first 14 weeks of the pandemic in

295

NYC. Interestingly, since the COVID-19 outbreak in NYC on March 1, 2020, Subphenotypes I

296

and II dominated the time period prior to the peak (first 4 weeks since outbreak), possibly as

297

they contained more relatively younger patients who may have had more frequent social

298

activities to be infected. Subphenotype IV, with older age, worse health conditions, and poorer

299

outcomes, was boosted within the second month (April 2020) post spread peak, consistent with

300

tremendous mortality rate of NYC in April33.

301

This would suggest that younger, biologically strong patients (Subphenotypes I and II) got

302

infections early and boosted the spread, while older, biologically vulnerable patients

303

(Subphenotype IV) accounted for the second infections within a population probably due to

304

housing. After that, the proportion of Subphenotype I out of all patients confirmed per week

305

gradually expanded while that of the others, especially Subphenotype IV shrank. The potential

306

reason would be that valuable experience (such as the improved use of masks and social

307

distancing), reinforced health care systems, and announced health policies did protect the

308

population who likely develop severe subphenotypes (Subphenotype IV). In general, such

309

temporal trends of the biological subphenotypes would be a considerable, fine-grained

310

explanation of the observed outcome (mortality rate) evolving trends in epidemiology26.

311
312

SDoH such as vulnerable socioeconomic neighborhood status have been associated with poor

313

outcomes of COVID-1926,30. In this work, we explored the impact of SDoH on different biological

314

subphenotypes from both univariate and multivariate perspectives. We first examined the

315

associations

316

subphenotype. We then derived comprehensive SDoH strata using the data-driven clustering

317

method and evaluated their correlations with mortality risk in each subphenotype. The results

318

confirmed our hypothesis that SDoH impacts biological subphenotypes differently. The highly

319

expanded mortality risk log odds of individual SDoH variables and discrepancy of mortality rate

320

among SDoH strata indicate that SDoH has a much stronger association with mortality

321

outcomes in Subphenotype IV, compared to the others. In other words, once a sick, elderly

322

patient shows up with COVID-19 (Subphenotype IV), the disadvantaged socioeconomic status

323

significantly increased their mortality. In contrast, disadvantaged SDoH status was unlikely to

324

lead to significantly increased mortality risk in Subphenotype I. This evidence further

325

demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected patients with lower

326

socioeconomic status. In general, our findings added new information on social disparities in the

327

COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike previous studies29,30,34,35 that focused on the entire population, we

328

extended the study from a new angle by focusing on the biologically different populations (i.e.,

329

subphenotypes). Our findings also showed evidence that the identified subphenotypes would

330

provide considerable guidance in health policy to reduce social disparities in the pandemic.

333

Limitations

334

While this study presents a new contribution in the efforts to parse the biological heterogeneity

335

of COVID-19, there remain several limitations. First of all, our data-driven approach relied on the

336

availability of patient data. In this study, we identified subphenotypes using the routinely

337

collected clinical variables that were correlated with COVID-1936 and available in the INSIGHT

338

database37. We were not able to extract presenting symptoms and vital data while the

339

incorporation of such data would add in new insights.

340
341

Second, in our study, the analyzed data were collected at ED or hospital presentation, so the

342

time between COVID-19 symptom onset to ED or hospital presentation could be a covariate of

343

disease severity and clinical outcomes. However, such data was not available in the INSIGHT

344

database.

345
346

Third, missing values may affect the robustness of the identified subphenotypes. In order to

347

address this issue, we excluded variables with high missingness. For the remaining variables,

348

we used the K-nearest neighbors imputation algorithm38. Even so, we still missed these real

349

values hence may incorporate bias.

350
351

Fourth, our study was based on presenting clinical data, such that each patient was

352

characterized in a snapshot. The full use of longitudinal data of patients may allow us to capture

353

the complexity of the disease arc to identify interesting subphenotypes. Previous studies tried to

354

derive COVID-19 subphenotypes based on longitudinal information22,24, yet they were based on

355

univariate trajectory data in small cohorts. The collection of multivariate, longitudinal data in

356

large cohorts remains challenging and modeling such data to identify subphenotypes requires

357

improved data-driven methods12,13,21.

358
359

Fifth, this is a multiple institutional analysis in NYC. To evaluate the generalizability of the

360

identified subphenotypes, further validation on data collected from other areas is needed in

361

future work.

367

Study design and cohort description

368

We used data of COVID-19 patients from INSIGHT Clinical Research Network (CRN)37.

369

INSIGHT is funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and

370

aggregates clinical data of diverse patient populations across five academic medical centers in

371

New York City (NYC), including New York University Langone Medical Center (NYU-LMC), New

372

York Presbyterian - Weill Cornell Medical Center (NYP-WCMC), New York Presbyterian -

373

Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC), Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS), and

374

Montefiore Medical Center (MMC). COVID-19 diagnosis was defined as having at least one

375

positive laboratory test result for SARS-CoV-2 infection or at least one ICD-10 diagnosis code

376

for COVID-19 (see eMethods in Supplement). Study participants were adult patients who were

377

diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated in ED or inpatient settings in these five health centers

378

from March 1 to June 12, 2020. Criteria used to assess patient eligibility are illustrated in

eFigure 1 in Supplement. Exclusion criteria include younger than 18 years old; duplicated

380

patient IDs; having no emergency department (ED) or inpatient (IP) admission within 14 days

381

after COVID-19 confirmation; or having missing values on all clinical variables. Considering the

382

population diversity of the five medical centers (see eTable 1 in Supplement), we combined

383

patients of four centers and randomly divided them into the development cohort (70%) and

384

internal validation cohort (30%). Patients of the last center were used as the external validation

385

cohort.

386

387

Candidate variables for subphenotype identification

388

We considered 30 clinical variables associated with COVID-19 onset, symptoms, or outcomes36

389

and available in the INSIGHT database as the candidate variables to derive subphenotypes.

390

The variables included inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate

391

[ESR],

392

dehydrogenase [LDH], lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, and white blood cell count),

393

inflammatory and

394

aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], and bilirubin), markers of

395

cardiovascular conditions (creatine kinase [CK], lactate, troponin I, and troponin T), markers of

396

renal dysfunctions (bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, chloride, and sodium),

397

markers of hematologic dysfunctions (d-dimer, hemoglobin, platelet count, prothrombin time

398

[PT], red blood cell distribution width [RDW], and glucose), and oxygen saturation. For each

399

patient, we extracted the first value of each clinical variable within the collection window, which

400

was defined as: 1) time period from COVID-19 confirmation to the first inpatient encounter, if

401

the patient has an inpatient admission within 14 days after confirmation; or 2) 14 days after

402

COVID-19 confirmation if there was only ED encounters but no inpatient admissions following

the COVID-19 diagnosis. If there was no record in the collection window, we extracted the last

404

value within 3 days before confirmation (see eFigure 2 in Supplement).

405

Other clinical characteristics, clinical outcomes, and medications

406

We also examined other clinical characteristics of the patients, including demographics,

407

comorbidities, and body mass index (BMI). Demographics included age, sex, and race. Baseline

408

comorbidities included hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure,

409

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cancer, obesity, and hyperlipidemia.

410

For each patient, the most recent BMI data was collected. We analyzed 60-day all-cause

411

mortality as the primary outcome for the patients. Need for mechanical ventilation and

412

admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) were the secondary outcomes. We also analyzed the

413

treatments for COVID-19, including antibiotics (combining ceftriaxone, azithromycin, piperacillin

414

tazobactam, meropenem, vancomycin, and doxycycline), corticosteroids (combining prednisone,

415

methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone), hydroxychloroquine, enoxaparin,

416

heparin, and vasopressor. These above data were collected from patient records available in

417

the INSIGHT database as well.

418

SDoH data

419

To explore the impact of SDoH status on the subphenotypes, we extracted patients’

420

neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics, including median household income, percentage

421

of residents without a high school degree, percentage of residents who are essential workers,

422

percentage of households with crowding housing conditions (i.e., households with >1 person

423

per room), percentage of non-white residents, and unemployment rate. These characteristics

424

were extracted from the 2018 American Community Survey39. Previous studies40-46 have

425

indicated that these social conditions are associated with higher probability of infection,

426

hospitalization, and other adverse outcomes, e.g., mortality, in COVID-19.

427

428

Statistical methods

429

Data preparation

430

We first assessed the value distributions and missingness of the 30 candidate clinical variables

431

(see eTables 2 and 3 in Supplement). For data quality control, 7 variables of high missingness

432

(missing more than 70% values) were excluded and the remaining 23 variables were used for

433

deriving subphenotypes. Logarithmic transformation was applied to the non-normal distributed

434

variables (see eTable 4 in Supplement). In order to eliminate the effects of value magnitude, all

435

variables were scaled based on z-score. K-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation38 was used to

436

address missing values (see eMethods in Supplement).

437

438

Subphenotype derivation, validation, and prediction

439

We originally derived subphenotypes using the development cohort. More specifically,

440

agglomerative hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance calculation and Ward linkage

441

criterion47 was applied to the 23 clinical variables after data preparation. We used agglomerative

442

hierarchical clustering because it is robust to different types of data distributions and typically

443

produces a dendrogram that visualizes data structure to help determine the optimal cluster

444

number. Besides dendrogram, we calculated 21 measures of clustering models provided by

445

‘NbClust’ software48 to determine the optimal number of clusters, i.e., subphenotypes.

446

447

In order to evaluate the reproducibility, we validated our subphenotypes in four ways. First, we

448

performed sensitivity analyses using the development cohort to evaluate 1) sensitivity to quality

449

control and outliers and 2) sensitivity to clustering algorithms. To assess sensitivity to quality

450

control and outliers, we incorporated all 30 candidate variables and excluded patients who have

451

outlier values (see eMethods in Supplement). Then similar to the primary analysis, we

452

performed agglomerative hierarchical clustering to re-derive subphenotypes and determined

453

optimal cluster number using dendrogram and ‘NbClust’. To assess sensitivity to clustering

454

algorithms, we re-derived subphenotypes using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)49, which is

455

a probabilistic model for clustering analysis based on a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The

456

optimal cluster number in GMM was determined by comprehensively considering Akaike

457

information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and median probability of group

458

membership (see eMethods in Supplement).

459
460

Second, we used the internal validation cohort and re-derived subphenotypes using the same

461

agglomerative hierarchical clustering with the primary analysis for validation. The optimal cluster

462

number was determined using dendrogram and ‘NbClust’ as well.

463
464

Third, for the aims of confirming subphenotypes and their usability, we used the supervised

465

predictive model. More specifically, considering subphenotype membership of each patient as

466

the label to predict, we built a predictive model of subphenotypes based on the 23 clinical

467

variables used for subphenotype derivation. The predictive model was based on the supervised

468

XGBoost classifier50, a powerful tree-based machine learning model. The predictive model was

469

trained in the development cohort using a 10-fold cross-validation strategy. To address the

470

multi-label classification (since we identified more than 2 subphenotypes), a one-vs-the-rest

471

strategy was used in model training. Prediction performance was measured by receiver

472

operating characteristics curve (ROC) and area under ROC curve (AUC). We also engaged the

19

473

SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values to assess contributions of the clinical variables in

474

distinguishing each subphenotype from the others. Once the predictive model was trained, it

475

was performed on the external validation cohort to predict the patients’ subphenotype

476

memberships.

477
478

Last, to assess stability of the subphenotypes across the five medical centers, we further

479

performed leave-one-center-out analysis (see eMethods in Supplement).

480

481

Subphenotype interpretation

482

For the aim of subphenotype interpretation, we first visualized the subphenotypes in two ways: 1)

483

2-D visualization calculated by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)

484

algorithm51 based on clinical variables for clustering (showing distributions of subphenotypes

485

within low-dimensional space); 2) chord diagrams52 showing differences of subphenotypes in

486

terms of abnormal clinical variable groups and comorbidities (see eMethods in Supplement).

487
488

We also characterized subphenotypes by evaluating their differences in demographics, all

489

clinical variables, comorbidities, clinical outcomes, and medications prescribed after COVID-19

490

confirmation. Data were presented as median (interquartile range [IQR]) for continuous

491

variables and exact patient number (percentage) for categorical variables. To compare

492

subphenotypes, we performed the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous data and ߯ ଶ test for

493

categorical data. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was also applied for between-

494

subphenotypes comparisons, adjusting for age and gender. Two-tailed P-values smaller than

495

0.05 were considered as the threshold for statistical significance. Survival analyses were

496

performed to assess associations of subphenotypes to clinical outcomes, where Kaplan-Meier

497

plots were created accordingly.

499

Temporal pattern of subphenotypes

500

To evaluate the temporal pattern of the subphenotypes during the course of the pandemic, we

501

created bar charts to visualize the proportion of each subphenotype out of the total patients

502

confirmed per week, since the COVID-19 outbreak in NYC (March 1, 2020).

503

504

Impacts of SDoH on COVID-19 subphenotypes

505

Multiple analyses were conducted to assess the impact of SDoH on COVID-19 subphenotypes.

506

For each subphenotype, we first performed logistic regression analysis and Cox regression

507

analysis to assess the association of each SDoH variable with 60-day mortality, adjusting for

508

age, sex, and/or clinical variables. After that, we performed agglomerative hierarchical clustering

509

on the 6 socioeconomic variables to derive comprehensive SDoH strata. Within each

510

subphenotype, we compared 60-day mortality rates between the SDoH strata. We also used

511

logistic regression analysis and Cox regression analysis to assess the association of SDoH

512

strata with 60-day mortality, adjusting for age and sex, within each subphenotype.

Montefiore Medical Center. b. Data preparation for clustering analysis. c. Derivation of
subphenotypes in the development cohort. Reproducibility of the identified subphenotypes were
evaluated in multiple ways, including
(d) sensitivity analyses in the development cohort and subphenotype re-derivation in the internal
validation cohort; and (e) training subphenotype predictive model in the development cohort and
(f) using it to predict subphenotype memberships of patients in the external validation cohort.
Last, (g) further analyses were conducted to interpret subphenotypes, explore temporal patterns
of subphenotypes during the pandemic, and evaluate impact of SDoH characterisitics on
subphenotypes.
