Abstract

Building public trust and willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 is as important as
developing an effective vaccine. However, a significant minority of the public are unwilling or
hesitant to take a COVID-19 vaccine, when available. A nationally representative sample survey
(N=1040) was conducted in July 2020 in New Zealand to identify factors associated with
COVID-19 vaccine intention. Trust in experts and general vaccine hesitancy were significantly
associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention. A communication campaign from trusted scientific
experts, with information that addresses prevailing concerns about vaccines, is likely to help
increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake.

The Persistence of Vaccine Hesitancy: COVID-19 Vaccination Intention in New Zealand
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is continuing to have an
unprecedented impact on the public health and the global economy. Over 35.5 million cases and
1 million deaths have been reported in 227 countries and territories. New Zealand has been one
of the few countries that is largely successful in containing the COVID-19 spread so far, due to
tough border controls and contact tracing (World Health Organization, 2020).
An unprecedented scientific endeavor is underway to develop a vaccine against the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID19. Just as important as developing a COVID-19 vaccine is to develop public enthusiasm for
vaccination. Public attitudes towards vaccination can shift and it is important to gauge public
perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine for high vaccination uptake when a COVID-19 vaccine
becomes available (de Figueiredo et al., 2020; Fadda et al., 2020; Palamenghi et al., 2020;
Verger & Dubé, 2020).
This study applies the theory of planed behavior (Ajzen, 1991), which states that attitudes
play a key role in shaping behavioral intentions, which in turn, serve as a proximal predictor of
behaviors. Other independent predictors of behavioral intention include subjective norms and
behavioral control. Attitudes are defined as positive or negative assessment towards an object or
an issue (Binder et al., 2009; also see Fazio, 1986). Attitudes towards vaccines can be defined as
expression of support or hesitancy across different vaccines (e.g., Yaqub et al., 2014). While a
number of studies assess attitudes towards vaccines, they have several limitations, including use
of few measures that are not validated (Krishna, 2018; Xiao, 2019; Lin et al., 2020), student
samples and limited number of studies outside the US and European context (see Larson et al.,
2016 for review). Even recent studies on COVID-19 vaccine intentions use only a few items to
measure vaccine hesitancy (Cadeddu et al., 2020; Detoc et al., 2020).

Vaccine hesitancy is one of the 10 most important health threats in the world today
(World Health Organization, 2019). Vaccine hesitancy can be defined as reluctance or refusal to
vaccinate despite its accessibility (MacDonald, 2015). Public health campaigns must address
vaccine hesitancy long before actual refusal takes place, thereby increasing public confidence
and inoculating the public against misinformation about vaccines. While most studies on vaccine
hesitancy focus on subpopulations such as parents and caregivers or specific vaccines (e.g.,
HPV), a generalized vaccine hesitancy scale will better help understand the public unmet need
for health information (Larson et al., 2015; Luyten et al., 2019). Previous attempts to develop a
generalized vaccine hesitancy scale have been limited with only one study clarifying the
dimensions of vaccine hesitancy among general public (Luyten et al., 2019).
The current study examined factors associated with the intention to get a COVID-19
vaccine using data from a national sample survey of adults in New Zealand. Given the novelty of
the disease, apart from demographic correlates, other factors tested in the study are vaccine
hesitancy (Luyten et al., 2019; Shapiro et al., 2018), trust in scientists (Cadeddu et al., 2020; de
Figueiredo et al., 2020; Justwan et al., 2019; Larson et al., 2018; Palamenghi et al., 2020), and
knowledge about COVID-19 origin, symptoms, spread, and preventive behaviours (Reiter et al.,
2020). Trust in scientific experts is central in several science communication and health
communication studies (e.g., Hmielowski et al., 2013; Malka et al., 2009; Poortinga & Pidgeon,
2003; Siegrist et al., 2005; Slovic, 1993) as information from trusted sources reduce cognitive
effort and provides mental short-cuts to help individuals make decisions, particularly about
highly uncertain issues, such as a new vaccine. Empirical evidence on the role of knowledge in
shaping public acceptance of vaccines is mixed (Motta et al., 2018), therefore essential to study
in the context of potential new vaccines. Findings of this study can help guild theory and practice
of public health campaigns for COVID-19 vaccination uptake.

Method

Study design
A nationally representative sample survey of the New Zealand adults was conducted
between June 26 to July 13, 2020, after the country was briefly at the Alert Level 1, with fewer
restrictions. The web-based survey was fielded by Qualtrics, an international survey agency. A
stratified random sampling plan was followed to match the official Census estimates. The
average time to complete the survey was 22 minutes. Ethics approval to conduct the survey was
received from the Massey University Human Ethics Committee (Ethics Notification Number:
4000022852 by Professor Craig Johnson, Chair, Human Ethics Chairs' Committee and Director,
Research Ethics). Participants provided informed consent after reading brief aims of the survey
about public opinion about current issues facing the country and the world.
Measures
COVID-19 Vaccination Intention
Following recent surveys (O’Keefe, 2020; Reiter et al., 2020), respondents were asked,
“If a coronavirus vaccine were available soon, what would you do? - I will get vaccinated against
the coronavirus when one becomes available.” Response options included “yes” and “no.”
Knowledge about COVID-19
Eleven questions measured dichotomously (True or False), were used to compute
knowledge about COVID-19. These questions started with a prompt, “To the best of your
knowledge, which of the following statements true or false.” All scientifically accurate
statements were coded 1 compared to 0. Eight statements were scientifically accurate relating to
symptoms (dry cough (True, 1, 87%), fever (93%)), spread (“the coronavirus can be spread by
people who do not show symptoms,” Yes, 1, 93%), protection (frequent hand washing, 97%),
avoiding large gatherings (92%), 6-feet distance (74%), and cure (“there is currently no cure for
the coronavirus, 81%). Five statements were scientifically inaccurate, including on impact on

elderly (“only elderly people get infected,” False, coded as 1, 94%), and protection
(“Hydroxychloroquine can prevent or kill coronavirus,” False, 1, 84%; “antibiotics can prevent
or kill the coronavirus,” False, 1, 84%; “exposure to sun or extreme heat can prevent or kill the
coronavirus,” False, 1, 76%). Similarly, the respondents who correctly identified conspiracy
theories as false were coded as 1 (“5G towers are spreading coronavirus,” False, 1, 93%; “Bill
Gates may have created the coronavirus to profit,” False, 1, 90%; “coronavirus was created in a
lab,” False, 1, 66%). The scientifically accurate answers were summed to create an index of
knowledge about COVID-19 (M = 9.58, SD = 1.56; KR-20 (Kuder-Richardson Formula 20) =
.58).
Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS)
Following previous studies that validated vaccine hesitancy scale (Larson et al., 2018;
Luyten et al., 2019; Shapiro et al., 2018), attitudes towards vaccination was measured using 14
items using a 5-point scale, from strongly disagree to strongly agree with neither agree nor
disagree serving as a mid-point. The questions followed a prompt, “Regarding vaccines, how
much do you agree or disagree with following statements.” These items include previously
validated 9-item Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (Luyten et al., 2019): one-item, “I do not need
vaccines for diseases that are not common anymore,” was not used as two recent studies found
the item to be unreliable (Luyten et al., 2019; Shapiro et al., 2018). In addition, six new items
sourced from systematic reviews about vaccine hesitancy were tested: “Vaccines cause diseases”
(Gidengil et al., 2019), “Government over hypes the need for vaccines,” (Gidengil et al., 2019),
“Corporations manufacturing vaccines only care for profit,” (Gidengil et al., 2019), “I am
uncomfortable getting a vaccine that was rushed into production” (Hoffman, 2020; Seale et al.,
2010), and “I feel uncomfortable getting vaccinated” (Maisonneuve et al., 2018).

Trust in Scientific Experts
Trust in scientific exerts was measured using four items starting with a prompt, “How
much do you trust or distrust the following organizations or people as a source of accurate
information?” Using a 5-point response scale, with strongly distrust to strongly trust,
respondents were asked how much they trust in (1) scientists (M= 3.99, SD=1.09), (2) medical
experts (M= 4.14, SD=1.02), (3) infectious disease experts (M= 4.11, SD=1.02), and (4) your
doctor or GP (general practitioner) (M= 4.16, SD=.94). The four items were added to compute an
index of trust in scientific experts (r’s ranged from .47 to .75, p<.001; α = .87, Kaiser-MeyerOlkin measure = .82, Bartlett’s test of sphericity (χ2 (6) = 2151.39, p < .001)).
Demographic Characteristics
The survey assessed a range of demographic variables (see Table 1).
Data analysis
The data was weighted, post-survey, on gender, age, education, and ethnicity to match
the New Zealand census estimates. Weights ranged from 0.47 to 3.30, with a mean of 1.21,
median of 0.98, and a standard deviation of 0.63. 95% of the weights fall between 0.58 and 2.15.
To assess the dimensions of the 14-item vaccine hesitancy scale, the dataset was randomly and
evenly split to test and validate the scale. Relative risk regression models with robust standard
errors (Zou, 2004) were used to identify correlates of COVID-19 vaccine intension, as they are
more intuitive than odds ratios and is a common method in public health research. Data were
analyzed using IBM SPSS version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
Results
Participant Characteristics
Two-thirds (74%) of the respondents said they intend to get vaccinated against COVID19 when one becomes available and a quarter (26%) said they do not intend to do so.

Vaccine Hesitancy Scale
The sample was randomly split into half to test the dimensions of vaccine hesitancy scale.
Exploratory factor analysis for the 14-items with the first half of the sample indicated a two
factor solution, similar to prior studies (Luyten et al., 2019; Shapiro et al., 2018) (see Table 2).
Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was .93, above the commonly recommended
value of .6, and Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant (χ2 (91) = 5224.38, p < .001). These
two factors were labelled as “lack of confidence” factor, accounting for 49.65% of the variance,
and “risks” factor, accounting for 17.49% variance, based on previous studies (Luyten et al.,
2019; Shapiro et al., 2018). These two factors accounted for 67.15% of the common variance of
the scale.
Confirmatory factor analysis assessed the vaccine hesitancy scale using items from the
other half of the sample. The best goodness-of-fit for the 14-item version was with two factors
(RMSEA = 0.078, CFI = 0.95, TLI = 0.94). Thus, a two-factor structure, consisting of a “lack of
confidence” (r’s = 0.62 to 0.82, α = .95) part with 7 items, and a “risks perception” (r’s = 0.28 to
0.63, α = .82) part with 7 items, showed the best psychometric characteristics of the VHS. On a
scale from 1 to 5, with a higher score indicating higher vaccine hesitancy, the average respondent
scored 1.97 (SD = 0.98) for the lack of confidence factor and 2.89 (SD = 0.93) for risks,
highlighting that the hesitancy was driven more by risk perceptions than by lack of confidence in
vaccines.
Intension to get a COVID-19 vaccine
Several demographic variables were correlated with willingness to get vaccinated against
COVID-19 in bivariate analyses (See Table 3). Men compared to women, older respondents
compared to younger, more educated compared to less educated, higher annual income
compared to lower-income, Asian and other ethnicities compared to Māori, respondents without
children compared to those with children, and those who did not smoke or vape compared to

those who do, were more likely to say they intend to get vaccinated against COVID-19 when one
becomes available.
In multivariable analyses (See Table 4), men compared to women (RR = 1.11, 95% CI:
1.05–1.18) and those without children compared to those with children (RR = 1.09, 95% CI:
1.02–1.16) were more willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were also more willing if
they reported higher levels of trust in scientific experts (RR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.04–1.16).
Moreover, with respect to general vaccine hesitancy attitudes, respondents with higher
confidence about vaccines (RR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.73–0.83) and those who perceived fewer risks
(RR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.87–0.96) were more willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. There was no
significant association between COVID-19 knowledge and intention to get vaccinated against
COVID-19.
Discussion
A national sample survey in New Zealand shows that 74% of adults intend to get a
COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available. This is similar to findings from global surveys
(O’Keefe, 2020), although slightly higher than several countries such as Australia (Rhodes et al.,
2020), US (Reiter et al., 2020), and several European countries (Neumann-Böhme et al., 2020).
The most novel finding of this study is that a generalized measure of vaccine hesitancy is
significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention. The vaccine hesitancy scale with 14items was developed following the 9-item VHS scale for the general population (Luyten et al.,
2019), with additional items sourced from systemic reviews of vaccine hesitancy (Gidengil et al.,
2019; Larson et al., 2015, 2018; Maisonneuve et al., 2018; Verger & Dubé, 2020). In probably
the first study of its kind, vaccine hesitancy scale was tested in New Zealand, adding to few
studies of vaccine hesitancy outside Europe and the US (Larson et al., 2018). For example,
(Seale et al., 2010) found that the perception of rushed vaccine production was one of the most
cited fears for the H1N1 vaccine intention. This measure is particularly important given that

public perceptions of a rushed vaccine development or inadequate testing may lead them to
question the safety of the vaccine and increase distrust with vaccination in general (Hoffman,
2020). Findings of this study can help standardize the VHS scale to advance research on vaccine
hesitancy and its enduring impact on public attitudes towards new vaccines.
Knowledge about COVID-19 was not associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention. This
finding is worrying as another study in the US also shows that knowledge about COVID-19
infection was only moderately associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in bivariate
analysis and was not significantly associated in the presence of other covariates (Reiter et al.,
2020). Knowledge about a disease origin and prevalence alone may be an insufficient motivator
for individual action, indicating a need for future studies to replicate these findings.
Trust in scientific experts is one of the strongest correlates of COVID-19 vaccine
intention, similar to previous studies on general vaccination behaviors (e.g., de Figueiredo et al.,
2020). Individuals rely on trusted sources of information to make judgments in uncertain
information context, such as the rapid, multinational effort to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.
Building public trust in scientific experts, particularly among historically disenfranchised
communities who may already harbor high distrust with government and scientific elite, by
building community relationships is particularly important to decrease the vaccination gap
among the most vulnerable groups.
The strengths of this study include a large representative sample, multiple items to
measure and test vaccine hesitancy, trust in scientific experts, and knowledge about COVID-19.
A primary limitation is the cross-sectional design of the study. Attitudes towards COVID-19
vaccine are likely to shift, as seen in other countries (e.g., Rhodes et al., 2020), therefore a need
to further monitor shifting public attitudes and correlates affecting this shift. Future research
should also explore other dimensions of vaccine hesitancy, such as the desire for autonomy and
morality concerns (Gidengil et al., 2019).

Conclusion
The World Health Organization identifies vaccine hesitancy as one of the 10 most
important health threats to the world (World Health Organization, 2019). Increasing public
enthusiasm for vaccination should co-occur with the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.
Findings of this study suggest that a health communication campaign from trusted sources, with
information that addresses prevailing concerns about vaccines, is likely to help increase COVID19 vaccine uptake.

Note: Items were coded on a 5-point scale, from strongly agree to strongly disagree—higher scores indicate higher
vaccine hesitancy. EFC refers to exploratory factor analysis; CFA refers to confirmatory factor analysis; (R) refers
to recoded items; VHS refers to Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (e.g., Luyten et al., 2019). For EFA, factors were
extracted using Principal Component Analysis with varimax rotation (with Kaiser Normalization).
