Abstract
Unemployment shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic have reignited concerns over the
long-term effects of job loss on population health. Past research has highlighted the corrosive
effects of unemployment on health and health behaviors. This study examines whether the effects
of job loss on changes in body mass index (BMI) are moderated by genetic predisposition using
data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS). To improve detection of gene-byenvironment (G x E) interplay, we interacted layoffs from business closures—a plausibly
exogenous environmental exposure—with whole-genome polygenic scores (PGSs) that capture
genetic contributions to both the population mean (mPGS) and variance (vPGS) of BMI. Results
show evidence of genetic moderation using a vPGS (as opposed to an mPGS) and indicate genomewide summary measures of phenotypic plasticity may further our understanding of how
environmental stimuli modify the distribution of complex traits in a population.

Introduction
Recent unemployment shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic have left millions of older
workers unemployed. In the U.S. alone, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for adults aged
55 and over jumped from 2.6 in February 2020 to as high as 13.6 in April 20201. Recent evidence
indicates unemployment rates for workers 55 and older have exceeded those of mid-career workers
since the pandemic began—the first time in nearly 50 years that older workers have faced higher
unemployment than mid-career workers2. For older workers in particular, the scarring effects of
unexpected job loss could be severe. Job loss at older ages has been associated with longer periods
of unemployment than any other age group3,4, higher rates of depression and anxiety5–7, and a
sharp increase in the need for medical care due to heightened stress levels and gaps in health
insurance coverage8,9. Further, when reemployed, older workers suffer significant wage penalties
and lower levels of employer-offered pension and health insurance10–12. All these factors could
trigger chronic stress and adverse changes in health and health behaviors13,14.
This study expands on past work by examining the degree to which underlying genetic
predisposition moderates changes in body mass index (BMI) after a job loss. Genotype-byenvironment (G x E) interaction is a fundamental component of population variance for complex
traits like BMI, but there has been limited success in identifying G x E effects in human populations
due to several challenges, including the complexity of measuring environmental exposures, a need
for statistical methods that can screen for genetic effects on phenotypic variability, and inadequate
power to detect small G x E effects at loci across the genome15–17. To overcome the third challenge
of lower power to detect individual effects in the context of multiple hypothesis testing, researchers
have used whole-genome polygenic scores (PGSs) constructed from well-powered genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) that summarize the genomic contribution to a trait or disease across

common variants in the genome18. That is, PGSs aggregate thousands of genome-wide genetic
influences on a phenotype into a single index using results from GWAS that estimate the
association between genetic variants and the conditional mean of a phenotype, which we refer to
herein as mGWAS. However, PGSs constructed from mGWAS may not capture the impact of
loci that contribute to within-individual variance in an outcome that are more responsive to
environmental stimuli (i.e., variance quantitative loci or vQTLs). Since estimating genetic
contributions to within-person variability is hindered by a lack of large datasets with genotype data
and longitudinal phenotypic data on participants, researchers have developed methods that can
detect population-level variance effects that are not driven by mean effects, referred to herein as
vGWAS16,19–23. In this study, we apply summary statistics from both mGWAS and vGWAS to
construct whole genome PGSs for BMI that capture mean effects (mPGS) and variance effects
(vPGS)24. Evaluating both measures in a G x E framework is necessary because environmental
shifts may moderate individuals’ propensity for higher or lower BMI, and/or their propensity
towards changes in BMI or BMI plasticity21,24.
Our data come from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS is a nationally
representative, longitudinal study with genotype data and over twenty years of sociodemographic
data on respondents, including individual-level exposures to involuntary job losses from business
closures. We focus specifically on business closures because they are typically the byproduct of
external, firm level decisions to restructure or relocate businesses and are therefore considered
more exogenous than layoffs or firings, which may be correlated with unobserved health or worker
characteristics that could bias G x E estimates 25–27. The majority of G x E interaction studies use
endogenous measures of the environment that cannot address the non-random distribution of genes
across environments. This is important because G x E interactions can, in that case, be proxying

a different, unmeasured E that is interacting with G, or G x G interactions (i.e., epistasis) or even
E x E (if the measured genes proxy other environments). Specifically, in the case of job loss being
endogenous (e.g., for cause), such a measure could be intertwined with a host of unobserved
genetic or environmental influences that are associated with health and changes in BMI28–30.
To address this, our empirical strategy interacts business closures with, respectively, an
mPGS and vPGS in a regression-adjusted semiparametric difference-in-differences (DiD)
propensity score matching framework that compares the BMI of those before and after an
involuntary job loss with a control group that was not laid off. Combining propensity score
matching with DiD estimation makes the model more robust to selection on observables and
unobservables with time invariant effects (e.g., ability or worker preferences)31. This is necessary
because although business closures are plausibly more exogenous than layoffs or firings, it is still
possible that workers with unhealthy behaviors or poor health, for example, could select into more
vulnerable or volatile industries32. To date, we are aware of only one other study that has leveraged
a vPGS and a quasi-natural experiment (education reform in the UK) to detect G x E interaction
effects on BMI and educational attainment24. Results from this study found evidence of mPGS and
vPGS interaction effects, indicating that both forms of moderation need to be tested in G x E
interaction studies.
In the context of older workers in the U.S., we focus on changes in BMI for two reasons.
First, BMI is an inexpensive, non-invasive proxy measure of adiposity that is available for all HRS
waves and is predictive of metabolic syndrome and other more difficult to measure
anthropomorphic measures like abdominal adiposity that increase risk for cardiovascular disease
and type 2 diabetes33. In older adults, unintentional weight loss or frailty can also be harmful and
indicative of decreased resistance to stressors, resulting in greater vulnerability to disease and

disability34–38. Past studies have found slight increases in BMI from unemployment31,39,
particularly in middle-aged workers, but there is no consensus, and some studies that look at the
causal impact of job loss on BMI or related health outcomes have been unable to locate an average
treatment effect40–42. Using the HRS, Salm finds no causal effect of business closures on various
measures of physical and mental health, whereas Gallo et al. find involuntary job loss is associated
with increased depressive symptoms and risk of stroke but not myocardial infarction6,40,43. A few
studies have explored the possiblity that the health impacts of job loss vary across the distribution
of health status39,42. For example, using finite mixture models, Deb et al. found increases in
drinking and BMI were concentrated among workers who were already pursuing unhealthy
behaviors pre-job loss, indicating the effects of job loss may be especially problematic for highrisk individuals. However, because genetic data have only recently become available in large
population studies, past research was not able to explore the possibility that the impact of job loss
on intra-individual fluctuations in BMI may vary across the spectrum of genetic risk.
Second, we focus on changes in BMI because BMI is currently the most well studied
phenotypic trait in vGWAS. Previous meta-analyses of mGWAS have identified more than 100
genome-wide significant loci associated with BMI44–48. The largest cluster of highly significant
genetic variants is located in the FTO (fat mass and obesity associated) gene region on
chromosome 16. Studies suggest FTO polymorphisms increase obesity risk through subtle
changes in food intake and preference and affect pathways in the central nervous system that
regulate appetite45,49. In particular, the SNP rs1421085 underlies the association between the FTO
locus and obesity via activation of IRX3 and IRX5, which play a role in the differentiation of
adipocyte subtypes50. Recent vGWAS have found evidence for loci with variance effects on BMI
located in genes responsible for adipocyte differentiation (PPARG) and genes implicated in the

pathology of obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer (FTO, PPARG, CCNL1, TCF7L2,
ZNF668, GIPR)16. Most BMI-associated loci have their largest impact early in life or during
adolescence51, although a few loci, which have also been associated with type 2 diabetes or
coronary artery disease, exhibit stronger effects in older adults52. Past studies have also found
genetic moderation of social aspects of the environment that affect BMI, including lifetime
socioeconomic status (SES), social norms, birth cohort, and institutional policies53–55.
Results indicate that an unexpected job loss did not seem to affect differences in BMI by
mPGS; individuals with higher mPGS had higher levels of BMI regardless of whether they were
in the treatment or control group. However, we do see suggestive evidence of genetic moderation
by vPGS such that individuals in the treatment group varied in their genetic propensity for weight
gain or loss, whereas similarly matched individuals in the control group did not. Genetic
moderation is particularly pronounced in the lower half of the vPGS distribution; less plastic
individuals in the bottom 50% appear to adjust more slowly to environmental changes, resulting
in minor weight loss compared to similarly matched individuals in the control group. Results from
an event time study analysis show that changes in BMI were detectable up to two years post job
loss, but did not persist in the subsequent HRS wave, or up to four years post job loss.

Matching quality and summary statistics. Table 1 displays the means and matching statistics
for covariates by treatment group, control group, and matched control group. Detailed variable
descriptions can be found in Supplementary Table 1, and additional descriptive statistics are
reported in Supplementary Table 2. After matching, covariates should be balanced with little to
no significant differences remaining. We included both the standardized bias and two-sample t-

tests for equality of the means to check for significant differences between covariates for both
groups (Methods)56.
Before matching, individuals affected by a business closure have lower socioeconomic
standing, were less likely to have health insurance, and report worse mental health and health
behaviors than continuously employed individuals. Labor statistics show they were more likely to
work part time, for smaller firms, in the agriculture/fishing/farming, construction/mining,
manufacturing, or trade industries, were more likely to be blue collar, and have lower job tenure
than workers in the control group. We do not see any significant differences in BMI between
treatment and control groups.
After matching, covariates are more balanced overall, and the standardized biases for the
majority of variables are at or below 5%, which indicates that mean differences between the
treatment and control group are small and the balancing procedure was effective57. Notable
exceptions include mean differences in education, industry, household income, access to health
insurance, and smoking behavior. To minimize any remaining differences between groups, we
control for all covariates in our empirical model. Importantly, we do not see any significant
difference in the mPGS or vPGS between treatment and control groups before or after matching,
indicating the absence of gene-environment correlation (rGE), or evidence of selection into the
treatment group by underlying genetic predisposition.
Construction and predictive performance of vPGS. Because we are incorporating mPGS and
vPGS into our G x E interaction model, it is important to use a vPGS that captures variance effects
that are distinct from mean effects24. To decorrelate the mean and variance effects, Young et al.
proposed a dispersion effects test that can identify differences in the variance of the GWAS sample

as a whole that are not driven by mean effects at the SNP level16. We used dispersion weights
from Young et al. to construct vPGS in the HRS (Methods).
The predictive performance of mPGS for BMI in the HRS and other population-based
samples has been well studied 53–55,58,59. To evaluate the predictive performance of the vPGS, we
fit a Double Generalized Linear Model (DGLM) that allowed us to assess the association between
the vPGS and the between-individual variance in BMI in a UK Biobank (UKB) test sample that is
independent of our HRS testing sample (Methods). Table 2 reports associations from the DGLM
with and without mPGS adjustment (Models 1 and 2, respectively). The dispersion vPGS is
significantly associated with the population variance in BMI in the UKB test sample (p=1.01E04), and this association holds after controlling for the mPGS (p=1.44E-04).
Gene-by-environment (G x E) interaction results. We used a propensity score matched DiD
model to evaluate the effect of job loss from a business closure (Methods). Table 3 shows separate
propensity score adjusted DiD results from specifications with and without the mPGS and vPGS
interactions. Columns 1-2 model changes in BMI without the mPGS and vPGS in the full HRS
sample of workers aged 50-70 (1) and in the same-aged European ancestry analytic sample of
workers with genotype data (2). Columns 3-4 add the main effect (3) and mPGS interaction effect
(4), and Column 5 displays results from the full model with the mPGS and vPGS main effects and
interaction effects. All specifications adjust for the conditioning variables used in the propensity
score matching that are reported in Table 1. Results without PGSs in Columns 1 and 2 do not
condition on genotype in the matching procedure or in the regression analysis. Coefficient pvalues that pass FDR correction are denoted with an asterisk.
The results in Column 1 are similar in magnitude and direction to the HRS results reported
by Deb et al, which find a positive, but insignificant main effect from business closures in the full

HRS sample on changes in BMI in all ancestry groups39. Among genotyped, European ancestry
respondents between the ages of 50 and 70 who report being in the labor force, the main effect is
still insignificant but negative (Column 2). Columns 3-5 show that the inclusion of both the mPGS
and vPGS is necessary to uncover a genetic main effect and an interaction effect: the mPGS
captures a significant main effect of genotype on BMI (p=0.002), while the vPGS captures a
significant G x E effect (p=0.011).

treated individuals in the same HRS wave (Methods). In the mPGS figure, which plots predicted
BMI based on the mPGS interaction model in Column 3, we see differences in the predicted level
of BMI by mPGS, but no significant differences between groups. Conversely, in the vPGS figure,
which plots predicted BMI based on the vPGS interaction model in Column 5, there are no
differences in the predicted level of BMI by vPGS, but as indicated by the cross-over shape of the
interaction, there is suggestive evidence of a G x E interaction, or evidence of environmental
moderation by vPGS for the treatment group relative to the control group in the post-treatment
wave. Significant differences between treatment and control groups can only be seen in the lower
half of the vPGS distribution; individuals below the mean appear more likely to lose weight as a
result of a business closure relative to workers with similar vPGS scores. These results seem to
indicate that less plastic individuals may adapt more slowly to environmental shifts, at least of the
type studied herein.
Event Time Study. We conducted an event time study (ETS) to assess the validity of our findings
and to show the evolution in BMI by vPGS for the treatment and control groups up to four years
post job loss (Methods). The assumption underlying the DiD research design is that in the absence
of an involuntary job loss, BMI would have evolved similarly for the treatment and control groups
(i.e., the “parallel trends” assumption). Figure 2 plots the coefficient estimates from the ETS
model, which can be interpreted as the difference in BMI between treatment and control groups
(Supplementary Table 3). The first panel of Figure 2 indicates the presence of parallel trends in
BMI prior to a business closure for the full sample—i.e., the difference between treatment and
control groups is close to zero and not statistically significant. We then estimated separate event
time study regressions for respondents in the top and bottom 50% of the vPGS distribution to
compare trajectories in BMI for treatment and control groups by vPGS. Similar to the results in

Figure 1, we found suggestive evidence that individuals in the bottom 50% of the vPGS
distribution have a lower BMI on average compared to the control group (p=0.035). Effects did
not appear to persist in the next HRS interview wave at t + 2, or up to four years post job loss.

The figure plots the coefficients from an event time study model for the full sample and by samples

(represented here as year 0). The dotted line depicts the approximate time point that the job loss
occurred—i.e., some point between the baseline year and the current wave.

Discussion
Gene-environment interplay is a fundamental biological process that influences the
diversity of outcomes we observe in human populations60. However, because genetic differences
are tightly interwoven with environmental differences, it is challenging to identify genomic and
environmental factors underlying phenotypic plasticity. The search for interaction effects is

13
further complicated by the fact that the majority of GWAS methods are unable to separate genetic
effects on phenotypic variability from effects on the mean or level of trait values16. As a result,
most PGS x E interaction studies cannot detect interaction effects that are driven by loci that affect
plasticity24. Research suggests that SNPs associated with the variance of BMI (vQTLs) are highly
enriched for G x E interactions, and that these vQTLs play in an important role in cellular response
to the external environment16,22.
In this study, we used a natural experiment to investigate whether the effect of job loss on
BMI—a stressful and often debilitating lifetime event—is moderated by genetic predisposition.
To incorporate genetic effects associated with the population variance in BMI, we followed
Johnson et al. and used summary statistics from recently developed GWAS methods that can
separate SNP mean and variance effects16 to construct vPGS for BMI24. Using both an mPGS and
a vPGS, we find stronger evidence for a vPGS x E interaction. A shift in the environment did not
seem to affect differences in BMI by mPGS; individuals with higher mPGSs had higher levels of
BMI regardless of whether they were in the treatment or control group. However, we do see
differences between the treatment and control groups by vPGS such that less plastic or lower vPGS
treated individuals showed signs of weight loss compared to similarly matched control individuals,
perhaps because they adjust more slowly to an environmental shock compared to high vPGS
individuals. ETS analysis suggests that treatment and control groups evolved similarly prior to
treatment, and that findings are detectable up to two years post job loss.
It is important to note that we deployed, by necessity, a vPGS that was constructed from
weights that were trained in a discovery sample to predict variation between individuals net of
mean effects. However, we are using this measure in analysis that examines within-subject
variation. This is an important distinction that may inform the interpretation of our results.

Namely, our theory is that highly plastic individuals are better able to adapt to changing
environmental contexts and thus maintain a more stable weight in the face of job loss. We classify
individuals as plastic or non-plastic based on their score from a genetic model that predicts whether
an individual scores higher on a cross-individual model of dispersion (independent of mean
effects). In a sense, this means that someone with a higher vPGS has more “noise” in their
prediction than another individual—that is, s/he is less well-predicted from a levels (mean values)
regression than someone with a lower score. Someone who is low on the plasticity score has a
BMI that is predicted better by their levels effects than someone who is high on the score. This,
in turn, we think is indicative of someone whose phenotype is more affected by non-additive
genetic effects (i.e., epistasis) as well as by environmental effects. That is, imagine two groups:
One with a low vPGS and one with a high vPGS. It is the lower-vPGS group that may have a
narrow range around a population mean BMI of 25 (say, SD = 2 units), while those with a high
vPGS may display the same mean BMI in their group (25) but have a wider dispersion (SD = 4
units). Thus, high vPGS individuals do a better job of buffering differences in environments they
encounter and, as a result, their phenotypes vary more widely. In one sense of “plasticity” they
are higher, as their phenotype varies more.
Turning to our within-person analysis in the HRS, low vPGS-scoring individuals may be
more “stable” in their weight from year to year, given the smaller “error” term from the levels
regression. Indeed, when we simply compare the standard deviation of BMI within individuals in
our HRS sample across waves by a quartile split in the vPGS, irrespective of treatment status, we
find that individuals in the lowest quartile of the vPGS score range display a (non-significantly)
lower within-person standard deviation in BMI than individuals in the highest quartile
(Supplementary Table 4). Thus, in the absence of a specific, measured environmental shock, an

15
individual with a low vPGS score derived from the cross-person discovery analysis has more
phenotypic stability in the within-person analysis (i.e., less plasticity). This may be one reason
why we are able to detect significant differences between treated and control individuals up to two
years post job loss in the lower half of the vPGS distribution—i.e., in the presence of an unexpected
job loss, it takes less plastic individuals longer to recover to their pre-job loss weight. On the other
hand, it could be that less plastic individuals display a more stable weight trajectory overall—
regardless of environmental forces, rendering our ability to see a “specific” environmental effect
more clearly. Although our results point to the former explanation, we acknowledge that we
cannot draw any definitive conclusions from this study and more analysis is needed to determine
the extent to which a vPGS constructed from a cross-person GWAS captures within-person vQTL
effects.
Overall, with only 374 individuals in our treatment group, we acknowledge that we are
likely underpowered to detect precise G x E effects. This could in part explain why we are unable
to detect effects between treatment and control groups in the upper part of the vPGS distribution.
Specifically, because vPGS individuals display a higher within-person standard deviation in BMI,
it may be harder to detect differences between treatment and control groups in smaller samples
because their weight oscillates more between waves, independent of any particular treatment
effect, as mentioned above. Conversely, it’s possible that the true shape of the interaction does
not display a crossover effect at higher levels of the vPGS—perhaps because of the larger withinor between-person standard deviation in BMI. Either way, due to a lack of detailed job loss data
in other population studies that also collect genetic data on participants, we were unable to pursue

are suggestive, and further analysis that can leverage quasi-experimental variation is needed to
assess the validity of our approach.
Strengths and Limitations. There are several limitations of the HRS data, all of which may bias
our estimates downwards or reduce the precision of our estimates. First, we only observe BMI in
the HRS every two years, which makes it difficult to assess stress-related changes in BMI that are
more proximal to the timing of the event, or in the months immediately pre- and post-job loss. It
is entirely possible that high vPGS individuals gained or lost more weight than low vPGS
individuals in the months following a job loss but they bounced back quicker to their pre-job loss
weight than low vPGS individuals, which would make it more difficult to detect differences
between high vPGS treatment and control individuals in the subsequent HRS wave. Second, to
obtain the largest sample of treated individuals, we were limited to using self-reports of BMI,
which may induce measurement error in our estimates. In 2006, the HRS did start collecting in
person, objective measures of BMI; however, these measures are only collected at every other
wave, or every four years, and are not available for all treated individuals. Third, because the HRS
is a sample of older individuals who were genotyped in 2006, 2008, or 2010, our results may be
subject to mortality selection. To reduce the potential of mortality selection, we limited our
analyses to individuals born after 193061.
In addition, there is significant complexity surrounding obesity and aging such that
differences in BMI may not indicate an actual change in body fat. Higher BMI at midlife is a risk
factor for age-related disease and early mortality, however at older ages it might be somewhat
protective of mortality because age-related diseases and aging itself are wasting conditions that
stimulate significant weight loss. Therefore, while incrementally higher BMI in midlife is more
likely a measure of risk for disease, later in life it may actually signal the absence of disease. In

17
addition, individuals generally lose muscle mass with increasing chronological age, meaning older
individuals could maintain a constant BMI while simultaneously losing lean body mass and
gaining a greater portion of adiposity62. Thus, any increases in BMI from a job loss may be offset
by these other countervailing trends that are inherent to the aging process, which may in part be
another explanation the null findings we report for more plastic individuals in the top half of the
vPGS distribution. Furthermore, the relatively nominal findings we report may reflect a greater
culmination of environmental and lifestyle factors on adiposity in older adults that overwhelm any
genetic effects. The genomic influence on BMI has been shown to both weaken over the life
course and increase in magnitude since the current obesity epidemic began in the mid1980s55,58,59,63. While performing exact matching on survey year may in part account for
differences in the obesogenic environment across cohorts, our sample size of treated individuals is
too small to explore more detailed cohort analysis.
Finally, a significant limitation of this study is that were limited to conducting analyses in
individuals of European decent. We focus on individuals of European decent because comparable
GWAS in other ancestral populations are currently unavailable. Estimates from a European
ancestry GWAS are not necessarily accurate or valid in other ancestral populations, and PGSs
constructed from European ancestry GWAS summary statistics will not have the same predictive
power for individuals from other ancestral backgrounds64,65. Restricting our analysis to one
ancestral group is also important in that SNPs within regions of interest may tag different causal
variants if the underlying linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure varies across ancestral groups65,66.
Thus, we caution that PGSs constructed from European ancestry GWAS cannot be generalized to
other ancestral populations. On the environmental side, limiting our analysis to white HRS
respondents restricts the scope of potential job loss effects that we can observe. Race powerfully

shapes structural- and institutionally-derived differences in occupational sorting and occupational
opportunities across the life course67,68. For example, white HRS respondents were more likely to
work in higher status jobs with better working conditions than their Black counterparts69, and
following a job loss, they were more likely to be reemployed or have additional economic
resources to buffer stressful declines in income70–72, all of which may further bias effects from this
study downwards.
These limitations are counterbalanced by several strengths of our study. The use of a large,
nationally representative cohort of individuals from the same ancestry group is an advantage in
that it both increases our power to detect effects while also minimizing the presence of
ascertainment bias and other selection issues. Having access to detailed, longitudinal job loss data
in the HRS also allowed us to exploit a quasi-experimental research design that limited the
treatment group to individuals who lost their job due to a business closure while also creating a
control group that is matched on a rich suite of characteristics pre-job loss. Current G x E
interaction studies that utilize population data are often unable to separate gene-environment
correlation (rGE) from G x E effects, which limits our understanding of social-environmental
effects on health27. Finally, to our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to integrate genetic
measures that can separately capture phenotypic mean and variance effects into PGS x E
interaction analysis.
Conclusion. Control of phenotypic variability, both within and between individuals, is a
fundamental property of biological systems that impacts how species adapt to environmental
changes73–75. Incorporating vPGS measures into G x E interaction research may further our
understanding of how and to what extent environmental stimuli modify the distribution of
anthropomorphic traits in a population. In particular, sizable unemployment shocks from the Great

Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the importance of understanding the
short- and long-run health consequences of business cycles. Future studies that are able to observe
the biology underlying these types of large, social-environmental effects on physiological changes
that precede disease promises to inform new opportunities for effective intervention76.

Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data. The HRS is a nationally representative, longitudinal
panel study of individuals over the age of 50 and their spouses that is sponsored by the National
Institute on Aging (NIA U01AG009740) and conducted by the University of Michigan77,78.
Launched in 1992, the HRS introduces a new cohort of participants every six years and interviews
around 20,000 participants every two years. To maximize sample size, we compiled data from 13
waves (1992-2016). Information on job loss and smoking behavior was obtained from the 19922016 Public Use Core Files; demographic and socioeconomic data came from the RAND Data
File (version P).
Genotype data on ~15,000 HRS participants was collected from a random subset of the
~26,000 total participants that were selected to participate in enhanced face-to-face interviews and

saliva specimen collection for DNA in 2006, 2008, and 2010. We restricted our sample to
individuals of European ancestry who were between the ages of 50-70 who reported working parttime or full-time in the previous wave and who were not self-employed. The final sample consists
of 3,938 workers with 11,932 observations.
HRS genotyping and quality control. Genotyping was conducted by the Center for Inherited
Disease Research (CIDR) in 2011, 2012, and 2015 (RC2 AG0336495, RC4 AG039029). Full
quality control details can be found in the Quality Control Report79. Genotype data on over 15,000
HRS participants was obtained using the llumina HumanOmni2.5 BeadChips (HumanOmni2.54v1, HumanOmni2.5-8v1), which measures ~2.4 million SNPs. Genotyping quality control was
performed by the Genetics Coordinating Center at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA.
Individuals with missing call rates >2%, SNPs with call rates <98%, HWE p-value < 0.0001,
chromosomal anomalies, and first-degree relatives in the HRS were removed. Imputation to 1000G
Phase I v3 (released March 2012) was performed using SHAPEIT2 followed by IMPUTE2. The
worldwide reference panel of all 1,092 samples from the Phase I integrated variant set was used.
These imputation analyses were performed and documented by the Genetics Coordinating Center
at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA. All positions and names are aligned to build
GRCh37/hg19.
Principal component (PC) analysis was performed on a selected set of independent SNPs
to identify population group outliers and to provide sample eigenvectors as covariates in the
statistical model to adjust for possible population stratification and were provided by the HRS. The
European ancestry sample included all respondents that had PC loadings within ± one standard
deviations for eigenvectors one and two in the PC analysis of all unrelated study subjects and who
self-identified as White on survey data. A second set of principal components was then calculated

within the European ancestry sample to further account for any population stratification within the
sample. The genotype sample has been defined by the HRS and is available on dbGaP80.
Mean polygenic score (mPGS) construction. We calculated a linear mPGS for the HRS sample
based on a GWAS of 457,824 European ancestry individuals in the UK Biobank48. Imputed HRS
genotype data were accessed through dbGap (phs000428). The mPGS BMI score was constructed
in PRSice81 by taking a weighted sum across the number of SNPs (𝑛) of the number of reference
alleles 𝑥 (zero, one, or two) at that SNP multiplied by the effect size for that SNP (𝛽):

GWAS summary statistics were pruned for linkage disequilibrium (LD) using the clumping
procedure in PLINK (R2=0.1, range=1000kb)82,83. Since these GWAS summary statistics were
pre-clumped, no LD-clumping or p-value threshold was implemented in PRSice. After LD
clumping was applied, 90,326 SNPs were used to construct the BMI mPGS. The mPGS was
standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one for all analyses.
Construction of the variance polygenic score (vPGS). We calculated BMI vPGS for HRS
participants of European ancestry. SNP weights in the vPGS were based on dispersion effects
estimated in the UKB using the heteroskedastic linear mixed model (HLMM) approach16. Prepruned HLMM summary statistics were obtained from Young et al.16. We did not perform
additional LD-clumping or p-value thresholding to filter variants. A total of 242,870 SNPs
remained in the vPGS model after overlapping the HLMM summary statistics and HRS genotype
data. The vPGS was constructed in PRSice81 and standardized to have a mean of zero and a
standard deviation of one for all analyses.

Validation of the variance polygenic score (vPGS). Performance of the vPGS was assessed
using European ancestry UKB samples identified from genetic PCs (data field 22006). To avoid
overfitting, HRS samples were not used for model validation. Quality control procedures for the
UKB genetic data have been described elsewhere84. We excluded participants recommended by
UKB (data field 22010), those with conflicting genetically-inferred (data field 22001) and selfreported sex (data field 31), and those who withdrew from the study. We randomly apportioned
UKB participants (N=406,873) into training (N=325,498) and testing sets (N=81,375), with an 8020 split. We applied the HLMM approach to estimate the dispersion effect of each SNP on BMI
using samples in the training set, controlling for sex, age, age2, age3, age × sex, age2 × sex, age3
× sex, genotyping array, and the ﬁrst 40 genetic PCs. Following Young et al., we analyzed related
and unrelated samples in the training set separately and performed fixed-effect meta-analysis to
combine the results16. Related samples were inferred from genetic kinship (third-degree relatives
or higher; data field 22021). Random effects were included to account for genetic relatedness in
the analysis of related samples. We then pruned SNPs following Young et al. and used dispersion
effect estimates to generate vPGS for samples in the testing set.
We then fitted a Double Generalized Linear Model (DGLM) to associate the vPGS with
the between-individual BMI variance in testing samples85. The DGLM takes the form of
𝐵𝑀𝐼# = 𝛾( + 𝛾' 𝐺# + 𝑿𝒊 Θ + 𝜀# , 𝜀# ~𝑁(0, exp (𝛼( + 𝛼' 𝐺# + 𝑿𝒊 Φ)),
where 𝐵𝑀𝐼# denotes the inverse normal-transformed BMI of individual 𝑖 , 𝐺# is the vPGS of
individual 𝑖, 𝑿𝒊 is the vector of covariates including sex, age, age2, age3, age × sex, age2 × sex,
age3 × sex, genotyping array, and the ﬁrst 40 genetic principal components. Here, 𝛼' quantifies
the effect of vPGS on the variability of BMI and is the parameter of interest in this analysis. The

vPGS was standardized with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1. We fitted DGLM using the dglm
package86 in R.
To assess the performance of vPGS after adjusting for the effect of mPGS, we performed
a standard, mean-effect GWAS of BMI on the training set and used the effect estimates to generate
mPGS for the testing samples. GWAS summary statistics were pruned for LD using the clumping
procedure in PRSice (R2=0.1, range=250kb) when calculating the mPGS81. We then fitted the
same DGLM model as above with the mPGS added to the vector of covariates. The mPGS was
standardized with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.
Treatment and control groups. For each observation, we used information from two waves—
before and after treatment. Before treatment (t-2), all respondents were working for pay either
full- or part-time. At the following HRS interview two years later (t), respondents in the treatment
group report they were no longer working for their previous-wave employer. These respondents
were asked why they left their employer. Possible answers included ‘business closed’, ‘laid off/let
go’, ‘poor health/disabled’, ‘quit’ ‘family care’, ‘better job’, ‘retired’, ‘family moved’, ‘strike’,
‘divorce/separation’, ‘transportation/distance to work’, and ‘early retirement incentive/offer’.
Respondents could report up to three reasons. Our definition of exogenous job loss includes
observations that reported being laid off due to a business closure. We excluded workers who also
stated that they quit or left for health reasons but included workers who stated they were also laid
off or let go40. For the control group, we used individuals who reported working for the same
employer the entire time they were in the sample—i.e., we did not include individuals in the control
group if they ever quit their job or were laid off for any reason. Treated individuals are only in the
analytic sample for two waves, or pre- and post-job loss. Control individuals can be in the analytic
sample for multiple HRS waves. In the whole observation period, there were 374 instances of

involuntary job loss—i.e., our treatment group consisted of 374 workers who reported being laid
off due to a business closure. The control group consisted of 11,558 observations on 3,564
workers.
Difference-in-differences (DiD) approach. We used DiD estimation combined with
nonparametric kernel matching to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) by
genotype, or the change in BMI by genotype brought about by the job loss of those who actually
lost their job31,87. This approach compares individuals who have been laid off due to a business
closure with a group of similar individuals who are still working for their same employer. To
construct a control group with a similar distribution of covariates as the treatment group, the
kernel-based matching estimator uses a distance-weighted average of all propensity scores in the
control group to construct a counterfactual outcome for each individual in the treatment group.
These weights were applied to the DiD regression model to obtain a balanced sample of treated
and untreated individuals. The coefficients from the DiD regression were then used to estimate
the ATT by mPGS and vPGS.
A traditional DiD setting assumes that after conditioning on a vector of observables 𝑋, the
BMI of individuals in the treatment group would have evolved similarly over time to the BMI of
individuals in the control group if they had never been laid off:
𝐸[𝐵𝑀𝐼#* − 𝐵𝑀𝐼#*+, |𝑋, 𝐵𝐶 = 1] = 𝐸 [𝐵𝑀𝐼# ! * − 𝐵𝑀𝐼# ! *+, |𝑋, 𝐵𝐶 = 0]
Where 𝐵𝑀𝐼#* − 𝐵𝑀𝐼#*+, refers to the change in BMI before and after the treatment, BC denotes
the treatment group indicator (i.e., whether an individual lost their job due to a business closure),
and 𝑖 - denotes an individual in the control group with the same characteristics as individual 𝑖 in
the treatment group. While conditioning on genotype and a rich set of covariates minimizes the

25
possibility of violating this assumption, other systematic differences between the treated and
control groups may remain even after conditioning on observables.
To minimize potential confounding from unobservable characteristics, we used the weights
from propensity score matching (W) to reduce unmeasured differences between the treatment and
control groups that could bias estimates:
𝐸 [𝐵𝑀𝐼#* − 𝐵𝑀𝐼#*+, |𝑊(𝑋), 𝐵𝐶 = 1] = 𝐸 [𝐵𝑀𝐼# ! * − 𝐵𝑀𝐼# ! *+, |𝑊(𝑋), 𝐵𝐶 = 0]
Covariates used to estimate the propensity score, or the probability of treatment, were also
included in the DiD regression model. Thus, coefficients from the regression-adjusted
semiparametric DiD matching estimator are considered “doubly robust” because the estimator is
consistent if the regression model or the propensity score model is correctly specified88,89. As a
result, the DiD matching estimator accounts for selection on observable and unobservable
variables with time invariant effects, or the model allows for systematic differences between
treatment and control groups even after conditioning on observables90.
Difference-in-differences (DiD) empirical strategy. Our empirical strategy can be broken down
into three parts. First, we estimated propensity scores using a probit regression that regresses
business closures on the mPGS and vPGS, as well as a rich set of covariates that are both standard
in the job loss literature and satisfy the conditional independence assumption—i.e. they influence
job loss and/or changes in BMI87,91. In addition, we only conditioned on observables that were
unaffected by job loss (or the anticipation of it), or variables that were either fixed over time or
measured in t-2

. A complete list of covariates can be found in Supplementary Table 1. To

avoid losing observations with missing information on a covariate, we set missing values equal to
zero and included an additional dichotomous variable that is equal to one if the observation is

26
missing. As a result, matching is not only on observed values but also on the missing data
pattern31,92. Throughout, we restricted our analysis to the region of common support, or the subset
of individuals in the control group that were comparable to individuals in the treatment group91.
Specifically, we dropped treatment observations whose propensity score was greater than the
maximum or less than the minimum propensity score of the controls.
We used the estimates from the probit regression to compute the weights for the control
group with kernel matching, a nonparametric matching estimator that uses the weighted averages
of all observations on common support to construct the counterfactual outcome87,90. Specifically,
the weight given to a non-treated individual 𝑗 was in proportion to the closeness of their
observables to treated individual 𝑖:

𝑤(𝑖, 𝑗) =

𝐾[(𝑃$ − 𝑃# )⁄𝑏]
∑.∈0"&( 𝐾[(𝑃. − 𝑃# )⁄𝑏]

Where 𝑃 is the propensity score for individual 𝑖 or 𝑗 in the treated or control group,
respectively, 𝐾[⋅] is the kernel function, and 𝑏 is the bandwidth parameter. We used the program
psmatch293 in Stata 14 to compute 𝑤(𝑖, 𝑗) with the Epanechnikov kernel function and a bandwidth
of 0.0687. In addition, when computing the weights, we performed exact matching on survey year
and sex in t-2. This ensured 1) individuals who were laid off were matched with controls from the
same time period, and 2) treated individuals were grouped with same-sex non-treated individuals.
In the final step, we incorporated the weights from propensity score matching into the DiD
regression model:
𝐵𝑀𝐼#* = 𝛼 + 𝜆𝐵𝐶#*+, + 𝜙𝑚𝑃𝐺𝑆# + 𝜗𝐵𝐶#*+, × 𝑚𝑃𝐺𝑆# + 𝜃𝑣𝑃𝐺𝑆# + 𝛿𝐵𝐶#*+' × 𝑣𝑃𝐺𝑆#

Where BC is an indicator for job loss due to a business closing in the years between HRS
survey waves, or between t-2 and t for individual 𝑖, 𝑿 is a vector of observable time invariant and
variant covariates measured at t-2, including the first 10 principal components of the genetic data.
We also include 𝐵𝑀𝐼*+, to control for baseline BMI, or to estimate deviations in BMI between t2 and t. All regressions were estimated with robust standard errors.
Estimating average treatment effects by genotype.

Estimated parameters from the DiD

regression model were used to estimate the conditional mean or predicted BMI for treated and
untreated individuals at various values of the mPGS and vPGS (Figure 1). For example, the BMI
for treated (BC=1) and untreated (BC=0) individuals with hypothetical mPGS and vPGS values at
0 and 1, respectively, would be estimated as follows:
𝐸 [𝐵𝑀𝐼* |𝑊(𝑋), 𝐵𝐶 = 1, 𝑣𝑃𝐺𝑆 = 1, 𝑚𝑃𝐺𝑆 = 1] = 𝜆 + 𝜙 + 𝜗 + 𝜃 + 𝛿 + 𝜏 + 𝑋*+, 𝛽
𝐸 [𝐵𝑀𝐼* |𝑊(𝑋), 𝐵𝐶 = 0, 𝑣𝑃𝐺𝑆 = 1, 𝑚𝑃𝐺𝑆 = 1] = 𝜙 + 𝜃 + 𝜏 + 𝑋*+, 𝛽
𝐸 [𝐵𝑀𝐼* |𝑊(𝑋), 𝐵𝐶 = 1, 𝑣𝑃𝐺𝑆 = 0, 𝑚𝑃𝐺𝑆 = 0] = 𝜆 + 𝜏 + 𝑋*+, 𝛽
𝐸 [𝐵𝑀𝐼* |𝑊(𝑋), 𝐵𝐶 = 0, 𝑣𝑃𝐺𝑆 = 0, 𝑚𝑃𝐺𝑆 = 0] = 𝜏 + 𝑋*+, 𝛽
From here, the ATT can be estimated by taking the difference in 𝐸[𝐵𝑀𝐼* |𝑊(𝑋)] between treated
and non-treated individuals with the same mPGS and vPGS values:
𝐴𝑇𝑇3456&',.456&' = 𝐸 [𝐵𝑀𝐼* |𝑊(𝑋), 𝐵𝐶 = 1] − 𝐸 [𝐵𝑀𝐼* |𝑊(𝑋), 𝐵𝐶 = 0] = 𝜆 + 𝜗 + 𝛿

Event time study analysis. We estimated an event time study (ETS) model for individuals in the
top and bottom 50% of the vPGS distribution using the following specification:

This model is similar to the DiD model outlined above except the business closure term is replaced
by a series of event terms that are the product of indicators for each HRS survey year (𝑦) relative
to the survey year the respondent reported a job loss 𝑡#∗ , 𝐼(𝑡 − 𝑡#∗ = 𝑦), and their treatment status
(𝐵𝐶# ). The omitted category is the survey year prior to treatment (𝑦 ≠ −2). We also present ETS
results for the full sample that includes controls for the vPGS. Each estimate of 𝜆8 gives the
difference in BMI for treated individuals compared to non-treated individuals relative to this
excluded year. If outcomes were evolving similarly for treated and untreated individuals prior to
a business closure, the coefficient estimates for 𝑦 < 0 should be close to zero and not statistically
significant.
