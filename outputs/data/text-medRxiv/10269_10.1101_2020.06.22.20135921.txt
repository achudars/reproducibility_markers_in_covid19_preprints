Abstract

We study in this work the temporal evolution of local and global
contaminated population by coronavirus. We access those information
analytically and numerically using a logistic model. It is shown, using
diferent data from The Brazilian Ministry of Health (MS), The World
Health Organization - WHO, and The Niteroi Health Foundation (FMS),
the contaminated population ramping-up curves, the population
inflection, the population saturation - plateau regime, and also the time
related to these population evolution regimes. Based on the simulations,
approaches are proposed at this more advanced phase of the pandemic,
which might generate effectiveness at the actions of society in general,
in a way that those actions could generate effective and efficient results,
and this means a more organized war against this pandemic, a better way

Introduction
By May 21, 18,894 deaths were registered in Brazil, 293,357 confirmed cases of
contamination and 116,683 recovered from COVID -19. On June 11, less than 1 month
later, according to the National Council of Secretaries (Conass) and the Ministry of
Health(MS), there are already 40,919 deaths, 802,828 confirmed cases, and 345,595
recovered and 465,740 deaths. Today, june 22, according to the World Health
Organization (www.who.int) the world number is 8,860,331 contaminated, and to Brazil
according to MS (covid.saude.gov.br) it is 1,085,038 contaminated, 50,617 deaths,
516.3 contaminated per 100,000 ihabitants, mortality 24.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, 641
new cases, and letality 4.7%.
The important question to ask ourselves is: what is the real formation law for the
temporal evolution function of the contamination density to ramp-up, to achieve the
plateau regima and eventually to ramp-down? How to study access this function in
order to take efficient and effective measures to guarantee the maximum action
effectiveness to face this world public health crisis?

Numerous articles have been written showing predictions about contamination by the
corona virus, in scientific journals or on news sites (1 - 5). Many of those predictions did
not materialize, some overestimated and others underestimated the related numbers
and functions, some others came closer to the real curve and figures, depending on the
complexity of the model used or the epidemiological knowledge of the subject.
However, the numerology in this coronavirus scenario is still a problem open to
investigation and if any additional light is shed on this topic that everyone is interested
in, it can still save lives and reduce the suffering of many families. It is clear that the
world needs to be highly effective in coping with this health and later economic crisis.
Analyzing the recent data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MS) and the “World
Health Organization (WHO)” (6), it is very clear that, in the absence of an effective
vaccine to contain the COVID-19, social isolation is still the best weapon to face this
pandemic surge, even in its most advanced stage. Studies show that social isolation is
really the most effective measure to contain the advance and possible new
contamination hubs (7), as now in China and in other parts of the globe. The social
isolation tis effective when done in an organized way, considering all the social
parameters involved as economic, psychological, and other relevant ones.
Intelligent control can unlock the economy and still preserving lives at the same time. Is
there, then, a mathematical foundation in this scenario to ensure that social isolation is
in fact a good decision to avoid a high number of unnecessary deaths, even after
saturation or peak? Does this model give indications of how social isolation can become
less rigid, but without a severe loss of lives? In this work, an logistic analytical model
and numerical simulations are presented, simple to understand, which will show the
importance of social isolation, until the viral field dissipates to a “noise level”. This
dissipation can be induced by a vaccine or by other related means, therefor avoiding
contamination surges and hubs resulting from the relaxation of the containment
measures which could cause new waves of inevitable deaths (second wave) (8).

Mathematical Models for Population Dynamics
1. Exponential Growth
Let 𝑁 𝑡 be the population of a given specie (viruses, bacteria’s, contaminated people,
or any other type) over time. The most elementary hypothesis regarding the variation of
the population 𝑁 𝑡 over time is that its rate of change is proportional to its own value at
time t, that is (9),
𝑑𝑁 𝑡
= 𝑎𝑁 𝑡 ,
𝑑𝑡
(1)
where the proportionality constant a is called the base rate for population growth or
decline, depending on its sign, since it can be positive or negative, and t is time (hours,
days, weeks, months, or other convenient time unit). The choice of the convenient time
unit depends on the problem under consideration. Equation (1) can only be solved
completely if we know the population value at 𝑡 = 0 (when the timer is turned on), that
is,
𝑁 𝑡 = 0 = 𝑁! ,
(2)

Where 𝑁! is a problem known/given value. For this reason the system of equations (1)
and (2) is called the initial value problem. Note that the choice of 𝑡 = 0 is conventional,
we can choose 𝑡 = 0 at any position on the time scale that would be convenient for our
problem, as long as the population is known at this time. Therefore, as said above, the
population at 𝑡 = 0, is a known information and has the value 𝑁! , which is nothing less
than the initial value of the number of elements in the study: people, viruses, bacterias,
animals, contaminated people, and so on. Assuming that we are studying the growth
and not the death of the target population, that is, considering a positive, it is obtained
as a solution to the problem (by integrating equation 10) (9),

𝑁 𝑡 = 𝑁! 𝑒 !" ,
(3)
where 𝑒 = 2,718 … is the basis for the Neperian logarithms, created by the Scottish
mathematician John Napier. Equation (3) from the proposed model, predicts that the
population will grow exponentially over time without restriction. This is exactly the
increase in the number of contaminants that we have seen in the case of Brazil and the
world at the initial course of the pandemic, with a sign of saturation in some countries,
and decrease in others, and an inflection of the curve in others. This exponential model
does not serve to model situations where 𝑁 𝑡 is already at the inflection phase, or
saturation.
The exponential growth occurs in the initial phase of contamination, but also for longer
times (as we see in the case of Brazil), when social isolation measures are not
respected or not well managed and the number of contaminated people in contact with
the healthy population is very large, and therefore generating a contamination rate
much higher than expected, and worse without any reducing factor for the curve to
stabilize. However, this type of growth does not occur indefinitely for obvious reasons,
at some point it will saturate in a small or large time interval, depending on the load
capacity of the system. Even considering the population of the country as a whole at
some point the curve saturates, but in this case the number of contaminants would be
astronomical - a large percentage of the system. The system tends to stabilize, because
in a population of human beings or animals there is always a lack of food for everyone,
for example, generating conflicts, wars, and diseases, so growth would start to decline,
would be limited by factors not considered in the simple ideal exponential model. In any
case, the number of contaminated people will eventually stabilize (with several deaths
of course) by the so-called herd immunity effect (10).
Any population system has a carrying capacity, that is, any pandemic ends at some
point, an extinction of that pandemic load depends on factors such as possible harmful
mutations in the virus that affect its ability to reproduce and / or infect more people [in

fact, recent studies by Hyeryun Choe of the Department of Immunology and
Microbiology at Scripts Research, Florida Campus, noted that there were changes in
the number of viruses increased in the number of “spikes”(Peplômeros – in general
glycoproteins and lipids) that are actually true pointed in its crown (surface of the viral
envelope of the viral separations), this allows in a greater deal the connection of viruses
with the invaded cells], vaccines, herd immunity, and the reduction of the virus capacity
to reproduce itself.
For short periods of time, or under extremely abundant resources, the exponential
model presented works well, which is not the case in general. To study populations with
growth restrictions, equation (1) is no longer valid. However, there is another model that
can be used to this type of scenario called logistic model. In this model populations
have regulations that depend on their own density, so it is necessary to adjust the
previous model to take into account the density dependence in the evolution of the
system (11).
Basically, any type of resource important for the survival of species is able to act as a
system limiter, then generating competition between species in the system. Verhulst
(Pierre François Verhulst - 1838) (11), derived the logistic equation to study the self limiting growth of a population. In the Verhust model, the reproduction rate is
proportional to both the existing population and the amount of available resources,
everything else is considered constant (the parameters of the problem can be estimated
by non-linear regression). In this way of looking at the problem, the population tends
asymptotically to a saturation value (carrying capacity of the system).
The logistic function (SIGMOIDE) which is the solution to the logistic equation, is the
inverse to the natural LOGIT function, it can also be used to convert the logarithm of
chances into a probability. The logistic function is the solution of a first order non-linear
differential equation (11, 12, 19). In this new model, populations have regulations that
depend on their own densities, so it is necessary to adjust the previous model to take
into account the dependence of density on the evolution of the system. This

dependence can be better understood by the figure below, which shows how the
population increase depletes the natural resources of the ecosystem in question. For
the containment of the virus this is very good, because if little by little it has no one to
infect the pandemic loses its strength.

Figure 1. Scheme of population variation x Ecosystem resources.

2. Logistic Growth
In the logistic model, it is considered that the rate of temporal growth of the population
depends on this same population at the time of the measurement (that is, the real
population is considered, with the reduction induced by the growth restrictions, at time
t). The equation that models this possible population scenario is called, as seen above,
Verhulst's equation. Equation (1) can now be written as (12, 13, 14):
𝑑𝑁(𝑡)
=𝑎 𝑡 𝑁 𝑡 .
𝑑𝑡
(4)
The term 𝑎 𝑡 , in general, is a complicated function of t, in the case of more complex
population dynamics, from the dynamic point of view. If we consider 𝑎 𝑡 = 𝑎 (constant).
Equation (4) is reduced to the case of exponential growth previously studied.

In the logistic model, the population control function 𝑎 𝑡 is considered as follows (law
of variation): 𝑎 𝑡 = 𝑎 − 𝑏𝑁 𝑡 , with a constant. This is still a simplified model of a(t), it is
considered that population growth, limited by the term 𝑏𝑁 𝑡 , is no longer uniformly
increasing over time. However, an inflection in the curve is expected at some time in the
course of the evolution of the system (that is, as 𝑏𝑁 𝑡 grows in relation to the term a).
Thus equation (4) can be written as:
𝑑𝑁(𝑡)
= 𝑎𝑁 𝑡 − 𝑏𝑁²(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡
(5)
In equation (5), the initial growth is free and dominated by the first term 𝑎𝑁 𝑡 . The rate
a represents the proportional increase in population 𝑁 𝑡 over time, in a conveniently
chosen time unit. In our case t will be measured in months. As the population grows
over time, the second term, −𝑏𝑁² 𝑡 , also grows, as members of the 𝑁 𝑡 population
strat to interfere with each other, competing for critical system resources, such as food,
!

medicine, and territory, or people to infect in our case. This ! antagonistic effect is called
“bottleneck”, it is modeled by the value of the population saturation parameter. The
competition in the population decreases the combined rate of growth, until the value of
𝑁 𝑡 stops growing over time, thus reaching the so-called maturity of the population 𝑁!"#
(called the saturation value of 𝑁 𝑡 , where 𝑁 𝑡 no longer grows over time).
This ordinary non-linear differential equation is, fortunately, the famous Ricatti equation
with solution easily to be obtained. It is given by (12):

𝑁 𝑡 =

𝑁!"#
,
𝑎
1+
− 1 𝑒 !!"
𝑏𝑁!
(6)

Where 𝑁! is the value of 𝑁 𝑡 at 𝑡 = 0.

It can be seen that equation (6) is slightly different from the exponential evolution (3).
Equation (6) clearly indicates the need to avoid new contagions so that an inflection
point occurs in 𝑁 𝑡

and a therefore a saturation level. After that, we expect the

subsequent time decrease in the contaminated population. In order to have that, the
model shows that the most effective way to contain a high rate of contamination of the
healthy population and obtain a quick inflection is via quarantine/social isolation, strict
epidemiological control, and produce a vaccine as soon as possible. This is to avoiding
overloading country's health system. The b parameter clearly points to the direction of a
real social isolation. Effective quarantine /social isolation and strict personal protection
for healthy, sick, or asymptomatic people seems to be a good strategic decision,
supported mathematically by the above model.
Smaller

− 1 , faster the system saturates and fewer people die. This occurs if

𝑎 ≪ 𝑏𝑁 𝑡 , where 𝑏 is a parameter that "models" the lack of healthy people (in the
sense of not having had the virus yet) to be contaminated, and the virus's inability to
reproduce effectively (15,16). At this current phase of relaxation of social isolation
measures, the two concepts presented below are important.
In the case of the coronavirus, there are several doubts on the possible recontamination
processes, distance of the virus's effective kinetic propagation through the circulating air
(is there any air runaway virus/droplet’s due to some runaway air molecules?), virus life
time on surfaces (fomites), and other related subjects. When there is doubt about an
unknown thread, we should not neglect the risk, one should always use the well-known
“precautionary principle”. The precautionary principle states that the burden of proof of
potentially dangerous actions by industry or the government rests on ensuring safety
and that, when there are threats of serious harm, scientific uncertainty must be resolved
in favor of prevention (17). For those who are professional or not, who need to expose
themselves to a known or even unknown risk, they can also use the “ALARA” principle
that takes into account the exposure time, the distance from the source, and the
shielding. Would its use be different for exposure to global biological risks (18)?

In equation (6), the growth speed decreases with time as 𝑏𝑁 𝑡

grows over time, that

is, at the beginning, we have 𝑎 ≫ 𝑏𝑁 𝑡 and the growth is of exponential type. As 𝑏𝑁² 𝑡
increases and 𝑎 − 𝑏𝑁 𝑡 decreases, the exponential starts to be attenuated until the
curve undergoes an inflection, which will occur at 𝑁 𝑡 = 𝑡!"# . At this point, where
𝑁 𝑡 = 𝑁(𝑡 = 𝑡!"# ), it is the exact instant where the curve that models 𝑁 𝑡 undergoes
an inflection, from there it grows with a tendency to saturate at 𝑡!"# , where 𝑡!"# is the
exact moment when the curve starts the saturation process. From the logistic model it is
known that 𝑁!"# = 𝑁!"# /2.
Mathematically, it is not very trick to find the inflection points or critical points of a curve,
it is enough to cancel the second derivative of the function that describes this curve.
However, if it does not cancel out and it is positive, the curve has a positive concavity
(facing upwards) and if it is negative it has a negative concavity (facing downwards). As
well known inflection point separates the positive from the negative concavity in a curve.
From the inflection point, the population density solution, solution curve of the logistic
equation, inverts its position (or sign, from positive to negative), until eventually
saturates at the population density 𝑁(𝑡 = 𝑡!"# ) = 𝑁!"# 𝑡 = 𝑁!"# (𝑡 = ∞). The saturation
density can be obtained by the equality 𝑎 = 𝑏𝑁(𝑡 = 𝑡!"# ), this implies that equation (5)
has

!"

= 0, which means that 𝑁(𝑡) is constant for any subsequent 𝑡.

After saturation, the curve can only remain at this level or decrease over time, which
would be the natural trend under normal conditions, and it is what is expected from the
number of people infected by the coronavirus. Since 𝑏 = 𝑎/𝑁!"# ,, we have that the
temporal evolution of the contaminated population is given by (logistic equation):

As can be seen, the logistic equation (7) contains four parameters, namely: 𝑁! , 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑁!"# .
The initial density 𝑁! as already seen is a known information of the problem, the rest of
the parameters can be determined precisely by regression analysis (19, 20). The
logistical approach is not linear, so care must be taken when choosing the starting
parameters. However, there is a simpler way to obtain those parameters, to write the
logistic equation with all the parameters explicit, and for that it is enough to know three
equidistant values of N(t), which in this study is a public and trivial data to be found (19,
20). For the calculation of the parameters 𝑁!"# , 𝑞 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎, of equation (7), we use the
model presented in (19, 20), where:

model this work were taken from the referenced sites (26 - 28).

Discussion
A numerical analysis of the problem was carried out based on the above analytical
mathematical model where the equation parameters are obtained using the approach
described in references (7) - (11). We consider the cities of Niterói (Rio de Janeiro
State) and Rio de Janeiro, but also Brazil, United States, and the world as a whole. The
objective was to evaluate the scenario from micro to macro to try to understand in a
more clear way the pattern of evolution of N(t). As time scale, we have considered the
month of march as ground zero. Thus, in figures 1-5, on the abscissa axis, we have t =
0 = march (beginning of time) and t = 4 = July (final). However, the model allows
extrapolations to be made for the months following July. Graphs of the population
density of contaminated N(t) were produced over time and their derivatives, up to the
third derivative, with the objective to studying the inflection at the growth rate of the
curve and to check the critical points of 𝑁(𝑡) and

used to show inflections in the 𝑁(𝑡)

curves. Those critical points show us the time and the density at which

inflections in the population and at the contamination rate contamination occur. This
type of study clearly describes where and when the contamination rate changes, from
increasing to decreasing, this via the first derivative of 𝑁 𝑡 .
The absolute numerical values shown in the graphs depend on the accuracy of the
official information on the number of contaminated and on those who can be
contaminated (population background of healthy people). In other words, our numbers
may be underestimated by a factor (but not by orders), for this reason we created in our
numerical model a data correction parameter when to adjust the parameters values is
necessary. There is information in the media that this factor can be up to/higher than 12
times the reported values, however our simulations indicates that if this is the case, the
number of contaminated people would be absurd, greater than the world contaminated
number. According to the results calculated by the mathematical model used, a
reasonable underreporting factor can be between 50% and 150%. In fact, simply
multiply 𝑁! , 𝑁! 𝑒 𝑁! by a fiiting parameter, 𝑆𝑁! , 𝑆𝑁! 𝑒 𝑆𝑁! , adjusting them for the “correct”

%𝑁! 𝑒 𝑆𝑁! = %𝑁! .
Figures 2-6 show N(t) that describes the temporal evolution of the number of infected
people, and their derivatives that describe the critical points of the curve are also
presented. Figure 1 shows the cases of Rio de Janeiro city and Niterói city. For Rio de
Janeiro city, the numbers foreseen is of the order of 100,000 contaminated people, at
the saturation level, it seems that we are slowly going through the inflection of the curve
(with some overshooting). The saturation for the case of Rio de Janeiro, predicted by
the model is for July or even August if there is a negligence in the containment /
contingency measures. If the real measure exceeds 100 thousand, there were certainly
under-notifications for 𝑁! , 𝑁! 𝑒 𝑁! .
For Niterói, the simulation shows a plateau regime close to june, with 800 contaminated.
However, the real number for the contaminated population is higher by a factor, indeed
4,327 contaminated in june 22 (covid.saude.gov.br). Later in july/august the real data
will be even higher, by close an order of magnitude considering the value of our actual
simulation. A simulation understimation by a factor (or by one order of magnitude) is
very reasonable in this scenario, if we take into consideration that The OMS considers
the data in Brazil underestimated, due to the low test rate. Health related personal
consider that Brazil is testing much less than it should by at least one order of
magnitude.
Since the rate of testing is improving with time, If we correct the simulation input data by
one order of magnitude, the curve might be considered just fine at the real time of
measure, for the logistic model used here.
The same discussion is valid for Rio de Janeiro city.
In Figures 2-6, the first derivatives show the exact moment when the slowdown of the

the zero value) the moment when the inflection of N(t) begins, and also the changes in

has two inflection points, one

close to t = 1 and the other close to t = 2.2.
The concavity starts upwards, then inverts after the first inflection point and inverts
again at the second inflection point, clearly showing that the contamination growth rate
increases, reaches the maximum and then decreases with time. It is not possible yet to
see this effect on N(t), this because this is not a linear effect. In other words, 𝑁(𝑡) still
seems saturated, but the contamination rates are on a downward trend, later afterwards
this effect will indeed impact N(t) in a measurable way, and it will start to fall in time in a
visible way.
Note that 𝑁(𝑡) has an inflection point due to the nature of the logistics curve, but its first
derivative, which models the rate of change of the population without time, has two
inflection points, showing an increase and decrease in the rates. Also, due to the nature
of the logistic model used here, we cannot model the decreasing phase of 𝑁(𝑡), we just
know it will happen naturally after saturation, if a second wave does not occur.

Conclusion
Based on the mathematical model proposed in this work, it can be seen that to reduce
the number of contaminated people per unit of time, it is necessary that the factor
𝑏𝑁(𝑡), in equation 3, to be increased in time, this is only possible with the death of the
population little by little, an effective vaccine, or with quarantine/social isolation. If the
social isolation is done with prevention so that the aerial contamination is contained and
the fomites as well. Just counting on the reduction of the amount of contaminated
people per unit of time leaving the system free as the Swedish model of herd
immunization, it seems that it has so far been inefficient, and has led to the death of a
large number of infected people. At the moment, without a vaccine to contain the
COVID-19, the most “antiviral” tool possible under our absolute control is not giving the
virus the opportunity to reproduce itself with severe hygiene measures and social
isolation. In the case of contamination, what remains is to seek specialized and
competent medical help immediately, avoiding the transmission of the virus to other
people and worsening its personal situation.
In this study, parameter b (impact parameter between elements of the target population
with unit of measure 1/dim (𝑡𝑁(𝑡)), measures how the reduction in the contaminated
population impacts the contamination of new elements of the public. This parameter that
for reasons of simplification was considered constant in time, in real life it also depends
on time, it increases as the number of people to be infected decreases, that is, if 𝑁(𝑡),
decreases with time 𝑏(𝑡), increases.
This study only considered one population, but we know that in fact there are more than
one interacting group, we could consider for instance: non-contaminated population,
non-isolated

and

government contingency actions.
If we consider two populations where one is the predator, the correct model to use
would be the Volterra predator - prey model. If there are limitations, the predator-prey
with a limitation term applies, as in the logistical case (which is a model for just one

population). If there are three interacting populations, then the dynastic model (super
predator, predator, prey) must be used. In the case of predator-prey there is the
possibility of ecological balance, this type of balance must be avoided at all costs, and
this is the “least” nonlinear case possible for population dynamics of coupled
populations (12).
To understand better who the populations would be in those cases, it can be said that in
the dynamics of the predator-prey, one can consider government actions (or number of
contaminants that the government effectively serves and leaves the system - via
hospitals , doctors, nurses ....) and the number of contaminated. If the government does
not apply serious and competent policies, this system can go into an ecological balance,
that is, if the number of contaminated people falls, the government relaxes, the number
of contaminated people grows, and so the government intensifies again its actions, and
for this reason the number of contaminants decreases again, the government relaxes
again, and so it goes over time forever, this is a true ecological balance between of the
government actions and the number of contaminated people (and us). In the dynastic
case, there are three populations, the super predator, is the government, the predator
might be the uncontaminated society, and the “prey” the contaminated subjects, but
depending on what one wants to study, the predator population can change the position
to be prey and vice versa, but in any case, chaos and bifurcations can occur in this type
of population dynamics, as in the climate, whose forecast depends dramatically on the
initial conditions (21). For this reason, caution should be at hand when to make
predictions about how the society will be like at the end of this pandemic time (21-23).
Many effects “foreign” to the expected normality occur in the population dynamics, such
as the so-called “population irruption” or a sudden and impetuous action of elements of
the population in such a way that it exceeds (“overshoots”) the load capacity of the
system, causing a change in this capacity and forcing the system to stabilize at another
level, if not before causing irreversible or long-term damage to the ecosystem in which
this population is inserted. The population can also, after the "overshooting", present
damped and non-damped oscillations in the vicinity of the system's carrying capacity.

In other words, the number of contaminated people can fluctuate in the region of the
carrying capacity, depending on the environment in which the population is inserted. In
this case, it would be an anomalous contamination to the carrying capacity of the
healthy population to sustain the action and spread of the virus.
Mathematical modeling indicates that the greater the social isolation, the reduced the
non-linearities in the system. The primary role of the government, if there is a drastic
reduction in the circulation of people, is to have the competence to lead the country's
economy, avoiding the economic collapse, we know that the world system is closed and
there is always “self-organization” in every non-linear system, the world economic
system as such will certainly have a “self-organization” and the flow of capital and
goods will take its course, but it will continue to flow as in the past, maybe at a different
path. If there is social isolation for those who have no real need to move, those who
have this need may keep part of the economy spinning but with physical and biological
security, so as not to fall ill when sacrificing for others (24, 25).
Finally, it is worth mentioning that there are numerous methods used to study the
dynamics of population growth, stabilization, and reduction / death. Some of these
methods are: a - arithmetic model, b - geometric / exponential model, c - multiplicative
regression, d - decreasing growth rate, in addition to the logistics studied in this work.
The choice of the logistic model is due to the fact that the arithmetic, exponential, and
geometric growth rates are not limited by the saturation density (𝑁!"# ) obtained with the
logistic model. The geometric, exponential, and linear rates approximate the problem
reasonably well until the inflection or a little earlier, but they depart from the logistic rate
close to the inflection region of the inflection, therefore these methods provide incorrect
results after inflection and do not show saturation, as 𝑁!"# obtained with the logistic
model, which is the simplest model that describes the problem in a very acceptable way
(19).
