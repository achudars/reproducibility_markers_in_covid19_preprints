Abstract

9

Background: The corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a serious

10

public health risk. Compared with conventional high-resolution CT (C-HRCT, matrix 512),

11

ultra-high resolution CT (U-HRCT, matrix 1024) can increase the effective pixel per unit

12

volume by about 4 times. Our study is to evaluate the value of target reconstruction of U-

13

HRCT in the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19.

14

Methods: A total of 13 COVID-19 cases, 44 cases of other pneumonias, and 6 cases of

15

ground-glass nodules were retrospectively analyzed. The data were categorized into groups

16

A (C-HRCT) and B (U-HRCT), following which iDose4-3 and iDose4-5 were used for target

17

reconstruction, respectively. CT value, noise, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in different

18

reconstructed images were measured. Two senior imaging doctors scored the image quality

19

and the structure of the lesions on a 5-point scale. Chi-square test, variance analysis, and

20

binarylogistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis.

21

Results: U-HRCT image can reduce noise and improve SNR with an increase of the iterative

22

reconstruction level. The SNR of U-HRCT image was lower than that of the C-HRCT image

23

of the same iDose4level, and the noise of U-HRCT was higher than that of C-HRCT image;

24

the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed

25

thatperipleural distribution, thickening of blood vessels and interlobular septum, and crazy-

26

paving pattern were independent indictors of the COVID-19 on U-HRCT. U-HRCT was

27

superior to C-HRCT in showing the blood vessels, bronchial wall, and interlobular septum in

28

the ground-glass opacities; the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05).

29

Conclusions:Peripleural distribution, thickening of blood vessels and interlobular septum,

30

and crazy-paving pattern on U-HRCT are favorable signs for COVID-19. U-HRCT is

31

superior to C-HRCT in displaying the blood vessels, bronchial walls, and interlobular

32

septum for evaluating COVID-19.

Background

36

The outbreak of the novel corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory

37

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide[1]. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a

38

serious public health risk. COVID-19 is characterized by high infectivity and a typical clinical features[2].

39

The diagnosis of COVID-19 relied on virus nucleic acid detection with a high false negative rate [3].

40

High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is a convenient and accessible method for early

41

screening and diagnosis of viral pneumonia [4]. Typical chest HRCT findings for COVID-19 included the

42

ground glass lesions, enlarged blood vessels and “crazy paving signs” [5].

43

Compared with conventional high-resolution CT (C-HRCT, with matrix of 512×512), ultra-high

44

resolution CT (U-HRCT, with matrix of 1024×1024) can increase the effective pixel per unit volume by

45

about 4 times in the same field of view (FOV) [6]. The UHRCT can not only reveal each ground glass lesion

46

with sub-millimeter precision, but also quantify the extent and severity of each lesion[7,8].

47

Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of U-HRCT in the quantitative assessment of

48

COVID-19 and to compare the radiological patterns of U-HRCT and C-HRCT.

49

Methods

50

Patients

51

The study conducted a retrospective analysis of 63 suspected COVID-19 patients examined using CT at our

52

hospital between January 22 and February 15, 2020. The patients included 35 males and 28 females aged

53

between 6–69 years, with an average age of (35 ± 10.6) years. Among them, 13 cases were confirmed as

54

COVID-19, 44 cases were diagnosed with other pneumonias, and 6 cases were diagnosed with ground-glass

55

opacities.

56

CT scans

57

The Ingenuity CT scanner (Philips Healthcare, the Netherlands) was used. The patient was placed in a

58

supine position with breath hold during the scan. The scanning range was from the apex to the base of the

59

lung. Scanning parameters included the following: tube voltage120 kV; mAs: DoseRight Index 15–20;

60

collimation64 × 0.625 mm; pitch, 1.2; slice thickness 2 mm; interval 2 mm; FOV 35 cm. The raw data

61

acquired were categorized into groups A (512 matrix) and B (1024 matrix). Each group was reconstructed

62

using iDose4-3 and iDose4-5 iterative reconstructions within the same small FOV with a slice thickness and

63

interval of 1 mm.

64

Image analysis

65

Analysis of typical signs

67

radiologists with over 10 years of experience while blinded to each other’s results. The assessment of lesions

68

included the following: (1) distribution (distance from the pleura); (2) number(single or multiple); (3)

69

density (pure ground-glass opacities, mixed ground-glass opacities, and consolidation); and (4) Internal

70

structure (air bronchograms sign, vascular thickening, interlobular septal thickening, and crazy-paving

71

patterns in the lesions).

72

Objective scoring of image quality

73

Each group of images was transferred to the Philips IntelliSpace Portal workstation. The relevant

74

information was locked, and the iDose3 and iDose5 groups of images were reconstructed, measured, and

75

evaluated in the fixed lung window (window width 1600 HU, window level -600 HU). A region of interest

76

(ROI) (50 mm2 approximate area) in the lung tissue at the level of the tracheal carina and left atrium was

77

selected (avoiding lung markings and lesion areas), the standard deviation (SD) was measured, and the

78

average CT value was recorded to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Each ROI was measured three

79

times, and the average value was recorded. SNR = CTn/SDn, where CTn and SDn are the average CT and

80

SD values of the lung tissue, respectively. The SD value is the objective noise of the image.

81

Subjective scoring of image quality

82

The two radiologists, with over 10 years of work experience, quantitatively evaluated image quality under

83

the same magnification ratio. Differences in opinion were resolved by consensus. Image quality was scored

84

on a 5-point scale. The evaluation included image noise, presentation of the bronchovascular bundles 2 cm

85

from the pleura, presentation of the lesion and its internal structure, and feasibility of diagnosis. For scoring,

86

5 points: clear lesion and vascular structure with no artifacts; 4 points: acceptable lesion and vascular

87

structure with a small number of artifacts; 3 points: unclear lesion and vascular structure with more artifacts,

88

but diagnosis was unaffected; 2 points: unclear lesion and vascular structure with significant artifacts

89

making diagnosis unsatisfactory; 1 point: unclear lesion and vascular structure, and multiple types of

90

artifacts making diagnosis unsatisfactory.

92

The SPSS 22.0 software was used for analysis. Measurement data were expressed as ⎯x ± s. ANOVA was

93

performed on the SD and SNR values of each group of images. Differences with p< 0.05 were considered

94

statistically significant. Pairwise comparisons between the groups were performed. Count data were

95

expressed as number of cases and percentage, and the Pearson χ2 test was used for comparisons between

96

groups. Binary logistic regression was used for analysis of independent risk factors of CT diagnosis of

97

COVID-19. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used for analysis of the sensitivity and

98

specificity of risk factors of COVID-19 prediction. Medcalc software (version 17.6) was used for

99

comparison and plotting the efficacy of the area under the curve (AUC). Differences with p< 0.05 were

00

considered statistically significant.

01

Results

02

Clinical characteristics

03

A total of 63 cases were included in the study. Some patients underwent CT re-examinations, and a total of

04

75 groups of CT data were obtained for analysis. The 13 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were primarily

05

imported cases or had a history of contact (12/13). There were 59 cases of other types of pneumonias and 6

06

cases of ground-glass nodules.

07

CT presentation

08

Analysis of the CT presentation of the lesions included the distribution and density of lesions and the

09

condition within the lesions (Table 1). With respect to lesion distribution, COVID-19 lesions were mainly

10

distributed within 2 cm of the pleura (87.5%), whereas lesion distribution was non-specific in other

11

pneumonias. COVID-19 lesions were mainly pure (75%) or mixed (18.75%) ground-glass opacities,

12

whereas lesions from other pneumonias were mainly of mixed density (64.41%). Air bronchograms,

13

vascular thickening, interlobular septal thickening, and crazy-paving signs were present in COVID-19

14

lesions, at frequencies of 81.5%,87.5%, 87.5%, and 93.75%, respectively. Air bronchograms were also

15

common in non-COVID-19 pneumonias (57.63%). The differences in all radiologicalsigns, except the

16

number of lesions, were statistically significant between COVID-19 and non- COVID-19 lesions (p< 0.05).

17

Logistic regression analysis

18

Lesion distribution and density, and structural features within the lesion were entered into a logistic

19

regression analysis model to evaluate the independent risk factors of CT diagnosis of COVID-19. The

20

analysis showed that lesion distribution, vascular thickening, interlobular septal thickening, and crazy-

21

paving patterns had value for COVID-19 diagnosis (OR = 0.001, p = 0.003; OR = 43.212, p = 0.008; OR =

22

25.962, p = 0.022; OR = 258.081, p = 0.0001, respectively). However, lesion density and air bronchograms

23

had minimal predictive value, and there was no statistically significant difference between two groups

24

(Table 2).

25

ROC analysis

26

ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC of lesion distribution, vascular thickening, interlobular septal

27

thickening, and crazy-paving patterns were 0.887, 0.870, 0.813, and 0.926, respectively, with sensitivities /

28

specificities of 84.8% / 77.9%, 90.1% / 81.4%, 85.1% / 92.5% and85.4% / 91.5% (Figure 1).

29

C-HRCT and U-HRCT image quality scoring

30

With respect to objective image quality scores, the SD in U-HRCT was greater than that of C-HRCT, and

31

the SNR was lower than that of C-HRCT; the difference was statistically significant (p< 0.05) (Table 2).

32

With increased iteration levels, SD decreased, and SNR increased. At the same iteration level, the SD of U-

33

HRCT was greater than that of C-HRCT, and the SNR was lower than that of C-HRCT. Pairwise

34

comparisons showed that there was no statistically significant difference in image quality between U-HRCT

35

using iDose5 iteration and C-HRCT using iDose3 conditions (p > 0.05).

36

The iDose4-5 iteration had the highest U-HRCT score for displaying the lesion structure and vascular

37

structure of lung tissue. Except for display of lesion margins and crazy-paving patterns within the lesion, the

38

differences in subjective scores were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Pairwise comparisons showed that

39

the C-HRCT scores at high iteration levels were lower than those at low iteration levels for display of the

40

internal structure of some lesions; there was no statistically significant difference between the two iteration

43

Discussion

44

COVID-19 is highly infectious and progresses rapidly. In severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome,

45

respiratory failure, and even death may occur[9]. Diagnosis depends primarily on comprehensive

46

consideration of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and imaging and laboratory data. Chest CT,

47

especially HRCT, is valuable in the diagnosis of suspected cases of COVID-19[10,11]. Although the

48

imaging presentation of COVID-19 is similar to that of other viral pneumonias, the differential diagnosis is

49

more difficult.However, COVID-19 could manifest some characteristic imaging signs, especially when

50

ground-glass opacities werepresent[12,13].

51

In the confirmed COVID-19 cases in the present study, the lesions had a primarily subpleural distribution

52

and had a ground-glass appearance. Vascular thickening, air bronchograms, interlobular septal thickening,

53

and crazy-paving patterns were common in COVID-19 lesions. Air bronchograms were also common in

54

other pneumonias, and display of the bronchial walls is vital in the diagonise. The results of small-sample

55

binary logistic regression showed that the distribution of ground-glass lesions, vascular thickening,

56

interlobular septal thickening, and crazy-paving patterns have some value for diagnosing COVID-19.

57

COVID-19 could be more accurately diagnosed when taken together with the patient’s epidemiological and

58

radiological characteristics, which is generally consistent with the findings of previous studies[14].

59

Display of the internal structure of ground-glass lesions is highly valuable for the diagnosis of COVID-

60

19[15]. In practice, display of the internal details of these lesions is associated with the scanning technology

61

used. U-HRCT uses a 1024 × 1024 matrix, allowing it to better display the morphological characteristics of

62

pulmonary lesions[6,7,8]. Therefore, 1024 matrix U-HRCT images were retrospectively reconstructed and

63

compared with C-HRCT in order to more accurately display the internal structure of ground-glass lesions

64

and improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. Compared to C-HRCT, U-HRCT has increased SD and

65

decreased SNRin the present study.

66

In addition, iterative reconstruction techniques can also reduce SD and improve SNR[16-17].However,

67

the reconstruction speed will be slower with higheriDose4iteration level, and the densities of the lesion and

68

normal tissues tend to become homogeneous, which affects the observation of the internal structure of the

69

lesion[18].Therefore, selection of an appropriate iteration level is essential.

70

In the present study, the image quality of U-HRCT and C-HRCT with the iDose4-3 and iDose4-5 iterative

71

levels were compared and analyzed. We believe that the use of iDose4-5 iterative reconstruction can reduce

72

noise and improve image quality, as well as improve spatial and density resolution of images. Additionally,

73

the reconstruction speed of iDose4-5is suitable for clinical applications. The iDose4-5 iteration level has the

74

highest U-HRCT score for displaying the lesion and vascular structures of the lung tissue; it is particularly

75

suited for vascular thickening, interlobular septal thickening, and other signs in the internal structure of the

76

lesion that are important for diagnosis (Figures 2–4).

77

There is no statistically significant difference between theC-HRCT and U-HRCT groups with respect to

78

displaying crazy-paving patterns. There may be subjective factors involved in the interpretation of signs

79

such as interlobular septal thickening and crazy-paving patterns.

80

This study had a few limitations. The number of patient samples included was small; consequently,

81

statistical analysis may be biased. Retrospective target reconstruction was used in all cases, and no

82

comparison with large-matrix U-HRCT target scan images was performed. Body mass index and radiation

83

dose were not considered while evaluating image quality.

84

Conclusions

85

U-HRCT image could reduce noise and improve SNR with an increase of the iDose4level. The iDose4-5

86

level had the highest U-HRCT score for c1linical applications. Peripleural distribution, thickening of blood

87

vessels and interlobular septum, and crazy-paving pattern on U-HRCT are favorable signs for COVID-19.

88

U-HRCT is superior to C-HRCT in displaying the blood vessels, bronchial walls, and interlobular septum

89

for evaluating COVID-19.
