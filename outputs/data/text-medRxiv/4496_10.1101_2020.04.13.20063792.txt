Abstract
Background: COVID-19 has been impacting on the whole world critically and constantly since late December 2019. Rapidly increasing infections has raised intense worldwide attention. How to model the evolution of COVID-19 effectively and efficiently is of
great significance for prevention and control.
Methods: We propose the multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model based on the original
single-chain model in [8] to describe the evolution of COVID-19 in Singapore. Multichains can be considered as the superposition of several single chains with different char1

acteristics. We identify parameters of models by minimizing the penalty function.
Results: The numerical simulation results exhibit the multi-chain model performs
well on data fitting. Though unsteady the increments are, they could still fall within the
range of ±25% fluctuation from simulation results. It is predicted by multi-chain models
that Singapore are experiencing a nonnegligible risk of explosive outbreak, thus stronger
measures are urgently needed to contain the epidemic.
Conclusion: The multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model provides an effective way to early
detect the appearance of imported infectors and super spreaders and forecast a second
outbreak. It can also explain the data in those countries where the single-chain model
shows deviation from the data.

Introduction
The Fudan-CCDC model [9, 8, 12] was proposed by Cheng’s group at Fudan University

to study the evolution of COVID-19. The model took advantages of the time delay process
introduced by the TDD-NCP model [13, 4, 3, 6, 7, 11] proposed previously also by Cheng’s
group, and developed new convolution kernels for the time delay terms by applying several
time distributions acquired from an important paper [5] by CCDC (China Center for
Disease Control and Prevention). Both the TDD-NCP model and the Fudan-CCDC
model are single-chain models, and have been performed well in analyzing the evolution
of COVID-19 in China, and its early stage of global transmission [10, 14]. Since Mar 2,
some of the simulation results on South Korea, Iran, Italy, Germany, Spain, the U.S. et
al have been posted on Twitter @fudan ccdc.
The idea of multi-chain was first introduced by Nian Shao and Wenbin Chen on Feb
19, 2020, when they were tracking the curve of cumulative confirmed cases in South Korea.

They found that there was a sudden turn in growth rate, just as described in Figure 1,
shown in a semi-log way. Our group suspected that a stronger transmission chain had
occurred, so we began to develop a multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model. Based on the new
model and the public data, we identified the start date of the new transmission chain in
South Korea was around Feb 10, and thus held the view that there was a new source
emerging at that time. Then we announced our finding [2] on Feb 20. Later, it was
confirmed by the news [1] that there was indeed a case of super spreader on Feb 7.

With the further spread of the global pandemic, such sudden change of growth rate has
been observed in the cases of other countries as well. And the curves fitted by the FudanCCDC model sometimes deviate from the data. Singapore is one of the examples. We
had studied Singapore’s case in [14] , and based on the data till Feb 25, we concluded that

Singapore had been successful in disease prevention and control. Since then, one member
of our group, Hanshuang Pan, has been continually tracking the data. Unexpectedly, in
late February, a sudden rise occurred, see Figure 2(b).

We show in Figure 2 the curve fitting for Singapore’s data by the Fudan-CCDC model,
on Feb 17 and Mar 1, respectively. We see in Figure 2(a) that on Feb 17, the Fudan-CCDC
model had predicted that the increment of confirmed cases would be zero on Feb 27, and
remained stable for the next ten days. However, on the crucial day Feb 27, an unexpected
rise occurred in Singapore’s data (see Figure 2(b)), which caused our vigilance. Till Mar
1, this new upward trend was so obvious that it could not be explained by the single chain
Fudan-CCDC model any longer. Therefore, we began to consider the application of the
multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model, and revisit Singapore’s case.

Results
Through simulations, we find that the evolution of the epidemic so far can be well

explained by the two-chain and the three-chain Fudan-CCDC model, although in real-life
transmissions, the number of chains may be far more than three. In this section, we
display the results of the two-chain and three-chain models, and based on the data till
Apr 12, we warn that Singapore is in the risk of a sudden increase in the number of
infected people.

2.1

Results of the two-chain model

Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the evolutions of COVID-19 in Singapore and its possible
future trends, based on the two-chain model. The scattered red circles are the data: the
number of cumulative confirmed cases (Figure 3) and its increment (Figure 4) from Jan
23 to Apr 4. In Figure 3, we illustrate the four ‘most optimized’ fitting curves (in solid
lines) for the data, and their predictions (in dotted lines) by the model, in the order of
red, green, blue and purple, respectively. For the convenience to recognize, the ‘very most
optimized’ fitting curve is drawn in a full solid red line, including its prediction. Details
of the optimization methods are described in the section Materials and Methods. We
can see from Figure 3(a) that based on the two-chain model, Singapore is expected to
have zero increment of confirmed cases on Apr 26, and the total number of infections will
be around 1500, if no other transmission chains arise in the future. Figure 3(b) is the
semi-log form of Figure 3(a), and it clearly demonstrates the excellent curve fitting of the
sudden rise in growth rate around Mar 3.

Figure 4(a) shows the fitting for the daily increment based on the two-chain Fudan
CCDC model. There are two peaks in the curves, suggesting possible new sources of
transmission. Then we single out the ‘most optimized’ curve (the red line) and draw its
area (in light blue) of ±25% fluctuation in Figure 4(b). We see that most of the data fall
in this area, indicating the effectiveness of the model. Besides, the two chains are shown
in green and blue dotted lines, respectively.

Results of the three-chain model

Now we consider the three-chain Fudan-CCDC model. Figure 5(a) and 6(a) show the
epidemic evolution in Singapore based on the three-chain model. The legends are the
same as in the previous context. We can see from Figure 5(a) that under the three-chain
model, Singapore is expected to have zero increment of confirmed cases on May 4, and
the total number of infections will be around 1900, if no other chains of transmission arise
in the future.

In addition, we find that the end date of COVID-19 based on the three-chain model
is later than that based on the two-chain model, and the number of total infected is also
significantly higher. This is because the time of zero increment will now arrive until all
the transmission chains come to end.

Warning a possible new outbreak in Singapore

Figure 7 and Figure 8 show predictions of the cumulative and incremental confirmed
cases in Singapore based on the multi-chain model, with data observed from Jan 23 to Apr
12. The predictions of the two-chain model shows an uncontrollable trend of the epidemic.
In the three-chain model, cumulative confirmed cases would become stable in late May,
peaking at around 7200. These two models both pass on the information that Singapore
might be faced with a very risky situation of rapidly increasing cases. Therefore, strong
measures are urgently needed to contain the epidemic.

Discussion
Advantages of the multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model
The multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model has given a better explanation of the epidemic

evolution in Singapore and Iran, and perhaps other nations as well. Compared to single
chain models, the multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model shows the following advantages: (1) It
better fits the data in history; (2) By identifying different sets of parameters for different
chains, it is able to simulate the multi-peaks in the daily increment data, which the
single-chain models can hardly explain; (3) It illustrates the importance of controlling
the imported cases. Since zero increment depends on when the last chain vanishes, it is
difficult to completely end the epidemic unless all sources of transmission are detected
and blocked.
Detection of new chains
Now we revisit Figure 2 to discuss when to introduce new chains. In Figure 2(b),
there is an obvious shallow pit around Feb 27 along the data trend, illustrating that the
number of confirmed cases was about to flattened, but rose up again immediately. This

10

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063792; this version posted April 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

shallow pit acts as a signal to consider new chains in the model, warning new sources of
transmission. In fact, in Figure 2(a), a shallow pit has already occurred around Feb 12.
This pit was not so obvious as the next one around Feb 27, and was likely to be treated as
fluctuation of the data. Besides, more data are needed to form a new transmission chain.
Therefore, carefully detecting and analyzing these shallow pits plays an important role in
finding new chains.
Additivity
One may find that the multi-chain model is just an addition of multiple single-chain
models. In fact, the single-chain and multi-chain Fudan-CCDC models are both linear
ones, so they enjoy the convenience of additivity. It is a major feature of our model, and
it is not easy to get such good property in traditional epidemic models such as the SIR,
SEIR, SEIJR models, which are all nonlinear. The property of additivity is friendly, as it
allows us to construct new models of not only multiple chains, but also multiple districts,
which might be applicable to Iran, the European Union, the United States and the whole
world. We have already got some good simulation results for the epidemic in Iran, and
more results on more countries will be reported in the near future.

In conclusion, the multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model is suitable for Singapore. It has
made possible the early detection of imported infectors and super spreaders, and is able
to suggest timely adjustment for epidemic control. Our results show that Singapore is
currently in a more risky situation than before because of the new transmission chains
brought by the imported infectors. As is mentioned in our previous paper [14], the
Singapore government has always been making great efforts in trace-tracking and disease
prevention, and there is much experience by other countries to learn from, so we believe

that Singapore has the capacity to handle the crisis and eventually end it, as long as they
keep alert on travellers and cut down every chain of transmission.

Materials and Methods
In this section, we introduce two models, the single-chain Fudan-CCDC model and

the multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model respectively. The single-chain Fudan-CCDC model
describes the evolution of COVID-19 based on the assumption that all the new cases
originate from the initial source, i.e. there is only one chain of transmission. And the
multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model assumes that due to new imported cases, new super
spreaders, or the different transmission characteristics of different regions, there may be
two or more single chains of transmission in the country.

4.1

The single-chain Fudan-CCDC model

As is mentioned in [10, 8, 9, 12, 14], our single-chain Fudan-CCDC model is as follows:
I(k + 1) = I(k) + βI0 (k),
X
J(k + 1) = J(k) + β
I0 (k − i)f4 (i),

(3)

I0 (k) = I(k) − J(k) − G(k),

(4)

where I(k) and J(k) represent the cumulative infected people and the cumulative confirmed cases at day k, respectively, and G(k) is the instant (not cumulative) number
of infected isolated not yet confirmed by the hospital. The infected ones are put into
isolation once they show illness symptoms, and the newly confirmed should be removed
from the isolated group. I0 (k) is the number of people who are potentially infectious to
healthy ones–they are infected actually but not in quarantine or hospitalization. β and `

represent the infection rate and the isolation rate respectively, which may be changed in
different time periods. f2 (k) and f4 (k) are the transition probabilities from infection to
illness onset, and from infection to hospitalization, respectively, which are reconstructed
from one important paper [5] by CCDC. This time delay dynamic system is applicable
to simulations of COVID-19 in the countries where community transmission exists, while
the kernels like f2 (k) and f4 (k) might vary from countries to countries.
The model can be used to fit the reported numbers of the cumulative confirmed cases
and predict the evolution of epidemic, and the details can be found in [10, 8, 9, 12, 14].

4.2

The multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model

In the multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model, the final epidemic transmission chain is the
superposition of several single chains:
I m (k + 1) = I m (k) + β m I0m (k),
X
J m (k + 1) = J m (k) + β m
I0m (k − i)f4 (i),

Gm (k + 1) = Gm (k) + `m

I0m (k − i)f4 (i),

I0m (k) = I m (k) − J m (k) − Gm (k),

and we obtain the sum forms:

J=

where tm is the start time of the m-th source.
Specifically, we have applied the two-chain and the three-chain models to analysis
the situations in Singapore. We suppose that there is a new chain when a sudden turn
appears in the curve of reported confirmed cases. For both the two-chain model and the
three-chain model, infection rate β and isolation rate ` of the fisrt chain are obtained by

fitting data before a specific time node. The differences lie in assumptions and parameters
to identified.

4.3

Optimization method for parameter identification

Parameter identification is an optimization process. There are two kinds of decision
variables in this optimization, time nodes t and the model parameters. We suppose that
more recent data have more importance and efficiency for us to predict the trend. So we
established the objective function as follows:

min f (β, `; t)
t,β,`

2
where f (β, `; t) = ω ||J−data||
+
||data||2

(10)

|| max(J−data,0)||1,t
.
||data||1,t

Note that the first term is to minimize the difference betweem values of data and
simulations, i.e. the empiral risk and the second term is to minimize the structural risk.
ω is the weight of the penalty term, and t contains only t2 in the two-chain model, and
(t2 , t3 ) in the three-chain model.
Time nodes. Since public data are discrete along time and time nodes are dates, the grid
searching method could be used to obtain the minimum value of the objective function.
As characteristics of the first chain is known, so we only need to do grid searching of other
chains.
Model parameters. The parameter optimization is solved by a constrained optimization
problem solver.
Therefore, the whole process of optimization can be summarized as the following three
steps: determine all possible time nodes; calculate the minimum of objective function for
cases of different time nodes; obtain the optimal time nodes and model parameters.

4.4

Values of the parameters

In Figure 4, we can clearly see the rise of another chain, and the lifting of the second
chain is more independent of the first chain, i.e., the second chain emerges when the first
chain almost subsides. The parameters of the first chain, β 1 and `1 , are obtained by fitting
data before Feb 17, considering that the output curve remain stable for a long period.
It is noticed that parameters identified on later date are more likely to be affected by
the new source. Assuming that ` in one region is relatively stable, we set fixed value for
isolation rate, i.e. `1 = `0 .
The values of the parameters in the two-chain model and the three-chain model are
listed in Table 1. From this table, we think that the three-chain model is more reasonable
for the case of Singapore, since the important parameter β is close in the three-chain
model, and we mention that β is essential to the estimation of the basic reproductive
number [9].
