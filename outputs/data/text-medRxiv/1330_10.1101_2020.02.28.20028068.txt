Abstract
Background: SARS-CoV-2-caused coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is posing a
large casualty. The features of COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia,
SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in asymptomatic carriers, and factors predicting disease
progression remain unknown.
Methods: We collected information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, and
laboratory examinations of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to
PLA General Hospital. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify prognostic
factors. The last follow-up was February 18, 2020.
Results: We characterized 55 consecutive COVID-19 patients. The mean incubation
was

days.

The

mean

SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from first positive test to conversion was 9.71 (95%CI,
8.21-11.22) days. COVID-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. Asymptomatic
carriers might transmit SARS-CoV-2. Compared to patients without pneumonia, those
with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate of hypertension, higher
frequencies of having a fever and cough, and higher levels of interleukin-6 (14.61 vs.
8.06pg/mL, P=0.040), B lymphocyte proportion (13.0% vs.10.0%, P=0.024), low
account (<190/ÂµL) of CD8+ T cells (33.3% vs. 0, P=0.019). Multivariate Cox
regression analysis indicated that circulating interleukin-6 and lactate independently
predicted COVID-19 progression, with a hazard ratio (95%CI) of 1.052 (1.000-1.107)
and 1.082 (1.013-1.155), respectively. During disease course, T lymphocytes were

generally lower, neutrophils higher, in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free
patients. CD8+ lymphocytes did not increase at the 20th days after illness onset.
Conclusion: The epidemiological features are important for COVID-19 prophylaxis.
Circulating interleukin-6 and lactate are independent prognostic factors. CD8+ T cell
exhaustion might be critical in the development of COVID-19.

Introduction
Before 2002, 4 kinds of coronaviruses (CoVs, namely HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and
HKU1) were known to infect humans, causing 10%-30% mild upper respiratory
infection in adults, occasionally severe pneumonia in elders, infants, and
immunodeficient persons.1 During 2002-2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome
CoV (SARS-CoV) infected about 8000 persons globally, with a case fatality of 9.5%.2
During 2012-2015, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) infected
about 2500 persons globally, with a case fatality rate of 35%.1,2 Since December 2019,
an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 had
emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.3,4 The clusters of cases were firstly
reported to be related to exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Epidemiologic data indicated clear evidence of person-to-person transmission, and the
transmission led to nosocomial infection.5-7 The case number increased quickly in
Wuhan and posed a large casualty. Up to February 24, 2020, a total of 46607
confirmed cases had been identified in Wuhan, with an estimated case fatality of 4.26%
(1987 deaths). SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread to other parts of Hubei province, other
parts of China, and 29 countries, resulting in 17680 cases and 508 deaths (estimated
fatality: 2.87%), 12975 cases and 100 deaths (0.77%), and 2105 cases and 24 deaths
(1.14%), respectively (up to February 24, 2020). The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2
is higher and the fatality is lower compared to SARS-CoV, although the two CoVs
share the receptor-human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2).8-10 The
etiological, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 epidemic in
Wuhan have been investigated since the disease outbreak.3,5-7,10-14 The occurrences of
COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan were reported.15-19 The difference in the fatality rates

indicates different epidemic patterns among the outbreak zone and outside areas. As
COVID-19 is being rapidly exported to a growing number of countries, its
epidemiological and clinical features outside the outbreak zone are important for the
development of prophylactic options.
Currently, COVID-19 cases reported are all patients with pneumonia, rather than
those without pneumonia. Furthermore, the disease course of COVID-19, the duration
of viral existence, and the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers
remain unknown. Here, we report a series of COVID-19 cases admitted into an
infectious disease hospital that is responsible for quarantine and treatment of
COVID-19 assigned by the government in Beijing, China.

Patients and Methods
Enrollment and diagnosis
This case series was approved by the institutional ethics board of Fifth Medical
Center of PLA General Hospital, with oral informed consents. All consecutive
patients with COVID-19 admitted to Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital
from December 27, 2019 to February 18, 2020 were enrolled. Patients with suspected
COVID-19 were admitted and quarantined. Respiratory samples including throat
swab samples were collected and detected for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using a
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR).4-6 Epidemiological information
was obtained from person-to-person interview for exposure history in the past 2-3
weeks. The date of exposure is referred to the date of being Wuhan, contacting
another patient from Wuhan, and visiting the related hospital(s). Incubation duration
was calculated in the cases with clear cutting time points of exposure and illness onset.

Clinical, laboratory, and radiographic characteristics as well as therapeutic activities
and outcomes were obtained from electronic medical records. Symptoms, signs,
laboratory values, chest computerized tomography scan, and treatment options during
the hospital stay were all documented. COVID-19 was re-diagnosed according to the
Protocol for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (Version 6th), National
Health Commission of the Peopleâs Republic of China. Briefly, the diagnosis of
COVID-19 was confirmed if the patientâs respiratory sample was positive for
SARS-CoV-2, as examined by qRT-PCR or sequencing. All diagnosed COVID-19
patients were classified as mild, common, severe, and extremely severe types. Mild
type was defined if COVID-19 patient had mild symptoms but did not have
pneumonia. Common type was identified if COVID-19 patient had fever, respiratory
symptoms, and radiographic pneumonia. Severe type was diagnosed if COVID-19
patient with pneumonia met one of the following criteria: respiratory rate â¥30
times/min, resting oxygen saturation â¤93%, and arterial partial pressure of oxygen
(PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) â¤300mmHg. Extremely severe type met
one of the following criteria: respiratory failure that needs mechanical ventilation,
shock, and combined organ failure that need to be treated in intensive care unit.
Patients were discharged from hospital if they met the criteria: temperature
normalized for at least 3 days, apparent improvement in respiratory symptoms,
absorption of lung inflammation, and negative SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA tested for
twice at 1 day interval. The final date of follow-up was February 18, 2020.

Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were compared using the Ï2 test or the Fisher exact test.
Continuous variables were described using mean, median, and interquartile range

(IQR) values and compared using independent group t tests or Mann-Whitney U test.
The Cox proportional hazard model was applied to calculate the hazard ratio (HR)
and 95% confidence interval (CI). Stepwise backward multivariate Cox regression
analysis was performed to determine factors independently predicting the progression
of COVID-19. Differences in the daily medians of laboratory parameters between
patients with and without pneumonia in the 20 consecutive days were evaluated using
Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Above statistical analyses were two-sided
and performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 21.0
software. The dynamic diagrams and the trend of each laboratory parameter fitted by
local polynomial regression (LOESS) were generated by R software (version 3.6.2). A
P value of <0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Epidemiological characteristics
A total of 55 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were
enrolled in this study. Of those, 31 (56.4%) ever traveled to Wuhan or came from
Wuhan within 14 days before the onset (direct exposure) and 19 (34.5%) had an
indirect exposure history within 14 days before illness onset. Of the 19 cases, 14 ever
hosted their sick relatives from Wuhan, 2 ate with late-diagnosed friends from Wuhan,
2 shared a railway carriage with a COVID-19 patient, and 1 attended a meeting with a
late-diagnosed colleague. Confirmed case had been increasing since January 10,
reached the peak on January 22, 2020, and then declined gradually. Ten days after the
Wuhan quarantine on January 23, 2020, the curve touched the bottom (Figure 1).
Incubation period was calculated using the data of 31 cases with clear cutting time
points of exposure and illness onset. The mean incubation period of COVID-19 was

8.42 (95% CI, 6.55-10.29) days in all the cases. The mean incubation was 9.06 (95%
CI, 6.11-12.00) days for patients without pneumonia and 7.54 (95% CI, 5.29-9.79)
days for patients with pneumonia.
Of the 55 patients, 32 had regular SARS-CoV-2 examination data. Of the 32 patients,
one co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus
(HBV) and three cases whose samples were intermittently positive were excluded.

without pneumonia (n=17) and 10.45 (8.10-12.81) days for those with pneumonia
(n=11).
Of the 5 remaining cases without an approved exposure history, 2 had unusual
exposure. Patient A, who was long-term bed-ridden, was infected with SARS-CoV-2.
She contacted only 4 healthy family members within 2 weeks before illness onset.
The members did not have direct or indirect exposure history. She was shortly carried
into the Emergency Department of a nearby hospital to replace her gastric tube and
highly suspected to be infected there. Patient B, she and her family members did not
have any exposure history within past a month. Her sister and sister's husband from
Wuhan visited her family and lived in the same building in a remote suburb of Beijing.
Six days later, she became ill and was finally diagnosed as COVID-19. During the
entire course, her sisterâ family members were not ill or even discomfort, indicating
that asymptomatic carriers transmit SARS-CoV-2.

pneumonia at the admission

The median age was 44.0 years (IQR, 34.0-54.0; range, 3-85 years), and 22 (40.0%)
were women. Major symptoms at illness onset were fever (85.5%), cough (50.9%),
fatigue (27.3%), myalgia (20.0%), and sputum production (20.0%). Of the 55 patients,
26 (47.3%) had at least 1 coexisting health conditions. Hypertension (11 [20.0%]) and
diabetes (6 [10.9%]) were the most common ones.
The numbers of mild, common, severe, and extremely severe patients identified at the
admission were 21, 20, 13, and 1, respectively. Common, severe, and extremely
severe types were combined as COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. Compared with
patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a
higher rate of hypertension, having a fever, and cough (Table 1). Compared with
COVID-19 patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia had higher levels of
interleukin-6, B lymphocyte proportion, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and very low
count (<190/ÂµL) of CD8+ T cells (Table 2).

Disease course
Of the 55 patients, 52 received antiviral treatment, mostly with lopinavir/ritonavir and
or arbidol. The mean duration from onset to admission was 5.81(95% CI, 4.95-6.68)
days in 54 patients (except the HIV case). The mean duration was 4.86 (3.46-6.25) in
pneumonia-free patients and 6.42 (5.23-7.53) in pneumonia patients. The mean
duration from illness onset to discharge was 18.57 (16.07-21.08) days in the 28
patients. The mean duration was 17.76 (14.45-21.08) days in pneumonia-free patients
and 19.82 (15.39-24.24) days in pneumonia patients. According to the discharge
criteria, disease course of COVID-19 was approximately 2 weeks, which is in
accordance with another group of patients without antiviral treatment.18

Factors predicting progressive disease
During hospital stay, 1 case with common-type COVID-19 progressed to be severe
COVID-19, 4 severe patients progressed to be extremely severe COVID-19. Of the 4
patients, 2 died of COVID-19. Another 2 cases have been staying in the hospital near
a month due to the development of extra-respiratory signs. The 7 cases were
categorized as patients with progressive disease. Univariate Cox analysis indicated
that hypertension, circulating IL-6, and circulating lactate significantly predicted the
progression. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that circulating IL-6 and
lactate independently predicted COVID-19 progression (Table 3).
We then evaluated the dynamics of clinical and laboratory parameters during hospital
stay between COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and those without pneumonia and
re-categorized the patient with progressive disease. Of the parameters evaluated, 6
showed different trends between COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia
(P<0.001 for each, GEE). The daily medians of neutrophil proportions and
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were higher in pneumonia patients than in
pneumonia-free patients, which were quite in contrast to lymphocyte proportion, T
lymphocyte count, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, and CD8+ T lymphocyte count. At the
20th day after illness onset, the dynamic curves of neutrophil proportion, NLR,
lymphocyte proportion, and CD4+ T lymphocyte count tended to meet (P>0.05),
except those of CD8+ T lymphocytes and T lymphocyte counts (P<0.05) (Figure 2).

Discussion
The epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 in Beijing might represent the
features of COVID-19 outside the outbreak zone. Most patients had clear exposure

history, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 transmits predominantly via respiratory droplet.
As SARS-CoV-2 shares its receptor with SARS-CoV,6 transmission dynamics of
SARS-CoV could be referenced. Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV occurs
mainly in the second week of illness when the patientâs upper airway viral load peaks
on day 10 of illness.20 We found that SARS-CoV-2 was mostly transmitted via
contacting symptomatic patients; however, asymptomatic carriers might transmit
SARS-CoV-2 to healthy recipients. This might be one of the reasons why
SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than is SARS-CoV. Thus, personnel quarantine,
avoiding any kind of party or gathering, and avoiding sharing public facility are
necessary during COVID-19 epidemic. Elders with underlying medical conditions
including hypertension often resulted in serious consequences. This observation is
quite in accordance with SARS and MERS.20 Specific prophylaxis should be given to
this vulnerable population.
We revealed that the mean incubation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 8.42 days. A
previous study carried out in Wuhan indicated that the mean incubation period was
5.2 days.5 Early patients identified in the outbreak zone were mostly with severe
pneumonia and might be exposed to higher viral concentration in closed spaces like
the affected hospitals. Furthermore, it is hard to identify the exact time of exposure in
the outbreak zone. Thus, the incubation from this study should be important in
quarantining close contactors outside the outbreak zone.
The durations of COVID-19 course and SARS-CoV-2-positive course are not reported
previously. We determined that the mean duration from onset to discharge was 18.57
days. According to the discharge criteria, COVID-19 course is approximately 2 weeks,
which is quite in consistent with SARS.21 The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration

from the first positive test to RT-PCR conversion was 9.71 days. SARS-CoV-2 might
be present in patients for around 18 days by adding the mean incubation of 8.42 days.
This duration seems to be shorter than SARS.22 A just finished clinical study in
Shanghai did not show any therapeutic effects of lopinavir/ritonavir and abidol on
accelerating the clearance SARS-CoV-2.23 Thus, the current antiviral regimen could
not alter the course of COVID-19.
To our knowledge, this was the first study to characterize the differences in the
clinical features and laboratory findings between COVID-19 patients with and
without pneumonia. Unlike those without pneumonia, one-third of COVID-19
patients with pneumonia had very low account (<190/ÂµL) of CD8+ T cells. In addition,
serum level of IL-6 was higher in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia than in those
without pneumonia (Table 2). These data suggest that CD8+ T cell exhaustion and
IL-6-based inflammation might play an important role in the development of
COVID-19.
It is critical to identify COVID-19 patients who are most likely to have poor outcomes
so that prevention and treatment efforts can be focused.24 Here, we reported that
serum IL-6 and lactate at the admission independently predicted poor outcomes of
COVID-19 patients, after the adjustment with other significant factors in the
univariate Cox analysis (Table 3). IL-6 is capable of inhibiting the T cell-mediated
immunity, and high level of IL-6 in the acute stage is associated with lung lesions in
SARS patients.25 Lactate is a natural by-product of aerobic glycolysis. Efferocytosis
can promote glucose uptake and lactate release.26 Lactate promotes the switch of
CD4+ T cells to an IL-17+ subset and impairs the cytolytic capacity of CD8+ T cells.27
Thus, IL-6 might bridge SARS-CoV-2 infection and alveolar cell injury via inducing

tissue-damaging inflammation. The inflammation increases efferocytosis-mediated
aerobic glycolysis, facilitating the release of lactate. Increased lactate in turn impairs
the CD8+ T cell-mediated antiviral immunity.
For the first time, the dynamic changes of laboratory parameters of COVID-19
patients with and without pneumonia were evaluated during hospital stay. Neutrophil
proportion and NLRs were higher in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free
patients, indicating systemic inflammation is apparent. Lymphocyte proportion and
CD4+ T lymphocyte counts were lower in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free,
and the two curves met at the 20th day, indicating B cells might recover rapidly.
Surprisingly, the lower levels of CD8+ cells in pneumonia patients did not increase at
the 20th day (Figure 2), indicating that recovery of CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity
needs a longer time. Thus, the discharged patients might be susceptible to infections
and other diseases. The recovery of T cell count should be monitored.
Our study has several limitations. First, the effect of antiviral treatment was not
evaluated due to lack of controls. Second, the family members of patient Bâs sister
were not examined for SARS-CoV-2, because they left when we performed this study.
Third, half patients are still hospitalized. The disease course of severe patients might
be prolonged by therapeutic regimens including corticosteroids.28
Finally, we characterized the epidemiological features including the incubation period,
time to RT-PCR conversion of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 course, and the
transmissibility SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers. Old age, hypertension,
interleukin-6, and CD8+ T cell exhaustion were significantly associated with the
development of pneumonia. Circulating interleukin-6 and lactate independently
predicted COVID-19 progression. CD8+ T cell exhaustion might be important in

Figure Legends

Figure 1. Consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to the study hospital
Wuhan-direct, the patients who traveled to Wuhan or came from Wuhan within 14
days before illness onset; Wuhan-indirect, the patients who ever exposed to a late diagnosed patient from Wuhan within 14 days before illness onset; and no explicit
contact history, the patients did not have the above 2 situations.

Figure 2. The dynamic curves of major laboratory findings between COVID-19
patients with pneumonia and those without pneumonia
Daily medians of laboratory parameters within the first 20 days were applied to
construct the dynamic curves. P value indicates the difference between laboratory
parameters at the 10th and 20th day since illness onset (Mann-Whitney U test).
