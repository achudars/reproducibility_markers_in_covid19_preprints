SARS-CoV-2 in North Carolina

Abstract
Background: Several cases of the B1.1.7 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were identified in North Carolina
first on January 23, 2021 in Mecklenburg County and later in Guilford County on January 28, 2021.[1,2] This
variant has been associated with higher levels of transmissibility.[3–6] This study examines the potential
impact of increased transmissibility as the B1.1.7 variant becomes more predominant given current vaccine
distribution plans and existing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).
Method: We explored the anticipated impact on the effective reproduction number for North Carolina and
Guilford County given the date of import of B1.1.7. The approximate growth rate in proportion of B1.1.7
observed in the United Kingdom was fit and used to establish the estimate share of B1.1.7 circulating in
North Carolina. Using the nowcasted reproduction numbers, a stochastic discrete compartmental model
was fit with the current vaccination rates and B1.1.7 transmissibility to estimate the impact on the effective
reproduction number.
Results: We found that the effective reproduction number for North Carolina and Guilford County may
exceed one, indicating a return to accelerating spread of infection in April as the proportion of B1.1.7
increases. The effective reproduction number will likely decrease into March, then increase as the proportion
of B1.1.7 increases in circulation in the population.
Conclusions: Existing non-pharmaceutical interventions will need to remain in effect through the spring.
Given the current vaccination rate and these interventions, it is likely that there will be an increase in
SARS-CoV-2 infections. The impact of the variant will likely be heterogeneous across North Carolina given
the reproduction number and volume of susceptible persons in each county at the time of introduction of
the variant. Age-based vaccinations will likely reduce the overall impact on hospitalizations. This analysis
underlines the need for population level genetic surveillance to confirm the proportion of variants circulating.

Method
Data
This analysis considered effective reproduction number data generated for the state of North Carolina using
the[7] R package following the methods specified by.[8] Data on S-gene target failure (SGTF) observed in
the United Kingdom and made available in the analysis[5] were used in order to estimate proportion of
anticipated B1.1.7 variant circulating. Case rates were provided by the North Carolina Department of
Health and Human Services and retrieved using the nccovid package.[9]

Statistical analysis
In order to estimate the growth in proportion of B1.1.7, a hierarchical beta regression model was fit to data
available from the analysis of Davies[5] representing the proportion of SGTF cases out of cases tested using
a specific testing platform within seven NHS England regions. In this model, the outcome variable was
the proportion of SGTF given the number of days after introduction. The NHS England region was used
as a group level intercept, fit using the RStanArm R package[10] . These data were then used to estimate
transmissibility multiplier for day t, φt , on the base contact rate given the days after the introduction of the
new variant. The transmissibility multiplier represents the weighted average increase in transmission given
a fixed contact rate, β.
A stochastic discrete compartmental model was then used to simulate the effect of vaccinations and circulation of B1.1.7 on the effective reproduction number. Using case data and including multipliers to account
for under-ascertainment of infections, the model included compartments for susceptible, exposed, infected,
and removed1 persons in the population as shown in the below equations. It is assumed that immunity is
permanent for the course of the simulation. The models were fit using the Odin R package[11] and each
simulation was run 100 times.

Nine scenarios were evaluated for North Carolina and Guilford County. These scenarios included the 10%,
50%, and 90% quantile estimates for the effective reproduction number on the incubation time adjusted
import date of B1.1.7 estimated using the EpiNow2 package.[7] The increase in transmissibility was modeled
as 0% reflecting no increase, 50% increase, and 80% increase.[4,5,14] Based on the latest findings from Davies,
the increase in transmissibility could be as high as 82% with the 95% credible interval including 106%.[6]
The scenarios are shown in Table 1.

All analysis was conducted in the R Statistical Computing Environment[15] and is available at https://github.
com/conedatascience/sgtf-nc.

Results
Figure 1 represents the observed proportion of SGTF in the NHS England regions. Additionally, the fitted
curve from the beta regression is displayed as a dashed line. This fitted curve was used to estimate the
proportion of SGTF in the compartmental models given the introduction date.
Figure 2 shows the evolution in the effective reproduction number in North Carolina and Guilford County.

Discussion
These models demonstrate the potential heterogeneity in impact of the new variant across the state of North
Carolina and the importance of the effective reproduction number at the time of introduction of B1.1.7.
Both models indicate that if B1.1.7 results in a 50% increase in transmissibility and overtakes existing wild
type variants as observed in England, the effective reproduction number may exceed 1, indicating a return
to exponential spread in April of 2021. A similar trend would be observed if the increase in transmissibility
is as high as 80%. This underlines the importance of accelerating vaccinations across North Carolina.
Additionally, this analysis is in the context of existing mobility and occupancy restrictions, indicating that
these interventions should remain in effect through the spring.
Importantly, the trajectory for the effective reproduction number will be similar in both regions with and
without the variant until March, showing a decrease in the effective reproduction number over the short
term. This will be observed in lower incidences of cases. However, as B1.1.7 becomes the dominant variant,
the effective reproduction number will likely start to increase. Without rigorous sampling of SARS-CoV-2
infections for genetic sequencing, the proportion of B1.1.7 circulating is unknown. Thus we will not be able
to confirm the above analysis until March when the reproduction begins to increase.
This analysis assumes homogeneous mixing in the populations modeled and does not consider differences in
contact patterns amongst different age groups. Vaccination uptake is assumed to be 100% over the short
term, though as time progresses it may be harder to distribute doses to hard to reach or vaccine hesitant
populations. This does not consider the introduction of new vaccine programs, which should increase available
supply of vaccine (though at the time of writing only two vaccines have EUA approval from the United States
Food and Drug Administration). Similarly, it is estimated the vaccination programs that favor the elderly
could have an out-sized impact on the hospitalization rate.[16,17] Additionally, the analysis considers neither
the impact of seasonality as this is still an open question, nor the impact of major holiday gatherings like
Passover and Easter.[18] It is assumed that existing restrictions on mobility and the requirement for facemasks
in public places remains the same.[19] The circulation of other new and emerging variants is not considered.
