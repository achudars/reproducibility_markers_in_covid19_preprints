Abstract: There is an urgent need to identify which COVID-19 patients will develop life-

24

threatening illness so that scarce medical resources can be optimally allocated and rapid

25

treatment can be administered early in the disease course, when clinical management is most

26

effective. To aid in the prognostic classification of disease severity, we performed untargeted

27

metabolomics profiling of 341 patients with plasma samples collected at six longitudinal time

28

points. Using the temporal metabolic profiles and machine learning, we then built a predictive

29

model of disease severity. We determined that the levels of 25 metabolites measured at the time

30

of hospital admission successfully predict future disease severity. Through analysis of

31

longitudinal samples, we confirmed that these prognostic markers are directly related to disease

32

progression and that their levels are restored to baseline upon disease recovery. Finally, we

33

validated that these metabolites are also altered in a hamster model of COVID-19. Our results

34

indicate that metabolic changes associated with COVID-19 severity can be effectively used to

35

stratify patients and inform resource allocation during the pandemic.

Introduction

37

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by infection with the novel coronavirus

38

SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global health crisis (Wu et al., 2020b). As of January 2021, more than

39

100 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide and resulted in over 2.1 million

40

deaths (2020d). The infection fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 can be reduced with the appropriate

41

care (e.g., intensive care unit beds, staff, extracorporeal life support, and therapeutics). Such

42

resources are limited, however, and with fewer than five million individuals in the United States

43

fully vaccinated, they continue to be in high demand (2020d). In the United States, one out of

44

five hospitals with an intensive care unit (ICU) has at least 95% of their ICU beds full (Conlen

45

F., 2021) and fewer than 150,000 patient courses of casirivimab and imdevimab monoclonal

46

antibodies have been distributed (2020c). Availability of bamlanivimab, the only other

47

monoclonal antibody that currently has emergency use authorization, has been similarly limited

48

(2020b).

49

To reduce mortality, patients who develop critical illness from COVID-19 must be treated

50

early in the disease course before the onset of severe symptoms (Kim et al., 2020).

51

Unfortunately, COVID-19 progresses rapidly and it is currently difficult to determine which

52

subset of infected patients will develop life-threatening disease (Kattan et al., 2020). If these

53

patients could be identified, however, then the limited amount of resources available could be

54

optimally allocated to save the greatest number of lives. To this end, the objective of the current

55

study was to identify metabolites in patient plasma that accurately predict life-threatening cases

56

of COVID-19 prior to the onset of severe symptoms.

57

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus that gains entry into

58

host cells through binding of the viral S protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

59

receptor (Hou et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Multiple studies have established that patients

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.05.21251173; this version posted February 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

60

infected with SARS-CoV-2 have metabolic dysregulation, possibly due to immune-triggered

61

inflammation or other changes in host physiology (Fraser et al., 2020; Kimhofer et al., 2020;

62

Overmyer et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020; Thomas et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a). To date,

63

however, unique alterations in metabolites upon SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been validated

64

in large patient cohorts. Moreover, metabolites have not been profiled longitudinally from early

65

after infection through recovery to assess which changes are indicative of disease course.

66

In this study, we performed untargeted metabolomics profiling on the polar and non-polar

67

fractions of over 700 human plasma samples collected from 341 patients as part of the WU-350

68

cohort recruited during the first phase of the pandemic in St. Louis, MO. Untargeted

69

metabolomics allows for the unbiased profiling of the human metabolome (Patti et al., 2012) and

70

has been successful at discovering metabolite biomarkers associated with disease pathology

71

(Beger et al., 2016). Using machine learning, we built a predictive model of COVID-19 disease

72

severity based on the metabolic profiles of samples collected from patients at hospital

73

presentation. The model led us to identify 25 unique metabolite biomarkers that were highly

74

predictive of future disease severity. We confirmed that these metabolites were directly related to

75

SARS-CoV-2 infections through comparison to patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical

76

measurements, and longitudinal samples taken from individuals over the course of disease

77

progression. Lastly, we validated that the same biomarkers appeared in an established hamster

78

model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Chan et al., 2020; Imai et al., 2020; Muñoz-Fontela et al.,

79

2020).

Clinical cohort WU-350 – demographics

83

The clinical cohort presented in this study consisted of 155 female and 186 male participants.

84

Out of the 341 patients, 274 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab PCR and

85

67 tested negative. The demographic information for the patients is summarized in Table 1.

86

Significant differences were observed in several demographic factors for the SARS-CoV-2-

87

positive (COV+) cohort compared to the SARS-CoV-2-negative (COV-) cohort. The age ranges

88

of both the COV+ and COV- cohorts are comparable (Figure S1a). However, the COV+ group

89

has significantly older study participants (p<0.0001). The COV+ group is also enriched for

90

African American, male, and non-smoking individuals. There was no significant difference in

91

the body mass index (BMI) between the two groups (Figure S1b).

92

Out of 274 COV+ individuals, 253 were admitted to the hospital and 129 of those patients

93

were admitted to the ICU. As expected, the incidence of both factors (hospitalization and ICU

94

admission), were significantly increased in the COV+ cohort. Treatment of severe COVID-19

95

cases often results in intubation and mechanical ventilation (Goyal et al., 2020). In total, 49 of

96

the COV+ patients required mechanical ventilation, whereas only four COV- individuals

97

required mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate in the COV+ group was 19%, which was

98

significantly higher than in the COV- group (6.0%). A total of 52 COV+ patients died, with 48

99

of the deaths being attributed to COVID-19 and 4 being attributed to other causes.

100

Out of 274 COV+ patients, 253 showed at least one COVID-19-related symptom mentioned

101

by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) including fever, chills, conjunctival

102

congestion, nasal congestion, headaches, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, nausea or

103

vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, and loss of taste or smell (CDC, 2020). The remaining 21

104

COV+ cases showed none of these symptoms and were classified as COVID-19-asymptomatic.

105

Patients without COVID-19 symptoms received a SARS-CoV-2-test upon presentation at the

106

hospital for reasons unrelated to the pandemic (e.g., accidents, trauma, routine procedures, pre-

107

operation testing, or cancer screening/treatment). Out of the 67 COV- cases, 58 presented with at

108

least one COVID-19-related symptom, while two did not have any symptoms characteristic of

109

COVID-19. The frequency of COVID-19-related symptoms is shown in Table 1, and the

110

distributions across the COV+ and COV- cohorts are depicted in Figure S1c. In both the COV-

111

and COV+ groups, the number of COVID-19 related symptoms reported per individual was

112

comparable. The breakdown of how many symptoms were experienced per individual in both the

113

COV+ and COV- groups is shown in Figure S1d.

114

Next, we examined the distribution of comorbidities in the presented WU-350 cohort. The

115

incidence of acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and/or hypercapnia, chronic kidney disease

116

(CKD), and diabetes was significantly higher in the COV+ group compared to the COV- group

117

(Table 1). Of the COV+ patients, 43% were hypoxic at some point during their hospitalization, a

118

significantly higher proportion than in the COV- group (25%). Furthermore, 34% of COV+

119

individuals showed an abnormal arterial pH compared to 12% in the COV- group.

Study design

127

Blood was collected from study participants enrolled in the WU-350 study during their initial

128

presentation at the hospital (d0). Further longitudinal samples were collected 3 (d3), 7 (d7), 14

129

(d14), 28 (d28), and 84 (d84) days after the initial blood collection when possible. However, the

130

collection of longitudinal samples depended on survival of the study participants as well as the

131

participants’ compliance to donate blood samples after being discharged from the hospital. A

132

total of 704 human plasma samples from 341 patients were available for metabolomics profiling,

133

including 324 d0 samples, 165 d3 samples, 111 d7 samples, 54 d14 samples, 31 d28 samples,

134

and 19 d84 samples. All samples were divided into nine randomized sample batches and

135

analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). An extract of the standard

136

reference material SRM 1950 from NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology,

137

Metabolites in Frozen Human Plasma) was measured repeatedly as a quality control (QC) and

138

blank samples were used to assess background signals. Polar and lipid metabolite fractions were

139

extracted from each sample, and a global metabolomics profile was acquired in both positive and

140

negative ionization modes. Processing of the data led to the putative identification of 235 polar

141

and 472 lipid metabolites based on accurate mass and MS/MS matching. Peak areas were

142

extracted for these 707 metabolites to form the metabolic profile of each patient.

143

Given that the metabolic profiles were acquired over several months, the combined data

144

showed strong batch effects as demonstrated by the principal component analysis (PCA) in

145

Figure S2a. To remove the variance introduced by the individual batches, but not lose the

146

differentiating biological variance within the research (WU-350) samples, we tested several

147

normalization approaches (Figure S2b) and selected a Combined Batch Correction (ComBat)

148

(Fernández-Albert et al., 2014) approach that outperformed the other common normalization

149

approaches tested (e.g., PQN, unit length, constant sum, quantile, etc.). After normalization, the

150

metabolic profiles retained differences according to sample origin (WU-350, QC, blank) as

151

shown in Figure S2c but no longer clustered based on batch (Figure S2d).

152

The goal of this study was to find metabolic alterations that are predictive of disease severity

153

in SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals. We used admission to the ICU during disease progression

154

to classify patients as having severe or non-severe disease, as has been done previously

155

(Arunachalam et al., 2020; Petrilli et al., 2020). An ideal biomarker panel would allow an

156

individual presenting at the hospital and receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2-PCR-test result to be

157

screened for metabolic markers associated with severe disease progression to guide the best

158

treatment at the earliest stage of hospitalization. Thus, we grouped the presented COV+ cohort

159

into a non-severe (COV+ non-severe) group that did not require ICU admission and a severe

160

group (COV+ severe) that did require ICU admission. For data interpretation purposes, two

161

study samples were excluded due to a missing SARS-CoV-2-PCR-test result, one sample due to

162

missing clinical information, and 15 samples were excluded as they represented longitudinal

163

samples from COV- individuals. The final patient cohort consisted of 67 COV- cases, 145

164

COV+ non-severe cases, and 129 COV+ severe cases. Unsupervised analysis of the metabolic

165

profiles for the 324 d0 samples available in our patient cohort demonstrated a clear trend in

166

principal components space that separated COV+ severe, COV+ non-severe, and COV- patients

167

(Figure 1a). Further, several significantly varying metabolites suggested that the metabolic

168

profiles at d0 may indeed be predictive of disease severity. Hierarchical clustering analysis

169

(HCA) of the 54 statistically significant metabolites (p<0.05, Welch’s ANOVA) with an absolute

170

fold change greater than two when compared to the COV- group revealed striking changes in

171

multiple representatives of lipid classes including lysophophatidylcholines (LPCs),

172

phosphatidylcholines (PCs), and triglycerides (TGs). Further, several polar metabolites known to

173

be related to COVID-19 including gluconate (Song et al., 2020) and dimethylguanosine (Migaud

174

et al., 2020) were also significantly altered (Figure 1b).

Predictive model of COVID-19 disease severity

194

The global trends in the d0 metabolic profiles visible in the PCA and HCA visualizations

195

prompted us to develop a machine learning (ML) model of disease severity that would predict

196

ICU admission caused by SARS-CoV-2-infection. To make this prediction, we relied on the

197

metabolic signatures in blood plasma at the day of hospital presentation (d0). The 707

198

metabolites that composed the metabolic profiles served as the predictors for our ML model. To

199

assess predictive power, we split our dataset into two distinct groups: a training set (165 patients)

200

that we used to select, optimize, and train our ML model and a test set (98 patients) that was only

201

used to evaluate the model’s performance (Figure 1c, Table S1, Table S2). Using our training

202

set, we evaluated the efficacy of five ML algorithms with 20-fold cross validation and found that

203

a linear ElasticNet (Zou and Hastie, 2005) regression model was the most effective (Figure S3a).

204

After training the model, we applied it to the patients in the test set and assessed performance by

205

using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). On the test set, we see

206

strong predictive performance (AUC = 0.72) that outperforms a simple model that only uses

207

BMI and age to predict disease severity (Figure 2a) and is significantly more predictive than a

208

random model (Figure 2b, see Permutation test in Methods). As further validation, when the

209

trained model was applied to the COV- patients (no COV- patients were in the training set), the

210

mean scores output by the model were lower than those for the COV+ non-severe and the COV+

211

severe patients in the test set (Figure S3b). This indicates that the model can not only

212

differentiate disease severity but also can distinguish COV+ and COV- patients. We wish to

213

emphasize that PCR is the gold standard to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. As such, we

214

present this result only as confirmation that our model correctly predicts disease severity and not

215

as a diagnostic for viral infection.

216

We next sought to interpret which metabolites were most salient to the model’s predictions.

217

First, we computed the variable importance of the model when trained on the complete dataset,

218

which found 93 metabolites that contributed to the model’s predictions. Among this group of 93

219

compounds were metabolites that have been previously implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection

220

such as bilirubin, kynurenate, nicotinamide, creatinine, LPCs, and others (Shen et al., 2020; Song

221

et al., 2020; Thomas et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a). The mean intensity of each metabolite in the

222

COV-, COV+ non-severe, and COV+ severe groups can be seen in Figure S4. Next, we aimed to

223

assess the robustness of the metabolites selected by the ML model. We used bootstrap

224

resampling of our training dataset to construct confidence intervals for the variable importance of

225

each of the 707 metabolites profiled (Mendez et al., 2020). The analysis led to the identification

226

of 25 metabolites that significantly contributed to the model’s fit. The structural identities of

227

these metabolites were rigorously confirmed (see Methods). Strikingly, 14 of the 25 metabolites

228

are LPCs. Using this reduced predictor set, we re-trained and re-optimized our ElasticNet model

229

on the training set and assessed the predictive power of these 25 metabolites on our test set.

230

Using only these 25 metabolites resulted in nearly an identical AUC to when the full set of

231

metabolites was used (AUC = 0.70) and still performed better than a random model or a model

232

that used only BMI and age as predictors (Figure S5). The variable importance of these 25

233

metabolites when trained on the entire dataset is shown in Figure 2c. The mean intensity of the

234

25 metabolites in the COV-, COV+ non-severe, and COV+ severe groups is shown in Figure 2d

235

and Figure S6. All LPCs and PCs that contributed to the model, as well as serine, presented a

236

downward trend of signal abundance with disease severity. Conversely, the other polar

237

metabolites, (kynurenate and 1-methyladenosine) and two phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs),

238

exhibited an upward trend in signal intensity (Figure 2e).

255

Demographics, laboratory values, comorbidities, and COVID-19 severity.

256

After evaluating the efficacy of the ML model, we wished to deduce the relationship of our 25

257

robust metabolite predictors to COVID-19 disease severity. We examined whether these

258

metabolites were reflective of an underlying condition, risk factor for severe disease, or related to

259

the disease progression of COVID-19. We addressed the former by asking whether any of the 25

260

metabolites correlated with demographic factors, laboratory values, or individual patient

261

comorbidities available for the patient cohort. A comparison of the COV+ non-severe and severe

262

groups identified several significantly different parameters (Table 2). The COV+ severe group is

263

significantly biased towards patients with advanced age, however, the age ranges in both groups

264

are comparable (Figure 3a). There was no significant difference in BMI (Figure 3b), but we note

265

that there was variability in BMI for both patient groups. CO2 levels were not significantly

266

altered between groups (Figure 3c), with values mostly being in the normal range. In contrast,

267

there were significantly increased levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (Figure

268

3d). D-dimer, absolute neutrophil count, and neutrophil % were also increased (Figure 3e-g).

269

These data indicate more severe inflammation in the COV+ severe group compared to the non-

270

severe group and are consistent with reports from previous studies (Ahmed et al., 2020; Luo et

271

al., 2020; Thomas et al., 2020). Neutrophil recruitment has also been shown to be dysregulated in

272

severe COVID-19 disease (Liao et al., 2020; Park and Lee, 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,

273

2020).

274

Next, because specific comorbidities increase the risk of having a severe case of COVID-19

275

(Jain and Yuan, 2020; Petrilli et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2020), we also asked which co-

276

morbidities are enriched in the COV+ severe group compared to the COV+ non-severe group

277

(Figure 3h, Table 2). The COV+ severe patients had a significantly greater proportion of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.05.21251173; this version posted February 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

278

individuals suffering from acute respiratory failure, CKD, and/or diabetes. The number of

279

individuals with cancer (or a history of cancer) and acute renal failure was not significantly

280

different between the groups. Further, laboratory tests showed an increased proportion of

281

individuals having hypoxia and abnormal arterial pH in the COV+ severe group compared to

282

COV+ non-severe patients. Critically high/low pH values were only observed in the COV+

283

severe group. We note that timestamps for laboratory tests and measurements were not available

284

for the patient cohort due to HIPPA privacy regulations. As such, these tests and measurements

285

could have been performed at any point during an individual’s hospital stay.

286

Considering the number of significant associations in the patient parameters between COV+

287

severe and non-severe patients, we wanted to check whether any of our predictor metabolites

288

significantly correlated with the clinical data. To that end, we computed the Pearson correlation

289

(Benesty et al., 2009) (for continuous parameters) or the point biserial correlation (Tate, 1954)

290

(for binary parameters) between each predictor metabolite and patient parameter (Figure 3i). The

291

analysis did not reveal any strong correlations between patient parameters and our predictor

292

metabolites. The only significant but moderate correlation with age was with 1-methyladenosine

293

(r=0.4), which was also correlated weakly with CKD (r=0.37) and neutrophil percentage

294

(r=0.39). Significant but weak correlations (r=0.37) were observed for kynurenate and CKD,

295

which has been described previously (Gagnebin et al., 2020). Further, C-reactive protein and

296

neutrophil percentages have a moderate positive correlation with the ceramide (Cer) Cer-NS

297

d18:1_16:0 (r=0.47) and PE 16:0_18:2 (r=0.43). Both the C-reactive protein values and the

298

neutrophil percentages are weakly to moderately negatively correlated with most of the LPCs

299

and serine levels (r = [-0.4, -0.31]), indicating that the reduction of LPCs and serine is

300

concomitant with the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Mudd et al., 2020). Notably,

301

the majority of our predictor metabolites had only weak or insignificant correlations with the

302

comorbidities or patient parameters.

303

We next sought to assess the predictive power of our ML model (when trained on the training

304

set) relative to the predictive power of the patient comorbidities. Thus, for each patient

305

comorbidity we computed the AUC when predicting disease severity based on the comorbidity

306

status for each patient in the test set (Figure 3j). For all evaluated comorbidities, the model

307

achieves a higher AUC. Taken together, these results suggest that our predictor metabolites are

308

indeed relevant to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and not merely markers of other

309

risk factors.

Longitudinal progression of predictor metabolites

330

To give further confidence that our predictor metabolites are associated with COVID-19

331

pathogenesis, we next aimed to determine how the levels of these metabolites changed over the

332

course of disease progression. First, we considered the portion of the COV+ severe cohort that

333

survived SARS-CoV-2-infection. We sought to determine the temporal behavior of their

334

metabolic profiles as patients reach peak disease severity and after recovery. Accordingly, we

335

compared the longitudinal metabolite abundances from individuals who had severe disease but

336

survived and were discharged from the hospital. We compared their initial d0 plasma sample

337

with the sample taken closest to the day of ICU admission and the last sample provided by the

338

patient at or after hospital discharge. For several LPCs and one PC, a V-shaped trend was

339

observed (Figure 4a). After the initial sample (d0), the level of these metabolites dropped further

340

as the disease worsened but then began to restore during recovery. The reverse trend was

341

observed for Cer-NS d18:1_16:0. Its levels significantly increased until the patients were

342

admitted to the ICU. However, the levels sharply dropped to below the initial d0 levels in the

343

final sample obtained.

344

These pronounced longitudinal trends in surviving COV+ severe patients raised the question

345

of how the trajectory of disease progression (as marked by our predictor metabolites) differed

346

among COV+ non-severe patients, surviving COV+ severe patients, and deceased COV+ severe

347

patients. Further, we wished to compare the end points in these groups to the COV- d0 patients.

348

We constructed representative metabolite profiles for the groups by using the 25 predictor

349

metabolites at each of the study time points (d0, d3, d7, d14, d28, and d84) and performed a

350

principal component analysis that enabled the trajectory of each group to be drawn out in two

351

dimensions (Figure 4b). Strikingly, the analysis revealed three distinct trajectories with starting

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.05.21251173; this version posted February 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

352

points that trended with disease severity. The groups then followed a common trajectory through

353

d14, after which deceased and surviving COV+ severe patients diverge, and COV+ non-severe

354

patients rapidly progress to the end of the trajectory that is constant for d28 and d84. For both

355

surviving COV+ severe patients and COV+ non-severe patients, the endpoint is close to that of

356

the d0 COV- patients. However, COV+ non-severe patients reach this point faster. Conversely,

357

for deceased COV+ patients, after d14, the metabolic profile moves further away from the COV-

358

profile staying relatively constant in principal component one (explaining 84% of the variance)

359

but increasing away from COV- in principal component two (explaining 8% of variance). No

360

d84 samples were available for deceased COV+ severe patients. We next examined the

361

individual metabolite levels within the four groups at each time point. The deceased COV+

362

severe patients show the same direction of dysregulation across the predictor metabolites as the

363

surviving COV+ severe patients, but the magnitude of the perturbation is increased. Unlike the

364

other groups, these deceased patients show no recovery throughout the disease progression

365

(Figure S7).

Figure 4. Course of disease progression. a) Prediction model metabolites that significantly vary
in intensity as a function of disease progression for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients surviving
severe disease (COV+ severe). d0 denotes the first sample after hospital admission, ICU denotes
the sample collected closest to ICU admission, and the last sample is the final sample collected
for the patient. Only patients where these time points were distinct samples were used. Statistical
significance was assessed by using a repeated measures one-way ANOVA with BenjaminiHochberg correction. b) Principal components analysis showing the trajectory of the mean
metabolic profile of the 25 predictor metabolites in COV+ non-severe patients (orange),
surviving COV+ severe patients (red), and deceased COV+ severe patients (black). No d84
samples were available for deceased COV+ severe patients. The last two points for COV+ nonsevere patients overlap. In green, the mean d0 metabolic profile of COV- patients is shown. The
surviving COV+ patient profiles approach the d0 COV- profile by d84.

Next, we sought to compare the longitudinal progression of the predictor metabolites between

383

the surviving COV+ patients. In the COV+ severe group, the LPC levels increased over the

384

course of 84 days to levels that are comparable to the COV- group (FC=1, Figure 5a). In the

385

COV+ non-severe group, the LPC levels recovered faster, and, at day 28, an overcompensation

386

occurred resulting in higher LPC levels than in the COV- group (FC=1, Figure 5b). In total, 22

387

out of the 25 predictor metabolites showed a significant change (p<0.05, Welch’s ANOVA)

388

across the longitudinal timepoints in the COV+ severe group (Figure 5c). All 14 LPCs

389

significantly increased over time, as well as lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) 18:0, PC 38:6,

390

PC 20:4_20:4, and PC 18:2_22:6. Kynurenate, Cer-NS d18:1_16:0, Cer-NS d18:2_16:0, and PE

391

16:0_20:4 showed a decreasing trend after initially being increased compared to the d0 sample of

392

the COV- group. Due to lower sample numbers, the COV+ non-severe group had only 11

393

metabolites that showed a significant trend (p<0.05, Welch’s ANOVA, Figure 5d). These 11

394

metabolites are composed of 8 LPCs, Cer-NS d18:1_16:0, PC 38:6, and LPE 18:0.

Syrian Hamster Model Confirms Metabolite Changes in COVID-19 Disease

409

Lastly, we aimed to validate that the trends observed for the predictor metabolites in the patient

410

samples also appeared in an established animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Chan et al.,

411

2020; Imai et al., 2020). Syrian hamsters have been found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2

412

infection, with the virus mainly replicating in the upper and lower respiratory tract of intranasally

413

challenged animals for approximately six days post-infection. The animals also show signs of

414

disease characterized by body weight lost and pathological lung inflammation. We obtained

415

plasma samples from golden Syrian hamsters that were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-

416

2, influenza virus, or nasally treated with saline solution as a mock infection. Relative to the

417

body weights of the mock hamsters, hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 experienced

418

significant bodyweight loss (approximately 15%) while hamsters infected with influenza virus

419

did not lose body weight, which is consistent with a previous report (Iwatsuki-Horimoto et al.,

420

2018). After 2, 4, 6, and 14 days (d2, d4, d6, and d14) post-infection, plasma was harvested from

421

the SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus-infected hamsters (Figure 6a). For the mock group, plasma

422

was harvested on days 4 and 14 relative to the infection timeline. All plasma samples were

423

subjected to the same LC/MS workflow as described above. Of our 25 metabolite predictors, all

424

but PC 20:4_20:4 was detected in the hamster plasma. We compared samples from the three

425

groups (SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and mock) harvested on d4, when the disease was fully

426

established (Chan et al., 2020; Imai et al., 2020). Figure 6b summarizes the significantly

427

changing predictor metabolites (p<0.05, Welch’s ANOVA) across the three groups. The LPCs

428

showed the same trend as what was observed in the human samples (i.e., a significant depression

429

when compared to the control group). For all significantly varying metabolites, with the

430

exception of PE 16:2_20:4, infection with the influenza virus showed a similar trend of

431

dysregulation away from control samples but a very different magnitude compared to a SARS-

432

CoV-2 infection. This is consistent with lower rates of body weight loss in influenza virus-

433

infected hamsters as compared to those infected with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we wanted to

434

determine whether the predictor metabolites in hamsters showed a similar recovery trend over 14

435

days of infection to what we observed in human patients over a period of 84 days of infection.

436

Indeed, there is a similar trend in the SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters (Figure 6c) as in the

437

human COV+ samples when compared to the d4 control (mock) samples. LPC levels dropped

438

significantly on d4 and slowly recovered towards the control levels on d14. By comparison, in

439

the influenza virus-infected group, levels of most metabolites approached that of the control

440

group more rapidly (Figure 6d).

Discussion

459

The current study sought to predict COVID-19 disease severity based on the metabolic profiles

460

of human plasma samples obtained early in the disease course, prior to the onset of critical

461

illness. We applied untargeted metabolomics to profile a patient cohort of 341 individuals, which

462

amounted to over 700 study samples in addition to QC and method blanks. In these samples, we

463

putatively identified 235 polar metabolites and 472 lipid metabolite species. Using these

464

metabolites, we applied machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can

465

accurately classify a patient’s disease severity from their day 0 metabolic profile obtained at the

466

time of initial hospital admission. This differentiating power may be critical in the coming

467

months as SARS-CoV-2 infections continue to rise and hospital resources for treating severe

468

disease become increasingly more limited. Due to insufficient availability, for example,

469

casirivimab and imdevimab are currently only indicated for the treatment of patients who are at

470

high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 (2020a). At this time, risk assessment is based on

471

BMI and age (FDA, 2020). Even though we see a significant difference between the age of the

472

non-severe and severe disease group (p<0.0001), the results of this study show that risk

473

assessment based on our 25 predictor metabolites is more reliable than age and BMI and

474

therefore provides a better metric for resource allocation.

475

Our linear ElasticNet model is relatively simple compared to other popular ML models,

476

including artificial neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), or ensemble based

477

approaches such as random forest (RF) that have been applied to metabolomics datasets

478

previously (Mendez et al., 2019). However, linear models can be easily interpreted and provide

479

robust performance (Mendez et al., 2019; Zou and Hastie, 2005). Indeed, a previous study

480

(Overmyer et al., 2020) successfully used an ElasticNet model to predict disease severity from a

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.05.21251173; this version posted February 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

481

multi-omic dataset. A limitation of the ElasticNet approach is that it is a linear model and most

482

biological systems are innately non-linear. Other studies have used non-linear ML models such

483

as RF to predict disease severity from metabolomics, lipidomics, and/or proteomics profiles

484

(Fraser et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020). Although these studies found higher AUC scores than that

485

of our model, they used considerably smaller patient cohorts than what our model was trained

486

and evaluated on. When we tested non-linear models (RF and SVM), we found worse cross-

487

validated performance than ElasticNet (see Figure S3a). Another challenge we faced in building

488

a model of disease severity is that the size of our study required normalizing metabolic profiles

489

acquired in multiple batches. We demonstrated that ComBat normalization was able to remove

490

the variance resulting from these batch effects. In removing this variance, however, true

491

biological variation was undoubtedly removed. Despite these limitations, our model still

492

accurately predicted patient disease severity.

493

Interpretation of our model led us to identify 25 robust predictor metabolites whose identities

494

were rigorously confirmed. Using this reduced predictor set, we were able to retrain our model

495

and found similarly strong predictive ability. Our large sample size that included longitudinal

496

measurements of patient plasma and collection of patient metadata (laboratory values,

497

comorbidities, and demographics) allowed us to uniquely validate the relationship of these 25

498

metabolites to COVID-19 disease severity. Further, we confirmed the relevance of these

499

metabolites to the pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection by using an established

500

animal model of COVID-19. It is important to point out that the 25 metabolites we discovered to

501

predict disease severity can be readily measured by using targeted methods on triple quadrupole

502

mass spectrometers that are widely available in most clinical laboratories. Thus, the test we

503

present here to assess the risk of a severe case of COVID-19 does not require intensive

Methods

508

Study design

509

Over the period of March to August of 2020, blood specimens of 341 individuals who

510

presented at Barnes Jewish Hospital or Christian Hospital located in Saint Louis, Missouri, USA

511

were collected. Inclusion criteria were a physician-ordered SARS-CoV-2-PCR test with a

512

positive or negative outcome, availability of gender and age information, and an age greater than

513

18. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Samples were collected at the

514

time of enrollment (d0), which was during or immediately following presentation at the hospital,

515

and 3, 7, 14, 28, or 84 days post hospital presentation. Clinically relevant medical information

516

(e.g., patient-reported symptoms, date of symptom-onset, age, race, and BMI) was collected at

517

the time of enrollment from the subject, their legally authorized representative, or the medical

518

record.

519

Metabolomics sample preparation

520

Participant plasma, which had been stored at -80 °C upon collection, was thawed on ice. A

521

50 µL aliquot was transferred onto the solid-phase-extraction (SPE)-system CAPTIVA-EMR

522

Lipid 96-wellplate (Agilent Technologies) before addition of 250 µL of acetonitrile containing

523

1% formic acid (v/v) and 10 µM internal standard (consisting of uniformly 13C and 15N labeled

524

amino acids from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc). The samples were mixed for 1 min at

525

360 rpm on an orbital shaker at room temperature prior to a 10 min incubation period at 4 °C.

526

Afterwards, 200 µL 80% acetonitrile in water (v/v) were added to the samples. The samples were

527

mixed on an orbital shaker (360 rpm) for an additional 10 min at room temperature. The samples

528

were then eluted into a 96-deepwell collection plate by centrifugation (10 min, 57 x g, 4 °C

529

followed by 2 min, 1000 x g, 4 °C). Polar eluates were stored at -80 °C until the day of LC/MS

530

analysis.

531

The SPE-plates were then washed twice with 500 µL 80% acetonitrile in water (v/v). Lipids

532

still bound to the SPE-material were then released into a second elution plate, in two elution

533

steps applying 2x 500 µL 1:1 methyl tert-butyl ether:methanol (v/v) onto the SPE cartridge and

534

centrifuging for 2 min at 1000 g and 4 °C. The combined eluates were dried under a stream of

535

nitrogen (Biotage SPE Dry Evaporation System) at room temperature and reconstituted with 100

536

µL 1:1 2-propanol:methanol (v/v) prior to LC/MS analysis.

537

Hamster plasma samples were diluted 1:4 with methanol (v/v), vortexed for 30 seconds and

538

incubated at -20°C for 2 hours. Samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13,500 x g at 4°C

539

and supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge tube, concentrated, and stored at -80°C until

540

reconstitution as described above.

541

LC/MS analysis of polar metabolites

542

An aliquot of 2 µL of polar metabolite extract was subjected to LC/MS analysis by using an

543

Agilent 1290 Infinity II liquid-chromatography (LC) system coupled to an Agilent 6540

544

Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer with a dual Agilent Jet Stream

545

electrospray ionization source. Polar metabolites were separated on a SeQuant® ZIC®-pHILIC

546

column (100 x 2.1 mm, 5 µm, polymer, Merck-Millipore) including a ZIC®-pHILIC guard

547

column (2.1 mm x 20 mm, 5 µm). The column compartment temperature was maintained at 40

548

°C and the flow rate was set to 250 µL×min-1. The mobile phases consisted of A: 95% water, 5%

549

acetonitrile, 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.1% ammonium hydroxide solution (25%

558

922.0890 for positive ion mode and m/z 119.0363 and 966.0007 for negative ion mode. Samples

559

were randomized prior to analysis. In addition, a quality control sample was injected after every

560

12th sample to monitor signal stability of the instrument.

LC/MS analysis of lipid metabolites

562

An aliquot of 2 µL of lipid extract was subjected to LC/MS analysis by using an Agilent

563

1290 Infinity II LC-system coupled to an Agilent 6545 Q-TOF mass spectrometer with a dual

HSS T3 column (2.1 x 150 mm, 1.8 µm) including an Acquity UPLC® HSS T3 VanGuard Pre-

566

Column (2.1 x 5mm, 1.8 µm) at a temperature of 60 °C and a flow rate of 250 µL×min-1. The

Data preprocessing and normalization

581

Polar metabolite identifications were supported by matching the retention time, accurate

582

mass, and MS/MS fragmentation data to our in-house retention time and MS/MS library created

583

from authentic reference standards (Mass Spectrometry Metabolite Library supplied by IROA

584

Technologies, Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and online MS/MS libraries (Human

585

Metabolome Database (HMDB, https://hmdb.ca, (Wishart et al., 2018)), Mass Bank of North

586

America (MoNA, https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/, (Horai et al., 2010)), and mzCloud

587

(https://mzcloud.org). Lipid iterative MS/MS data were annotated with the Agilent Lipid

588

Annotator software. All data files were then analyzed in Skyline (Version 20.1.0.155) to obtain

589

peak areas. m/z values of the metabolite and lipid target lists obtained from the metabolite

under consideration of retention times.

592

Due to the risk of handling plasma samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and not

593

knowing how many batches of samples we would receive, we refrained from preparing a pooled

594

sample and instead used the NIST SRM 1950 plasma reference material as quality control (QC)

sample in each batch. The QC sample was injected after every 12th sample. After peak area

596

extraction, batch effects were observed in the research samples (see Figure S2a). The research

597

samples and QC data were used to test typical batch normalization methods (see Figure S2b)

598

including constant sum, unit length, scale, percentile shift, minimum-maximum, PQN, quantile

599

and ComBat correction used in metabolomics (Chong et al., 2018; Di Guida et al., 2016;

600

Fernández-Albert et al., 2014; Ghosh, 2017; Johnson et al., 2007). In Figure S2b, the variance

601

remaining in the research samples normalized to the variance in the QC samples is shown for

602

each method. The higher this ratio, the more variance remains in the research samples and the

603

more batch derived variance in the QC samples is reduced. ComBat correction outperformed the

604

other batch correction approaches tested using this metric. After correction, samples are well

605

clustered according to sample type (WU-350, QC, blank) as shown in Figure S2c. Importantly,

606

within the research samples, there is no clustering by batch (see Figure S2d).

607

Animal Studies

608

All studies were performed at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Outbred female LVG golden

609

Syrian hamsters were sourced from Charles River Laboratories (Kingston, NY). The hamsters

610

were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine and xylazine prior to

611

intranasal inoculation with 0.1 mL of 1e5 plaque-forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 (WA-1)

612

or H1N1 influenza A virus (A/California/04/2009). On day 2, 4, 6, and 14 days post-infection, 3-

613

6 anesthetized hamsters per infection group were euthanized by exsanguination followed by

614

intracardiac injection of veterinary euthanasia solution (SleepAway; Fort Dodge). Plasma

615

samples were treated by exposure to germicidal UV-C light.

Study Approval

618

Portions of the human study relevant to Barnes Jewish Hospital, Christian Hospital, and

619

Washington University were reviewed and approved by the Washington University in Saint

620

Louis Institutional Review Board (WU-350 study approval #202003085, and plasma

621

metabolomics study approval #202004204). All animal studies were approved by the

622

Institutional Care and Use Committee at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, following the humane

623

care and use guidelines set by the institution.

624

Machine Learning

625

Samples were split into two distinct cohorts for training and testing the ML model. D0

626

COV+ patient samples within batches 1-6 made up the training set and d0 COV+ patient samples

627

from batches 7 through 9 made up the test set. Training and tests sets were treated independently

628

except for batch normalization which was carried out for all patients (including samples

629

collected after d0 and COV- samples) together. Demographics of both training and tests sets are

630

available in Table S1 and Table S2.

631

Model selection was based on 20-fold cross validation of the training set. Five different ML

632

models: logistic regression, ElasticNet linear regression, partial least squares discriminant

633

analysis (PLSDA), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest were selected for

634

consideration based on interpretability and previous studies (Fraser et al., 2020; Lalmuanawma et

635

al., 2020; Mendez et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2020). Hyperparameters of all models and feature

636

selection strategies were optimized using 20-fold cross validation and a grid search. Two

637

separate feature selection strategies were tested: a correlation-based approach and a statistic-

638

based approach. In the correlation-based approach, the Pearson correlation was computed

639

between each metabolite’s intensity and the disease severity. Then, the top 𝑋% of metabolites

640

sorted by absolute correlation were taken as the predictors for the ML model. In the statistic-

641

based approach, a student’s t-test was performed to assess the statistical significance of the

642

differences in each metabolite’s intensity between COV+ severe and COV+ non-severe patients.

643

Absolute fold-change and p-value cutoffs were used to select metabolites. Performance was

644

assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). After

645

optimization, ElasticNet regression achieved the highest AUC on the cross validated training

646

dataset. The ElasticNet model is given below in Equation 1 where 𝑋 is matrix of metabolic

647

profiles (# of samples x # of metabolites), 𝑏 is the bias term, 𝑦 is the sample labels (0 = COV+

648

non-severe, 1 = COV+ severe), 𝑤 is the weight of each metabolite to the model prediction, 𝛼 is

649

the weight of the regularization, and 𝜌 is the mixing parameter between the 𝑙! and 𝑙" norm

650

regularization.

652

After optimization, the correlation-based feature selection was used taking the top 33% most

653

correlated metabolites with model hyperparameters 𝛼 = 10.0 and 𝜌 = 0.0. In the reduced

654

predictor model, no feature selection was performed and model hyperparameters 𝛼 = 1.0 and

655

𝜌 = 0.0 were used.

The variable importance of each metabolite in the ElasticNet model is easily computed from

657

the optimized weights, 𝑤. To normalize for the different abundances of the metabolites, each

658

weight was normalized by the median abundance of the metabolite across all samples. The more

659

positive the variable importance, the more predictive that metabolite is to severe disease. The

660

more negative the variable importance, the more predictive the metabolite is to non-severe

661

disease. To find the metabolites that significantly contribute to the model fit, the training dataset

662

was resampled with replacement 10,000 times. At each iteration, the ElasticNet model was

663

trained and the variable importance was calculated. After the iterations were complete, the 95%

664

confidence interval of the variable importance was calculated for each metabolite using the 2.5

665

and 97.5 percentiles. If this interval included zero, the metabolite did not significantly contribute

666

to the model fit.

667

All ML analyses were carried out using Python (v3.7) with extensive use of the packages

668

SciPy (v1.4.1) (Virtanen et al., 2020a) and Scikit-learn (v0.23.1) (Pedregosa et al., 2011).

Data availability

673

The raw LC/MS data as well as the processed metabolic profiles and their corresponding

674

deidentified metadata for the human and animal samples will be made publicly available on the

675

Metabolomics Workbench repository.

676

Statistical analysis

677

All statistical analyses were performed using the SciPy (v1.4.1) (Virtanen et al., 2020b) and

678

statsmodels (v0.11.1) (Seabold and Perktold, 2010) Python packages and with the Mass Profiler

679

Professional Software (Agilent Technologies, v15.5). All p-values were corrected for multiple

680

hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

681

Permutation test

682

To assess the significance of the model fit and compare the predictive power to what is

683

expected from random chance, we performed a permutation test. After the feature selection and

684

model hyperparameters were optimized, the training dataset labels were permuted, and the model

685

was retrained on the permuted data. Then, the performance of this model was assessed on the

686

non-permuted test set and the AUC was computed. This process was repeated 1,000 times. The

687

empirical p-value was computed by calculating the percentage of the 1,000 permutations that

688

achieved an AUC higher than that of the model’s performance when trained on non-permuted

689

data.

690

Confirming metabolite identities of predictor metabolites

691

The identities of the 25 predictor metabolites were rigorously confirmed with authentic

692

standards. For the polar compounds, authentic standards were purchased to not only match

693

MS/MS but also retention times for identification. For lipids, one or two standards per lipid class

694

were matched to an authentic standard to compare MS/MS spectra and retention times. PCs were

695

identified based on m/z and the two characteristic fragments 184.0733 and 86.0964 in positive

696

ionization mode. For PCs where no peaks for the acyl-chains were observed, only the sum

697

composition can be given. LPE 18:0 was matched to its authentic standard based on retention

698

time and MS/MS spectra. PEs were identified based on the neutral loss of

699

phosphorylethanolamine (141.0191) in positive mode. The fatty acyl composition could be

700

derived from the spectra, but no differentiation of regioisomers was possible, as was the case for

701

ceramides. To denote regiospecificity, metabolites whose regioisomers could be differentiated

702

have their acyl-chains are separated with a “/” while those that could not have a “_”. Cer-NS

703

d18:1_16:0 was matched to its authentic standard. Cer-NS d18:2_16:0 matched the MS/MS

704

library spectrum and eluted slightly before Cer-NS d18:1_16:0 as expected due to having one

705

less double bond. LPCs were identified based on MS/MS spectral matches. Standards were

706

available for LPC 14:0/0:0 and LPC 18:1/0:0. Their retention times were used as a reference for

707

the other LPCs. The two regioisomers of LPCs (sn1 and sn2) were separated by liquid

708

chromatography, with the sn1 isomer eluting later. They are also distinguished by their MS/MS

709

spectra. 1-acyl-LPC (sn1) shows two main fragments (m/z 184.0733 and 104.1070), whereas the

710

2-acyl-LPC (sn2) has a more pronounced 184.0733 fragment. The 104.1070 fragment (choline)

711

has been previously reported as being more abundant from LPCs with the fatty acid chain in the

712

sn1 position from the sodium adducts when studying the lysophospholipid regioisomers (Han

713

and Gross, 1996). We note that sn2 LPCs can be converted to sn1 during sample preparation, and

714

our sample preparation was not dedicated to preserve those isomers (Koistinen et al., 2015;

715

Okudaira et al., 2014).

716

Acquiring MS/MS data

717

MS/MS spectra for polar metabolites were acquired on an Orbitrap ID-X Tribrid mass

718

spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). A Vanquish Horizon UHPLC system, with the same

719

chromatographic conditions as described in the Methods, was interfaced with the mass

720

spectrometer via electrospray ionization in both positive and negative mode with a spray voltage

721

of 3.5 and 2.8 kV, respectively. The RF lens value was 35%. Data were acquired in data

722

dependent acquisition (DDA) mode using the built-in deep scan option (AcquireX) with a mass

723

range of 67-900 m/z. MS/MS scans were acquired at 15K resolution on a NIST SRM 1950

724

plasma sample from and 4 individual samples from d0, d3, d7, and d14 in both positive and

725

negative polarity with different collision energies in the range of 20 NCE to 50 NCE for HCD

726

and 30 NCE for CID to maximize identifications.

727

MS/MS spectra for polar metabolites and lipids were acquired using an iterative approach in

728

the MassHunter Acquisition Software (Version 10.1.48, Agilent Technologies) on an Agilent

729

6540 and 6545 QTOF respectively. The same source settings as for MS1 data acquisition were

used. MS/MS spectra were acquired at a scan rate of 3 spectra/s with different intensity

731

thresholds and collision energies of 10, 20, and 40 V to increase identification rates.
