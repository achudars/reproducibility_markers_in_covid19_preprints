Abstract
In the first trimester 2020, a significant number of countries implemented general lockdowns
of their populations to contain the quickly expanding SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and avoid major
saturation of health care capacity. Understanding how these unprecedented measures
impacted population behaviour and contact patterns is key to predict more accurately the
health, social and economic impacts of such extreme actions if they were to be applied to
future outbreaks. We set up an online survey to measure how the lockdown affected social
contact patterns in France, and collected information from 42,036 participants aged 18 years
and over between April 10 and April 28, 2020. Among the participants who normally worked
outside home prior to the lockdown (72% of the survey population), 68% reported that they
had moved to working from home and 17% reported being unemployed during the lockdown.

Only 2% of participants used public transport during lockdown, as opposed to 37% before it.
Participants reported increased frequency of washing hands, switch in greeting behaviour,
but generally limited use of masks outside home. 138,934 contacts were reported, with an
average 3.3 contacts per individual per day (1.7 for individuals aged >65 years old compared
to 3.6 for younger age-groups). This represented a 70% reduction compared with previous
surveys, consistent with reductions in transmission rates measured during the lockdown.
Contacts in workplaces, shops, and transports on the previous day were respectively
reported in only 11%, 31% and 0.5% of the participants. For those who maintained a
professional activity outside home, the frequency of contacts at work dropped by 79%. This
study shows that the lockdown dramatically affected population’s behavior, work, risk
perception and contact patterns. Both frequency and heterogeneity of contacts were
affected, impacting potential important features of virus dissemination. Such surveys are
essential to evaluate more accurately the impact of past or future lockdowns and anticipate
epidemic dynamics in these conditions.
Introduction
Following its discovery in Wuhan province in China in December 2019, the virus SARS-CoV2 has quickly spread around the world. On March 17th 2020, the French government
implemented a lockdown of its population to attempt to contain the quickly expanding
epidemic and avoid a saturation of health care capacity. This lockdown consisted of a set of
interventions including school closures (schools remained open for children of healthcare
and other essential workers), closure of universities, restaurants, non-essential shops and
most workplaces. A move to working from home was promoted where possible. Outdoor
physical exercise was restricted to no more than 1 hour a day and no further than 1km from
home. To help ensure compliance, individuals had to fill in a form each time they got out,
stating the purpose of their journey out of a limited list of possible options.
Understanding how these unprecedented measures impacted population behaviour and
contact patterns is important to better describe SARS-COV-2 transmission dynamics during
the lockdown period. On the one hand what truly matters for transmission are the social,
cultural and behavioural responses to disease, public communications (through official or
media channels) or strict measures (1,2). Mathematical models used for outbreak
predictions usually rely on empirical data describing the rate at which individuals mix with
each other according to age. Although such data is available from surveys performed in
multiple countries in a non epidemic situation(3)(4)(5)(6), depicting contact patterns during
lockdown is crucial.
Methods
Survey
We set up SocialCov, an online survey to record social contact patterns and behaviours
within the French population. The survey was advertised on social networks (including posts
on Facebook and Twitter), messaging platforms (WhatsApp), emails, and the Institut Pasteur
website. All users over 18 years old were invited to fill in the questionnaire. Information
collected included socio demographic information : age, sex, usual place of residence,
number and age of usual household members and employment characteristics, then
whether changes occured in the place of residence, household composition and employment
status during the lockdown.

Participants also reported information about their contacts and their contacts’ characteristics,
including the age of the individual and the place of contact (work, transportation, medical
appointment, sport practices, shopping, assistance to a person in need) on the previous day.
A contact was defined as either a physical contact (e.g. a kiss or a handshake), or a close
contact (e.g. face to face conversation at less than 1 meter). Data regarding childcare
arrangements, lifestyle habits (shopping frequency, mode of transport, etc), and individual
protective behaviours (hand washing, mask wearing, etc) were also collected. Participants
were asked to provide this information for the previous day, which was during lockdown, and
on a typical day before the lockdown.
Data were collected in accordance with the regulation in force in France for the protection
and security of personal data. Aggregated data is accessible online (link here). The complete
dataset can be provided on demand, subject to prior determination of the terms and
conditions of the request and in respect for the compliance with the applicable regulation.
Statistical methods
We analysed data collected between April 10 and April 28, 2020. We grouped study
participants and contacts into the following age groups: 18-20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-35, 36-40,
41-45, 46-50, 51-55, 56-60, 61-65, 66-70, 71-75, 76-80, 81-85, 86-90, >90 and computed
descriptive statistics for the responses related to age, household, location, activity, and
individual preventative measures. We present either the distributions of numbers and
percentages or means and standard deviations as appropriate.
Contact matrices. We computed the average number of contacts per person per day
stratified by age group, gender, work activity and place of contact and built contact matrices.
For home matrices, all individuals of a household were considered as close contacts. For
other locations (work, shops, public transports), close contacts and age of contacts were
computed by summing those reported by the participant in the corresponding setting. Outlier
reports were defined as participants reporting more than 100 contacts per day or more than
30 contacts per day outside the work and household location. These outlier reports were
removed from the analysis. A global matrix, reporting the average total number of contacts
per day across ages, was also computed. In this matrix, for each age group, the average
number contacts was reweighted to account for gender and professional activity distributions
in the French population during lockdown.
Other source of data used for population correction
In order to limit bias due to the study design and potential lack of representativity of the study
population, estimates were corrected using metrics from the following data sources.
INSEE. Demographic data of the French population reported by the French National Institute
for statistics and economic studies (INSEE) was used to compute weighted estimates and
reproduce the age and sex distribution in the French population of those aged >18 year
old(7). Weighting was achieved for all estimates related to professional situation and
lockdown associated behaviours. No weighting was done to compute descriptive statistics
related to the survey population.

Covid 19 Barometer. Covid 19 Barometer is a separate survey from the non-profit
organisation DataCovid, which was carried out during the same period. In this survey,
weekly polls were administered on the internet by the company Ipsos with samples of 5,000
people representative of the French metropolitan population aged 18 and over established
by the quota method (see Supplementary Material section B for more details). Estimated
professional activity distributions by gender were used as a reference measure to compute
corrected estimates of the global matrix.
In the following, when presenting unweighted data, we use the term participant, when
weighted data, we use the term French population.
Comparison of contacts with pre-lockdown situation
We compare the frequency of contacts during the lockdown with a non-epidemic period,
using direct reports of participants from the SocialCov survey (the part related to their
contacts on a day preceding lockdown) and data from a previous survey in France, the
COMES-F (5).
Comparison with SocialCov pre-lockdown survey. Participants involved in the SocialCov
survey were also asked to fill an additional pre-lockdown survey and to depict their contact at
the workplace for a day preceding the national lockdown. A total of 35982 participants
completed this second questionnaire. We used the full dataset to compute the distribution of
the number of contacts. We considered only the participants that declared to work outside
home in the pre-lockdown period and during lockdown (3186 participants) to assess the
individual change between the number of contacts before and under the lockdown.
COMES-F survey. The COMES-F study was the first French large-scale population survey
performed by Ipsos in 2012 (5). The aim of the study was to describe the mixing pattern by
age in the French population. In total 2033 participants reported their contacts over 2 days,
one during the week day and one during weekends. To match and compare the two
datasets, individual contacts in SocialCov were censored at 40 daily contacts to comply with
COMES-F constraints. Also, only contacts during weekdays were considered for the
COMES-F survey. Censoring all contacts >40 generated a reduction of 0.2 in the average
number of contacts in our survey, from 3.3 without censoring to 3.1 with censoring.

Results
Population description
42,036 participants completed the full questionnaire between April 10 and April 28 (42,130 in
total and 94 were classified as abnormal reports), including 28,796 females and 13,240
males from across France (Figure S1A), with an average of 4.4 participants per 10,000
inhabitants (range from 0.89 per 10,000 in Haute Corse to 29.5 per 10,000 inhabitants in
Paris). The region of Paris Île de France, and departments of Doubs, Aude, Haute Garonne,
and Herault were over-represented, with >10 participants per 10,000 inhabitants (Figure
S1B, Table S1). Half of the participants were <45 years old and 13% were >65 years. The
number of household contacts was the highest for participants aged 18-20, subsequently
dropping for those in their 20s and increasing again to a second peak for individuals in their

late 40s (Figure S1C). Participants >60 years old only had about 1 household contact on
average. 37% of participants declared being locked down with children (<18 years old) in the
household. Only 2.5% of participants aged >60 years old declared a contact aged <18 years
old at home, compared with an average of 77% for those aged 41-45 (Figure S1E).

A major drop in contact frequency even for the more connected individuals
In total, 138,934 contacts were reported, representing an average number of contacts of
3.30 per day (median = 2 range [0-99] daily contacts) per participant after removing outlier
reports. Individuals aged >65 years old reported on average 1.67 contact per day compared
with 3.55 contacts per day for those aged <65 years old (Figure 1A). These estimates are
70% (range: 61%-76%) lower than those measured in the COMES-F survey performed in
France in 2012 (Figure 1A) (5).
Most participants declared working from home during lockdown (N=22,327) or being
unemployed or retired (N=15,142). 4,567 (11%) participants reported contacts at work;
12,967 (31%) contacts in shops; and only 203 (0.5%) contacts in public transports. Finally,
12,325 (29%) participants reported contacts in other places, which included medical
appointments, physical activity and visits/assistance to relatives in need but with a much
lower intensity than in other settings. The average number of daily contacts in each setting is
shown on Figure 1B. The density of contacts was the highest at work, with the average
number of contacts ranging 6-10 depending on the age group. It was much lower in other
settings, with between 0 and 2 contacts per day on average.
Critically, the proportion of individuals with a higher number of contacts markedly decreased
during the lockdown (Figure 1C). Specifically, only 4.9% of the participants aged 18-60 years
old reported more than 10 contacts per day compared to >35% in the COMES-F study (5).
This percentage decreased to 1.7% among the elderly in our sample while it was 18.8% in
the COMES-F study. Similarly, among those who maintained their professional activity
outside home, the intensity of contacts at the workplace was reduced by 79% between the
week preceding the lockdown and the lockdown period, with a distribution shifting towards
lower values, approaching zero in the majority of cases during the lockdown (Figure 1D).

In addition to contacts of study participants, some information on children’s contacts within
and outside the household were available through participants’ reports. All in all, during
lockdown, the vast majority of children's contacts occurred in the household. Indeed, only
5% of participants with children had their children cared for outside home, with school or
nursery attendance reported only by 2% of participants. Only 3.4% (N=508) of the children
for which contact information was reported had contacts with children that were not
household members (Figure S6), with an average of 2.5 contacts per day. This represents a
drastic decrease compared with previous surveys (5).
The total number of daily reported contacts also varied between geographic areas. In
departments with >500 participants, the average number of daily contacts varied between
2.7 (95%CI 2.4-3.0) in Alpes-Maritimes, and 4.4 (95%CI 3.8-5.0) in Seine-Maritime.
Participants from geographic areas with higher densities generally reported higher
frequencies of contacts outside home and work (Figure S7, r2= 0.48).
Lockdown affected population behavior
Consistent with studies of mobility (8, 9), we identify a pattern of migrations from big cities to
other confinement locations at the time when the lockdown was implemented. In our survey,
Paris was by far the area that exhibited the highest level of migration, with about 20% of
participants from Paris declaring being in another department during the lockdown (Figure
2A), predominantly in the West and South East of France (Figure 2B). Of interest,
participants from Paris who declared being in a different geographic area, reported a lower
frequency of contacts outside home than the ones who stayed in Paris (Figure S8).

population. Approximately 60% of the population used to go shopping >2 times a week in
normal times, whereas only 14% went under the lockdown. Interestingly, 19% did not visit
any shops at all in the preceding week (Figure 3A).
The outbreak and lockdown strongly affected risk perception and health-associated
behaviours in the population. >60% of the population declared that their perception of the
risk associated with the outbreak had changed following the start of the lockdown (Table
S2). Only 1.5% declared perceiving no risk associated with the outbreak and more than
80% of the population reported a perceived risk for themselves and their relatives (Table
S2). In terms of barrier measures, the percentage of the French population washing their
hands more than 6 times a day increased from 36% prior to the lockdown to >75% under the
lockdown (Figure 3C). Greeting behaviour was also strongly modified, with an estimated
95% of the population not greeting anyone outside the household physically (kissing or
shaking hands), compared with only ~6% before the lockdown (Figure 3B). While 47% of the
population declared not systematically using masks outside home, 57% would wear one at
home if symptomatic (Table S2). Finally, 81% of the population declared that they would not
physically attend a non urgent medical appointment: 48% would cancel the appointment and
32% would use telemedicine (Table S2).

Lockdown-associated unemployment and telework
After correction for population demographics, we estimate that during the lockdown, 44.2%
of the French population older than 18 years old were unemployed or retired (compared to
33.9% before the lockdown), 46.7% worked from home (compared to 3.7% before the
lockdown) and 9.1% worked outside home (compared to 62.3% before the lockdown)
(Figure S2A-B). We estimate that among French people who normally work outside home,
68.4% switched to telework and 16.8% became unemployed or retired (Figure S2C).

Age-stratified matrices show little cross- generation mixing of the elderly
Using participants’ reports of their contacts across age-groups, we built age-stratified contact
matrices for each setting. The resulting home matrix is highly assortative by age group with a
strong interaction term between parents and children (Figure 4A). In contrast, the contacts at
work or in shops had little age structure (Figure 4 B-C), with an average number of daily
contacts of 7.9 at work and 1.3 in shops for those who reported such contacts the previous
day. The average number of contacts in public transport was low (computed based on 203
reporting participants only) with an average of 1.7 contacts per day and representing a very
small fraction of the total number of contacts within the population (Figure 4E). Finally, the
weighted global matrix depicts a higher density of within age group contacts and betweengeneration family-like contacts, consistent with previous findings. Of interest, individuals
aged >65 years old had very limited contacts with the youngest age groups (<20) and had
on average 50% less daily contacts than age groups 30-55 (Figure 1 and 4F).

The SocialCov study reveals a strong impact of the lockdown on social patterns and
behaviours in France, with over 40,000 responses from diverse ages and coming from all
across France.
A drastic drop in contacts in all ages was observed, even in individuals who maintained a
professional activity outside home. Notably, both the mean and the dispersion of contacts
were affected. The tail of the distribution of the daily number of contacts was strongly
diminished, with less than 5% of the participants reporting more than 10 contacts per day.
Recent publications suggest a key role of superspreading events in the SARS-Cov2
outbreak(11). In general, decreasing the number of contacts in the most active part of the
population might have led to fewer super spreading events and less virus diffusion.
A majority of our participants declared that they would either cancel a planned medical
appointment or use telemedicine rather than attending in person. This reduction in care
seekings contributed to a 51% reduction in consultations with specialized physicians (12), a
40% reduction in general practice consultations (French National health Insurance), and
48% reduction in emergency department admissions. This was also observed among
individuals affected with chronic disease where 51% of the respondents declared they
cancelled at least one medical appointment and 16% reported using telemedicine services
(13). Estimating the indirect health burden associated with the lockdown will be critical in the
coming months.
Only a small proportion of participants reported using protective masks outside home. These
relatively small numbers may have been impacted by the limited availability of masks to the
general population during the study period, when mask sales and distribution were restricted
to healthcare professionals. It is expected that mask-associated behaviour changes with
increasing availability of masks in the community and increased recommendation of using
them.
A proportion of participants reported being locked down in a different department than their
home department (Figure 2). This was particularly significant for participants living in big
cities such as Paris (20%) or Lyon (10%). Our results are consistent with the analysis of
mobile phone data indicating that 11% of the registered residents and 23% of the total
number of people present in Paris the night before the lockdown moved to another location
(9). Political elections took place in France on the weekend preceding the implementation of
the general lockdown which could have led some individuals from Paris (eg. student or other
non-official residents) to travel back to their original region to vote. This phenomenon might
also be related to pre-lockdown travel that was also observed in other countries such as
China (from Wuhan to other regions), Italy (from the North to the South)(14), Spain (from
Madrid to other regions)(15) where people moved to their second residences or hometowns
to avoid being quarantined in the city prior to the implementation of lockdown.
The estimated decrease in contact intensity is consistent with estimates from other studies in
Europe(16), in the UK, Jarvis and colleagues reported a 74% reduction in the average daily
number of contacts, with an average 2.8 contacts per day from 1356 participants in the UK
(17). Similar reductions were observed in China, from 636 study participants in Wuhan, and
557 participants in Shanghai, where the average number of daily contacts was estimated at

2, representing a reduction of 7-8-fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with
most interactions restricted to the household (18).
The data and results presented here should be considered in the light to the following
limitations. First, participants were recruited online. As a consequence, the study population
may not be a representative sample of the French population. First, as frequently observed
in this type of studies, two third of survey participants were women. However, the work
situation (Figure S9) and contact matrices (Figure S10) did not differ significantly between
males and females. In order to reproduce more accurately lockdown-associated behaviors in
the French population, statistics were reweighted according to the age and sex
demographics of that population. The distribution of household sizes in the weighted
population (Figure S3) globally matched the one reported by INSEE in 2019 (19).
The survey population is probably also over-represented by employees, executives and
generally individuals working at home. It also excluded populations less connected to social
networks, smartphones or internet. For example, >65 years old individuals represented only
13% of our population while they account for 20% of the French population. We estimate
that during the lockdown 53% of French people worked from home, an estimate substantially
higher than estimates from other sources (Direction de l’animation de la recherche des
études et des statistiques, DARES or the Covid 19 Barometre, which estimated respectively
25% and 15% of telework). In order to bypass this overrepresentation, the global contact
matrix was computed by weighting according to gender and professional status (telework,
unemployed, retired) estimated from the Covid 19 Barometre.
This article provides novel data on social patterns during a strict lockdown. Following
lockdown relaxing and school and workplaces reopening, intermediate and progressive
changes in behaviour and social patterns are expected to have happened. Monitoring
contacts, risk perception and behaviours following the ease of the restrictions will be key to
assess the dynamics of contact patterns over time. In low and middle income countries, very
little data related to social mixing in the community are available. These data are all the more
needed to analyse the spread of the virus and the impact of interventions in these countries
where social distancing and barrier gestures are potentially more difficult to implement and
health care capacity, particularly intensive care, is limited. The set up and extension of
similar surveys in the coming weeks and months will be critical.
From this survey, we estimated that the lockdown in France led to major reductions of social
mixing across all age-groups, compatible with the estimated important decrease in
reproduction number (20). The resulting matrices and data can be directly plugged into
mathematical models of human-human transmission of SARS-Cov2. They may also be
useful to model and evaluate the impact of lockdowns in future epidemic waves of SARSCoV-2 or in future pandemics. Monitoring how contact patterns and at-risk contacts evolve
over time will be key to anticipate the dynamics of the virus in the coming weeks and
months.
