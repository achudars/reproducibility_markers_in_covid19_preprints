Abstract
It is currently unknown whether acquired immunity to common alpha- and beta-coronaviruses
provides cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we found that certain patient
sera and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) collected prior to the COVID-19 outbreak were
cross-reactive to SARS-CoV-2 full-length Spike, S2 domain, and Nucleocapsid. However,
their presence did not translate into neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Importantly, we detected serum IgG reactivity to common coronaviruses in the early sera of
patients with severe COVID-19 before the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
Collectively, the results of our study indicate that pre-existing immunity to common
coronaviruses does not confer cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.
Main
The ongoing pandemic related to SARS-CoV2 has demonstrated significant
heterogeneity across global populations, as well as differing levels of infection severity1. In
addition to these unexplained variations, children and young adults especially seem to be
better protected from the severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). For this
reason, it has been hypothesised that any past infections or immunisations related to the
common alpha-coronavirus HCoV-NL-63 and -229-E and beta-coronavirus HCoV-OC-43
and -HK-U1 could lead to cross-protection against SARS-CoV-22-5, although crossneutralising antibody responses were until now never reported.
In order to test this hypothesis, we first analysed the sera of 76 healthy French donors
(48 males; 28 females; median age of 39 years; age range 19-65, supplementary table 1)
drawn in 2015. Although we did not detect anti-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) reactivity
in these European individuals, we found that six serological samples (7.9%) were reactive to
one or several of the others SARS-COV2 antigens (S2 domain, full-length Spike, and/or
Nucleocapsid). Moreover, these sera also randomly recognized all common coronaviruses,
which indicated that pre-COVID cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens was neither
specific to a unique family nor a type of coronavirus (Figure 1a). From a humoral immunity
perspective, we also assessed the immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity of intravenous
immunoglobulins (IVIG) manufactured prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. This was important
because therapeutic IVIG consists of IgG isolated from about 10 000 pooled plasma samples
of healthy donors. Hence, these products could be a useful indicator of any pre-existing
humoral response of the general population6. Our investigation into the IgG reactivity of three
different batches of IVIG demonstrated high reactivity towards all common coronaviruses, as
well as detectable reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 S2 domain and full-length Spike but not to

Nucleocapsid (Figure 1b). Collectively, the results indicate that pre-COVID cross-reactivity
to SARS-CoV-2 antigens is not rare in the general population.
Furthermore, to determine whether such cross-reactivity was bidirectional (i.e.
originating from SARS-CoV-2 but reacting to common coronaviruses too), we sequentially
analysed the sera of eight severe COVID-19 patients (clinical features in Supplementary
Table 2) for their IgG reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 and common coronaviruses (Figure 1c).
Indeed, we observed a parallel increase in IgG antibody titers directed towards SARS-CoV-2
antigens and the beta-coronaviruses HCoV-OC-43 and HCoV-HK-U1. However, no increase
in responses to alpha-coronavirus was identified. These IgG responses to common betacoronaviruses were more likely due to cross-reactivity and not because of ongoing infection
related to other coronaviruses because the nasopharyngeal RT-PCR of our patients was
specifically positive for SARS-CoV-2 and negative for all other common coronaviruses
(Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, the early sera from all patients but one showed
reactivity to beta-coronaviruses HCoV-OC-43 and HCoV-HK-U1, whereas the early sera
from two patients also recognized alpha-coronaviruses HCoV-NL-63 and HCoV-229-E.
Importantly, these responses were present before the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibodies (Figure 1c). Collectively, these data indicate that pre-existing immunity to
common coronaviruses did not prevent the onset of COVID-19 in these patients.
In order to experimentally confirm that pre-existing cross-reactivity did not lead to
cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assessed the neutralising capacities of the
six pre-COVID-19 sera reactive for SARS-CoV-2 antigens and of the three IVIG batches
using an in vitro whole SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. In COVID-19, whilst full
neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 is observed with sera containing anti-RBD antibodies, none is
observed using earlier serum devoid of detectable anti-RBD antibodies7,8.
This effect is best illustrated in Figure 1d with sera of Patient 5 being able to
neutralise SARS-CoV-2 when drawn 17 days after symptom onset but not at day 7. In
addition, we found that none of the pre-COVID-19 sera, nor IVIG batches were able to
neutralise the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. To ensure that no inhibitor, possibly
introduced during the IVIG manufacturing process, had interfered with any neutralising IgG
present in these preparations, we assessed the neutralising capacities of IgG isolated from
Patient 5 diluted with increasing volumes of IVIG. As shown in Figure 1e, purified IgG from
Patient 5 were able to potently neutralise even when diluted with IVIG. Indeed, the halfmaximal inhibitory concentrations IC50 of Patient 5 serum alone (11.67 µg/mL) or diluted
with IVIG (IVIG1: 9.94 µg/mL, IVIG2: 9.14 µg/mL, IVIG3: 10.15 µg/mL) were similar.

Collectively, these results confirm that IVIG products manufactured before the COVID-19
outbreak have no neutralising capabilities and that, on the contrary, the addition of
neutralising IgG from COVID-19 patients to IVIG preparations could confer such neutralising
capabilities. Since about 10 µg/mL of COVID-19 patient IgG are sufficient to neutralise 50%
of the viral cytopathic effect and 64 µg/mL to neutralise all of the viral cytopathic effect in the
presence of IVIG (Figure 1e), and since IVIG were tested for neutralisation at 12 mg/mL, we
can estimate that the presence of only 1 SARS-CoV-2-immunized individual out of 1200
donors (0.08 %) would have been sufficient to confer detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity,
while one such immunized individual out of 187.5 donors (0.5%) would have conferred
potent neutralising capacities to IVIG.
Overall, our results indicate that cross-reactivity does occur between common
coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. Cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2 has already been
observed with sera isolated from patients previously infected by SARS-CoV9. This crossprotection is well explained by the high homology between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
RBD. Whilst there are several homologous regions in the S2 domain between SARS-CoV-2
and common alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, that could account for the observed crossreactivity, there is no homology between SARS-CoV-2 and common alpha- and betacoronaviruses in the RBD regions4,10,11. Indeed, antibodies to the RBDs of common
coronaviruses are commonly detected in most adults but do not cross-react with the SARSCoV-2 RBD8. In this report, we confirm that pre-COVID-19 immunity to common
coronaviruses does not confer cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2. Variations between
common coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs are likely to be the reason why we did not
observe cross-protection from common alpha- and beta- coronavirus immunity against SARSCoV-2 in vivo and in vitro.
Finally, we also demonstrated that IVIG batches produced prior to the outbreak of
COVID-19 do not have neutralising capacities. Importantly, these preparations also did not
interfere with the SARS-CoV-2 neutralising capacity of serum IgG. This result suggests that
IVIG batches manufactured after the COVID-19 outbreak should not exclude donors that
have recovered from COVID-19, provided that they would not present potentially deleterious
anti-self reactivities or antibody-dependent SARS-CoV-2 enhancement activity12. It is
nevertheless important to consider that IVIG infusions were ineffective in non-COVID-19related SARS13. Similarly, no efficacy was yet demonstrated in treating COVID-19 patients
using plasma obtained from those that had recovered from the infection14. Hence, we consider
that IVIG batches manufactured during the current pandemic are unlikely to perform a

prophylactic, or as a preventive treatment in early COVID-19 infections instead.

Materials & Methods
Patient and healthy donor samples and IVIG batches
Collection of blood from anonymous healthy donors was carried out at the French Institute of
Blood Donation (EFS, Etablissement français du sang, Paris, France) in 2015 in line with
Local and Regional Ethics Committee “CPP - Ile de France- VI” at the Pitié-Salpêtrière
Hospital. The patient samples were collected from 8 COVID-19 patients referred to the
Department of Internal Medicine 2 at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris. Demographic and
clinical characteristics are detailed in Supplementary Table 2. All patients or their relatives
gave informed consent. This study was approved by the Local Ethical Committee of Sorbonne
Université (n°2020-CER2020-21). For all samples, sera were stored immediately after
collection at -80°C. Three batches of IVIG pharmaceutical products (TEGELINE, LFB;
CLAIRYG, LFB and PRIVIGEN, CSL BEHRING), manufactured before 2019 in France,
were assessed with a 12mg/mL IgG concentration.
Photonic ring immunoassay
SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies were measured with The Maverick TM SARS-CoV-2
Multi-Antigen Serology Panel (Genalyte Inc. USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The Maverick TM SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen Serology Panel (Genalyte Inc) is
designed to detect antibodies to five SARS-CoV-2 antigens; nucleocapsid, Spike S1 RBD,
Spike S1S2, Spike S2, and Spike S1, and common coronavirus HCoV-NL-63 Nucleocapsid,
HCoV-OC-43, HCoV-229-E and HCoV-HK-U1 Spike proteins within a multiplex format
based on photonic ring resonance technology15,16. This system detects and measures changes
in resonance when antibodies bind to their respective antigens on the chip. Threshold values
for positivity were set by the manufacturer. Raw data are available in Supplementary Tables
1 and 3.
Whole virus neutralisation test (VNT)
Neutralising activity of the different sera was tested with a whole virus replication assay for
which we used a SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from a COVID-19 patient at the PitiéSalpêtrière Hospital, Paris. This patient was confirmed positive by a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR
on March 6th, 2020, and the virus was isolated by inoculating Vero cells with a sputum sample
in our biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) facility. The serum samples were decomplemented by heat
inactivation (56°C for 30 min), 2-fold serially diluted (starting at 1:5 to 1:2560), and then preincubated on a 96-well plate with 50 µl of diluted virus (2.103 Fifty percent Tissue Culture
Infective Dose TCID50/mL) at 37°C for 60 min. Next, 100 µL of Vero E6 cells suspension
(3.105 cells/mL) was added to the mixture and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 until a

microscopic examination was performed on day 4 for the cytopathic effect (CPE).
Neutralisation antibody titers were expressed as the highest serum dilution that showed 100%
inhibition of CPE. A same positive serum was added to each experiment to assess the
reproducibility of the VNT.
Purification of IgG from serum
IgG were isolated from serum samples diluted in 1X-PBS as previously described17. Briefly,
serum samples were loaded onto Protein G/Agarose column (Invivogen) after column
equilibration. Chromatography steps were performed at a flow rate of 0.5ml/min. Next, 20
column volumes of 1X-PBS were used to wash the column. IgG were then eluted with 5ml of
0.1M glycine (pH 2-3, Sigma-Aldrich) and pH was immediately adjusted to 7.5 with 1M Tris.
1X-PBS buffer exchange was achieved using Amicon® Ultra centrifugal filters (Merck
Millipore) through a 100-kD membrane according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantification of purified IgG was determined using NanoVue Plus microvolume
spectrophotometers.
Pseudovirus production and permissive cell line generation
Pseudotyped vectors were produced by triple transfection of 293T cells as previously
described18. Briefly, cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding for lentiviral proteins, a
luciferase Firefly reporter, and a plasmid expressing a codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 Spike
gene. Pseudotyped vectors were harvested on day 2 post-transfection. Functional titer (TU)
was determined by qPCR after the transduction of a stable HEK 293T-hACE2 cell line. To
generate this cell line, HEK 293T cells were transduced at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)
20 with an integrative lentiviral vector expressing the human ACE2 gene under the control of
the UBC promoter. Clones were generated by limiting dilution and selected on their
permissivity to SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped lentiviral vector transduction.
Pseudoneutralisation Assay
First, serum dilutions were mixed and co-incubated with 300 TU of the pseudotyped vector at
room temperature for 30 minutes. Serum and vector were diluted in culture medium or with
IVIG batches at a 12mg/mL concentration for IgG. (DMEM-glutamax (Gibco) + 10% FCS
(Gibco) + Pen/Strep (Gibco). The mix was then plated in a tissue culture treated black 96-well
plate (Costar) with 20 000 HEK 293T-hACE2 cells in suspension. To prepare the suspension,
the cell flask was washed with DPBS twice (Gibco) and the cells were individualized with
DPBS + 0.1% EDTA (Promega) to preserve hACE2 protein. After 48hrs, the medium was
removed and bioluminescence was measured using a Luciferase Assay System (Promega) on

7 (P5 d7) and day 17 (P5 d17) after the onset of the symptoms. Neutralisation antibody titers are expressed as the highest serum
dilution which shows 100% inhibition of the cytopathic effect of live SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 cells.
(e) Neutralisation capacities on pseudotyped vectors of the IgG isolated from the serum of COVID19 Patient 5 drawn 17 days after
symptom onset, diluted with standard diluant (orange) or with IVIG batches (green, purple and red) with a final IVIG IgG
concentration of 12 g/L in the neutralisation assay. Half maximal inhibitory concentrations IC50 of P5 serum alone (11.67 µg/mL) or
diluted with IVIG1 (9.94 µg/mL), IVIG2 (9.14 µg/mL) and IVIG3 (10.15 µmg/mL) are shown with dotted lines.
