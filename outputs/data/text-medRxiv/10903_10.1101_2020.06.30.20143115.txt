Abstract
Disease transmission is notoriously heterogeneous, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. A skewed distribution where few individuals or events are responsible for the majority of transmission can result in explosive, superspreading events, which produce rapid and volatile epidemic dynamics, especially early or
late in epidemics. Anticipating and preventing superspreading events can produce large reductions in
overall transmission rates. Here, we present a compartmental (SEIR) epidemiological model framework
for estimating transmission parameters from multiple imperfectly observed data streams, including reported cases, deaths, and mobile phone-based mobility that incorporates individual-level heterogeneity in
transmission using previous estimates for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. We parameterize the model for
COVID-19 epidemic dynamics by estimating a time-varying transmission rate that incorporates the impact of non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies that change over time, in five epidemiologically distinct
settings—Los Angeles and Santa Clara Counties, California; Seattle (King County), Washington; Atlanta
(Dekalb and Fulton Counties), Georgia; and Miami (Miami-Dade County), Florida. We find the effective
reproduction number RE dropped below 1 rapidly following social distancing orders in mid-March, 2020
and remained there into June in Santa Clara County and Seattle, but climbed above 1 in late May in Los
Angeles, Miami, and Atlanta, and has trended upward in all locations since April. With the fitted model,
we ask: how does truncating the tail of the individual-level transmission rate distribution affect epidemic
dynamics and control? We find interventions that truncate the transmission rate distribution while partially
relaxing social distancing are broadly effective, with impacts on epidemic growth on par with the strongest
population-wide social distancing observed in April, 2020. Given that social distancing interventions will
be needed to maintain epidemic control until a vaccine becomes widely available, “chopping off the tail”
to reduce the probability of superspreading events presents a promising option to alleviate the need for
extreme general social distancing.

Introduction

2

In the face of emerging epidemics with limited pharmaceutical options for treatment and prevention of

3

infection, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing are critical for slowing epidemic

4

growth. Shelter-in-place and other social distancing orders have helped to slow the pace of the COVID-19

5

pandemic, reducing the effective reproduction number RE —or the number of secondary infections pro-

6

duced by each infected person—to one or below in most places. In doing so, social distancing has effec-

7

tively kept most regional healthcare systems operating under maximum capacity. However, after only a

8

few weeks of declining numbers of daily cases due to an RE at or below one, most state and county gov-

9

ernments in the United States have begun relaxing social distancing orders, citing their major economic

10

impacts. In order to avoid epidemic resurgence, it is vitally important that governments employ long-term

11

strategies that maintain epidemic control as economic reopening commences.

12

One obstacle to designing effective long-term strategies is a notoriously heterogeneous transmission

13

process. It is now widely recognized that the minority of infections generate the majority of secondary cases,

14

leading to the so-called 20-80 rule in epidemiology (the rule-of-thumb that 20% of people generate 80% of

15

cases) 1 . Work on SARS-CoV-1, measles, and other respiratory viruses suggests that this skew in secondary

16

cases is even larger 2 . This heterogeneity gives rise to events in which a single infected person transmits a

17

disease to dozens or hundreds of people—called superspreading events—which have played an important

18

role in the COVID-19 pandemic 3,4,5,6,7 . Indeed, the frequency of asymptomatic and presymptomatic trans-

19

mission, potential disconnect between infection and clinical presentation 8 , and potential transmission via

20

direct contact, aerosols, and surfaces 9,10 are all features of SARS-CoV-2 that tend to promote superspread-

21

ing. As local and national governments search for viable exit strategies from shelter-in-place, a critical

22

question is how effective curtailing superspreading events could be in controlling epidemic spread.

23

Practically, one strategy to help prevent superspreading is to prohibit medium to large indoor gatherings

24

such as exercise classes, sporting events, concerts, and weddings for an extended period after allowing

25

smaller and lower-risk activities to resume. From a modeling standpoint, predicting the effects of this

26

straightforward intervention is difficult for two reasons: 1) local epidemiological dynamics are changing

27

with evolving intervention strategies; and 2) information may not be available to parameterize detailed

28

models of disease spread through heterogeneous populations. Despite these difficulties, it is important to

29

consider some individual-level heterogeneity in transmission because model analyses of mean transmission

30

rates alone may over-estimate the effectiveness of interventions, overlook potentially effective interventions

31

that act on the heterogeneity within populations, overlook potentially explosive resurgences, and poorly

32

predict the final epidemic size 2,7 .

33

Studies of superspreading often empirically estimate secondary case distributions from recorded trans-

34

mission chains and/or using branching process models 2,5,6,11 . These studies estimate a dispersion param-

35

eter, k, that describes the variance in secondary cases based on a Negative Binomial distribution, where

36

smaller values indicate more heterogeneity and skew and large values approach a Poisson distribution. Es-

37

timated k values for SARS-CoV-2 remain uncertain, but are thought to range from 0.04 - 0.3 6,7,11,12 , similar

38

to the estimate of 0.16 for SARS-CoV-1 2 , which we use for this analysis. These empirical and branching

39

process approaches are ideal for characterizing heterogeneity in secondary cases, but not for projecting epi-

40

demic trajectories through time, without being further embedded in a compartmental or network modeling

41

framework.

42

Here, we present a mechanistic susceptible, exposed, infectious, removed (SEIR) model that uses data

43

on cases, deaths, and mobility for parameter estimation, incorporates heterogeneity in transmission rates,

44

and is realistic enough to be useful for scenario exploration but simple enough to be adapted to a wide

45

range of settings. The key innovation in our model is in using the average of Gamma-distributed individ-

46

ual transmission rates at each time step, as supported by previous work on secondary case distributions,

47

to generate the distribution of population-average transmission rates. This formulation allows us to both

48

generate more realistic variation in trajectories than SEIR models that assume a single average transmis-

49

sion rate, and explore and quantify the impact of altering individual-level transmission distributions on

50

population-level dynamics without more detailed information on contact networks, age structure, or other

51

social information.

52

The model, with accompanying open-access code, can be used to fit to any county in the U.S. using

53

publicly available data; here we focus on five contrasting epidemiological settings—Seattle (King County),

54

Washington; Los Angeles (Los Angeles County), California; Santa Clara County, California; Atlanta (Dekalb

55

and Fulton Counties), Georgia; and Miami (Miami-Dade County), Florida. For each location we estimate a

56

time-varying effective reproduction number, RE , which represents the average number of secondary infec-

57

tions produced by each infected person, and is an important (though imperfect 7 ) metric of epidemic control.

58

Using each fitted model, we truncate the individual-level transmission rate distribution and stochastically

59

simulate epidemic dynamics into the future, representing a scenario where high-risk events are eliminated

60

but smaller and lower-risk activities are allowed to resume. We investigate the absolute impact of this su-

61

perspreading prevention strategy on epidemic control, and compare its impact on epidemic dynamics (and

62

RE ) to test-and-isolate and shelter-in-place interventions. Using this comparison we highlight exit strate-

63

gies from shelter-in-place that are expected to reduce both epidemic growth (i.e., keep RE below one) and

64

the probability of explosive resurgence.

Methods

66

Model Structure

67

We developed a compartmental model using an SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) frame-

68

work to model COVID-19 transmission, which was first described in Childs et al. 13 . Our model divides

69

the population into the following classes: susceptible (S); exposed but not yet infectious (E); infectious

70

and presymptomatic (IP ), asymptomatic (IA ), mildly symptomatic (IM ), or severely symptomatic (IS ); hos-

71

pitalized cases that will recover (HR ) or die (HD ); recovered and immune (R); and dead (D). We assume

72

an underlying, unobserved process model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission described by equations 1–10 and

73

shown in Figure S1, where each term dX,Y denotes the transition from compartment X to Y . Transitions

74

between compartments are simulated as binomial (B) or multinomial (M) processes. We use an Euler ap-

75

proximation of the continuous time process with a time step of 4 hours. To produce more realistic latent and

76

infectious periods we divide each infectious class and the exposed period into multiple sub-stages, which

77

results in Erlang distributed periods within stages 14,15 . Specifically, we use three sub-stages for the exposed

78

class, seven sub-stages for the asymptomatic infectious class, two sub-stages for the presymptomatic infec-

79

tious class, five sub-stages for the mildly symptomatic infectious class, and five sub-stages for the severely

80

symptomatic class. We translate durations into rates for our model with sub-classes and a Euler approx-

81

imation using the method described in He et al. 16 . Equations 11–18 describe in detail the stochastic rates

82

used to approximate the transition terms in equations 1–10. Parameters are defined in Tables 1, 2, and 3.

By including asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals, we are able to track “silent spreaders”

84

of the disease, which have been shown to contribute to COVID-19 transmission 17,18 . Mildly symptomatic

85

cases are defined as those people that show symptoms but do not require hospitalization. We assume that

86

all severely symptomatic cases will eventually require hospitalization and that no onward transmission

87

occurs from hospitalized individuals.

88

The time-varying transmission parameter, βt , describes the average per capita rate of contact between sus-

89

ceptible and infectious people at time t, multiplied by the per-contact transmission probability. We modeled

90

βt as a function of human movement using the scaling function:

θ
βt = β0 βm
,

(19)

91

which treats βt as an exponentially decreasing function of physical distancing (θ; on a scale of 0-1 where 0

92

is no physical distancing, and 1 is maximum physical distancing). Here, β0 βm is the estimated minimum

93

possible transmission rate given minimal human movement (i.e., maximal physical distancing) and thus

94

contact rate. To model human movement we use SafeGraph’s “Shelter in Place Index” 43 , which measures

95

the proportion of cell phone devices that are staying home.

96

To model individual heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate, we allow individuals to vary over

97

time by modeling an individual’s transmission rate in each time step as a Gamma distributed random vari-

98

able with a dispersion such that the sum of an individual’s transmission rates over the duration of their

99

infection approximates a Gamma distributed random variable with dispersion equal to previous Negative

100

Binomial parameterizations for reproductive number SARS-CoV-1 (k = 0.16) 44 , which closely approxi-

101

mates estimates of overdispersion for SARS-CoV-2 12,45 . Because we model the transmission rates as the

102

multiplication of contact rate and infection probability, this heterogeneity implicitly considers both varia-

103

tion among individuals in infectiousness and contact rate, and can be thought of as modeling superspread-

104

ing periods or events—windows in time when an infected individual has a particularly high transmission

105

rate. To incorporate this variation into an average time step βt , we model βt as the average of the transmis-

106

sion of all infected individuals at time t. To do so we apply the property of Gamma distributions that the

107

mean and variance of N samples from a Gamma distribution with defined rate and scale is itself a Gamma

108

distribution with mean equal to that of the original Gamma distribution and variance equal to the variance

109

of the original Gamma divided by N . A full derivation of the equivalence between the individual time step

transmission rate distributions (which we will hereafter refer to with π), the individual infectious period

111

transmission rate distributions, and the population-level transmission rate distribution is available in the

112

Appendix.

113

We assume that observed deaths are a Negative Binomial random variable with a mean equal to to-

114

tal new deaths accumulated over the observation period (i.e., one day for this analysis), and a dispersion

115

parameter that we estimate. We also assume that daily observed cases are a Negative Binomial random

116

variable, but have a mean equal to the daily number of new symptomatic infections multiplied by a daily

117

detection probability that we estimate from the data. We model daily detection probability as a monotoni-

118

cally increasing logistic function:

ω
1+

e−m(t−φ)

,

(20)

119

where ω is the maximum fraction of symptomatic cases detected, m is the logistic growth rate, and φ gives

120

the location of the inflection point (where the probability of detection equals one half of the maximum de-

121

tection probability, ω). Because φ can be estimated to be in the future, the probability of detection of an

122

infected case in the present can be any value between 0 and ω. We estimate newly observed cases to be

123

a fraction of all new symptomatic infections at time t. Though this ignores testing asymptomatic infec-

124

tions, any detection of asymptomatic infections will be captured as a higher estimated detection fraction of

125

symptomatic infections.

126

Fitting the Model

127

We use COVID-19 death and case data from The New York Times, based on reports from state and lo-

128

cal health agencies (available at https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). Using these data,

129

which are available for all counties in the US, and any form of human movement data that can be scaled to

130

0-1, our model can be used to fit infection dynamics in any county.

131

For computational efficiency, we assumed point estimates for some parameters (Table 1) and sampled

132

over uncertainty in others (Tables 2, 3) by drawing 600 sobol sequences, an efficient method for sampling

133

input parameters 46 , across a range of plausible values for each in order to form 600 plausible parameter

134

sets. For each parameter set we used the package pomp 47 in the statistical programming language R 48 to

135

estimate the following parameters: β0 : transmission rate over an entire infection in the absence of social

136

distancing; βm : estimated transmission given zero human movement; E0 : number of exposed individuals

137

that initiate the epidemic; ω, m, and φ: maximum, slope, and inflection point day of the sigmoidal case

138

detection function; θd : Negative Binomial dispersion parameter for deaths; and θc : Negative Binomial

139

dispersion parameter for cases. We fit all parameters to daily deaths, cases, and mobility in two steps. First,

140

for each of the 600 parameter sets we used the mif2 function in pomp with random starting conditions, 120

141

iterations and 2000 particles. We then continued to fit the 60 parameter sets with the highest log likelihoods

142

for an additional 200 iterations using 2000 particles. Each county took approximately nine hours to fit using

143

twenty cores.

144

We calculated RE at each time t as estimated βt times the median proportion of the population remain-

145

ing susceptible on each day across 300 simulated epidemics, with simulated epidemics that did not reach at

146

least a total of 100 infected discarded, times the average infectiousness over an infection (as defined by our

147

model structure) using the 10 parameter sets with the largest negative log likelihoods as determined by the

148

second fitting step.

149

Simulating epidemics under interventions

150

Any intervention type, intensity, or duration can be modeled using this framework and open-source code

151

(available at https://github.com/morgankain/COVID_interventions) given that it can be writ-

152

ten as a function that modifies either human movement or βt (e.g., social distancing or a pharmaceutical

153

intervention that reduces the probability of infection). Previously we considered the impacts of various

154

social distancing initiatives on epidemic dynamics using a similar model formulation 13 . Here we consider

155

interventions that reduce the skew of the individual time step transmission rate distribution (π), and thus

156

the average time-varying transmission rate βt ; this is our mathematical representation of reducing highly

157

infectious contact periods or events, which for COVID-19 tend to occur in crowded enclosed environments

158

(e.g., church choirs and exercise classes). Specifically, we model truncation of the π distribution by assum-

159

ing that all samples within the top X% of the π distribution are resampled. To visualize the dynamics of

160

interventions, for each location we simulate 300 epidemics from the maximum likelihood estimate across

161

the 600 parameter sets. The uncertainty band we plot represents the central 95% range of outcomes seen

162

across all stochastic realizations that resulted in epidemics for this parameter set, and thus should not be

163

taken as representation of uncertainty in parameter values or model structure.

167

Los Angeles County, California; Santa Clara County, California; Fulton and Dekalb Counties, Georgia; and

168

Miami-Dade County, Florida (hereafter, Seattle, Los Angeles, Santa Clara County, Atlanta, and Miami).

169

Among these locations, we estimated that prior to interventions, R0 ranged between approximately 2 and 4

170

(Figure 1). We also estimated that RE dropped below one following shelter-in-place orders in all counties,

171

though only briefly in some locations. In particular, in Miami, Los Angeles, and Atlanta RE climbed above

172

1 by mid-May and daily cases and deaths have plateaued or continue to grow into June. Though RE

173

remained below 1 into at least early June in Seattle and Santa Clara County, as of June 18 RE is ∼1 and

174

cases are rising again.

Atlanta (red), Seattle (green), Miami (gold), Santa Clara County (blue), and Los Angeles (purple). Los
Angeles is displayed on a different y-axis due to differences in magnitude of reported deaths and cases.
For each county, we show the 10 model fits with the best log likelihoods. Panel C show the same results
pictured in B, but are zoomed in to April 15 - June 18 to better show the dynamics around RE = 1. Black
points are observed daily deaths and reported cases in each county. Solid lines display mean of model

Interventions

176

As a basis for comparison, focusing on just two locations—Los Angeles and Seattle—if shelter-in-place

177

were simply lifted, a second peak would be inevitable in the absence of any non-pharmaceutical interven-

178

tions (Figure 2, blue). However, non-pharmaceutical interventions, including continuing shelter-in-place,

179

infected isolation with intermediate levels of shelter-in-place, or averting superspreading with intermedi-

180

ate levels of shelter-in-place are capable of limiting epidemic growth (Figure 2) and keeping RE near or

181

under 1. Here, we consider intermediate levels of shelter-in-place that correspond to mobility levels that

182

are an average of baseline mobility prior to social distancing and final mobility levels observed in the last

183

week of data. Either an infected isolation strategy that reduces to intermediate levels of shelter-in-place and

Figure 2: Maintaining shelter-in-place (SIP; orange), test-and-isolate (green), or superspreading aversion
(purple) strategies over long periods is necessary to prevent a major epidemic resurgence (blue) in each
location where we fit our model (shown here for Los Angeles, CA [A, C] and Seattle, WA [B, D]). However,
continuing SIP at current levels (orange) will lead to an increase in daily cases in both Los Angeles (A) and
Seattle (B). Daily reported cases are shown in (A) and (B) and daily deaths in (C) and (D). For both shelterin-place and truncation interventions we assume an intermediate level of mobility (an average of baseline
mobility prior to social distancing and final mobility levels observed in the last week of data). Bands show
95% CI on stochastic simulations of daily cases and deaths for the single maximum likelihood parameter
set. Dates range from February through September of 2020. Vertical axes are log transformed for visibility.

Curtailing superspreading

Limiting opportunities for superspreading by “chopping off the tail” of the contact rate or infectiousness

distributions can be highly effective at epidemic control (Figure 2), driving epidemic growth to be negative

191

and bringing the average number of secondary cases (RE ) below 1. An example truncation intervention is

192

illustrated in Figure 3: because the individual transmission rate distribution, π, over a 4-hour time period

193

is so skewed (Figure 3A; see appendix for derivation), truncating the upper 0.1% yields a large reduction

194

in the mean and a moderate reduction in the variance of the population-level average transmission rate

195

(Figure 3B, shifting from red to blue distribution). A variety of possible truncation strategies exist, including

196

eliminating varying proportions of π (e.g., upper 0.5%, upper 1%) with varying levels of efficiency (ranging

197

from 50-100%) (Figure S2).

198

An alternative measure of the impact of averting superspreading (i.e., truncation interventions) is how

199

much general social distancing can be avoided by instead truncating the transmission rate distribution.

200

Prior to social distancing orders, the estimated proportion sheltering in place (SIP, for short) ranged from

201

∼20-22% across our focal locations (Figure 3C, triangles), indicating the baseline level of mobility. If we

202

combine SIP with truncation interventions, a variety of combinations are predicted to provide epidemic

203

control (for example, by reducing transmission rates such that RE in a fully susceptible population would be

204

1; Figure 3). If the truncation intervention is 100% effective, truncating only approximately the upper 0.15%

205

of individual transmission rates, π, (Figure 3A) is effective enough to maintain transmission rates such

206

that RE would be 1 in a fully susceptible population, while allowing mobility levels to return to baseline

207

(Figure 3C). Alternatively, if truncation interventions are only half as effective, the same 0.15% truncation

208

intervention would require moderate-strong social distancing (SIP from ∼30-45%; Figure 3C). The nonlinear

209

effects of social distancing and truncation on transmission make the combination of interventions needed

210

to maintain epidemic control sensitive to the efficiency and strength of each intervention mechanism.

211

Superspreading and epidemic resurgence

212

Even if the epidemic is brought almost entirely under control (e.g., to within 1-5 infected individuals re-

213

maining in the population), epidemic resurgence remains a possibility if interventions wane, allowing RE

214

to increase above one. As we show in (Figure 3), many different combinations of SIP and truncation can be

215

used to produce the same RE (in Figure 3, an RE of 1); however, epidemic dynamics will vary by combi-

216

nation because of the variation in individual time-step transmission rates, π. If RE rises above one because

217

interventions are relaxed, the specific combination of SIP and truncation that remains in place will deter-

218

mine the resulting dynamics. Here we examine how different truncation interventions will affect epidemic

219

extinction probability and the size of epidemic resurgence when it does not go extinct. We compare the full

220

effect of truncation interventions (which influence both the mean of the transmission rate distribution and

221

its shape) to the effects of truncation when RE is held constant by scaling SIP, reflecting only truncation

222

effects on the transmission rate distribution shape (variance, skew, etc.).

223

With few infected individuals and RE > 1, stochasticity and heterogeneity in βt can either lead to ex-

224

tinction, moderate resurgence, or explosive resurgence. Keeping interventions in place that remove even

225

a tiny percent of the largest βt values can help to avoid the more explosive events (Figure 4). Truncation

226

markedly reduces the probability of explosive epidemic resurgence (Figure 4A) both by increasing the ex-

227

tinction probability (Figure 4B) and by reducing the magnitude of resurgent epidemics when they do occur

228

(Figure 4C). While epidemic size was less sensitive to the number initially infected when resurgences do oc-

229

cur (Figure 4C), the stochastic extinction probability was extremely sensitive to the difference between even

230

one, three, or five remaining infections (Figure 4B). Much, but not all, of the benefit of truncation comes

231

from changing the mean transmission rate (and therefore RE ). When RE is held constant by adjusting SIP,

232

effects of truncation are more moderate. An increase in efficiency at truncating the top 0.1% of the βt dis-

233

tribution noticeably decreases the number of infected 42 days after interventions are relaxed (Figure 4D,F).

234

However, because of the need to slightly reduce SIP to hold RE constant under truncation, truncation of

235

π marginally decreases the extinction probability of the epidemic, which remains much more sensitive to

236

the number initially infected (Figure 4E). The highly stochastic nature of epidemic growth when cases are

237

rare, combined with the fact that each truncation leaves behind highly skewed distributions regardless of

238

the truncation parameters, results in even 10,000 epidemic simulations producing noisy patterns across

239

intervention scenarios. Similar patterns are seen as more of the π distribution is truncated (Figure S4).

Figure 4: Effects of transmission rate truncation on epidemic die-out and explosive resurgence. With
skewed individual variation in transmission rate, relaxing social distancing interventions when infections
become rare (allowing RE to increase above one) may lead to explosive stochastic epidemic resurgence.
Top panels (A-C) show the overall effect of truncation interventions, including effects on both the mean
and shape of the transmission rate distribution, and resulting RE . Bottom panels (D-F) show the effect
of truncation when RE is held constant by rescaling shelter-in-place at the time of intervention relaxation.
Specifically, for a 0% truncation efficiency we simulate epidemic resurgence assuming R0 = 2, which results
in an RE = 2 · S/N at the time of resurgence, which will vary by simulation (where S is the number of susceptible individuals and N is the total population size). In panels (A-C) as truncation efficiency increases
RE decreases; in panels (D-E) we scale shelter-in-place to retain an average RE = 2 · S/N across truncations.
Simulations are performed with varying efficiencies of truncation of the top 0.1% of the π distribution. Envelopes in (A) and (D) show the central 98% of resurgent simulations (across 10,000 total simulations) for
three efficiencies of truncation (0% in orange, 60% in green, 100% in blue). The proportion of epidemic
simulations that go extinct within 42 days of intervention relaxation for thresholds of 1 (red), 3 (gold), and
5 (blue) infected individuals is shown in (B) and (E). The upper 99th percentile of concurrent infections 42
days after intervention relaxation in resurgent simulations for the same thresholds is shown in (C) and (F).

Discussion

241

Understanding local epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19—and the impact of heterogeneity on those

242

dynamics—remains a challenge due to both limited and imperfect data in most regions and ever evolving
17

243

interventions and adherence. Reported cases are only a small fraction of all infections, and the propor-

244

tion of symptomatic cases that are detected remains highly uncertain and variable over space and time.

245

Our approach takes an important step toward capturing locally-specific epidemic dynamics and the im-

246

pact of heterogeneity across settings by providing a platform (including a mathematical model and open

247

access code) for estimating time-varying transmission rates (βt ) from death, mobility, and imperfectly ob-

248

served case report data, all of which are publicly available. The model can estimate epidemic dynamics and

249

transmission rates over time across epidemiological settings that vary in population size, demography, and

250

control. By incorporating individual variation in contact rates (or, equivalently, infectiousness) into time

251

step transmission rate distributions, we incorporate some of the known effects of heterogeneity without re-

252

quiring detailed information on population mixing, structure, social networks, or movement patterns. We

253

find that control measures in March of 2020 rapidly brought the average reproduction number—RE —from

254

∼2–4 to below 1 in all locations we considered in early April. However, as of June 18, RE has once again

255

drifted above one in all of these locations except possibly in Seattle, WA and Santa Clara County, CA, where

256

it remains unclear if it is greater or less than one.

257

Non-pharmaceutical interventions will be necessary to control COVID-19 in all settings until better

258

pharmaceutical options (in particular, effective vaccines) are widely available. Social distancing in the gen-

259

eral population is effective but costly: it is a blunt and imprecise tool. The social and economic necessity of

260

relaxing social distancing demands safe exit strategies based on more precise, targeted interventions to re-

261

duce transmission. Testing and isolating symptomatic people, combined with contact tracing, remains the

262

gold standard intervention for limiting onward transmission as social distancing is lifted, but it is expensive

263

and capacity remains limited in many settings. Our model shows that it is possible to target interventions

264

even without precise information on specific population mobility, mixing, and infectiousness patterns, by

265

limiting just the most high-risk activities, such as large gatherings and indoor events that have many close

266

contacts. How much can be gained from these common sense interventions that reduce or eliminate oppor-

267

tunities for superspreading while allowing smaller and safer activities to resume? We find that these trun-

268

cation interventions, which eliminate the upper percentiles of contact rates in the population, and thereby

269

transmission rates, can be highly effective at maintaining epidemic control (Figure 2), particularly when

270

combined with mild to moderate social distancing (Figure 3). Importantly, even after epidemic control is

271

achieved and case numbers drop very low, “chopping off the tail” can provide powerful insurance against

272

explosive resurgence after social distancing interventions are otherwise lifted (Figure 4).

273

What does “chopping off the tail” mean in practical terms? Five types of factors tend to promote su-

274

perspreading: (1) high rates or intensity of contact between people or with surfaces; (2) large aggregations

275

of people; (3) poorly ventilated physical environments, especially indoors 49 ; (4) highly infectious individ18

276

uals; (5) highly susceptible recipient population 4,6,50 . Many settings where SARS-CoV-2 superspreading

277

has occurred—including nursing homes 26 , exercise classes, bars and restaurants 49 , funerals, churches 51 ,

278

meat-packing plants 52 —combine multiple risk factors. For example, choir practices combine high densities

279

of people, a high-risk activity (singing) 53 , and potentially poorly ventilated indoor spaces; long-term care

280

facilities combine mobile, high-contact caregivers with highly vulnerable residents, often in high-density

281

indoor spaces. Some superspreading events may be easier to eliminate than others. Clearly, healthcare

282

and long-term care facilities serve critical functions despite their high-risk nature, and taking all possible

283

steps for decontamination and personal protection in these facilities is critical to mitigate this risk 50 . On

284

the other end of the spectrum, voluntary, large, indoor events that are mainly for entertainment and could

285

be postponed—gyms, clubs, sporting events, concerts, large lectures—may be the most viable option to

286

reduce superspreading and “chop off the tail” of the contact rate distribution 54 . While these common sense

287

interventions are not novel suggestions 6 , and are already part of reopening plans in almost all locations,

288

our work allows a direct comparison of how much general social distancing is avoided by eliminating a

289

fraction of these high-risk events (Figure 3). Truncation strategies are even more desirable in light of their

290

effectiveness at preventing explosive resurgence after controls are otherwise lifted (Figure 4). Mapping ac-

291

tual event types onto the contact rate distribution to determine how particular superspreading reduction

292

policies would affect control remains an important next step. Importantly, associating superspreading with

293

events and locations, rather than specific people, can avoid the stigma sometimes associated with being

294

identified as a superspreader 4 .

295

The impact of truncation interventions is two-fold. First, removing the upper tail of the individual

296

transmission rate distribution reduces the population-level mean, often dramatically (Figure 3A,B). If the

297

mean transmission rate already placed RE near 1 (for example, due to other interventions), then additional

298

truncation could be enough to cross this critical threshold. However, most intervention strategies that bring

299

RE to 1 already include prohibiting large gatherings, especially indoors, so additional truncation may not

300

be possible within the context of first-wave interventions. However, truncation also acts on the variance

301

and skew of the transmission rate distribution, though these effects are smaller than the effect on the mean

302

(Figure 4D-F compared to A-C). Given that super-spreading events are particularly dangerous when cases

303

are few (in the early or late phases of the epidemic) 2 , sustained truncation interventions could be extremely

304

important for preventing explosive stochastic re-emergence when low case numbers allow general social

305

distancing to be lifted (Figure 4). In this scenario, resurgence remains rare (Figure 4B) but possible because

306

individual variation in transmission rates is large; most of the time infectious people transmit to few others,

307

but occasionally someone infects dozens (Figure 4A), quickly overwhelming testing, contact tracing, and

308

isolation efforts. Sustained truncation dramatically reduces the probability of explosive resurgence, and

309

constrains incipient transmission chains to be smaller and more manageable.

310

One limitation on understanding the effect of heterogeneity in transmission in particular locations is

311

the challenge of estimating epidemiological parameters from noisy and imperfect data: necessarily a bal-

312

ancing act between model simplicity and complexity. Here, we rely on metrics of heterogeneity previously

313

estimated for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 2,12,45 instead of estimating them directly from data; we focus

314

our parameter estimation on the mean of the transmission rate distribution. Heterogeneity in contact rates

315

or infectiousness, and the resulting distributional variance and skew, may vary based on local patterns of

316

movement, contact, behavior, and population demography. This heterogeneity can have important conse-

317

quences: in some cases epidemics with low mean R0 can actually infect a larger proportion of the popula-

318

tion than epidemics with higher mean R0 —as was the case for the 1918 influenza pandemic as compared to

319

the 2014 Ebola outbreak—due to the heterogeneity in transmission rates, as described by higher moments of

320

the secondary case distribution 7 . The true epidemiological parameters in any given location, and the extent

321

of our uncertainty in these parameters, also remain unknown because of the computational challenges of

322

parameter estimation given the limited information contained in noisy case, death, and mobility data. For

323

example, depending on how a particular candidate parameter combination weights the noisiness of cases

324

and deaths and estimates initial conditions, transmission rate estimates can vary substantially (Figure 1).

325

Fully characterizing uncertainty in model structure and parameter values in this context is difficult. Future

326

work that directly estimates case ascertainment rates (e.g., through metrics of percentage of tests that are

327

positive, age distributions of positive tests, epidemiological contact information on cases, and analysis of

328

viral genome sequences 55 ), as well as more detailed mobility and contact network information 17 could help

329

to improve the model fit to the full shape of the transmission rate distribution.

330

First-wave interventions that eliminated large social gatherings and indoor activities and mandated

331

mask-wearing and physical distancing have likely already affected the heterogeneity in transmission rates,

332

by eliminating many of the high-risk events likely to fall into the upper tail of the distribution. It is impor-

333

tant to recognize that as social distancing interventions relax, sustaining such truncation interventions may

334

be critical for keeping transmission down to levels manageable through testing, contact tracing, and isola-

335

tion. This truncation strategy can potentially reduce the social and economic costs of non-pharmaceutical

336

interventions on the general populace, and facilitate sustained adherence by allowing lower-risk activities

337

to resume while insuring against a resurgence. Ultimately, an unmitigated epidemic, whether as a first

338

or second wave, would kill thousands to tens of thousands of people in each of the locations we studied,

339

reinforcing the point that aiming for population herd immunity through naturally acquired infections is

340

not a viable public health strategy. Instead, exit strategies that can sustain epidemic control after shelter-in-

341

place orders end, including truncating the transmission rate distribution, will be necessary until an effective

Derivation of the population-level βt distribution
In heterogeneous populations, the expected number of secondary infections caused by a particular individual (or the individual reproductive number, ν) can be modeled as a negative binomial random variable
with mean R0 and overdispersion parameter k 2,6,56 , i.e. ν ∼ N B(k, R0k+k ). This is equivalent to modeling ν
as a Poisson random variable whose mean is itself a random gamma variable with shape k and scale R0 /k,
ν ∼ Poisson(θ)
R0

θ ∼ Γ(k,

Now
let d be the duration of infection for an individual and τ be a time step. Using the fact that k =

Thus for a constant duration of infection d, we have the individual infection rate over a time step

which will have mean R0 τ /d and variance N0kd . Notably, this behaves well with scalings on R0 as a function
of interventions: Let θ be the amount of physical distancing occurring in the population on a scale of 0-1
where 0 is no physical distancing, and 1 is maximum 
physical distancing,
and f be a function mapping

There are two main differences between the above derivation and our model formulation (note that for the

where βt is the average transmission rate over all individuals infectious during that time step and B is
a binomial process. For large S and small Ia +Ip +Im +Is , this approximates a Poisson distribution for
the number of secondary cases from each infected individual in each time step and the total secondary
infections caused by an individual over their infectious period.
2. above, we assume a constant duration of infection. In our model periods are Erlang distributed given
our division of stages (e.g. Ia ) into n sub stages, each with the same period 14,15 . This marginally
increases the variance in the per-infectious period d istribution as we show in Figure S5.

Derivation of the relationship between R, Gamma truncation, and the fraction of individuals sheltering
in place
Let d be the average duration of infection, τ be a time step, θ be the proportion of the population sheltering
in place, and Xp,η be a random variable X with right truncation, where truncation occurs at the p-th percentile, with probability η. Suppose that in a given time step we truncate the individual infection rate (π)
over a time step at the p-th percentile with probability η. Then the reproduction number is

For a truncated gamma distribution with shape a and scale b with upper truncation at u, the expected value
is
b [Γ(a + 1, 0) − Γ(a + 1, u/b)]
E[Γ(a, b, u)] =

where Γ is the upper incomplete gamma function. See Okasha and Alqanoo (2014) [eq.29] 57 for the full
derivation.
Letting γ be the lower incomplete gamma function, it follows that
R0 /k [Γ(kτ /d + 1, 0) − Γ(kτ /d + 1, uk/R0 )]
Γ(kτ /d, 0) − Γ(kτ /d, uk/R0 )

Transmission rate
Figure S3: Expanded view of truncating the upper 0.1% of the individual level time step transmission rate distribution
(π) at a four-hour time step (A). This truncation leads to a reduction of the mean and variance for an individual’s
infectious period reproduction potential (B). As the number of infected individuals in the population increases from
10 (C, D) to 1000 (E, F), the variance in decreases in both the population-level average transmission rate during each
4-hour period (C, E) and over the lifetime of those infected (D, F).

concurrent infected after 42 days (B) for the resurgent simulations among 5000 total simulations for increasing truncation proportions of π. Shelter-in-place is scaled so that transmission rate at the time of intervention relaxation is
identical across intervention scenarios and would result in RE = 2 in a fully susceptible population.

Figure S5: The distribution of individual lifetime reproduction (R) when modeled as a Gamma distribution with
a mean of 2.5 and a scale of 0.16 (A). This distribution implicitly assumes a constant infectious duration. Using a
geometrically distributed infectious period with only one period (“box”), and a time period of 4 hours result in an increase in the variance of the individual reproductive distribution relative to assuming a constant infectious period (B).
Breaking the infectious period into 7 sub-stages (boxes) reduces the variance, though the variance remains marginally
higher than when assuming a constant infectious period (C).
