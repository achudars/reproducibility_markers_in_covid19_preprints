Little is known regarding why a subset of COVID-19 patients exhibited
prolonged positivity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we studied the sera proteomic
dynamics in 37 COVID-19 patients over nine weeks, quantifying 2700 proteins with
high quality. Remarkably, we found that during the first three weeks since disease
onset, while clinical symptoms and outcome were indistinguishable, patients with
prolonged disease course displayed characteristic immunological responses including
enhanced Natural Killer cell-mediated innate immunity and regulatory T cellmediated immunosuppression. We further showed that it is possible to predict the
length of disease course using machine learning based on blood protein levels during
the first three weeks. Validation in an independent cohort achieved an accuracy of
82%. In summary, this study presents a rich serum proteomic resource to understand
host responses in COVID-19 patients and identifies characteristic Treg-mediated
immunosuppression in patients with prolonged disease course, nominating new
therapeutic target and diagnosis strategy.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is an ongoing pandemic spreading
all over the world. About 80% of COVID-19 patients exhibit mild clinical symptoms
including fever and cough, while ~20% of patients deteriorate to life-threatening
severe or critical conditions (Wu and McGoogan, 2020). Multiple studies have
investigated the clinical course and pathogenesis (To et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020;
Zhou et al., 2020) and molecular changes (Messner, 2020; Shen, 2020; Wu et al.,
2020) of severe or critical cases.
What remains largely unknown is the substantial diversity of COVID-19 patients
in terms of disease course. In a recent report, the median interval of COVID-19
patients from onset to clinical recovery was 20 days, with the longest disease course
of 37 days (Zhou et al., 2020). According to our clinical treatment of 37 COVID-19
patients, some patients exhibited surprisingly prolonged virus infection. The longest
disease course we have observed thus far is 107 days (P33, a 55-year-old male) as of
17 May 2020. Little is known about the causes of persistent virus infection and how
he could be effectively treated.
Here we report a longitudinal and in-depth proteomic profiling of 37 COVID-19
patients with short and long disease courses. We analyzed the sera proteomes
collected over nine weeks for both patients with short disease course (SC) who turned
negative for the virus infection in less than 22 days, and patients with long disease
course (LC) who remained positive for 22 days or longer. We have also analyzed the
sera proteomes of 35 non-COVID-19 patients with flu-like symptoms as controls.
2700 proteins were quantified with high quality, offering a rich resource to understand
the dynamic disease course of COVID-19 patients in response to virus infection. Our
data showed characteristic immune responses between the SC and LC patient groups.
Remarkably, the data suggest regulatory T cell (Treg)-mediated immunosuppression
was specifically activated in LC patients. We also showed that it is possible to predict
the disease course of COVID-19 patients by measuring the characteristic protein
levels from blood samples collected in the first three weeks since disease onset using
a machine learning model. This study not only presents a rich resource to study the
COVID-19 host responses, but also nominates novel therapeutic and diagnostic
strategies for COVID-19 patients with prolonged infection positivity.

Patients, samples and proteomics
We procured 37 COVID-19 patients in this study of which 35 were typical and
two were severe cases (Table 1, Table S1), including 19 males and 18 females, with a
median age of 48 years. The median duration of disease in this cohort, as defined in
Methods, was 22 days. These patients were divided into two groups based on the
length of their disease course (Figure 1). The SC group comprised 17 patients with a
disease course shorter than 22 days. The other 20 patients were defined as LC group.
Interestingly, one of the severe cases was classified as SC, while the other severe case

was in the LC group (Figure 1).
These two groups (SC and LC) were indistinguishable based on clinical
symptoms. The median age of SC patients was 43.2 years (range, 27-67 years) for SC
patients, and 49.0 years (range, 2-84 years) for LC patients. The Wilcox t-test showed
no significant age difference between the SC and LC patient groups (Figure S1A).
Clinical treatment of both groups of patients was not significantly different by
Fisher’s exact test (Figure S1B, Table 1), indicating that the different lengths of
disease course were unlikely due to existing therapeutics. Routine blood test data for
the two groups showed no significant difference either (Figure S1C). We analyzed an
additional 35 non-COVID-19 patients with flu-like symptoms as controls (Table 1,
Table S1, and Figure 1B).
We performed in-depth profiling for sera proteome collected from each patient
over nine weeks using TMTpro 16plex-based data-dependent acquisition mass
spectrometry (Thompson et al., 2019). 14 high-abundance blood proteins were largely
depleted to enhance the ability to measure low-abundance proteins. Each TMTlabeled peptide mixture was fractionated into 26-30 fractions for comprehensive
discovery proteomic analysis (Figure 1A). A total of 224 depleted serum samples
were analyzed using TMT-based proteomics (Figure 1). Samples were randomly
distributed into 18 batches. We also analyzed 44 technical replicates for randomly
selected samples in each batch (Figure S2A). Each pool of TMT-labeled peptides was
further fractionated into 26-30 fractions using high-pH reverse phase liquid
chromatography (RPLC) and analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a 60-min RPLC gradient.
The median coefficient of variance (CV) among MS/MS technical replicates was 0.19
(Figure S2B). After excluding proteins with missing values in over 80% of samples,
we presented quantitative levels of 2700 proteins across 268 sera samples with
relatively high degrees of quantitative accuracy (Table S2A).
Complex immunity in the LC patients
To investigate host response differences in the serum proteome data set from the
SC and LC patients, we performed a pairwise comparison of the proteins quantified in
these two groups at each week over nine weeks. We then combined the regulated
proteins at each week, leading to the identification of 921 dysregulated proteins
(Table S2B), of which 405 proteins were functionally annotated in the UniProt
database. We firstly used only GO biological process, KEGG and Reactome pathway
enrichment using 405 proteins, and found that most pathways were related to
immunity and metabolism (Figure S3).
Generally, our data showed that the first week is the inflammatory response
period, featured by activation of redox and amino acid metabolic processes. In the
following three weeks, more pathways involved in adaptive immunity and
glycometabolism were activated. Interestingly, some sex hormone associated
pathways were also enriched, such as fertilization and response to estradiol. From
fifth to ninth week, the two patient groups displayed difference in pathways involved
in tissue remodelling and repair, apoptosis and sulfur compound catabolic process.
We then focused on the immunity-related pathways at each time point as shown

in Figure 2A. For SC patients, they showed upregulated platelet degranulation in the
first week, followed by activation of antigen presentation in the following two weeks.
Leukocyte degranulation was activated in the third week. In the sixth week, SC
patients showed upregulation of serum proteins involved in tissue remodeling (Figure
2A) as signs of recovery. LC patients displayed much more complex serum proteome
dynamics. During the first week, both platelet degranulation and upregulation of Treg
vs Teff were activated. Activation of antigen presentation occurred in the second
week. The complement system was also activated from the second week.
Interestingly, the regulatory T cell (Treg) activation pathway was enriched in the first
two weeks and the fifth week, suggesting immunosuppression occurred early in these
patients. From the fourth week, leukocyte migration was enriched. Tissue repair was
enriched only in the eighth week, followed by the complement system in the ninth
week (Figure 2A). These data suggest that immunological responses during the first
three weeks may be critical in determining the length of the disease course. During
this period, both innate and adaptive immunity were activated in SC patients, while in
contrast, LC patients showed signs of Treg-mediated immunosuppression in addition
to innate and adaptive immunity.
Our data also underscored the proteins involved in the above-mentioned
pathways as shown in Figure S3. In SC patients, a secreted protein, the soluble
scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain-containing protein (SSC5D) was highly
expressed in the second week (Figure S4). SSC5D is highly expressed on monocytes
and activated lymphocytes rather than naïve immune cells, and mediates both innate
and adaptive immunity (Goncalves et al., 2009), suggesting activated immune
responses to virus infection. In the third week, another upregulated protein in SC
patient sera was non-secretory ribonuclease (RNASE2), a chemoattractant for
dendritic cells. RNASE2 is reported to participate in antigen presentation (Yang et al.,
2003), and may play a role in the adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 (Figure
S4). In the fourth week, a pro-inflammatory factor, chromogranin-A (CHGA), was
upregulated in the sera in SC patients. CHGA highly expressed on the secretory cells
to regulate catecholamine secretion which is associated with serum CHGA (di Comite
et al., 2006) and is reported to activate pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and inhibit
anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages (Eissa et al., 2018). In the sixth week, serum
amyloid P-component (APCS) was upregulated in SC patient sera (Figure S4),
suggesting clearance of damaged circulating cells and enhanced angiogenesis.
In LC patients, positive regulators for immune response were found to be
activated. Hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (MST1) was upregulated in the
second week (Figure 2A). MST1 is required for thymocyte migration and antigen
recognition (Ueda et al., 2012). Besides, Golgi-associated plant pathogenesis related
protein 2 (GLIPR2), associated with the migration of T and B lymphocytes, was upregulated in the fourth week (Figure S4). In the following week, we observed
upregulation of two immunosuppressive factors, namely fibroleukin (FGL2) and
programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PDCD1LG2). FGL2 negatively regulates dendritic
cell antigen presentation and T cell differentiation, especially the secreted FGL2 (Hu
et al., 2016). It was upregulated in LC patients and further increased during recovery

from COVID-19 (Figure S4). PDCD1LG2 negatively regulates T cell activation
(Brown et al., 2003), and followed similar dynamics over the disease course to FGL2
(Figure S4). In the eighth week, tissue remodeling associated proteins, such as von
Willebrand factor (VWF), were upregulated in the LC group, suggesting recovery
from COVID-19. Besides, our data show that the complement system may play
important roles in LC patients during the entire disease course. In the second week,
the most enriched pathway involving the upregulation of C5 was the complement
cascade (Figure 2A). In the last week, C8A and other complement system proteins
remained upregulated (Figure S4). Complement activation was reported in our
previous study of COVID-19 sera (Shen, 2020). The complement cascade could also
contribute to immunosuppression (Kemper et al., 2003) and might be a potential
therapeutic target for COVID-19 (Cao, 2020).
Altogether, negative regulator factors and innate immune performed more active
might result in longer disease course.
Characteristic protein dynamics in the LC patients
Next, we investigated whether the differentially expressed proteins between SC
and LC patients were unique to COVID-19 disease by making comparison between
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients with flu-like symptoms (Ctrl, Figure 1B). We
first analyzed the temporal dynamics of the 2700 proteins using Mfuzz (Kumar and
Mattias, 2007) for SC and LC patients. 1746 proteins, grouped in eight clusters in the
SC and LC patient groups (Table S2C), were consistently dysregulated over time
compared to the control group (Figure S5A-B). Four characteristic protein clusters
were enriched in the two patient groups (Figure S5C). In the meantime, 774 proteins
were identified to be differentially expressed in COVID-19 patients compared to the
Ctrl group (Table S2D). By overlapping the two above-mentioned protein shortlists
with the 921 dysregulated proteins between SC and LC patients, our data were
narrowed down to 207 proteins which fulfill the following three criteria: a)
differentially expressed between SC and LC; b) consistently up- or down-regulated
over time; c) COVID-19 disease specific (Figure 2B). Out of 207 proteins, 97 proteins
were functionally annotated by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software tool
(Table S2E).
These proteins were segregated into two major groups based on their expression
across all nine time points during the disease course (Figure 2C). The first group of 80
proteins showed increased expression over time. SC patients exhibited earlier
elevation of these proteins, while LC patients exhibited delayed increase (Figure 2C).
Four major pathways were enriched in this protein group, namely acute phase
response, LXR/RXR activation, agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, and actin
cytoskeleton signaling (Figure 2D). Also, the coagulation and complement systems
were also enriched in this protein group. Acute phase response signaling, coagulation
and complement systems are associated with innate immunity, while actin
cytoskeleton signaling is associated with leukocyte migration in adaptive immunity.
The second group of 17 proteins showed decreasing expression over time. SC
patients showed an earlier decrease than LC patients (Figure 2E). These proteins were

mapped to enriched pathways including metabolic processes such as myo-inositol
biosynthesis, glycolytic shunt and glutamyl cycle (Figure 2E).
Next, we calculated the median expression level of the two groups of proteins and
present them in boxplots (Figure 2D, 2E). For the first group of proteins, generally SC
patients showed lower protein expression than LC patients in the first three weeks, but
the expression was dramatically elevated from the fourth week and maintained
thereafter at a high level for several weeks (Figure 3D). This agrees with clinical data
that all these SC patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid after the third
week. In contrast, LC patients showed a higher degree of longitudinal diversity in the
trends of expression of these proteins, probably partly due to their variable clinical
recovery trajectories. Expression of the first group of proteins in the first four weeks
was relatively stable but dramatically increased in the fifth week, followed by a
decrease from the sixth to the seventh week, and a second rise in the eighth week
(Figure 2D).
Interestingly, the expression of the second group of proteins displayed an
opposite trend compared to the first group (Figure 2E). Protein expression of the SC
patients started to decrease during the 4th week and continued to decrease until the last
time point; while the LC patients showed high protein expression level till the fifth
week, with a shallow decrease beginning in the sixth week (Figure 2E).
Dysregulated leukocyte migration and IFG/redox homeostasis
Pathway analysis of the two protein groups mentioned above highlighted
leukocyte migration and IGF/redox homeostasis (Figure 3).
Representative proteins related to leukocyte migration included beta-defensin 1
(DEFB1), selectin P (SELP), ezrin (EZR) and moesin (MSN) (Figure 3A). DEFB1 is
a ligand for the chemokine receptor CCR6 and a positive upstream regulator of Th17
(Wojtowicz et al., 2015). SC patients exhibited high expression of DEFB1 in the first
three weeks, but it decreased from the fourth week when patients became negative in
the nucleic acid test (Figure 3A). In contrast, LC patients exhibited a delayed increase
of this protein until the third week (Figure 3A), suggesting delayed activation of Th17
in LC patients. Leukocyte extravasation occurs in two sequential steps, among which
SELP participates in the first process of leukocyte adhesion to the endothelial surface
(Vicente-Manzanares and Sanchez-Madrid, 2004). In SC patients, expression of SELP
was relatively low in the first three weeks, and then increased significantly in the
fourth week and maintained at a high level until the ninth week (Figure 3A). SELP
increase in LC patients, however, was much shallower, and peaked as late as the
eighth week, in line with their prolonged disease course (Figure 3A). The complex of
ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) links cytoskeleton with membrane adhesion molecules;
however, moesin (MSN) and ezrin exert opposite functions (Ivetic et al., 2002). Our
data showed that EZR was maintained at a relatively high level during the first three
weeks in SC patients and then decreased thereafter (Figure 3A). Interestingly, in these
patients, MSN showed an opposite trend in which expression increased from the
fourth week and thereafter was maintained at a relatively high level. In LC patients,
the change of ERM components showed a similar pattern but with a delayed transition

point (Figure 3A).
In addition to the proteins directly involved in immunity, our data also
highlighted metabolic pathways such as the IGF/redox homeostasis pathway which is
critical in maintaining the microenvironment for immune responses (Figure 3A). We
narrowed our focus to proteins involved in IGF/redox homeostasis namely insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF1), superoxide dismutase (SOD1), glutathione synthetase (GSS)
and 5-oxoprolinase (OPLAH) (Figure 3A). IGF1 promotes the proliferation of Treg
cells (Anguela et al., 2013). In SC patients, expression of IGF1 increased from the
second to the sixth week, followed by a dramatic decrease in the seventh week, in line
with the recovery of these patients (Figure 3A). However, in LC patients, expression
of IGF1 slightly upregulated than in SC patients and increased until the eighth week,
followed by a slow decline thereafter. The expression of IGF1 is higher in the LC
patients than SC patients in the initial and the end of the disease stage (Figure 3A).
Infection-induced ROS was reported to accelerate the accumulation of Treg cells,
which led to immunosuppression (Yang et al., 2013). ROS may also induce the
expression of SOD1 in the mitochondria to reduce ROS as negative feedback (Ma,
2013). Our data showed that the expression of SOD1 peaked earlier in SC patients
(fourth week) than that in the LC patients (fifth week, Figure 4A), indicating that
clearance of infection-induced ROS in SC patients occurred earlier than in LC
patients. GSS and OPLAH are both involved in the glutamyl cycle that maintains
redox homeostasis (Forman et al., 2009). In the glutamyl cycle, GSS catalyzes the
generation of reduced glutathione (GSH). OPLAH catalyzes the conversion of 5oxoproline into glutamate and indirectly enhances the consumption of GSH. Our data
showed that GSS was upregulated in the fourth week in SC patients, about one week
earlier than its increase in LC patients (Figure 3A). In contrast, the downregulation of
OPLAH began in the fourth week in SC patients, while in LC patients it did not
substantially decrease until the eighth week (Figure 3A). The timely upregulation of
GSS and downregulation of OPLAH might contribute to the elimination of infectioninduced ROS in SC patients, while their delayed modulation may have contributed to
the prolonged disease course of LC patients.
Treg-mediated immunosuppression and crosstalk with other immune cells in the
LC patients
The leukocyte migration and IGF/redox homeostasis pathway may modulate the
activities of Th17 and Treg cells (Figure 3B). Th17 cells are a subset of T helper (Th)
cells. Th17 cells are differentiated from CD4+ T cells with a pro-inflammatory role
upon infection when IL6 is relatively high (Kimura and Kishimoto, 2010). The
upregulation of IL-6 has been reported as one of the most critical cytokines in severe
COVID-19 patients (Ruan et al., 2020). Our data suggested that activation of Th17
cells may play a role in T cell immunity in COVID-19. Opposite to Th17 cells, Treg
cells are induced from CD4+ T cells when IL-6 is relatively low and they suppress

activation of Th17. IGF1 promotes Treg cells. A higher level of IGF1 in the LC
patients suggested aberrant Treg-mediated immunosuppression in the LC patients
(Figure 3A). Besides, infection-induced ROS, regulated by GSS and OPLAH, may
also trigger Treg-mediated immunosuppression in LC patients as discussed above.
We next applied flow cytometry to analyze the CD127-CD25+ Treg cell
subpopulation in peripheral blood samples collected from disease onset to the fourth
week (SC: 17 patients, 30 samples; LC: 17 patients, 22 samples). The data showed
that the number of CD127-CD25+ Treg cells was significantly higher in LC patients
than that in SC patients (p=0.006), while the CD45+ lymphocytes (p=0.306) and
CD3+CD4+ T cells (p=0.871) did not show a significant difference (Figure 4A). The
data support the hypothesis that CD127-CD25+ Treg-mediated immunosuppression
may be induced in LC patients during the first few weeks. Inhibition of Treg cells
could be a potential therapeutic approach for COVID-19 patients with long disease
course.
More natural killer (NK) cells, especially the cytotoxic subset (CD3CD56+CD16+), were found in LC patients (Figure 4B). NK cells are a typical kind of
cells in innate immunity. In the meantime, CD3-CD56-CD16- cells were found to be
decreased in the LC group (Figure S6A-B). These cells are probably B cells, which is
further supported by our finding that the antibody level of these patients were also
decreased (Huang, 2020). The decrease of B cells may also be supported by the
finding that NK cells can inhibit the B cell immunity through reducing neutralizing
antibodies (Rydyznski et al., 2015). However, unfortunately we did not have sufficient
sample to stain these reduced cells with markers for B cells to confirm their identity.
We then measured the key cytokines and growth factors such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5,
IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-γ, and TNF-α of clinical importance. They were measured
using antibody-based method (SC: 17 patients, 30 samples; LC: 17 patients, 22
samples; Figure 5B and Figure S6C). Except for TNF-α, other molecules showed no
difference between SC and LC patients, probably because most patients in this study
were non-severe cases (Figure 5B). TNF-α was found to be increases in the LC group,
which might be associated with the upregulated NK cells.
However, in our proteomics data, we identified two key receptors for IL-6,
namely the alpha subunit (IL6R) and the beta subunit (IL6ST) of the interleukin-6
receptor. These two subunits are jointly required to mediate IL-6 signal transmission.
Overall, LC patients expressed higher IL6ST than SC patients did (Figure 5).
Interestingly, IL6R was upregulated in LC patients during the first four weeks
followed by a decline thereafter. In SC patients, IL6R expression did not show the
substantial change (Figure 5). This difference of IL6R expression trends may reflect
transient activation of Th17 during the prolonged disease course. We also detected the
dynamics of two proteins, transforming growth factor beta-1 protein (TGFB1) and
cytosol aminopeptidase (LAP3), which are associated with Treg function. LAP3 is
one of the surface markers of Treg, and TGFB1 regulated Treg and Th17 (Oida et al.,
2003). Similar to IL6ST, LAP3 also kept a higher level in the LC group across the
disease course than in SC patients (Figure 5). TGFB1 showed no difference between
the SC and LC patients (Figure 5).

Taken together, our data showed that NK cell-mediated innate immune and Tregmediated immunosuppression were both activated in the LC group, while CD3-CD56CD16- cells were decreased in the LC group, suggesting suppression of B cells which
may be associated with decreased antibody level.
Predictive model for the length of disease course
The above analysis showed that SC and LC patients have different proteomic
serological responses during the early phase of COVID-19 when the two groups of
patients were clinically indistinguishable during the first few weeks (Figure S1). This
raises the possibility of predicting disease course based on proteomic patterns during
the early phase. To test this, we built a random forest model using the serum
proteomic data collected during the first three weeks. We included a total of 80 serum
samples as a discovery dataset (Figure 6A) which were randomly divided into two
groups: a 66-sample training dataset (30 patients and 66 samples) and a validation
dataset (7 patients and 14 samples). Next, a previously published cohort (39 patients
and 39 samples) (Shen, 2020) was employed as an independent test dataset from a
different clinical center.
To select the most relevant proteins (referred as “feature” in machine learning),
we retrieved 174 significantly differentially expressed proteins from the proteomic
profiling of SC and LC patients during the first three weeks (Table S3). These proteins
were also identified in the independent test dataset. Then 58 features with highest
predictive accuracy were prioritized from the training set using random forest (4.6.14)
(Figure 6A, Figure S7A). After a six-fold cross-validation between the training set and
the validation set, a classifier with 35 feature proteins was finalized for classifying LC
patients with 100% accuracy in the training set (Figure 6A). The details of the 35 key
features are shown in Figure 6B. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), low
affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor 3-A (FCGR3A) and
immunoglobulin kappa variable 1-16 (IGKV1-16) are the top three ranked proteins,
which were significantly regulated in LC patients within the first three weeks (Figure
S7B). ICAM1 mediates cell-cell contact and promotes T cell apoptosis (Starke et al.,
2010). FCGR3A is involved in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC). The elevation of FCGR3A is consistent with the increase of NK cells in the
LC group. IGKV1-16 is a part of the variable domain of immunoglobulin light chain,
and it is secreted by B cell. IGKV1-16 was down-regulated in the LC group, which
might be associated with dysregulation of B cell in the LC as discussed previously.
We then applied the model to the independent test cohort from a different clinical
center. The model correctly classified 32 out of 39 patients with an overall accuracy of
82% (Figure 6C). Due to biosafety issues and the emergency of this pandemic, this
study is limited by the sample size. We noticed that the distribution of samples in the
different disease stage is different between discovery dataset and test dataset. The
numbers of serum samples of the discovery dataset are 18, 31 and 31 for the first,
second and the third week, respectively. However, the numbers for the test dataset are
21, 14 and 4, showing substantially lower proportions in the second and third week.
This difference was significant as measured by a two-sides Fisher’s exact test (p =

0.0004). The substantially higher number of samples collected in the first week have
probably contributed to the difficulty of correct classification by this model. Indeed,
the prediction accuracy was 92.9% for the samples collected in the second and third
weeks, while the accuracy was only 72.2% for the samples collected in the first week.
Future application and improvement of this model in larger clinical cohorts are
needed.

COVID-19 patients with short and long disease courses showed no significant
difference in clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and response to conventional therapy.
Our longitudinal sera proteomic analysis uncovered characteristic host responses in
sera of patients with long disease course, including enhanced NK cell-mediated innate
immune response and Treg-mediated immunosuppression at an early stage. Our data
also suggested CD3-CD56-CD16- cells might contribute to decreased production of S
protein specific antibodies in the patients with a prolonged disease course. Our data
suggest modulation of Treg cells may be potential therapeutics for these COVID-19
patients. We also showed that it is possible to predict the disease course of COVID-19
patients based on selected protein levels within the first three weeks after disease
onset. The model nevertheless requires further validation in independent cohorts.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Patients and sera samples
We procured 72 patients in this study, including 37 COVID-19 patients whose
sputa or throat swabs were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Shanghai BioGerm Medical Technology Co., LTD,
Shanghai, China). According to the Chinese Government Diagnosis and Treatment
Guideline (Trial 4th version) (Shen, 2020), these 37 COVID-19 patients include 35
typical cases and two severe cases. We have also procured 35 non-COVID-19
patients showing similar flu-like clinical symptoms to COVID-19 patients with
negative nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2. More details of these patients are
provided in Figure 1A and Table S1.
We defined the disease onset as the day when the patient manifests clinical
symptoms, while the disease recovery as the day when nucleic acid test of sputa or
throat swab turns negative, and negative for the second test after a minimal interval of
24 hours, the same test is still negative. The disease course was thus defined as the
period between disease onset and disease recovery.
Totally 224 sera samples from these patients were collected longitudinally for
proteomics analysis (Figure 1B, Table S1). Sampling was performed in the early
morning before diet using serum separation tubes (BD, USA). The blood was
clotted for about 30 min at room temperature, and then centrifuged at 1000 g for ten
min for serum sample collection. This study has been registered in the Chinese
Clinical Trial Registry with an ID of ChiCTR2000031699. This study has been
approved by the Ethical/Institutional Review Board of Wenzhou Central Hospital and
Westlake University. Contents from patients were waived by the boards.

Proteome analysis
Serum samples were prepared as previously described (Shen, 2020). Briefly, serum
samples were firstly inactivated and sterilized at 56 ºC for 30 mins. For proteomic
study, 4 μL of serum was used for each sample. The serum was firstly depleted of
14 high abundant serum proteins using a human affinity depletion kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific™, San Jose, USA). After depletion, the serum solution was
concentrated into 50 μL through a 3k MWCO filtering unit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific™, San Jose, USA) according to manufacturer. And then was mixed with
500 μL 8 M urea (Sigma) and concentrated into 50 μL. Then proteins were reduced
and alkylated with 10 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP, Sigma) and 40
mM iodoacetamide (IAA), respectively. Proteins were submitted to two times of
tryptic digestion (enzyme to protein ratio: 1:20; Hualishi Tech. Ltd, Beijing, China).
The digestion was then stopped with 1% trifluoroacetic (TFA) (Thermo Fisher) to
pH 2–3 to stop the reaction, and peptides were subjected to C18 (Thermo Fisher)
desalting.
TMT 16-plex (Thermo Fisher) reagents were applied to label the digested
peptides. The TMT labeled samples were further fractionated along a 2 hr basic pH
reverse phase LC gradient using a Dinex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC (Thermo Fisher)
(Li et al., 2020). LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using the Easy-nLCTM 1200
nanoLC-MS/MS system (Thermo Fisher) or a Dinex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC
coupled to a Q Exactive HF or HF-X (Thermo Fisher), along a 60 min LC gradient
at a flowrate of 300 nL/min as described previously (Gao et al., 2020; Shen, 2020).
To reach comparable proteomic depth, the fractionated samples were combined into
30 fractions for analysis in QE-HF instruments and 26 for QE-HFX instruments.
Database search and statistical analysis
MS data was performed using Proteome Discoverer (Version 2.4.1.15, Thermo
Fisher) (Colaert et al., 2011) search engine against the human protein
database downloaded from UniProt (version 02/01/2020; 164,930 sequences), with a
precursor ion mass tolerance of 10 ppm and fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.02 Da.
Please see previous paper (Shen, 2020) for detailed parameters of the database
searching. Briefly, TMT pro-plex labels to lysine and N-terminus, and
carbamidomethylation of cysteine were set as static modifications. A cut-off
criterion of a q-value of 0.01, corresponding to a 1% false-discovery rate (FDR) was
set for the filtered of identified peptides with highly confident peptide hits.
After filtering 80% missing rate proteins, 2700 proteins used for differential
expression analysis based on |log2(FC)| and two-sided unpaired Welch’s t test. The
created missing values were imputed with zero.
Pathway analysis
For the pathway enrichment analysis, firstly, four databases including KEGG
pathway, GO biological processes, Reactome gene sets and immunologic signatures
were used for immune characterization analysis on the Metascape web-based

platform (Zhou et al., 2019). IPA was then used to look at the pathways for
differentially expressed proteins.
Statistical analysis
Two-sided unpaired Welch’s t test was performed for each pair of comparing
groups. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to performed among
nine time points. Adjusted p values were calculated using Benjamini & Hochberg
correction.
Machine learning
The machine learning was performed using the R package randomForest (version
4.6.14) as described previously with some modifications (Shen, 2020) as described
briefly in the following. The discovery dataset was divided into two parts, i.e. the
training set and the validation set. We optimized the key random forest parameters
including the cutoff values for decrease mean accuracy, cross-validation fold, and the
number of trees. Input protein features were selected based on the mean decrease
accuracy cutoff. For the optimized model, the minimal mean decrease accuracy of
protein features was 2, the mtry was set as 13, and 800 trees were built. Six-fold cross
validation was performed and this was repeated 100 times.
Flow cytometry analysis
Peripheral blood samples from EDTA anticoagulants were incubated with
mixture antibodies including CD4-PE-Cy7 (UB105441, UB Biotechnology Co., Ltd,
Hangzhou, China), CD3-FITC (UB104411), CD25-PE (UB112421), CD45-PerCPCy5.5 (UB109481), CD127-APC (UB113451) and a kit (UB06PX) for cytokines
detection including IL-2/IL-4/IL-5/IL-6/IL-10/IL-17A/TNF-α/IFN-γ for 15 min at
room temperature. Double negative control and single-stain controls were prepared by
normal samples, and were used to calculate a compensation matrix. Sample
acquisition was performed on a Gallios (Beckman Coulter) cytometer equipped. Final
analysis and graphical output were performed using NovoExpress software (Agilent
Bio).
