Abstract
Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly
discovered coronavirus which are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many
different species of animals which can affect people physically and psychologically. The older
people and those with underlying medical problems are more likely to develop serious illness
and death.
Objective the aim of this study was to determine Covid-19 related stress and coping strategies
among adults with chronic disease in Bench-Sheko,West Omo and Keffa Zones, southwest
Ethiopia
Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study was applied among 613 adults with chronic
disease. A simple sampling technique was applied. Correlational analysis was used to determine
the relationship between the COVID-19 related stress score and coping strategy types. To
measure the strength of association between dependent variables and independent variables and
Pearson coefficients (r) with 95% Confidence interval (CI) were calculated.

Finally, the

variable, which shows statistical significance (p-value < 0.05 cut point) were used to quantify the
associations among variables.
Results: Around 613 participants of 96% response rate were participated. About 68.4% were
moderately stressed; low stress was 17.8% and severe stress was 13.9 %. Covid-19 related perceived

stress score were positively associated with coping strategies types of like sell-distraction, active
coping, denial, emotional support, behavioral disengagement, venting, and use of instrument,
positive reframing, self-blaming, planning, humoring and religion. The most preferable types of
coping strategies were religious, instrumental and active coping strategies and while the least
used were substance used.
Conclusion: Significant numbers of participants were suffered from severe perceived stress due
to covid-19 outbreak in this study area. Both adaptive and maladaptive Coping strategy types
were significantly associated with stress. Substance use and self-blaming were the types coping
strategies which were not associated with perceived stress.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered
coronavirus which are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different
species of animals, like camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Sometimes, animal coronaviruses can
infect people and then spread between people like with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with
SARS-CoV-2[1, 2]. The pandemic of corona virus disease have been affecting people both
physically and psychologically. So that many people have been experienced stress, anxiety and
depression reactions[3].
Stress during an infectious disease outbreak can include fear and worry about own health,
worsening of chronic health problems, worsening of mental health condition and also increased
use of alcohol and tobacco[4]. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience
mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However,
the older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness and
death[1]. The mental health and psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may be
more serious among those who have been in contact with the virus; those who are vulnerable to
biological or including people affected by mental health problems; health professionals; and even
people who are following the news through numerous media channels[5].
The corona virus disease outbreak is leading to health problems like stress, anxiety, depressive
symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger and fear globally. The pandemic and the containment
measure like quarantine, social distancing, and self-isolation can also have a detrimental impact
on mental health. The increased loneliness and reduced social interaction are risk factors for
many mental disorders. The collective concerns influence daily behaviors, economy, prevention
and decision making form health organization ,policy makers and medical centers, which can
weaken strategies of corona virus disease control and leads to more morbidity and mental health
needs at global level[5, 6].

Assessment of COVID-19 related stresses and coping strategy are a paramount at several levels.
The finding will be used to give appropriate intervention of COVID-19 related stresses and

coping strategy, it will provide sufficient data for any concerning body like health professionals,
policy makers and planers in advising the most vulnerable population for prevention and control
of COVID-19 physiological and psychological impacts timely and appropriately. It will fill the
information gap of the study area and it will provide a base line information for others researcher
to conduct similar study by considering the limitation of this study.

Globally the battle against physiological and psychological impact of COVID-19 is still
continuing. Some unprecedented measures have been adopted to control the COVID-19
transmission in all parts of Ethiopia, including the suspension of public transportation, the
closing of public spaces, close management of communities, and isolation and care for infected
people and suspected cases. The global mental health issues related to corona virus disease
outbreak may evolve into long-lasting health problems, isolation and stigma. the global health
intervention should be employed to address psychosocial stressors, particularly related to the use
of isolation/quarantine, fear and vulnerability among the general population like elder and those
who have chronic disease [7]. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be
stressful for people but coping with stress will make stronger[4]. Different people are reacting
differently to stressful situations. These situations mainly depend on the background of the
person, the things that make the people different from other peoples, and the community they
live in. The people who may respond more strongly to the stress of an outbreak are older people
and those with chronic disease[4]. The people at higher risk for severe illness like people with
chronic disease are at increased risk of stress due to corona virus disease outbreaks. Even though
some studies conducted in different parts of the world, they were mainly focused on general
population which lacks representation of the main risky population for both physiological and
psychological risks like individuals with chronic diseases which are unable to access easily
needed information and also routine health service are disrupted due to corona virus disease
outbreak[8]. In addition to managing their existing health conditions, coping with the stress
associated with the COVID-19 outbreak may be more challenging for people with chronic
disease. This suggests that understanding the perceived impact of pandemic can inform the
development of more adequate care and support, interventions, psycho education, and services

for people with chronic conditions. Moreover they are no any study conducted before regarding
to these risky groups in the study area. Therefore to facilitate outbreak prevention and control of
COVID-19 in Ethiopia, in particulars of Bench Sheko Zone, Kaffa Zone and West Omoo zone,
there was an urgent need to understand the perceived stress level and coping strategies types, in
particular, of those who are most vulnerable, of COVID-19 at this most critical time because of
the physiological and psychological long lasting impact of COVID-19. So that, this study was
aimed to investigate COVID-19 related perceived stress level and coping strategies types among
adults with chronic disease who live in the three zone of southwest Ethiopia.

Materials and methods
Study design
Institutional based cross-sectional study was applied.

Sample size determination
The required sample size of the study participants was determined by population proportion
formula of.

Assumptions;
n = the number of participant to be interviewed
Z = standardized normal distribution value at the 95% CI, which is 1.96
P = 50% was considered
d = the margin of error, taken as 5%
Because of the sampling procedure design effect of 1.5 was used.
*1.5= 576
After adding, a 10% of non-response rate the final sample size became 634.

Sampling technique
First, three district was selected from each zone by using simple random sampling technique and
then the health facility from each selected district was

selected again by simple random

sampling technique. After that, the calculated sample size was proportionally allocated to
randomly selected public health institutions in the three zones based on the number of chronic
disease who attending each health facility. To select study subjects from each unit of health care
service simple random sampling technique was applied by using client’s registrations number.

Data collection and analysis
The data were collected by using structured interviewer administered questionnaire by welltrained health professionals. Socio-demographics variables like age, residence, ethnicity,
religion, marital status, educational status, occupation, income, COVID-19 related stress, types
of coping strategies of adults with chronic disease were assessed.
All the data were checked for completeness and internal consistency by cross checking and then
was coded entered into Epi Data 4.6.0.2 computer software package and cleaned for
inconsistency. For further analysis, the data were exported to Statistical Package for Social
Science (SPSS) version 21 software. The descriptive analyses of data were indicated using
numerical summary measures and the data were presented using frequency tables, figures and
graphs. The correlational analysis was used to determine the association between the COVID-19
related stress score and coping strategy types among adults with chronic disease. To measure the
strength of association the Pearson coefficients (r) with 95% Confidence interval (CI) were
calculated. Finally, the variable, which shows statistical significance (p-value < 0.05 cut point)
were used to quantify the associations among variables.

Data collection instruments
The COVID-19 related stress was assessed by using the Perceive Stress Scale (PSS)) which was
adapted from previous study. The perceived stress scale which consists of 10 questions was used
to assess the perceived stress level. PSS is a 10 item scale where respondents rate themselves in a
five point scale (i.e. 0 = Never, 1 = Almost Never, 2 = Sometimes, 3 =Fairly Often, 4 = Very
Often). PSS scores were obtained by reversing responses (e.g., 0=4, 1=3, 2=2, 3=1& 4=0) to the
four positively stated items (4, 5, 7 and 8). Total scores would be obtained by summing all scale
items. Finally categorized as low Stress: those who scored ranging from 0-13 on stress questions,
moderate Stress: those who scored ranging from 14-26 on stress questions and high perceived
Stress those who scored ranging from 27-40 on stress questions[9, 10]
The coping strategies was assessed by using the Brief COPE Inventory scale .The Brief COPE
Inventory consists of 28 statements, across two scales, which can identify around 14 possible
coping strategies of stress but due to shortage of time we used 14 questions. It is focused mainly
on understanding the frequency with which people use different coping strategies in response to
various stressors. Participants using the inventory, score themselves from 1 to 4 with 1 being ‘I

haven’t been doing this at all’ and 4 being ‘I’ve been doing this a lot.’ The higher scores was
when the participants give the response of 3 or 4 for the given statement and the individually was
considered as highly using specific coping strategy as one of his core coping strategies. If they
score low – with a 1 or 2 – then we couldn’t consider as one of his core coping strategies[10, 11].
The Brief COPE Scores Scales were computed with no reversals of coding and it includes Selfdistraction, Active coping, Denial, Substance use, Use of emotional support, Use of instrumental
support, Behavioral disengagement, Venting, Positive reframing, Planning, Humor, Acceptance,
Religion and Self-blame[10, 11].
To assure the quality of the data, pre-structured questionnaire was used. The final version of the
questionnaire which was prepared in English were translated into the local language of the
respondents (Amharic) and again translated back to English. Both the data collectors and
facilitators were local languages speakers. The data collectors and supervisors were given one
day intensive training by principal investigator (PI) on the instruments, method of data
collection, ethical issues and the purpose of the study. Intensive supervision was done by
principal investigator and supervisor and they were checked the collected data for completeness,
accuracy, and consistency throughout the data collection period. The overall supervisions were
done by the principal investigators.

Discussion
This cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the impact level of covid-19 outbreak
pandemic on perceived stress and its coping strategies types which used to cope the perceived
stress; and the next aim was to identify knowledge level, attitude status and practice and
associated factors among chronic disease patients in Benk-Sheko, West Omoo and Kaffa Zone,
southwest Ethiopia. According to this study revealed the magnitude of perceived stress were
41.6%. According to this study results showed covid-19 related perceived stress score of the
participants were positively associated with coping strategies types of sell-distraction, active
coping , denial, use of emotional support, behavioral disengagement, venting, use of instrument,
positive reframing , self-blaming, planning, humoring and religion which mean that respondents
with higher levels of covid-19 related perceived stress were used the greater levels of selldistraction, active coping , denial coping, use of emotional support, behavioral disengagement ,
venting, use of instrument, positive reframing , self-blaming, planning, humoring and religion
types of coping strategies to prevent and control their covid-19 related perceived stress. This
finding is more likely consistent with the study conducted in unite state among individual of
disability and chronic condition[10]. The participants coping strategies like substance use and
acceptance were not associated with perceived stress in this study. The coping mechanism for
people with disabilities and chronic illnesses may take many forms [12]. The types of coping
strategies categorized in the Brief COPE as adaptive which are active coping, planning, use of
emotional support, use of instrumental support, positive reframing, religion, humor, and
acceptance; and maladaptive coping strategies like venting, denial, substance use, self-blame,
behavioral disengagement, and self-distraction types of coping strategies[13]. According to this
categorization, this study revealed that covid-19 related perceived stress score were associated
with both maladaptive (i.e., denial, behavioral disengagement, venting, self-distraction, and selfblame) and adaptive (i.e., active coping, use of emotional support, use of instrument, positive
reframing, planning, humoring and religion) coping strategies types among chronic disease
patients. COVID-19 is an ongoing and rapidly evolving situation, which can present challenges
and stressors in individuals with chronic disease. Therefore, findings from this study may help
clinicians, researchers, and policymakers gain a better understanding of the use of coping
strategies in individuals with chronic disease in facing this pandemic outbreak. According to this

participants were using religious, use of instrumental and using of active coping strategies for
management of covid-19 related stress. Around 76.3% of the participants were used religious
types of coping strategies and the second most used types of coping were use of instrumental
about 51.4% and while 51.2% were used active coping strategy for managements of covid-19
related perceived stress during this pandemic outbreak. This showing that participants of this
study had a tendency to cope with COVID-19 by using of religious, using of instrumental
methods and involving themselves with active coping strategy. This finding is inconsistent with
study which conducted in united states of America among disabled and chronic condition
individual who were most frequently used acceptance and self-distracting methods to cope with
covid-19 related perceived stress[14]. According to this study substance use type of coping
strategy was the most least frequently used types of coping among chronic disease patient. This
indicated that participants with chronic diseases were not very likely to use substance to cope
with COVID-19. This finding is similar with the previous study which conducted among chronic
condition and disability were used very unlikely of substance use and denial types of coping[10]
and it also consistent with world health organization recommendation and center of disease
control for coping of stress during covid-19 outbreak [4]

The main limitations of this study were shortage of time period for data collection which
occurred due the data need urgency and the others limitation was lack of validated and reliable
tools for perceived stress and coping strategies for this vulnerable groups. However some data
quality control mechanisms were conducted to minimize this limitation effects on the study.
Lack of previous studies also one of the main limitations. The main significance of assessment of
COVID-19 related perceived stresses and coping strategy types are a paramount at several levels.
One of it could be to give appropriate intervention types for COVID-19 related perceived
stresses and coping strategy types of the patients about covid-19. In addition, it could provide
sufficient data for any concerning body like health professionals, psychologist, policy makers
and planers in advising the most vulnerable population for prevention and control of COVID-19
physiological and psychological impacts timely and appropriately. It could fill the information
gap of the study area and it would be provide a base line information for others researcher to
conduct similar study by considering the limitation of this study
