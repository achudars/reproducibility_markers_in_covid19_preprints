Abstract
Background: To date, there has been limited data available to understand the associations
between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic and related characteristics with novel coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) vaccine initiation and planned vaccination in the United States.
Methods: To better characterize COVID-19 vaccinations nationally, we leveraged large crosssectional surveys conducted between January and March 2021 with relatively complete
race/ethnicity and socioeconomic data and nationally-representative of U.S. households to
estimate trends in levels of COVID-19 vaccine initiation and vaccine intention. We further used
survey data from January and March 2021 in adults aged 18-85 years to analyze the
associations between race/ethnicity, education, pre-pandemic household income, and financial
hardship during the pandemic and the adjusted odds of: 1) receipt of ≥1 dose of a COVID-19
vaccine; and 2) among those unvaccinated, the definite intention to receive a vaccine,
controlling for other demographic and socioeconomic factors.
Results: We observed persistent disparities in vaccine initiation for non-Hispanic Blacks,
Hispanics, and non-Hispanic multiracial persons, and in vaccine intention for Blacks and
multiracial persons, compared to non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Asians. In late March
2021, the prevalence estimates of Hispanics and Blacks receiving a vaccine were 12 percentage
points and 8 percentage points lower than for Whites, respectively. Moreover, both education
and income levels exhibited positive dose-response relationships with vaccine initiation (P for
trend≤01 and <.001, respectively). Substantial financial hardship was linked to 35-44% lower
odds of vaccination (P<.001). The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns
about side effects and safety, with evidence of higher levels of concerns about vaccine safety
among Blacks vs. Whites.
Conclusions: In this large, nationally-representative study with relatively complete
race/ethnicity and socioeconomic data, we find that being Black non-Hispanic and having the
least education and income were each independently associated with a markedly lower
likelihood of definitely planning to get vaccinated or having been vaccinated. In the ensuing
months of the pandemic, addressing the persevering racial/ethnic and socioeconomic
inequities in vaccination due to differential access and vaccine hesitancy is essential to mitigate
the pandemic's higher risks of infection and adverse health outcomes in Hispanic, Black, and
socioeconomically-disadvantaged communities.

Introduction
A recent CDC analysis examined demographic characteristics of nearly 13 million
persons who received ≥1 dose of one of two authorized coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) vaccines administered in the United States between December 14, 2020
and January 14, 2021.1 Data were collected by vaccination providers and reported to
CDC using various reporting methods including immunization information
systems. Individuals who were reportedly vaccinated represented approximately 5% of
the total U.S. population aged ≥16 years.1 Although data on age and sex were reported
for more than 97.0% of vaccine recipients, race/ethnicity information was missing for
nearly half (49.1%) of individuals, and no socioeconomic data were collected. The
study’s investigators and other epidemiologists have called attention to the critical need
for more comprehensive reporting of race and ethnicity data to ensure an effective
response to racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 vaccination, especially among those at
disproportionately higher risks for infection and severe adverse health outcomes
including racial/ethnic minorities.1-3 Furthermore, while the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices prioritized COVID-19 vaccination of healthcare personnel and
long-term care facility residents during the initial phase,4 equity considerations need to
be factored into vaccine allocation.5,6 To better characterize COVID-19 vaccinations
nationally, the present study leveraged nationally-representative data with relatively
complete race/ethnicity and socioeconomic data to estimate trends in levels of vaccine
initiation and intention by race/ethnicity over time, as well as to estimate the adjusted

relative odds of vaccine initiation and vaccine intention among adults according to
race/ethnicity and other demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.

Methods
Cross-sectional data were used from non-institutionalized adults aged 18-85 years in
the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) by the U.S. Census Bureau, nationallyrepresentative of U.S. households and administered over six periods of the HPS
between January 6, 2021 and March 29, 2021, comprising Phase 3 of the HPS.7 The
online survey response rates ranged from 6.4-7.5%.

The main predictors were race/ethnicity, education, pre-pandemic (2019) household
income, and financial hardship. Outcomes consisted of the self-reported: 1) receipt of
≥1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine; and 2) among those unvaccinated, the intention to
definitely receive a vaccine once available to the respondent. Less than 2% of
observations in the samples were missing for the items corresponding to these
outcomes.

Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to estimate adjusted odds ratios with
generalized estimating equations for each outcome to account for survey weights and
obtain robust standard errors. Log-Poisson regression was not employed due to bias
when estimating relative risks for binary outcomes.8 All models included all of the above
main predictors, and were also adjusted for age, gender, marital status, household size,
children in household, and state of residence. Multiple imputation analysis (using 20

multiply imputed datasets) was employed to handle missing data. All analyses were
conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute).

Results
During each HPS period, between 68,348 and 80,567 adults were surveyed,
representative of 243 million Americans. Of individuals who reported their COVID-19
vaccination status, race/ethnicity information was missing in 2.1-3.9% of the samples,
and was previously handled using hot deck imputation.7

Figure 1 illustrates the trends in racial/ethnic disparities in receiving ≥1 vaccine dose by
survey period between January 6, 2021 and March 29, 2021. During the January 6—
January 18 period, an estimated 5.9% of Hispanics, 5.9% of non-Hispanic Blacks
(Blacks), and 6.2% of non-Hispanic multiracial persons (multiracial persons) had
received a vaccine, compared to 8.1% in non-Hispanic Whites (Whites) and 13.3% in
non-Hispanic Asians (Asians). The prevalence of vaccine initiation steadily rose over
time for all racial/ethnic groups. During the March 17—March 29 period, an estimated
37.8% of Hispanics, 42.4% of Blacks, and 40.1% of multiracial persons had received a
vaccine, compared to 50.4% of Whites and 51.7% of Asians.

Figure 2 displays the time trends in racial/ethnic disparities in the definite intention to get
vaccinated among those not yet vaccinated. During the January 6—January 18 period,
an estimated 29.6% of Blacks, 47.3% of Hispanics, and 37.3% of multiracial persons
had a definite intention to receive a vaccine, compared to 55.5% of Whites and 66.0%
of Asians. The prevalence of vaccine intention was higher in subsequent time periods

for all racial/ethnic groups except for Whites. During the March 17—March 29 period, an
estimated 37.6% of Blacks, 52.9% of Hispanics, and 40.2% of multiracial persons had a
definite intention to receive a vaccine, compared to 46.6% of Whites and 71.1% of
Asians.

Based on data from the initial HPS period with vaccination questions (January 6—
January 18) and the last HPS period (March 17—March 29), controlling for other
demographic and socioeconomic factors, being of Black or multiracial race/ethnicity was
not characterized by a higher or lower likelihood of receiving ≥1 vaccine dose than
White race/ethnicity (Table 1). Meanwhile, Asian race/ethnicity was associated with a
higher odds of vaccine initiation than White race/ethnicity in the first and last survey
periods (P≤.001). Hispanic ethnicity was linked to a greater odds of vaccine initiation
than White race/ethnicity in the last survey period (P=.001).

Furthermore, both education and pre-pandemic income levels exhibited evidence of
positive dose-response relationships with vaccine initiation (P for linear trend ≤.01 and
<.001, respectively). Compared to those with at least a college education, those with
less than a high school education were 59-71% less likely to have been vaccinated
(P<.001). In addition, compared to those with pre-pandemic income levels ≥$200,000,
those with income levels <$25,000 were 34-47% less likely to have been vaccinated
(P<.001). Substantial (vs. no) financial hardship was further linked to a 35-44% lower
odds of vaccination (P<.001).

Among those not yet vaccinated, qualitatively similar patterns for race/ethnicity, prepandemic income, education, and financial hardship during the pandemic were primarily

observed for the outcome of a definite intention to receive the vaccine (Table 1).
However, unlike for vaccine initiation, Black race/ethnicity was associated with a 18%
lower likelihood of vaccine intention than White race/ethnicity (P=.02).

The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns about side effects
(Whites—48.0%; Blacks—46.0%; Hispanics—48.6%), and safety (Whites—42.2%;
Blacks—49.0%; Hispanics—42.6%) (Figure 3). There was evidence of higher levels of
concerns about vaccine safety among Blacks vs. Whites. Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians
all expressed lower levels of distrust in the government and lower levels of a belief of
not needing the vaccine than Whites (Figure 3).

Discussion
In this large, nationally-representative study with relatively complete race/ethnicity and
socioeconomic data, we find persistent disparities in vaccine initiation for Blacks,
Hispanics, and multiracial persons, and in vaccine intention for Blacks and multiracial
persons, compared to Whites and Asians, more than three months after COVID-19
vaccines first became available. To our knowledge, this study is the first to heed recent
calls for more complete race and ethnicity data to identify and characterize racial/ethnic
disparities in COVID-19 vaccination over time.1,2 By the latter half of March 2021, the
estimated percentage of Blacks receiving a vaccine was 8 percentage points lower than
for Whites. For Hispanics, levels of vaccine intention exceeded those for Whites by late
March 2021; however, the percentage with vaccine initiation then was still more than 12
percentage points lower than for Whites. These substantial disparities were present

despite the higher representation of Blacks and Hispanics in the vaccination priority
groups of healthcare and frontline and other essential workers (Phases 1a, 1b, and 1c)
in comparison to the entire U.S. population.9,10 For Hispanics, the disparities could
possibly reflect a lack of access to vaccines. After adjusting for other factors, having the
least education and income and experiencing substantial financial hardship during the
pandemic were each independently associated with markedly lower odds of vaccine
initiation and vaccine intention.

Controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors, Black race/ethnicity was linked
to a lower vaccine intention but not vaccine initiation than White race/ethnicity i.e., the
observed disparities in vaccine initiation between Blacks and Whites did not remain
when the distribution of demographic and socioeconomic factors were set to be equal in
the two groups. By contrast, in the same models, relatively consistent dose-response
relationships were observed for socioeconomic factors and financial hardship. In
keeping with causal interpretations of race/ethnicity in multivariable regression
models,11 these findings would appear to suggest that socioeconomic/economic factors
largely account for the observed disparities in vaccine initiation for Blacks vs. Whites.

Study limitations include its cross-sectional and observational design, which cannot rule
out bias due to confounding. While sampling weights and raking accounted for nonresponse and undercoverage, the low survey response rate could have led to selection
bias. Last, all measures were based on self-report, and could be subject to social
desirability bias for reporting vaccination.12

Despite the inherent limitations of this study, its core findings still underscore major
inequities in vaccine initiation by race/ethnicity (particularly for Blacks, Hispanics, and
multiracial persons), socioeconomic position, as well as financial hardship during the
pandemic. In the ensuing months of the vaccine rollout, addressing such persevering
racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in vaccination due to lack of access and
vaccine hesitancy is critical to mitigate the pandemic’s disproportionately higher risks for
infection and adverse health outcomes in Blacks and socioeconomically-disadvantaged
groups and to help maximize vaccination coverage nationwide.1,6 In addition to the
ongoing work of the CDC with jurisdictions to bring vaccines to socially vulnerable
communities,1 the federal government’s capacity to provide adequate economic relief to
reduce levels of financial hardship could play a vital role in improving overall vaccination
rates and reducing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in vaccination, while at
the same time attenuating negative impacts on the mental and physical health and
social needs of millions of Americans.13
