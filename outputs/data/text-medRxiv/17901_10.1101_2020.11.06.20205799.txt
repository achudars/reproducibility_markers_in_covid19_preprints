Abstract
Objective
To set up simple and reliable predictive scores for intensive care admissions and deaths in
COVID-19 patients. These scores adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a
multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guidelines.

Design
Monocentric retrospective cohort study run from early March to end of May in Clinique
Saint-Pierre Ottignies, a secondary care hospital located in Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve,
Belgium. The outcomes of the study are (i) admission in the Intensive Care Unit and (ii)
death.

Data sources
All patients admitted in the Emergency Department with a positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test
were included in the study. Routine clinical and laboratory data were collected at their
admission and during their stay. Chest X-Rays and CT-Scans were performed and analyzed by
a senior radiologist.

Methods
A recently published predictive score conducted on a large scale was used as a benchmark
value (Liang score)1. Logistic regressions were used to develop predictive scores for (i)
admission to ICU among emergency ward patients; (ii) death among ICU patients on 40
clinical variables. These models were based on medical intuition and simple model selection
tools. Their predictive capabilities were then compared to Liang score.

Results
Our results suggest that Liang score may not provide reliable guidance for ICU admission and
death. Moreover, the performance of this approach is clearly outperformed by models
based on simple markers. For example, a logistic regression considering only the LDH yields
to similar sensitivity and greater specificity. Finally, all models considered in this study lead
to levels of specificity under or equal to 50%.

Conclusions
In our experience, the results of a predictive score based on a large-scale Chinese study
cannot be applied in the Belgian population. However, in our small cohort it appears that
LDH above 579 UI/L and venous lactate above 3.02 mmol/l may be considered as good
predictive biological factors for ICU admission. With regards to death risk, NLR above 22.1,
tobacco abuse status and 80 % of respiratory impairment appears to be relevant predictive
factors. A predictive score for admission to ICU or death is desperately needed in secondary
hospitals. Optimal allocation of resources guided by evidence-based indicators will best
guide patients at time of admission and avoid futile treatments in intensive care units.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents an important and urgent threat to
global health. Since the outbreak in early December 2019 in the Hubei province of the
People’s Republic of China, the number of patients confirmed to have the disease has
exceeded 31,717,955 in more than 188 countries (as of 23 September 2020), and the
number of people infected is probably much higher2. More than 973,014 people have died
from COVID-19 infection (as of 23 September 2020)2. Despite public health responses aimed
at containing the disease and delaying the spread, several countries including Belgium have

been confronted with a critical care crisis. Outbreaks lead to important increases in the
demand for hospital beds and shortage of medical equipment. The adequacy of resources to
treat infected cases is therefore a growing public health concern.
The spread of COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic
transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having
community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers of severe cases. The latter is
the case for Belgium which has one of the highest incidence and death rates in the world
(9,955 deaths, corresponding to 858 deaths per million inhabitants (up to 23 September
2020)2. South of Brussels, in a region called Brabant Wallon in Belgium, where Clinique SaintPierre Ottignies is located, healthcare delivery has been compromised by critical resource
constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and healthcare workers. Optimal
allocation of resources has led us to build easily implemented clinical indicators in order to
best guide patients at the time of admission and avoid futile treatments in intensive care
units.
Time is a huge constraint in the management of COVID-19 patients during the pandemic. We
excluded from our study all biological variables that were not available within a few hours
after blood sampling. In doing so, we are in line with the reality of most non-tertiary care
hospitals in Europe.

Radiology
Thoracic imaging with chest radiography (CXR) and thoracic computed tomography (TCT) are
key tools for pulmonary disease diagnosis and management, but their role in the
management of COVID-19 has been sparsely considered within the multivariable context of
the severity of respiratory disease, pre-test probability, risk factors for disease progression,
and critical resource constraints. In a recent consensus article3, a multidisciplinary panel
comprised principally of radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries with experience
managing COVID-19 patients across a spectrum of healthcare environments has recently
evaluated the utility of imaging within three scenarios representing varying risk factors,
community conditions, and resource constraints. The main recommendations of this panel
of experts are:
•

Imaging is not routinely indicated as a screening test for COVID-19 in asymptomatic

Individuals;
•

Imaging is not indicated for patients with mild features of COVID-19 unless they are
at risk for disease progression;

•

Imaging is indicated for patients with moderate to severe features of COVID-19
regardless of COVID-19 test results;

•

Imaging is indicated for patients with COVID-19 and evidence of worsening
respiratory status;

•

In a resource-constrained environment where access to CT is limited, CXR may be
preferred for patients with COVID-19 unless features of respiratory worsening
warrant the use of CT.

These recommendations, quite sensible at first sight, are not confirmed by any study and are
challenged by our clinical experience. A recent review of the radiological manifestations of
COVID-19 gives no clear-cut conclusions4 and the association between radiological findings
and outcome remain elusive. We consequently included two radiological variables within the
features of interest and checked their statistical significance.

Tripod statements
A recent publication5 provides a review and critical appraisal of published and preprint
reports of prediction models for diagnosing patients with suspected infection, for prognosis
of COVID-19 patients, and for detecting people in the general population at risk of being
admitted to hospital for COVID-19 pneumonia. In this review, 31 prediction models were
included. The conclusions of the authors are clear-cut: all studies are rated at high risk of
bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of
patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and high risk
of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. Most reports
did not include a description of the study population or intended use of the models, and
calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. Authors recommended that further studies
should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for
individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline6.

Clinical score in the literature
Among the clinical scores available in the literature, one of them drew our attention1. Having
been recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine, it addresses the same issues as our

study, but was conducted on a much larger scale. According to the authors, the development
cohort included 1,590 patients. The mean (SD) age of patients in this cohort was 48.9 (15.7)
years; 904 (57.3%) were men. The validation cohort included 710 patients with a mean (SD)
age of 48.2 (15.2) years, and 382 (53.8%) were men and 172 (24.2%). From 72 potential
predictors, 10 variables were independent predictive factors and were included in the risk
score: chest radiographic abnormality (OR, 3.39; 95%CI, 2.14-5.38), age (OR, 1.03; 95%CI,
1.01-1.05), hemoptysis (OR, 4.53; 95%CI, 1.36-15.15), dyspnea (OR, 1.88; 95%CI, 1.18-3.01),
unconsciousness (OR, 4.71; 95%CI, 1.39-15.98), number of comorbidities (OR, 1.60; 95%CI,
1.27-2.00), cancer history (OR, 4.07; 95%CI, 1.23-13.43), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR,
1.06; 95%CI, 1.02-1.10), lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.002; 95%CI, 1.001-1.004) and direct
bilirubin (OR, 1.15; 95%CI, 1.06-1.24). The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) in the
development cohort was 0.88 (95%CI, 0.85-0.91) and the AUC in the validation cohort was
0.88 (95%CI, 0.84-0.93). The score has been translated into an online risk calculator that is
freely available (http://118.126.104.170/). The fact that the clinical score was validated on
an independent large population gives some credit to its applicability on a large scale. We
decided then to include this score in our study and, for each of our COVID-19 patients, we
calculated the clinical risk score at time d0 (day of admission to the emergency ward) using
the freely available calculator. We refer to this clinical risk score as Liang score. Liang score
prediction accuracy is used as a benchmark of our own search of a predictive model.
However, in contrast to Liang approach, we have distinguished two outcomes that cannot be
confounded: admission to ICU and death.

Research questions
1) Is it possible to predict admission of COVID-19 patients to ICU with routine and quickly
available clinical, biological and radiological variables? What is the prediction error of the
selected model(s)?
2) Is it possible to predict death among COVID-19 patients with routine and quickly available
clinical, biological and radiological variables, in order to avoid unnecessary treatment and
waste of precious resources? What is its prediction error?

Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 66 patients with known COVID-19 disease,
from March 10th to May 16th 2020 in Clinique Saint-Pierre Ottignies in Belgium. Twenty-two
patients admitted in Intensive Care Unit and 44 in Medicine Department. 63 patients were
positive for a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test. One patient included in the study was
negative for RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 but had an IgA and IgG ELISA-test positive for SARS-CoV-2
and ground-glass opacities on the chest X-ray.
All patients were followed from their admission at the emergency ward until they get out of
the hospital or until their death. No patient was excluded from the cohort. The follow-up
ended when patients leaved the hospital or died. The starting date of accrual and the enddate of accrual were reported for each patient.
This hospital is a 425-bed regional general hospital with a capacity of 15 intensive care beds,
which was increased to 25 beds during the pandemic. Clinique Saint-Pierre Ottignies has a
mission of para-university training of junior medical specialists. It covers a catchment area of
circa 400,000 patients, in the region of Brabant Wallon (Wallonia, Belgium).

Criteria of admission to the ICU
Twenty-two patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the ICU. For 19 patients the reason
was a respiratory failure defined as (i) ambient oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 88% with nasal
cannula oxygen therapy > 5l/min; (ii) PaO2 < 50 mmHg and/or a ratio PaO2/FiO2 < 150; (iii)
respiratory rate > 40/min. For one patient, the reason was a post-traumatic cerebral
hemorrhage, associated with altered neurological status (defined as Glasgow coma scale <
8/15) requiring mechanical ventilation in order to protect the airway. For another one, the
cause was the postoperative management of an empyema drainage developed in a context
of bacterial pneumonia complicating a SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. A third patient presented
a status epilepticus in the context of probable alcohol withdrawal.

Criteria of non-admission to the ICU
Clinique Saint-Pierre Ottignies has long-proven guide-lines for admission to ICU. Given the
nature of the health emergency, the principle of distributive justice7 was applied and each
patient admitted to the emergency department was immediately classified as "eligible for
intensive care" or "not eligible for intensive care", taking into account his or her previous

history and quality of life. The criteria for ineligibility were: (i) presence of a prior incurable
disease; (ii) limitation of functional autonomy; and (iii) advanced dementia. Two patients had
criteria for intensive care hospitalization upon admission to the emergency room, the other
patients were first hospitalized in a non-intensive care unit.
The patients admitted to intensive care all had the clinical criteria mentioned above, with a
pre-established maximalist therapeutic plan. Other patients with the same clinical criteria
but with a care plan with therapeutic limitations were not admitted. These therapeutic
projects were discussed collegially between medical specialties issued from emergency
department, internal medicine and critical unit.
The advantage of a simple predictive score upon admission could be useful in decisionmaking regarding a therapeutic plan.

Assessment of lung injury
A senior radiologist analyzed Thoracic Computer Tomographies (TCT) according to two
criteria: percentage of lung injury (continuous variable from 0 to 100%) and density of lung
injury (factor variable with 3 grades: 1 = light density; 2 = moderate density; 3 = high
density).

Data collection
Data collection tried to adhere as tightly as possible to the TRIPOD Adherence extraction
form (https://www.tripod-statement.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TRIPOD-Adherenceassessment-form_V-2018_12.pdf). At their admission, patients were questioned about their
usual medication and their health condition. The body mass index was computed. Collected
variables are the following: age, gender, ethnic group, weight, body mass index, number of
days with symptoms before hospitalization, asthenia, pyrexia, dyspnea, chest pain, aspecific
digestive symptoms, anosmia, ageusia, confusion, Travel or contact < one month, cigarette
consumption (Y or N), hypertension, diabetes, mental status (depression), angiotensinconverting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, immunosuppressive drugs, SpO2 (%), TCT % of lung injury, TCT density
of lung injury, blood type, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, blood platelets,
fibrinogen, ferritin, triglycerides, LDH, troponin, CRP, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio,

lymphocyte-to-CRP ratio, bilirubin and lactates. The dates of admission to ICU and death
were recorded.
In the ICU, the use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, clarithromycin,
remdesevir and antibacterial antibiotics (piperacill-tazobactam, meropenem, ciprofloxacin,
ceftazidime, amoxicillin clavulanate) was recorded on a daily basis.
As mentioned previously, the clinical risk score developed by Liang et al1 was computed
retrospectively for all COVID-19 patients at their admission to the emergency ward. This
clinical risk score was compared to our own models.

Statistical analysis
The number of collected variables being 40, the number of possible predictive models8 is
extremely large. Consequently, testing all of these models is not computationally feasible
and a preselection of potential predictive models was performed using a recently developed
method9. Among these models, we decided to consider four models that were in line with
medical practice and presented suitable prediction accuracy for ICU admission. These
models are logistic regressions based on the following variables: (i) LDH, (ii) LDH + sex, (iii)
LDH + sex + venous lactate, and (iv) respiratory impairment score (a combination of
percentage of lung injury, density of lung injury, and ambient oxygen saturation). Similarly,
three models presented were considered death: (i) Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio + Tobacco;
(ii) Liang score + Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio + Tobacco; and (iii) respiratory impairment
score.
As previously mentioned, logistic regressions were used in our study and this techniques
allows to addressed to our research questions based on binary variables. All analysis were
performed using the R software version 4.0.1 (https://cran.r-project.org/). This regression
technique is a widely used statistical tool that allows for multivariate analysis and modeling
of a binary dependent variable. The multivariate analysis estimates coefficients (for example,
log odds or hazard ratios) for each predictor included in the final model and adjusts them
with respect to the other predictors in the model. The coefficients quantify the contribution
of each predictor to the outcome risk estimation10. The caveats to consider when assessing
the results of a logistic regression analysis are well explained in Tolles et al.11. Theoretically,
every variable collected in the study could be a candidate predictor. However, to reduce the
risk of false positive findings and improve model performance, the Events Per Variable (EPV)

must be considered. A rule of thumb of 10 individuals per event is commonly applied12.
However recent studies have shown that EPV does not have a strong relation with metrics of
predictive performance, and is not an appropriate criterion for binary prediction model
development studies13. According to Vittinghof et al.14, predictive performance problems are
fairly frequent with 2–4 EPV, uncommon with 5–9 EPV, and still observed with 10–16 EPV.
The rule of thumb of 10 individuals per event can then be relaxed. In our study, EPV ranges
from 7 to 20. The binomial family logit function and the maximum likelihood approach were
used to compute the regression coefficients. The coefficients are then equivalent to the
relative risk of the outcome in the exposed group (COVID-19 patients).

Results
Admission to ICU and death are the relevant end-points of our study, and they have been
handled separately. Pathophysiology of COVID-19 is complex15 and the process leading to
death merges intrinsic factors (endothelial dysfunction16, thrombotic complications17,
respiratory distress syndrome18, renal failure19, cardiovascular collapse20, etc.) and extrinsic
factors to the disease (patient self-inflicted lung injury21, central nervous system impairment
due to long-term sedation22, etc.). Moreover, admission to ICU and death are outcomes that
are deeply different in nature. This point will be discussed further on. For both outcomes,
Liang score is the benchmark to which any predictive score will be compared to.

Admission to Intensive Care Unit
Predictive power of Liang score on the Belgian cohort was computed and used as a reference
standard for our selected models. Results are shown in Table 1. If the sensitivity of Liang
score value is high, its specificity is very low (0.10). Its regression coefficient is close to zero
and above the significance threshold of 5% (cf. Table 2). Liang score predicts 2 admissions to
ICU out of 20 patients and cannot reliably be used as a clinical tool in the emergency ward.
In the wake of this disappointing result, we computed our own predictive scores, with a
minimum number of covariates in order to keep the EPV in the 7 to 10 range. Based on
clinical experience and on recent recommandations5, Sex, LDH, Neutrophil to Lymphocyte
Ratio (NLR), venous lactate, SpO2, and respiratory impairment were selected as potential
predictive features. The respiratory impairment score is built out of three variables:
percentage of lung injury (continuous variable from 0 to 100%), density of lung injury (factor

Our predictive models are respectively: (i) LDH; (ii) LDH + Sex; (iii) LDH + Sex + Lactate; and
(iv) Respiratory impairment. The estimated parameters for these models are presented in

It appears that no score is quite satisfactory to predict admission to ICU. All scores that were
tested are flawed by a lack of specificity and cannot be reliably used in the emergency ward.
However, the absence of significant results does not mean that no valuable information can
be extracted. Indeed, there are two kinds of useful information that can be found in these
results.
First, a predictive score designed on a development cohort of 1,590 patients and validated
over 710 patients1 in China appears to perform poorly on a European population with overall
accuracy lower than 70% [95% CI : 0.5431-0.7841], and specificity around 10%. This
surprising result requires additional clarification. At first sight, the main reason of Liang score
poor performance on the Belgian cohort lies in the difference of end-points. Based on the
American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia23, Liang et al.
defined critical COVID-19 illness as a composite of admission to the intensive care unit,

admission to ICU, invasive ventilation, and death are serious outcomes of COVID-19 that
have been adopted in previous studies to assess the severity of other serious infectious
diseases. However admission to ICU, invasive ventilation, and death are end-points whose
nature is quite different. Admission to ICU and invasive ventilation depend on many extrinsic
factors such as availability of intensive care beds, hospital care policy, and fair allocations of
resources. These factors can vary widely over time. At the peak of the pandemic,
overcrowding of ICU beds can divert patients to lighter care structures. On the other hand,
death could be seen as a more “objective” end-point, less prone to health care policy
fluctuations. The difference of end-points may then explain the lack of predictive power for
Liang score. Another reason may lie in the genetics of population. This point deserves further
research.
The second information is that respiratory impairment performs better than Liang score but
can predict only 7 admissions to ICU out of 20. This finding confirms the fact that COVID-19 is
much more than a respiratory distress syndrome24; it is essentially a multiple endothelial
dysfunction25 with de novo angiogenesis and thrombosis26.

Death
A series of predictive scores were tested along with that put forward in Liang et al. Their
performances are displayed in Table 7. Surprisingly, the LDH does not appear to predict
death reliably while it was the central variable for ICU admission. The only factor that seems
to prodive reliable information. Indeed, a logistic regression based on this variable
outperforms Liang score but its specificity remains low (24%). Two other models were
considered: (i) NLR + Tobacco, (ii) NLR + Tobacco + Liang score, which provides similar
predictive results. Logistic regression coefficients are displayed in Tables 8 to 11.

Similar conclusions can be drawn as those made for ICU admission. Firstly, a promising score
from a large-scale study in China appears to perform poorly when applied to a European
cohort, mainly by lack of specificity. Secondly, biological features that are quite significant
for the admission to ICU such as LDH (cut-off 579 UI/l) or venous lactate (cut-off 3,02
mmol/l) cannot predict death, suggesting that these two outcomes should be clearly
distinguished. Nevertheless, in our cohort we report a significant NLR cut-off of 22.1. Thirdly,
the percentage of respiratory impairment (which is not significant for admission to ICU, cf.
Table 6) is significant to predict death.

Conclusions
A predictive score for admission to ICU or death is urgently needed in secondary hospitals
such as Clinique Saint-Pierre Ottignies. Interleukine-6 (IL-6) has been shown as a marker of
severity of the disease. Meta-analysis of mean IL-6 concentrations demonstrated three-fold
higher levels in patients with complicated COVID-19 compared with patients with
noncomplicated disease27. However, most developed countries hospitals cannot afford
costly laboratory exams. Optimal allocation of resources guided by clinical-based indicators
will best guide patients at time of admission and avoid futile treatments in intensive care
units. These indicators are still lacking. Wynants et al.5 have shown that proposed models in
the literature are at high risk of bias and their reported performances probably optimistic.
We show that a predictive score based on a large scale population study1 may not be reliable
enough to be implemented in Belgium, both for admission to the ICU and for death, mainly
because of lack of specificity. However, in our small cohort it appears that LDH above 579
UI/l and venous lactate above 3.02 mmol/l may be considered as good predictive biological
factors for ICU admission. On the other side, death risk can be assessed by NLR above 22.1,
tobacco abuse status and a 80% of lung injuryrespiratory impairment. The development of
reliable predictive methods are of great importance to ensure fair allocation of scarce
medical resources in time of COVID-1928. However, our results suggest that available
methods may not have to require accuracy to be beneficial in emergency ward.
