Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for rapid protein detection and quantification at the
single-molecule level in a format that is simple and robust enough for widespread point-of-care
applications. We here introduce a modular nanobody-organic electrochemical transistor
architecture that enables the fast and specific detection and quantification of single-molecule to
nanomolar protein antigen concentrations in complex bodily fluids. The sensor combines a new
solution-processable organic semiconductor material in the transistor channel with the highdensity and orientation-controlled bioconjugation of nanobody fusion proteins on disposable gate
electrodes. It provides results after a 10 minutes exposure to 5 µL of unprocessed samples,
maintains high specificity and single-molecule sensitivity in human saliva or serum, and is rapidly
reprogrammed towards any protein target for which nanobodies exist. We demonstrate the use of
this highly modular platform for the detection of green fluorescent protein, SARS-CoV-1/2, and
MERS-CoV spike proteins and validate the sensor for COVID-19 screening in unprocessed
clinical nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples.

SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than one million fatalities as of October 20201, and may remain a
worldwide health and economic burden for several years2. Owing to airborne transmission3 and a
large share of symptom-free but infective carriers4,5, this virus defies traditional suppression
measures that are based on the isolation of symptomatic individuals. Molecular testing has
therefore become an essential tool in global attempts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic6. Testing
currently relies on the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), a wellestablished diagnostic method with close to single-molecule sensitivity7. RT-PCR, however,
requires complex sample processing in specialized, well-instrumented laboratories. Due to the
limited capacity of these laboratories, and the required logistics, results are typically
communicated one to several days after sample collection. This delay in isolating infected carriers
is severely hampering the suppression of infection chains8.
In a point-of-care (POC) setting, lateral flow immunoassays could offer an alternative as they
detect viral protein (rather than RNA) directly in unprocessed patient samples and give qualitative
results within 15 to 30 min. Yet, fast immunoassays detect viral loads above 50 million copies/mL,
which is useful for the isolation of highly infectious individuals, but not sensitive enough for
diagnostic purposes9. Enzymatic nucleic acid detection based POC assays, on the other hand,
generally have to trade off sensitivity and robustness against sample processing and reaction
times10. Thus, the COVID-19 crisis highlights a critical limitation of our current POC diagnostics
toolbox. What has remained elusive so far is rapid protein detection at the single-molecule level
in a format that is simple and robust enough for widespread POC or bedside application. We here
present a bioelectronic sensor platform that fulfils these requirements.
Recent years have seen major progress in the development of transistors which transduce and,
importantly, amplify biological reactions or binding events into an electrical readout11–14. Organic
electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have emerged as an alternative bioelectronic transducer that
outperforms all other electrolyte gated transistors and performs favorably compared to most solidstate technologies with their record-high transconductance values15. OECTs operate in aqueous
media and integrate ion-permeable conjugated polymers in their channel which is volumetrically
(de)doped by electrolyte ions injected by a gate electrode. The volumetric coupling between ionic
and electronic charges in the channel makes OECTs powerful voltage amplifiers, as such, even a
few binding events at the gate electrode can cause large modulations in the channel current 16–18.
This efficient, on-site, amplification of input signal allows for miniaturization and low-noise

recordings, which should make OECTs particularly suitable for POC applications17. Despite these
advantages, there are only few reports of label-free OECT immunosensors19,20. More generally,
current electronic protein sensors appear to translate poorly into real-world applications. Common
drawbacks include complex sensor designs, high noise, the need for tightly controlled
environments, reliance on regular off-the-shelf antibodies and their chemical immobilization in
random orientations21.
We overcame these limitations in protein detection with a bioelectronic platform that advances
OECT technology on several levels, ranging from chemical materials to biological recognition.
Key features in this process were (i) the use of a novel organic semiconductor that allowed for the
first practical implementation of an accumulation-mode OECT and (ii) the controlled
biofunctionalization of the sensor surface with (iii) custom-engineered nanobodies22. The
accumulation-mode OECT combined high output signal strength and stability with very low input
power requirement. The bioassembly strategy coupled recombinant protein in a precisely defined
orientation at very high physical density.
We demonstrate that the resulting platform is fast (<15 min from sample to result) and works with
unprocessed saliva or serum samples. The sensor is largely reusable, easy to manufacture, and
highly modular. It reliably and specifically detects single protein molecules on millimeter-sized
disposable electrodes in uncontrolled, ambient environments. The sensor is also quantitative and
distinguishes concentrations over 8 to 10 orders of magnitude (attomolar to nanomolar).
Experience with three different target proteins shows that our platform is broadly applicable and
only limited by the availability of antigen-specific nanobodies. We validated the performance with
clinical unprocessed nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples from COVID-19 patients, and
demonstrate a sensitivity comparable to RT-PCR methods.

Fig. 1 | Schematic illustration of the nanobody-functionalized OECT sensor. a) Operation:
The gate electrode is exposed to a mix of sample (such as saliva) and binding buffer (1), rinsed
with PBS (2), and mounted on top of the OECT channel for signal acquisition (3). b) Gate
functionalization layers. Chemical and biological monolayers (Chem-SAM and Bio-SAM) are
self-assembled on the gate electrode surface. c) Molecular architecture. A synthetic SpyTag
peptide is chemically coupled to the 1,6-hexanedithiol (HDT) monolayer to form a Chem-SAM.
The nanobody-SpyCatcher fusion protein then attaches itself to this chemical layer through the
autocatalytic formation of a covalent SpyCatcher-SpyTag bond, forming the Bio-SAM. The
nanobody domain defines sensor specificity and is interchangeable. Bovine serum albumin (BSA)
is physisorbed on the sensor surface during the final step of functionalization to prevent nonspecific binding.

Biofunctionalization
Nanobodies22 are compact recognition modules made from the antigen-binding domain (VHH) of
an unusual class of heavy chain-only antibodies found in Camelids23. Although several
therapeutic24 and diagnostic applications25 have been developed, nanobodies have not yet been
combined with OECT technology. One report described the functionalization of a conventional
field effect transistor (FET) with nanobodies. This platform relied on random chemical

immobilization of nanobodies on carbon nanotubes and reached ~1 pM detection limit for green
fluorescent protein (GFP)26. To improve on these previous studies, we capitalized on the fact that
nanobodies (and modified versions thereof) can be efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli. We
designed a recombinant protein where the well-characterized anti-GFP nanobody27 is fused,
through a flexible peptide linker, to a SpyCatcher domain (Fig. 2a). This SpyCatcher domain is
specifically recognized by a short SpyTag peptide, triggering the autocatalytic formation of a
covalent isopeptide bond linking both of them with very high stability. Originally engineered from
a bacterial adhesion protein28, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher protein conjugation system has been used
for several applications29, but has not yet been applied to FET or OECT biosensors. The only
related application of a nanobody-SpyTag fusion was a passive, impedance-based sensor for the
detection of microalgae30 which relied on the random chemical immobilization of separated
SpyCatcher proteins as a capture reagent.

For our platform, we wanted to avoid steps where the proteins (nanobody or SpyCatcher) are
chemically modified or immobilized in a way that could partially impair their function. Instead,
we opted for the immobilization of a chemically modified SpyTag, obtained through regular
commercial peptide synthesis, on a 1,6-hexanedithiol (HDT) self-assembling monolayer, thus
forming a combined Chem-SAM on top of the gold gate electrode. The anti-GFP nanobody27SpyCatcher fusion protein was genetically encoded, gene synthesized and produced in E. coli. The
purified protein construct was then incubated under physiological conditions with the Chem-SAM,
thus completing the sensing surface with a self-assembled Bio-SAM. This strategy leads to a
defined biofunctionalization layer in a precisely controlled molecular configuration and
orientation, which can be modelled at atomic resolution (Fig. 2b). A flexible 8-amino acid glycineserine linker separates nanobody and SpyCatcher domains dynamically and sterically. Taking into
account unstructured residues contributed by the nanobody and SpyCatcher domains, the 4 nm
long nanobody domain is separated from the SpyCatcher adapter by about 30 amino acids, forming
a ~12 nm long flexible molecular leash (Fig. 2a,b). Additional flexibility is introduced by short
glycine-serine and alkane linkers that separate the chemically synthesized SpyTag sequence from
the underlying HDT, thus also giving the SpyCatcher domain some freedom to move and rearrange
itself above the Chem-SAM.

The three immobilization steps (HDT, SpyTag, nanobody-SpyCatcher) were monitored through
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D),
cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Upon
functionalization with the HDT layer, the gold electrode displayed characteristic thiol-gold (S-Au)
and free thiol (-SH) peaks in its high-resolution S 2p XPS spectrum31,32, indicating the upright
orientation of HDT linked to gold through only one of the two -SH moieties (with the other
terminal pointing away from the surface) (Fig. 2c). As we successively introduced SpyTag peptide
and then the nanobody fusion protein on top of the Chem-SAM, a new peak appeared at about 163
eV, which we attributed to the S-C bond from protein methionine residues (Fig. 2c)33. High
resolution C 1s and N 1s XPS spectra further demonstrated the Bio-SAM formation by revealing
C-O, C-N, C-OOR bonds, and nitrogen groups on the surface (Fig. S1). Formation of all layers
was further corroborated by EIS and CV measurements, which showed a decrease in the
electrochemical capacitance of the gold electrode and an increase in its charge transfer resistance
with the addition of (insulating) Chem-SAM and Bio-SAM (Fig. S2).

To assess the packing density of biomolecules on the surface, we monitored the immobilization
of, first, the maleimide-modified SpyTag peptide and, second, the nanobody-SpyCatcher fusion
protein on the Chem-SAM by QCM-D. We quantified the mass gained from the two conjugates to
be 114 and 406 ng cm-2, respectively (Fig. 2d and Fig. S3). Based on a molecular weight of 1.76
kDa and 28.4 kDa for the SpyTag peptide and nanobody-SpyCatcher protein, respectively, 39 ×
1012 SpyTag peptides and 8.6 × 1012 nanobody-SpyCatcher molecules were coupled per cm2. This
density translates to only 3.4 nm mean inter-particle distance between the SpyCatcher domains at
the base of the Bio-SAM. Given the size of this domain (about 4 × 2.5 nm), we are thus
approaching the maximum coupling density that is physically feasible. The formation of this
exceptionally high-density biorecognition layer is likely further facilitated by the compact
nanobody, which has similar dimensions to the SpyCatcher domain but is given additional freedom
to pack and reposition itself through the flexible inter-domain linker (Fig. 2b).

SpyCatcher fusion protein (without BSA) in real-time, starting from an HDT-coated gold
electrode.

Optimization of protein detection
We used the detection of GFP with the anti-GFP nanobody-conjugated gate electrode as a model
to optimize multiple parameters of the sensor design. Initial optimization rounds addressed
unspecific binding which was eliminated by adding bovine serum albumin (BSA) and a mild
detergent (Tween-20) to both the nanobody-SpyCatcher protein immobilization and the targetbinding solutions. The co-addition of BSA with SpyCatcher protein outperformed other blocking
strategies. Comparing QCM-D binding traces with (Fig. 2d) and without BSA (Fig. S3), we
suggest that BSA may be primarily capturing contaminating proteins in solution rather than
binding to and blocking the surface in a classical sense. We next optimized the OECT geometry
through systematic variation of gate and channel sizes. The highest sensitivity towards GFP was
attained with an OECT having a gate electrode area of 0.64 mm2, and a channel width of 100 µm
and length of 10 µm (Fig. S4).

The optimized PEDOT:PSS OECTs were operated in PBS under ambient conditions by varying
the gate voltage (VG) between -0.6 V and 0.6 V while the drain voltage (VD) was swept from 0 to
-0.6 V. We assessed the sensing signal by monitoring the drain current (ID) as a function of the VG
at a fixed VD = -0.6 V. The reference (blank) response of the sensor was acquired by exposing the
nanobody-functionalized gate electrode to the binding buffer without GFP (Fig. 3b). The same
electrode was then incubated for ten minutes with a 5 µL drop of binding buffer containing GFP,
rinsed twice in PBS, and then stacked vertically on top of the channel separated by PBS
(phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, ionic strength 0.162 M) to complete the OECT biosensor (Fig.
1a). After gate exposure to GFP, ID underwent a notable reduction at all gate voltages applied. As
the GFP concentration increased, this sensor response became more evident (Fig. 3b). Similarly,
the transconductance of the devices decreased as GFP interacted with the gate electrode (Fig. S5a).
In contrast, the device characteristics did not change if the gate electrode was incubated in solutions
containing equivalent molar concentrations of non-target molecules such as an FRB-mCherry
fusion (Fig. 3c, Fig. S5b) and lysozyme (Fig. S6). Lysozyme is abundant in saliva which we

The trend in ID and gm can be clearly attributed to the specific binding of GFP to the nanobodyfunctionalized gate electrode. Fluorescence images confirmed the specific capture of GFP, but not
mCherry (Fig. S7). The GFP-nanobody interaction increases the impedance at the gate
electrode/electrolyte interface (Fig. S8), resulting in a voltage drop therein and a less efficient
capacitive coupling between the gate and the channel. Hence, we measure a reduction in the current
and its modulation as GFP-binding weakens the electrical driving force acting on the cations. Torsi
and co-workers observed similar changes in PEDOT:PSS OECT characteristics, where the ID
decreased upon a protein binding event at the functionalized gate electrode20. We note that the
decrease in ID is not due to a degradation of the channel over consecutive I-V cycles (Fig. S9).
Neither did we observe a change in gate current (IG) upon GFP binding, and the value of IG was
six orders of magnitude lower than the ON current of the OECT (Fig. S10). To quantify the sensor
response and minimize device-to-device variations, we calculated the normalized response (NR)
of the OECT by normalizing the target protein-induced change in ID at a single VD and VG, to its
value previously measured after exposure to the blank solution. The NR vs. GFP calibration curve
revealed that the nanobody-functionalized OECT detects GFP with a lowest limit of detection
(LOD) of 23 fM (Fig. 3d). The NR was less than 5% even for the highest concentrations of
negative controls (mCherry and lysosome) while it exceeded 30% for higher GFP concentrations.
Overall, PEDOT:PSS-based OECT biosensors were sensitive to the presence of 6 × 104 GFP
molecules in 5 µL of buffer and responded within a dynamic range of six orders of magnitude.
This sensitivity is on-par with commercial colorimetric ELISA assays which, however, take hours
to complete, require larger sample volumes and have a far narrower dynamic range34.

Sensing with accumulation mode OECTs
As PEDOT:PSS is intrinsically doped, our biosensors operate in depletion mode, that is, ID
decreases with an increase of VG. High OFF currents and the VG applied to keep the device in its
off-state increase power consumption and may diminish material stability during long term
use. Recent studies expanded the available OECT channel materials through the chemical design
of undoped, conjugated backbones which were functionalized with hydrophilic side chains that
facilitate ion injection and transport in the film16,35. OECTs comprising these materials operate in
accumulation mode, that is, the channel is OFF and generates a current upon application of a small

gate voltage17. This operation mode allows for low-power electronics applications, improves
device stability, and is more compatible with integrated circuit designs that conventionally involve
accumulation mode transistors. Nevertheless, accumulation mode OECTs for biochemical sensing
have not yet been reported. We, therefore, replaced PEDOT:PSS with a recently designed
conjugated polymer, p(g0T2-g6T2)36 (Fig. 3e). p(g0T2-g6T2) is a mixed (ionic and electronic)
conductor. A negative VG pushes anions into the film that compensate for the holes injected from
the metal contacts, turning the device ON (Fig. S11). The maximum gm occurs at a VG of ca. -0.3
V and the transconductance efficiency (gm obtained per unit current), is very high at low VG due
to the exponential ID vs. VG characteristics. This behavior is similar to the subthreshold region of
operation in traditional inorganic metal oxide semiconductor FETs37. The material also shows
exceptional operational and environmental stability (Fig. S12), thus overcoming the limitations of
the currently available organic mixed (semi)conductors36.

Fig. 3f shows the typical transfer characteristics of p(g0T2-g6T2) OECTs gated with the
nanobody-functionalized gold electrodes incubated in solutions with varying GFP concentrations.
As GFP bound to the gate, ID decreased for all gate voltages. This decrease was accompanied by a
significant shift in the threshold voltage (Vth) towards more negative values (Fig. S13). Similar to
PEDOT:PSS sensors, p(g0T2-g6T2) OECTs showed no significant response to mCherry (Fig. 3g)
and lysozyme (Fig. S14) (at closer inspection, our data suggest a minor cross-reaction of the antiGFP nanobody with the structurally similar mCherry). The sensor responded to a GFP
concentration as low as 4.7 aM (NR = 7%) (Fig. 3h) with a dynamic range spanning 10 orders of
magnitude. We calculated the lowest limit of detection (LOD) for these devices to be 14 aM,
corresponding to 42 molecules in the 5 μL sample. Compared to the otherwise identical
PEDOT:PSS-based sensor, the accumulation mode OECT thus showed a 1000-fold improved
sensitivity (aM compared to fM) and yet larger dynamic range (10 orders of magnitude, from aM
to nM, compared to 6 orders of magnitude). Moreover, we noted a much lower operating voltage.
The target response was maximized (and off-target response minimized) at VG = VD = -0.1 V
compared to VG = VD = |0.6𝑉| for the PEDOT:PSS OECT (Fig. S15). Such characteristics would,
in principle, allow for nanobody-OECT reader devices with very compact built and long battery
life.

From a biochemical point of view, the observation of binding at such low concentrations was
initially surprising. The 14 aM detection limit lies 30 million-fold below the consensus equilibrium
dissociation constant (KD~0.5 nM) reported for the interaction between nanobody and GFP38.
However, given the density of nanobody molecules (8.6 × 1012 / cm2, see above) and assuming the
domain is diffusing within a 20 nm layer above the sensor surface (Fig 2b) we arrive at a local
nanobody concentration of about 700 µM. Any target molecule diffusing into this capture layer
will therefore necessarily bind. Once bound, the interaction's low koff rate38 (~1.5 × 10-4 s-1
corresponding to 80 min half-life) will trap the target molecule throughout all washing steps. In
fact, our surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements indicate an even lower, essentially
unmeasurable, off rate for this complex with our own protein and buffer conditions (Fig. S16).
The high-density nanobody-functionalized gate electrode thus operates as a kinetic trap for target
molecules. Sensitivity is likely not primarily dictated by nanobody:target affinity (KD) but by target
diffusion and the kinetic stability of the complex (koff). We were thus hopeful to reproduce sensor
performance with other nanobodies.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV antigens
The VHH72 nanobody was originally raised against SARS-CoV receptor binding domain (RBD).
Subsequently, VHH72 was shown to also bind SARS-CoV-2, at a slightly reduced affinity, and it
became the first publicly available nanobody sequence against this new target39. Our VHH72 spyCatcher fusion construct expressed well in E. coli and could be purified to a high yield (54
mg/L of culture) as a monomeric protein. Although SARS-CoV-2 was our primary diagnostic
target, we also designed and expressed constructs for the detection of MERS-CoV based on the
previously reported nanobodies VHH8340, VHH0440, and VHH5539. The VHH04-spyCatcher
fusion yielded high-quality monomeric protein and was advanced to OECT experiments. Both
VHH72 and VHH04 bind to the RBD of the homotrimeric (SARS or MERS, respectively)
Coronavirus Spike (S) protein41 which protrudes from the virus surface in multiple (about 100)
copies. The RBD is a small (27 kD) protein domain within the larger S1 subunit (76 kD) and is
directly responsible for the recognition and binding of the specific host cell receptor. The detection
of RBD would therefore be a good indicator for the presence of infectious viral particles. SPR
experiments confirmed the binding of both nanobody fusion proteins with their respective,
recombinantly expressed, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV target proteins (Fig. S17).

As expected, VHH04 showed the highest affinity (KD=0.1 nM) and slowest koff (2×10-4 s-1) for its
target MERS-CoV S1. VHH72 bound its primary target SARS-CoV(1) RBD with lower affinity
(KD=7 nM), owing to a faster dissociation (3×10-3 s-1). The interaction with the closely related
RBD of SARS-CoV-2 showed a mixed signal, where a smaller share of fast-on, fast-off binding
events was distorting the main slow-on, slow-off binding regime (KD=23 nM, koff=3×10-4 s-1).
Such a signal was also reported for the interaction with a more recently developed nanobody42 and
may indicate an intrinsic heterogeneity of this RBD.

Nevertheless, SARS-CoV nanobody-functionalized OECTs showed an excellent response to the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 subunit, regardless of the channel material used (Fig. 4a and b).
Incubation of the same gate electrodes with various concentrations of GFP did not evoke any
current response, demonstrating the high specificity of the VHH72-functionalized gate for the viral
proteins. The device also responded to the original target of VHH72, the SARS-CoV-1 RBD (Fig.
S18). In direct comparison, the higher affinity of VHH72 for SARS-CoV-1 RBD compared to
SARS-CoV-2 RBD did only translate into a small signal increase. By contrast, the larger SARSCoV-2 S1 spike protein (comprising the same RBD) generated much larger current changes than
the isolated RBD. This increase in NR may stem from higher affinity or size or both. We assume
that the S1 subunit will, at least partially, form trimers in solution (all concentrations given in this
study refer to the monomer) and thus benefit from avidity effects with substantially increased
affinity (and prolonged residence) on the gate surface. Compared to RBD alone, both the S1
monomer or trimer would also cover a larger area on the functionalized surface than the isolated
RBD. Akin to our GFP sensors, p(g0T2-g6T2) OECTs showed higher sensitivities than
PEDOT:PSS devices. p(g0T2-g6T2) OECT detected SARS-CoV-2 S1 at 4.7 aM with a 30%
change in the NR (𝜎𝑆𝐷 = 7% at most), translating to a nominal LOD of 18 zM. In fact, a single
molecule in our 5 µL measurement volume corresponds to a concentration of 3.3 aM which
appeared to be easily detected.

Having confirmed single-molecule sensitivity and high specificity of SARS-CoV nanobody
OECTS when target proteins were captured in the binding buffer, we turned our attention to sensor
performance in saliva. Saliva samples are reported to exhibit comparable or higher viral loads than
nasal swaps43,44. While this may not lead to perfect sensitivities under real-world sampling
conditions45, saliva is clearly the better medium for point-of-care or field applications. We,

therefore, challenged SARS-CoV nanobody-functionalized OECTs comprising p(g0T2-g6T2)
channels with human saliva samples into which we spiked predetermined amounts of target and
non-target proteins. The NR increased with the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in saliva
and showed only negligible change when the same gate electrode was exposed to GFP (Fig. 4c).
As before, sensor response already picked up at the single-molecule concentration threshold (Fig.
4d). The sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 S1 in saliva (LOD = 1.2 × 10-21 M) was comparable to that
in buffer (LOD = 1.8 × 10-20 M) indicating that the complex composition of saliva did not hamper
the association between the nanobody and its target. The OECT could also detect SARS-CoV-2
S1 mixed into human serum (Fig. S19), indicating its potential use for a wide range of other
diagnostic applications.

So far, we have characterized sensor responses through the repeated exposure of one gate electrode
to increasing target concentrations (all results are averages over several electrodes gating several
channels each). In order to better emulate real-world screening conditions, we directly exposed
individual gate electrodes to a single random concentration of SARS-CoV-2 S1 in saliva (Fig. 4e).
The NR values varied accordingly and corresponded to the values obtained in the regular dose
curves. By contrast, even high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 S1 did not evoke any response on
a gate functionalized with GFP nanobody.
MERS-CoV is the only close relative of SARS-CoV-2 in active circulation46. The MERS-CoV
nanobody-functionalized gate electrode detected single MERS-CoV S1 protein molecules in
saliva, with a nominal detection range from 100 zM to 1 nM (Fig. 4f). A weak cross-reaction of
VHH04 with SARS-CoV-2 target protein could already be anticipated from SPR measurements
(Fig. S17). By contrast, despite the high structural similarity between the two proteins, the SARSCoV sensor did not respond to MERS-CoV S1 (Fig. 4c). Remarkably, the MERS-CoV sensor
again achieved single-molecule sensitivity and 10 orders of magnitude dynamic range in complex
biological media without prior optimization to this particular target (see Table S1 for the LODs of
all the sensors used in this study). Our findings thus demonstrate the sensitivity and selectivity of
nanobody-OECTs in complex biological media and at physiologically and clinically relevant
protein concentrations. We expect that the nanobody-OECT platform can be rapidly adapted to
detect any protein antigen for which nanobodies are available.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Clinical Samples
We validated our sensors using human nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples collected in a
hospital setting. Swabs were received from clinicians in a commercial universal transport medium
(UTM) and analyzed after two days. A calibration curve with SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein confirmed
sensor operation in this UTM, albeit at lowered sensitivity (LOD for SARS-CoV-2 S1 in UTM
was 1.9 × 10-14 M) (Fig. S20). Saliva was collected from healthy volunteers and from COVID-19
in-patients (at different stages of disease) without instructions or protocols from our side. Control
measurements were performed with the same samples using GFP-nanobody gate electrodes and
viral status was verified independently by RT-PCR. In all but one case, sensor readings agreed
with RT-PCR on the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 in the sample (Fig. 5a-b, Fig. S21). In
the remaining case (saliva sample #10), our sensor gave a clear positive diagnosis where the RTPCR result was negative. The saliva sample in question had been collected from a hospitalized
COVID-19 patient, but was (like many other samples) partially dried-out by the time of
measurement. Low saliva sample quality likely impacted both sensor and RT-PCR experiments.
By contrast, four nasal swab samples that had previously been tested as positive by RT-PCR were
also confirmed to be positive by the OECT. Notably, the four positive nasal swabs had low to very
low viral loads (RT-PCR cycle threshold, CT, 33.4 to 39, close to the CT=40 detection limit). For
a direct comparison of detection limits, we prepared a 10-fold dilution series in UTM of one patient
sample. We mixed each dilution 1:1 with binding buffer and subjected it side-by-side to sensor
measurements as well as RNA extraction & RT-PCR (Fig. 5c). The sensor's above-noise response
appeared to outperform RT-PCR by one order of magnitude. The experience with real-world
samples thus suggests sensor performance on-par with RT-PCR but also points to some areas that
need to be optimized along the path from a lab-based prototype to an actual diagnostic device.

Conclusion
We here introduced a label-free electrochemical immunosensing platform with single protein
molecule sensitivity and large dynamic range. The nanobody-OECT platform detects specific
protein molecules from unprocessed samples in ambient conditions after only 10 minutes of
incubation with the disposable biofunctionalized gate electrode. The sensor can be rapidly adapted
to any target for which nanobodies exist or can be raised. After optimizing the sensor for GFP
detection, the simple exchange of nanobodies gave attomolar sensitivities for SARS-CoV-2 and
MERS spike proteins in saliva or buffers without any further modification to the sensor or protocol.
Preliminary tests with samples from COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers demonstrate a
sensor accuracy and sensitivity on par with RT-PCR. For COVID-19, the detection of intact spike

protein may, in fact, be a better indicator of infectious virus than RT-PCR, as the latter is also
detecting membrane-associated viral RNA fragments long after the infection has been cleared47.

We attribute the performance of our sensor to several synergistic design choices: The OECT
architecture outperforms other transistor technologies in terms of signal amplification and
responds to changes far from the sensor surface despite its simplicity and miniaturized geometry.
These characteristics allowed us to tether biorecognition domains through long flexible linkers. A
novel bioconjugation strategy, based on the autocatalytic assembly of a protein adapter with a
chemically synthesized peptide, allowed for the oriented coupling of chemically unmodified
recognition proteins at an exceptionally high density limited only by the size of the proteins used.
The choice of nanobodies over classic antibodies (or antibody fragments) further improved the
density and robustness of the biorecognition layer. The resulting three-dimensional and flexible
capture layer displayed a kinetically controlled target binding regime that is not limited by
dissociation constants. Moreover, a new solution-processable organic semiconductor enabled the
sensor to operate in accumulation mode which further improved sensitivity and stability by
providing large changes in output current for operation at very low biasing conditions.

Several additional features prepare this sensor architecture for POC applications. The transistor
base capable of recording from multiple micron-scale channels is reusable, allowing a stable
electronic base to be combined with disposable biofunctionalized gate electrodes. Power
consumption of the sensor is minimal and compatible with a hand-held battery-driven reader. Test
results are currently obtained in less than 15 minutes, and we expect that changes in our 10-min
incubation protocol can further accelerate the procedure. Real-time measurements are technically
feasible when the platform is integrated with microfluidics. The functionalization is simple and
modular, the device is easy-to-fabricate and obviates complex operation steps. The speed,
performance and versatility of our nanobody functionalized OECT, and its compatibility with
many sample types, suggest that this platform can complement or replace a wide range of clinical
and non-clinical diagnostic assays.

Fabrication of the organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) and the gate electrode
OECTs were microfabricated on glass substrates based on established protocols using standard
photolithography and Parylene-C peel-off techniques48,49. The process starts with the first layer of
photoresist (AZ5214) spin coated and exposed to UV light using contact aligner to create Au
electrodes and interconnection pads. The photoresist patterns were generated with AZ 726 MIF
developer, followed with metal sputtering of 10 nm of Cr and 100 nm of Au and a standard liftoff process using hot DMSO. We next coated the second layer of photoresist AZ9260 on the
substrates and developed using AZ developer. A parylene-C layer was deposited to insulate the
gold interconnects. The OECT channel was patterned by reactive ion etching (RIE) and using a

second layer of a Parylene C which was peeled-off to yield a length of 10 µm in and width of 100
µm. The aqueous dispersion of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene
sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) containing EG (5 vol%), DBSA (0.25 vol%), and GOPS (1 wt%) was
sonicated for 30 min and then spin coated (3000 rpm, 45s) on the substrates leading to a film
thickness of about 160 nm. The PEDOT:PSS OECTs were annealed at 140 °C for 1 h to activate
GOPS and avoid dissolution of the polymer film in aqueous medium. P(g0T2-g6T2) films were
spin coated (800 rpm, 45 s) from a chloroform solution (5 g/L) on the substrates to yield a film
thickness of about 70 nm in the channel. All devices were rinsed with DI water before use.
For the fabrication of the gate electrode, we used 175 µm-thick Kapton (polyimide) substrates.
The Kapton was first cut with a CO2 laser (Universal Laser Systems – PLS6.75) into a circular
geometry that defined the sensor active area (the final diameter used in sensors is 0.8 µm). We
then sonicated the substrates, first in isopropyl alcohol and then in deionized (DI) water for 30 min
each. We sputtered 10 µm of chromium or titanium and 100 µm of Au on these cleaned substrates.
Before the functionalization, the electrodes were electrochemically cleaned in 10 mM sulfuric acid
(H2SO4) using cyclic voltammetry (CV). 10 CV cycles with a potential between -0.2 V to 1.2 V
were applied at scan rate 100 mV s-1.
Biofunctionalization of gate electrodes
The chemical SAM solution was prepared in absolute ethanol containing 1 mM of HDT, as
described by others50. The Au electrodes were immersed in this solution for one hour32. Electrodes
were rinsed with absolute ethanol and dried under a N2 stream. Electrodes were then incubated for
one hour with the synthetic Maleimide-modified SpyTag peptide (0.1 mg/mL) in PBS, and washed
in PBS. Electrodes were then incubated for one hour with Nanobody-SpyCatcher fusion protein
(anti-GFP, anti-SARS-CoV-1, or anti-MERS-CoV) diluted to 50 µM in sensor binding buffer (100
mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% v/v Tween-20, 0.02% w/v NaN3, 0.1% w/v BSA) and
then rinsed with PBS. Nanobody-functionalized gate electrodes were stored for up to one week at
4 °C in the sensor binding buffer until use.

XPS analysis was performed using a KRATOS Axis SUPRA instrument equipped with a
monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1468.6 eV). We operated the source at 75 W under UHV
condition (~10-9 mbar). The spectra were recorded in a hybrid mode using electrostatic and
magnetic lenses and an aperture slot of 300 by 700 µm. The survey and high-resolution spectra
were acquired at fixed analyzer pass energies of 80 eV and 20 eV, respectively. We mounted the
samples in a floating mode to avoid differential charging. The spectra were then acquired under
charge neutralization conditions. We calibrated the spectra to reference of C 1s at 284.8 eV and
deconvoluted it using Gaussian and Lorentzian methods. The Tougaard method was used for the
background subtraction.

Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D)
QCM-D measurements were conducted using a Q-sense analyzer (QE401, Biolin Scientific). The
piezoelectrically active gold sensor (0.7854 cm2) was firstly modified with HDT SAM under the
same reaction conditions and then mounted into the QCM -D setup. First, the QCM-D signals,
including the change in frequency (∆𝑓) and dissipation (∆𝐷) were stabilized in PBS. Second, the
peptide solution (0.1 mg/mL SpyTag peptide in PBS) was injected into the chamber with a flow
rate of 100 µL/min controlled by a peristaltic pump. After ensuring that the sensor was fully
covered with the solution, we stopped the pump for an hour and rinsed the sensor surface with
PBS injected to the system for 15 min. The same procedure was employed to treat the surface with
SpyCatcher-linked nanobody solution (50 µM in the binding buffer). To quantify the mass
accumulating on the sensor (∆𝑚) during the functionalization steps, we used the Sauerbrey

Electrochemical characterization
The electrochemical characteristics of the gold electrode were investigated before and after the
formation of Chem-SAM and Bio-SAM using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and
cyclic voltammetry (CV) performed in a three-electrode setup using a potentiostat (Autolab
PGstat128N, MetroOhm). We used a platinum wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the counter
electrode and reference electrodes, respectively, while the gold electrode was connected as the
working electrode. All measurements were carried out in 5 mL of 10 mM PBS (pH 7.4) containing
10 mM of [Fe(CN)6]3-/4-. For CV measurements, the potential window was between -0.2 V and 0.5
V and the scan rate was 100 mV s-1. Electrochemical impedance spectra were recorded at a DC
voltage of 0 V versus open circuit potential (Voc) and an AC modulation of 10 mV over a frequency
range of 0.1-100000 Hz. For the analysis of GFP nanobody-functionalized electrodes, the
electrodes were incubated with GFP solutions for 10 min and washed in 10 mM PBS before the
measurements. The data was analyzed using Nova software.

Proteins and Peptides
Nanobody-SpyCatcher fusion proteins were designed based on available structures (nanobody:
PDB 4PFE52; SpyCatcher: PDB 4MLI53) with the nanobody placed at the N-terminal end of the
fusion protein in order to orient the common VHH target-binding interface towards the bulk
solution, away from the sensing surface. Protein sequences were reverse-translated and codonoptimized for expression in E. coli with an in-house Python script based on DNAChisel54. Plasmids
for protein expression were gene synthesized by Twist Bioscience (U.S.A.) or BioBasic (Canada)
in our customized expression vector pJE411c with kanamycin resistance and modified with a RBS
insulator (BCD2) cassette55 for improved translation initiation. Plasmids were transformed into E.
coli BL21 (DE3) and starter cultures were inoculated overnight from a single colony. 1L
production cultures in 2xYT medium with 50 mg/L kanamycin and 1% glucose were inoculated
1:100, grown at 37ºC and 250 rpm to OD600 0.8, induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and incubated shaking
for 18 h at 25ºC. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 6,000 g at 4 ºC, washed once
with cold PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer [25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM

of mCherry, GFPnanobody and msfGFP used different lysis methods (chemical lysis with
BugBuster (Novagen) for mCherry, sonication for the other two). Lysates were cleared by
centrifugation at 87,000 g for 45 min, the supernatant filtered through Miracloth tissue (Milipore)
and subjected to affinity chromatography on an Äkta FPLC (GE Healthcare) using either StrepTrap
HP or HisTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare), depending on the purification tag. The Strep-tag
binding buffer was 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM
TCEP and elution was performed with 2.5 mM Desthiobiotin in binding buffer. The His-tag
binding buffer was 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, 10% Glycerol, 2
mM DTT and elution was performed with a four-step imidazole gradient up to 0.5M. Fractions
were pooled and concentrated using 10K Amicon ultra (Milipore) followed by gel filtration on a
Superdex75 16/600 column (GE Healthcare) into 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10%
Glycerol, 50 µM EDTA. After spin-concentration, aliquots were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80 ºC. Protein purity, quality and accurate molar mass were monitored by SDSPAGE as well as SEC-MALS (size-exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering) on a
Dawn Heleos II & OptiLab T-rEx (Wyatt, U.S.A.). Protein concentrations were determined on a
Nanodrop spectrophotometer by absorbance at 280 nm using sequence-specific extinction
coefficients56.
SARS-CoV-1/2 and MERS target proteins, expressed and purified from HEK293 or insect cell
culture, were received lyophilized from Sino Biological (China) and dissolved to a standard
concentration of 0.25 mg/mL as per manufacturer instructions, then aliquoted, snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ºC. N-terminally Maleimide-labelled SpyTag peptide was
synthesized by GenScript Biotech (Singapore), received lyophilized, dissolved in PBS and stored
at -20 ºC.
Protein Dilutions
Target and non-target proteins were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 15.000 rpm at 4 ºC for 30 to
45 min in order to remove any potential aggregates (although no aggregation was observed). Sino
Biologicals proteins were then used as-is for the preparation of a dilution series starting at 320 or

sensor response. Weak background sensor signals were recorded from dilutions of DTT. In-house
proteins were therefore stored or exchanged into DTT-free buffer before use. The higher24

concentrated proteins from in-house production were first diluted to intermediate concentrations
that could still be validated and corrected spectrophotometrically. Protein dilutions were prepared
in standard sensor binding buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% v/v Tween-20,
0.02% w/v NaN3, 0.1% w/v BSA) which was modified for saliva measurements to include
cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail with EDTA (Sigma) at 4 times the manufacturerrecommended concentration (giving a two-fold concentration in the final 1:1 mixture with saliva).
BSA was not included in this saliva buffer. For measurements in the regular binding buffer, 4-fold
dilution series were prepared in 96-well microplates over 23 steps starting from 320 nM. For
measurements in serum, saliva and UTM, target protein dilution series were prepared in the
appropriate buffer (standard or saliva binding buffer) starting from 640 nM so that final
concentrations were identical after 1:1 mixture with serum, saliva or UTM.
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) Measurements
Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed on a Biacore T200 instrument using
Nickel-NTA sensor chips (GE Healthcare) and a modified running buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 0.02% w/v NaN3, 50 µM EDTA, prepared at room temperature
and filtered) mirroring the sensor binding buffer. All analyte proteins were desalted into the
running buffer (HiPrep 26/10 column, GE Healthcare) before the preparation of dilution series in
the same running buffer. The GFP nanobody : GFP interaction was measured with the His10-tagged
nanobody immobilized (ligand) and msfGFP in solution. For the remaining measurements, since
all viral target proteins arrived with a non-cleavable His-tag, target proteins were immobilized
instead of the nanobody. All ligand proteins gave stable immobilization responses with minimal
signal loss over time. His tags were removed from nanobody-spyCatcher proteins by overnight
cleavage with excess 3C protease (produced in-house), followed by gel filtration on a Superdex200
Increase 10/300GL column. All ligand proteins were immobilized to equal loading levels of
around 100 RU at 10 µl/min flow rates. Binding and unbinding experiments were run at a flow
rate of 80 µl/min. Two replicates were prepared of each dilution series and measured in the course
of the same experiment. Between each measurement cycle, the sensor surface was regenerated
with 0.35 M EDTA in running buffer and re-charged with 0.5 mM NiSO4 in water. Biacore results
were analyzed with the manufacturer analysis software version 2.1 following standard procedures
(double-subtraction of reference channel and buffer injection signal) applying a 1:1 binding model

and simultaneous curve-fitting. SARS-CoV-2 RBD results were instead fit a heterologous ligand
binding model.
Fluorescence imaging
The GFP nanobody functionalized gold electrodes before and after its incubation with a GFP
solution together with the negative controls (the biofunctional electrode before and after incubation
with mCherry) were imaged using fluorescence microscopy. Electrodes were placed between two
cover slips in the presence of PBS in order to keep the flexible material in plane and in focus.
Pictures were recorded on a fluorescent inverted microscope DMI8 (Leica Microsystem) coupled
with pE-4000 fluorescence illumination system (CoolLED).
OECT characterization and sensor operation
We used a Keithley source meter to apply drain (VD) and gate voltages (VG) and obtain gate and
channel currents (IG and ID) in ambient conditions. A PDMS well was glued on top of the channels
and filled with 75 µL of 10 mM PBS. The steady-state transistor characteristics were obtained by
measuring ID vs. VD at various VG, for PEDOT:PSS applied between -0.6 V to 0.6 V with 0.1 V
step (2.5 V/s) and for p(g0T2-g6T2) from 0.2 V to -0.6 V with 0.05 V step (1.25 V/s). VD was
swept from 0 V to -0.6 V. We first chose a channel and obtained its transfer curve (ID vs. VG) in
PBS using the nanobody-functionalized gate electrode incubated for 10 min in the buffer solution
(buffer, saliva, UTM or serum, in the absence of target proteins). The currents obtained were used
as the baseline signal (𝐼0 ). The same gate electrode was then incubated with 5 µL of the solution
(buffer, saliva, UTM or serum) that contains the protein target for 10 min (pipetting 30 s every 3
min). The electrode was washed thoroughly with PBS to remove any unbound proteins. To obtain
calibration curves, we prepared various concentrations of the target protein and collected device
data starting from the most diluted one. The normalized response (NR) of the sensor was calculated
according to the following equation:
|𝐼𝐷 − 𝐼0 |
(2)
𝐼0
where 𝐼𝐷 is the current response of the sensor to an analyte solution that the gate was exposed to.
𝑁𝑅 =

According to IUPAC, the LOD was calculated as the concentration leading to a response that
equals to the average of the noise level plus three times the noise standard deviation57,58. The level△𝐼

of-noise ( 𝐼 ± 3𝛿) was taken from the relative current variation in negative control sensors.

Clinical Sample Preparation and Testing
The samples (saliva samples and nasopharyngeal swabs) used in this study (Fig. 5) were collected
from human subjects as part of registered protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board
of King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center and KAUST Institutional Biosafety and
Bioethics Committee (IBEC). All volunteers provided signed consent to participate in the study.
Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects were stored in
UTM, and saliva was collected inside empty urine beakers or 50 mL tubes. Samples were stored
at 4 ºC and tested within one to two days after collection using the same protocol described above.
The saliva used for original sensor characterization with recombinant proteins was self-collected
in the morning before food or tooth brushing, filtered and stored in aliquots at -20 ºC. All
volunteers provided signed consent to participate in the study and provide saliva. Human serum
from human male AB plasma was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as-received. All
protocols and procedures involving human saliva, nasopharyngeal swabs and serum were
approved by the KAUST IBEC under approval number 18IBEC11 and 20IBEC25, NCBE, KSA
registration number HAP-02-J-042.
