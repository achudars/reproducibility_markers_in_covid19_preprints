Abstract

To broadly explore the extent that COVID-19 has initially impacted medical learners around the
world and examine global trends and patterns across geographic regions and levels of training, a
cross-sectional survey of medical learners was conducted between March 25-June 14th, 2020,
shortly after the World Health Organization declared concurrent COVID-19 a pandemic.
6492 medical learners completed the survey from 140 countries, Students were concerned about
the quality of their learning, training progression, and milestone fulfillment. Most trainees felt
under-utilized and wanted to be engaged clinically in meaningful ways; however, some trainees
felt that contributing to healthcare during a pandemic was beyond the scope of a medical
learner. Statistically significant differences were detected between levels of training and
geographic regions for satisfaction with organizational responses, the impact of COVID-19 on
wellness, and state-trait anxiety. Overall, the initial disruption to medical training has been
perceived by learners across all levels and geographic regions to have negatively affected
their training and well-being, particularly amongst postgraduate trainees. These results provide
initial insights into the areas that warrant future research as well as consideration for current and
future policy planning, such as the policies for clinical utilization of medical learners during
public health emergencies.

Running Head: The global impact of COVID-19 on learners

Introduction
The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) represents the first global interruption to medical
education since World War II. This public health emergency has required undergraduate and
postgraduate medical training programs around the world to rapidly respond, including redeploying learners to other clinical spaces or removing them entirely, and moving education
online to promote physical distancing (Association of American Medical Colleges 2020; Harvey
2020; Rose 2020). The current COVID-19 pandemic has changed the status quo of medical
training as we know it – whether for better or for worse remains unclear and may have profound
implications.

Prior localized disruptions to medical training have negatively affected trainees, such as
pandemics and climate emergencies. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in
2003 revealed the tension between embracing learning opportunities that a public health
emergency offers and protecting the needs and well-being of learners (Rieder et al. 2004;
Sherbino & Atzema 2004; Rambaldini et al. 2005). The SARS pandemic adversely affected the
mental health of learners and healthcare professionals, and heightened anxiety amongst learners
was associated with a perceived negative educational experience (Maunder et al. 2003; Bai et al.
2004; Landis & Bradley 2005; Rambaldini et al. 2005). In 2005, the rapid restructuring of the
medical school curriculum in response to Hurricane Katrina resulted in a decline in academic
performance (Crawford et al. 2008). Lessons from both SARS and Hurricane Katrina highlighted
the importance of support networks and attention to learner wellness, recognizing the additional
stressors that these disruptions can place on medical trainees (Landis & Bradley 2005;
Rambaldini et al. 2005; DiCarlo et al. 2007; Crawford et al. 2008). These emergencies led to
significant and rapid innovation in curriculum structure and content (DiCarlo et al. 2007). While
disruptions to medical education can provide an impetus to reconsider ethical and practical
implications of training during emergencies, training models may remain stagnant (Landis &
Bradley 2005; DiCarlo et al. 2007). Despite a heightened awareness fifteen years ago of the
potential implications of interruptions to medical education, many organizations and systems
entered the current pandemic relatively unprepared.

Running Head: The global impact of COVID-19 on learners

Medical education’s understanding of the impact of global emergencies and disruptions to
medical training remains limited to SARS and localized emergencies, yet the current pandemic
remains the single most substantial disruption to contemporary medical training with global
impact. The extent to which COVID-19 has impacted medical training remains speculative and
anecdotal, and the consequences and implications may be profound. The research question for
this exploratory study was: How have medical learners been impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic around the world?

Methods
Data Collection
We administered a cross-sectional survey between March 25 and June 14, 2020, shortly after the
World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Criterion and snowball sampling
techniques were used to collect data from undergraduate (e.g., medical students) and
postgraduate (e.g., interns, house staff, resident physicians) medical learners at any medical
school around the world. This study explicitly focused on medical learners given that they
provide a significant proportion of patient care yet are still considered learners.

Our decision to use a survey was based on the ability of this method to efficiently collect
empirical data from a large population (Kelley et al. 2003) The survey instrument was designed
to include both quantitative and qualitative questions in order to later compare variables across
groups, allow participants to provide insight into how they have been impacted using their own
words, and use the qualitative data to potentially expand upon the results of the quantitative data
(Appendix A). All participants completed demographic questions followed by questions specific
to their level of training. Next, shared questions explored the effect of the pandemic on learner
wellbeing and their communications with others. Open-ended questions collected qualitative data
surrounding the impacts of the pandemic on training, utilization of residents, and strategies used
in response to the pandemic. All questions were developed de novo, except the 6-item State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) (Marteau & Bekker 1992). One question exploring the impact of the

pandemic on five domains of wellness was informed by a holistic framework for learner wellness
(Kassam & Ellaway 2020).

An initial survey underwent pilot testing to refine comprehension and functionality. The final
survey was translated to 19 additional languages to increase the inclusion of learners from
around the world. The survey was administered online using Qualtrics software by distributing
an anonymous, re-usable link over social media and through snowball sampling.

Data Analysis
Quantitative data were imported into SPSS Version 26 (IBM Corp., New York) for analysis.
Countries were coded to the geographic regions defined by the World Bank to explore
geographic differences (World Bank) Descriptive statistics were calculated for each item. Total
scores were computed for scaled questions, with positively worded items reverse coded in the
calculation. Independent t-tests were used to compare total scores between medical students and
residents, and an Analysis of Variance test was used to compare data across geographic regions
using a post-hoc correction to account for multiple comparisons. To examine the psychometric
properties of the survey, Cronbach’s alpha was computed for scaled items to assess reliability
evidence and an exploratory factor analysis was used to examine construct validity.

Qualitative data were back translated to English and analyzed in NVivo Version 12 (QSR
International, Melbourne). Three investigators read through the data to identify emerging themes,
which were then organized into a coding framework for deductive thematic and content analysis
to similarly examine trends between levels and across geographic regions (Miles et al. 2014).
Two investigators (KB, MM) independently coded 100 responses to refine the initial coding
framework and assess inter-rater agreement. After an additional 400 responses were analyzed
and the Kappa statistic continued to suggest acceptable inter-rater agreement, and a decision was
made to divide to improve efficiency given the volume of data. Upon completion of the coding
for all responses, themes in the coding framework were divided amongst the research team. Each
member analyzed the data coded to their assigned themes and summarized the trends and
patterns in the data. Theme summaries were compiled for interpretation by the study team, who
then compared and contrasted the results of the qualitative data with the quantitative data to

examine how these findings converge or diverge from, and ultimately expand upon, the
quantitative results.

The University of Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board reviewed and approved this
study (File #20-0484). Participation in this study was voluntary. Implied consent was obtained
from all participants. Participants had the option to either skip individual questions or select
“prefer not to answer.”

Results
A total of 6492 learners from 140 countries completed the survey. The majority of participants
were medical students (81.0%) and from Europe and Central Asia (43.4%) (Table 1). The results
for both medical student-specific and resident-specific questions are summarized in Table 2.
Figure 1 visualizes the responses to the scaled questions for both levels (see Appendix B for
additional visualizations of the data by level of training and geographic region).

[Table 1, Table 2, Figure 1]

Undergraduate Medical Learners
The majority (84.3%) of clinical-level medical students were excused from clinical duties;
however, some worked clinically in some capacity (9.0%). Most spent their time in online
learning coordinated by their medical school (68.2%), pursuing self-directed learning (44.1%),
resting (36.4%), and engaging in more wellness activities than normal (31.4%). Most (80.9%)
had online learning coordinated by their school but 66.5% felt their education would be of lower
quality as a result. Some had difficulties learning from home (21.0%) and accessing the internet
(11.0%).

Students reported that their core electives (23.5%) and visiting electives (19.5%) were cancelled
or postponed. The qualitative data highlighted how reduced clinical exposure limited
opportunities to explore specialties, decreased career interests, and created anxiety about

implications for future milestones (e.g., examinations, residency match). While the majority of
medical students did not report the pandemic influenced their career interests, 11.4% of medical
students reported increased interests in both Public Health and Infectious Disease as a result of
the pandemic, as well as other clinical specialties (e.g., Emergency Medicine, Critical Care,
Internal Medicine) and new interests in incorporating epidemiology into their future careers.
Decreased interest in clinical careers and concerns about the impact of the pandemic on job
prospects in their country were noted qualitatively.

Over half of medical students reported feeling under-utilized (53.8%); 52.4% wanted to assist
clinically (52.4%) and felt comfortable doing so (54.8%). While 57.9% worried about the risk of
exposure to the virus during rotations, 73.0% worried about the risk of exposure in the
community. Over two thirds (70.6%) reported feeling worried about the disruption to their
progression through medical training, with 45.0% worrying about their chances to match to
residency. Only 21.0% thought the pandemic would have a minimal impact on their learning or
skill development, and only 31.0% felt that it would have a minimal impact on their ability to
enter residency with sufficient knowledge and skill to provide safe, high-quality care. The
majority of students (58.0%) felt that the pandemic negatively affected their wellbeing.

Postgraduate Resident Learners
Residents were from a variety of specialties, mostly in urban settings. Three-quarters of residents
agreed their learning was negatively impacted by COVID-19 and 60% felt it disrupted their
career progression and timeline. Only 16% reported working more than normal during the
pandemic and 36.7% working less than normal. Some residents felt adequately utilized (35.9%)
or over-utilized (20.9%); however, 46.8% reported they could be better utilized. Over one-third
felt comfortable providing patient care at this time, and 60.8% felt prepared to use personal
protective equipment (PPE). Half of residents reported adequate knowledge of COVID-19 to
provide care, 36.5% were prepared to be redeployed to other clinical services, and only 53%
were worried about working in the hospital. 66.5% agreed that COVID-19 had negatively
impacted their wellbeing. The qualitative data provided further evidence that residents felt underutilized - but highlighted how they saw their re-deployment in a clinical setting as being in
conflict with their educational goals.

Shared Questions
All scaled items had acceptable internal consistency (α>.7) and factor loadings, suggesting
reliability and validity evidence. Statistically significant differences were detected between
levels of training (p<.05) and geographic regions (p<.007) for the items examining satisfaction
with organizational responses [t=7.517, p<.000; [F(6,5258) = 73.85, p<.007]], the impact of
COVID-19 on wellness [t =-7.774, p<.000 [F(6,5165)= 11.81, p<.007]], and state-trait anxiety
[t=-4.710, p<.000;[F(6, 5131)=10.48, p<.007]] (Appendix C). In general, residents reported
lower satisfaction with organizational responses (x=15.67, 95% CI = 15.36-159.98) as well as

a greater negative impact on their wellbeing (x=18.52, 95% CI 18.24-18.80,) and anxiety

(x=15.13, 95% CI 14.83-15.42). Learners from the East Asia and Pacific region were most
satisfied with organizational responses, whereas learners from Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin
America and Caribbean were least satisfied (Figure 2.1). Medical students from the Latin
America and Caribbean region as well as residents from North America reported the largest
negative impact of COVID-19 on their wellness (Figure 2.2). Residents from South Asia, Latin
America and Caribbean reported the highest state-trait anxiety (Figure 2.3).

[Figure 2]

Seventy-four percent of residents and 57% of medical students reported being more anxious than
usual (Table 3; Figure B.4). Common concerns were the health and wellbeing of family
members, the impact of the pandemic on their learning, the health of the public, their personal
health, the financial situation of others, and their personal financial situation (Figure B.3). Onequarter of participants identifying as Asian reported an increase in racist comments or behaviors
in the clinical setting during COVID-19. Over half (54.7%) of learners living with a disability
felt their school’s response to the pandemic would further disadvantage them due to their
disability.
[Table 3]

Some learners reported having to be in quarantine or isolation at the time of the survey. Nearly
all learners were practicing physical and social distancing.

Running Head: The global impact of COVID-19 on learners

The qualitative data highlighted how normal education and training processes were severely
disrupted by the pandemic (Appendix D). Learners identified a need for institutions to adapt and
innovate in order to mitigate these impacts and continue education. Learners also desired to have
input into their institutions’ pandemic response. Strategies such as town halls, surveys, and
learner representation on decision-making committees helped ensure their circumstances were
accurately understood and enabled them to raise concerns overlooked by decision-makers.

Clear and effective communication during the pandemic was essential for learners, while poor or
absent communication left learners uncertain of what was happening and contributed to their
anxiety. Effective communication provided clarity and reassurance about the pandemic’s impacts
and the institutional response. Learners wished to be informed about impacts on their programs,
details of the pandemic response, their role (including how to help), and resources they could
access. Effective communications about these topics were clear, specific, decisive, concise, and
reassuring. Irregular (sporadic) communication created an “information vacuum” that was filled
by speculation, rumors, and misinformation. Overly frequent communication was overwhelming
and led students to ignore institutional communications.

Numerous interventions were implemented in response to COVID-19, including virtual teaching
strategies (e.g., Zoom, Microsoft Teams), office hours and town halls, and clinical strategies
(e.g., patient handover via teleconference, alternating call schedules to minimize exposure).
When done effectively, online learning maintained educational momentum and provided learners
with motivation, a routine, and a sense of purpose. Self-directed learning was frequently used to
augment online learning, and when provided with support and guidance, this motivated learners
and provided them with a sense of progress. Programs with too much content overwhelmed
them, whereas programs that provided minimal guidance left learners feeling aimless. Some
participants stated that their program or school had done nothing in response to the pandemic,
and that either their education had continued as usual or, in some instances, students were told to
stay at home and self-direct their learning without any guidance from their program.

Discussion
This study provides empirical data about the impact of COVID-19 on medical education around
the world, notably the effects on learning and wellbeing. Taken together, our findings highlight
how learners have been impacted regardless of their program’s response to the pandemic and
whether or not they were removed from the clinical environment. However, the extent that
COVID-19 has impacted learners differs significantly between levels of training and geographic
regions.

COVID-19 has disrupted the traditional format and process of medical training for the vast
majority of medical students and residents around the world. The rapid adoption of online
learning by most schools may raise concerns about the quality of education (Mian & Khan
2020). Despite these concerns, equivalent educational outcomes between online and offline
methods have been reported in the literature.(Pei & Wu 2019) The removal of learners from the
clinical setting may diminish training (particularly for residents in time-based models of
training), influencing clinical competence acquisition and career-decision making – all of which
may affect patient care and health system outcomes (Goldhamer et al. 2020). While COVID-19
has required programs to adapt their curricula, this may be an opportunity to reconceptualize,
innovate, and improve the current models of medical training, and ultimately catalyze broader
educational transformation (Goldhamer et al. 2020; Sklar 2020).

Consistent with early reports, medical students feel under-utilized and have a strong desire to
help out clinically during times of need (Lauren et al.; Herman et al. 2007; Gallagher & Schleyer
2020; Kalet et al. 2020; Li & Bailey 2020). However, not all learners may share these views. In
addition to concerns about physical safety, some participants in our study believed the role of
trainees is to be educated and that any deviation from that role is inappropriate. Others felt
personally invested in contributing to care and viewed it as their personal calling and
professional obligation. The optimal role of trainees during pandemics is complicated given their
dual role as learners and healthcare providers – the extent to which each role is prioritized during
emergencies remains debated. On one hand, it has been argued that medical students specifically,
as an unpaid workforce, are not essential workers, and may increase disease transmission and

waste scarce supplies of PPE (Menon et al. 2020). In contrast, it can also be argued that medical
students are a semi-skilled workforce that can alleviate the burden on residents and staff, and
should gain experience in preparation for future pandemics when they will no longer be trainees.
In one study, hospital leaders viewed medical students who graduated early to help during
COVID-19 as “game changers” (Flotte et al. 2020). It has also been argued that medical
education is equally important to patient care during a pandemic (Klasen et al. 2020). This may
be a unique opportunity to cultivate leadership skills if learners are well-supported (Brand 2020).
For learners in the clinical environment, supervision, feedback, and evaluation as well as access
to adequate wellness supports remain crucial (Brand 2020; Klasen et al. 2020). The ethical and
practical considerations of utilizing medical learners during a pandemic remains an ongoing
point of discussion and needs to be weighed against potential benefits of learning and
implications to patient care (Simonds & Sokol 2008; Bauchner & Sharfstein 2020).

COVID-19 is expected to affect the mental health of the public(Venkatesh & Edirappuli 2020) as
well as that of healthcare professionals (Lai et al. 2020). Previous health emergencies and
disruptions to training, such as SARS and Hurricane Katrina, have been shown to diminish the
mental health of trainees and healthcare professionals (Kisely et al. 2020). Our study provides
similar evidence but from a global perspective that the wellbeing of medical learners has been
negatively impacted by COVID-19 across all levels of training and geographic regions. This is
concerning given the existing evidence on the alarming prevalence of burnout and psychiatric
morbidities in learners, as COVID-19 may amplify these pre-existing issues (Puthran et al. 2016;
Frajerman et al. 2019; Quek et al. 2019; Hartzband & Groopman 2020). Pandemic responses
have superimposed new stressors while exacerbating existing stressors for learners. The
“anticipatory loss” associated with the disruption of traditional processes and milestones (e.g.,
electives, residency match, licensing exams) appears associated with anxiety, and front-line
learners (e.g., residents) may be particularly prone to wellness stressors (Gallagher & Schleyer
2020; Li & Bailey 2020). Suggestions for mitigating the psychological consequences of COVID19 on front-line care providers include clear communication, education, and psychological
support, among others (Kisely et al. 2020).

Running Head: The global impact of COVID-19 on learners
This pandemic remains an ongoing challenge for medical education. While the uncertainty of
COVID-19 required organizations to adopt a “worst-case scenario” approach, medical schools
not only continue to react to the needs of the health system, but proactively plan for the future.
While some participants in this study applauded their program’s response, it is important to learn
from this experience and improve planning and policies for current and future emergencies that
may disrupt medical education (O’Byrne 2020). Recommendations are increasingly being
discussed in the literature (The Coalition for Physician’s Accountability Work Group on Medical
Students in the Class of 2021; Kachra & Brown 2020; Klasen et al. 2020; O’Byrne 2020; The
Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada 2020). Considerations for medical educators
synthesized from our results and existing recommendations are summarized in Table 4. We must
continue to share innovations and key lessons amongst the global medical education community.
Future research is warranted to understand the long-term impact and potential consequences of
the COVID-19 on education, patient care, and health system outcomes.

[Table 4]

Limitations
We acknowledge that this study has several limitations, including the response and selection
bias. The response rates from residents are low, potentially because they continued working
clinically and the disruptions to their training were less extreme than for medical students who
were completely removed from their training environments. Further, this study excluded
participants who did not speak any of the 20 languages of the survey and there may be
inconsistencies across the survey translations despite our best attempts to ensure questions and
constructs translated accurately. Due to the public circulation of the survey, participants could
not be validated as medical learners. A small fraction (3.5%) of participants did not specify their
level of training and were excluded from the comparisons across levels of training. The
geographic comparisons remain limited, as other classification systems (e.g., the World Health
Organization regions) may have generated different results and there may be more pronounced
differences between countries within similar regions (e.g., the United States vs. Canada). Finally,
the variable responses to COVID-19 across countries and time is worth noting. Numerous
qualitative comments highlighted how national responses informed the responses of professional

organizations and training programs. Future research could examine potential associations
between temporality and the political and health system responses to examine how these factors
may extend to influence medical learners (Pablos-Méndez et al. 2020).

Conclusions
This global study provides empirical data surrounding the profound impact that COVID-19 has
had on medical learners, which can inform responses to the current pandemic, future disruptions
to training, and future research. The results highlight the differences and similarities between
levels of training and geographic regions. Despite the global shift toward online education, all
education may not be created or perceived equally, as the results of this study suggest medical
students fear their education will be of lower quality at this time. Both medical students and
residents report their under-utilization, yet the role of the medical learner during a pandemic
remains controversial. A delicate balance remains between medical training and the acute needs
of the health system to ensure that both education and patient care remain safe. Finally, this study
highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the wellbeing of medical
learners globally, particularly those at the postgraduate level of training, which may be
associated with their anxiety relating to the anticipatory losses of their educational experience.
While the goal of this study was to broadly examine the impacts of COVID-19 on medical
education, it highlights several areas for further exploration. Future research is warranted to
better understand the implications of COVID-19 on learner outcomes and to generate evidencebased strategies surrounding how best to teach, engage, and support medical learners during
similar events.

Medical schools should ideally learn from this experience and improve planning and
policies for current and future disruptions or emergencies

Considerations for Medical Schools and Residency Programs

Teaching and
Learning

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Recognize that the rapid shift to online learning modalities likely requires ongoing evaluation, refinements, and improvement.
Acknowledge that learners may have difficulties learning from home as well as challenges accessing a computer or the internet.
Provide learners with self-directed learning resources with structure and guidance to promote student motivation and accountability.
Simultaneously collect real-time feedback and use rapid-cycle improvement to promote continuous improvements while adapting new formats or processes.
Identify potential innovations to maintain the fidelity and benefits of in-person learning, particularly for clinical skills.
Consider integrating educational innovations created in response to COVID-19 into the core curriculum to be sustained after the pandemic.
Scale what is working to other areas of your curriculum. Share success stories with others who may be struggling with similar challenges and could benefit from these strategies, particularly those in similar institutions (e.g., between residency programs).
Conduct program evaluations of the new formats and processes adopted in response to COVID-19 to compare outcomes and provide evidence of merit and worth to learners and stakeholders.

•
•

Recognize that learners may be highly motivated to help out clinically during times of need and consider potential opportunities to engage them in meaningful roles – especially medical students when removed from their clinical rotations.
Consider the training level, skillset, and experiences of learners. When appropriate, junior learners (e.g., medical students or junior residents) may be helpful to provide care in less acute settings or assist with low-risk roles to free senior residents and faculty to
provide acute and intensive care.
Provide learners working clinically with proper training on how to use personal protective equipment and provide care to COVID-19 patients.
As learners have diverse needs, an individualized approach should be considered when engaging learners in the workforce – don’t assume all learners want to help out clinically. Learners may also be willing to help out in non-clinical ways, such as volunteering
in the community.
Continue providing learners with adequate supervision, feedback, and evaluation in the clinical setting as much as possible.
Ensure safety equipment is available to learners in the clinical environments as well as health insurance if it is not already provided.

•

Recognize the potential burden of COVID-19 on learner well-being and proactively provide systemic and programmatic support, appropriate access to counselling, peer support systems, and social networking.
Acknowledge that the diverse and unique needs of learners may differ for some groups at this time, including students who may have a disability, parents, caregivers, and international learners
Approach medical learner well-being holistically to ensure that mental, physical, intellectual, social, and occupational wellness is achieved.
Cultivate a culture of wellness both systemically and programmatically (upstream) so that learners are able to thrive (downstream) during their training as well as disruptive events such as COVID-19.
Recognize that “anticipatory loss” of milestones may be associated with learner anxiety and try to mitigate concerns relating to these areas, including: cancellation of electives, reduced clinical exposures, concerns about career decision making, anxiety about
what specialties to apply to for residency with limited clinical exposure and the cancellation of electives, disruption of traditional timelines and processes, cancellation of licensing examinations, impact on career progression and obtaining employment, etc.

•
•

Communicate with learners clearly, early, and often – but not too often.
Use centralized and streamlined modalities to reduce information overload, such as an e-mail update or frequently updated website, rather than social media. Consider surveying learners to ask about communication preferences and tailor the communication in
response to their needs.
Provide clear and concise updates to learners relating to the impacts of COVID-19 on their education, including changes to their program, timelines, and milestones.
Be transparent about decision-making processes, outcomes, and contingency plans.
Provide reassurance as much as possible and clearly communicate supports and resources to learners, such as institutional wellness resources, career counselling, academic advisors, peer supports, etc.

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Engage learners in the decision-making process as much as possible, and as early as possible.
Include learners on planning committees and in the development of policies.
Create avenues for learners to be engaged in decision-making and to provide feedback to administrators and decision-makers, such as town halls, open office hours, or surveys.
Acknowledge the diverse experiences and needs of learners and allow for flexibility in solutions. For instance, recognize that some – but not all – junior learners may wish to help and that the health system may benefit from utilizing this skilled workforce.
Provide multiple options to learners when possible to promote autonomy and flexibility.
Develop a robust policies and procedures from this experience. Plan for how the program or institution will respond to disruptions to medical training, including any subsequent waves of COVID-19, future pandemics, climate change emergencies, etc.
