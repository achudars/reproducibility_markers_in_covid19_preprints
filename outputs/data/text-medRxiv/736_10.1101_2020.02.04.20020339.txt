Abstract

17

The outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan

18

City of China obtained global concern, the population outflow from Wuhan has

19

contributed to spatial expansion in other parts of China. We examined the effects of

20

population outflow from Wuhan on the 2019-nCoV transmission in other provinces

21

and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan. We observed

22

a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of

23

cases. Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two

24

days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could be prevented, and if two days

25

later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible. Our findings suggest

26

that population movement might be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection

27

transmission in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to prevent the

28

epidemic.

Introduction

33

In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases caused by a novel coronavirus,

34

namely 2019-nCoV, emerged in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province in China

35

(1), Similar with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the Wuhan pneumonia

36

outbreak was highly suspected to be linked to the wild animals in the seafood market,

37

although the definitive source of this virus was not clear yet (2).

38

As of Jan 31, 2020, the infection has been transmitted to all the provinces in China

39

and a few other countries. Epidemiology evidence shown that most of the cases had a

40

history of living or travelling to Wuhan, the household cluster cases and cases of

41

health-care workers indicated the human-to-human transmission route (3), which

42

might be the reason for a rapid increasing rate of infection across the country and

43

globally (4).

44

Considering the person-to-person transmission and the large travel volume during

45

the traditional Chinese New Year (the largest annual population movement in the

46

world), it is expected that the population movement would lead to further expansion

47

of the infection, so the government imposed a lockdown on Wuhan City at 10:00 am

48

on January 23, as well as some other cities later on. However, an estimated 5 million

49

individuals had already left Wuhan for the holiday or travelling, some of which rushed

50

out after the lockdown announcement (5). In addition, the novel coronavirus is

51

infectious during the incubation period and when the symptoms are not obvious,

52

which is likely to make the huge floating population potential sources of infection (6).

53

Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the population transported from Wuhan

54

may have a significant impact on the potential outbreaks in other parts of China.

55

Recent studies on the novel coronavirus pneumonia focused more on its etiology (7,

56

8), transmission route (9, 10), and epidemiological characteristics (11, 12), there is

57

still a lack of investigating the relationship between the migrating population and the

58

outbreak, which is of great importance for making intervention policies. Thus, we

59

conducted this study with the following objectives: 1) to depict the impacts of the

60

population movement on the spatial transmission of the 2019-nCoV cases at the

61

provincial and city levels in China; 2) to estimate the potential outbreak risk at areas

62

with the population outflowed from Wuhan; 3) to evaluate the effectiveness of the city

63

closure measures on the epidemic control.

Methods

66

Data collection

67

The data on the daily number of cases were derived from the real-time update of the

68

China Health Commission (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), 2019-nCoV epidemic report on

69

Phoenix and Dingxiangyuan website. The case definition has been introduced

70

previously (13, 14). In brief, a confirmed case was defined as a pneumonia that was

71

laboratory confirmed 2019-nCoV infection with related respiratory symptoms and a

72

travel history to Wuhan or direct contact with patients from Wuhan. We collected each

73

reported 2019-nCoV case in mainland China till 12:00 pm January 31, 2020.

74
75

The floating population

76

As the city closure took place at 10:00 AM Jan 23rd, 2020, and the incubation period

77

of the infection was estimated to be about 3-7 days (15), we obtained the daily index

78

of population outflow from Wuhan and the proportion of the daily index from Wuhan

79

to other provinces and top 50 cities, from January 1 to 31 in 2020, the information

80

was retrieved through the Spring Festival travel information of China released by

81

Baidu Qianxi. The data is consisted of Baidu Location Based Services (LBS) and

Statistical analysis

87

Number of 2019-nCoV cases per unit outflow population

88

The daily index of population outflow from Wuhan to other provinces and top 50

89

cities was obtained by multiplying the daily index of population outflow within

90

Wuhan by the corresponding proportion for each province. To evaluate the effect of

91

prevention and control measures of the local government, we calculated the number

92

of 2019-nCoV cases per unit outflow population, the formula can be specified as:

93

The total index of outflow population from Wuhan from Jan 1 to 31:

94

A = { ai } (i = 1, 2 …,31)

95

The daily proportion of the daily index from Wuhan to other provinces from Jan 1 to

96

104

Evaluation of the effects of earlier city closure dates

105

After the city closure was taken in force, some population still outflowed from Wuhan.

106

We subtracted the outflow index on Jan 23 from the average outflow index from Jan

107

24 to 31, to obtain the index of outflow population within Wuhan reduced by the

108

advance city closure on Jan 23 and 22 (the advance outflow index). And then we

109

calculated the average proportion of the outflow index from Jan 24 to 31 for each

110

province (the average proportion). The number of cases reduced by the advance city

111

closure in each province was estimated by multiplied the advance outflow index by

112

the average proportion and one corresponding unit. The formula can be specified as:

Similarly, we evaluated the impacts of one-day and two-day delayed city closure. We

130

took the average index of the population outflow between Jan 21 and 23 as the daily

131

index of population outflow before the city closure, and used the same calculation

132

method to estimate the index of population outflow within Wuhan increased by the

133

delayed city closure on Jan 24 and Jan 25 (the delayed outflow index). We multiplied

134

the delayed outflow index by the average proportion and one corresponding unit to

135

estimate the increased number of cases caused by one-day and two-day delayed city

136

closure in each province.

Results

139

As of January 31, 2020, a total of 11791 confirmed cases and 259 deaths due to the

140

2019-nCoV infection were reported in China, which were widely dispersed in all of

141

31 provincial administrative areas. The overall trend of 2019-nCoV cases is upward.

142

During the period of January 11, 2020 through January 31, the cumulative number of

143

cities infected with 2019-nCoV cases increased rapidly (appendix). A total of 313

144

cities in mainland China reported the occurrence of 2019-nCoV infection, of which

145

the number of reported cases from January 20 to 29 increased rapidly from 7 to 313,

146

an increase of nearly 44 times. Among the cities, 97 of them belong to the regions

147

with high population exodus out of Wuhan, and 7138 cases have been reported,

148

accounting for 83·23% of the total reported cases outside Wuhan (appendix).

149

Population outflow of Wuhan could be divided into four periods based on the

150

migration data of Baidu (figure 1 and 2). In the first stage from Jan 1 to Jan10,

151

migrant population flowed out of Wuhan normally and returned to hometown without

152

the influence of the epidemic situation. At this point, the mean daily index of

153

population outflow was 58039·71 (95% CI: 48883·38-66454·00), and 2019-nCoV

154

cases were mainly distributed in Wuhan. From beginning of Spring Festival travel

155

rush on Jan 10 and announcement of 2019-nCoV infection, the mean index of

156

population outflow rose to 66777·98 (95% CI: 61125·90-72962·78), which increased

157

by 15·1% compared with the previous period. Meanwhile, 2019-nCoV cases

158

gradually appeared in Wuhan and several nearby cities. The third period was from

159

January 20 to 23 when Academician Nanshan Zhong disclosed the human-to-human

160

transmission and a large number of Wuhan residents fled from Wuhan with increasing

161

panic. The corresponding mean index of population outflow of this period surged to

162

112385·88 (95% CI: 107367·44-118403·21), which increased by 93·6% comparing to

163

the earlier period. Thereafter, a strict city closure policy was implemented to prohibit

164

the population relocation from Wuhan. In the wake of sharp decline of outflow

165

population from Wuhan, the index reduced to 9180·29 (95% CI: 3055·35-19101·40),

166

falling by 91·8% comparing with the third period and the effective controlling of the

167

outflow population prevented suspected cases from spreading to the whole country,

168

however, 2019-nCoV cases has been widely dispersed in all of 31 provinces.

169

We applied scatter diagram to demonstrate the association between the number

170

of 2019-nCoV cases and index of outflow population at the scales of province and city.

171

In general, at the scale of province (figure 3), outflow population from Wuhan was

172

mainly distributed in Henan, Hunan, Guangdong, Anhui, Zhejiang, etc. And the top

173

four provinces with the most serious epidemic were Zhejiang, Guangdong, Henan,

174

and Hunan provinces. Therefore, we could observe that there were more 2019-nCoV

175

cases in the provinces with higher index of outflow population. Nevertheless, the two

176

provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong with relatively lower index of outflow

177

population had more 2019-nCoV cases compared with Henan and Hunan provinces.

178

In Henan, the index of outflow population was about 50000, while there were fewer

179

than 450 cases, which might be lower than expected. In contrast, about 600 confirmed

180

cases were observed in Zhejiang, which had only one fifth of outflow population of

181

Henan. Similar results were obtained using the number cases per unit outflow

182

population (appendix). The mean value of the number of 2019-nCoV cases per unit

183

outflow population across the whole country was 129·72, however, the value in

184

Zhejiang province was more than 450 and the corresponding result in Henan was

185

lower than average.

186

At the city-level analysis (figure 4), we observed that there was a large number

187

of cases in the cities of Hubei province such as Huanggang, Xiaogan, Xiangyang,

188

Jingzhou, etc. Overall, the association between the number of 2019-nCoV cases and

189

index of outflow population at the city-level was in line with that at the provincial

190

level, which both showed that the cities with more index of outflow population would

191

trigger more cases. Similarly, we observed some cities deviated from the general trend

192

including Wenzhou, Taizhou, Xuchang, Luoyang, and Guiyang. For instance, the

193

index of outflow population of Wenzhou and Luoyang was close to identical level,

194

whereas there was tremendous difference in the number of 2019-nCoV cases in the

195

two cities. From the city of Taizhou and Xuchang, we could obtain the analogous

196

results.

197

To evaluate the effect of the city closure on the infection transmission one and

198

two days in advance, we used the index of population outflow of January 21-23, 2020

199

when the Wuhan was still open and index of population outflow of January 24-31,

200

2020 when the city closure policy had been implemented, and the calculations gave

201

the reduced index of population outflow: 102206·69 for city closure one day in

202

advance and 211429·60 for city closure two days in advance. In addition, we obtained

203

the reduced index of population outflow of each other province and correspondingly

204

reduced 2019-nCoV cases. Finally, about 687 and 1420 2019-nCoV cases would be

205

avoided with implementing city closure policy one and two days in advance (table 1).

206

Consistently, if city closure policy of Wuhan was delayed by one or two days, there

207

would be 722 or 1462 extra 2019-nCoV cases respectively.

Discussion

230

Understanding the driving factors of the infectious disease is of particular importance

231

for the timely formulation of effective controlling measures. Our results revealed a

232

close relationship between the population outflow from Wuhan and the 2019-nCoV

233

infection in other areas of China. We assessed the contributions of the lockdown and

234

explored the potential effects of the measure with different implementation dates.

235
236

The fluctuation of outflowing population of Wuhan indicated that the lockdown
in Wuhan reduced the outward movement of the population effectively. However, the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020339; this version posted February 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

237

migration data also suggested that a large number of populations of Wuhan had

238

flowed out before 10:00 am Jan 23, 2020. and 2019-nCoV cases has been widely

239

dispersed nationwide.

240

Distribution of population outflows and cases varied across provinces. Our

241

finding on the effects of population movement on the disease transmission was

242

consistent with other coronaviruses (16-18). Since the infection is transmitted through

243

the respiratory tract and close contact, it is greatly affected by population movements.

244

Firstly, a great number of people flowing out of Wuhan may transmit the virus to the

245

whole country and even worldwide during the Chinese Spring Festival. Secondly, the

246

absence of detectable symptoms during the long incubation period made it difficult to

247

identify the cases in the early stage (13, 19). Thirdly, population movements increase

248

the difficulty of case management and health education. All these factors promoted

249

the transmission of 2019-nCoV. Specially, different from the H1N1 outbreak in 2009

250

(20), the railways might play an important role in the disease transmission. Since

251

railways were widely used before and during the Spring Festival, the area closely

252

connected to Wuhan by railway should be the priority of infection control.

253

Our study provided timely evidence for the formulation of efficient strategies to

254

prevent diseases from spreading out. On the one hand, the result could help assess

255

effectiveness of the prevention and control efforts. For example, the cases in Zhejiang

256

and Guangdong are apparently more than estimated, which indicated a better health

257

emergency response system (i.e. higher detection efficiency) or inadequate isolation.

259

explanations were considered: (1) Strong prevention and control measures were

260

adopted in Henan; (2) The epidemic in Henan has been underestimated and enhanced

261

screening efforts should be enforced. On the other hand, exploring the association was

262

expected to help identify high-risk areas and guide health strategy formulation (21,

263

22). Take Henan for example, great difference between estimated and reported data

264

may imply a great increase of cases in the future, which required enhancement of the

265

surveillance system and rational allocation of resources (18). The medicine supply,

266

personal protective equipment, hospital supplies, and the human resources necessary

267

to respond to an outbreak should be always ensured (23). In addition, this study could

268

be used to guide the assessment of the risk of disease transmission and help raise

269

public awareness. As a large number of infected people had transported to all of 31

270

provinces, epidemics across the country may be inevitable. To halt the spread of the

271

epidemic, harsh measures including quarantine and isolation of exposed persons,

272

cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures, and travel restriction were needed to

273

reduce transmission in affected areas. Furthermore, screening of people who have

274

been to Wuhan recently was of crucial importance, especially cities with close ties to

275

Wuhan.

276

Considering the impact of population movements on the outbreak, the Wuhan

277

government announced the suspension of public transportation on Jan 23, 2020, with

278

a closure of airports, railway stations, and highways, to prevent further disease

279

transmission (24). Despite inconsistent reports on the role of the lockdown in halting

280

the disease transmission across China (22, 23, 25), the unprecedented measure might

281

play an important role in slowing the epidemic spread, especially when an effective

282

vaccine was developed (26, 27). In addition, to explore the impact of date selection,

283

we estimated the changes of cases when the measure was implemented on different

284

date. The results varied significantly, 1420 cases could be prevented with the measure

285

implemented two days earlier, and the number of cases will increase by 1462 with the

286

lockdown implemented two days later, suggesting that the effect of the lockdown

287

depending on the choice of date greatly, which could provide a reference for the

288

future outbreaks. Since the political and economic effects were not considered, further

289

studies on secondary impacts of the measure, like socioeconomic impacts, were also

290

warranted. Though we estimated that some cases would possibly be prevented if the

291

policy was implemented earlier, it was actually hard to make such a huge decision

292

given the whole picture of the infection was not clear at that stage. The authors

293

believe that the current policy was appropriate at this complex situation.

294

There were a few limitations of our study. Firstly, for practical reasons, we used

295

an indicator to reflect the real-time magnitude of population movements, which was

296

acceptable considering our research purpose. Secondly, the influence of some

297

important factors, such as socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, were not

298

considered. Thirdly, it is assumed that the infected travelers in the population are

299

randomly distributed (28), and that there was no significant difference in surveillance

300

capability between cities (18), which might not be the case in reality. In addition,

301

daily data used in this study was reported infection data, rather than the actual number

302

of incident cases. More detailed and further in-depth studies are warranted in the

future.
In conclusion, our study indicates that the population outflow from Wuhan might

305

be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection transmission in China, and the

306

policy of city closure is effective to prevent the epidemic and earlier implementation

307

would be more effective. The magnitude of epidemic might be under-estimated and

308

should be paid more attention, such as Henan and Hunan provinces.
