ABSTRACT
Background: The coronavirus disease outbreak from 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a highly contagious virus
that claimed thousands of lives around the world and disrupted the health system in many
countries. The assessment of emergency capacity in every country is a necessary part of the
COVID-19 response efforts. Thus, it is extremely recommended to evaluate the health care
system to prepare the country to tackle COVID-19 challenges.
Methods and Findings: A retrospective and ecological study was performed with data
retrieved from the public national healthcare database (DATASUS). Numbers of intensive
care unit and infirmary beds, general or intensivists physicians, nurses, nursing technicians,
and ventilators from each Regional Health Unity were extracted, and the beds per health
professionals and ventilators per population rates were assessed. The accessibility to health
services was also performed using a spatial overlay approach to verify regions that lack
assistance. It was found that Brazil lacks equity, integrity, and may struggle to assist with high
complexity for the COVID-19 patients in many regions of the country.
Conclusions: Brazil’s health system is insufficient to tackle the COVID-19 in some regions
of the country where the coronavirus may be responsible for high rates of morbidity and
mortality.
Keywords: Coronavirus; epidemiology; critical care; hospitalization; pandemic.

INTRODUCTION

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated to the novel severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) identified in December 2019 (1). As of
May 4th, 2020 COVID-19 has globally infected 3,759,967 people resulting in 259,474 deaths
(2). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency
of international concern (PHEIC) by the end of January 2020 under the International Health
Regulations (3). Few weeks after the PHEIC declaration, the COVID-19 outbreak was
declared to be a pandemic, drawing attention worldwide (4).
The pandemic led to the adoption of several non-pharmacological interventions
ranging from social distancing guidelines to national-level lockdowns by different countries
(5). These stringent interventions have severely impacted the way of living of many people,
and disrupted the already precarious health system in many countries (6). In response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, several countries undertook analysis for the necessary health system
strengthening efforts. According to studies dedicated to characterize the clinical evolution of
the disease 12% of the cases demanded ICU in Italy (7). In the U.S the percentage of patients
needing ventilator support was even higher, reaching up to 12,2% (8).
The response effort to tackle the COVID-19 requires a strong organization of the
emergency network (9). The lack of beds, iniquities in distribution of hospitals, and an
inadequate availability of ventilators could hamper the actions aiming to decrease the negative
consequences of the COVID-19 (7). Unfortunately, usually the distribution of the health
resources within the countries are characterized by inequities (10). Due to the COVID-19
consequences, the scenario faced by low and medium income countries is even more
staggering (7). The historic challenges regarding an insufficient number of health
professionals, iniquities in distribution of human resources (11), low accessibility to
emergency care services (ECS) (12) and economic issues creates additional pressures to be
addressed, aiming is to achieve an adequate COVID-19 response.
As the COVID-19 spreads around the world, the hospital systems lack measures
against the virus (13), and many countries are experiencing shortages of hospital supplies
(14). For example, as of March 11th, in Italy, where there were 12,462 cases of COVID-19
and 827 deaths, 1,028 of 5,200 beds in intensive care units (ICU) are occupied. A few days
later, there were no more ICU beds available (15). In the United States of America, it is
estimated that the disease will stress bed capacity, equipment, and health care personnel as
never seen before (16). The Brazilian case is not an exception (12). In order to reduce the

burden, the hospital administrators, governments, policy-makers, and researchers must
prepare for a surge in the Healthcare System (17).
On May 7th there were 149,988 confirmed cases and 9,600 deaths in Brazil (18).
However, this number is under-reported and the real number is estimated to be nine times
greater according to some simulations (19). To further the concern, The Imperial College
estimates that up to 1 million of people will fall ill due to COVID-19 in Brazil (20).
During the last decade Brazil is struggling to increase the funding of the public unified
system (SUS). Despite the efforts performed in 2016 the Constitution Amendment 95 (EC 95
acronym in Portuguese) reduced the budget of the Ministry of Health by almost seven billions
Reais by year (21). Before the EC95 the Brazilian Health System was already underfunded
(22). Two years after the EC95 the consequences regarding the lack of funding were
aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, Brazil is also facing a political crisis
contributing to divergences between the administrative levels in the country.
The consequences of all these elements combined could hamper the response actions
to tackle the COVID-19. The availability of information during a crisis is essential to support
the decision-making process based on evidence. Taking this point into consideration the
present work addresses critical aspects regarding the organization of the emergency network
system in Brazil, jointly with the spatial expansion of COVID-19 cases within the country,
and to highlight where the efforts currently performed in Brazil were capable of coping with
the lack of access to emergency care needed to cope COVID-19 consequences.

METHODS

Study design and local
The present paper is an ecological, observational and cross-sectional study using
spatial analysis approach. The data sources is based on secondary data from the Unified
Health System (SUS) (23). To fulfill the defined objective the adequacy parameters in terms
of human resources, health care structure and accessibility to emergency care services (ECS)
were analyzed in comparison with the reported incidence of COVID-19.
According to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE),
Brazil is located in South America with a territorial area of 8.510.820,623 km2, and a total of
210,147,125 inhabitants, with Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.51 with diversified
values for the municipalities ranging from 0.41 to 0.86 (figure 1) (24). For the assessment of

methodological quality, we followed the Guideline Strengthening the Reporting of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) (25).

Figure 1. Location of Brazil and distribution of Human Development Index.

Data sources
To characterize the Brazilian ECS network, three sources were used: National Register
of Health Facilities (CNES acronym in Portuguese), population data from the IBGE, and
COVID-19 cases reported by Secretariat of Surveillance of the Ministry of Health (18, 26).
Data regarding hospitals, professionals (nurses, nursing technicians, nursing assistants,
doctors and physiotherapists), and equipment (ventilators, ICU and infirmary beds) were
obtained from the CNES website using R through the microdataus package (27). Only adult
and pediatric ICUs of type I, II and III were collected as intended for patients with COVID-19
according to ordinance 414 of the Ministry of Health. (28). The population data and thematic
maps were fetched from the IBGE (24).
The match between the number of health professionals and the recommended
suitability parameters were compared using the guidelines from the National Health
Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) Resolution of the Collegiate Board of Directors (RDC). The
ANVISA RDC number 7 provides the minimum requirements for the operation of Intensive
Care Units, in which ten ICU beds are required for each one intensive care physician and one
physiotherapist, one intensive care nurse for each eight beds, and two nursing assistants for
each bed (29). The RDC also has recommends 1 ventilator per 2 beds (29).

The building of thematic maps was carried out by grouping the municipalities by
Health Regions Unity (H.R.) using software QGIS 3.0. The (H.R.) is a continuous geographic
space constituted by a group of bordering municipalities delimited by cultural, economic and
social identities, created by the Ministry of Health in order to mitigate the disparities in the
country (30).

Spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases and the lack of emergency care
To identify regions with a high incidence of COVID-19, simultaneously presenting a
lack of emergency network was used as a spatial overlay approach. The first step comprised
the development of an emergency infrastructure index (EII). The EII was obtained computing
the number of beds registered, by the ratio of professionals and equipment according to the
last competence of February 2020 from CNES.
To evaluate the geographical accessibility to emergency care service care was used the
two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) technique. With this approach, it was possible to
assess the accessibility to emergency care services by the interaction of two geographic
characteristics: (a) the volume of available hospital beds weighted by population within 2
hours of travel distance, and (b) the proximity of hospitals within a 2 hours displacement from
each municipality (11). The 2SFCA method generated two accessibility indexes for each
municipality in Brazil, one regarding the network available in February 2020, and a secondary
one highlighting where the COVID-19 new exclusive beds increased the access to emergency
services. Both indexes created the conditions to identify regions with a lack of access to
emergency care, as well as the regions being benefited by the expansion of the ICU beds
dedicated to the CODVID-19 response. To highlight regions with a high incidence of
COVID-19 and a lack of emergency structure, an overlap analysis was conducted to select the
municipalities concurrently, showing a pattern of high incidence, jointly with a lack of access
to emergency services.
Once the EII was computed, and the municipalities with high incidence within regions
with low access to emergency care services care were identified, a Getis-Ord-Gi analysis was
performed. Thus, it was possible to point out three spatial clusters: (1) emergency care
services accessibility on February 20; (2) municipalities with low access to emergency care
services and high COVID-19 incidence, (3) accessibility to ICU beds exclusively dedicated to
COVID-19 response in March 2020.

Ethics
In accordance with the Resolution No. 510/16 of the National Health Council and
considering that we used secondary sources which are available in governmental and online
databases, the dispensation of the consent form was requested to the Ethics Committee.

RESULTS

All of 5,570 municipalities are distributed in 5 regions and 438 Health Regions Unity
in Brazil. Besides that, Brazil has a total of 35,682 ICU beds, 426,388 hospital beds, 65,411
ventilators, 18,716 intensivists, 564,529 general physicians, 2,768 intensive care nurses,
263,315 nurses, 710,846 nursing technician and 83,040 physiotherapist registered in the
database (February, 2020). In terms of professionals and beds per 10,000 inhabitants, the
southern region had the greatest rates for ICU beds, ventilators, physicians, nurses and
technicians, while the north region had the lowest ones (Table 1). The figure 2 shows the rates
of beds and professionals per Health Regions. The ICU beds per intensivist varied from zero
to 53, zero to 156.5 per intensive care nurse, zero to 0.21 per technician, and zero to 2 per
physiotherapist. In addition, hospital beds per physician varied from 0.10 to 7.14, 0.52 to
11.26 per nurses, 0.19 to 2.58 per technician, and 2.72 to 13.37 per physiotherapist.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of professionals, beds and ventilators throughout the
territory, and classifies this distribution according to RDC number 7. In A, most H.R. are in
accordance with the RDC, which determines up to 10 intensivists for each ICU bed. However,
132 H.R. do not have ICU beds and / or have no intensivist. In B, only 54 H.R. are working
according to the recommended amount of 1 critical care nurse for each 8 ICU beds. C and D
show that 322 H.R. are working correctly with the capacity of 1 nursing assistant and 1
physiotherapist for each 2 and 10 beds, respectively. In the second row of figure 2, F, G and H
show that there are nurses, nursing technicians and physiotherapists working above the limit
of 1 nurse per 8 infirmary bed, 1 nursing technician for each 2 infirmary bed and 1
physiotherapist per 10 infirmary bed.

COVID-19 has shown a fast growth rate in Brazil as shown in figure 3A. In addition,
the growth rate of confirmed deaths shows a very unequal pattern in some regions. Likely due
to different state-level isolation policies, the states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceará and
Amazona have shown a much faster growth rate than the rest of the country (Figure 3B).
Nonetheless, the country as a whole seems to be still far from its peak number of new deaths
by COVID-19.

Caterina where it is already noted areas with hot colors. The hot colors indicate higher levels
of incidence. In terms of deaths all state capitals of the North, Northeast and southeast regions
are presenting high levels of mortality when compared with the rest of the country.

The figure 7 presents three maps characterizing the Brazilian situation in terms of
emergency services and the COVID-19 incidence. The panel A exhibits the accessibility
index to ICU beds by population. The map highlights a higher accessibility index close to the
state capitals of the Brazilian states. The map B emphasizes the municipalities presenting a
COVID-19 incidence higher than the national average of 16.49, simultaneously with an
accessibility index lower than the national mean 21 per 100,000 inhabitants Thus, every
municipality in the map B is facing challenges in terms of ECS and a high COVID-19
incidence for the Brazilian standards. The map C presents the accessibility index of the new
beds created exclusively to offer intensive care to COVID-19 patients. Few beds with this
specific purpose were open in the states of the North and Midwest region of the country.

The panel A shows the accessibility index on February 2020. B presents the high incidence of
the disease and the lack of emergency care services. C exhibits the accessibility index of new
beds created to tackle the COVID-19.

The figure 8 shows the result of spatial clustering analysis to identify trends in access,
as well as in the COVID-19 incidence. Panel A exhibits a hot spot covering the Southeast,
Midwest, and South regions of the country. The states covered by the red layer presents the
spatially significant group of municipalities with higher levels of access to ICU beds by
population. On the opposite side, the blue layer highlights the regions facing geographical
barriers to grant access to ICU beds to the population. To build the map B, the same approach
was used, but this time only applied to the municipalities with high COVID-19 incidence and
a low index of accessibility to ICU beds. The red color characterized a group of municipalities
in the South and Midwest regions. Despite the higher availability of beds in these regions, it
was possible to observe a statistically significant group of municipalities within these regions

with barriers to access ICU beds. Map C illustrates the cluster of accessibility regarding the
ICU beds created to tackle the COVID-19. The lack of overlay between the red color of maps
B and C is pointing out a mismatch of the response efforts dedicated to addressing the
COVID-19 challenge. The regions in map B characterized as hotspots were considered cold
spots regarding the creation of ICU beds dedicated to COVID-19. The result suggests that the
use of scarce resources needed to put in order ICU beds are not being directed to
municipalities lacking access to emergency care services, despite their high levels of COVID19 incidence.

DISCUSSION

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused nearly 4 million confirmed cases and
claimed over 278,756 lives worldwide as of 9th May 2020 (2). It is noteworthy to mention
that the COVID-19 outbreak is a challenge to the health systems worldwide (31), and
although the outcome for the crisis caused by this disease is uncertain, SARS-CoV-2 will
overwhelm the health care infrastructure for months (32). In this study, the Brazilian health
system was evaluated in order to verify its capacity to tackle the COVID-19 challenge.
According to the WHO, it is recommended one doctor and one nurse per 1,000
inhabitants as a parameter of health care for the population (33). To strengthen the WHO
recommendations, the Brazilian Health Governments has established in the Resolution of the
Collegiate Board of Directors (RDC) the quantities of ICU and infirmary beds per

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096719; this version posted May 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

intensivists, general physician, nurses, nursing technician and physiotherapists (29). Although
Table 1 shows that in Brazil there is sufficient number of physicians in the country, the figure
2 shows that these professionals are not evenly distributed to accomplish the WHO
recommendations. In addition, the number of nurses do not meet the criteria in the north and
Midwest. To illustrate the problem, figure 2 shows that Brazil has desert zones of ICU
assistance and regions where these professionals have to take care of beds far beyond the
quantities stipulated by the RDC. Bahtt et al., 2017 verified that professionals in critical care
that were caring for more patients per shift were more likely to experience burnout (34).
Halpern et al., 2017 informed that intensivists are also in shortage in the United States of
America and this situation may be attributed to burnout (35). Therefore, the combat against
the COVID-19 may be a difficult task in these regions, since providing access and affordable
care for the large urban populations is already a challenge for many countries (36).
Experience from Lombardia has shown that 9% of patients were admitted in the ICU
treatment, whereas this number varied from 5 to 32% in some cities in China (37). On the
other hand, in Brazil there’s no available large data of ICU patients at the moment, and
supposing that those numbers might appear in the country as well, only 4 out of 438 Health
Regionals could manage this amount of patients.
In terms of nursing care in ICU accessibility, figure 2 shows that there are large
regions of assistential voids, probably because there are low amounts of ICU nurses in Brazil
(38). Besides that, it’s possible to visualize that there are regions where ICU and generalist
nurses are responsible for more than eight ICU and infirmary beds, which may represent a
risk of unfavorable outcome for the COVID-19 treatment since that high amount of patients
per nurse are associated with a range of negative patient outcomes (39, 40).
The pandemic has led to severe shortages of many essential supplies such as ICU beds
and ventilators (41). Based on Italy's numbers that 10 to 25% of hospitalized patients will
require ventilation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in the USA
there will be between 1.4 to 31 patients per ventilator this period (30, 41). Brazil, on the other
hand, 2.5 to 3.4 million people will require hospitalization, according to The Imperial College
of London (20), which represents 4 to 13 patients per ventilator if distributed equally. The
numbers may represent a satisfactory amount of equipment, however, figure 5 shows that
there’s no ventilators in some H.R. that are potential places to have a high number of deaths.
The most concerning result was obtained through the spatial cluster analysis. As
referring in a recent editorial by the Lancet, Brazil seems to be facing a double crisis. The
Lancet editorial highlighted that the federal government's is going against the technical

recommendations of the Ministry of Health and WHO. Consequently, early on the facing the
pandemic there was a disagreement between the Federal administration, and the states and
municipalities. On account of that situation, each administrative level implemented isolated
responses to prepare for the the COVID-19 with limited country-level coordination. The
spatial clusters analysis highlighted that new beds created to tackle the COVID-19 were not
distributed according to the gaps in access in care historically known in Brazil, potentially a
result of the lack of central planning and governing in facing the crisis. The hot spot clusters
of municipalities with high incidence and lack of access are not overlapping with the hot spot
cluster of new beds dedicated to the COVID-19.
From now on, Brazil has several difficulties in treating patients in critical care. This
paper shows that there is an insufficient number of ICU beds, ventilators, and a huge lack of
professionals in healthcare. Additionally, the allocation of new beds aiming to fight the
COVID-19 pandemic did not address areas with known gaps in care and health infra-structure
availability, contributes to worsening the situation observed through the other indicators
assessed. Developed countries like Italy and the United States demonstrate that COVID-19
can overwhelm the healthcare capacities of well-resourced nations very fast (16,38).
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in middle-income countries, such as Brazil (39), may
be devastating. Our findings suggest that strong leadership is needed to coordinate the
response efforts against the COVID-19.
The limitations in this work rely on the complex data available. Health data from
health information systems, including health-facility records, surveys or vital statistics, may
not be representative of the entire population of a country and in some cases may not even be
accurate (44). The CNES database presents some limitations well known by the Brazilian
scientific community (45). Despite this, the information regarding the availability of COVID19 beds was published just a month ago, calling attention to the occurrence of efforts aiming
to improve the quality of the data available to policymakers.
