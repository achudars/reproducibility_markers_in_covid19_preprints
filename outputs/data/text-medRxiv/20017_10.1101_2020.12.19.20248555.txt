Abstract
Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been recommended to receive first priority for limited
COVID-19 vaccines. They have also been identified as potential ambassadors of COVID-19
vaccine acceptance, helping to ensure that sufficient members of a hesitant public accept
COVID-19 vaccines to achieve population immunity. Yet HCWs themselves have shown
vaccine hesitancy in other contexts and the few prior surveys of U.S. HCW intentions to receive
a COVID-19 vaccine report acceptance rates of only 28% to 34%. However, it is unknown
whether HCW acceptance remains low following mid-November announcements of the efficacy
of the first COVID-19 vaccines and the issuance of two emergency use authorizations (EUA) in
December. We report the results of a December 2020 survey (​N = 16,158; response rate 61%)
administered by a large Pennsylvania health system to determine the intentions of its
employees to receive a vaccine when it is offered to them. In a mixed sample of individuals
serving in patient-facing and other roles, 55% would decide to receive a COVID-19 vaccine
when offered, 16.4% would not, and 28.5% reported being undecided. The distribution of
responses varied little across hospital campuses, between those in patient-facing roles and
other HCWs, or by area or department of work. The higher rate of COVID-19 vaccine
acceptance we observe may reflect the framing and timing of our survey. Among hesitant
respondents, an overwhelming majority (90.3%) reported concerns about unknown risks and
insufficient data. Other commonly reported concerns included known side effects (57.4%) and
wanting to wait until they see how it goes with others (44.4%). We observed a substantial
increase in self-reported intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine after an FDA advisory committee
voted to recommend an EUA. Among respondents who completed the survey after that point in
time, 79% intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (​n ​= 1155). Although only suggestive, this
trend offers hope that rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance may be higher among HCWs and,
perhaps, the general public than more hypothetical survey results have indicated.

Introduction
Vaccines against COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, present a critical
milestone in the global response to the pandemic. But, as many have noted, vaccines don’t
prevent disease; vaccinations do. Given the existence of vaccine hesitancy in other contexts
(MacDonald et. al., 2015; Dubé et. al., 2013) and the fact that COVID-19 vaccines are, by
definition, novel, there has long been concern by public health researchers and policymakers
about whether sufficient numbers of people will be willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine to reach
population, or so-called “herd,” immunity—estimated, in this context, to require vaccination rates
of between 67% and 85% (Randolh & Barreiro 2020; Fontanet et al., 2020; Kwok et al., 2020;
Higgins-Dunn & Lovelace 2020).
Several surveys of intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, when one becomes available, have
been administered throughout the pandemic by academics, polling organizations, and market
researchers. A metaanalysis of 30 such surveys resulted in an estimated global acceptance rate
of 68.4% (Wang, W. et. al., 2020). Surveys of the U.S. population that asked respondents
whether they would, would not, or were unsure about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine have
reported rates of intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine that range from 47% to 65%.
Intentions have been somewhat volatile, perhaps reflecting the politicization of the pandemic
response and election-related events.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that healthcare
workers (HCWs)—“paid and unpaid persons serving in health care settings who have the
potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials”—should be first to be
offered a vaccine (along with residents of long-term care facilities), due to their increased
exposure and their role in supporting critical healthcare functions (Dooling et al., 2020). Some
survey evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccine acceptance is greater among the general
population if healthcare providers recommend it (Reiter et al., 2020). However, vaccine
hesitancy in other contexts has been widely reported among HCWs (Paterson et. al., 2016).
Relatively few surveys of COVID-19 vaccine intentions have been conducted of HCWs,
especially in the U.S. Surveys administered earlier in the pandemic, when vaccine enthusiasm
was generally higher across the board (Gallup Panel, 2020; Morning Consult, 2020), found that
outside the U.S., there was greater COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among HCWs than among
the general population (Dror et al., 2020; Gagneux-Brunon et al., 2020; Harapan et al., 2020).
More recent non-U.S. studies have found vaccine hesitancy among HCWs to be mostly in line
with the general population (Grech et al., 2020; Wang, K. et al., 2020), jeopardizing hopes of
clinicians serving as ambassadors of vaccine acceptance for their patients (Rowland, 2020).
In the U.S., the few surveys of HCWs that have been conducted have been administered later in
the pandemic—but prior to public knowledge about specific COVID-19 vaccines—and have
found that HCWs show equal or greater hesitancy than the general population. Two surveys
conducted in October and October-November, respectively, found that only 34% of U.S. nurses

(​N ​= 12,939) would choose to be vaccinated (American Nurses Foundation, 2020) and only 31%
of physicians and nurses (​N ​= 370) would like to get the vaccine in the first wave (ReviveHealth,
2020), which is markedly lower than surveys of the general U.S. public conducted around the
same time (Gallup Panel, 2020; Ipsos, 2020). A September survey found that just 28% of
emergency medical services (EMS) personnel (​N ​= 528) would choose to get the vaccine when
it was available (Hatt, 2020) and a September-October survey found that only 32% of UCLA
Health System employees (​N ​= 609) intended to receive a vaccine as soon as possible (Gadoth
et al., 2020)—again, notably lower than vaccine acceptance rates among the general public
around the same time period (Tyson et al., 2020; Harris Poll, 2020: Hamel et al., 2020).
Reviewing the survey data published through December 10, a work group of the CDC Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) convened to consider the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 vaccine concluded that overall acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine was “moderate”
(Oliver, 2020, slide 27). The ACIP noted, however, that most surveys were conducted prior to
availability of specific information about the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The companies
announced on November 9 that an interim analysis suggested that their vaccine had an efficacy
rate “above 90%” (Pfizer Inc., BioNTech, 2020). On November 18, they announced that their
Phase III trial had met all of its primary efficacy endpoints and that an updated analysis found a
95% efficacy rate (Business Wire, 2020). To our knowledge, no published surveys of HCWs
have been conducted since that date, and no surveys at all have been published that were
conducted after the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine on December 10. Yet intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine may be sensitive to
vaccine-specific information such as efficacy and side effect profiles, to endorsements by local
or national bodies, to the immediacy of the decision, and to social norms such as internal or
external colleagues receiving the vaccine (or declining it).
Geisinger is a large, integrated health system serving central and northeast Pennsylvania.
Beginning on December 4, as HCW decisions to receive or decline a COVID-19 vaccine
appeared imminent, and to help inform the system’s plans for allocating and distributing limited
supplies of COVID-19 vaccines across its 8 campuses, all employees were asked to complete a
“COVID vaccine readiness survey” indicating whether they plan to receive a vaccine when one
is available for them. The survey also sought to understand reasons for hesitancy, in order to
inform internal communications and education efforts.

Materials and methods
Participants
A link to a short, 5-question survey hosted by Microsoft Forms was emailed to 26,361 Geisinger
employees on December 4, 2020. Employees were told that the Pennsylvania Department of
Health had directed that first doses of anticipated vaccines would be given to HCWs working in
settings where symptomatic COVID-19 patients present for care, with other employees being
offered a vaccine in phases over time. See the Discussion for a detailed description of the
survey solicitation. The survey asked employees to identify the hospital campus closest to them;

whether their role is clinical/direct patient-facing, not clinical/direct patient-facing, or other; and,
for those with patient-facing or “other” roles, what area they work in (e.g., ICU, outpatient clinic,
food services). Employees were then asked whether they would decide to receive the
COVID-19 vaccine when one is available to them; those who responded “no” or “undecided”
were then asked to select as many of the nine given reasons for their hesitancy that applied
and/or to write in one or more additional reasons. Employees were asked to complete the
survey by December 10, but the survey remained open and employees continued to submit
responses. Reminders to take the survey were included in multiple issues of an internal daily
newsletter distributed to all employees by email. Although this survey was designed and
conducted as an administrative survey to inform operations and not as human subjects
research, Geisinger’s IRB has determined that anonymous research surveys conducted by the
authors are exempt from IRB review (IRB # 00008345).
Free response coding
To analyze free responses, we used a content analysis approach and developed a ten-code
codebook based on an initial review of a subset of the free responses. A coder then applied the
codebook to categorize 1224 free responses provided by participants into the ten new
categories. Free responses that simply recapitulated one of the nine pre-provided reasons were
coded using the relevant pre-provided reason.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis and data visualization was performed using R statistical software version
4.0.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing) and RStudio version 1.2.5001. Following evolving
standards for reporting exploratory, non-confirmatory results (Benjamin et. al., 2018), we set
statistical significance at α = 0.005 for 2-tailed tests; we describe results meeting a threshold of
0.05 as suggestive.

Results
Sample characteristics
A total of 16,158 Geisinger employees (61.3% response rate) have completed the survey at the
time of writing. In order to keep the survey brief and to encourage honest responses, responses
were anonymous and sociodemographic data were not collected. The average age of a
Geisinger employee is 43 and employees span generational eras: 1% Silent Generation, 28%
Baby Boomers, 22% Generation X, 46% Generation Y, and 3% Generation Z. Employees have
worked for Geisinger for an average of 9.4 years. Employees are 73% female and 89% white.
The study sample included respondents who reported proximity to each of Geisinger’s eight
campuses, with most respondents (44.1%) reporting closest proximity to Geisinger Medical
Center (GMC), where the health system is headquartered (Figure 1A). Respondents work in a
number of different areas. Of the 58% of respondents who work in a clinical or other direct
patient-facing role and an additional 4.4% of respondents who did not describe their role as
either patient- or non-patient-facing (Figure 1B), 28% work in ambulatory settings and clinics,

in an emergency department (ED) (Figure 1C).

When asked: “Will you decide to receive the COVID-19 vaccine when one is available to you?,”
55% of respondents said “yes,” 16.4% said “no,” and 28.5% were “undecided” (Figure 4A).
The distribution of responses varied little by proximity to different campuses: the percentage of
vaccine-accepting respondents ranged only from a low of 51.5% nearest one campus to a high

of 56.5% nearest another; the percentage of respondents who intend to decline a vaccine
ranged from 14.9% to 19.6%; and the percentage of undecided respondents ranged from 27.5%
to 33.4%.
Consistent with their increased exposure to the virus, respondents in patient-facing roles were
more likely to say they intend to receive a vaccine (56.8%) than were those in non-patient-facing
roles (51.4%, p<<0.005). However patient-facing workers were also slightly more likely to say
they will decline a vaccine when one is available to them (17.5% vs. 15.6%, p<0.005). (Table
S1). This may reflect the fact that patient-facing employees will also be offered a vaccine
sooner, when less is known about the medium-term risks.
Among those in patient-facing roles, there were no clear or consistent patterns of intention
across areas of work. Of those work areas with more than 100 respondents, the highest intent
was reported among those working in ICU settings (63.1% of 738 respondents), inpatient care
(60.9% of 2592), and other inpatient settings (60.5% of 661). Employees in these areas face
greater exposure to the virus and, as a result, are among those employees who are the very first
to be offered a COVID-19 vaccine. Yet the lowest intent was also reported among those working
in emergency departments (51.9% of 616 respondents), who are also considered high-exposure
and are in the same priority tier (Table S2). A limitation of these analyses is that a substantial
number of respondents who were asked this question (19.8%) reported serving in an “other”
work area (Figure 1C).
Reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy
A total of 7265 respondents indicated either that they would decline a COVID-19 vaccine when
one is available to them or that they were undecided (hereinafter, “vaccine hesitant”
respondents). Vaccine hesitant respondents on average selected 2.73 ± 1.42 (mean ± s.d.)
reasons for their hesitancy, with most selecting 3 reasons. An overwhelming majority (90.3%) of
these respondents reported concerns about unknown risks of the vaccine, and more than half
(57.4%) cited concerns about known side-effects such as headache and fatigue. A notable
44.4% reported that they would like to wait to take the vaccine until they see how it goes with
others (Figure 2).
A total of 1224 respondents (16.1% of all hesitant respondents) provided additional reasons for
their hesitancy beyond those provided in the survey instrument. These free responses were
categorized based on a developed codebook (Methods) into ten additional codes. The most
commonly raised concerns were those related to current or future pregnancy or breastfeeding
(2.2% of the 7265 hesitant respondents). Other more frequently reported reasons included
incompatibility with religious, personal or ethical beliefs (1.8%) and reportedly being
immunocompromised or having another condition that made vaccination medically
contraindicated (1.2%). A total of 77 respondents (about 90% of whom intend to decline a
COVID-19 vaccine) spontaneously raised concerns about any potential COVID-19 vaccine
mandate (1.1%). Other respondents reported having had allergic reactions to other vaccines
(0.8%); raised concerns about the vaccine’s potential impact on fertility (0.6%); commented

about the vaccine being ineffective or there being insufficient proof of efficacy (0.5%); indicated
concerns that the vaccine’s ingredients were not natural (0.3%) or provided other miscellaneous
reasons such as cost, fear of needles, or an aversion to being “experimented on'' (0.6%) (Figure
2).

Figure 2.​ Respondents’ reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy
Compared to those who are undecided, those who intend to decline a vaccine were more likely
to cite concern about known side effects (62% vs. 54.8%, p << 0.005), report distrust in the FDA
process (36.3% vs. 12.2%, p << 0.005), and raise privacy concerns (22.9% vs. 8.7%, p <<
0.005). Those who intend to decline a vaccine were also much more likely to select not being at
high risk for either infection (17.5% vs. 4.4%, p << 0.005) or serious COVID-19 disease (20.5%
vs. 4.6%, p << 0.005). Unsurprisingly, undecided respondents were much more likely to say that
whether they will accept a vaccine depends on when one is offered to them, because they
would like to “wait and see” how it goes with others (51.4% vs. 32.1%, p << 0.005). We also

observed one suggestive difference between the groups, with those who intend to decline more
likely to cite concerns about unknown risks or insufficient data than those who are undecided,
p<0.05. (Figure 3A). Finally, respondents who intend to decline a vaccine were more likely to
cite concerns related to pregnancy or breastfeeding (2.9% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.005); religious,
personal or ethical beliefs (4.4% vs. 0.3%, p << 0.005); and concerns about a potential vaccine
mandate (2.6% vs. 0.2%, p << 0.005).
Respondents serving in patient-facing roles were more likely to endorse concerns about
unknown risks (91.7% vs 88.8%, p << 0.005) or reference having had COVID-19 as a reason for
their hesitancy (4.5% vs. 2.4%, p << 0.005). Conversely, those in non-patient-facing roles were
more likely to note that they would “wait and see” how it goes with others (48.2% vs. 41.4%, p <
0.005). We also found a few suggestive differences: those in patient-facing roles were more
likely to distrust the FDA process (21.7% vs. 20.5%, p < 0.05) and more likely to report that their
decision will depend on which vaccine they are offered (11.9% vs. 10.6%, p < 0.05) (Figure 3B).

We observe only a handful of significant or suggestive differences in the reasons for hesitancy
across campuses. The largest difference regards concerns about known side effects: the
frequency with which this reason for hesitancy was cited ranged from 50.8% among
respondents who work closest to one campus to 67.4% among respondents who work closest to
another campus, a difference in absolute percentage points of 16.6. Absolute differences in the
frequency of other reasons by campus proximity ranged from 2.9% to 7.5%.
Somewhat more surprisingly, when we look at those areas in which at least 100 patient-facing
respondents work, we similarly observe few significant or suggestive differences in the reasons
for hesitancy (Figure S1). The largest difference is in concern about known side-effects: 48.9%
of ICU workers endorsed this concern compared to 62.7% of those working in environmental
services, with other work areas falling within that percentage point range of 13.8. Absolute
differences in the frequency of other reasons by work area ranged from 3.1% to 10.8%.
Intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, over time
During the period of data collection, a number of high-profile local, national, and international
events related to the first administrations of a COVID-19 vaccine outside of clinical trials
occurred that might plausibly have affected respondents’ intentions regarding COVID-19
vaccines. These events are described in the Discussion and some are plotted in Figure 4. To
explore whether these events appear to have influenced HCW intentions to receive a COVID-19
vaccine, we first split the respondents into two subpopulations—those who submitted their
survey response before the livestreamed VRBPAC vote to recommend an EUA on Dec 10,
2020, 5:38pm EST (​n ​= 15,003), and those who submitted it at any time afterwards (​n ​=
1128)—and compared the reported intentions between the two groups (hereafter, “pre-EUA”
and “post-EUA” respondents). We found that, of the 7.2% of respondents who completed the
survey post-EUA, 79% reported they would receive the COVID-19 vaccine; by contrast, of the
92.9% of respondents who had already completed the survey, 53.2% reported an intention to
receive a vaccine. This difference was statistically significant (p << 0.005) (Figure 4B). We then
looked at the distribution of responses per day and observed a steady increase in intent to
receive a vaccine coinciding with several notable internal and external vaccine-related events
(Figure 4C). Due to the considerable reduction in sample size over time and the possibility that
latecomers to the survey are not representative, this finding is consistent with multiple
interpretations and should be treated with caution.

Reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, over time
Across all hesitant respondents, those who completed the survey pre-EUA were slightly more
likely to say that whether they receive a vaccine will depend on when it is offered to them,
because they would like to wait and see how it goes with others (57.3% vs. 53.9%, p < 0.05), as
well as report feeling that they did not need a vaccine because they are not at high risk of
infection (8.8% vs. 5.3%, p < 0.05). We observed no other significant or suggestive differences.
Nor did we observe any significant or suggestive pre- vs. post-EUA differences in reasons for
hesitancy among patient-facing or non-patient-facing respondents (or between them).

Discussion
We surveyed over 16,000 employees of a large health system and found that 55% would decide
to receive the COVID-19 vaccine when one is available to them. Although well below rates
required for population immunity, this rate is substantially greater than those reported in similar
surveys administered as recently as September to November, where reported intentions by
HCWs to receive a COVID-19 vaccine ranged from just 28% to 34% (American Nurses
Foundation, 2020; ReviveHealth, 2020; Hatt, 2020; Gadoth et al., 2020).
Several things might explain this observed increase in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among
the HCWs we surveyed. It could be that the population we sampled has always had
substantially greater intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine than the other populations
surveyed. For instance, surveys have consistently—and understandably—found greater
COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among members of the African American community (AP-NORC,
2020; Fisher et al., 2020; Gallup, 2020; Hamel, Lopes, Muñana et al., 2020; Kreps et al., 2020;
Malik et al., 2020; Reiter et al., 2020; Tyson et al., 2020), and we surveyed a population that is
89% white. On the other hand, greater COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has also been repeatedly
reported among political conservatives and independents (Gallup, 2020; Hamel, Kearney,
Kirzinger et al., 2020; Kreps et al., 2020; Morning Consult, 2020; Reiter et al., 2020; Tyson et
al., 2020), and political conservatism is associated with residents of Geisinger’s catchment area
in central and northeast Pennsylvania (WGAL, 2020).
It is also possible that the difference in rate of vaccine acceptance that we observe at least
partially reflects the different posture of our survey. Almost all other surveys were administered
by polling organizations or academic researchers and designed simply to measure national
opinion. Our survey, by contrast, was administered by an employer tasked with distributing
vaccines to interested respondents. The survey was administered via a relatively rare
system-wide “administrative announcement” email and was attributed to Geisinger's Division
Chief of Infectious Diseases, who stated, “we encourage you to strongly consider taking the
vaccine.” The source of information, such as an authority figure, has been shown to influence
the extent to which recipients incorporate the information into their decision-making (Dolan et
al., 2012).
Although our survey, like the others, measured only intentions and not behaviors, our survey
framed the decision whether to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as imminent for respondents.
Stated intentions and actual behaviors are known to frequently diverge (Sheeran & Webb,
2016), and our survey may have measured intentions in a way that helped close that gap to
some extent. For instance, the survey was described as a “COVID-19 Vaccination Readiness
Survey,” employees were told that Geisinger expected that multiple vaccines would “soon
receive” an EUA, that Geisinger was “actively planning” for distribution among employees,
“potentially in the next few weeks,” and that respondents’ “time-sensitive response [was]
needed” to help effectively plan that distribution process.

The announcement used a gain frame, noting that the vaccines were expected to be as much
as 90 to 95 percent effective, and further contextualized this information by noting that
COVID-19 vaccines are therefore “substantially more effective than the flu vaccine” (which
Geisinger employees are required to take). Gain-framed messages have been shown to be
effective in promoting certain prevention behaviors (O’Keefe & Jensen, 2007). Immediately after
noting the vaccines’ substantial benefits, employees were told that initial supplies would be “very
limited.” When a resource is in short supply, desirability for that item tends to increase (Cialdini,
2001) and limited-quantity scarcity messages have been found to positively influence
consumption intentions (Aggarwal et al., 2013).
It seems likely that the overall increased rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance we observe
compared to Fall 2020 surveys is also at least partly due to the more recent timing of our
survey. Between fall and early December, new material information about vaccines became
available, such as the very high vaccine efficacy rates and reassuring short-term safety profiles
of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines; as discussed above, the efficacy information
was explicitly incorporated into our survey solicitation message. Our respondents may also have
been influenced to have a more favorable view of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines in light of
the recent national surge in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths (New York Times,
2020), which Geisinger has also experienced.
Even within the period of our December data collection, we observe a trend over time that
suggests still-increasing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. This could reflect several events that
occurred during this time. Late on December 10, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products
Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) to the FDA voted to recommend an emergency use
authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Stat Staff, 2020). The next
morning, the FDA announced that it would issue an EUA shortly (Hahn & Marks, Dec. 11, 2020),
and it did so late that day (Hinton, 2020). At that point, Geisinger launched an internal
informational campaign about the vaccine and its imminent distribution, some materials of which
are public (Geisinger, 2020). Internal materials include video testimonials from employee
leaders who explain why they have chosen to receive the vaccine. On December 12, the ACIP
voted to recommend the vaccine (Oliver et al., 2020), and the next day, national media reported
images of FedEx and UPS vehicles transporting the vaccine, accompanied by U.S. Marshals
and, often, cheering onlookers. One video of trucks leaving Pfizer’s facility in Kalamazoo,
Michigan, was posted to Twitter and has been viewed over 4 million times (Muntean, 2020). On
December 14, media published the images of HCWs receiving the vaccine. Vaccination of
HCWs began at Geisinger on December 15. Late on December 17, the VRBPAC voted to
recommend an EUA for Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine (Stat Staff, 2020), the FDA indicated that
it would issue an EUA shortly (Hahn & Marks, Dec. 17, 2020). On December 18, several
prominent members of both major political parties, including Vice President Mike Pence (whose
vaccination was carried live on major news networks, including Fox News), Second Lady Karen
Pence, Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell—but, conspicuously, not President Trump—publicly and enthusiastically received
the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (Kraft-Todd et al., 2020; Peters, 2020). That evening, the FDA

issued an EUA for the Moderna vaccine and President-Elect Joe Biden issued a statement
saying that he looked forward to receiving a vaccine on Monday, December 21, and set a goal
for administering 100 million vaccine shots in the first 100 days of his administration (Biden,
2020). As the vaccination rollout got under way in earnest, some patient-facing HCWs at other
health systems publicly protested their systems’ vaccine allocation schemes, which they felt
unfairly deprioritized them relative to their exposure to the virus (Bernstein et al., 2020;
Eisenberg, 2020).
Although caution is warranted in interpreting our observed day-by-day increase in vaccine
acceptance as representative of our sample population, these events could have helped
associate COVID-19 vaccines with several sentiments that should increase intention to receive
a vaccination. These include: the sense the receiving a COVID-19 vaccine is normative among
influential people and/or HCWs (Cialdini, 2007; Goldstein et al., 2008; Salmon et al., 2014;
Venema et al., 2020); that, perhaps unlike some other pandemic behaviors, vaccination is
bipartisan; that in receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, especially in the first wave, one participates in
an historic moment; and that early vaccination is a reflection of the importance of one’s heroic
role on the front lines of the pandemic response, such that being deprioritized for vaccination is,
in the words of one healthcare worker, “insulting” (Bernstein et al., 2020).
We observe a significant, but surprisingly modest, increased intention to receive a vaccination
among patient-facing HCWs and, within patient-facing employees, respondents who work in
areas of the highest exposure are both most and least likely to say they will receive a vaccine.

Limitations
Our survey has several limitations. Because the survey was anonymous, we cannot exclude the
possibility that some respondents took the survey more than once. They might have done so if
they believed that the survey results could affect availability of a vaccine at Geisinger, their
nearest campus, or for themself. Respondents live and work in one particular region of the U.S.
and results might not be generalizable to other U.S. HCWs. Our analyses of intention over time
is limited by the fact that latecomers to the survey might not be representative of the sampled
population as a whole. Finally, we asked respondents whether they intended to receive a
COVID-19 vaccine when one is available to them, not ever, so rates of decline should be
interpreted accordingly.
