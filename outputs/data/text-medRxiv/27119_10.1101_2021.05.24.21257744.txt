ABSTRACT:

54

Objectives: To estimate the effectiveness of one and two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines

55

against symptomatic infection and severe outcomes.

56

Design: Using a test-negative design study and linked laboratory, vaccination, and health

57

administrative databases, we estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness (aVE) against

58

symptomatic infection and severe outcomes (hospitalization or death) using multivariable

59

logistic regression.

60

Setting: Ontario, Canada between 14 December 2020 and 19 April 2021.

61

Participants: Community-dwelling adults aged ≥16 years who were tested for SARS-CoV-2

62

and had COVID-19 symptoms.

63

Interventions: Pfizer-BioNTech’s BNT162b2 or Moderna’s mRNA-1273 vaccine.

64

Main outcome measures: Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 identified by RT-PCR;

65

hospitalization or death associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

66

Results: Among 324,033 symptomatic individuals, 53,270 (16.4%) were positive for SARS-

67

CoV-2 and 21,272 (6.6%) received ≥1 vaccine dose. Among test-positive cases, 2,479 (4.7%)

68

had a severe outcome. aVE against symptomatic infection ≥14 days after receiving only 1 dose

69

was 60% (95%CI, 57 to 64%), increasing from 48% (95%CI, 41 to 54%) at 14–20 days after the

70

first dose to 71% (95%CI, 63 to 78%) at 35–41 days. aVE ≥7 days after receiving 2 doses was

71

91% (95%CI, 89 to 93%). Against severe outcomes, aVE ≥14 days after receiving 1 dose was

72

70% (95%CI, 60 to 77%), increasing from 62% (95%CI, 44 to 75%) at 14–20 days to 91%

73

(95%CI, 73 to 97%) at ≥35 days, whereas aVE ≥7 days after receiving 2 doses was 98% (95%CI,

74

88 to 100%). For adults aged ≥70 years, aVE estimates were lower after receiving 1 dose, but

75

were comparable to younger adults after 28 days. After 2 doses, we observed high aVE against

76

E484K-positive variants.

77

Conclusions: Two doses of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines are highly effective against

78

both symptomatic infection and severe outcomes. Effectiveness is lower after only a single dose,

79

particularly for older adults shortly after the first dose.

INTRODUCTION

81

Understanding how clinical trial efficacy estimates of COVID-19 vaccines translate into real-

82

world effectiveness estimates is crucial, given differences in populations, dosing intervals, and

83

emerging variants.1 Due to COVID-19 vaccine supply constraints, Canada’s National Advisory

84

Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended extending the interval between doses to a

85

maximum of 16 weeks.2 With vaccine supply constraints globally, determining the effectiveness

86

of these vaccines following a single dose vs. two doses is important for informing policy for

87

many countries.1

88

We applied the test-negative design to linked, population-based health databases in

89

Ontario, Canada (population 15 million) to evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against

90

symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes (i.e., hospitalization or death

91

associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection) for two mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech’s

92

BNT162b2 and Moderna’s mRNA-1273).

93
94

METHODS

95

Study population, setting, and design

96

We conducted a test-negative design study among community-dwelling Ontarians who had

97

symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The test-negative design is comparable to a nested case-

98

control design, with symptomatic individuals who are tested for the presence of a pathogen of

99

interest serving as the nesting cohort.1,3,4 All Ontarians aged ≥16 years, eligible for provincial

100

health insurance, not living in long-term care, and who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 14

101

December 2020 and 19 April 2021 were eligible for inclusion. We excluded individuals who

102

tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 prior to 14 December 2020 and recipients of the ChAdOx1

vaccine. We restricted the analysis to individuals who were documented to have at least one

104

relevant COVID-19 symptom at the time of testing.

105
106

Data sources and definitions

107

We linked data from provincial SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing, COVID-19 vaccination, and

108

health administrative datasets using unique encoded identifiers and analyzed them at ICES.

109
110

Outcomes

111

Our first primary outcome of interest was symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, ascertained by

112

real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).5 Using data from the

113

Ontario Laboratories Information System (OLIS), which captured 91.8% (n=258,207) of all

114

provincially reported cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (n=281,261) during the study

115

period, test-positive individuals were treated as cases and test-negative individuals were treated

116

as controls. Since symptom onset dates were inconsistently reported in OLIS, we used the

117

specimen collection date as the index date. For cases with multiple positive tests, we used the

118

date of their first positive test. For controls with multiple negative tests, we used the date of a

119

randomly selected negative test as the index date.

120
121

We obtained information on variants and mutations from the Public Health Case and Contact

122

Management system (CCM), which contains information on the clinical course of cases and the

123

results of screening tests for N501Y and E484K mutations and whole genome sequencing results

124

that identify specific variant of concern (VOC) lineages (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1). All RT-PCR-

125

positive specimens with cycle threshold values ≤35 were tested for the N501Y mutation (starting

3 February 2021) and the E484K mutation (starting 22 March 2021).6 We considered samples

127

with positive N501Y and negative E484K mutations as lineage B.1.1.7, and samples with

128

positive N501Y and E484K mutations as lineage B.1.351 or P.1. We combined the latter two

129

lineages for our analysis because there were very small numbers of cases identified using whole

130

genome sequencing.

131
132

Our second primary outcome was severe disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined

133

as either hospitalization or death with a recent positive test, using the earliest of the specimen

134

collection date or the hospitalization or death date as the index date. We identified these

135

outcomes using CCM (for both hospitalizations and deaths), the Canadian Institute for Health

136

Information’s Discharge Abstract Database (DAD; for hospitalizations), and the Ontario

137

Registered Persons Database (RPDB; for deaths). For hospitalizations identified using DAD, a

138

positive test must have occurred within 14 days prior to or 3 days after admission. For deaths

139

identified using RPDB, a positive test must have occurred within 30 days prior to death or within

140

7 days post-mortem.

141
142

COVID-19 vaccination

143

BNT162b2 became available in Ontario on 14 December 2020, and mRNA-1273 on 28

144

December 2020.7 The initial vaccination phase prioritized high-risk populations such as older

145

adults living in congregate settings, healthcare workers, adults living in Indigenous communities,

146

and adults aged ≥80 years. Ontario had initially followed the manufacturers’ recommended

147

dosing schedules (i.e., a 21-day interval for BNT162b2 and a 28-day interval for mRNA-1273),

148

but in late January 2021 extended the interval to 35-42 days for everyone except older adults

living in congregate settings and Indigenous individuals, due to disruptions in vaccine supply. In

150

early March, Ontario adopted NACI’s recommendation to delay administration of the second

151

dose by up to 16 weeks for most individuals.8,9 By April, eligibility was expanded to include

152

adults in high COVID-19-incidence communities, individuals with certain health conditions and

153

their caregivers, certain essential frontline workers, and graduated expansion of eligibility by

154

decreasing age.7 As of 19 April 2021, 28% of Ontario adults had received at least one dose of a

155

COVID-19 vaccine.10 Comprehensive documentation of all COVID-19 vaccination events in

156

Ontario, including product, date of administration, and dose number, is recorded in COVaxON, a

157

centralized COVID-19 vaccine information system.

158
159

Covariates

160

We obtained age, sex, and postal code of residence as of 14 December 2020 from RPDB. We

161

obtained the number of RT-PCR tests for each subject during the 3 months prior to 14 December

162

2020 from OLIS to use as a proxy for highly tested individuals at increased risk of exposure to

163

SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., healthcare workers and caregivers of long-term care residents, who

164

must also undergo serial SARS-CoV-2 testing). We grouped testing dates into 2-week periods to

165

capture temporal changes in viral activity and regional vaccine roll-out. We determined the

166

presence of comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID-19,11 identified from various

167

databases using validated algorithms and commonly accepted diagnostic codes, which have been

168

described elsewhere.12 We ascertained receipt of influenza vaccination during the 2019/2020

169

and/or 2020/2021 influenza season using physician and pharmacist billing claims in the Ontario

170

Health Insurance Plan and Ontario Drug Benefit databases, respectively. We determined the

171

public health unit of residence using the postal code and Statistics Canada Postal Code

Conversion File Plus (version 7B) and grouped them into larger regions. We obtained

173

information at the ecologic level of dissemination area (DA) on four important social

174

determinants of health (median neighbourhood income, proportion of the working population

175

employed as non-health essential workers [i.e., those unable to work from home], average

176

number of persons per dwelling, and proportion of the population who self-identify as a visible

177

minority) from 2016 Census data.13 DAs generally contain 400-700 individuals. Details related

178

to these covariates are available in Supplementary Table S1.

179
180

Statistical analysis

181

We conducted descriptive analyses and calculated standardized differences to compare

182

characteristics between test-positive cases and test-negative controls, and between vaccinated

183

and unvaccinated individuals.

184
185

We used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratio (OR) comparing the

186

odds of vaccination between test-positive cases and test-negative controls. We estimated

187

unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios accounting for all covariates listed above. These covariates

188

were selected a priori based on their known associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection or severity

189

and COVID-19 vaccine receipt.2,11,14 VE was calculated using the following formula: VE = (1-

190

OR) x 100%.

191
192

For the primary analysis, we estimated overall VE (for both vaccines combined) for those who

193

received only 1 dose by their index date and those who received 2 doses by their index date. We

194

considered index dates within varying intervals after vaccination.

195
196

We also estimated VE ≥14 days after the first dose (among those who only received 1 dose) and

197

≥7 days after the second dose, stratified by vaccine product (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273), age

198

group (16–39, 40–69, and ≥70 years), sex, presence of any comorbidity, epidemic wave (index

199

dates 14 December 2020–7 February 2021, representing wave 2 in Ontario; 8 February 2021–21

200

March 2021, representing the period between wave 2 and wave 3; and 22 March 2021–19 April

201

2021, representing wave 3), and variant (earlier variant vs. B.1.1.7 vs. B.1.351 or P.1). We also

202

estimated VE by varying intervals after vaccination stratified by age group.

203
204

We repeated these analyses for severe outcomes, with adjustments to the intervals after

205

vaccination due to reduced sample sizes.

206
207

All analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). All tests

208

were two-sided and used p<0.05 as the level of statistical significance.

209
210

RESULTS

211

From 14 December 2020 – 19 April 2021, 2,171,449 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2.

212

After excluding individuals who had SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the study period and

213

individuals who had received ChAdOx1 vaccine, 60.5% of those remaining did not have

214

symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or had no symptom information recorded in OLIS, 24.4%

215

were recorded as asymptomatic, and 15.1% had symptoms consistent with COVID-19 recorded

216

at the time of testing (eFigure 1). Grouped together, individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms

217

and those deemed asymptomatic had similar characteristics as the remaining individuals, except

for COVID-19 vaccine uptake, public health unit region, and number of previous SARS-CoV-2

219

tests (eTable 2). Of the 324,033 symptomatic tested individuals, 53,270 (16.4%) tested positive

220

for SARS-CoV-2 and 21,272 (6.6%) had received ≥1 dose of mRNA vaccine. Among test-

221

positive cases, 2,479 (4.7%) were hospitalized or died.

222
223

Test-positive cases were more likely to be male; more likely to reside in Peel Region or Toronto;

224

more likely to have had zero SARS-CoV-2 tests during the 3 months prior to the vaccination

225

program; less likely to have received an influenza vaccine; and more likely to reside in

226

neighbourhoods with lower income, more persons per dwelling, and greater proportions of

227

essential workers and visible minorities (Table 1). Vaccinated individuals were older; less likely

228

to be male; more likely to have had multiple SARS-CoV-2 tests during the 3 months prior to the

229

vaccination program; more likely to have a comorbidity; and more likely to have received an

230

influenza vaccine. Compared to recipients of mRNA-1273 vaccine, recipients of BNT162b2

231

vaccine were younger, more likely to be female, and less likely to have a comorbidity (eTable

232

3). Most individuals (77% for BNT162b2, 76% for mRNA-1273) had received only 1 dose by

233

the index date.

234
235

Against symptomatic infection, adjusted VE (aVE) ≥14 days after receiving only 1 dose was

236

60% (95%CI, 57–64%). This increased from 48% (95%CI, 41–54%) at 14–20 days to a plateau

237

of 71% (95%CI, 63–78%) at 35–41 days (Figure 1, eTable 4). We observed a 16% increase in

238

risk of symptomatic infection 7-13 days after a first dose (aVE -16%; 95%CI, -26% to -6%).

239

aVE ≥7 days after receiving 2 doses was 91% (95%CI, 89–93%). Against severe outcomes of

240

hospitalization or death, aVE ≥14 days after receiving 1 dose was 70% (95%CI, 60–77%),

increasing from 62% (95%CI, 44–75%) at 14–20 days to 91% (95%CI, 73–97%) at ≥35 days,

242

whereas aVE ≥7 days after receiving 2 doses was 98% (95%CI, 88–100%) (Figure 2, eTable 4).

243
244

In subgroup analyses of VE against symptomatic infection, we observed higher aVE ≥14 days

245

after receiving only 1 dose with mRNA-1273 than BNT162b2, for younger adults than adults

246

aged ≥70 years, for individuals with no comorbidities than for those with comorbidities, and

247

against the earlier variant and B.1.1.7 than B.1.351 or P.1 (though 95% confidence intervals for

248

aVE for variants overlapped) (Figure 3a, eTable 5). However, aVE estimates ≥7 days after

249

receiving 2 doses were high (all ≥88%) and comparable across all subgroups, including against

250

E484K-positive variants. Against severe outcomes, we observed higher aVE ≥14 days after

251

receiving 1 dose for younger adults aged 16-39 years, but aVE estimates ≥0 days after receiving

252

2 doses were mostly similar across subgroups (Figure 3b, eTable 6).

253
254

Among adults ≥70 years, VE against symptomatic infection after 1 dose increased to 64%

255

(95%CI 46–76%) at 28–34 days and 85% (95%CI 38–97%) at 42–48 days, whereas comparable

256

VE estimates were achieved sooner after 1 dose for younger adults (Figure 4, eTable 7). For

257

older adults, VE against severe outcomes was comparable at ≥35 days after 1 dose (93%;

258

95%CI, 71–98%) as after receiving 2 doses (97%; 95%CI, 86–99%).

DISCUSSION

261

We estimated very high (>90%) vaccine effectiveness of mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and

262

mRNA-1273 against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with full vaccination (i.e., ≥7 days

263

after receipt of a second dose), and moderate (~50-70%) VE with partial vaccination (i.e., ≥14

264

days after receipt of only a first dose). Estimates for both full and partial vaccination were

265

approximately 10% higher against hospitalization or death, and VE increased over time after a

266

first dose. In subgroup analyses, we observed lower VE against symptomatic infection after a

267

first dose for recipients of BNT162b2, adults aged ≥70 years, and individuals with comorbidities.

268

However, VE was consistently high across subgroups for fully vaccinated individuals, and also

269

for older adults after longer intervals following receipt of a first dose. We also noted a slightly

270

increased risk of symptomatic infection on days 7-13 after a first dose, compared to no

271

vaccination.

272
273

Our findings for fully vaccinated individuals are comparable with clinical trial efficacy estimates

274

and other real-world effectiveness estimates reported in a range of settings.15-25 Existing evidence

275

estimating one-dose effectiveness from observational studies is heterogeneous,20,22,24-26 with

276

estimates for symptomatic infection ranging from 57% (95%CI, 50–63%)22 to 72% (95%CI, 58–

277

86%)25 and post-hoc calculations from efficacy trials approximately 90%.27,28 There is similar

278

heterogeneity among one-dose effectiveness estimates in older adults,18,26,29 with estimates

279

generally lower for older adults after the first dose,22,26 and increasing with time. Our analysis

280

identified an effectiveness against symptomatic infection of 63% (95%CI, 40–72%) ≥49 days

281

after only the first dose, in keeping with several other studies reporting one-dose

282

effectiveness.22,24 Our analysis also reflects extant evidence that effectiveness increases to very

283

high levels after the second dose, including in older adults.22 Our finding that receipt of 2 doses

284

of mRNA vaccines was not associated with appreciable vaccine escape by lineage B.1.1.7 or

285

E484K-positive variants (i.e., B.1.351 and P.1) is notable.

287

The increased risk of infection 7-13 days after receiving the vaccine could be due to an increase

288

in SARS-CoV-2 exposures shortly prior to, during, or after vaccination. Individuals may be

289

incubating at the time of vaccination, they may be exposed due to inadequate infection

290

prevention and control measures at (or when travelling to/from) vaccination clinics, or they may

291

assume protection immediately following vaccination and engage in higher risk behaviours

292

before a sufficient immune response has developed. Future studies should evaluate the

293

effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures in vaccination clinics and examine the

294

potential role of behavioural changes post first dose of COVID-19 vaccines.

295
296

Our study had some limitations. First, our study sample was limited to those with COVID-19

297

symptoms recorded in OLIS. Not all laboratories in Ontario currently have the information

298

technology infrastructure to submit symptom information recorded on the SARS-CoV-2

299

laboratory requisition into OLIS. Thus, the generalizability of our findings to the broader

300

population is uncertain. In addition, COVID-19 vaccination status is now collected on the

301

laboratory requisition. This may introduce selection bias and underestimate the true VE estimate

302

if symptoms were more likely to be documented on requisition forms for vaccinated individuals

303

who ultimately test positive for SARS-CoV-2, for example. Traditional test-negative design

304

studies collect vaccination status among all individuals with symptoms consistent with the

305

pathogen under study, to minimize this selection bias. However, the congruence of our findings

306

for fully vaccinated individuals with extant studies provides some reassurance that any under- or

307

overestimation of VE is likely to be small. Second, because symptom onset date is largely

308

unavailable in OLIS and CCM only has information on test-positive cases, we used specimen

309

collection date as the index date. This may have led to classifying some individuals into an

15

310

incorrect dose-to-index date interval, because their symptom onset would have been several days

311

prior to getting tested, leading to underestimation of VE during earlier intervals. Furthermore, we

312

could not limit the study population to individuals tested within 10 days of symptom onset, a

313

commonly used inclusion criterion for test-negative studies. Prolonging the interval between

314

symptom onset and testing increases the likelihood of false-negative cases, which lowers VE

315

estimates. However, 89% of cases with both symptom onset and specimen collection date

316

documented in CCM (not the source of symptom data for this study) were tested within 10 days

317

of symptom onset. Third, our results may have been impacted by outcome misclassification of

318

severe outcomes due to unlinked case records and incomplete capture of severe outcomes in

319

CCM, and delays in identifying hospitalizations in DAD (which are dependent on individuals

320

being discharged) and deaths in RPDB. Fourth, some of our covariates may be subject to

321

measurement error. We used frequency of previous SARS-CoV-2 tests as a proxy to identify

322

individuals at higher risk of exposure (and increased likelihood to be targeted for early

323

vaccination). However, we did not include point-of-care tests because they are incompletely

324

captured in OLIS. Furthermore, since access to testing is variable, we might not have adequately

325

controlled for this concept. Finally, we may not have adequately accounted for confounding bias

326

with the covariates that were available in the study databases.

327
328

Our findings suggest that older individuals and those with comorbidities may benefit from risk-

329

based recommendations to minimize second-dose delays. However, rising protection against

330

severe outcomes – arguably the more important outcome – with increasing time after a first dose

331

provides support for delaying the second dose. Mathematical modelling could be conducted to

332

demonstrate how, particularly for jurisdictions with limited vaccine supply, vaccines should be

333

distributed to maximize population protection (e.g., the relative benefits of providing second

334

doses earlier to older populations versus providing more first doses to younger populations who

335

respond better to a single dose and leading to more rapid achievement of herd immunity by

336

maximizing coverage with 1 dose). Since VE against symptomatic infection after 1 dose is only

337

moderate, and among older adults appears to be modest even at 14–20 days, individuals need to

338

be informed that besides the absence of benefit during the first 2 weeks (and likely longer for

339

older adults) after a first dose, they should continue to adhere to recommended public health

340

measures, such as mask-wearing, physical distancing, and avoidance of social gatherings.

Comorbidities include chronic respiratory diseases, chronic heart diseases, hypertension, diabetes, immunocompromising conditions due to underlying diseases or therapy, autoimmune diseases, chronic kidney disease,
advanced liver disease, dementia/frailty and history of stroke or transient ischemic attack.
e
Neighbourhood income quintile has variable cut-off values in each city/Census area to account for cost of living. A dissemination area (DA) being in quintile 1 means it is among the lowest 20% of DAs in its city by income.
f
Percentage of people in the area working in the following occupations: sales and service occupations; trades, transport and equipment operators and related occupations; natural resources, agriculture, and related production
occupations; and occupations in manufacturing and utilities. Census counts for people are randomly rounded up or down to the nearest number divisible by 5, which causes some minor imprecision.
