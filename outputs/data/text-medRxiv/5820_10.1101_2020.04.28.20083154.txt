Abstract
We present a computational model of workflow in the hospital during a pandemic. The
objective is to assist management in anticipating the load of each care unit, such as the
ICU, or ordering supplies, such as personal protective equipment, but also to retrieve
key parameters that measure the performance of the health system facing a new crisis.
The model was fitted with good accuracy to France’s data set that gives information on
hospitalized patients and is provided online by the French government. The goal of this
work is both practical in offering hospital management a tool to deal with the present
crisis of COVID-19 and offering a conceptual illustration of the benefit of computational
science during a pandemic.

Introduction

1

During a pandemic, such as the one of the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19,
management of patient flow and hospital resources are pushed to their limits: Hospital
Emergency Treatment Facilities through intermediate care unit (IMU) and intensive
care unit (ICU) are or are going to be be severely strained. Healthcare professionals are
often times forced to make difficult decisions in patient care and resource allocation.
Patient profiles might be out of the ordinary routine of the hospital and workflow must
be different. End-to-end on demand visibility with identification of real constraints is
needed for the senior management.
A manager may have simple but essential questions such as: how many beds do I
need on the floor, how many beds are available in the critical care unit, how much
supplies should be ordered to take care of our patients and protect our staff from
infection, how long will the facility have to work at maximum capacity, is there enough
staff to hold this workload long enough, are we doing well with patient outcomes, etc.
Multiple governmental and private agencies have focused on creating dashboards for
easy access and understanding of global pandemic data. These applications are great to
give the general assessment of the pandemic but do not allow a projection of detailed
information at the local hospital scale that is necessary to optimize the management of
patient workflow.
There is a significant amount of literature about mathematical models in
epidemiology that provide a rigorous framework to make predictions on the number of

people who are going to be symptomatic enough to require hospitalization. This
approach has been quickly applied to COVID-19 with success [20, 25]. In the case of the
COVID-19 pandemic, it is particularly difficult because large bodies of infected people
are asymptomatic. Consequently, the basic reproduction number R0 factor of
COVID-19 is still under active debate.
On the hospital workflow side, while there is a large amount of work on this
topic [23], one of the difficulties is to asses the death rate of patients hospitalized at the
beginning of the pandemic because the Length of stay (LOS) is rather long and the
disease is still not well understood [2, 16, 26]. Every hospital has to adapt to the new
crisis as it arrives, so clinical practice may vary greatly from one institution to another.
A number of guidelines and great reports have been quickly edited to support the heath
community, but it takes time to standardize the healthcare process [3, 5, 13, 24].
Our goal in the paper was to come up with a simple and robust mathematical
framework that is easy to use and that supports the management of the patient
workflow during a pandemic. Such a model should operate on a relatively limited data
set that reports daily on the number of patients admitted for hospitalization, patient
output of the facility (such as number of patients healed per day or number of deaths
per day), and at minimum the number of patients staying in the most critical unit of
the facility - the ICU. The model can then be customized to the local hospital system
with an optimization technique to achieve calibration after a few weeks of data
acquisition. Much more can be done with the patient electronic records that detail
patient comorbidities and chronic conditions, provided that the disease of the pandemic
is well understood.
We have used a Markov process description of the workflow’s graph with probability
governing the patient transition from one care unit to another, as well as a simple
statistical model of patient LOS at each stage. We will show that with a minimum
number of parameters used to fit on the time series listed above for a period of a few
weeks, one may start to assemble the information needed to assist the senior
management in getting answers and identifying real constraints to reduce speculation or
misallocation of resources.
This work is our first iteration to achieve a very ambitious goal: as data becomes
available, the quality and level of detail of modeling should keep improving to achieve
better results. It is our hope that such an effort, among many others, will once again
prove how much digital health can benefit from computational science to improve
patient care.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our method to construct the
model and details the choices we made to work with the data set on hand; Section 3
gives the main results and solution to our initial goal in supporting management;
Section 4 discusses the benefit and limitation of our method and concludes with further
potential development.

Because of the sparsity of data available to construct a predictive model during a
pandemic crisis, we are going to use a very simple model that reproduces the workflow
of Table 1. Let’s start with a brief description of standard patient workflow - see Figure
1 - with respect to disease progression - see Figure 2.
The patient moves from one care unit to another according to his/her condition.
The first two steps are registration and diagnostics, which in principle should be a
relatively quick process. For the patients who stay in the hospital because their health
condition justifies a longer stay, they are first put in a ward unit for further assessment
and treatment. This step is where a number of medical imaging steps start involving

Meanwhile, significant biological lab work starts to grade the patient’s condition more
precisely and continues during the patient’s stay. These resources, i.e. imaging and lab
work, are typically shared by all patients in the hospital and therefore may slow down
the process. For simplicity and in the absence of adequate data set for validation, we
neglect these constraints. Some of the patients who receive medical attention do well
with conservative management only and can be discharged home after a few days. But
for others, their health condition may deteriorate and those patients will need to be
moved to the IMU for higher level of care and/or to transfer to the ICU for ongoing
monitoring and mechanical ventilation. The IMU and ICU require extensive supplies
and resources. It is often mentioned that the number of available ventilators is critical
to ICU functions. However, it is not the only limiting factor: patients under mechanical
ventilation need sedation and might be connected to a number of additional systems to
deal with organ failures. Once again for simplicity and because of the lack of input data,
our model will not take into account these bottlenecks. There are no technical

difficulties required to add those constraints in the mathematical model with our
bottom up description of the workflow as in [10, 15]. Additional steps can be recovery
for patient being well or unfortunately palliative care when the patient is not responsive
to treatment. There are many exceptions and singularities to these standard paths: for
example, a patient may go directly from admission to the ICU when their condition is
too unstable. In some hospitals, the floor might be shared by patients who are
recovering from COVID-19 and palliative care patients.Despite this, we will separate
these functional units in our model to clarify the workflow process according to what
each patient stage requires in terms of resources and time to deliver adequate care. To
summarize, a simple workflow graph is created and the main requirement is to know (i)
the probability that a patient goes from one care unit to another and (ii) a statistical
estimate of how long the patient should stay in each care unit before moving on.

Our model follows a Markov process for (i): there is a probability associated with
each branch of the graph summarized in Table 1. With respect to (ii), we use a
lognormal distribution that can be reconstructed from the parameters listed in Table 2
and Table 3. This simple framework allows us to construct a generic model that
dynamically computes the number of patients for each care unit as a function of the
number of patients showing up in the ER. In particular, we get a time series of the
number of patients staying in the ICU, which is the most critical care unit in term of
resource allocation, as well as the number of patient outputs, such as the number of
patient healed and discharged per day, or the number of death(s). These time series can
be fitted to existing data the hospital obtains during a period of a few weeks prior to
retrieving the performance parameters of Table 1. Once the model is calibrated, it can
be used to extrapolate the load of each care unit in the next few days and anticipate the
need of staff and supplies - see Table 4.

This discrete model is stochastic, so one needs to run many simulations to build a
statistical estimate of such quantities. It is appropriate to retrieve the unknown
parameters of the model using a form of stochastic optimization method, such as genetic
algorithm, since the model workflow process, like the one in the hospital, is discrete,
noisy, and nonlinear.

Let us describe the data set we are using to construct our model. The French
government has kindly decided to release the records of most public hospitals around
the country during the COVID19 crisis. From this excel file, we can easily recover the
number of patients staying in hospitals, the number of patients in ICU, the number of
patients healed and discharged, and the number of patients dying in a medical
institution. Those numbers are updated daily and go back to March 18, 2020 [27]. We
will extensively use this French Data Set (FDS) to identify the missing parameters of
our model.
The number of parameters of our model is relatively large: about one parameter for
each branch of the graph minus the number of nodes for (i) and two parameters for the
log distribution of (ii) in each care unit. To avoid over-fitting, one should come up with
a strategy that lowers the number of unknown based either on literature or hypothesis
that can be validated otherwise. We are going to describe thereafter the rationale for
our choices to the best of our knowledge and further discuss some of the limitations of
our model in Section 4.
First of all, a lognormal distribution of the duration of each step of the process
might be justified as follows. Biological process, such as incubation and recovery, are
often described as such [18, 19]. First, the patient’s condition is indeed dominated by
his/her biological time. Second, medical procedures with their associated time lag and
delay are also often best described as lognormal processes [10, 22] with a long tail. This
is not in contradiction with the fact that patient LOS in the hospital may not ideally be
described by a simple exponential distribution or similar. Overall, LOS adds up the
time distribution of each step in a Markov process and might be described at the
convolution of the probability distribution of each step [14].
Now let’s review the parameters of Table 1 that gives the probability transition from
one unit to another, in order to rationalize the construction of our generic model. One
can first list the following constraints assuming that all possible paths are exhaustively

listed in the workflow of Figure 1, so we have:

144

α2 + α3 + α4 = 1, α5 + α6 + α7 = 1, α8 + α9 = 1, α10 + α11 = 1, α12 + α13 = 1. (1)
Overall, the death rate and recovery rate of patients who are staying in the hospital
should be within an acceptable limit. Technically, the death rate of hospitalized patients
is:

145
146
147

βd = α2 α6 α8 + α2 α6 α9 α10 + α2 α5 + α4 α8 + α4 α9 α10 .
Similarly, the recovery rate of hospitalized patients βh = 1 − βd is:

148

βh = α3 + α2 α6 α9 α11 + α2 α7 + α4 α9 α11
βd is difficult to asses with a pandemic that just started. As a matter of fact, most
infected patients are still in the hospital and their outcome may not be clear. We look
thereafter for some lower and upper bounds of βd that limits our search.
According to the Intensive Care National Audit & Research Center (ICNARC)
report of March 27, 2020 [28], we may conclude that a lower bound to overall death of
patients admitted into ICU units is about 10% - as a matter of fact most patients were
still in the hospital at this early stage. On the other hand, and based on a very small
case series in the Seattle region [1], the death rate was up to 50%, but in this study
most patients had chronic medical conditions. These two publications illustrate the
difficulty of recovering the true rate of death for today’s large population whom have
been hospitalized, mostly due to the heterogeneity of the population they encompass.
In France, as of April 17, 2019, the number of deaths in hospitals was 11,842
patients and recovered was 35,983 patients [27]. Assuming that the proportion of death
versus recovery will be about the same for the patients who are still ill, the death rate of
hospitalized patients should be around 25%. Finally, according to [26], an early estimate
of the death rate for hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China based on a case series of 191
patients was 54/191 = 28%.
We restrict ourselves to the model matching the FDS to a [10%, 40%] death rate
interval, that is:
0.1 ≤ βd = α2 α6 α8 + α2 α6 α9 α10 + α2 α5 + α4 α8 + α4 α9 α10 ≤ 0.4.

There are also few parameters in Table 1 that should have near to no limited effect
on statistics when matching our model to FDS. FDS is based on hospitalized patients,
so α1 cannot be recovered from this data set. According to FDS, about 30% of patients
who show up at the emergency room (ER) are returning home [27]. We will choose
α1 = 0.3.

According to several reports including the ICNARC one mentioned above, it is
expected that the number of patients dying in ICU is about 50%. [6] provides much
further details on the probability of survival of patients with ARDS under mechanical
ventilator as a function of the day of the start. It shows that about 25% of the patients
in ICU die during the first few days from severe complications. We will introduce an
artificial two phases ICU decomposition of the patient stay in the ICU to bypass the
limitation of a single lognormal distribution that may not represent an adequate model
of LOS in this unit according to [6] clinical studies: a short phase one with mortality
driven by α8 and a longer phase 2 with mortality driven by α10 .
Consequently, we will assume that:
α8 ∈ (0.1, 0.3), and α10 ∈ (0.4, 0.6).

According to Dr. M. Mueller [29], 25% of the patients who are not responsive to
treatment may leave palliative care alive and are discharged home. This may vary
depending on each country or hospital policy. Because patients with COVID-19 in
palliative care are still very contagious, we will assume they stay in the hospital until
the end. We will choose α12 = 0., for all our calculations.
To sum up, our model essentially needs the calibration of 6 parameters, namely

under the set of constraints (1), (2), (3).
Let us denote F admission (jd) the number of patients admitted per day jd ∈ 1..N in
the hospital who have a positive diagnosis and must stay in the hospital. We will use
this time series as an input to our model simulation in order to calibrate the model
against the FDS.
Let us denote (FsICU (jd), Fshealing (jd), Fsdeath (jd)) the time series of patients in the
ICU, patients healed and discharged home, and patients who died per day jd ∈ 1..N
obtained from the simulation output. We will denote respectively

We find A as the solution of the minimization problem of the weighted norm:

where Fs is the mean of a large number of runs of the model. This number of runs is
set large enough to let the solution of the optimization problem be independent of it.
As mentioned above, we will use a genetic algorithm to solve that minimization problem.
The weight factor (γ1 , γ2 , γ3 ) in (4) can be set equal or unequal to favor the quality of
the fitting for one of the variables, such as the number of patients in the ICU that is
critical to management.
Table 2 and 3 give the time window we used for each transient stage. We construct a
lognormal distribution of duration for the patient stay in such a way that about 90% of
the patients’ stay will be within a coarse approximation [P, Q] listed in these tables.
The choice of the parameters in Table 2 and Table 3 might be easier to come up with.
One of the most remarkable features is that patients with COVID-19 who stay in the
ICU can be longer than usual [1]. The LOS in palliative care was set according to Dr.
M. Mueller’s data [29]. We have used extensively [2, 26], as well as the feedback from
clinicians in the field to estimate the interval of variation for the parameters [P, Q] the
best we could. We used a fairly large interval since it can be observed that the standard
deviation for LOS in each care unit is large as described in this report from the Imperial
College London COVID-19 Response Team [30]. One may fine tune the interval value
[P, Q] if needed in the fitting process of the model to the data set of time series available.
To distinguish those unknown parameters that are important from those who are
less significant, we run linear sensitivity analysis for each of our results. This method is
used to confirm that the time window parameters of Table 2 and Table 3 have a
secondary effect on the quality of the model fitting.
Finally, we derive from our model some predictions on staffing and supplies for the
next week or so, as well as the load foreseen for each care unit. The nature of the
stochastic simulation automatically gives an uncertainty estimate on these predictions
that increases as time grows. To compute supplies such as personal protection kits, we
can use some adaptation of the reference of the CDC web site [31] that was constructed
for Ebola. Our software can then be used to feed the stock management scheme
implemented by CDC for COVID-19 [32]. In this paper, we use a growth estimate of
two personal protective equipment (PPE) per shift and per staff member for simplicity.

Similarly, we have listed in Table 4 a gross approximation of the number of nurses
and staff per bed site in each unit. Those figures are depending on the crisis situation
and might differ depending on the country [5].
In order to take into account the fact that staff and supplies are limited and require
hard management choices during a pandemic crisis, we tested the model further against
the scenario of a shortage on nurses who are essential in intensive care units. To
introduce a risk factor due to the shortage of nurses, we have extrapolated from [9]
and [8], a scenario where a 40% shortage of nurses results in:

228
229
230
231
232
233
234
235

• Time spent on floor increases by 15%

236

• Chances of transition from floor to Recovery or floor to IMU decreases by 15%

237

• Chance of dying in ICU increases by 15%

238

To get a continuous approximation, we assume that the shortage of nurses has a linear
effect, and use linear interpolation for shortages from 0% to 40% maximum. This is
certainly a gross approximation, but we felt that it was important to bring awareness to
those effects with a simulation tool. We will present in the next section our results.

Let us first report on the model fitting with the FDS. We sum up the number of
admissions, patients in ICU, number of recoveries and deaths for the whole country of
France in order to get a robust data set that averages the noise of the data. We
calibrated the model to this largest data set that covers the period 3/18/20 to 4/11/20
and found a death rate of about 25%. This result is in agreement with the estimate we
did in Section 2, as of April 17, 2019 [27].

We observed that the number of patient admissions is not a smooth curve. Typically,
Sunday’s have less activity with less patients discharged than weekdays. However, the
model fitting seems adequate and robust to a small variation of parameters. The logic
on the influence of parameters is simple, α2 being the one who is most important for all
output. Each of the six parameters seems to have some significant influence for at least

one of the three outputs.
This is not completely surprising because the construction of the model was subject
to a number of experimentations and trial errors by way of simulations before getting
what we found: a model with low complexity that makes the fitting feasible.
The curve of the number of patients under mechanical ventilation is smooth as
expected because this care unit has by far the longest LOS. Consequently, the system
has a lot of delays and the relatively small number of patients per day who have been
healed or died is still relatively small. Similarly, the number of patients who are
mechanically ventilated does not directly reflect the number of admissions at the early
stages of the pandemic in the FDS.
For some unknown reasons to us, the model overestimates the number of patient
deaths in the last few days. Those numbers might be small however and more sensitive
to singular events or simply involve delay in reporting. It might also be the
accumulation effect of the small lag differences of the prediction of patients under
mechanical ventilation and the reality.
In order to compare the results obtained with designated subset of the FDS that
corresponds to the hospital in Paris and the hospitals in Alsace, we used the simulation
with the exact same set of parameters found for the data set with the whole country.
Alsace has been the busiest cluster at the beginning of the pandemic, followed later on
by Paris and Ile de France. The results for Alsace are reported in Figure 6 and Figure 7.
We observed a fairly large difference of the model’s prediction on the number of patients
under mechanical ventilation. It seems that at the peak of the pandemic in Alsace, the
number of patients under mechanical ventilation was less in reality than in the model.
One possible factor would be the shortage of available beds in the ICU. On the other
hand, the number of deaths did not go higher than significantly expected. A better
explanation might be the fact that a fairly large number of patients in critical condition
were transferred to hospitals in different parts of the country or neighboring countries:
according to local newspaper more than 110 patients from Alsace have been
transferred [33]. This seems coherent with our results: the scaling factor for the Alsace
data set to get a maximum hospitalization rate of about 50 patients per day is 6; the
overshoot on the ICU prediction is about 20 in Figure 6; The total maximum overshoot
is therefore about 120; considering that the average LOS in ICU (see Table 1) is roughly
12 days, our model still seems to give an adequate approximation. But unfortunately,
we do not have enough information to add this new patient path in the workflow of
Figure 1.
This phenomena is less present in the results for the data set with Paris but are still
there - see Figure 8 and Figure 9. One can indeed refine the parameter fitting to be
specific for Alsace and Paris in order to reflect that the clinical decision process in the
workflow, i.e parameters of Table 1 to 3, might be sensitive to how much the local
system is under stress, but we should then take into account those number of
transferred patients that are not negligible.
Next, let us describe the use of our model to assist daily management in the hospital
during the pandemic. One key factor is to anticipate the load of each care unit and
required resources, either to match the increase in number of patients or to reallocate
resources to other patients who have seen their surgery postponed.
We choose a hypothetical scenario that might occur if confinement conditions to
contain the pandemic are lifted too early. We assume that the hospital has a nominal
low flux of patients from week 1 to 7, and a recurrence with a daily 20% increase of new
patients coming in occurs in week 8. Figure 10 shows the dynamic of the load of each
care unit, in particular the large delay in the number of patients in the ICU that
becomes saturated the latest. The black curves are a simulation of the previous week’s
load (week 7), while red curves are the prediction for the following week (week 8). The

the uncertainty of the estimate. This uncertainty grows as the time of the prediction
gets further away. The cyan curve shows an hypothetical capacity of each care unit: the
floor gets saturated first and needs new beds after a few days.
As an illustration of the capability of the model, Figure 10 and Figure 11 provide an
estimate of the growth of resources needed to face the new patient wave. A number of
decisions should be made in regards to patient care. Figure 12 compares the patient

output with or without shortage of nurses. Those results are speculative since it is
difficult to quantify the risk for patients beyond the nice publication results of [9]
and [8]. It is our hope that data accumulated during crises such as the present episode
of COVID-19 will give the mathematical modeling the base to do this estimate
rigorously in future work.
Finally taking a step further, we have looked at the prediction of the model to check
either the effect of confinement policy on pandemics or new pandemics with an
arbitrary rate of transmission of the disease. There are many epidemiological

mathematical models available, even for the present crisis, see [25] and [26]. It might be
difficult to assess the basic reproduction number R0 factor, which is under active debate.
It is probably even more difficult to assess the exact impact of global confinement or
targeted confinement on those parameters that characterized the pandemic model.
We should however be able to use our model to test if the effect on the most critical
resource, such as ICU beds and delay in care, are linearly or nonlinearly related to those
parameters.
Let us use the most simplistic ordinary differential equation epidemiology model:

where S is the population of susceptible individuals, and I is the population of
infected individuals. ρ1 is the transmission rate of the disease, and ρ2 represents the
addition of the rate of recovery over infection and the disease induced death.
The function I(t) is used as the input of our workflow model, and represents the
number of patients admitted to the hospital. We test the influence of the transmission
rate on the number of ICU beds over a 16-week period. Figure 13 shows that the
maximum number of ICU beds required during the epidemic is significantly higher when

the transmission rate increases from 0.0015 to 0.0025, while the average number of ICU

management problem and the benefit of a confinement method that lowers the
transmission rate during a pandemic.

Discussion and Conclusion

n this work, we have developed a simple computational model to mimic the workflow of
an average hospital during a pandemic crisis, such as COVID-19 where patient
admission goes up to 50 patients per day. This is a significant load for any hospital
system because all patients suffer from the same disease and cannot be triaged using the
existing departmental structure. The hospital system needs to recruit resources quickly
enough to deliver quality patient care while keeping the staff safe from infection.
There are many ways of developing such a mathematical model. We chose a Markov
process that can augment a workflow graph provided by the clinicians and used a simple
statistical model for the LOS of the patient at each stage corresponding to a graph node.
A number of variations in the model construction are available: for example, changing
the probability distribution of LOS for specific stages with a more sophisticated model
than lognormal or decomposing the graph nodes into subgraphs of the workflow with
more details. In particular, the ICU supports different paths of medical care depending
on patient conditions. Because of the sparsity of data on hand, we kept the model as
simple as possible and we were able to fit the French Data Set with good accuracy.
Using this approach, we could:
• recover important parameters that are characteristics of the workflow such as the
probability for a patient to transition from one unit to another, and important
patient outcomes such as healing rate or death rate.

• on a pragmatic side, we use the model to assist the senior manager in answering
his/her questions as listed in our introduction: how many beds do I need on the
floor, how is this affecting patient outcomes, do we need to transfer patients to a
different facility, etc.?
There are a number of limitations to our approach. The smaller the hospital, the less
predictable the outcome will be. With time, the characteristics of the population of
patients who show up to the ER may change and the pandemic management by the
governing organizations would evolve. One can think, for example, that systematic
testing would provide early diagnostics and impact the performance of the health
system as shown by the statistics of countries who were early adopters of that strategy.
Due to the heterogeneity of the patient population and disease patterns that depend
heavily on patient characteristics, our next step in improving this model would be to
include patients’ medical history listed in the electronic medical record.
Above all, any model of workflow especially during a pandemic should be aware of
the Human Factor. Staff can get sick or burnout during a pandemic and there should
be a number of strategies to compute that risk and enter this into the constraints
imposed on the health care system [4, 11, 12, 21]. Further, human behavior and decision
process changes under stress: it can be for economical or psychological reasons. The
future of computational models in digital health during a pandemic crisis should
extensively include sociological and economical modeling components in the matter.
