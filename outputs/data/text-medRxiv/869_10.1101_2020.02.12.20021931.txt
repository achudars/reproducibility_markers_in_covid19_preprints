ABSTRACT
Background. The epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019-nCoV is of great interest to
researches because of the high rate of spread of the infection and the significant number of
fatalities. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already
interested in the questions of the duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients and
deaths. For long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need
many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. In this article, some
preliminary estimates will be presented.

Objective. Since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to
predict the epidemic characteristics only in this area. We will estimate some of the epidemic
characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and removed
persons versus time.
Methods. In this study we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic, the known
exact solution of the linear equations and statistical approach developed before for investigation of
the children disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988-1989.

Results. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical
approach. The numbers of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time were predicted.

Conclusions. Simple mathematical model was used to predict the characteristics of the epidemic

INTRODUCTION
Here, we consider the development of epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019-nCoV
(see e.g., [1-3]). Since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try
to predict the number of victims V of this virus only in this area. The first estimations of V
exponential growth, typical for the initial stages of every epidemic (see e.g., [4]) have been done in
[3]. For long time predictions, more complicated mathematical models are necessary. For example,
a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model was used in [2]. Nevertheless, the
complicated models need more efforts for unknown parameters identification. This procedure may
be especially difficult, if reliable data are limited.
In this study, we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic [4-8] To the
parameter identification, we will use the exact solution of the SIR set of linear equations and
statistical approach developed in [4]. These methods were applied for investigation of the children
disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988-1989. We will estimate some of the
epidemic characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and
removed persons versus time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data
We shall analyze the daily data for the number of confirmed cases in mainland China,
which origins from China National Health Commission [1]. We show in the table Table 1 the
corresponding time moments tj from 0 to 24 and the number of victims Vj (confirmed cumulative
cases of coronavirus 2019-nCoV infection), which were used for calculations. Table 1 shows that
the precise time of the epidemic beginning t0 is unknown. Therefore, the optimization procedures
have to determine the optimal value of this parameter as well as for other parameters of SIR model.

Exact solution of SIR-equations
The SIR-model for an infectious disease can be written as follows, [6,7]:

S   SI

(1)

I   SI   I

(2)

R   I

(3)

The number of susceptible persons is S, infected - I, removed -R; the infection and immunization
rates are  and  respectively. Since S  I  R  0 (see, Eqs. (1-3)), the sum N  S  I  R must
be constant for all moments of time and can be treated as the amount on susceptible persons before
the outbreak of an epidemic, since I  R  0 at t  t0 . It must be noted that the constant N is not the
volume of population Ntotal , but only the initial number if people sensitive and not protected to
some specific disease. In particular, the ratio N / Ntotal may be rather small. For example, the
number of people on the board of Diamond Princess is 3711, and the number of confirmed cases is
70 (February 10, 20200). It means that the percentage of susceptible can be estimated by 1.89%.
To determine the initial conditions for the set of equations (1-3), let us suppose that

I (t0 )  1 , R(t0 )  0 , S (t0 )  N  1

(4)

It follows from (1) and (2) that

dI 
 1 ,
dS S






(5)

Integration of (5) with the initial conditions (4) yields:

I   ln S  S  N  ln( N  1)

(6)

Function I has a maximum at S   and tends to zero at intinity, see [6, 7]. In comparison, the
number of susceptible persons at infinity S  0 , and can be calculated with the use of (6) from a
non-linear equation

S  ( N  1)e

S  N



(7)

In [4] the equations (1-3) were solved by introducing the function V (t )  I (t )  R(t ) ,
corresponding to the number of victims. The integration of corresponding equation:

V   SI   ( N  V )  ln( N  V )  V  ln( N  1)

(8)

yields:

t

F1 (V , N , )   t0



( N  U )  ( N  U )  U  ln( N  1)

F1  

(10)

Thus, for every set of parameters N,  ,  , t0 and a fixed value of V the integral (10) can be
calculated and the corresponding moment of time can be determined from (9). Then I can be
calculated from (6) by putting S=N-V and function R from R=V-I.

Statistical approach for parameter identification. Linear regression
As in paper [4], we shall use the fact that the random function F1 (V , N , ) has a linear distribution
with (see (9)). Then we can apply the linear regression (see [9]) for every pair of parameters N and

 and the corresponding values of t0 and  . The optimal (the most reliable) values of N and 
correspond to the maximum value of the correlation coefficient r (see [4]).

RESULTS

The optimal values of parameters were calculated:
N=90611;  =65546.5;  =1.477985357571669e-05; t0 = -7.720998173432072.
The corresponding correlation coefficient is very high r=0.997966487046645. The solution of (7)
yields the value S = 45579. The corresponding number of infected I, susceptible S and removed R
persons versus time (starting from January 16, 2020) were calculated and shown in Fig. 1. The blue
line represent the number of victims V=I+R and is in good agreement with confirmed number of
victims V=I+R (blue markers, see [1]).

Time in days (starting from January 16, 2020)

Fig. 1. Numbers of infected I (green line), susceptible S (red line) and removed R (black line)
persons versus time in days (starting from January 16, 2020). The blue line represents the number of
victims V=I+R . Blue markers show the confirmed number of victims, reported by China National
Health Commission [1].

DISCUSSION

The obtained value of the correlation coefficient if very close to unit 1. This fact can make the
results rather reliable. Nevertheless, this the value of r is very close to the optimal one
r=0.997966487046645 for the values of parameters located in the vicinity of the optimal point
N=90611;  =65546.5, since the maximum of regression coefficient at this point is not sharp. This
fact can question the procedure of the parameter identification. The calculations must be refreshed
after obtaining new data.
Another weak feature of the method is connected with the fact that the estimation of
susceptible persons, who are still present in the population S  N  V =45579, is very large. It
means that these persons can couch the infection. Such situation needs additional analysis, in
particular, with the use of more complicated models (see, e.g., [10]).

CONCLUSIONS

Simple mathematical model was used to predict the characteristics of the epidemic caused by
coronavirus 2019-nCoV in mainland China. The further research should focus on updating the
predictions with the use of fresh data and using more complicated mathematical models.
