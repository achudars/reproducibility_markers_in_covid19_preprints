Abstract
The task of identification of randomly scattered ’bad’ items in a fixed set
of objects is a frequent one, and there are many ways to deal with it. ’Group
testing’ (GT) refers to the testing strategy aiming to effectively replace the
inspection of single objects by the inspection of groups spanning more than
one object. First announced by Dorfman in 1943, the methodology has
underwent vigorous development, and though many related research still
takes place, the ground ideas remain the same. In the present paper, we
revisit two classical GT algorithms: the Dorfman’s algorithm and the halving
algorithm. Our fresh treatment of the latter and expository comparison of
the two is devoted to dissemination of GT ideas which are so important in
the current COVID-19 induced pandemic situation.
Keywords: Group testing; Quick Sort algorithm; COVID-19.

Introduction

The task of identification of bad items in a given set of objects arises quite often.
For example, consider identification of: a) the infected patients in a fixed cohort;
or b) the defective items in the production batch. Usually, this identification task
is a composite problem and spans many subtasks. One of such subtasks can be
described as ’an efficient utilization of resources devoted to testing of investigated
objects’. It turns out that, among plenitude of context dependent methods designed for the solution of this subtask, the appropriately chosen testing plan plays

an exceptional role since it alone can reduce the testing costs substantially. This is
the contextual target of the present paper. To be more precise, we focus on testing
strategies widely known under the name of Group (or Pooled Sample) Testing (in
what follows, we make use of an abbreviation GT). The core idea underlying GT
strategy is an observation that, in many cases, the testing of single items can be
replaced by the testing of a group spanning more than one item. Though it is
difficult to trace back the exact date and inventor of this cornerstone idea (for a
good historical account see [13], Ch. 1), without doubt much of the credit goes to
the pioneering work of Dorfman [12]. In that paper, the Blood Testing problem
was described and the following scheme was suggested. Given N individual blood
samples, pool them and test for the presence of an infection in the pooled sample;
in case of the negative test – finish; in case of the positive test – retest each single
patient. The rationale behind is clear: if the prevalence of the infection is low, one
usually ends up with a single test applied to the pool instead of N tests applied
individually.
Since appearance of Dorfman’s work [12] in 1943, GT ideas were evolving in
many directions and found important applications in molecular biology, quality
control, computer science and other fields. Digging into the literature, one can
observe that it is indeed very widespread across different disciplines. Because of
this reason, some developments were overlapping and rediscovered by researchers
working in the different fields. Our personal familiarity with the field also underwent this route: attracted by potential applications in the context of COVID-19
epidemics, we have rediscovered some well known facts. Nonetheless, the attained
experience and understanding of the importance of the tool inspired us to write a
promotional paper on the topic. This is the main intent of the paper: we believe
that, in the current pandemic situation, the spread of GT ideas and attraction
of other researchers to the field is an important and meaningful task. We do not
propose novel GT schemes or methodological improvements. Our presentation is
primarily devoted to those unfamiliar with the subject aiming to provide a quick
lightweight introduction ’by example’ without delving into details yet giving a
flavor of the topic as a whole. Choosing a mathematical journal we, first of all, were
interested in the dissemination within the mathematically oriented community.
Secondly, while getting familiar with the topic, we have encountered a lot of papers
where the subject was treated without sufficient mathematical rigorousness. We
therefore felt that our rigorous treatment of the GT Scheme H (see Section 2),
unseen (or at least unobserved) by us, was a missing item in the existing literature.
Finally, after submission of the initial version of the paper, we have discovered that
our Proposition 2.2 adds some new information to what is known about classical
Dorfman’s scheme (see the comments in Section 2).
The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
provide some preliminaries, then describe and contrast two classical GT schemes.
In Section 3, we give an accompanying discussion highlighting some relevant issues
and skim through the related literature. Appendices A and B contain some
mathematical derivations and tables.

Two classical GT schemes

Consider the following setup. Assume that the prevalence of some disease (the
fraction of the infected individuals) is equal to p ∈ (0, 1) in an infinite (or large
enough) population. A cohort spanning N independent individuals has to be
tested and infected patients have to be identified. To achieve the goal, samples
are collected from each individual. The applied test performs equally well for
individual and for pooled samples: a situation might occur, e.g., when the test
indicates the presence of the infection in the blood sample and there is no difference
whether the latter is obtained from a single individual or from a pooled cohort
of samples. For the situation described, physicians can choose different testing
strategies. Let us assume that the following are three possible choices† .
Scheme A: Test each patient’s sample.
Scheme D: Conduct testing of the pooled sample. Test each member of the
cohort separately only in case of detected infection in the pooled sample.
Scheme H:
Step 1. Test pooled sample of the whole cohort. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2. If the test is positive, proceed to Step 3, otherwise, finish testing cohort.
Step 3. Divide the cohort into two parts consisting of the first and second halves
respectively. Apply the whole algorithm to the two obtained parts recursively.
Although it is not obvious at the first glance, schemes D and H can be much
more efficient as compared to A provided prevalence p is low enough. To give a
rigorous justification (along with the concept of efficiency), let us formally define
the underlying model.
Consider the sample of N individuals. Put Xi = 1, provided the test of i-th
individual is positive, and Xi = 0, otherwise. Let S = SN = X1 + · · · + XN be the
total number of infected individuals in the sample and let T = TN be the total
number of tests applied to the cohort.
We start with the scheme D. The test is applied once if the result is negative,
and it is further applied to each of N individuals otherwise, i.e.
T

= 1 + N · 1{S > 0}.

The above implies that X1 , . . . , XN are independent identically distributed (i.i.d.)
random variables each having Bernoulli distribution Be(p). Therefore, S has the
† The notations for a short reference of GT schemes come from Dorfman (D); Halving (H).
A reflects the most naive and straightforward option.

hence, can be easily solved iteratively. It is further not difficult to prove that,
for p in the region enclosing (0, 0.2), there exists a unique solution Np > 0 of (3)
which is a minimizer of t(N ) (see Proposition 2.2 below). Then, turning back to
economic/biomedical interpretation, we conclude that, having a cohort of bNp c
(here and in the sequel, byc stands for an integer part of y ∈ R) individuals,
Scheme D results in a lowest average number of tests per person which is possible
when applying scheme of this type for a population having prevalence p. Scheme
A, in contrast, always has a constant number of tests 1 per person. Therefore, an
average (absolute) gain attained applying Scheme D instead of Scheme A is given
by the difference

Right panel in Figure 1 shows the graph of p 7→ 100Gp , p ∈ (0, 0.2), which is
an average gain measured by the number of tests saved per 100 individuals. The
corresponding values are provided in Table 1 (see Appendix B). An accompanying
graph of p 7→ Np (see the left panel of the Figure 1) demonstrates dependence of
an optimal sample size on p. To obtain a fast numerical evidence, assume that N
is bounded away from zero and pN → 0. Then from (3) it follows that the optimal
sample size satisfies

Hence, assuming that p is small enough for pN ≈ 0 to hold, the above implies that
√
Gp ≈ 1 − 2 p.
For example, if p = 0.01, then we have Gp ≈ 0.8, i.e. an approximate average gain
is 80% or so.
Now let us switch to the Scheme H. Its main features are summarized in the
following proposition (for the proof see Appendix A).

Hence, for q ≈ 1 (or alternatively p ≈ 0), t(∞) < 1. The latter means that, when
the prevalence is low, this scheme always outperforms common sequential Scheme
A. Again, to gain a quick quantitative insight, assume that p is small enough for
pN ≈ 0 to hold. Then turning to (iii) and taking a ’continuous’ (undiscretized)

Therefore, an approximation to an average gain Gp = 1 − t(Np ) is 1 + 2p log2 p.
Taking, e.g., p = 0.01 results in G0.01 ≈ 0.867. Considering analogous example
given for Scheme D, we see that the gain has an increase close to 7%. In fact, this
is not surprising (for a visual comparison of Schemes D and H on the linear and
the log-log scales, see Figure 1, and, for the numerical one, Table 1 and Table 2 in
√
√
Appendix B) since, for Scheme D, we had Gp ≈ 1 − 2 p and p log2 p/ p → 0 as
p → 0. Equality (6), however, exhibits some magic flavor. To see this, note that,
for p ≈ 0, entropy Ip of X ∼ Be(p) is asymptotically equivalent to p log2 p since
Ip

= p log2 p + (1 − p) log2 (1 − p) = p log2 p − p(1 − p) + o(p)
= p log2 p(1 + o(1)).

Consequently, (6) means that the optimal average number of tests per one individual scales like entropy of the prevalence of the infection. Keeping in a
view the above relationship, it is not surprising that the significant number of
works ([8], [19], [1]) have approached the testing problem from the Information
Theory perspective. In the next section we provide additional comments regarding
connections with the Information Theory. Here we end up with the previously
mentioned Proposition 2.2, which is proved in Appendix A.

Proposition 2.2. Let p ∈ A := (0, 1−e−4/e ) be fixed. Consider function gp (N ) =
g(N ) = q −N/2 (ln(1/q))−1/2 , N > 0. It admits a unique fixed point Np which
minimizes t(N ) given by (2).
The above proposition can be viewed as a counterpart of Proposition 2.1. Note,
that it does not contain analytical expression of an optimal sample size. The
latter was given by Samuels [35] and is either 1 + bp−1/2 c or 2 + bp−1/2 c. Of
most importance is that Samuels [35] not only provided the analytical expression
of the optimal sample size but has also shown that, for the case of Scheme D, the
optimal sample size equals to 1 for p > 1 − (1/3)1/3 ≈ 0.31. This, in turn, is in
agreement√with the fundamental fact of the GT theory discovered by Ungar [42]:
if p ≥ 3−2 5 ≈ 0.38, then there does not exist an algorithm that is better than
individual one-by-one testing.
An interesting detail here is that our proof given in Appendix A differs from
that of Samuels and leads to an exact analytical expression for the range of p (the
set A above), where gp (N ) has a unique minimizer.

Discussion

Since its appearance, the Dorfman’s Scheme D was rigorously investigated by
many authors (we refer to [40], [39], [23], [35] to name a few). Talking about
Scheme H, the situation is a bit different. To our best knowledge, the reference
[46] is the only work close to ours both in nature of investigations and results.
However, in that paper, the authors focus on the treatment of an asymptotic
regime of Scheme H when p → 0. Majority of other references encountered by
us provide instructions suitable for the practical application of Scheme H with
a brief and nonrigorous theoretical background. For example, in the present
context, it was currently afresh discussed by Gollier and Gossner [18], Mentus
et al. [29] and Shani-Narkiss et al. [37]. For an older reference discussing the
case of nonhomogeneous population (i.e., the one in which the probability of being
infected p may vary across individuals) and containing quite a large body of applied
literature on halving algorithm (i.e., Scheme H) we refer to [4].
One should have noticed that halving, constituting the core of the Scheme
H, yields another link to the Information and Algorithm Theory in addition to
the one already mentioned‡ in Section 2. Namely, in its essence, the Scheme H is
nothing more than the Quick Sort (QS) algorithm designed to sort a set containing
keys of two types (bad and good ones). It is well known that QS yields the best
(up to the constant multiple) possible average performance among comparisonbased algorithms: to sort an array having N non-constant (i.e., random) items,
the smallest average number of comparisons is of the order N ln N [10], and all
‡ the discussed appearance of entropy in formula (6), in fact, is a simple conclusion following
from Shannon’s Coding Theory; a bit more on the connections with that theory can be found in
the Appendix H of the Supplementary Material of the reference [27]

randomized ’divide-and-conquer’ type algorithms (with QS being one among the
rest) have expected time asymptotically equivalent to QS, which randomly splits
sorted set into two equal subsets [11]. Our formula (5) is just a confirmation
of the well known fact. To see this, note that, in the context of sorting task,
(5) presents an average number of comparisons per item. Though the order is

correct, we are inclined to think that the multiplier 0

can be improved by making use of QS modification (or another comparison-based
algorithm) designed to sort items with a small number of possible values (in our
case, there are just two values: ’sick’ and ’healthy’). On the other hand, as already
mentioned above, the order is optimal since though there are algorithms which
can beat QS when sorting integers, e.g., [2], [41], they operate under different, i.e.,
noncomparison-based, mode. In our case, however, comparison is predefined by
the setting of the problem at hand: we assume that biomedical tests can only be
carried out by making use of comparison.
Though biomedical context is very frequent in applications, there are many
others including engineering, environmental sciences, information theory, etc. (see
[32], [21], [22], [30], [26], [15], [24], [28], [25], [6]). This ’real life’ contextual diversity
brings many constraints to take into account despite the fact that the standard
binomial setting, considered in Section 2, quite often can be regarded as a good
starting approximation. To get a full understanding of the matter touched, below
is a shortlist of key issues with a brief description of each.
• Heterogeneity of population. The prevalence of disease may depend
on other factors (e.g., age and gender).
• Imperfectness of the test. The test can have sensitivity and/or specificity below 1.
• Dilution effect. Pooling can reduce testing accuracy substantially. If
this is the case, it is necessary to impose upper bound on the number of
pooled samples.
• Implementation costs. In Section 2, we silently assumed that implementation of the considered schemes only involves retesting related costs.
However, it may involve others as well.
• Dependence. It can happen that tested individuals are somehow related.
All these underpinnings have to be addressed carefully. Take, for example, the
last one. From results presented in Section 2, one can infer that the application
of the GT procedures is most effective when the prevalence is low (p ≈ 0). In
such case, under classical assumption pN → λ > 0, the number of infected
individuals SN can be well approximated by the Poisson distribution Pois(pN ),
and the approximation remains quite accurate irrespectively of the nature of the
dependence exhibited by summands (see [7], [43], [3] and references therein for

results of this kind with possible extensions beyond the classical setting). It is
therefore reasonable to assume that, after switching to Poisson approximation,
at least some of the existing schemes can be carried over to the dependent case.
Clearly, additional restrictions call for new theoretical investigations.
The set of directions of such investigations can be significantly appended by
including other methods and GT related tasks. More concretely, the schemes
considered in Section 2 broadly fall into the class of probabilistic GT schemes.
Another widely adopted paradigm is called combinatorial approach. Within its
framework, one does not assume any random mechanism and tries to make use
of combinatorial methods in order to identify d bad items in the given group of
N ≥ d objects (see monographs [13], [14]). Speaking about tasks, up to now, we
have focused only on the identification of bad items (or infected patients) under
assumption that the prevalence p is known. In addition to the literature devoted
to this task, there is a huge body of literature dealing with an estimation (both
point and interval) of p from pooled samples observations as well as testing issues
(see, e.g., [34], [16], [20] and references therein).
We hope that our discussion complies well with our initial goal stated in the
introduction. To emphasize the relevance of similar promotional discussions in the
present context, we point out a huge burst of papers devoted to similar problems
(see, e.g., [5], [17], [31], [33], [36], [38], [44], [45]). Besides that, we also note that
some countries have already successfully applied pooling methodology for testing
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.§

Clearly, q 2N ↓ 0 as N → ∞. Therefore, there exist no more than two Np ∈ N such
that ∆n ≤ 0 for all N ≤ Np and ∆n ≥ 0 for all N ≥ Np , and t(Np ) attains its
minimal value at Np . To find Np , we first solve 1 − 2q 2N = 0 with respect to N ,
and then choose from the two nearest integers (i.e., bN c, bN c + 1) the one which
minimizes tN .

Then derivative f 0 (N ) = 1−e2N/v / v = 0 which is equivalent to N = (v ln

Note that f 0 (N ) → −∞ as N → ∞. Moreover, f 0 (0) > 0 since 1 − (1/ v) > 0

and f (N ) → −∞. Consequently, f has two zeroes: Np ∈ (0, Nmax ) and N
(Nmax , ∞). The latter means that g has two fixed points.
Step 2 (minimizer). In this step, we show that Np from Step 1 is the minimizer
for t(N ) given in (2). By (3),

From Step 1 (see (11)) it follows that Nmax /(v/2) = ln v > 1, i.e. v/2 ∈ √

Therefore, (12) holds if and only if f (v/2) > 0. The latter reads as (v −e v)/2 > 0

and is equivalent to p < 1 − e−4/e showing that Np (being the critical point of
t) is indeed the announced minimizer. Finally, note that the above analysis also
ep from Step 1 is the maximizer of t(N ) which affirms the uniqueness

Remark A.2. One can also show that p 7→ Np is strictly decreasing and continuous
on A. However, the latter properties seem to be of less importance and we omit
the details.

Appendix. Tables

In the tables below, the following information is provided:
• Column ’Np ’ shows an optimal sample size corresponding to p ranging in an
interval given in the column ’Range of p’.
• Column ’Range of 100Gp ’ shows an average gain (as defined in the main body
of the paper) per 100 individuals corresponding to values of p and Np given
in the two leading columns. The highest gain corresponds to the lowest p in
the corresponding interval. For example, in Table 1, the first line should be
interpreted as follows: for p ∈ [0.1865, 0.2000], optimal sample size Np is equal
to 2; if p = 0.2000, then average gain per 100 individuals 100Gp is equal to
16.1782; if p = 0.1865, then 100Gp = 14.000; for intermediate values of p, the
value of 100Gp lies in [14.0000, 16.1782].
