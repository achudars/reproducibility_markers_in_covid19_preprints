Abstract
Successful public health regimes for COVID‐19 push below unity long‐term global Rt –the average number
of secondary cases caused by an infectious individual. Most assessments use local information.
Populations differ in Rt, amongst themselves and over time. We use a SIR model for two populations to
make the conceptual point that even if each locality averages Rt < 1, the overall epidemic can still grow,
provided these populations have asynchronous variation in transmission, and are coupled by movement
of infectious individuals. This emergent effect in pandemic dynamics instantiates “Parrondo’s Paradox,” ‐‐
an entity comprised of distinct but interacting units can behave qualitatively differently than each part on
its own. For effective COVID‐19 disease mitigation strategies, it is critical that infectious individuals
moving among locations be identified and quarantined. This does not warrant indiscriminate prevention
of movement, but rather rational, targeted testing and national coordination.

Introduction
“… we're a large country that has outbreaks in different regions, different states,
different cities, that have different dynamics, and different phases…”, (Dr.
Anthony Fauci, quoted on CNN, 23 April 2020).
To control COVID-19, public health policy must drive the average effective net
reproduction number (Rt: the average number of secondary cases produced by
transmission from a primary case at time t) below unity. Yet this statement applies
globally. Local governments (e.g., states) craft policies based on local trends. In the
USA (versus say New Zealand), policies are not coordinated across polities (e.g., states),
and local control efforts wax and wane over time. New York (for instance) surges while
Florida does not, but later this pattern flips, generating repeated waves of outbreaks
varying among locations.
Tragically, spatial and temporal heterogeneity, coupled with movement of
infectious individuals, can maintain global average Rt > 1, despite average Rt < 1 in all
populations. This counterintuitive effect instantiates “Parrondo’s Paradox,” which
describes how the behavior of complex systems with multiple interacting parts can differ
qualitatively from the behavior of any single part (1). Parrondo’s Paradox occurs in
population ecology (2-4), as well as physical, biological and financial systems (1, 5, 6) –
but has not received attention in epidemiology. We illustrate the potential for this
Paradox in the pandemic using a model (see Materials and Methods) which, though
simple, captures essential elements of more complex, realistic models. We demonstrate
that infectious individuals moving among locations with identical – but out of phase –
temporal variation in transmission, sufficient for local control of COVID-19 when those
locations are isolated, can drive global spread.
Results
Figure 1 shows two typical scenarios where the disease cycles due to changing
transmission rates, but nonetheless declines in each population when isolated (local r̅ < 0;
average Rt < 1). Without movement, the disease disappears. With movement and
synchronous changes in transmission, the same holds (Fig. 1a,c). But with poor
coordination across populations (viz., asynchrony), the disease spreads (Fig. 1b,d).
Merely changing the relative timing of local control reverses global outcomes. Either
synchrony or no movement between populations is sufficient for periodic enactment of
social distancing policies to drive the disease extinct. However, with movement and
asynchrony, these policies fail.
Movement and asynchrony cause long-term harm when combined, as illustrated
in Figure 2. Model parameters are conservative with respect to estimates of SARS-CoV-2
dynamics (7-9) (see Materials and Methods). Deaths, total cases, and peak case numbers
increase with movement and asymmetry (Fig. 2a-c), with potentially devastating
consequences. For example, increasing movement from 0.1% to 0.5% for mostly
asynchronous populations increases cases and deaths nearly an order of magnitude (light
green curve, Ω = 0.75; Fig. 2c).

The synergistic effects of movement and asynchrony emerge quickly in an
epidemic. Disparities between a scenario with low movement and asynchrony (dotted
lines, Fig. 2d-f) and one with moderate movement and asynchrony (solid lines, Fig. 2d-f)
accumulate early on, with substantial human, economic, and public health impacts.
Discussion
We suggest a version of Parrondo’s Paradox could arise in the current pandemic.
While spatial processes are increasingly recognized as critical in epidemiological theory
(e.g., the evolution of resistance by nosocomial pathogens, (10)), as is temporal variation
in disease transmission (e.g., fluctuations in Rt driven by social factors such as conflict
(11)), their combined effect is underappreciated. Together, spatial and temporal processes
can have powerful and surprising effects on disease dynamics, with devastating
consequences. This result requires only two conditions: 1) disease management
strategies in different populations do not coincide in time, and 2) some infectious
individuals move between populations. Restricting movement among populations and
increasing coordination can reduce disease impacts.
Our goal is to illustrate a qualitative effect, not predict specific disease outcomes;
many real-world complexities need consideration for concrete application of our insights
to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., (7-9)). However, we expect the qualitative effect
pertains to realistic scenarios, as known for Parrondo effects in spatial population
ecology (4).
Our findings suggest integrated policy actions at regional, national, and global
scales:
1) Intensify mitigation locally (reduce r̅ and prolong social distancing).
2) Coordinate strategies (synchronize the timing of lockdown and re-opening).
3) Reduce movement of infectious individuals.
The impact of these actions is contextual, because their dynamical effects are intertwined.
Assessing the potential for Parrondo’s Paradox to affect the COVID-19 pandemic using
realistic, spatially structured, and necessarily complex epidemiological models (12), we
believe, should be carried out, and soon. A holistic, multi-regional and dynamical
perspective is absolutely essential for effective control of this pandemic.

Si, Ii, and Ri are local susceptible, infectious, and recovered individuals, respectively
(local population size is Ni, assumed 5 million for i = A,B). βi(t) = transmission rate, γi(t)

where ri(t) = Niβi(t) – γi(t) – μ is the local instantaneous per-capita rate of change in the
infectious class without movement [note Ri(t) = Niβi(t)/(γi(t) + μ)]. Ii increases for ri(t) > 0
(Rt > 1) and declines for ri(t) < 0 (Rt < 1). We assume square-wave alternation in ri(t)
between high and low values, with period T (assumed 60 days; Fig. 1). Growth is positive
(rN > 0) for half the period (N denotes “normal,” with typical contact patterns) and
negative (rS < 0) otherwise (S indicates “social distancing,” with reduced contact),
resembling shifts in policy and behavior. Change in I over each cycle follows r̅ = (rN +
rS)/2; importantly, we assume temporal mean r̅ i is negative. Populations only differ in
timing of switches between states, with asynchrony Ω defined as the fraction of time rA(t)
≠ rB(t) (0 ≤ Ω ≤ 1).
Parameter values for normal (and empirical estimates for reference) are (for
normal and social distancing states, respectively): βN = 0.1988 and 0.0288 day-1 (0.351.12, ref (8)), γ = 0.098 and 0.128 day-1 (0.29, ref (8); 0.07, ref (9)), and μ = 0.002 (0.04;
ref (9)). Thus, rN = 0.0988 (0.17-0.23, ref (7)), rS = -0.1012, and r̅ i = -0.0012. Case
doubling time is ln(2)/rN = 7.02 days (3-4 days, ref (7)) and case halving time is ln(1/2)/rS
= 6.85 days. Rt = 1.988 and 0.2215 for rN and rS, respectively (2.4-4, refs (7-9)).
Simulating dynamics
We numerically solved the model (eq.1) in Matlab 2019b. All simulations began
with 5 infections in each population. The infectious class grew exponentially for 20 days
at rA = rB = rN to simulate disease emergence and then square-wave cycling began. To
evaluate long-term dynamics, we simulated dynamics for 100 cycles.
Measuring Epidemiological Outcomes
Cumulative case numbers, cumulative deaths, and prevalence were calculated
from numerical solutions to the model. We estimated peak prevalence (maximum value
of IA(t) + IB(t)) by solving equation (1) over 2,000 evenly spaced time units per cycle (i.e.,
every 0.03 days). Cumulative cases each time step are ∑i={A,B}Ni – Si(t), and cumulative

deaths are ∑i={A,B}Ni–[Si(t)+Ii(t)+Ri(t)]. Movement follows a Poisson-point process with
rate m, implying the probability of moving in one timestep is 1 – exp(–m).
