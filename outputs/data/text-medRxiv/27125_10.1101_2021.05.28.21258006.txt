Key points
Question: What is the psychological impact among patients and their healthcare workers during
the COVID-19 pandemic?
Findings: In this observational study based on PSS 10 and DASS 21 questionnaire that included
156 patients and 226 health care workers, the patients in the age group 41-50 with respiratory
tract symptoms and those who were home isolated/quarantined experienced a greater tendency of
mental health problems. Similar burden was observed among health care workers.
Meaning: In a COVID-19 pandemic both population groups displayed higher levels of fear,
anxiety, stress, and depression.

ABSTRACT
Background
Disease pandemics are known to cause psychological distress. The ensuing mental health issues
are not only restricted to the patients and their relatives/friends but affect the healthcare workers
(HCWs) as well. Our study aims to assess these psychological trends during the COVID-19
pandemic between the two most affected population groups, that is, patients and frontline
healthcare workers.
Methods
A survey questionnaire including scales to assess fear, anxiety, stress, depression - PSS 10, and
DASS 21 was distributed and sent to all COVID-19 suspected/confirmed individuals and
healthcare workers at a tertiary care center along with a second visit after 14 days of answering

the first questionnaire and this continued as follow up. Data were analyzed with the SPSS
Version 23 using various tests of significance.
Results
In the community, COVID-19 patients in the age group 41-50 with respiratory tract symptoms
and those who were home isolated/quarantined experienced a greater tendency of mental health
problems. Healthcare workers posted in COVID-19 designated areas of the hospital displayed
higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.
Conclusion
The high degree of uncertainty associated with novel pathogens has a profound effect on the
psychological state of suspected/confirmed cases as well as healthcare workers. Within the
community, individuals suspected of having COVID-19 display a significant mental health
burden, while HCWs also experience an unprecedented amount of stress during such enduring
situations.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus has spread across borders in a small-time affecting the world (1) and was
announced to be a pandemic by WHO in March 2020 (2). The Coronavirus 19 initially appeared
as a spurt of respiratory infections in Hubei city, China in December 2019. Widespread
outbreaks are known to cause psychological distress and mental illnesses (3). Humanity has
suffered in the hands of many such bio-disasters such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

(SARS), Flu, Plague, Ebola, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), among others,
with each of them promulgating a certain level of fear and mental stress among frontline workers
and the affected population.
The effect on the community of the COVID-19 pandemic is also evident in studies. Ni et al.
conducted a cross-sectional web-based study and found that among the 1577 community-based
adults who participated in the study, about one-fifth of respondents reported probable anxiety
(n=376, 23.84%, 95% CI 21.8-26.0) and probable depression (n=303, 19.21%, 95% CI 17.321.2). Within the community as well, patients afflicted with COVID-19 manifested higher levels
of mental health burden. A gender effect was observed in the score of "Perceived Helplessness",
the subscale of PSS-10, with female patients showing higher scores compared to male patients,
female, and male controls (4). Even among clinically stable COVID-19 patients, the prevalence
of significant posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with COVID-19 was 96.2% (95% CI
94.8–97.6%) in a study (5). Nyuyen and colleagues assessed the level of depression in
outpatients in Vietnam and interestingly witnessed that people with college/university or above
educational attainment had higher odds of depression than those with elementary school/illiterate
attainment. In addition, in comparison to people who had a low social status, were less healthy,
had less physical activity, to those with middle or high social status, healthier, and had more
physical activity had lower odds of depression (6).
These mental issues are not only restricted to patients and their close ones, but healthcare
workers (HCWs) are also not immune to the stress caused by the spread of the disease (7). The
high degree of uncertainty associated with novel pathogens has a profound effect on the
psychological state of HCWs working at the forefront. HCWs experience an unprecedented
amount of stress during such enduring situations. The extended and frequent changing shift times

and risk of infection add to the pressure faced by these workers. The inability to effectively
communicate while wearing personal protective equipment and poor performance of diagnostic
procedures play a key role in the emergence of resentment in the minds of these brave warriors.
A cross-sectional survey-based study during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that depression,
anxiety, insomnia, and distress were widely prevalent among HCWs (8). Another study among
HCWs (non-medical vs medical HCWs) revealed a higher prevalence with statistical
significance of insomnia (38.4% vs. 30.5%), anxiety (13.0% vs. 8.5%), depression (12.2 vs.
9.5%), somatisation (1.6% vs. 0.4%), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (5.3% vs. 2.2%) (9).
Our study emphasizes these psychological trends during the pandemic among the two most
affected population groups, that is, the patient and contacts along with their treating frontline
HCWs. Therefore, we aimed to study the psychological parameters of these two population
groups in a tertiary care COVID-19 hospital.
Objective: To assess the mental impact of 2019 novel coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreaks among
COVID-19 patients (suspects and confirmed), their close contacts, and associated healthcare
providers using a questionnaire-based study
Materials and Methodology
Settings and participants
The research was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in North India between March and
November 2020. A structured questionnaire was distributed electronically to all participants. The
study was conducted in compliance with the protocol and ethical approval was obtained from the
institutional ethical committee (CTRI/2020/05/025494). Before taking the survey, the
respondents signed a consent document stating that they had provided their informed written

consent. There were no benefits, and participation was on an opt-in voluntary basis at the
COVID-19 screening outpatient department. Data security and anonymity were ensured.
Inclusion criteria:
•

All COVID-19 suspected/confirmed patients and high-risk contacts (family and friends)
reporting screening of OPD in a tertiary care hospital between March and November
2020

•

All healthcare workers directly or indirectly related [treating or managing these patients]

Exclusion criteria:
•

Patients/subjects who did not consent

•

Patients/subjects below the age of 18.

Procedure/intervention
An online Google form was created for the questionnaire (Appendix 1 and 2) comprising PSS
(Perceived Stress Scale) and DASS 21 (Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale) questionnaire.
After procuring their phone number through hospital record within 24h of OPD visit, participants
were contacted through WhatsApp or direct messaging or phone calls and instructed to properly
read the consent form and questionnaire, after which they were provided the link for the form to
be filled.
PSS -The “PSS” suggested by Cohen et al. in 1983 measures the degree to which individual
situations are evaluated as being stressful or more precisely, unpredictable, uncontrollable, and
intense (overloading in 1983, then overwhelming in 1991). The tool is composed of 14 items on
a five-point scale (going from “never” to “often”) (examples of items: “...have you ever been

bothered by an unexpected event?” “... have you ever successfully coped with little problems and
daily worries?”) (10).
DASS 21 - This was designed to measure emotional distress in three sub-categories (Lovibond
and Lovibond, 1995) of depression (e.g. loss of self-esteem/incentives and depressed mood),
anxiety (e.g. fear and anticipation of negative events), and stress (e.g. persistent state of overarousal and low frustration tolerance). It is a self-reported questionnaire with 21 items (seven
items for each category). To calculate comparable scores with full DASS, each 7-item scale was
multiplied by two. Participants were asked to rate how many of each of the items (in the form of
statements) applied to them over the past days, using a five-point scale (completely disagree to
completely agree) (11).
Comparator and Outcome:
There was no comparator, and the outcomes were measures of fear, anxiety, stress, and
depression among the participants.
Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using the latest version of SPSS software (Version 23). Fisher’s exact test
and the chi-square test were used to correlate the association. The Stuart-Maxwell test was used
to assess the change in response in the HCW population between the first point of contact and
follow-up. Statistical significance was set at a P-value <0.05.

Results
Of the 708 COVID-19 patients (suspects/confirmed/contacts) and 442 HCWs, 156 and 226
participants were responded to the questionnaire respectively.

FEAR:
Individuals with no travel history had a greater degree of fear (Fig. 1A). A certain level of fear of
contracting the disease from HCWs was also prevalent in the general population. Fear of death
due to COVID-19 infection was significantly greater in the age group of 51-60 years whereas
those in the 41–50-year age group had a higher incidence of bad dreams and nightmares.

STRESS:
Greater stress levels were observed among subjects who were home isolated or quarantined
juxtaposed to those who were not (Fig. 3A). Participants with acute respiratory symptoms
reported stress in the form of trembling. Subjects in the age group 41-50 predominantly
complained of feeling nervous, worried in certain situations of panic, tendency to overreact,
inability to control things in life, inability to overcome difficulties in daily life, and coping with
things. Higher levels of stress were noted in subjects with a history of travel to areas with
ongoing community transmission. These individuals reported an inability to control important
things in life, as well as the stress of unemployment during or after the disease. Those who
visited the hospital reported stress in the form of trembling. The month of June noticed a high

proportion of subjects who reported being upset due to things happening unexpectedly, inability
to overcome difficulties in daily life, and anger at things being outside their control. A significant
number of individuals complained of agitation in March as the lockdown phase began.

Participants with symptoms of acute respiratory infection reported worthlessness (Fig. 4A).
Those between the ages of and 41-50 complained of a feeling of nothing to look forward to, and
a lack of enthusiasm. Subjects with a history of close contact with a positive case reported
feeling downhearted and blue. A lack of initiative to do things was noted among subjects who
were home isolated or quarantined. The month of June witnessed the highest number of subjects
feeling worthless and nothing to look forward to, while participants in May had a significantly
higher incidence of lack of initiative to do things.

ANXIETY:
A significant number of subjects had a history of acute respiratory symptoms, and 14.4% of
subjects reported dryness of the mouth (Fig. 2B). Palpitation, tremors, feeling scared without any
reason, and tendency to panic was reported by HCWs who were working in designated COVID
wards. HCWs with a history of contact with a COVID positive/suspect case claimed that they
experienced dryness of their mouth, felt scared without any reason, and were close to panic.

STRESS:
HCWs with acute respiratory symptoms reported significant incapability to cope with things and
were unable to control their irritability (Fig. 3B). HCWs working in COVID-19 positive/suspect
wards felt they were using a lot of nervous energy and found themselves getting agitated. Among
the various categories of HCWs, nurses had the highest incidence of feeling rather touchy, while
professors had the least. Residents reported feeling a lot of anger when things were out of control.
Some positivity and optimism were noted among HCWs who felt they were following all
necessary precautions and they felt things were going their way during the pandemic, while
HCWs who reported not following precautions found it difficult to control their irritabilities in
life. Those who were not sure if they were taking steps for prevention often felt angered about

things being out of their control. Female HCWs had a higher proportion of feeling hard to relax
juxtaposed to their male counterparts. HCWs with a history of contact with a positive case had a
higher incidence of feeling agitated, touchy, nervous, and stressed, and communicated with
difficulty in trying to wind down. Among those with a history of contact, higher levels of stress
were observed among HCWs who developed upper respiratory tract symptoms after exposure.

population
DEPRESSION:
A higher tendency of depression was observed in HCWs posted in COVID-19-positive/suspect
areas or with history contact with a positive/suspected case, as they described feeling
downhearted and blue with a lack of enthusiasm and having nothing to look forward to (Fig. 4B).

Of interest, those with no history of exposure to positive cases had a higher proportion of being
unable to experience any positive feeling at all. A greater incidence of lack of enthusiasm was
prevalent among male HCWs compared to their female counterparts.

population
Healthcare Workers (follow-up)
Although a large number of HCWs denied feeling depressed as a result of social abandonment
and had less trouble relaxing than at the time of the first contact, no statistically significant
variations in reaction to other psychological health criteria were observed.

In our research, we discovered that fear was found to be higher among people who had no
previous travel background, and the general public was afraid of catching the disease from
healthcare workers and vice versa. The fear of death was found to be higher in the 51-60 age
group, while nightmares were found to be higher in the 41-50 age group.
HCWs with respiratory symptoms or those working in the COVID-19 ward found it particularly
difficult to wind down, which caused great uncertainty and stigmatization for both staff and
patients (12). 18.3% of people were afraid of developing COVID-19 infection. Around half of
the HCWs said they were afraid of spreading the infection to their families and loved ones.
Anxiety was higher among those who were quarantined at home, with the most common
symptoms being shortness of breath, even when not exerted, and dry mouth. The isolated and
home quarantine populations had higher stress levels, which manifested as a proclivity to
overreact, failure to regulate emotions, nervousness, and trouble dealing with everyday life.
Nurses were the most stressed, while professors were the least stressed. Females HCWs had a
harder coping time than their male counterparts. Male HCWs were found to have a higher rate of
lack of enthusiasm than their female counterparts. HCWs who worked in COVID-19 designated
wards reported higher levels of stress, depression, and anxiety juxtaposed to their counterparts.
HCWs who had previous contact with a COVID positive/suspected case reported dry mouth,
feeling frightened for no apparent cause, and being on the verge of panic.
The symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression were observed in 28.9%
and 31.2% of respondents, respectively. In a previous study conducted during the SARS
pandemic, longer periods of quarantine were linked to an increased incidence of PTSD
symptoms (13). In contrast, in our study, a history of travel or unemployment was found to be
substantially correlated with these factors. The agitation parameter was found to be highest in

March and June 2020, that is, in the early months of the pandemic. The depression parameter
was highest in June and was linked to feelings of worthlessness and blueness among the
respondents, in contrast to a study where higher levels of depression were during the first few
weeks of the outbreak and the initial lockdown period i.e. March-April (14). These results can
also be linked to post-SARS 2003 outbreak findings, which showed that among SARS survivors,
the prevalence of post-recovery likely or clinician-diagnosed anxiety disorder, depressive
disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was 19%, 20%, and 28%, respectively (15).
These findings are in contrast with those of a similar report on HCWs and the psychological
effects of the SARS 2003 pandemic, which discovered that high-risk HCWs had elevated stress
levels. Despite their trust in infection-control measures, more high-risk HCWs recorded
exhaustion, poor sleep, concern about health, and fear of social interaction, which were not
significantly different from levels in low-risk HCWs control subjects (16).
A series of previous studies regarding the mental health impact of infectious disease pandemics
and outbreaks have been conducted, with the majority being during the SARS and influenza
pandemics of 2003 and 2009, respectively. One of these found a large range in prevalence rates
of mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, or
disorders, might be especially prominent among HCWs and survivors that are directly affected
by epidemics and face a real threat of infection and difficult circumstances such as
isolation/quarantine or difficult working conditions (18). Another study illustrated that a novel
deadly infectious disease, such as SARS, can cause significant prolonged psychiatric problems
(19). It has also been found that during the outbreak, SARS survivors among HCWs had stress
levels similar to those of non- HCWs; however, HCWs showed significantly higher stress levels
in 2004 and had higher depression, anxiety, posttraumatic symptoms, and GHQ-12 scores (20).

A similar study conducted again during the SARS pandemic found that HCWs reported
significantly more positive and more negative psychological effects from SARS than did control
subjects. HCWs declared confidence in infection-control measures (21). Looking at the patients’
side, another previous study found that general stress and negative psychological effects are
increased in SARS patients, particularly among infected HCWs (22).
Efficient preparation and support, the creation of material and emotional reserves, effective
leadership, and measures to ensure the well-being of HCWs and their families will be significant
motivators to come to work (23-24). Before SARS or another virulent disease breaks out, it is
important to think about how to better help HCWs through timely knowledge exchange, proper
infection prevention protocols, income protection during outbreaks, risk management for family
members, minimizing disruptions to other clinical services, and the degree of psychosocial
distress. In the case of a COVID-19 (SARS-CoV 2) pandemic, this could help to reduce staff
absenteeism and, as a result, hospital services would be less disrupted. They suggest that
psychological services could be important in the rehabilitation phase and should not be forgotten,
as we face the evolving new outbreak of COVID-19 virus. Our results highlight the need to
enhance HCWs’ preparedness and competence in detecting and managing the psychological
sequelae of future comparable infectious disease outbreaks. It has also shown higher levels of
PTSD-like symptoms in both the HCWs and COVID-19 survivor populations are prevalent. The
risk factor analysis can not only improve the detection of undiagnosed psychiatric complications
but also provide insight into a possible model of care delivery for COVID -19 survivors.
This study is limited by the collection of data over a long duration of time, and the varying trends
of the pandemic over the months may have caused a variation in psychological perception among
the participants. Also, there was attrition and many participants were lost to follow-up. The use

of self-reported questionnaires for fear and anxiety aspects may also be considered a drawback in
comparison to clinician-diagnosed psychological sequelae. However, the results provide
important insights for policymakers and healthcare professionals, involved in clinical work as
well as hospital administration, around the world while delineating the psychological sequelae of
life-threatening and fatal infectious disease outbreaks. It is imperative to understand that a
pandemic is bound to have long-term psychiatric sequelae and our work doesn't end with the
subsidence of the pandemic. The psychological sequelae may appear further with a delay as
delayed complications of covid-19 are yet to be recognized and understood.
Conclusion
Our study suggests that all the parameters ranging from fear, anxiety, stress, and depression were
significantly high compared to those experienced during the SARS 2003 outbreak, thus
emphasizing the psychological aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These results emphasize a
need for strong preparedness and readiness to counter the ongoing as well as any future
pandemics on mental beings. Our results also suggest significant psychological impact to both
patient as well as HCW population; thus warranting adequate prevention measures and ample
psychological support to these population groups. There is an immense amount of further
research and studies required in these domains in the future to obtain complete facts around the
pivotal aspects of the mental impact of any pandemics in history as well as in the future.
