Abstract
The reproduction number R and the growth rate r are critical epidemiological quantities.
They are linked by generation intervals, the time between infection and onward transmission.
Because generation intervals are difficult to observe, epidemiologists often substitute serial
intervals, the time between symptom onset in successive links in a transmission chain. Recent
studies suggest that such substitution biases estimates of R based on r. Here we explore how
these intervals vary over the course of an epidemic, and the implications for R estimation.
Forward-looking serial intervals, measuring time forward from symptom onset of an infector,
correctly describe the renewal process of symptomatic cases and therefore reliably link R
with r. In contrast, backward-looking intervals, which measure time backward, and intrinsic
intervals, which neglect population-level dynamics, give incorrect R estimates. Forwardlooking intervals are affected both by epidemic dynamics and by censoring, changing in
complex ways over the course of an epidemic. We present a heuristic method for addressing
biases that arise from neglecting changes in serial intervals. We apply the method to early (21
January – 8 February 2020) serial-interval-based estimates of R for the COVID-19 outbreak
in China outside Hubei province; using improperly defined serial intervals in this context
biases estimates of initial R by up to a factor of 2.6. This study demonstrates the importance
of early contact-tracing efforts and provides a framework for reassessing generation intervals,
serial intervals, and R estimates for COVID-19.

Significance Statement
The generation- and serial-interval distributions are key, but different, quantities in outbreak
analyses. Recent theoretical studies suggest that the two distributions give different estimates
of the reproduction number R as inferred from the observed exponential growth rate r.
Here, we show that estimating R based on r and the serial-interval distribution, when
defined from the correct reference time and cohort, gives the same estimate as using r and
the generation-interval distribution. We apply our framework to serial-interval data from
the COVID-19 outbreak in China, outside Hubei province (January 21–February 8, 2020),
revealing systematic biases in prior inference methods. Our study provides the theoretical
basis for practical changes to the principled use of serial interval distributions in estimating
R during epidemics.

Introduction

The reproduction number R is one of the most important characteristics of an emerging
epidemic, such as the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Majumder
and Mandl, 2020). The reproduction number is defined as the average number of secondary
cases caused by a primary case. The value in a fully susceptible population — the “basic”
reproduction number R0 — allows us to predict the extent to which an infection will spread
in the population, and the amount of intervention necessary to eliminate it in simple cases
(Anderson and May, 1991). Since the reproduction number represents an average (Diekmann
et al., 1990; Anderson and May, 1991), it fails to capture heterogeneity among individuals
or across space. The reproduction number also fails to provide any information about the
time scale of disease transmission.
Estimating the reproduction number R is often challenging. Direct estimates based on
observed infections will typically be biased down when some infections cannot be observed.
A common method of estimating R near the beginning of an epidemic is based on the
population-level exponential growth rate r, which can often be estimated robustly from case
reports (Mills et al., 2004; Ma et al., 2014). The growth rate r and the reproduction number
R are linked by the generation-interval distribution Wallinga and Lipsitch (2007), where the
generation interval is defined as the time between when an individual (infector) is infected
and when that individual infects another person (infectee) (Svensson, 2007).
Since generation intervals measure time between infection events, which can be difficult
to observe in practice, generation intervals are often replaced with serial intervals. The
serial interval is defined as the time between when an infector and an infectee develop
symptoms (Svensson, 2007). While generation and serial intervals both measure the time
scale of disease transmission, they measure fundamentally different quantities. In particular,
previous studies have noted that, in many contexts, serial intervals are expected to have larger
variances than generation intervals but have the same mean in many contexts (Svensson,
2007; Klinkenberg and Nishiura, 2011; te Beest et al., 2013; Champredon et al., 2018). Serial
intervals can in some cases even take negative values in the presence of presymptomatic
transmission (He et al., 2020), whereas generation intervals must be positive.
Although these distributions were clearly and distinctly defined over a decade ago (Svensson, 2007), the need for a better conceptual and theoretical framework for understanding
their differences is becoming clearer as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. Researchers continue to base inferences about COVID-19 on both generation and serial intervals without
clearly distinguishing between them (e.g., Abbott et al. (2020); Du et al. (2020); He et al.
(2020); Wu et al. (2020); Zhao et al. (2020)), and, in some cases, explicitly conflate the
definitions of the two intervals (e.g., Anderson et al. (2020); Hellewell et al. (2020)). This
confusion is apparent even in standard software for estimating R, such as EpiEstim, in which
the serial-interval distribution is used to infer time-dependent R (Thompson et al., 2019).
These studies are examples of many—indeed, it is a common practice to use the serial and
generation intervals interchangeably.
One source of confusion arises from an apparent discrepancy between the generationinterval and serial-interval viewpoints. While the epidemic is growing exponentially, the

spread of infection can be characterized as a renewal process based on previous incidence
of infection, the associated generation-interval distribution, and the average infectiousness
of an infected individual. It is well established that this renewal formulation allows us to
link the exponential growth rate of an epidemic r with its reproduction number R using the
generation-interval distribution (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007). However, the serial-interval
distribution also describes a renewal process — in this case, the creation of a new symptomatic case based on a symptomatic case in the previous generation. Since both renewal
processes, based on either generation- or serial-interval distributions, describe the same underlying exponentially growing system, both should provide the same correct link between
the reproduction number R and the epidemic growth rate r.
In contexts where the serial- and generation-interval distributions differ, current theory
has no explanation for how two different distributions could provide identical estimates of
R from r. In fact, recent theory suggest that using the serial-interval can underestimate
the reproduction number (Britton and Scalia Tomba, 2019; Ganyani et al., 2020). However,
these studies rely on intrinsic distributions of incubation periods and generation intervals
that neglect the population-level dynamics of disease spread.
Here we show that, by correctly defining and calculating the “forward” serial-interval
distribution (i.e., a distribution of serial intervals from a cohort of infectors that developed
symptoms at the same time) that connects symptom onset dates, we can resolve this discrepancy. These forward intervals are different from the “intrinsic” serial intervals that previous
studies have relied on (Svensson, 2007; Klinkenberg and Nishiura, 2011; te Beest et al., 2013;
Champredon et al., 2018; Britton and Scalia Tomba, 2019). During an ongoing epidemic, all
observed epidemiological delays (e.g., incubation period) between primary (e.g., infection)
and secondary (e.g., symptom onset) events are subject to backward biases: when the incidence of primary events is increasing (or decreasing), we are more likely to observe shorter
(respectively longer) intervals. In particular, when we consider forward serial-interval distributions, the incubation periods of the infectors are subject to backward biases because we
have to look backward in time from their symptom onset to infection. Therefore, the realized
incubation period distributions of the infector and the infectee can differ dynamically, even
if the intrinsic analogues of the same distributions are expected to be equivalent.
We develop a cohort-based framework for characterizing and comparing realized serial
intervals, as well as any other epidemiological delays, and show that the initial forward serialinterval distribution correctly estimates R from r. Conversely, using inaccurately defined
serial intervals or failing to account for changes in the observed serial-interval distributions
over the course of an epidemic can considerably bias estimates of R. For example, in our
analysis of the COVID-19 serial intervals from China, outside Hubei province, we find that
the original R0 estimates based on aggregated serial-interval data underestimated R0 by
a factor of 2.0–2.6. We further lay out several principles to consider in using information
about serial intervals and other epidemiological time delays to correctly infer the initial
reproduction number during the early stages of an outbreak.

Methods
Intrinsic, forward, and backward delay distributions

A time delay between two epidemiological events can involve either one infected individual
(e.g., incubation period: infection and symptom onset of an individual) or two — an infector
and an infectee (e.g., generation and serial intervals). We define the delay as the time
difference between the primary event and the secondary event. In some cases, the primary
event always occurs before the secondary event (e.g., the time from infection to onset of
symptoms in a single individual, or the generation interval between two individuals). In
other cases, the delay can sometimes be negative (e.g., the time from onset of infectiousness
to onset of symptoms in a single individual, or the serial interval between two individuals).
At the individual level, we can define the time distribution between a primary and a
secondary event that we expect to observe for a single infected individual by averaging across
individual characteristics — we refer to this distribution as the intrinsic distribution. For
example, the intrinsic incubation period distribution describes the expected time distribution
from infection to symptom onset of an infected individual. Likewise, the intrinsic generationinterval distribution describes the expected time distribution of infectious contacts made by
an infected individual. However, the intrinsic time distributions are not always equivalent
to the corresponding realized time distributions at the population level (i.e., the distribution
of time between actual primary and secondary events that occur during an epidemic; see
Fig. 1). For example, an infectious contact results in infection only if the contacted individual
is susceptible (and has not already been infected) — this is one mechanism that causes
realized generation intervals (time between actual infection events) to differ from from the
intrinsic generation intervals (time between infection and infectious contacts) (Park et al.,
2020). In this example, the difference between intrinsic and realized time distributions can
be attributed to the fact that the fraction of susceptible individuals is itself dynamic.
At the population level, we model realized time delays between a primary and a secondary
event from a cohort perspective. A cohort consists of all individuals whose (primary or
secondary) event occurred at a given time. For example, when we are measuring incubation
periods, a primary cohort consists of all individuals who became infected at time p, while
a secondary cohort consists of all individuals whose symptom onset occurred at time s.
Similarly, when we are measuring serial intervals, a primary cohort consists of all infectors
who became symptomatic at time p. Then, for a primary cohort at time p, we can define
the distribution of realized delays between primary and secondary events. We refer to this
distribution as the forward delay distribution and denote it as fp (τ ).
Likewise, we define the backward delay distribution bs (τ ) for a secondary cohort at time
s: The backward delay distribution describes the time delays between a primary and secondary events given that the secondary event occurred at time s. For example, the backward
incubation period distribution at time s describes incubation periods for a cohort of individuals who became symptomatic at time s. Likewise, the backward serial-interval distribution
at time s describes serial intervals for a cohort of infectees who became symptomatic at time
s.

Both forward and backward perspectives must yield identical measurement (e.g., the
length of the incubation period of a given individual is the same whether measured forward
from the time of infection or backward from the time of symptom onset). Consequently, no
matter how delays are distributed, if P and S represent the sizes of primary and secondary
cohorts then we can express the total density of intervals τ between calendar time p and s
(i.e., τ = s − p) as follows:
W (p)P(p)fp (τ ) = S(s)bs (τ ) ,

where W (p), the “weight” of the primary cohort, represents the average number of forward
intervals that an individual in cohort P(p) produces over the course of their infection. When
we measure within-individual delays, we expect W (p) ≤ 1 because only a subset of individuals who experience the primary event (e.g., infection) will eventually experience the
secondary event (e.g., symptom onset). For between-individual delays, we expect W (p) to
change throughout an epidemic, because individuals infected earlier in an epidemic will infect
more individuals on average than those infected later.
Substituting p = s − τ , it follows that
bs (τ ) =

If we are considering incubation periods, the left hand side of this equation is the probability
density that an individual who became symptomatic at time s had an incubation period
of length τ . From the right hand side, we see that this probability density depends on
the weight parameter W (s − τ ) (in this case, the proportion of symptomatic infection), the
time-varying primary cohort size at the earlier time P(s − τ ) (in this case, the number of
individuals infected at time s − τ ), and the forward delay distribution fs−τ (τ ) (in this case,
the probability density that an incubation period that starts at time s − τ ends at time s).
Several different mechanisms drive the changes in forward and backward delay distributions over time. Typically, within-individual forward delay distributions are not directly
affected by epidemic dynamics. Some realized forward distributions, like incubation period distributions, are equivalent to their intrinsic distributions and remain invariant at the
time scale of an outbreak. Other realized distributions, like the distribution of time from
symptom onset to testing, may change over the course of an epidemic due to changes in
public-health policies or individual behavior. Between-individual forward delay distributions, such as generation- or serial-interval distributions, depend on epidemic dynamics. For
example, forward generation intervals often become shorter as an epidemic progresses due to
the dynamical process of susceptible depletion, as well as due to other factors like behavioral
change or interventions (Kenah et al., 2008; Nishiura, 2010; Champredon and Dushoff, 2015):
if it is harder to infect later in the course of infection, then proportionally more intervals will
be short.
Eq. (2) suggests that backward delay distributions change over time even if their corresponding forward delay distribution does not change. Backward delay distributions depend
on changes in the primary cohort size over time due to conditionality of observations: Conditioning on individuals whose secondary events have occurred at the same time means that

we tend to observe shorter (or longer) inter-event delays when cohort size has been increasing
(decreasing) through time. When incidence is growing exponentially, we can calculate the
amount of bias exactly. Assuming that the forward delay distribution (fp (τ ) ≈ f0 (τ )) and
the weight parameter (W (p) ≈ W (0)) remain constant during the exponential growth phase,
we can substitute P(t) = P(0) exp(rt) in Eq. (2) to obtain:
b0 (τ ) = [W (0)P(0)/S(0)] exp(−rτ )f0 (τ )

r is the exponential growth rate. Since b0 is a probability distribution, [W (0)P(0)/S(0)]−1 =
Rwhere
∞
exp(−rτ 0 )f0 (τ 0 ) dτ 0 corresponds to the normalization constant. Therefore, the backward
−∞
delay distribution during the exponential growth phase depends only on the exponential
growth rate r and the initial forward delay distribution f0 .
The mean backward interval will be always shorter than the mean forward interval as
long as r > 0. Even for different epidemics of the same disease, we expect to observe shorter
backward intervals within a fast-growing epidemic (high r), all else being equal. In general,
the backward delay distribution will differ from the forward delay distribution (unless the
disease is at equilibrium), even if we are measuring time delays that are intrinsic to the
life history of a disease (e.g., the incubation period). These ideas apply to all epidemiological delay distributions and generalize the work by Champredon and Dushoff (2015) who
compared forward and backward generation-interval distributions to describe realized generation intervals from the perspective of an infector and an infectee, respectively, as well as the
work by Britton and Scalia Tomba (2019) who showed that Eq. (3) holds for the backward
generation-interval distribution.

Realized serial-interval distributions

The serial interval is defined as the time between when an infector becomes symptomatic
and when their infectee becomes symptomatic (Svensson, 2007). Previous studies have often
expressed serial intervals τs in the form (Fig. 1A):
τs = (τg + τi2 ) − τi1

where τi1 and τi2 represent incubation periods of an infector and an infectee, respectively, and
τg represents the generation interval between the infector and the infectee. These studies
concluded that the serial and generation intervals have the same mean when τi1 and τi2
are drawn from the same distributions (Svensson, 2007; Klinkenberg and Nishiura, 2011;
Champredon et al., 2018; Britton and Scalia Tomba, 2019). However, distributions of realized
incubation periods, τi1 and τi2 will be identical only if we assume that they are intrinsic to
individuals (and not dependent on epidemic dynamics at the population-level) — something
that is generally true of forward but not backward incubation-period distributions. We refer
to the definition Eq. (4) as the intrinsic serial interval (Fig. 1A).
To correctly link the realized serial-interval distribution to the renewal process between
cases based on symptom onset dates, we must use the forward serial interval (i.e., use the
perspective of a cohort of infectors that share the same symptom onset time). Given that

an infector became symptomatic at time p, to calculate the forward serial interval we first
go backward in time to when the infector was infected, and then forward in time to when
the infectee was infected, and then forward again to when the infectee became symptomatic.
In Fig. 1B, we see that τi1 is drawn from the backward incubation period distribution of
the cohort of infectors who became symptomatic at time p; τg is drawn from the forward
generation-interval distribution of the cohort of infectors who became infected at time p−τi1 ;
and τi2 is drawn from the forward incubation period distribution of the cohort of infectees who
became infected at time p − τi1 + τg . Likewise, we can define the backward serial-interval
distribution for a cohort of infectees who became symptomatic at time s(Fig. 1C). This
conceptual framework demonstrates that the distributions of τi1 , τg , and τi2 (and therefore
the distributions of realized serial intervals) depend on the reference cohort, which is defined
by temporal direction (forward or backward) and a particular reference time.
To calculate realized serial-interval distributions, we begin by modeling T (p, s): the total
density of serial intervals that start (when infectors develop symptoms) at time p and end
(when infectees develop symptoms) at time s. For simplicity, we assume that all infected
individuals eventually develop symptoms. Then, the density of serial intervals between time
p and s, given that the infectors became infected at time α1 ≤ p and the infectees became
infected at time α2 ≤ s, depends on the amount of infection that occurs between time α1 and
α2 as well as the density of forward incubation periods between α1 and p (realized incubation
periods of infectors) and between α2 and s(realized incubation periods of infectees):
T (p, s|α1 , α2 ) = Rc (α1 ) × i(α1 ) × hα1 (p − α1 , α2 − α1 ) × `α2 (s − α2 ) ,

where the case reproduction number Rc (α1 ) is defined as the average number of secondary
cases that a primary case infected at time α1 will generate over the course of their infection
(Fraser, 2007). We describe the forward incubation periods and the forward generation
intervals using a joint probability distribution because onset of symptoms and transmission
potential jointly depend on the life history of a disease; for example, if an infected individual
can only transmit the disease after symptom onset, the forward generation interval will
necessarily be longer than the forward incubation period.
The total density of serial intervals between time p and s can now be obtained by integrating over all possible infection times for the infector and the infectee:

The denominator of the forward serial-interval distribution (Eq. (7)) then corresponds
to the total number of infections generated by primary cases who themselves developed
symptoms at time p. Dividing
R ∞ this quantity by the number of individuals who developed

287

This framework allows us to understand changes in the realized serial intervals for any epidemic model and properly link serial-interval distributions with the renewal process. In
addition, assuming that the reproduction number as well as the forward serial-interval distribution remain constant during the exponential growth phase, we can substitute j(t) ≈
j(0) exp(rt), Rs (t) ≈ Rs (0), and ft−τ (τ ) ≈ f0 (τ ) to obtain:

Therefore, the initial forward serial-interval distribution, f0 (τ ), provides the correct link
between the exponential growth rate r and the initial serial reproduction number Rs (0).
We re-visit this idea later in Section 2.4 and show that the initial forward serial-interval
distribution provides the same r–R link as the intrinsic generation-interval distribution.

Epidemic model

We illustrate changes in forward and backward serial intervals over the course of an epidemic by applying our framework to a specific example of an epidemic model. We model
disease spread with a renewal-equation model (Heesterbeek and Dietz, 1996; Diekmann and
Heesterbeek, 2000; Roberts, 2004; Aldis and Roberts, 2005; Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007;
Champredon et al., 2018). Ignoring births and deaths, changes in the proportion of susceptible individuals S(t) and incidence of infection i(t) can be described as:

where R(t) is the instantaneous reproduction number (i.e., the average number of secondary
cases that a primary case infected at time t will generate if conditions at time t remain
unchanged (Fraser, 2007)), and g(τ ) is the intrinsic generation-interval distribution (i.e., the
forward generation-interval distribution of a primary case in a population where changes in
R(t) is negligible (Champredon and Dushoff, 2015)). This model assumes that g(τ ) remains
constant through time – in other words, that epidemic dynamics are driven by changes in
transmission rate. This assumption may not be well suited to individual-based intervention
such as case isolation (Fraser, 2007); nonetheless, this form has been widely used in the
literature and has been successfully applied in modeling the current COVID-19 pandemic
(Gostic et al., 2020).
Here, changes in reproduction number can be modeled as a product of the basic reproduction number R0 , proportion susceptible S(t), and a time-dependent factor M (t) (for
example, accounting for nonpharmaceutical interventions and behavioral changes): R(t) =
R0 S(t)M (t); Flaxman et al. (2020) used a similar framework to evaluate the impact of
nonpharmaceutical interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in 11 countries. Then, the
forward generation-interval for a cohort of individuals that were infected at time p follows
(Champredon and Dushoff, 2015):
gp (τ ) = R ∞

,
g(τ 0 )S(p + τ 0 )M (p + τ 0 ) dτ 0

(13)

which allows us to separate the joint probability distribution hp of the forward incubation
period and the forward generation-interval distribution as a product of the proportion of
susceptible individuals S and the joint probability distribution h of the forward incubation
period and the intrinsic generation intervals:
hp (x, τ ) = R ∞ R ∞

h(x, τ )S(p + τ )M (p + τ )
.
h(x0 , τ 0 )S(p + τ 0 )M (p + τ 0 ) dτ 0 dx0

(14)

We further assume that the forward incubation period distribution does not vary across
cohorts over the course of an epidemic, as it represents the life history of a disease; we
denote it as `. Then, we have:
Z ∞
`(x) =
h(x, τ ) dτ,
Z0 ∞
g(τ ) =

epidemiological time distributions vary over the course of an epidemic and depend on the
perspective (i.e., forward vs. backward).
For simplicity, we let M = 1 and assume that epidemic dynamics depend only on susceptible depletion in our simulations. Since we are interested in the initial epidemic growth
phase (i.e., linking r to R), we expect R(t) to remain roughly constant during this period. In
addition, qualitative effects of M that reduces R(t) monotonically over time will be similar
to the impact of susceptible depletion under this modeling framework. Therefore, general
conclusions we draw from our analysis is expected to be robust—however, detailed shape of
the epidemic curve and changes in generation- and serial-intervals can still depend on the
shape of M .

Linking r and R

During the initial phase of an epidemic, the proportion susceptible remains approximately
constant (S(t) ≈ S(0)) and incidence of infection grows exponentially: i(t) ≈ i0 exp(rt).
During this period, the intrinsic generation-interval distribution provides the correct link
between the exponential growth rate r and the initial reproduction number R = R0 S(0)
based on the Euler-Lotka equation (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007). Here, we focus on the
estimates of the basic reproduction number R0 (the value of R in a fully susceptible population, S(t) ≈ 1):
Z ∞
1
=
exp(−rτ )g(τ ) dτ.
(17)
R0
0
Analogous to the intrinsic generation-interval distribution, forward serial-interval distributions describe the renewal process between symptomatic cases. Therefore, we expect the
forward serial-interval distribution during the exponential growth phase — which we refer to
as the initial forward serial-interval distribution f0 — to estimate the same value of R0 for
a given r as the intrinsic generation-interval distribution (note, however, that the forward
serial interval is not necessarily positive):
Z ∞
1
=
exp(−rτ )f0 (τ )dτ.
(18)
R0
−∞

Here, the initial forward serial-interval distribution is given by:
Z Z τ

f0 (τ ) =
exp(rα1 )h(−α1 , α2 − α1 )`(τ − α2 ) dα2 dα1 ,
(19)
φ −∞ α1
R∞
where the normalization constant φ is determined by the requirement that −∞ f0 (τ ) dτ = 1.
We provide a mathematical proof of this relationship in Supplementary Materials. Since we
do not make any assumptions about the shape of the joint distribution h between incubation
periods and the generation intervals, Eq. (18) holds in general whether or not there is a
presymptomatic transmission period.
We further compare this with the estimate of R0 based on the intrinsic serial-interval
distribution q(τ ):

The intrinsic serial-interval distribution q(τ ) does not depend on epidemic dynamics, and is
given by:
Z 0 Z τ
1
h(−α1 , α2 − α1 )`(τ − α2 ) dα2 dα1 ,
(21)
q(τ ) =
φq −∞ α1
R∞
where the normalization constant φq is determined by the requirement that −∞ q(τ ) dτ = 1.
Rather than numerically integrating over closed forms of g, f0 , and q to estimate R0 , we use
simulation-based approaches for simplicity (Supplementary Materials).
The initial forward serial-interval distribution depends on the exponential growth rate
r. For a fast-growing epidemic (high r), we expect the backward incubation periods to be
short (Eq. (3)), meaning that presymptomatic transmission is less likely to occur. Therefore,
the initial forward serial-interval distribution will generally have a larger mean than the intrinsic generation- and serial-interval distributions. However, the exact shape of the initial
forward serial-interval distribution depends on the shape of the joint distribution. For example, the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model, under the additional assumption
that the incubation and exposed periods are equivalent (i.e. that onset of symptoms and
infectiousness occur simultaneously), provides a special case. In this case, the forward serialand generation-intervals follow the same distributions during the exponential growth phase
because (i) infected individuals can only transmit after symptom onset and (ii) the time between symptom onset and infection is independent of the incubation period of an infector (see
Supplementary Materials). Everywhere else in this paper, however, we do not assume that
the incubation and exposed periods are equivalent. Instead, we allow for presymptomatic
transmission in the model in order to reflect the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.

Model parameterization

We have shown that the dynamics of the serial-interval distribution depend on the joint
distribution between incubation periods and generation intervals. Here, we use a bivariate
lognormal distribution to model the joint probability distribution h of intrinsic incubation
periods and intrinsic generation intervals (in the renewal equation model, Eq. (12)) while
allowing for the possibility that they might be correlated. Given that the viral load of SARSCoV-2 peaks around the time of symptom onset (He et al., 2020), we generally expect the
generation intervals to be positively correlated with the incubation period: that is, individuals who develop symptoms later are more likely to transmit later. Marginal distributions of
incubation periods and generation intervals are parameterized based on parameter estimates
for COVID-19 (Table 1). For simplicity, we consider four values for the correlation coefficients (on the log scale) of the bivariate lognormal distribution: ρ = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75. This
parameterization allows for generation intervals to be shorter than the incubation period,
allowing for presymptomatic transmission.

Results

We use parameter estimates for COVID-19 to characterize the degree to which the realized
serial-interval distribution can change over the course of an epidemic and to evaluate how
different definitions of the serial-interval distribution can affect the Euler-Lotka estimates of
R0 . We further address how the observed serial intervals, measured through contact tracing,
are affected by right censoring during an ongoing epidemic and provide a heuristic method
for addressing biases that can arise from using serial-interval data to estimate R0 . Finally, we
analyze serial-interval data from the COVID-19 epidemic in China, outside Hubei province,
based on 468 transmission events reported between January 21–February 8, 2020, under our
framework.

Realized serial-interval distributions during the exponential
growth phase

Fig. 2 shows Euler-Lotka estimates of R0 based on different definitions of the serial interval.
When the initial forward serial-interval distribution f0 (τ ) is used, estimates (from Eq. (18))
exactly match the (correct) generation-interval-based estimates (Eq. (17)) for all values of
the correlation ρ between the intrinsic incubation period and the intrinsic generation interval (Fig. 2A). When the intrinsic distributions are used, however, estimates based on the
serial interval (Eq. (20)) underestimate R0 : as r increases, Rintrinsic saturates and eventually
decreases due to the increasing inferred importance of negative serial intervals (Fig. 2B).
While the initial forward serial intervals during the exponential growth phase can also be
negative, their effects are appropriately balanced because faster epidemic growth leads to
longer serial intervals (and a corresponding lower proportion of negative intervals).

Comparing the shapes of the initial forward serial-interval distribution (Eq. (19)) and the

and less variability lead to higher R0 for a given r (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007; Weitz and
Dushoff, 2015; Park et al., 2019). When incidence is growing exponentially, forward serial
intervals have higher means (Fig. 2C) and squared coefficients of variation (Fig. 2D) than the
intrinsic generation-interval distribution. The effects of higher means (which increase R0 )

exactly cancel those of higher variability (which decrease R0 ). On the other hand, intrinsic
serial intervals (Eq. (21)) have the same mean (equal to the mean initial forward serial at
r = 0 in Fig. 2C) as the intrinsic generation intervals but are more variable (also see squared
coefficient of variation of the initial forward serial-interval distribution at r = 0 in Fig. 2D);
therefore, we underestimate R0 when we use the intrinsic serial-interval distribution.

3.2

Realized serial-interval distributions during an ongoing epidemic

The initial forward serial-interval distribution captures the exponential growth phase of an
epidemic. We now explore how forward and backward serial intervals can vary over the course
of an epidemic using deterministic and stochastic simulations based on the renewal equations
(see Supplementary Materials) using parameters in Table 1; we further assume R0 = 2.5
to reflect the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in China (Park et al., 2020). While
the forward serial-interval distribution is our primary focus, understanding the differences
between the forward and the backward distributions is important because the observed
intervals during an ongoing epidemic are often the backward ones: we typically identify
infected individuals and ask when and by whom they were infected. Similarly, when we are
estimating the incubation period of an individual, we typically observe their symptom onset
date and try to estimate when they were infected (e.g., Backer et al. (2020)).
Fig. 3 shows the epidemiological dynamics (A) together with the mean forward (B–D) and
the mean backward (E–G) delay distributions of a deterministic model based on the renewal
equation (Eq. (12)) and of the corresponding stochastic realizations based on individualbased simulations. The mean forward incubation period remains constant throughout an
epidemic by assumption (Fig. 3B). The mean forward generation interval decreases slightly
when incidence is high, which is when the susceptible population declines rapidly (Fig. 3C;
Kenah et al. (2008); Champredon and Dushoff (2015)). In contrast, the mean forward serial
interval decreases over time (Fig. 3D).
The forward serial-interval distributions depend on distributions of three intervals (Fig. 1B):
(i) the backward incubation period, (ii) the forward generation interval, and (iii) the forward incubation period. In these simulations, both forward incubation period (Fig. 3B) and
generation-interval (Fig. 3C) distributions remain roughly constant; therefore, changes in
the forward serial-interval distributions (Fig. 3D) are predominantly driven by changes in
the backward incubation period distribution, whose mean increases over time as the growth
rate of disease incidence slows and then reverses. In general, relative contributions of the
three distributions depend on their shapes, correlations between intrinsic incubation periods
and generation intervals, and overall epidemiological dynamics.
We see similar qualitative patterns in all three backward delays (Fig. 3E–G; Eq. (2)),
because they are predominantly driven by the rate of change in incidence, which in turn
affects relative cohort sizes. When incidence is increasing, individuals are more likely to have
been infected recently, and therefore we are more likely to observe shorter intervals (Eq. (3)).
Similarly, when incidence decreases, we are more likely to observe longer intervals. Neglecting
these changes will bias the inference of intrinsic distributions from observed distributions.

Now, we turn to practical issues of estimating the reproduction number from the observed
serial-interval data during on ongoing epidemic. In order to have an unbiased estimate of the
basic reproduction number, we need to estimate the initial forward serial-interval distribution
— i.e., serial intervals based on cohorts of infectors who share the same symptom onset time,
at the early stage of the epidemic. However, researchers typically use all available information
to estimate epidemiological parameters (e.g., aggregating all serial intervals observed until

certain time of an epidemic). For example, Thompson et al. (2019) recently suggested that
up-to-date serial-interval data are necessary to accurately estimate the reproduction number.
We explore the consequences of neglecting changes in the realized serial-interval distribution
on estimates of the basic reproduction number.
When an epidemic is ongoing, the observed serial intervals are subject to right-censoring
because we cannot observe a serial interval if either an infector or an infectee has not yet
developed symptoms. For example, if we were to measure serial intervals on Day 8 as in
Fig. 4A, we will only be able to observe the first 6 events (ID 1–6). Fig. 4B demonstrates how
the effect of right-censoring in the observed serial intervals translates to the underestimation
of the basic reproduction number R0 in our stochastic simulations (assuming R0 = 2.5
as in Fig. 3). Notably, even if we could observe and aggregate all serial intervals across all
transmission pairs after the epidemic has ended, we would still underestimate the initial mean
forward serial interval (and therefore R0 ), likely by a large amount. The observed serialinterval distribution converges to the intrinsic serial-interval distribution as the incubation
periods and generation intervals will no longer be subject to backward biases. In fact,
we would even underestimate the intrinsic value slightly due to contraction of the forward
generation-interval distribution during the susceptible depletion phase (Fig. 3C). Therefore,
aggregated distributions of serial intervals that have been collected throughout different
periods of an epidemic must be interpreted with care.
Here, we provide a heuristic way of assessing potential biases in the estimate of the
mean initial forward serial interval and therefore R0 retrospectively. We can rearrange the
line list and group observed serial intervals based on the symptom onset date of infectors
(Fig. 4C)—as we showed earlier, serial intervals that share the same symptom onset date of
a primary case give us the forward serial-interval distribution. Then, we can compare how
the shape of the serial-interval distribution (particularly its mean) as well as the estimate
of R0 change as we incorporate more recent cohorts into the analysis: that is, we analyze
observed serial intervals from infectors who became symptomatic before time t and evaluate
how the estimates change as we increase t. This approach is analogous to averaging over a
set of forward intervals, just as using all information up to a certain time is analogous to
averaging over a set of backward intervals (Fig. 4D); the major difference is that we we focus
on serial intervals that begin in a certain period, rather than those that end in a certain
period. During the exponential growth phase, the estimates of the mean serial interval and
R0 are consistent with the true value (see ‘initial forward’ in Fig. 4B,D); adding more data
allows us to make more precise inference during this period. However, the cohort-averaged
estimates decrease rapidly soon after the exponential growth period, reflecting changes in the
forward serial-interval distributions. This approach allows us to detect dynamical changes
in the forward serial-interval distributions and their effect on the estimates of R0 .

bution of symptom onset dates of all individuals within 468 transmission pairs (consisting a
total of 752 unique individuals), resembling a COVID-19 epidemic curve in China (cf. Fig. 1
in Pan et al. (2020)). In order to quantify changes in serial intervals, we group them by the
symptom onset dates of the primary (Fig. 5B) and secondary (Fig. 5C) cases—corresponding
to forward and backward serial-interval distributions, respectively—and compute their mean
and 95% quantiles. Fig. 5B shows that the mean forward serial interval decreases over time.
While the decrease is likely to be affected by the right-censoring (indicated by the closeness between the quantiles of the observed serial intervals and maximum observable serial
intervals), the increase in the proportion of negative serial intervals indicates changes in the
forward serial-interval distribution; this proportion is unlikely to be affected by left-censoring
(based on the gap between the quantiles of the observed serial intervals and minimum observable serial intervals). The decrease in the mean forward serial interval was probably
driven by interventions against spread. Interventions during this time period both decreased
(and then reversed) the growth rate of COVID-19 cases — thus increasing the backward
incubation period — and also reduced generation intervals, by preventing infections once
cases were identified. Both of these would have acted to reduce the forward serial interval.
Fig. 5C shows that the mean backward serial interval increased over time, also likely driven
directly by the decrease in COVID-19 infections.
While the qualitative changes in the mean forward and backward serial interval are consistent with our earlier simulations (Fig. 3), the initial mean forward serial interval (Fig. 5B)
appears to be larger than what we calculated based on previously estimated incubation
period and generation-interval distributions (Fig. 2C). This difference may imply that the
incubation period and generation interval (Table 1) were underestimated, as neither study
explicitly accounted for the fact that the observed intervals were drawn from the backward
distributions and were likely to have been censored.
Fig. 5D shows the cohort-averaged estimates of R0 , which remain roughly constant until
day January 17th and suddenly decreases; this sudden decrease is due to changes in the
forward serial intervals consistent with the dynamics seen in our simulations (Fig. 4). The
cohort-averaged estimates of R0 based on the early forward serial intervals are also consistent
with previous estimates of R0 of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (Majumder and Mandl,
2020; Park et al., 2020): R0 = 2.6 (95% CI: 2.2–3.1) and R0 = 3.4 (95% CI: 2.7 – 4.3) based
on a doubling period of 8 or 6 days, respectively, using serial-interval data from infectors
who developed symptoms by January 17th. These early cohort-averaged estimates of R0
are unlikely to be affected by the right-censoring as we expect the degree of right-censoring
to be low (Fig. 5A). Therefore, the original R0 estimate of 1.32 (95% CI 1.16-–1.48), which
neglects the changes in the forward serial-interval distribution, underestimates R0 by a factor
of 2.0–2.6. This example demonstrates the danger of using the observed serial intervals to
calculate the reproduction number without organizing serial intervals into cohorts.

Discussion

Generation and serial intervals determine the time scale of disease transmission, and are
therefore critical to dynamical modeling of infectious outbreaks. We have shown that the
initial forward serial-interval distribution — measured from the cohort of infectors who
developed symptoms during the exponential growth phase of an epidemic — provides the
correct link between the exponential growth rate r and the initial reproduction number R.
In general, the forward serial-interval distributions will not match the intrinsic serial-interval
distribution (which has the same mean as the intrinsic generation-interval distribution) because the incubation period of the infectors (conditional on their symptom onset date of
the infector) will be subject to backward biases. In particular, the mean forward serial interval can decrease over time for COVID-19 as individuals who develop symptoms later in
an epidemic are more likely to have longer incubation periods, and therefore have greater
opportunity to transmit presymptomatically. Failing to account for these effects can result
in underestimation of initial R.
Recently, Ali et al. (2020) also showed that forward serial intervals of COVID-19 decreased
through time in China. They grouped serial intervals by the symptom onset date of infectors
across 14-day periods and found that the mean forward serial interval decreased from 7.8
days to 2.6 days. While they attributed the decrease in serial intervals to reduction of the
isolation delay, their regression analysis showed that isolation delays explain only 51.5% of
the variation in serial intervals (they could explain up to 72% of the variance by including
other intervention measures). Our framework provides an explanation for the remaining
variation: changes in the backward incubation period during the decreasing phase of an
epidemic act to further shorten serial intervals due to increased amount of presymptomatic
transmission (even in the absence of nonpharmaceutical interventions). Isolation delays and
other intervention measures affect the amount of onward transmission, and therefore the
distribution of realized (forward) generation intervals. They therefore are not expected to
explain all the variation in forward serial intervals, since these additionally depend on both
the backward incubation period of the infector and the forward incubation period of the
infectee (Fig. 1B).
Our results support the use of serial-interval distributions for calculating the R during
the exponential growth phase, but they also reveal gaps in current practices in incorporating serial-interval distributions into outbreak analyses. For example, Thompson et al.
(2019) recently emphasized the importance of using up-to-date serial-interval data for accurate estimation of time-varying reproduction numbers. However, our results show that if
observational biases in the forward serial interval through time are not accounted for, using
up-to-date serial-interval data can actually exacerbate the underestimation of R in the initial growth phase of an outbreak. Future studies should explore how neglecting changes in
the forward serial-interval distribution can affect the estimates of R beyond the exponential growth phase, and potentially re-assess existing estimates of R. We also suggest that
modelers should aim to characterize spatiotemporal variation in forward serial-interval distributions. These modeling approaches should be coupled with epidemiological investigation
through contact tracing. Going forward, an additional advantage of early, intensive contact

tracing of emerging diseases is that it provides the best information to characterize the initial
forward serial-interval distribution.
Our study underlines the fact that the serial-interval distribution depends not only on
the generation-interval and incubation-period distributions, but also on the correlation between their duration in a given individual. Here, we use a bivariate lognormal distribution
to capture these correlations phenomenologically and to show that realized serial intervals
can decrease over time in the context of COVID-19. Although their true correlation will
depend on viral load dynamics, we expect our conclusions about decreasing serial intervals
of COVID-19 to be robust, as individuals with longer incubation periods will generally have
a longer time window to transmit before symptom onset. In general, the impact of increasing
backward incubation periods on the forward serial intervals are likely to be disease-specific—
for example, we show in Supplementary Materials that the initial forward serial-interval distribution can be equivalent to the intrinsic generation-interval distribution, regardless of the
growth rate r, due to independence between the incubation period and time from symptom
onset to transmission and the lack of presymptomatic transmission. Future studies trying
to interpret realized serial intervals should consider carefully the joint distribution between
the generation intervals and incubation periods.
In closing, we lay out a few practical principles for analyzing and interpreting serialinterval data. First, serial intervals should be cohorted based on the symptom onset date of
the infector (and not of the infectee) whenever possible. Previous studies have often regarded
serial intervals as an intrinsic quantity, having the same mean as the intrinsic generation
interval (Svensson, 2007; Klinkenberg and Nishiura, 2011; Champredon et al., 2018; Britton
and Scalia Tomba, 2019), but the distribution (and the mean) of observed serial intervals
differs from this expectation, and changes through time due to epidemic dynamics. Second,
aggregating serial intervals across different cohorts and epidemic periods should be avoided
because the realized serial-interval distribution can be subject to different censoring and
epidemiological biases: Even when all realized serial intervals can be observed throughout
an unmitigated epidemic, we do not obtain the intrinsic serial interval distribution due to
susceptible depletion (Fig. 4). Third, applying serial-interval information across epidemics of
a given disease should be done with care, because serial intervals are epidemic-specific, rather
than disease-specific. Finally, serial-interval data should be accompanied by a trajectory of
the epidemic curve, whenever possible, to provide epidemiological context. In practice,
these recommendations will sometimes be hard to follow, due to limited data about serial
intervals, but these issues should be kept in mind when interpreting serial-interval data to
inform transmission dynamics.
More broadly, our study underlines the importance of carefully defining measured epidemiological time distributions. Previous studies have shown the importance of forward vs.
backward measurement of generation intervals (Nishiura, 2010; Champredon and Dushoff,
2015; Britton and Scalia Tomba, 2019); we generalize these ideas and show that they apply to
other epidemiological distributions. Some studies during the early phases of the COVID-19
epidemics have tried to correct for the backward biases (Verity et al., 2020), but changes in
the backward delay distributions due to changing cohort sizes are expected to be a pervasive
feature of outbreak dynamics. Cohorting epidemiological delays by the primary event time

can help avoid backward biases (although censoring biases can still exist) as well as detect
potential changes in the distribution.
Here, we assume that all individuals develop symptoms and that the entire transmission
process, including all relevant epidemiological delays, is known exactly. In practice, identifying who infected whom is difficult in general, and asymptomatic and presymptomatic
transmission of COVID-19 exacerbates this difficulty (Bai et al., 2020; He et al., 2020; Wei,
2020). Biases in the observed serial intervals will necessarily bias the estimates of R. Furthermore, when one of the individuals in a transmission pair is asymptomatic, there is no
symptom-based serial interval. Neglecting the time scale of asymptomatic transmission may
also bias the estimates of R (Park et al., 2020).
Despite these limitations, our analysis of serial intervals of COVID-19 from China provides further support for our theoretical framework, demonstrating temporal variation in
serial intervals and its effect on the estimates of R. Most existing estimates of the serialintervals of COVID-19 implicitly or explicitly assume that the serial-interval distributions
remain constant throughout the course of an epidemic (Du et al., 2020; He et al., 2020;
Nishiura et al., 2020; Tindale et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Our study
provides a rationale for reassessing estimates of serial-interval distributions—and their use
in estimating R—during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Stochastic simulation

We run stochastic simulations of the renewal equation model using an individual-based
model on a fully connected network (i.e., homogeneous population) based on the Gillespie
algorithm that we developed earlier (Park et al., 2020). First, we initialize an epidemic with
I(0) infected individuals (nodes) in a fully connected network of size N . For each initially
infected individual, we draw number of infectious contacts from a Poisson distribution with
the mean of R0 and the corresponding generation intervals for each contact from a lognormal distribution (Table 1). Contactees are uniformly sampled from the total population.

All contactees are sorted into event queues based on their infection time. We update the
current time to the infection time of the first person in the queue. Then, the first person in
the queue makes contacts based on the Poisson offspring distribution described earlier and
their contactees are added to the sorted queue. Whenever contactees are added to the sorted
queue, we remove all duplicated contacts (but keep the first one) as well as contacts made
to individuals that have already been infected. Simulations continue until there are no more
individuals in the queue. We simulate 10 epidemics with I(0) = 10 and N =40,000.

Linking r and R0 using serial-interval distributions

The intrinsic generation-interval distribution g(τ ) provides a link between r and R0 via the
Euler-Lotka equation (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007):
Z ∞
1
=
exp(−rτ )g(τ ) dτ .
(27)
R0
0
In this section, we prove that the initial forward serial-interval distribution f0 (τ ) also estimates the same R0 from r, except that integral extends to τ = −∞ rather than beginning
at τ = 0, because serial intervals can be negative:
Z ∞
1
exp(−rτ )f0 (τ ) dτ .
(28)
=
R0
−∞
Here, the initial forward serial-interval distribution f0 (τ ) is defined as:
Z Z τ
1 0
f0 (τ ) =
exp(rα1 )h(−α1 , α2 − α1 )`(τ − α2 ) dα2 dα1 ,
φ −∞ α1

(29)

where h is the joint probability distribution describing the intrinsic generation-interval distribution g and the intrinsic incubation period distribution ` (see Eq. (15)Rin the main text),
∞
and the normalization constant φ is determined by the requirement that −∞ f0 (τ ) dτ = 1.
In order to verify Eq. (28), we first rewrite the integral in Eq. (29) by substituting −α1
for α1 , and then changing the order of integration:
Z Z
1 ∞ τ
exp(−rα1 )h(α1 , α2 + α1 )`(τ − α2 ) dα2 dα1 ,
f0 (τ ) =

Z Z ∞
1 τ
=
exp(−rα1 )h(α1 , α2 + α1 )`(τ − α2 ) dα1 dα2 .
(30)
φ −∞ max (0,−α2 )
To further simplify the expression, we define z(α2 ) as follows:
Z ∞
z(α2 ) =
exp(−rα1 )h(α1 , α2 + α1 ) dα1 .

(31)

max (0,−α2 )

Substituting z(α2 ) into Eq. (30) we obtain:

Comparing the estimates of R0 using the initial forward and
the intrinsic serial-interval distributions

We use a simulation-based approach to compare the estimates of R0 based on the serialand generation-interval distributions. To do so, we model the intrinsic generation-interval
distribution and the incubation period using a multivariate log-normal distribution with log
2
means µG , µI , log standard variances σG
, σI2 , and log-scale correlation ρ; the multivariate lognormal distribution is parameterized based on parameter estimates for COVID-19 (Table 1).
We construct forward serial intervals during the exponential growth period as follows:
Fi = −X1,i + (Gi |X1,i ) + X2,i ,

where the backward incubation period X1,i of an infector is simulated by drawing random lognormal samples Yi with log mean µI and log variance σI2 and resampling Yi , each weighted by
the inverse of the exponential growth function exp(−rYi ); the intrinsic generation interval
conditional on the incubation period of the infector (Gi |X1,i ) is drawn from a log-normal
2
(1 − ρ2 ); the
distribution with log mean µG + σG ρ(log(X1,i ) − µI )/σI and log variance σG
forward incubation period X2,i of an infectee is drawn from a log-normal distribution with
log mean µI and log variance σI2 . We then calculate the basic reproduction number R0 using
the empirical estimator:
1
.
(46)
R0 = 1 PN
i=1 exp(−rFi )
N
We compare this with an estimate of R0 based on the intrinsic serial-interval distribution
which has the same mean as the intrinsic generation-interval distribution (Svensson, 2007;
Klinkenberg and Nishiura, 2011; Champredon et al., 2018; Britton and Scalia Tomba, 2019):

Applications: SEIR model

Consider a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model:
dS
= −βSI
dt
dE
= βSI − γE E
dt
dI
= γE E − γI I
dt
dR
= γI I
(49)
dt
where β is the transmission rate, 1/γE is the mean latent period, and 1/γI is the mean
infectious period. We further assume that the latent period is equivalent to incubation
period; in other words, infected individuals can only transmit after symptom onset. Then,
the generation interval will be always longer than the incubation period.
The joint probability distribution of the intrinsic incubation periods and intrinsic generation intervals for this model can be written as:
(
0
x>τ
h(x, τ ) =
(50)
γI γE exp(−γI (τ − x) − γE x) x ≤ τ
Then, the intrinsic generation-interval distribution is given by:
Z τ
g(τ ) =
h(x, τ ) dx
0

γI γE
(exp(−γI τ ) − exp(−γE τ ))
γE − γI
On the other hand, the initial forward serial-interval distribution is given by:
Z 0 Z τ
exp(rα1 )h(−α1 , α2 − α1 )`(τ − α2 ) dα2 dα1
f0 (τ ) ∝
−∞ 0
Z 0 Z τ

exp((r + γE )α1 ) dα1

Therefore, both the intrinsic generation intervals and the initial forward serial intervals are
identically distributed and have the same mean.

Figure S1: Epidemiological dynamics and changes in mean forward and backward
delay distributions. (A) Daily incidence over time. (B–D) Changes in the mean forward
incubation period, generation interval, and serial interval. (E–G) Changes in the mean
backward incubation period, generation interval, and serial interval. Intrinsic incubation
periods and intrinsic generation intervals are modeled using a correlated bivariate lognormal
distribution; therefore, generation intervals are drawn from the corresponding conditional
distributions (given a incubation period), instead of the marginal distribution. Higher correlation reduces the amount of changes in the mean forward serial interval because shorter
(longer) backward incubation periods of infectors during the increasing (decreasing) phase
of an epidemic are associated with shorter (longer) forward generation intervals. See Figure
3 in the main text for a detailed description.
