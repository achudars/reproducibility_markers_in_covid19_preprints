ABSTRACT (197 of 200 words)
In the age of a pandemic, such as the ongoing one caused by SARS-CoV-2, the world faces
limited supply of tests, PPE and reagents, and factories are struggling to meet the growing
demands. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pooling specimen for testing of SARSCoV-2 virus, to determine whether costs and resource savings could be achieved without
impacting the sensitivity of the testing. Ten specimens were pooled for testing, containing
either one or two known positive specimen of varying viral concentrations. Pooling
specimens did not affect the sensitivity of detecting SARS-CoV-2, and the PCR cycle
threshold (Ct) between testing of pooling specimen and subsequent individual testing was
not significantly different using paired t-test. This study also identified cost savings garnered
from pooling of specimen for testing at 4 differing prevalence rates, ranging from 0.1-10%.
Pooling specimens to test for COVID-19 infection in low prevalence areas or in low risk
population can dramatically decrease the resources burden on lab operations by up to 80%.
This paves the possibility for large-scale population screening, allowing for assured policy
decisions by governmental bodies to ease lockdown restrictions in areas with low incidence
of infection, or with lower risk populations.

TEXT (1811 of 2000 words)
INTRODUCTION
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for early diagnosis of emerging
infectious diseases to better contain an outbreak. Testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that
causes COVID-19, has been limited due to factors including high cost and low availability of
reagents, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other consumables, and the
sheer volume of samples be tested. Factories have been struggling to meet the growing
demands for these necessities1,2. To date, countries that are able to screen patients swiftly
have fared better in containing the COVID-19 outbreak and suppressing the mortality rate
associated with the disease3. The rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 in both symptomatic and
asymptomatic patients can shed light on transmission patterns and facilitate contact
tracing2,3. Large scale population screening for COVID-19 infection is generally considered a
necessary part of an exit strategy from the coronavirus lockdown, and in reinforcing
infection control measures in hospitals and among health care workers.

Specimen pooling is a method of screening large number of patients for an infection, and
typically involves combining multiple patient specimens into a single test sample, then
testing multiple such samples. This approach has the advantage of cost-effectiveness and
speed, and was used to retrospectively screen for COVID-19 in specimens that were
negative for common respiratory viruses earlier in the course of the pandemic in the United
States4, and in France to rapidly screen multiple returning expatriates from China with low
suspicion of infection5. Specimen pooling has also been used in screening efforts for several
other infectious diseases, including donated blood samples for HIV6-9.

Pooling nasopharyngeal and throat swab (NT) specimens would be more economical than
individually testing all specimens from low-risk populations, particularly in limited-resource
settings10. The current study was undertaken to compare laboratory results from sample
pooling (10 samples) with the standard real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing
without pooling, as a means of preparing for a broad pooling-based screening effort to
ensure that detection accuracy will not be compromised.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study is an evaluation of laboratory techniques using archived clinical specimens and
was exempted from Chulalongkorn University Institutional Review Board (IRB) review. NT
specimens used in this study had been collected from patients under investigation (PUI) for
COVID-19 infection at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, placed in viral transport media
(VTM) and sent to the Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre
Laboratory for testing between February 1, and March 31, 2020. All specimens had been
stored at -80oC. In addition, 50 SARS-CoV-2 negative NT specimens in VTM from routine
diagnoses (1.0 mL each), as determined by real-time PCR (BGI, Shenzhen, China), were
pooled, and this pooled negative NT-VTM served as the negative portion of all samples
tested (Figure 1). These negative pooled specimens were re-tested for SARS-CoV-2 using
real-time PCR to confirm the negative result prior to pooling with selected positive
specimens.

This study used magnetic extraction-based assay (NUCLISENS®, easyMag®, bioMérieux,
Marcy-l’Étoile, France) based on the Boom method to extract DNA and RNA, which allows a
maximum specimen volume of 1.0mL11. By using magnetic beads to capture DNA and RNA
during the extraction step, pooling 10 specimens of 0.1mL each (total of 1.0 mL extraction
sample) can result in the same extraction capability as 0.1mL if the elution volume at the
end is equal and there is no PCR interference from the specimen such as lipid, protein or cell
debris.

Two pooling ratios were evaluated in this study, termed 1X and 2X. In the 1X ratio, 0.1mL of
NT-VTM from one SARS-CoV-2 positive specimen was combined with 0.9 mL pooled

negative NT-VTM, thus modeling a 10% infection rate. Correspondingly, in the 2X ratio,
0.1mL of NT-VTM each from two SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens were pooled with 0.8 mL
pooled negative NT-VTM, thus modeling a 20% infection rate (see Figure 1). All 1.0 mL
pooled samples in this study were then processed for nucleic acid extraction using
NUCLISENS® easyMAG® instrument (bioMérieux). In addition, 0.1mL of the same positive
specimens that were used in the pooled samples were re-tested for sensitivity comparison
using a separate extraction system (EZ1, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Real-time PCR (qPCR)
for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using a commercial kit which targets the
ORF1ab gene as per the manufacturer’s protocol (BGI, Shenzhen, China). The protocol’s
stated limit of detection of ORF1ab real-time PCR was 100 copies/mL and the cutoff PCR
cycle threshold (Ct) was 38.

Previously positive specimens with high and low-concentrations of RNA, as determined by
PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values at the time of detection, were selected to determine the
effect of viral load on pooling to ensure sensitivity and accuracy of the assays is maintained
(Table 1). Low Ct values indicate the presence of higher amounts of viral RNA and high Ct
values indicate lower amounts. In this study, specimens with Ct values between 26 – 35
were considered to have low concentrations of viral RNA, while those with Ct values lower
than 26 were considered to have of high-concentrations viral RNA. The experimental design
is summarized in Figure 1.

Twenty-eight 10-specimen pools were prepared. Ten of these had a 1X pooling ratio and 18
had 2X ratios. Among the 1X ratio, six had low viral concentrations, (L, Ct values from 27.90
to 35.49) and four had high viral concentrations (H, Ct values from 18.00 to 23.76). The 2X

ratio pools had two positive specimens each, with viral concentrations as follows: five pools
had two low-concentration specimens (L+L, Ct values from 29.82 to 35.52), five pools had
two high concentration specimens (H+H Ct values from 12.91 to 25.56), and eight pools had
one high and one low concentration specimens (H+L, Ct values from 18.47 to 33.41).

The sensitivity of viral RNA detection for each pool was compared with the sensitivity of PCR
results for the individually tested positive specimen in that pool. For 2X ratio pools, the
positive specimen with the lower Ct value, when individually tested, was used for
comparison (Table 1).

RESULTS
All 1X ratio pools were positive, with Ct value difference within a range of -1.36 to +1.59
when compared to individual (non-pooled) testing. Negative and positive values of Ct
indicates higher and lower sensitivity of pooling, respectively. All 2X ratio pools were
positive, with Ct value difference within a range of -1.72 to +1.81 when compared to
individual (non-pooled) testing (Table 1). Statistical paired t-test was calculated to compare
the Ct value differences between pooled (including all patterns in Figure 1) and individual
tests. The result showed no significant difference in all comparisons including individual vs
1X L ratio pool (p = 0.853), or individual vs 1X H ratio pool (p = 0.921). The 2X pooling ratio
showed similar results. There were no significant difference between the Ct values of
individual testing vs ratio pools 2X L+L, 2X H+L, or 2x H+H (p = 0.063, 0.507, and 0.6766,
respectively). Thus, sensitivity was not affected by pooling specimens, regardless of viral
load, while accuracy was maintained.

Cost effectiveness of the pooling strategy was calculated, based on varying disease
prevalence rates (0.1-10%) (Table 2). Pooling appears most cost-effective when testing
among populations with lower COVID-19 prevalence. Estimated laboratory costs were
reduced from $35 per patient to $3.85, $6.85, $17.54, $26.30 at prevalences of COVID-19 in
the tested population of 0.1%, 1, 5%, and 10% respectively. By this estimation, pooledspecimen testing of 1,000,000 subjects in a population with 1% COVID-19 prevalence would
save approximately $28.15 million, assuming evenly distributed positive specimens in each
pool (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that pooling specimens does not compromise the sensitivity of
detecting SARS-CoV-2, regardless of viral load. The lowest viral concentration used in this
study was at Ct 35.49 which was detected from both pooled and individual testing. Ct value
more than 35 was considered weakly positive, and the effect of pooling on these samples
will need to be further studied. In 2X ratio pooling, RT PCR testing detected higher viral
concentrations (lower PCR Ct) compared to those of the corresponding positive specimens
when tested individually. This suggests that pooling specimens did not lower the sensitivity
of PCR testing but actually increased the viral concentration when more than one positive
sample was present in the same pool which combined the viral amount from 2 samples in
the same extraction tube. The nucleic extraction system used in this study allowed nucleic
acid extraction from 1.0 mL of NT specimens without reducing the sensitivity as compared
to 0.1 mL of individual extraction. Further, similar PCR Ct values (within +/- 2 Ct; statistically
not significant) between pooled and non-pooled specimens indicated there was no
interference of PCR inhibitor from 1.0 mL pooled specimens in one extraction tube.

Beyond maintaining accuracy, specimen pooling will almost certainly reduce cost. For
example, if 1% of the population is infected, pooling 10 specimens can reduce the cost of
laboratory operation by about 80% (Table 2). However, in the case of 10% prevalence,
pooling specimens will only save 24.87%, as positive pooled samples will need to be
individually tested. Thus, this is especially useful in areas with low prevalence rates, or when
conducting pro-active surveillance in areas of low infection rate. Proactive surveillance,
particularly in asymptomatic cases, remains a challenge to overcome in order to exit
lockdown, where screening on a massive scale is required.

A previous study found that pooling at ratio of 1 to 5 (50 μL of each specimen for total of
250 μL pooled extraction) retained accuracy of the test and resulted in greater efficiency of
test resources10 as well as demonstrating that when the prevalence of COVID-19 is 1%, the
optimal specimen pool size is 11 with an overall increase in testing efficiency calculated at
400%. In this study, a 10-specimen pool size (100 μL each specimen) was chosen based on
the capacity of the RNA extraction system in the laboratory where this study was
performed, and the result was similar to 5 samples pooling10.

A limitation of this study is the maximum number of two positive specimens in the 10specimen pool. In theory, more positive specimens in a pool could decrease the sensitivity
of qPCR as it would result in too many viral copies, causing an insufficiency of PCR enzyme
and other reagents in the mix to amplify all the viral copies. Practically, however, this does
not affect the overall testing results, since positive pools would require individual testing in
any case.

Rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. The
current gold standard for testing SARS-CoV-2 is real-time PCR, which requires resources that
are currently limited, along with specialized equipment and technically skilled labor.
Shortage of testing reagents and equipment in countries where there is no capability to
produce their own tests may result in delays in testing and result in reduced effectiveness in
containing the outbreak. Pooled specimen testing would enable substantial savings in
reagent costs, technical burden and time to generate laboratory results.
