Abstract

33

SARS-CoV-2 infection of children leads to a mild illness and the immunological differences

34

with adults remains unclear. We quantified the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in

35

adults and children (<13 years of age) with RT-PCR confirmed asymptomatic and

36

symptomatic infection for long-term memory, phenotype and polyfunctional cytokines.

37

Acute and memory CD4+ T cell responses to structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins significantly

38

increased with age, whilst CD8+ T cell responses increased with time post infection.

39

Infected children had significantly lower CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2

40

structural and ORF1ab proteins compared to infected adults. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T

41

cell responses were comparable in magnitude to uninfected negative adult controls. In

42

infected adults CD4+ T cell specificity was skewed towards structural peptides, whilst

43

children had increased contribution of ORF1ab responses. This may reflect differing T cell

44

compartmentalisation for antigen processing during antigen exposure or lower recruitment

45

of memory populations. T cell polyfunctional cytokine production was comparable between

46

children and adults, but children had a lower proportion of SARS-CoV-2 CD4+ T cell

47

effector memory. Compared to adults, children had significantly lower levels of antibodies

48

to β-coronaviruses, indicating differing baseline immunity. Total T follicular helper

49

responses was increased in children during acute infection indicating rapid co-ordination of

50

the T and B cell responses. However total monocyte responses were reduced in children

51

which may be reflective of differing levels of inflammation between children and adults.

52

Therefore, reduced prior β-coronavirus immunity and reduced activation and recruitment of

53

de novo responses in children may drive milder COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Introduction

55

A lack of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specifc protective antibodies has led to the rapid global

56

spread of the novel coronavirus, however the large majority of infections are reportedly

57

asymptomatic or mild (Ing et al., 2020). Previous COVID-19 infection may protect from

58

reinfection (Addetia et al., 2020, Lumley et al., 2020) and neutralizing antibodies are likely

59

to play an important protective role (Chandrashekar et al., 2020). However, the emergence

60

of variant strains (e.g. 501Y.V2) suggests the possibility of escape from previous

61

neutralizing antibody (Greaney et al., 2020, Cele et al., 2021). Antibody based treatment of

62

established infection has had minimal beneficial effect on clinical outcome in COVID-19

63

patients (Weinreich et al., 2020) and may lead to emergence of escape mutant variants

64

(Kemp et al., 2020). Dysregulated innate immune responses, such as auto-interferon

65

antibodies or delayed responsiveness has been reported in some severe COVID-19 cases

66

but cannot account for the majority of severe infections (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020, Chen et

67

al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020). Importantly, a coordinated cellular immune response has

68

been key to clinical resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Rydyznski Moderbacher et al.,

69

2020).

70

Pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies elicited by exposure to endemic human

71

common cold coronaviruses such as the related β-coronavirus OC43 and HKU-1, do not

72

prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Anderson et al., 2020, Edridge et al., 2020).

73

Furthermore, pre-existing cross-reactive T cell immunity generated by common cold

74

coronaviruses has also been detected in the majority of people (Tan et al., 2021), with

75

epitope conservation mostly reported in the ORF1ab non-structural proteins (Grifoni et al.,

76

2020), but SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cell responses have also been detected despite

77

lower (<67%) epitope homology (Mateus et al., 2020). Upon infection, T cell responses

78

shift towards Spike and Nucleocapsid structural proteins (Le Bert et al., 2020, Mateus et

79

al., 2020). However, cross-reactive CD4+ T cell responses have been reported as similar

80

(Mateus et al., 2020) or lower avidity and may be associated with worsening clinical

81

outcomes (Bacher et al., 2020). In animal models of re-infection, Spike-specific CD8+ T cell

82

responses can compensate for inadequate antibody responses and may provide an

83

immune correlate of protection (McMahan et al., 2020). The magnitude of ORF1ab specific

84

SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses during infection of adults does not differ with symptom

85

severity but does associate with reduced duration of illness (Le Bert et al., 2020).

86

Therefore, determining the balance and specificity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell

87

responses for structural, accessory and non-structural proteins may inform the COVID-19

88

response and pathogenesis.

89

Following mild COVID-19 infection SARS-CoV-2 specific memory B cells are

90

established for at least 6 months with long-term stability that may be recruited upon

91

reinfection (Rodda et al., 2021). T cells following SARS-CoV infection in 2003 have

92

reassuringly been detected 17 years after infection (Le Bert et al., 2020). Robust adaptive

93

antibody and T cell responses have been reported in symptomatic and asymptomatic

94

SARS-CoV-2 infected adults (Long et al., 2020, Sekine et al., 2020). Although serum

95

antibody response to the common cold coronaviruses maybe long lasting, reinfection is

96

common one or more years after infection (Edridge et al., 2020). The severity of COVID-19

97

may be reduced by rapid and early recruitment of established immune responses

98

(Thevarajan et al., 2020, Chan et al., 2020, Tosif et al., 2020). The early and rapid

99

recruitment of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (Juno et al., 2020) drives early antibody

100

development (Thevarajan et al., 2020) by germinal B cell responses leading to increasing

101

neutralising antibody titers, however increased disease severity is associated with higher

102

viral loads and antibody titers (Le Bert et al., 2020). The magnitude of the acute T cell

103

responses in Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a related β-coronavirus, is

104

negatively associated with the magnitude of the CD4+ T cell response and the duration of

105

illness and thus antigen loads (Mok et al., 2020, Zhao et al., 2017).

106

In a small family case study, children (n=3) exposed to their SARS-CoV-2 infected

107

parents displayed a coordinated recruitment of total T cells and specific antibodies however

108

infection was not able to be virologically confirmed (Tosif et al., 2020). Asymptomatic

109

infection may represent a large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly in

110

children. The immunological differences of cellular recruitment for children and adults has

111

not been sufficiently characterised to determine the immunological basis of differing

112

diseases severity and outcomes of COVID-19.

113

In Hong Kong, effective public health measures of track, trace, quarantine of

114

returned travellers and testing of quarantined close contacts has led to the identification of

115

RT-PCR confirmed asymptomatic infections, even in young children. In this study, we

116

assessed the balance of specificity, memory phenotype, cytokine quality and longitudinal

117

stability of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses in children (aged 2-13 years old) and adults with

118

asymptomatic or symptomatic infection to address the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of

119

milder disease in children.

Materials and Methods

121

Study population and clinical samples

122

Our study used samples from 24 children and 45 adults with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-

123

CoV-2 infection in Hong Kong (Table 1). The days after onset of symptoms (for

124

symptomatic infections) and days after first RT-PCR confirmation (for asymptomatic

125

infections) was noted. All symptomatic or asymptomatic RT-PCR confirmed infections were

126

hospitalized. Heparinised blood was collected at hospital admission (range: 1-14 days post

127

symptom onset and/or RT-PCR confirmed infection), at discharge (range: 6-60 days) and

128

at regular intervals after discharge for convalescent and long-term memory (range: 61-180

129

days) (Figure 1A). We used samples from a total of 45 adults (mean±stdev: 43.1±13.7,

130

range: 20-65 years) and 24 children (8.1±3.9, 1.92 (23 months)-13 years). We had 95

131

longitudinal samples from 46 subjects with 2 to 3 sampling time-points and 55 early acute

132

time-points samples (< day 14) (Figure 1A). Samples of comparable time-points were used

133

from children (32.5±40.4, 2-138 days) and adults (28.9±39.6, 1-180 days) (Table 1).

134

The study was approved by the institutional review board of the respective hospitals,

135

viz. Kowloon West Cluster (KW/EX-20-039 (144-27)), Kowloon Central / Kowloon East

136

cluster (KC/KE-20-0154/ER2) and HKU/HA Hong Kong West Cluster (UW 20-273, UW20-

137

169), Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong-New Territories East Cluster Clinical

138

Research Ethics Committee (CREC 2020.229). All of patients provided informed consent.

139

The collection of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative adult negative control blood donors

140

(37.6±13.0, 19-57 years) was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The Hong

141

Kong University and the Hong Kong Island West Cluster of Hospitals (UW16-254).

142

Plasma was isolated, stored at -80oC and heat inactivated (HI) at 56°C for 30

143

minutes upon testing. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by Ficoll-

144

Paque (GE Healthcare) separation using Leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-one) and

145

cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for batched analysis.

SARS-CoV-2 overlapping peptide pools for T cell stimulation

148

An overlapping peptide library was made covering the whole SARS-CoV-2 proteome with

149

20 amino acid (aa) length and 10 aa overlap (Genscript). The amino acid sequence of the

150

peptide pools was based on βCoV/Hong Kong/VM20001061/2020 strain (GISAID ID:

151

EPI_ISL_412028). Peptides were dissolved in deionised water, 10% acetic acid, or DMSO

152

according to their biochemical properties and charge. A pool of 197 peptides representing

153

Structural proteins: from S (1273aa, 127 peptides), N (419aa, 41 peptides), E (75aa, 7

154

peptides), M (222aa, 22 peptides), with a DMSO concentration of 0.6%. The ORF1ab

155

peptide pool consisted of 709 peptides for the NSP1-16 proteins (7096aa), with a DMSO

156

concentration of 2.1%. An accessory peptide pool of 69 peptides for the ORF3a (275aa, 27

157

peptides), ORF3b (43aa, 5 peptides), ORF6 (61aa, 6 peptides), ORF7a (121aa, 12

158

peptides), ORF7b (43aa, 3 peptides), ORF8 (121aa, 12 peptides), ORF10 (43aa, 3

159

peptides) proteins with a DMSO concentration of 0.2% (Figure 1B). Experimental controls

160

included: cytomegalovirus (CMV) peptide pool (Grifoni et al., 2020) and PMA/ionomycin as

161

positive controls, and for negative controls media alone and average DMSO control (1.0%

162

concentration) for background cytokine production (Supplementary Figure 1B). SARS-CoV-

163

2 peptide Megapools (Spike plus all pool, 467 peptides) for predicted MHC restricted

164

peptides covering all proteins of the genome for CD4+ T cells and CMV from Grifoni et al.

Statistical Analysis

205

Statistical analysis was performed on Prism 9 (Graphpad). For two-way comparison, the

206

Wilcoxon signed-rank test (paired) or Mann-Whitney t-test (unpaired) was used. For

207

multiple-group comparisons, a Friedman (paired) or Kruskal-Wallis (unpaired) test, followed

208

by the Dunn-Bonferroni post-hoc test was used. The One sample Wilcoxon signed-rank

209

test was used for comparisons against a hypothetical value for fold changes. Correlations

210

were performed using the Spearman’s test. To account for correlation due to multiple

211

measurements from the same patients, a linear random effects model was fitted

212

(Supplementary table 1). The model also tested the linear time trend by days after illness

213

onset, and potential differences by age, sex and symptomatic patients. Differences were

214

tested using Mann-Whitney test. Differences in baseline characteristics was detected with

215

the chi square test. Adjusted p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

224

Recent infection is associated with an increase of CD4+ T cell responses to

225

structural proteins

226

SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses were assessed from COVID-19 cases in children

227

and adults, and in adult negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 consists of 4 structural proteins, an

228

extensive ORF1ab which encodes 16 non-structural proteins, and 7 accessory proteins.

229

The relative expression of the structural proteins versus accessory and non-structural

230

proteins during SARS-CoV-2 virus replication may impact their immunogenicity. Cross-

231

reactivity with common cold viruses (Edridge et al., 2020) may also affect the magnitude of

232

T cell responses elicited. Due to limited cell numbers of our samples, peptide or protein

233

specific mapping was not possible. Therefore direct ex vivo CD4+ and CD8+ T cell

234

responses were assessed for overlapping peptide pools of structural, accessory and

235

ORF1ab proteins respectively, (Figure 1B) using IFNγ production, a key anti-viral cytokine

236

as a read-out for specificity (Figure 1C). Paired samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected adults

237

at hospital admission (time 1) and discharge (time 2) showed an increase in structural

238

specific IFNγ+ CD4+ T cells (Figure 1DF, fold change p=0.0005) and to a lesser extent

239

CD8+ T cells (Figure 1EF, fold change p=0.0230).

240

The magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ (Figure 1E) and CD8+ (Figure 1F) T

241

cells for structural, accessory and ORF1ab proteins was compared between adult patients

242

versus adult negative controls to establish assay specificity and cross-reactivity. We then

243

compared the T cell responses of the adult infections versus paediatric infections to define

244

differences with age. The IFNγ+ CD4+ T cell responses towards structural proteins of

245

SARS-CoV-2 were significantly increased in adults (mean±stdev: 0.0533±0.0549%),

246

compared to both children (0.0240±0.0292%, p=0.0031) and adult negative controls

247

(0.0013±0.0005%, p<0.01) (Figure 1G). The majority of infected adults (94.3%) mounted a

248

structural-specific CD4+ T cell responses (above DMSO background) (Figure 1I), whilst

249

only 79.4% of children and 50% of adult negative controls had such responses (Figure 1I).

children, the proportion of responders against each peptide pool was not significantly

252

different between adults and children, except for structural CD8+ responses (Figure 1I).

253

Therefore, the majority of our later analyses focusses on structural specific T cell

254

responses.

255

The accessory-specific CD4+ T cell response was comparable in infected children,

256

infected adults and adult negative controls (Figure 1G). In infected adults, the structural-

257

protein-specific CD4+ T cell responses (86.6%) contributed most to the SARS-CoV-2

258

specific response (Figure 1J), than ORF1ab (9.6%) and accessory (3.8%) responses. By

259

contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 specific response in infected children’s CD4+ T cell responses

260

were dominated more by ORF1ab (51.8%) than structural specific responses (43.7%).

261

Responses from adult negative controls that recognised SARS-CoV-2 peptides were

262

predominately specific for accessory peptides (90.1%), however the total response was

263

very low in magnitude, at only 0.013±0.02% of CD4+ T cells (Figure 1J).

264

Infected adults did not have significantly higher CD8+ T cell responses compared to

265

adult negative controls (Figure 1H) indicating cross-reactivity and little amplification of

266

SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cell responses by infection (Figure 1EF). But infected children had

267

significantly reduced CD8+ T cell responses compared to infected adults for structural and

268

ORF1ab responses (Figure 1H).

269

However baseline differences exist between adults and children for non-specific T

270

cell activation (Lewis et al., 1991, Rudolph et al., 2018, Booth et al., 2014). The baseline

271

activation (by DMSO) and overall maximum activation (by PMA/ionomycin) is lower in

272

children, and responsiveness significantly increased with age (Supplementary Figure 2 A-

273

D). Adult negative controls had comparable background IFNγ induction compared to

274

infected adults (Supplementary Figure 2A), However, the maximum responses by

275

PMA/ionomycin was lower in CD4+ T cells and higher in CD8+ T cells in negative control

276

adults compared to infected adults (Supplementary Figure 2B), which may indicate T cell

277

activation is refractory based on recent infection (Crawford et al., 2013). Normalisation of

278

structural specific T cells by % of maximum PMA/ionomycin responses shows comparable

279

responses across all groups (Supplementary Figure 2F). However the fine specificity of

280

identifying low frequency antigen specific T cells is obscured, therefore T cell responses

281

should be considered directly ex vivo with background subtracted not normalised for

282

maximum activation. There was a significant correlation between PMA/ionomycin and

283

structural specific CD4+ T cell IFNγ production (r=0.6384, p=0.0001, Supplementary Figure

284

2G), but not CD8+ T cell responses (r=0.2568, p=0.1707, Supplementary Figure 2H).

285

Furthermore, stratification of subjects for asymptomatic and symptomatic infection

286

did not reveal any further significant differences for T cell response magnitude

287

(Supplementary Figure 3AB) or contribution of peptide specificities (Supplementary Figure

288

3CD) between controls and COVID-19 adults and children.

289
290

Recruitment of early cellular responses

291

Coordination of the early acute response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is important to drive

292

innate responses (Zhang et al., 2021), and early antibody production (Thevarajan et al.,

293

2020) for improved patient outcomes. Therefore, we assessed the recruitment and

294

activation of monocytes, total Tfh cells and plasmablasts (also known as antibody

295

producing cells) during acute (<14 days post infection) SARS-CoV-2 infection

296

(Supplementary Figure 4). The total monocytes showed reduced responses in children

297

compared to infected adults (Supplementary Figure 4B), furthermore children had reduced

298

inflammatory type monocytes (Supplementary Figure 4C), where these have been found to

299

also be elevated in COVID-19 patients, but lower in severe outcomes in adults (Zhang et

300

al., 2021, Mann et al., 2020). Meanwhile, infected children and adults showed comparable

301

levels of monocyte recruitment from bone marrow (CCR2) compared to infected adults

302

(Supplementary Figure 4D).

303

The coordinated recruitment of circulating Tfh for germinal centre reactions and

304

early antibody production by plasmablasts is associated with seroconversion (Pilkinton et

305

al., 2017). The early activated (ICOS+ PD-1+) total Tfh response was significantly increased

306

in infected children compared to adults and negative controls (Supplementary Figure 4G),

307

whilst plasmablast responses were increased in both children and adults compared to

308

negative controls showing B cell recruitment with infection (Supplementary Figure 4H).

309
310

T cell responses increase with time post infection and age

311

Longitudinal sample collection up to 180 days post infection enabled us to determine the

312

trend of T cell responses with time post infection. Long-term stability of durable T cell

313

immunity is likely important to minimise the symptom severity of reinfection with SARS-

314

CoV-2. The CD4+ T cell response to structural peptides had stable responses post infection

315

(Figure 2A) (r=0.1475, p=0.2265), whilst structure specific CD8+ T cell responses had a

316

moderate significant trend for increased responses with time (Figure 2B) (r=0.4194,

317

p=0.0003). This was also reflected in the acute fold changes of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell

318

responses (Figure 1F), which indicates the CD4+ T cell response is recruited early during

319

SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1D), the CD8+ T cell response takes more time to build up

320

with time post-infection. Furthermore, there was no difference in T cell exhaustion (by PD-1

321

expression) between infected adults and children at either acute or memory responses

322

(Supplementary Figure 5).

323

The fold change of response magnitude for paired acute responses (<14 days) to

324

memory time-points (>14 days) (Figure 2CD), showed comparable fold-changes in children

325

and adults for CD4+ or CD8+ T cell response to most viral proteins. Only accessory-specific

326

CD8+ T cell responses had a significant decrease in infected children (Figure 2D). Whilst

327

the acute structural specific CD4+ T cell response was significantly increased in adults

328

compared to negative controls (Figure 2E), the memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response

329

were significantly lower in children compared to infected adults (Figure 2EH), resulting in a

330

trend for significantly increased T cell responses with age (Figure 2FIJ), excluding acute

331

CD8+ T cell responses (Figure 2G).

332

The difference in magnitude of T cell responses with age and time indicates

333

functional differences in T cell recruitment and differentiation, therefore we assessed

334

cytokine polyfunctionality and memory phenotypes. Cytokine polyfunctionality is associated

335

with increased protection from infection for multiple viruses (Lichterfeld et al., 2004, Sridhar

336

et al., 2013), and associated with cellular division and terminal differentiation (Denton et al.,

337

2011). Whilst differentiation of T cell memory phenotypes occurs early during infection and

338

can reflect the extent of inflammation (Kretschmer et al., 2020), impacting recall capacity

339

long-term (Kinjyo et al., 2015) to infected tissues (Weninger et al., 2001).

340

Cytokine polyfunctionality of structure-specific T cells (Figure 3AB) was comparable

341

between adults and children at acute (<14 days), convalescent (15-60 days) or memory

342

(61-180 days) time points (Figure 3C), therefore on a per cell basis adults and children had

343

comparable cytokine responses. The phenotype of structure-specific T cells at memory

344

time points (Figure 3D), however showed that children had reduced T effector memory

345

(TEM) CD4+ T cells compared to infected adults (Figure 3E). The phenotype of structure-

346

specific CD8+ T cells was comparable (Figure 3F).

348

Prior common cold coronavirus immunity and cellular responses

349

The level of coronavirus Spike-specific IgG was determined at early time points (<14 days)

350

of SARS-CoV-2 infection, to determine if pre-existing immunity impacted T cell responses.

351

The magnitude of α-coronavirus 229E and NL63-specific IgG was comparable between

352

infected children and adults and adult negative controls (Figure 4A), whilst β-coronavirus

353

HKU-1 and OC43-specific IgG was significantly lower in infected children than infected

354

adults (Figure 4B). Furthermore, there was no difference in OC43-IgG responses between

355

symptomatic or asymptomatic infections, with significance only being seen between

356

symptomatic adults and children (Figure 4C). There was a significant correlation of OC43-

14

357

IgG responses with age (Figure 4D) (r=0.6466, p=0.0002). However there was no direct

358

significant correlation between OC43-IgG responses and structure-specific CD4+

359

(p=0.1027, Figure 4E) or CD8+ T cells (p=0.9729, Figure 4F). Similar trends of a lack of

360

significant correlation were seen for HKU-1 IgG responses and acute CD4+ T cell

361

responses (r=0.3085, p=0.1034, data not shown), despite other reports in uninfected adults

362

(Tan et al., 2021). However, there was a borderline moderate negative correlation between

363

OC43-IgG and early acute activated Tfh responses (Figure 4G) (r=-0.3310, p=0.0854).

364
365

Discussion

366

SARS-CoV-2 infection of children is associated with milder clinical outcomes than adults,

367

and the immune mechanisms are unknown. Several immune mechanism have been

368

proposed to explain these differences such as innate cell recruitment and impairment by

369

autoantibodies (Wang et al., 2020), mobilisation of antibody responses, differing levels of

370

pre-existing cross-reactive immunity by common cold coronavirus exposure (Anderson et

371

al., 2020) or baseline total IgM levels (Selva et al., 2020). However, the SARS-CoV-2 T cell

372

compartment in children has so far been under studied (Tosif et al., 2020). Viral loads

373

(Jones et al., 2020) and neutralising antibody titers (Weisberg et al., 2021, Lau et al., 2021)

374

are reportedly comparable when age is accounted for, however data is more limited in

375

children. Viral loads, neutralising antibody titers (Garcia-Beltran et al., 2020), and T cell

376

responses (Peng et al., 2020) impact clinical severity of COVID-19.

377

Cross-reactive T cell responses in unexposed adults have been mapped to have

378

been NSPs of ORF1ab and Spike (Grifoni et al., 2020), whilst recent infection boosts

379

structural Spike and N specific T cells (Le Bert et al., 2020, Mateus et al., 2020). The

380

specificity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody landscapes differs in infected children to adults

381

(Weisberg et al., 2021, Hachim et al., 2021), with an increased contribution by accessory

382

proteins (Hachim et al., 2021), whilst the ORF1ab response is under characterised. SARS-

383

CoV-2 antibody landscapes indicate that the specificity and balance of the adaptive

384

immune responses in children is different to adults. We sought to determine the balance of

385

SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in adults and children as infection progresses to

386

recovery for long-term memory, whilst considering T cell specificity for the virion (structural

387

proteins) and virus replication (ORF1ab and accessory proteins) as a surrogate for viral

388

replication and pathogenesis.

389

Overall, we found total IFNγ CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are significantly lower

390

in SARS-CoV-2 infected children than adults against the viral structural proteins, and in

391

CD8+ T cells against ORF1ab proteins. Whilst there were no negative control PBMCs

392

available in our study from uninfected children for direct comparison as it is difficult to

393

obtain blood from healthy children, pairwise comparison between infected adults and

394

children showed markedly different SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses. However, we and

395

others (Lewis et al., 1991, Chipeta et al., 1998, Rudolph et al., 2018, Booth et al., 2014),

396

found that the capacity of children’s T cells to respond to polyclonal non-specific activation

397

is also lower. Whereas vaccination with live influenza vaccines boosts T cell responses in

398

children and not adults (He et al., 2006), this may be due to differences in prior immunity

399

through infection (Shannon et al., 2019), resulting in qualitative differences in antigen

400

experienced CD4+ T cell responses in children. As IFNγ T cell induction increases with age,

401

so does exposure to viruses. Therefore the differences in SARS-CoV-2 T cell magnitude

402

may be due to inherent differences between children and adult T cell threshold for

403

activation. This has different consequences in different scenarios of a pandemic virus

404

compared to vaccination building on prior memory. For example, there is an increased fold

405

change of children’s T cell responses compared to adults during live attenuated influenza

406

vaccination (He et al., 2006), whilst we found lower SARS-CoV-2 T cell response

407

magnitudes in children, their fold changes and polyfunctional cytokines of the T cell

408

responses was comparable between adults and children. Therefore there is equal

409

recruitment of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses in adults and children but likely different

410

baseline levels of cross-reactive responses to recruit from and inherent differences in

411

thresholds of activation.

412

A difference in T cell memory phenotypes showed greater bias towards T cell

413

effector memory in adults compared to children. Along with total response and

414

polyfunctional cytokine production, this indicates that on a per T cell basis the T cell

415

response in children is less antigen experienced and matured than adults, and may be due

416

to different levels of prior immunity to seasonal human coronaviruses. This was also found

417

by smaller magnitude memory T cell responses in children than adults, which may imply a

418

weaker long-term memory response in children potentially impacting outcomes at

419

reinfection. Indeed, we found significantly lower levels of β-coronavirus specific antibodies

420

in infected children than adults, and there was a significant trend for both increased SARS-

421

CoV-2 specific T cell responses and OC43-specific IgG with increasing age. Recently,

422

similar results were found in healthy adults as HKU-1 IgG showed an increasing trend with

423

SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses of memory phenotype in uninfected adults (Tan et

424

al., 2021). A borderline trend for decreasing acute activated Tfh with higher OC43-specific

425

IgG levels also suggests a greater importance CD4+ T cell recruitment in more

426

immunologically naïve settings, and as β-coronavirus specific IgG levels increase there is a

427

decreasing drive for Tfh recruitment. Only the quantification of baseline T cell responses

428

specific for common cold viruses and subsequent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in further

429

studies, such as in human cohort transmission settings or animal models, will determine if

430

prior β-coronavirus immunity, based on T or B cells, has a protective role in COVID-19.

431

The quality of T cell responses, assessed by SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell

432

polyfunctional cytokine production, was equivalent between children and adults, reflecting

433

division and terminal differentiation. Furthermore, T cell exhaustion, assessed by

434

expression of PD-1 is higher in COVID-19 patients with expression increasing with severity

435

(Diao et al., 2020). While we also see differences in infected and negative adults, infected

436

adults and children have equivalent PD-1 levels on T cells. Therefore, whilst SARS-CoV-2

437

specific T cell responses in children are reduced they comparably activated/exhausted (by

438

PD-1 expression). The matched quality of response but higher threshold for IFNγ

439

production by T cells in children may drive a less inflammatory environment that promotes

440

more mild outcomes in children. Lower levels of total and inflammatory monocytes, may

441

further contribute to a less inflammatory environment. However paradoxically lower

442

inflammatory monocytes are associated with both healthy individuals and patients with

443

severe COVID-19 infections (Mann el al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021), therefore the timing of

444

monocyte recruitment is likely important. There was a different recruitment of innate and

445

adaptive cellular responses in adults and children during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Children

446

had increased Tfh recruitment, comparable plasmablast responses, but reduced

447

monocytes, specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, in both magnitude and proportion of

448

responders. The inflammatory milieu is likely drivers of innate and adaptive cell recruitment,

449

and indicates differences between adults and children across the anti-viral immune

450

response.

451

T cell responses can be quantified by numerous methods besides IFNγ induction by

452

peptide stimulation as adopted in our study, such as proliferation (Ki67) and activation

453

induced markers (AIM, such as 41-BB/CD40L, OX40, CD25 etc) (Grifoni et al., 2020),

454

antigen experience (CD69, CD44), or the production Th2 cytokines such as IL-4. In

455

addition to functional assays, T cell responses can be quantified by T cell receptor binding

456

to cognate peptide MHC by dimer/tetramers (Peng et al., 2020). However, known SARS-

457

CoV-2 epitopes are currently limited and the HLA should be defined within donors. The

458

induction of AIM for Tfh responses and the CD4+ T cell profile across different cell types

459

(Th17, Treg etc), should also be assessed in future studies. We found that children had

460

increased activated Tfh responses but lower IFNγ+ CD4+ T cells, therefore the CD4+ T cell

461

compartment is modulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and more so than the CD8+ T cell

462

response which is lagging behind the acute stage. In addition more variables can be

463

assessed by high dimensional flow cytometry or RNAseq approaches, and further

464

mechanistic studies are needed to define the basis of immunological differences between T

465

cell responses of children and adults indicated in our study.

466

Adult negative controls had significantly lower structural/ORF1ab CD4+ T cell

467

responses but comparable CD8+ T cell responses to infected adults. This was also

468

reflected in greater CD4+ T cell increases at acute timepoints of infection, and delayed

469

CD8+ T cell increases with time, indicating CD4+ T cell responses play a greater role in the

470

early responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The contribution of different virion structural and

471

non-structural proteins reflects MHC processing access during viral replication, whereby

472

MHCII access to structural proteins elicited substantial CD4+ T cell responses in adults, in

473

children the CD4+ T cell response was predominantly ORF1ab specific. The imbalance of

474

peptide specificities for non-structural proteins for children’s CD4+ T cell compartment may

475

indicate either different virus replication and pathogenesis at the cellular level or incomplete

476

recruitment of de novo CD4+ T cell responses. Previously, in MERS-CoV infection, the

477

magnitude of the CD4+ T cell response is proportional to virus replication and duration of

478

illness (Zhao et al., 2017). This is consistent with the mild outcomes of COVID-19 in

479

children and reduced T cell responses reported here in our study of mild and asymptomatic

480

SARS-CoV-2 infection. We cannot attribute the differences in T cell response magnitude

481

with severity of illness in children to adults, unlike others reports (Peng et al., 2020), as the

482

majority of both infections we studied are mild or asymptomatic. Therefore children have

483

reduced SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses due to lower baseline immune activation, and

484

further research is still needed to discern the protective role of T cells in COVID-19.
