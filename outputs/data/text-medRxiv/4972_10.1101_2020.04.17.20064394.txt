Abstract
Although there are some recent studies which intent to address the spread of respiratory
droplets through the air, these correspond to indoor conditions or outdoor situations which not
take into account realistic scenario. Less attention has been paid to the spread of respiratory
droplets in outdoor environments under microclimatologic turbulent wind and which is of
growing importance given the current COVID-19 epidemic. We implement a computational
model describing a sneezing person in an urban scenario under a medium intensity
climatological wind. Turbulence was described with a wall-modeled Large Eddy Simulation
model and the spread of respiratory droplets by using a lagrangian approach. Results show
the spread of respiratory droplets is characterized by the dynamics of two groups of droplets
of different sizes: larger droplets (400 – 900 μm) are spread between 2–5 m during 2.3 s while
smaller (100 – 200 μm) droplets are transported a larger range between 8–11 m by the action
of the turbulent wind in 14.1 s average. Given the uncertainty of potential contagion over this
way and with this reach, these efforts are an intent to contribute to shine a light on the
possibility of adopting stricter self-care and distancing measures.
Introduction
David Heymann, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who was one of
the leaders during the SARS outbreak and public health expert said a few weeks ago that the
propagation of COVID-19 in open spaces was one of the important unknowns yet to be
realised [1].
The world health organisation (WHO) has communicated recently that for COVID-19 there is
no evidence strong enough to adopt measures against the aero-transported contagion. This
is, by droplets in the air smaller than 5-10 μm as aerosol, exhaled during breathing or normal
speech [2], with exception of close-contact cases, as for care-takers and direct contact with
infected persons at a close range (less than 1 meter). Its general recommendations, and thus
from several governments and health agencies, is to keep a distance of at least 1 meter from
persons who are coughing or sneezing [3]. The discussion about precautionary measures is
indeed important, since it might affect the steps taken to order the free or restricted circulation
of people in public places and to minimize contagion, including the use of masks, among
others. Within the scientific community there is a lack of consensus, and some opinions are
controverted. There have been detections of RNA material further apart from the closer radius,
and there is a lack of experiments and systematic trials to determine this fact with more
precision, for instance, to see if the amount of material found might account for an effective
infectious potential [2,4].This takes the discussion further, meaning not only to the scientific
community but also to politics and public policy, where precautionary measures can be
essential. This study is a consequence of the analysis of scientific literature and news reported
by WHO and scientific journals. As a team specialized on the modelling and simulation of fluid
flow we could describe and predict some condition related with the spread of respiratory
droplets
in order to shine a light on one part of the discussion and collaborate to validate or

The velocity of the exhaled flux of air during sneeze is much higher than in other processes as
breathing or even coughing [6,7]. A sneeze exhales more than a million droplets up to a
distance of 3 meters. However, the concentration of droplets at 1 meter of distance from its
source is reduced down to 0,001% [6], which coincides with the mentioned distancing
recommendations of the WHO [2]. Nevertheless, due to Stokes’ drag, the smaller droplets (<
5–10 μm) stay suspended in the air for prolonged periods of time, situation that might
eventually conduce to aero-transported transmission. [2,6]. On the other hand, out of 75,465
cases of COVID-19 analysed in China, none of them was attributed directly to this mechanism
[2,5]. Specialists from China and the United Kingdom have said that the probability of
contracting the virus this way is not completely negligible and that further studies are necessary
[4]. The World Health Organisation has emitted an official statement about this situation [2].
However, it has been often misinterpreted by the media. That there is no aero-transported
transmission does not mean that the virus transmitted over the air cannot be a carrier of the
disease, for instance, in an urban microclimatologic scenario. From the literature and
information, we have analysed, this fact has not been explored thoroughly.
Simulations
Our predictive research was performed using a simulation of the dispersion of polydisperse
droplets (multi-dimensional) exhaled during a sneeze in a microclimatologic urban scenario,
using a model based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Anthropometric variables like
exposed oral and nasal area, as airflow, volume fraction and diameter distribution of droplets,
and time of duration of sneeze under analysis were taken from the literature [6,7,10]. The
microclimatologic scenario related to wind was defined according to [8,9] and they represent
a medium intensity including its attenuation respect to the difference between the average
velocity magnitude measured in the periphery and the urban nucleus of cities. The turbulence
of the microclimatologic wind was simulated using a wall-modeled Large Eddy Simulation. The
dispersion of droplets and its interaction with the velocity field was described using a
lagrangian approach. The diameter distribution was modeled by a Rosin-Rammler function.
These are relevant technical steps towards realistic outdoor conditions.

Results
Our results (see Figure 1 and on-line video1) indicate that the effect of microclimate is very
relevant over the propagation of droplets, where dispersion is enhanced by the turbulent wind.
In an urban sector under wind of moderate intensity, the respiratory droplets of bigger size (400900 μm) and to which the capability of transmitting the disease because of the amount of
Virus material they contain, are transported up to a distance of 5 meters. This happens in a
short period of time (2.3 s) due to their higher momentum, while the smaller droplets (100-200
μm) can be transported to an even higher distance, reaching an average up to 11 meters in
14.1 s, referential distances are seen in the Figure 1. This is several times over typical
precautionary recommendations. In relation to the different analysed contexts, models and

measurements performed until now, they include typically indoor conditions or outdoor
environments without taking into account the action of turbulent wind [11,12,13]. Although
these allow one to get an idea of the dynamics, they are different from a realistic outdoor
condition, where human circulation tends to be more unconcerned or unaware with respect
to its adverse effects, and might cause a faulty sense of safety.
Conclusions
Our results have allowed us to observe that in different urban zones, under standard
microclimatologic conditions, the reach of particles exhaled by a sneezing person and
available to be transported by the turbulent wind can be more than 3 times higher than the
recommended precautionary distances suggested during the present COVID-19 pandemic.
These results represent an everyday urban situation based on the simulated realistic scenario.
Given the uncertainty of potential contagion over this way and with this reach, these efforts
are an intent to contribute to shine a light on the possibility of adopting stricter self-care and
distancing measures. Nevertheless, in order to determine the real contagion risk related to a
certain range of particle diameter at the mentioned distances, infectiology studies have to be
performed [3]. This might be difficult because they imply performing tests on living persons or
other approaches that are beyond the direct focus of the present study.
