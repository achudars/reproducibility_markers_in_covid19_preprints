Abstract

23

Abundant secretory IgA (sIgA) in mucus, breast milk, and saliva provides immunity that

24

prevents infection of mucosal surfaces. sIgA in pre-pandemic breast milk samples have

25

been reported to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, but whether it also occurs in saliva and,

26

if so, whether it cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2, has remained unknown. We aimed to

27

clarify whether sIgA in saliva cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 subunit in

28

individuals who have not been infected with this virus. The study included 137 (male, n

29

= 101; female, n = 36; mean age, 38.7 [24–65] years) of dentists and doctors in the

30

Kanagawa Dental University Hospital. Saliva and blood samples were analyzed by PCR

31

and immunochromatography for IgG and IgM, respectively. We then identified patients

32

with saliva samples that were confirmed as PCR- and IgM-negative for COVID-19.

33

Proportions of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive IgA-positive individuals were determined by

34

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a biotin-labeled spike S1-mFc recombinant

35

protein covering the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of SARS-

36

CoV-2 cross-reactive IgA-positive individuals was 46.7%, and this correlated negatively

with age (r = -0.218, p = 0.01). The proportion of IgA-positive individuals ≥ 50 y was

38

significantly lower than that of patients aged ≤ 49 y (p = 0.008). sIgA was purified from

39

the saliva of all patients, and the salivary sIgA was found to suppress the binding of

40

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the ACE-2 receptor. We found SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive

41

sIgA in the saliva of some participants who had never been infected with the virus,

42

suggesting that sIgA helps prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction

45

Secretory IgA (sIgA) prevents infections through mucosal immunity, which is an aspect

46

of the immune system. sIgA, comprising dimeric IgA, a J chain, and a secretory

47

component, is secreted from glandular tissues such as salivary glands and mammary

48

glands onto mucosal surfaces, where it plays a central role in preventing the entry of

49

antigens from the mucosa [1]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

50

CoV-2) infects humans via the oral and nasal cavities, and the lungs [2]. The squamous

51

cells of the tongue and periodontal tissues express angiotensin-converting enzyme-2

52

(ACE-2), a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, transmembrane protease serin 2 (TMPRSS2), and furin,

53

which are proteases that promote infection [3], and saliva can harbor SARS-CoV-2 [4].

54

Saliva also contains several substances that suppress infection (such as lactoferrin,

55

lysozyme, and sIgA, which is the most abundant) and prevent the virus from entering

56

into the oral cavity [5].

57

Cross-reactive sIgA (CRsA) against SARS-CoV-2 was identified in breast milk before

58

the COVID-19 pandemic [6, 7]. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2–reactive CD4+ T cells were

59

also detected in about 40%–60% of unexposed individuals before the pandemic,

60

suggesting that T cells have cross-reactivity to common cold coronaviruses and SARS-

61

CoV-2 [8]. Later findings [9, 10] suggested that prior infection with a coronavirus creates

62

immunological memory that is associated with sIgA cross-reactivity .

63

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, which manifests with a unique

64

spectrum of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to fatal acute respiratory failure [11].

65

The severity and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection noticeably differs among age

66

groups and countries, respectively [12]. Immune mechanisms might explain this wide

67

disparity, but they are not yet fully understood. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) can eliminate

68

SARS-CoV-2, and vaccine development against this virus is urgently needed [13].

69

However, mucosal immunity conferred by sIgA has not been investigated from the

70

viewpoints of recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection and its prevention. New findings in

71

this area might facilitate deeper understanding of COVID-19 characteristics.

72

Therefore, we aimed to create an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for

73

detecting sIgA that has cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2, and revealed whether it has

74

salivary sIgA that cross-reacts with the SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 subunit for non-infected

75

individuals.

Methods

78

Participant selection

79

We tested saliva and blood samples using PCR and immunochromatography,

80

respectively. Individuals with saliva samples that were confirmed by PCR and IgM

81

testing as negative for COVID-19 were included. The participants included five doctors

82

and 132 dentists at the hospital attached to Kanagawa Dental University. Individuals

83

with IgA nephropathy, selective IgA deficiency, autoimmune diseases, or who had cold-

84

like symptoms within the past 2 weeks were excluded. We analyzed samples from 137

85

(male, n = 101; female, n = 36; mean age, 38.7 [24–65] years) individuals, under the fully

86

informed consent. This study was conducted under the approval of the Kanagawa Dental

87

University Research Ethics Review Board (Approval number: #690). This study was

88

registered in the Japanese clinical trial UMIN-CTR (Approval number: #R000046461)

89

registry, which meets ICMJE standards.

Saliva collection for ELISA

92

We collected samples using Salivettes® (Sarstedt AG & Co. KG, Nümbrecht, Germany)

93

at a fixed room of the hospital between 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. in August 2020, under the

94

infection control. The participants were instructed to refrain from eating, drinking, and

95

brushing their teeth for at least 1 hour before sample collection. The saliva samples were

96

immediately centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 minutes and then stored at -80ºC.

100

We modified the ELISA system that could detect IgA cross-reactivity to influenza

101

viruses using human IgA ELISA quantitation set (#E88-102; Bethyl Laboratories,

102

Montgomery, TX, USA) reported by Yamamoto et al. [14]. Saliva samples was diluted

103

500-fold in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer and incubated for 1 hour at 25℃. Wells were

104

washed five times with wash solution. The antigen used recombinant spike 1-mFc

105

protein (#40591-V05H1; Sino Biological, Beijing, China) comprising the spike 1 subunit

106

with the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. The antigen was

107

labeled with biotin using a kit as described by the manufacturer (#BK01; Dojindo

108

Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). Biotin-labeled Spike 1 were added to a concentration

of 1 µg/mL into wells and incubated for 1 hour at 25℃. Wells were washed five times

110

with wash solution. Next, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (SA202;

111

Millipore, USA; dilution, 1:1000) was used and reacted for 1 hour at 25℃. TMB substrate

112

solution was added for15 mins at 25℃ and reaction was quenched with stop solution.

113

Spike 1 protein-bound IgA was determined at 450 nm using a microplate absorbance

114

reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Background absorbance by the

115

negative control containing PBS was subtracted from the absorbance of all saliva

116

samples.

117
118

IgA purification

119

We purified sIgA using IgA purification kits (#20395; Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K.,

120

Waltham, MA, USA) as described by the manufacturer, then confirmed its molecular

121

weight by standard western blotting using primary anti-human IgA rabbit monoclonal

122

antibodies (ab184863; Abcam Plc, Cambridge, UK) diluted 1:500 and secondary anti-

123

rabbit polyclonal antibodies (#P0448; Dako A/S., Glostrup, Denmark; dilution, 1:1000).

124

ACE-2 binding to spike protein was inhibited by purified sIgA. We selected and

125

pooled the top 20 antibody-positive, and the bottom 20 antibody-negative samples based

126

on the ELISA results. The final concentrations of antibodies in the pooled positive and

was assessed using SARS-CoV-2 spike–ACE-2 binding assay kits (#COV-SACE2-1;

132

RayBiotech, Peachtree Corners, GA, USA), according to the manufacturer. A SARS-CoV-

146

data, age group, gender, BCG vaccination status, hepatitis B vaccination status, and

147

influenza vaccine were examined. Associations with vaccination history were examined

148

using chi-square or Fisher exact tests. We summarized the variables of hepatitis B and

149

influenza vaccines as neither, either, or both to examine associations between the

150

number of vaccinations and IgA positivity or negativity. The variables of BCG, hepatitis

151

B vaccine, and influenza vaccine were summarized as zero, one, two, or three to examine

152

association between the number of vaccinations and IgA positivity or negativity. The

and the spike protein was not inhibited. The CRsA-positive saliva sample had an

191

absorbance of 1.678, and the binding between ACE-2 and spike protein was partially

inhibited.

194

Discussion

195

This study found that 46.7% of saliva samples from 137 participants contained CRsA

196

against SARS-CoV-2 spike 1. The spike 1 region that we examined included the RBD

197

that binds the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE-2. This region is important for preventing

198

infections and could thus be a target for vaccine development [14]. A previous ELISA of

199

SARS-CoV-2 CRsA in breast milk found positivity rates of 100% and 80%, respectively,

200

with the total spike protein and RBD as the antigen [6]. However, the salivary values in

201

the present study were lower than both of these. This might be because more sIgA is

202

produced in breast milk than in saliva [15]. The abundance of CRsA in breast milk is a

203

proven post-vaccination response [16], which could explain why the CRsA positivity rate

204

was lower in saliva than breast milk.

205

Participants with saliva samples that tested negative for COVID-19 determined by

206

PCR and antibody tests did not develop COVID-19 at the time of this article submission.

207

Thus, we believe that they had not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. As such, we revealed

208

sIgA antibodies against the spike 1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with no history

209

of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only one other study found salivary IgA antibodies that cross-

210

react with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 before the COVID-19 pandemic [17]. The

211

nucleocapsid proteins of coronaviruses are highly homologous, but their spike proteins

212

share little commonality [18]. Patients with a history of infection with HCoV-OC43 and

213

other coronaviruses have antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 and antibodies that cross-react

214

to the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, respectively [19]. Furthermore, whereas HCoV-

215

NL63 uses ACE-2 as a receptor, its spike protein shares little homology with SARS-CoV-

216

2 [20]. However, cross-reactivity of the receptor-binding motif 3 of NL63 and COV2-

217

SPIKE421–434 of SARS-CoV-2 has recently been reported [20]. As past common

218

coronavirus infection can induce antibodies that are cross-reactive to spike and

219

nucleocapsid proteins, it is reasonable that saliva contains antibodies such as salivary

220

sIgA with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2. However, the epitope behind salivary CRsA

221

cross-reactivity remains to be clarified.

222

The present study found that CRsA levels decreased with advancing age. This might

223

be explained by the fact that IgA levels decrease with age [21]. In addition, cross-reactive

224

IgG antibodies were identified in 62%, 43.75%, and 5.72% of serum samples from

225

individuals aged 1–16, 17–25, and ≥ 26 years, respectively, before the SARS-CoV-2

226

pandemic [9]. Because children are infected with common coronaviruses more frequently,

227

this seems to indicate that that more exposure leads to more individuals with cross-

228

reactive antibodies. Moreover, cross-reactive T cells for SARS-CoV-2 are rare in elderly

229

persons [22]. These results can explain why CRsA is prevalent in young persons but

230

uncommon in older persons. The mechanism behind the fact that COVID-19 is less

231

frequently severe and often asymptomatic in children [23] and adolescents [12] might be

232

partially explained.

233

We showed here that the binding between ACE-2 and spike protein was not inhibited

234

in individuals without CRsA. In contrast, because cross-reactive IgA inhibited the

235

binding of ACE-2 to spike protein, salivary CRsA might prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection

236

via a neutralization reaction, because IgA functions as a neutralizing antibody against

237

SARS-CoV-2 [24]. Although saliva contains SARS-CoV-2, it also contains infection

238

inhibitory factors [3]. Saliva lactoferrin is an infection suppressor that binds to SARS-

239

CoV-2 [25]. Because sIgA has an antigen-processing function that is synergistic with

240

lactoferrin, lysozyme, and peroxidase, salivary anti-bacterial or anti-viral factors might

241

enhance the action of CRsA [26].

242

Early SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral responses are dominated by IgA antibodies,

243

indicating that these play an important role in immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection

[27]. On the other hand, neutralizing IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 persist in

245

saliva for 49 to 73 days after symptoms appear [27]. Spike 1-CRsA in saliva is also

246

associated with the severity of pneumonia in COVID-19 [17]. Saliva can be collected

247

easily and noninvasively, and sIgA is a practical test specimen because it is resistant to

248

degradation and does not have strict transport conditions. Developing a method to easily

249

and non-invasively measure sIgA in saliva might be important for the diagnosis or risk

250

prediction of SARS-CoV-2 infection and responses to vaccines in the future.

251

One limitation of the present study was the low number of participants. Although

252

vaccines stimulate the production of cross-reactive antibodies [7], we found no significant

253

association between vaccines and cross-reactive antibodies. Future investigations should

254

compare individuals who are not involved in medical care (without experience of

255

vaccination).

256
257

Conclusions

258

This study identified the SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive IgA spike protein in saliva from

259

individuals who have not experienced COVID-19. Elderly persons showed lower levels of

260

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-CRsA than adolescents. Salivary IgA might block the binding

261

of ACE-2 to the spike protein. We revealed the importance of IgA as an inhibitor of SARS-

anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in this compartment, despite the fact of the oral cavity being
