viral pneumonia of unknown cause[1], whose rapid spread has aroused great concern

38

from the whole society.The virus was confirmed to be a novel coronavirus with a unique

39

genome by sequencing the lower respiratory tract samples collected by the expert group

40

and named as "2019 Novel Corona virus" (2019-nCoV-2),designated by the International

41

Committee for the Classification of Viruses as SARS-CoV-2.The virus novel

42

SARS-CoV-2 spread throughout the world within three months, causing a pandemic and

43

posing a serious threat to human health[2].On February 11, 2020, WHO named the novel

44

coronavirus disease as COVID-19 and declared the infectious disease a public health

45

emergency[3].The COVID-19 is reported to have spread through human-to-human

46

transmission[4].

47

So far, there is a lack of immunity against the COVID-19 in humans[5].At present,

48

the known source of COVID-19 infection is novel Coronavirus infection (including

49

asymptomatic infection), which is transmitted by respiratory droplets, close contact,

50

aerosol and fecal mouth. Respiratory droplets and close contact are the main transmission

51

routes, and people are generally susceptible.Based on the known epidemiological

52

investigation, the incubation period of this disease is 1-14d, generally 3-7d.Fatigue, dry

53

cough and fever were the main symptoms of common infected persons. A small number

54

of patients were accompanied by nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, diarrhea and

55

other symptoms. CT examination showed chest imaging characteristics.Most of the

56

patients with severe illness developed dyspnea or/and hypoxemia 7 days after

57

onset.Critically ill patients may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome,

septic shock, multiple organ failure and other symptoms.It should be noted that most of

59

the patients with severe and critical diseases had moderate to low fever or no obvious

Henan province is adjacent to Hubei province, with Xinyang, Nanyang and

62

Zhumadian as the junction. Zhengzhou, as the capital city of Henan Province, has a large

63

flow of people, so the four cities are COVID-19 high incidence areas in Henan

64

Province.On January 21, 2020 health committee issued reports from Henan province

cases/cured cases, number of permanent residents in Henan province and cities, gender

80

and age structure of Henan province and cities, source of confirmed cases and types of

81

confirmed cases.In this paper, the source types of cases were divided into three categories:

82

imported cases (the patient had a history of overseas travel before diagnosis);Contact

83

cases (contact with confirmed or suspected patients before diagnosis);Local case (the

84

patient has not left the city before diagnosis and has no contact history).There are four

85

types of cases: common (mild) cases (mild clinical symptoms, visible imaging/no

86

manifestations of pneumonia);Severe cases (on the basis of the common type, oxygen

87

saturation ≤ 93% under resting state, partial arterial oxygen pressure PaO2/ oxygen

89

lesion progression within 24-48 hours & GT;50%, etc.);Critical cases (including

90

respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, and other organ failure

91

requiring ICU care);Deaths.The calculated data include: cumulative incidence of

92

COVID-19 (1/100,000) = cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a city (county

93

included)/permanent resident population in a city by the end of 2018;Cumulative cure

94

rate (%) = cumulative number of cured and discharged COVID-19 cases in a

number of critical cases was 38, accounting for 2.99%(Fig.2).

143

3.1.2 Basic characteristics of confirmed cases in Henan Province

144

Due to limited information on confirmed COVID-19 cases published on the official

145

websites of health commissions of various cities, a total of 600 cases in 4 cities

146

(Zhengzhou, Xinyang, Nanyang and Puyang City) with comprehensive information were

147

selected for statistical analysis.Among the 600 confirmed cases, 315 were male and 285

148

were female, with a sex ratio of 1.11 to 1.The age of confirmed cases ranged from 5 days

149

to 85 years, with the oldest from Zhumadian and the youngest from Xinyang. The

150

average age of confirmed cases was 45 years old, the median age was 46 years old and

151

the majority age was 56 years old.Therefore, it was analyzed that COVID-19 population

152

is generally susceptible to COVID-19, but the middle-aged and elderly population is

153

more likely to be 40-60 years old.Among the confirmed cases of COVID-19, 325 were

154

imported, of which 277 were imported from Hubei, accounting for 85.23%.204 contact

155

cases, accounting for 34%;Local type 73 cases accounted for 12.17%(Fig.3).

166

cumulative incidence of 0.5 per 100,000.Six cities accounted for 62.26% of the province's

167

total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Xinyang had the highest incidence of

168

COVID-19, followed by Zhumadian, Zhengzhou, Nanyang and Anyang City. Puyang

169

City had the lowest incidence of COVID-19.According to the data, the COVID-19

170

epidemic situation in Henan province as a whole showed a downward trend from north to

171

south based on the analysis of the geographical location and the flow of people in each

172

city.As the capital city of Henan province, Zhengzhou has a complex population and a

173

large number of people moving around. The overall COVID-19 situation is higher than

174

other central regions.On February 23, 2020 first without new Xinyang COVID - 19

analyzed in detail).According to the analysis of the sex ratio among cities, the cumulative

186

incidence of COVID-19 among males in Zhengzhou, Xinyang and Zhumadian is higher

187

than that among females. Among them, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 among

188

males in Xinyang is the highest (4.08 per 100,000).Puyang had the lowest incidence of

189

COVID-19 among males (0.34/100,000).The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 among

190

women in Nanyang and Puyang is higher than that of men, and the highest incidence of

191

COVID-19 among women in Xinyang is 3.11/100,000, while the lowest incidence of

192

COVID-19 among women in Puyang is 1.33/100,000.

193

According to the age analysis, in order to make a correct and objective analysis of

194

the age composition structure, the age is divided according to the age structure in Henan

195

Statistical Yearbook 2019.The age of confirmed COVID-19 cases ranged from 5 days

196

(Xinyang) to 88 years (Zhumadian), and the age of confirmed COVID-19 cases was

197

concentrated between 15 and 64 years old, accounting for 87.42%. The cumulative

198

incidence of COVID-19 in this age group was the highest (511/100,000) in Xinyang.The

199

cumulative incidence of COVID-19 at age ≤ 14 years was the lowest, with Nanyang

200

having the lowest incidence (0.10/100,000).The results are shown in Table 1.1.The

201

average age of confirmed COVID-19 cases was 42.8 years old in Zhengzhou City, 47.3

202

years old in Xinyang, 44.4 years old in Nanyang, 43.2 years old in Zhumadian, and 39.5

209

imported cases, among which the highest proportion of imported cases is 70.50% in

210

Zhumadian, followed by Zhengzhou.In Xinyang, imported cases and contact cases

211

accounted for 89.05%, and the ratio of imported cases and contact cases was 1.22:1.The

212

results are shown in Table 1.2.According to the public information of the epidemic

213

notification in Henan Province, confirmed imported cases were selected from Xinyang,

214

Zhengzhou, Zhumadian and Nanyang City for detailed investigation, and the imported

215

cases were subdivided into confirmed imported cases from Hubei and confirmed

216

non-imported cases. The results are shown in Table 2.Hubei accounted for 87.74% of the

217

total imported cases, while Hubei accounted for the majority of COVID-19 imported

3.3.2 Main prevention and control measures of Henan Provincial Government

234

In the face of COVID-19, the Henan Provincial government responded positively,

235

quickly implemented the guidance given in the document of the CPC Central Committee,

236

and added a number of important prevention and control measures with Henan

237

characteristics.First, increase publicity.The government has made the public aware of the

238

seriousness of COVID-19 through TV and radio 24/7, and sent text messages on

239

epidemic prevention and control to the public through mobile phone platforms.Second,

14 d, stop all provincial traffic operations, public supervision and prevention and control

248

of epidemic reporting platform to encourage the populace to supervise to report.Third,

249

fight the epidemic comprehensively.All units at all levels of the health care system will

250

cancel the Spring Festival holiday in 2020, and all staff will arrive at their posts on time

251

to maintain 24-hour communications and respond to the epidemic at any time.130

252

designated hospitals for MEDICAL treatment of COVID-19 have been identified for

253

timely treatment of COVID-19.

254

3.3.3 Specific epidemic prevention and control measures

255

All cities in Henan province promptly launched the first-level response to major

256

health emergencies, and adopted epidemic prevention and control measures with the

257

characteristics of each city.COVID - 19 high incidence area in Henan province

258

(Zhengzhou, Xinyang, Nanyang and Zhumadian City) as an example, the Zhengzhou to

259

open special line 12320 provide consultation service for 24 h free COVID - 19, stop all

260

outside of Zhengzhou passenger service at the same time reduce the city public traffic

261

divisions, each district area residents swept a yard code registration management system,

262

such as have not obey the management focuses on the compulsory isolation.Set up 10

263

card point in Xinyang, check the traffic of vehicles at the same time for a full sanitizers,

264

temperature detection was carried out on the staff to ensure that no one car, leakage of

265

Hubei direction into the vehicles and personnel are advised to return within the territory

266

of Xinyang, found that patients with fever timely report to the epidemic prevention and

267

control command and arrange to specify the quantities further isolation.All entertainment

268

venues are closed for business. No food in the catering industry, no matter big or small, is

269

allowed to enter public places. Only when there is no abnormality can you enter public

270

places with a mask and a temperature measurement.Nanyang postponed the work of

271

government organs, the resumption of work of various enterprises and the opening of

272

schools, delayed the opening time of administrative examination and approval services

273

under the line, implemented centralized isolation and centralized observation system, and

274

adopted rewarding reporting measures to encourage citizens to supervise surrounding

275

personnel, so as to control the epidemic in an all-round and multi-angle way.Zhumadian

276

and its subsidiaries closed four fire stations, suspended all traffic operations, closed

277

farmers' markets and entertainment venues.In addition to the above four cities, all other

278

cities have imposed compulsory control on the traffic operation within the city, including

279

subordinate counties, and suspended all kinds of public service places at all levels and all

280

kinds of external purchase and distribution activities, so as to effectively ensure the

281

internal non-proliferation and external import prevention.

4.Discussion

283

COVID-19 is a new and highly infectious disease that will break out in 2020. It has

284

had a great impact on the whole society. It has not only seriously affected people's life

285

and mental health, but also seriously affected people's production and life.As a province

286

with a large population and strong personnel mobility, Henan province is close to Hubei

287

Province. As of June 17, 2020, Henan province had a total of 1,273 confirmed cases, with

288

a cumulative incidence rate of 1.32/100,000, higher than that of other provinces and cities

289

outside Hubei, which is closely related to the geographical location of Henan

290

province.Since the first confirmed case was reported in Henan province, the number of

291

new confirmed cases per day in general showed an inverted v-shaped trend, reaching a

292

peak of 109 cases on February 20, and the epidemic reached a stable control after

293

February 24. There was no new case except one imported case from abroad on March

294

11.Study shows that the population migration and COVID - 19 cumulative disease rate is

295

positively correlated, Zhengzhou as the capital city as the main transport hub city of

296

Henan province, the population of complex personnel fluidity big range, Zhumadian City

297

has 4 place with Wuhan high-speed and next to, Nanyang, Xinyangand Nanyang City in

298

Henan province and Hubei province at the junction, turnover main direction is in Hubei

299

province, due to the convenient transportation only 30 min drive, so both the city

300

personnel will be in Hubei province as the first choice for migrant workers, entertainment,

301

so the above four city of Henan province COVID - 19 outbreaks.Anyang and Puyang

302

City are in the northernmost part of Henan Province, far away from Hubei Province, so

303

the epidemic has been least affected[10].

304

In terms of the source of confirmed COVID-19 cases, Hubei imported cases

305

dominated the initial stage of the outbreak. Contact cases and local cases fluctuated over

306

time, indicating that the outbreak shifted from external import to internal spread.However,

307

the total proportion of contact cases and local cases was 42.80%, indicating that there was

308

no large-scale spread of the epidemic in Henan province.It is worth noting that one

309

imported case occurred in Zhengzhou on March 11, and the confirmed imported cases

310

from central Hubei accounted for 20.38% of the total cases in Zhengzhou City. Therefore,

311

Zhengzhou City should strengthen the import of other non-Hubei and foreign regions

312

while preventing imported cases from Hubei.

313

Studies by the COVID-19 Epidemiology Group of the Chinese Center for Disease

314

Control and Prevention showed that the sex ratios of confirmed COVID-19 cases in

315

China,

316

respectively[11].Zhong Nanshan group of patients in gender studies showed that 41.9%

317

of female patients accounted[12], Xi 'an, the centers for disease control and prevention

318

reported male patients accounted for 54.3%[13][13], and Lu Jiahai[14],Kang[15][15]to

319

Guangzhou confirmed cases found women more than men, the prompt COVID - 19 men

320

and women are prone to infection in the gender, but confirmed cases of gender

321

distribution is different in different areas.For example, male patients in Zhengzhou City,

322

Xinyang and Zhumadian City were more than female patients, while female patients in

323

Puyangand Nanyang City were more than male patients.

Hubei

province

and

Wuhan

were

and

324

Since January 21, the province has reported 1,273 confirmed COVID-19 cases

325

(including one imported from abroad) and 22 deaths. On March 15, as the last COVID-19

326

patient in Xinyang was discharged from hospital on March 14, all local hospitalized

327

patients in the province have been cured and discharged, realizing zero cases!At present,
