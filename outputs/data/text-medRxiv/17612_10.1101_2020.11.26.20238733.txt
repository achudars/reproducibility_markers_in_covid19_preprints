ABSTRACT

23

ELISA and chemiluminescence serological assays for COVID-19 are currently

24

incorporating only one or two SARS-CoV-2 antigens. We developed an automated

25

Western immunoblotting as a complementary serologic assay for COVID-19. The

26

JessTM Simple Western system, an automated capillary-based assay was used,

27

incorporating an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 lineage 20a strain as antigen, and IgT

28

detection. In total, 602 sera were tested including 223 from RT-PCR-confirmed

29

COVID-19 patients, 76 from patients diagnosed with seasonal HCoVs and 303 from

30

coronavirus-negative control sera. We also compared this assay with the

31

EUROIMMUN® SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA kit. Among 223 sera obtained from RT-

32

PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, 180/223 (81%) exhibited reactivity against the

33

nucleocapsid and 70/223 (31%) against the spike protein. Nucleocapsid reactivity

34

was further detected in 9/76 (14%) samples collected from patients diagnosed with

35

seasonal HCoVs and in 15/303 (5%) coronavirus-negative control samples. In the

36

subset of sera collected more than 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms, the

37

sensitivity was 94% and the specificity 93%, the latter value probably reflecting

38

cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses. The automated Western

39

immunoblotting presented a substantial agreement (90%) with the compared ELISA

40

(Cohen’s Kappa=0.64). Automated Western immunoblotting may be used as a

41

second line test to monitor exposition of people to HCoVs including SARS-CoV-2.

1. INTRODUCTION
To date, seven coronaviruses have been reported as human pathogens,

44

including four seasonal coronaviruses (Alphacoronavirus 229E and NL63 and

45

Betacoronavirus HKU1 and OC43) here referred to as HCoVs, which are associated

46

to mild-to-severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections (1). Two other

47

betacoronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002 in China

48

(SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2012 in Saudi Arabia

49

(MERS-CoV) (2); and the Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that is the agent of the

50

COVID-19 pandemic has been demonstrated to infect a variety of animals and

51

humans (3). The latter is phylogenetically closely related to HCoV-HKU1 and

52

presents a high sequence homology with SARS-CoV (2).

53

Serological assays used to explore exposition to seasonal HCoVs have

54

previously indicated cross-immunity between all coronaviruses (4–6). SARS-CoV-2

55

exhibits several antigens eliciting a serological response in COVID-19 patients,

56

including spike glycoprotein, its N-terminal (S1) and C-terminal (S2) subunits as well

57

as nucleocapsid (7). Most of routinely used serological COVID-19 assays

58

incorporated only one recombinant protein (8–10). Second generation assays are

59

combining two antigens to increase sensitivity and mostly specificity (7, 11).

60

We developed an automated Western immunoblotting (AWB) assay in order

61

to characterize serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 and the potential cross-

62

reactivity with HCoVs.

65

Serum sample collections. A first set of 27 serum samples from 27 different

66

patients with RT-PCR-documented COVID-19 (12), collected at least 2 weeks after

67

the onset of symptoms were incorporated as a positive control group. All of them

68

presented IgG titer ≥ 1:100 using in-house indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA)

69

(13). Of these, 16 serum samples were used for conventional immunoblotting

70

including 3 samples exhibiting low (1:200), moderate (1:800) and high (1:3,200) IgG

71

titers using IFA that were used to fix optimal conditions to be used for AWB (antigen,

72

serum and secondary antibodies concentrations). One serum collected in 2018,

73

before the onset of COVID-19 (negative RT-PCR for HCoVs on homologous

74

respiratory specimen) was included as negative control.

75

As for AWB, 223 serum samples (including the 27 serum samples described

76

above) collected from 223 different RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were

77

incorporated as a positive control group. Twenty-seven of these sera were tested for

78

antibodies to the recombinant S1 protein by EUROIMMUN® SARS-CoV-2 IgG

79

ELISA (Euroimmun, Bussy Saint-Martin, France) performed using the Elispeed DUO

80

system (Euroimmun) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The ratio

81

(AUC sample/AUC calibrator) was interpreted as follows: <0.8 negative; ≥0.8 to <1.0

82

undetermined; ≥1.1 positive. We considered undetermined results as negative for

83

statistical analyses. A negative control group (37 serum samples) consisted of (i) 10

84

serum sampled obtained less than 5 days after the onset of symptoms) in patients

85

presenting high viral loads of SARS- CoV-2 (Ct values < 20); (ii) 14 sera from

86

asymptomatic healthcare workers largely exposed to the virus but exhibiting negative

87

results for RT-PCR and serology by IFA for SARS-CoV-2 during follow-up; and (iii)

88

13 sera from patients collected in 2019 before the pandemic and harbouring

89

negative RT-PCR results for the 4 HCoVs in their nasopharyngeal specimens. These

90

37 serum samples were also all tested by ELISA. A third group of 76 serum samples

91

was retrieved from patients diagnosed with seasonal coronavirus infections (HCoV-

92

NL63 (n=19), HCoV-OC43 (n=21), HCoV-229E (n=8) and HCoV-HKU1 (n=28)) and

93

were collected at least 2 weeks after the diagnosis, of which 45 were also tested by

94

ELISA. A fourth group of 266 sera was collected from children and adults admitted in

95

surgery departments (n=145) and other medical units (=121) before the pandemic, of

96

which 88 serum samples were also tested by ELISA; their HCoVs status was

97

unknown. Altogether, 197 sera tested by ELISA, included 27 sera from COVID-19-

98

positive patients and 170 from COVID-19-negative patients. All sera were

99

retrospectively tested and no sample was collected specifically for this study which

100

was approved by our institution’s ethics committee under No.2020-024.

Virus growth, purification and concentration. The SARS-CoV-2 IHUMI2 strain

103

(lineage 20a) was used as antigen as previously described (13). One liter of infected

104

cells was collected and clarified by centrifugation at 700 x g for 10 min and by

105

filtering the supernatant through a 0.45-µm pore-sized filter and further a 0.2-µm

106

pore-sized filter. Virions were then aggregated by overnight precipitation at 4ºC with

107

10% polyethylene glycol 8000 white flake type (PEG-8000, BioUltra, SIGMA-

108

ALDRICH, USA) and 2.2% crystalline NaCl, with gentle swirling. Precipitated virus

109

particles were then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 30 min using a SORVALL Evolution

110

centrifuge with SLA-3000 Recent 1 fixed angle rotor pre-cooled at 4ºC (Kendro

111

Laboratory Products, Newtown, USA). The pellet was resuspended with HEPES-

112

saline (0.9% NaCl, 10 mL of 1 M HEPES, 990 mL purified water) previously vacuum-

113

sterilized through a 0.2-µm pore size membrane; swirled in the cold HEPES-saline

114

until dissolution to avoid using pipetting as it may hurts viral spikes at this step. The

115

resuspended pellet was then treated with a 30% sucrose cushion in 25 x 89 mm

116

centrifuge tubes (Ultra-Clear, BECKMAN COULTER, CA, USA). Final purification

was achieved by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 90 min at 4°C followed by two

118

30-min washes with HBSS using SORVALL Discovery 90SE with Surespin 630 rotor

119

(Kendro Laboratory Products). The final pellet was resuspended in 400 µL of

120

HEPES-buffered saline and heat-inactivated at 65°C for 1h.

122

Conventional Western immunoblotting. SARS-CoV-2 antigens diluted to 0.5

123

mg/mL were mixed (v/v) with 2X Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,

124

USA) before a heating step of 5 min at 95°C. This preparation and a ladder were

125

dispensed in wells shaped in a 5 % polyacrylamide stacking gel. The protein

126

separation was then performed in a 10 % polyacrylamide separating gel with a Mini

127

Trans-blot cell device (Bio-Rad) at 160 V for 90 min. After transferring proteins from

128

the gel to a 0.45 μm-pore size nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) at 100 V and 15°C

129

for 90 min, the membrane was left at 4°C overnight with 5% non-fat milk powder in

130

TBS buffer. Blocked strips were incubated with sera diluted at 1:50 for 60 min. Three

131

washes of 10 min were performed before a 90-min incubation of the strips with goat

132

peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG/ IgM/IgA (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Ely,

133

UK) diluted 1:1000. Three washes of 10 min with TBS buffer were made. Strips were

134

put in contact with ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Promega, Madison, USA) and

135

the reaction with secondary antibody peroxydases was revelated with a Fusion Fx

136

chemiluminescence imaging system and analysed with the Fusion software (Vilber,

137

Marne-la-Vallée, France).

142

viral antigens, we followed the manufacturer’s standard method for 12-230-kDa Jess

143

separation module (SM-W004). The SARS-CoV-2 antigen (1 µg/µL) was mixed with

144

0.1X Sample buffer and Fluorescent 5X Master mix (ProteinSimple) to achieve a

145

final concentration of 0.25 µg/µL in the presence of fluorescent molecular weight

146

markers and 400 mM dithiothreitol (ProteinSimple). This preparation was denatured

147

at 95°C for 5 minutes. Ladder (12-230-kDa PS-ST01EZ) and SARS-CoV-2 proteins

148

were separated in capillaries as they migrated through a separation matrix at 375

149

volts. A ProteinSimple proprietary photoactivated capture chemistry was used to

150

immobilize separated viral proteins on the capillaries. Patients sera diluted at a 1:2

151

were added and incubated for 60 min. After a wash step, goat HRP-conjugated anti-

152

human IgG/IgM/IgA antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:500 was added

153

for 30 min. The chemiluminescent revelation was established with peroxyde/luminol-

154

S (ProteinSimple). Digital image of chemiluminescence of the capillary was captured

155

with Compass Simple Western software (version 4.1.0, Protein Simple) that

156

calculated automatically heights (chemiluminescence intensity), area and

157

signal/noise ratio. Results could be visualized as electropherograms representing

158

peak of chemiluminescence intensity and as lane view from signal of

159

chemiluminescence detected in the capillary. An internal system control was

160

included in each run.

161
162

Statistical analysis. ROC curves were performed using XL stat. The agreement

163

rate and Cohen’s Kappa value were determined for agreement between ELISA and

164

AWB. For data comparisons and statistical analyses, the Fisher’s exact test, Chi-

165

squared test, Mann-Witney test and standard statistical software (GraphPad Prism

166

v7) were used. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

3. RESULTS

168

Fixing automated Western immunoblotting parameters. Protein profiles of the

169

purified SARS-CoV-2 antigen and uninfected Vero cells were verified on silver-

170

stained 2-D gel. As expected, the viral specific and major dominant proteins were N,

171

S, S1 and S2 proteins at 42, 170, 110 and 90 kDa, respectively. All 16 serum

172

samples collected from 16 different COVID-19 patients exhibited reactivity against

173

the nucleocapsid and spike proteins. Parameter optimization to translate these data

174

on AWB included an antigen concentration of 0.25 µg/µL, a serum dilution at 1:2 and

175

a secondary antibody dilution of 1:500 (data not shown). In these conditions, AWB of

176

positive serum samples yielded a prominent 56-kDa band interpreted as the

177

nucleocapsid and a 217-kDa band interpreted as the spike protein (Figure S1).

178

Higher molecular weight values observed with AWB than with SDS-PAGE were due

179

to the different composition of gel in the capillaries. In total, the 16 sera from COVID-

180

19 patients tested with conventional and AWB gave similar results except that AWB

181

failed to detect the spike protein in one sample. Further, AWB yielded significant

182

higher S/N ratio, pick height and area under curve for the nucleocapsid (p < 0.0001)

183

and spike proteins (p < 0.0001) in the 27 serum samples from COVID-19 patients

184

than in 37 serum samples collected in negative control patients (Table 1). The S/N

185

ratio presented higher Youden Index for nucleocapsid detection, being therefore

186

interpreted as the most pertinent parameter to interpret AWB results. Optimal

187

threshold for the S/N ratio of 110.4 conferred a 96.3% sensitivity and 94.6%

188

specificity for the nucleocapsid detection. Determination of a cut-off to interpret

189

results of spike protein was not useful and could be based only on

190

presence/absence of signal with sensitivity to 66.7% and 100% specificity (Table 2).

191

Therefore, we further used the presence of antibodies to the nucleocapsid with S/N

192

ratio ≥ 110.4 and/or to the spike protein, as criteria to define a positive AWB.

193
194

Automated Western immunoblotting results. AWB yielded 395/602 (66%)

195

negative and 207/602 (34%) positive serum samples (Table 3); giving an 81%

196

sensitivity as 181/223 COVID-19 patients were positive (nucleocapsid detected in

197

180/223 (76%) and spike in 67/223 (30%), respectively); and a 93% specificity as

198

26/379 (7%) non-COVID-19 patients were positive; applying above reported cut-off

199

criteria (Figures 1 and 2a). Accordingly, positive (PPV) and negative predictive

200

values (NPV) were of 87% and 89%, respectively. Sera from COVID-19 patients

201

were collected with a median of 13 days (range 0 to 165) after the onset of

202

symptoms. Sensitivity was 54% among sera collected less than 10 days after the

203

onset of symptoms and increased to 94% among sera collected more than 10 days

204

after the onset of symptoms (Figure 3). AWB had a 90% agreement with the herein

205

compared ELISA assay (Cohen’s Kappa=0.64) as the latter was positive in 22/27

206

(81.5%) COVID-19 patients and 6/170 (3.5%) non-COVID-19 patients, yielding a

207

sensitivity of 81.5% and specificity of 97% (Table 4).

208

Detailing false-positive AWB, antibodies to the nucleocapsid were detected in

209

3/37 (8%) negative control serum samples. Also, 9/76 (14%) serum sampled from

210

patients diagnosed with seasonal HCoVs, reacted with the nucleocapsid which was

211

detected in 5/28 (18%) of patients with HCoV-HKU1, 2/19 (10.5%) with HCoV-NL63,

212

2/21 (9.5%) with HCoV-OC43 but in none of HCoV-229E patients (Figure 2b). In

213

addition, one HCoV-HKU1 serum and one HCoV-NL63 serum reacted against the

214

spike protein, increasing the number of total cross-reactions to 11/76 (14.5%) for this

215

group. Among 266 serums sampled before the COVID-19 epidemic in France, albeit

216

of unknown status for HCoVs, 12/266 (4.5%) reacted against the nucleocapsid but

217

none against the spike protein.

218

Most cross reactivities were detected in 46-65-year-old patients (7/63) and

219

more than 65-year-old (4/43) patients (Figure 2c). Cross reactivity was more

220

prevalent in subjects > 21 years (15/173) than in children ≤ 15 years (6/126) but this

221

difference was not significant (p = 0.25, Fisher’s exact test).

222
223
224

4. DISCUSSION
An AWB, incorporating whole SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, was demonstrate to

225

be efficient in detecting specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 dual nucleocapsid

226

and spike proteins, achieving a 87% PPV and a 89% NPV for COVID-19, in the

227

population tested in this study. Accordingly, dual nucleocapsid and spike protein

228

detections exhibited 81% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Indeed, the spike protein

229

was detected in only two non-COVID-19 patients whereas the nucleocapsid protein

230

was detected in 24 non-COVID-19 patients, including 11 patients diagnosed with

231

HCoVs. In our study, AWB results were consistent with results obtained using a

232

commercially ELISA incorporating recombinant spike-1 protein. The serological

233

observations obtained in this study therefore indicated that it is worth developing

234

next generation serological assays incorporating both the nucleocapsid and the

235

spike proteins, in order to achieve almost 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity of

236

SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is not the situation with first generation, commercially-

237

available serological assays (7, 11, 14).

238

It should be noted that cross-reactivity was more prevalent in patients infected

239

with other betacoronaviruses (accounting for 31% of cross-reactivity) than in patients

240

infected with alphacoronaviruses (accounting for 12% of cross-reactivity); being

241

mainly supported by SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (in 92% of cross-reacting serum

242

samples); and mostly found in adult patients older than 46 years (accounting for 52%

243

of sera with cross-reactivity). Our observations are consistent with previous reports

244

that cross-reactions were observed with nucleocapsid while serological assays

245

incorporating the spike protein have been reported to be more specific but less

246

sensitive (4–6, 15–18). Cross-reactivity has been described between endemic

247

coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 (19). Several studies reported the presence of

248

antibodies reacting with SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins in serum

249

sampled before the pandemic and in HCoVs patients (20, 21).

250

In a few previous reports of the described AWB (22–24), a recombinant

251

protein was used as the antigen whereas we used purified virus antigen directly

252

produced in the biosafety level 3 laboratory (13). This fact could explain in part the

253

important difference of sensitivity for the spike protein compared to the nucleocapsid,

254

in our assay. Thereby, serum dilution was a critical parameter as the spike protein

255

was detected only for a low, 1:2 dilution of serum. Nevertheless, the herein

256

described AWB assay demonstrated a better standardization and reproducibility than

257

conventional Western immunoblotting, proved to be user-friendly and enabled

258

analyzing 24 serum samples in less than 4 hours. Result interpretation was not only

259

based on presence/absence and intensity of bands but a chemiluminescent image

260

was automatically analyzed with software allowing noise reduction. The “virtual

261

image” of reactions present in the capillaries could be represented by peaks on

262

electropherogram or lane views.

263

In conclusion, the herein described AWB may be incorporated as a first line

264

serological test for the diagnosis of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 if limited series have to

265
