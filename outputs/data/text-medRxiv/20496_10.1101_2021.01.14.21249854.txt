Abstract
Background: Infectiousness of COVID-19 by age class inferred from the infection
source and by infected people might be different. However, studies of such
infectiousness have not been reported.
Object: The object of this study was estimation of reproduction numbers by age class of
the source of infection and the infected persons. To do so, after examining a new
procedure for reproduction number estimation, we checked infected places by age class
of the source of infection and the infected persons.
Method: We ignore patients who infected no one because their reliability might be lower
than that of patients who infected more than one person. We estimated the reproduction
number from the histogram of the number of the infected people by the same patient,
assuming that the histogram follows an exponential distribution.
Discussion and Conclusion: The obtained results demonstrated that the effective
reproduction numbers for infection from children were very low. They were higher
among adult and elderly people than among the same age class. Moreover, although the
highest and second-highest infected places were ‘other’ and ‘at home’ with some
exceptions, the data for infection at hospitals were remarkable among adults and elderly
people. Among elderly people, infection at facilities for elderly was also high. Infections

Introduction

Since the emergence COVID-19 in December, 2019 in Wuhan, China, several
reproduction numbers have been estimated. Some of the earliest studies in Wuhan [1–3]
estimated R0 for COVID-19 as 2.24–3.58. Even in Japan, early research [4] estimated
R0 as 2.049 (95%CI [2.403, 2.557]). However, these were reproduction numbers for the
whole population. Reproduction numbers by age class probably were lesser known. One
exceptional report described the effective reproduction numbers for children as 1.75,
1.84 for adult, and 2.19 for elderly people [5].
However, infectiousness by age class by the source of infection and the infected
persons might be different. For example, children might have high infectiousness to
children, but low infectiousness to elderly people. Conversely adults might have high
infectiousness to elderly people. When considering the effects of school closure as a
countermeasure against COVID-19, the most important parameter should be
infectiousness among children. Infectiousness of children to adults including teachers
and caregivers is less interesting. Therefore, this study was conducted to estimate the
reproduction number by age class to the same and other age classes.
An exemplary study conducted in the USA reported that child patients with

symptoms shed the virus as much or more than adult patients did [6]. That finding
suggests that infectiousness from symptomatic children to adults is comparable to that
from one adult to another adult. A report of a study conducted in Japan showed that
non-symptomatic nursery school children infected other children or teachers [7]. This
finding suggests that infectiousness from symptomatic children to children was almost
comparable to infectiousness to adults.
This study was undertaken to estimate reproduction numbers by the age class of the
source of infection and of the infected persons. To make such an estimation, we ignore
patients who did not infect others at all because their reliability might be lower than that
of patients who infected more than one person. Subsequently, we examined new
procedures for estimating the reproduction numbers. Moreover, we checked the infected
places by age class of the infection source and the infected persons.

Method

Let xi,j,k represent the number of cases in which k patient in i age class were infected
from the same patient who was of j age class. Particularly, we presumed three age
classes: i or j=1 represents an age class of younger than 20 years old; 2 indicates the age

class of patients who were 20 years old or older and younger than 60 years old; and 3
indicates the age class of people 60 years old and older. Additionally, yi, represents the
total number of patients including those for whom the source of infection was
unidentified. Therefore, Ri,j, which represents the effective reproduction number from
age class j to age class i, was defined as Σk=1 k xi,j,k /yj.
However, the sources of infection of almost all patients were unidentified. Actually,
the source of infection was unknown in 85% of infected people of all age classes.
Therefore, Σk=1 xi,j,k is expected to be much less than yj. In fact, these patients were
infected by someone, even if their source of infection was not identified. Moreover, if a
patient was not confirmed as infecting anyone (nobody confirmed being infected by a
patient), it cannot be said that this patient did not actually infect anyone. Therefore,
unidentified sources of infection or persons not confirmed as having infected anyone
were less reliable than cases in which the source of infection had been confirmed.
Therefore, we limited the information to be used to about xi,j,k for k>0.
Because we do not know the probability that a patient infected one person, the
probability that a person infecting two or more people was assumed to follow an
exponential distribution as pi,j, pi,j2, pi,j3, and so on. Then Ri,j= pi,j+2pi,j2+3pi,j3+…=Σk=1 k
pi,j k=pi,j/(1-pi,j)2.

We observed an estimator of pi,j as xi,j,1/Ni,j, where Ni,j was an unknown total
number of age class i patients who were infected by age class j patients. Similarly, pi,j2
was estimated as xi,j,2/Ni,j and pi,jm= xi,j,m/Ni,j in general. By log transformation, we have
m log pi,j= log xi,j,m-log Ni,j (m=1,2,…). Therefore, we obtain an estimator of p as an
estimated coefficient of regression of log xi,j,m on m by ordinary least squares method. In
addition, Ni,j* was obtained from an exponential transform for the estimated constant
term.
The confidence interval (CI) of Ri,j* was obtained using a bootstrapping procedure
for the distribution of {xi,j,m (m=1,2,…)}. Based on the k-th bootstrapped distribution,
{xi,j,m (m=1,2,…)}k, we can obtain Ri,j*k. We repeated this procedure one million times,
thereby obtaining one million bootstrapped Ri,j*k. We sorted these variables. The
duration from Ri,j*25000 to Ri,j *975000 is expected to be 95%CI of Ri,j*.
In addition to that, we classified the used data to the infection place by age class of
the source of infection and the infected. The infected places which were classified were
homes, hospitals, facilities for elderly people, schools except for universities, nursery
schools, universities, restaurants other than entertainment at night or karaoke,
entertainment at night, karaoke, workplaces, sports gym, theaters and live venues,
others, and unknown.

All information used for this study was obtained from reports of the Ministry of
Health, Labour and Welfare [8] and local governments. The study period extended from
January 15, when the initial case was detected in Japan, to the end of July.

Ethical considerations
All information used for this study has been published elsewhere [8]. There is
therefore no ethical issue related to this study.

Results

Through the end of July, 36,431 patients had been confirmed in Japan. Of them,
excluding asymptomatic cases, cases of people presumed to have been infected in
foreign countries, and cases whose onset date were not available, we are left with
30,780 cases. Of those cases, excluding cases for which the source of infection was
unknown, and for which the age of patients themselves and source of infection were
unavailable, we are left with 5383 cases. Of those, 4886 cases were identified as the
infection source. These 4886 cases were analyzed for this study.
Estimation results of Ri,j are presented in Table 1. High reproduction numbers were

found among adults and elderly people: higher than 4. Moreover, among elderly people
and among adults, Ri,j were, respectively, approximately 3.7 and 2.5. Conversely, to
children from adults or elderly people, Ri,j were very small: approximately 0.3 or 0.1,
respectively. From children, Ri,j were less than one. The highest Ri,j was to adults, but it
was less than 0.7.
Table 2 presents infection places in the data considered for this study. It shows that
“others” were consistently the highest proportion among any combination of age class
of source of infection and the infected persons. The second highest were at “home”,
except for infections from children to children. The second highest proportion of
infection place from children to children was “school”, which accounted for about 30%.
The third highest proportion among adult and elderly people was at a “hospital”.
However, among elderly people, the third highest was at “facilities for elderly people”.
Among adults, the third highest was at the “workplace”. From children to adults, it was
at a “school or university”. No infection was recorded at a “nursery school” among
children; less than 1% of all infections were from children to adults. Infection at
“restaurants” was less than 2% among adults. “Entertainment at night venues”
accounted for less than 0.4% of infections among adults and among elderly people.

Discussion

We developed a procedure to estimate case distributions among the numbers of the
infected cases. It ignores information about infected cases or unlinked cases for which
the source of infection was unknown, although they were a majority because their
information was less credible. However, information about patients who were reported
as having infected someone was more reliable than others because, at least, they were
investigated by public health authorities.
Earlier studies have included patients who were not reported as having infected
someone [7]. They estimated a very small reproduction number, 0.6, as of the end of
February in Japan. Although they did not call it R0, they referred to it as the average of
the secondary infection. That number indicates that the outbreak of COVID-19 was
self-limited. Therefore, any intensive infection control such as school closure or
restriction against going out is expected to be unnecessary. The authors of that report
apparently misunderstood the meaning of patients who were not reported as having
infected someone. They might have been under-investigated at that time. Therefore, the
people infected by them might have been found and reported. Alternatively,

investigation of them simply cannot find out who had been infected by them.
When we applied our procedure used in the present study to the data of an earlier
study, we obtained a figure of 4.4273; its 95%CI was [3.6000, 5.3364]. That value is
more than six times larger than the original estimate. It was almost comparable with our
obtained results for infections from adult/elderly to elderly/adult. They apparently
underestimated R0. Therefore, they misled infection-control policy and insisted on
contact tracing.
Results demonstrated that children are unlikely to infect anyone, even with Ri,j>1.
Apparently, they cannot spread the virus effectively. In this sense, school or class
closure might be less meaningful because an outbreak in a class or school might be a
lower possibility. In contrast, Ri,j from adult/elderly to elderly/adult were very high.
They were presumed to contact at home or at facilities for elderly people. Precautions at
these places are expected to be the most important for infection control.
Our obtained results, especially among adults and elderly people, are apparently
higher than estimation of reproduction number of COVID-19 for the entire population
to date. However, infectiousness to an age class by an age class has not been explored.
We cannot judge that these were overestimations through comparison with earlier
studies.

One possible reason why overestimation occurred might be the small sample used
for estimation. As described above, the total number of data was less than 5000 patients.
Therefore, a histogram of the number of secondary infections should be scarce
sometimes, especially in cases for which the infection source was children. If using
more data, then the estimation might improve. However, it is noteworthy that larger
amounts of data for adult and elderly people than for children lead to estimates that
were much larger.
Another potential reason might be estimation procedures. Especially, there were
outliers for which the number of secondary infections was larger than 20. They certainly
affected estimation strongly. They might be so-called “super spreaders,” although their
credibility might be lower than that of non-super-spreaders. However, some infected
people were reported. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, they were observed only among
adult and elderly people. Therefore, they were presumed to be infected at a facility such
as a hospital or a facility for elderly people. To allay their effect, we can use robust
estimation instead of ordinary least squares in a study. It remains as a challenge for
future research.
From the distribution of infected places by age class of source of infection and the
infected, we can learn many points about COVID-19 characteristics and

countermeasures against it. First, because others were consistently the highest
proportion among combinations of age classes of infection sources and infected people,
there were many types of infected places: it was difficult to isolate an infection place.
Taking the source of infection as occupying about 60% consistently into consideration,
countermeasures for any particular place including restaurants or entertainment
nightspots might be meaningless. These locations were sometimes regulated for
application of countermeasures in Japan, but their proportions were just less than 2%
and 0.4%, respectively. Therefore, the effectiveness of those regulations might be weak.
Secondly, because the second highest proportion were those infected at home,
countermeasures at home might be important, except for infection from children to
children. Nevertheless, we cannot shut down homes. The effectiveness of precautions at
homes might be limited.
Thirdly, the third highest proportion of infection among adult and elderly people
was at hospital and was at facilities for elderly among elderly people. Clearly, they were
vulnerable to COVID-19. Precautions at hospitals or facilities for elderly people have
been quite important.
Fourthly, among children, the second highest proportion of infection was school.
However, it was very rare. Infectiousness among children was low. Moreover, there was

no infection at nursery schools among children and just a less than 1% of infection from
children to adults. Schools and nursery schools might not be a locus of infection as they
are for influenza or other pediatric infectious diseases.
The present study has some limitations. First, we used data that were limited to
those for which the infection source was identified, with the age class of the infected
persons reported, and infected people all with some symptoms. However, those
symptomatic patients examined for the present study were very rare among all
symptomatic patients. Sources of infection for most of patients were unknown and
might not be reported in public even after being identified by the public health center.
Therefore, we assumed implicitly that they were representable in all symptomatic
patients. The data validity should be confirmed.
Second, similar to the first point, we limited analysis to symptomatic patients
because all asymptomatic patients were not reported as symptomatic patients. We also
implicitly assumed that asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients were the same
in terms of infectiousness. Therefore, we must check that point.
Thirdly, our proposed and used estimation procedure for the effective reproduction
number might be experimental. Its robustness should be examined as the next challenge
for future research.

Fourthly, the source of infection and infected place were identified through contact
tracing by the public health center. It was not based on the lineage of the genetic
sequence of SARS-CoV-2 or other method. Therefore, we must remark that this
information might include some ambiguity.

Conclusion
We demonstrated that effective reproduction numbers from children were very low
and that they were higher among adults and elderly people than among the same age
class. Moreover, although the highest and second-highest places of most frequent
infections were “other” and at “home” with some exceptions, infection at “hospitals”
was remarkable among adult and elderly people. Among elderly people, infection at
facilities for elderly people was also high. The relative frequencies of infections at
nursing schools, schools, restaurants, and entertainment nightspots were negligible.
The present study is based on the authors’ opinions: it does not reflect any stance or
policy of their professionally affiliated bodies.
