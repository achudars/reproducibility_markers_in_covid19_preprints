Abstract

24

The heterogeneity in severity and outcome of COVID-19 cases points out the urgent need

25

for early molecular characterization of patients followed by risk-stratified care. The main

26

objective of this study was to evaluate the fluctuations of serum metabolomic profiles of

27

COVID-19 patients with severe illness during the different disease stages in a longitudinal

28

manner. We demonstrate a distinct metabolomic signature in serum samples of 32 hospitalized

29

patients at the acute phase compared to the recovery period, suggesting the tryptophan

30

(tryptophan, kynurenine, and 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine) and arginine (citrulline and ornithine)

31

metabolism as contributing pathways in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 with a potential

32

link to the clinical severity of the disease. In addition, we provide evidence for glutamine

33

metabolism in M2 macrophages as a complementary process and contribution of phenylalanine

34

and tyrosine in the molecular mechanisms underlying the severe course of the infection. In

35

conclusion, our results provide several functional metabolic markers for disease progression and

36

severe outcome with potential clinical application.

37

Importance

38

Although the host defense mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 infection are still poorly

39

described, they are of central importance in shaping the course of the disease and the possible

40

outcome. Metabolomic profiling may complement the lacking knowledge of the molecular

41

mechanisms underlying clinical manifestations and pathogenesis of COVID-19. Moreover, early

42

identification of metabolomics based biomarker signatures is proved to serve as an effective

43

approach for the prediction of disease outcome. Here we provide the list of metabolites

44

describing the severe, acute phase of the infection and bring the evidence of crucial metabolic

45

pathways linked to aggressive immune responses. Finally, we suggest metabolomic phenotyping

46

as a promising method for developing personalized care strategies in COVID-19 patients.

47

Main text

48

More than a year has passed since the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the

49

COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic in March 2020, following the rapid spread of the SARS-

50

CoV-2 virus (1). The clinical course of COVID-19 is versatile, the infection of the SARS-CoV-2

51

virus not only varies in its severity from asymptomatic or mild and moderate respiratory disease

52

(80%) to clinically severe or critical life-threatening disease (20%) but also varies in a range of

53

organs the disease can affect (2, 3). Diverse clinical trajectories seem to be the result of the

54

immune response differences between individuals (4).

55

Multiple innate and adaptive immune system pathways that produce inflammatory

56

molecules against the virus and virus-infected human cells are triggered after the SARS-CoV-2

57

entry in the cell, with characteristic overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6,

58

TNFα, IFN-γ) known as cytokine storm in the most severe cases (4–6). The host's immune

59

responses typically involve changes in metabolic processes at the cellular level, reflecting the

60

host-defense mediators and underlying mechanisms (7).

61

Detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind COVID-19 pathogenesis and

62

inflammatory response is needed to predict and reduce individual risks, develop therapeutic

63

strategies, and reduce the overall ~2% mortality rate (mortality in hospitalized patients can be up

64

to 30%) (8, 9). The human blood sera metabolome (defined as small molecules <1500–2000 Da)

65

reflects the organism's metabolic state and is widely used to gain a deeper understanding of the

66

pathogenesis of diseases. Recent reports of metabolomics studies highlight the pivotal role of

67

cellular metabolites in programming immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (10–13).

68

Considering the extremely high heterogeneity of the COVID-19 disease and lack of promising

69

predictive biomarkers, we believe that implications of longitudinal metabolite profiling may be

70

beneficial in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the diverse course of the disease and

71

promote the early identification of people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and

72

related complications.

73

We performed quantitative targeted metabolome analysis with liquid chromatography-

74

mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in blood sera of 32 hospitalized COVID-19 patients at the acute

75

phase (time of admission at the hospital) and the recovery phase (40 ± 14.92 days) of the disease

76

(see Text S1 in the supplemental material for a detailed description of methods). Written

77

informed consent was obtained from every participant before their inclusion in the study, and the

78

study protocol was approved by the Central Medical Ethics Committee of Latvia (No. 01-

79

29.1.2/928).

80

As expected, the clinical blood tests revealed abnormal hematological parameters for the

81

majority of study participants at the time of hospitalization, with a high variation in platelet

82

(202.94 ± 65.26 µL) levels and low lymphocyte measurements (0.64 ± 0.56 µL), which coincides

83

with previously reported lymphopenia as the hallmark of severe COVID-19 cases. We also

84

observed a high variation of several markers (e.g. alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, lactate C-

85

reactive protein) indicating renal and hepatic dysfunction, myocarditis, inflammation, and

86

coagulation, which confirms the systemic response to the infection in our study cohort(2, 14)

87

(see Table S1 in the supplemental material).

88

Out of 51 metabolites analyzed by LC-MS, 22 metabolites showed significantly altered

89

levels (paired t-test, FDR<0.05) in the serum samples during the acute phase in comparison to

90

the recovery phase (Table 1), where concentrations for 16 compounds were significantly

91

elevated, whereas 8 metabolites were decreased. The hierarchical clustering and principal

92

component analysis of the obtained metabolomic profiles showed clear metabolomics-based

93

discrimination of samples collected in different phases of the disease (Figure1. A and B),

94

indicating an altered metabolic activity during infection. Pathway analysis revealed 13

95

significantly enriched pathways (FDR<0.05), including phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan

96

biosynthesis, D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism and arginine biosynthesis (Figure1 C,

97

Table S3). Statistical analysis was done with Metaboanalyst version 5.0 (15).

98

We found L-glutamine (Figure 1D) as the most significantly changed amino acid between

99

the paired samples with reduced acute phase concentrations. It is known that glutamine

100

deprivation and decreased glutaminolysis inhibits M2 macrophage polarization, which may

101

partly explain the hyperinflammatory state in severe COVID-19 cases (16, 17). Moreover, the

102

beneficial effect of glutamine has been proposed in multiple studies, where adding enteral L-

103

glutamine to the regular nutrition shortened the duration of hospitalization and improved the

104

outcome in moderate to severe COVID-19 cases (18, 19).

105

Two other amino acids involved in arginine catabolism through the Urea cycle: citrulline

106

(Figure 1D) and ornithine (Table 1) were found to significantly change between the acute and

107

recovery phases. However, alterations in the levels of L-arginine itself were not detected. Low

108

blood plasma citrulline levels have already been reported in COVID-19 patients, whereas in

109

patients with severe sepsis, the decreased citrulline levels are associated with acute respiratory

110

distress syndrome (11, 13, 20). Since arginine can be metabolized to creatine and then to

111

creatinine, both varying highly in our study cohort according to regular blood tests performed

112

during hospitalization, arginine catabolism may be implicated in disturbed kidney function of

113

COVID-19 patients (21).

114

Three out of 22 metabolites showing significantly changed levels between acute infection

115

and recovery phase are involved in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway: L-tryptophan,

116

kynurenine, and 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine (Figure 1D, Table 1). The reduction of tryptophan

117

levels and increase of kynurenine, 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine in the acute phase supports the

118

conclusions of previous reports and confirms this pathway's key role in severe COVID-19 cases

119

(10, 11). In vitro experiments have shown that tryptophan deprivation sensitizes T cells to

120

apoptosis, inhibits proliferation of T cells, and plays a role in CD8 T-cell suppression in cancer

121

(22, 23). Notably, the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway shows a modulatory effect on the

122

macrophage-mediated responses by targeting the synthesis of the metabolic coenzyme

123

NAD+(24, 25). According to Thomas et al. dysregulated tryptophan metabolism, an essential

124

regulator of inflammation and immunity may be a potential explanation for severity in older

125

COVID-19 patients (Thomas et al., 2020).

126

Finally, we observed a significant difference in L-phenylalanine (Figure 1D) and tyrosine

127

levels in our cohort between the analyzed disease phases, both already suggested as metabolic

128

hot spots of COVID-19 before (26). In sepsis and HIV-1 infection, the increased phenylalanine

129

sera concentrations are linked to immune activation and increased cardiovascular event risk (27–

130

29). Although the mechanisms behind this association are not well studied, it is in line with

131

microvascular endothelial damage and higher coagulation risk characteristic to both: coronary

132

heart disease and severe COVID-19 (29). Phenylalanine and tyrosine are catabolized to

133

dopamine and epinephrine, and the latter has been employed in cardiac arrest as a result of

134

cytokine storm, characteristic to severe COVID-19 patients(30).

135

In conclusion, our study shows that metabolomic profiling provides novel insights into the

136

pathogenesis of host-defense mechanisms and may be further applied for rapid biomarker

discovery in infectious disease. These discoveries could show novel therapeutic strategies as

138

indirect targets to fasten the recovery process after severe COVID-19. To the best of our

139

knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study covering metabolomic profiling of severe COVID-

Figure 1. Targeted metabolomic analysis of longitudinal serum samples of hospitalized

271

COVID-19 patients. (A) Heatmap and hierarchical clustering of top 22 significantly altered

272

metabolites. Each column represents one sample: (0, green) - samples collected in the acute

273

phase, (1, red) - samples collected during the recovery phase, each row conforms to a specific

274

metabolite expressed in normalized, log transformed concentration value. (B) Principal

275

component analysis showing clear discrimination of samples collected in the acute and recovery

276

phases of infection based on the obtained metabolite profiles. (C) Scatter plot representing the

277

most relevant metabolic pathways from KEGG library arranged by adjusted p-values (obtained

278

by Global Test pathway enrichment analysis) on Y-axis, and pathway impact values (from

279

pathway topology analysis) on X-axis. The node color is based on its p-value and the node radius

280

is determined based on their pathway impact values. (D) Boxplots showing the normalized levels

281

of the most functionally relevant metabolites during the acute phase (0) and the recovery phase

282

(1) of the infection, described as the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third

283

quartile, and the maximum value with the black dots representing each sample.
