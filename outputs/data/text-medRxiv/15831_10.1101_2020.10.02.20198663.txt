Abstract
Measuring COVID-19 spread remains challenging in many countries due to testing limitations. In Java,
reported cases and deaths increased throughout 2020 despite intensive control measures, particularly
within Jakarta and during Ramadan. However, underlying trends are likely obscured by variations in
case ascertainment. COVID-19 protocol funerals in Jakarta provide alternative data indicating a
substantially higher burden than observed within confirmed deaths. Transmission estimates using this
metric follow mobility trends, suggesting earlier and more sustained intervention impact than observed in
routine data. Modelling suggests interventions have lessened spread to rural, older communities with
weaker healthcare systems, though predict healthcare capacity will soon be exceeded in much of Java
without further control. Our results highlight the important role syndrome-based measures of mortality
can play in understanding COVID-19 transmission and burden.

Main Text
Following the first reports of a novel virus from Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (1), SARS-CoV-2 has
spread rapidly around the world, leading to more than 30 million confirmed cases of associated
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and over 900,000 reported deaths in 216 countries as of 20th
September 2020 (2). Measuring the rapid spread of COVID-19 has been challenging across the world
due to the high fraction of asymptomatic infections (3) and limitations in testing capacity (4, 5). Mortality
attributed to COVID-19 is widely considered to be a more reliable metric to measure epidemic trajectory
(6). However, even in countries with well-resourced health and surveillance systems, accurate
measurement of the incidence of death has proven problematic due to the high number of deaths
occurring outside of hospitals and uncertainty in attributing cause of death (7). These problems are more

acute in Upper and Lower Middle-Income Countries (UMICs, LMICs), where health system reporting
may become overwhelmed (4, 8–13).
Interpreting trends in both cases and deaths from COVID-19 is vital to understanding the dynamics of
transmission, the burden of disease, and the range of future trajectories of the epidemic. Here we seek
to better understand the epidemic in Indonesia, a nation of 274 million people reporting the secondhighest number of cases (244,676 as of 20th September, behind only the Philippines) and the heaviest
death toll (9,553 reported deaths as of 20th September) among Southeast Asian countries (2, 14). To do
so, we utilise a diverse range of data sources, including COVID-19 protocol (C19P) funeral data, as an
indirect indicator of syndromic-based mortality and population mobility estimates at a variety of spatial
scales. These are then integrated within a meta-population mathematical model of transmission to better
understand and quantify the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic. Specifically, we focus on the island of
Java, where 56% of Indonesians live and from which 59% of cases and 66% of deaths have been
reported (Figure 1). We use these data to explore possible future trajectories of the epidemic on the
island and the extent to which remaining data limitations contribute to uncertainty within these
projections.
Observed Spread of COVID-19 Across Java and Indonesia
As of 20th September 2020, there had been a total of 244,676 reported cases and 9,553 deaths in
Indonesia (14). The first reported cases of COVID-19 in the country were from two residents of Depok, in
West Java province on 2nd March 2020, although there had been concern that the disease had been
circulating widely prior to this date (15, 16). Both cases were transferred for treatment to a specialist
infectious disease hospital in Jakarta (17). The city of Jakarta subsequently became the epicenter of the
epidemic in the country, accounting for a large fraction of the country’s known COVID-19 burden (25%
and 16% of cases and deaths respectively up to 20th September 2020), and prompting the
implementation of a variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as cases and deaths rose in the
city during March and April. These included national social distancing measures encouraging people to
work, study and worship at home (15th March) (18); mandated social distancing measures implemented
on 10th April as part of a regional lockdown in Jakarta named Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar (PSBB)
in Indonesian and subsequently extended to the other parts of the Jakarta metropolitan area a few days
later (18); and a ban on domestic travel to prevent the annual migration of the population to home
villages to celebrate the festival of Eid during the month of Ramadan (24th April to 7th June) (19). On 5th
June, the city of Jakarta entered the transitional PSBB period, where some restrictions implemented
during the PSBB were relaxed (20). In late June, Indonesia entered Adaptasi Kebiasaan Baru (AKB or
‘the new normal’) period where partial lifting of the PSBB measures was implemented, allowing
companies, restaurants, and malls to resume their activities in compliance with Ministry of Health
protocols and at half-capacity (these milestones are illustrated in Figures 1A and 1B) (18). Following
this lifting of restrictions, daily COVID-19 cases and deaths have increased progressively across
Indonesia with significant subnational spread to all 34 provinces, with community transmission evident
across the six provinces of Java (Figures 1C and 1D). At the time of this study, PSBB has been
scheduled for reimplementation within Jakarta on 14th of September as an emergency measure to
protect healthcare delivery capacities (21).
Understanding Initial Establishment, Transmission and Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Jakarta
In order to understand emerging COVID-19 trajectories across Indonesia, we first sought to understand
the initial dynamics and transmission of the virus in the city of Jakarta, an urban city with a population of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.02.20198663; this version posted October 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

over 9 million and the main epicentre of the virus in Indonesia during early 2020. Three epidemiological
indicators of COVID-19 obtained from (22) are used - reported cases, reported deaths of individuals
confirmed to be COVID-19 positive prior to death, and the daily reported COVID-19 protocol (C19P)
funerals. C19P funerals are conducted when, at the time of death, the deceased were either COVID-19
positive or had COVID-19 symptoms and were either yet to be tested or to receive results. Figure 2A
shows the daily reported cases, deaths, test positivity ratios, and funerals with C19P in Jakarta. These
data are transformed into inferred dates of symptom onset using estimates of the delays between onset
and diagnosis, onset and death, and onset and funeral derived from anonymised individual-level data
from confirmed COVID-19 patients in Jakarta (Figure 2B, also see Methods and Supplementary
Figure S1). As of 2nd March, when COVID-19 was first identified in Indonesia, we estimate that 31 (2241 95% CrI) and 124 (107-139 95% CrI) confirmed deaths and C19P funerals (assuming all funerals
represent deaths due to COVID-19) had symptom onset occurring before 2nd March. Assuming an
infection fatality ratio of 0.657%, estimated from China (23) and adjusted for the population age-structure
in Jakarta, we estimate 7,920 (5,490-10,360 95% CrI) infections based on confirmed deaths (reflecting
an assumption that all undiagnosed individuals with a C19P funeral would have tested negative) or
30,830 (26,550-34,960 95% CrI) based on C19P funerals (reflecting an assumption that all undiagnosed
individuals with a C19P funeral would have tested positive) had occurred in Jakarta by 2nd March. This
suggests both substantial undetected initial transmission across the city as well as large discrepancies in
the predicted burden of COVID-19 depending on the data source used.
Estimates of the virus’ dynamics and transmissibility are also sensitive to the data source utilised. Based
on reported cases, we predict the epidemic to have peaked around mid-April, before rising again in
September 2020 to a far higher level than previously experienced in Jakarta (Figure 2B). The testpositivity rate declined in the first half of 2020, indicating increased testing rates and case-ascertainment,
which further complicate interpretation of trends based on case data alone. The effects of this bias are
visible when contrasted with the data on C19P funerals, which suggest the peak in infections likely
occurred in mid-March, and that current infection levels are only now at levels comparable to their initial
peak. The epidemic trajectory suggested by the officially reported deaths (requiring a positive COVID-19
test), which are also likely to be biased by changes in testing rates but to a lesser extent than cases, fall
between those of cases and C19P funerals.
To better quantify and understand the dynamics of spread within Jakarta, we utilise a branching-process
based methodology to generate estimates of the reproduction number over time ( ௧ ) (24). Three different
estimates are obtained based on the three reconstructed time-series of symptom-onset derived from
cases, deaths, and C19P funerals. All support the substantial impact of NPIs: we estimate ௧ to be
between 1.5 and 2.5 initially, subsequently declining to below 1 during the PSBB period followed by a
more recent increase to slightly above 1 as Jakarta entered the transitional PSBB in early June (Figure
2C). These estimates all show strong and significant correlation (0.91, 0.73, and 0.92 for cases, deaths,
and C19P funerals respectively, all with p<0.001) with observed mobility patterns as measured by
Google Mobility Reports (25) (Figure 2D). However, estimates based upon funeral trends support a
more rapid, larger, and more sustained impact of interventions than those based upon case-reporting
(which are most likely to be affected by biases associated with improved testing and ascertainment). The
correlation with within-city mobility is lowest for the deaths data, where substantial variation in day-to-day
death reporting leads to more unstable estimates of ௧ over time.
Calculating the correlation between mobility and ௧ before and after the AKB (“new-normal”) period
suggests a decoupling between transmission and mobility (as observed across other settings e.g., in

China (26)), whereby estimates of ௧ during periods of equivalent levels of mobility during AKB are lower
than estimates obtained prior to AKB (Supplementary Figure S3).
Understanding COVID-19 Risk and Subnational Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Across Java
We next sought to understand the dynamics of the epidemic’s subsequent subnational spread across the
six provinces of Java and explore how fine-scale heterogeneity in factors relevant to COVID-19 risk and
transmission might influence the burden of the disease (including demography, healthcare capacity, and
between-district mobility). Our results highlight substantial variation across the island in these risk
factors, with the proportion of individuals over the age of 50 (Figure 3A, an age above which the risk of
COVID-19 mortality markedly increases (23)) varying by over 2.5-fold between districts, as well as
substantial variation in the number of hospital beds per 1 thousand population. This latter difference is
most pronounced when comparing the comparatively well-resourced Jakarta setting (2.22 beds per
thousand population) to the poorer, more rural setting of Tasikmalaya in West Java (0.18 beds per
thousand population) (Figure 3B). Patterns of between-district mobility outside of the window of the
pandemic, estimated using mobile phone data over the period of 1st May 2011 - 30th April 2012, highlight
the extent to which these settings are connected. Between-district connectivity is particularly high during
the Ramadan period, which is marked by the large-scale movement of the population from densely
populated Jakarta to other more rural and less well-resourced regions where populations are typically
older and thus more vulnerable to morbidity and mortality as a result of COVID-19 infection (Figures 3C
and 3D).
In the absence of equivalent resolution C19P funeral data in other provinces, we applied our estimates of
the relationship between mobility and ௧ obtained from Jakartan funeral data (Figure 3E) to trends in
Google Mobility data from the remaining provinces in Java. These estimates indicate a large impact on
transmission in all provinces coinciding with the PSBB period. However, they also suggest that only in
Jakarta and Yogyakarta were measures sufficient to bring ௧ below 1 for a sustained period of time.
Across all provinces, however, increases in mobility occurred either during early May (Banten, West
Java, Central Java, and East Java) or alongside the establishment of the AKB in June (Jakarta and
Yogyakarta), leading to corresponding increases in our estimates of ௧ (Figure 3F).
To capture the subnational spread of the virus, we developed a meta-population model of SARS-CoV-2
transmission by extending an existing non-spatial model (28), with each population in the model
representing either the city of Jakarta or one of the 113 remaining districts across Java. We
parameterised the model using mobile phone data derived estimates of between-district mobility (during
both Ramadan and non-Ramadan periods, Figures 3C and 3D) prior to the pandemic, data on districtlevel demographic structure, and our estimates of within-province ௧ . Figure 4A shows the district-level
metapopulation model-based simulation results for COVID-19 deaths for our baseline scenario designed
to capture COVID-19 dynamics in Java to date, with the model calibrated to match patterns of mortality
in Jakarta by varying the degree of initial seeding of infection early in January. Table 1 shows a
comparison between simulated trends in provinces outside of Jakarta for our model to both data on
confirmed deaths and two additional, but incomplete, data sources for suspected deaths (a combination
of both confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths) in these provinces. These were weekly situation
reports compiled by WHO (18), which provide estimates of suspected deaths from 13th May onwards;
and estimates of cumulative suspected deaths based on provincial COVID-19 data monitoring website
compiled by an independent group KawalCOVID19 (29). Given our simplified assumption of a consistent
relationship between mobility and ௧ across the island and uncertainties within the underlying levels of
true Covid-19 mortality each dataset represents, we do not expect an exact match to any of these data.

However, the model appears to capture the approximate magnitude and timing of deaths across
provinces during the PSBB period, with the epicenter shifting over time from Jakarta to satellite towns
and other provincial capitals, and with Yogyakarta remaining least affected. Prior to the first week in
June, the point of transition to the AKB, ‘new-normal’ period, our median baseline model estimates fall
within the range between confirmed and suspected deaths of both WHO and provincial data in most
provinces, with total suspected deaths falling well within the uncertainty bounds of the model for all
provinces (Table 1).
In addition to this baseline scenario (Scenario 1), we use our model to explore an additional four
counterfactual scenarios across the six provinces (Figure 4B). These include a scenario assuming no
movement reductions during the Ramadan period and similar ௧ values to our baseline (Scenario 2); a
scenario assuming no movement reductions during the Ramadan period and ௧ values that are 75% of
each district’s ଴ value (Scenario 3); a scenario assuming no movement reductions during the Ramadan
period and ௧ values equal to each district’s ଴ value (Scenario 4); and an unmitigated scenario
assuming no implementation of interventions across the course of the epidemic (Scenario 5). In total, our
baseline scenario produces an estimated 3,700 (1,500-7,390, 95% uncertainty interval (UI)) deaths up to
May 31st. This provides an estimate of 71,250 (34,400-136,000, 95% UI) deaths averted when
compared to an effectively unmitigated epidemic with ௧ = 2 throughout this period (which we estimate
would have resulted in 74,990 (36,360-142,750, 95% UI)) deaths). This number does not take into
account the effects of healthcare services becoming overwhelmed (as shown by the negative values of
the median number of hospital beds available per COVID-19 case needing hospitalisation under the
unmitigated epidemic scenario, Figure 4C) on both direct and indirect mortality, an impact which would
likely have been sizable given the wider spread to more rural settings with more scarce healthcare
provision in our unmitigated scenario (Figures 4D and 4E). Our estimates also suggest that the relatively
aggressive Ramadan travel restrictions are likely to have had a sizable impact on preventing wider
spread to more vulnerable rural areas.
Our baseline model (Scenario 1) increasingly over-predicts deaths in most provinces during the
transitional PSBB and AKB ‘new-normal period’. This is in line with our results suggesting a decoupling
of within-province mobility from virus transmissibility over that period (observed across other settings
(26), which could be related to individual-level changes in population behaviour such as increased maskwearing, social distancing, changing work patterns, etc.). The reported cases in Jakarta substantially
differ from model estimates after the AKB (Supplementary Figure S4), congruent with the province
altering its testing strategy to more actively find cases and clusters of cases that include milder infections
not requiring hospitalizations. Data from other provinces (which represent hospitalised cases only and do
not include those identified through active case investigation) are more consistent with the model results.
Modelled Future Scenarios of COVID-19 Burden in Java
To better capture within-province transmission trends during the AKB and up to the present (and given
current observed community spread in all provinces), we use the simpler non-spatial model to fit
province-specific models to either reported deaths (from (14, 22)) or both reported and suspected deaths
(the C19P funerals data in the case of Jakarta (22) and collated from (18) otherwise, see Methods and
Supplementary Material) (Figure 5A). Outside of Jakarta, model estimates of the attack rate
(cumulative proportion infected) are below 5% across all provinces. In Jakarta, by contrast, the fitting
was more sensitive to our choice of metric: fitting to all suspected deaths increasing the estimated attack
rate by a factor of 4 to 14.0% (12.7-15.8%, 95% CrI), relative to the 3.5% (3.1-4.1%, 95% CrI) estimated
when restricting analysis to confirmed deaths alone (Figure 5B). Irrespective of the data sourced used,

these estimates suggest attack rates across Java to be far short of putative herd immunity thresholds,
with this threshold likely to range from 34.6% to 50% for an ଴ of 2 depending on assumptions
surrounding heterogeneities in mixing and susceptibility (30). Moreover, our province-level point
estimates for ௧ between 20th August - 4th September ranged between 1.02-1.22 and 1.05-1.29 for
confirmed and suspected deaths, respectively, indicating that burden is likely to continue to rise in the
coming weeks.
We explore a range of future scenarios in each province using combinations of three values of the
‘reproduction number under control’, ௖ , (i.e., the average number of secondary infections occurring from
an index infection in a wholly susceptible population but accounting for the impact of currently
implemented interventions): a ‘current’ scenario with ௖ =1.25 to approximate the recent trajectory of the
epidemic; a ‘suppression’ scenario where ௖  0.75, designed to represent a scenario where changes in
intervention measures are successful in achieving levels of control necessary to suppress transmission;
and a ‘return to normal’ scenario where ௖  2.0, representing levels of transmission estimated at the
beginning of the epidemic. These scenarios, using a range of estimates of transmissibility already
observed across Java to date, highlight how different assumptions about future changes in control-policy
and population-level behaviour (and their subsequent impact on ௖ ) can produce a wide array of future
epidemic trajectories (Figure 5C). Extrapolating recent trends in transmission in Jakarta (i.e., our
‘current’ scenario) suggests a situation where demand for health services will increasingly approach, and
likely exceed, capacity in the coming weeks or months (Figure 5D) but to a much lesser extent than
would occur in circumstances where ௖ further increased towards that estimated at the beginning of the
epidemic ( ௖ of 2). This scenario is largely mirrored elsewhere in Java, where, on average, current levels
of infection are lower but where dedicated healthcare services are in shorter supply. Our results suggest
that attempts to further suppress transmission, such as the recent re-imposition of PSBB in Jakarta in
recent days, if successful in reducing ௖ below 1, could largely keep healthcare within capacity.
However, this will not alleviate the need for the development of sustainable approaches to controlling
transmission over the coming year: in both our current and suppression scenarios, we estimate returning
to pre-pandemic levels of social interaction once burden has subsided to low levels (a ‘Return to Normal’
scenario, where ௖  2.0 once burden has fallen below an average of 1 death per day over the course of
a week) would risk a substantial subsequent, additional wave of infection across Java.
Our uncertainty in the underlying burden to date is also a key contributor to our uncertainty in the future
trajectory of the epidemic, particularly in Jakarta, which has the highest disparity between confirmed and
suspected deaths. For example, our projection of current trends assuming all suspected deaths are due
to COVID-19 suggests an imminent threat of the health services reaching capacity within the city. In
contrast, our projection based solely upon confirmed deaths would suggest healthcare will remain within
the capacity for longer, due to lower levels of currently active infection. However, this epidemic trajectory
results in a larger and more prolonged peak lasting well into 2021, driven by much lower levels of
accumulated immunity within the population. If current attempts to achieve suppression are successful,
this uncertainty is likely to be of even higher importance in terms of understanding the level of control
required to prevent a subsequent wave: assuming all suspected deaths are due to COVID-19, our
suppression scenarios achieve a level of immunity where current levels of ௖ could be sustained without
a major subsequent wave. By contrast, assuming only confirmed deaths are due to COVID-19 would
imply much lower levels of immunity, producing a further subsequent wave in 2021 in our suppression
scenario if ௖ returned to current levels.

Our analysis highlights the challenges in capturing the transmission dynamics during an emerging
pandemic of a novel pathogen. Basing our epidemiological inference on deaths (both diagnostically
confirmed and using C19P funeral data as an indirect measure of symptomatically suspected), we
estimate substantial circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in Jakarta prior to the date of the first confirmed COVID19 case, as well as an earlier and more sustained decline in transmissibility in response to NPIs. In
addition to the different dynamics of the reproduction number suggested when comparing inference
using cases and deaths, we demonstrate that alternative sources of mortality data can help supplement
our understanding of the historical spread of the epidemic. This is particularly evident in Jakarta, where
the estimated attack rate varies by four-fold depending on the extent to which the deaths of individuals
assessed to have been displaying COVID-19 symptoms but yet to receive a test result at the point of
death (and subsequent burial) are assumed attributable to the infection.
This undiagnosed COVID-19 burden in Jakarta and spread to date has important consequences for our
projections of the current trajectory of the epidemic and the likely longer-term impact of interventions
such as the re-establishment of measures aimed at suppressing transmission in Jakarta in recent days.
These results highlight the critical importance of placing recently observed COVID-19 dynamics within
the context of previous patterns of the spread of the disease to more accurately understand the future. In
many settings, syndromic-based measures of mortality such as C19P funeral data are not routinely
available; however, verbal autopsy provides a well-established retrospective means with which to
conduct such inference. Given the scarcity of serological surveys in many settings, such approaches are
likely to yield vital data with which to improve our understanding of the future trajectory of the epidemic
and the likely impact of different options for control.
C19P funerals and other measures of suspected mortality provide an alternative lens though which to
understand the COVID-19 burden but do not allow precise measurement. In the absence of a confirmed
diagnosis, the proportion of these individuals who were infected will always be unknown and liable to
vary in time and space, as will the extent to which measures of suspected deaths represent all deaths of
individuals displaying COVID-19 symptoms. However, irrespective of the data source used, our results
highlight the impact of NPIs employed across Java, including substantial COVID-19 associated mortality
avoided through swift implementation of control measures in response to the spread of the virus. In
particular, our analyses indicate that imposition of stringent measures in Jakarta combined with
restrictions on mobility patterns during Ramadan are likely to have delayed the seeding of epidemics to
rural, more vulnerable, areas of the island. Given subsequent upwards trends in transmission, this could
have potentially accelerated epidemics in such areas beyond currently observed levels. However,
current best estimates suggest ௧ is now above 1 in all provinces, and our results emphasise the likely
worsening of the epidemic across Java. This is consistent with recent observations that healthcare
demand in Jakarta is currently heading beyond that observed during the initial peak and threatening to
outstrip capacity in the near future (21). Our results suggest that the re-imposition of PSBB in Jakarta,
beginning on the 14th of September, if successful in suppressing transmission, could largely prevent
capacity being exceeded. However, based on current trends, the remaining provinces in Java are likely
to be faced with similar choices between re-imposition of suppression measures or exceeded healthcare
demand in the coming weeks and months.
Whilst we have attempted to propagate this past uncertainty throughout our analysis of future scenarios,
there remain numerous important uncertainties that need to be considered when interpreting these
simulations. In particular, both the level of population-level immunity acquired within each scenario (due
to factors such as the strength and duration of individual responses) (31, 32) and the level of immunity
required to achieve herd immunity are not yet well understood (30). However, none of the suppression

scenarios considered here, assuming perfect and durable immunity to reinfection, achieve levels of
immunity high enough to preclude a subsequent wave if life were to return to normal and transmissibility
were to rise to levels observed at the beginning of the epidemic ( ௧ = 2).
We cannot capture the indirect impact of either suppression measures or that of health systems
becoming stretched and/or overwhelmed in this analysis, though both are likely to be high and need to
be considered carefully by decision-makers. More broadly, our results highlight that in the short-medium
term, levels of population immunity are unlikely to develop to the extent that life in Java can return to prepandemic levels of normalcy without leading to substantial incremental increases in mortality. This
highlights the need for long-term strategic planning and the urgent need for new tools such as
therapeutics and vaccines, even in countries where transmission has not yet been suppressed.

Supplementary Material
Materials and Methods
S1. Data Sources and Curation
Epidemiological data sources for Jakarta
Epidemiological data for Jakarta were obtained from the official Jakarta COVID-19 data monitoring
website (https://corona.jakarta.go.id/id/data-pemantauan) (1). This data comprises daily reported
cases, reported deaths, funerals with COVID-19 protocol (C19P), and the number of tests. We collate
the data for analysis up to 2nd September 2020.
Anonymous individual data of 11,280 confirmed COVID-19 cases up to 29th June 2019 in Jakarta were
obtained from the Jakarta Department of Health. Data consist of dates of onset of symptoms, dates
of attendance in the hospital, and dates of deaths. The individual data were used to estimate the
delay distributions between onset to diagnosis and onset to death.
Epidemiological data sources for five other provinces in Java (Banten, West Java, Central Java,
Yogyakarta, and East Java)
Daily reported cases and reported deaths data for five other provinces in Java were obtained from
an independently curated online spreadsheet by a crowdsource organisation KawalCOVID19
(kcov.id/daftarpositif) (2) based on the daily publication by Indonesia COVID-19 National Task Force
(3) (data for analysis were collated up 2nd September 2020). The weekly number of deaths of
suspected and probable cases was obtained from WHO Indonesia situation reports 13-23 (4).
Call detail records data
Anonymised call detail records (CDRs) data from one of the biggest telecommunication companies in
Indonesia over the period of 1st May 2011 to 30th April 2012 were used to estimate between-district
movement matrices for the Ramadan and non-Ramadan period. The CDRs data were collected daily
with a total of 266 billion records and 137 million unique SIM cards. There were a total of 17,319
mobile phone towers operated during the period of CDRs data collection across the country.
Province-level mobility changes
Province-level mobility changes data were acquired from the freely-available Google COVID-19
Community Mobility Reports (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) (5). Google Mobility
Reports data up to 30th of August 2020 were used for the analysis.
Healthcare capacity data
District-level hospital and ICU beds data were obtained from the Online Healthcare Facilities
(Fasyankes Online ) website by the Directorate General of Health Services (Ditjen Yankes) of the
Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia (6).

Dedicated COVID-19 isolation beds and ICU beds data
Data for the capacity of dedicated COVID-19 isolation beds and ICU beds were obtained from a
report from the Ministry of Health in August 2020 (7).
S2. Epidemiological Data Reconstructions

Daily reported cases, reported deaths, and C19P funerals data in Jakarta were reconstructed to
represent the onset day of each reported event using estimates of the distribution of delays
between onset and diagnosis and onset and death. Each C19P funeral was assumed to occur the day
following the date of death.
The distributions of onset to diagnosis and onset to death of confirmed COVID-19 cases were
estimated by fitting discretised Gamma distributions (8) to the individual patient data obtained from
the Jakarta Department of Health (Fig S1). The mean estimate of the onset to diagnosis delay was
7.62 days, with a standard deviation of 7.51 days. The mean estimate of the onset to death delay
was 15.87 days, with a standard deviation of 9.34 days. 100 sets of reconstructed daily frequencies
of onset of cases, deaths, and funerals were then calculated on the basis of 100 draws for each
reported event from these distributions (respectively onset to hospitalisation, onset to death, and
onset to funeral). Adjustment for right censoring occurring due to individuals currently with
symptoms but have yet to reach outcome was carried out by dividing the inferred onset frequency
on a given day by the cumulative probability it would have been observed by the last date within the
dataset.

data (left) and onset-to-death delay data (right).
S3. Effective reproduction number ( ) calculations based on reconstructed
epidemiological data in Jakarta and its relationship with daily mobility changes

deaths, and funerals data were calculated against the daily average changes in non-residential
mobility in Jakarta based on Google mobility estimates. The daily average changes in non-residential
mobility is the average of changes of retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit
stations, and workplaces types of mobility to each respective baseline.
The 7-day rolling average changes of non-residential mobility were fitted to 100 posterior samples of
the estimated ,    using smoothing spline models. The implementation of the smoothing
spline model was done in R software using smooth.spline function with four knots. The models were
then used to extrapolate the daily values of
outside of Jakarta based on the province-level 7-day
rolling average of changes in non-residential mobility (Google Community Mobility Reports (5)).

S4. Estimating movement matrices from CDRs data
District level (city and municipality, 115 in total) movement matrices () prior to the pandemic for
the normal (or non-Ramadan) ( ) and Ramadan ( ) periods were calculated from CDRs data.
Each element of the matrix (, ) represents the proportion of days spent by residents of district  in
district  over the year.

The daily position of each user is described as the district where the most frequent mobile phone
usage happened over the period of a single day. All users were assumed to be active from the first
day to the last day of their phone usage. On days where the user was not active (no phone activities
recorded), the position of the user was assumed to be the same as the previous day. The primary
residence of each user is defined as the district where the users spent most of their days over their
‘active’ period. Based on their daily locations and primary residences, we then calculated the
proportion of days spent of people from district  in district  .  was estimated using data of
August and September 2011 (period of the Ramadan month, Eid celebration, and national holidays
period).  was estimated using the rest of the data that were not used to estimate  (May 2011 July 2011 and October 2011 - April 2012 periods).
All districts in the Java island were represented as a single row in each matrix with exceptions for
districts in Jakarta province which were represented as an aggregated single row of Jakarta
‘megacity’. Outside Java movements were represented as a single row (  2). Table S2 shows a
complete list of districts (including Jakarta and outside Java) and each respective index in the
movement matrix.

S6. Metapopulation Model
Metapopulation model of COVID-19 spread in Java
We developed a metapopulation model to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in Java. Each patch in
the metapopulation model represents districts (  1,2, . . . ,115) listed in Table S2. For each patch,

stochastic differential equations representing a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR)

were obtained for each

district as the average values estimated within simulations from the squire package (13), taking agespecific demography using district-level census data and, in the absence of equivalent data from
Java, mixing patterns based upon a contact survey from Shanghai province, China as an example of
contact patterns within a UMIC Asian country and province containing a megacity. The full model
parameter descriptions and specifications are available in Table S1.
The model was simulated with 100 replicates by seeding initial cases in Jakarta, and Kota Surabaya
(East Java’s capital) – both have international airports receiving travellers from China – on 7th
January 2020 (arbitrarily selected) with 100 replicates. Initial cases in Jakarta were set to 12,
obtained through calibration to provide simulated deaths trends bounded by the interval between
reported deaths and C19P funerals. Initial cases in Surabaya were drawn according to a binomial
draw assuming an underlying importation rate of 60% of that in Jakarta (14), random numbers based
on the binomial distribution were sampled for each replicate.
We assumed different transmission scenarios of districts classified as rural and urban districts. We
classified an urban/rural status to each district based upon the urban/rural classification of the
majority of villages within the district. We assigned , values for all districts to be the province-level
value of , in which each district is located. We then explore the possibilities of rural districts to
have different , levels, ranging from 100% to 60% of province-level , . In the results section of
the main text, we show simulation results assuming , in rural districts to be 90% of , in urban
districts. We also ran the model for several different counterfactual scenarios. The list of
transmission scenarios and the counterfactual scenarios were shown in Table S3.
During the period of Ramadan and Eid festivals, 24th April 2020 up to 7th June 2020, the Ramadan
movement matrix ( ) was used as the baseline movement matrix. In the other period, the nonRamadan movement matrix ( ) was used as the baseline movement matrix. As a baseline
assumption, throughout the simulation, the proportions of people spending their time in other
districts (, where  +  ) were adjusted by the province-level changes in mobility over time, with
reductions in larger-scale movement outside the province assumed to be higher than those within
the province according to an odds ratio (OR) of 2 within our default scenario.
For each scenario, we also devised a metric to assess the extent to which the epidemic would be
likely to strain available healthcare resources over time given patterns of spatial spread and
disparities in healthcare supply by district. This metric was defined by determining the number of
available beds for each individual newly requiring hospitalisation each day within the model by
subtracting the number of hospital beds required in the simulation from the total hospital beds
capacity available at the district-level obtained from the Online Healthcare Facilities website (6).

S7. Model fitting to confirmed and suspected COVID-19 deaths and future projection
scenarios in all provinces in Java
Estimating the number of deaths from suspected and probable cases in Java provinces
Jakarta reported a time series dataset of the province daily C19P funerals in their official COVID-19
tracker website
(https://corona.jakarta.go.id/id/data-pemantauan)
(1)
which
includes
confirmed/reported and probable COVID-19 deaths (both combined were then defined as suspected
deaths). Whilst for the other five provinces in Java, daily time series data of probable deaths are not
available. WHO Indonesia situation reports provide a weekly summary of confirmed and probable
deaths (which both combined become suspected deaths) in all provinces in Java since the end of
May 2020 (Figure S7) (4). We collated these data and calculated the proportion of confirmed deaths
from suspected COVID-19 deaths for each province (2 with  as each province index).
For all days from 1st March 2020, up to 2nd September 2020, we simulated the number of probable
deaths in five Java provinces other than Jakarta. Firstly, we aggregated the daily confirmed deaths in
each province to a weekly period (/, with  as the weekly time window). For each weekly time
window  , using Negative Binomial distribution, we simulated the number of probable deaths (3, )
in each province 10 times:

3,  ("/, , 2 .
For each simulated 3, , we simulated the spread of the weekly total estimated probable deaths into
daily estimated probable deaths using Multinomial distribution, assuming equal probability for all
days during the week 10 times:

,  4$3, , 5
where 5 is a vector of length 7, where each value is 1/7.
The simulations resulted in 100 samples of estimated daily probable deaths in each province. Adding
the simulated daily probable deaths to the daily confirmed deaths, we obtained 100 samples of the
estimated number of daily suspected COVID-19 deaths in five provinces in Java other than Jakarta.

The daily suspected COVID-19 deaths are then defined, for Jakarta, as the daily C19P funerals, and
for five other Java provinces as the median of the estimated number of the daily suspected COVID19 deaths.
Model fitting
Using the framework developed in the Imperial College COVID-19 LMIC reports (18), we fit the
model to both the daily COVID-19 confirmed deaths and the daily COVID-19 suspected deaths data
for each province in Java, estimating both a province-specific
and epidemic start date. To provide
model fits that are agnostic to the mobility profiles in each province, we model the time-varying
reproduction number,
, using a series of pseudo-random walk parameters, which alter the
given by:
transmission every 2-weeks, with



. 2  2 . . . 2 

Where *  2 **/1  **, i.e. twice the inverse logit function, which has been used
in previous models to capture the impact of mobility data on transmission (19). Each 2 parameter is
introduced two weeks after the previous parameter, serving to capture changes in transmission over
time. More specifically, each 2 parameter is set equal to 0 for each day prior to its start date. For
example, 2 is the change in transmission, which is set to start at the beginning of the epidemic. The
estimated value for 2 is then maintained for all future time points. 2 is the second change in
transmission, which starts 14 days after the epidemic start date, i.e. is equal to 0 prior to this. The
last mobility independent change in transmission, 2 is maintained for the last 4 weeks prior to the
current day to reflect our inability to estimate the effect size of this parameter due to the
approximate 21 day delay between infection and death (16).
The model fitting results were presented in Figure S9 & S10. Based on the fitted models in all
provinces considering different types of deaths data, we estimated the attack rate at the province
level and Java level.
Future projection scenarios
Using the same modelling framework for the model fitting process, we did forward projections
based on scenarios described in Table S4.
