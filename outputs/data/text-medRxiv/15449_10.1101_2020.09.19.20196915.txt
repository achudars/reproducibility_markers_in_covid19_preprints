The Effects of India’s COVID-19 Lockdown on Critical Non-COVID Health Care and
Outcomes:
Evidence from a Retrospective Cohort Analysis of Dialysis Patients
Authors: Radhika Jain, Pascaline Dupas1
Working Paper Under Review
Abstract: India’s COVID-19 lockdown, one of the most severe in the world, is widely believed
to have disrupted critical non-COVID health services. However, linking these disruptions to
effects on health outcomes has been difficult due to the lack of reliable, up-to-date health
outcomes data. We identified all dialysis patients under a statewide health insurance program in
Rajasthan, India, and conducted surveys to examine the effects of the lockdown on care access,
morbidity, and mortality. 63% of patients experienced a disruption to their care. Transport
barriers, hospital service disruptions, and difficulty obtaining medicines were the most common
causes. We compared monthly mortality in the four months after the lockdown with prelockdown mortality trends, as well as with mortality trends for a similar cohort in the previous
year. Mortality in May 2020, after a month of exposure to the lockdown, was 1.70 percentage
points or 64% (p=0.01) higher than in March 2020 and total excess mortality between April and
July was estimated to be 22%. Post-lockdown morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality were
strongly positively associated with lockdown-related disruptions to care, providing further
evidence that the uptick in mortality was driven by the lockdown. Females, socioeconomically
disadvantaged groups, and patients living far from the health system faced worse outcomes. The
results highlight the unintended consequences of the lockdown on critical, life-saving nonCOVID health services that must be taken into account in the implementation of future policy
efforts to control the spread of pandemics.
Main Text:
On 24 March 2020, the Government of India ordered one of the most stringent nationwide
COVID-19 lockdowns in the world to control virus spread (Hale et al 2020). The lockdown was
announced with four hours’ notice, barred people from leaving their homes, required nonessential commercial establishments and transport services to close, and was enforced strictly
with penalty of arrest (Ministry of Home Affairs 2020). National restrictions were eased 10
weeks later, at the beginning of June, but localized restrictions continued in areas with high case
counts.
Although critical health services were officially exempt from the lockdown, the media reported
widespread disruptions to routine and emergency non-COVID care due to transport and curfew
barriers for patients and health workers, hospitals turning patients away, and supply chain
disruptions that affected medicine access and costs (IndiaSpend 2020, Indian Express 2020, New
York Times 2020). Medical services under government health insurance programs across the
country decreased by 51% and the national Health Management Information System (HMIS) ,

which collates monthly reports from the public health system, reported dramatic decreases in
preventive and curative care (Smith et al 2020, IndiaSpend 2020).
Careful measurement of the indirect morbidity and mortality effects of the lockdown is critical to
understanding the full consequences of the pandemic and how to prepare health systems better
for future disease outbreaks (Kiang et al 2020, Beaney et al 2020, Setel et al 2020).
However, quantifying these impacts has been difficult in the Indian context due to the
unavailability of reliable and high frequency data measuring health outcomes and cause-specific
mortality. Because the COVID-19 lockdown may have reduced deaths from some causes, such
as road accidents, evaluating its effects requires disaggregated cause-specific mortality. The vast
majority of deaths in India occur at home, rather than at health facilities, are not included in the
national Civil Registration System, and have no certified cause of death (Jha et al 2005). While
government health insurance programs collect real-time data on hospital services provided, they
record no details on patient morbidity or mortality. The HMIS data are typically of low quality,
underrepresent care in the private sector, and do not provide complete morbidity or mortality
outcomes (Sharma et al 2016). The Sample Registration System, which estimates age-specific
death rates through population surveys, does not provide details on cause of death and the most
recent report only provides total mortality estimates through 2018 (SRS Bulletin).
Given the dearth of reliable, updated, and publicly available data on health outcomes in India,
evaluating the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on non-elective health services requires the
identification of patients in need of such care and the collection of primary data. We used
insurance claims filed under a largescale government health insurance program to identify
patients requiring dialysis, a form of non-elective chronic care, during the lockdown. We
conducted phone surveys with their households to estimate the effects of the lockdown on health
care access, morbidity, and mortality in the four months following its imposition. To our
knowledge, we provide some of the first quantitative measures of the effects of India’s lockdown
on excess mortality from non-COVID health conditions.

DIALYSIS IN INDIA
We focused on dialysis, a form of life-sustaining long-term hospital care for patients with end
stage chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is the 17th leading cause of deaths globally and 8th in
India (GBD 2015). Although access to dialysis treatment is relatively low, the expansion of
government health insurance has increased its reach and a 2019 study estimated that there are
approximately 175,000 CKD patients on dialysis in India (Jha et al 2019). Dialysis removes
waste, salts, and excess water to prevent their build up in the body; regulates levels of potassium,
sodium and bicarbonate in the blood; and controls blood pressure. The typical patient requires
three- to four-hour sessions, two to four times each week for the duration of their life or until
they get a kidney transplant. Disruptions to dialysis treatment result in the accumulation of fluids
and toxins in the body, and can cause extreme swelling, nausea and vomiting, difficulty in
breathing and urinating, and other symptoms. Missing dialysis visits or shortening their duration
is associated with large increases in hospitalization and mortality (Saran et al 2003, Anderson et
al 2009, Zoraster et al 2007, Abdel-Kadar et al 2009). Recent work documents substantial

disruptions to dialysis care in India during the lockdown, but does not link them to health
outcomes (Smith et al 2020, Ramachandran and Jha 2020, Prasad et al 2020).

METHODS
Study Population and Data
We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis to study care-seeking and health outcomes before
and after the COVID-19 lockdown. The study population was all dialysis patients enrolled in a
government health insurance program that covers the poorest two-thirds of Rajasthan’s
population. The Ayushman Bharat Mahatma Gandhi Rajasthan Swasthya Bima Yojana (ABMGRSBY), is a statewide government health insurance program in Rajasthan, India. It entitles
approximately 50 million low-income individuals to free secondary and tertiary care at over
1200 empaneled hospitals. Household eligibility is based on state poverty lists. All members are
automatically enrolled and face no premium, deductible, or copay. Hospitals file claims in realtime for every patient visit through the government’s electronic filing system. These claims data,
which include patient name, phone number, address, hospital visited, and services received,
provide one of the only ways of directly identifying patients utilizing hospital care in Rajasthan.
We obtained access to all administrative claims data filed under the program from its launch
through October 2019. Using the last 3 months of these data, we identified all patients on dialysis
under insurance between August and October 2019. Because dialysis is long-term and nonelective care, patients on dialysis in late 2019 would continue to require it through the COVID19 lockdown if still alive. Therefore, these patients provide an ideal group to study the effects of
the lockdown on critical chronic care.
To collect data on health care access and outcomes through the lockdown period, we conducted
phone surveys using patient contact numbers in the administrative records. The survey was
conducted with the patient or the person in the household most knowledgeable of their care if the
patient was unwell or dead, and collected data on dialysis visits in the month prior to the
lockdown, disruptions to care due to the lockdown, morbidity, hospitalization, the date and cause
of death, and basic demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. We also embedded openended questions into the surveys to collect qualitative descriptions from patients about care
disruptions faced. We completed the first round of surveys between late May 2020 and mid-June
2020, and follow-up surveys in July and August with all patients alive at the time of the first
survey to track complete mortality through July. To help put survey results into context, we also
conducted structured interviews with 15 hospitals from 10 of Rajasthan’s 33 districts.
Outcomes and Measures
We measured disruptions to dialysis care by asking whether patients faced each of the following
problems during the lockdown: their dialysis hospital was closed; it was open but refused to
provide them services; they could not travel to their hospital due to lack of transport or curfews;
they had to switch to a different hospital from their primary dialysis hospital; their hospital
increased charges over the typical payment; they had difficulties obtaining their dialysis
medicines. Reported dialysis visits were used to create an indicator for any decrease in visits
between the month before and after the lockdown. We created an individual care disruptions

index using the first component of a principal-components analysis (PCA) of all of these
indicators, and standardized it over the study sample for ease of interpretation.
To track changes in monthly mortality over the months before and after the lockdown, we
created a mortality time series between December 2019 and July 2020. We determined the
month of death for all dead patients by cross-checking two measures - the exact month of death
and the number of months that had lapsed since the death at the time of survey - as well as the
cause and location of death to ensure it was not unrelated to dialysis. Monthly mortality, or the
likelihood of death, was calculated as the number of deaths each month as a share of people alive
at the beginning of that month.
Morbidity and hospitalization were reported for the four weeks prior to the survey, in each round
of the survey. A morbidity index was constructed from a PCA of indicators for whether the
patient experienced the following symptoms that are known to follow disruptions to dialysis care
and can be reported by patients: swelling of the face, hands, legs, or body; vomiting or nausea;
extreme tiredness or weakness; difficulty breathing; difficulty urinating; and muscle cramps. The
index was standardized over the sample. Hospitalization was an indicator for any in-patient
hospital visit.
To examine heterogeneity in outcomes by socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, we
created binary classifications for female, age under 45 years, lower caste group (scheduled caste
or tribe), and low assets. Patients were classified as low asset if they had a below median score
on an asset index created from a PCA of a list of assets they own, such as a motorcycle,
television, or air-conditioner. Additionally, we geocoded all dialysis hospitals in the ABMGRSBY program as well as the residence locations for 88% of surveyed patients using
addresses in the administrative data that were verified by survey. We calculated the distance
from patient residence to the district administrative headquarters, the largest city in the district,
as a proxy for remoteness, and to the closest dialysis hospital as a proxy for distance from the
health system. For heterogeneity analysis, we created binary classifications for above and below
the median distance in the study sample, which was 45km for distance to the city and 35km for
distance to a dialysis hospital.
Comparison Cohort
Because the COVID-19 lockdown was implemented across all of India at the same time, there
are no comparable “untreated” populations in 2020. Therefore, our analysis primarily focused on
changes in mortality trends within our study cohort over the four months before and after the
lockdown was imposed. In addition, we constructed a historical comparison cohort to allow us to
account for potential seasonal trends or monthly fluctuations in mortality and to examine
whether 2020 mortality follows historical trends. Using the same administrative insurance claims
data, we identified all patients on dialysis under insurance between August and October 2018.
Because phone surveys with these patients would likely suffer from attrition and recall bias, we
instead used the share of patients that permanently dropped out from dialysis care each month to
proxy for the share of people that died in that month. We have previously validated this measure
of mortality through surveys and confirmed that 80% of patients that dropped out of claims had
died and the remaining 20% had dropped out for reasons besides death (exiting the insurance
program, out of state migration, kidney transplant, or discontinuation of treatment for financial

reasons). Monthly mortality in the historical cohort was, therefore, calculated as the 80% of the
share of all patients on dialysis each month that dropped out of treatment in that month.
Statistical Analysis
To examine changes in monthly mortality before and after the lockdown, we estimated a nonparametric discrete-time logistic model with the probability of death as the outcome and binary
indicators for each month from December 2019 to July 2020. We excluded October and
November 2019 from the analysis because survey dropout was likely to be highest in these
months and could bias mortality estimates, but complete death counts for the full period are
provided in the supplement. Adjusted models included indicators for age above 45 years, female
sex, low caste group, and high assets, and continuous measures of months on dialysis and total
dialysis visits at baseline. To examine historical mortality trends, we ran the same unadjusted
model on the comparison cohort with indicators for each month from December 2018 to July
2019, as well as a model adjusted for age above 45 years and total dialysis visits prior to
enrollment. Standard errors were clustered at the patient level in all models to account for
autocorrelation.
To analyze the association between care disruptions and post-lockdown health outcomes, we
restricted the sample to patients alive at the end of April and exposed to at least one month of the
lockdown, and ran linear OLS regressions, with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors, of
post-lockdown morbidity, hospitalization, and death on the care disruptions index. Adjusted
models included indicators for age above 45 years, female sex, low caste group, and low assets,
as well as continuous measures of months on dialysis and total dialysis visits at baseline.
Sensitivity to using logistic regression models was also assessed.
We also examined whether the lockdown had differential effects on care-seeking by sex, age
(above 45 years), low caste, and low assets, we estimated bivariate and multivariate logistic
regressions of an indicator for having experienced any disruption on binary indicators for each
subgroup characteristic. To study heterogeneity in effects on mortality, we calculated the
percentage point change in monthly mortality between March and May for each subgroup from
logistic regressions controlling for all other subgroup characteristics and dialysis history. Lastly,
we examined the association between care disruptions and post-lockdown health outcomes by
running separate OLS regressions with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors for each
subgroup of post-lockdown morbidity, hospitalization, and death on the care disruptions index.

RESULTS
We identified 3,183 patients on dialysis under insurance between August and October 2019
across Rajasthan. Of these, 2,234 (70.2%) had a reachable phone number and confirmed having
an eligible dialysis patient, and 94% of them consented to participating, resulting in a study
sample of 2,110 patients (supplementary table S1). Attrition may be due to numbers being
entered incorrectly in the insurance data, households changing numbers, or unused numbers
being deactivated and reassigned to new households. Of the 1,392 patients alive at the time of the
first survey, 1,177 (85%) completed a follow-up survey. Successfully surveyed patients were
disproportionately male (69%), had a mean age of 46 years, and had been on dialysis for a year,
with 5 visits per month on average, when they were enrolled into the study (Table 1). Surveyed

patients were almost identical in these characteristics to patients not reached, but had been on
dialysis for slightly longer, increasing our confidence that attrition did not meaningfully bias our
sample (supplement table S2). On average, patients lived 25km from the nearest hospital
providing dialysis care. The vast majority of patients (83%) were visiting a private hospital for
their dialysis treatments.

Disruptions to Dialysis Care
Over 62% of patients reported a disruption in access to dialysis care during the lockdown (Figure
1). 42% of patients reported being unable to reach their hospital due to travel barriers. Openended interviews indicated that travel barriers were largely due to difficulties finding transport
and obtaining official exemptions from district administrative and health authorities to travel to
the hospital visits. 15% of patients found the hospital was closed or refused to provide care, 11%
faced increased hospital charges, and 23% had to switch to a different hospital from the one they
typically visit. Interviews suggest supply chains disruptions reduced medicine availability and
increased prices. As a result, 17% of patients could not obtain their necessary medicines. Patients
faced a 172% increase in payments per visit, driven largely by increased charges at private
hospitals, and a 6% average decline in monthly visits between March and April. Hospital
interviews confirmed patient reports, but also suggested that hospitals faced their own
constraints.
Seven of the 15 hospitals reported having to during the lockdown due to staffing and supply
shortages. Those that continued operating reported a substantial drop in patient visits, which they
credited to transportation barriers, and larger hospitals reported receiving patients displaced from
nearby hospitals that had closed.
Changes in Mortality Trends
Monthly mortality declined steadily from December to March in the 2019-2020 cohort (Figure
2), due to higher early mortality among the most vulnerable patients, such as the elderly and
lower caste (supplement Figure S1). Mortality in May 2020, after a full month of exposure to the
lockdown, increased sharply to 4.37%, a 1.70pp or 63.60% (p=0.01) increase relative to 2.67%
mortality in March, prior to the lockdown. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and
dialysis history increased this difference (supplement FigS2). Mortality declined in June and July
2020, but never dropped below March levels, indicating that deaths in May were not simply a
displacement of mortality from the subsequent two months. Because we did not reach all
households in the follow-up survey, true mortality in this period may be higher than measured.
Mortality in the comparison cohort from the previous year followed a statistically similar trend
between December and April, but exhibited no increase in May or the subsequent months.
Comparison of the two trends suggests that the sharp increase in May 2020 is not explained by
seasonal fluctuations and that, absent the lockdown, monthly mortality would have remained
similar to or slightly below March levels. Only four patients who died in June and July were
reported testing positive for COVID-19. Excluding them reduces mortality to 3.16% in June and
2.69% in July.
To estimate total excess mortality in the four months following the COVID-19 lockdown, we
calculated the difference between observed mortality between April and July 2020 and what
mortality would have been if the March 2020 mortality probability of 2.67% had applied each

month. Out of 1,532 patients alive at the end of March, 192 had died by the end of July (12.54%
mortality), whereas 157 would have died had the March rate (10.25% mortality), resulting in
22.3% total estimated excess mortality in the four months following the lockdown (supplement
table S4). This is likely to be a conservative estimate, as both pre-lockdown trends and the
historical comparison suggest that mortality would have continued to decline in the absence of
the lockdown rather than remain at March levels.

Association Between Care Disruptions and Post-lockdown Outcomes
Among patients alive at the end of April and exposed to at least one month of the lockdown, a
1SD increase in the care disruptions index was associated with a 0.17SD increase in the
morbidity index (p=0.000), 3.1pp increase in the probability of hospitalization (p=0.002), and
2.1pp increase in the probability of death (p=0.013) in the period from May to July (Table 2).
These effects are sizeable relative to an overall 14.2% hospitalization and 10.8% mortality
hazard over those months. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and dialysis history
did not change these relationships. They also remain robust to using logistic instead OLS
regression models for the binary hospitalization and death outcomes (supplemental table S5).
Subgroup Heterogeneity in Lockdown Effects
Although the lockdown was universal, its effects on care-seeking were worse for vulnerable and
remote households. Being lower caste, poorer, and living further away from a city or a dialysis
hospital had large and significant positive associations with the likelihood of facing any
disruption (Table 3). Poverty had the strongest relationship and remained significant in
multivariate regressions controlling for other socioeconomic characteristics and dialysis history.
Figure 3 presents the change in mortality in May relative to March by subgroup. Underlying data
are presented in supplemental table S6. The increase in mortality was largest and significant for
females (3.56pp, p=0.022), patients 45 years or younger (2.94pp, p=0.006), poorer patients
(2.81pp, p=0.020), those living further from the city (3.51pp, p=0.013) and those living further
from a dialysis hospital (5.64pp, p=0.031). The association between the care disruptions index
and post-lockdown morbidity, hospitalization, and death were also stronger for these subgroups
(supplement figure S3). The greater disruptions to care faced by poorer and remote patients
noted above could partly explain their worse outcomes. However, we find no evidence that
females experienced greater disruptions. One explanation for high female mortality may be
lower care-seeking by households, consistent with prior literature on gender bias in health care in
India (Anonymous 2021, Kapoor et al 2019, Shaikh et al 2018). Females had fewer monthly
dialysis visits at baseline (4.8 visits) relative to males (5.1 visits, p=0.062), which could
contribute to worse health prior to the lockdown. Additionally, care disruptions were associated
with increased morbidity for both males and females, but with increased hospitalization only for
males, and larger increases in mortality for females, suggesting that households may have been
less likely to seek hospital care for females that faced complications (supplement figure S3).
DISCUSSION
We studied the indirect effects of India’s COVID-19 lockdown on critical, chronic, non-COVID
care and outcomes among a large cohort of low-income dialysis patients. Dialysis patients faced
substantial disruptions to their care during the lockdown. Travel barriers, due to the closure of

public transport and administrative hurdles in obtaining exemptions for medical travel, were the
most common cause. Hospital closures, service refusals, and increased charges forced patients to
switch hospitals and miss or delay treatment.
Mortality in May 2020, after a month of exposure to the lockdown, increased sharply. The timing
and size of the increase in mortality relative to pre-lockdown trends in 2020, as well as to trends
in estimated mortality for a similar cohort in the previous year, strongly suggests that the
observed increase was due to the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. Lockdown-related
disruptions to dialysis care were strongly positively associated with post-lockdown morbidity
and mortality, providing additional support for a causal interpretation. Estimated overall excess
mortality in the four months after imposition of the lockdown was 22%.
This excess mortality is unlikely to be due to COVID-19 infections. Although patients on
dialysis are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and complications (Gansevoort and Hilbrands
2020), if this were driving mortality, we would expect deaths to increase over time as the virus
spread and to affect older patients more. However, the increase in mortality was largest in May,
soon after the lockdown and before the virus had spread widely, and was greater among patients
under age 45 than among older patients who have higher COVID-19 mortality risk. Therefore,
we believe our estimates are capturing the indirect effects of the pandemic through lockdown
related disruptions to care. Nevertheless, given that COVID-19 testing rates in India were
relatively low at the time of the study, we cannot rule out the possibility that it contributed to the
deaths we measured.
Importantly, we find that the effects of the lockdown on care-seeking and mortality were more
severe among females, patients of low socioeconomic status, and those in remote locations
underserved by the health system. These results indicate that a universal lockdown policy is
likely to have larger adverse effects on already vulnerable subpopulations, consistent with the
literature on the unequal distribution of both direct and indirect effects of the pandemic (Bambra
et al 2020, Marmot and Allen 2020, Cash and Patel 2020). It is critical that future pandemic
control efforts take these distributional consequences into account and put in place extra
protections for populations that have limited financial and geographic access to health services.
While our analysis is restricted to one type of critical chronic care in one state, our findings are
likely to be indicative of the serious but largely undocumented health effects of severe
disruptions to a range of similar critical chronic care services in other states in India. A 2019
study estimated that there are approximately 175,000 patients on chronic dialysis across India
(Jha et al 2019). Based on recent research and media reports, it is likely that a large share of
these patients suffered life-threatening disruptions to their care (Ramachandran and Jha 2020,
Prasad et al 2020). Furthermore, national government health insurance programs targeting lowincome households have seen a 6% reduction in dialysis care (similar to our results), a 64%
decline in oncology care, and an 80% decrease in critical cardiovascular surgeries (Smith et al
2020).
A strength of this study is the use of existing administrative government health insurance data to
rapidly identify and remotely survey a large sample of poor dialysis patients in need of critical
care during the lockdown. However, a limitation of this approach is the substantial dropout

between identified patients and those reached for survey by phone due to patient phone numbers
entered incorrectly in the claims data, households switching phone numbers, and unused
numbers being deactivated. Surveyed patients were almost identical to those not reached,
increasing confidence that attrition did not bias our study sample. Deactivation, which happens
after 6 months, are most likely to affect patients that died soon after October 2019 and is unlikely
to explain the increased mortality in May 2020. Another limitation is that our outcomes are based
on self-reported data and not clinical measures, which were infeasible due to the pandemic.
However, our primary outcome is mortality, which is likely to be reliably reported, and the recall
period for all outcomes was relatively short. Finally, as we only measure mortality through July,
our estimates may be a lower bound on the full health costs of the lockdown. We found that
disruptions to dialysis were lower but persistent in July and August, after the lockdown was
eased, suggesting that adverse health effects may continue to unfold over the coming months
(supplement figure S4).
Lockdowns can reduce COVID-19 transmission (Flaxman et al 2020, Figueiredo et al 2020,
Islam et al 2020). However, they have substantial indirect health and economic costs that may
outweigh their benefits relative to other pandemic control strategies in some contexts (Douglas et
al 2020, Modesti et al 2020, Haug et al, 2020, Cash and Patel 2020). In India, these costs were
exacerbated by the hasty imposition of the lockdown, which gave the health system and
households little time to prepare (The Lancet 2020). Our findings highlight the unintended
consequences of India’s lockdown on critical non-COVID health services that must be taken into
account in the implementation of future policy efforts to control the spread of pandemics.

percentage terms for ease of interpretation. Covariate-adjusted models in the online supplement look almost
identical.

Figure 3: Changes in mortality between March and May by subgroup. Bars represent the percentage point
change in mortality between March and May 2020 for the full sample and each subgroup. Each model is adjusted for
all other characteristics (indicators for age, sex, caste, and asset group), as well as total dialysis visits prior to
enrollment. Unadjusted models are in supplemental figure S4. Lines represent 90% and 95% confidence intervals.
The grey figures on the right present the increase between March and May as a percentage of March mortality.

Table 1: Study Sample Characteristics
Dialysis history is drawn from administrative claims data on all dialysis treatment received prior to enrollment in the
study in October 2019. Distance to subdistrict HQ is the distance in km to administrative center of the subdistrict, a
proxy for distance to the closest city. Distance to dialysis hospital is the distance to the closest hospital providing
dialysis under insurance, a proxy for distance from the health system.

Table 2: Association between care disruptions and post-lockdown health outcomes
The table presents linear regressions of each health outcome on a standardized index of lockdown-related
disruptions to dialysis care for the 1,489 patients alive thorough April and exposed to at least one full month of the
lockdown. Morbidity is a standardized index of symptoms known to follow disruptions to dialysis. Hospital and
death are binary outcomes. All three outcomes are measured over the period May through July 2020. Covariates in
adjusted regressions include age, sex, caste group, month of dialysis initiation, and lifetime dialysis visits at
baseline.

The table presents similar regressions as in Table 2 of the paper of health outcomes on the care disruptions index for
the 1,489 patients alive thorough April, but estimates logistic instead of OLS models to account for the fact that
hospitalization and death are binary outcomes. Covariates in adjusted regressions include age, sex, caste group,
month of dialysis initiation, and lifetime dialysis visits at baseline.

Figure S1. Unadjusted mortality trends by subgroup

The figures present the full mortality trends over time from unadjusted models of the likelihood of death on the
interaction of indicators for month and subgroup.

Figure S2. Covariate-adjusted monthly dialysis mortality

The figure presents mortality estimates adjusted for age, sex, caste group, month on dialysis, and lifetime dialysis
visits at baseline for the 2019-2020 cohort and age, sex, months on dialysis, and lifetime dialysis visits at baseline
(variables available in the claims data) for the 2018-2019 cohort.

Figure S3. Associations between disruptions and health outcomes by subgroup

The figure presents associations between the care disruptions index and post-lockdown health outcomes by
subgroup for the 1,489 patients alive through the end of April and exposed to at least one month of the lockdown.
Each bar is the coefficient on a indicator for the subgroup characteristic from an OLS regression with robust
standard errors and controls for all other characteristics (age, sex, caste group, and asset class) and dialysis history at
baseline. The outcomes are the standardized morbidity index, and indicators for hospitalization, death in May, and
death between May and July.

Figure S4. Disruptions to Dialysis Care in July and August

The figure presents the share of people that reported experiencing disruptions in the four weeks prior to the survey,
for all patients re-interviewed in July and August. These results suggest that disruptions to dialysis care continued
well after the nationwide lockdown was released and may continue to have effects on morbidity and mortality in the
coming months.

Qualitative interviews with patients and hospitals
To gain a more nuanced understanding of patients’ experiences, we built open-ended questions
into the survey. Surveyors were instructed to provide prompts, such as “Have you experienced
any other health problems or difficulties in getting dialysis care due to the coronavirus
lockdown? Can you describe them to me?” and to encourage respondents to answer freely. The
research team listened to voice recordings of these answers and compiled them into structured
summaries. The qualitative results confirmed that the list of barriers to care-seeking we included
in the survey were comprehensive and covered the key proximate causes of care disruptions:
hospital closure or service refusal, increased costs of care, travel/transport barriers, having to
switch from their primary hospital to a different one, and difficulty obtaining medicines. They
also reveal that many patients experienced a series of different barriers that had compounded
effects on their care. Excerpts from some open-ended answers:
“The hospital was closed on visits and refused treatment as well. […] We did not have a mode of
transport to reach the hospital, I had to try very hard to arrange one. […] As a result, I could
only get 3 dialysis visits in total instead of 8.”
“There was no doctor in the hospital. No one gave us any information where to find one, there
was just one ward boy who did not know anything. […] For getting a treatment that my life
depends on, I had to get slips from doctors, permissions from District Collector, stand in long
queues...”
“There is this particular medicine that is required for dialysis procedure and that is not
currently available in the market. We have not been able to find it for the last few days. […]
Private dialysis centers have increased their rates - it has become unaffordable for us. We don't
have money to seek treatment in a private hospital, we have lost our jobs so don't have enough
money to go get treated in a private hospital, hence I had to take my wife very far to find a public
hospital for dialysis. […] Every time we change a hospital, they issue a new set of tests and we
have to get them because they will not give us dialysis otherwise. […] Due to shutdown of public
transport, I have to now take my wife to dialysis. Because of that neither can I work nor I can be
with my wife during her visits.”
“I went to two private hospitals, both of them were closed, hence I had to go to a public hospital
and got my dialysis there. […] The cost of acquiring my dialysis medicines almost doubled, as
they were not available at my regular pharmacist, my hospital was closed, I had to look
everywhere and they were available in limited quantities only.”
“I have been advised to get three dialysis visits per week. Now because of the lockdown, I have
only been able to get two per week. Hence, water fills in my lungs and I have difficulty breathing
if I do any physical activity.”
Family member of dead patient: “We live in [District A] and the hospital he regularly visited
was in [District B]. When the lockdown was imposed and there was a curfew, he had to find a
smaller, alternative facility for dialysis. We were asked to get permissions and multiple slips
from govt officials. He didn't get the care he usually received. That smaller hospital didn't do his

dialysis properly and that's why he died. […] The medicines that were prescribed to him were
only available in [District B] and not his local area due to the lockdown. He missed his
medicines for BP and diabetes for 20 days.”
Family member of dead patient: “Due to the lockdown, the patient couldn't travel to [District B]
on time and wasn't able to find a hospital in the vicinity, so he died on the way to the hospital
itself.”
Ethical considerations
The research protocol and survey instruments were approved by the Institutional Review Boards
of the Institute for Financial Management and Research (IFMR) in India and Stanford University
in the United States. All data collection was managed by a team employed by JPAL South Asia
at IFMR, which has extensive research conducting field and phone-based research. Standard
research protocols were followed. Participants were informed of the nature and possible
consequences of the study and were given the opportunity to discontinue participation at any
point of their choosing.
Given that data were being collected during a pandemic that may have severely adversely affected households, the
households in our sample may have been particularly vulnerable due to their socioeconomic status and illness, and
the health and security of our data team was also a concern, we took several additional precautions to reduce any
adverse consequences. To reduce the burden on households, we designed the surveys to be short: among surveyed
households, the first round of the survey took 25 minutes and the second follow-up round took 13 minutes, on
average. We trained surveyors to very clearly offer households the option not to participate, to be sensitive to
households during the survey, particularly those that had faced substantial difficulties or deaths, and to provide all
households with information on local COVID-19 and hospital health service helplines to consult if they experience
medical problems. To protect the surveyors, all surveys were conducted over the phone from the security of their
homes. Additional software was installed on the surveyor tablets to mask phone numbers from them and to
automatically upload all data to secure cloud services without storing it locally
