Abstract
Background: Global demand for a COVID-19 vaccine will exceed the initial limited supply.
Identifying individuals at highest risk of COVID-19 death may help allocation prioritization
efforts. Personalized risk prediction that uses a broad range of comorbidities requires a cohort
size larger than that reported in prior studies.
Methods: Medicare claims data was used to identify patients age 65 years or older with
diagnosis of COVID-19 between April 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020. Demographic
characteristics, chronic medical conditions, and other patient risk factors that existed before the
advent of COVID-19 were identified. A random forest model was used to empirically explore
factors associated with COVID-19 death. The independent impact of factors identified were
quantified using multivariate logistic regression with random effects.
Results: We identified 534,023 COVID-19 patients of whom 38,066 had an inpatient death.
Demographic characteristics associated with COVID-19 death included advanced age (85 years
or older: aOR: 2.07; 95% CI, 1.99-2.16), male sex (aOR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.82-1.94), and nonwhite race (Hispanic: aOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.66-1.83). Leading comorbidities associated with
COVID-19 mortality included sickle cell disease (aOR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.21-2.47), chronic kidney
disease (aOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.29-1.36), leukemias and lymphomas (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.141.30), heart failure (aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.16-1.22), and diabetes (aOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.151.22).
Conclusions: We created a personalized risk prediction calculator to identify candidates for
early vaccine and therapeutics allocation (www.predictcovidrisk.com). These findings may be
used to protect those at greatest risk of death from COVID-19.

Introduction

Early results of new vaccines and therapeutics aimed at fighting the COVID-19
pandemic are promising, however the supply will be constrained given worldwide demand.1,2
Initial vaccine administration will be limited to high-risk populations and broader availability will
likely be staged over time. On therapeutics, convalescent plasma and Remdesivir have already
been supply constrained, placing clinicians in the difficult position of rationing the supply based
on risk factors that have not yet been fully elucidated.3 This dilemma will be further magnified
with the market introduction of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies which have not been preproduced as a part of Operation Warp Speed.4
Advanced age is a well-known risk factor of COVID-19 death, however, prioritization for
vaccine and therapeutic medication administration would be better informed by more complete
data.1,2 Using a machine learning approach, we explored a wide range of factors associated
with COVID-19 death in a cohort of 534,023 COVID-19 patients over 65 years of age. A
prediction calculator was created to help identify the personal risk of COVID-19 mortality given
an individual’s age, demographic information, and comorbidity profile.

Methods

Data source and study population
Through a special data arrangement with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS), we accessed the Medicare data server which contains 100% Medicare fee-forservice claims in the U.S. We identified people age 65 years or older who were diagnosed with
COVID-19 from carrier, inpatient, and outpatient claims between April 1, 2020 to August 31,
2020. A diagnosis of COVID-19 was identified using the International Statistical Classification of
Disease and Related Health Problem, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code U07.1 (2019-nCoV acute

respiratory disease).5 The Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF), which includes
beneficiary enrollment information, was used to identify a patient's demographic characteristics
and geographic location.

Outcome variables
The primary outcome for this analysis was mortality among hospitalized patients who
were diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient death was identified if either of the following two criteria
were found in a patient’s inpatient claims: 1) a discharge status was listed as “expired” or 2) a
patient status indicator was listed as “died”.

Independent variables
Patients’ sex, age, race, and geographical location were identified from MBSF. Race
was classified as White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, which included Pacific Islander, and
Other/Unknown, which included American Indian/Alaska Native, other, unknown. We
categorized age groups as 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, and 85 years or older. Residential zip
codes were used to account for geographic differences.
Comorbidities of patients were captured using the CMS Chronic Conditions Data
Warehouse (CCW). The CMS CCW is a database that lists each of the 67 available comorbidity
diagnoses that have been assigned to a Medicare beneficiary between January 1, 1999 and
December 31, 2018.6

Statistical analysis
We conducted a random forest model, which is a machine learning tool to predict an
outcome by creating numerous uncorrelated decision trees to incorporate randomness as a
“forest” of trees. During this procedure, the contribution of each predictor towards the predictive
accuracy of the resulting model was evaluated; this quantity was referred to as the variable

importance. We used the variable importance as an auxiliary means to identify the clinical
factors with the highest contributions to the predictive accuracy of the model. Hence, by using a
random forest model, we were able to capture conditions and comorbidities that were not
emphasized in prior studies. Our adjusted multivariate model included comorbidities identified
from the random forest model, comorbidities with a prevalence greater than 30%, and
comorbidities that had been reported in previous studies. Geographic clustering was performed
by using a logistic multilevel random intercepts model of mortality with patients nested within
counties. Mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression with a random intercept for the county
was conducted to identify the odds ratio of death. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals
were reported for each risk factor. A personalized risk prediction nomogram was constructed
based on the coefficients from the multivariable logistic model to calculate relative risk using the
following formula: probability = exp( ∑ β

× X)

/[1+ exp( ∑ β

× X)

]. The odds ratio was statistically

significant at α=0.05 level. Statistical analysis for this study was performed in SAS enterprise
version 7.1 (SAS, Inc., Cary, NC).

Results

Characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID-19
From April 1, 2020 through August 20, 2020, 534,023 Medicare beneficiaries over the
age of 65 had a diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in at least one Medicare claim
during the study period. Of those these, 148,151 (27.7%) patients were hospitalized and 38,066
(7.1%) died in a hospital.
The highest prevalence of COVID-19 infections was among white patients (n=396,198,
74.2%), female patients (n=307,595, 57.6%), and those age 85 or older (n=138,195, 25.9%).
The median age of a COVID-19 diagnosed patient was 77 years (IQR 70-85), and the median
age of patients who died was 80 years (IQR 73-87). Each of six comorbidities was present in

the majority of COVID-19 patients: 80% (n=423,808) had hypertension, 76% (n=402,979) had
hyperlipidemia, 63% (n=335,413) had anemia, 62% (n=332,422) had a cataract, 61%
(n=325,498) had rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis, and 54% (n=286,025) had ischemic heart
disease (Table 1). Over 65% of patients that died (n=24,927) had at least one of these
comorbidities. Risk factors associated with COVID-19 death which had a low prevalence in the
Medicare population over 65 years of age included pressure ulcers and chronic ulcers
(n=85,740), tobacco use (n=69,437), Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (n=65,303),
history of acute myocardial infarction (n=29,728), Blindness and Visual Impairment (n=15,202),
lymphoma and leukemia (n=11,996), lung cancer (n=7,578), cerebral palsy (n=3,135) sickle cell
disease (n=222), For patients over the age of 65 with no comorbidities (n=54,669), the COVID19 infection fatality rate was 4.7% (n=2,591/54,669).

Variable importance from random forest
A random forest model identified an accurate classification rate of 92.9%, and risk
factors that are more likely to be a good fit in a model to predict COVID-19 mortality higher than
the norm were chronic kidney disease, prostate cancer, the patient’s race, pressure ulcers and
chronic ulcers, acute myocardial infarction, the patient’s sex, and heart failure. We included 20
comorbidities with highest variable importance in the multivariate regression.

Factors associated with in-hospital death
In an adjusted multivariate model, COVID-19 death was associated with advanced age
(85 or older vs 65-69 years, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.07, CI 1.99-2.16), male sex (aOR =
1.88, CI 1.82-1.94), and non-white race (Hispanic vs White, aOR, =1.74, CI 1.66-1.83; Asian vs
White, aOR = 1.71, CI 1.61-1.82; Black vs White, aOR = 1.61, CI 1.56-1.66; Other or unknown
vs White, aOR = 1.44, CI 1.37-1.52). Random intercept of the county showed that COVID-19
deaths were clustered by geographic location (p<0.0001). Comorbidities associated with the

highest mortality risk included sickle cell disease (aOR = 1.73, CI 1.22-2.47), chronic kidney
disease (aOR = 1.32, CI 1.29-1.36), leukemias and lymphomas (aOR =1.22; 95% CI 1.14-1.30),
and heart failure (aOR, 1.19, CI 1.16-1.22), followed by diabetes (aOR = 1.18, CI 1.15-1.22) and
cerebral palsy (aOR = 1.18, CI 1.04-1.35) (Table 2).

Construction of a Risk Calculator
We used the coefficients of patients’ age, sex, race, and all reported risk factors to
create a personalized COVID-19 mortality risk prediction calculator. Based on this calculator, an
80-year-old Hispanic man with chronic kidney disease has a mortality risk 6 times higher than a
66-year-old white woman with no comorbidities. The risk calculator is available at
www.predictcovidrisk.com.

Discussion

Our study is the largest comorbidity analysis of COVID-19 patients in the U.S to date.
Using a large sample size, geographic clustering, and the encompassing pool of independent
variables captured in this study, we identified that the comorbidities of sickle cell disease,
chronic kidney disease, leukemias and lymphomas, heart failure, and diabetes are all
associated with higher rates of COVID-19 death. These results revealed high risk individuals
who should be considered for prioritization of vaccine and therapeutic medication allocation.
These findings were also used to develop a risk calculator to allow clinicians to identify patients
who were at a highest risk of COVID-19 mortality.
Our results expanded on findings reported in prior studies describing COVID-19 mortality
risk factors.7,8,9 A large UK-based cohort study of 10,926 COVID-19 deaths found that increased
age, male sex, and Black race were associated with a higher risk of mortality.10 Our results
showed that with every five-year increase over age 65 years, there was an approximately 20%

increase in mortality. As consistent with prior reports, we also found racial and ethnic minority
groups had a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality compared with White patients. A study in New
York of 4,312 COVID-19 patients observed that a Black patients had the highest relative risk
compared to other race groups.11 Other analyses have found Black patients to have the greater
risk of COVID-19 death, however we found that Hispanic patients had the highest mortality risk
and that black patients were a close second in this Medicare population.11-13 The
disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on minorities may be related three possibilities. First, there
may be a disproportionate burden of undiagnosed comorbidities such as diabetes, HIV, liver
disease, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and kidney disease in minority communities.14
Second, minority patients may be acquiring the infection with a higher viral load given denser
settings in which minority populations live, commute and work. The size of the viral load
involved in a patient has been associated with the infection fatality rate.15,16 These populations
may also be more likely to live in multigenerational households where ventilation may be poor
and effective social distancing may not be feasible.17 Finally, minorities may have poorer access
to quality health care.11-13
Another U.K. study of 20,133 UK patients hospitalized with COVID-19 observed that
death was associated with the pre-existing comorbidities of chronic cardiac disease, chronic
non-asthmatic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, obesity and liver disease.18 Similarly,
a U.S. cohort study of 11,721 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in 38 states found the
comorbidities of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease to be associated with an
increased odds of mortality.19 A U.S.-based study of 521 patients with chronic kidney disease
who became critically ill with COVID-19 described a hazard ratio of 1.25.20 Our study strongly
reinforces the hypothesis that chronic kidney disease is major risk factor for COVID-19 death.
We observed that chronic kidney disease was the second leading risk factor among all
comorbidities with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.32, second only to sickle cell disease which is
rare in the Medicare population over age 65 years.

Using a large sample size, our study affirmed the association of hypertension, diabetes,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and lung cancer with
COVID-19 death, in line with previous large size comorbidities studies.9-11,21-26 However, different
from prior studies, our sample revealed sickle cell disease and leukemias and lymphomas to be
major risk factors for COVID-19 death. Previous case studies have reported that sickle cell
disease patients had favorable outcomes and suggested that mortality risk in this population
was inconclusive.27,28 One explanation for our finding may be that sickle cell disease is
associated with impaired oxygen exchange, which may be further impeded during the
inflammatory phase of the infection.
Obesity has been well-described to be a risk factor for COVID-19 death.10,18,19 One study
showed that COVID-19 patients with a BMI between 30-34 kg/m2 and >35 kg/m2 were 1.8 and
3.6 times more likely to require critical care, respectively, when compared to individuals with a
BMI of <30 kg/m2.29 We observed a risk lower than described in other studies. We believe the
weaker association we report to be due to the well-known low sensitivity of obesity codes in
claims data to detect obese and overweight individuals.30 Therefore, we believe the impact of
obesity, overweight, and undocumented metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes on poor COVID-19
outcomes to be under-reported in this claims based study.
Some of the risk factors we identified may be co-linear with institutionalized patients.
Specifically, cerebral palsy, chronic ulcers, blindness, Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias, and mobility impairments are likely more prevalent in persons living with assisted or
nursing care. Higher risk in these populations may be due to the mode of transmission in
residential facilities.
We reported the first COVID-19 risk factor analysis using machine learning algorithms.
Various studies have established the random forest approach as a useful method for modelling
risk prediction.31-33 We incorporated a random forest approach into the COVID-19 risk factor

exploration to identify variables that could be used to predict a better model. Our results
revealed that 60% of comorbidities (n=12) captured from random forest model were also in the
list of top 20 comorbidities had the highest odds ratio of COVID-19 death. Overall, random
forest as a machine learning approach had a preponderance on selecting important variables
that could improve the model fitness.34
This study had some important limitations. First, we were unable to make conclusions
about the infection fatality rate in the community because claims data are specific but not
sensitive for infection with COVID-19. Second, we only included inpatient hospital deaths since
there is a time lag in the availability of death data outside the hospital setting in the Medicare
dataset.

Conclusion

As COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics become available, the risk factors we report
could inform the allocation of these limited resources until they become more widely available.
The application of these results to the personalized risk calculator may help educate clinicians
and the public on which patients aged 65 years or older are at highest risk of COVID-19
mortality.
