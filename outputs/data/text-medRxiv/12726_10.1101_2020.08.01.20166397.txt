Abstract

45

In the context of an unprecedented shortage of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) or sample

46

transport media during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, alternative methods

47

for sample collection are needed. To address this need, we validated a cell culture medium as a

48

viral transport medium, and compared the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-

49

PCR in nasal wash (NW), oropharyngeal swab (OPS) and NPS specimens. Both the clinical

50

and analytical sensitivity were comparable in these three sample types. OPS and NW specimens

51

may therefore represent suitable alternatives to NPS for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

Introduction

70

In the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute

71

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a broad testing strategy is crucial to

72

identify infected persons, including less typical clinical presentations of the disease [1].

73

However, during this pandemic, broad screening is sometimes hampered by equipment and

74

reagent shortages occurring worldwide [2]. Affected items include sampling devices, as well

75

as molecular testing reagents and viral transport medium.

76

The Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified in a variety of specimens, including

77

oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, nasal, sputum and bronchial fluid specimens [3, 5]. The

78

detection of the sarbecovirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, by real-time reverse-

79

transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) using a nasopharyngeal specimen is by now the most

80

commonly accepted method and is recommended by the American CDC and others

81

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html]. SARS-CoV-2 can also

82

be found in oropharyngeal, sputum or even saliva specimens [6-10]. The WHO recommends

83

collecting nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) or nasal wash (NW)

84

specimens from ambulatory patients with COVID-19 disease

85

[https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/331329?locale-attribute=fr&].

86

In this crisis setting our institution, like many others, risked facing an unprecedented shortage

87

of equipment, including NPS. We therefore tested several procedures in order to validate

88

alternative solutions in house. OPS and NW are the two alternative procedures presented in

89

this article. They are compared to the gold standard, the NPS. Finally, we validated the use of

90

Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) as a transport medium for SARS-CoV-2

91

specimens.

Material and methods

95

Participants

96

Eligible participants were ≥ 18 years old and hospitalized in the internal medicine wards at the

97

Geneva University Hospitals, who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR in a NPS specimen

98

in the preceding one to six days. ICU patients were excluded.

99
100

Oropharyngeal swabs sampling

101

PCR tubes (CobasTM Roche Reference No. 07976577001-3) were filled with 3ml of DMEM.

102

Nylon flocked NPS (COPAN Reference No.A305CS01) and cotton OPS (VWR Reference

103

No. 300260) were used for sampling. Consecutive OP and then NP samples from 29 patients

104

were obtained in parallel and inserted into DMEM Cobas tubes. The OPS was always

105

performed first. OPS specimens were obtained by swabbing the oropharyngeal posterior wall

106

and turning once in each direction. They were then transferred into the Cobas PCR tube. NPS

107

were performed according to the usual technique [4, 11]. Specimens were stored at 4°C after

108

being collected.

109
110

Nasal wash sampling

111

PCR tubes (CobasTM Roche Reference No. 07976577001-3) were filled with 1 ml of DMEM

112

and 2ml of NaCl 0,9% was added in half of them. Consecutive NW and NPS specimens from

113

20 volunteers were obtained. NW was always performed first, and as follows: 3 ml of sterile

114

saline solution was injected into the nostril using a 3 ml syringe and recovered into a plastic

115

cup by leaning patients’ heads forward. Using the same syringe, a total 2 ml volume of the

116

NW was transferred into a Cobas PCR tube containing 1 ml of DMEM media. NPS were

117

performed according to the usual technique [4, 11]. They were then transferred into a Cobas

SARS-CoV-2 RNA extraction and rRT-PCR

125

Viral RNA genome detection was performed by real-time RT-PCR using the Roche Cobas

126

6800 system (Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Ref 09175431190; Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Control kit Ref

127

09175440190; Cobas 6800/8800 Buffer Negative Control kit Ref 07002238190). This

128

technology allows nucleic acid extraction, purification, PCR amplification and detection of

129

SARS-CoV-2, targeting ORF1a/b and a pan-Sarbecovirus conserved region of the E protein

130

gene.

131
132

Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium validation

133

We assessed the suitability of the Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) for use in

134

testing specimens by comparing it to the Universal Transport Medium (UTM). Ten positive

135

NPS specimens were simultaneously spiked in 3ml DMEM and 3ml UTM and then analyzed

136

by rRT-PCR using the Roche Cobas 6800 system.

137
138

Statistical analyses

139

The correlation between the Ct values for ORF1 (arbitrary chosen for comparison) in NPS

140

and in OPS or in NW specimens was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r).

141

The negative specimen by NW was arbitrarily assigned a Ct value of 45 and the two negative

142

specimens by both OPS and NPS were excluded from the analysis. Correlation was also

Results

147

Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium validation

148

The resulting cycle threshold (Ct) values were very similar when comparing the DMEM to

149

the UTM. The delta Ct values ranged from 0.01 to 2.59 with a mean delta Ct value of 0.53 for

150

ORF-1 and 0.67 for E-gene (supplementary data, table 1).

151
152

Sampling methods comparison

153

We compared the techniques in two groups of volunteers: the first group comprised 20 cases

154

where a NW specimen was collected followed by a NPS specimen. The second group

155

comprised 29 cases where an OPS specimen was collected followed by a NPS specimen. The

156

clinical sensitivities of NW and OPS specimens were compared to those of the NPS

157

specimens using the Ct values obtained by SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR (supplementary data,

158

table 2). Out of 20 cases, one patient that was positive with the NPS sampling with Ct values

159

of 33.46 for ORF1 and 35.12 for the E-protein gene had negative results with the NW

160

sampling. When comparing the NW sampling to NPS sampling, the mean delta Ct values

161

were 1.77 (range -6.82 to 7.06) and 1.73 (range -7.79 to 8.25) for ORF1 and E-protein gene

162

respectively (supplementary data, table 2). The Pearson r was 0.75 (p<0.01), showing a

163

statistically significant correlation between the ORF1 Ct values for the NPS and the NW

164

specimens (figure 1).

165

Out of 29 patients, two cases were negatives in both the OPS and the NPS specimens. When

166

comparing OPS to NPS sampling, the mean delta Ct values were 1.24 (range -4.24 to 5.8) and

167

1.32 (range -4.63 to 7.6) for ORF1 and E-protein gene respectively (supplementary data,

169

between the ORF1 Ct values for the NPS and the OPS specimens (figure 2).

171

Discussion

172

Several studies have compared different types of upper respiratory tract specimens, and

173

various collection methods have been compared to the gold standard method, the NPS [4, 11-

174

13]. NW have also displayed promising upper respiratory virus detection rates [12, 14].

175

Regarding the NW samples, based on our results the clinical sensitivity seemed comparable to

176

that of NPS specimens. A single NW sample was rRT-PCR negative, whereas the NPS one

177

collected consecutively from the same patient was positive. However the high Ct values of

178

these samples suggest that the viral RNA present in both specimens from this volunteer was

179

close to the limit of detection, and we cannot affirm that the clinical sensitivity of NW is

180

below that of NPS specimens for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection based on this single

181

observation. On the quantitative level, the mean delta Ct values seemed acceptable and the

182

correlation between NW and NPS was reinforced by the statistical analyses.

183

Our results also indicate a comparable clinical sensitivity between OPS and NPS at the

184

qualitative level, since all patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR results from NPS

185

specimens, even those with high Ct values, also tested positive by OPS. Regarding the

186

analytical sensitivity at the quantitative level, we obtained a significant correlation between

187

OPS and NPS specimens.

188

Concerning the transport medium, our results suggest that the DMEM seems to be suitable for

189

SARS-CoV-2 detection.

190

On the practical side, OPS and NW appeared to be better tolerated by patients, although this

191

needs to be confirmed by using appropriate patient scoring. Another practical advantage of

192

OPS over NPS in an equipment shortage setting is that adequate rigid swabs are much more

193

readily available than those used for NPS. Nasal washes present a valuable advantage as they

194

can be performed without the need of specific swabs and with a minimal use of tools that are

195

unlikely to be in shortage anyway. Moreover, both procedures seemed to cause less coughing

196

than the NPS procedure, which represents a major advantage when considering the exposure

197

of healthcare workers to SARS-CoV-2.

198

Limitations to our study include the relatively small sample size, and further evaluation would

199

be needed to reach a definitive conclusion. The statistical analyses were also underpowered

200

and should be interpreted with caution.

201

In conclusion, OPS and NW seem to be reliable alternative upper respiratory tract sampling

202

methods for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2, and DMEM can be used as an

203

alternative to commercial UTM, particularly in crisis settings. Further studies with a higher

204

number of samples would still be needed to firmly conclude to an equivalence between these

205

sampling methods. Nevertheless, the increased testing versatility offered by these substitutes

206

should be greatly welcomed in the COVID-19 global crisis setting.

Supplementary table 1. Comparison of DMEM and UTM media.
The delta Ct value for target ORF 1 between the two transport media containing the same specimen
ranged between 0.01 and 2.59. One specimen turned out negative in both media. Two specimens were
very close to the detection limit and yielded undetectable results for one or more targets (patient a:
ND/ND and 36.43/ND, patient e: ND/37.81 and 36.3/37.82). ND: not detected. NA: not applicable.

Table 2. Sampling methods comparison.
a. Ct values of NP swab specimens compared to Ct values of NW specimens by RT-PCR in 20
patients. The mean delta Ct value shows a slightly better overall sensitivity with NP swabs (average
1.7). Patient 15’s NW sample was negative despite a positive NP specimen.
b. Ct values of NP swab specimens compared to Ct Values of OP swab specimens in RT-PCR in 29
patients. Patients 1 and 28 were negative both in NP and OP swabs. The mean delta Ct value shows a
slightly overall better sensitivity with NP swabs (average 1.2-1.3). The specimen collection was done
at the same time.
