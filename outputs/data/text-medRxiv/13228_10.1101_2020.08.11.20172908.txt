ABSTRACT
When we consider a probability distribution about how many COVID-19 infected people will
transmit the disease, two points become important. First, there should be super-spreaders in
these distributions/networks and secondly, the Pareto principle should be valid in these
distributions/networks. When we accept that these two points are valid, the distribution of
transmission becomes a discrete Pareto distribution, which is a kind of power law. Having
such a transmission distribution, then we can simulate COVID-19 networks and find superspreaders using the centricity measurements in these networks. In this research, in the first
we transformed a transmission distribution of statistics and epidemiology into a transmission
network of network science and secondly we try to determine who the super-spreaders are
by using this network and eigenvalue centrality measure. We underline that determination of
transmission probability distribution is a very important point in the analysis of the epidemic
and determining the precautions to be taken.

INTRODUCTION
The first half of 2020 passed with the whole world dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak. First,
many countries implemented lockdown, and then reopening came to the agenda. However,
at the time of writing this article, there was an important increase in the number of infections
all over the world and we would probably spend the second half of the year dealing with the
COVID-19 issue and lockdowns again. The fact that COVID-19 is a relatively new virus also
challenges scientists and scientific analysis have to navigate the uncharted territories [1].
This article attempts to establish a link between the fields of statistics, network science and
epidemiology using an interdisciplinary approach. From a micro point of view, this
connection, which was tried to be established, was made by converting transmission
distribution of statistics and epidemiology into a transmission network of network science.
From a micro point of view, the study also tries to contribute to efforts to stop the epidemic by
identifying who the super spreaders are, and then by researching and identifying their
various characteristics.
In analyzing COVID-19 outbreak, most of the times, instead of focusing on a transmission
probability distribution; R0 value as an average or median have been used and superspreaders are not taking into account. But the extreme values make a long tail for this
distribution and rare infection events determine the shape of this distribution.
It has been seen that different R0 numbers were obtained in the literature for COVID-19 and
some authors try to emphasize that 80% of cases are infected by a group of 20%. But most
of the times, the fact that 80% of the infection is carried out by a 20% group is often not
considered and most of the analysis begin with a R 0 reproduction number.
Nearly all of the COVID-19 studies begin with the determination of reproduction number R 0.
For example, if a disease has an R0 of 15, a person who has the disease will transmit it to an
average of 15 other people. This coefficient is important because also we use this number to
see the severity of outbreak and this number is also used as an epidemic threshold
parameter.

Different methods are being used to determine this number. First of all, this number can be
calculated as:
R0=Contact rate*Probability of infection*Infection period
Secondly, this coefficient can be calculated using “attack rate” and attack rate is the
percentage of the population eventually infected.
Thirdly we can estimate R0 using formula:
Ro =

Life expectancy
Average age

And fourthly we can estimate Ro using exponential growth rate.
“Since the R0 has a key role in measuring the transmission of diseases and is crucial in
preventing epidemics, thus it is important to know which methods and formulas to apply to
estimate R0 and have better performance” [2]. But we know that different methods give
different results [3] and most of the times in scientific articles which method has been used is
not mentioned. Besides, sometimes R0 value is given as a median; for example, it is
expressed as, “We estimated that the median of estimated R0 is 5.7 (95% CI of 3.8–8.9)” [4]
and this may lead us to some confusion too.
“The emerging picture for epidemic spreading in complex networks emphasizes the role of
topology in epidemic modeling” [5]. Disease transmission networks have the motifs of
transmission stories. One of the most important ways to avoid contamination is to have
information about how this transmission happens.
The main purpose of this study is to develop a simple method that will make it easier for us to
look at the COVID-19 issue from the network science window. And focusing on the interplay
between network theory, statistics and epidemiology [6] In this simple method, first we
determine a transmission probability distribution and secondly simulating this probability
distribution we can draw a transmission graph and try to understand the process
contamination using this graph. We should underline that determination of transmission
probability distribution is a very important point in the analysis of the epidemic and

determining the precautions to be taken. Having such a graph, also we may compute many
network measures and use this measures in our decision process.
Our study, which started with an introduction, includes a literature review on the R0 values
calculated for COVID-19. The following section examines the phenomenon of superspreaders. Then, the issues of generating the values obtained by simulating a discrete
Pareto distribution and drawing and interpreting the transmission network are included. The
study is completed with a discussion section.
R0 values calculated for COVID-19
COVID-19 transmission is strongly heterogeneous [7]. A high degree of individual-level
variation in the transmission of COVID-19 has been expressed and consensus range of R0
was found within the interval of 2-3 [8]. Results show that there was probably substantial
variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission over time after control measures were introduced. In
the beginning of outbreak in Wuhan R0 median daily reproduction number changes from 2.35
to 1.05 in only one week. But even in the before the travel restrictions period it was found
that, median daily R0 changes between 1.6 and 2.6 in Wuhan [9]. In the early days of
outbreak in Wuhan another study estimates R at 0.24 (95% CrI: 0.01–1.38) for market-tohuman transmission and 2.37 (95% CrI: 2.08–2.71) for human-to-human transmission [10].
And also in another paper it was stated that, “We identified four major clusters and estimated
the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4–1.6)” [11].
“We modelled the transmission process in the Republic of Korea and Italy with a stochastic
model, and estimated the basic reproduction number R 0 as 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3–2.9) or 3.2
(95% CI: 2.9–3.5) in the Republic of Korea, under the assumption that the exponential
growth starting on 31 January or 5 February 2020, and 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3–2.9) or 3.3 (95% CI:
3.0–3.6) in Italy, under the assumption that the exponential growth starting on 5 February or
10 February 2020, respectively.” [12]. From these lines we learn that Ro is between 2.6 -3.2
for Republic of Korea and 2.6-3.3 for Italy.
Transmission was modelled as a geometric random walk process, or negative binomial
offspring distribution is used to calculate the probabilities: “Once we had estimated Rt , we

used a branching process with a negative binomial offspring distribution to calculate the
probability an introduced case would cause a large outbreak” [9]. Also, “The relative odds of
transmission among contacts of various types were estimated by use of conditional logistic
regression” [13].
Another important study, in a Bayesian framework tries to use a matrix of transmission
probabilities to estimate the transmission network and in this article transmission probabilities
have been estimated by Monte Carlo Markov Chain procedure using Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm [14].
Super-Spreaders
We want to give three examples to show how the same virus can have different results in
different environments. We should also add that there are no big differences in the dates of
the events as seen from footnotes:
“For example, the value of R on the Diamond Princess cruise ship was estimated to be
11 even though the worldwide average is 3.28. The close confines and movement of the
ship’s staff facilitated COVID-19 transmission. The virus was the same, but the
environment and behavior were different, altering R of the virus.”[15]
“Since then, epidemiologists have tracked a number of other instances of SARS-CoV-2
super-spreading. In South Korea, around 40 people who attended a single church
service were infected at the same time.”[16]
“At a choir practice of 61 people in Washington state, 32 attendees contracted confirmed
COVID-19 and 20 more came down with probable cases. In Chicago, before social
distancing was in place, one person that attended a dinner, a funeral and then a birthday
party was responsible for 15 new infections.” [16]
Looking at the outbreaks in history, it can be seen that the phenomenon of super-spreaders
is not new. “We examine the distribution of fatalities from major pandemics in history
(spanning about 2,500 years), and build a statistical picture of their tail properties. Using
tools from Extreme Value Theory (EVT), we show for that the distribution of the victims of
infectious diseases is extremely fat-tailed” [17]. Susceptible hosts within a population had not

equal chances of becoming infected. Although “it is still unclear why certain individuals infect
disproportionately large numbers of secondary contacts” [18]. If we have extreme
transmitters, then “the practice of relying on an average R 0 in dynamic disease models can
obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness”[19].
Heterogeneities in the transmission of infectious agents are known since the end of 1990’s
[20]. We can define the phenomenon of super-spreaders in the framework of network
science as follows: “The super-spreaders are the nodes in a network that can maximize their
impacts on other nodes, as in the case of information spreading or virus propagation” [21].
This definition reminds us the outlier concept of statistics, But super-spreaders are not
outliers that can be discarded from analysis, “In this framework, super-spreading events
(SSEs) are not exceptional events, but important realizations from the right-hand tail of a
distribution” [22].
Another definition starts with establishing the relationship between heterogeneity and superspreaders: “Heterogeneity in Rt between cases appears to be particularly important for SARS
because of the occurrence of “super-spread events (SSEs)”—rare events where, in a
particular setting, an individual may generate many more than the average number of
secondary cases” [23].
One of the most important features of COVID-19 in contamination in society is the Pareto
principle created by super-spreaders. Super-spreaders transmit the disease to a large
number of people in an outlier-like manner, resulting in few people transmitting the disease to
a large number of people, and as a result we have a transmission distribution as a power-law
distribution.
Researchers are beginning to come to a consensus that coronavirus transmission more or
less follows the 80/20 Pareto Principle [24] and estimated that 20% of cases were
responsible for 80% of local transmission [25]. When we examine the researches, we can
see that some results have slightly different results than the Pareto Principle such as,
“indicated high levels of transmission heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 spread, with between 110% of infected individuals resulting in 80% of secondary infections” [26] and “Model

suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID19…suggesting that 80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small
fraction of infectious individuals (~10%)” [8]
METHODS
In the outbreak, the number of patients’ variable, in other words, the number of transmissions
changes only at the discrete points of time. This means that the number of transmissions in
outbreaks is discrete variables. The number of COVID 19 patients varies in many situations;
how many new people are infected with the disease, how many patients have recovered and
how many of them are likely to be infected or infectious again. If we were able to predict the
transmission processes, there would be a deterministic approach in creating a transmission
network however its impossibility is clear. Therefore, this is a stochastic process, as the
number of transmission and from whom it is transmitted cannot be fully estimated or
determined. Probability distributions are used in stochastic simulation models. In the
simulation model, the number of transmissions, which is an discrete event, varies in the
number of patients depending on time [ between 't' time point and 't + 1' time point (s 't' and 't
+ 1 may be, 7 days or 14 days period)] which is a change or increase is a discrete value and
this change or increase is a discrete value. However, since there is no definite vaccination or
herd immunity, person-to-person transmission remains a dynamic process.
In simulation models, the distribution is determined by collecting information and data about
the subject studied. In the light of these data, the model is established by determining the
probability distributions of probabilistic (stochastic) processes. In this study, as a result of
literature search, the principle that COVID-19 transmission is related to Pareto distribution
and power-law has been adopted and we decided the distribution to be produced in the
drawing of the random transmission network, as the discrete Pareto distribution. By
simulating the Pareto distribution, disease transmission data from one patient to others was
randomly derived. The network drawn with the derived data is created according to the
Power-low distribution. Power-low is independent of scale. The concept of independence
from the scale indicates that the ratio and probability in small numbers such as 10, 40 are

equal to the ratio and probability in large numbers such as 1000, 40000. In such networks,
few nodes have many connections, and many nodes have few connections the “rich get
richer” rule (preferential attachment,) remains valid in connection [27]. The same similar logic
has been applied in the determination of super-spreaders in drawing the COVID-19 network.
Thus, the study is based on the principles that some people infect more people(superspreaders) and some infect less or not (isolate).
RESULTS
Simulating Discrete Pareto Distribution (Zipf Distribution)
Zipf, Pareto and power law “terms are used to describe phenomena where large events are
rare, but small ones quite common. For example, there are few large earthquakes but many
small ones. There are a few mega-cities, but many small towns. There are few words, such
as 'and' and 'the' that occur very frequently, but many which occur rarely” [28]. Economists
know that Wilfried Fritz Pareto observed that 20% of Italians held 80% of the country’s wealth
in the 19th century. Pareto principle also known as the 80/20 rule.
If we give an example of one of the studies on the transmission distribution as power-law,
“The empirical data are highly consistent with the hypothesis that the number of reported
cases are taken from a truncated power-law distribution of the form P(n) ∼ n−µ, 1 ≤ n ≤ nmax “
[29]
Using the code in an R source [30], we can simulate a discrete Pareto distribution and draw
its histogram as in Figure 1.

Drawing COVID-19 Transmission Graphs
Contact networks and disease transmission networks are different from each other.
However, although data on this subject is obtained through filiation studies or contact trace
apps, it is not easy to convert these data into social network-like networks due to some
uncertainties and bureaucratic problems. In this case, how to determine a synthetic COVID19 transmission network question becomes important.
The number of incoming connections in a "contact" network does not have to be one. For
example, in Figure 2, people B and D were placed closer than 1.5 meters from C, but the
people which transmitted disease to C, was B, as seen in Figure 2. Briefly, nodes in contact
networks can have multiple incoming and outgoing connections.

Eventually, "contact" networks become "contamination" networks. All these graphs, come
from "contact" networks. The graph in the Figure 2 is a "transmission" graph, and as can be
seen, the number of incoming connections are one for all these 5 nodes. In contrast, the
number of outgoing connections can be an integer greater than one. For example, in the
Figure 3, E is infected by A and F, G and H are infected by E. Similarly, A is infected by D,
and B and E are infected by A. These can be referred to as "transmission" graphs.

It is also possible to find all the paths from any node to other nodes using these graphs. For
example, according to the line above, there is a single ABC-shaped path leading to C in A.
Similarly, from A to F can also be reached via the AEF pathway, and the number of jumps in
both the ABC pathway and the AEF pathway is two.

structure of interpersonal contact” [31] . If we move from this point, we can think about
different network structures that will reduce infectiousness in epidemics, considering that we
may encounter different outbreaks in the future.
As it can be seen in Figure 4, “From a social network perspective, the shape of the infection
curve is closely related to the concept of network distance (or path lengths), which indicates
the number of network steps needed to connect two nodes” [31,32]

Figure 4. Two example networks. a–c with the same number of nodes and ties [31]
In Figure 4, two example networks. a–c, have the same number of nodes (individuals) and
ties (social interactions) but different structures (shorter path lengths in a and longer path
lengths in c), which imply different infection curves (b and d, respectively). Bold ties highlight
the shortest infection path from the infection source to the last infected individual in the
respective networks. Network node colour indicates at which step a node is infected and
maps onto the colours of the histogram bars [31]
In order to obtain such a network, first we need to have a probability distribution regarding
the number of people a person can infect the disease. When we have such a transmission
probability distribution about the probabilities that a person can transmit the disease to how
many people, we can draw a social network-like COVID-19 transmission graph by generating
random variables about how many people can transmit the disease at each stage.

underlying network is dynamic” and another centrality measure named expected force has
been offered for additional advantages over existing spreading power and centrality
measures [34]. But in our study we will use eigenvalue centrality measure to determine which
nodes are super-spreaders. And as a result we have found that Node 3 is a super-spreader,
as seen in figure 5.

DISCUSSION
This study, which is conducted within the framework of interdisciplinary approach, focuses
mainly on two purposes. In the first of these purposes transforming a transmission
distribution of statistics and epidemiology into a transmission network of network science is
aimed; In the second one, we try to determine who the super-spreaders are by using this
network.
It is not appropriate to express the transmission distribution of this disease with an average
R0 because this distribution is a power law descending from left to right. But at the beginning
of the COVID-19 outbreak, this mistake has been made in the analysis. Besides, we know
that different methods for R0 give different results and most of the times in scientific articles
which method has been used is not mentioned.
And the second mistake is not to consider the importance of super-spreaders in this
distribution. Looking at the outbreaks in history, it can be seen that the phenomenon of
super-spreaders is not new and spanning about 2,500 years and the distribution of the
victims of infectious diseases is extremely fat-tailed. Most of the times, the fact that 80% of

the infection is carried out by a 20% group is often not considered and most of the analysis
begin with a R0 reproduction number. In fact, we should add that there is a connection
between these two errors and that this is a single error. The super-spreaders are the nodes
in a network that can maximize their impacts on other nodes, in the case of virus
transmission n. Although it is still unclear why certain individuals infect disproportionately
large numbers of secondary contacts, the fact that 80% of the infection is carried out by a
20% group is important. But maybe it is necessary to add that some research tells us that
80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious
individuals (~10%).
COVID-19 transmission is strongly heterogeneous, while a high degree of individual-level
variation in the transmission of COVID-19 has been expressed and consensus range of R0
was found within the interval of 2-3. On the other hand, in Wuhan, R0 median daily
reproduction number changes from 2.35 to 1.05 in only one week. From the results of
another research we learn that R0 is between 2.6 -3.2 for Republic of Korea and 2.6-3.3 for
Italy and also these results falsify the above mentioned so called consensus.
We have to underline that point, determination of transmission probability distribution is a
very important point in the analysis of the epidemic and determining the precautions to be
taken. We know that in such a case network structure is inferred from indirect, incomplete,
and often biased observations. As the main difficulty in establishing such a link is the lack of
data and information due to the very recent COVID-19 that’s why required data are
generated by simulation. After transforming a transmission distribution into a transmission
network and having such a graph, also we may compute many network measures and use
this measures in our decision process.
Disease transmission networks have the motifs of transmission stories. One of the most
important ways to avoid contamination is to have information about how this transmission
happens. From a social network perspective, the shape of the infection curve is closely
related to the concept of network distance (or path lengths), which indicates the number of
network steps needed to connect two nodes.

Contact networks and disease transmission networks are different from each other. Incoming
and outcoming edges can be any number in a contact network but in a transmission network
the number of incoming edge always must be one and outcoming edge can be any number
like contact networks.
In our study, we have used eigenvalue centrality measure to determine which nodes are
super-spreaders. In fact, the issue does not end at this point and is just beginning, because
only if the biological, social and genetic features of the determined super-spreaders can be
determined, only then can these people be prevented from accelerating the outbreak.
