Abstract:Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic, and the infection due to SARSCoV-2 has now spread to more than 200 countries 3. Surveillance systems form the foundation stone of active
case finding, testing and contact tracing, which are the key components of the public health response to this novel,
emerging infectious disease 4. There is uncertainty about the true proportion of patients who remain asymptomatic
or pre-symptomatic at a given time. As per the WHO-China Joint Monitoring Mission Report, and an analysis of
21 published reports, anywhere between 5 and 80 per cent of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have been noted to
be asymptomatic 5, 6 Whereas in India 4197563 cases are positive, in which in West Bengal total 180788 cases
(4.04% of Cases of India) positive of COVID 19. In Paschim Medinipur (West Medinipur) district contributing
total 5489 cases (3.03% cases of West Bengal) 9 , 10,11. In this scenario, we want to know the status of IgG
seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic general population, so that we can determine the extent of
infection of SARS-CoV-2 in general population.
Objectives:- Primary Objective:- To estimate the seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general
asymptomatic population at Paschim Medinipur District. Secondary Objectives- To estimate age and sex specific
seroprevalence. To determine the socio demographic risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection; To determine the
other risk factors like comorbidities, vaccination status, travel history, contact history etc.; To determine the
durability of Immunity (IgG) conferred by natural infection of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals previously RTPCR
positive.
Methodology: It was a cross sectional 30 cluster study among the population of Paschim Medinipur district of
West Bengal conducted in last week of July and 1st week of August 2020 among 458 asymptomatic general
population and 30 RTPCR positive cases in 30 villages or wards of municipalities. 30 clusters were chosen from
list of COVID 19 affected villages/wards of municipality as per PPS (Probability Proportional to Size) method.
Results: Of the 458 asymptomatic general population,19 asymptomatic people found to be seropositive IgG for
SARS-CoV-2 with Mean or average total seropositivity rate of 4.15%. 19 Out of 30 (63.33%) RTPCR positive
patients found Seronegative. Median of Days between RTPCR test and sero negativity found was 60 with
minimum 28 days to maximum 101 days and Range of 73 days and a standard deviation of 19.46. Among risk
factors, the risk of having IgG is more in persons having Travel history with odds ratio of 2.99- 95%CI (1.177.65) with p-value-0.02. Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis with Odds ratio of 8.49- 95% CI(1.59-45.19) with p
value - 0.003. Occupation as migrant labour with Odds ratio of 5.08- 95% CI(1.96-13.18) with p value of 0.001.
H/O Chicken pox with Odds ratio of 2.15- 95% CI(0.59-7.79) with p value of 0.017. Influenza vaccinated with
Odds ratio of 8.07 with 95% CI (0.8-81.48) with a p value of 0.036.
Conclusion: Of the 458 asymptomatic general population,19 asymptomatic people found to be seropositive IgG
for SARS-CoV-2 with Mean or average total seropositivity rate of 4.15%. 19 Out of 30 (63.33%) RTPCR positive
patients found Seronegative. Median of Days between RTPCR test and sero negativity found was 60 with
minimum 28 days to maximum 101 days and Range of 73 days and a standard deviation of 19.46. Those having
Travel History and having occupation as Migrant Labourer – have significantly higher probability of getting
infected with SARS-CoV-2. No role has been found of Hydroxychloroquine Medicines as Chemoprophylactic.
No durable immunity conferred by natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 –mean time to become seronegative after
positive RTPCR test 60 days. So there is a chance of reinfection after average 2 months.

INTRODUCTION:
Serosurveys are studies that test body fluids, most commonly blood but also oral fluid, to estimate what
proportion of the population has been vaccinated against or previously infected with a pathogen—and
how many people remain susceptible 1. Conducting population-based serosurveillance for severe acute
respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) will estimate and monitor the trend of infection in
the adult general population, determine the socio-demographic risk factors and delineate the
geographical spread of the infection 2.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic, and the infection due to SARSCoV-2 has now spread to more than 200 countries 3. As on 6th September 2020, the Confirmed cases in
India stood at 4197563, West Bengal had 180788 confirmed cases, and Paschim Medinipur District had
5489 confirmed cases.9,10,11 Surveillance systems form the foundation stone of active case finding,
testing and contact tracing, which are the key components of the public health response to this novel,
emerging infectious disease 4. There is uncertainty about the true proportion of patients who remain
asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic at a given time. As per the WHO-China Joint Monitoring Mission
Report, and an analysis of 21 published reports, anywhere between 5 and 80 per cent of SARS-CoV-2infected patients have been noted to be asymptomatic 5, 6
The WHO global research map for COVID-19 and others recommend population-level sero
epidemiological studies to generate data on the levels of infection in populations and recommend
containment measures accordingly7. In order to achieve this, a protocol for conducting such populationbased sero-epidemiological investigation for COVID-19 has been proposed by the WHO 8.
Serosurveys involve collection of specimens to measure the presence and level of antigen-specific
antibodies in a group of people. It reveals what proportion of the population has been exposed to an
infectious disease or has been vaccinated against a pathogen. It also estimates the level of population
immunity to one or more infectious diseases; Sero Survey identifies gaps in immunity because people
were not vaccinated or previously infected. Immunity gaps can be in specific age groups, certain
locations, or among specific populations such as migrants. Identifying immunity gaps can guide
immunization programs. It estimates parameters for modelling and transmission dynamics to measure
disease burden and guide immunization programs 12. Serologic studies are crucial for clarifying
dynamics of the coronavirus disease pandemic. Past work on serological studies (e.g., during influenza
pandemics) has made relevant contributions. Although detection of antibodies to measure exposure,
immunity, or both seems straightforward conceptually, numerous challenges exist in terms of sample
collection, what the presence of antibodies means, and appropriate analysis and interpretation to account
for test accuracy and sampling biases. Successful deployment of serologic studies depends on type and
performance of serologic tests, population studies, use of adequate study designs, and appropriate
analysis and interpretation of data. We highlight key questions that serologic studies can help answer
at different times, review strengths and limitations of different assay types and study designs, and
discuss methods for rapid sharing and analysis of serologic data to determine the extent of transmission
of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 serologic studies has largely focused on 2 questions: first, what
proportion of a population has been infected; and second, what proportion of a population is immune
to disease or infection? Firstly, for infections that elicit detectable antibody responses, serologic studies
can detect past infection regardless of clinical symptoms. This capability is useful for understanding the
extent of past transmission13. Secondly, if measured antibody responses correlate with protection,
serologic studies can be used to measure the proportion of the population those who are immune. This
information can be used to guide control policies, help identify populations that are still susceptible to
epidemics, target treatment or vaccination trials, and target vaccination when available. Although much
discussion around use of serologic testing to inform persons of their serologic status has occurred,
crucial distinctions exist between the use of serologic information to estimate population-level versus
person-level immunity. Person-level immunity information is currently fraught with scientific, ethical,
and legal uncertainties, which we do not address in this article.

persons had Contact History with a Covid-19 Patient (n=193) [Close and Direct Contact-7.2%; Indirect
Contact- 32.8%; Healthcare Provider- 2.2%].
IgG Serosurvey Results of Pachim Medinipur District among Asymptomatic General Population
of Paschim Medinipur District (Table 2);19 asymptomatic persons found to be seropositive IgG for SARS-CoV-2 with Mean or average total
seropositivity rate of 4.15% [95% Confidence Interval- Lower-2.52% Upper-6.40%]. 439
asymptomatic general persons were found to be Seronegative(95.85%). Highest Seropositivity
percentage found in Ghatal Municipality of 12.50% followed by Daspur II of 9.78%, Daspur I of 4.00%
and Kharagpur Municipality of 3.70% and Midnapur Municipality of 6.25%.
Socio-demographic Factors associated with Increased Risk of IgG Seropostivity of COVD-19
(Table-3) were- Male Sex – with odds ratio of 2.3 (95% conf. Int.-0.75<OR<7.05); Age group 20-45
Years -with odds ratio 3.02 (95% conf. Int.-0.82<OR<11.11); Inhabitant of Slum Area- with Odds Ratio
of 2.30 (95% conf. Int.-0.64<OR<8.32); Migrant Labour as Occupation – with Odds Ratio of 5.07 (95%
conf. Int.- 1.96<OR<13.18).
Though the above factors had high odds ratio, only Migrant Labour as Occupation was found as a
statistically significant Socio-Demographic Risk Factor for Covid-19 Seropositivity (p=0.001). All
other socio-demographic factors had p>0.05. Also, IgG Seropositivity was highest among Migrant
Labour group – 12.70%.
No Comorbidities were found significantly associated with increased risk of IgG Seropositivity
(Comorbidity Profile -Table 4)
Risk factors associated statistically significantly with IgG Seropositivity of COVID-19 (p<0.05)
(Table-5)(i) Travel history with odds ratio of 2.99- 95%CI (1.17-7.65) with p-value-0.02;(ii)
Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis with Odds ratio of 8.49- 95% CI(1.59-45.19) with p value - 0.003;
(iii) Occupation as Migrant Labour with Odds ratio of 5.08- 95% CI(1.96-13.18) with p value of
0.001;(iv) H/O Chicken pox with Odds ratio of 2.15- 95% CI(0.59-7.79) with p value of 0.017;(v)
Influenza vaccinated with Odds ratio of 8.07 with 95% CI (0.8-81.48) with a p value of 0.036.
Finally, Multinomial Logistic Regression was done (Table-6):- Through Multinomial Logistic
Regression Model having the above associated risk factors from Table 8 as Independent Variable and
IgG Seropositivity as Dependent Variable as these Independent Variable had High Odds ratio and
significant p-value (p<0.05). The Regression Model had a Model Fitting Significance of 0.005 and
therefore was significant. From the Regression model, it was found that –



Occupation as Migrant Labour was significant with Significance of 0.038 and Exp.(B) of 8.007
Hydroxychloroquine Intake was significant with Significance of 0.045 and Exp.(B) of 7.290

IgG Serosurvey Results of Pachim Medinipur District among Previously RT-PCR Positive of
Paschim Medinipur District(Table 7, Table 8):Out of 30 Samples Collected, only 11 previously RT-PCR Positive Individuals were found IgG
Seropositive for COVID-19 (36.67%). 19 Persons were found Seronegative (63.33%)[Table 7]. The
Mean and Median no. of Days Between RTPCR test and IgG Test in IgG Negative Persons were 60.32
and 60 respectively with a minimum of 28 days and Maximum of 101 Days. (Table 8). Whereas, in the
case of IgG Positive Individuals, the Mean and Median No. of Days between RTPCR and IgG ELISA
Test were 48.09 and 49 respectively with a minimum of 31 days and Maximum of 67 days (Table 8).
DISCUSSION:The findings of the IgG Serosurvey conducted during last week of July to first week of August indicated
that 4.15 percent of the asymptomatic General Population of Paschim Medinipur District, West Bengal,
India were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The seroprevalence ranged from 12.50% in Ghatal

Municipality to 0.00 % in Garhbeta-I, Dantan-I, Dantan-II, Chandrakona-I, Chandrakona Municipality,
Ghatal Block, Pingla and Keshpur blocks of the district.
As per the Nationwide Serosurvey conducted by ICMR in May-June 202033, the nationwide
seroprevalence was 0.73 percent. Though our seroprevalence was higher than the national average, it
was much lower than the 22.86% seroprevalence in Delhi. Since the seroprevalence in our district is
still low, it indicates that a majority of the population of our district was still susceptible to COVID-19
infection. It also correlates with the study done in England in which they have found around 4.2% sero
positivity in the month of May 2020 15. A dashboard of sero-epidemiological data available from 22
countries estimated the pooled seroprevalence to be 4.76 per cent, ranging from 0.65 percent in Scotland
to 26.6 per cent in Iran36. Other studies also correlate the same prevalence in the young population in
different countries 20,21,22,23,24,25 In this study in 20 to 45 yr age group we have found that 3.79% IgG
positivity which is around same percentage which in the seroprevalence study of Switzerland 14 found
in week 1 around first week of April 2020 found (around 3.5%). Seropositivity was higher among Males
(5.23%). This is also seen in the ICMR Serosurvey33, and other studies around the globe.20,21,22,23,24,25.
In India, Migrant Labours have been regarded as a high risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is
also reflected by the fact that being a Migrant Labour was significantly associated with IgG
Seropositivity with Odds Ratio of 5.07 (95% conf. Interval- 1.96<OR<13.18) with p-value of 0.00
(Significant since p<0.05).
Another significant finding of our study was the strong association of Hydroxychloroquine Intake with
COVID-19 Seropositivity. This shows the ineffectiveness of Hydroxychloroquine in preventing
COVID-19 infection. Not only that, high odds ratio with significant p-value also indicates that those
who had taken Hydroxychloroquine had very high risk of COVID-19 infection. This requires further
research. Though, trials of Hydroxychloroquine as a post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 in USA 34
and UK35 have already found it ineffective.
Other risk factors that were significantly associated with seropositivity were- Travel History, History of
Chicken Pox and History of Influenza Vaccination. Though having travel history increases risk of
exposure to a COVID-19 positive patient, other factors require further research to establish definitive
association between these factors and COVID-19 seropositivity.
We have not found any correlation between Diabetes or persons who were taking medication for
diabetes and IgG positivity in this study. Also, no correlation was found between Hypertension and IgG
Positivity. This differs from a South Korean study(Song SK et. al.)31, which found Diabetes as a risk
factor for IgG Seropositivity.
In our study, we found that only 36.67 percent of individuals who previously were RT PCR positive for
COVD-19, had IgG antibodies. This is in correlation with the Delhi Serosurvey37, which found that
only 53.37% of individuals who previously were RT PCR positive for COVD-19, had IgG antibodies.
In the study of Japan –“Of the139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8 %, 48.0 %,
and 95.8 % of the specimens collected within 1 week, 1–2 weeks, and >2 weeks after symptom onset
and IgG was detected in 3.3 %, 8.0 %, and 62.5 %, respectively” 32. This study also correlates with our
study. This indicates that previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 does not provide long-term humoral
immunity as determined by IgG Seropositivity. There is thus, a chance of reinfection after recovering
from COVID-19.
CONCLUSION:Cross-sectional 30 cluster study was conducted in the district of Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal ,
India during last week of July and 1st week of August 2020 as a joint venture of VRDL lab MMCH and
Health and Family Welfare Department, Paschim Medinipur, Government of West Bengal, India.
Seropositivity (IgG) rate among asymptomatic general population overall in Paschim Medinipur district
is 4.15% (95% CI-2.52%-6.40%) with highest in Ghatal Municipality 12.5% and Daspur II block of
9.78%. Those having Travel History, and having occupation as Migrant Labourer – have significantly
higher probability of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2. In patients who had taken Hydroxy
Chloroquine as a chemoprophylactic, the probability of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 was
significantly higher. No role has been found for Hydroxychloroquine as Chemoprophylactic. No
durable immunity conferred by natural infection with SARS COV2 –mean time to become seronegative
