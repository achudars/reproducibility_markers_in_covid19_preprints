Abstract

25

We conducted a prospective single-arm open-label phase II clinical trial assessing the

26

safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Convalescent

27

plasma with sufficient IgG titer (1:320) obtained from recovered donors was administered to

28

adult patients with either severe or critical COVID-19 illness. Primary outcomes were adverse

29

events in association with plasma administration, and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes

30

included disease progression, recovery, length of stay, and hospital discharge. Of the 38 patients

31

included in the analysis, 24 (63%) recovered and were discharged, and 14 (37%) died. Patients

32

who received convalescent plasma early in the disease course (severe illness group) as compared

33

to the patients that received convalescent plasma later in disease progression (critical illness

34

group) had significantly lower hospital mortality 13% vs 55% (p<0.02) and shorter mean

35

hospital length of stay 15.4 vs 33 days (p<0.01). One patient experienced a transient transfusion

36

reaction. No other adverse effects of convalescent plasma infusion were observed. Our results

37

suggest that convalescent plasma is safe and has the potential for positive impact on clinical

38

outcomes including recovery and survival if given to patients early in the course of COVID-19

39

disease.

47

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory syndrome caused by severe

48

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of July 24, 2020, this novel virus

49

was discovery in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, confirmed cases have

50

risen to more than 14,000,000 worldwide and more than 600,000 people have died (1).

51

Currently, no cure or standard treatment for COVID-19 exists.

52

The majority of people with COVID-19 experience an asymptomatic, mild, or

53

manageable course of disease (2, 3). The most common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue,

54

dyspnea, headache, diarrhea, fatigue, myalgia, and/or loss of taste and smell (4, 5). However,

55

19% of those who are infected with the virus become severely or critically ill (2). Life

56

threatening illness occurs when the virus triggers a progressive hyper-immune response or

57

“cytokine storm” progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiac injury,

58

thrombotic complications, septic shock and/or organ failure (6-9). Estimated mortality among

59

patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe or critical illness ranges from

60

34.8% to 41.6% (10, 11). Risk of death and disease severity increase with older age, obesity and

61

chronic disease such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease (7-9, 12-14).

62

In March of 2020, The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) solicited investigational

63

new drug applications to test the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy for patients

64

with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 (15). Convalescent plasma is derived from the blood

65

of recovered patients and is a rich source of antibodies. When administered to patients who are

66

ill with the same disease, the plasma may aid recovery by conferring passive immunity and

67

neutralizing the pathogen (15). The therapy showed promise during outbreaks of other novel

68

viral respiratory syndromes, including two caused specifically by coronavirus (SARS-CoV in

69

2003 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012) (16, 17). Data showed that

70

convalescent plasma might be most effective when given earlier in the course of disease, but

71

research was limited to small observational studies and much remains unknown (16, 17).

72

Preliminary data from clinical trials and observational studies targeting COVID-19

73

suggest that administration of convalescent plasma may reduce mortality, hospital length of stay,

74

and time on mechanical ventilation with minimal adverse side-effects in patients with severe or

75

life-threatening disease (18-23). Consistent with earlier studies, treatment may be most

76

efficacious for severe COVID-19 when administered closer to symptom onset (21-25). The

77

purpose of this study is to describe the course of illness among 38 patients hospitalized with

78

severe or life-threatening COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma as part of an FDA-

79

approved Phase 2 clinical trial. Specifically, the study will assess their hospital course in the

80

context of demographics, disease onset, symptomology, illness severity, and disease progression.

81

Material and Methods

82

This study is an FDA-approved prospective single-arm open-label Phase II clinical trial

83

(NCT04343261) assessing the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma (IND #19805) on the

84

clinical course of adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19.

Patients

88

Subjects were recruited from four regional hospitals in Connecticut and Massachusetts

89

between period of April 20, 2020 and June 8, 2020. Patients were considered eligible for the

90

study if they were between the ages of 18 and 90, hospitalized, severely or critically ill with

91

confirmed COVID-19 through nasopharyngeal swab real time PCR (RT-PCR). Illness severity

92

was defined as follows: Mild COVID-19 was defined as symptoms with no clinical signs of

93

moderate, severe, or critical disease; moderate illness was defined as respiratory rate ≥ 20 breaths

94

per minute and oxygen saturation > 93%; severe illness was defined as any of the following:

95

respiratory frequency ≥ 30/minute, blood oxygen saturation ≤ 93%, partial pressure of arterial

96

oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio < 300, and lung infiltrates > 50% within 24 to 48

97

hours; evidence of critical illness included respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ

98

dysfunction or failure (15, 26).

99

Subjects who met eligibility criteria were referred by their treating physicians. Patients

100

were enrolled regardless of previous treatment or therapies for COVID-19, including

101

experimental medications and therapies administered off-label. Informed consent was provided

102

by either the patient or the patient’s legally authorized representative (LAR). Once a patient or

103

the patient’s LAR provided informed consent and the patient’s ABO blood type was determined,

104

compatible convalescent plasma was administered in 2 consecutive 200 mL infusions. Each unit

105

was transfused for the duration of 1 hour, 1 to 2 hours apart. If the patient received plasma with

106

undetectable antibodies, the patient was re-dosed with a unit of plasma with adequate antibody

107

titer (1:320). Recipients were monitored and all adverse reactions or events were recorded

108

whether or not they were related to the plasma infusion. The protocol was approved by the

109

Trinity Health Of New England Institutional Review Board (#SFH-20-23).

110

Convalescent Plasma

111

Convalescent plasma was obtained from adult donors who were confirmed positive and

112

had recovered from SARS-CoV-2. All donors screened negative for the virus using a nasal swab

113

(RT-PCR) and had IgG titers >6.5 arbitrary units per mL (AU/mL; equivalent to 1:320). Plasma

114

was collected by apheresis at an established blood donation center following standard operating

115

procedures and 21 CFR 630.10 requirements. Plasma was frozen within 24 hours of collection

116

and labeled for investigational use and ABO typing.

117

Data and Data Sources

118

Demographic, clinical and outcomes data were prospectively collected from electronic

119

patient medical records at each of the four hospitals. Descriptive data included sex, age, race,

120

ethnicity, smoking status, functional status, comorbidities, living situation, and means of arrival

121

to the hospital. Initial presentation to the Emergency Department included self-reported

122

symptoms, vital signs, degree of respiratory distress, and need for oxygen supplementation and

123

resuscitation. Initial chest X-ray findings, and laboratory markers of sepsis, inflammatory

124

response, immune deficiency and organ dysfunction were recorded. The clinical course during

125

hospital stay was prospectively captured by tracking changes in oxygenation (FiO2), need for

126

invasive ventilation, ICU level care and types of essential medications given. Patient clinical

127

status progression and recovery were prospectively monitored by capturing days on invasive

128

ventilation, intubation, extubation, discharge alive, and death during hospitalization.

129

Outcomes and Data Analysis

130

Primary clinical outcomes were rate of adverse events associated with convalescent

131

plasma administration, and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included disease progression,

132

recovery, length of hospital stay, and hospital discharge. Primary and secondary clinical

133

outcomes were compared between 2 groups based on severity of illness (15, 26) at the time of

134

plasma infusion: 1) patients with severe illness, who had not progressed to ARDS at the time of

135

enrollment, and 2) patients whose condition had progressed to critical illness at the time of

136

enrollment. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they were transferred to another acute

137

hospital; did not receive convalescent plasma with adequate antibody titer; or care was

138

withdrawn and patient received comfort care only within 5 days of plasma administration.

139

Statistical Analysis

140

Descriptive statistics included means, medians and proportions as appropriate based on

141

variable, sample size and distribution. Descriptive variables included demographic

142

characteristics, clinical parameters, and time from illness onset and hospitalization to plasma

143

transfusion. Due to the small sample size, both parametric and nonparametric statistics were used

144

in the analysis as appropriate. Continuous variables were compared using t-tests, and categorical

145

variables using Chi-square analyses and Fisher’s exact test when cell-sizes were small. SAS

146

software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for analyses. Outcomes were

147

considered statistically significant at p< 0.05.

148

Results

149

Plasma Recipients

150

A total of 46 patients (Figure 1) with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the

151

study. Eight 8/46 (17%) patients were excluded from the analysis for the following reasons: 2

152

received convalescent plasma with no detectable antibody titer; 1 was transferred to another

153

hospital; 5 were made comfort care only (CMO) and medical care was withdrawn within 5 days

154

of plasma administration. The remaining patients (n=38) included in this analysis received

155

convalescent plasma with adequate antibody titer of 1:320 (30 received 2 units, 5 were re-dosed

156

with 1 unit, 1 received 1 unit).

157

Patient demographics, clinical presentation, hospital course, and clinical outcomes are

158

shown in tables 1 through 5. Mean age was 63 years (95% CI 59–70), 53% were males, 34%

159

black, 32% white, and 34% were Hispanic; 56% of the patients were from Connecticut, 37%

160

from Harford County, 19% New Haven County, and 42% were from Hampden County,

161

Massachusetts (Table 1). More than 68% had been diagnosed with hypertension and nearly half

162

(47.4%) with diabetes mellitus; overall, 31.5% had three or more comorbidities (Table 2). As

163

shown in Table 3, mean days from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 7.3 days (95% CI

164

6.4-8.2), with the most common symptoms at admission being fever, cough and dyspnea. With

165

the exception of one patient who arrived in critical condition, subjects presented initially to the

166

hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia without evidence of ARDS or requiring

167

invasive ventilation support at the time of admission (Table 4). The most common laboratory

168

abnormalities on admission included severe rise in inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein

169

(CRP) ≥ 10 mg/dL) (66%), lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count<1,000 per microliter)

170

(50%), and hyponatremia (Na<135 mEq/L) (47%) – see Table 4.

171

Severe and Critical Illness Groups

172

At the time of plasma infusion, 16 patients (42%) met criteria for severe illness. These

173

patients were enrolled in the study and received convalescent plasma earlier in their hospital and

174

disease course on average 4.6 days (95% CI 2.9-6.3) following hospital admission, and 12.6 days

175

(95% CI 10-15.2) following symptoms’ onset while on high-flow oxygen supplementation prior

176

to any evidence of ARDS. The remaining 22 patients (58%) met the criteria for critical illness at

177

the time of convalescent plasma therapy. They enrolled in the study and received convalescent

178

plasma later in their hospital and disease course on average16.4 days (95% CI 13-19.8) following

179

hospital admission, and 23.1 days (95% CI 19.5-26.7) following symptoms’ onset after

180

developing ARDS and had been on ventilation support for an average of 10.6 days (95% CI 7.3-

181

13.9).

182

The two cohorts were comparable in demographics; comorbidities and home

183

medications; pre-illness functional status; onset of symptoms to seeking hospital care; initial

184

clinical presentation and findings; initial disease severity; and the care they received during their

185

hospitalization including essential medications (see Tables 1-5). Clinically, hyponatremia on

186

initial hospital presentation was more prevalent in the severe illness group (p=0.047).

187

Vasopressors (p<0.01), hydroxychloroquine (p<0.01), and antibiotics (p<0.01) were more

188

frequently used during hospitalization in the critical illness group. Renal replacement therapy

189

was utilized at higher rate in the critical illness group but did not reach statistical significance

190

(p=0.05).

191

Primary Outcomes

192

One patient in the severe illness group experienced a transient transfusion reaction (fever

193

and hematuria) within 2 hours of plasma infusion. No other adverse effects of convalescent

194

plasma infusion were observed. Of the 38 patients included in the analysis, 24 (63%) recovered

195

and were discharged from the hospital, and 14 (37%) died. Patients who died included two in the

196

severe illness group and 12 in the critical illness group. The difference in mortality (13% severe

197

vs 55% critical) was statistically significant (p=0.02). Overall, patients who survived (n=24)

198

regardless of disease severity at time of infusion received convalescent plasma earlier in their

199

course of disease (mean 15.3 days, SD 6.9) and hospital stay (8.4 days, SD 6.8) compared to

200

those who died (n=14) with mean durations of (24.5 days, SD 9.6), (16.6 days, SD 9.5)

201

respectively.

202

Secondary Outcomes

203

Among patients with severe illness at the time of convalescent plasma therapy, 25%

204

(4/16) progressed to ARDS after receiving convalescent plasma (Table 5). Three of the 4

205

required mechanical ventilation and 2 of the 4 died. One of those patients received convalescent

206

plasma 18 days following onset of symptoms and died of refractory shock in ICU while on

207

ventilator support. The other patient received convalescent plasma 16 days following symptom

208

onset, developed respiratory failure secondary to ARDS, and was placed on comfort measures at

209

the request of the family. The remainder (14/16, 88%) did not progress to ARDS, recovered with

210

resolution of COVID-19 pneumonia, and were discharged from the hospital.

211

In the patients with critical illness at the time plasma therapy, 10/22 (45%) recovered

212

with resolution of ARDS and restoration of organ function and left the hospital. Of the 12/22

213

(55%) who died, 6 died of refractory shock while on ventilator support with evidence of

214

pneumoperitonium in 4 of them; 3 patients died of refractory respiratory failure with terminal

215

extubation; 2 died of complications of upper airway edema; and 1 patient died of an acute

216

cardiac complication.

217

Mean hospital length of stay was 25.6 days (95% CI 20.8-30.4) (Table 5). Length of stay

218

was significantly shorter in the severe illness group (15.5 days, 95% CI 9.3-21.6) compared to

219

patients in the critical illness group (33.0 days, 95% CI 27.3-38.7) (p<0.01). Statistical analyses

220

showed that patients treated earlier in the course of COVID-19 disease (severe group) had

221

significantly lower hospital mortality (p=0.02) and shorter hospital length of stay (p<0.01) after

222

convalescent plasma therapy compared to patients that were treated later in their disease course

223

in presence of ARDS (critical group) (Table 5). Other prognostic factors that were significantly

224

associated with good clinical outcomes included shorter durations between symptoms onset and

225

convalescent plasma administration (p<0.01), and hospital admission and administration of

226

convalescent plasma (p<0.01).

228

Among this group of hospitalized patients with severe or critical COVID-19 who

229

received convalescent plasma with adequate antibody titer, only one patient experienced a

230

transient transfusion reaction. This low rate of adverse event secondary to convalescent plasma

231

therapy is consistent with recent published literature (22, 23). The overall hospital mortality

232

among our patients was 37%. However, patients who received convalescent plasma early in the

233

disease course (severe illness group) as compared to the patients that received convalescent

234

plasma later in disease progression (critical illness group) had significantly lower hospital

235

mortality 13% vs 55% (p<0.02) and shorter mean hospital length of stay 15.4 vs 33 days

236

(p<0.01). In addition, only 4 patients (25%) in the severe illness group developed ARDS, with 3

237

of them needing invasive ventilation support following convalescent plasma therapy. Two of the

238

3 recovered and were discharged.

239

It is important to understand the timeline and dynamics of COVID-19 hospitalizations in

240

Connecticut and Western Massachusetts at the time when we launched our research study. Our

241

study patients presented initially to the hospital with an average of 7.3 days (95% CI 6.4-8.2)

242

from symptoms’ onset to hospitalization, and 97 % (37/38) of the patients had moderate to

243

severe disease without evidence of ARDS or urgent need for invasive ventilation support upon

244

admission. By the time we enrolled our first patient in late April 2020, hospitals participating in

245

the study were at their peak COVID-19 census, with a large number of seriously ill patients who

246

had been hospitalized for an average of 2 weeks, and were not improving with supportive care or

247

medications (see Table 5). Some of those patients deteriorated and needed ICU care and

248

ventilator support for an average of 7 days prior to enrollment. Many had severe lung damage

249

and multi-organ failure. In the early phase of our study, physicians enrolled mostly patients in

250

this critical illness category. In majority of cases, patients died due to secondary irreversible

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.27.20183293; this version posted September 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

251

complications of COVID-19. As our study progressed, physicians started enrolling patients

252

earlier in their disease course and hospital stay before respiratory status deterioration.

253

Upon admission to the hospital, the two cohorts were similar in their demographic

254

characteristics, pre-illness functional status, comorbidities, initial clinical presentation to the

255

hospital, and initial disease severity. However, at the time of convalescent plasma administration,

256

the groups diverged on their disease severity and duration from disease onset to plasma therapy.

257

The patients in our study who received convalescent plasma earlier in their disease course

258

(severe illness group) had significantly more favorable primary and secondary clinical outcomes

259

as compared to the critical group. We speculate that convalescent plasma given earlier in the

260

disease course arrested the progression to irreversible complications like ARDS or organ failure.

261

In addition, we found that patients who survived in both groups had shorter times between onset

262

of symptoms and convalescent plasma administration compared to those that died.

263

The literature suggests that convalescent plasma may be more beneficial when

264

administered sooner to disease onset (16, 17). Data recently published on COVID-19 suggested

265

favorable clinical outcomes when convalescent plasma is given earlier in the course of disease

266

(21-25). Our finding is consistent with the literature that treating patient with COVID-19 disease

267

with convalescent plasma within the first two weeks following symptom onset may promote

268

recovery (27). Perhaps earlier treatment with convalescent plasma allows antibodies to neutralize

269

the virus before irreversible complications (19). Vasopressor, antibiotics and renal replacement

270

therapy were utilized at higher rate in the critical group – we speculate that these therapies were

271

proxies for serious and refractory complications among critically ill patients that could not be

272

reversed by administration of convalescent plasma. We also speculate that the difference in

274

evidence in association with hydroxychloroquine efficacy and safety and subsequent change in

275

practice during our study. Important limitations in this study include open-label, no control group

276

and modest sample size. However, this early report is important as it meaningfully contributes to

277

the questions whether convalescent plasma is safe and it sheds light on important factors that are

278

associated with favorable outcomes including recovery and survival.

279

Conclusions

280

For patients with severe or critical COVID-19 disease, convalescent plasma from

281

recovered COVID-19 patients is safe and has the potential for positive impact on clinical

282

outcomes including recovery and survival if given early in course of disease. Our study makes a

283

strong case for the importance of pursing a randomized placebo control trial focused on enrolling

284

patients early in the course of their disease to further explore experimentally the efficacy and

285

effectiveness of convalescent plasma in Covid-19.
