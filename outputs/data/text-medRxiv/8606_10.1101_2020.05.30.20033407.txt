Abstract

Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is threatening a surging
number of populations worldwide, including women in breastfeeding period. Limited evidence is
available concerning breastfeeding in women with COVID-19.

Methods: Twenty-three pregnant women and puerperae were enrolled in the study. To evaluate the
effect of breastfeeding on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the presence of SARS-CoV-2, IgG and IgM
in breast milk, maternal blood and infant blood were assessed. Feeding patterns were also
recorded in follow-up.

Results: No positive detection for SARS-CoV-2 of neonates was found. All breast milk samples
were negative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of IgM ofSARS-CoV-2 in breast
milk was correlated with maternal blood. The results of IgG detection for SARS-CoV-2 were
negative in all breast milk samples. All the infants were in healthy condition while six of them
were fed with whole or partial breast milk. Eight infants received antibody test for SARS-CoV-2
in one month after birth and the results were all negative.

Conclusion: Findings from this small number of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence
for mother-to-child transmission via breast feeding in women with COVID-19 in the third
trimester and puerperium.

Keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, breastfeeding, mother-to-child transmission, antibodies.

Introduction

The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was started in Wuhan, China, since December
2019, and rapidly spread to the rest of the country. COVID-19 also occurred in other countries and
become a global threat. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 all over the world have surpassed 690 000
with over 33 000 deaths by March 31st, 2020.

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 shares about 80% sequence identity with other two coronaviruses
causing emergent public health events in recent decades, severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) [1]. The
epidemiology of COVID-19 is similar to that of SARS and MERS with droplets and close contact
as the main transmission route [2]. Based on the understanding of SARS and MERS, control
measures provided by World Health Organization include maintaining distance to avoid close
contact. Although fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be lower than that of SARS and MERS,
more people are threatened by COVID-19 because of much higher infectious capability [3]. Large
number of specific populations such as women in the breastfeeding period suffer from the threat
of the disease. Previously, a study involved nine pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 and
their infants showed no direct evidence of maternal-infant transmission, but little was reported on
how breastfeeding would affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission [4]. Breastfeeding involves a serious
of intimate behaviors including skin-to-skin touch and inadvertent cough or sneeze between
mothers and infants. Guidelines on breastfeeding in women with COVID-19 are controversial.
The guideline for pregnant women suspected with SARS-CoV-2 suggested isolation of mothers
from infants without breastfeeding until viral shedding is clear [5] in consideration of possible

transmission caused by the intimate behaviors. Similarly, expert consensus from Chinese
Obstetricians and Gynecologists Association (COGA) does not recommend breastfeeding [6].
However, there is no enough evidence for mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) up to now. Royal
College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists (RCOG) suggests breastfeeding since they believed the
benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the potential risks of MTCT [7]. Therefore, the safety of
breastfeeding in women with COVID-19 is worth exploring. In this study, we performed a
preliminary study to evaluate the safety of breastfeeding in women infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Methods

Study design and patients

Total twenty-three pregnant women with fourteen confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and
nine suspected with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. The confirmation of SARS-CoV-2
infection and the onset of illness took place all in the third trimester and puerperium. All the
patients were admitted in Western Branch of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong
University of Science and Technology (HUST) from February 1st to March 15th, 2020. Diagnosis
of COVID-19 was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program
(7th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China [8]. The presence of
SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in throat swabs or blood was determined by quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction. The detection of both IgM and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 from break milk
or patients’ serum was performed by ELISA. Suspected cases were defined as those with typical
changes in chest CT scan of viral pneumonia, but with negative etiologic or serological evidence

of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and
approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, HUST
(approval number 20200047). Written informed consent forms were obtained from all enrolled
patients.

Data and sample collection

Medical record data of all patients were reviewed. Respiratory tract samples from the patients
and throat swabs of their neonates were collected after delivery. Sample collection was done by
following the guidelines for COVID-19 issued by Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). Briefly, clinical specimens from tonsils and posterior pharyngeal wall were
collected by synthetic fiber swabs and conserved in sterile tubes containing 3 ml of viral transport
medium. Breast milk samples were collected from puerperae and stored in -80. Sample testing
was performed in Department of Clinical Laboratory, Union Hospital Tongji Medical College,
HUST and Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences by detection of ORF1ab
gene and N gene of SARS-CoV-2 (BioGerm, Shanghai, China) as described previously [4]. The
detection of IgG and IgM for SARS-CoV-2 in maternal blood and breast milk was performed
using IgG/IgM ELISA kit (Livzon, China) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The
detection of IgG and IgM of SARS-CoV-2 in infants was performed one month after birth by
colloidal gold stripes (Livzon, China).

Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation and compared using the
Student ’ s t-test. Categorical variables were expressed as number (%) and compared using
chi-square or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Statistical analysis was done in SPSS version 21.0.

Results

Diagnosis for COVID-19 of patients were confirmed in the third trimester (20 in 23, 87%) and
puerperal period (3 in 23, 13%). Age range of the patients was 21-40 years with an average of 29.2
± 4.9 years. The gestational week on delivery was ranged from 34 weeks plus 2 days to 41 weeks
plus 3 days. Clinical features of these patients on admission were listed in Table 1.

None of the patients reported to have direct contact with Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market.
In total, six patients who were all from the confirmed group reported that they had a clear contact
history with confirmed COVID-19 patients. Fever was the most common complaint when patients
were admitted, which had a significantly higher rate in confirmed group than in suspected group
(71.4% vs 11.1%, p<0.05). Other symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection were also
reported without statistical difference: eleven patients with cough (nine in confirmed group and
two in suspected group), three with myalgia (all from confirmed group) and two with dyspnea (all
from confirmed group). One patient presented diarrhea from confirmed group, which is an
atypical symptom of COVID-19. Notably, eight patients were asymptomatic, and the rate of
asymptomatic patients was significantly lower in confirmed group than that in suspected group
(14.3% vs 55.6%, p<0.05).

Most cases were terminated with cesarean section. None of the patients required mechanical
ventilation. Six (42.9%) confirmed patients and 2 (22.2%) suspected patients received antepartum
antiviral therapy. Ten (71.4%) confirmed patients and four (44.4%) suspected patients received
antiviral treatment after delivery. Six (42.9%) confirmed patients and one (11.1%) suspected
patients received antepartum glucocorticoid therapy. Ten (71.4%) confirmed and three (33.3%)
suspected patients received hormone after delivery. There were no statistical differences in these
treatments between the two groups.

All the pregnancies were singleton. The average birth weight was 3173.9 ± 470.7g with no
clinical manifestation of neonatal asphyxia. SARS-CoV-2 detection of throat swab was performed
in fifteen neonates at birth and in six neonates in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) after birth.
All the results of SARS-CoV-2 testing in neonates were negative. Clinical features of neonates
were displayed in Table 2. Feeding patterns and health conditions of the infants were followed by
March 27, 2020 (Table 2). All infants in confirmed group were discharged from NICU, and had no
pneumonia-related symptom. Six infants were fed with whole or partial breast milk. Eight infants
(five in confirmed group and three in suspected group) received antibody testing one month after
birth. The testing was not performed in other fifteen infants because it was rejected by their
parents or the infants were under one month. The results of IgM or IgG detection in infants were
all negative (Table 2).

Most of the breast milk samples were collected within one week postpartum. Samples from
two patients were collected on the 15th and 12th day after delivery, respectively, since the
puerperae were diagnosed as COVID-19 after delivery. In confirmed group, six samples were
collected at the time when SARS-CoV-2 detection in throat swab became negative. The results of

SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection in all breast milk samples were negative (Table 3). Testing of
IgG and IgM for SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk and maternal blood was performed in seven patients
(four confirmed and three suspected) (Table 4). IgM antibody was present in all four confirmed
patients (100%) and one suspected patient (33.3%), which was in accordance with IgM detection
in the maternal blood. IgG antibody was all negative whatever it was positive or negative in
maternal blood (Table 4).

Discussion

In this study, we reported a cohort of twenty-three puerperae confirmed or suspected with
COVID-19. The clinical features of these patients showed similar patterns with other patients
reported [3]. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptom was
rare but reported in our cohort. It has been suggested that pregnant women and puerparae within
one month after delivery are at greatest risk for respiratory infectious disease like influenza [9].
Cohort studies from SARS and MERS reveal high mortality and increased requirement for
mechanical ventilation and ICU admission even when the termination of pregnancy was
performed [10, 11]. Severe patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and high
incidence of severe neonatal asphyxia were reported in pregnancy with COVID-19 [12]. Pregnant
outcomes were mild in our study without maternal or fetal/neonatal death, and the medical
conditions of the puerperae were stable, which were consistent with the recent reported studies [4,
13].

Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred mainly via respiratory droplets [2].

Primary epidemiological feature of COVID-19 is familial cluster [14]. Unlike early reported cases,
proportion of patients with contact history of Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market or intimate
interactions with confirmed patients was much smaller [4]. In consideration of these information,
special attention should be paid to asymptotic case in our cohort. These patient were screened out
by chest CT scan before their admissions in other hospitals, and two of them were confirmed as
COVID-19 via throat swab specimen detection. Since SARS-CoV-2 is able to be transmitted by
asymptomatic carriers [15], routine screening of COVID-19 should be performed before planned
admission of pregnant women during epidemic situation for the safety of other inpatients and
health care workers. Compared with nucleic acid testing, chest CT scan is more convenient and
feasible in most medical institutions with a relative high sensitivity in distinguishing COVID-19
from viral pneumonia [16]. Therefore, chest CT scan should be considered as a primary screening
tool for COVID-19 detection before admission of pregnant women. Although the radiation
exposure through single examination is much lower than estimated dose for fetus harm, chest CT
scan in indicated pregnant patients should following As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA)
principle [17].

With extensive progress in the study of SARS-CoV-2, the presence of the virus was verified in
patients’ body fluids such as urine and blood besides specimens from respiratory tract [18]. Thus,
other possible transmission routes are worth exploring. Presence of viral nucleic acids of
SARS-CoV-2 detected in fecal samples points out the probability of fecal-oral transmission in
COVID-19 [19]. Negative results of SARS-CoV-2 detection in amniotic fluid and umbilical cord
blood indicate a less probability of intrauterine transmission from mother to fetus [4]. However,
recent researches reported IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were detected in some

newborns to mothers with COVID-19 [20], implying the occurrence of in utero infection. So far,
no literature has described or discussed about the possibility of MTCT via breastfeeding.

Breastfeeding contributes to the health and well-being of both mothers and infants. Early
initiation of breastfeeding protects the newborns from acquiring infection and reduces infant
mortality [21], especially in premature infants [22]. WHO suggests breastfeeding should be started
within one hour after birth and extended until two years old. However, the recommendation
becomes complicating when the mothers suffer from infectious diseases. On one hand,
immunomodulatory proteins in human milk provide anti-infective benefits for infants, particularly
protection against virus causing respiratory and gastrointestinal tract diseases [23]. On the other
hand, breast milk may be contaminated with virus such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV),
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), indicating possible risk of
MTCT via breastfeeding [24]. Numerous studies have been done in the field of investigating
breastfeeding in mothers with viral infection, and the safety of breastfeeding has been reported
that no additional risk of MTCT in mothers with HBV or HIV [25, 26]. Continuation of
breastfeeding is also recommended in mothers infected with H1N1 influenza [27]. Therefore,
breastfeeding should not be simply forbidden in mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 unless
potential risks overweigh advantages of breast feeding.

The absence of SARS-CoV-2 in all breast milk samples in our study was in accordance with
the report by Chen et al where breast milk samples were tested from six patients confirmed with
COVID-19 [4]. Additionally, our study verified that free of SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk no matter
the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was positive or negative in specimens from upper respiratory tract.
Even with a small number of cases, this result strongly indicates that breast milk may not be a

transmitting vector for SARS-CoV-2, thus breastfeeding is possible for mothers with COVID-19
theoretically. Furthermore, due to the ability of IgG to cross the placenta, the presence of IgG for
SARS-CoV-2 in blood samples of mothers before delivery imply the possibility of antepartum
protection for fetus. The presence of IgM for SARS-CoV-2 in maternal blood samples was
consistent with the presence of IgG. IgG and IgM in breast milk are produced by different
mechanisms. Antibody level of IgG and IgM in breast milk were lower than that in maternal blood
[28]. IgM antibody of infectious diseases in breast milk is able to provide protection of the same
pathogens to infants[29] and inhibit entry and transport of virus such as HIV to infants[30]. We
inferred that postpartum protection by antibodies may also exist in SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers
to their infants via breastfeeding.

All the infants were in healthy physical conditions by the end of follow-up (March 27, 2020).
The rate of breast/mixed feeding was much lower in confirmed group than that in suspected group
according to our follow-up. Only one confirmed patient is giving breastfeeding to her infant. The
less occasion of breastfeeding in mothers with COVID-19 is due to the cautious suggestion given
by COGA under the circumstances that the safety for breastfeeding was uncertain. Besides this
case in the study, another patient with confirmed COVID-19 discharged from our hospital has
started breastfeeding from middle of February, and no clinical manifestation of pneumonia was
developed in her infant (data not shown). The patient was not included in this cohort because we
failed to collected her breast milk during her hospitalization. However, due to the lack of
evidences from larger sample size in breastfeeding practice, mothers with COVID-19 who have
the intention of breastfeeding should be informed of current dilemma of breastfeeding with
COVID-19 and possibility of transmission by close contact. Several measures can be performed to

limit viral spread as RCOG recommends, such as hand washing before feeding the infants,
avoiding coughing or sneezing during feeding and wearing a face mask. Expressed milk for bottle
feeding by uninfected relatives may also be an alternative. Furthermore, antiviral remedy should
be reconsidered if the mothers are willing to start or continue breastfeeding after confirmed or
suspected with COVID-19.

In summary, our study proposed for the first time the feasibility of breastfeeding in women
infected with SARS-CoV-2. Taking the potential benefits and risks into account, breastfeeding is
encouraged if there is no other medical contradiction. The study was preliminary with a small
sample size and short interval for medical observation. The safety of breastfeeding should be
proved by further study.
