Abstract
Background & Aims
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COIVD-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been
characterized as a pandemic, which causes a serious public health challenge in the
world. A very large group of patients infected by HBV has been reported worldwide,
especially in China. In order to answer whether specific treatment strategy on the
patients coinfected with HBV and SARS-CoV-2, it requires profound understanding
of the clinical characteristics on those patients. However, the impacts of SARS-CoV-2
infection on HBV patients remain largely unknown.
Approach & Results
In this retrospective investigation, we included 123 COVID-19 patients admitted to
Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from January 5 to March 7,
2020. All enrolled patients are the laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases
according to the criteria reported previously. A total of 123 patients were analyzed for
their Clinical records, laboratory results including the diagnosis of

HBV infection

and liver function. Among 123 confirmed COVID-19 patients, the mean age was 51
years old and 59.3% were females (73/123). Fifteen were previously HBV infected
patients, 66.7% of them were males (10/15), patients with HBV infection appeared to
have a higher incidence of liver cirrhosis and an increased level of total bilirubin.
Seven (46.7%) patients with HBV infection were defined as severe cases, while the
severity rate was 24.1% for the patients without HBV infection (26/108). The
mortality of patients with HBV infection was 13.3% (2/15) compared to 2.8% (3/108)
for the patients without HBV infection.

Conclusions
SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause Live function damage in COVID-19 cases and the
patients with HBV infection are likely to have more severe disease outcome.

In early December 2019, there was an outbreak of novel coronavirus-associated
pneumonia in Wuhan, China. The virus was spreading rapidly to other cities of China
and accumulating cases had been reported in coming days(1). According to the
announcement of the World Health Organization (WHO), the disease has been
officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) (2). The etiology of the
disease was identified to be a novel Î²-coronavirus, named as severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on the phylogenetic relationship with
SARS-CoV. On March 11, 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 as a
pandemic. So far, more than 290,000 people in over 180 countries or territories have
reported COVID-19 cases, and more than 12,000 people have died according to data
from

WHO

(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).

Around 25% COVID-19 cases were reported in Wuhan, China.
In addition to the recent emerged SARS-CoV-2, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the
viruses which causes a global infection and threat public health. In worldwide, the
prevalence of HBsAg is about 3.9%. As high as 290 million patients are suffering
from chronic HBV infection and about 650,000 patients die from HBV infection due
to liver failure, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) each year(3, 4).
According to a nationwide epidemiological survey of population whose ages range
from 1 to 59y in China, 2016, the prevalence of HBsAg was 7.2%. Around 93 million
patients were positive for HBV infection and 20 million patients were diagnosed as
chronic hepatitis B infection(5, 6).
Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 has a capacity to infect multiply
organs including upper respiratory tract, lung, kidney probably due to the expression
of SRAS-CoV-2 receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), on these

tissues(7). A recent research has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection was
associated with live function damage in COVID-19 patients(8). Taking consideration
of large group of people with HBV infection, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection on
patients with HBV infection requires a further assessment in order to design the
specific treatment strategy. However, the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HBV
patients are still not clear. For example, we do not yet know whether the SARS-CoV2 infection is more severe in HBV patients and we also do not have much knowledge
about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the course of HBV infection.

In this

retrospective study, we discovered that the liver impairment is a common feature in
COVID-19 patients and as high as 46.7% patients with HBV infection develop to
severe situation during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This suggests that
patients with HBV infection might be vulnerable group to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods
Study design
From January 5 to February 7, 2020, 123 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the
study. Informed consents were obtained from all patients upon admission to the
Department of Infectious Diseases, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan,
China. The clinical outcomes (ie, discharges, mortality, Hospital stays) were
monitored up to March 7, 2020, the final date of follow-up.
Data collection
The information of enrolled patients including the demographic information, clinical
manifestations, laboratory data including blood routine examination, liver function,

Hepatitis B virus serological markers (HBsAg, anti-HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBeAg,
anti-HBcAg, HBV-DNA), and outcome of disease, were collected and reviewed by
two researchers to avoid subjective biases.
The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on real-time RT-PCR. Throat swab samples
were collected for extracting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from patients suspected of having
SARS-CoV-2 infection as described anywhere(9). The diagnostic criteria of SARSCoV-2 real-time RT-PCR were based on the recommendation by the National

Results

Baseline characteristics of COVID-19 patients with or without HBV infection
A total of 123 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, including 50
males and 73 females. Around 12.2% (15/123) of patients are also suffering from
HBV infection. Males take up 66.7% (10/15) of patients coinfected by HBV and
SARS-CoV-2 and seems to have a higher coinfection rate compared to females
(p=0.0469, Table 1). The median age of total enrolled patients was 51.0 years (IQR,
35.0-66.0; range, 20-96 years). The most common symptoms at the onset of illness
were: fever (37.4â39.1oC, 69.1%), fatigue (54.5%), cough (50.4%), myalgia (32.5%),
and less common: dyspnea (21.1%), Headache (16.3%) and diarrhea (17.1%). Among
the 123 patients, thirty-five (28.5%) cases had underlying at least one comorbidity
such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, malignancy, COPD and liver
cirrhosis. Patients with HBV infection had a higher rate of liver cirrhosis (p=0.0390,
Table 1). Seven of 15 patients (46.7%) with HBV infection develop to the severe
situation, while the percentage of severe cases is much less (24.1%) in the COVID-19
patients without HBV infection.

The treatment was mainly the supportive care (Table 1). Seventy-four patients were
given antiviral (arbidol, orally, 200 mg, three times per day), and 74 with oxygen
support. Antibiotic therapy, both orally and intravenous, were given as described in
Table 1. Sixty-one patients received corticosteroids to suppress an excessive
inflammatory activation. There is no significant difference of treatment between
patients with or without HBV infection.

laboratory Findings of COVID-19 patients with or without HBV infection at
baseline
The biochemical tests included measuring the level of alanine aminotransferase
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL),

gamma-

glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin as well as recording
prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized
ratio, d-dimer and creatinine. All of these biochemical features were found normal;
however, the level of total bilirubin was higher in patients with HBV infection
(p=0.0178, Table 2). The blood counts of the patients with or without HBV infection
showed lymphopenia (< 1.3 Ã109/L).

Hepatitis B serological markers of COVID-19 patients with HBV infection
Fifteen COVID-19 patients were examined to be HBsAg positive (5 females and 10
males). The data of anti-HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBeAg and anti-HBcAg were
available for 11 patients with ten patients HBeAg negtive and one positive. The value

of HBV-DNA was collected from 13 patients. The HBV-DNA level of 10 patients are
more than 20 IU/ml (Table S1).

Clinical outcome
We observed the clinical outcome of 123 COVID-19 patients within 31 days of
treatment. Eleven patients (73.4%) with HBV infection and 99 patients (91.6%)
without HBV infection were discharged from the hospital according to the guideline.
Two patients (13.3%) with HBV infection and 6 patients (5.6%) without HBV
infection were still hospitalized. Two patients (13.3%) with HBV infection and 3
patients (2.8%) without HBV infection were dead. Patients with HBV infection
showed higher mortality rate compared to those COVID-19 patients without HBV
infection (13.3%vs 2.8%, Table 2).

Discussion

Resemble to the other two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2
can cause patients severe respiratory symptoms and even leads to death with average
mortality rate of 3.4% (according to the data reported from WHO) though most cases
of COVID-19 are acute and resolve fast. Liver damage has been identified in around
60% of patients suffering from SARS and viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR in
liver tissue(10), which providing the evidence that SARS-CoV involved in liver injure.
Liver impairment has been also reported in MERS patients(11). According to the
clinical reports from different centers with large scale of COVID-19 cases, SARS-

CoV-2 has been found to be associated with damage or dysfunction of liver tissue(9,
12-18) and about 14% - 53% COVID-19 cases showed liver function damage with
abnormal level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
(AST). Our study is in line with previous observations. We found in COVID-19 cases
without HBV infection that about 50.9% (55/108) patients have the dysfunction of
liver symptoms by measuring the level of ALT, AST, TBIL, GGT, and ALP during
the disease progress. In our enrolled cases, we also discovered that there is higher
incidence of abnormal liver function (81.8%, 27/33) in severe COVID-19 patients
than did in mild cases (43.3%, 39/90, data not shown), which agrees with the study
that lower incidence of AST abnormality was found in the cases diagnosed by CT
scan on the subclinical stage than in the COVID-19 patients who were confirmed after
onset of symptom(15). Therefore, liver function could be considered as one factor to
indicate the progress of COVID-19.

According to other study from 1099 cases, around 23.7% of confirmed COVID-19
patients have at least one comorbidity(13). Among these pre-existing chronic diseases,
abnormal liver function is one of most common features in COVID-19 patients and
severe patients are more likely to have HBV infection. In our research, about one out
of five (7/33, 21.8%) COVID-19 severe patients were found to coinfect with HBV
infection. It has been suggested that liver impairment in COVID-19 patients could be
due to the virus direct attack or resulted by other causes such as drug toxicity and
systemic inflammation(18). To detect the viral RNA and viral particles from liver
biopsies of COVID-19 patients will be helpful to elucidate if virus infect liver tissue.
Our results pointed out that as high as around 50% (7/15) of HBV patients were
identified as severe COVID-19 cases. It is more likely that HBV patients will suffer

from more severe situation during the disease progress when were encountered with
SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our enrolled cases, two patients with SARS-CoV and
HBV coinfection died on admission. One patient died from severe liver disease,
haptic sclerosis. And the other died from intestinal hemorrhage, which seems to be
associated the impairment of gastrointestinal tract. More coinfection cases analysis
are required to further understand whether SARS-CoV-2 infection aggerates the
progress of pre-existing disease and thereby cause death. There are different phases
for HBV chronic infection including immunotolerant, viral suppression under longterm treatment with nucleotide analogues. In our current study, we collected the data
of HBV on 15 coinfection patients at one time point, which were mainly used to
identify HBV infection. More coinfection cases analysis is required to provide further
evidences for evaluating the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on active HBV
replication and live impairment at different time points for the HBV patients in
different phases.
In conclusion, by respectively analyzing the patients with coinfection of SARS-CoV2 and HBV, we found that the patients with pre-existing HBV infection will be much
more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2
infection, HBV patients should be given the specific protection.
