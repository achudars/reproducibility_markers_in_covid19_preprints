Abstract
Background
There is limited information due to absence of virus titer and symptom related changes.
Nonetheless, this is the first comparative study between the use of Foistar (Camostat mesilate) and
Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) on COVID-19 infection.

Methods
Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing
that were admitted to Seoul Medical Center (Seoul, South Korea) where is the largest public medical
center in South Korea between August 1 and September 20, 2020 were included
The data of the patients with pneumonia who received Foistar (Foistar group) during their
hospitalization period were primarily collected, and the patients who received Kaletra (Kaletra group)
during their hospitalization period were matched to have a similar age group to that of Foistar
group so that three times the number of Foistar group patients were randomly selected into Kaletra
group and their body temperature, CRP level, WBC count, and event of diarrhea were collected,
accordingly.

Results
A total of 29 patients (7 Foistar group and 22 Kaletra group) was included. The median age was 69,
and all had mild COVID-19 (WHO ordinal scale 3 or 4) on admission. 6 patients out of 7 patients
(85.71%) from Foistar group who exhibited elevated CRP levels (CRP >0.4mg/dL) on admission have
controlled their CRP levels to the normal range. In Kaletra group, 11 out of 18 patients (61.11%)
have controlled their CRP levels to the normal range, and only 1 of 2 patients (50.00%) who had
normal CRP level has maintained his or her normal CRP level. The difference in the white blood cell
counts was not significant between two groups. None of the patients in the study had hyperkalemia.

Conclusion
This study has found a probable association of controlling inflammatory reactions and fever in

COVID-19 patients with Foistar (camostat mesilate) use. In addition, there was no significant adverse
drug event found from this study upon the Foistar use. These results may encourage the use of
Foistar as a treatment option for the patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

Introduction
The new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), which began in December of 2019 in Wuhan, China,
has spread worldwide. In Korea, the outbreak of patients has surged since February 24, 2020, and
finally the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic on March 14, 2020. COVID-19
has a remarkable propagation power with the high basic reproduction number (R0) of 2-3, and the
initial symptoms are non-specific resulting repeated clusters in the community. Currently, there is
no effective vaccine or treatment that can suppress the epidemic, so it is very urgent to conduct
clinical trials on drugs that can be expected to be effective among drugs developed previously.
SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA single-strand virus penetrating into the cells through the endosome by
binding to the Spike protein, which is the structural protein, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 (ACE2) receptor on the outer wall of the host inner cell. Type-2 Transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2)
promotes priming of S-protein through proteolysis to induce binding to the cell membrane ACE2
receptor.1-3It synthesizes a polypeptide through viral RNA after entering a cell via an endosome.
These polypeptides synthesize a RNA polymerase through the formation and activation of a
replication-transcriptase complex, and replicate new RNA. The cloned RNA has a lifecycle that
generates structural proteins and release them out of the cell again.
As described above, the virus penetrates into the cell through the binding of the spike protein and
the ACE receptor, and in the meantime, TMPRSS2 plays a role in promoting the priming of the spike
protein.4 Camostat mesilate can be used as an inhibitor of these TMPRSS2 to inhibit cell invasion
of the virus.5-10
In lined with these assuring mechanisms of action of camostat against COVID-19, a total of 12
clinical trials have been registered in clinicaltrials.gov as of October 2020.11-22 The ongoing clinical
trials are in the process to confirm the efficacy and safety of camostat in COVID-19 patients in the
U.S., the UK, Denmark, Mexico, etc., along with South Korea. Accordinly, Daewoong Pharmaceutical’s
Foistar Tab., which is composed of camostat mesilate, is expected to be effective in removing virus
in COVID-19 patients and helping to relieve their symptoms. Thus, we conduct a retrospective cohort
study to confirm the preliminary effectiveness of camostat use in patients with COVID-19 infection.

Methods
1) Methods
We retrospectively reviewed medical records of COVID-19 pneumonic patients who confirmed the
positive COVID-19 by the RT-PCR test result, and were admitted to Seoul Medical Center between
August 1, 2020 and September 20, 2020. We included the patients who were administered with
either Foistar (Foistar group) or Kaletra (Kaletra group) within 7 days from admission, and
investigated its effectiveness and safety during the hospitalization period.
The body temperature, laboratory test results (i.e. CRP level, WBC counts, serum potassium level,
etc.), and the number of patients who exhibited one or more events of diarrhea were compared
between Foistar group and Kaletra group.
Body Temperature: The individual body temperature was recorded on a daily basis during the
hospitalization period.
Laboratory test results: The records of CRP level, WBC count, serum potassium level of each patient
were reviewed.
Event of Diarrhea: The number of patients who exhibited an event of diarrhea until discharge.

2) Statistical analysis
The collected data were analyzed via SAS®(Version 9.4 or above, SAS Institute Inc. NC. USA). The
continuous variables (i.e. the number of patients, standard deviations, median, min, max) were
presented as descriptive statistics, and the categorical variables were presented as a frequency, or
a percentage.
The baseline in this study was defined as the day of admission. Any missing data in the day of
discharge were replaced by the most current data before the discharge.

The patient who became pyretic in Foistar group was administered with camostat one day before
the event of fever and required high concentration of oxygen support. The fever was relieved on
the following day.

3) Laboratory tests (CRP level, WBC count)
① CRP
All seven patients in Foistar group had the elevated CRP levels (>0.4mg/dL) upon admission.

Among Kaletra group, two patients had the normal CRP levels upon the admission, and 18
patients had the elevated CRP levels, while two patients did not proceed the laboratory tests at
the admission date. The trends of CRP levels during the hospitalization period in all patients were
as follows. (Figure 2.)
Figure 2. Changes of CRP levels between Foistar group and Kaletra group

We were able to observe a probable association of decrease in CRP level with Foistar use. Six
patients (85.71%) in Foistar group have achieved the normal CRP level, while 11 patients (50.00%)
have achieved the normal CRP level in Kaletra group. Only was one of the patients (5.00%) in Kaletra
group who had the normal CRP level upon the admission able to maintain the level under 0.4mg/dL.

② WBC
Among Foistar group, 5 patients had the normal WBC count (4 -10 x 103/uL), and 2 patients
had the abnormal WBC count upon the admission. Among Kaletra group, 17 patients had the
normal WBC counts while 3 patients had the abnormal WBC counts and the rest of 2 patients did
not proceed the laboratory tests upon the admission.

The number of patients who had the abnormal WBC counts upon the admission became normal
was 2 in Foistar group, and 1 in Kaletra group. The number of patients who had normal WBC counts
upon the admission maintained normal was 5 in Foistar group, and 15 in Kaletra group.

③ Potassium
All 7 patients in Foistar group had the normal serum potassium level (3.5-5.5 mg/dL) upon the
admission. Among Kaletra group, 19 patients had the normal serum potassium level, one of them
was abnormal. The rest of 2 patients did not proceed the laboratory tests, therefore, they were
excluded from the analysis
The all seven patients (100%) who had the normal potassium level in Foistar group were able to
maintain their normal potassium level until discharge while 18 patients (90.00%) in the control group

maintained their normal potassium levels. One of the patients (5.00%) who had the normal
potassium level upon the admission in Kaletra group has become abnormal. Among the patients
who had the abnormal potassium level in the control group, 1 patient (5.00%) has remained
abnormal until discharge.

4) Event of diarrhea
An event of diarrhea during the hospitalization period was chart-reviewed. No patient in Foistar
group had an event of diarrhea, while 9 patients (40.91%) had one or more events of diarrhea in
Kaletra group until the discharge.

Conclusion
Among Foistar group, the event of fever was observed in 1 patient, and none was observed in
Kaletra group during the hospitalization period.
We have observed a possible advantage of Foistar on the anti-inflammatory effect against
COVID-19, given 6 patients out of 7 patients (85.71%) from Foistar group who exhibited elevated
CRP levels (CRP >0.4mg/dL) upon the admission have controlled their CRP levels to the normal
range. Meanwhile, we concluded that the comparison on fever control, and WBC counts was
considered inappropriate due to the significant difference in the baseline between two groups.
In addition, we could suggest further safety upon Foistar use as none of the patients have
displayed hyperkalemia. a known adverse reaction of Foistar.25 On the other hand, we observed
that the use of Kaletra was likely associated with an event of diarrhea. More than one event of
diarrhea was observed from 9 patients out of 22 patients (40.91%) from Kaletra group, while none
was found in Foistar group.
In conclusion, this study was able to demonstrate a probable association in fever control and the
anti-inflammatory effects with the administration of Foistar in COVID-19 patients26,27. Further, the
feasible safety profile of Foistar was observed in this study. Thus, the clinical use of Foistar is
expected to have a favorable association with managing symptoms and clinical manifestations of
COVID-19 such as fever, inflammation, etc. Although a further large-scale clinical trial with diverse
clinical endpoints and the evaluation of virus titer is warranted, our study outcomes may positively
encourage the use of Foistar as a treatment option for COVID-19.

Discussion
Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) is currently being used in COVID-19 patients as a possible therapeutic
drug. However, it has been known to cause adverse reactions in the gastrointestinal tract such as
diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. In fact, the patients from the control group in this study have
complained of diarrhea as well with minimal effectiveness against COVID-19 infection.
On the other hand, Foistar, which has recently been considered COVID-19 treatment, has
established a stable safety profile since it has been marketed for a long period of time. For instance,
hyperkalemia, which is one of the most common adverse reactions25, has not even occurred in this
study. In addition, this is the first ever study where the anti-inflammatory effects of Foistar were
confirmed in COVID-19 patients, thus, the results led to conclude that Foistar can be beneficial in
the clinical settings for the mild COVID-19 patients. A future confirmatory large-scale prospective
clinical trial of Foistar in COVID-19 infection is warranted to further ascertain its efficacy as COVID19 treatment.
