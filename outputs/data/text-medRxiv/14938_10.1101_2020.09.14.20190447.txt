Abstract
Background
On March 11, 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
as a global pandemic. There emerged a need for reliable models to estimate the imminent incidence and
overall assessment of the outbreak, in order to develop effective interventions and control strategies.
One such vital metrics for monitoring the transmission trends over time is the time-dependent effective
reproduction number ( ). is an estimate of secondary cases caused by an infected individual at a time
during the outbreak, given that a certain population proportion is already infected. Misestimated is
particularly concerning when probing the association between the changes in transmission rate and the
changes in the implemented policies. In this paper, we substantiate the implementation of the
instantaneous reproduction number ( ) method over the conventional method to estimate viz case
reproduction number ( ), by unmasking the real-time estimation ability of both methodologies using
credible datasets.
Materials & Methods
We employed the daily incidence dataset of COVID-19 for India and high incidence states to estimate
and
. We compared the real-time projection obtained through these methods by corroborating
those states that are containing high number of COVID-19 cases and are conducting high and efficient
COVID-19 testing. The
and
were estimated using R0 and EpiEstim packages respectively in R
software 4.0.0.
Results
Although, both the
and
for the selected states were higher during the lockdown phases (March
25 - June 1, 2020) and subsequently stabilizes co-equally during the unlock phase (June 1- August 23,
2020),
demonstrated variations in accordance with the interventions while
remained
generalized and under- & overestimated. A larger difference in
and
estimates was also
observed for states that are conducting high testing.
Conclusion
Of the two methods,
elucidated a better real-time progression of the COVID-19 outbreak
conceptually and empirically, than that of
. However, we also suggest considering the assumptions
corroborated in the implementations which may result in misleading conclusions in the real world.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a novel Coronavirus
(SARS CoV 2). As of March 11, around 53,370 and 4,627 COVID-19 cases and deaths were reported
respectively, including 62 cases and 1 death in India.[1] In the light of its rapid spreading in India and an
alarming number of daily deaths caused by it, the government of India along with state governments
took many strong preventive measures and non-pharmaceutical interventions to flatten the daily
incidence and daily death curve. A varying trend of the infection spread have been reported for different
locations, which remained ambiguous due to the novel nature of the virus. To unmask this underlying
pattern behind the anomalous behavior of the outbreak in response to an intervention, studies to
ascertain a suitable epidemiological model are now in the center stage. Accurate modeling of disease
transmission is crucial for optimizing control interventions and often-limited healthcare facilities. One of
the vital metrics for the assessment of transmission rate over time is the time-dependent effective
reproduction number ( ).[3] is an estimate of secondary cases caused by an infected individual at a
time
during the outbreak, given that a certain population proportion is already infected. The
indicates the mitigation of the pandemic while a higher
i.e. >1, indicates the outbreak
progression. A faulty estimate of can systematically under- or overestimate the true transmission rate.
Biases are particularly concerning if they occur near the critical threshold viz = 1. The most prevailing
and extensively used methodology for the estimation of the effective reproduction number is proposed
by Wallinga and Teunis (2004), often called the case reproduction number
.[4]
is basically a
probabilistic reconstruction of the transmission network, counting the average secondary cases produced
by an individual. However, this method amalgamates the incidence data from time later than , which
when applied on a data aggregated on a shorter time step, generates an erroneous estimate producing
significantly negative autocorrelation when considered the true incidence.[5] Also, Implementation of
sometimes requires sound statistical expertise to produce credible estimates, which is often absent
in non-modelers. Previous studies assert that correct modeling is essential in the assessment of policy,
population susceptibility and other transmission affecting factors.[6] A fallible
estimate of the timedependent reproduction number could be potentially pernicious. To overcome these shortcomings, Cori
et al. proposed the instantaneous reproduction number ( ) for real-time estimation of
by
corroborating incidences that occurred prior to time t, thus indicating a near real-time estimation of
disease transmission.[7]
Both
and
incorporates the generation interval for the estimation of the reproduction number.
Precisely, the generation interval is the time interval between the exposure of the infector and the
exposure of the infectee. In the case of COVID-19, the accurate time of exposure is extremely difficult
to report.[8] The standard proxy for generation time is serial interval viz the time duration between the
onset of the symptom in infector and infectee.[8][9] In this paper, we incorporated the serial interval to
estimate
and
for India and high incidence states. The study aims to unfold the varying
projections of obtained by
and
and to probe their credibility by employing the incidence
dataset of the states that contain high incidence numbers and has performed robust testing.

2. Methods
and
requires the incidence dataset and the serial interval distribution to estimate
.
Conceptually different from Cori et al. (2013) and Wallinga et al. (2014), Bettencourt et al. (2008)
proposed a methodology to estimate
based on the SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model, that
incorporates the growth rate of SIR and estimates the number of infections between the time intervals.[10]
Although Bettencourt et al. method has the capacity for a credible real-time
estimation, the results
could be highly misleading as (1) the model requires a great deal of structural assumptions; (2) SIR
based models do not account for the latency period.[5][11] In this work, we focus on
and
methods
and probe their behavior over the benchmark dataset. The
and
estimations were carried out
under the standard assumptions: (1) The serial interval of COVID-19 follows a gamma distribution with
mean 4 and standard deviation 2. Previous studies investigating the serial interval of COVID-19 validate
the same.[5][12][13] (2) The outbreak within the individual state is entirely driven by local transmission. In
order to corroborate this assumption, we estimated s (i.e.
and
) from the date of the imposition
of the first national lockdown viz March 25, 2020. The lockdown as a non-pharmaceutical intervention,
resulted in a transmission arrest, ideally confining the outbreak within the state. (3) estimate tends to
be misleading in the situation where there is underreporting, however, if the rate of underreporting is
constant, then it has no significant impact over the estimate.[14] Sequentially, the rate of underreporting
in this study is assumed to be constant.
Here we also analyze the credibility of
and
by juxtaposing their respective estimations over two
different time periods viz (1) March 25, 2020 to August 23, 2020, and (2) June 1, 2020 to August 23,
2020. The former interval provides an overview of the
and
behavior throughout the entire lockdown interventions (Lockdown 1: March 25; Lockdown 2: April 15; Lockdown 3: May 4; Lockdown 4:
May 18) and the unlock phases (Unlock 1: June 1; Unlock 2: July 1; Unlock 3: August 23) (detailed
description of the initiatives and strategies administered during each phase is given in Table S2). The
later interval is crucial for a comparative analysis of
and
as unlock phases invite abruptions in
the infection transmission and we assert that an efficient model should be able to capture these
variations. In order to investigate the credibility of the model, the later interval is an ideal window to
probe the estimates by the methods.
2.1 Dataset
In relevance to the aim of this study, a benchmark dataset is essential to project a true comparison of the
reproduction number estimates obtained by the methods. The study corroborates the dataset for the state:
(1) If the total incidence reported in a state is ≥ 50,000; (2) If total cases per million in the state are ≥
1000; (3) If the state has conducted more than 9000 testing per million as on August 23; and, (4) if the
percent (%) of positive cases detected among the sample tested (test positive rate TPR) is greater than
5.0 %. This resulted in a sample of eight states namely Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka,
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal (Table 1). The benchmark dataset of state-wise
daily new cases and the daily test counts were obtained from covid19india.org. The data of the test
sampling efficiency for a state were provided by ICMR (Health departments of State governments).

2.2 Case Reproduction Number (

)

Wallinga et al. proposed a likelihood-based estimation method to estimate

, also called case or cohort

reproduction number because it measures the average number of infections that an infected cohort may
cause, given that the cohort was infected at time . Precisely, the methods infer “who infected whom”
through an observed serial interval distribution while reducing the computational burden by
incorporating infector-infectee pairs rather than the complete infection network to measure the
likelihood of transmission. Let denotes the time of the onset of symptoms in the individual . Given a
serial interval distribution
, being the generation interval, the relative likelihood ( ) that
individual has been infected by the individual is given as (eq 1):

…………………………………. (eq 1)

Where is the total incidence reported for each reported case and
is the probability of a -day
interval i.e. the duration between the onset of symptoms in the infector-infectee pair. The quantity
is
a relative likelihood, normalized by the likelihood of the event where is infected by the individual .
Sequentially, the Wallinga et al. method obtains the effective reproduction number as (eq 2):
…………………….……………....…………… (eq 2)

A preeminent overview of the underlying mathematical derivation is described in Wallinga et al. [4]
2.3 Instantaneous Reproduction Number (

)

Based on the work of Fraser C. (2007), Cori et al. estimated instantaneous reproduction number
through the ratio of new incidence ( ) produced at time step to the total infectiousness of infected
individuals at time .[16][7] The latter is given as eq 3.
………………………………… (eq 3)

Where
is the probability distribution of the infectiousness profile of an individual at units of time
from the time of the infection induced in the individual, independent of calendar time . The probability
distribution of infectiousness profile depends on biological factors such as immunity or genetics for an
individual. Serial interval may be employed as a proxy for . Subsequently, the average incidence at
is (eq 4),

The simulations were performed under the aforementioned assumptions within a confidence interval
(CI) of 95%.
3. Results and Discussion
The average
and
for India during the imposition of Lockdown-1 (March 25, 2020) to the later
phase of Unlock-3 (August 23, 2020) was 1.22 (1.19, 1.26; 95% CI) and 1.20 (1.18, 1.21; 95% CI)
respectively. Both the metrics were indicating high infection transmission during the early time in the
Lockdown-1, consistently declining with two consecutive minor yet significant peaks reported around
the end of Lockdown-2 (~ April 30, 2020) and around the beginning of Lockdown-4 (~ May 18, 2020);
and eventually continues to stabilize from Unlock-1 and remain steady thereafter (Fig1. A, B). We then
compared
and
estimates during the unlock phase 1-3 as the state border of the containment
zone were sealed but the inter-state movement was unrestricted. The average
and
for the post
unlock period (i.e. June 1, 2020 to August 23, 2020) was 1.15 (1.13, 1.16; 95% CI) and 1.12 (1.11, 1.12;
95% CI) respectively (Fig1. C, D). The

remained high (4.05 (3.77, 4.32; 95% CI) & 3.33 (3.31, 3.36;
95% CI)) early in the time series for both the interval which is very unpragmatic. For entire incidence
across India, the two methods almost resembled each other however when estimated over the unlock
phase,
indicated a significantly higher value of 3.33 (3.31, 3.36; 95% CI) in the beginning of the
time interval, which contradicts with its own estimates of 1.14 (1.11, 1.16; 95% CI) when estimated
over the entire Lockdown-Unlock phase (i.e. March 25 to August 23) (Fig1. A, C). On the other hand,
estimates for unlock phases remained in line with the estimated
for the entire lockdown-unlock
period (Fig 1.B, D).
On the same note, these irregularities in
estimates were observed while probing the transmission of
COVID-19 in the high incidence states (Fig S1, S2). For each state, the average
remained
overestimated than average
for both the time intervals viz entire lockdown-unlock duration and the
Unlock 1-3. Average estimates of
and
for the high incidence states including India is given in
Table 2. We found that
consistently estimated a high
in the initial days of the time series
independent of the intervals, which implicates misleading conclusions regarding the infection
transmission during the unlock phases (Fig S2). While the real-time estimate of
by
was found
superior to
for all the sample states, this was best illustrated in the cases for Delhi and West Bengal
(Fig2). As on August 23, 2020, Delhi contained the highest incidence per million (7996.14) in India and

has conducted the highest number of COVID-19 testing per million (70,870.8). The daily new cases in
Delhi started to fall significantly from around June 23, 2020, and continued to decline with irregular
local minimums (Fig2. A). This consistent fall was best captured by
while
remained sensitive
for the local peaks and overestimated the incidence during unlock 2-3 (Fig2. B). More importantly, the
detected the variations at earliest while the
estimations remained delayed. The underlying
mathematical reason behind this anomalistic estimation by
is that the
amalgamates a weighted
sum across transmission events observed after time independent of the trend of transmission before ,
and this leads to misleading estimations in the latter portion of the time series. While 138,871 total cases
of COVID-19 were recorded for West Bengal as of August 23, 2020, the growth of the incidence
remained slow during the Lockdown Phase 1-2 viz March 25, 2020 to April 15, 2020, possibly due to
underreporting. This anomaly in data was highly underestimated by
, indicating a complete end of
the transmission (
= 0) (Fig2. C), which is very contradictory. On the other hand,
reflected a
subtle decline in the estimate but remained in line with the overall true incidence projection by
remaining immune to such data inconsistency (Fig2. C). Similar contradictory over- & underestimations
by
were observed for the cases of other states such as Maharashtra, Gujrat and Telangana (Fig S1,
S2).
These deflections of
from
estimates for a state were found significantly associated with the
amount of testing the state has conducted (Fig3). Higher deflection was observed for the states that have
conducted a high number of testing (R square 0.801, p=0.003; CI 95%) (Fig3. B). This association
remained intact for the Unlock 1-3 interval as well (Fig3. C). We assert that (1) Because of high testing,
the incidence data represents close to real-time incidence occurring in the state, which subsequently
facilitates a better comparison of the models. (2) The deflection of
from
estimate could also
serve as an indicator for assessment of the sufficiency of testing against the infection transmission.
4. Conclusion
Although many studies in the past have employed
for the modelling of effective reproduction
number
in order to probe COVID-19 outbreak in India, this study retrospectively investigated the
contrasting estimates of by
and
for the high incidence states of India, during lockdown and
[12][19]
unlock phases.
We found that, (1) while
remained deflected from the true incidence,
captured the variations in line with the real-time trend of incidence recorded in the states during the
phases. (2)
estimates were lagging from the
values and delayed in the measuring transmission
events that occurred days ago. (3)
misestimated the transmission rate at beginning of the times
while
estimations remained credible near the threshold value which is a crucial region to assess the
implemented policies.
Since a reliable model is vital for the assessment of the effectiveness of intervention to contain an
outbreak, through this work we highly recommend for the implementation of a fine tuned
estimate
over
to retrospectively monitor the effectiveness of the interventions. However, we also emphasize
not to overlook the underlying assumptions made which could invalidate the
estimation and deliver

misleading conclusions if not corroborated properly. For instance, in COVID-19 infection, the serial
interval distribution might vary from the generation time distribution as the infector can infect the
infectee prior to the symptom’s onset, thus indicating a negative value for the serial interval [8]. We
hope this work would facilitate an improved assessment modelling for the COIVID-19 outbreak for the
optimization and designing of effective interventions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
