Chest Computed Tomography Findings in Asymptomatic Patients with COVID-19

Abstract
Background: Little is known about the damage to the respiratory system in asymptomatic
patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Objective: Herein, we evaluated the findings of chest computed tomography (CT) and
radiography in patients with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic.
Methods: We retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19
but who did not show any symptoms. Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were
hospitalized, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Their chest CT and radiographic findings were
analyzed.
Results: In the results, all patients (100%) had ground glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT.
Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all
patients. In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity. Airbronchogram due to bronchiolectasis surrounded by GGO was observed in 8 patients (80%).
Additionally, the lung lesions were dominant on the right side in all patients.
Conclusions: In conclusion, considering our results that the lung is affected in asymptomatic
patients, it will be necessary to extend the indications of COVID-19 testing for effective
management of COVID-19 during the pandemic.

Introduction
In December 2019, an outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan,
China, and the disease subsequently spread to approximately 200 countries within 3
months.[1, 2] This disease causes massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory
failure, with 2-6% of COVID-19 cases leading to mortality.[3] The fatality rate is higher in
older individuals and individuals having underlying diseases. Because COVID-19 is highly
infectious, individuals who come in close contact with COVID-19 patients and those who
have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 are placed in isolation to prevent secondary and
tertiary infections. Typical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, sputum, chest pain,
and muscle soreness. However, approximately 1-5% of patients with COVID-19 are reported
to be asymptomatic.[4-6] Asymptomatic COVID-19 patients are likely not to be tested and
will remain unaware of the fact that they have infection. Therefore, asymptomatic patients
with COVID-19 can be a source for the spread. Moreover, if asymptomatic patients are left
untreated, then damage to the respiratory system may occur. However, little is known about
the damage to the respiratory system in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Therefore, in the
current study, we evaluated the findings of chest computed tomography (CT) and radiography
in patients with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic.

Methods
Patients
This is a retrospective study. Of 139 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to our
university hospital (a 930-bed, tertiary referral hospital) between February 18, 2020, and
April 11, 2020, we selected patients with confirmed COVID-19 who did not show any

symptoms of COVID-19 at the initial diagnosis and during the treatment period. All included
patients had their diagnosis confirmed through RT-PCR (Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay,
Seegene®, South Korea) with a pharyngeal swab at our hospital.
In all patients who were investigated in this study, chest CT and radiography were
performed as a standard process during admission to our hospital. This study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of a University Hospital.

Chest CT Protocol
All images were obtained using a CT system (Siemens Healthineers, Germany) with
patients in the supine position. The main scanning parameters were as follows: tube voltage =
120 kVp, automatic tube current modulation (30–70 mAs), pitch = 0.99–1.22 mm, matrix =
512 × 512, slice thickness = 10 mm, and field of view = 350 mm × 350 mm. All images were
then reconstructed with a slice thickness of 0.625–1.250 mm with the same increment.[7]

Qualitative image analysis
One radiologist (WL), with 25 years of experience, checked and confirmed the radiologic
findings. We reviewed the initial chest CT images and radiographies taken on admission for
each patient. We checked the CT findings for the same parameters as those mentioned in the
previously reported cases: number of affected lobes, presence of GGO, consolidation, halo or
reversed halo signs, crazy paving pattern, air-bronchogram manifested as bronchiolectasis
surrounded by GGO, reticular opacity suggesting interstitial thickening or fibrosis, subpleural
line, and other combined pathologies including lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion.[7]

Results
Patients’ characteristics
Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized, 10 (7.2%) were
asymptomatic. Their mean age was 65 ± 12.8 years (age range: 52-95 years) and the sex ratio
was 6:4 (male:female)(Table 1). Five patients (50%) underwent tests for COVID-19 because
they had a contact history or possibility of contact with COVID-19 patients, and 2 patients
(20%) had COVID-19 tests as a routine laboratory test on admission for treating other
underlying disorders. The other 3 patients (30%) received COVID-19 tests as a routine
laboratory test before a surgical operation. Our patients were treated with either
hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Oxiklorine®; 400 mg qd per day) alone or a combination of
hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Oxiklorine®; 400 mg) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg
bid per day; Kaletra®). All 10 patients were admitted for at least 2 weeks, and did not show
any symptoms of COVID-19 until they were discharged to home after cured.

Findings of Computed Tomography
The findings of chest CT and radiography in each patient are summarized in Table 1.
Representative CT and radiographic images of each patient are presented in Figure 1. In the
10 asymptomatic patients, the mean number of affected lobes was 2.4 ± 1.3. Three (30%)
patients had 1 affected lobe, 2 (20%) patients had 2 affected lobes, 4 (40%) patients had 3
affected lobes, while 1 (10%) patient had 5 affected lobes.
Regarding chest CT findings, in all 10 asymptomatic patients, findings of consolidation and

halo or reversed halo signs were not observed. All patients (100%) showed GGO on chest CT.
Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all
patients. The GGO lesions of 9 (90%) patients were combined with reticular opacity of
intralobular septal thickening, and air-bronchogram due to bronchiolectasis surrounded by
GGO was observed in 8 patients (80%). A definite crazy paving pattern appeared in only 1
patient (10%). Three patients (30%) showed subpleural lines. Additionally, the lung lesions
were dominant on the right side in all patients (Table 2).

Findings of Chest Radiographs
On chest radiographs, 1 patient (10%) had subtle GGO. The other 9 patients’ radiographs
revealed no specific abnormal findings.

Discussion
Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized, 10 (7.2%) were
asymptomatic. In previous reports, 4%–25% of people testing positive for COVID-19 were
reported to be asymptomatic.[8-10] The widely heterogeneous percentage of asymptomatic
patients in previous studies may be due to different support systems for the cost of COVID19 testing and different policies on screening in each country.
In the results of this study, unlike chest radiography, where only 10% were positive, all
asymptomatic patients showed abnormal findings on their CT scans. Considering these falsenegative results of chest radiography, CT scans must be recommended to confirm lung
involvement in asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. In previous studies, 83.9–88.7% of

symptomatic COVID-19 patients showed abnormal CT findings.[10-12] In this study,
however, all patients showed abnormal CT findings despite no symptoms. Our results may be
due to the fact that we did not check the chest CT immediately after diagnosis but a few days
later after confirmation of COVID-19 (7.8 ± 5.6 days). We hypothesize that the
SARS CoV 2 was not allowed enough time to damage the patients’ lung in previous
studies.
In this study, the CT scans showed increasing involvement of the peripheral and posterior
distributions in asymptomatic patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with the CT
findings of a previous study in symptomatic patients with COVID-19.[10, 11] Zhou et al. [10]
reported that lesions had a characteristic multifocal distribution in the middle and lower lung
regions and in the posterior lung area as noted in the CT scan of symptomatic patients with
COVID-19. Guan et al. [11] reported that more than 70% of CT scans in symptomatic
patients with COVID-19 showed lesions in the lower lobe. In all our patients, the right lung
was predominantly involved. This finding was also consistent with that reported in a previous
study.[10] Zhou et al. [10] reported that, of the 10 patients with a single lesion, 9 (90.0%) had
lesions that were initially located in the right lung; and one (10.0%) had a lesion in the left
lung. These results may be due to the innate anatomic features of the right inferior lobar
bronchus. The bronchus of the right lower lobe of the lung is steeper and straighter than the
left bronchial branches, and the angle between the right lower lobe and the long axis of the
trachea is smaller; hence, in the early phase of COVID-19, the virus is more likely to invade
the branches of the right inferior lobar bronchus and cause infection. [10]
Regarding the change in CT findings according to the progression of COVID-19, Zhou et al.
[10] showed the differences between abnormal CT findings in the early phase (≤7 days after
symptom onset) and those in the advanced phase (8–14 days after symptom onset) of

COVID-19 in 62 patients with COVID-19. In their study, they observed many GGO findings
in the early phase (47.5% vs. 27.3%) and then an increase in GGO with reticular opacity
(50.0% vs. 86.4%) and air-bronchogram (62.5% vs. 90.9%) in the advanced phase (4).
Considering these results, in our study, the incidence rate of GGOs with reticular opacity and
air-bronchograms was 90% and 80%, respectively; accordingly, CT patterns were somewhat
similar to those in the advanced stage despite being asymptomatic.
Our study has shown that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients also suffer significant lung
damage. Although the prognosis of untreated patients with COVID-19 has not been reported,
our results show that active screening may be necessary to detect asymptomatic patients with
COVID-19 and manage them appropriately. Our study is the first to analyze the CT findings
of asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. However, the present study has two limitations.
First, changes in CT over the course of COVID-19 pneumonia have not been fully tracked
and described for all patients. Second, we recruited a relatively small number of subjects. In
the future, further studies to compensate for our limitations are required.
