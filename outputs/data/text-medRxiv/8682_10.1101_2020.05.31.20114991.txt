ABSTRACT

Background
Respiratory failure is a key feature of severe Covid-19 and a critical driver of mortality, but
for reasons poorly defined affects less than 10% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

Methods
We included 1,980 patients with Covid-19 respiratory failure at seven centers in the Italian
and Spanish epicenters of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe (Milan, Monza, Madrid, San
Sebastian and Barcelona) for a genome-wide association analysis. After quality control and
exclusion of population outliers, 835 patients and 1,255 population-derived controls from
Italy, and 775 patients and 950 controls from Spain were included in the final analysis. In
total we analyzed 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and conducted a metaanalysis of both case-control panels.

Results
We detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at chromosome 3p21.31 and
rs657152 at 9q34, which were genome-wide significant (P<5×10-8) in the meta-analysis of
both study panels, odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 2.11;
P=1.14×10-10 and OR 1.32 (95% CI, 1.20 to 1.47; P=4.95×10-8), respectively. Among six
genes at 3p21.31, SLC6A20 encodes a known interaction partner with angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2). The association signal at 9q34 was located at the ABO blood group locus
and a blood-group-specific analysis showed higher risk for A-positive individuals (OR=1.45,
95% CI, 1.20 to 1.75, P=1.48×10-4) and a protective effect for blood group O (OR=0.65, 95%
CI, 0.53 to 0.79, P=1.06×10-5).

Conclusions
We herein report the first robust genetic susceptibility loci for the development of respiratory
failure in Covid-19. Identified variants may help guide targeted exploration of severe Covid19 pathophysiology.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in Wuhan in
China late 2019 and rapidly evolved into a global pandemic.1 As of May 28th 2020, there are
over 5.1 million confirmed cases worldwide, with total deaths exceeding 355,000 (access
John Hopkins). In Europe, Italy and Spain were early severely affected with epidemic peaks
starting in the second half of February 2020 (Figure 1) with 60,189 fatal cases reported by
May 28th 2020. Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has variable behavior,2 with the vast
majority of infected individuals experiencing only mild or even no symptoms.3 Mortality rates
are predominantly driven by the subset of patients developing severe respiratory failure
secondary to bilateral interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.4 Severe
Covid-19 with respiratory failure requires early and prolonged support by mechanical
ventilation.5

The pathogenesis of respiratory failure in Covid-19 is poorly understood, but mortality
consistently associates with older age and male gender.6-8 Clinical associations have also been
reported for obesity and cardiovascular disease traits, hypertension and diabetes in particular,
but the relative role of these risk factors in determining Covid-19 severity has not yet been
clarified.6-9 Observations on lymphocytic endothelitis and diffuse microvascular and
macrovascular thromboembolic complications may suggest that Covid-19 is a systemic
disease that primarily injures the vascular endothelium, but provide mostly hypothetical
insights to the underlying pathogenesis in severe Covid-19.10-12 On this background, at the
peak of the epidemic in Italy and Spain, we performed a genome-wide association study
(GWAS) to possibly delineate host genetic factors contributing to respiratory failure in Covid19. The relatively low Covid-19 disease burden in Norway and Germany allowed for a
complementary team to be set up, whereby rapid analysis could occur in parallel with rapid
patient recruitment in the affected Italian and Spanish epicenters.

Materials and methods
Study subjects / recruitment
We recruited in total 1,980 patients with severe Covid-19 infection defined by hospitalization
with respiratory failure and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 viral replication from nasopharyngeal
swabs or other relevant biological fluids cross-sectionally from intensive care units and
general wards of seven hospitals in five cities in the pandemic epicenters in Italy and Spain
(Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1A); Fondazione IRCCS Cá Granda Ospedale Maggiore
Policlinico, Milan (n=597), Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, IRCCS, Milan (n=154),
San Gerardo Hospital School of Medicine, Monza (n=200), At Hospital Clínic and IDIBAPS,
Barcelona (n=56), Hospital Universitario Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona (n=337), Hospital
Universitario Ramón y Cajal, Madrid (n=298), Donostia University Hospital, San Sebastian
(n=338). Respiratory failure was defined in the simplest possible manner, to ensure
feasibility, by requirement of oxygen supplementation or mechanical ventilation, with the
severity graded according to maximum respiratory support up until time of blood sampling
(oxygen therapy only, non-invasive ventilatory support, invasive ventilatory support,
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Severity was also binarized to no mechanical
oxygenation vs. mechanical oxygenation for severity assessments. Whole blood or buffy coats
from diagnostic venipuncture were collected for DNA extraction.

For comparison, we included a total of 2,381 controls from Italy and Spain (Supplementary
Table 1B). We recruited 998 randomly selected blood donors at Fondazione IRCCS Cá
Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan with no evidence of Covid-19 who were
genotyped for the purpose of the present study. We also included two control panels with
genotype data derived from previous studies using the same genotyping array; from Italy

n=396 controls from reference13 and from Spain n=987 controls recruited from blood donors
(San Sebastian).

Ethical approval
The project protocol outlined a rapid patient inclusion with principally no additional projectrelated procedures (material from clinically indicated venipunctures) and with the opportunity
of complete anonymity with only minimal data collected. Differences in recruitment and
consent procedures between centers were determined by 1) some centers integrating the
project in larger Covid-19 biobanking efforts and others doing dedicated inclusion for this
project and 2) variability regarding the local ethical committee handling of anonymization vs.
deidentification as well as consent procedures. Written informed consent was obtained from
all study subjects at each center when possible, alternatively exempt as defined by delayed
consent, oral consent or consent via next of kin was collected depending on local ethical
committee regulations. For some severely ill patients, where this was not possible, an
exemption from informed consent was obtained by the local ethical committee or per local
regulations during the Covid-19 pandemic to allow the use of completely anonymized surplus
material from diagnostic venipuncture.

The following ethical approvals of the project were obtained from the relevant ethics
committees: Germany: Kiel (reference number D464/20); Italy: Fondazione IRCCS Cá
Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico (reference number 342_2020 and 334-2020 for cases
and controls, respectively), Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, IRCCS (reference

and Donostia University Hospital, San Sebastian (reference number PI2020064).

Sample processing, genotyping and imputation
We performed DNA extraction from all 1,980 cases and 1,394 Italian controls using a
Chemagic 360 from PerkinElmer (Waltham, Massachusetts, U.S.) using the low volume kit
cmg 1491 and the Buffy coat kit cmg-714 (Chemagen, Baesweiler, Germany), respectively.
For genotyping, we used the Illumina’s Global Screening Array (GSA) version 2.0 (GSA
v2.0; Illumina Inc., San Diego, USA) that contains 712,189 variants before quality control
(QC). Details on genotyping and QC procedures can be found in the Supplementary
Methods. To maximize genetic coverage, we performed single nucleotide (SNP) imputation
on genome build GRCh38 using the Michigan Imputation Server and 194,512 haplotypes
generated by the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program (Freeze 5).14 After
excluding samples during QC (the majority of which were due to population outliers, see
Supplementary Methods and Table 1B) the final case-control datasets comprised 835
patients and 1,255 population derived controls from Italy, and 775 patients and 950 controls
from Spain, with a total of 8,965,091 SNPs included for the Italian cohort and 9,140,716
SNPs for the Spanish cohort.

Statistical methods
To take imputation uncertainty into account, we tested for phenotypic associations with allele
dosage data separately for both Italian and Spanish case-control panels through the use of
PLINK’s logistic regression framework for dosage data (PLINK v1.9).15 Two adjusted

association analyses including covariates from principal component analysis (PCA) were
conducted (analysis I and II) to control for (I) potential population stratification as well as (II)
potential population stratification as well as age and gender bias. A fixed-effects metaanalysis was conducted using the meta-analysis tool METAL16 on variants overlapping
between both studies using the BETA and its standard error (SE) from the study specific
association analyses. We used the commonly accepted threshold of 5 × 10-8 for joint P-values
to define statistical significance.

Based on results from TOPMed genotype imputation, we utilized three ABO SNPs
(rs8176747, rs41302905 and rs8176719)17,18 to infer ABO blood type and calculated blood
group specific odds ratios according to A vs. B/AB/O, B vs. A/AB/O, AB vs. A/B/O and O
vs. A/AB/B (see Supplementary Methods). To assess in detail the HLA complex at 6p21, at
which we found no genome-wide significant associations in the main analysis, we performed
sequencing-based HLA typing of 7 HLA loci (HLA-A, -C, -B, -DRB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, DPB1) in the subset of 916 cases from Italy and 1,087 cases from Spain (see Supplementary
Methods), and assessed allelic distribution according to no mechanical ventilation (oxygen
supplementation only) vs. mechanical ventilation any type (Table 1). A similar assessment
was made for lead SNPs rs11385942 and rs657152, and at these broader loci (3p21.31 and
9q34.2) we also performed Bayesian fine-mapping analysis (see Supplementary Methods).

Results
The milestones of the study in the context of the peak outbreaks in Italy and Spain are shown
in Figure 1. Age, gender and maximum respiratory support up until time of blood sampling
for patients included in the final analysis are given in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1.
By utilizing GSA-only data, we were able to perform a uniform quality control of merged
Italian and Spanish batches, thus reducing potential batch effects, and conducted Italian and
Spanish association analyses (see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figure 2
and 3). Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot of the two meta-analyses of Spanish and Italian
association results revealed significant associations in the tail of the distribution with minimal
genomic inflation (λGC=1.015 and λGC=1.006, respectively; Supplementary Figure 4).

We found two loci to be associated with Covid-19 induced respiratory failure with genomewide significance (P<5×10-8) in the meta-analysis (analysis I) (Figure 2 and Table 2), the
rs11385942 insertion-deletion GA/A SNP at chromosome 3p21.31, ORmeta 1.77 (95% CI,
1.48 to 2.11), P=1.14×10-10 and the rs657152 A/C SNP at 9q34.2, ORmeta 1.32 (95% CI, 1.20
to 1.47), P=4.95×10-8. Both loci showed nominally significant association in both the Spanish
and Italian sub-analysis (Table 2). Manual inspection of genotype cluster plots of genotyped
SNPs in associated regions showed distinct genotype clouds for homozygous and
heterozygous calls. Furthermore, an age and gender corrected analysis (analysis II)
corroborated observations at both rs11385942 ORmeta 2.11 (95% CI, 1.70 to 2.61), P=9.46×1012

and rs657152 ORmeta 1.39 (95% CI, 1.22 to 1.59), P=5.35×10-7 (Table 2; Supplementary

Figure 5). A further 24 genomic loci showed suggestive evidence (P<1×10-5) for association
with Covid-19 induced respiratory failure in analysis I (Supplementary Table 2;
Supplementary Figure 6).

Association signals at 3p21.31 and 9q34.2 were fine-mapped to 22 and 38 variants,
respectively, with greater than 95% certainty (Figure 3A and 3B and Supplementary Table

found that the frequency of the risk allele GA of the lead SNP, rs11385942, was higher in
patients with mechanical ventilation compared with those receiving oxygen supplementation
only with an OR=1.70, 95% CI, 1.27 to 2.26, P=0.00033, in the unadjusted analysis
(Supplementary Table 4). Available database entries suggest that the frequency of the risk
allele of rs11385942 varies between populations world-wide and is monomorphic in China
(Supplementary Figure 7).

At 9q34.2 the association signal was restricted to the ABO blood group gene (Figure 3B and
Supplementary Figure 8). Accordingly, the distribution of ABO blood groups, as predicted
from combinations of genotypes of three different SNPs was skewed in Covid-19 patients
with respiratory failure compared with controls (Supplementary Table 5), with higher risk
for A-positive individuals (meta-analysis result OR=1.45, 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.75, P=1.48×10-4)
and a protective effect for blood group O (meta-analysis result: OR=0.65, 95% CI, 0.53 to
0.79, P=1.06×10-5; see Supplementary Table 5 for details). Both associations and effect
directions were consistent in the separate Spain-only and Italian-only case-control analysis
(see Supplementary Table 5). We found no difference in blood group distribution between
patients receiving oxygen supplementation only vs. mechanical ventilation of any kind
(Supplementary Table 5).

Since several viral infections are known to be controlled by genetic variation at the HLA
complex at chromosome 6p21, we scrutinized the extended HLA region (chr6:25-34Mb;
Supplementary Figure 9). There were no SNP or allele associations signals at the HLA

Discussion
Using a pragmatic approach with simplified inclusion criteria and a complementary team of
clinicians at the European Covid-19 epicenters in Italy and Spain and available German and
Norwegian scientists, we were able to perform a complete GWAS for Covid-19 respiratory failure
in about two months. We detected cross-replicating findings at chromosome 3 and chromosome 9,
which achieved genome-wide significance in meta-analysis of both study panels.

On chromosome 3p21 the peak association signal covers a cluster of several genes with potentially
relevant functions to severe Covid-19. One notable candidate is SLC6A20, which encodes the
Sodium/Imino-acid (proline) Transporter 1 (SIT1) that functionally interacts with angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (ACE), the SARS-CoV-2 cell surface receptor.19,20 SIT1 expression in the
lungs is mainly present in pneumocytes 21, where SIT1 should be scrutinized for involvement in
SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. However, the relevant locus also contains a cluster of genes encoding
chemokine receptors, including the CC-motif chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9) and the C-X-C motif
chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), the latter have been shown to regulate the partitioning of lungresident memory CD8 T-cells throughout the sustained immune response to airway pathogens,
including influenza viruses.22 In the publicly available results from the Covid-19 Host Genetics
Consortium23, a similar association has been observed in an analysis of Covid-19 affected cases vs.
a population based sample, however not at genome-wide significant levels, still corroborating our
observations. These parallel observations with our analysis, which focused on severe cases with
pulmonary failure only, points to the relevance of ascertainment bias in genetic studies of Covid-19,
as clinically significant Covid-19 patients are more likely to be included in research projects than
asymptomatic cases. The significantly higher frequency of the risk allele at the chromosome 3 locus
found in the present study in patients requiring mechanical ventilation compared with oxygen only,
provides further support to a role for this genetic region in modifying Covid-19 severity.

Preliminary clinical reports have suggested the involvement of ABO blood groups in Covid-19
susceptibility (preprints by Zhao et al.24 and Zietz et al.25). Similar reflections can thus be made for
case ascertainment as for the chromosome 3 locus, and ABO blood groups have also been
implicated in SARS-CoV-1 susceptibility.26 Our data thus aligns with the suggestions that blood
group O is associated with lower risk compared with non-O blood groups whereas blood group A is
associated with higher risk of acquiring Covid-19 compared with non-A blood groups.24,25 Unlike
for Chromosome 3, we found no difference between patients receiving oxygen supplementation
only and those with mechanical ventilation any kind.25 However, it should be noted that the lead
SNP at the ABO locus in our study (rs657152) has been associated with elevated interleukin-6 (IL6) levels in childhood obesity in previous GWAS27, providing a hypothetical link to the established
association of elevated IL-6 with severity and mortality of Covid-19.28 Furthermore, genetic
variation at the ABO locus has previously been associated with a number of procoagulant markers
such as von Willebrand factor and Factor VIII, and the potential relationship between our genetic
findings and the significant coagulopathy that is observed in severe Covid-19 warrants further
attention.

We are fully aware that the pragmatic aspects leading to feasibility of this massive undertaking in a
very short period of time during extreme clinical circumstances of the pandemic led to certain
limitations that will be important to explore in follow-up studies. For example, to enable
recruitment of study participants, a bare minimum of clinical metadata was requested. For this
reason, extensive genotype-phenotype elaboration of current findings could not be performed, and
adjustments for all potential sources of bias (e.g. underlying cardiovascular and metabolic factors
relevant to Covid-19) could not be done. Furthermore, the alignment of our findings with
preliminary reports assessing Covid-19 susceptibility should lead to a critical debate as to
phenotype definitions for cases and controls in genetic studies of Covid-19. Also, few restrictions
during inclusion were made, leading to genotyped samples having to be excluded due to differing

ethnicities (genetically population outliers). That said, we took great care to minimize variability
between cases and controls arising from such sources, and that could have been introduced from
differences between genotyping platforms29, e.g. limiting our inclusion of controls to those
genotyped on the Illumina Global Screening Array, despite thus reducing our statistical power.

Further exploration of current findings, both as to their utility in clinical risk profiling of Covid-19
patients and mechanistic understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, is now warranted.

Figure 1. Timeline of rapid Covid-19 genome-wide association study (GWAS). The main events
and milestones of the study are summarized in the plot along time (x-axis, weeks (W) are noted).
Patient samples from three Italian and four Spanish hospitals were collected around the peak of the
local epidemics and ethics applications were quickly obtained through fast-track procedures, i.e.
every local ethical review board supported Covid-19 studies by rapid turn-around times, facilitating
this fast de novo data generation. Within 6 weeks, all collected blood samples were centrally
isolated, genotyped and analysed. The rapid workflow from patients to target identification
illustrates the utility of GWAS, a standardized tool in research that often relies on international and
interdisciplinary cooperation. One centre alone could not have completed this study, not mentioning
the increase in statistical power through multi-centre patient contribution. Speed of data production
depended heavily on lab automation and speed of analyses reflect existing analytical pipelines and
generous support of public so-called “imputation servers” (here, the Michigan imputation server of
the Abecasis group).

Figure 3. Regional association plots of susceptibility loci associated with severe Covid-19 with
respiratory failure. Bayesian fine-mapping analysis (see Methods) prioritized 22 and 38 variants
for loci 3p21.31 and 9q34.2, respectively, with greater than 95% certainty. LD values were
calculated based on genotypes of the merged Italian/Spanish dataset derived from TOPMed
imputation (see Methods). hg38 positions are plotted.
