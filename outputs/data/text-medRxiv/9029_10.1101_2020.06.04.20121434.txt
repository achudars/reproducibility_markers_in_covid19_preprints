Abstract
By mid-May, cases of COVID-19 in the UK had been declining for over a month; a multi-phase
emergence from lockdown was planned, including a scheduled partial reopening of schools on 1st June.
Although evidence suggests that children generally display mild symptoms, the size of the school-age
population means the total impact of reopening schools is unclear. Here, we present work from midMay that focused on the imminent opening of schools and consider what these results imply for future
policy.
We compared eight strategies for reopening primary and secondary schools in England. Modifying a
transmission model fitted to UK SARS-CoV-2 data, we assessed how reopening schools affects contact
patterns, anticipated secondary infections and the relative change in the reproduction number, R.
We determined the associated public health impact and its sensitivity to changes in social-distancing
within the wider community.
We predicted reopening schools with half-sized classes or focused on younger children was unlikely
to push R above one. Older children generally have more social contacts, so reopening secondary
schools results in more cases than reopening primary schools, while reopening both could have pushed
R above one in some regions. Reductions in community social-distancing were found to outweigh and
exacerbate any impacts of reopening. In particular, opening schools when the reproduction number
R is already above one generates the largest increase in cases.
Our work indicates that while any school reopening will result in increased mixing and infection
amongst children and the wider population, reopening schools alone in June was unlikely to push
R above one. Ultimately, reopening decisions are a difficult trade-off between epidemiological consequences and the emotional, educational and developmental needs of children. Into the future, there
are difficult questions about what controls can be instigated such that schools can remain open if cases
increase.

Introduction

1

The emergence of a novel strain of coronavirus, now named SARS-CoV-2, in Wuhan city, China, in
late 2019, has resulted in a global pandemic that spread to every region in the world. When the SARSCoV-2 virus infects humans it can result in COVID-19 disease, with symptoms including a fever, a
continuous dry cough, a shortness of breath and a loss of sense of taste and smell [1]. In severe cases,
the symptoms can require hospitalisation and admission to intensive care, with ventilation required in
the most severe cases in order to assist with breathing.
As the number of confirmed cases increased both nationally and globally, there was a concern that
hospital and intensive care capacities would be rapidly overwhelmed without the introduction of interventions to curb the spread of infection. With this in mind, many countries introduced a range of
social distancing measures, such as the closing of workplaces, pubs and restaurants, the restriction of
leisure activities and the closing of schools. In the UK, the introduction of many of these measures
was announced during the week of 16th March, with schools, along with the hospitality sector, closing
on Friday 20th March. Full lockdown measures were subsequently introduced three days later, on the
evening of Monday 23rd March. When we completed this work in late May, over 270, 000 people in
the UK had been confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19, with over 37, 500 confirmed deaths
of individuals who had tested positive for infection.
The decision to close schools is a balance between the risk associated with transmission in the school
environment and the educational and welfare impact upon children of shutting down education establishments. Evidence from a range of sources suggests that children are, in general, only mildly
affected by the disease and have low mortality rates [2, 3]. This is reflected in the fact that by 27th
May 2020 there had been 26, 235 COVID-19 associated deaths in hospitals in England, but only 16
of those were in the 0-19 year age group [4]. In a retrospective study of 2, 135 paediatric COVID-19
cases in China [5], 89.7% of children had mild or moderate disease while 5.8% were severe or critical;
similarly low levels of severe disease are reported in other regions [3, 6]. The health risks of school
attendance for any individual child is therefore thought to be low.
However, there is less certainty regarding children’s role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [7, 8].
This can be broken down into two key questions: (i) how likely are children to become infected, and
(ii) once infected, are children likely to transmit infection?
A meta-analysis concluded that children and young people under the age of 20 may be less likely to
become infected: the odds ratio for becoming infected upon contact with an index case compared to
adults (> 20 years old) is 0.44 (CI 0.29, 0.69) [7]. This conclusion is based on pooling the results of
contact tracing and population-screening studies, most of which find evidence that the attack rate in
children may be lower than in adults [9, 10], but one does not (Bi et al. [11]). All contact tracing
studies are hampered by the problem that symptom-based surveillance is likely to systematically under
detect cases in children [11]. Seroprevalence surveys so far do not find any significant effect of age on
the probability of possessing antibodies against COVID-19, although those under the age of five are
not always included in surveys [12–14]. Two cross sectional PCR studies hint at lower susceptibility
in children, since they found no SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive children under the age of 10 [15, 16], but
a PCR-based survey by the UK Office for National Statistics found no difference in the probability of
infection between age classes [17]. Further, large-scale seroprevalence studies which fully sample all
age groups will be necessary to fully resolve these questions. Overall the balance of evidence cautiously
suggests that children may have a lower inherent susceptibility. If it exists, such lower susceptibility
could be physiological [18] or could be due to cross reactive immune responses from other childhood
infections, with cross-protection between other human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 hinted at by
recent studies [19, 20].

There is little evidence from contact tracing and clinical investigations about the relative infectiousness
of children. Children hospitalised with COVID-19 readily shed the virus above the likely transmission
threshold [21–23], with detection of virus in nasopharyngeal (nasal) swabs, oropharyngeal (throat)
swabs, sputum, or faeces [24, 25]. However, in their review of contact tracing and population-screening
studies, Viner et al. [7] found just one relevant study comparing infectiousness by age: Zhu et al. [26],
which shows that children make up a low proportion of index cases in households. As pointed out by
Viner et al., this particular result could be explained by children being less likely to get infected in
the first place rather than children being less infectious once they have actually contracted the virus.
There is also evidence suggesting that mild cases in adults could be less infectious than severe or
critical cases [10], but it remains unknown whether this result extends to asymptomatic or mild cases
in children. Thus, children with severe symptoms are likely infectious, but it is harder to determine
how transmissible the virus may be from children with few or no symptoms.
As of May 2020, we were aware of three reported studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the school
environment. A retrospective serology study of 661 individuals with links to a school-based outbreak in
Oise, France, showed that the infection spread readily within and outside the school to reach students,
teachers, staff, and families [27]. In contrast, an Australian government study of cases in schools in
Western Australia [28] identified nine children and nine adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2
(located across different schools), but found only two secondary cases when testing a third of the
close contacts of these cases (288 samples). In Ireland, six SARS-CoV-2 cases were identified who
had attended or taught in schools. None of 924 school related child contacts or 101 school related
adult contacts showed any symptoms, but asymptomatic cases could have been missed [29]. The
Australian school cases were identified between 5th March and 3rd April, and the first Irish school
case was identified at the beginning of March. The first Oise school cases, by contrast, were identified
on the 2nd February 2020. The greater awareness of COVID-19 by March, during which the WHO
declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic, likely helped to control the Australian and Irish school-based
outbreaks sooner than in Oise.
In the UK, during late May 2020, cases of COVID-19 were declining and there was strong evidence to
suggest that the effective reproduction number (R) had dropped below 1 across the country. A multiphase relaxation plan for the country to emerge from lockdown began on 13th May, with a greater
emphasis on returning to work if practical. We present here research formulated to address policy
questions in May, to help inform the expected impact of various groups returning to the classroom.
In particular, we investigate the epidemiological impacts of reopening schools in England, focusing
on different combinations of year groups. We extend a previously developed dynamic transmission
model for SARS-CoV-2, which is fit (on a regional basis for the UK) to real-time data on confirmed
cases requiring hospital care and mortality. We compare and contrast multiple possible strategies for
reopening both primary and secondary schools, focusing upon determining the effect of given year
groups returning to school upon future epidemic behaviour. By elucidating the risks associated with
particular age groups returning to school, we seek to contribute to the evidence base on the likely
role of schools in the containment and control of this outbreak. Unlike other modelling studies [30],
we decouple school reopening from other measures (such as a greater return to work); we feel this
generates a clearer picture of the roles of school children and adults [31].
In England, primary schools partially reopened on 1st June: reception, year 1 and year 6 children
initially returned, with an emphasis on maintaining social distancing measures where possible. In
September (August in Scotland), the majority of schools reopened with generally high levels of attendance. We therefore discuss the implications for this work both in terms of the likely effects of schools
on the unfolding epidemic and their role in any future imposition of additional control measures.

Methods

93

Transmission model

94

In order to perform the analysis of school reopening, we extended a previously-developed deterministic, age-structured compartmental SARS-CoV-2 transmission model [32]. The model was matched to
a variety of data sources including hospitalisations, ICU occupancy and deaths, while age-dependent
parameters were scaled to achieve agreement with the early age-distributions [33]. We stratified the
population according to current disease status, following a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered
(SEIR) paradigm (Fig. 1). We assumed the latent period to be Erlang distributed, modelled within
the compartmental framework via division of the latent state into three stages. Infectious cases were
partitioned by presence of symptoms, meaning we tracked symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals
separately. Additional layers of complexity included differentiating by isolation and household status.
We provide a listing of model parameters in Table 1, with a description of the model equations given
in Supporting Text S1. We use the predicted number of symptomatic individuals to estimate the
number of hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths, by estimating the proportion of symptomatic individuals requiring hospitalisation, ICU admission and the proportion that eventually die,
and the distribution of times through each of these states. For hospital admissions and cases requiring
treatment in ICU, the proportions going through each state and the distribution of times taken were
drawn from the COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System (CHESS) data set that
collects detailed data on patients infected with COVID-19 [34]. The risk of death was also captured
with an age-dependent probability, while the distribution of delays between hospital admission and
death was assumed to be age-independent, with both these two quantities determined from the Public
Health England (PHE) death records.
With the inclusion of age-structure, transmission was governed through age-dependent mixing matrices, based on UK social mixing patterns [35, 36], scaled by an age-dependent susceptibility that
was determined to produce the early age-distribution of symptomatic cases. To capture the effects of
social distancing measures that were introduced in the UK to reduce transmission, we scaled down
the mixing matrices associated with schools, work and other activities while increasing the within
household transmission matrix (see Supporting Text S2).
In a refinement to the base model, we imposed an amended age-stratification of the population. Whilst
in previous work the population was stratified into five year age brackets, for this study we separated
those aged between 0 and 19 years old into single year cohorts, with the remainder of the population
stratified into five year age brackets as before (20-24yrs, 25-29yrs and so on). The final age category
corresponded to those aged 100 years or above. This fine-scale structure for those younger than 20 is
important to be able to capture different policy questions; however resolution at a single year of age is
not captured within the mixing matrices [35, 36]. We therefore generally retain the mixing structure
based on five year age groups (Fig. 2), but assume that 70% of mixing within the same five year age
group comes from interactions within the same school year.

We used this model framework to evaluate eight strategies for reopening schools from 1st June. The
eight school reopening options we considered assumed that, from the 1st June, the following school
year groups would return to school:
(i) reception (year 0), year 1 and year 6 (full class sizes);
(ii) reception, year 1 and year 6 (half class sizes);
(iii) all primary schools;
(iv) reception, years 1, 6, 10 and 12 (full class sizes);

(vi) primary schools plus year groups 10 and 12;
(vii) all secondary schools;
(viii) all schools.
For clarity, in all the strategies considered here we assumed that children of key workers continued to
attend school at the currently observed level.
We assessed the school reopening scenarios at a regional scale, modelling the population of England
aggregated to seven regions (East of England, London, Midlands, North East and Yorkshire, North
West England, South East England, South West England). This involved the use of region-specific
posterior parameters obtained in our prior work, where we fit our base transmission model on a regionby-region basis, using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) fitting scheme, to four timeseries: (i) new
hospitalisations; (ii) hospital bed occupancy; (iii) ICU bed occupancy; (iv) daily deaths (using data on
the recorded date of death, wherever possible) [32]. The inference was performed from epidemiological
data until 12th May 2020.
Our assessment of school reopening strategies comprised of three strands. Firstly, we quantified how
the process of opening schools and year groups affected contact patterns and anticipated secondary
infections. Secondly, we related the scale of school opening to the relative change in R, assuming
the same transmission patterns in the rest of the population as during the strict lockdown phase.
Finally, we gauged the estimated change in clinical case and its sensitivity to changes in community
transmission following the easing of lockdown measures on 13th May. We outline each item in further
detail below.

Contacts and secondary infections

159

Any school reopening plan will inherently alter age-group contact patterns compared to contact structures observed during the lockdown. We attempted to resolve how these alterations in social interactions propagated into the transmission dynamics by tracking secondary infections arising from
symptomatic index cases and infected index cases (either symptomatic or asymptomatic), respectively.
Specific to this aspect of the analysis we focused on a single region, namely the Midlands and the
posterior parameter set with the maximum likelihood. We first assess the contact structure and
transmission under two distinct lockdown assumptions (‘strict closure’ and our default assumption of
‘weaker closure’). The ‘strict closure’ scenario assumed that there was no additional mixing between

school-age groups during the lockdown period. ‘Weaker closure’ assumed there was more limited
adherence, leading to higher mixing between school-age groups compared to the ‘strict closure’ setting.
We also consider six of the eight reopening strategies (omitting those with half class sizes as these are
bounded above by the full-class strategy). For each we show the age-mixing matrix between age-groups;
the transmission matrix from a symptomatic infectious individual; the transmission matrix from an
average infectious individual (recognising the many will be asymptomatic or in household quarantine);
and the expected number of secondary cases an average infectious individual of a particular age-group
will generate.

The reproduction ratio or number (R) has become a universally recognised quantity in the description
of COVID-19 dynamics; it is defined as the average number of secondary cases from an average index
case — where the second average is important as it samples across all infectious states including
asymptomatics and those currently under household isolation. To prevent the occurrence of a second
phase of exponential growth in infection, it is crucial that relaxation of social distancing measures
do not result in the value of R rising above 1. On these grounds, there is interest in predicting the
magnitude of a rise in R that could result from the reopening of schools, and our confidence in this
result.
We considered all eight school reopening scenarios and examined the increase in R per region under
each of the eight strategies. To compute R, we used the contact matrices associated with the given
choice of school reopening and accounting for the regional population structure, whilst assuming the
same level of mixing in the rest of the population as during the strict lockdown; therefore any changes in
R are driven by changes in school-age mixing. We calculated means and intervals from 1000 simulation
replicates with parameter sets sampled from the posterior parameter distributions.

The prior methods focused on the reproduction number R, which is both an instantaneous measure (R
can be calculated at any or every time point) and a long-term calculation (as it utilises an eigenvalue
approach to generate the asymptotic R). Calculation of quantities of public health interest requires
the simulation of the full temporal dynamics from the start of the outbreak to the closing of schools
for the summer holidays on 22nd July. In addition, we considered the sensitivity of reopening schools
to other potential changes in population mixing patterns (and hence different values of R) driven by
other changes to the lockdown since 13th May. These changes to population mixing were generated
by reducing the adherence with lockdown measures, bringing the mixing matrices closer to the prepandemic norm.
We performed these simulations, using the full dynamic model to generate estimates of the symptomatic cases, deaths and ICU admissions between 1st June and 22nd July, for each of the eight
school-opening strategies. We compared these measures, aggregated over this 52-day period, to a
scenario where school closures remain in place beyond the 1st June.
For each reopening strategy and each region, we performed a total of 1000 replicates. In each replicate
we sampled parameter values randomly from all posterior parameter distributions, with the exception
of the adherence level. The potential reduction in adherence values, from 13th May, inevitably generates different R values at the point of school reopening (measured by the observed growth rate of
the outbreak in the model simulation). As a consequence, for comparative purposes we segregated
the estimated increases in epidemiological quantities (comparing different school opening strategies for
fixed underlying parameters) into three categories according to the R value before school reopening:
below 0.8, between 0.8 and 1, or between 1 and 1.2.

Choice of reopening strategy influences contact structure and secondary infection risk

215

We first investigated the impact of alternate strategies for reopening schools upon contact patterns between individuals and the effect of this upon transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and occurrences of COVID19 infection. Our results for the Midlands, and the posterior parameter-set derived in May that
maximises the likelihood (giving R ≈ 0.78), are summarised in Fig. 2. For all scenarios investigated
we observe several common trends. Contacts are most common between individuals of the same,
or similar ages (Fig. 2, first row [36]). There was also greater contact between children and adults
between the ages of 25 and 55, reflecting interactions between children and their parents, as well as
between elderly people [36]. This increased likelihood of contact within and between those age groups
is reflected in the risk of secondary infections occurring (Fig. 2, second and third rows). The second
row accounts for age-dependent susceptiblity, and shows the expected number of secondary infections
in each age (y-axis) from a symptomatic index case of a particular age (x-axis). The third row incorporates the likely state of an index infection (symptomatic, asymptomatic or in household quarantine
- as predicted by the underlying ODEs) thereby reducing the potential transmission from particular
age-groups (Supporting Figure S2).
If schools remain closed, with a high level of adherence to the lockdown within this younger age-group
(Fig. 2, first column) we observe that contact between children, and therefore the risk of secondary
infection occurring, is extremely low. Should adherence to lockdown be weaker (Fig. 2, second column),
we observe a higher rate of mixing between children and a slight increase in risk of secondary infections
occurring. For both of these scenarios the average number of secondary infections per index infection
is below 1 for all age groups and the value of R remains significantly below 1.
We now investigate the impact of various strategies for school reopenings. We first investigate the
scenario of reception, year 1 and year 6 children returning to school – the policy that is scheduled to
be implemented on 1st June in England (Fig. 2, third column). In this scenario, we observe a slight
increase in contacts compared to the “weaker closure” scenario, with increased transmission between
individuals in these age groups. However, crucially, even within these age groups, the total number
of secondary infections per index case remains below one (third column, final row, red bars) and the
overall reproduction number value of R was only observed to have slightly increased from the scenarios
in which schools remain closed. A slight increase in mixing, and hence R, was again observed when
all primary schools are opened (Fig. 2, fourth column), but we predict that R remains below 1.
To conclude this segment of the analysis, we investigated the impact of school reopening strategies
that involved some, or all, secondary school children returning to the classroom. If children from key
years of 10 and 12 return to school (in addition to some or all primary school children), a significant
increase in mixing was observed within those age groups; the number of secondary infections as a
result of index infections in secondary schools was predicted to be above one (Fig. 2, fifth and sixth
columns). However, this expected number of cases is distributed across multiple age-groups thereby
dissipating the worst effects. In general, we found secondary schools to represent a higher risk of
increased transmission potential than primary schools. This could lead to higher values of R when all
secondary schools are opened; but for all scenarios investigated, even the scenario in which all schools
are opened, we found strong support for R remaining below 1 in the Midlands (Fig. 2, final column)
assuming that all other transmission patterns remain unchanged.

Effect of school reopening on reproduction number
Next, we sought to estimate changes in R that may result from school reopenings alone - assuming
the transmission patterns in the rest of the population are maintained at strict lockdown phase levels.
In contrast to the the first part of the analysis, which focused on a single set of parameters and a
single region (Fig. 2), here we explore the full parameter uncertainty and compare different parts of
the country.
For all school opening scenarios, within the seven regions of England, we observe an increase in R
compared to what we predict for keeping schools closed until the end of the academic year (Fig. 3 and
Supporting Figure S3). This is to be expected, given the increase in contact between children that
such reopening scenarios would allow. However, the magnitude of increase is predicted to be relatively
low, depending on the age-groups that return to school. In general, the more year groups allowed to
return to school at one time, the greater the effect on R, with the return of secondary school children
having the greatest impact.
The impact of allowing multiple year groups to return to school can still be small: opening a fraction
of the age-cohorts in each school generally leads to a moderate (less than 0.05) increase in R, especially
if children can be taught in smaller class sizes which is assumed to lead to a proportionate reduction
in within school transmission.
There is however considerable variation between the regions and here we focus on four exemplars.
For London and North East England & Yorkshire, the increase in R was considerably less than that
for East of England and the Midlands across all reopening scenarios. For the former, even allowing
all age groups to return to school (while maintaining tight control in other age-groups) was highly
unlikely to increase R above 1, with both means and 95% prediction intervals falling well below this
threshold (Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), the 95% prediction intervals, as the name suggests, contain 95% of
all predicted values across the entire posterior distribution of parameters). This low R value was
especially true for London, which saw the most abrupt rise and subsequent decline in cases. However,
this was not the case for the East of England (Fig. 3(c)) and the Midlands (Fig. 3(d)). In these regions,
allowing schools to fully reopen could increase R above 1, with such an occurrence lying within the 95%
prediction intervals. We attribute these regional differences to both heterogeneity in the observed rate
of epidemic decline and the differential proportion of school age children in each region; the Midlands
has the highest proportion of older teenagers in the country.
Quantifying clinical case impact stemming from the re-opening of schools
Our final piece of analysis examined the extent to which each of the eight school reopening strategies
may contribute to clinical case outcomes, using the full dynamic model. We also considered the
sensitivity of reopening schools to other potential changes in population mixing patterns (and hence
different values of R) driven by other changes to the lockdown since 13th May.
In each scenario, reopening schools increased the absolute number of cases, ICU admissions and deaths
as a result of increased transmission (Fig. 4). Note that these increases will not be restricted to the
children that return to school, since the greater transmission will lead to increased cases in other age
groups. Echoing our earlier findings, strategies in which a larger number of children return to school
generally resulted in larger increases. In addition, older children had a greater effect, so that reopening
secondary schools results in larger increases than only reopening primary schools.
The opening of schools on 1st June was just one of a collection of changes in a short space of time,
which began from 13th May. In the previous sections we focused on school reopening, assuming
that mixing (and hence transmission) within the wider population remained unchanged. Here we
allowed the relaxation of lockdown measures to precipitate an increase of R within the community

and calculate the additional change from the opening of schools. We consistently found that school
reopening had a larger impact when R in the community was high, leading to a greater increase in
cases, ICU admissions and deaths. However, by far the largest increase in any of these key quantities
was driven by the underlying change in R due to relaxations other than the reopening of schools
(Figs. 4(b), 4(d) and 4(f)).

Discussion

306

In this paper, we have described a mathematical model used in May 2020 to consider the implications
of various potential strategies for reopening schools in England. We have compared the different
strategies by presenting mixing matrices and discussing their implication for onward transmission, and
by analysing the increase in the reproduction number and absolute number of cases, ICU admissions
and deaths compared to those predicted if schools remain closed. Given that in May all regions were
estimated to have reproduction numbers (R) below 0.8, we predicted that, in the absence of other
changes, the complete opening of all schools was unlikely to raise the reproduction number above one.
It must be noted that even though R remains below one, the slight increase in transmission resulting
from school reopening subsequently leads to a small increase in the absolute number of cases, ICU
admissions and deaths. If the reopening of schools is part of a wider policy of relaxing controls, then
the impact of these additional changes must also be factored into the analysis [30, 31].
Reopening schools, in any form, inevitably leads to more mixing between children, an increase in R
and thus more transmission of the disease. However, we can constrain and potentially minimise the
extent of this increase by selecting a subset of year-groups to return to school. In doing so, we restrict
the increase in R to very low levels and, crucially, avoid any possibility of increasing R above 1. These
findings are in agreement with studies applied to other nations suggesting that school settings are
not a major driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. A statistical study in US counties looking at the
relationship between the reduction in growth rate and the timing of different state and local government
social distancing interventions found school closures to not be statistically significant [37]. Further, in
terms of suppressing spread of SARS-CoV-2, a mechanistic transmission model evaluating the impact
of non-pharmaceutical interventions in Switzerland, by their potential to reduce R below 1 at a national
level, predicted school closures alone would typically be insufficient to induce control [38].
In choosing a specific reopening policy, decision-makers must weigh-up the benefits to both children and
parents that are gained from allowing more year groups to return to school, with the risks associated
with increased transmission. In light of the variation in effects on R between regions, reopening policies
may benefit from heterogeneity across the country, in order to allow the most children possible to
return to school without threatening a resurgence of disease prevalence. Our results also highlighted
the benefit to be gained from small class sizes and hence maintaining such measures of social distancing,
with the impact of this form of non-pharmaceutical intervention within the school environment difficult
to infer without explicit data.
Our results also predicted a higher risk of increased transmission associated with reopening secondary
schools compared to the reopening of primary schools. Such a relationship may be partly attributed
to the observed larger number of contacts of secondary school children compared to primary school
children [36]. Additionally, other contributory factors include differences between age groups in terms
of susceptibility and, if infected, displaying symptoms [7, 8]. These may consequently lead to secondary
school children having a larger contribution to overall transmission throughout the population. This
could potentially be offset by the greater ability of older pupils to understand and abide by social
distancing advice.
Increasing levels of contacts between school children inevitably leads to greater absolute numbers of
infections, detected cases, ICU admissions and, regrettably, deaths, even if the reproduction number
is not raised above one. For this reason, we also estimate the increase in these outcomes as a result
of reopening schools using the different strategies. The ranking of the different strategies for these
outcomes mirrors the ranking in terms of increases in R. The epidemiological impact of reopening
schools also depends on the behaviour of the wider population. If there is more mixing within the adult
(and elderly) population, the effect of reopening schools will be exacerbated by the generally higher
infection levels and contacts in the community. Reopening schools will then lead to greater increases in

case numbers over and above the increases due to greater mixing. In general, we found that even small
changes in R due to the behaviour of the general population swamp the impacts of reopening schools.
We would stress that, such increases must be viewed in the context of the restrictions currently placed
on pupils and parents. Ultimately, it is a societal decision to balance the benefits to pupils’ welfare
and education against the epidemiological consequences.
To consider the effects of specific school years returning, this work made some simplifying assumptions,
and our results therefore have limitations. In particular, in this paper we consider only an Englandspecific context. The devolved administrations employ a different school system from England, including different school term dates, which may affect the outcome of reopening schools. Future work could
incorporate such differences, some of the epidemic variability between nations will be captured by the
model parameter fits that are already performed for all the devolved nations. In our analysis of schools
we have made the pessimistic assumption that there will be limited non-pharmaceutical intervention
within the school setting, however, we have ignored the potentially greater mixing of parents or other
adults when taking younger children to school. Also, the model is deterministic, and captures the
return to school in terms of increased mixing between school ages; it cannot capture the inevitable
heterogeneity between schools, with some schools experiencing many cases while others have none.
Similarly, we make no attempt to replicate the reactive closure of classes to prevent further spread
once cases are identified.
As we have shown, the context in which school reopening happens will also have an impact on its
effect. While we consider different population level mixing patterns, this exploration is necessarily
constrained; for example it may also be the case that the opening of schools allows more parents to
return to work, increasing their risk of infection [30]. Indeed, a surge in cases in Seoul, South Korea
linked to a distribution centre, has identified at least one SARS-CoV-2 positive high-school student,
whose family member worked at the centre; this was followed by the re-implementation of localised
lockdown and social distancing measures, including the closure of 251 schools, days after their phased
reopening [39]. It is also be important to consider the impact of school re-openings in combination
with other concurrent measures, such as the NHS test and trace system in England (that began on
28th May) [40], which aims to trace close recent contacts of anyone who tests positive for SARS-CoV-2
and, if necessary, notify them to self-isolate at home to prevent onward transmission. Effective contact
tracing breaks transmission chains, but may also subject school classes to tracing and isolation. Even
without national-scale relaxation in the lockdown measures, the behaviour of the general population
is likely to change over time, in ways that are difficult to predict. Beyond these considerations, we
have also neglected the many possible side effects of reopening schools, such as parents interacting at
the school gates, teachers’ exposure while travelling to school (or in the staff room), or the effects of
school reopening on children mixing outside of school.
These analyses, performed in May, indicated that it should have been feasible to reopen all schools
in June. Reopening schools (for June and July) while other measures remained constant would have
allowed accurate information regarding the impact of children returning to the classroom for a relatively short period, and would have provided invaluable evidence on the role of younger age-groups
in transmission. In practice, there was only a partial reopening on 1st June, with reception (year 0),
year 1 and year 6 returning to primary schools, and the sporadic return of some years 10 and 12 to
senior schools from 15th June. We predicted that the general return of just three primary school years
would have a minimal impact on R, and very few school-based outbreaks were reported before the
main summer holidays [41]. Unfortunately, before the return of all children to school in September,
multiple regions (notably Leicester, Manchester and the North West) of England experienced high
case numbers, while R continued to rise - such that it was likely to be above 1 before the reopening of
schools. However, our modelling still generates some useful predictions. School reopening is predicted
to have a larger impact in September than it would have done in June, although the impact is still

relatively small compared to other relaxations of lockdown. Our work also suggests that measures to
mitigate the rise in cases as we approach winter would be best focused on other routes of transmission,
as even when R is significantly above 1, the effect of opening or closing schools is minimal.

Supporting Text S1
Description of the complete system of model equations.

Supporting Text S2
Details on the mechanisms underpinning social distancing measures within the model framework

Supporting Figure S1
Posterior distributions of key model parameters from fitting to date until 1st June. The
left-hand graphs show how the probability of symptoms (da ) and susceptibility (σa ) varies with age;
given the low value of alpha most of the age-dependence is in the displaying of symptoms. The
right-hand graph shows the relative adherence with lockdown measures in each region; high values
correspond to a dramatic reduction in the mixing matrix, while an adherence of zero returns the
matrix to pre-lockdown levels. This figure supplements the information in Table 1. Bars show the
95% credible intervals from the posterior distribution.

Supporting Figure S2
Distribution of household symptomatic, asymptomatic and isolated cases in each age
group on 1st June. Used in conjunction with Fig. 1. Bottom segments (blue shading) represent
symptomatic infection. Middle segments (orange shading) represent asymptomatic infection. Top
segments (yellow shading) represent those in isolation. Filled dots specify the fraction of the population
within that age bracket.

Supporting Figure S3
Increase in reproduction number, R, under eight school reopening scenarios for three
regions in England. Estimates are depicted for the following three regions: (a) North West, (b)
South East, (c) East of England. For each scenario, bars represent the mean absolute increase in
R, compared to what we would observe if schools remained closed. We also give the 95% prediction
intervals. Solid red lines identify the absolute increase required to raise R above 1, within each region,
alongside 95% credible intervals (dashed red lines). Means and intervals are calculated from 1000
replicates sampled from the posterior parameter distributions. All scenarios are implemented on 1st
June and continued until 22nd July.
