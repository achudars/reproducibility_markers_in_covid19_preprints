Abstract
Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase anxiety levels within the community
and in particular medical students who are already considered psychologically vulnerable groups.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, no study has yet estimated the effect of this pandemic on university
students in the UAE or its impact on the psychological well-being of medical students.
Methods: In this study, we surveyed 1485 medical (comprising medical and dental) and nonmedical university students across 4 emirates within the UAE. We used an online platform to
assess knowledge, sources of information, changes in hygienic behavior, perceptions of fear and
worry and anxiety levels using the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. The GAD-7
score was measured at three time points; during hospital visits for medical/dental students, before
the introduction of online learning and after online learning for all students.
Results: The majority of students demonstrated high levels of knowledge and utilized reliable
sources of information. Non-medical students exercised higher compliance with social restrictions,
while medical students practiced better hand hygiene. Almost half of students reported anxiety
levels ranging from mild to severe with females reporting higher anxiety scores during hospital
visits (OR=2.02, 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.91) and medical students reporting lower anxiety levels in
comparison to dental students (OR=0.61, 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.84). Medical students reported higher

levels of anxiety during their clinical rotations which decreased with the introduction of online
learning, yet, non-medical student’s anxiety levels increased with online learning.
Conclusions: This is the first study to provide important information on the initial response and
anxiety levels in university students across the UAE. The findings from our study can be used to
support the development of effective screening strategies and interventions to build psychological
resilience among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health
emergencies in the future.

Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have long been considered inconsequential pathogens, causing the
common cold in otherwise healthy people. However, in the 21st century, two highly pathogenic
HCoVs—severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)—emerged from animal reservoirs to cause global
epidemics with alarming morbidity and mortality in 2003 and 2012 respectively. In December
2019, yet another pathogenic HCoV, SARS-CoV-2, was recognized in Wuhan, China, causing
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [1] and raising intense attention not only within China but
internationally [1].

Since its first detection, COVID-19 has become a major health problem and the global outbreak
was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11th, 2020 [2]. To
date, more than 3.4 million laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported worldwide with
~245,000 deaths in 184 countries, bringing the crude case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 to
~7.2%[3]. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was reported
on 29 January 2020. The UAE had 13,599 confirmed cases (10,816 active; 2,664 recovered; 119
deaths; CFR ~1.1%, as of 3rd May 2020) [4].

The emergence of such a novel and highly contagious pandemic and its uncertainty is likely to
raise community anxiety and have a psychological impact on communities overall. Social
distancing, quarantine and disruption of studies, are especially pertinent on impacting university
students, and in particular medical students who are already considered psychologically vulnerable
groups. The highly competitive training of these students, their academic pressure, exposure to
patients in clinical settings, financial constraints and lack of sleep are factors which may already
contribute to psychological problems associated with stress and anxiety [5-7]. Additionally, during
disease outbreaks, medical students, like healthcare workers, are perceived to be at higher risk of
infection because of their clinical training, and hence increased risk of exposure to the virus [8, 9].
This is in addition to their fear of transmitting the virus back to their family and loved ones [10].

82

In previous infectious disease outbreaks, such as MERS-CoV and SARS, almost one quarter of
medical students reported mild to moderate anxiety in Saudi Arabia [11] and anxiety levels were
found to be higher in medical students than non-medical students in Hong Kong [12].

study, we aim to assess medical student’s psychological distress and concerns during the recent
COVID-19 pandemic, their degree of perceived information about the disease, and their overall
attitude, practices and behaviors during the outbreak. We also evaluate students’ perceptions on
the precautionary measures in place and the effectiveness of educational strategies in reducing
anxiety levels in the United Arab Emirates. This makes our study the first in the UAE to discuss
this aspect in the current pandemic.

A cross-sectional study design was used to conduct this research during the COVID-19 outbreak
in March 2020. Data were collected between March 11 and March 21. University students from
medical, dental and non-medical colleges across the UAE were invited to participate in the
research through an online web survey hosted on the platform survey monkey
(https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/VSYTNQ9)[13] (S1). All students enrolled in the medical and
dental colleges at the University of Sharjah received the survey link through their university emails
using convenience sampling. Students from other universities received the survey link through
WhatsApp and other social media platforms using snowball sampling where acquaintances sent
the link to each other. Through the survey link, the first page explained the research objectives and
assured participants anonymity and confidentiality. Students’ acceptance indicated their consent
to participate in the study. The study was approved by the University of Sharjah Research Ethics
Committee (REC-20-03-03-02) prior to participant recruitments.

A study conducted in Saudi Arabia during the MERS-COV outbreak found that 77% of medical
students reported minimal anxiety levels [11]. Using this proportion and a confidence level of 95%
and margin of error of 5%, we calculated the minimum required sample size to be 278 for each of
the medical and non-medical groups. To account for non-response the sample size was increased
by 20%, making the minimum sample size required for this study 333 students for each of the
medical and non-medical groups.

A questionnaire comprising of 18 items was used in this study. A modified version of a
questionnaire measuring medical student anxiety previously used in Saudi Arabia during the
MERS-CoV outbreak was used, after the author's permission[10, 11]. The questions were divided
into seven domains comprising of 1) demographic questions, 2) change in hygienic behavior, with
responses measured on a 4 point Likert scale ranging from very much has changed to no change
at all, 3) level of knowledge on statements related to COVID-19 such as transmission, treatment,
prognosis and prevention measured by true/false/don’t know responses, 4) perceptions of worry
and fear associated with COVID-19 measured on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from very worried
to not worried at all, and their opinion about the public fear associated with COVID-19 being
justifiable or dysfunctional, measured on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from strongly agree to
strongly disagree, 5) perception of receiving enough information on COVID-19 on a 5-point Likert
scale, ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree, 6) the sources of information students
resorted to for information on COVID-19 and 7) Measurement of anxiety levels.

In order to measure anxiety levels, we used the generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) [14]
which is a 7-item questionnaire asking participants how often they were bothered by each symptom
such as feeling nervous, trouble relaxing, irritable and afraid that something awful might happen
during the last 2 weeks. Response options were “not at all,” “several days,” “more than half the
days,” and “nearly every day,” scored as 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A score of 10 or greater
represents a reasonable cut point for identifying cases of anxiety with a sensitivity of 89% and
specificity 82%, internal consistency (Cronbach α=.92) and Test-retest reliability (intraclass
correlation=0.83)[14]. The GAD-7 has also been identified as a screener for panic disorder, social
phobia and PTSD ( with a cutoff score of 8 sensitivity 77% and specificity 82%) [15]. In our study,
the GAD-7 score was totaled for each student and classified into cut-off points of (0-4 minimal, 59 mild, 10-14 moderate and 15-21 severe) levels of anxiety. Levels of anxiety were measured using
the GAD-7 scale at three different time points. In addition to calculating the mean GAD-7 score,
scores were classified into 3 categories (minimal, mild and moderate/severe anxiety).

During the launch of data collection for this study, the UAE Ministry of Education declared
university campuses to move to online learning to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and classes
moved online on March 8. In order to determine levels of anxiety of students during the transition
to online learning, medical and dental students were asked to respond to the GAD-7 questions
reflecting back to the time they were attending hospital visits within the previous two weeks. This
was to assess whether higher levels of anxiety were associated with hospital visits. All students
were asked to respond to the GAD-7 questions reflecting on “before the introduction of online
learning”, and “after the introduction of online learning”.

The final version of the questionnaire was piloted to ensure clarity and consistency between survey
items. To ensure face and content validity of the survey instrument, the survey was sent to a group
of 9 experts which consisted of students, tutors, faculty and a psychiatrist who reviewed the survey
for content accuracy, clarity and comprehensiveness and whether the survey met its objectives. As
a result, the phrasing and response items of some questions were modified, and format was edited
for clarity and comprehensibility

Descriptive statistics, including means, medians, frequencies and percentages were used to
summarize data and to illustrate the demographic and other selected characteristics of students.
Normality of data was tested visually using the Q-Q plots and statistically using the KolmogorovSmirnov test. Bivariate analysis using Chi-square (2) and Mann-Whitney U tests explored the
associations between student demographic characteristics and anxiety levels. Spearman's
correlation coefficient, r, was used to evaluate the association between knowledge score and GAD7 score. Statistically significant factors in the bivariate analysis were included in the multivariate
ordinal logistic regression analyses to determine if they predicted student anxiety levels. The
estimates of the strengths of associations were demonstrated by the odds ratio (OR) with a 95%
confidence interval (CI). A two-tailed p <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were
analyzed using IBM SPSS Version 25.0 [16]

students were studying medicine or dental medicine and from those students a third (35%) were in
their clinical years of study and were completing clinical ward rotations. Of these students, (12%)
reported being in contact with an infected or suspected case of COVID-19. Demographic
characteristics are shown in Table 1.

The majority of students reported increased hand hygiene (85%), increased use of hand sanitizer
(85.5%), avoiding people with flu like symptoms (80%) and decreased visits to crowded places
(77%). A lower proportion of students reported wearing gloves and masks (58%), decreased social
visits (62%) or decreased hand shaking (58%). We combined medical and dental students together
as the medical group, and all other specialties made up the non-medical group. When medical and
non-medical students were compared, more non-medical students avoided being in contact with
people with flu-like symptoms, had decreased social visits, decreased visits to crowded places and
use of public facilities as displayed in Figure 1.

Most students agreed they had heard enough information on the symptoms, prognosis,
transmission and prevention of COVID-19. When we compared medical and non-medical
students, significantly more medical students reported having heard sufficient information on
COVID-19 prognosis,  2 (2, N=1385) = 55.20, p<0.001 and COVID-19 transmission,  2 (2,
N=1385) = 17.88, p<0.001. (Table 2). Overall, students had good knowledge of COVID-19 with
over 70% of students answering correctly on the COVID-19 knowledge questions with a median
score of 5 (from a maximum score of 7). When we compared participant’s’ knowledge scores by
field of study, gender and contact with COVID-19, we found that medical students, females and
students who had been in contact with COVID-19 cases had significantly higher knowledge scores
than their counterparts, as shown in Table 2.

Students’ main sources of information were official websites, press releases from the Ministry of
Health (MOH) and social media. A statistically significant higher percentage of medical students
reported using the WHO website (52%) (p≤0.001), MOH (50%) (p=0.001), hospital
announcements (27%) (p≤0.001) and social media (54%) (p=0.010) to retrieve their information
as displayed in Figure 2.

The median GAD-7 scores for medical students during their hospital visits, for all students before
introduction of online learning and after online learning were 4, 4 and 3, respectively. When we
compared GAD-7 scores for medical students by gender, specialty (dental or medical), contact
with COVID-19, rotation type and clinical phase of study, we found that females, dental medicine
students, students who had been in contact with COVID-19 patients and students in their clinical
phase of study reported statistically significant higher anxiety levels. More students (27%) in lowrisk ward rotations reported mild anxiety while the majority of students who reported moderate to
severe levels of anxiety (26%) were attending high risk ward rotations 2 (3, N=1385) = 10.92,
p=0.027 (Table 3).

Overall, females reported higher levels of anxiety in GAD-7, both before and after online learning.
The medical students reported higher levels of anxiety before online learning in comparison to
non-medical students (Table 3).

214

Interestingly, anxiety levels significantly decreased for females and for medical students after
switching to the online learning, with 2 (2, N=1385) = 12.22, p<0.001 and 2 (2, N=1385) = 20.99,
p<0.001, respectively, with a higher percentage of decreased anxiety among dental students; whilst
non-medical students reported higher levels of anxiety after the introduction of online learning (2

The majority of students (73%) reported being worried about transmitting COVID-19 to one of
their family members or friends, while 65% of them were worried about catching the virus
themselves. Almost half (49%) of medical students reported being worried about transmitting
COVID-19 to others and were less likely (29%) to worry about catching it themselves, in
comparison to non-medical students (35%), although the differences were not statistically
significant (2 (2, N=1385) = 2.85, p=0.24). Most students (61%) agreed that the public fear was
justifiable and (46%) of students did not perceive it as dysfunctional .

A cumulative odds ordinal logistic regression with proportional odds was performed to determine
predictors of anxiety levels during the different time points. The effect of gender, specialty, contact
with COVID-19, rotation type, clinical phase of study and knowledge score on the GAD-7 score
during hospital visits was modelled. We included knowledge score in the regression model because
we found a positive, but weak, correlation between knowledge score and anxiety score using
Spearman’s correlation (rs=0.086, p=0.015). The odds of females having higher anxiety scores
during hospital visits was 2.02 (95% CI, 1.41 to 2.91) times that for males, and medical students
reported lower anxiety levels in comparison to dental medicine students (OR=0.61, 95% CI, 0.45
to 0.84). Furthermore, being in a rotation and demonstrating higher knowledge scores predicted
higher GAD-7 scores during hospital visits (Table 4). Similarly, gender, field of study and
knowledge score predicted higher GAD-7 scores before online learning, but only gender and field
of study predicted GAD-7 scores after switching to online learning (Table 4).

This study has revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on anxiety levels among
university students in the UAE, with almost half of students reporting mild to moderate/severe
anxiety levels. The effect of COVID-19 on the global community overall has been considerably
significant, causing fear, anxiety and worry, particularly due to uncertainty of the prognosis of the
disease, changes in societies lifestyles, lockdown restrictions and educational disruptions. The
impact of COVID-19 on university students is particularly burdensome due to the perceived effect
of the virus on their studies; and with medical students specifically it could be due to the
interdisciplinary nature of their training and the potential proximity of being exposed to the virus
during their clinical studies [17]

247
248
249
250

Overall, students in our study demonstrated good knowledge of COVID-19 and reported using
reliable sources such as official statements and press releases from the ministry of health and the
WHO website. Although the use of these sources was higher among medical students, social media
was the main source of information for both medical and non-medical students. This finding is

consistent with the literature and emphasizes the role that social media can play in risk perception
and dissemination of reliable information during a pandemic such as COVID-19 [18-21].
However, other studies have also reported that young people tend to obtain a large amount of
information from social media which can easily be a trigger for stress and anxiety [22].

Good knowledge may also explain students’ compliance with hygienic practices in our study. Most
students reported significant change in their hygienic behavior since the COVID-19 outbreak,
particularly for increased hand hygiene, avoiding crowded places and avoiding being in contact
with people with flu like symptoms. However, even though levels of knowledge were significantly
higher among medical students, compliance with hygienic practices were similar for both groups.
Furthermore, we found significant positive correlations between changes in hygienic behavior and
increased levels of anxiety. More than half of students who reported changed hygienic practices
reported higher levels of anxiety, which is consistent with recent literature indicating that people
who were more anxious about COVID-19 were also more engaged with regular hand hygiene and
social distancing behaviors [23].

There is increasing evidence that the number of growing cases of COVID-19 globally and within
the UAE is causing public worry and concern[24, 25] and in the absence of vaccines and effective
treatment, government authorities have introduced rules and restrictions[26]. Compliance and
adherence with these restrictions has been found to differ amongst different age groups and
populations, with less acceptance of these restrictions being reported amongst younger age-groups
[27]. However, in our study, the majority of students did not consider the strict measures
undertaken by the healthcare authorities as dysfunctional or not required. The students were
worried about transmitting COVID-19 to their family members more than they were worried about
catching the virus themselves, therefore, indicating a beneficial sense of social responsibility
during such infectious disease outbreak. Similar concerns were reported amongst healthcare
workers in Hong Kong and Canada during the SARS outbreak [28, 29].

The results from the current study confirm that anxiety levels due to COVID-19 among university
students are high, ranging from mild to severe, especially amongst females, which is in accordance
with previous research [22, 30, 31]. The majority of students in our study were females, which
reflects the gender imbalance in higher education within the UAE. More than two thirds of students
reported mild anxiety levels and one third of students reported severe anxiety. What makes this
study unique, is that medical and non-medical students were compared, and within the medical
student group, we compared medical and dental students. Furthermore, this study assessed anxiety
levels at three different time points: during hospital visits for medical and dental students, before
online learning and after switching to the online learning for all students. Among the
medical/dental group, students in their clinical phase of study and who had rotations in high risk
wards or who had been in contact with COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher (moderate
to severe) levels of anxiety, demonstrating that high risk perception of COVID-19 may contribute
to higher levels of anxiety. Medical/dental students continued attending the hospitals at the early
onset of COVID-19 when fear and worry associated with the outbreak would have been at their
peak and before lockdown restrictions were in place, which could also explain their high
compliance with infection control measures. Medical students high risk perceptions associated
with attending hospitals during infectious disease outbreaks has been reportedly associated with
higher levels of anxiety [12, 21]. However, when we compared between medical and dental
students, dental students reported higher levels of anxiety and these remained significant with
further multivariate analysis. Previous studies have established that medical and dental programs

are highly competitive and students generally experience high levels of stress during their training
[32, 33]. Yet, dental students suffer from greater levels of perceived stress than medical students
due to their role as providers of care and earlier exposure to patients in the dental clinics [34].
Furthermore, dental students are in very close proximity to patients and are dealing directly with
patients’ dental care during a potentially highly transmissible respiratory virus. This may explain
the higher levels of anxiety among dental students in our study and the overall decrease in anxiety
among all medical students following the introduction of online learning. Psychological support
should be tailored to each students’ needs and incorporated into the online remote curriculum.
Screening university students on a regular basis with tools such as the GAD-7 could help faculty
in the early identification of highly anxious students and guide students to receive help from
targeted interventions that promote psychological well-being, offer counselling, mental health
support and coping mechanisms[35].

Non-medical students reported higher levels of anxiety before and after online learning in
comparison to medical students and whilst medical student anxiety levels decreased following the
introduction of online learning, non-medical student’s anxiety levels increased. This may be due
to several factors, including medical students possibly being more familiar with the use of online
learning platforms, being distant from the perceived risk of COVID-19, or due to the variable
sources of information about the pandemic among both groups. Knowledge of the virus might
reduce students fears and anxiety while inadequate understanding of COVID-19, its prognosis,
transmission and control measures might contribute to negative implications and fear of the
unknown [29] hence explaining the higher anxiety levels in non-medical students in our study.

Despite the findings of this study, we acknowledge that it has several limitations. Firstly, the use
of convenience sampling and its descriptive nature through an online survey may not allow the
generalization of results. However, considering the need for a rapid method to assess stress and
anxiety in a vulnerable population during a rapidly evolving infectious disease outbreak, the use
of an online survey serves as a promising method for quick results [36]. Additionally, responses
were collected from four different emirates across the UAE with good response rate allowing for
a certain element of representation. Secondly, the nature of self-reported data in the survey may
lead to response biases specifically for hygienic practices where students may provide socially
desirable responses and self-reported levels of anxiety, stress and worry which may not always be
as accurate as being assessed by a mental health professional. However, despite these limitations,
this study provides important baseline information which will inform further research and public
health interventions in this area.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide important information on the initial
response and anxiety levels in university students across the UAE immediately following the
period COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. More than half of university students reported
mild to severe anxiety levels with a quarter of students reporting severe anxiety. Specifically,
medical students reported higher levels of anxiety during their clinical rotations which decreased
with the introduction of online learning, yet, non-medical student’s anxiety levels increased with
online learning. The findings from our study can be used at the government and university level to
develop effective screening strategies and to formulate interventions that improve mental health
of students. Such strategies will reduce unnecessary stress and anxiety among university students,
