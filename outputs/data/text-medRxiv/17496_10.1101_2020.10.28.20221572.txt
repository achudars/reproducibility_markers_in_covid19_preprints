Abstract
This paper investigates the role of socioeconomic considerations in the formation of
official COVID-19 reports. To this end, we employ a dataset that contains 1,159
preprocessed indicators from the World Bank Group GovData360 and TCdata360
platforms and an additional 8 COVID-19 variables generated based on reports from 138
countries. During the analysis, a rank-correlation-based complex method is used to
identify the time- and space-varying relations between pandemic variables and the main
topics of World Bank Group platforms. The results not only draw attention to the
importance of factors such as air traffic, tourism, and corruption in report formation
but also support further discipline-specific research by mapping and monitoring a wide
range of such relationships. To this end, an R Notebook is attached that allows for the
customization of the analysis and provides up-to-date results.

Introduction

1

Research on the COVID-19 pandemic has grown rapidly since the outbreak of the
disease; however, despite the enormous media attention on countries’ reports, only a few
articles address the number of officially reported cases and deaths as a social
phenomenon. As many studies have pointed out, there is a significant discrepancy
between the officially confirmed data and recently published estimates (see, e.g., [1, 2]).
However, what do these data reflect, beyond the true nature of the virus? Of the few
articles dealing with this question, [3] examined the protective effect of BCG on
COVID-19 infections and the death toll while using indicators such as the Human
Development Index (HDI), per-capita GDP, and urban population percentage as
additional control variables. Moreover, in line with [4], they applied the Corruption
Perception Index (CPI) as a proxy for the reliability of reported COVID-19 data. [5]
showed that more democratic political institutions experienced deaths on a larger
per-capita scale and sooner than did less democratic countries, and based on [6], the
population size and government health expenditure are strongly related to COVID-19
cases.

In contrast to these (mostly) discipline-specific studies, our goal is to map, analyze,
and monitor a wide range of such relationships in time and space by applying a
data-driven approach. In this paper, we employ a rank-correlation-based complex
method and a dataset that contains 1,159 preprocessed indicators from the World Bank
Group GovData360 and TCdata360 platforms and an additional 8 COVID-19 variables.
The results not only draw attention to the importance of factors such as air traffic,
tourism, and corruption in report formation but also support decision makers and
discipline-specific research by providing an R Notebook that allows for the
customization of the analysis and provides up-to-date results.
The paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the data and
methodology used during the calculations. Then, the results are presented and discussed.
Finally, the last section provides the conclusions and proposes future research directions.

Joint dataset of GovData360, TCdata360 and COVID-19
reports

This paper follows the steps of [7] when creating a linked database of governance, trade,
and competitiveness indicators with COVID-19 reports. (To derive the up-to-date
dataset, we use the author’s R source code, which is publicly available at [8].) Former
indicators were obtained from the GovData360 and TCdata360 platforms using the
data360r (version: 1.0.8) R package [9]. From these platforms, only annual indicators
from 2015 and later were collected, and their missing values were replaced with previous
annual values in descending order by year until 2015. During preprocessing, indicators
(columns) where the ratio of missing values exceeded 50% were filtered out. Then, the
same filtration was applied above 25% in the case of countries (rows). Finally, highly
correlated variables and variables with near-zero variances were removed, and the
standardized form of the retained 1,159 indicators was connected with 8 COVID-19
variables, generated based on the official reports of 138 countries [10]. Note that
auxiliary indicators measuring the number of data sources and standard error were also
filtered out, and variables with near-zero variances were eliminated using the default
settings of nearZeroVar function contained by the caret (version: 6.0-85) R package [11].
The presented data were compiled on July 22, 2020. Table 1 shows the description of
the variables in the structure of the final dataset.

Community-based model reduction

49

Our goal is to map the time- and space-varying relationship between COVID-19
(furthermore dependent) variables (Y := {y1 , .., yM }) and indicators from GovData360
and TCdata360 platforms (furthermore independent variables, X := {x1 , .., xN }). To
obtain an easily interpretable, comprehensive picture from these connections, similar
GovData360 and TCdata360 indicators are grouped and characterized by latent
variables. The applied steps are as follows.
First, standardized independent variables that have higher absolute (Spearman) rank
correlation than an α parameter with at least one dependent variable are selected and
denoted as X ⊆ X . Formally:
X := {x|x ∈ X ∧ ∃ y ∈ Y, where |cor(y, x)| ≥ α}.

Then, the rank correlation matrix of the selected variables is used as an adjacency
matrix A, in which absolute rank correlation values below a β parameter are
substituted by 0. Formally:
(
0,
if |cor(xi , xj )| < β
aij = [A]ij :=
, xi , xj ∈ X.
(2)
|cor(xi , xj )|, if |cor(xi , xj )| ≥ β
Note that the adjacency matrix A defines a network, where the vertices are the
selected variables (V = X), edges are indicated by the nonzero values
(eij ∈ E ⇔ [A]ij = aij > 0) and their weight is the absolute rank correlation between
the selected variables (w : E → R+ , w(i, j) = aij ). (Note that the same strategy was
applied by, e.g., [13] and [14], to visualize variable similarity.)
To group similar variables, our goal is to separate this network into groups of
vertices that have fewer connections between them than inside the communities. In the
literature, this task [15] is referred to as modularity-based community analysis (see,
e.g., [16]) or simply community detection (see, e.g., [17]). Although the proposed
method may seem more complicated than traditional model reduction methods, because
of the large number of variables and relatively few observations, they cannot be used. In
addition, the visualization of the (correlation) network facilitates control over

community formation (especially if N is large). This benefit is realized by using the
Louvain community detection method [18] with an associated filtrating procedure that
gains heterogeneity between the groups by eliminating weakly connected group
members.
After Louvain community detection, we obtain C := {c1 , .., cn } communities on
G(V, E), which specifies {Gc1 , .., Gcn } = G partitions of network G. As a next step,
each community is represented by a single composite (so-called latent) variable (x̂ci )

is the eigenvector centrality of node j, and λ > 0 is a constant. Louvain modularity and
eigenvector centrality were calculated using the cluster louvain and eigen centrality
functions of igraph (version: 1.2.4.2) R package, respectively [19]. Note that the use of
eigenvector centrality as a weight ensures that deeper embedded variables (within the
given community) play a greater role in the formation of the latent variable. (Also note
that the use of standardized independent variables results in standardized latent
variables). To increase the homogeneity of communities, we calculate the absolute
(Spearman) rank correlation of each variable within the community i with the related
latent variable x̂ci , and variables that have weaker absolute rank correlation than a γ
parameter are removed from their communities. Finally, the steps of this paragraph
(from community detection to filtration) are repeated until no more variables can be
eliminated.
At the end of the process, we rank communities (characterized by latent variables)
by their absolute rank correlation with dependent variables. Then, we select the top
C ≤ n interpretable communities and investigate their relationship with the dependent
variables through their absolute rank correlation coefficients. To examine the regional
differences in addition to the study of time-varying relationships, these correlations are
identified as well on the subset of different regions (see variable r∗ in Table 1). The
calculation steps are summarized in Fig 1.

Results and discussion

102

Following the calculation order presented above, we first illustrate and interpret the
results of community detection to identify the most important topics reflected in official
COVID-19 reports. Then, we investigate the time- and space-varying relations of these
communities with different pandemic variables.

When setting α, β, and γ parameters, our goal was to group the widest possible range
of important GovData360 and TCdata360 indicators without obtaining communities
that are difficult to interpret. To accomplish this goal, we set the parameters as
α = 0.535, β = 0.828 and γ = 0.770, which resulted in a network containing 319
indicators (vertices) and 1,669 edges, representing the strong correlations among the
indicators. Fig 2 illustrates five communities (C = 5) detected within this network and
helps their interpretation with word clouds generated based on the names of member
indicators. Word clouds were constructed after text cleaning and preprocessing by using
the wordcloud (version: 2.6) R package [20].

As Fig 2 shows, the topics most related to official COVID-19 reports are (1) tourism
and trade, (2) infrastructure and digitalization, (3) business and ICT, (4) regulation and
corruption, and (5) protectionism. From these, tourism and trade associates with the
flow of people and goods, as reflected by the most frequent terms such as tourism,
travel, merchandise, and imports. The contribution of the database also confirms this
finding since most indicators of this community are part of the World Travel & Tourism
Council (27%), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Statistics (19%),
and World Integrated Trade Solution (15%) datasets. The second community describes

the infrastructure, especially in the field of digitalization, including variables such as
ICT access, public services and secure internet servers/million pop. Most of these
variables are derived from the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index
(34%), Global Innovation Index (24%), and World Development Indicators (17%)
databases. The third community, so-called business and ICT, is adjacent to
infrastructure and digitalization. As its name suggests, it is in connection with
information and communication technology (ICT); however, this community focuses
more on business aspects such as innovation, efficiency, and competitiveness. The group
regulation and corruption includes variables such as regulatory quality, political
environment, and corruption. The sources of most of these variables are the World
Justice Project - Rule of Law (31%), Global Innovation Index (25%), and Global State
of Democracy (19%). Finally, the fifth community is labeled protectionism because all
of its variables are related to tariffs. The variables for each community are detailed in
the Supporting information (see S1 File).

To visualize the absolute rank correlation between the COVID-19 variables and the
communities characterized by latent variables, radar charts are employed. In Fig 3,
these relations are classified into three groups. The first focuses on the time elapsed
since the first registered data, while the other two relate to the officially reported cases
and deaths per capita aggregated by using different time windows.

Fig 3. Absolute rank correlation between COVID-19 and latent variables.

As Fig 3 shows, indicators measuring the appearance of the virus are strongly
correlated with tourism- and trade-related activities. Taking a closer look at the
standalone variables within this community, GCI 4.0: Air transport and outbound travel
and tourism expenditure have the strongest (Spearman) rank correlation coefficients
with the days passed since the first case was reported (0.789 and 0.777, respectively).
Moreover, this COVID-19 indicator has a strong connection with variables of
international trade as well, such as Merchandise: Trade matrix by product groups,
imports (0.755) from the same community. In light of these close relationships, it may
be surprising to find that this community has a relatively weak connection with the
reported number of cases and deaths; however, increased controls at airports and the
rapid closure of borders could be reflected in this result.
In contrast to tourism and trade, these COVID-19 indicators are closely linked to the
other four communities, especially to infrastructure and digitalization. From this
community, variables related to digital development such as fixed broadband

subscriptions (per 100 people) and online creativity show the strongest positive
(Spearman) rank correlation with the number of deaths per capita (0.659 and 0.653,
using the 60-day time window), which suggests that a significantly higher death toll has
been reported by more developed countries. It is also reflected by the positive
correlation of this COVID-19 variable with A. Health indicator calculated from healthy
life expectancy (0.582) as well as by its strong negative relationship with GCI 4.0:
Exposure to unsafe drinking water (−0.676).
Based on these results, while the data suggesting the appearance of the virus seem
to be reliable and relatively easy to explain, reports on cases and deaths appear highly
distorted. On the one hand, this distortion may be a consequence of the poor health
infrastructure that makes measurement difficult, but on the other hand, political
interests could also be tied to underreporting. Since the regulation and corruption
community’s regulatory quality and freedom from corruption score indicators have a
strong positive correlation with the reported number of cases (0.560 and 0.533,
respectively) and deaths (0.565 and 0.523, respectively, using the 60-day time window),
the reports of countries with higher levels of corruption seem much less authentic.
Furthermore, detected communities contain strikingly many indicators related to the
development of the information society, which counteracts disinformation.
To support discipline-specific research, we detailed the correlations of each member
variable with different COVID-19 indicators in the Supporting information (see S1-S5
Tables). Similar to latent variables (see Fig 3), these standalone indicators typically
show increasing correlations with time window expansion; however, this change over
time can vary significantly from region to region.

To examine how the results presented in the previous subsection differ from region to
region, countries are divided into four groups by using the region ID variable (denoted
as r∗ in Table 1). These groups are Europe, Asia, Americas, Africa, and Oceania;
however, the last group was omitted from the investigation due its small sample size (2
countries). The regional differences in the relations of COVID-19 and latent variables
are presented in Fig 4.
Based on Fig 4, we can conclude that the impact of tourism and trade on the spread
of the virus is significant regardless of region; however, the variable measuring the
appearance of the first case shows the highest (Spearman) rank correlation with this
community in the Americas and Europe. In these two regions, variables such as GCI
4.0: Air transport (0.803 and 0.791, respectively) and government spending on travel
and tourism service (0.881 and 0.715, respectively) have one of the highest correlations
with days elapsed since the first case. Moreover, in the Americas and Europe, this
community, and especially its tourism- and air-transport-related indicators, shows an
increasingly close relationship with the number of registered deaths per capita as the
time window expands. Accordingly, regulations on foreign travel restrictions and airport
controls are particularly important in these regions.
Next to the Americas and Europe, in Asia, variables measuring the spread of the
virus are also strongly tied to the tourism and trade community, but these variables
have a stronger rank correlation with the data related to first death. Unlike other
regions, reports from Asian countries are mostly related to infrastructure and
digitalization and protectionism communities; however, even these relations appear weak
in comparison with the relationships detected in other regions. To obtain stronger ties,
it may be worthwhile to map the topics that contain the most important variables
separately for this region.
Finally, reported data both in Africa and Europe have remarkably close connections
with the regulation and corruption community, especially with indicators such as

variables are typically related to reported case numbers (0.568 and 0.551), in Europe,
they show a stronger correlation with deaths (0.495 and 0.583, using the 60-day time
window, respectively), which suggests that the reports of these regions are less credible.
Note that the correlations of standalone variables calculated on different regional
subsamples are contained in the Supporting information (see S2 File).

Although some of the recent studies have already investigated the relationship of
COVID-19 data with different socioeconomic indicators, the role of societal
considerations in the formation of official COVID-19 data is not yet clear. In contrast
to these studies, our goal was to map, analyze, and monitor a wide range of such
relationships in time and space by applying a data-driven approach. To this end, we
employed a rank-correlation-based complex method and a dataset that contains 1,159
preprocessed indicators from the World Bank Group GovData360 and TCdata360

platforms and an additional 8 COVID-19 variables generated based on the officially
reported number of cases and deaths.
From our results, the topics most related to official COVID-19 reports are tourism
and trade, infrastructure and digitalization, business and ICT, regulation and corruption,
and protectionism. By examining these topics and the variables they compress, we
found that tourism- and air-transport-related variables are key factors in the spread of
the virus, especially in the Americas and Europe. In these two regions, the variables of
the tourism and trade community show close connections with the reported death toll
as well, which also emphasizes the importance of regulations on foreign travel
restrictions and airport controls. In addition, the number of reported cases and deaths
seems unreliable since developed countries generally reported more cases and deaths
than developing countries. In line with the results, the two possible reasons for
underreporting may be the poor health infrastructure that makes measurement difficult
and the political will that is opposed to exploring and presenting the real
epidemiological situation. Accordingly, we experienced the closest relationship between
the level of corruption and reported data in Eurpoe and Africa.
Using the proposed analysis, further interesting regional and temporal patterns can
be identified, as the data will be updated over time. To support this research, we attach
an R Notebook file (see S3 File) that not only updates the dataset but is also able to
conduct all the analysis steps, including variable filtering and the compilation of figures.
As a further advantage, this source code can be easily customized and allows researchers
to apply arbitrary time frames during the analysis. Finally, in the Supporting
information, we provide all the relationships identified during the analysis to support
discipline-specific investigations.
