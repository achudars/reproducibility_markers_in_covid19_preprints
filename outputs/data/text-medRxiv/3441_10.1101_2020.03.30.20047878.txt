ABSTRACT
Background
As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, prognostic
markers for early identification of high-risk individuals are an urgent medical need. Italy
has the highest rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the highest number of deaths, and the
highest mortality rate among large countries. Worldwide, a more severe course of
COVID-19 is associated with older age, comorbidities, and male sex. Hence, we
searched for possible genetic components of the peculiar severity of COVID-19
among Italians, by looking at expression levels and variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2
genes, which are crucial for viral infection.
Methods
Exome and SNP array data from a large Italian cohort representative of the
country’s population were used to compare the burden of rare variants and the
frequency of polymorphisms with European and East Asian populations. Moreover,
we looked into gene expression databases to check for sex-unbalanced expression.
Results
While we found no significant evidence that ACE2 is associated with disease
severity/sex bias in the Italian population, TMPRSS2 levels and genetic variants
proved to be possible candidate disease modulators, contributing to the observed
epidemiological data among Italian patients.
Conclusions
Our analysis suggests a role for TMPRSS2 variants and expression levels in
modulating COVID-19 severity, a hypothesis that fosters a rapid experimental
validation on large cohorts of patients with different clinical manifestations.

INTRODUCTION
As we write, Italy, Europe, and the entire world are facing one of the worst medical
emergencies spanning centuries, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemia due to infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus. The early identification of risk factors
for COVID-19 is an urgent medical need to provide the appropriate support to patients,
including access to intensive care units.
Presently, Italy has one of the highest rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the world
among large countries, with 143 cases per 100,000 people, the highest number of
deaths and the highest mortality rate, 10.5% vs. an average value of 4.6% (as of March
28th, 2020, data from https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). These data may have
different explanations, including: 1) the number of tests performed, 2) the structure of
the

population

(Italy

has

the

oldest

population

in

Europe)

[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database], 3) the percentage of smokers, even
though no significant association was found between smoking and severity of COVID19 in a very recent study on the Chinese population,1 4) the possible existence of a
different virus strain,2 5) the concentration of severe cases in a limited region of the
country, potentially overwhelming the available intensive care units, as well as 6)
differences in environmental factors (e.g. air pollution). However, there could also be
some peculiar genetic characteristics of the Italian population that may have an impact
on the susceptibility to viral infection, the disease severity, and the number of patients
shedding huge amounts of virus.
What is unquestionable is a more severe course of the disease associated with older
age and high number of comorbidities and with the male sex (male:female ratio in case
fatality rate among Italians 1.75, data from the Italian National Institute of Health:
https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/), a feature shared with the 2003 SARS
epidemic and MERS.3-5 Indeed, while men and women have similar susceptibility to
both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, men are more prone to have higher severity and
mortality, independently of age.3 Among the many possible factors impacting on sexrelated differences in disease manifestations, including the fact that females are
known to mount a stronger immune response to viral infections compared to males
due to more robust humoral and cellular immune responses,6 we decided to center
our attention on possible genetic components, with a particular focus on the Italian
population.

It was recently demonstrated that both angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and
the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are crucial for SARS-CoV-2 entry
into host cells.7,8 While ACE2 is the main receptor for the spike (S) protein of both
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, mediating viral attachment to target cells, TMPRSS2
cleaves protein S at the S1/S2 and the S2 ’sites, allowing fusion of viral and cellular
membranes.8 Both genes have been proposed to modulate susceptibility to SARSCoV,9,10 and are good candidates to mediate sex-related effects: ACE2 is located on
the X chromosome, while TMPRSS2 expression is responsive to androgen/estrogen
stimulation.11
METHODS
Gene expression data
Expression data for ACE and TMPRSS2 genes were obtained through the: 1)
genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) database (https://gtexportal.org/home/), which
was also used to extract quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for the two genes (all data based
on RNAseq experiments); and 2) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). In particular, two GEO datasets were extracted
and analyzed: 1) GSE66499, reporting microarray data on 152 normal lung samples
from Caucasian individuals; 2) GSE19804, reporting microarray data on 60 normal
lung samples from Taiwanese females.
Genetic data
Genetic data for general European and East Asian populations were retrieved through
the GnomAD repository, which contains data on a total of 125,748 exomes and 71,702
genomes (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/).
As for Italians, details on whole-exome sequencing (on 3,984 individuals) and
genome-wide microarray genotyping (on 3,284 individuals) of the analyzed cohort are
specified elsewhere.12-14 Imputation procedures are detailed in Supplementary
materials.

Expression levels were compared by using either the Kruskal-Wallis test (RNAseq
data) or the student t test (microarray data). Allele frequencies were compared using
the chi square test. All calculations were performed using the R software
(https://www.r-project.org/). P values are presented as non-corrected for multiple

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
ACE2
For most X-chromosome genes, the double allelic dosage in women is balanced by
the epigenetic silencing of one of the X chromosomes in early development.15
However, the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is incomplete in humans and up to one
third of genes are expressed from both alleles, with the degree of XCI escape varying
between genes and individuals.16 ACE2 is one of the genes escaping X inactivation,
but it belongs to a subgroup of X-chromosome genes escaping XCI showing an
uncharacteristically heterogeneous pattern of male-female expression, with higher
expression in men in several tissues.17 Specifically concerning the lung, a recent
analysis on published expression data, reported a substantial similar level of ACE2
transcript in men and women,18 however, another study, using single-cell sequencing,
found a higher expression of ACE2 in Asian men.19 Supplementary Figure 1 reports
data on ACE2 mRNA expression levels in the lung as retrieved from the largest
datasets available in the literature; no substantial differences were found between
males and females, nor between younger and older women, thus confirming what
already observed by Cai and colleagues.18
Another possible sex-related effect might be due to the fact that males are hemizygous
for the gene, therefore, in the presence of an ACE2 allelic variant increasing disease
susceptibility or severity, men will have all cells expressing the risk variant. Based on
this hypothesis, we looked into the genetic variation in ACE2. A recent manuscript
explored this same topic in different populations using data from public databases. 20
However, a specific analysis of the Italian population is Iacking.
We have therefore exploited the available data on 3,984 exomes obtained from an
Italian cohort representative of the whole country12,13 to extract the variants in exons
and splice junctions of ACE2. Variants were filtered for quality and classified according
to their predicted effect at protein level and on splicing. Concerning rare variants (i.e.
those with a minor allele frequency, MAF, <1%; to be used in burden tests), we
considered only null variants, abolishing or significantly impairing protein production
(nonsense, out-of-frame ins/dels, and splicing variants), and missense variants
predicted to be deleterious or possibly deleterious by all the 5 prediction algorithms
used (see Supplementary Methods). Concerning common variants (i.e., MAF>5%), all

were retained for comparing their frequency with those of the European (non Finnish)
and East Asian populations, retrieved from the GnomAD repository.
No significant differences in the burden of rare deleterious variants were observed
comparing the Italian population with Europeans and East Asians (Table 1A).
Concerning common exonic variants, the only striking difference, as also noticed by
Cao and colleagues,20 was observed for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
rs2285666 (also called G8790A), with the frequency of the rare A allele being 0.2 in
Italians and Europeans, and 0.55 in East Asians (P=2.2*10-16 for difference in Italians
vs East Asians; Table 1B). This variant was extensively studied as a potential risk
factor for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease,21,22 hence
possibly constituting a predisposing factor also for the comorbidities observed in
COVID-19 patients. A single paper reports the association of the three rs2285666
genotypes with ACE2 protein level measured in serum by ELISA, with the A/A
genotype having an expression level almost 50% higher than the G/G genotype.23
Given the position of the variant, at nucleotide +4 in the donor splice site of intron 3
(c.439+4G>A), we calculated the predicted effect on splicing and indeed the
substitution of G with an A is predicted to increase the strength of the splice site of
about 9.2% (calculation made through the Human Splicing Finder v.3.1 webtool,
http://www.umd.be/HSF/), consistently with the higher level of ACE2 protein in serum.
It would be crucial to compare the frequency of this variant with ACE2 expression in
the lung and with susceptibility to viral infection and severity of COVID-19
manifestations. Of note, no eQTL for ACE2 in the lung has been described so far in
the GTEx database, and investigations on this topic are recommended.
TMPRSS2
Our second candidate is TMPRSS2. This gene is well known to oncologists as genetic
rearrangements producing a fusion between TMPRSS2 and ERG (or, more rarely,
other members of the ETS family) are the most frequent genetic lesions in prostate
cancer patients.24 As TMPRSS2 is an androgen responsive gene, the fusion results in
androgen dependent transcription of ERG in prostate tumor cells. Therefore, we can
hypothesize that men might have higher TMPRSS2 expression also in the lung, which
might improve the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells by promoting membrane fusion.
Looking into GTEx and GEO data , the overall expression of TMPRSS2 in the lung is
only slightly increased in men (P=0.029; Figure 1A). However, TMPRSS2 expression

is also promoted by estrogens,11 and therefore the situation might be different when
considering individuals above 60 years, who are at higher risk of fatal events due to
COVID-19, as in this group women will all be postmenopausal. According to this
hypothesis, we checked the expression of the gene in lungs of men and females at
different ages, but no substantial differences emerged between males and females
(neither below, nor above 60 years of age; data not shown).
Finally, we explored genetic variation in TMPRSS2 in search of variants, possibly
already annotated as eQTL in the lung, which might have an impact on the serine
protease expression as well as on its catalytic activity. Again, we used the available
Italian exome data, as well as data deposited in GnomAD.25
Firstly, we looked at the overall burden of deleterious rare variants, using the variant
classification described above. Italians had a significant decrease in the burden of
deleterious variants compared to Europeans (P=0.039; Table 2A) suggesting that they
might have a higher level of TMPRSS2 protein/activity, which in principle should be a
risk factor for more severe disease course. This is even more true for the East Asian
population, however, in this case, we must consider that the number of individuals
over 65 years of age in Italy is more than double the one in the Hubei province (22.7
vs. 10%, respectively) and this is a major determinant of disease lethality.
Focusing specifically on common exonic variants, 4 SNPs showed significantly
(P<2.2*10-16) different frequencies when comparing the Italian population with East
Asians (and with Europeans) (Table 2B); 3 of them are synonymous variants, whereas
one is the missense substitution p.Val160Met, which impacts on a residue far from the
serine protease catalytic triad. This variant was previously found significantly
associated with genomic rearrangements involving TMPRSS2, with the risk of prostate
cancer26 and with shorter time to prostate cancer diagnosis for high-risk patients.27
Concerning eQTLs, a number of variants significantly impacting on TMPRSS2
expression in the lung (GTex data) are reported in the 3’ region of the gene (Figure
1B). In Table 2C, a list of the most significant (P<1*10-8), together with their GnomAD
frequencies in the East Asian and European populations, are reported. As for the
Italian frequencies, we took advantage of the genome-wide association study (GWAS)
performed on the above-described cohort (for a total of 3,284 individuals);14 in this
case, we had to infer genotype frequencies by an imputation approach (for details, see
Supplementary Methods). Interestingly, all these eQTLs appear to have extremely

different frequencies among populations. In particular, 2 different haplotypes can be
inferred from frequency data:
1) A frequent “European” haplotype (composed at least of SNPs rs463727,
rs34624090,

rs55964536,

rs734056,

rs4290734,

rs34783969,

rs11702475,

rs35899679, and rs35041537), which is totally absent in the Asian population.
Interestingly, this haplotype has been functionally linked to another eQTL (rs8134378),
located at a known androgen-responsive enhancer for TMPRSS2, 13 kb upstream of
the TMPRSS2 transcription start site28 (Figure 1B). Hence, this haplotype is expected
to up regulate TMPRSS2 gene expression in an androgen-specific way.
2) A second haplotype, predicted to be associated with higher TMPRSS2 expression,
is characterized by 3 SNPs (rs2070788, rs9974589, rs7364083), whose MAF is
significantly increased in Europeans (9% increase in Italians respect to East Asians,
P<1.9*10-10). Importantly, a small-scale GWAS, comparing the distribution of genetic
variants in severe and mild cases of patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza, identified
rs2070788 as being associated with increased risk to both human A(H7N9) and severe
A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza.10 Of note, also in A(H7N9) influenza, the proportion of male
patients was more than double that of female patients.29
Limitations and conclusions
We are aware of the limitations of our study: first of all we focused our attention only
to two candidate genes identified on the basis of their crucial role in viral infection and
on the a priori probability that they might mediate sex-specific effects. A number of
other X-linked genes (such as IL13, IL4, IL10, XIST, TLR7, FOXP3) and Y-linked
genes (SRY, SOX9) may underlie sexually dimorphic immune responses.30 Moreover,
the number of non-genetic determinants of sex-biased severity and case fatality rates
is huge and probably has to do not only with sex differences in both innate and
adaptive immune responses,6 but also with gender and cultural habits in different
countries.
In conclusion, we have explored possible genetic components impacting on the sexbiased severity of COVID-19, focusing on effects mediated by ACE2 and TMPRSS2
genes in the Italian population. From available data, it seems unlikely that sexdifferences in ACE2 levels can explain sex differences in disease severity. However,
it remains to be evaluated if changes in ACE2 levels in the lung correlate with
susceptibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Experimental data from patients

with different disease manifestations are urgently needed. Among the analyzed
hypotheses, the most interesting signals refer to sex-related differences in TMPRSS2
expression and in genetic variation in TMPRSS2. In particular, we identified an exonic
variant (p.Val160Met) and 2 distinct haplotypes showing profound frequency
differences between East Asians and Italians. The rare alleles of these haplotypes, all
predicted to induce higher levels of TMPRSS2, are more frequent in the Italian than in
the East Asian population; in one case, the haplotype could be regulated through
androgens (possibly explaining the sex bias in COVID-19 severity?), in the other case,
a SNP belonging to the haplotype has been associated with increased susceptibility
to influenza, possibly related to a higher susceptibility in Italians and Europeans.
Our data, beside suggesting possible explanations for the unusually high, relative to
known data, lethality rates among Italians, provide reference frequencies in the
general Italian population for candidate variants that can be compared to genetic data
from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 with different disease manifestations, as soon
as they will be available on large numbers of patients. These studies will hopefully
help to identify useful prognostic markers to stratify patients and provide the best care
to high-risk individuals.

FIGURE

Figure 1: TMPRSS2 expression levels and eQTLs
A) Both panels show TMPRSS2 mRNA expression levels in human normal lung
samples stratified according to sex. On the left, data were retrieved for a total of 578
RNAseq experiments from the GTex repository. Expression levels are reported as
transcripts per kilobase million (TPM). On the right, data were collected for a total of
170 microarray experiments from the GEO database. Expression levels are reported
as normalized signal intensities. P values were calculated by using either the KruskalWallis or the student t test.

B) Screenshot from the UCSC Genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/;
GRCh37/hg19) highlighting the TMPRSS2 region (coordinates chr21: 42,835,00042,905,000). The panel shows the following tracks: i) the ruler with the scale at the
genomic level; ii) chromosome 21 nucleotide numbering; iii) the UCSC RefSeq track;
iv) enhancers (grey and red bars) from GeneHancer database; v) interactions (curved
lines) connecting GeneHancer regulatory elements and genes: all curved lines
converge towards the androgen-responsive enhancer for the TMPRSS2 gene
described by Clinckemalie and colleagues.28

Total allele counts, carrier allele counts, and carrier frequencies are shown; only deleterious
variants with MAF less than 1% were considered in the burden analysis. The ‘deleterious’ set
is defined by missense variations predicted to be possibly damaging by all the 5 algorithms
used (LRT score, MutationTaster, PolyPhen-2 HumDiv, PolyPhen-2 HumVar, and SIFT), and
loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, and splicing variants affecting the
donor/acceptor sites).
