Key Points
Question:

How did documentation of psychiatric symptoms in outpatient and emergency

room settings change with onset of COVID-19 infection in Eastern Massachusetts?

Findings:

In this cohort study spanning 2 academic medical centers and 3 community

hospitals, prevalence of narrative notes referencing depression or anxiety decreased 75-

81% in outpatient settings following onset of coronavirus in March 2019, and by 44-45% in

emergency departments.

Meaning:

The observation that documentation of psychiatric symptoms declined sharply

with increasing coronavirus infection in Massachusetts, even as prevalence of such

symptoms is anticipated to increase, suggests additional efforts may be required to address

these symptoms in the context of COVID-19.

Introduction

The emergence of the worldwide coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated

with increased burden of psychiatric symptoms among healthcare workers and the general

public,

12 which may increase risk

for longer-term sequelae

34. At the same time, the need for

quarantine and the strain on clinical resources may reduce the ability of health systems to

respond to such symptoms. To quantify shifts in psychiatric evaluation associated with

COVID-19, we utilized electronic health records (EHR) from 2 large academic medical

centers and 3 affiliated community hospitals. We investigated documentation of psychiatric

symptoms among narrative clinical notes as disease activity increased in Eastern

Massachusetts.

Methods
The cohort included all individuals seen in outpatient visits or emergency rooms between

January 2, 2019 and March 25, 2020. Sociodemographic data including age, sex, race, and

5

ethnicity were drawn from the Partners Research Patient Data Registry , along with

narrative clinical notes. Presence of depression, anxiety, suicide, psychosis, and violence

was determined by identifying terms drawn from an expert-curated list associated with

6

NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) . These terms included depressed, depressive,

dysphoric, dysthymic, sad, tearful; anxiety, anxious, fearful, frighten, hypervigilant, nervous,

panic, phobia, phobic, scared, stress, tense, worried; suicide, suicidal, suicidality; psychotic,

psychosis, hallucination, delusion, paranoid, paranoia, hallucinate, hallucinated, delusional;

violence, violent.

Presence of a coronavirus test was determined from the enterprise laboratory feed

(LOINC:94309-2). The Partners HealthCare Human Research Committee approved the

study protocol.

Primary analysis quantified volume of documentation by individual symptoms by week.

Logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between presence of coronavirus

testing and psychiatric symptoms, adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, using R 3.6.0.

Notes were treated as clustered within-individual, and limited to those occurring at or

before time of testing. STROBE reporting guidelines were followed.

Results

A total of 205,957 emergency department and 2,483,159 outpatient notes were analyzed

(Table 1) representing 60,428 and 541,307 patients, respectively (Supplemental Table 1).

Figure 1 illustrates frequency of coronavirus testing (panel A) by week, and frequency of

psychiatric terms in notes. The initial 2 decrements in terms correspond to 4-day weeks.

Notes with mentions of depression decreased from 1,446 to 816 (i.e., by 44%) for ED and

49,132 to 9,315 (i.e., by 81%) for outpatient from a weekly average in January and

February, excluding holidays, to the week spanning 3/19/2020-3/25/2020. Similar

patterns were observed for other symptoms.

In the ED setting, where violence was referenced, odds of testing were increased by nearly

50% (OR 1.487, 95% CI 1.249-1.761) (Table 2). In the outpatient setting, notes with

presence of psychiatric terms were associated with reduction in likelihood of coronavirus

testing for an individual patient (Table 2), with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 0.795

(95% CI 0.770-0.821) for anxiety to 0.631 (95% CI 0.563-0.705) for psychosis.

Discussion

In this EHR study, we detect marked reduction in notes (including those from telemedicine)

documenting psychiatric symptoms, paralleling the emergence of COVID-19 diagnoses in

the Boston area. During this period outpatient visits were cancelled, individuals likely

became more reluctant to come to the ED, and clinicians seeking to reduce exposure may

have conducted more focused interviews. Conversely, among ED evaluations, while most

symptoms were not associated with testing, reference to violence was associated with

greater likelihood of testing, perhaps reflecting a shift in clinical presentations.

Limitations

Limitations of these results include the reliance on simple string-matching, and the unclear

generalizability from these 5 hospitals to other regions.

Conclusions

Nonetheless, our results indicate an acute reduction in assessment and documentation of

2

psychiatric symptoms. In light of survey data , one might expect to see an increase rather

than decrease in psychiatric presentations in Boston-area hospitals. Efforts to provide more

accessible psychiatric care during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic may become

particularly important: symptoms are likely to be increasing, while access is objectively

decreasing. Strategies such as telemedicine are urgently needed to ensure that another

consequence of the pandemic is not neglect of psychiatric illness.
