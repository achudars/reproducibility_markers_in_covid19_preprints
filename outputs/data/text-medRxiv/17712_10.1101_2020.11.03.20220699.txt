Abstract

60

Background

61

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. Healthcare workers (HCWs)

62

are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than the general population but risk factors for HCW

63

infection are not well described.

64

Methods

65

We conducted a prospective sero-epidemiological study of HCWs at a UK teaching hospital using a

66

SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Risk factors for seropositivity were analysed using multivariate logistic

67

regression.

68

Findings

69

410/5,698 (7·2%) staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seroprevalence was higher in

70

those working in designated COVID-19 areas compared with other areas (9·47% versus 6·16%)

71

Healthcare assistants (aOR 2·06 [95%CI 1·14-3·71]; p=0·016) and domestic and portering staff (aOR

72

3·45 [95% CI 1·07-11·42]; p=0·039) had significantly higher seroprevalence than other staff groups

73

after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity and COVID-19 working location. Staff working in acute

74

medicine and medical sub-specialities were also at higher risk (aOR 2·07 [95% CI 1·31-3·25];

75

p<0·002). Staff from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds had an aOR of 1·65

76

(95% CI 1·32 – 2·07; p<0·001) compared to white staff; this increased risk was independent of

77

COVID-19 area working. The only symptoms significantly associated with seropositivity in a

78

multivariable model were loss of sense of taste or smell, fever and myalgia; 31% of staff testing

79

positive reported no prior symptoms.

80

Interpretation

81

Risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs is heterogeneous and influenced by COVID-19

82

working location, role, age and ethnicity. Increased risk amongst BAME staff cannot be accounted for

83

solely by occupational factors.

Research in context

89

Evidence before this study

90

Specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) are not well defined.

91

Additionally, it is not clear how population level risk factors influence occupational risk in defined

92

demographic groups. Only by identifying these factors can we mitigate and reduce the risk of

93

occupational SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed a review of the evidence for HCW-specific risk

94

factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched PubMed with the terms “SARS-CoV-2” OR

95

“COVID-19” AND “Healthcare worker” OR “Healthcare Personnel” AND “Risk factor” to identify

96

any studies published in any language between December 2019 and September 2020. The search

97

identified 266 studies and included a meta-analysis and two observational studies assessing HCW

98

cohort seroprevalence data. Seroprevalence and risk factors for HCW infections varied between

99

studies, with contradictory findings. In the two serological studies, one identified a significant

100

increased risk of seroprevalence in those working with COVID-19 patients (Eyre et al 2020), as well

101

as associations with job role and department. The other study (Dimcheff et al 2020) found no

102

significant association between seropositivity and any identified demographic or occupational factor.

103

A meta-analysis of HCW (Gomez-Ochoa et al 2020) assessed >230,000 participants as a pooled

104

analysis, including diagnoses by both RT-PCR and seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and

105

found great heterogeneity in study design and reported contradictory findings. Of note, they report a

106

seropositivity rate of 7% across all studies reporting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs. Nurses were

107

the most frequently affected healthcare personnel and staff working in non-emergency inpatient

108

settings were the most frequently affected group. Our search found no prospective studies

109

systematically evaluating HCW specific risk factors based entirely on seroprevalence data.

110
111

Added value of this study

112

Our prospective cohort study of almost 6,000 HCWs at a large UK teaching hospital strengthens

113

previous findings from UK-based cohorts in identifying an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure

114

amongst HCWs. Specifically, factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure include caring for

115

confirmed COVID-19 cases and identifying as being within specific ethnic groups (BAME staff). We

116

further delineated the risk amongst BAME staff and demonstrate that occupational factors alone do

117

not account for all of the increased risk amongst this group. We demonstrate for the first time that

118

healthcare assistants represent a key at-risk occupational group, and challenge previous findings of

119

significantly higher risk amongst nursing staff. Seroprevalence in staff not working in areas with

120

confirmed COVID-19 patients was only marginally higher than that of the general population within

121

the same geographical region. This observation could suggest the increased risk amongst HCWs

122

arises through occupational exposure to confirmed cases and could account for the overall higher

123

seroprevalence in HCWs, rather than purely the presence of staff in healthcare facilities.

124

Over 30% of seropositive staff had not reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and in those

125

who did report symptoms, differentiating COVID-19 from other causes based on symptom data alone

126

was unreliable.

127
128

Implications of all the available evidence

129

International efforts to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs need to be

130

prioritised. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs is heterogenous but also follows

131

demonstrable patterns. Potential mechanisms to reduce the risk for staff working in areas with

132

confirmed COVID-19 patients include improved training in hand hygiene and personal protective

133

equipment (PPE), better access to high quality PPE, and frequent asymptomatic testing. Wider

134

asymptomatic testing in healthcare facilities has the potential to reduce spread of SARS-CoV-2 within

135

hospitals, thereby reducing patient and staff risk and limiting spread between hospitals and into the

136

wider community. The increased risk of COVID-19 amongst BAME staff cannot be explained by

137

purely occupational factors; however, the increased risk amongst minority ethnic groups identified

138

here was stark and necessitates further evaluation.

144

Background

145

With >30 million cases and >1 million deaths reported to date globally, the ongoing COVID-19

146

pandemic continues to impact daily life1. A nationwide lockdown in the UK on 23rd March 2020

147

succeeded in slowing infection rates2; however, a rising number of infections are now being observed

148

with the easing of lockdown measures3. The logistics of managing patients with COVID-19 presented

149

unique challenges to hospitals and NHS trusts across the UK; evidence and practices evolved rapidly

150

as experience was gained. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection

151

than the general population4,5, and some contradictory evidence is emerging for risk factors associated

152

with SARS-CoV-2 infection in front-line HCWs6-8. Protecting HCWs by identifying risk factors for

153

SARS-CoV-2 infection as the UK continues to see an increase in COVID-19 diagnoses is paramount3.

154

Controlling transmission within a hospital setting, as well as from hospitals back into the community,

155

is key for controlling the pandemic9,10. However, defining HCW specific risk-factors remains a

156

challenge. Additionally, higher rates of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation and

157

death have been observed amongst patients from ethnic minority populations in the UK11 and

158

worldwide12,13; the reasons for this disparity are unclear. Reported infections in HCW suggests higher

159

mortality in HCWs from minority backgrounds14; however, it is not yet clear to what extent workplace

160

exposures influence infection. Here, we present the results of a large sero-epidemiological study of

161

SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in staff at a teaching hospital in the East of England.

162
163

Methods

164

Setting

165

Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH) is a tertiary referral centre and

166

teaching hospital with 1,000 beds and 11,545 staff serving a population of 580,000 people in the East

167

of England. The facility is equipped with a 20-bed ICU, a 23-bed neurosciences and trauma ICU, and

168

an Emergency Department that receives ~14,000 attendees a month. Between March and June 2020,

169

CUH treated 525 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (Figure 1). The peak of COVID-19

170

admissions occurred in late March and early April 2020, with comparatively few COVID-19

171

admissions from June 2020 onwards. The definition of COVID-19 working for the purpose of risk

172

stratification included clinical areas designated as either “Red” (patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-

173

CoV-2 infection) or “Amber” (patients for whom there is a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19).

174
175

As of September 2020, the East of England reported 27,516 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-

176

CoV-2 infection15, with a corresponding population rate of 441·2 per 100,000 people to date. This rate

177

is substantially less than the worst affected regions of North West England (772·9/100,000) and

178

Yorkshire and the Humber (693·2/100,000)15. According to the 2011 England and Wales census16

179

85·3% of the population of the East of England are White British, 5·5% are White Other, 4·8% are

180

Asian, 2% are Black, and 1·9% are of Mixed ethnicity. The proportion of Black, Asian, and Minority

181

Ethnic (BAME) staff employed at CUH is representative of the overall NHS workforce17 (21·2% vs

182

20·7%, respectively).

183
184

An asymptomatic staff screening programme using SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was established in

185

April 202018. A staff screening programme for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing was commenced on

186

the 10th June 2020. All staff members were invited by email to participate in the serological screening

187

programme and asked to self-refer for a clinic appointment. Written informed consent was obtained

188

from all participants. As part of this process all participants were invited to join the NIHR

189

BioResource – COVID-19 Research Cohort (IRAS 220277). At enrolment, participants completed a

190

questionnaire asking about demographic characteristics, healthcare role, ethnicity, previous symptoms

191

consistent with COVID-19 and previous results of SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. A total of 7·8 ml of

192

blood was collected, including one serum sample and one whole blood sample. The serum sample was

193

assayed for total SARS-CoV-2 antibody; both residual serum and whole blood were stored for future

194

analyses.

195
196

Laboratory assays

Serological testing for antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 was performed using the Centaur XP

199

automated high throughput enzyme linked chemiluminescent bridging immunoassay which targets the

200

S1RBD antigen of SARS-CoV-2 and can detect all Ig subclasses (IgG, IgM, and IgA). The quantity

201

of SARS-CoV2 antibodies correlates directly with relative light units (RLU), which is converted to

202

Index Values with a measuring interval of 0.05 ->10 index, where values below 1 are reported as

203

nonreactive and those ≥1.0 are reported as reactive, as validated by the manufacturer by clinical

204

correlation. The method was independently validated by Public Health England and has a reported

205

sensitivity and specificity of 98.1% (95% CI 96.6 – 99.1) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.4 – 100)19

206

respectively. Samples were processed in the Biochemistry laboratory at CUH following the SOP as

207

stated by the manufacturer in their Instruction for Use (IFU) after a local verification using guidance

208

from The Royal College of Pathologists20.

209
210

As previously described, the RT-PCR assay used at CUH designates a cycle threshold (Ct) of ≤36 to

211

correspond to a positive result18.

212
213

Statistical analysis

214

Seroprevalence is reported as a percentage ([proportion with antibodies/number tested] x 100).

215

Logistic regression was used for univariable and multivariable analyses of seroprevalence

216

comparisons. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparison of median Ct values. Data were

217

analysed using Stata v14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).

226

The CUH staff serology screening clinic was operational between 10th June and 7 August 2020. A

227

total of 8,376 (73%) staff attended the clinic for SARS-CoV-2 serology; 5,697/8,376 (68%) of these

228

consented to be enrolled in the study (Figure 2). 1,700/5,967 (28·5%) of study participants reported

229

that they had worked in a designated COVID-19 area within the CUH structure during the peak of the

230

epidemic between February and June 2020. The median age of participants was 38 years (range 17-83

231

years) and 22·7% (1,293/5,697) were male (Table 1). A total of 22 staff required hospital admission

232

for COVID-19. No CUH staff members died.

233
234
235

Seroprevalence

236

The overall seroprevalence of total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies amongst all staff in this study was 7·2%

237

(410/5,698). Amongst those reporting having worked in a dedicated COVID-19 area between

238

February and June 2020, the seroprevalence increased to 9·5% (169/1,784; Table 2). Conversely, the

239

comparable seroprevalence in those reporting they had never worked in COVID-19 area was 6·2%

240

(241/3,913; p<0·0001). The prevalence of seropositivity in male staff (8·0%; 104/1293) was not

241

significantly different (p=0·18) than that observed in female staff (6·95%; 306/4404). The risk of

242

seropositivity decreased with age, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0·83 (95% CI 0·76 – 0·91) for every 10-

243

year increase in age (p<0·0001).

244
245

Occupation

246

On univariate analysis, a number of HCW roles were associated with greater risk of the detection of

247

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Nursing staff (OR 1·68 [95% CI 1·04 – 2·71]; p=0·033), healthcare

248

assistants (HCAs) (OR 2·63 [95% CI 1·48 – 4·86]; p=0·001) physiotherapists (OR 2·48 [95% CI 1·08

249

– 5·69]; p=0·032) and porters and domestic staff (OR 3·60 [95% CI 1·13 – 11·44]; p=0·03) all

250

displayed a higher risk compared to administrative staff (Table 2), who had the lowest seroprevalence

251

at 4·6% (19/412). Security staff at CUH are employed by a third-party contractor and did not attend

252

the staff serology testing clinic.

254

Division/department

255

Staff departments at CUH are separated into six “Divisions” (Table 3). Risk differed significantly by

256

division (p value for the likelihood ratio test of the overall effect of division <0·001). Staff working

257

within Division C (primarily acute medicine, medical sub-specialities and Emergency Department)

258

had a significantly higher seroprevalence (OR 2·8 [95% CI 1·82 – 4·33] p<0·0001) compared to staff

259

working in Division E (paediatrics and maternity), who had the lowest seroprevalence (5·0%; 38/741).

260

Staff working specifically in the ICUs had a seroprevalence of 6·33% (10/158), and staff working

261

specifically in the Emergency Department had a seroprevalence of 9·1% (9/99). However, neither of

262

these staff groups had significantly different seropositivity using univariate analysis (p>0·1 in both

263

groups) compared to non-ICU and non-Emergency Department staff respectively.

264
265

Ethnicity

266

We observed substantial heterogeneity in the proportion of seropositivity between self-reported ethnic

267

groups (Table 2). Staff identifying as White had an overall seropositivity rate of 6·1%. In comparison,

268

Asian staff (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi/Other Asian) and Black staff (Black African/Black

269

Caribbean/Other black) had a seroprevalence of 11·0% (85/771) and 18·3% (22/120), respectively.

270

White staff were more likely to have reported symptoms than Asian or Black staff (29%, 28% and

271

19% respectively). Despite this, seroconversion following symptoms consistent with COVID-19 was

272

significantly higher in Black staff (p=0·002) and in Asian staff (p<0·001) compared to white staff;

273

41% (9/22), 26·6% (54/203), and 14·1% (148/1052) of staff had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after

274

reporting consistent symptoms in Black, Asian and White staff, respectively. The proportion of staff

275

reporting having worked in a COVID-19 area was 38·5%, 60·3% and 32·1% for Black, Asian and

276

White staff, respectively.

277
278

Multivariable analyses

279

After describing several variables associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in a univariate analysis

280

we included these variables to assess the risk associated with age, sex, ethnicity, job role and COVID-

281

working status in a multivariable model. Increasing age remained protective for seropositivity on

282

multivariable analysis (aOR 0·85 per 10 years increase in age [95% CI 0·78 – 0·93]; p<0·001). The

283

aOR of having detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in those that reported working in COVID-19 areas

284

was 1·50 (95% CI 1·22 – 1·84; p<0·0001). Nursing staff and physiotherapists were no longer

285

significantly associated with seropositivity on multivariable analysis (Table 2, Figure 3). HCAs

286

remained at a significantly higher risk of being seropositive (aOR 2·06 [95% CI 1·14 – 3·71 – 2·4];

287

p=0·016), as were domestic and portering staff (aOR 3·45 [95% CI 1·07 – 11·2]; p=0·039). In a

289

medicine, medical sub-specialities and Emergency Department) had an aOR of 2·07 (95% CI 1·31 –

290

3·25) for seropositivity (p=0·002) after controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, job role and COVID-19 area

291

working.

292
293

Ethnicity remained strongly associated with seropositivity (Table 2, Figure 4). The aORs in Asian and

294

black staff in the multivariable model were 1·69 (95% CI 1·30 – 2·19; p<0·0001) and 3·42 (95% CI

295

2·12 – 5·53; p<0·0001), respectively (Table 2). There was no significant evidence that the effect of

296

ethnicity was modified by COVID working location (p value of interaction 0·96), and we also

297

observed a similar increase in risk associated with ethnicity when data were stratified by CUH

298

COVID-19 working location. For Asian staff, the aOR for seroconversion was 1·59 (95% CI 1·09 –

299

2·32; p=0·016) for those working in COVID-19 areas compared to 1·76 (95% CI 1·21 – 2·55;

300

p=0·003) for those not working in COVID-19 areas. For black staff the aOR for seroconversion when

301

working in COVID-19 areas was 3·91 (95% CI 1·78 – 8·59; p=0·001), compared to 3·06 (95% CI 1·65

302

– 5·64; p<0·001) who reported working in a non-COVID-19 area.

303
304

The aOR for seropositivity in staff self-reporting as BAME (as a binary variable compared to white

305

staff in a separate multivariable model) was 1·65 (95% CI 1·32 – 2·07; p<0·0001) after controlling for

306

age, sex, job role and COVID-19 working location. For staff self-reporting as BAME, the aOR for

307

seroconversion was 1·59 (95% CI 1·13 – 2·23; p=0·007) for those working in COVID-19 areas and

308

1·68 (95% CI 1·23 – 2·39; p=0·001) for those who reported not working in a COVID-19 area during

309

the epidemic.

Symptoms

312

Participants were asked about any symptoms consistent with COVID-19 since February 2020.

313

Critically, seroprevalence was significantly higher in the group with symptoms (17·2%; 266/1,548) in

314

comparison to those without symptoms (3·1%; 117/3827, p<0·0001). Almost 31% (126/410) of

315

seropositive HCWs reported not having any symptoms consistent with COVID-19 since February

316

2020. After adjusting for age, sex and ethnicity, the aOR of seropositivity was 6·97 (95% CI 5·54 –

317

8·78; p<0·0001) in the group who reported prior symptoms compared to those who did not. The loss

318

of the sense of taste or smell was the strongest predictor of seropositivity on univariate analysis;

319

however, only 44% (154/351) of those reporting the loss of taste or smell were seropositive (Table 5).

320

In a multivariable logistic regression model containing all collected symptoms (Table 5), loss of sense

321

of taste or smell (aOR 7·85 [95% CI 5·79 – 10·65], p<0·0001), myalgia (aOR 1·71 [95% CI 1·18 –

322

2·48], p<0·0005) and fever (aOR 1·44 [95% CI 1·02 – 2·04], p<0·038) were the only symptoms

323

positively associated with seropositivity. Notably, reporting a sore throat at the time of symptoms was

324

negatively associated with seropositivity (aOR 0·7 [95% CI 0·50 – 0·99], p=0·043) in the

325

multivariable model.

326
327

Seroconversion after positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR

328

From 5,991 enrolled participants, 2,825 (47%) reported having had a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test between

329

February 2020 and the time of blood sampling, primarily through the CUH HCW testing programme.

330

Of these, 51 (2·05%) tested PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 47 had detectable SARS-CoV-2

331

antibodies, and four had no detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The median SARS-CoV-2 PCR Ct

332

value in those who seroconverted was 30 (IQR 24 – 34), in comparison to 36 (IQR 35·5 – 37) in those

333

who did not seroconvert (p=0·006). The four staff who had previously tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR

334

positive and were antibody negative all reported having symptoms consistent with COVID-19

335

infection at the time of PCR testing, although none reported the loss of taste or smell. Nine (18%) of

336

the staff previously testing SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive, and who were antibody positive, were

337

asymptomatic at the time of PCR testing.

Interpretation

340

In this comprehensive assessment of factors associated with seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2

341

antibodies in HCWs at a large UK tertiary referral centre we were able to identify key at-risk

342

occupational groups. Specifically, staff working in areas where patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2

343

infection are cared for, those employed as HCA or domestic and portering staff, those of younger age,

344

and those working in acute medicine or a medical sub-speciality were more likely to have SARS-

345

CoV-2 antibodies. A reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was associated with White ethnicity,

346

being employed in an administrative role or working in paediatric or maternity services, and

347

belonging to an older age group.

348
349

We found that the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in staff working in non-COVID facing

350

areas was slightly higher (6·16%) than in the general population in the East of England (5·0%)21 and

351

comparable to the national prevalence (6·0%)21. This is in keeping with previous retrospective

352

serological HCW studies reporting relatively low seroprevalences in Germany (1·6%)22, Wuhan

353

(3·8%)23 and Belgium (7·6%)24. Amongst Asian staff working at CUH the seroprevalence was also

354

comparable to East of England data (10·5% vs 10·1%, respectively), as was the seroprevalence

355

amongst Black staff at CUH compared to regional data (18% vs 15%, respectively)21. Overall, we

356

observed significantly higher seroprevalence in all BAME staff compared to White staff, and to a

357

greater extent in Black and Asian staff specifically. These differences have been observed nationally

358

and are not unique to HCWs. The finding that the increased risk associated with BAME staff was not

359

influenced by COVID-19 area working, as well as the ethnic differences in symptomatic

360

seroconversion rates, demonstrates that the increased prevalence of antibodies in BAME HCWs

361

cannot be accounted for by purely occupational factors.

362
363

In staff who were previously SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive, 92% (47/51) had detectable antibodies.

364

There was a significant difference in Ct values between those who did and did not seroconvert. A

365

potential explanation for this difference is that higher viral loads may be required to generate a

13

366

sustained antibody response. Alternatively, a false positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result or the detection

367

of viral nucleic acid without infectious virus would also explain a lack of seroconversion.

368
369

Consistent with previous studies, we demonstrate that whilst reporting prior symptoms consistent with

370

COVID-19 increased the chances of seropositivity, differentiating previous COVID-19 infection from

371

other common respiratory tract infections based on symptoms alone is unreliable6. Interestingly, the

372

only symptoms that significantly predicted seropositivity on a multivariable logistic regression model

373

were the loss of sense of taste or smell, myalgia and fever. Prior reporting of cough or shortness of

374

breath were not good predictors of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a multivariable model.

375

These data also reiterate previous findings that asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 infection amongst

376

healthcare workers is common, with 31% of seropositive staff having never reported consistent

377

symptoms, and 18% of PCR positive staff never having reported consistent symptoms. These data

378

highlight the importance of the contribution of the asymptomatically infected population to the spread

379

of the disease25,26. Consequently, asymptomatic screening of staff in healthcare settings should

380

become a component of routine disease survelliance6,18,27.

381
382

We acknowledge several limitations to our study. Variables such as ethnicity, COVID-working

383

location and job role were self-reported; however, we have no reason to think these variables were

384

party to recall bias and it is unlikely to impact on the results to any large degree. The proportion of

385

staff reporting being of Black ethnicity was relatively small, although the proportion of BAME staff is

386

consistent with the wider NHS workforce, and our conclusions are therefore broadly generalisable.

387

The terminology and designation of COVID-facing clinical areas was an evolving factor throughout

388

the course of the epidemic and is likely to be variable between hospital trusts and regions, as will the

389

re-distribution of workforces and workflows through hospitals. Additionally, there will be

390

heterogeneity of infection rates and admission pressures between different regions and between

391

different hospitals within the same regions that may influence HCW exposure to infection differently.

392

Consequently, this variation between practices may impact the specific risk factors assessed in this

393

study to varying extents between different healthcare trusts. We were also unable to assess the use of

394

PPE and adherence to PPE protocols in this study design. The selected assay may have reduced

395

sensitivity in individuals who generated robust antibody responses to other SARS-COV-2 antigens or

396

those producing low affinity antibodies during early disease. Similar considerations apply to other

397

commercial assays28, and a recent comparison demonstrated assay equivalence with the selected

398

platform having higher accuracy19, and an independently reported sensitivity and specificity of 98·1%

399

(95% CI 96·6 – 99·1) and 99·1% (95% CI 99·4 – 100) respectively19. We also note that symptom data

400

were recorded retrospectively, and may have been subject to recall bias.

401
402

Our study provides new information on the risk factors for SARS-COV-2 infection and antibody

403

response in healthcare facilities. We found that the occupational exposure to SARS-COV-2 is

404

heterogenous across job roles, hospital department, and ethnicity. It is clear that HCWs on the

405

frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic require more protection from occupational exposure with

406

accurate stratification of risk factors to develop mitigation strategies. The association with ethnic

407

group is concerning and a deeper understanding of the societal and/or genetic factors predisposing the

408

BAME population to SARS-COV-2 infection and seroconversion is needed.
