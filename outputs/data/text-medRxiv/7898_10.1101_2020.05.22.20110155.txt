Abstract

16

Background

17

COVID-19 is a new coronavirus that has spread from person to person throughout the world.

18

Geographical disease surveillance is a powerful tool to monitor the spread of epidemics and

19

pandemic, providing important information on the location of new hot-spots, assisting public

20

health agencies to implement targeted approaches to minimize mortality.

Methods

22

County level data from January 22-April 28 was downloaded from USAfacts.org to create heat

23

maps with ArcMapTM for diagnosed COVID-19 cases and mortality. The data was analyzed

24

using spatial and space-time scan statistics and the SaTScanTM software, to detect geographical

25

cluster with high incidence and mortality, adjusting for multiple testing. Analyses were adjusted

26

for age. While the spatial clusters represent counties with unusually high counts of COVID-19

27

when averaged over the time period January 22-April 20, the space-time clusters allow us to

28

identify groups of counties in which there exists a significant change over time.

29

Results

30

There were several statistically significant COVID-19 clusters for both incidence and mortality.

31

Top clusters with high rates included the areas in and around New York City, New Orleans and

32

Chicago, but there were also several small rural clusters. Top clusters for a recent surge in

33

incidence and mortality included large parts of the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic Region, and

34

several smaller areas in and around New York and New England.

35

Conclusions

36

Spatial and space-time surveillance of COVID-19 can be useful for public health departments in

37

their efforts to minimize mortality from the disease. It can also be applied to smaller regions with

38

more granular data.

39

Keywords: Clusters, prospective space-time analysis, spatial analysis, COVID-19.

41

Background

42

The COVID-19 pandemic is closely followed around the world, with daily estimates of

43

diagnosed case counts and death for almost every country in the world. [1][2][3] Regional and

44

local numbers are also important. Our focus here is on the cluster analysis methodology used to

45

provide a comprehensive and effective disease surveillance of COVID-19 with which it is

46

possible to summarize results in a clear and meaningful manner where the hotspots (clusters) are

47

located, and to identify where such clusters are located and whether some clusters seem to be

48

emerging or spreading. While descriptive maps of COVID-19 cases or death counts provide

49

useful information on the disease, it can be hard to distinguish random variation from true hot-

50

spots. Spatial and space-time scan statistics can detect groups of neighboring counties with high

51

rates of COVID-19, and determine whether they are statistically significant. The use of heat

52

maps complemented by scan statistics allows us to better understand the geographic distribution

53

of COVID-19 across the contiguous USA.

54

There are various reasons for evaluating the geographical distribution of COVID-19, and each

55

requires a different type of scan statistic. In this paper, we give examples of each type of

56

question and its corresponding scan statistic.

57

COVID-19 will continue to be a major threat to older people until herd immunity arrives, either

58

through natural disease or a potential future vaccine. In order to understand geographical

59

differences in movement along the path towards herd immunity, we can use a purely spatial scan

60

statistic and the cumulative number of diagnoses or deaths as a proportion of the population.

61

While it would be better to use large-scale random antibody testing, that is not yet available.

62

With cumulative data, it is not possible to distinguish areas with a currently high disease

63

incidence versus areas where things used to be bad but where the spread has subsided. For an

64

evaluation of the current situation, it is instead appropriate to only analyze the last one, two or

65

three weeks of data, while still employing the purely spatial scan statistic.

66

A purely spatial analysis with only a few weeks of data cannot distinguish high incident areas

67

that have been high for a while from areas where the incidence is increasing. The detection of the

68

latter is interesting even if they are not yet as high as many other parts of the country. Such

69

analyses can be done using all the cumulative data with a prospective space-time scan statistic,

70

adjusting for geographical differences. In essence, each geographical area is evaluated as to

71

whether the incidence or mortality rate has increased compared to what it used to be in that same

72

area.

73

A fourth option is to do a prospective space-time analysis without adjusting for geography, as

74

performed by. Desjardins et al [4]. Such an analysis detects areas that are high during recent days

75

or weeks, when compared to the national average in both current and past time, while it can but

76

does not have to be higher than the prior rates in the same area. The purpose of such an analysis

77

is hence different from a space-time adjusted analysis that adjusts for geographical variation, and

78

the two types of analysis complements each other.

79
80

In order to illustrate how such a comprehensive set of methods can be applied, we used COVID-

81

19 data for US counties, to evaluate the geographical distribution of infection cases and also for

deaths associated with COVID-19. We created informative heat maps with superimposed cluster

83

rings that identify significant clusters from SaTScanTM based on the Poisson distribution. [5]

84

Materials and Methods

85

86

COVID-19 Data

87

COVID-19 data were obtained from the not-for-profit organization USA facts,

88

at www.usafacts.org. [6] They have in turn obtained the data from the Centers for Disease

89

Control and Prevention. [7] as well as from state and county level public health agencies.

90

Confirmed diagnosed cases and deaths are given as cumulative counts starting January 22, 2020

91

with a daily update. Since only confirmed diagnoses are used, many cases are missed and the

92

proportion of missed cases will depend on the amount of testing conducted, which may vary

93

geographically.

94

For the purely spatial analyses we used data for January 22-April 20 and the two week period of

95

April 7 â€“ April 20. For the space-time analysis we used data for January 22-April 28.

96

Age adjustment

97

COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths vary greatly by age, and since counties have different age

98

distribution, it is important to adjust the spatial analyses for age. For each county, we used the

99

age-specific data from the Census Bureau.[8] For COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths, we used the

100

age-distribution reported by CDC.[9] Age was adjusted for using indirect standardization

101

102

Choropleth Maps

103

For descriptive purposes, choropleth maps were constructed. For the 3,108 counties, the age-

104

adjusted rates were ranked from lowest to highest and sorted into quintiles. In the figures, each

105

county is colored from dark green (lowest COVID-19 rates), to light green, yellow, orange, and

106

dark red (highest COVID-19 rates). The legend gives the range of values for each shade of color,

107

which is different for different maps. This type of coloring allows the reader to quickly scan the

108

US map and to eyeball where parts of the USA have high or low rates of this virus.

109

The Spatial Scan Statistic

110

To detect geographical areas with a statistically significant excess number of COVID-19

111

diagnoses or deaths, we used the spatial scan statistic, a widely used method for geographical

112

disease surveillance. This method detects and determines statistical significance of geographical

113

cluster without having to pre-specify the cluster size or location, while automatically adjusting

114

for the multiple testing that exists in the large number of potential clusters evaluated.

115

The spatial scan statistic applies a moving circular window on the map, centered on each of

116

many possible grid points positioned throughout the study region. County centroids were used

117

for the grid points to ensure that each county could be a potential cluster by itself. For each grid

118

point, the radius of the window is varied continuously in size from zero up to some upper limit

119

that we set to 10% of the total population at risk. This way the circular window is flexible both in

120

location and size. Overall, this method creates many thousands of distinct geographical circles

121

with different sets of neighboring counties within them. Each circle is a possible candidate for a

122

cluster.

123

Using the observed and age-adjusted expected counts for each county, the Poisson distribution

124

was used to model the random nature of the counts. P-values were calculated by fitting the

125

Gumbel distribution to 999 random data sets generated under the null hypothesis of equal risk

126

throughout the country. [10]

127

The Prospective Space-Time Scan Statistic

128

To detect recent increases, a prospective space-time cluster analysis was performed for both

129

COVID-19 cases and for mortality. A nonparametric spatial adjustment was used in order to

130

detect areas with localized temporal increases, while not comparing rates across geographical

131

regions. This means that a cluster can be detected if there is a temporal increase in the area even

132

if that area still has a lower rate than the rest of the country.

133

The prospective space-time scan statistic identifies newly emerged clusters by using a cylindrical

134

three-dimensional scanning window. The circular base is the same as for the purely spatial scan

135

statistic while the height of the cylinder corresponds to time. For each circular location and size,

136

different time lengths are evaluated up to a maximum of 14 days. In the prospective version used

137

here, only cylinders that include the last day of the study period are used, as we are only

138

interested in emerging clusters but not historical ones. The prospective space-time analysis the

139

scan statistic can be used for time-periodic surveillance in which the analysis is repeated each

140

week. [10][11]

141

All analyses were conducted using the free SaTScanTM software (www.satscan.org). [5]

Results

143

Cumulative Data

144

For January 22-April 20, 2020, the geographical distribution of confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses

145

are depicted in Figure 1, with 38 statistically significant clusters (p<0.05). Table 1 provides

146

detailed information on the top 20 clusters with the smallest p-values. The top cluster was in and

147

around New York City, with over ten times as many diagnosed cases compared to the rest of the

148

country. Cluster 2 is in and around New Orleans, Louisiana, with relative risk (RR) 5.7. More

149

unexpectedly, there are several small clusters with very high relative risk, including Marion

150

County, Ohio; Blaine County, Idaho; Lincoln County, Arkansas; and Louisa County, Iowa.

151

For COVID-19 deaths, there are ten significant clusters for the same time period, as

152

shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Again, the top cluster is in the New York-New Jersey-

153

Connecticut area, with nearly 21 million people, and with a COVID-19 mortality that is 14 times

154

higher than the rest of the United States. In general, results are similar for diagnoses and deaths,

155

although the latter analysis has fewer clusters due to a smaller sample size.

156

Recent Situation

157

For public health action, the more recent situation is of great interest. For the 14 days period

158

April 7-20, 2020, there were 43 statistically significant clusters with a high rate of diagnosed

159

cases, as shown in Figure 3. Table 3 provides details about the top 20 statistically significant

160

clusters. The New York City metropolitan area is still the top cluster, while Marion, Ohio;

161

Chicago; and New Orleans are number 2, 3 and 4 respectively. For deaths during the same

162

period, there are nine significant clusters, as shown in Figure 4 and Table 4. The New York

163

cluster is ranked number 1, with RR=13.5.

164

Emerging Problem Areas

165

The purely spatial analysis does not provide information about temporal changes. When using

166

the prospective space-time scan statistic, while adjusting for purely geographical variation, we

167

found six statistically significant clusters of rapidly increasing rates of diagnosed COVID-19

168

cases, as shown in Figure 5 and Table 5. The top cluster is in the Upper Midwest, stretching from

169

Kansas and Missouri in the south to the Canadian border. The second cluster consists of several

170

states in the Mid-Atlantic regions. There are also four geographically smaller clusters of

171

increased COVID-19 activity in and around New York City. Figure 6 and Table 6 shows the

172

equivalent results for mortality. The top cluster with a rapid increase in mortality is in Southern

173

New England, followed by a huge cluster consisting of most of the Midwest.

174

Discussion

175

To minimize COVID-19 mortality, it is important to monitor the spread of the disease in both

176

space and time. Since older people have a much higher exposure and infection fatality ratio, it is

177

important that they are protected and isolated until herd immunity is reached. For that, it is

178

important both to know what places are closer to herd immunity and the places that currently

179

have high infection and mortality rates.

180

The diagnosis and death data have different strength and weaknesses. The diagnosis data has the

181

major weakness, in that the rates both depend on the presence of the disease as well as on the

182

amount of testing. For a cluster to be detected, both are required. Hence, the analysis may have

183

missed high incidence areas with low levels of testing. The mortality data is less dependent on

184

testing, and it is reassuring that the two data sets produce somewhat similar results. One

185

advantage of the diagnosis analyses is that it provides earlier indications about COVID-19

186

activity since the disease is typically diagnosed before death. An even earlier indication of

187

COVID-19 activity may be syndromic data on influenza like illness, and spatial scan statistics

188

have also been applied to such data. [12]

189

It is popular to compare COVID-19 mortality between countries and regions, but most such

190

comparisons do not adjust for age, which is critical since COVID-19 is highly age dependent. It

191

is also critical to note that some countries and regions are further along to reach herd immunity,

192

and it is not necessarily the areas with fewer deaths that will have the fewest deaths by the time

193

the pandemic is over.

194

This study applies modern disease surveillance methodology in addition to using choropleth

195

maps that clearly show the relative ranking of countiesâ€™ virus cases and deaths. While the

196

descriptive choropleth maps give an overall view of the contiguous US regarding the relative

197

standings of counties for the COVID-19 virus levels, SaTScanTM provides the methodology to

198

identify spatial clusters across the entire study period and also for the last 14 days, testing for

199

significance of each identified cluster. Such spatial clusters show the geographic distribution of

200

this virus when averaged across the study period. In addition to the spatial clusters, SaTScanTM

201

also identified emerging clusters by using the prospective space-time analysis. These are

202

outbreaks of COVID-19 cases and death within a window of 14 days and such information is

203

helpful in understanding where in the contiguous US the virus is spreading the most.

204

While this study looked at COVID-19 across a large country, these types of analyses are equally

205

or even more important to do for smaller regions in order to detect neighborhood clusters where

206

the elderly require extra protection. That will require data at a finer geographical resolution

207

available to many health departments but often publicly unavailable.

208

As COVID-19 is a rapid evolving pandemic, it is critical to have up to date information on its

209

spread, of the type that cannot be provided by academic journals. As a complement to this paper,

210

we will provide updated maps online. In near time, this will provide rapid up to date information

211

regarding the United States. For the longer term, it will provide a historical record for how the

212

disease spread over time and place.

213

Conclusions

214

It is possible to quickly identify significant spatial clusters of COVID-19 cases and death based

215

on county level data. However, different public health questions require different types of spatial

216

statistical analyses. With properly focused analyses, this methodology can be useful to public

217

health agencies to appropriately focus their COVID-19 counter measures.
