Abstract
The global pandemic due to the emergence of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a threat to
humanity. There remains an urgent need to understand its transmission characteristics and design
effective interventions to mitigate its spread. In this study, we define a non-linear (known in
biochemistry models as allosteric or cooperative) relationship between viral shedding, viral dose
and COVID-19 infection propagation. We develop a mathematical model of the dynamics of
COVID-19 to link quantitative features of viral shedding, human exposure and transmission in
nine countries impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and state-wide transmission in the
United States of America (USA). The model was then used to evaluate the efficacy of
interventions against virus transmission. We found that cooperativity was important to capture
country-specific transmission dynamics and leads to resistance to mitigating transmission in mild
or moderate interventions. The behaviors of the model emphasize that strict interventions greatly
limiting both virus shedding and human exposure are indispensable to achieving effective
containment of COVID-19. Finally, in the USA we find that by the summer of 2021, a difference
of about 1.5 million deaths may be observed depending on whether the interventions are to be
maintained strictly or lifted in entirety.

Introduction
A novel disease (COVID-19)1-3, which was first detected in December 2019 and then found to be
caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic, causing millions of infections, and claiming
more than 240,000 lives as of the time of this publication. In response to the outbreak of
COVID-19, some countries such as China launched extremely aggressive, unprecedented actions
including social distancing measures, school and workplace closures, travel bans, centralized
quarantine of infected individuals, and contact tracing using cell phone tracking. While new
infections and deaths have been greatly reduced in China4-6 and in some other countries, the
disease is rapidly spreading in many countries, among which the United States, with mixed
efforts to limit transmission, has suffered from the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths.
It speaks for itself the importance and urgency of understanding what interventions may best
serve public health. A knowledge about the underlying mechanisms governing virus transmission
dynamics gives insight into this question.
Mathematical models have been used to understand the transmission dynamics of epidemics7
from seasonal influenza8 to the Ebola virus9, forecast their outbreak and spread, and evaluate the
efficiency of interventions in containing these diseases10. The most widely applied mathematical
models in epidemiology are compartmental models, for instance, the
susceptible-infected-recovered-deceased (SIRD) model, in which the total population is divided
into several categories susceptible, infected, recovered, and deceased, between which exchange
occurs. These models have served a fundamental role in reaching a quantitative understanding of

transmission characteristics of COVID-19, such as estimation of basic reproduction number (R0),
incubation period, and fatality rate11-15, and evaluation of the efficacies of interventions5,6,16-19.
While these models have greatly contributed to our current understanding of the COVID-19
pandemic, they lack information on infection mechanisms by SARS-CoV-2 and overlook the
quantitative relationship between the rate of infection and viral exposure such as what would
happen during a super-spreader event. Instead, spread of the disease is taken to be directly
mediated by interactions between infected and susceptible individuals, which are assumed to
occur through linear relationships, thus creating a gap between the modeling tools currently
available and the knowledge about detailed parameters of the virus, such as rates of virus
shedding and decay20,21, source-dependent viral dose22,23, and dose dependent infectivity24, for
which experimental data have been collected but not yet used in the development of quantitative
models of the pandemic25.
Here, we develop a novel mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.
We show that the cooperativity in infection between uninfected and infected individuals is
critical in explaining the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in countries most severely
impacted by the pandemic. Cooperativity has a long history in the study of biological dynamics
that began with models of ligand binding to receptors with multiple binding sites and has
numerous applications to understand fundamental molecular processes in living cells such as
gene transcription and signal transduction26,27. Despite the complexity in the pathology of
diseases such as COVID-19, there exists a mechanistic similarity between the binding of a ligand
and activation of a receptor with multiple binding sites, and the release of virus from an infected

person and transmission to an uninfected host which can be multiplicative through many avenues.
Transmission can amplify from one person through airborne transmission and other
dissemination of infectious liquid droplets. Preliminary studies on the dose-dependent response
to virus infection have also demonstrated that the relationship between viral exposure and
infection is non-linear, suggesting that the infection kinetics is more complicated than assumed
in the original epidemic models24. Thus, consideration of such non-linearity may offer novel
insights about how the virus is transmitted, how the pandemic can be effectively controlled, and
how much the current public health interventions have contributed to its containment or lack
thereof.
Our mathematical models indicate that, the transmission of COVID-19 is intrinsically
resistant to weak-to-moderate interventions because of the cooperativity of virus infection,
thereby requiring only aggressive interventions to mitigate its spread. As an example, evaluation
of the COVID-19 transmission characteristics in the USA shows that the current schemes of
interventions, which were temporarily strong but on average weak-to-moderate, may have saved
over 500,000 lives as of July 15, 2020, and will have saved over 2.5 million lives by June 2021 if
the interventions are to be maintained at their peak strength. The early lifting of interventions is
unfortunately predicted to cost about 1.5 million lives and the COVID-19 pandemic in the
United States is unlikely to be contained by current interventions without a large loss of human
life.

A cooperative infection model correctly captures country-specific COVID-19 transmission
dynamics
To incorporate viral dose and cooperative infection into compartmental infectious disease models,
we introduced a variable V quantifying the abundance of the virus to a reduced SIRD model in
which the total number of recovered (R) and deceased (D) people are treated as a single variable,
non-susceptible (N) population (Figure 1A, Methods). The reason for using a reduced model
instead of the original SIRD model is that the rates for the transition from infected (I) to
recovered (R) and deceased (D) are both proportional to the number of infected individuals (I),
thus the sum of these two, N, also changes with a rate proportional to I. Moreover, a model with
fewer parameters has the advantage of reducing parameter uncertainty and better avoiding
overfitting. Using a standard mathematical term describing the cooperative relationship between
V and infection of susceptible individuals by viable virus particles, we derived three variations of
the original SIRD model, including the reduced SIRD model, the reduced SIRD model with virus
pool, and the reduced SIRD model with virus pool and cooperative infection (Figure 1A,
Methods). Cooperativity was modeled using a Hill function with two parameters accounting for
the levels of cooperativity and saturation in response to viral dose, respectively (Methods). These
models were then compared as to their accuracy in fitting data consisting of COVID-19 case
numbers, recovered and deceased individuals in the nine countries with the highest and still
rapidly increasing numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths, which indicate ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic as of Apr 3, 2020. These countries include USA, Turkey, UK, Spain, Italy,
Germany, France, Switzerland, and Iran. Accuracy of fit was determined by a cost function

defined as the mean squared deviation between simulated and actual daily numbers of infected
individuals and non-susceptible individuals on dates within the time window between the
confirmation of the first infection in the country and Apr 3, 2020 (Figure 1B). We found that
among the three models, the reduced SIRD model with a virus pool and cooperative infection (i.e.
the cooperative infection model) reached higher accuracy compared to the other two models in
all countries, and was able to generate satisfactory fitting (i.e. optimal cost function < 0.005,
which means that the mean error for each data point is less than 7.07% of the maximal value of
actual data over the entire time course) in 7 out of the 9 countries (Figure 1C). By contrast, the
two models without cooperative infection generated satisfactory fitting in only two countries,
and the addition of the virus pool to the reduced SIRD model did not increase the fitting
accuracy of the model despite the increased complexity of model (absolute difference in
-log10(Optimal value of cost function) smaller than 0.003 for all countries, Figure 1C),
suggesting that consideration of cooperativity in infection is critical for the model to accurately
predict the COVID-19 transmission dynamics. We also performed a sensitivity analysis
assuming that 50% or 80% of the infections were undocumented and repeated all analyses using
the adjusted data, to confirm that the model is consistent with the COVID-19 transmission
dynamics and that all conclusions are unaffected in the presence of reporting or testing biases
(Methods) . The cooperative infection model also includes parameters directly related to other
factors contributing to the viral dose dynamics, such as rate constants for virus shedding and
decay, and parameters quantifying the overall susceptibility of healthy population to the virus
and efficiency of patient clearance (Figure 1D). Inference of these parameters from COVID-19

transmission data in different countries would offer valuable insights into the intrinsic properties
of the virus and its specific transmission characteristics in each country.

The cooperative infection model predicts country-specific COVID-19 transmission
dynamics
To predict COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the seven countries where the cooperative
infection model was consistent with its previous transmission dynamics, we simulated the model
over a time window of 80 days starting from February 15, 2020 with parameter sets that
satisfactorily fit the data for each country. Parameter sets generating satisfactory fits were
obtained by sampling the parameter space (Methods). We found that, in the absence of
intervention, all seven countries were predicted to undergo significant increase in the number of
infected individuals, especially for the countries UK, USA and Turkey, for which the numbers of
infections were predicted to increase rapidly without any tendency of slowdown (Figure 2A,
Supplementary Figure 1). To understand COVID-19 transmission characteristics in different
countries, especially those predicted to face more future challenges, we examined distributions of
parameters determining the transmission dynamics in each country (Figure 2B). We found that
the two model parameters that significantly differ across countries are related to the susceptibility
of the healthy population to infection (k) and the efficiency of patient clearance (a), while
parameters quantifying viral dose dynamics (c and d) and the cooperativity in response to viral
dose (n and K) showed no difference between countries (Figure 2B). These results further
support the use of the cooperative infection model because parameters for virus shedding, decay

and dose response are directly determined by intrinsic properties of the virus20, thus we expect
values of these parameters to be indistinguishable between countries, while the susceptibility of
the healthy population and efficiency of patient clearance reflects the performance of public
health measures and the healthcare systems which are country-specific. Notably, USA, UK and
Turkey are the three countries with lowest efficiency of patient clearance among the seven
countries, while the USA population was also found to suffer from the highest susceptibility to
infection.

Extremely strict interventions are needed to control the COVID-19 pandemic
We next assessed efficiency of different intervention strategies by simulating their influences on
model-predicted disease transmission dynamics. We considered two scenarios of intervention:
the infected individual-based intervention that targets the infected population to reduce virus
shedding from the infected individuals, and the population-based intervention that limits both
virus shedding from infected individuals and exposure of susceptible individuals to the virus.
The two scenarios of intervention were modeled by introducing a coefficient

that quantifies

the strength of intervention, to the cooperative infection model (Figure 3A). We considered three
different levels of intervention strength ranging from strong to weak (Figure 3B), which are
approximately equivalent to the approximate efficiency of N95 respirators (  0.1), surgical
masks (  0.2), and homemade masks (  0.5)28-30. Assuming that the intervention starts at
48 days after the onset of the pandemic in the country (i.e. the date when the first COVID-19
case in the corresponding country was confirmed), we simulated the infection dynamics over a

time window of 100 days starting from the onset of pandemic (Figure 3C, Supplementary Figure
2) and computed the relative number of infected individuals 100 days after the onset (Figure 3D).
Notably, we found that only population-based interventions with extremely high intervention
strength (  0.1, equivalent to all people wearing N95 respirators) were sufficient to effectively
prevent the growth of infected population (number of infected individuals on day 100 < 15% of
the number in the absence of interventions for all countries except for Turkey and 39.8% for
Turkey, Figure 3D). Taken together, these results suggest that in response to the COVID-19
pandemic, extremely strict interventions that affect the entire population are indispensable to
prevent the spread of the disease.

Cooperative infection results in resistance to public health interventions
To understand how inclusion of the cooperative infection term contributes to the response of
COVID-19 transmission dynamics to interventions, we next examined how the cooperative
infection term H, which determines the rate of infection together with the susceptibility of
healthy population and number of susceptible individuals (Figure 4A), depends on the dose of
viable virus. For each country, we simulated the relationship between the viral dose and the
cooperative infection term using 5,000 parameter sets (Figure 4B). We found that, compared to a
linear relationship, the cooperative infection term H has the tendency of amplifying a relatively
small concentrations of virus, resulting in higher sensitivity to lower viral doses (i.e. small
amount of virus is able to cause a considerable number of infections) and stronger resistance to a
reduction in viral dose (i.e. moderate reduction in viral dose is insufficient to effectively prevent

the infections). We further illustrate this feature of the cooperative infection model by simulating
the influence of different levels of viral concentration reduction on the value of cooperative
infection term (Figure 4C). We found that, under a moderate-to-strong intervention that reduces
the viral concentration by 90% (the left panel), the value of the cooperative infection term was
only reduced by around 40% to 70% (values ranging from 44.9% for Germany to 68.6% for UK
based on parameters with optimal fitting, left panel of Figure 4C, yellow stars). This finding
indicates that the majority of infections cannot be prevented by these interventions. On the other
hand, under an extremely strong intervention that removes 99% of the virus (the right panel), the
value of cooperative infection term was effectively reduced by the extent of more than 90%
(values ranging from 93.0% for Italy and 97.3% for France, right panel of Figure 4C, yellow
stars). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the cooperativity in infection, which has
been found to be indispensable for the model to accurately reproduce country-specific
COVID-19 transmission dynamics in our previous analysis, dampens the effects of interventions,
thus requiring extremely strong interventions to effectively mitigate the pandemic.

Transmission characteristics of COVID-19 in the United States of America
The USA has suffered from the highest numbers of infections and deaths among all countries,
and the numbers of infections and deaths caused by COVID-19 are increasing, especially after
most states have entered the initial phases of reopening in June and July of 2020. It is therefore
important to understand whether the temporally varying public health responses and
interventions, such as lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions and recommendations

of wearing masks in public space, have effectively prevented the spread of COVID-19 and
protected the health of the U.S. population, which reside in all sorts of neighborhoods that
greatly differ with each other in cultural, social and economic factors.
To understand the state by state temporal heterogeneity in how public health interventions
have shaped the COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the USA, we built state-by-state
COVID-19 transmission models with the consideration that the strength of public health
intervention may change with time (Figure 5A, Methods). Four different phases were modeled:
an initial phase when there is no intervention; a ‘start of intervention’ phase in which the
intervention strength begins to rise (i.e. the intervention coefficient

decreases) and finally

reaches its peak value; a ‘maintenance of intervention’ phase during with the peak value of
intervention strength is maintained; and, finally, a ‘lifting of intervention’ phase in which the
intervention strength decreases with time. Parameters determining lengths of each phase and the
rates of intervention strength changes were then estimated by fitting actual state-wide COVID-19
transmission data.
We fit the model to data of COVID-19 infections, deaths and recoveries during the timespan
from Jan 22, 2020 to July 15, 2020 in all 51 territories of the USA, including all 50 states and the
District of Columbia (Figure 5B, S3). We found that the model satisfactorily fit the data in most
of the territories (optimal cost function value < 0.005 in 40 out of 51 territories, Figure S3),
confirming that the model correctly captures the spatially heterogenous COVID-19 transmission
dynamics in the USA. Next, to evaluate the efficiency of public health responses in containing
COVID-19 spread in each state and territory, we predicted the daily numbers of infections and

deaths in the timespan from July 16, 2020 to June 5, 2021 in each state and territory, and
computed the nationwide numbers of infections and deaths, assuming that the current scenarios
of interventions were left unchanged (Figure 5C, ‘current intervention’), interventions were
completely absent (‘no intervention’), or interventions were never lifted once the peak strengths
were reached (‘no lifting of intervention’). We found that, the current interventions have saved
over 500,000 lives as of July 15, 2020, and will have saved around 1 million lives at the
beginning of June 2021 (5.22×105 as of July 15, 2020 and 1.01×106 as of June 1, 2021, Figure 5C).
Notably, if in any state the interventions were never lifted, the number of lives saved by the summer
of 2021 will rise to over 2.5 million (2.54×106 lives saved as of June 1, 2021). In other words, the
number of lives cost by lifting the interventions early can exceed the number of lives saved by
imposing the interventions in the first place. This may bring into question the decision to reopen
states before the pandemic is completely under control. Model-computed numbers of lives saved by
intervention and cost by lifting interventions were also comparable to each other in most of the states
(Figure 5D). Finally, the peak values of intervention strength coefficient

distributed around 0.2 (median value = 0.202, Figure 5E, S4), while the average values of

 over

the timespan of Jan 22, 2020 to July 15, 2020 were higher than 0.5 in almost all states (44 out of 51,
Figure 5E, S4). Recalling our finding that only extremely strong interventions (i.e.

 0.1) are

sufficient to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, these results reveal that in almost all states, the
public health interventions are not strong enough to fully mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, although
they have mitigated its transmission and saved lives to some extent.

Discussion
In this study, we have developed a mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of COVID
19 based on the concept of cooperativity in biology. The model was found to accurately
reproduce the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in seven countries that are most severely
impacted by the pandemic while models without the cooperative infection were inconsistent with
available data. These findings highlight the importance of cooperativity in shaping population
level responses to an infectious virus and offer new insights into the transmission dynamics of
infectious diseases. Notably, the cooperativity in infection leads to the resistance of virus
transmission to intervention strategies that are not strong enough, resulting in increased difficulty
in designing effective interventions to control the pandemic. Aggressive interventions with the
strength approximately equivalent to at least requiring all individuals, no matter infected or not,
to wear N95 respirators all time while in public space, are predicted to be necessary by the model.
Furthermore, with the consideration of temporally varying intervention strength, we were able to
extend the model to capture the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission in
the United States of America. Projection of future COVID-19 transmission dynamics and
inference of intervention strengths in these states based on the models together show that the
current public health interventions in the United States are not sufficient to completely mitigate
the pandemic, despite being able to reduce infections and deaths caused by COVID-19 to some
extent. These findings together stress the necessity of strong interventions in effectively
controlling the transmission of COVID-19.
We also note that, as with any mathematical model for a complicated process, this model is

not without limitations. Like all models in computational epidemiology, this model does not
account for many factors that contributes to the transmission of COVID-19. First, this model
assumes that there is no regional heterogeneity in the country or state of interest, and that the
population is homogenously mixed, while it has been demonstrated that the susceptibility to and
fatality of COVID-19 depends on many demographic factors, such as gender and age11,31, and
life style related variables, such as smoking history32. Countries and state are assumed to be
isolated from each other, which means no international and interstate travels occur during the
time period, while imported cases likely contribute to many COVID-19 outbreaks around the
world. Moreover, since a data-driven approach was used to parameterize the models, it might
underestimate the severity of the pandemic because of the existence of undocumented infections
due to the limitation of diagnostic capacity33. Other factors not included in the model, such as
seasonality in transmission of coronaviruses14, existence of asymptotic infections34, and change
of case definition35 may also affect the epidemic curve of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the model,
while possibly underestimating the severity of COVID-19 due to simplification, still forecasts
the rapid escalation in COVID-19 spread, and highlights the extreme urgency of stronger
interventions such as contact tracing, rigorous social distancing, or the application of N95
respirators for public use by showing that moderate interventions are not likely to effectively
reduce transmission due to the cooperative infection term. Modest measures such as those
adopted so far in the USA unfortunately nevertheless disrupt the normal function of society and
creates substantial economic and societal costs and may not be effective as planned.
In summary, this study develops a cooperative infection model that connects viral dynamics

to the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 at the population level, captures the nonlinearity in
the dose-response relationship in viral infection, correctly reproduces COVID-19 transmission
characteristics in different countries, and, forecasts the rapid spread of COVID-19 in the absence
of extremely strong interventions due to the cooperativity in SARS-CoV-2 infection. While
further research and analysis are needed to improve the model and better understand the
molecular mechanisms behind the cooperativity in viral infection, the predictions of this model
demonstrate the indispensability of stronger interventions14,36 that should encourage policy
makers with interests in public good.

Methods

infected individuals (i.e. total cases, including both infected individuals and recovered or
deceased individuals) in the nine countries, which were used in fitting the models, were retrieved
from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/. Data for total population estimates in the nine
countries, which were used in estimation of the initial number of susceptible people at the onset
of pandemic in each country, were obtained from the 2019 Revision of World Population
Prospects (https://population.un.org/wpp/). COVID-19 transmission data in 51 territories of the
USA, including daily numbers of total infected individuals, which include both currently infected
individuals and recovered or deceased cases, and daily numbers of recoveries and deaths were
retrieved from The COVID Tracking Project (https://covidtracking.com). Data of population in

Sensitivity analysis
Actual numbers of infections, deaths and recoveries were assumed to be two- or five-folds of the

Simulation of interventions
Simulation of interventions was performed over a time window of 100 days starting from the
onset of the first infection in each country. For each country, simulation was done with 5,000
parameter sets randomly selected from all sampled parameter sets with satisfactory fitting to the
country-specific COVID-19 transmission data. An intervention was assumed to start on day 48.
We first simulated the model without intervention in the time window of day 0 to day 48, and
then simulated the model under the intervention from day 48 to day 100. For a parameter set #,
the relative number of infected individuals on day 100 under an intervention I was calculated as

and ∆ describes the lengths of the ‘no intervention’, ‘start of

by fitting daily numbers of COVID-19 infections, deaths and recoveries in the timespan from Jan
22, 2020 to July 15, 2020 in 51 states and DC using the same fitting and sampling methods
described in “Simulation and parameter space sampling of the models”.
Simulation of different intervention scenarios in the USA
ODEs were solved over the time window from Jan 22, 2020 to June 5, 2021 using the function
ode23s() in MATLAB R2019a. To simulate the case of no intervention, the parameter 5 (i.e.
length of the ‘no intervention’ phase) was set to 10,000 days, while all other parameters were left
unchanged. For the case of no lifting of intervention, the parameter ∆ was set to 10,000 days,
while all other parameters were unchanged. Confidence regions of the simulated curves were
determined based on 500 randomly sampled parameter sets that satisfactorily fit the actual data.
