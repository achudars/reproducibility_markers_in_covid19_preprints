Abstract
Objectives: To identify putative COVID-19 treatments and identify the roles of immunomodulators and
antivirals in disease management.
Design: Systematic review.
Data sources: PubMed, bioRxiv.org and medRxiv.org were searched for studies suggestive of effective
treatments for COVID-19. Additional studies were identified via a snowballing method applied to the
references of retrieved papers as well as a subsequent targeted search for drug names.
Review methods: Inclusion criteria included any case series or randomised control trials in any
language that were published from 18th December 2019 to 18th April 2020 and described COVID-19
treatment. Of an initial 2140 studies identified from the initial search, 29 studies were found to meet the
inclusion criteria and included in this comprehensive systematic review.
Results: 19 studies of antiviral treatments for COVID-19 have been reported and seven studies for
immunomodulatory treatments. Six randomised controlled trials have been published with one positive
trial for Hydroxychloroquine. This small study consisted of 31 patients though subsequent studies
showed contradictory findings. All the remaining studies were observational studies, retrospective case
reviews or non-randomised trials and these results are difficult to interpret due to methodological issues.
Conclusions: To date, an impressive number of studies have been performed in a short space of time,
indicative of a resilient clinical trials infrastructure. However, there is a lack of high quality evidence to
support any novel treatments for COVID-19 to be incorporated into the current standard of care. The
majority of the studies of treatments for COVID-19 could only be found in pre-print servers. Future
clinical reviews should therefore be Comprehensive Systematic Reviews involving pre-print studies to
prevent potential unnecessary replications of clinical studies.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family; a group of enveloped positive single
strand RNA viruses. The virus causes acute respiratory syndrome and was first identified in Hubei
province, China in December 2019. Clinically, the presentation of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 varies from
none or minor ‘common cold’ symptoms, to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), resulting in
severely impaired respiratory function. The highly infectious nature and potential severity of the
pathogenicity of COVID-19 has put significant burden on healthcare, social and economic resources.
Mortality increases with age, with the highest mortality among people over 80 years of age with a case
fatality rate of 21.9% (1). The standard of care treatment of COVID-19 is largely supportive, consisting
of maintaining adequate oxygenation, cardiovascular perfusion and treatment of concurrent infection.
The exact mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes morbidity and mortality are poorly described.
Autopsy studies have identified diffuse alveolar damage. On one hand, this might suggest a direct viral
cytopathic effect on alveolar cells (2). Conversely, pneumocyte damage may also arise from ARDS, a
form of rapid widespread inflammation in the lung, which arises as a consequence of activation of tissue
resident macrophages, resulting in chemokine secretion leading to tissue ingress of peripheral immune
cells including neutrophils and lymphocytes and further organ damage (2). There may also be a
temporal dimension to the disease course of COVID-19, which may progress through different phases.
It is hypothesised the initial phases and symptoms are predominantly driven by viral replication (early
infection viral phase), with a late phase, and morbidity/mortality, driven by the host immune response.
The global pharmaceutical COVID-19 drug development pipeline has been developed de novo since
December 2019. Broadly, two forms of treatments are under investigation. Firstly, antiviral therapy
where the intention is to limit and contain viral replication, and secondly, immunomodulatory therapy
with the aim to control the hyperinflammatory immune response.
In this review, we have performed a systematic review of all treatments for COVID-19 up to April 18th
2020 and described the potential utility of antiviral and immunomodulatory strategies. This
comprehensive systematic review includes all published trials, but also includes pre-print studies which
are significantly more numerous and not reviewed in any previous systematic review.

Methods
Search Strategy
A systematic review of PubMed, bioRxiv.org and medRxiv.org was performed to find original research
articles providing information of interventional treatments against COVID-19. The search strategy was
based on the following keywords, “COVID-19”, “coronavirus”, “SARS-CoV-2” and “treatment” (MeSH
search terms of (((‘COVID-19’) OR ‘Coronavirus’) OR ‘SARS-CoV-2’) AND ‘Treatment’). To expand the
search, a snowballing method was applied to the references of retrieved papers with a subsequent
targeted search for drug names. Research abstracts were independently reviewed by two authors to
select studies that met our inclusion criteria before the full-text review of selected studies. Discrepancies
and doubts of the relevance of the sources were solved by consensus with two or more authors. This
systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines (3).
Study Selection
th
Clinical studies were included in this study if they were, i) case series or RCTs, ii) from 18 of December
2019 to 18th of April 2020, iii) in any language and iv) describing COVID-19 treatment. Studies were
excluded if, i) they reported on dietary modification including traditional herbal medications, ii)
retrospective review of existing anti-hypertensives, iii) systematic reviews, iv) reporting on different
forms of oxygen/ventilation, v) case reports, or vi) any commentaries or reviews.
The data and clinical findings were identified and entered into a pre-defined data extraction form, which
was filled in by two reviewers. Differences were resolved by consensus. The following data were
extracted; title, first author name, date of publication, publication journal, country, treatment, treatment
dosage, trial design, number of patients, participant demographics, setting of treatment, outcome data,
adverse events and control group.

Results
Search Results
A search of PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv and a targeted search initially yielded a total of 2147 articles
related to the treatment of COVID-19 (Figure 1). In total 204 articles were reviewed in detail and 29
articles were found to be relevant to this comprehensive systematic review.
In total, 13 of these reviews were published in journals, but a significant number were from a pre-print
journal (n= 16, 55.2%). In total, there were six RCTs, two non-randomised controlled trials, 10
observational studies, and 11 retrospective case reviews. The total number of patients exposed to these
experimental drugs was 2,304, with 56.16% being male (one study did not report gender). The majority
of studies were from China (n=21, 72.4%) and Europe (n=5, 17.2%). Overall, a positive trial outcome
was reported in 18 studies (62.0%).
The clinical settings for these studies were not well defined. The majority of studies (93.1%, n=27)
investigated patients in a hospital setting. Although nine studies were conducted on patients described
as severely or critically ill, only one study explicitly stated that it occurred in an intensive therapy unit
(ITU) setting. There were no studies performed in an outpatient setting.
The efficacy/outcome measures were extremely heterogeneous and many studies lacked statistical
analysis or significance. In terms of reported endpoints of the study, the majority were based on clinical
assessment (n=12, 41.4%), some used viral markers (n=7, 24.1%) and a minority used clinical
management decisions, such as decision for ITU admission or change in ventilation (n=5, 17.2%). Only
two trials used survival as their end point. A significant proportion of studies did not report on adverse
events (n=8, 27.5%).
There were 19 studies reporting on antiviral treatment for patients with COVID-19, seven studies
investigated immunomodulatory treatment, and three studies looked at Dipyridamole, plasminogen, and
low molecular weight heparin. There were six RCTs for antiviral treatments, but no RCTs for an
immunomodulatory COVID-19 strategy.

Antiviral Treatment
Several different types of antiviral treatments for COVID-19 have been analysed to date, three targeting
viral entry (Arbidol, Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine), two targeting viral polymerases (Favipiravir,
Remdesivir) and three protease inhibitors (Lopinavir, Danoprevir, Ritonavir) and one of convalescent
plasma.
The largest study of antiviral treatment for COVID-19 to date was for Favipiravir versus a proposed
standard of care, Arbidol (4). This was a prospective randomized trial in 236 patients. This study of
Favipiravir did not show any evidence of improvement of clinical recovery at day seven compared to
Arbidol. It is also notable that there was also no evidence that would suggest Arbidol could be used as
an antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The anti-malarials, Chloroquine and its less toxic derivative Hydroxychloroquine are believed to have
antiviral properties. This is mediated through an inhibition of terminal glycosylation of Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the
lungs (5). However, it is Iikely that anti-inflammatory properties of these drugs also exist (6). The
evidence for Chloroquine was from a 2b safety study, however, this was halted early due to significant
toxicities. There were two RCTs for the use of Hydroxychloroquine. The first study was performed in a
total of 62 patients and found that an unusual outcome measure, ‘time to clinical recovery’ (TTCR),
which consists of reduction of body temperature and cough, was significantly improved (7).
Unfortunately, the second RCT of Hydroxychloroquine in 150 patients showed no improvement in its
primary outcome - 28-day negative conversion rate (8).
Two RCTs have been performed for Lopinavir/Ritonavir; the first involved a total of 86 patients and the
second 199 patients. Both studies showed no improvement in any primary or secondary outcome
measures with significant toxicities (9) (10).
Finally, there is a retrospective cohort study suggestive that Remdesivir might have efficacy. Remdesivir
is a nucleotide analogue prodrug which inserts into viral RNA chains, causing their premature
termination (11). A retrospective case review was performed for 53 patients who were treated with
Remdesivir. The majority of these patients were receiving invasive ventilation. In this cohort, 47% of
patients were discharged and 13% died. However, 60% of patients had an adverse event (12).

Immunomodulatory Treatment
Two broad immunomodulatory treatment strategies for COVID-19 have been reported.
Immunomodulatory treatments were either broad in nature (corticosteroids and intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIG)) or targeted through the use of Siltuximab and Tocilizumab against IL-6 and
Meplazumab against CD-147.
The largest study of immunomodulatory treatment for COVID-19 to date is for IVIG versus the standard
of care (13). This was a multicentre retrospective cohort study of 325 adults with COVID-19. The study
reported that its primary outcome, 28 day and 60 day mortality was not improved with IVIG treatment.
However, in subgroup analysis of critical patients, IVIG seemed to reduce the 28 day mortality, reduce
patient inflammatory responses and also improved some organ function.
Corticosteroids have well described systemic anti-inflammatory effects, through the up-regulation of
anti-inflammatory proteins and down-regulation of pro-inflammatory proteins (14). Two studies report on
the role of corticosteroids in COIVD-19 patients; both of which demonstrate corticosteroid therapy have
no benefit in viral clearance, symptom resolution or mortality. The larger of the two studies, a
retrospective case review of 244 patients suggested that not only did corticosteroids not improve
patient’s clinical outcomes, but that a higher steroid dose was significantly associated with elevated
mortality risk (15). This study reported that every 10mg increase in Hydrocortisone equivalent dose was
associated with an additional 4% mortality risk.
Finally, there were two key studies looking at the impact of targeted immunomodulatory treatment on
COVID-19. Siltuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and prevents the action of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 (16). In 21 hospitalised COVID-19 patients treated on Siltuximab, clinical
improvement was observed in 33% of study participants (17). Toculizumab is a monoclonal antibody
that binds to IL-6 (18). In an observational study of 30 COVID-19 patients in an intensive care setting,
treatment with Toculizumab was found to reduce patient’s mechanical ventilation requirements and
need for ITU admission, of which 20% were discharged (19).

Discussions
The rapid global transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has caused significant strain to healthcare systems
around the world and is now associated with major morbidity and mortality. The global medical research
community has launched a relatively large number of clinical studies in the course of just a few months.
The ability to launch these analyses in the middle of a global pandemic, for an essentially unknown
disease, is a testament of the robustness of healthcare systems, excellence of individual
hospitals/clinicians and is something never seen before in the history of modern medicine.
Unfortunately, this systematic review of clinical trials to date has discovered no high-quality trials
identifying drug efficacy against COVID-19. One small RCT of Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin was
positive but this has not yet been validated and had methodological flaws. However, there are many
promising retrospective case studies for antivirals and immunomodulatory treatments, but these remain
challenging to interpret due to self-fulfilment bias or trial design. It is also particularly surprising that
there are a number of interventions which have negative/no evidence for, which are being tested in very
large UK studies. This might be an artefact of a lack of recent clinical reviews or potential oversight of
the evidence to date.
Nevertheless, there are a number of valuable insights which may be observed from the studies to date.
Firstly, it would appear that pre-print servers are an extremely good mechanism for disseminating
literature/data. With a rapidly ensuing pandemic, the weeks/months required for publication of
manuscripts in a peer-reviewed journal may mean that some studies could be needlessly replicated with
potential adverse human impact. Whilst not part of the formal process for systematic reviews, the use of
pre-print servers would ensure a contemporary review and facilitate a Comprehensive Systematic
Review.
Secondly, most of the reported studies investigated hospitalised patients. There is only one study that
has emerged out of an intensive care setting. Potentially, this may reflect the relative difficulties of
performing studies or case series in ITU. Conversely. More concerningly, it is possible that drug
interventions against COVID-19 in an ITU setting may have minimal effect. It might be an
unsurmountable challenge for a pharmaceutical intervention to reverse respiratory and multi-organ
failure, once a patient enters the hyperimmune phase with an ensuing severe cytokine release
syndrome.
Finally, looking to the future, this comprehensive systematic review has identified a number of trial
design strategies which would improve future clinical trials. Most of the trials treat a heterogenous
patient cohort. As clinical outcomes of patients from COVID-19 vary depending on age, sex and comorbidities, a poorly defined or heterogenous trial inclusion criteria is unlikely to be compatible with
efficient trial design. Furthermore, there appear to be a multitude of unvalidated surrogate study
endpoints utilised for COVID-19 trials, such as ITU admissions, changes in viral load, seronegativity and
cytokine panels. Survival of patients is the definitive end point and one which is rarely utilised but is of
great importance. It is therefore of great regret that these trial methodological flaws continue to be
repeated in newly launched nationally prioritised studies.
In summary, we have performed a Comprehensive Systematic Review of all pre-print and published
articles to date to identify treatments against COVID-19. Unfortunately, there is no high-quality evidence
to back any particular intervention, either antiviral or immunomodulatory to form a COVID-19 standard of
care. We hope that this work will help ensure the next generation of COVID-19 clinical trials in the UK
might have more efficient trial design using better targets and potentially expose less patients to risks
beyond COVID-19.
