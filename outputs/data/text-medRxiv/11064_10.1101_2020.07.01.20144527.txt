Abstract:

25

As the prevalence of COVID-19 in all the area of China and continuous spread to

26

many other countries, it is in urgent need of medical mask for community people. We

27

have reported a simple method to inactivate artificially influenza virus-contaminated

28

medical mask without affecting the filterability of mask by heating with hair dryer for

29

30min. In this study, we extended our studies to optimize our protocols and evaluate

30

the filterability of mask after several-rounds of heat treatment. We found that baking

31

at 70℃ for 30min almost completely inactivated virus as hair dryer treatment for

32

30min described before. One-round of heat treatment with hair dryer for 30min or

33

baking at 70℃ for 30min did not affect filterability of mask whilst two-rounds of

34

treatment slightly but significantly reduced filterability of mask. Thus, heating with

35

hair dryer for 30min or baking at 70℃ for 30min can inactive contaminated medical

36

mask and the treated mask can be reused at least once.

Introduction:

40

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan China, it was endemic to all over the

41

China within less than one month, causing over 80000 cases and over 3000 mortalities

42

in China. It is considered to have pandemic potential, as it has been spread to almost

43

all the continents and has caused over 20000 cases outside China. COVID-19 is

44

caused

45

human-to-human transmission occurs mainly through close contacts4. Personal

46

protective equipment (PPE) like medical mask is critical for public to prevent the

47

infection of COVID-19. Thus it is in urgent need of medical mask all over the world.

48

However, there is global shortage of medical mask. Medical mask acts similarly as

49

N95 respirators for preventing Influenza virus infection 5. Re-use of disposable

50

medical mask would alleviate the panic of shortage of mask. Prior to re-use of mask,

51

we should inactivate potential contaminated virus on the mask. Heat inaction of virus

52

such as incubating at 56℃ for 30min is widely accepted to be able to inactivate

53

enveloped virus like influenza virus and coronavirus. And importantly, heating at

54

70 ℃ for 24 hour does not significantly change the filtration efficiency of

55

polypropylene (PP)6, a core matrix for medical mask, whereas conventional

56

disinfectant like ethanol dramatically destroys filter performance of polypropylene

57

electret filters 7. We have developed a simple method to inactivate medical mask that

58

is artificially contaminated by influenza virus via heating with hair dryer for 30min

59

without affecting its filterability 8, which can be easily adapted by public. In this study,

60

we extended our studies to optimize our protocols by shortening treatment intervals

61

with hair dryer and baking mask at different temperatures. We demonstrated that hair

62

dryer treatment for 15 min did not effectively inactivate influenza virus (IVA) on

63

medical mask compared with 30 min as described before. And that baking at 70℃ for

64

30 min effectively inactivated IVA on mask whereas baking at 65℃ for 30 min did

65

not. We also evaluated the filterability of mask after several-rounds of heat treatment.

66

Our results reveal that two-rounds of treatment with hair dryer for 30min or baking at

67

70℃ for 30min significantly reduced filterability of mask but one-round of treatment

68

did not affect filterability of mask. Thus, we provided a simple method for reuse of

69

disposable medical mask, which may help tackle the urgent need of medical mask

70

during COVID-19 prevalence.

Materials and Methods

73

Cell and virus

74

Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were purchased from Cell Bank of

75

the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China (www.cellbank.org.cn) and

76

maintained in Dulbecco's modified medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and

77

25mM HEPES (Gibco) with non-essential amino acids (Gibco). Influenza A(H1N1)

78

A/PR8 were purchase from ATCC and propagated in MDCK cells.

79

Heat treatment of medical mask

80

Medical mask was mock-contaminated by dropping a 10μl of IVA solution

81

containing 3.6×105 pfu of IVA in 3 different sites on medical mask where each site

82

was marked with a square. Due to the hydrophobic property of mask, liquid drop is

83

difficult be absorbed onto the surface of the mask. The virus drop was doted on

84

between the kink marks of the mask. Then the mask was wrapped with a food storage

85

bag and then heat treated with hair dryer (1400w, 50Hz) by moving around over the

86

surface of the wrapped mask vertically at a distance of about 10〜20cm. Alternatively,

87

the wrapped mask was moved into baking oven and treated at indicated temperatures

88

with various intervals.

89

Rescue of the virus from mask

90

After heat treatment, the traces of IVA drop were visible within the marked

91

squares. Due to the hydrophobic property of mask, the virus within the marked

92

squares could be easily rescued by pipetting 250µl of Viral Transport Media (Hank’s

93

Balanced Salt Solution (1X HBSS) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin

94

(BSA), 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 units/ml streptomycin)9 onto the traces until

the traces disappear, then 125µl of the rescued virus was used for infecting naïve

96

MDCK cells in the presence of 5µg/ml TPCK-trypsin (sigma) for 1 hour at 37℃ in a

97

cell culture incubator. After wash with DMEM media for 4 times, fresh DMEM media

98

with 1µg/ml TPCK-trypsin was added. At indicated time points post infection, the

supernatants were collected.

and repeated for 3 times at each time point.

Results

129

Heat inactivation of IVA on mock-contaminated medical mask

130

In our previous study, baking at 56℃ for 30 min only partially inactivated IVA

131

on medical mask, with a 1〜3 log reduction of viral RNA level, comparing to 6 log

132

reduction of viral RNA level after hair dryer treatment for 30 min 8. In the present

133

study, we first increased baking temperature and treated IVA mock-contaminated

134

medical mask at 65℃ for 30 min. After treatment, the virus on the mask was rescued

135

and used to re-infect MDCK cells. Then we collected the supernatants of the infected

136

cells at 0 and 48 hours post infection and quantified the viral RNA levels by real-time

137

PCR. The inactivation efficiency was assessed by reduction of the viral RNA level

138

comparing to the un-treated group. Baking at 65℃ for 30 min resulted in 2〜5 log

139

reduction of viral RNA level but did not reduce viral RNA level to basal level (level

140

at 0 hour post infection) (Fig 1A). Hair dryer treatment for 30 min nearly completely

141

inactive IVA on medical mask 8, while for convenience, we sought to shorten the

142

treatment intervals. We assessed the inactivation efficiency of hair dryer treatment for

143

5, 10 and 15 min as described above. As shown in Figure 1A, hair dryer treatment for

144

5, 10 and 15 min did not effectively inactive IVA.

145

Then we continued to optimize baking conditions and increase temperature to

146

70℃.We treated IVA-contaminated medical mask at 70℃ for 15 min and 30 min and

147

assessed the viral replication level of the rescued virus. As shown in Figure 1B,

148

baking at 70℃ for 15 min and 30 min both effectively reduced viral RNA levels to

149

nearly basal levels and treatment for 30 min was more effective than treatment for

150

15min. Thus heat treatment with hair dryer for 30min 8 and baking at 70℃ for 30 min

151

both effectively inactive IVA-contaminated medical mask.

PM2.5 filterability of medical masks after heat treatment

153

We assessed protective function of medical mask by measuring the filterability

154

of medical masks to ambient PM2.5 after similar heat treatment as described before 8 .

155

To evaluate the recycle times of the medical mask, masks were subjected to

156

rounds of wear (use) and heat treatment. Masks were used under normal condition for

157

4 hours followed by treatment with hair dryer for 30min or baking at 70℃ for 30 min,

158

and then subjected to a 4-hour suction process mimicking the usage scenario by an

159

adult under normal condition. As demonstrated in Figure 2A, PM2.5 filtration rate of

160

all the tested disposable medical masks was slightly changed during the 4-hour

161

suction process. In general, the filterability remained stable with PM2.5 filtration rate

162

above 85% at all the tested time points. Among all the experimental groups, masks

163

that have been used and heat treated once (by baking or hair dryer) have similar

164

4-hour average PM2.5 filtration rate compared to the untreated ones (Figure 2B).

165

However, after being used and heat-treated twice (by baking or hair dryer), their

166

filtration efficiency was significantly reduced as shown in Figure 2B. Our results

167

indicate that heat inactivation by baking or hair dryer for 30 min may serve as an

168

effective way for reuse of disposable medical masks, but this method is not

169

encouraged to be used for more than once.

Discussion

172

It is not suggested to reuse disposable medical mask, especially for people who

173

are in close contact with patients, medical staffs and laboratory technicians. But for

174

community people who are at relative low risk of contacting high dosage of

175

SARS-CoV-2, it is plausible to reuse medical mask after reliable inactivating

176

treatment during the COVID-19 prevalence, which may alleviate the heavily global

177

shortage of medical mask. We used IVA to mimic SARS-CoV-2 as they transmit

178

similarly and both have envelopes and mock contaminated medical mask by dotting

179

IVA drops onto the mask, then inactivated the IVA on medical mask by convenient

180

heat treatment with hair dryer and baking that are easily to be adapted by community

181

people. We found that baking at 70℃ for 30min almost completely inactivated virus

182

as hair dryer treatment for 30min described before 8. But baking at 56℃ and 65℃

183

for 30min could not effectively activate virus 8(Fig. 1A). Incubating at 56℃ for

184

30min is a widely used protocol to inactivate influenza virus or coronavirus in

185

solution. The incomplete inactivation by baking at this temperature and at 65℃

186

indicates that baking a surface has less efficiency than incubating in solution.

187

Maintaining the filter function of medical mask during usage is critical for preventing

188

virus infection. We demonstrated that one-round of heat treatment did not affect

189

filterability of mask whilst two-rounds of treatment slightly but significantly reduced

190

filterability of mask. Thus, we provided a simple method for reuse of medical mask

191

by heating with hair dryer for 30min or baking at 70℃ for 30min and the treated

192

mask can be reused at least once.
