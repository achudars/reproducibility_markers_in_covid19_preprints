Abstract
Background: Since late December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has emerged in Wuhan and
rapidly spread throughout China. Fears were raised higher, effective policies for prevention and control
were concerned.
Methods: Till March 3, 91273 confirmed COVID-19 cases were included in. Using Mann-Whitney U
test, the provinces that reported the life tracks of confirmed cases to public had lower increased in daily
new confirmed cases.
Results: Compared with the paired province, Tianjin, Jilin, Gansu, Shanxi, Hainan and Guizhou had
significant differences in the number of new confirmed cases and have lower mean rank (P<0.05).
Shanghai had a lower mean rank (P=0.175) but no significant difference. Besides, the successful
prevention and control work need other effective strategies, such as real time media coverage, isolating
the suspected cases or close contacts, delaying the return of work, closing schools, wearing facial
masks, and disinfecting the communities, et.al.
Conclusions: Strategies must be adjusted in real time according to the epidemic. Reporting the life
tracks of confirmed cases was an effective way to control the epidemic. They may be suggestions to
other counties with an outbreak of COVID-19.

Introduction
The current outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was originated from Wuhan/Hubei
province in central China. Just in merely a month, it fast spread across other provinces or cities(1,
2). After two months, other countries, such as Korean, Japan, Iran and Italy had severe situations.
It has become a global health concern(3).
Evidence pointed out there was a strong person-to-person transmission in hospital and family
settings(4-8). Despite of lockdown of the Wuhan city since 23 January 2020, the massive human
movement during the period of Chinese traditional new year may have fueled the spread of the
disease. As we know, general rules for the prevention and control of infectious diseases are to cut
off the routes of transmission, to control the source of infection, and to protect vulnerable
populations. To date, there is no effective antiviral treatment or vaccine specifically designed for
this virus, which is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus(2). In this situation, some
non-pharmaceutical interventions, closing the public gathering places, waring facial masks and
social distancing could slow the spread of the disease. However, just one intervention, may be
ineffective for this disease. So, effective public health policies, issued or executed by government,
are needed for the disease preventive and control. Based on the experience of SARS (Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome) prevention and control in 2003(9-12), the Chinese government has carried
out a rapid and effective prevention and control(13).
In this study, by collecting the published data from the Health Commission of 23 provinces, 5
autonomous regions, 4 municipalities directly under the Central Government and 2 special
administrative regions, we compared the effect of epidemic prevent and control for each paired
provinces or cities which were based on the population density of the administrative population
and the administrative area.

Materials and Methods
Data collection
Public data on official websites of Health Commission of 23 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, 4
municipalities directly under the Central Government and 2 special administrative regions were
retrieved manually. The published date, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the
detailed level of data description including symptoms, transmission routes, etc. were recorded.
From January 21st to March 3rd, 80303 cases of China were included in. All information above was
collected by two persons independently.
Population density
We calculated the population density of the administrative population and the administrative area.
The population of administrative regions in various provinces and cities were based on the China
Statistical Yearbook 2019 (http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2019/indexch.htm), and the area of
administrative regions in various provinces and cities were based on the China’s second national
land survey(14).
Statistical analysis
Time distribution of confirmed cases with the public health policies were compared between
different areas in China by line charts. For testing hypothesis that whether the report on life tracks
of confirmed cases to public is useful for the epidemic, the number of confirmed cases were
compared by Mann-Whitney U test. A pair of provinces or cities were matched if they had similar
population densities. A two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. ALL
statistical analyses were done using the SPSS software, version 20.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk,

Results
Situation reports of COVID-19 in various provinces of China
Till March 3rd, there were 80303 confirmed cases, 2947 deaths and 47281 recurred cases in
domestic (Table 1). The top five provinces had more than 1000 cases. Hubei province had 67214
confirmed cases. Guangdong, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Anhui had 1350, 1272, 1213 and 1018
confirmed cases respectively. The existing confirmed cases in Hubei, Guangdong, Shandong,
Sichuan and Zhejiang were 28216, 259, 250, 146 and 130 respectively. Xizang and Qinghai had
no existing confirmed cases.
Comparison of COVID-19 in Wuhan city, other cities in Hubei province and other provinces
Figure 1 described the trend of COVID-19 in Wuhan city, other cities in Hubei province and other
provinces, and the main strategies in China. On December 1, first case was confirmed in Wuhan
city. Since Jan 25th, the confirmed cases were increased in Wuhan city, other cities in Hubei
province and other provinces, municipalities and special administrative regions. Wuhan city had
the largest confirmed cases every day, then other cities in Hubei province and then other provinces
and cities. On Feb. 12th, 15162 cases were confirmed nationwide. 15152 cases were diagnosed by
clinical diagnosis criteria, including 1332 cases in Wuhan city. After Feb.20th, there were almost
400 confirmed cases in Wuhan city, no more than 100 cases in Hubei province (except Wuhan
city), no more than 10 cases in other provinces.
Impacts of whether reporting the life tracks of confirmed cases in different provinces
There were different levels of situation reports in various provinces in domestic. In 34 units, seven
provinces or municipalities directly under the central government had published the life tracks of
confirmed cases on their official websites. Tianjin, Jilin, Gansu, Shanxi and Hainan reported the
detail life tracks of confirmed since Jan.25th, Jan.22nd, Jan.23rd, Jan.22 nd, and Jan 22nd, respectively.
These five units had a milder outbreak, and up to March 3rd, the existing cases in the five units
were no more than 15. Table 1 showed they ranked behind other provinces. Shanghai and Guizhou
reported the detail life tracks of confirmed cases in the middle of the epidemic since Feb.9 th and
Feb.5th, respectively. Among the provinces that have never published their life tracks, other seven
other provinces were matched to the seven provinces with the similar population density
respectively. Then we got seven pairs of units, each pair had one unit that published the life tracks
of confirmed cases and one unit did not publish such information. The comparison of daily
confirmed cases and cumulative confirmed cases shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively.
The epidemic was worse in provinces which had no reporting the life tracks.
The comparison of daily confirmed cases in the provinces where the life track is published or not
Through Mann-Whitney U test, it was found that the difference between the two units of six pairs
was statistically significant (Table 2). Compared with the paired province, Tianjin, Jilin, Gansu,
Shanxi, Hainan and Guizhou have significant differences in the number of new confirmed cases
and have lower mean rank (P<0.05). Compared with the matched municipalities, Shanghai has not
significant difference but has a lower mean rank (P=0.175).
Discussion
In this highly mobile world, the outbreak of COVID-19 is a challenging task to China. In
particular, there is a strong person to person transmission(5) and the treatment and prevention
options are limited. To control the novel pathogen could be a challenging task for China. Based on
the prevention and control for MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome)(15, 16) or SARS

(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)(9-12, 17-20), Chinese government had issued some
effective policies or proposed some precautions in case detection and management, vulnerable
population protection, and transmission routes cutting off. To date, these measures are very
effective to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.
An outbreak requires attention in advance to clarity, collaboration, communication, coordination
and capacity(21). During the outbreak of SARS, policies were issued by Chinese government.
Such as media reporting in real time, built Xiaotangshan hospital for confirmed disease, and
published the life tracks of confirmed cases, which may make people were more alert. The spread
of SARS in 2003, also brought to light substantial weaknesses in the country's public-health
system. After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the government increased its
commitment and leadership to tackle public-health problems and, among other efforts, increased
public-health funding, revised laws that concerned the control of infectious diseases, implemented
the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system, and started a program to rebuild local
public-health facilities(22).
For the outbreak of epidemic in the whole country, the prevention and control system should be
changed timely. Different levels of cases should be treated differently. Case detection and
management, vulnerable population protection, and transmission routes cutting off are needed to
decrease the rate of infection. The monitoring of the epidemic by Health Commission is necessary.
Real time media are needed to attract the people’s attention. In this study, we found the provinces
that reported the life tracks for confirmed cases had mild epidemic and less confirmed cases
(Figure 2 and Figure 3). Compared with the paired province, Tianjin, Jilin, Gansu, Shanxi, Hainan
and Guizhou have significant differences in the number of new confirmed cases and have lower
mean rank (P<0.05, table 2). Compared with the matched municipalities, Shanghai has not
significant difference but has a lower mean rank (P=0.175). There may be two reasons for this
result. Firstly, the population densities were the best matched, but there was a big gap between
Beijing and Shanghai. Secondly, the reports on the life tracks for confirmed cases in Shanghai
began later not at the beginning.
From our opinion, there were two advantages for the epidemic prevention and control for
COVID-19. Firstly, in this period, most people stay at home. They always to read the daily media
report, and talk about the number of confirmed cases in Wechat or other media social platforms.
They can be alert if they find the confirmed case living near their house. Or they may avoid to go
the places where the confirmed cases stayed by. So, for the public, reporting the life tracks of
confirmed cases is an effective way to help them keep away from the ‘infectious’ things or the
places. This may good alert for protect the public. Secondly, for tracking the detail information of
life tracks would need more time and work for some of government administration departments.
Whether the local governments are willing to put in the effort and time in it, to some extent, may
showed how meticulous and important the local governments were in their work.
Although the report for the life tracks of confirmed cases had some controversial, it was proved
that this kind of information was effective and feasible in our country. To date, except Wuhan city
and other cities in Hubei province, we found the number of new COVID-19 cases increased
slowly, even in some provinces, there were no new cases increased these days. Nine provinces had
no more than 10 cases, and Xizang and Qinghai provinces had no confirmed case now. Even
Wuhan city had a decreased number of confirmed cases every day. The information showed a
controlled trend for this epidemic outbreak.

The epidemic was under control in China. Still, there were some limitations in our study. Firstly,
the outbreak in China is not over yet. There may be another peak of infection rate with the
resumption of work. Secondly. Wuhan city still had a severe situation now. Anyway, the number of
daily confirmed cases were dropped sharply which showed the effective of epidemic prevention
and control.
Conclusion
COVID-19, with a strong person-to-person transmission made a pandemic in China and outbreak
in Korean, Iran, Italy and Japan. Along with the decreased number of new confirmed cases and the
increased number of recovered cases, there might be a turning corner of COVID-19 in China. This
can be attributed to the success of a serial of emergence public measures and the confidence of the
whole nation, which may be useful for the epidemic prevention and control in other counties.
However, it remains a challenging task to improve the mechanism for major epidemic prevention
and control and the national public health emergency management system.
