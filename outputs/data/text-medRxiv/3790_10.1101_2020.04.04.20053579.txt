Many countries have applied lockdown that helped suppress COVID-19, but with
devastating economic consequences. Here we propose exit strategies from lockdown
that provide sustainable, albeit reduced, economic activity. We use mathematical
models to show that a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10-day lockdown, or
similar variants, can prevent resurgence of the epidemic while providing part-time
employment. The cycle pushes the reproduction number R below one by reduced
exposure time and by exploiting the virus latent period: those infected during work
days reach peak infectiousness during lockdown days. The number of work days
can be adapted in response to observations. Throughout, full epidemiological
measures need to continue including hygiene, physical distancing,
compartmentalization, ​testing and contact tracing. This conceptual framework,
when combined with other interventions to control the epidemic, can offer the
beginnings of predictability to many economic sectors.
Current non-pharmaceutical interventions to suppress COVID-19 use testing, contact
tracing, physical distancing, mask use, identification of regional outbreaks,
compartmentalization down to the neighborhood and company level, and
population-level quarantine at home known as lockdown​1–4​. The aim is to flatten the
infection curve and prevent overload of the medical system until a vaccine becomes
available.
Lockdown is currently in place in many countries. It has a large economic and social
cost, including unemployment on a massive scale. Once a lockdown has reduced the
number of critical cases to a desired goal, a decision must be reached on how to exit it
responsibly. The main concern is the risk of resurgence of the epidemic. One strategy
proposes reinstating lockdown when a threshold number of critical cases is exceeded in a
resurgence, and stopping lockdown again once cases drop below a low threshold​2,5,6 (Fig
1A,S1). While such an “adaptive triggering” strategy can prevent healthcare services
from becoming overloaded, it leads to economic uncertainty and continues to accumulate
cases with each resurgence.

Fig. 1 | Cyclic work-lockdown strategy can suppress the epidemic, prevent resurgence and offer
predictable part-time employment. ​a) Exit from lockdown carries the risk of resurgence of the epidemic,
with need to re-enter prolonged lockdown. b) A cyclic work-lockdown strategy prevents resurges by
keeping the average R<1. It thus allows an earlier exit from lockdown, and provides a clear part-time work
schedule. Transmission rates provide R in lockdown and work days of RL = 0.6 and RW = 1.5 respectively.

Here we carefully propose an exit strategy from lockdown that can prevent resurgence of
the epidemic while allowing sustained, albeit reduced, economic activity. The strategy
can be implemented when lockdown has succeeded in stabilizing the number of daily
critical cases to a value that the health system can support. Hereafter when we say
‘lockdown’ we mean population-level quarantine at home, together with all other
available interventions such as testing and social distancing.
The basic idea is to keep the effective reproduction number R, defined as the average
number of people infected by each infected individual, below 1. When R is below 1, the
number of infected people declines exponentially, a basic principle of epidemiology.
To reduce R below 1, we propose a cyclic schedule with k continuous days of work
followed by n continuous days of lockdown. As shown below, 4 days of work and 10
days of lockdown is a reasonable cycle that allows a repeating 2-week schedule.
Epidemiological measures should be used and improved throughout, including rapid
testing, contact isolation and compartmentalization of workplaces and regions. The cyclic
strategy can thus be considered as a component of the evolving policy toolkit that can be
combined with other interventions.
By “work days” we mean release from lockdown with strict hygiene and physical
distancing measures on the same k weekdays for everyone. It can include the entire
population including schools, except for quarantined infected individuals and people in
risk groups who may be in quarantine. More conservatively, it can include workers in
selected sectors of the economy. Remote work should be encouraged for sectors that can
work from home.

A staggered cyclic strategy is also predicted to be effective, in which the population is
divided into two sets of households that work on alternating weeks​7​, each with a
k-work:(14-k)-lockdown schedule (Fig 2). The staggered strategy has the advantage that
production lines can work throughout the month and transmission during workdays is
reduced due to lower density, whereas the non-staggered strategy has the advantage that
lockdown days are easier to enforce.

Fig. 2 | Staggered cyclic work-lockdown strategy in which the population is divided into two groups of
households that work on alternating weeks. ​Shown is I(t) from the SEIR-Erlang deterministic model with
mean latent period of 3 days and mean infectious period 4 days 8​ .​ Transmission rates in lockdown and work
give RL = 0.6 and RW = 1.5 respectively. Density compensation is ϕ = 1.5 and non-compliance is 10%
(see Methods).

The cyclic strategies reduce the mean R by two effects: ​restriction and ​anti-phasing​. The
restriction effect is a reduction in the time T that an infectious person is in contact with
many others, compared to the situation with no lockdown. For example, a 4-day work:
10-day lockdown cycle reduces T to 2/7 T ≈ 0.3T.
The anti-phasing effect uses the timescales of the virus against itself (Fig. 3). Most
infected people are close to peak infectiousness for about 3-5 days, beginning ≈3 days
after being exposed​9,10​. A proper work-lockdown cycle, such as a 4-work:10-lockdown
schedule, allows most of those infected during work days to reach maximal
infectiousness during lockdown, and thus avoid infecting many others. Those with
symptoms can be infectious for longer 10​
​ , but can be detected by their symptoms and
remain hospitalized, isolated or (self-)quarantined along with their household members,
preventing secondary infections outside the household.
The staggered cyclic strategy can further reduce mean R by reducing density during work
days, leading to lower transmission rates (Methods).

The cyclic strategy can be synergistically combined with rapid testing and contact
isolation. Household-level testing at the end of the lockdown period and before return to
work or school can help shorten infection chains.

Fig. 3 | The cyclic exit strategy is aided by placing peak infectiousness in the lockdown days.
SARS-CoV-2 has an average latent (non-infectious) period of about 3 days. A 14-day cycle in which people
enter lockdown after 3 or 4 work days benefits from this property. Even those infected on the first day of
work spend most of their latent period at work and reach peak infectiousness during lockdown. This
reduces the number of secondary infections.

Simulations using a variety of epidemiological models, including SEIR models and
stochastic network-based simulations, show that a cyclic strategy can suppress the
epidemic provided that the lockdown is effective enough (Fig. 4, Table 1). A 4-10 cycle
seems to work well for a range of parameters and is robust to uncertainties in the model
(Fig. S2, S3). In these simulations, the transmission parameters during work days and
lockdown days can be described by the effective replication numbers that describe
extended periods of work and lockdown conditions, RW and RL , respectively. If
lockdown is as strong as strong as in some chinese cities, with estimated R L ≈ 0.3 11,12​, a
4-10 cycle suppresses the epidemic even if workday RW is as large as in the early days
of the epidemic in Europe, with RW ≈ 3 − 4 13​. A weaker lockdown, with
R L ≈ 0.6 − 0.8 , as currently estimated in several European countries (April 20, 2020)​14
can support a cyclic strategy with 2-4 work days when strict measures are enforced
during workdays providing RW ≈ 1.5 − 2 (Table 1). Simulation on social networks
provides a similar range of conditions of a cyclic strategy to control the epidemic (Fig
S5). Ideally, measures will eventually bring R during workdays down below 1, as in
South Korea's control of the epidemic in early 2020, making lockdown unnecessary.

An important consideration is that the cyclic strategy is adaptive, and can be tuned when
conditions change and the effects of the approach are monitored. For example, weather
conditions may affect R​5,6​, as well as advances in regional monitoring and contact tracing.
If one detects, for example, that a 4:10 strategy leads to an increasing trend in cases, one
can shift to a cycle with fewer work days. Conversely, if a strong decreasing trend is
observed, one can shift to more work days and gain economic benefit (Fig 5). A
conservative approach can exit lockdown with 1 day of work, build up to two days, and
so on.

Fig. 5 | The cyclic strategy can be tuned according to the trends in case numbers over weeks. ​(a) I​ f
average R is above 1, cases will show a rising trend, and number of work days in the cycle can be reduced
to achieve control. ​(b) Number of work days per cycle can be increased when control meets a desired
health goal.

Measures will be required during the work days to ensure that people do not excessively
compensate for the lockdown periods by having so many more social connections that R
is strongly increased. This may include sound epidemiological measures such as the
continuation of banning large social events and clear communication campaigns by the
health authorities to enhance adherence to hygiene and physical distancing. Shared work
spaces can be disinfected to reduce future infection through surfaces. Extensive rapid
testing and contact tracing should be developed and extended in parallel​15​.
The economic benefits of a cyclic strategy include part-time employment to millions who
have been put on leave without pay or who have lost their jobs. This mitigates massive
unemployment and business bankruptcy during lockdown. Prolonged unemployment
during lockdown and the recession that is expected to follow can reduce worker skill and
carries major societal drawbacks. Unemployment also has detrimental health effects
which include exacerbation of existing physical and mental illnesses. High levels of
unemployment have been associated with increases in morbidity and mortality 16​
​ .
The cyclic strategy offers a measure of economic predictability, potentially enhancing
consumer and investor confidence in the economy which is essential for growth and
recovery. It can also be equitable and transparent in terms of who gets to exit lockdown.
For these reasons, a cyclic strategy can be maintained for far longer than continuous
lockdown. This allows time for developing a vaccine, treatment, rapid testing and buildup
of herd immunity without overwhelming health care capacity.
The cyclic strategy does not seem to have a long-term cost in terms of COVID-19 cases
compared to a start-stop lockdown policy triggered by resurgences. Comparing the two
strategies shows that in the mid-term and long term, the start-stop strategy accumulates

more cases due to resurgences (Fig. 5). This does not depend heavily on parameters: the
fundamental reason is that new cases arise during each resurgence. Thus, a strategy that
restarts lockdown with every resurgence uses feedback to effectively keep average R
close to 1, and continues to accumulate cases. In contrast, the cyclic strategy keeps
average R below one, and thus prevents resurgences.

Fig. 6 | The cumulative number of cases under a cyclic strategy is lower at long times than in a strategy
that restarts lockdown when the epidemic resurges. Cumulative number of cases is shown for the
simulations of Fig 1a (red) and Fig1b (blue). Even though exit from lockdown is earlier in the cyclic
strategy case, the cumulative number of cases associated with this strategy is lower in the long term than
the accumulated cases when lockdown is released and then restarted once the epidemic resurges. The
relative benefit of the cyclic strategy is further increased by considering non-COVID-19-related health
consequences of extended lockdown during resurgences, alleviated by the cyclic strategy.

The cyclic strategy can apply at many scales: to a company, a school, a town or an entire
country. Regions or organizations that adopt this strategy are predicted to resist infections
from the outside. An infection entering from the outside cannot spread widely because
average R<1. After enough time, if this is applied globally, there is even a possibility for
the epidemic to be eradicated, in the absence of mutations or unknown reservoirs.
The cyclic strategy can work in regions with insufficient testing capacity, as long as the
lockdown phases provide low enough transmission. This may apply to a large part of the
earth’s population.
The exact nature of the intervention can be tuned to optimize economy and minimize
infection. It can be tested for a limited duration such as a month, and in a limited region.
The cyclic strategy can be synergistically combined with other approaches to suppress the
epidemic and address the economic crisis.

Methods
SEIR
model:
​The
deterministic
SEIR
model
is
dS /dt =− βSI, dE /dt = βSI − σE, dI / dt = σE − γI , where S,E and I are the susceptible,
exposed (noninfectious) and infectious fractions. Parameters calibrated for COVID-19 8​
are σ = 13 day​-1​; γ = 14 day​-1​, and S=1 is used to model situations far from herd immunity.
The values used for β are defined in each plot where R = β / γ . The analytical solution
for cyclic strategies is in (SI).
SEIR-Erlang model: The SEIR model describes an exponential distribution of the
lifetimes of the exposed and infectious compartments. In reality these distributions show
a mode near the mean. To describe this, we split E and I into two artificial serial
compartments each with half the mean lifetime of the original compartment 17​
​ . This
describes Erlang-distributed lifetimes (the distribution of the sum of two exponentially
distributed random variables) with the same mean transition rates as the original SEIR
model.
Thus, dS/dt =− β SI, dE 1 /dt = β SI − 2σE 1 , dE 2 /dt = 2σE 1 − 2σE 2 , dI 1 /dt =
2σE 2 − 2γI 1 , dI 2 /dt = 2γI 1 − 2γI 2 , where I = I 1 + I 2 , and R = β / γ . In the figures
we used a worst-case assumption of no herd immunity, namely S ≈ 1 . Herd immunity
further reduces case numbers. Case numbers are in arbitrary units, and can describe large
or small outbreaks. The deterministic simulation describes a fully-mixed population.
Population structure typically reduces overall outbreak peak size 18
​ compared to a fully
mixed situation with the same mean transmission rate, but includes the possibility of high
attack rates in certain sub-populations.
Staggered cyclic strategy, SEIR-Erlang model: ​We model two groups, A and B, with a
susceptible, exposed, infectious and removed compartment for each group. The SEIR-Erlang
model for group A is:
dS A /dt = − f A (S A , I A , t)
dE A,1 /dt = f A (S A , I A , t) − 2σE A,1
dE A,2 /dt = 2σE A,1 − 2σ E A,2
dI A,1 /dt = 2σE A,2 − 2γ I A,1
dI A,2 /dt = 2γI A,1 − 2γI A,2
dRA /dt = 2γI A,2
I A,tot = I A,1 + I A,2
and an analogous equation for group B. We assume that each group consists of half of the
population. This causes density at work to be reduced 7​​ . For ease of comparison to the
non-staggered case, we refer to the replication numbers of a single fully mixed population with a
cyclic strategy, namely R = RW on work days and R = RL during lockdown. In the staggered
case, during lockdown, as opposed to work, individuals from a group interact primarily with their
own household. The density in the household is not affected by dividing the population into two
staggered work groups. Hence, the effective R remains RL .
f A (S A , I A , t = A lockdown day) = 2RL γS A I A

Where the factor of 2 normalizes S A = 0.5 . During work days, we can estimate the number of
transmissions at work and not at home by RW − RL . This gives the following equation:
f A (S A , I A , t = A work day) = (2RL + (RW − RL ))γS A I A
With analogous equations for group B.
We next model cross-transmission between the groups. Due to the expected difficulty of
enforcing a staggered work schedule as compared to a non-staggered cycle strategy, we assume a
leakage term due to a fraction of individuals ρ from each group that does not adhere to their
lockdown. These non-adherers instead interact with the other group during the other groups’ work
days.
When group B is in lockdown, infectious non-adherers from group B can infect individuals from
group A who are in their work days. This rate is modeled as proportional to the replication
number for people infected at work and not at home, RW − RL :
f A (S A , I A , S B , I B , t = A work day, B lockdown day) = (2RL + (RW − RL ))γS A I A + ρ(RW − RL )γS A I B
When individuals from group A are in lockdown and non-adhere, they can be infected from
individuals from group B on group B work days. We also add a higher-order term for susceptible
‘leaking’ individuals from group A that meet non-adherent infectious ‘leaking’ individuals from
group A during group A lockdown:
f A (S A , I A , t = A lockdown day, B work day) = 2RL γS A I A + ρ(RW − RL )γS A I B + ρ2 (RW − RL )γS A I A
When both groups are in lockdown at the same time, there is no leakage:
f A (S A , I A , t = A lockdown day, B lockdown day) = 2RL γS A I A
Note that for complete leakage ρ = 1 and under symmetry assumptions I 1 = I 2 , the equations
become identical to the case of a single fully mixed population:
f A (S A , I A , S B , I B , t = A work day) = 2RW γS A I A
f A (S A , I A , S B , I B , t = A lockdown day) = 2RL γS A I A
So far, we assumed that density at work is half that of the non-staggered case. However, in
practice, compensatory mechanisms might lead to a higher effective density. For example, people
might cluster to maintain a level of social interaction, or certain work-day situations may require
a fixed density of individuals. These effects can be modelled by adding a density compensation
parameter ϕ which rescales the work-day infection rate. This number is ϕ = 2 for complete
compensation of infectivity where density at work is not affected by partitioning, or ϕ = 1 is the
staggered model above with half the density at work. We obtain the following equations:
f 1 (S A , I A , S B , I B , t = A work day, B lockdown day) = (2RL + ϕ(RW − RL ))γS A I A + ρϕ(RW − RL )γS A I B
f 1 (S A , I A , t = A lockdown day, B work day) = 2RL γS A I A + ρϕ(RW − RL )γS A I B + ρ2 ϕ(RW − RL )γS A I A
With analogous equations for group B.

Stochastic SEIR model on social networks with epidemiological measures: ​We also
simulated a stochastic SEIR process on social contact networks. Each node i represents
an individual and can be in a susceptible, exposed, infected or removed state (i.e.
quarantined, recovered or dead). Lifetime in the E and I states is drawn from an Erlang
distribution of shape 2 with means T E and T I . The total infectivity of a node β i is
drawn from a long tailed distribution to account for super-spreaders. The probability of
infection per social link j, q ij , is set either constant for all links connected to node i or
drawn from an exponential distribution to account for heterogeneity in infection rates.
Node states are updated at each time step. Network models include Erdos-Renyi and
small world networks. During lockdown, a fraction of the links are inactivated (same
links for each lockdown phase).
Linearity of transmission risk with exposure time: ​In order for restriction of exposure
time to be effective, probability of infection must drop appreciably when exposure time is
reduced. This requires a low average infection probability per unit time per social
contact, q, so that probability of infection, p = 1 − exp(− q T ) , does not come close to 1
for exposure time T on the order of days. For COVID-19, an infected person infects on
the order of R=3 people on average during the infectious period of mean duration D=4
days. If the mean number of social contacts is C, which is estimated at greater than 10,
one has q~DR/C<0.1/day. Thus infection probability on the scale of hours to a few days
is approximately linear with exposure time: 1 − exp(− q T ) ≈ q T . This is consistent with
the observation that infected people do not typically infect their entire household, and
with the linearity observed in influenza transmission​19​. We also tested a scenario using
network models in which some contacts have much higher q than others (exponentially
distributed q between links). A mildly lower R in lockdown is required to provide a given
benefit of the cyclic strategy than when q is the same for all links.

Fig. S3 A SIR deterministic model captures some of the effects. (​ A) The SIR model (right panel) lacks the
exposed (non-infectious) compartment. It shows that the cyclic lockdown strategies can control the
epidemic, but at smaller parameter regions for each given strategy than the SEIR-Erlang model (left
panel). The difference is biggest at large ratios of R at work and lockdown, where SEIR-Erlang has an
advantage. The SIR model is dS/dt =− β SI, dI/dt = β SI − γ I . The replication number is R = β / γ. Here
γ = 1/7 day −1 (the plot is unaffected by this parameter), and S=1. Effective R in the SIR model is the
average R weighted by the fraction of time for work and lockdown. F

SI section: Economic perspective on cyclic lockdown strategies
We summarize work on the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic and its attendant
lockdown policies. Then, and in light of this discussion, we discuss some of the economic
implications of the adaptive cyclic exit strategy.
Pandemics and the policy reaction to them constitute a real, substantial, and sudden supply shock
to the economy. The following economic mechanisms can be outlined, based on empirical studies
of past pandemics and of COVID 19:
a. They engender a substantial fall in GDP and its uses. Analyses of the economic
consequences of the 1918 Spanish flu (Great Influenza Pandemic) found that the
influenza led to 39 million deaths (which translate to 150 million deaths in 2020
terms), a drop in GDP of 6%, and a consumption decline of 8% in typical countries.
These losses are comparable to those seen in the last global Great Recession of
2008-2009​20​. In fact, the expected annual cost of pandemic influenza falls in the same
range as does that of climate change between 0.2% and 2% of global income. A
pandemic that exceeds 720,000 deaths per year worldwide would cost $570 billion
per year ($80 billion in lost income and $490 billion in mortality cost), 0.7% of
global income​21​.
b. Longer term costs ​may emerge via hysteresis effects, whereby a temporary rise in
unemployment, engendered by the fall in GDP, generates a permanently higher
one​22,23​. This may entail loss of skill by the unemployed over time, leading them to be
“unemployable”​24​.
c. Following the decline in supply, demand declines too. Thus consumption and
investment decline​25 is a recent treatment of the mechanism applied to the current
context). It is to be expected that fiscal demand policy will respond in terms of health
policy expenditures, ​disaster relief, provision of funds to liquidity-constrained
households and firms, and general support of aggregate demand​22,25​.

d. The pandemic may lead to disruption in financial markets, including the banking
system and stock markets.
In the current paper, which deals with an exit strategy from lockdown policies, the economic
mechanism underlying the effects of such policies is particularly important. It was recently
analyzed, for COVID 19, by ​Kaplan, Moll, and Violante​26​. A key idea in this analysis is that the
replication number is a function of economic variables, including consumption of "social" goods
and market work (labor). The social good is one that involves many social interactions, such as
going to a restaurant. Economic outcomes under lockdown policies are determined by the
operation of at least two margins: (i) how flexible is each job in terms of working remotely; and
(ii) whether production is intense in the social good (i.e., has high inputs of the social good) or in
the regular consumption good. The authors give the example of waiters and shop assistants jobs
as inflexible and high on social goods; in contrast, the production of a software engineer or an
architect is highly flexible and not intense in the social good. Lockdown policy and economic

behavior affect the transmission rate β{t} and hence the epidemic dynamics and its economic
costs, with dependence on the cited two margins. The mechanism is as follows: the initial effects
of the epidemic and lockdown policy affect production and consumption; depending on how
consumption and production of the social good are affected, β{t} is affected in turn; hence,
epidemic dynamics are affected, and in turn influence production and consumption once more,
and the process is iterated. The authors aim at modelling the emerging tradeoff between health
and economic outcomes, given policy choices under this mechanism. They conjecture that there
may be a region where both health and economic outcomes could be improved. The current
proposal of a cyclic strategy aims at such improvement.
Lockdown policies have exerted a heavy toll in COVID19. A nowcast estimate for France by
Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques (INSEE) placed output decline in
[i]
March 2020, when France was on tight lockdown, at 35 percent below normal.​ An estimate by
[ii]​
the UK Office for Budget Responsibility put the second quarter UK GDP decline at 35%​ .
[iii]
Forecasts by the IMF,​
central banks and investment banks speak of declines in the whole of
2020, including a recovery phase, of 6%-12% of GDP. This is based on fairly optimistic scenarios
of lockdown phase-out and resumption of normal activity.
The cyclic exit strategy from these lockdowns, proposed here, has at least two major types of
effects:
First, it provides for a partial release from the lockdown, enabling more production and
consumption. This has positive effects in terms of predictability, production projections and
sharing, consumption planning, work in the informal sector, and more. For countries or regions
that have a high share of the informal sector, the cyclic strategy can make lockdown days more
bearable and hence enhance adherence.
It does have some disadvantages. For example, not all economic sectors may benefit similarly
from the scheme. Thus, social good sectors that heavily rely on human contact such as flights,
hotels, or restaurants are less likely to operate smoothly under this scheme, unless they make
pronounced adjustments. However, the staggered version of the cyclic scheme alleviates some
such potential problems, relating to disruptions in production continuity. The staggered strategy
has the advantage that production can work throughout the month and transmission during
workdays is reduced due to lower density, whereas the non-staggered strategy has the advantage
that lockdown days are easier to enforce.
Second, by the dephasing effect that takes advantage of the latent period of the virus, it engenders
relatively good health outcomes. At the same time it has beneficial ​non-Covid related health
effects. For example, lack of medical testing such as colonoscopies or mammography, and
disruptions in treatment, such as for blood pressure, end up costing lost life years. Lack of routine
medical maintenance, such as dentistry and family medicine, end up creating even more damage.
Likewise, for lack of mental health treatment, suicides, and more. Cyclic strategy can relieve
these costs by lessening the disruptions. It should be recalled that such big-scale economic events,

involving deep recessions, may lead to ​deaths of despair; see the recent comprehensive review by
Case and Deaton​27​, who have done ground- breaking work on this issue.
The cyclic strategy has the potential to lighten the harsh tradeoff faced by policymakers. The
essential mechanisms here are as follows: policy and economic behavior influence R{t} and
worker participation in employment. Health and economic outcomes thus depend on the
interaction between three dynamic paths:
a. R{t}
b. Worker employment.
c. Stop-start policy on lockdowns, dependent on I and on ICU capacity.
Better economic outcomes will be achieved the lower is the path of R{t} (point a), the higher is
employment (point b), and the fewer lockdown resumptions there are (point c).
In this setup the cyclic k,14-k strategy has the following expected effects:
a. It increases economic activity, as it releases part of the lockdown.
b. While it does not fully improve COVID-19 outcomes (as it has periods of work with
higher R) in the short term, it improves them in the mid-long term by preventing resurgences (Fig
5). This improves the tradeoffs faced by policymakers.
c. Any comparison to actual lockdowns depends on the relations between the three
dynamic paths above in the cyclic strategy and in the actual policy strategy. In certain cases of
these relations, the cyclic strategy can even improve health outcomes relative to existing
lockdown outcomes.
d. The latent period idea serves to optimally determine k by minimizing the effective β{t}
or R{t}. Hence it has effects operating to lower the path of R{t}, point a above.
To conclude, the cyclic strategy, utilizing the latent period of the coronavirus to optimize the
cycle of work and lockdown, is a way to significantly ameliorate the health-economic tradeoffs
faced by policymakers.
