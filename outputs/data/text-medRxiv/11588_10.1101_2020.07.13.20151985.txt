Abstract
COVID-19 pandemic has caused a severe demand for facemasks, and this has resulted in the use
of those made from alternate media. As SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily due to airborne droplets,
it is critical to verify the filtration efficiency of these alternate media based facemasks. While
several media are being tested and used, commercially available dust cleaners have shown
reasonable filtration efficiency. This may also be due to the potential electrostatic charge on the
surface which enhances capture of the fine particles. In this manuscript, we report the size
dependent filtration efficiency studied systematically in a filter holder-based system as 47 mm
punches; and test results on a mannequin that was 3D printed wearing a bandana mask that was
placed in a chamber.
1. Introduction
COVID-19 pandemic has left numerous communities in a dearth of commercial face masks and
thus several masks from alternate filter media are being manufactured (Kampf et al., 2020). SARSCoV-2 is considered to primarily spread via respiratory droplets (Lu et al., 2020; Wong et al.,
2020). SARS-CoV-2 aerosols have increased airborne fitness in comparison with SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV (Fears et al., 2020). Presently, the efficacy of these masks in filtering the virus is
unknown. With the governments slowly lifting restrictions, specifically in the United States,
several businesses are set to reopen, making it inevitable for individuals to wear face masks. It is
important to note that even if these masks are not highly efficient, they will mitigate the spread of
the pandemic (Feng et al., 2020).
The size of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is approximately 100 nm in dry state (Zhu et al., 2020), whereas
when suspended in respiratory droplets, will be higher and the droplet size can go up to 10 μm or
even larger. However, larger droplets settle faster, while smaller droplets have higher airborne
lifetime thereby increasing the potential for infection (Biswas & Dhawan, 2020). It is therefore
important to evaluate size dependent aerosol filtration efficiency of the alternate filter media, as
they are not very efficient. This information will be critical in designing and manufacturing
facemasks from readily available, cheap alternate media.
Considering the different materials that are being tested and used, one promising class of materials
are dust cleaners such as Swiffer (P&G, Brown et al., 2004). As this is a commonly available
material, the objective of this paper was to report the characterization results for Swiffer as an
alternate filter media material and evaluate the size-dependent filtration efficiency. Two systems
were used: one as 47 mm punches in a filter holder assembly systems, and second when placed on
a mannequin as a home-made mask (Bandana type) with swiffer material layered between pillowcase fabrics and in 3-D printed facemask filter holders. The collection efficiency as a function of
particle size and the resultant pressure drops are reported.

2. Materials and Methods
The filtration efficiency was tested using two different test methods. In the first approach, 47 mm
discs were extracted from the filter media and tested in a filter holder assembly, such that the
filtration efficiency in a perfectly sealed system can be measured. This would be representative of
the efficacy of filtration of the media. While in the second approach, the material was placed in a
facemask that was fitted to a mannequin housed in a chamber. These second group of tests are
reflective of the filtration efficiency under more realistic conditions accounting for leaks when
used by a person. As stated earlier, the dust cleaner material used as filtration media in this study
was a Swiffer type material (P&G, Brown et al., 2004). This material has certain electrostatic
characteristics to promote the sticking of the dust particles onto the fiber surface.
In both the approaches, the challenge aerosol was generated from a 0.3 M NaCl solution in DI
water utilizing a Collision Nebulizer (Single Jet, BGI/Mesa Labs), which was then dried in a
Diffusion Drier (Model 3062, TSI Inc.) and then neutralized using a neutralizer, which uses a
radioactive source (Kr-85). The neutralized polydisperse challenge aerosols is diluted with
Nitrogen gas to achieve the desired number concentration and flow rate of aerosols. In both
methods, the Particle Size Distribution (PSD) of the aerosol was measured using a scanning
mobility particle sizer (SMPS), upstream and downstream to the filter media assembly. The SMPS
consists of an in-line neutralizer, a differential mobility analyzer (TSI DMA Model 3081), in which
the particles are classified based on their electrical mobilities, and a condensation particle counter
(TSI CPC Model 3750) to count the total number concentration of the classified particles.
2.1. Filter holder-based system
The schematic of the filter holder-based system is shown in Figure 1. The diluted challenge
aerosols are fed to the filter holder (PN 2220 47mm stainless steel filter holder, Gelman Sciences).
A magnehelic differential pressure gauge (Dwyer, Michigan City, IN) was used to measure the
pressure drop across the filter holder. The total flow across the filter holder is controlled by a mass
flow controller (Omega), downstream the filter holder. The filtration efficiency (𝜂𝑓𝑒 ) for each size
class was calculated as:
𝑁𝐹𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑
(1)
(𝜂𝑓𝑒 ) = 1 −
.
𝑁𝑈𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑
𝑁𝐹𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑 and 𝑁𝑈𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑 were the concentration of each size class measured using the SMPS
downstream to the filter holder with and without the filter media.

filtration efficiency.

2.2. Mannequin in chamber-based system
The schematic of this method is show in Figure 2. The diluted challenge aerosol was fed into a
custom-built acrylic glass chamber (Dimensions: 48 x 24 x 24 inch), sealed with gaskets to ensure
uniform size distributions. Two fans were installed at diagonally opposite positions to improve
circulation and attain uniform PSD at the sampling points. The facemask was fitted to a
mannequin, which was placed at the center of the chamber. The filtration efficiency for each size
class was calculated using Eq. 1 wherein 𝑁𝑈𝑛𝐹𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑 and 𝑁𝐹𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑 were the concentration of each
size class measured using the SMPS in front of the masks, and behind the mask though the nostril
of the mannequin.

The measured size dependent filtration efficiency of Swiffer punches is shown in Figure 3 (a). The
Swiffer material is very efficient in filtering ultra-fine particles (< 80 nm). This is primarily
because of the fibrous structures of the Swiffer material trap the ultrafine particles by diffusional
capture. The filtration efficiency drops as the particle size increase which is because the fibers are
loosely packed and particles that follow the streamlines of the gas get through the material. The
highest efficiencies are seen for the case in which two layers of Swiffer is stacked in between two
layers of pillowcase fabric. The efficiency ranged from 45 – 62 % for particle sizes between 100
– 500 nm, with the minimum around 300 nm. However, when the layers are doubled, the filtration
efficiency increases, and the percent increase is higher for larger particles. For instance, the
efficiency of filtration for 200 nm particles increases from 45 % to 65 % (44.4 % increase), whereas
for 500 nm, the efficiency increases from 30 % to 58 % (93.3 % increase). The pressure drop for
a single layer was 0.01 inch of water and it doubled when the two layers were used, and quadrupled
for the third case considered as is shown in Figure 3 (b).

The 3D printed facemask is shown in Figure 4 (a). The filtration efficiency of a double-layered
Swiffer material in the 3D printed face mask and filter holder are shown in Figure 4 (b). Similar
observations in the variation of filtration efficiency with particle size can be observed. The
filtration efficiency is higher at lower particle sizes and decreases gradually as the size increases.
The relative higher filtration efficiency of the smaller particles (< 30 nm) can be attributed to
diffusional losses behind the mask. These diffusing particles escape the sampling probe and
deposit on the mannequin’s surface. The relative lower filtration efficiency of the larger particles
is due to the leakage around the sides on the filter in the 3D printed mask. As larger particles follow

the streamlines of the gas, they escape the filter and reach the nostril. It is therefore important to
ensure a perfect seal to achieve the highest possible efficiency.

A fabric-based facemask (Bandana mask) sewn from pillow-case fabric, shown in Figure 5 (a) was
tested in the mannequin in chamber-based system with the Swiffer filter material. Two layers of
Swiffer material were placed inside the sewn fabric. Its size dependent filtration efficiency as
compared to the filtration efficiency measured in a filter holder-based system is shown in Figure
5 (b). The relative higher efficiency of capture of smaller particles in the bandana mask is attributed
to diffusional losses during sampling as previously explained in Section 3.2. The filtration
efficiency is relatively lower in the Bandana mask as compared to that in a filter holder.

The effect of air inspiration rate on filtration efficiency of the Swiffer material in a Bandana mask
is studied. The measured size dependent filtration efficiency is shown in Figure 6 (a). The filtration
efficiency drops for higher inspiration rate and the extent of decrease is higher for larger particles
as compared to smaller particles. Furthermore, Figure 6 (b) shows the effect of filter exposure time
on a double layer 47 mm punch in the filter holder system. Each SMPS scan takes a minute and
hence the filtration efficiency at the first, 12th and 18th minutes are shown. While, the variation in
efficiency is not significant, it can be observed that the filtration efficiency increases with time for
smaller particles and decreases with time for larger particles.
4. Conclusions
The size dependent filtration efficiency of dust cleaning swiffer material in a filter holder- and
mannequin in chamber-based systems is reported. It was found that the highest filtration
efficiencies for sizes between 100 – 500 nm, ranged between 45 – 62 % with a minimum at 300
nm for the case in which two layers of Swiffer were stacked within two layers of pillowcase fabric
tested in the filter holder-based system. The filtration efficiency under these conditions when tested
on 3D printed mannequins and masks were close to the filter holder-based system and was
relatively lower in the bandana type mask.
