Abstract

50

Objectives: To prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, it

51

is necessary for each individual to adopt infection prevention behavior. We investigated

52

the effect of infection control measures implemented in the workplace on personal

53

infection prevention behavior.

54

Methods: We conducted a self-administered questionnaire survey through the Internet

55

from December 22 to 25, 2020, during which period COVID-19 was spreading. Among

56

respondents aged 20 to 65 years (n=27,036), a total of 21,915 workers were included in

57

the analysis after excluding self-employed workers (n=2,202), workers in small/home

58

offices (n=377), and agriculture, forestry, and fisheries workers (n=212), etc., whose

59

personal infection prevention behavior was almost the same as infection control

60

measures taken in the workplace.

61

Results: The results showed that as the number of infection control measures in the

62

workplace increased, implementation of infection prevention behavior by individuals

63

also significantly increased. However, the relationship differed depending on the type of

64

personal infection prevention behavior. Specifically, infection control measures against

65

COVID-19 in the workplace may affect personal infection prevention behavior.

66

Conclusion: Implementation of infection control measures in the workplace appears to

67

deepen personal understanding of infection prevention behaviors, and increases

68

awareness of the importance of individual infection prevention behavior and its

69

implementation by all individuals. These findings may be applicable not only to

70

COVID-19 measures but also to responses to other emerging infections and seasonal

71

influenza.

Introduction

75

An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China in

76

December 2019, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a “Public Health

77

Emergency of International Concern” on January 30, 2020.1 The WHO recommends

78

taking all measures, such as avoiding the 3Cs (closed spaces, crowded places, and

79

close-contact settings), wearing a mask, and opening windows, to protect the individual

80

and others from COVID-19. In order to prevent the spread of the infection, it is

81

necessary not only to take measures nationally and regionally, such as prohibiting travel

82

or outings around the world, but also to ensure that infection prevention behavior is

83

implemented at an individual level.2

84

Workplaces where many workers share the same space are generally vulnerable

85

to the spread of infectious diseases. Therefore, from the perspective of business

86

continuity, companies need to actively adopt telework, in accordance with the

87

guidelines issued by the government and related organizations and checklists of the

88

specific infection control measures, etc. If telework is not possible, it is necessary to

89

implement feasible infection control measures to prevent infection in the workplace, in

90

addition to basic measures (social distancing, wearing a mask, washing hands).3

91

However, disease clusters in the workplace are still being reported: for an approximately

92

one-month period around December 2020, the Japanese media reported a total of 95

93

workplace-related disease clusters with five or more people, involving 1,103 persons in

94

Japan.4 Reasons for these disease clusters were eating while talking face-to-face without

95

wearing a mask, staying in a poorly ventilated room, seating close to other workers, and

96

failure to disinfect shared items and equipment, etc.5

97

However, even if the infection control measures in the workplace are properly

98

implemented, infection cannot be completely prevented if workers do not adopt

99

appropriate infection prevention behavior, or if infection prevention behavior outside

100

the workplace is not appropriate. It has been demonstrated that the establishment of a

101

safe and healthy work environment under a policy of health maintenance and promotion

102

in the workplace has a positive impact on the health of individual workers,6-8 and this

103

may also be applicable to infection control measures for COVID-19. In other words,

104

good infection control measures in the workplace may lead to personal prevention

105

behavior against infection among workers. It has been reported that training managers is

106

an effective and efficient way to educate workers about health issues in the workplace.9

107

Furthermore, it has been reported that when managers reach out to their workers,

108

influenza vaccination rates increase.10

109

In a survey of Chinese occupational fields, China at the time of a factory restart

110

after lockdown for COVID-19, it was reported that the number of preventive measures

111

implemented by the factory in Shenzhen was associated with self-reported compliance

112

with all four personal preventive measures (wearing a face mask consistently in any

113

public space; sanitizing hands every time after returning from public spaces or touching

114

installations; avoiding social and meal gatherings with people who do not live together;

115

and avoiding crowded places) .11 Since this survey only included factory workers in one

116

city in China at the time of factory restart after a lockdown in which strict measures

117

were imposed, further investigations were deemed necessary to generalize the

118

association between workplace infection control measures and workers' personal

119

infection prevention behavior. Here therefore, we conducted an Internet survey during

120

the period when COVID-19 infection was spreading in Japan and examined the

121

relationship between infection control measures in the workplace and personal infection

122

prevention behavior.

123

Materials and Methods

124

A research group from the University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan,

125

conducted a prospective cohort study, known as the Collaborative Online Research on

126

Novel-coronavirus and Work study (CORoNaWork study), as a self-administered

127

questionnaire survey via an internet survey company (Cross Marketing Inc.; Tokyo,

128

Japan). During the baseline survey, conducted from December 22 to 25, 2020, Japan

129

was in the midst of its third wave of the pandemic, at which point the number of

130

COVID-19 infections and deaths was markedly higher than in the first and second

131

waves, and the country was accordingly on high alert.

132

A portion of the baseline survey responses from the CORoNaWork study was

133

used to conduct the present cross-sectional study. The study protocol, including the

134

sampling plan and subject recruitment procedure, has been reported elsewhere in detail.

135

Participants were aged 20-65 years who were working at the time of the baseline survey

136

(n = 33,087 total). For participation in the CORoNaWork study, they were stratified by

137

disease cluster sampling for gender, age, region, and occupation. After excluding 6,051

138

initial subjects who provided invalid responses, we included 27,036 in the database.

139

The flow diagram of this study is shown in Figure 1. Respondents were asked

140

to answer yes/no to the following two questions about COVID-19 infection: “Have you

141

had COVID-19?” and “Have you come in close contact with a person infected with

142

COVID-19?” Those who answered yes to either question were excluded from the study

143

(n=399). We also excluded self-employed workers (2,202), workers in small/home

144

offices (377) and those in agriculture, forestry, and fishing (212) because of the need to

145

evaluate infection control measures in the workplace. Workplaces with four or fewer

146

employees were excluded from the analysis because it can be assumed that infection

147

control measures in the workplace and personal infection prevention behavior were

148

closely similar (one employee (n=2524) and 2-4 employees (n=1974)). We finally

149

analyzed 21,915 workers.

150

Assessment of infection control measures in the workplace

151

For each of the following nine infection control measures in the workplace, respondents

152

were asked to choose whether or not the measures were being implemented: (1)

153

prohibition/restriction of business trips; (2) prohibition/restriction of visitors; (3)

154

prohibition of holding or limiting the number of people participating in social

155

gatherings and banquets; (4) restriction on face-to-face meetings; (5) requirement to

156

always wear masks during working hours; (6) installation of partitions and change of

157

workplace

158

recommendation to telecommute; and (9) Request not to come to work when sick.

159

Implementation was classified into the five categories of 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-7, and 8-9

160

measures implemented.

161

Assessment of personal infection prevention behavior

162

For each of the following seven personal infection prevention behaviors, respondents

163

were asked to select from among four options (almost always; almost often; not often;

164

or almost never)

165

wearing a mask in the presence of others; (2) disinfecting hands with alcohol before

166

going indoors; (3) washing hands after using the toilet; (4) gargling when returning

167

home; (5) opening windows and doors to ventilate the room; (6) carrying alcohol

168

disinfectant when going out; and (7) disinfecting hands and washing hands after

layout;

touching things that many people have touched. We created a binary variable by

170

defining almost always as having good behavior, and the other responses as not having

171

good behavior.

172
173

Assessment of covariates

174

Covariates included demographics, socioeconomic factors, occupation and number of

175

employees in the workplace. Age was expressed as a continuous variable. Yearly

176

household income was classified into four categories: <2.50 million Japanese yen

177

(JPY); ≥2.50 and <3.75 million JPY; ≥3.75 and <5.00 million JPY; and ≥5.00 million

178

JPY. Education was classified into four categories: junior high school or high school,

179

vocational school, junior college or technical school, and university or graduate school.

180

Marital status was classified into three categories: married; divorce or widowed; or

181

unmarried. In this survey, participants chose 1 occupation from among 10 options:

182

general employee; manager; executive manager; public employee, faculty member, or

183

non-profit organization employee; temporary or contract employee; self-employed;

184

small office

185

occupation (lawyer, tax accountant, medical-related, etc.); and other occupations. Three

186

of these categories were excluded from this study, as mentioned above, so occupation

187

was ultimately classified into seven categories. The number of employees in the

188

workplace was classified into four categories: 5-9, 10-99, 100-999, and ≥1000. In

189

addition, the cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 infection one month prior to the

190

conduct of the survey in the prefecture of residence was used as a community-level

191

variable. Information was collected from the websites of public institutions.

193

The odds ratios (ORs) of having good personal infection prevention behavior associated

194

with infection control measures in the workplace were estimated using a multilevel

195

logistic model nested in the prefectures of residence. An analysis was conducted for

196

each of the seven personal infection prevention behaviors. The multivariate model was

197

adjusted for age and sex, income (by category), educational background (by category),

198

marital status, occupation and number of employees in the workplace (by category). The

199

incidence rate of COVID-19 by prefecture was also used as a prefecture-level variable.

200

A trend test was performed by conducting the same analysis for each of the seven

201

personal infection prevention behaviors in the workplace using the number of infection

202

control measures in the workplace (0-9) as a continuous variable. A p-value less than

203

0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using Stata

204

(Stata Statistical Software release 16; StataCorp LLC, TX, USA).

205

The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of

206

Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan (reference No. R2-079 and R3-006).

207

Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Results

222

Table 1 shows participant characteristics by category of the number of infection control

223

measures in the workplace. Of the 21,915 participants, 7,484 (34%) were in a workplace

224

with eight or nine infection control measures, and 1,313 (6%) were in a workplace with

225

no infection control measures.

226

Table 2 shows the proportion of each good personal infection preventive

227

behavior and the association between category of infection control measures in the

228

workplace and good personal infection preventive behavior. The number of infection

229

control measures in the workplace was associated with wearing a mask in the presence

230

of others (1-2 measures: aOR=2.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.81-2.49, p<0.001;

231

3-4 measures: 3.22 (2.77-3.75), p<0.001; 5-7 measures: 5.21 (4.52-6.01), p<0.001; 8-9

232

measures: 6.75 (5.80-7.86), p<0.001, reference to no measures). A dose-response

relationship was observed in this association (p for trend; p<0.001).

234

The number of infection control measures in the workplace was positively

235

associated with carrying alcohol disinfectant when going out (1-2 measures: 0.90

Discussion

270

In this study, we classified the implementation status of infection control measures in

271

the workplace by the number of implementation items and investigated the relationship

272

of this classification with the implementation of personal infection prevention behavior.

273

Results showed that implementation of infection prevention behavior by individuals

274

significantly increased as the number of infection control measures in the workplace

275

increased. Specifically, it was suggested that infection control measures against

276

COVID-19 in the workplace may affect personal infection prevention behavior.

277

With regard to the significant relationship found between workplace infection

278

control measures and personal infection prevention behavior, it has been reported that

279

workplace-initiated health promotion programs encourage workers to adopt better

280

health behavior.6-8 In a survey of Japanese people, it was reported that “the number of

281

workplace measures taken in response to COVID-19 was positively associated with

282

global fear of COVID-19.”12 In a survey of Ethiopian waiters, it was reported, with

283

regard to good preventive behavior, that knowledge of COVID-19 was not high but risk

284

perception was high.13 On the other hand, in a survey of Chinese occupational fields, it

285

was reported that

286

with all four personal infection prevention behaviors (wearing a face mask consistently

287

in any public space; sanitizing hands every time after returning from public spaces or

288

touching installations; avoiding social and meal gatherings with people who do not live

knowledge about transmission routes of COVID-19 was correlated

289

together; and avoiding crowded places) but the perceived severity of COVID-19 was

290

not associated with consistent face mask wearing or sanitizing hands.11 Considering

291

these previous studies, thorough implementation of infection control measures may

292

increase knowledge and awareness of risks of COVID-19 infection, resulting in the

293

adoption of personal infection prevention behavior. Raising awareness to change the

294

behavior of employees is recommended as a measure of COVID-19 control in the

295

workplace.14,15 Therefore, it is possible that guidance may be provided as part of

296

infection prevention measures for individuals in those workplaces where infection

297

control measures are actively implemented, and this may have had a direct effect on the

298

behavior of individuals.

299

In this survey, the number of infection control measures in the workplace was

300

found to be associated with good personal infection prevention behavior. The same

301

result was also obtained in the above-mentioned survey of Chinese occupational

302

fields.11 However, the association in our present survey varied according to the items of

303

infection prevention behaviors. Compared to the situation in which the number of

304

infection control measures in the workplace was 0, significant differences when the

305

number of infection control measures in the workplace was 1-2 were seen wearing a

306

mask and washing hands after using the toilet. These items were high implementation

307

rates. Further, when there were 3-4 workplace measures, significant differences were

308

additionally seen for alcohol hand disinfection, gargling when returning home, and

309

room ventilation. These findings indicate that personal items that can be implemented

310

relatively easily with a larger overall number of workplace implementations are more

311

susceptible to the effect of the number of workplace infection control measures.

313

be the most effective way to prevent COVID-19.16 However, given the time required to

314

acquire herd immunity in many countries and the impact of variants on vaccine

315

effectiveness, it can be said that a thorough implementation of personal behavior aimed

316

at infection prevention will continue to be an essential measure against pandemic.17 In

317

Japan, even at of the end of March 2020, when the government’s request for cooperation

318

was made, Japanese people in general had changed their behavior, indicating that

319

understanding of the need for each individual to take action against COVID-19 was

320

already widespread, thanks to the influence of mass media and social media.18 The

321

present findings indicate that to encourage people who are not ready to change their

322

behavior, it is important to strengthen infection control measures in the workplace

323

where workers spend many hours of the day. In addition, it is desirable to combine

324

multiple infection control measures, as it has been reported that the pandemic can be

325

delayed by implementing a strategy that combines multiple measures rather than

326

individual measures.19 In such cases, there are levels of difficulty in implementing

327

infection control measures differ among different industries and job types, such as

328

restrictions on telecommuting and interviews, and it is considered more effective to

329

increase the number of measures to be implemented in accordance with the actual

330

circumstances of the workplace. Although there are differences in the likelihood that the

331

effects of workplace infection control measures influence the item of personal infection

332

prevention behavior, it is important that workplace infection control measures are

333

thoroughly implemented.

334

There are two limitations to this study. First, those who did not have Internet

335

access or were not registered as monitors were excluded from the study. However, since

336

subject bias was reduced by random sampling for each region/occupation/prefecture

337

based on the incidence of infections, our results appear to be generalizable within Japan.

338

However, since the survey was conducted in a Japanese population, generalizability to

339

other countries appears limited. It is said that Japanese people characteristically adjust

340

themselves to others easily,20 and that the implementation of infection control measures

341

in the workplace might therefore be strongly related to personal infection prevention

342

behavior. This study appears to support this idea, given that implementation of

343

workplace infection control measures tended to promote personal infection prevention

344

behavior. The findings of this study are likely to be utilized in the future not only for

345

COVID-19 control but also for other infections, including emerging infectious diseases

346

and seasonal influenza.

347

Conclusions

348

We found a positive association between a greater the number of COVID-19 measures

349

implemented in the workplace and higher likelihood of personal infection prevention

350

behavior. This was because knowledge about effective personal infection prevention

351

behavior is increased by implementing infection control measures in the workplace. and

352

increased individual awareness of the risk of infection is linked to personal behavior.

353

This in turn suggests the importance of active promotion of infection control measures

354

in the workplace. These findings may be applicable not only to COVID-19 measures but

355

also to responses to other emerging infections and seasonal influenza.
