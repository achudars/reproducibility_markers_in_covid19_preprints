Abstract

A growing body of evidence shows that poor vitamin D status has been associated with an increased
susceptibility to viral and bacterial respiratory infections. In this study, we aimed to examine the
association between vitamin D and COVID-19 risk and outcomes, and to explore potential causal
effects. We used logistic regression to identify associations between different vitamin D variables
(25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25-OHD), ambient UVB and genetically-predicted 25-OHD
concentrations) and COVID-19 (risk of infection, hospitalisation and death) in 495,780 participants
from UK Biobank. We subsequently performed a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) study to test if
there was any causal effect. In total, 1,746 COVID-19 cases and 399 COVID-19 deaths occurred
between March and June 2020. We found significant inverse associations between COVID-19
infection and 25-OHD in univariable models, but these associations were non-significant after
adjustment for confounders. Ambient UVB was strongly and inversely associated with hospitalization
and death. Although the main MR analysis showed that genetically-predicted vitamin D levels were
not causally associated with COVID-19 risk, MR sensitivity analysis using weighted mode method
indicated a potential causal effect (OR=0.72, 95% CI:0.53-0.98; P=0.041). In conclusion, our study
found suggestive evidence of association between vitamin D and the risk or severity of COVID-19 but
further studies are needed.

Introduction

Vitamin D is known to improve the function of immune cells, including T-cells and macrophages, and
thus plays a critical role in promoting immune responses (1). It has been found to have both antiinflammatory and immune-regulatory properties, which are crucial for the purposeful activation of
the immune system defence mechanism (2). A growing body of evidence shows that poor vitamin D
status might be associated with an increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial respiratory
infections (3, 4).
By analysing publicly available patient data, researchers have discovered a strong correlation
between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 risk (5). It has also been noted that patients from
countries with high COVID-19 mortality rates, such as Italy, Spain and the UK, had lower levels of
vitamin D compared to patients in countries that were not as severely affected such as South Korea
(5). Furthermore, there is evidence that COVID-19 disproportionately affects black and minority
ethnic individuals, with one potential explanation – in addition to other risk factors – being the
higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (6). It is thus hypothesised that having adequate vitamin D
levels may help reduce the risk of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or reduce the risk of severe or
lethal COVID-19 disease.
The main aim of the current study is to perform Mendelian Randomisation (MR) analyses
investigating the effect of genetically-predicted vitamin D levels on COVID-19 risk while taking into
account ambient UVB radiation at the time of the pandemic, and compare these findings with
results obtained from the observational analysis.

Methods

Data sources: Basic demographic information and genotype data on 495,780 participants from UK
Biobank (7), a large prospective study, were linked to COVID-19 test results (for the period
16/03/2020 to 29/06/2020 provided by Public Health England), including the specimen date, origin
(whether the person was an inpatient or not) and result (positive or negative), and death cases
caused by clinical and epidemiological diagnosed COVID-19 from death registry. Conﬁrmed COVID19 cases were deﬁned as UK Biobank participants who had at least one positive test result or died of
COVID-19. Participants who have not been tested for SARS-CoV-2 or did not die from COVID-19 were
taken as controls. Participants who tested negative were excluded from being controls. Total plasma
25-hydroxy-Vitamin D (25-OHD) was measured at the baseline assessment visits between 2006 and
2010 (median: 11 years before COVID-19), using immunoassay (Diasorin). To remove the effect of

sampling season on 25-OHD levels, we generated May-standardised 25-OHD levels (approximating
25-OHD concentration if blood was drawn in May), by applying coefficients generated in a model
restricted to controls and adjusted for age and sex (8). Vitamin D status was further categorised as
deficient (25-OHD<25 nmol/L), insufficient (25-50 nmol/L), or sufficient (>50 nmol/L). A total of 138
genetic variants have recently been reported to be associated with vitamin D from the largest
Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS; n= 443,734) (9). We excluded ambiguous AT and CG
variants (n=4, rs184958517, rs200641845, rs529640451, rs536006581) to avoid bias due to strand
differences between studies, and finally 134 SNPs were selected as genetic instruments for the MR
analysis. A weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) was calculated as a proxy of genetically-predicted 25OHD levels for a life-long exposure by using effect estimates reported by Manousaki et al (9).
Dermal synthesis following exposure to UVB radiation is a major source of vitamin D for humans. We
used ambient UVB radiation to approximate vitamin D status attributable to dermal synthesis (vitDUVB) at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. To do this, we calculated the cumulative and weighted vitDUVB dose form the TEMIS database, version 2.0 (http://www.temis.nl/uvradiation/UVdose.html), as
it has been done previously (10-12). Briefly, we extracted daily UVB dose at wavelengths that induce
vitamin D synthesis at each participant’s residential location over 135 days preceding the date of
diagnosis for cases. Dates were randomly allocated to controls, from the distribution that was
identical to that observed in cases. We weighted the daily UVB contributions before summing them
up because more recent UVB exposure contributes more than exposures from a more distant past,
since vitamin D is being synthesised and used up. More details on the method can be found
elsewhere (10-12).
Additionally, five variants (rs7975232, rs1544410, rs2228570, rs731236 and rs11568820) that are
associated with vitamin D receptor (VDR) function were tested for any effect modification on the
association between vitamin D and COVID-19 risk, considering VDR mediates biological effects of
vitamin D.
Statistical analysis: In the descriptive analysis, mean and Standard Deviation (SD) is given for
continuous variables, and number (N) and proportion for categorical variables, unless indicated
otherwise. Logistic regression modelling was used to estimate the effect of vitamin D variables on
COVID-19 risk (the risk of infection, hospitalisation and death), in unadjusted models and after
adjustment for a range of confounders, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), month of blood
draw, ethnicity (i.e., White, Asian, Black and others), physical activity (number of days for
moderate/vigorous/walked activity), smoking and alcohol status (i.e., current, previous, never,
unknown), sunshine exposure variables (i.e., time spend outdoors in summer, time spent outdoors

in winter and the use of sun/uv protection) and vitamin D supplement intake. Specifically, we
investigated the associations between COVID-19 and: (i) vitamin D levels (circulating 25-OHD
concentration, May-standardised 25-OHD concentration, and categorical vitamin D status); (ii) vitDUVB predicted by an integrative measure of ambient UVB radiation at the time of the pandemic; (iii)
genetically-predicted 25-OHD concentration using wGRS (vitD-wGRS134), in an unadjusted model and
fully adjusted models as described above. We also tested their interactions with VDR SNPs. For MR
analyses, vitamin D SNPs were aligned by their effect alleles; inverse-variance weighted MR
approach (13) was used as the main analysis, and the simple mode, Egger, weighted median and
weighted mode as sensitivity analyses (14) to explore the robustness of the findings in the presence
of potential pleiotropy of the genetic variants. All analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.1.

Results

There was a total of 14,439 COVID-19 tests conducted for 7,898 UK Biobank participants. Of these,
1,596 individuals had at least one positive COVID-19 test and 1,020 of them were hospitalised.
Additional 399 COVID-19 death cases were identified from the death registry. Table 1 presents the
basic demographic characteristics of the cohort. The mean age of the COVID-19 cases (including
deaths) was 68.8y ± 9.2y, and 52.9% were male. Approximately, 86.5% cases were white, 4.8% Asian,
2.8% black, and 5.8% other. The proportion of vitamin D supplement intake in controls (4.2%) was
relatively higher than that in COVID-19 cases (4.0%). Median 25-OHD concentration measured at
recruitment was slightly lower in COVID-19 cases (46.57 (IQR 29.70-60.83) nmol/L) than controls
(46.90 (IQR 32.40-62.40) nmol/L), more so among those who died (44.3 (IQR 29.7-60.42) nmol/L).
The ambient UVB relevant for vitamin D synthesis (vitD-UVB) was also lower in cases 65.95 kJ/m2
(IQR 38.10-99.08 kJ/m2) than in controls 66.14 kJ/m2 (IQR 37.61-100.50 kJ/m2), and it was much
lower for death cases (43.09 kJ/m2 (IQR 31.89-74.10 kJ/m2)). In univariate analysis, vitD-UVB at
recruitment was strongly associated with 25OHD concentrations at recruitment (beta=0.10, p-val <2
10-16, R2=0.12) and also in multivariate model (beta=0.11, p-val <2×10-16, R2=0.19). The variance of

25OHD concentration at recruitment explained by vitD-UVB at recruitment alone was 12.4%, by vitDGRS134 alone was 4.2%, and by vitD-GRS134 and vitD-UVB together with covariates in a multivariate
model was 23.1%.
Results from logistic regression analysis (Table 2) showed significant associations between COVID-19
infection and vitamin D levels (both crude and May-standardised 25OHD concentration) in
univariable models (OR=0.995, 95%CI:0.992-0.997, p-val =2.05×10-5 and OR=0.993, 95%CI:0.9915

0.996, p-val =2.05 × 10-6, respectively); however, these associations were not significant after
adjustment for covariates (OR=1.00, 95%CI:0.99-1.01, =0.573 and OR=1.00, 95%CI:0.99-1.01,
=0.578, respectively). Compared to vitamin D deficient individuals, the risk of infection was 16%
and 31% lower in those who were insufficient or sufficient, respectively, in univariable models, but
not in multivariable models. Neither vitD-UVB nor genetically-predicted (vitD-GRS134) vitamin D were
associated with COVID-19 infection risk. In order to investigate whether vitamin D levels would
influence COVID-19 severity, we performed a sensitivity analysis for hospitalised cases and COVID-19
deaths. We consistently found that vitD-UVB dose was strongly and inversely associated with the
hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in univariable and multivariable models (OR=0.98, 95%CI:
P

P

0.97-0.99, p-val <2×10-16), while null findings were reported for other vitamin D variables (Table 2).
Similar results were observed when we stratified the cohort by BMI (<25 or ≥25) (Table S1).
Moreover, in overweight/obese individuals both vitD-UVB and genetically-predicted levels were
inversely associated with hospitalisation. When stratifying the study sample by ethnicity, we found
that lower vitD-UVB was associated with increased risk of hospitalization and death of COVID-19
cases among White population in both univariable and multivariable models (Table S2). Additionally,
in White population, the risk of hospitalisation was around 40% lower in vitamin D sufficient
individuals than those who were deficient, in both univariable (p-val=0.012) and multivariable (pval=0.024) models. Although numbers were small, vitD-UVB was also significantly associated with
hospitalisations in Asians and with COVID-19 risk in Black population (Table S3-S4). We observed no
evidence of interaction between vitD-GRS134 and VDR SNPs, or between vitD-UVB and VDR SNPs
(Table S5), while evidence of significant interaction was observed between vitD-GRS134 and vitD-UVB
(beta=-0.005, p-val=0.001) for COVID-19 infection risk (Table S6). When stratified by vitD-UVB
tertiles, the beta-coefficient for vitD-wGRS134 changed from 0.179 (p-val=0.16) in Tertile 1, to -0.161
(p-val=0.158) in Tertile 2, and was statistically significant in Tertile 3 (beta=-0.321, p-val=0.004, Table
S7). Table S8 shows the results of the MR analyses using 134 genetic instruments, which are also
graphically presented in Figure 1. The main IVW MR showed that genetically-predicted vitamin D
levels were not causally associated with COVID-19 infection (Table S8) and null results were
obtained in MR sensitivity analyses except for the weighted mode MR, which suggested a potential
causal effect (OR=0.72, 95CI:0.53-0.98; p-val=0.041).

Discussion

In this study, we assessed whether there is an association between vitamin D and COVID-19 risk and
severity by examining a comprehensive set of key vitamin D variables jointly for the first time, and

applying a number of analyses to probe consistency of our findings. We found no strong association
between vitamin D levels (plasma concentration measured at recruitment, 11 years ago) and COVID19 risk or severity after adjustment for confounders, results that are in accordance to the recent
study by Hastie et al (15). However, we consistently found a strong inverse association between an
integrated measure of ambient UVB preceding disease onset (vitD-UVB) and hospitalisation and
death among cases. In this cohort, vitD-UVB explained the largest portion of the variance in 25-OHD:
vitD-UVB alone explained 12.4%, while vitD-GRS134 alone explained 4.2%. Previous studies have
shown that heritability of 25-OHD is high in winter and low in summer, which suggests a varied role
of genetic factors, dependant on the UVB intensity (16). It is therefore not surprising that we found
evidence of an interaction between vitD-UVB and vitamin D genetic risk score, and these findings
highlight the added value of examining genetically-predicted levels and ambient UVB jointly. MR
sensitivity analysis using the weighted mode method indicated a potential causal effect, although
the main MR analysis showed that genetically-predicted vitamin D levels were not causally
associated with COVID-19 risk. As COVID-19 test results (inpatient or outpatient) were only available
from England, we did a sensitivity analysis after excluding participant from Scotland or Wales and
individuals who died before Jan 2020 (since they could not have been infected by SARS-COV-2) from
the controls and the results remained unchanged.
Our study has a number of strengths and limitations. Firstly, UK Biobank is a large prospective study,
with rich information on a range of demographic, lifestyle and health-related risk factors. Vitamin D
plasma measurements were conducted in a single central processing laboratory using the Diasorin
immunoassay, albeit a blood sample was taken over a decade ago and is unlikely to be
representative of participants’ vitamin D status at the time of the pandemic. We have partially
addressed this by using genetic instruments (that are determined by DNA sequence and hence not
variable) to derive genetically-predicted vitD levels. It is important to note that heritability of vitamin
D status is high in winter (70-90%), but levels might be entirely determined by environmental factors
in the summer (16). Therefore, we also included an integrative measure of ambient UVB radiation
during the pandemic. However, the discriminatory power of the UVB variable is somewhat limited in
this study, because UVB radiation is low at this time of the year, particularly at the high northern
latitude of UK. We only used ambient UVB, and did not capture individual behavioural differences
that would determine the actual level of vitamin D synthesis in the skin, such as time and time of day
spent outside, clothing, choosing to walk on the sunny side of the street;. Moreover, time of year is
the strongest predictor of vitD-UVB but control dates were assigned to follow the same distribution
as case dates, which consequently might have led to artificially diminished differences in vitD-UVB
between cases and controls, but analysis relating to hospitalisation and death are not affected by

this. We also conducted an analysis of the genetically-predicted vitamin D and a number of state-ofthe-art MR analyses. However, the main limitation is the lack of power (only 46% power for an effect
estimate (OR) of 1.2 at a p-value level of 0.05) given the small number of COVID-19 patients and the
relatively small percentage of variance (4.2%) explained by vitamin D-related genetic variants. It
should be noted that the number of COVID-19 cases in each model were slightly different due to
missing variables for vitamin D and genotype data in some cases. Another limitation relates to the
fact that not all participants have been tested for present (or past) Covid-19 infection;
consequentially, a number of controls may have in fact been cases, further driving our findings to
the null. It should be acknowledged that the COVID-19 cases in UK biobank have a high rate of
hospitalisation due to the very limited and targeted testing at this stage of the pandemic in the UK,
so this study reflects mainly those with more severe COVID-19 and gives less information about true
infection risk, or risk of milder disease.
In conclusion, we found some suggestive evidence of an association between vitamin D and risk or
severity of COVID-19, which may have implications if a second wave occurs during the autumn or
winter months. Further studies are needed to examine the role of vitamin D in COVID-19.
