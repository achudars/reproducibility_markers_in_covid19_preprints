WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
•

The UK Government introduced “lockdown” measures, including physical or ‘social’
distancing, on 23rd March 2020 due to COVID-19.

•

Government guidance states that people with symptoms of COVID-19 should not
leave their home, also known as self-isolation.

•

There is no research investigating adherence to self-isolation and lockdown measures,
or factors associated with self-isolation or lockdown measures in the UK.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
•

Approximately 10% of participants indicated that they had had symptoms of potential
COVID-19 (cough and high temperature / fever) in the last week. Of these
participants, 75% had left their home in the last 24 hours.

•

Factors associated with non-adherence to self-isolation measures included being male,
less worried about COVID-19, and perceiving a smaller risk of catching COVID-19.
However, these results should be taken with caution as there was no longer evidence
for associations when correcting for multiple analyses.

•

25% of people who reported no symptoms in their household reported having gone out
shopping for items other than groceries, toiletries or medicines in the last week; this
was not allowed by Government guidelines in place at the time of data collection.

•

Factors associated with non-adherence to lockdown measures, and increased number
of outings in the last week, included decreased perceived effectiveness of Government
“lockdown” measures, decreased perceived severity of COVID-19, and decreased
estimates of how many other people were following lockdown rules.

ABSTRACT
Objectives: To investigate factors associated with adherence to self-isolation and lockdown
measures due to COVID-19 in the UK.
Design: Online cross-sectional survey.
Setting: Data were collected between 6th and 7th May 2020.
Participants: 2240 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over. Participants were
recruited from YouGov’s online research panel.
Main outcome measures: Having gone out in the last 24 hours in those who reported
symptoms of COVID-19 in their household. Having gone out shopping for items other than
groceries, toiletries or medicines (non-essentials), and total number of outings, in the last
week in those who reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in their household.
Results: 217 people (9.7%) reported that they or someone in their household had symptoms
of COVID-19 (cough or high temperature / fever) in the last seven days. Of these people,
75.1% had left the home in the last 24 hours (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated
with non-adherence were being male, less worried about COVID-19, and perceiving a
smaller risk of catching COVID-19. Adherence was associated with having received help
from someone outside your household. Results should be taken with caution as there was no
evidence for associations when controlling for multiple analyses. Of people reporting no
symptoms in the household, 24.5% had gone out shopping for non-essentials in the last week
(defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence and with a higher total
number of outings in the last week included decreased perceived effectiveness of
Government “lockdown” measures, decreased perceived severity of COVID-19, and
decreased estimates of how many other people were following lockdown rules. Having
received help was associated with better adherence.
Conclusions: Adherence to self-isolation is poor. As we move into a new phase of contact
tracing and self-isolation, it is essential that adherence is improved. Communications should
aim to increase knowledge about actions to take when symptomatic or if you have been in
contact with a possible COVID-19 case. They should also emphasise the risk of catching and
spreading COVID-19 when out and about and the effectiveness of preventative measures.
Using volunteer networks effectively to support people in isolation may promote adherence.

INTRODUCTION
On 23rd March 2020, the UK Government introduced “lockdown” measures to slow the
spread of COVID-19.(1, 2) These required people to stay at home except for: shopping for
basic necessities (e.g. food or medicine), as infrequently as possible; exercising once a day; a
medical need; or work purposes, but only those who could not work from home.(1) Guidance
stated that while out and about, people should ensure that they were 2 metres apart from
anyone outside their household. The requirements were different for households where
anyone developed a continuous cough or fever. Those with symptoms themselves were
required to stay at home, not leaving the home for any reason, for seven days from the start of
their symptoms (“self-isolation”).(3) Those without symptoms, but who shared a home with
someone who developed symptoms, were required not to leave the home for any reason for
fourteen days from when the index case developed symptoms. Lockdown measures were
extended on 16th April (4) and eased slightly on 11th May 2020 (5, 6), however no changes
have been made to the requirements for people who developed potential symptoms of
COVID-19.
Adherence to these measures is likely to be influenced by multiple factors. There is some
evidence that people who think they have had COVID-19 are less likely to adhere to
lockdown measures.(7) According to Protection Motivation Theory (8) uptake of a protective
behaviour is influenced by your appraisal of a threat, including perceptions about its severity
and your susceptibility to it, and your appraisal of the behaviour, including: perceptions about
its efficacy, your ability to perform the behaviour, and the costs associated with the
behaviour. A recent rapid review of factors affecting adherence to quarantine measures in
previous public health crises found that knowledge of quarantine measures and perceived
social norms were also associated with adherence to quarantine.(9) Conversely, fear of
missing out, perceived social pressure, perceived legal consequences, running out of supplies
(e.g. food or medicine) and financial pressures were associated with decreased adherence.
In this study, we investigated factors associated with adherence to self-isolation and
lockdown measures in a demographically representative sample of the UK adult population.
In households that reported symptoms of COVID-19, we investigated psychological,
situational, personal and clinical factors associated with having left the home in the past 24
hours. In households where no symptoms of COVID-19 were reported, we investigated
psychological, situational, personal and clinical factors associated with adherence to one of

the UK lockdown rules (not going out to shop for items other than groceries, toiletries or
medicines) and with total number of outings in the last seven days.

METHOD
Design
We commissioned the market research company YouGov to carry out this cross-sectional
survey, between 6th and 7th May 2020.

Participants
Participants (n=2240) were recruited from YouGov’s online research panel (n=800,000+ UK
adults) and were eligible for the study if they were aged eighteen years or over and lived in
the UK. Quota sampling was used, based on age, gender, social grade, highest level of
education, and Government Office Region, to ensure that the sample was broadly
representative of the UK general population. Online quota sampling is a standard approach
used in opinion polling and can be a pragmatic approach when a large, demographically
representative sample must be obtained in a very short time frame, particularly during a
crisis.(10-13) While these surveys generally have low response rates, the risk of response bias
is offset by the use of quotas to ensure demographic representativeness. The use of quotas
also means that the ‘response rate’ is not a good indicator of response bias. Potential
participants belonging to quotas that have already been filled are prevented from completing
the survey. Of 2,623 people who began the survey, 2,314 completed it. Seventy-four
participants were not included in the sample due to a lack of data for sociodemographic
variables (meaning that they could not be assigned to a quota), suspiciously speedy
completion of the survey (“speeding”) or providing identical answers to multiple consecutive
questions (“straight-lining”). Participants were reimbursed in points (equivalent to
approximately 50p) which could be redeemed as cash, gift vouchers or charitable donations.

Study materials
Full survey materials are available in the supplementary materials.

Outcome measures
We asked participants to state how many times they had left their home “in the past 24 hours”
and “in the past seven days”: to go to the shops for groceries, toiletries or medicine; to go to
the shops for other items; for exercise; for a medical purpose excluding going to the

shops/pharmacy for medicine; to go to work; to help someone else; and to meet friends or
family who they did not live with.

Psychological and situational factors
We asked participants if they had experienced symptoms “in the past seven days” from a list
of thirteen symptoms including cough and high temperature / fever (for full list see
supplementary materials). We asked participants who lived with someone else if “someone
else in [their] household” had experienced symptoms “in the past fourteen days” from the
same list of thirteen symptoms.
We asked participants whether they thought they had “had, or currently have, coronavirus”.
Possible answers were “I have definitely had it or definitely have it now”, “I have probably
had it or probably have it now”, “I have probably not had it and probably don’t have it now”,
and “I have definitely not had it and definitely don’t have it now”.
We asked if participants were currently self-isolating. Response options were “not selfisolating”, “self-isolating for seven days”, “self-isolating for fourteen days”, and “selfisolating for at least 12 weeks”. Twelve weeks was offered as an option because of UK
guidance asking some extremely clinically vulnerable people to remain at home and ‘shield’
themselves for this length of time. People in this category were alerted to do this via a letter
sent from the National Health Service.
We asked participants a series of true / false statements about UK Government guidance.
Statements referred to households where no-one had symptoms or was extremely clinically
vulnerable and where someone had symptoms of COVID-19 and no-one was extremely
clinically vulnerable (all statements were false under these conditions). See supplementary
materials for full item list.
We asked participants how worried they were about COVID-19 on a five-point Likert-type
scale from “not at all worried” to “extremely worried”.
To measure perceived social norms, we asked participants to estimate the percentage of
people the same age as them who were fully following the UK Government’s
recommendations to stay at home.
We asked participants whether they thought the current lockdown had made their physical
health better or worse. Possible answers were “a lot better”, “a little better”, “no difference”,
“a little worse”, and “a lot worse”.

We asked participants to rate their general health on a five-point Likert-type scale from
“poor” to “excellent” using one item from the SF-36.(14)
We asked participants if they had helped someone, or received help from someone, outside
their household in the past seven days (yes / no).
We asked participants to rate fourteen perception statements on a five-point Likert scale from
“strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”. Statements included the perceived severity of
COVID-19, perceived effectiveness of Government measures, perceived likelihood of
catching and spreading COVID-19, perceived costs of following Government measures, fear
of losing touch with friends and relatives, social pressure from friends and family to follow
Government measures, perceived legal consequences of not following Government measures,
and positive consequences of the lockdown (see supplementary materials for full item list).

Personal and clinical characteristics
We asked participants to report their age, gender, employment status, highest educational or
professional qualification, and their marital status. We also asked participants whether there
was a child in their household, whether they or someone else in their household received a
letter from the National Health Service telling them they were extremely clinically vulnerable
to COVID-19, and whether they lived alone. Participants were asked for their postcode to
determine indices of multiple deprivation (IMD) and whether they lived in an urban or rural
area. We also collected social grade.
We asked participants if their primary home had access to any outdoor space, and whether
they were pet owners.

Ethics
Ethical approval for this study was granted by the King’s College London Research Ethics
Committee (reference: LRS-19/20-18687).

Patient and public involvement
Due to the rapid nature of this research, the public was not involved in the development of the
survey materials.

Power
We calculated achieved power for the analyses (in households with and without symptoms)
using post-hoc power calculations. Achieved power is presented underneath relevant
analyses.

Analysis
Recoding of variables
We created a binary variable indicating whether participants had been out for any reason in
the last 24 hours. Among those who reported symptoms in their household in the last seven
days, we defined those who reported having gone out in the last 24 hours as not adhering to
self-isolation measures.
We calculated the total number of outings made in the last seven days by summing the
number of times people reported going out (shopping for groceries, toiletries or medicine,
shopping for other items, exercising, for a medical purpose, going to work, helping someone
else, meeting friends or family). Some participants (n=54, 2.4%) reported going out many
times and we capped this at twenty times in the past seven days. Based on UK Government
guidelines which were in force at the time of data collection (1) we recoded going to the
shops for items other than groceries, toiletries or medicine, meeting friends or family that did
not live in your household, and having had visitors to your home in the past seven days as not
adhering to UK Government guidelines.
We recoded presence of household symptoms in the last seven days into a binary variable.
Presence of symptoms was defined as a participant reporting that they experienced cough or a
high temperature / fever in the last seven days, or if a member of their household had
experienced cough or a high temperature / fever in the last fourteen days. We recoded
answers of “don’t know” as missing (n=13 own symptoms, n=42 household member
symptoms). Participants were able to skip questions about symptoms, resulting in some
missing data (n=36 own symptoms, n=7 household member symptoms). Where participants
indicated that they themselves had symptoms, but data for household member symptoms was
missing, we recoded these data as symptoms being present in the household.
We recoded whether participants thought they had had, or currently had, COVID-19 into a
binary variable, by grouping answers of “probably” and “definitely” had or have coronavirus,
and “probably not” and “definitely not” had or have coronavirus.

We recoded whether participants were currently self-isolating into a binary variable (not selfisolating, self-isolating for any length of time).
We recoded knowledge of UK Government guidelines into two binary variables, one for if
no-one in the household had symptoms, and one for if someone in the household had
symptoms. Participants who identified all aspects of the guidance correctly were coded as
being correct; those who answered any item incorrectly or did not know were coded as
incorrect/unsure.
For all variables, unless stated otherwise, we coded answers of “don’t know” as missing data.

Analyses
We investigated whether the total number of outings differed by presence of symptoms in the
household by using an independent samples t-test. We investigated whether the percentage of
people reporting going out shopping for items other than groceries, toiletries or medicines
(non-essentials), going out to meet up with friends or family and having visitors to their home
differed by presence of symptoms in the household by using chi-squared tests.
We split the sample by presence of symptoms in the household. We tested factors associated
with non-adherence to self-isolation measures in those who reported symptoms in the
household. We ran a series of logistic regressions investigating univariable associations
between personal and clinical factors, psychological and situational factors and having left
the home in the past 24 hours. We ran a second set of logistic regressions controlling for
personal and clinical characteristics (gender, age, having a child in the household, being
extremely clinically vulnerable, employment status, highest educational or professional
qualification, indices of multiple deprivation, social grade, living in a rural or urban area,
living alone, marital status, and region).
We investigated factors associated with non-adherence to lockdown measures in those who
reported no symptoms in the household. We ran a series of linear regressions investigating
univariable associations between personal and clinical factors, psychological and situational
factors and total number of outings reported in the past seven days (same variables as above).
We ran a second set of linear regressions controlling for personal and clinical characteristics.
For these analyses, we entered personal and clinical characteristics as the first block, and
other independent variables as the second block. We used the total proportion of the variance
explained by individual psychological and situational factors and personal and clinical
characteristics, and statistical significance of individual regression coefficients to determine

the psychological and situational factors most influential in number of outings in the past
week. We ran a series of logistic regressions investigating univariable associations between
personal and clinical factors, psychological and situational factors and going out shopping for
items other than groceries, toiletries or medicines in the past seven days. We ran a second set
of logistic regressions controlling for personal and clinical characteristics (same variables as
above).
Weighting data by age, gender, social grade, highest level of education, and region altered
prevalence of outcome behaviours only slightly (1.1% for having been out in the last 24
hours, and 0.4% for going out shopping for non-essentials; mean difference in number of
outings in past week 0.15). We therefore used unweighted data in our analyses.

Sensitivity analyses
Due to the large number of analyses (n=39) run on each outcome, we applied a Bonferroni
correction to our results (p≤.001). Those meeting this criterion are marked by a double
asterisk (**) in the tables.

RESULTS
A minority of participants (9.7%, n=217) reported that either they or a household member
had a cough or a high temperature / fever in the last seven days. Participant characteristics are
shown in Table 1. Male participants were more likely to report symptoms in their household.
There were no other differences between groups.

Only results of adjusted analyses are reported narratively; unadjusted results are reported in
tables.

Symptoms in household
Of participants who reported symptoms in their household (n=217), 75.1% (n=163, 95% CI
[69.3 to 80.9]) reported leaving the home at least once in the past 24 hours. This finding has
been reported elsewhere.(15)
When we compared participants with symptoms in the household versus those without
symptoms we found no differences in the total number of outings made in the last week
(t(2160)=0.20, p=.84), nor the percentage of people reporting having gone out shopping for
items other than groceries, toiletries or medicines (χ2(1, 2162)=0.38, p=.54), having had a

visitor to their home (χ2(1, 2076)=0.40, p=.53), or having gone out to meet friends or family
they did not live with (χ2(1, 2162)=1.34, p=.25).

Of those who reported symptoms in the household, 34.1% (n=74) reported self-isolating
either for seven days (n=19), fourteen days (n=13), or at least 12 weeks (n=42). However, of
those that described themselves as self-isolating, 60.8% (n=45) nonetheless reported having
gone out in the last 24 hours.
In terms of personal and clinical characteristics, leaving the home in the last 24 hours was
associated with being male (see Table 2).

reported symptoms in their household in the last week and having left the home in the past

Leaving the home in the last 24 hours was associated with: thinking that the current
lockdown had made your mental health worse; having better self-reported general health; and
feeling a greater sense of community with your neighbourhood due to COVID-19 (see Table
3). Not leaving the home in the last 24 hours was associated with: reporting that you were
self-isolating; increased worry about COVID-19; having received help from someone outside
your household in the last seven days because of COVID-19; and increased perceived
likelihood of catching COVID-19.

Power
For analyses where symptoms were present in the household, we achieved 90% power to
detect small effect sizes in logistic regression analyses (OR=1.6,(16) α=.05, sample size
n=217, probability of having left the home = 0.75, one-tailed logistic regression). Using the
same parameters, we achieved 83% power to detect small effect sizes using a two-tailed
logistic regression. This is above the 80% threshold for statistical power considered
acceptable.(17)

No symptoms in household
Of those who reported that no-one in their household was symptomatic, 24.5% reported
having gone out to shop for items other than groceries, toiletries or medicines (n=476, 95%
CI [22.6 to 26.4]), 5.9% reported meeting up with friends and/or family that they did not live
with (n=114, 95% CI [4.8 to 6.9]), and 4.3% reported having had visitors to their home in the
last seven days (n=81, 95% CI [3.4 to 5.3]). The mean number of outings made by
participants was 6.77 (SD=5.07, median=6, mode=0).
Personal and clinical factors (gender, age, having a child in the household, being extremely
clinically vulnerable oneself, employment status, highest level of education or professional
qualification, indices of multiple deprivation, social grade, living in a rural or urban area,
living alone, marital status, and region [results for region not reported]) explained 8.0% of the
variance in number of outings in the past week (see Table 4). More outings were made by
males, those who reported working and those who lived in rural areas. Fewer outings were
made by those who were clinically extremely vulnerable and those living in more deprived
areas. Having a pet in addition to the above personal and clinical factors explained 9.1% of
the variance in number of outings in the past week, with those who had a pet reporting
making more outings in the past week.
Psychological and situational factors associated with more outings in the past week (Table 5)
were: helping someone outside your household; decreased perceived effectiveness of
Government measures to save lives and help protect the NHS; thinking that you would lose
touch with friends and relatives if you followed Government advice; not enjoying spending
more time at home during the lockdown; better self-reported general health; decreased
perceived severity of COVID-19; decreased perceived likelihood of spreading COVID-19;
decreased perceived legal consequences if not following Government advice; decreased
perceived social pressure from friends and family to follow Government measures; knowing
what Government measures were if no-one in the household was symptomatic; believing that
you have had or currently have COVID-19; increased perceived financial cost of following
Government measures; and decreased perceived social norms. Psychological and situational
factors associated with fewer number of outings were receiving help from someone outside
your household; decreased perceived impact of lockdown on physical health; reporting that
you were self-isolating; increased worry about COVID-19; and increased perceived
likelihood of catching COVID-19.

‡Adjusted analyses for this variable did not control for living alone, as by definition all participants asked this

Going out shopping for items other than groceries, toiletries or medicines in the past week
was most strongly associated with thinking you have already had COVID-19 or have it now.
Also associated with going out shopping for non-essentials were helping someone outside
your household, thinking that you will lose touch with your friends or relatives if you follow
Government guidance, and thinking that following Government guidance will negatively
impact you financially (see Table 7). Not going out shopping for non-essentials in the past
week was most strongly associated with having received help from someone outside your
household in the last seven days. Also associated with not going out shopping for nonessentials were reporting that you were self-isolating, increased perceived likelihood of
catching and spreading COVID-19, increased worry about COVID-19, increased perceived
effectiveness of Government advice (saving lives and protecting the NHS), increased
perceived severity of COVID-19 (to oneself and impact on family’s wellbeing), increased
perceived disapproval from friends or family if you do not follow Government advice,
increased perceived legal consequences of not following Government advice (e.g. getting into
trouble with police), not knowing or being unsure about Government measures, and
decreased perceived social norms.

shopping for items other than groceries, toiletries or medicines (non-essentials) in the past

Power
For analyses where no symptoms were present in the household, we achieved 100% power to
detect small effect sizes in logistic regression analyses (OR=1.6, (16) α=.05, sample size
n=1945, probability of having gone out shopping for items other than groceries, toiletries or
medicines = 0.25, one-tailed and two-tailed logistic regression). We achieved 94% power to
detect small effect sizes in linear regression analyses (f2=0.02,(17) α=.05, sample size
n=1945, number of tested predictors = 39, total number of predictors = 39).

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to investigate factors
associated with self-isolation and behaviour during lockdown in the UK. In this sample,
almost 10% of participants reported that either they or a household member had symptoms of
COVID-19 (a cough or high temperature / fever) in the last week. Prevalence estimates by the
UK Office for National Statistics indicate that at the time of data collection, 0.27% of the
community population had COVID-19.(18) Nonetheless, Government regulations require all
those with symptoms, or with symptoms in the household, to self-isolate. Our results suggest
that adherence to this is poor. Three quarters of those with symptoms in their households
reported that they had left their home in the past 24 hours. We also found no difference in
out-of-home behaviour between those who did or did not have symptoms in their households.

The UK will shortly enter a new phase of the pandemic, in which extensive testing, contact
tracing and isolation will be required to keep the spread of COVID-19 in check (19). For this
to succeed, adherence must be improved.
Our findings highlight several risk factors for poor adherence which could be targeted by
public health messaging. Notably males were more likely to report symptoms. They were
also more likely to report having been out in the last 24 hours if they or someone in their
household was symptomatic, having gone out more times in the last week and shopping for
items other than groceries, toiletries or medicines. Lower adherence among men was also
noted in the UK during the 2009/10 H1N1 influenza pandemic.(10) Communication
campaigns that specifically target men may therefore have merit.
Adherence with self-isolation was associated with increased worry about COVID-19 and
increased perceived likelihood of catching COVID-19. As incidence declines, it is possible
that worry will also decline, reducing adherence further. While it may be tempting to use
fear-based messaging to combat this, this may influence other behaviours that the
Government may wish to encourage, such as return to work.(20)
Adherence was also associated with having received help from someone outside your
household in the last seven days. This makes intuitive sense – being able to ask someone else
to run errands should reduce the need for you to leave home. Much has been made recently of
the remarkable altruism of 750,000 people who signed-up to volunteer for the National
Health Service, and the lack of jobs for them to do.(21) Allowing those in self-isolation to
submit requests to this army of willing helpers may be a pragmatic way to improve
adherence. Community volunteer networks, including neighbourhood groups on social media
and “mutual aid” organisations.(22)
The finding that many of those with symptoms in the household believed themselves to be
self-isolating, while also leaving their home, suggests that communication around selfisolation also requires much greater clarity.
Adherence to lockdown measures among those not reporting symptoms in their household
was better, but still not perfect, with 75% reporting not going out to shop for non-essential
items. Adherence to meeting up with friends or family from outside the household and not
having visitors to the home was higher (94% and 95% respectively). Decreased adherence
was associated with being male and working. It is plausible that those who are working may
be more likely to be out and about for work and go to a shop for items other than groceries,

toiletries, or medicines. Those working may also be more financially able to shop for nonessential items. Adherence was associated with factors associated with uptake of health
behaviours, such as higher threat appraisals and positive appraisals of the coping response.
These findings are in line with research from other countries.(23-25) Increased perceived
social norms were also associated with adherence to lockdown measures.(23, 26) Other
factors identified by a recent rapid review of adherence to quarantine,(9) such as lower
perceived social pressure to adhere to measures and decreased perceived legal consequences
of not following measures were also associated with non-adherence to lockdown measures.
While perceiving greater negative financial consequences of Government measures was
associated with non-adherence to lockdown measures, there was no longer evidence for an
association after correcting for multiple adjustments. This is different from research finding
decreased intention to adhere to quarantine measures in Israel.(27) Knowledge of UK
Government guidance where no-one in the household was symptomatic was also associated
with non-adherence to lockdown measures.(9) These findings suggest that improvement in
adherence to lockdown measures is likely to be achieved by emphasising these are actions
that most people are taking, that are having a positive impact, and that others around you
want you to do. They also suggest threatening legal consequences for not engaging in the
activity is less likely to be a strong motivator.
This study has several limitations. First, despite using quota sampling so that personal
characteristics of the sample broadly reflected those in the UK general population, we cannot
be sure that survey respondents are representative of the general population.(28, 29) Research
during disasters and public health crises often require a trade-off between rapidity and
rigour.(11) The use of a professional market research agency using industry standard opinion
polling methodology provides a suitable balance in these circumstances. Second, all data
were self-reported and may have been susceptible to social desirability bias.(30) However,
preliminary data indicate that self-reported physical distancing is associated with real-world
behaviour.(31) If anything, the rates of adherence we observed may be over-estimates of
adherence. Third, we did not ask participants if they came into close contact (within 2 metres)
with anyone from another household while they were out and about. We cannot tell if those
who went out more, including shopping for non-essentials, were in close contact with more
people than those who went out less or who did not go out shopping for non-essentials.
However, we reason that those who have been out and about more times have a greater
chance of having come into close contact with someone from outside their household. This is

only relevant for those who reported no symptoms in their household. For those who reported
symptoms in their household, any outing is a breach of guidance. Fourth, we used a
cumulative measure of ‘outings’ for our outcome measure. It is possible that participants who
went to a supermarket for groceries or toiletries may also have bought other non-essential
items, and reported this as one outing to buy groceries, toiletries, or medicines, and one
outing to buy other items. Thus, in our calculations, a single trip could have counted as two
outings. Our variable indicating the number of outings made in the past week, and the
number of outings made for non-essential items specifically may therefore be over-estimates.
Fifth, the cross-sectional nature of data collection means we are unable to draw causal
inferences. Sixth, although the total sample size was large, a small percentage of the
population reported that they or someone in their household had experienced symptoms of
COVID-19 in the last week. Therefore, the sample size for analyses investigating associations
with self-isolation was small, resulting in decreased power and wide confidence intervals.
Despite all analyses achieving over 83% power, these results should be taken with caution.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating factors associated with
adherence to self-isolation and lockdown measures in the UK. Data suggest that self-reported
adherence to self-isolation measures was poor. This has important implications for policies
that attempt to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through self-isolation, such as contact
tracing, and will become more prominent when restrictions on movement are eased further.
Psychological factors including perceived effectiveness of lockdown measures, should be
emphasised in communications. Effective use of volunteer programmes and help within the
neighbourhood or community may also improve adherence to self-isolation and lockdown
measures.
