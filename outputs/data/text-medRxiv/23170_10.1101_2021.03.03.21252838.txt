Abstract

26

Background

27

High frequency, rapid turnaround SARS-CoV-2 testing continues to be proposed as a way of

28

efficiently identifying and mitigating transmission in congregate settings. However, two SARS-

29

CoV-2 outbreaks occurred among intercollegiate university athletic programs during the fall

30

2020 semester despite mandatory directly observed daily antigen testing.

31

Methods

32

During the fall 2020 semester, athletes and staff in both programs were tested daily using

33

Quidel’s Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA), with positive antigen results

34

requiring confirmatory testing with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction

35

(RT-PCR). We used genomic sequencing to investigate transmission dynamics in these two

36

outbreaks.

37

Results

38

In Outbreak 1, 32 confirmed cases occurred within a university athletics program after the index

39

patient attended a meeting while infectious despite a negative antigen test on the day of the

40

meeting. Among isolates sequenced from Outbreak 1, 24 (92%) of 26 were closely related,

41

suggesting sustained transmission following an initial introduction event. In Outbreak 2, 12

42

confirmed cases occurred among athletes from two university programs that faced each other in

43

an athletic competition despite receiving negative antigen test results on the day of the

44

competition. Sequences from both teams were closely related and unique from strains

45

circulating in the community, suggesting transmission during intercollegiate competition.

46

Conclusions

47

These findings suggest that antigen testing alone, even when mandated and directly observed,

48

may not be sufficient as an intervention to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in congregate

49

settings, and highlights the importance of supplementing serial antigen testing with appropriate

50

mitigation strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in congregate settings.

51

Introduction

52

Timely reporting of SARS-CoV-2 test results is critical for controlling transmission through

53

prompt public health action, yet at times during 2020, turnaround times for SARS-CoV-2 test

54

results in the United States have averaged 4 days, with some individuals waiting 10 days or

55

more [1]. While turnaround times in early 2021 have improved, the lag between specimen

56

collection and receipt of a test result continues to represent a window in which the risk of viral

57

spread from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals is high. Rapid antigen tests, like Abbott’s

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.03.21252838; this version posted March 6, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

58

BinaxNow COVID-19 Ag Card and Quidel’s Sofia SARS Antigen FIA, can reduce this lag

59

between testing and results reporting [2–5]. Because of these qualities, high-frequency, rapid

60

turnaround SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing has been proposed as a prevention strategy in many

61

congregate settings where SARS-CoV-2 infection risk is elevated [6–8].

62
63

In data submitted for emergency use authorization, the Sofia SARS Antigen FIA antigen test

64

reported a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 100% when used for symptomatic patients within

65

five days of symptom onset [9,10]. It therefore follows that serial antigen testing could rapidly

66

identify persons with symptomatic infections enabling rapid isolation of such individuals [2,4].

67

Recent studies, however, have found that Sofia SARS Antigen FIA antigen was less sensitive

68

(41.2% sensitivity) when individuals were asymptomatic [10–13]. Use of Sofia SARS Antigen

69

FIA on asymptomatic patients is not included in the FDA authorization and is considered an “off-

70

label” use of the test. Nonetheless, many universities and other congregate settings have used

71

the tests for asymptomatic screening. The potential for false-negative antigen results among

72

asymptomatic patients may present a significant risk in that a negative test could result in risk

73

disinhibition behavior in a patient who may be infectious during their pre-symptomatic period,

74

which could lead to sustained and increased viral spread[14] (Figure 1).

75

Methods

76

A university implemented daily SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing for college

77

athletics

78

The two outbreaks occurred among athletes and staff affiliated with a university’s intercollegiate

79

athletics programs despite daily SARS-CoV-2 testing with Quidel’s Sofia SARS Antigen FIA.

80

Both sports involved in the outbreaks were considered “high-risk” by the national collegiate

81

athletics association (NCAA) due to frequent contact and collision between athletes during play.

82

Students and staff affiliated with the two athletics programs began daily antigen testing for

83

SARS-CoV-2 in September 2020. Daily antigen testing was not required for persons with a RT-

84

PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past 3 months, and persons experiencing

85

symptoms consistent with COVID-19, as symptomatic persons received RT-PCR testing without

86

initial antigen testing. For remaining asymptomatic students and staff, antigen testing was

87

conducted using anterior nasal swabs that were self-collected each morning under the direct

88

supervision of a nurse. Antigen test results were provided to athletics department medical staff

89

who coordinated exclusion from team activities and confirmatory testing, but were not reported

90

back to students and staff.

91
92

A negative antigen result meant an individual could engage in all sport-related activities, like

93

indoor meetings, practices, scrimmages, and intercollegiate competitions. Athletes and staff with

94

positive antigen results were immediately excluded from team activities by department medical

95

staff and subject to confirmatory testing with RT-PCR using the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit

96

(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Students and staff with positive RT-PCR results were excluded from

97

team activities for 21 days and were interviewed by university staff to identify close contacts.

98

Close contacts of RT-PCR-confirmed students or staff were required to self-quarantine for 14

99

days from the date of last contact per public health guidance [17]. Importantly, contact tracing

100

for student athletes did not include contacts that occurred during practices, competitions,

101

meetings, or other team activities, but could include contacts that occurred during social

102

activities or at home (e.g., roommates). In addition to daily antigen testing, the athletic

103

programs implemented a physical distancing policy requiring all students and staff to be at least

104

six feet apart during meetings, and mandatory mask use during team activities.

105

Epidemiological investigation

106

Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were defined as students or staff affiliated with the two athletics

107

programs who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result during the outbreak period.

108

False negative antigen results were defined as a negative antigen test result and a positive RT-

109

PCR result that were collected on the same day. During each outbreak, once the number of

110

confirmed cases reached the threshold established by intercollegiate athletics conference

111

protocols, in-person team activities were suspended, and all students and staff were tested with

112

RT-PCR. Specimens that tested positive by RT-PCR confirmation were used for sequencing

113

analysis.

114

The names of universities, the specific sports, and relevant dates have been removed from the

115

report to protect the privacy of the students and staff involved. We used identifiers (Athletics-##)

116

to denote individuals associated with these outbreaks. Dates are encoded as X-day-YY, ‘X’

117

indicates the outbreak investigated, and ‘YY’ indicates the day of that outbreak. The first notable

118

event for each outbreak is "day 0" – in Outbreak 1, this was a negative antigen test for the index

119

case (who later tested positive by RT-PCR), and in Outbreak 2, this was the date of the first

120

competition between the two teams. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted in a

121

manner consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy1.

122

Laboratory Methods

123

We obtained a waiver of HIPAA Authorization and were approved to obtain the clinical samples

124

along with a Limited Data Set by the Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB #1-1290953-1).

125

Sequences for this study were derived from 36 total nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples

126

collected from Outbreak 1 (n=32) and Outbreak 2 hosting team (n=5), as well as the visiting

127

team’s samples in Outbreak 2 (n=5).

Outbreak 1 viral RNA isolation

129

Nasal swabs were collected and placed in 3mL phosphate buffered saline. RNA was extracted

130

from 190 uL of sample using the MagMAX™ Viral/Pathogen II (MVP II) Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit

131

(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and eluted in a volume of 50 µL according to

132

manufacturer’s instructions. 5µL of RNA was quantitated using a one-step RT-PCR using a

133

TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

134

Outbreak 2 viral RNA isolation

135

Nasopharyngeal swabs were received in 3mL of transport medium (VTM). Viral RNA (vRNA)

136

was extracted from 100

137

Madison, WI, USA) on a Maxwell RSC 48 instrument, using manufacturer guidelines, and was

138

eluted in 50 μL of nuclease free H2O.

139

Complementary DNA (cDNA) generation

140

Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using a modified ARTIC Network approach[15].

141

Briefly, vRNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen,

142

Carlsbad, CA, USA) using random hexamers and dNTPs, according to manufacturer's

143

guidelines.

144

Multiplex PCR to generate SARS-CoV-2 genomes

145

SARS-CoV-2-specific multiplex PCR for nanopore sequencing was performed, similar to

146

amplicon-based approaches as previously described[15,16]. In short, primers for 96 overlapping

147

amplicons spanning the entire genome with amplicon lengths of 500 bp and overlapping by 75

148

to 100 bp between the different amplicons were used to generate cDNA. cDNA (2.5

μl of VTM using the Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification kit (Promega,

μL) was

149

amplified in two multiplexed PCR reactions. Following amplification, samples were pooled

150

together before ONT library preparation.

151

Library preparation and sequencing

152

A total of 5ng for each sample was made compatible for deep sequencing using the one-pot

153

native ligation protocol with Oxford Nanopore kit SQK-LSK109 and its Native Barcodes (EXP-

154

NBD104 and EXP-NBD114)[15]. Up to 24 samples were pooled prior to being run on the

155

appropriate flow cell (FLO-MIN106) using the 72hr run script.

156

Processing raw ONT data

157

Sequencing data was processed using the ARTIC bioinformatics pipeline

158

(https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019)[17]. Consensus sequences were assembled

159

for samples with greater than 400x coverage. Samples were excluded from analysis if gaps in

160

the consensus sequence totaled ≥20% of the genome. The entire ONT analysis pipeline is

161

available at https://github.com/gagekmoreno/SARS-CoV-2-in-Southern-Wisconsin.

162

Phylogenetic analysis

163

Phylogenetic analysis was completed using tools implemented in Nextstrain custom builds

164

(https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov)[18,19]. Time-resolved and divergence phylogenetic trees

165

were built using the standard Nextstrain tools and scripts[18,19]. We used custom python

166

scripts to filter and clean metadata. Sequences names were coded as OB#-T#-A#. Where OB

167

signifies the outbreak, T represents the team that the sequence came from, and A is the athlete

168

from which the sample that the sequence was derived originated.

Data availability

170

Source data after mapping to SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (Genbank: MN908947.3) have

171

been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under bioproject PRJNA614504.

Results

173

Outbreak 1: Cases can be linked to a single viral introduction

174

An athlete (Athletics-1) received a negative antigen test result the morning of day-0. Later that

175

day, Athletics-1 attended an indoor meeting with approximately 10 other student-athletes and

176

staff in which attendees reportedly sat six feet apart and wore masks at all times. The following

177

morning (day-1), Athletics-1 received a positive antigen test result followed by RT-PCR swab for

178

confirmation. The confirmatory RT-PCR result was positive with a Ct of 15.9 and the athlete

179

began experiencing symptoms by mid-afternoon of day-1. During day-3 through day-7, four

180

attendees of the initial day-0 meeting developed symptoms and received subsequent positive

181

RT-PCR results. Additionally, three roommates of Athletics-1 who did not attend the meeting

182

developed symptoms on day-4 and received positive RT-PCR results on day-4 and day-5. In-

183

person team activities were suspended on day-8 to prevent additional transmission.

184

Program-wide RT-PCR and antigen testing was conducted seven times throughout the outbreak

185

period (day-7, 10, 13-17, and 20). Mass RT-PCR testing identified 21 new SARS-CoV-2

186

infections among students and staff. Of these, 18 (86%) were negative on contemporaneous

187

rapid antigen tests. Among 11 positive antigen results obtained during mass testing, 4 (36%)

188

were confirmed with RT-PCR and 7 (64%) received negative RT-PCR results.

189

Overall, during Outbreak 1, 32 individuals (22 students and 10 staff) from the program had

190

laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (Figure 2a). Of confirmed cases, 4 (13%) were

191

tested with RT-PCR because they were symptomatic, 7 (22%) were antigen-positive and

192

received RT-PCR confirmation, and 21 (66%) were positive during mass RT-PCR testing.

193

Contact tracing interviews found that 13 (40%) of 32 confirmed cases attended a team meeting

194

where someone with confirmed COVID-19 was present and in their infectious period; 6 (13%)

195

had close contact with a roommate with COVID-19; and 8 (25%) did not have any documented

196

exposures (Table 1).

197

To investigate the relationship among SARS-CoV-2 cases in outbreak 1, we generated

198

consensus sequences for 26 (81%) of 32 RT-PCR positive samples using the ARTIC Network

199

tiled amplicon approach on an Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION [15,16]. Samples from

200

the remaining six RT-PCR test-positive individuals in Outbreak 1 were not available at the time

201

of sequencing and were excluded from this analysis. We found that 24 (92%) of these 26

202

genomic sequences cluster tightly in the Nextstrain 20A clade on a time-resolved tree and are

203

separated by 0-2 fixed consensus nucleotide differences (Figure 3). The limited diversity of

204

viruses detected in the 24 individuals suggests sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 following

205

a single introduction [20–22].Viruses from Athletics-3 and Athletics-26 did not appear to be part

206

of the primary transmission cluster. As of 1-day-40, there was no evidence for onward spread

207

within the program originating from Athletics-3 or Athletics-26. The viruses infecting these

208

individuals cluster more closely with sequences seen in the community.

209

Outbreak 2: SARS-CoV-2 transmission during intercollegiate competition

210

Two teams from different universities engaged in intercollegiate competitions on consecutive

211

days (day-0 and day-1). Both teams underwent daily antigen testing and received all negative

212

antigen results in the week preceding the competitions, including both competition days (day-0

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.03.21252838; this version posted March 6, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

213

and day-1). No testing was conducted on day-2. On day-3, an athlete from Team 2 received a

214

positive antigen test result, which was confirmed by RT-PCR. No athletes or staff on either team

215

were quarantined from contact with the index athlete that occurred during competition on day-0

216

and day-1. During day-5 through day-10, multiple athletes on both teams developed symptoms

217

and received positive antigen and RT-PCR results. On day-6, all athletes on Team 1 were

218

tested by RT-PCR and in-person team activities were suspended. Overall, 12 athletes (seven

219

from Team 1 and five from Team 2) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections during this outbreak

220

(Figure 4).

221

To determine whether the source of these infections could be linked to competition despite

222

negative antigen results on the day of competition, we generated eight consensus sequences

223

from ten available samples. All eight virus sequences (four from each team) clustered tightly in

224

the 20G clade on a time-resolved tree and were separated by 0-2 fixed consensus nucleotide

225

differences (Figure 4). Given the known epidemiological associations between these teams,

226

this likely represented a single transmission cluster [20–22].

227

The genetic sequences of the viruses infecting the individuals in Outbreak 2 were distinct from

228

the viruses circulating within the community where Outbreak 2 occurred. Moreover, sampling of

229

individuals in Outbreak 2 revealed a unique mutation, encoding Spike P26Y, that was present in

230

viral sequences from the samples from both teams but was not otherwise seen in the larger

231

community where Team 1 was located. Given the depth of surveillance community sequencing

232

in Team 1’s community available during the outbreak period (~4.7% of test-positive cases), it is

233

unlikely that this unique signature arose independently in the community where Team 1 is

234

located.

235

Discussion

236

The SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy of daily, directly observed, rapid antigen testing implemented

237

by intercollegiate athletics programs nationwide has been resource-intensive, yet its impact on

238

SARS-CoV-2 transmission in this setting has not been evaluated. In this report, we described

239

two outbreaks within intercollegiate athletics programs in which daily antigen testing was unable

240

to interrupt SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In Outbreak 1, the index athlete received a positive RT-

241

PCR results with a low Ct value less than 24 hours after testing negative by the Sofia SARS

242

Antigen FIA. This individual was likely infectious on the date of the negative antigen test, as four

243

other individuals in the day-0 meeting contracted SARS-CoV-2 over the ensuing week.

244

Sustained transmission within the program followed when additional exposures from

245

presymptomatic and undetected SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred – at least 13 of the 32

246

outbreak-associated cases attended team meetings with individuals who had received negative

247

antigen results yet were in their infectious period.

248

Transmission within the program was not interrupted until the program implemented serial RT-

249

PCR testing, a strategy that led to identification of 21 new confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections,

250

18 of which were negative on contemporaneous antigen tests. Our findings suggest that serial

251

antigen testing as a control strategy may have limited sensitivity for detecting early

252

asymptomatic infections, and that prevention of future outbreaks in these settings may require a

253

combination of more sensitive molecular tests (e.g., RT-PCR) and improved mitigation

254

measures.

255

Contact tracing during Outbreak 1 identified interactions between individuals that may have

256

contributed to at least 21 (66%) of the 32 confirmed cases (Figure 2b). These interactions

257

represent multiple breaches of the university’s mitigation strategy and combined with the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.03.21252838; this version posted March 6, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

258

limitations of the antigen testing protocol, resulted in sustained person-to-person viral spread

259

throughout the team. In particular, the team continued to have physically distanced (6 feet apart)

260

in-person meetings with cloth masks until all in-person team activities were suspended to

261

prevent further spread. Per public health and university guidelines, attendees in these meetings

262

were not quarantined, a step that may have prevented onward transmission during this

263

outbreak. Roommates and household contacts of student-athletes could represent additional

264

sources of infection in Outbreak 1. In some cases, housemates of infected team members were

265

not required to quarantine due to the large size of the house and the university's assessment

266

that physical distancing was achievable in this area. Continuing indoor in-person meetings and

267

not quarantining potential contacts represent possible breaches in university’s SARS-CoV-2

268

mitigation plan that, combined with the limitation of antigen testing, permitted viral spread

269

throughout the team in Outbreak 1.

270

In Outbreak 2, we used genomic sequencing to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 transmission

271

likely occurred between two teams during athletic competition despite both teams receiving

272

negative antigen results prior to competition. Supporting evidence for inter-collegiate

273

transmission included detection of a unique mutation, Spike P26Y, that was common to the

274

samples from both teams but not otherwise seen in the community where Team 1 is located.

275

Given these findings, the most parsimonious explanation is that an infection acquired in the

276

community by the index athlete on Team 2 was transmitted to other individuals on both teams

during the time of competition.

278

The potential for inter-collegiate transmission during an athletic competition has important

279

implications for SARS-CoV-2 serial testing strategies and in-competition mitigation protocols.

280

First, antigen testing on the competition dates failed to identify the index case, who may have

281

been infectious and exposed other athletes. Like Outbreak 1, more sensitive molecular tests

282

may have identified the source case and allowed for exclusion from the competition. Second,

283

this investigation shows that athletic competition may pose a risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission,

284

particularly in sports where direct physical contact occurs. This outbreak occurred during an

285

athletic competition that included contact and collision, and is considered “high-risk” by NCAA.

286

Despite the short duration of contact between athletes , transmission risk can be exacerbated

287

by heavy breathing and shouting without masking, which regularly occurs in this sport and has

288

been associated with SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in other athletics competitions [30].

289

The findings in this report are subject to several limitations. First, we were not able to perform

290

genomic sequencing on all positive samples from these outbreaks (34 of 44 samples were

291

sequenced) either because of high Ct values on RT-PCR or lack of sample availability. Second,

292

contemporaneous antigen and RT-PCR samples in Outbreak 1 were not collected as “paired”

293

swabs (simultaneous swabbing of two nares) and may not be comparable to other antigen test

294

evaluations. Similarly, the performance of antigen tests in this context of daily serial testing

295

measured their ability to identify early presymptomatic infections, and may not be generalizable

296

to antigen test performance in other settings. Third, our ability to determine the source of

297

infections in these outbreaks was limited by incomplete contact tracing data. Undocumented

298

exposures between athletes and staff may have occurred outside of organized team activities

299

that could have caused infections that were attributed to team meetings or in-competition

300

transmission; although the strength of genomic clustering and epidemiologic evidence from

301

these investigations suggests that such occurrences were rare.

302

Among athletics programs and other congregate settings where outbreaks may spread rapidly

303

after introduction of SARS-CoV-2, serial antigen testing alone may not be sufficient to prevent

304

outbreaks. A robust testing strategy should be supplemented with multilayered prevention

305

strategies that includes correct and consistent mask use, physical distancing, increased hand

306

hygiene and disinfection, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, and isolation of

307

symptomatic individuals regardless of antigen test result[13,23–25]. Serial testing with RT-PCR

308

may identify additional cases that were not detected by antigen testing, but the increased

309

sensitivity would have to be balanced with laboratory resources and increased turnaround

310

times.
