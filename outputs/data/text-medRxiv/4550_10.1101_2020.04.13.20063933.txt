ABSTRACT
Background
More than half of the global population is under strict forms of social distancing. Estimating the
expected impact of lockdown and exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the
management of the COVID-19 health crisis.
Methods
We use a stochastic age-structured transmission model integrating data on age profile and social
contacts in √éle-de-France to (i) assess the epidemic in the region, (ii) evaluate the impact of lockdown,
and (iii) propose possible exit strategies and estimate their effectiveness. The model is calibrated to
hospital admission data before lockdown. Interventions are modeled by reconstructing the associated
changes in the contact matrices and informed by mobility reductions during lockdown evaluated from
mobile phone data. Different types and durations of social distancing are simulated, including
progressive and targeted strategies, with large-scale testing.
Results
We estimate the reproductive number at 3.18 [3.09, 3.24] (95% confidence interval) prior to lockdown
and at 0.68 [0.66, 0.69] during lockdown, thanks to an 81% reduction of the average number of
contacts. Model predictions capture the disease dynamics during lockdown, showing the epidemic
curve reaching ICU system capacity, largely strengthened during the emergency, and slowly
decreasing. Results suggest that physical contacts outside households were largely avoided during
lockdown. Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy would lead to a second wave overwhelming the
healthcare system, if conditions return to normal. Extensive case-finding and isolation are required for
social distancing strategies to gradually relax lockdown constraints.
Conclusions
As France experiences the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in lockdown, intensive forms of social
distancing are required in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity.
Extensive case-finding and isolation would allow the partial release of the socio-economic pressure
caused by extreme measures, while avoiding healthcare demand exceeding capacity. Response
planning needs to urgently prioritize the logistics and capacity for these interventions.

INTRODUCTION
More than half of the global population is under strict forms of social distancing1,2, with more than 90
countries in lockdown to fight against COVID-19 pandemic. France implemented the lockdown from
March 17 to May 11, 20203. The aim of this measure is to drastically increase the so-called social
distance between individuals to break the chains of transmission and reduce COVID-19 spread. It is
an unprecedented measure that was previously implemented only in Italy, Spain, Austria2, following
the example of China4, to curb the dramatic increase of hospitalizations and admissions to ICU
approaching saturation of the healthcare system.
The implementation of extreme measures of social distancing, including mobility restrictions, banning
of mass gatherings, closure of schools and work activities, isolation and quarantine, helped control the
first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in China4‚Äì8. Such exceptional coverage and intensive degree of
intervention coupled with strict enforcement may be key to the resulting outcome. How this will play
out in Europe is still uncertain11,12. Most importantly, how to relax such stringent constraints on social
life and economy while controlling the health crisis remains under investigation11‚Äì13.
Here we use an age-structured mathematical model to (i) assess the current COVID-19 pandemic
situation in France, (ii) evaluate the impact of the lockdown implemented nationwide on March 17,
2020, and (iii) estimate the effectiveness of possible exit strategies. The model is applied to the region
of √éle-de-France (heavily affected by the epidemic), it is data-driven and calibrated on hospital
admission data for the region prior to lockdown. Different types and durations of social distancing
interventions are explored, including a progressive lifting of the lockdown targeted on specific classes
of individuals (e.g. allowing a larger portion of the population to go to work, while protecting the
elderly), and large-scale testing for case-finding and isolation. The aim is to identify possible strategies
to reduce the public health impact following the lifting of the lockdown.
The original version of this study was performed and made available as a preprint in mid-April, one
month before the exit from lockdown. This revised version updates the comparison and validation of
model projections, once data became available, while maintaining the context of the beginning of
lockdown.
METHODS
We consider a stochastic discrete age-structured epidemic model based on demographic and age
profile data14 of the region of √éle-de-France (Figure 1).
Mixing. Four age classes are considered: [0,11), [11,19), [19,65), and 65+ years old, called in the
following younger children (ùë¶ùëê), adolescents or teenagers (ùë°), adults (ùëé), and seniors (ùë†), respectively.
We use social contact matrices measured in France in 2012 through a social contact survey17. The
matrices represent the mixing in the baseline scenario (no interventions) between individuals in these
four age groups (Figure 1), depending on the type of activity and place where the contacts occur
(household, school, workplace, transport, leisure, other). Intervention measures are modeled through
modifications of the contact matrices (see below).

Compartmental model and transmission. Transmission dynamics follows a compartmental scheme
specific for COVID-19 (Figure 2), where individuals are divided into susceptible, exposed, infectious,
hospitalized, in ICU, recovered, and deceased. The infectious phase is divided into two steps: a
prodromic phase (ùêº! ) occurring before the end of the incubation period, followed by a phase where
individuals may remain either asymptomatic (ùêº" ) or develop symptoms. In the latter case, we
distinguish between different degrees of severity of symptoms, ranging from paucisymptomatic (ùêº!# ), to
infectious individuals with mild (ùêº$# ) or severe (ùêº## ) symptoms, according to data from Italian COVID19 epidemic18 and estimates from individual-case data from China and other countries19. We explore
two values of the probability of being asymptomatic, namely ùëù" = 20% and 50%, in line with available
estimates20‚Äì22. Individuals in the prodromic phase, asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic individuals
have a smaller transmission rate with respect to individuals with moderate or severe symptoms, as
reported by contact tracing investigations23 and estimated in Ref.8. Current evidence from household
studies, contact tracing investigations, and modeling works suggest that children are as likely to be
infected by COVID-19 as adults, but more likely to become either asymptomatic or
paucisymptomatic22,24‚Äì26. This may explain the very small percentage (<5%) of children in COVID-19
confirmed cases worldwide27. Here we assume that children in both classes (younger children and
adolescents) are equally susceptible as adults, following Ref.24, and that they become either
asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic only. Different relative susceptibility or infectivity of children
compared to adults are tested for sensitivity analysis.

The compartmental model includes hospitalization and admission to ICU for severe cases. ICU
admission rates, hospital case fatality, lengths of stay after admission are informed from French
hospital data for patient trajectories in √éle-de-France region (SIVIC database maintained by the
Agence du Num√©rique en Sant√© and Sant√© Publique France28,29 ) (see also Additional file 1). ICU beds
occupation is the indicator used to evaluate the capacity of the region to face the surge of patients
requiring intensive care. Since we do not use hospital beds occupation for this evaluation, we neglect
the time spent in the hospital after exiting intensive care.
Parameters, values, and sources used to define the compartmental model are listed in Table S1 of the
Additional file 18,18,19,21,28,30‚Äì35.

admitted to ICU, H=severe case admitted to the hospital but not in intensive care, R=Recovered, D=Deceased.

Change of behavior due to severe illness. We assume that infectious individuals with severe
symptoms reduce of 75% their number of contacts because of the illness they experience, as observed
during 2009 H1N1 pandemic36. Higher reductions are tested as possible interventions of self-isolation
(see below).
Social distancing interventions. We implement social distancing interventions by reconstructing the
associated changes of the contact matrices, accounting for a reduction of the number of contacts
engaged in specific settings. More precisely:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

School closure: the contact matrix for school is removed. We consider that 5% of adults may
stay at home to take care of children while schools are closed (not applied with telework or
lockdown).
Telework performed by a given % of individuals: contacts at work and on transports are
reduced to account for the % of workers not going to work anymore. In France telework is
performed daily by 6% of the active adult population37. Here we consider three values: 25%,
50% (as declared by participants of a crowdsourced system monitoring COVID-19 associated
behaviors in France38), and 70%. The 70% reduction is considered during lockdown, informed
by the reduction of mobility documented during the first weeks of lockdown, and resulting from
the analysis of mobile phone data in the region39. The percentages associated to telework
more generally include all individuals not going to their place of work (because they work

remotely, they stopped working due to restrictions, or other conditions). Household contacts
are increased proportionally to each adult staying at home based on statistics comparing
weekend vs. weekday contacts17 and proportion of adults working during the weekend40.
Senior isolation: contacts established by seniors are reduced by a given % to model a marked
social distancing targeting only the age class at higher risk of complications. We consider 75%
and 90%.
Banning of social events and closure of all non-essential activities: Contacts established
during leisure and other activities are completely or partially (50%) removed.
Case isolation: in a scenario with large-scale and rapid testing availability, we consider that
25%, 50% or 75% of all infectious individuals (also including asymptomatic) reduce promptly
their contacts by 90% throughout their illness as they self-isolate. This simulates the outcome
of aggressive contact-tracing and isolation31,41. To account for a delay in tracing, testing and
self-isolation, we consider that infected individuals in their prodromic stage maintain their
contacts as in the no intervention scenario.

Combinations of the above social distancing interventions simulate the lockdown and alternative less
strict options as exit strategies (Table 1). Physical contacts during lockdown are removed to account
for the adoption of physical distancing; an alternative version of the matrix maintaining physical
contacts during lockdown is tested for sensitivity. We explore possible progressive exit of specific
categories of individuals from lockdown (e.g. gradually reopening some businesses while still requiring
a high rate of telework where possible), while maintaining strict social distancing for those at higher
risk of complications (e.g. protecting seniors through isolation), as well as increasing testing capacities
over time. Results without physical contacts in the exit strategies are tested for sensitivity analysis.
Intervention scenarios are based on the nationwide implementation of the lockdown in France from
March 17, 2020 up to May 11. Timelines of explored scenarios are illustrated in Figure 3. Different
durations of the lockdown (till the end of April, end of May) are also considered for sensitivity.
Calibration and validation. The model is calibrated on hospital data28 specifying the number of
COVID-19 positive hospital admissions in √éle-de-France prior to lockdown. We use a maximum
likelihood approach to fit the transmission rate per contact and the starting date of the simulation
considering data in the interval March 1-23, 2020 (Additional file 1). Hospital admissions in the interval
March 17-23 were included as still not affected by lockdown, due to the delay between date of
infection and date of hospitalization (~1 week). Parameters estimating the hospital trajectories of
COVID-19 patients are based on data up to April 5.
We also retrospectively fit the epidemic trajectory during the lockdown phase, once data became
available, to estimate the deviation from our assumptions (Additional file 1).
The simulated incidence of clinical cases (mild and severe symptoms) is compared to the regional
incidence of COVID-19 cases estimated by the syndromic and virological surveillance system29,42 (see
also Additional file 1) from week 12 (March 16 to 22, 2020). Validation is performed a posteriori on the
epidemic trajectories of hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and ICU beds occupation, during the full
lockdown period, once data became available.

Evaluation. Each intervention of social distancing is compared to the no intervention scenario in terms
of final attack rate, peak time, peak incidence, ICU beds demand in the region. The total number of ICU
beds in √éle-de-France has progressively increased over time up to a capacity of 2,800 ICU beds43 in an
effort to sustain the first wave and respond to the emergency (Figure 1). Passed the first wave, we
consider an ICU capacity restored at 1,500 beds in the months following the emergency44, as the
emergency response is not sustainable in the long term. This capacity corresponds to a 25% increase
compared to standard pre-COVID-19 size (1,147 beds), assuming that a certain level of preparedness
is kept in the upcoming months to face the possible evolution of the pandemic.
For each scenario, we perform 250 stochastic runs, median curves are displayed together with the
associated 95% probability ranges.
Sensitivity analysis. Results reported in the main paper refer to ùëù" = 0.2, those for ùëù" = 0.5 are
shown in the Additional file 1. We compare the lockdown based on our reconstructed matrix with (i) a
less stringent lockdown under the reduction of contacts measured in the UK45, (ii) a more stringent
lockdown under the reduction of contacts measured in China46, (iii) a fit of the model during the
lockdown phase, (iv) an additional version of our reconstructed matrix where physical contacts are
kept. Exit strategies Exit 1-4 are also examined with a lockdown lifted at the beginning of May, or of
June, and assuming that physical contacts are avoided in the upcoming months. In addition, we test
different relative susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to adults. We did not consider
scenarios assuming that infectiousness is constant across asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals,
as in contrast with available evidence8,23.

RESULTS
Reproduction number, start of the epidemic, population infected. The reproductive number for
our model is estimated to be ùëÖ% = 3.18 [3.09, 3.24] (95% confidence interval), computed with the nextgeneration approach47 based on the transmission rate estimated from hospital admissions in √éle-deFrance prior to lockdown (Figure 4).
Reported hospitalizations are consistent with an epidemic seeded in the region at the end of January
2020. The percentage of population in √éle-de-France predicted to be infected on May 11 ranges from
2% to 13% considering both values of the probability of being asymptomatic (Figure 4, and Additional
file 1 for the higher asymptomatic rate scenario). Overall infection fatality ratio is estimated to range
from 0.7% to 1.2%.

Black dots indicate data in the timeframe used for calibration, also indicated by the region in light blue; white dots indicate
data in the prediction timeframe. Our model predictions are compared to results obtained by fitting out model also in the
lockdown phase (orange line for the median curve). (b) Simulated weekly incidence of clinical cases (mild and severe)
compared to estimates of COVID-19 positive cases in the region provided by syndromic and virological surveillance (Reseau
Sentinelles (RS) data)42. (c) Simulated percentage of population infected over time. Results are shown for ùëù! =0.2. Shaded
areas correspond to 95% CI.

Lockdown followed by combination of interventions of different degrees of intensity. The
changes in contact matrices reconstructed to simulate the social distancing measures implemented
during lockdown reduce the number of contacts by 81% compared to baseline mixing patterns (Figure
1). This allows a substantial reduction of the reproductive number well below 1 (ùëÖ&' =0.68 [0.66,
0.69]). Under these conditions, the predicted incidence of clinical cases slows down and reduces
during lockdown, following the tendency reported by syndromic and virological surveillance (Figure 4).
The overestimation of clinical cases is explained with a consultation rate estimated to be around 35%
in the reported period, as documented from crowdsourced data38 (Fig. S3 in Appendix file 1). Fitting
the model to the epidemic trajectory during the lockdown phase would require a correction of 5%
increase in the transmissibility per contact (Figure 4 and Additional file 1).

The predicted number of ICU beds occupied saturates towards the strengthened capacity in the
region, before slowly decelerating and reducing over time. Predictions are consistent with
observations (Figure 5). The median ICU demand slightly overestimates the data, as our model does
not account for the transfer of patients in intensive care to less affected regions.
Model projections indicate that by May 11 the region would experience 516 [363, 682] new clinical
cases per day (corresponding to 1,170 [808, 1534] new infections) and 75 [49, 107] new admissions in
hospitals as shown in Figure 4 (of which 18 [10, 30] in ICUs), with an ICU system occupied at 48%
[31, 68]% of currently strengthened capacity (Figure 5).
Assuming a 90% decrease during lockdown predicts faster decrease in bed occupation (Figure 5).
With a less stringent reduction (73%), ùëÖ&' is just below 1 and the trend of occupied beds in ICUs is
predicted to continue to increase up to end of April. None of these situations is consistent with the
data. Considering physical contacts during lockdown would lead to a higher occupancy of ICU beds
than observed.

timeframe. (c) Simulated number of ICU beds occupied assuming a less stringent lockdown, under the reduction of contacts

The median prediction of our model is also shown for comparison (red curve). (d) Simulated number of ICU beds occupied
resulting from considering the inclusion of physical contacts during lockdown. The median prediction of our model is also

ICU capacity in the region (see Fig1b); shaded areas correspond to 95% probability ranges. Results are shown for ùëù! =0.2.

Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy, and going back to normal conditions, leads to a delay of the
peak compared to the no-intervention scenario (delay of about the duration of the lockdown) with
minimal effect on peak incidence (Figure 6). The peak number of ICU beds required is estimated to
be more than 60 times the restored regional capacity if no strategy is implemented after lockdown.
Combined interventions of different degrees of intensity implemented indefinitely after lifting the
lockdown in May substantially delay and mitigate the epidemic (Figure 6). School closure coupled with
senior isolation, and mild interventions reduce the peak incidence by approximately half (40%, 58%
respectively). Interventions of moderate intensity or higher (i.e. schools are closed, 50% of active
individuals work remotely, and at least 50% of non-essential activities are closed; seniors remain in
isolation) suppress the peak with more than 80% reduction gaining significant delay compared to the
no-exit strategy. Despite the strong mitigation of these scenarios, the peak demand on the healthcare
system is predicted however to exceed capacity by a large amount if interventions are at most of
moderate intensity (15 to 40 times higher than capacity) (Figure 6). Strict intervention would still
require twice the restored capacity of the system during the second wave.

Social distancing measures with case isolation.
Implementing aggressive case-finding and isolation together with social distancing allow the release of
the lockdown in May, engaging the ICU services below their maximum capacity throughout the
epidemic (Figure 7). On the medium- to long-term, different intensity of social distancing interventions
can be maintained, depending on the testing and isolation capacity. For example, strict interventions if
only 25% of cases are promptly identified and isolated (Exit 2), or moderate interventions if such
capacity is increased (50% case isolation, Exit 1). These two scenarios predict the occupation of more
than 500 beds in ICU up to the month of June. Lifting the lockdown at the beginning of May would
maintain ICU occupation over this level for the entire summer (Additional file 1). Delaying till early
June would achieve a stronger suppression of the epidemic.
Further relaxing social distancing constraints (e.g. allowing a larger proportion of individuals to go to
work and the full reopening of activities) would be possible by progressively going through decreasing
levels of intensity of interventions (from lockdown to strict interventions to mild interventions
afterwards) while maintaining highly efficient tracing (Exit 3). Alternatively, strict and mild interventions
can be rotated every month if case isolation capacity is less efficient (Exit 4).
All these scenarios foresee, however, that schools are closed, and seniors remain isolated.
All exit strategies would be able to maintain the epidemic under control in the upcoming months if a
larger proportion of infected individuals is asymptomatic. This is due to the smaller fraction of
individuals in the population with severe symptoms requiring hospitalization (Additional file 1). If
younger children and adolescents are less susceptible than older age classes, transmissions would
mainly occur from infectious adults and seniors. A higher transmission rate, with respect to the equal
susceptibility scenario, is thus required to reproduce the epidemic trajectory prior to lockdown. This is
due to the fact that younger age classes have a large number of contacts, but these contacts become
less important in the disease spread if individuals are less susceptible to contract the infection. In the
scenario analyses, the reduced susceptibility assumption would lead on average to a higher flux of
hospital admissions, as older age classes are the ones with higher probability of being hospitalized.
Exit strategies however exist that would maintain the epidemic under control (Additional file 1). Also,
changes in the risk of transmission from younger children would lead to similar results. If individuals
continue to avoid all physical contacts in the next months, all exit strategies considered here foresee
the suppression of the epidemic in the region (Additional file 1).

DISCUSSION
We use a stochastic age-structured epidemic transmission model calibrated on hospital admission
data in √éle-de-France to evaluate the impact of lockdown and exit strategies in controlling COVID-19
epidemic in the region. Our estimate of the reproductive number prior to lockdown is in line with
estimates for the epidemic growth in Europe prior to the implementation of interventions9-10, with
results from a meta-analysis of the literature12,45, and with concurrent studies in France35,48. We predict
it decreased significantly during lockdown with a 95% probability range well below 1. Under these
conditions, the occupancy of the ICU system reaches a plateau before clearly showing a decreasing
tendency after several weeks of lockdown, as also observed in other countries18. As of May 11, the
model predicts a 48% of ICU occupancy, with less than 30 new admission to ICUs per day.
Lifting lockdown with no exit strategy in place, i.e. going back to pre-lockdown conditions, would
inevitably lead to large rebound effects, as the immunity of the population is estimated to be still very
low (from 2% to 13% considering both values of probability of being asymptomatic explored), in
agreement with other estimates9,35. Prolonged interventions of moderate to high intensity could
additionally delay the epidemic peak by at least 2 months compared to the no-exit strategy and reduce
its peak incidence by more than 80%, but would not avoid exceeding ICU capacity (peak demand of 2-

15 times the restored ICU capacity of the region). Even with a 100% increase of ICU capacity to face
the second peak, strict interventions would be required for the next full year.
Control of the epidemic without overwhelming the healthcare system requires coupling social
distancing measures with aggressive testing to promptly identify infectious individuals and isolate
them. Response capacity is critical to lift the lockdown, so that the timeline of these interventions
should be carefully planned based on achieved preparedness. We consider different levels of testing
capacity starting from the month of May or June. If case isolation is performed on average 1.5 day
after infection and is efficient (90% reduction of contacts), we find that identifying at least 50% of all
new cases would be required to rapidly reduce the burden on the healthcare system while exiting
lockdown. Lower tracing capacity starting May would need to be coupled with more vigorous social
distancing to keep the epidemic under control. To release constraints on the population while building
capacity, a longer lockdown till June would aid releasing the pressure on the healthcare system. Also,
it would be ideal to perform contact tracing and testing while the epidemic is at low activity levels. The
benefit of these measures would go beyond the epidemic mitigation and extend to revising and
optimizing protocols to improve case-finding and isolation ‚Äì compared to the first phase of the
epidemic ‚Äì under more controlled conditions (reduced mixing of the population).
Fast, efficient, and large-scale contact tracing31 is one essential component allowing the partial
release of social distancing constraints in the upcoming months. This would require digital
technologies that are currently being investigated in Europe49 following the examples of COVID-19
response of countries in Asia50. Logistical constraints need to be envisioned, including large-scale and
rapid diagnostic capacity, large-scale adoption of the contact tracing technology by the population51,
uptake of recommendations, and coordination across countries to allow contact tracing across
borders49.
The set of mild or moderate interventions considered here still impose limitations. We tested strategies
allowing a larger proportion of the population to go back to work, also to partially release the huge
economic pressure that lockdown generated. Global economic uncertainty is at a record high52, due to
the fear of COVID-19 pandemic spread, income losses, and globally stalled economies because of
exceptional interventions freezing production. As a side effect, lockdown has likely created a forced
opportunity to re-organize certain professional activities to make telework possible and efficient at
larger scale than previously foreseen. Prior to lockdown, a small fraction of Europeans practiced
telework37. If this change of paradigm is maintained beyond emergency response, it would be
extremely valuable in the medium- to long-term to aid the control of the epidemic below healthcare
system saturation. Rotation of individuals working from home (e.g. every week, or every 2 weeks) can
be envisioned to maintain the required social distancing levels in the community while ensuring reallife connections.
Here we consider unchanged intervention measures regarding children and seniors across all
scenarios. Schools are assumed to remain closed, though reopening of certain school levels is
possible under different protocols of attendance44. Seniors are considered to maintain a reduction of
contacts through hygienic measures and physical distance, as they are especially vulnerable against
COVID-19. Planning for the upcoming months under these conditions should include logistics to
facilitate daily routines of the elderly beyond this phase of emergency, e.g. improving delivery of
grocery and medicines, facilitating remote access to healthcare, providing learning programs for the
use of technologies to stay connected, and other initiatives. Reopening of the schools in the fall/winter
should be explored in the following months once the impact of these interventions will be further
assessed44.

ICU capacity underwent a large increase in the last weeks to face the rapid surge of patients in critical
conditions16. Capacities have been stretched in the most affected regions, and patients have also
been transferred to other regions for adequate care. Exiting the current emergency, we envision that
ICU capacity will be restored to lower levels for the upcoming months. If a second emergency were to
occur, the system would need to be strengthened again to higher limits.
Our findings are based on the mechanistically reconstructed changes in the contact matrices that aim
to reproduce the implemented social distancing measures, as done in previous works7,12. While
reconstructing changes in the contact matrices remains arbitrary, available elements support our
estimates. First, not being fitted to the lockdown period, our contact matrices reconstructed from social
contact data lead to model projections in line with observations across several indicators. The fit to the
epidemic trajectory, retrospectively performed once data became available, shows that a correction of
only 5% in the transmissibility per contact is needed to better describe the epidemic compared to our
mechanistically reconstructed matrices. This indicates that the assumptions behind the reconstruction
of the matrix, affecting each age bracket in a different way, are able to capture the dynamics of the
epidemic during lockdown. Such finding can improve the parameterization of similar models based on
contact matrices for the study of COVID-19 epidemic in other regions or countries. At the same time, it
also suggests that physical contacts were successfully avoided during lockdown, in compliance with
the recommendations of health authorities. Second, our predicted reduction of 81% of the average
number of contacts during lockdown is lower than the one measured in China in the cities of Wuhan
(86%) and Shanghai (89%)46. Stricter measures were implemented in China during lockdown
compared to Europe, including for example complete suspension of public transport, ban of cars from
roads except for the essential services, barring residents from leaving the apartment in certain areas
or limiting it to one household member few days per week, performing health checks door to door to
identify and isolate ill individuals. These measures are expected therefore to have a more substantial
effect on reducing the number of contacts per individual compared to social distancing measures
implemented in many European countries. Indeed, under conditions measured in China, the ICU
system is predicted by our model to receive less patients and clear them more rapidly than what we
currently see in the data. Third, our prediction for contact reduction is close to, but larger than the
empirically estimated 73% reduction of a recent social contact survey conducted in the UK during the
lockdown phase45. Implementation of social distancing however differs in the two countries. For
example, in the UK parks remain open, no self-declaration to circulate is needed, and displacements
are not restricted on distance. Assuming the conditions measured in the UK, the model predicts a first
peak exceeding ICU capacity. Collecting contact data in France during lockdown, as done in the UK,
would allow a better measurement of the mixing patterns altered by social distancing to be compared
with our synthetically reconstructed lockdown matrix. Possible changes in population adherence over
time, and consequential strengthening of measures by authorities, need however to be taken into
account.
Our study is affected by limitations. We did not include explicitly the effect of using masks. Evidence
on seasonal coronaviruses indicate that surgical masks may reduce onward transmission53. Masks are
largely adopted or enforced in Asia, while they just became a recommended or compulsory protection
in certain areas in Europe and United States, mainly as a precautionary measure54. If effective, their
widespread use may help decrease the risk of transmission in the community. As more
epidemiological evidence accrues, this effect can be taken into account and help further alleviate
control measures. We did not consider seasonal behavior in viral transmission11,13, because of current
lack of evidence. In our simulated epidemics, multiple peaks are observed because of the
implementation of social distancing interventions able to reduce the reproductive number below 1. If

seasonal forcing is to be expected, the interplay with seasonality should be carefully considered in the
planning of the short- and long-term control strategies11. Exit strategies are based on matrices
including both physical and non-physical contacts. We saw that excluding physical contacts
substantially contributed to the reduction of the reproductive number during lockdown. At this stage,
however, large uncertainty exists on recommendations and protocols imposed by authorities to phase
out lockdown. Moreover, our scenarios plan out for several months, and recommendations as well as
population adoption may strongly change over this long time period. Findings reported in the main text
therefore corresponds to a conservative choice. If physical contacts are avoided for several months,
the epidemic would go locally extinct. Treatment of COVID-19 patients improved over time, as
documented by lower probabilities for requiring intensive care and shorter durations in ICU (Additional
file 1). These data became available at the time of revision and were not included in the analysis. The
more efficient management of COVID-19 patients is expected to reduce the burden in the upcoming
months.
We tested two values for the probability of being asymptomatic, as there still exist large uncertainty20‚Äì
23
. Few studies investigated the clinical progression of symptoms over time until viral clearance.
Additional household studies now launched in Europe will help providing a better understanding of the
presence of asymptomatic cases and their contribution to transmission. Evidence so far seems to
indicate that this fraction may be low23, therefore we presented in the main paper results for ùëù" = 0.2.
Estimates of age-specific severity and case fatality rates are still rapidly evolving and often vary across
countries due to different surveillance systems and testing protocols in place. Here we used estimates
of age-specific severity informed from a model-based analysis on individual-level data from China and
other countries19. Rates describing the hospitalization duration and outcome of a patient were based
on French data28. Infection fatality ratios estimated by our model are consistent with estimates
provided in Ref.19. We do not consider here data on comorbidities that will alter hospitalization and
fatality rates. Large-scale testing in France will allow us to robustly estimate age-specific
hospitalization rates to better inform the model.
Concurrently to our work, other studies became available that assessed the epidemic in France35,48.
All studies independently produced similar estimates characterizing the epidemic and the
effectiveness of lockdown, providing a consensus of evaluations despite modeling discrepancies (e.g.
equal transmissibility across asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals in Ref.35, or 90%
reduction in transmissibility of asymptomatic cases in Ref.48, compared to our 45% reduction informed
by prior modeling work8). However, each focused on different aspects, specifically to evaluate the
impact of lockdown and estimate population immunity35, or to estimate the total number of averted ICU
admissions and deaths due to lockdown48, whereas no study proposed exit strategies and their
evaluation while on lockdown.
Our results are based on data from √éle-de-France, currently one of the most affected region by the
COVID-19 epidemic in the country, and not directly applicable to other regions. Few differences in the
results due to variations of age profile across regions are to be expected55. The most relevant changes
will however result from the different epidemic phase experienced by each region at the moment of
nationwide application of the lockdown. Overall, findings on exit strategies remain valid, but more
specific interventions, differentially targeting the regions, may be envisioned.

CONCLUSIONS
France, as many other countries in the world, implemented a nationwide lockdown to curb the
dramatic increase in the number of patients in critical conditions. Assessing the impact of lockdown
and identifying the optimal strategies to manage the health crisis beyond lockdown is of critical
importance. Substantial social distancing will be needed in the upcoming months due to the currently
low population immunity. Given the features of COVID-19 pandemic, extensive case-finding and
isolation following lockdown are required to progressively lower the intensity of current interventions
and avoid that the healthcare system exceeds saturation. Response planning needs to urgently
prioritize the logistics and capacity for these interventions.

1.2. Generation time distribution
The generation time distribution in a compartmental epidemic model can be computed thanks to the
theory developed by Svensson12 . Let ùëã and ùëå be the random variables describing the latency period
and the infectious period, respectively. Then the distribution of the generation time is the result of the
convolution ùëî ‚àó ‚Ñé# , with ùëî being the probability density function of ùëã and
1 ‚àí ùêª(ùë°)
‚Ñé# (ùë°) =
ùê∏(ùëå)
where ùêª is the cumulative distribution function of ùëå, and ùê∏(ùëå) is the mean.
In the compartmental model under consideration (Figure 2), we have that ùëã is exponentially distributed
with rate ùúñ, and ùëå is the sum of two exponentially distributed random variables (prodromic phase and
infectious period, with rate ùúá! and ùúá respectively). Computations show that the corresponding
generation time distribution is
ùúñ ùúá! ùúá
ùúá!
ùúá
(ùëí 34" 5 ‚àí ùëí 36 5 ) ‚àí
(ùëí 34 5 ‚àí ùëí 36 5 )]
ùëì(ùë°) =
[
(ùúñ ‚àí ùúá )
(ùúá! + ùúá)(ùúá ‚àí ùúá! ) <ùúñ ‚àí ùúá! =
Given the values of ùúñ and ùúá! informed from the literature (Table S1), we choose ùúá so that the mean of
the generation time equals to 6.6 days. The shape of the distribution is displayed in Figure S1 and it
closely resembles a gamma distribution with mean 6.6 and shape parameter 1.87, estimated in Ref.18

1.3. Estimation of within-hospital parameters
We fit data on patient trajectories recorded in √éle-de-France hospitals after admission up to April 5,
2020. Data consisted of age, sex, date of hospital admission and subsequent dates of discharge or
death, and, when relevant, dates of entering/leaving the ICU. We fit mixture and competing risks
models to time to event data, taking into account censoring due to patients being still in the hospital at
the time of analysis. We used exponential distributions for time to event data to match the hypotheses
of the compartmental epidemic model.
First, we model time from admission to entering the ICU or being discharged/dead for those who do
not go to the ICU. Write T for the time to the first of the 3 following events: entering the ICU, being
discharged alive or dying in the hospital. T is modelled as a mixture of 2 exponential distributions: T ~
ùúã9:; ùê∏ùë•ùëù(ùúÜ9:; ) + (1 ‚àí ùúã9:; )ùê∏ùë•ùëù(ùúÜ< ), where ùúã9:; is the probability to go to the ICU, and ùúÜ9:; , ùúÜ< are the
rates of the exponential distributions. The second exponential describes time spent in the hospital by
those who don‚Äôt go the ICU subject to competition of 2 outcomes, discharge or death. Therefore, ùúÜ< =
ùúÜ'9= + ùúÜ'>< where ùúÜ'9= is the rate of discharge and ùúÜ'>< the rate of death. The average time spent in
the hospital is 1/ùúÜ< , and the probability of being discharged alive is ùúÜ'9= ‚ÅÑ(ùúÜ'9= + ùúÜ'>< ). Therefore, the
likelihood of a patient trajectory observed up to time t with final status s (comprising still hospitalized HOS, admitted to ICU - ICU, discharged alive - DIS, dead - DTH) is given by :
ùêø(ùúã9:; , ùúÜ9:; , ùúÜ'9= , ùúÜ'>< ) = (ùúã9:; ùúÜ9:; exp(‚àíùúÜ9:; ùë°))#?9:;
@3#?9:;

<(1 ‚àí ùúã9:; ) (ùúÜ'9= ‚ÅÑ(ùúÜ'9= + ùúÜ'>< ))#?'9= (ùúÜ'>< ‚ÅÑ(ùúÜ'9= + ùúÜ'>< ))#?'>< exp(‚àí(ùúÜ'9= + ùúÜ'>< )ùë°)=
(1 ‚àí ùúã9:; exp(‚àíùúÜ9:; ùë°) ‚àí (1 ‚àí ùúã9:; )exp (‚àí(ùúÜ'9= + ùúÜ'>< ) ùë°))#?<A=

The first line is for patients going to the ICU, the second line for those being discharged alive or dead
and the third line for patients who were censored because they were still in the hospital.
Likewise, we fit time to discharge or death after admission to the ICU using a competing risk approach
with exponential parameters ¬µ for being discharged alive or dead; the likelihood is therefore:
ùêø(ùúá'9= , ùúá'>< ) =
@3#?9:;

((ùúá'9= ‚ÅÑ(ùúá'9= + ùúá'>< )) #?'9= (ùúá'>< ‚ÅÑ(ùúá'9= + ùúá'>< ))#?'>< exp(‚àí(ùúá'9= + ùúá'>< )ùë°))
(1 ‚àí exp (‚àí(ùúá'9= + ùúá'>< ) ùë°))#?<A=

As the data is rounded to the nearest day, we discretized the exponential distributions in the likelihood.
All models were fitted at maximum likelihood using the software R.
Estimates up to April 5, 2020 were also compared to values estimated in the period April 5-26 to
assess possible changes in the management of COVID-19 patients at the hospital. We report the
values in Table S2. These estimates are discussed in the main paper, but are not included in the
analysis, as they became available at a later time.

2. MODEL CALIBRATION
The model was calibrated to hospital admission data through a maximum likelihood approach. The
likelihood function is of the form
5#

ùêø(ùê∑ùëéùë°ùëé|Œò) = N ùëÉùëúùëñùë†ùë† RùêªBC# (ùë°)Sùêª!DEF (ùë°)T
5?5$

where Œò indicates the set of parameters to be estimated, ùêªBC# (ùë°) is the observed number of hospital
admissions on day ùë°, ùêª!DEF (ùë°) is the number of hospital admissions predicted by the model on day ùë°,
ùëÉùëúùëñùë†ùë† R‚ãÖ Sùêª!DEF (ùë°)T is the probability mass function of a Poisson distribution with mean ùêª!DEF (ùë°), and
[ùë°@ , ùë°G ] is the time window considered for the fit. We fit the transmission rate per contact before
lockdown and the starting date of the simulation, considering a time window ranging from March 1 to
March 23, 2020. Hospital admissions in the interval March 17-23 were included as still not affected by
lockdown, due to delay between date of infection and date of hospitalization (~1 week). The resulting
estimate of the transmission rate is 0.0791, with 95% CI [0.0769, 0.0806], corresponding to ùëÖ% = 3.18
[3.09, 3.24].
Our model predictions were also compared to the ones obtained by fitting the model to hospital
admission data during lockdown. We chose the period April 13-May 10 to avoid the initial fluctuations
due to the implementation of lockdown. By doing that, we obtain an estimated transmission rate at
0.0833, corresponding to a 5.3% increase with respect to the transmission rate prior to lockdown.
The number of hospital admissions, ICU admissions and ICU occupancy over time for Ile-de-France
(Figure 4a, Figure 5) are available in an open access repository
(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Q5BlJw2N6b5uf8T2E3leTul91tAyqOvKhymvPDyhHk/edit?
usp=sharing). They are part of the SIVIC database maintained by the Agence du Num√©rique en Sant√©
and Sant√© Publique. The same online repository also contains the incidence of clinical cases
estimated from sentinel and virological surveillance by R√©seau Sentinelles (Figure 4b).
