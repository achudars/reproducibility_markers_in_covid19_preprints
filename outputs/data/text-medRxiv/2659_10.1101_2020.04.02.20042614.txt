Abstract
Objective: To assess the characteristics of computed tomography (CT) features and changes in CT
monitoring

in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) .

Methods: In this retrospective, two-center study, we reviewed the medical records of 57 patients
with NCP in CT from January 21 to February 12, 2020. Cases were confirmed by the results of
nucleic acid test positive, and were analyzed for demographic, clinical, and CT features.
Results: Of the 57 patients, 31cases were male, and 45.6% were female. The average age was
46.5 ± 15.8 years. Patients had fever (84.2%), cough (49.1%), weak (31.6%), muscle ache (17.5%),
shortness of breath (12.3%). The distribution of abnormality was a subpleural lesions in 51 cases,
with 96.5% ground-glass opacity (GGO) and 68.4% consolidation. Another observation reveals
45.6% fibrosis, 33.3% lymph node enlargement, 21.1% pleural thickening, 17.5% small nodule,
7.0% white lung, 5.3% emphysema, and 3.5% bronchiectasis. Importantly, the group of men had
more septal thickening and air trapping than the female group (p<0.05); Compared with the
younger, the elderly had higher of subpleural lesion, interlobular septal thickening and pleural
thickening (p<0.05). In the first monitoring, there were 37.3% improvement, 60.8% progress. In
the second monitoring, there were 55% improvement, 35% progress. The improvement rate during
the third follow-up visit was 100%.
Conclusions: CT features and CT dynamic observation play a vital role in the diagnosis and
treatment with NCP. It is conducive to early diagnosis, deepen the knowledge of NCP and
accumulate experience.

Introduction
In December 2019, acute respiratory disease broke out in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China,
now known as novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)1-7. The disease has been rapidly spread to
other districts and other countries by Wuhan. As of February 16, 2020, a total of 26 states and five
continents have reported cases6. 2019-nCoV not only is it an acute disease, but it is also an
effective communication between people through coughing, sneezing or direct contact8. Although
most of the time patients have no or slight clinical manifestations of infection with 2019-nCoV,
the imaging performance is usually good and serious. Lung injury caused by 2019-nCoV is one of
the leading clinical signs and affects the prognosis directly. Imaging CT plays an essential role in
the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with NCP. Although the national CT strategy is
documented, those studies focus mainly on the epidemiology, clinical treatment, and disease
treatment7, 9-11. So far, we have identified some of the studies concerning CT results

12-16.

There’s

very little research on the CT quality and the NCP CT scan results. The current retrospective study
was intended to evaluate the thin-slice CT features and CT-follow-up results in NCP patients.

Patients
In this retrospective binocular center study, 57 patients with NCP were examined on plain CT
from January 21 to Febuary 15, 2020 in the First Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University and the
Affiliated Beijing Youan Hospital of Beijing Capital Medical University. The cases were
confirmed with a positive nucleic acid test and analyzed for demographic, clinical and CT features.
Follow up to February 19, 2020. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Ethical
Review Committee of the First Affiliated Hospita of Xinjiang Medical University
(No.2020120-06). The present study abandoned the need for individual consent for retrospective
observation studies.
CT scans
CT scans were created using a 64-speed multi-scan system (High Speed; GE Medical Systems,
Milwaukee, WI, USA, and Light Speed; GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA).
Nonenhanced CT had been processed with numbers: 120 kVp, 150 mA, 5-mm thick. Thin-section
CT images have been reconstructed using 1-mm or 1.25-mm collimation, which have been
evaluated using a lung window, 1600-window width and 600-window level, and then send to the
workstation (ADW 4.2; GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) by analysis.
Image interpretation
All CT images were independently evaluated by two radiologists (GH and QS with 15 and 20
years’ CT experience, respectively). Both radiologists had to agree on the anomaly.
Taking into account standard morphological descriptors based on the recommendations of the
Fleischner Society Nomenclature Committee17 and other study18, the examination of thin-slice CT
abnormalities (unilateral lung, unilateral lung or pulmonary segment) included distribution of
lesions, ground-glass opacity (GGO), number (single or two or multiple), GGO with consolidation,
consolidation, air trapping, air bronchogram, vascular bundle thickening, fibrosis, interlobular
septal thickening, lymph node enlargement (≥5 mm), pleural thickening, crazy-paving, small
nodule, halo sign, white lung, bronchiectasis, emphysema. The assessment of the extent of lung
involvement was based on segments of pulmonary anatomy: 10 segments in the right lung and ten
segments in the left lung (2 segments were considered in the apicoposterius segment left upper
lobe, and two segments were considered in the inferior front segment of the left lower lobe).
Follow-up of NCP patients was improved, partial improvement - progress, and progression. The

improvement was defined as absorption or/and area reduction of one or/and two or multiple GGOs
or/and consolidation. Partial improvement - progression was defined as local absorption or/and
partial reduction of GGOs or/and consolidation. Progression was defined as area increasing or/and
lesion as addition of GGOs or/and consolidation, and white lung may even occur.
Statistical analysis
We collected date on age, symptoms, CT finding. All data are expressed as the percentage. We
collected the data on age and clinical time. All data are expressed as means ± standard deviation
(SD). The Chi-square analysed some of the differences between the two groups. A P < 0.05 was
considered a statistically significant difference.
Results
Baseline characteristics of patients
The basic characteristics of NCP patients are shown in Table 1. Of the 57 patients, 31cases were
male, and 45.6% were female. The average age of the patients was 46.5 ± 15.8 years (age range
1-78 years). 2 patients were children (aged one years and 16 years). The time from the onset of
symptoms to hospital presentation ranged from 2 to 10 days (mean time 5.0 ± 1.9 days). The most
common symptom was fever (84.2%), followed by cough (49.1%), weak (31.6%), muscle
soreness (17.5%), shortness of breath (12.3%), respectively. The temperature of no less than 38 。
had 32 cases.
CT findings
All patients underwent CT on the day of admission. 51 CT scans were first repeated in the hospital,
and 20 patients, one case was investigated in the second follow-up, third follow-up, as appropriate.
The distribution of NCP lesions on chest CT patterns is shown in Table 2. Of the 57 patients, 15
(25.3%) were unidirectional except for one without abnormality: right lung in 6 (10.5%) and left
lung in 9 (15.8%). The lesions were bilateral in 41 (71.9%) patients. The distribution of anomalies
was predominantly subpleural lesions in 51 (89.5%) patients (Fig. 1). The most lesions were
located in the anteromedial basal (63.2%) from the lower lobe of the left lung, followed by the
lateral basal (59.6%) of the lower lobe of the right lung, medial basal (47.4%) of the lower lobe of
the left lung, etc. (summarized in Table 2). One lung had one segment and two segments involved
in 7 cases. Parenchymal changes primarily represented GGOs in the lung. The three categories of
GGO are single (8.8%), two (15.8%), multiple (48.2%), respectively.

Comparing CT characteristics between the two groups
We divided these patients into a group of man and female (Table 4). There were more interlobular
septal thickening in the male group (54.8%) than in the female group (23.1%) (p=0.015). There
were significantly more air trapping in the male group (35.5%) than in the female group (7.7%)
(p=0.013).
We stratified the patients into two age groups (Table 5), as age ≤ 50 years and age > 50 years.

Follow-up changes by CT findings over time
Fifty-one patients were monitored, and the mean monitoring was 4.7 ± 1.8 days (range, 2 to 15
days). The mean time from hospital to the first monitoring was three days (range, 2 to 11 days).
Monitoring of 1-time period was 51 patients, 20 cases of 2-times, 1 case of three-times.
The results of predominant CT findings showed the three types: improvement, partial
improvement-progression, progression. When CT scanned the first follow-up in 51 patients, there
were 37.3% improvement (Figure 6A-B), 2.0% partial improvement - progress, 60.8% progress
(Figure 4B-C). The second CT follow-up performed twenty, and 11 cases, two patients and 7 cases
showed an improvement, part improvement - progression, progression, respectively. Only one
case was followed up on three CT scans, and 100% was improved.
Discussion
This study shows that bilateral and subpleural regions on CT are common in patients with NCP,
which were more extensive GGOs than consolidation. In one case, however, there was no

abnormality, and the other had two small nodules in the lateral basal of the right lower lobe.
Another observation is that more than one-third of patients reveal fibrosis, lymph node
enlargement, and some patients may cause pleural thickening, small nodule, white lung,
emphysema, and bronchiectasis. The most important thing is that the interlobular septal thickening
and air trapping of the male group is more than that of the female group; In the elderly, the
subpleural lesion, septal thickening, and pleural thickening increase much more than in the
younger.
When faced with suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection and need to identify NCP in time, we
may encounter the following several reasons. First, patients with 2019-nCoV infection may
develop asymptomatic or mild symptoms. Second, nucleic acid detections in patient’s respiratory
samples may present negative results. Third, even in cases identified with 2019-nCoV, the result of
nucleic acid testing may be given 24-hours later. In patients with fever in close contact with the
eruption areas of 2019-nCoV, familiarity with the CT findings may assist in early diagnosis, early
isolation, and management.
CT is useful for clarifying the abnormality of the patient’s lung and, especially, to describe the
patterns and range of abnormality with coronavirus pneumonia19-21. In the current study, the
predominance of GGOs and consolidation in the subpleural regions is remarkable. The GGOs and
consolidation in such a distribution have been described as suggestive of a coronavirus22,23 and
other pneumonia patterns24,25. However, they have different aspects. On CT images, centrilobular
nodules, pseudocavitation, pneumatocele formation are commonly seen in H5N1 pneumonia24, but
are not seen in NCP patients. During the disease, pleural effusions and cavitation can also be
found in H5N1 pneumonia, but have not been developed in patients with

NCP. In patients with

severe rhinovirus pneumonia, bilateral patchy consolidation with multifocal GGO and septal
thickening are noted25. Cavitation, pleural effusions, or lymphadenopathy are not characteristic
manifestations of SARS pneumonia [26], but 33.3% increases in lymph node enlargements are
observed in patients with NCP. A few patients may see interlobular septal thickening and pleural
effusions in MERS pneumonia22, and pneumothorax and pleural effusion are more common in
patients who have died than in those who have recovered27. In NCP patients, we haven’t seen
pneumothorax, or pleural effusion, 40.4% interlobular septal thickening, 45.6% fibrosis, 45.6%
vascular bundle thickening were often seen. In addition to the above findings, NCP also includes

air trapping, crazy-paving, pleural thickening, halo sign, white lung, and emphysema. Another
finding in this study is the presence of air bronchogram, air trapping, or bronchiectasis, all of
which manifest as airway abnormalities. Air bronchogram, air trapping, bronchiectasis were found
in 33 patients, 13 patients, two patients, respectively.
CT patterns of coronavirus pneumonia are associated with the pathogenesis of coronavirus
infections. Most viral pneumonia of the imaging patterns share a similarity based on viridian,
because viruses of the same miridae have a similar pathogenesis28. The pathological characteristics
of NCP are probably interstitial interventions in alveolar walls and peribronchiolar, which are
related to the pathogenesis of S-protein binding to ACE2 receptors in alveolar type III epithelial
cells and subsequent damage. The physiological factors can show the damaged alveolar walls and
septal, peribronchiolar, expansion congestion of alveolar-capillary, and distinctly organization
infiltration in alveolar space29. At this stage, it is too early to draw reliable conclusions, but our
opinion on 2019-nCoV can go through the same evolution as SARS-CoV.
We analyzed the CT characteristics between male and female groups. The interlobular septal
thickening and air trapping in the male group were significantly higher that in female group. We
also analyzed the CT characteristics between elder and younger groups. We discovered that there
was significantly more subpleural lesions (including GGO, consolidation, and small nodule),
interlobular septal thickening, and lymph node enlargement in the elder than in the younger group.
These mechanisms are unclear and need further study.
At present, we analyzed in the first follow-up visit with an average duration of three days,
improvement in 19 of the 51 cases (37.3%) and 60.8% progression. When we extended visits, 11
of the 20 patients (55%)performed better, 35.0% progression. It is interesting that two patients
showed an increase in lymph nodes in the mediastinum during the second monitoring.
The present study is not without limitations. This study is a retrospective study of patients
assessed by the two centers, including all selection questions and observation bias. Secondly, we
need to further study the changes of a bigger sample in the CT features and CT follow-up with
NCP.
In summary, CT characteristics and CT dynamic observation play a vital role in diagnosis and
treatment with NCP, which is conducive to early diagnosis of the disease, our further
understanding of the disease, and accumulation of experience.
