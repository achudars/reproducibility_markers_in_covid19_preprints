ABSTRACT
Background: The SEIR model or a variation of it is commonly used to study epidemic spread and
make predictions on how it evolves. It is used to guide officials in their response to an
epidemic. This research demonstrates an effective and simple approach that estimates the
parameters of any variations of the SEIR model. This new technique will be demonstrated on
the spread of COVID-19 in Libya.
Methods: A five compartmental epidemic model is used to model the COVID-19 pandemic in
Libya. Two sets of data are needed to evaluate the model parameters, the cumulative number
of symptomatic cases and the total number of active cases. This data along with the assumption
that the cumulative number of symptomatic cases grows exponentially, to determine most of
the model parameters.
Results: Libya’s epidemic start-date was estimated as 𝑡𝑜 = −18 ⋅ 5 days, corresponding to May
5th. We mathematically demonstrated that the number of active cases follows two competing
exponential distributions: a positive exponential function, measuring how many new cases are
added, and a negative exponential function, measuring how many cases recovered. From this
distribution we showed that the average recovery time is 48 days, and the incubation period is
15.2 days. Finally, the productive number was estimated as R0 = 7·6.
Conclusions: With only the cumulative number of cases and the total number of active cases of
COVID19, several important SEIR model parameters can be measured effectively. This approach
can be applied for any infectious disease epidemic anywhere in the world.

NOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION
Compartmental models such as SEIR is one of the most commonly used model to study
epidemic spread 1–7 and make predictions on how an epidemic will evolve in the future 1,4,5,8–11.
The compartmental models lead to a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations with
some parameters that define how the epidemic evolves and how an infected individual moves
from one state of the disease to another. The epidemiologist’s goal is to solve for these
parameters which is difficult task considering the nature and nonlinearity of the differential
equations. Consequently, many researchers rely on empirical values or assume a value for some
of the parameters 1,2,6,7. These assumptions usually lead to discrepancies in the results or in the
prediction of how an epidemic grows 12. Recognizing this, we devised a new approach and
developed a technique never before used, in order to estimate most of the parameters from
the model itself without any assumption of any parameter except that the number of
cumulative cases is assumed to follow an exponential growth which is expected in any
epidemic. This new approach is general and can be applied on any compartmental model, but
for the sake of clarity we demonstrated it here on the spread of COVID-19 in Libya.
In Libya, the development of COVID-19 cases differs than most countries where the epidemic
progression can be divided into three stages. As shown in Figure 1. Stage I: The first known case
was discovered on March/24/2020, and since then there was a steady increase in the number
of cases till April/20/2020 where the number of cases reached 60. Stage II: from April/21/2020
till May/23/2020 the number of total cases was relatively constant throughout this period and
there was a slight uptick in the number of cases at the end of this stage where the number of
total cases reached 75. Stage III: Since May/24, the number of cases started to exponentially
grow and rise rapidly, which alarmed the medical community in Libya.
A compartmental model is used to model the epidemic in Libya between the period of May
24th – June 4th. Our analysis focused on this period because this is the time when the epidemic
started and when it showed an exponential growth pattern. One distinguishing aspect of Covid19 is that it can be transmitted from infected individuals to healthy ones during the incubation
period (pre-symptomatic infection), and it can also be transmitted from an infected individuals

who doesn’t show any symptoms (or have mild symptoms) after the incubation period
(Asymptomatic infection) 23,24 . These aspects were included in our model.
METHODS
The epidemic model as shown in Figure 2 is divided into five compartments and every individual
in the population is assumed to be in one of these compartments. Susceptible, S(t): people in
this state are healthy but at risk of contracting the virus at any time. Pre-symptomatic
infectious, I(t): people who are at the early stages of contracting the virus (Incubation period)
and did not shows symptoms yet but can transmit the virus to others. Symptomatic infectious
(Active cases), A(t): those who show the sign of virus and are being hospitalized or quarantined
therefore, they cannot transmit the virus. Unreported Asymptomatic infectious (Unknown
cases) U(t): those individuals who do not show any sign of sickness and do not know that they
have the virus, this group can easily transmit the virus to others. Removed state, R(t): those
individuals who die or recover from the virus. 𝐶(𝑡)is not an epidemiological state, rather it’s a
way to keep track of the cumulative number of active cases from the moment they become
symptomatic infectious.
There are two states where the disease can be transmitted from a sick person to a healthy one
(Pre-symptomatic infection I(t) and Unreported asymptomatic infectious U(t)) Therefore, a
susceptible person in state, S(t) enters the pre-symptomatic infectious class, I(t), at a rate
𝜏 [ 𝐼(𝑡) + 𝑈(𝑡)] where 𝜏 is the transmission rate. After an incubation period of 1⁄𝜐 a
percentage 𝑓 of the pre-Symptomatic individuals develop symptoms or are discovered by the
health system, thus, enters the Symptomatic active state A(t) and either enter hospital or
quarantine, 𝑓 has a value between 0 and 1. The rest of the pre-symptomatic individuals (1 − 𝑓)
do not show signs of sickness and move to the Asymptomatic unknown state U(t). After a
recovery period, both Symptomatic and Asymptomatic individuals move to the recovered state
either by death or recovery at the rate 𝜂. Where 1⁄𝜂 is the recovery period.
Also, we will assume the first individual got infected at time 𝑡𝑜 , so 𝑡𝑜 represent the starting time
of the epidemic. This person will go through an incubation period 1/𝜈𝑜 to show any symptoms,
therefore he will show symptoms at time 𝑡1 . This distinction between the starting time for the

epidemic and the starting time when the first active case showed symptoms is really important
in solving our model as we will see later. The important parameters are listed in Table-A.1 in the
supporting document
The above process can be modeled by the following system of ordinary differential equations.
𝑆̇(𝑡) = −𝜏 𝑆(𝑡)[𝐼(𝑡) + 𝑈(𝑡)]
𝐼 (̇ 𝑡) = 𝜏 𝑆(𝑡)[𝐼(𝑡) + 𝑈(𝑡)] − 𝜈 𝐼(𝑡)
𝐴̇(𝑡) = 𝑓𝜈 𝐼(𝑡) − 𝜂 𝐴(𝑡)
𝑈̇(𝑡) = (1 − 𝑓)𝜈𝐼(𝑡) − 𝜂𝑈(𝑡)
{ 𝐶̇ (𝑡) = 𝑓𝜈 𝐼(𝑡)
Where the dot indicates derivative with respect to time i.e. 𝑆̇(𝑡) ≡

1𝑎
1𝑏
1𝑐
1𝑑
1𝑒
𝑑𝑆
𝑑𝑡

, 𝐼 (̇ 𝑡) ≡

𝑑𝐼
𝑑𝑡

… etc.

This is a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations where the exact solution is difficult
to find, however, we will show that equation (1c) and (1d) can be reduced to linear ordinary
differential equations of the first order which can easily be solved if the number of cumulative
cases follows known distribution such as exponential distribution.
RESULTS
To estimate the model parameters, two sets of reported data are used which are the
cumulative number of symptomatic cases and the active number of cases. This data is shown in
Table-A.2 in the supporting documents. The process includes fitting the cumulative number of
symptomatic cases to exponential function, and then it will be shown that mathematically, the
number of active cases has to fit two exponential functions.
Cumulative number of cases and the starting time of epidemic
Usually, the cumulative number of infected individuals in any epidemic grows exponentially,
therefore, it’s customary to assume the cumulative number of cases follows an exponential
function and the constants of the function are evaluated from the data. Thus, we will assume
the cumulative number of cases follows the form
𝐶(𝑡) = 𝛼1 exp(𝛼2 𝑡) − 𝛼3

Where 𝛼1 , 𝛼2 and 𝛼3 are constants that needs to be evaluated from the data. For this
exponential equation, a least square regression with numerical integration is used to evaluate
the constants. The steps for the regression are detailed in Appendix B, while the results are
shown in Figure 3. The results for the constants 𝛼1 , 𝛼2 and 𝛼3 are 76.34, 0.0923 and 13.8
respectively. Also, the starting time of the epidemic 𝑡𝑜 can be estimated by setting 𝐶(𝑡𝑜 ) = 0
which yields
𝑡𝑜 =

1
𝛼3
𝑙𝑛 ( )
𝛼2
𝛼1

(3)

Applying equation (3) leads to 𝑡𝑜 = −18.52 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 which corresponds to May 5th.
The regression results were used to predict the progression of the epidemic in the future.
Figure 3 shows our prediction of the outbreak compared to the actual data. Starting from June
4th, the prediction is up to 8 days in the future.
The number of active cases
The distribution of the active cases can be estimated using equation (1c) in addition to
nonlinear regression on the active cases data. First, we can write equation (1c) in the form
𝐴̇(𝑡) + 𝜂 𝐴(𝑡) = 𝑓𝜈 𝐼(𝑡)

(4)

Substitute equations (2) and (1e) into equation (4) yields
𝐴̇(𝑡) + 𝜂 𝐴(𝑡) = 𝛼1 𝛼2 exp(𝛼2 𝑡)

(5)

Equation(5) is a linear differential equation of the first order in the form 𝑦̇ + 𝑎(𝑡)𝑦 = ℎ(𝑡)
where 𝑎(𝑡) = 𝜂 and ℎ(𝑡) = 𝛼1 𝛼2 exp(𝛼2 𝑡). This equation can easily be solved using an
integration factor 27. The steps to solve this equation are outlined in Appendix C, and the final
solution can be expressed as
𝐴(𝑡) =

𝛼1 𝛼2
[exp(𝛼2 𝑡) − exp(𝛼2 𝑡1 + 𝜂(𝑡1 − 𝑡))] + 𝐴 1 exp(𝜂(𝑡1 − 𝑡))
𝜂+𝛼2

(6)

Where 𝑡1 is the time immediately before the first infected individuals show symptoms and are
hospitalized, and 𝐴1 is the initial value of symptomatic cases. The solution to equation (6) needs

an initial value, which can easily be expressed as 𝐴(𝑡) = 0 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑡 = 𝑡1 which yields 𝐴1 = 0.
Therefore, equation (6) can be rewritten as
𝐴(𝑡) =

𝛼1 𝛼2
[exp(𝛼2 𝑡) − exp((𝛼2 + 𝜂)𝑡1 )exp(−𝜂𝑡)]
𝜂+𝛼2

(7)

Equation (7) shows the distribution of the active cases, which can be rewritten as
𝐴(𝑡) = 𝛽1 exp(𝛼2 𝑡) − 𝛽2 exp(−𝛽3 𝑡)

(8)

Where 𝛼2 is constant that was already evaluated from the cumulative number of cases as 𝛼2 =
0.0923 and 𝛽1 , 𝛽2 and 𝛽3 are constants that can be expressed as
𝛽1 =

𝛼1 𝛼2
𝜂+𝛼2

9𝑎

𝛽2 =

𝛼1 𝛼2
exp((𝛼2 + 𝜂)𝑡1 )
𝜂+𝛼2

9𝑏

𝛽3 = 𝜂

9𝑐

Equation (8) shows that the number of active cases have to follow two competing exponential
distributions. The first exponential distribution (𝛽1 exp(𝛼2 𝑡)) is a measure of the number of
newly added cases while the second distribution (−𝛽2 exp(−𝛽3 𝑡)) is a measure of how many
active cases have been recovered by recovery or death.
The steps to evaluate 𝜂 and 𝑡1 , 𝛽1 , 𝛽2 and 𝛽3 starts by fitting equation (7) to the known number
of active cases from Table-A.2. The curve fit would yield 𝜂 and 𝑡1 , then using equations (9a -c)
we could evaluate 𝛽1 , 𝛽2 and 𝛽3.
Microsoft Excel solver 28 was used to fit equation (8) to the number of active cases from TableA2. The solver used generalized reduced gradient method 29 to find optimum values for the
parameters. The curve fit is shown in Figure 4, while the results for 𝜂 and 𝑡1 , were 𝜂 =
0.02073, thus, the recovery period can be obtained as 1/𝜂 = 48 days, and 𝑡1 = −3.3 days
which indicates that the first individuals started showing symptoms on May 21 st and from
Figure 1 we could notice that around May 21st is when the total number of symptomatic cases
started to increase after it was relatively unchanged for almost a month.

Equations (9a-c) are used to determine 𝛽1 , 𝛽2 and 𝛽3 as 62.339, 42.93 and 0.02073 respectively.
Equation (8) with the known parameters 𝛼1 , 𝛽1 , 𝛽2 and 𝛽3 can be used to predict the number of
active cases in the future. This number is really important to help health officials plan for the
people who would need hospitalization or quarantine in the foreseeable future. Figure 4 shows
the prediction vs. real data for 8 days in the future starting from June 4 th. Our prediction agrees
very well with the actual data.
The incubation period for the virus at the beginning of the pandemic can be defined as the
period between when the epidemic started (𝑡𝑜 ) and when the first case showed symptoms of
the disease (𝑡1 ). Or
1
= 𝑡1 − 𝑡𝑜
𝜐𝑜

(10)

Applying equation (10) we get the initial incubation period as 1⁄𝜈𝑜 = 15.2 days.
Number of unreported cases
The number of unreported cases can be estimated from equation (1d). Equation (1d) can be
rewritten in the form
𝑈̇(𝑡) + 𝜂𝑈(𝑡) = 𝐶̇ (𝑡)⁄𝑓 − 𝐶̇ (𝑡)

(11)

Substitute equation (2) and (1e) in equation (11) yields.
𝑈̇(𝑡) + 𝜂𝑈(𝑡) = 𝛼1 𝛼2 exp(𝛼2 𝑡)⁄𝑓 − 𝛼1 𝛼2 exp(𝛼2 𝑡)

(12)

Equation(12) is a linear differential equation of the first order in the form 𝑦̇ + 𝑎(𝑡)𝑦 = ℎ(𝑡)
where 𝑎(𝑡) = 𝜂 and ℎ(𝑡) = 𝛼1 𝛼2 exp(𝛼2 𝑡)⁄𝑓 − 𝛼1 𝛼2 exp(𝛼2 𝑡). This equation can also be
solved by using an integration factor 27 as shown in Appendix C. The final solution can be
expressed as
𝑈(𝑡) =

𝛼1 𝛼2 1
1
[( − 1) exp(𝛼2 𝑡) − ( − 1) exp(𝛼2 𝑡1 + 𝜂(𝑡1 − 𝑡))]
𝜂+𝛼2 𝑓

+ 𝑈1 exp(𝜂(𝑡1 − 𝑡))

Equation (13) describes the change in the number of unreported cases with time. The only
unknown in these equations are initial condition 𝑈1 , and the percentage of the cases that
become symptomatic 𝑓.
The initial value for the unreported cases can be safely assumed as 𝑈1 = 0. Thus, equation (13)
can be rewritten as
𝑈(𝑡) =

𝛼1 𝛼2 (1 − 𝑓)
[exp(𝛼2 𝑡) − exp(𝛼2 𝑡1 + 𝜂(𝑡1 − 𝑡))]
(𝜂+𝛼2 )𝑓

(14)

Again, we notice that there are two competing exponential terms in equation (14). The positive
exponential term which is a measure of how many pre-symptomatic infected people become
Asymptomatic and the negative exponential term which is a measure of how many
Asymptomatic people recovered.
Until now, there’s no reliable study that gives information about the percentage of
symptomatic cases from the total infected people, therefore, we could observe how the
number of unreported cases change at different values of 𝑓, as shown in Figure 5
Transmission rate and reproductive number
Now, let’s consider equation (1b). Equation (1b) is a nonlinear differential equation that
describes the change in pre-symptomatic cases. Using, equation (1e) and (2) we can show that
𝐼 ̇ = 𝛼2 𝐼, then we substitute into equation (1b) and rearrange to get
𝑆(𝑡) =

(𝛼2 + 𝜈)𝐼
𝜏(𝐼 + 𝑈)

(15)

Now, we can apply the initial conditions, which are at 𝑡𝑜 = 0, 𝑆 = 𝑆𝑜 , 𝐼 = 𝐼𝑜 and 𝑈 = 𝑈𝑜 = 0,
substitute for the initial conditions in equation (15) yields
𝜏=

𝛼2 + 𝜈𝑜
𝑆𝑜

(16)

Equation (16) can be used to calculate the transmission rate, where 𝑆𝑜 is number of susceptible
individuals at time 𝑡𝑜 . The COVID-19 virus affects everyone without discrimination, therefore in
this case, the number of susceptible people is the entire population of Libya. The Libyan

population is about 6.4 million, substituting for this number in equation (16) we get the
transmission rate as 𝜏 = 2.47 × 10−8 .
The reproductive number 𝑅𝑜 is the number of the secondary cases generated by the primary
cases at the start of the epidemic. It can be defined as the ratio between transmission rate per
day times the number of susceptible individuals to the recovery rate 3. Or
𝑅𝑜 =

𝜏 𝑆𝑜 𝛼2 + 𝜈𝑜
=
𝜂
𝜂

(17)

Using equation (17) we get the reproductive number as 𝑅𝑜 = 7 ⋅ 62.
DISCUSSION
This research paper is the first that uses a new mathematical approach in order to calculate the
parameters of the epidemiological model simply by finding a closed-form solution to the
differential equations of the model without assumption of any parameter. However, for this
approach to work, you need to have data that can easily be tracked which include the
cumulative number of cases and the active number of cases.
The starting time of epidemic is calculated to be on May 5th, however, the first case was
reported on March 24th. Indicating that the sudden increase in infectious cases was due to new
source. This could be explained by the fact that the Libyan government allowed many citizens
to return to the country starting from the beginning of May. The majority came from countries
where the disease was highly prevalent like Turkey, Spain, Italy and Saudi Arabia; and some of
them developed the disease shortly after arriving.
Our prediction of the cumulative number of symptomatic cases agrees very well with the actual
data in the first 6 days but it over-predicted the number of cases for days 7 and 8 as shown in
Figure 3. This could be attributed to the fact that the model parameters we found from the
curve fitting are the average values for the period we covered (May 24th-June 4th), and these
values usually change as people start taking more precautionary measures. Therefore, we
recommend that the prediction process be performed for only one week and should be

updated daily to account for any change in the model parameters due to the change in people’s
social activities.
An exact solution to the number of active cases can be found mathematically as shown in
equations (6-9). This solution was fitted to the data from Table-A.2, where we found that the
period to recovery was 48 days. Also, the incubation period was found as 15.2 days, which is
consistent with the available incubation period of the virus which is on average between 2-14
days and could reach up to 27 days 30. Please note, that 15.2 days are the incubation period at
the start of the epidemic and not the average incubation period. Our prediction for the number
of active cases is shown in Figure 4 agreeing very well with the actual data.
Similarly, an exact mathematical solution to the number of unknown cases can be obtained as
shown in equations (13) and (14). However, there is no reliable way to know the percentage of
infected people that become symptomatic (𝑓). Therefore, we can’t estimate the number of
unknown cases, but we could make an educated guess. Figure 5 shows the number of unknown
cases at different values of 𝑓. Assuming that 70% of the infected individual become
symptomatic cases (𝑓 = 0 ⋅ 7) then we expect the number of unreported cases to be around
157 individual by June/12 and this number increases to 366 individuals if 𝑓 = 0 ⋅ 5 and to 855
cases if 𝑓 = 0 ⋅ 3.
The reproductive number was determined as 7.62 which is alarmingly high, and higher than
that estimated in Wuhan, China before implementation of public health intervention
measures31. The reproductive number depends on the social activities and the average number
of people who became in contact with an infected person. Therefore, it is expected to vary
from country to country. In general, Libyan people have large families and are socially active.
The first cases were identified as people who returned home from abroad, and the customary
social norm is that the friends and extended family visit a person who returns from travel.
Therefore, we are expecting a large reproductive number at the early stages of the epidemic.
CONCLUSION:
With only the cumulative number of cases and the total number of active cases of COVID-19,
assuming that the growth of cumulative number of cases follow an exponential growth, several

important epidemic model parameters can be measured effectively. Even though this new
mathematical approach is used to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Libya; it has the capability
to be applied with any compartmental epidemic model of any infectious disease anywhere in
the world.
