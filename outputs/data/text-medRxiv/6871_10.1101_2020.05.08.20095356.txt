Highlights:
1. 61 most affected countries can be classified into four types: downward, upward,
static-phase and uncertain ones.
2. The 12 static-phase countries including US and UK are characterized by largely
constant numbers of daily new cases in the past over 14 days.

4. In static-phase countries, daily new cases (confirmed) are likely less than daily new

Abstract: The COVID-19 epidemics are differentially progressing in different countries.
Here, comparative analyses of daily new cases reveal that 61 most affected countries can
be classified into four types: downward (22), upward (20), static-phase (12) and uncertain
ones (7). In particular, the 12 static-phase countries including US and UK are
characterized by largely constant numbers of daily new cases in the past over 14 days.
Furthermore, these static-phase countries are overall significantly lower in testing density
but higher in the level of positive COVID-19 tests than downward countries. These
findings suggest that the testing capacity in static-phase countries is lagging behind the
spread of the outbreak, i.e., daily new cases (confirmed) are likely less than daily new
infections and the remaining undocumented infections are thus still expanding, resulting
in unstoppable epidemics. As such, increasing the testing capacity and/or reducing the
COVID-19 transmission are urgently needed to stop the severing crisis in static-phase
countries.

Introduction
The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) has become a pandemic and are
devastating more than 150 countries 1, 2. As of 23 April 2020, there have been over 2.5 million
confirmed COVID-19 cases and 180,000 deaths in the world 1. While China and South Korea
are close to successfully contain the COVID-19 epidemic by mass testing and implementing
comprehensive prevention measures 2, other countries are in battles of different stages against
the crisis. We previously forecasted that Italy and the United States were similar to Hubei,
China in the severity of the COVID-epidemic, and the US was even more severe than Italy 3.
Here we performed analyses on over 60 most affected countries to characterize the progress of
the epidemic in each country, which may help to get better preparedness and optimize responses
and efforts.

Methods
Data source
The data of daily new cases of each country were collected from Worldometer
(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Levels of daily positive COVID-19 tests in the two

most affected US states (New York and New Jersey) were collected from the website of the
COVID Tracking Project (https://covidtracking.com/api). The data of daily tests for US, Italy
and South Korea were collected from the Website of One World Data
) and Data for UK from
(
COVID-19 UK UPDATE (https://covid19uk.live/#/).
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand

Statistical analysis
Statistics were performed using Microcal Origin software with ANOVA algorithm, and
significance level was set at a P value of 0.05.

Results
Identification of static-phase countries with largely constant numbers of daily new cases
We collected the data of daily new cases of the most affected 61 countries (at least with over
1800 total confirmed cases as of 19 April 2020) from the website of Worldometer 1 and then
compared the trends of daily new cases among them. As summarized in Table 1, these 61
countries can be classified into four type, i.e., 22 downward, 20 upward, 12 static-phase and 7
uncertain countries, as described as follows. First, daily new COIVD-19 cases in the 22
downward countries appear to decline in the past over 14 days after passing peaks. These
countries include Spain, Italy, Germany and Iran (Fig. 1A), China and South Korea that have
successfully diminished the domestic spread of the virus (Fig. S1A), and many others (Figs.
S1B, S1C and S1D). Iceland, Japan and France somehow show declining trends (Figs. S1E and
S1F) but need more time to be verified. Second, there are 20 upward countries, in which daily
new cases are rapidly (Figs. 1A, S2A and S2B) or slowly (Figs. S2C) increasing over time. In
particular, Singapore had been believed to contain the epidemic successfully but recently
reports drastic increase in new cases (Fig. 1A). Third, daily new cases in the 6 uncertain
countries vary dramatically such that it is hard to determine the trends of their epidemics (Figs.
S3A and S3B); Turkey seems to stabilize in daily new cases in the past 7 days and needs more
time for judgement (Fig. S3C).
Strikingly, we found that 12 countries including US and UK entered into static states that are
characterized by largely constant numbers of daily new cases in the past over 14 days (as
indicated by dotted windows in Figs. 1C, 1D and S4A; for detail, refer to Table S1). It has been
reported that the incubation period of COVID-19 ranges from 1-14 days with a mean of 5-6
days 4, and therefore maintaining invariable daily new cases within a period of over 14 days is
unusual. Notably, such static-phase periods for US, UK, Belgium and Netherlands are even
more than 20 days (Figs. 1C and 1D; Table S1). In addition, Canada and Philippines are close
to such static states (Fig. S4B), with daily new cases of the former showing slightly increase in
the past four days and the latter being varying drastically. During revising and resubmitting the
manuscript, we closely monitored the newly released data, which suggest that most of the 12
static-phase countries are still constant in daily new cases as of May 3, 2020 (as shown in bold
style, Table 1; for detail, refer to Fig. S5).

Static-phase countries show significantly lower testing density but higher level of positive
COVID-19 tests than downward countries.
To unravel why these static-phase countries show invariably new case, we compared the four
types of countries with respect to case density, testing density and the level of positive
COVID-19 tests (for detail, refer to Table S2). Results indicate that the 12 static-phase countries
are overall comparable in the case density with the 22 downward countries (p=0.375; Fig. 2A),
but they are significantly lower in the testing density (p=0.016; Fig. 2B) and higher in the level
of positive COVID-19 tests (p=0.028; Fig. 2C) than the latter. Consistently, upward countries
are significantly lower in case density than downward countries (p=0.003; Fig. 2A). These
observations raise a possibility that testing capacity may limit the full identification of
COVID-19 infected persons in the static-phase countries where relative high levels of infections
have been already presented in the community (as indicated by the relatively high level of
positive COVID-19 tests; Fig. 2C).
US and UK have lower testing intensity but higher level of positive tests than South Korea
and Italy
To further verify the above possibility, we compared the daily testing density between typical
static-phase countries (US and UK) and downward countries (South Korea and Italy). Data
presented in Fig. 2D indicate both US and UK are lower than Italy in the testing density even if
the latter has significantly mitigated the outbreaks in the past month (Fig. 1A) while the former
two are still expecting the appearance of epidemic peaks. Notably, testing density in South
Korea has declined since April but is still comparable with that in UK (Fig. 2D), although South
Korea has approached to the ending stage in the outbreak (Fig. S1A). These observations
suggest that both US and UK have not yet performed sufficient testing to identify the infected
COVID-19 cases in comparison with what Italy and South Korea have done regardless of their
epidemic status.
More severely, US and UK have surpassed Italy in the level of positive COVID-19 tests since
late March, and in the US the level of positive tests has been close to the ever highest peak in
Italy (up to 30%) occurring in mid-March and in UK it is even much higher than the latter (up
to 50%; Fig. 2E). In particular, the levels of positive tests in New York and New Jersey states,
the epicenter of the outbreaks in the US, are even up to 40% and 50%, respectively (Fig. S6).
These observations implicate that infection levels in the populations of US and UK would be, if
not higher, comparable with the highest level of Italy throughout its epidemic. Consistently, the
level of positive tests in South Korea is as lower as below 5%, presumably due to the limited
spread of the virus in the community and/or mass testing.

Discussion
In summary, we surprisingly found that among the 61 most affected countries 12 have been in a
unique static-phase state with highest throughout the epidemic course but largely invariable
daily new cases in the past over 14 days. The infection levels among the populations of these
static-phase countries are even higher than the downward countries (Fig. 2C), and the absolute
testing densities in certain static-phase countries including the US, Belgium, Canada and
Netherlands are even higher than some of the downward countries (e.g., Malaysia and Greece)
(refer to Table S2). It follows that invariable daily new cases in static-phase countries should be
conceivably resulted from relative insufficient testing in the context of a large pool of
undocumented or unidentified infected cases, which is supported by recent antibody screening
in New York 5. Along this logic, daily new (confirmed) cases are most likely less than daily new

infections in these static-phase countries. As such, the undocumented or unidentified infected
cases would increase over time, which further accelerates the spread of the virus and eventually
leads to unstoppable epidemics until the virus has spread to the whole populations.
Accordingly, expand of the testing capacity and interruption of transmissions by quarantine
measures are critical for containing the COVID-19 outbreaks because the former increases daily
new cases and the latter decreases daily new infections. If the current testing density is
insufficient regarding the large infection pool among the populations, it is expected that the
daily new cases will be proportionally increased if the testing capacity in static-phase countries
can be expanded. In this way, more infected persons would be identified and subsequently
isolated and quarantined, which would further reduce the spread of the virus among populations
and thus decrease total undocumented or unidentified infections. On the other hand, daily new
infections are proportional to total active infections and the secondary attack rate that could only
be reduced by quarantine measures 6. What China 4, 7, Italy 6 and Germany 8 have done for
fighting against COVID-19 in these aspects may inform static-phase countries to optimize
efforts.

Of the 12 static-phase countries as judged by the data as of April 19, 2020, newly released data as of
May 3, 2020 (Fig. S5) suggest that i) daily new cases in some countries (shown in bold; e.g., US and UK)
are still constant; ii) Canada and Philippines that were previously close to static-phase are now
confirmed to be in static-phase; iii) Belgium and Netherlands show some tendency to decline in daily
new cases while Chile shows sudden increase in the past few days.
