Abstract
Background
There is urgent need for safe and efficient triage protocols for hospitalized COVID-19
suspects to appropriate isolation wards. A major barrier to timely discharge of patients from
the emergency room and hospital is the turnaround time for many SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid
tests. We validated a point of care nucleic acid amplification based platform SAMBA II for
diagnosis of COVID-19 and performed an implementation study to assess its impact on
patient disposition at a major academic hospital.
Methods
We prospectively recruited COVID-19 suspects admitted to hospital (NCT04326387). In an
initial pilot phase, individuals were tested using a nasal/throat swab with the SAMBA II
SARS-CoV-2 rapid diagnostic platform in parallel with a combined nasal/throat swab for
standard central laboratory RT-PCR testing. In the second implementation phase, we
examined the utility of adding the SAMBA platform to routine care. In the pilot phase, we
measured concordance and assay validity using the central laboratory as the reference
standard and assessed assay turnaround time. In the implementation phase, we assessed 1)
time to definitive bed placement from admission, 2) time spent on COVID-19 holding wards,

3) proportion of patients in isolation versus COVID negative areas following a test,
comparing the implementation phase with the 10 days prior to implementation.
Results
In phase I, 149 participants were included in the pilot. By central laboratory RT-PCR testing,
32 (21.5%) tested positive and 117 (78.5%). Sensitivity and specificity of the SAMBA assay
compared to RT-PCR lab test were 96.9% (95% CI 0.838-0.999) and 99.1% (0.953-0.999),
respectively. Median time to result was 2.6 hours (IQR 2.3 to 4.8) for SAMBA II SARSCoV-2 test and 26.4 hours (IQR 21.4 to 31.4) for the standard lab RT-PCR test (p<0.001). In
the first 10 days of the SAMBA implementation phase, we conducted 992 tests, with the
majority (59.8%) used for hospital admission, and the remainder for pre-operative screening
(11.3%), discharge planning (10%), in-hospital screening of new symptoms (9.7%).
Comparing the pre-implementation (n=599) with the implementation phase, median time to
definitive bed placement from admission was reduced from 23.4 hours (8.6-41.9) to 17.1
hours (9.0-28.8), P=0.02 in Cox analysis, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities and clinical
severity at presentation. Mean length of stay on a COVID-19 ‘holding’ ward decreased from
58.5 hours to 29.9 hours (P<0.001). Use of single occupancy rooms amongst those tested fell
from 30.8% before to 21.2% (P=0.03) and 11 hospital bay closures (on average 6 beds each)
were avoided after implementation of the POC assay.
Conclusions
The SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 rapid assay performed well compared to a centralized
laboratory RT-PCR platform and demonstrated shorter time to result both in trial and realworld settings. It was also associated with faster time to definitive bed placement from the
emergency room, greater availability of isolation rooms, avoidance of hospital bay closures,
and greater movement of patients to COVID negative open “green” category wards. Rapid
testing in hospitals has the potential to transform ability to deal with the COVID-19
epidemic.

Introduction
As of June 1st 2020 there were over 400, 000 deaths worldwide and 40,000 deaths in the UK
attributed to COVID-191. Current clinical testing for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and
infection risk relies on nucleic acid detection using reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) on nose/throat swabs2,3. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are detectable in
only approximately 50% of infected people by day 5-7 after symptom onset,4 and are
therefore not suitable as a test for early stages of infection, although they may add value in
the second phase of illness when virus detection wanes in upper respiratory tract samples3,5.
Nucleic acid testing usually requires central laboratory testing with concomitant delays, and
turnaround times are usually in excess of 24 hours, and often days6.
Due to diverse presentations of COVID-197, lack of a timely diagnosis can have serious
consequences, including deadly nosocomial outbreaks8,9. Moreover, identifying and isolating
patients appropriately as suspects or cases is critical for hospital flow and resource allocation.
Misclassifying cases as non-cases puts patients and healthcare providers at risk. Conversely,
misclassifying patients without disease as suspects increases use of scarce personal protective
equipment and isolation wards. Therefore, screening hospital admissions rapidly is critical to
manage patient flow and limit potential for nosocomial transmission10,11. In the absence of a
reliable rapid assay, hospitals have resorted to creating bespoke care pathways to use
isolation rooms most effectively for COVID-19 suspects without a confirmed diagnosis12.
Finally, given care home outbreaks, there is also urgent need to rapidly demonstrate COVID19 status on discharge planning13. This need for rapid and safe patient movement is likely to
increase sharply in late 2020 when norovirus and influenza (with or without SARS-CoV-214)
will likely compound pressure on hospitals and isolation capacity in particular. Such an
approach would also relieve pressure on hospital virology laboratories so they can resume
routine testing.

One potential solution to facilitating rapid patient triage and room allocation is to improve
efficiency of COVID-19 testing. A number of near patient tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been
described. Some have not performed well15, and none have undergone testing under rigorous
clinical trial conditions with ‘real world’ data on impact on patient managment16-20.
Thorough, prospective evaluation for a high consequence pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 is
particularly important given risks related to false positives or negatives in the hospital setting.

SAMBA (simple amplification based assay), an isothermal amplification based platform, has
been extensively field tested for HIV diagnostic applications in low resource settings21,22, and
has been adapted for use in SARS-CoV-2 with successful pre-clinical testing using synthetic
standards and stored positive and negative clinical samples23. Here we present a prospective
clinical validation study comparing SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 performance against the
standard laboratory RT-PCR test in suspected COVID-19 cases presenting to hospital,
followed by analysis of POC implementation in hospital.

Methods
Assay validation study
The COVIDx Study was a prospective, comparative, real world assessment of SAMBA II
SARS-CoV-2 point of care testing compared to the standard laboratory RT-PCR testing in
participants admitted to Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH) with
a possible diagnosis of COVID-19 (NCT04326387) . CUH is a 1200-bed hospital providing
secondary care to a population of 580,000 people in Cambridge and the surrounding area, as
well as tertiary referral services to the East of England.

Validation Phase Participants
For the Phase I assay validation period, recruitment started two weeks into the national
lockdown implemented by the UK government in response to the pandemic. Eligible
consecutive participants were recruited during 12-hour day shifts over a duration of 4 weeks
from the 6th of April 2020 to the 2nd of May 2020. We recruited adults (>16 years old)
presenting to the emergency department or acute medical assessment unit and designated as
COVID-19 suspects. This included participants who met the Public Heath England (PHE)
definition of a possible COVID-19 case (see supplemental methods). The inclusion criteria
were later expanded to include any adult requiring hospital admission and who was
symptomatic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, demonstrated by clinical or radiological findings.
This was done due to the changing landscape of the COVID-19 epidemic and emergence of
new symptoms such as anosmia and diarrhoea. Exclusion criteria included not having the
standard lab RT-PCR test applied within an 18-hour window of SAMBA SARS-CoV-2 test
and those unwilling or unable to comply with study swabbing procedures.

Assay methods
Participants in the assay validation phase underwent testing with SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2
using a combined nasal/throat swab within 18 hours of a similar assay for the standard
laboratory RT-PCR test. The index test is the SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 Test, a nucleic acid
amplification test (NAAT) which uses nucleic acid sequence based amplification to detect
SARS-CoV-2 RNA from throat and nose swab specimens collected by dry sterile swab and
inactivated in a proprietary inactivation buffer prior to analyses. This obviates the need for a
BSL3 laboratory for specimen handling or viral extraction. The SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2
targets 2 genes- Orf1 and the E genes. The limit of detection (LoD) of the SAMBA II SARSCoV-2 Test is published as 250 copies/mL23. The reference test is an in-house RT- PCR test
developed in the public health England (PHE) laboratory at CUH with similar LOD.

Indeterminate SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 tests were repeated with a 1:2 dilution of sample to
inactivation buffer according to manufacturer standard operating procedures until a valid
result was obtained. Indeterminate standard lab RT-PCR tests were repeated on a replicate
nose/throat swab until a valid result was obtained. The results of the SAMBA II SARS-CoV2 was not known to the assessors of the standard lab RT-PCR prior.

Demographic and clinical data were obtained at presentation from the hospital’s electronic
patient records (EPIC) and entered into anonymised case report forms on the MACRO
electronic database. Biological specimens from a combined nose and throat swab were
collected and stored by research nurses. Results of the SAMBA assay were not made
available to clinical teams during the pilot validation study. The primary outcome measures
were time to result, concordance with the standard lab RT-PCR test and sensitivity/specificity
of the SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 test compared to the central laboratory RT-PCR assay.

Validation Study Sample Size and Analysis
We assumed a target sensitivity of 0.95 and disease prevalence of 15%. Using a 5%
significance level and allowing for a precision of +/- 5% gave a required sample size of 122.
Participants with missing SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 or standard lab RT-PCR tests result were
excluded from the analyses. Descriptive analyses of clinical and demographic data are
presented as median and interquartile range (IQR) when continuous and as frequency and
proportion (%) when categorical. The difference in continuous and categorical data were
tested using Wilcoxon rank sum and Chi-square test respectively. Agreement between the

two tests was assessed using Cohen's kappa, a correlation-like measure which accounts for
agreement by chance alone, in which case κ = 0, while κ = 1 and κ = -1 correspond to perfect
agreement and completely discordant pairs respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of
SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 test were compared using the standard laboratory RT-PCR test as a
gold standard. Exact Clopper-Pearson 95% confidence intervals were calculated due to
estimates being near 1. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was used to compare time to result for
the two tests, with log rank testing. Analysis was done using R and STATA version 13.

Clinical Implementation Study
Following the completion of the COVIDx validation study (May 1st 2020) and demonstration
of performance similar to the reference standard test, the hospital switched from standard lab
RT-PCR testing to use of SAMBA II for in-hospital testing due to its shorter turnaround time.
Twenty SAMBA II machines were operationalised by the CUH POC testing team, each
machine capable of performing around 10-15 tests per day. To evaluate the real-world impact
of SAMBA on clinical care, we retrospectively gathered data on clinically relevant endpoints
from electronic patient records over a ten-day period before and after introduction of the
SAMBA test for all patients who underwent COVID-19 testing.

All patients who underwent COVID-19 testing in a 10-day period before and after
introduction of the SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 test were included. Participants were identified
from testing reports from the EPIC electronic hospital records system. Clinical and hospital
activity data were obtained from the same source.

The primary study outcomes for the implementation study was the median time from
admission to definitive bed placement comparing SAMBA assay period with the preimplementation period. Secondary outcomes were time spent on COVID-19 holding wards,
bay closures avoided, proportions of patients in isolation rooms following test, proportions of
patients able to be moved to COVID negative open wards following test, and finally whether
the test was deemed to have a beneficial impact.

Descriptive analyses of clinical and demographic data are presented as median (IQR) when
continuous and frequency (%) when categorical. Difference in continuous variables between
the pre and post implementation groups were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum tests and
difference in categories and proportion were assessed using the Chi-square test or test of

proportions. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was used to compare time to definitive bed
placement from admission for the two periods, with log rank testing. We fitted Cox
proportional hazards models to determine the hazard of placement, after adjustment for age
sex, morbidity (defined by a number of scoring systems including quick sequential organ
failure assessment score (qSOFA), national early warning score 2 (NEWS2), and Charlson
Comorbidity Index (CCI)). In the final multivariable model, estimates of the HRs were
determined by including those factors with evidence of an association in the univariable
analysis with a P-value of < 0.1. Although sex was not significantly associated with time to
definitive bed placement in the univariable analysis, it was kept in the final model as it was
an a priori specified confounder. Analyses was done using STATA version 13.

Ethical approval
The protocol was approved by the East of England - Essex Research Ethics Committee. HRA
and Health and Care Research Wales (HCRW) approval was received. Verbal informed
consent was obtained from all participants or in the case of participants without capacity,
from a consultant nominee who was involved in their clinical care but independent from the
research team (see supplemental). COVIDx was registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier NCT04326387. The implementation study was registered as a service evaluation
with Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

Patients or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or
dissemination plans of our research. There are no plans to directly feedback the results to
participants.

Results
Validation of SAMBI II SARS-CoV-2 Assay
Of 178 screened patients, 149 met eligibility criteria for inclusion in the clinical trial (Figure
1). Mean age was 62.7 years and 47% were male. 32/149 (21.6%) tested positive by the
standard lab RT-PCR test. Mean temperature and respiratory rate were higher in the standard
lab RT-PCR positive group (Figure 1). Median duration of symptoms was 3 (IQR 1.75-10.5)
and 4 (IQR 2-13) days in standard lab RT-PCR positive and negative participants
respectively. There were seven discrepant results between the POC and laboratory assays
(7/149) after initial testing (see supplementary methods). Discrepancy analysis concluded that

there was one false negative by the POC test, likely related to sampling variation, and no
false positives. Cohen's kappa correlation between the two tests was 0.96, 95% CI (0.91,
1.00). Sensitivity of SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 test as compared to the standard lab RT-PCR
was 96.9% (95% CI 83.8-99.9), with specificity of 99.1% (95.3-99.9), Figure 2. However,
since the standard lab RT-PCR had one false negative in a participant with clinical and
radiological evidence of disease, the sensitivity and specificity of SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2
test was effectively 97.0% (95% CI 84.2-99.9) and 100% (95% CI 96.9-100) respectively.
POC testing was associated with shorter time from sampling to result (Figure 2); median time
to result was 2.6 hours (IQR 2.3 to 4.8) for POC testing and 26.4 hours (IQR 21.4 to 31.4) for
the standard lab RT-PCR test (p<0.001).

SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 Assay Implementation Study
992 SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed between May 2nd and May 11th inclusive
in 913 individuals. The assay was used for the following indications: 59.8% of tests were
used for newly hospitalised patients, and the remainder were done for pre-operative screening
(11.3%), discharges to nursing homes (10.0%), in-hospital screening of new symptoms
(9.7%), screening in asymptomatic patients requiring hospital admission screening (3.8%)
and access to interventions such as dialysis and chemotherapy for high risk patients (1.2%)
(Table 1). During the implementation phase, median time to result was 3.6 hours (IQR 2.6 to
5.8h). The result from the SAMBA assay was deemed to have a beneficial clinical impact in
77.4% of patients who had the test. (Table 1).

Emergency admissions
Rapid SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 testing was deemed beneficial in 436 (75.8%) tests
performed at presentation to ED or the acute admission ward. In the 24.2% where no clinical
benefit was derived the reasons for this were: patients being discharged home from ED prior
to the result becoming available; patients being triaged and moved to a ward before the
results were available; and, in cases of a high clinical index of suspicion of COVID-19, a
negative result did not change the initial risk assessment, isolation or clinical management.

Pre-operative testing
110 (11.3%) tests were performed prior to surgical procedures, partly for infection control
purposes, but mainly to screen patients in light of data demonstrating increased peri-operative
mortality associated with COVID-1924. POC tests were deemed to have resulted in clinical

benefit attributable to the rapid result (Table 3) in 106/110 (96.3%) instances. SAMBA II
SARS-CoV-2 testing facilitated surgical interventions including exploratory laparotomy, eye
and maxillofacial surgery, solid organ transplants and caesarean sections.

Discharge to care home or with a care package
Nursing homes came to be recognised as “hotspots” for COVID-19 transmission and at the
end of April 2020 national policy mandated a SARS-CoV-2 swab less than 48 hours before
discharge to a nursing home or a setting where an individual was visited by carers. SAMBA
II SARS-CoV-2 testing was successfully used to facilitate discharge in 76/96 (79.2%)
instances. In the remaining 20.8%, alternative reasons were identified in the discharge
pathway that resulted in delays that required another test to meet the hospital’s discharge
policy.

Prevention of Health Care Associated Infection
94 patients had a SAMBA II POC test carried out for the purpose of in-hospital triage and
placement. 81 of these had sufficient data to determine the impact of SAMBA II SARS-CoV2 test. The test was beneficial in 55.6% (45/81), allowing the patient to remain in a low risk
open ward in 68.9% (31/45) instances, movement out of a side room in 17.8% (8/45) and
avoiding bay closures in 13.3% (6/45). In the remaining 44.4% (36/81) of instances in which
no beneficial impact was found, 7 of these had a previous recent test result of which 2 were
known positive, and a SAMBA positive result had no further impact. In 4 instances, the
patient had been moved prior to the result returning as clinical suspicion of COVID-19 was
high leading to triage prior to the result being known, in 8, there was no documented
indication and in the rest SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 testing did not alter management.

POC testing with negative results allowed a significant increase in the number of patients
able to move to ‘green’ non-COVID-19 areas [green status (478/966) 49.5% prior to test and
(600/756) 79.4% afterwards, p<0.001]. The numbers in ‘amber’ areas (possible COVID-19)
fell reciprocally (Figure 3A) [40% on amber prior to test and 11.6% after, p<0.001], thereby
allowing quicker access to potentially life-saving procedures such as CT Angiography or
cardiac monitoring (Supplementary material). We observed a concomitant fall in use of
single occupancy rooms amongst those tested for new in-hospital COVID-19 symptoms from
30.8% before to 21.2% (p=0.03) after the POC test result (Figure 3B). Eleven bay closures
were prevented with POC testing overall, with each bay having an average of six beds.

Next we compared clinical outcomes the 10 days prior to and following SAMBA II SARSCoV-2 introduction. Duplicate tests in the same admission episode were excluded. We
identified 561 tests in 388 individuals tested using the standard laboratory RT-PCR in the 10
days prior to SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 introduction, and compared them with 913 tests done
in 799 individuals using the POC test in the 10 days post- SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2
introduction. Demographic characteristics of both groups were similar. Clinical factors were
different which reflects the timeline of the pandemic; the proportion of positive tests,
mortality and presumed risk of COVID-19 was lower in the post implementation period,
(Table 2). Time from sample to test result fell dramatically [35.9 hours (23.8-48.9) to 3.8
hours (2.7-6.0), p<0.0001, Figure 4 shows Kaplan-Meier analysis]. Time to definitive ward
move from ED also decreased significantly after SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 introduction [23.4
hours (8.6-41.9) to 17.1 hours (9.0-28.8), p=0.02, Figure 4 shows Kaplan-Meier analysis].
The Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that even after mutually adjusting for
age, sex, quick sequential organ failure assessment score (qSOFA), national early warning
score 2 (NEWS2), and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 test
was independently associated with the shorter time to definitive bed placement from
admission [HR 1.25 (95% CI 1.02-1.53), p=0.03). Other significant associations were
younger age and NEWS2 medium risk score. (Table 3). Finally, mean length of stay on a
COVID-19 result wait/holding ward decreased from 58.5 hours to 29.9 hours (p<0.001)
compared to the 10 days prior to implementation.

Discussion
Here we report the an assessment of the validity and impact of rapid molecular SARS-CoV-2
testing for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in a high-need hospital setting. These data
demonstrate that rapid antigen testing can be reliable, accurate and provide clinicians and
infection control staff with much quicker results compared to current centralized gold
standard assays. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the routine use of this test had a realworld impact on patient triage and hospital bed resource allocation.

The SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test was compared to a reference RT-PCR test the standard of care, using combined nasal/throat swabs from participants attending hospital
with a possible diagnosis of COVID-19. Study participants were representative of UK
COVID-19 patients25, and we found that concordance between the tests was extremely high

with Cohen kappa coefficient 0.96. When the standard lab RT-PCR test was referenced as a
‘gold standard’, sensitivity of SAMBA was 96.9% and sensitivity 100%. In the validation
stage, median time from swab to result was 2.6 hours for SAMBA II as compared with 26.4
hours for RT-PCR (p<0.001). Importantly, we did identify a single case which was deemed
to be a false negative, in comparison to the centralized laboratory assay. However, this
patient had both clinical and radiographic findings consistent with COVID-19 disease.
Nonetheless, our findings to highlight the importance of COVID-19 triage protocols, which
allow for retention of a COVID-19 suspect status, despite a negative nucleic acid test result,
in cases with otherwise high pre-test probability of disease26.

Patient placement during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a major challenge and has
significantly impacted the ability to maintain patient flow and safety in hospital27. These data
on rapid PCR testing offer one strategy to help address these issues. Our hospital switched
from standard lab RT-PCR testing to SAMBA II for in-hospital testing immediately
following the end of the validation study, providing an opportunity to prospectively evaluate
almost 1000 tests performed over ten consecutive days. Most tests were performed on new
admissions to hospital and replicated the large reduction in test turnaround time observed in
the clinical validation trial. POC was also used to investigate newly symptomatic patients in
hospital to rationalise our limited isolation rooms, and also to rapidly identify new COVID19 cases with appropriate infection control and prevention of nosocomial outbreaks11.
Inappropriate isolation is a large drain on staff and resources due to the need for repeated
deep cleaning, additional PPE utilisation and the distress and risk to patients from repeated
bed moves28. When we performed implementation impact analysis using ten day windows
either side of hospital-wide assay implementation, we found that time to definitive ward
move from ED decreased significantly after SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 introduction, and
length of stay on the main holding ward where test results were awaited also fell
significantly, consistent with more rapid and accurate patient movement. Similarly, we
observed a significant increase in the availability of isolation and single occupancy rooms
following POC introduction, and also patients testing negative were able to be placed in low
risk areas of the hospital and have interventions/procedures expedited. Finally, we found that
11 ward closures were prevented in the ten-day post implementation phase by having
negative tests in symptomatic hospital patients. Closed surgical bays in particular can result
in cancellations of operations, as well as significant financial losses to hospitals. Following

this analysis, hospital guidelines will be adapted to recommend waiting for SAMBA test
results before moving patients into isolation or closing bays.

SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 test is being implemented in a very limited number of hospitals, but
there is urgent need for similar capacity in care homes, prisons and possibly other
establishments. A rapid POC platform also has the potential to reduce disparities between
secondary and tertiary medical centres that have specialised virology laboratories, and ensure
equitable access to timely SARS-CoV-2 testing results. SAMBA II machines are already in
use in Uganda, Zimbabwe and Kenya for HIV testing and monitoring. If scale up can be
achieved in those settings, rapid testing could be vital for controlling COVID-19 in subSaharan Africa8 and our data will inform their optimal use29.

Limitations
The assay validation component was limited by the fact that the same swab could not be
tested on the two platforms being compared. This raised an issue of two separate samples
being tested on the two assays. Nonetheless, we identified only 2 cases where the sampling
explained discrepant results. In addition, the SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 test is not able to give
viral load or cycle threshold values for more nuanced analysis. Results of the validation can
be generalized to hospitalized suspects of COVID-19 with symptom of disease, but we did
not assay validity in asymptomatic or outpatients with mild symptoms. Similarly, our results
included dual swabs of the oral and naso-pharynx and should be interpreted with those
methods mind.

The implementation study was a non-randomized, controlled pre-post intervention design,
and thus the effects seen cannot be fully causally attribute to the implementation of the assay.
However, our findings are plausible, consistent across multiple measures, and process
measures (e.g. turnaround time) are supportive of the more downstream measures assessed.
Moreover, for our primary outcome, we conducted multivariable adjustment including
clinical and demographic indicators, which demonstrated a persistent benefit in hazard of
time to emergency room discharge. Moreoever, the implementation phase took place six
weeks into the UK lockdown, at a time when the rate of new infections had reduced
substantially across the country. Nonetheless, the study highlights the importance of rapid
test results in the COVID-19 era, regardless of the outcome of the test results.

Finally, our study did not estimate costs of the cost effectiveness of the implementation
strategy. The utilisation of rapid assays in acute settings for other respiratory viruses has been
shown to be cost effective30. Given the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19,
as well as the disruption that this pandemic has placed on healthcare provision, we anticipate
future assessments of the cost implications of SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 implementation in
regards to delayed discharge, nosocomial transmission and unnecessary use of personal
protective equipment

In summary, our data suggest that implementation of rapid testing for SARS-CoV-2 could
have a critical impact on hospital management of suspected COVID-19 cases. Future studies
should assess the long-term implications, resources, and clinical efficiency of rapid assay
implementation, particularly in the context of influenza and norovirus seasons.
