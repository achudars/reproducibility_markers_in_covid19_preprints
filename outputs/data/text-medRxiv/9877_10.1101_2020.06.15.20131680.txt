Abstract

Background:

We developed two unique machine learning (ML) models that predict risk of: 1) a major COVID-19
outbreak in the service county of a local HD population within following week, and 2) a hemodialysis
(HD) patient having an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection that is identified after following 3 or more days.

Methods:

We used county-level data from United States population (March 2020) and HD patient data from a
network of clinics (February-May 2020) to develop two ML models. First was a county-level model that
used data from general and HD populations (21 variables); outcome of a COVID-19 outbreak in a dialysis
service area was defined as a clinic being located in one of the national counties with the highest growth
in COVID-19 positive cases (number and people per million (ppm)) in general population during 22-28
Mar 2020. Second was a patient-level model that used HD patient data (82 variables) to predict an
individual having an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection that is identified in subsequent ≥3 days.

Results:

Among 1682 counties with dialysis clinics, 82 (4.9%) had a COVID-19 outbreak during 22-28 Mar 2020.
Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for the county-level model was 0.86 in
testing dataset. Top predictor of a county experiencing an outbreak was the COVID-19 positive ppm in
the general population in the prior week. In a select group (n=11,664) used to build the patient-level
model, 28% of patients had COVID-19; prevalence was by design 10% in the testing dataset. AUROC for
the patient-level model was 0.71 in the testing dataset. Top predictor of an HD patient having a SARSCoV-2 infection was mean pre-HD body temperature in the prior week.

Introduction:

The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging the world’s healthcare systems,
including bringing complexities to maintenance of dialysis in people with end stage kidney disease
(ESKD) (1-5). In the United States, most ESKD patients are treated by outpatient hemodialysis (HD)
where social distancing can be difficult and heightened infection control measures are required (e.g.
temperature screenings, double-masking, isolation treatments/shifts/clinics) (1-5). ESKD patients are
typically older and have multiple comorbidities, placing the population at higher risks for requiring
intensive care and dying if affected by COVID-19 (6-12).

Early reports from the United States show an 11% COVID-19 mortality in ESKD (13), which is higher than
the 3.2% COVID-19 mortality in the national population (14). This is not unexpected with reports from
China and Europe suggesting a 16% and 23% COVID-19 mortality in ESKD (15, 16). Albeit the high
mortality rate, an impaired immune response may render dialysis patients more frequently
asymptomatic when infected by SARS-CoV-2 (15, 16). In both the general and EKSD populations, the
most prevalent symptoms of COVID-19 at presentation are fever (11%-66% dialysis & 82% general
population) and cough (57% dialysis & 62% general population) (15, 17, 18). The less frequent
occurrence of signs and symptoms indicative of COVID-19 in dialysis patients could be making the
outbreak even more challenging to manage.

Dialysis providers routinely capture patient/clinical data during care. The robust data collected during
HD treatments (generally thrice weekly) provide unique opportunities to leverage artificial intelligence
(AI) in predicting COVID-19 outcomes. AI modeling helped identify onset of the outbreak in China (19,
20) and is currently being used to help with early detection of areas/individuals in the general
population at risk of being affected by COVID-19 (21-23).

As part of an healthcare operations effort in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, an integrated kidney
disease healthcare company aimed to develop two unique machine learning (ML) prediction models
that identify risk of: 1) a major COVID-19 outbreak in a dialysis service county, and 2) a HD patient
having an undetected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We
analyzed the performance of these models to determine their possible utility for testing in the HD
population.

Materials and Methods:

General:

An integrated kidney disease healthcare company (Fresenius Medical Care, Waltham, MA, United
States) used COVID-19 data on the general United States population and HD patient data from a
national network of dialysis clinics (Fresenius Kidney Care, Waltham, MA, United States) to develop two
unique ML models that predict risk of: 1) a major COVID-19 outbreak in the county of dialysis clinic(s)
servicing a local HD population in the following week (7 days), and 2) an adult HD patient having an
undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection that is identified after the following ≥3 days.

This analysis was performed in adherence with the Declaration of Helsinki under a protocol reviewed by
New England Independent Review Board (NEIRB). This retrospective analysis was determined to be
exempt and did not require consent (Needham Heights, MA, United States; NEIRB#1-17-1302368-1).

For construction of a model to predict a major COVID-19 outbreak in the county for a local HD
population, we obtained data on daily COVID-19 positive (COVID-19+) cases in each United States
county during 14-28 Mar 2020 from The New York Times COVID-19 dataset (The New York Times
Company, New York City, United States) (24). We also captured data on the total United States county
population (25). We used retrospective county-level data from local HD populations at the national
network of clinics from 08-28 Mar 2020.

We used data from all counties with ≥1 dialysis clinic and >5 HD patients. The outcome of a major
COVID-19 outbreak in a dialysis service area (county) was defined was defined by a clinic being located
in one of the top 300 national counties that had a combination of the highest (a) growth rate in COVID19+ cases (number and people per million (ppm)) in the general population, and (b) highest number of
COVID-19+ cases ppm in the last week of the observation period (22-28 Mar 2020).

Patient Population and SARS-CoV-2 Infection:

For the construction of a model to predict individuals with an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection, we
considered data from adult (age ≥18 years) HD patients treated in the national network. Positive arm
included data from patients who had ≥1 laboratory (rRT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19+ test as of the end of
the observation period (27 Feb 2020 through 04 May 2020). Negative arm included data from patients
who: 1) resided in counties with no reported COVID-19 cases as of 12 April 2020, and/or 2) had been
laboratory tested and were found COVID-19 negative.

We defined the index date of a HD patient having a SARS-CoV-2 infection as the date of the first
recorded suspicion that led to a COVID-19+ test, or the date of the COVID-19+ test in patients without
an earlier recorded suspicion. In control patients with a negative COVID-19 test result, the test date was
used as the index date. In controls without a test (patients living in counties with no reported cases), the

index date was randomly sampled from the positive cases’ index dates occurring before 30 March 2020.
This cutoff was chosen to minimize the possibility that control patients were infected but not tested (or
reported) until after the date defining negative counties of 12 April 2020. We included data from
patients with 1) ≥1 laboratory (of any kind) collected both 1-14 days and 31-60 days before the
individual’s prediction date (3 days prior to index date, further defined below), and 2) ≥1 HD treatment
both 1-7 days and 31-60 days preceding the prediction date. We excluded data from patients suspected
to have COVID-19 and/or pending laboratory testing.

AI Model Development:

Software:

We used Python version 3.7.7 (Python Software Foundation, Delaware, United States) to build two ML
models utilizing the XGBoost package (26).

County-Level COVID-19 Outbreak Prediction Model:

In the county-level model, we considered county-wide data in the general population for 4 variables and
county-wide data on each local HD population based on the county of the dialysis clinic(s) for 17 a priori
selected variables detailed in Table 1 and Figure 1A. The ML model was trained, validated, and tested
using a random 60:20:20% split of the dataset.

Patient-Level SARS-CoV-2 Infection Prediction Model:

In the patient-level model, we used 82 a priori selected treatment/laboratory variables (Tables 3 and 4;
Figure 1B) up to the individually defined prediction date (3 days prior to the index date defined above)
to predict the risk of a SARS-CoV-2 infection being identified in the following ≥3 days. This is intended to

yield individual predictions at least 3 days in advance of symptoms that warranted testing. We used a
60:20:20% randomized split of COVID-19+ samples for the training, validation, and testing datasets, and
added the same number of COVID-19 negative patients to only the training and validation datasets. The
testing dataset used to evaluate final model performance had a higher number of COVID-19 negative
samples added to more closely match the prevalence observed in the overall national HD population.

Statistical Methods:

Descriptive Statistics:

Descriptive statistics were tabulated for demographics and variables before the predicted COVID-19
outbreak in a county or HD patient SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Analysis of ML Model Feature Importance:

Shapley values (27, 28) were calculated using the SHAP python package to determine the influence of
each variable on model predictions (29, 30). SHAP value is calculated for each variable and each
observation, representing a measure of impact (positive or negative) of the observed value’s
contribution to each individual prediction. Overall feature importances for each model were calculated
using the mean absolute values for each variable across all measures.

Analysis of ML Model Performance:

Performance of ML models was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUROC) in the training, validation, and testing datasets, as well as, the recall, precision, and lift in the
testing datasets (Refer to Supplementary Methods for further details). AUROC, recall, and precision
metrics yield scores on a scale of 0 (lowest) to 1 (highest). Lift metric yields an estimate of how many

times more/less effective the model is at predicting the outcome versus not using a model. Cutoff
thresholds for classifying predictions were selected to optimize recall, precision, and lift.

Results:

Prediction of Counties with a COVID-19 Outbreak:

County Characteristics:

Among all counties with dialysis clinic(s) servicing local HD populations, 4.9% (n=82) of counties had a
major COVID-19 outbreak during the week of 22-28 Mar 2020 (Supplementary Table 1), as defined as
being in the top 300 United States counties with the highest growth in COVID-19+ people (number and
ppm) in the general population (Table 1). Counties with a COVID-19 outbreak had a 30% higher
population density compared to counties without an outbreak.

On average, the proportion of patients residing at an assisted living facility did not remarkably differ for
local HD populations among counties with a major COVID-19 outbreak or not (Table 1). The proportion
of HD treatments with high body temperatures (>100 F) in the 14 days before a COVID-19 outbreak was
<1 percentage point different between county groups. The percent change in the 14-day county-wide
mean value for clinical, treatment, and laboratory parameters during the prior 28 days before a COVID
outbreak was small in local HD populations and unremarkable in all cases.

County-Level Prediction Model Feature Importance:

Assessment of variable feature importance with SHAP values showed the top predictors of counties
experiencing an outbreak were the COVID-19+ ppm in the general population during prior 7 days,

number of deaths per COVID-19+ case in the general population during prior 7 days, and the change in
14-day mean pre-HD body temperature among local HD patients in prior 28 days (Figure 2A).

SHAP value plot in Figure 2B further shows the degree of positive or negative impact of each individual
measurement on the prediction. For example, individual counties with a higher number of COVID-19+
ppm in the general population during prior 7 days (warmer colors) were associated with a higher SHAP
value, and this was typically vice versa for individual counties with a lower number of COVID-19+ ppm
(cooler colors).

County-Level Prediction Model Performance:

The ML model had good performance in prediction of the 7-day risk for counties experiencing a COVID19 outbreak. The AUROC for the model was 0.988, 0.799, and 0.857 in the training, validation, and
testing datasets respectively (Figure 3).

A threshold of 0.85 provided the best performance for the model within goals of limiting false positives.
In the testing dataset, the recall was 0.35 showing the model correctly predicted true positives for a
COVID-19 outbreak in 35% of positive counties. The precision was 0.40 showing 40% of counties
predicted to have an outbreak physically experienced a COVID-19 outbreak. The lift was 7.9 in the
testing dataset, suggesting model use is 7.9 times more effective in predicting a COVID-19 outbreak in a
county compared to not using a model.

Prediction of HD Patients with a SARS-CoV-2 Infection:

Patient Characteristics:

We identified data from 11,664 HD patients meeting eligibility criteria (3,249 COVID-19+ cases and 8,415
unaffected (control) patients). The prevalence of COVID-19+ cases (about 28% COVID-19+) in the
training and validation datasets was consistent within the cohort. For the testing dataset used to
evaluate final model performance, there was a 10% prevalence of COVID-19+ cases based on the
designed data split.

In the cohort, there was a higher proportion of HD patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection of black race,
Hispanic ethnicity, and with diabetes (Table 2). Mean values for treatment and laboratory variables
before a SARS-CoV-2 infection being identified in the subsequent ≥3 days (or concurrent index date in
controls) are shown in Tables 3 & 4.

HD patients who contracted COVID-19 had only subtle, clinically unremarkable distinctions in
treatment/laboratory characteristics before being suspected to have a SARS-CoV-2 infection compared
to unaffected patients. Mean pre-/post-HD body temperatures (Table 3) and inflammatory markers
(white blood cell (WBC) count and differential) (Table 4) before a SARS-CoV-2 infection being identified
did not did not show a clinically relevant difference differ between groups. HD patients who had a SARSCoV-2 infection identified in the following 3 days did have higher ferritin levels compared to unaffected
patients.

Patient-Level Prediction Model Feature Importance:

Calculation of variable feature importance with SHAP values found the top three predictors of HD
patients having a SARS-CoV-2 infection were the patient’s mean pre-HD body temperature, blood urea
nitrogen (BUN), and albumin (Figure 4A).

The SHAP value plot is shown in (Figure 4B). For the top predictor of mean pre-HD body temperature
before a SARS-CoV-2 infection, higher body temperatures (warmer colors) were mostly associated with

a positive SHAP value, while lower body temperatures (cooler colors) were always associated with a
negative SHAP value.

Patient-Level Prediction Model Performance:

The HD patient-level model had adequate performance in prediction of the 3-day risk of a SARS-CoV-2
infection. The ML model had an AUROC of 0.88, 0.69, and 0.71 in the training, validation, and testing
datasets respectively (Figure 5).

Setting the threshold for classifying observations as positive or negative at 0.85 to minimize false
positives, precision for the ML model in the testing dataset was 0.42 showing 42% of patients predicted
to have a SARS-CoV-2 infection actually had symptoms in the subsequent ≥3 days and were confirmed to
have COVID-19. The lift was 4.2, suggesting model use is 4.2 times more effective in predicting a HD
patient who contracts COVID-19, as compared to not having a model. However, given the high
threshold, recall was 0.04 showing the model correctly predicted true positives for a SARS-CoV-2
infection in 4% of positive HD patients.

Discussion:

We successfully developed two ML prediction models using retrospective data that appear to have
suitable performance in identifying counties at risk of a major COVID-19 outbreak in the following week
and HD patients at risk of having a SARS-CoV-2 infection in the following ≥3 days. The top predictor of a
COVID-19 outbreak in a county was the COVID-19+ ppm in the general population during prior week.
The top predictor of a SARS-CoV-2 infection was the individual patient’s mean weekly body
temperature.

Albeit top predictors are not surprising, the observed distinctions were subtle. Without insights from the
models considering an array of variables, it would not be clear where one should classify a higher/lower
risk for a county or patient that is meaningful. For instance, an increase of 0.2°F (0.1°C) observed in
weekly pre-HD body temperature alone may not be considered actionable. The average pre-HD body
temperature was 97.5°F (36.4°C) (primarily oral measurements) in our analysis and has been previously
reported as 98.2°F (36.7°C) (31). Given 98.6°F (37°C) is the expected average in healthy populations, the
lower body temperature of HD patients is of importance with the rather low incidence of fever
presenting in dialysis patients with COVID-19 (11%-to-66% with fever (15, 17)).

Prospective testing appears warranted and we anticipate combination of the county- and patient-level
models may yield the greatest early insights on where and when providers can focus additional resource
allocations to combat COVID-19, and what otherwise asymptomatic HD patients might be most
appropriate for COVID-19 testing and triage to an isolation shift/clinic. These models have potential to
provide a data-driven way for dialysis providers/clinicians to predict local transmission rates of COVID-19
and individuals with undetected infections. As more data is captured in the COVID-19 outbreak, further
prediction models that can classify the risk of morbid/mortal outcomes in dialysis patients need to be
developed.

The potential applications of AI for COVID-19 have been previously detailed (32); the first priority was
suggested as “early detection and diagnosis of the infection”. In the United States, county-level
surveillance models have been developed to estimate dynamics of COVID-19 on hospital resource
capacities (33) and relative risk of an emerging COVID-19 outbreak (34). Our model expands upon
surveillance efforts by using advanced ML techniques to identify the risks of a COVID-19 outbreak in
counties considering predictor variables specific to the HD population. The robustness of data and an a
priori selection of variables to be included in both the county- and patient-level ML models bring value

through assessment of feature importance; this allows for interpretation of meaningfulness of
predictors, albeit it does not determine causality.

A systematic review identified several models developed using data from China for early detection of
COVID-19 in suspected individuals (23). None were designed for chronic disease populations. One is an
externally validated ML model that predicts COVID-19 in suspected asymptomatic patients (AUROC
validation=0.872) (35). Another effort used a prediction model (AUROC validation=0.966) to develop
logic for an 8 variable COVID-19 risk chart (36). A further model with an AUROC of 0.938 was created to
detect COVID-19 pneumonia in patients admitting to a fever clinic (37). Other models use
genomic/computed tomography data to diagnose COVID-19 (23). Consistent variables used across
models included age, body temperature, and flu-like illness symptoms (23). Although these models were
all reported to have suitable performance, all were subject to bias due to non-generalizable sampling of
controls without COVID-19 and possible overfitting. We cannot rule out that our ML models may have
similar bias, although they included large samples and the testing dataset for the patient-level model
had relatively generalizable sampling for the dialysis population with respect to positives/negatives (13).
Our patient-level model is unique in its ability to identify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients
without any suspicion of being affected with the disease.

These developed models hold promise to help providers with the COVID-19 pandemic and any
subsequent wave(s) of outbreak (38, 39). Nonetheless, AI modeling is never 100% accurate and model
risk classifications need to be interpreted within the extent of the model’s performance.

Conclusions:

The developed AI models showed suitable performance in prediction of dialysis service areas at risk of
becoming a COVID-19 hotspot and individual HD patients at risk of having an undetected SARS-CoV-2
