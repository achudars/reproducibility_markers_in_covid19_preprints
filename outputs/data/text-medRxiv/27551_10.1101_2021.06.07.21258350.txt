Summary

37

The humoral arm of innate immunity includes diverse molecules with antibody-like functions,

38

some of which serve as disease severity biomarkers in COVID-19. The present study was

39

designed to conduct a systematic investigation of the interaction of humoral fluid phase pattern

40

recognition molecules (PRM) with SARS-CoV-2. Out of 10 PRM tested, the long pentraxin

41

PTX3 and Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL) bound the viral Nucleoprotein and Spike,

42

respectively. MBL bound trimeric Spike, including that of variants of concern, in a glycan-

43

dependent way and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in three in vitro models. Moreover, upon binding

44

to Spike, MBL activated the lectin pathway of complement activation. Genetic polymorphisms

45

at the MBL locus were associated with disease severity. These results suggest that selected

46

humoral fluid phase PRM can play an important role in resistance to, and pathogenesis of,

47

COVID-19, a finding with translational implications.

Introduction

50

SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic coronavirus and the causative agent of the current

51

Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (Hartenian et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhu

52

et al., 2020). Innate immunity is credited to play a fundamental role in this condition and may

53

eradicate the infection in its early phases, before adaptive immune responses take place. In

54

severe forms of the disease, uncontrolled activation of innate and adaptive immunity results in

55

hyperinflammatory responses, which affect the lung and blood vessels, contributing to ARDS,

56

shock and multiorgan failure (Wang et al., 2020).

57

Innate immunity includes a cellular and a humoral arm (Bottazzi et al., 2010). The

58

humoral arm consists in soluble PRMs belonging to different families, which include collectins

59

[e.g. mannose binding lectin (MBL)], ficolins, pentraxins [C-reactive protein (CRP), Serum

60

amyloid P component (SAP), pentraxin 3 (PTX3)], and C1q (Bottazzi et al., 2010; Garlanda et

61

al., 2018; Holmskov et al., 2003). Humoral PRMs represent functional ancestors of antibodies

62

(ante-antibodies), as they recognize microbial components and eliminate pathogens with

63

common mechanisms that include agglutination, neutralization, activation of the complement

64

cascade and opsonization facilitating phagocytosis (Bottazzi et al., 2010). Investigations of the

65

role of humoral innate immunity in viral sensing have shown that collectins bind to envelope

66

glycoproteins on enveloped viruses, including influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus,

67

hepatitis C virus (HCV) and herpes simplex virus, as well as to the nonenveloped rotavirus

68

(Holmskov et al., 2003). Interaction may result in opsonization, agglutination, inhibition of

69

viral fusion and entry, or complement activation, generally leading to inhibition of infection

70

(Holmskov et al., 2003). Among pentraxins, the long pentraxin PTX3 has been show to interact

71

with H3N2-subtype influenza virus type A by interacting with viral envelope hemagglutinin

72

and neuraminidase glycoproteins through a sialic acid residue on its glycosidic moiety

73

(Reading et al., 2008), with cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Bozza et al., 2006), and with the

coronavirus murine hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1) (Han et al., 2012), preventing viral

75

infection.

76

Several lines of evidence, including genetic associations, indicate that cellular innate

77

immunity, and related cytokines and chemokines, play a key role in SARS-CoV-2 recognition,

78

antiviral resistance and, at later stages, severe disease (Merad and Martin, 2020; Pairo-

79

Castineira et al., 2021; Severe Covid et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). In contrast, little

80

information is available concerning the role of the humoral arm of innate immunity in COVID-

81

19 resistance and pathogenesis, in spite of the clinical prognostic significance of CRP and

82

PTX3 (Brunetta et al., 2021; Fajgenbaum and June, 2020).

83

The present study was designed to conduct a systematic investigation of the interaction

84

of the humoral PRM with SARS-CoV-2. We found that PTX3 and MBL bound the SARS-

85

CoV-2 Nucleoprotein and Spike, respectively. MBL recognized variants of concern (VoC),

86

had antiviral activity and activated the Complement lectin pathway. Genetic polymorphisms at

87

the MBL locus were associated with disease severity. Thus, selected fluid phase PRM (ante-

88

antibodies) play an important role in resistance to, and pathogenesis of, COVID-19, a finding

89

with translational implications.

Results

92

Interaction of humoral pattern recognition molecules with SARS-CoV-2 proteins

93

To study the role of humoral PRMs in recognizing SARS-CoV-2, we first investigated

94

the interaction between humoral innate immunity molecules and SARS-CoV-2 proteins using

95

a solid phase binding assay. We first analysed pentraxins and, as shown in Figure 1A and 1B,

96

we did not observe specific binding of CRP and SAP to any of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins tested

97

(S1, S2, S protein active trimer, Nucleocapsid, Envelope protein). In contrast, PTX3 bound

98

specifically and in a dose-dependent manner to the Nucleocapsid protein, one of the most

99

abundant proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (Zeng et al., 2020) (Figure 1C). We validated this result by

100

confirming the binding of PTX3 with SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein produced obtained

101

from different sources. PTX3 is a multimeric glycoprotein arranged in an octameric structure.

102

Each protomer is constituted of a flexible N-terminal region and a C-terminal domain with

103

homology to the short pentraxin family (Bottazzi et al., 2010). To define which portion of the

104

molecule was involved in the interaction, we compared the binding of full length PTX3 and its

105

N-terminal or C-terminal domains to SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein. Results indicate that

106

PTX3 interacts with SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein mainly through its N-terminal

107

domain, although with lower affinity compared to full length PTX3 (Figure 1D).

108

We next investigated the interaction between PRMs of the classical and the lectin

109

pathway of complement (C1q and the collectin MBL, respectively) and the viral proteins. As

110

shown in Figure 2A, C1q did not interact with any protein tested. In contrast, human MBL

111

bound to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (Wuhan strain (Wu et al., 2020), active trimer), but not

112

to the individual SARS-CoV-2 Spike subunits S1 [containing the receptor-binding domain

113

(RBD)] and S2 (containing the membrane fusion domain) (Figure 2B). We validated these data

114

by analyzing the binding of MBL to different recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins

115

obtained from different sources or produced in house either in HEK293 cells, or CHO cells, or

116

in insect cells (Figure 2C and Extended Data Figure 1). All these preparations were bound by

117

MBL, although with some differences. Notably, when we tested a non-covalent trimer of the

118

SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, we did not observe binding. These results indicate that a native-

119

close structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (presumably in the trimeric conformation) is

120

indispensable for MBL recognition.

121

MBL is a member of the collectin family, a class of PRMs composed of a Ca2+- type

122

lectin domain (also called Carbohydrate Recognition Domain, CRD) and a collagen-like

123

domain (Holmskov et al., 2003). Thus, we analyzed the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike

124

protein with other collectins involved in innate immunity, such as Collectin-12 (CLP-1) and

125

the pulmonary surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D. We also extended the analysis to

126

recombinant Ficolin-1, -2, or -3, a family of proteins known to activate the complement lectin

127

pathway, and structurally-related to MBL. As shown in Figure 2D and 2E, in contrast with

128

MBL, CLP-1, SP-A, SP-D, and ficolins did not bind to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, indicating

129

that recognition of Spike is unique to MBL.

130

We further characterized the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with MBL by

131

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Different concentrations of recombinant, SARS-CoV-2

132

Spike protein or RBD domain were flowed onto MBL immobilized on the biosensor surface.

133

As shown in Figure 2F and Extended Data Figure 2, trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein

134

formed a stable calcium-dependent complex with nanomolar affinity (KD=34 nM) whereas

135

MBL did not bind the isolated RBD, confirming the results obtained using the S1 subunit.

136

To mimic the interaction between MBL and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in its

137

physiological conformation in the viral envelope, we investigated the binding of viral particles

138

of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein pseudotyped on a lentivirus vector to MBL-coated plates. The

139

interaction was determined by lysing the bound pseudovirus and measuring the lentiviral vector

140

p24 core protein by ELISA. While control lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the VSV-g

141

glyprotein (VSV-pseudovirus) did not result in any binding, those exposing the SARS-CoV-2

142

Spike protein showed a specific interaction with MBL (Figure 3A). These data strongly suggest

143

that MBL can also interact with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein exposed on the virus surface.

144
145

MBL interacts with glycosidic sites of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

146

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is highly glycosylated, as recently described

147

(Watanabe et al., 2020). Out of the 22 N-glycosylation sites, 8 contain oligomannose-types

148

glycans, which could be interaction sites for the MBL carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD).

149

To address this possibility, we performed a solution-based competition assay with D-mannose

150

and N-acetyl-glucosamine, two specific ligands of the lectin. As shown in Figure 3B, D-

151

mannose and N-acetyl-glucosamine inhibited MBL binding to the Spike protein, thus

152

confirming the Ca2+-dependent interaction between the MBL lectin domain and the glycosidic

153

sites exposed by the Spike protein. D-Glucose, a non-specific ligand of MBL, inhibited the

154

interaction only at higher concentration (Figure 3B). Based on the alignment of MBL crystal

155

structure with mannose molecules (Fig. 3C), we identified 14 putative binding sites on the

156

Spike protein (Fig. 3D). Next, we considered sites having a high (>80%) oligomannosylation

157

occupancy (Watanabe et al., 2020). This analysis provided two possible MBL binding sites,

158

namely N603, N801 and N1074 all on the same Spike chain, or N603, N1074 and N709 with

159

N709 on a neighboring chain (Figure 3E). Interestingly, in both cases, the hypothesized MBL

160

binding sites spans across the S1 and S2 region (Figure 3F) of the Spike protein providing hints

161

to a possible inhibition mechanism. These data indicate that the glycosylation state of the

162

SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is important for its interaction with MBL.

163
164

Interaction of MBL with Spike from VoC

165

We then tested whether MBL recognized Spike proteins from VoC. First, we analyzed

166

whether the known 22 glycosylation sites of each protomer are affected by the reported

167

mutations. Figure 3G shows a schematic representation of the 22 positions of N-linked

168

glycosylation sequons and of 35 known mutations, indicating that none of these mutations

169

involve the glycosylation sites, and suggesting that MBL could interact with the variants with

170

the same affinity. In agreement with our binding assays, no MBL target sites are expected in

171

the RBD. We assessed by solid phase assay the interaction of MBL with the SARS-CoV-2

172

D614G Spike trimeric protein, the B.1.1.7 variant (emerged in UK), the B.1.1.28 or P.1 variant

173

(emerged in Brazil), and B.1.351 (emerged in South Africa) (Figure 3H). In agreement with

174

the in silico analysis, MBL bound the VoC Spike proteins tested with similar affinity.

175
176

Complement lectin pathway activation

177

We asked whether the interaction of MBL with Spike could activate the complement

178

lectin pathway. We incubated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-coated plates with human serum, or

179

C1q- or C4- or C3-depleted serum, and we assessed the deposition of C5b-9. As shown in

180

Figure 3I (left panel), incubation with either normal human serum or C1q-depleted serum

181

resulted in complement deposition mediated by SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Conversely,

182

incubation with a serum depleted of C4 strongly reduced C5b-9 deposition, with levels

183

comparable to those observed with heat-inactivated serum or C3-depleted serum.

184

Reconstitution of C4-depleted serum with purified C4 restored C5b-9 deposition levels similar

185

to those observed with normal human serum. To further address the role of MBL in SARS-

186

CoV-2 Spike protein-mediated complement activation, we assessed C5b-9 deposition by

187

incubating normal human serum or MBL-immunodepleted serum over captured SARS-CoV-2

188

Spike protein, either as active, or non-covalent trimer (Figure 3I, right panel). In agreement

189

with binding data, no complement deposition was observed with the non-covalent trimeric

190

Spike protein. Notably, immunodepletion of MBL from human serum resulted in a significant

191

reduction in C5b-9 deposition, which could be fully reverted by addition of rhMBL (Figure 3I,

192

right panel). These data clearly indicate that SARS-CoV-2 Spike, by interacting with MBL,

193

activates the complement lectin pathway.

194
195

SARS-CoV-2 inhibition by MBL

196

To validate the relevance of the interaction between MBL and SARS-CoV-2 Spike

197

protein, we investigate whether MBL inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry in susceptible cells. We

198

first tested the effect of MBL and other soluble PRMs (10-fold serial dilution, from 0.01 to 10

199

µg/ml) on the entry of the viral particles of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein pseudotyped on a

200

lentivirus vector in 293T cells overexpressing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2).

201

Among the soluble PRMs tested, MBL was found to be the only molecule with anti-SARS-

202

CoV-2 activity. Spike-mediated viral entry was inhibited by 90% at the highest concentration

203

of 10 µg/ml (34 nM) with an EC50 value of approximately 0.5 µg/ml (1.7 nM) (Figure 4A).

204

As control, entry of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the VSV-g glycoprotein was not

205

inhibited by MBL (Figure 4A).

206

We next tested the antiviral activity of MBL on the SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung

207

epithelial models relevant to human infections. Among a number of lung-derived epithelial cell

208

lines, Calu-3 (human lung adenocarcinoma) cells have been shown to be permissive to SARS-

209

CoV-2 infection (Chu et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 (D614G variant, MOI=0.1 and 1) was

210

preincubated in complete medium containing different concentrations of MBL (0.01–10

211

µg/mL; 0.034-34 nM) before incubation with Calu-3 cells. After 48 and 72 h, the infectivity of

212

SARS-CoV-2 present in cell culture supernatants was determined by a plaque-forming assay

213

in monkey-derived Vero cells. Vero cells are a handy cell line used worldwide as it is devoid

214

of the interferon (IFN) response (Desmyter et al., 1968) and, for this reason, highly supportive

215

of virus replication.

216

As shown in Extended Data Figure 3A, MBL showed a concentration-dependent inhibition

217

of SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells at MOI 0.1 (upper panel) and 1 (lower panel), that

218

was statistically significant at 1 and 10 µg/ml (3.4 and 34 nM) 72 h after infection. When both

219

virus and cells were pre-incubated with the same concentrations of MBL (0.01–10 µg/mL;

220

0.034-34 nM), the antiviral activity increased significantly from 0.1 µg/ml (0.34 nM) to the

221

top concentration of 10 µg/ml (34 nM), 72 h post-infection (PI) (Figure 4B and Extended Data

222

Figure 3B). The calculated EC50 was 0.08 µg/mL (0.27 nM) at 72h. Notably, MBL showed

223

a concentration-dependent inhibition of infection of Calu-3 cells also by SARS-CoV-2 variant

224

20I/501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) at MOI 1 (Figure 4C) and MOI 0.1 (Extended Data Figure 3C), as well

225

as by 20H/501Y.V2 (B.1.351) at MOI 1 (Figure 4D).

226

Furthermore, a model of 3D-human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) was used to

227

test whether MBL inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication. SARS-CoV-2 production at the

228

epithelial apical surface increased sharply at 48 h PI (not shown), reaching 48x106 ± 6x106

229

(mean ± SEM) PFU/ml 72 h PI. Treatment of HBEC with MBL decreased viral production

230

to 4x106 ± 0.8x106 PFU/ml 72 h PI at the highest concentration of 50 µg/ml (170 nM) (Figure

231

5A). In contrast PTX3 treatment was ineffective at inhibiting virus production (Extended

232

Data Figure 3D). We then assessed whether in these experimental conditions, MBL affected

233

inflammatory responses in HBEC upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. As shown in Extended Data

234

Figure 3E, MBL treatment inhibited the production of IL-8 and CXCL5, chemokines

235

involved in myeloid cell recruitment and activation.

236

We finally evaluated occurrence of MBL-Spike protein interaction in SARS-CoV-2

237

infected HBEC by confocal microscopy. As shown in Figure 5B and C, MBL colocalized with

238

SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in infected cells. In 3D rendered images of the HBEC cell cultures

239

(Figure 5D and Movie S1), colocalization was preferentially associated to the apical side of

240

cytokeratin 14 positive cells. Evidence of the interaction between MBL and SARS-CoV-2

241

Spike protein in infected HBEC at molecular scale (<100nm XY spatial resolution) were also

242

obtained in STED-based super-resolution microscopy (Figure 5E).

243
244

MBL2 haplotypes are associated with severe COVID-19

245

247

results in the frame of COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated the possible association of MBL2

associated with MBL2 protein levels (Table 1) (Lipscombe et al., 1992; Madsen et al., 1994;

251

Madsen et al., 1995; Sumiya et al., 1991). Surprisingly, we observed a significant difference

252

only in the frequency of the rs5030737-A allele between patients and controls (7.7% and 6.0%,

253

respectively; OR=1.43, 95%CI=1.00-2.05, P=0.049; Table 1A), which however did not survive

254

the correction for multiple testing. When we compared the frequencies of haplotypes

255

determined by all six SNPs, we found the CCGGCC haplotype frequency significantly

256

decreased in patients with severe COVID-19 (26.7% in cases, 30.4% in controls). This

257

haplotype shows a protective effect (odds ratio (OR)=0.78, 95%CI=0.65-0.95, P=0.025; Table

258

1B), consistently with the lack of the rs5030737-A allele, which is only present in the

259

CCAGCC haplotype (OR=1.38, 95%CI=1.00-1.90; P=0.078; Table 1B).

260

Though borderline, these first association results encouraged us to investigate the 1-

261

Mb-long genomic region encompassing the MBL2 gene systematically. To this aim, we

262

performed

263

genotyped/imputed data on 3,425 polymorphisms. Single-SNP association analysis revealed

264

three

265

rs10824845, OR=1.76, 95%CI=1.30-2.39, P=2.91*10-4; and rs11816263, OR=1.42,

266

95%CI=1.17-1.73, P=3.47*10-4; Table 1C; Figure 6), whereas haplotype-based analysis

267

disclosed 7 haplotypes of different lengths, from 2 to 24 SNPs, strongly associated with severe

268

COVID-19 (all surviving the correction for multiple tests; Figure 6; Table 1D). Among them,

269

the one composed of polymorphisms rs10824844-rs10824845 incorporates one of the two top-

270

markers evidenced by the single-SNP association analysis and is present in 12.2% of cases and

271

6.9% of controls (TA haplotype, OR=1.88, 95%CI=1.44-2.45, P=1.04*10-5; Table 1D). Hence,

we performed a meta-analysis based on the rs10824845 polymorphism by including the GHS

Discussion

281

Among the 10 fluid phase PRM tested in this study, only PTX3 and MBL bound SARS-

282

CoV-2 virus components. PTX3 recognized the viral Nucleoprotein and had no antiviral

283

activity. PTX3 was expressed at high levels by myeloid cells in blood and lungs and its plasma

284

levels have strong and independent prognostic significance for death in COVID-19 patients

285

(Brunetta et al., 2021; Schirinzi et al., 2021). It remains to be elucidated whether PTX3 plays

286

a role in Nucleocapsid-mediated complement activation and cytokine production (Gao et al.,

287

2020; Karwaciak et al., 2021; McBride et al., 2014).

288

MBL recognized the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, including that of three VoC, and had

289

antiviral activity in vitro. MBL had previously been shown to bind SARS-CoV Spike (Zhou et

290

al., 2010). The interaction of MBL with Spike required a trimeric conformation of the viral

291

protein, did not involve direct recognition of the RBD and was glycan-dependent, as expected.

292

Site-specific glycosylation analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein revealed the presence

293

of various oligomannose-type glycans across the protein (Watanabe et al., 2020).

294

Molecular modelling reported here suggests that the MBL trimer interact with glycans

295

attached to the residues N603, N801 and N1074 on the same chain or N603, N709 and N1074

296

with N709 on a different chain. In both cases the hypothesized MBL binding site spans across

297

the S1 and S2 region of SARS-CoV-2 Spike, suggesting a possible neutralization mechanism.

298

The binding of MBL could prevent the detachment of the S1 region and the release of the

299

fusion peptide at position 815, thus inhibiting virus entry into host cells. However, the

300

mechanisms responsible for the antiviral activity of MBL remain to be fully defined. It is

301

noteworthy that C-type lectins have been reported to act as entry receptors (or coreceptors)

302

(Chiodo et al., 2020; Lempp et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021) and MBL is likely to compete at this

303

level.

304
305

Interestingly, the in silico analysis presented here indicate that mutations in variants

306

reported until now do not affect glycosylation sites containing oligomannose-types glycans

307

potentially recognized by MBL. In addition, binding and infection experiments show that the

308

anti-viral activity of MBL is not affected by these mutations. This indicate that the

309

glycosylation sites are generally spared by selective pressure, suggesting they are essential for

310

SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. It has been recently shown that mechanisms of in vitro escape of

311

SARS-CoV-2 from a highly neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma include the insertion

312

of a new glycan sequon in the N-terminal domain of the Spike protein, which leads to complete

313

resistance to neutralization (Andreano et al., 2020). This result further emphasizes the

314

relevance of Spike glycosidic moieties targeted by MBL in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

315

MBL was found to interact with Spike and have antiviral activity with an EC50 of

316

approximately 0.08 µg/ml (0.27 nM) and an affinity of 34 nM. These concentrations are well

317

in the range of those found in the blood of normal individuals (up to 10 µg/ml) which increase

318

2-3-fold during the acute phase response. MBL plasma levels in healthy individuals are

319

extremely variable, in part depending on genetic variation in the MBL2 gene. Defective MBL

320

production has been associated with increased risk of infections, in particular in primary or

321

secondary immunodeficient children (Koch et al., 2001). In SARS, conflicting results have

322

been reported concerning the relevance of MBL2 genetic variants in this condition (Ip et al.,

323

2005; Yuan et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005). In COVID-19, one MBL2 SNP has been associated

324

with development and severity of the infection (Medetalibeyoglu et al., 2021). We investigated

325

the possible role of MBL2 genetic variants in determining susceptibility to severe COVID-19

326

with respiratory failure, by exploiting the statistical power provided by haplotype analysis.

327

Surprisingly and in contrast with a previous study (Medetalibeyoglu et al., 2021), we found

328

only a borderline correlation between one haplotype of the 6 SNPs associated with MBL levels

329

and frequency of severe COVID-19 cases. However, we found a total of 7 significantly

330

associated haplotypes, distributed along the MBL2 genomic region, often mapping in

331

correspondence of regulatory elements (such as enhancers, promoter region, histone marks;

332

Figure 6). Our association data are reinforced by: i) the meta-analysis results, obtained by

333

integrating the summary statistics from a European cohort of >113,000 individuals; ii) the fact

334

that one of our second best associations (i.e., rs10824845) maps in proximity of a cluster of

335

suggestive signals (P<5*10-4) identified by the COVID-19 Host Genetic Initiative

336

(https://www.covid19hg.org/; results on release 4 include data from up to 33 different

337

worldwide studies; Figure 6); iii) the Regeneron – Genetic Center database, which contains

338

association results also for rare variants (MAF<1%), reports a significant association (P<0.05)

339

for the rs35668665 polymorphism both with susceptibility to COVID-19 (OR=4.11, GHS

340

cohort) and with severity of symptoms (OR=7.91, UK BioBank cohort). Interestingly, this

341

variant maps in correspondence of the last nucleotide of MBL2 exon 1, thus possibly interfering

342

with the splicing process; and iv) the rs5030737 (p.Arg52Cys) polymorphism in MBL2 has

343

been described in the UKBiobank ICD PheWeb database (https://pheweb.org/UKB-SAIGE/)

344

as a top signal in determining both “dependence on respirator [Ventilator] or supplemental

345

oxygen” (ICD code Z99.1; P=2.7*10-4) and “Respiratory failure, insufficiency, arrest” (ICD

346

code J96; P=2.7*10-3). These observations suggest that genetic variations in MBL2, possibly

347

involved in the modulation of the expression of the gene in hepatocytes, and, interestingly, in

15

348

macrophages, could play a role in determining susceptibility to severe COVID-19 with

349

respiratory failure. Therefore genetic analysis is consistent with the view that MBL recognition

350

of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in COVID-19 pathogenesis.

351

Upon interaction with Spike, MBL was found to activate the lectin pathway of

352

complement, as expected. Complement has been credited an important role in the

353

hyperinflammation underlying severe disease and is considered a relevant therapeutic target

354

(Carvelli et al., 2020; Risitano et al., 2020). Therefore, as for innate immunity in general

355

including the IFN pathway (King and Sprent, 2021), MBL-mediated recognition of SARS-

356

CoV-2 may act as a double-edged sword. In early phases of the disease MBL, possibly

357

produced locally by macrophages, may serve as a mechanism of antiviral resistance by

358

blocking viral entry, whereas in advanced disease stages it may contribute to complement

359

activation and uncontrolled inflammation.

360

MBL has been safely administered to patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic lung

361

infections in which MBL deficiency contributes to pathogenesis (Garred et al., 2002; Jensenius

362

et al., 2003). Therefore, the results presented here have translational implications both in terms

363

of comprehensive genetic risk assessment and development of local or systemic therapeutic

364

approaches.

Methods

549

Recombinant proteins and Antibodies

550

Commercial and non-commercial recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins used in this study

551

are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Recombinant human PTX3 and its domains from CHO

552

cells were produced in house, as previously described (Bottazzi et al., 1997). Recombinant

553

human Surfactant Protein-A (SP-A) was from Origene. Recombinant human MBL, Collectin-

554

12 (CLP-1), Ficolin-1, Ficolin-2, Ficolin-3 and Surfactant Protein-D (SP-D) were from

555

Biotechne. Purified human C1q was from Complement Technology, purified CRP was from

556

Millipore and purified SAP was purchased from Abcam. Rabbit anti-PTX3 antibody was

557

produced in house (Bottazzi et al., 1997), rabbit anti-MBL Ab was purchased from Abcam.

558

Anti-C1q polyclonal antibody was purchased from Dako. Anti-CRP and anti-SAP antibodies

559

were from Merck.

560

Binding of Humoral Pattern Recognition Molecules to SARS-CoV-2 proteins

561

Recombinant His-Tag SARS-CoV-2 proteins were immobilized at different

562

concentrations (ranging from 6.25 to 50 pmol/mL) on 96-well Nickel coated plates (Thermo

563

Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were then blocked for 2 h at 37°C with

564

200 µL of 2% BSA diluted in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mM NaCl, 2

565

mM CaCl2 and 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST-Ca2+). Following blocking, plates were washed three

566

times with TBST-Ca2+ and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 100 µL PTX3 (4 µg/mL – 12 nM in

567

TBST-Ca2+), MBL (1-2 µg/mL – 3.4-6.7 nM in TBST-Ca2+), C1q (4 µg/mL – 10 nM in TBST-

568

Ca2+), CRP (3 µg/mL – 25 nM in TBST-Ca2+) and SAP (4 µg/mL – 32 nM in TBST-Ca2+).

569

After washes, plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with specific primary antibodies, followed

570

by the corresponding HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Both primary and secondary

571

antibodies were diluted in TBST-Ca2+ buffer. After development with the chromogenic

572

substrate 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), binding was

detected by absorbance reading at 450 nm on a Spectrostar Nano Microplate Reader (BMG

574

Labtech, Germany). Values from blank wells were subtracted from those recorded at sample

575

wells.

576

In another set of experiments, 100 µL of 2 µg/mL rhMBL (6.7 nM), CLP-1 (6.7 nM),

577

Ficolin-1 (5 nM), Ficolin-2 (5 nM), and Ficolin-3 (3 nM), SP-A (3 nM) or SP-D (3.4 nM) in

578

PBS were immobilized on 96-well Nunc Maxisorp Immunoplates (Costar, USA) overnight at

579

4°C. Plates were blocked with 200 µL of 2% BSA-TBST-Ca2+ for 2 h at 37°C. After washes,

580

100 µL of biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein was added at different concentrations to the

581

plates for 1 h at 37°C. Following washes, HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:10000, Biospa) was

582

incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Specific binding was detected by TMB development, as described

583

above.

584

For competition-based experiments, biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein was captured

585

on 96-wells Neutravidin coated plates for 1 h at 37°C. Plates were then incubated for 1 h at

586

37°C with 100 µL rhMBL (0.25 µg/mL- 0.83 nM) alone or in the presence of various

587

concentrations of D-mannose or N-acetyl-glucosamine, or D-glucose (Sigma Aldrich). Bound

588

MBL was detected by incubation with rabbit anti-MBL antibody, followed by HRP-conjugated

589

secondary antibody and TMB development, as described above.

590

For the experiments on the interaction between PTX3 domains and SARS-CoV-2

591

Nucleocapsid, PTX3 and its recombinant domains were immobilized on the wells of a 96-well

592

Nunc Maxisorp plate. Then, different concentrations of biotinylated SARS-CoV-2

593

Nucleocapsid protein were added over the captured proteins for 1 h at 37°C. Detection of

594

binding was achieved through incubation with HRP-conjugated streptavidin, as detailed above.

595

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies

596

SPR analyses were carried out at 25 °C on a Biacore 8K instrument (GE Healthcare).

597

MBL was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip through standard amine coupling.

598

Briefly, after activation of the surface with a mixture of 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)

599

carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-Hydroxysuccinimide, MBL was diluted at 50 nM in 10 mM

600

sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5 and injected over the surface (flow rate 10 µl/min). Free activated

601

sites were blocked by flowing 1 M Ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Final MBL immobilization levels

602

were around 4500 Resonance Units (RU, with 1 RU = 1 pg/mm2). A second surface was

603

prepared in parallel with the same procedure, but without any ligand, and used as reference.

604

Recombinant RBD and trimeric Spike were produced in EXPI293 cells and purified as reported

605

(De Gasparo et al., 2021). Increasing concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RBD or Spike protein

606

(2.5, 7.4, 22, 67, 200 and 600 nM) were injected using a single-cycle kinetics setting at a flow

607

rate of 30 µl/min; dissociation was followed for 10 minutes. The running buffer (also used to

608

dilute samples) was 10 mM Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM

609

CaCl2 and 0.005% Tween-20. In another set of experiments, the interaction was analyzed using

610

the running buffer without CaCl2. Analyte responses were corrected for unspecific binding and

611

buffer responses through the use of reference channels. Binding kinetics were determined by

612

fitting of the experimental curves with the Langmuir 1:1 model according to standard

613

procedures; data analyses were performed with Biacore™ Insight Evaluation Software

614

v2.0.15.12933. In the presence of CaCl2, trimeric Spike bound to MBL with Ka (1/Ms)= 2.1e+4,

615

Kd (1/s)= 7.3e-4 and KD=34 nM.

616

Computational modeling of the MBL2 SARS-CoV-2 Spike interaction

617

The model of the MBL2 trimer (UniProt(Consortium, 2020) P11226) was created

618

starting from the crystal structure of human mannose binding protein(Sheriff et al., 1994) (PDB

619

code 1HUP). The N-terminus of MBL2 was modeled as collagen, based on the template crystal

620

structure of collagen triple helix model(Berisio et al., 2002) (PDB code 1K6F). The binding

621

site of mannose molecules was determined aligning the MBL2 structure to the crystal structure

622

of rat mannose protein A(Ng et al., 2002) (PDB code 1KX1). Reference distances (~ 40 Å)

623

between mannose molecules were computed in PYMOL.

624

Putative binding sites of MBL2 were determined identifying all triplets of N-

625

glycosylation sites at a distance between 35 Å and 50 Å in the closed state SARS-CoV-2

626

(Casalino et al., 2020). Distances were computed using the program ALMOST(Fu et al., 2014).

627

Pseudotyped virus production

628

Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with a lentiviral vector

629

expressing the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) under the control of a human

630

Phosphoglycerate Kinase promoter (PGK) (Cesana et al., 2014) and a pCMV expressing vector

631

containing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike sequence (accession number MN908947) that was codon-

632

optimized for human expression and contained a deletion at the 3’ end aimed at deleting 19

633

amino acid residues at the C-terminus. An HIV gag-pol packaging construct and a rev-

634

encoding plasmid were co-transfected by calcium phosphate for the production of infective

635

viral particles. 16 h after transfection, the medium was replaced and 30 h later, supernatant was

636

collected, filtered through 0.22 µm pore nitrocellulose filter and viral particles were pelleted

637

by ultracentrifugation. As control, lentivirus particles were pseudotyped with the VSV-g

638

glycoprotein that allows a high efficiency infection independently of binding to ACE2.

639

Pseudotyped lentivirus binding assay

640

96-well Nunc Maxisorp Immunoplates (Costar, USA) were coated with 100 µL of

641

rhMBL (3 and 1 µg/mL – 10 and 3.4 nM diluted in PBS). After overnight incubation, plates

642

were blocked with 2% BSA diluted in TBST-Ca2+ for 1 h at 37°C, washed three times with

643

TBST-Ca2+ and incubated for 1 h with 100 µL of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-pseudotyped

644

lentivirus or VSV-pseudotyped lentivirus (ranging fom 0.1 to 1 µg/mL diluted in TBST- Ca2+).

645

After washing, bound pseudotyped virus particles were lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 and HIV

646

p24 core protein was detected by ELISA (Perkin Elmer; USA).

647

Complement deposition assay

648

100 µL of biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (either active trimer or non-covalent

649

trimer, 1µg/mL in PBS) were captured on 96 well plates for 1 h at 37°C. After washing, wells

650

were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with either 10% normal human serum (NHS, ComplemenTech

651

Inc, USA), 10% C1q-depleted serum (C1qDHS), 10% C4-depleted serum (C4DHS)

652

reconstituted or not with 25 µg/mL purified C4 (Calbiochem, USA). 10% heat-inactivated

653

human serum (30’ at 56°C, HI-NHS) and 10% C3-depleted serum (C3DHS) were used as

654

negative control. All the sera were diluted in 10 mM Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5 mM

655

MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2 and 0.05% Tween-20, also used as washing buffer.

656

immunodepletion, 10% NHS was incubated overnight with 0.6 µg/mL rabbit anti-MBL

657

antibody. Bound MBL-antibody complexes were separated by Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo

658

Fisher Scientific), and the supernatant (termed MBL-ID) was used in the assay (final

659

concentration, 10%). After washing, C5b-9 deposition was assayed by incubation for 1 h at

660

37°C with rabbit anti-sC5b-9 antibody (ComplemenTech Inc., Usa) diluted 1:2000 in washing

661

buffer as described before (Stravalaci et al., 2020), followed by specific HRP-conjugated

662

secondary antibody incubation and TMB development.

663

Cell Lines

For MBL

664

The Vero and Vero E6 cell line was obtained from the Istituto Zooprofilattico of

665

Brescia, Italy, and ATCC, respectively. Cells were maintained in Eagle’s minimum essential

666

medium (EMEM; Lonza) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Euroclone) and

667

penicillin-streptomycin (complete medium).

668

Human embryonic kidney 293T cells, a continuous human embryonic kidney cell line

669

containing the mutant gene of SV40 Large T Antigen (ATCC code CRL-3216), were cultured

670

as described (Follenzi et al., 2000).

671

The human lung epithelial Calu-3 cell line was obtained from NovusPharma. Cells were

672

grown in EMEM supplemented with 20% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin (complete

673

medium).

674

Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells (HBEC)

675

The isolation, culture, and differentiation of primary human bronchial epithelial cells

676

(HBECs) were performed as previously reported (Scudieri et al., 2012), with some

677

modifications. In brief, epithelial cells were obtained from mainstem human bronchi, derived

678

from individuals undergoing lung transplant. For the present study, cells were obtained from

679

three donors (BE37, BE63 and BE177). Epithelial cells were detached by overnight treatment

680

of bronchi with protease XIV and then were cultured in a serum-free medium (LHC9 mixed

681

with RPMI 1640, 1:1) containing supplements, as described (Scudieri et al., 2012). The

682

collection of bronchial epithelial cells and their study to investigate airway epithelium

683

physiopathology were specifically approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Giannina

684

Gaslini following the guidelines of the Italian Ministry of Health (registration number:

685

ANTECER, 042-09/07/2018). Each patient provided informed consent to the study using a

686

form that was also approved by the Ethics Committee.

687

To obtain differentiated epithelia, cells were seeded at high density (5x105

688

cell/snapwell) on 12-mm diameter porous membranes (Snapwell inserts, Corning, code 3801).

689

After 24 hours, the serum-free medium was removed from both sides and, on the basolateral

690

side only, replaced with Pneumacult ALI medium (StemCell Technologies) and differentiation

691

of cells (for 3 weeks) was performed in air-liquid interface (ALI) condition.

692

Entry assay with SARS-CoV-2 Spike- pseudotyped lentivirus particles

693

293T cells were engineered to overexpress the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor by

694

transduction of a lentiviral vector expressing ACE2 (kindly provided by Massimo Pizzato,

695

University of Trento). Lentiviral vector stock expressing ACE2 was produced as described

696

above. The entry assay was then optimized in 96-well plate by seeding 5x104 ACE2

697

overexpressing 293T cells/well. Twenty-four h later, cells and SARS-CoV-2 Spike-

698

pseudotyped lentivirus stock (1:500) were incubated with serial dilutions of soluble innate

699

immunity molecules for 30 min. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped was added to the cells

700

and forty-eight h later, cells were treated with accutase, in order to detach them from the wells,

701

fixed and analyzed for GFP expression by cytofluorimetry.

702

SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates

703

The SARS-CoV-2 isolate of the B.1 lineage with the Spike D614G mutation (GISAID

704

accession ID: EPI_ISL_413489) was obtained from the nasopharyngeal swab of a mildly

705

symptomatic patient by inoculation of Vero E6 cells as described (Clementi et al., 2020;

706

Mycroft-West et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 isolate of the South African B1.351 lineage

707

(GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_1599180) was obtained from the nasopharyngeal swab of an

708

Italian 80-year-old male patient. The SARS-CoV-2 isolate of the B1.1.7 lineage (GISAID

709

accession ID: EPI_ISL_1924880) was obtained from the nasopharyngeal swab of an Italian

710

58-year-old female patient. Secondary viral stocks were generated by infection of adherent

711

Vero E6 cells seeded in a 25 cm2 tissue culture flask with 0.5 ml of the primary isolate diluted

712

in 5 ml of complete medium. Three days after infection, the supernatant was harvested and,

713

after centrifugation, passed through a 0.45 µm filter. Aliquots of the secondary SARS-CoV-2

714

isolate were maintained at -80 °C. A plaque-forming assay was performed to determine viral

715

titers.

716

Infections

717

Calu-3 cells were seeded in 48-well plates (Corning) at the concentration of 5x104

718

cell/well in complete medium 24 h prior to infection. Ten-fold serial dilutions of MBL (from

719

0.01 to 10 µg/ml – 0.034-34 nM) were incubated for 1 h with aliquots of SARS-CoV-2

720

containing supernatant to obtain a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of either 0.1 or 1 before

721

incubation with Calu-3 cells (Virus+MBL). After 48 and 72 h post-infection (PI), cell culture

722

supernatants were collected and stored at – 80 °C until determination of the viral titers by a

723

plaque-forming assay in Vero cells.

724

Virus incubation with MBL was also combined with incubation of target cells. Briefly,

725

virus incubation with MBL was performed as described above whereas Calu-3 cells were

726

incubated with 10-fold serial dilutions of MBL (from 0.01 to 10 µg/ml – 0.034-34 nM). After

727

1 h, virus suspensions incubated with serial dilutions of MBL were added to MBL-treated cells

728

(Virus+ Cells+MBL). After 48 and 72 h POST, cell culture supernatants were collected and

729

stored at – 80 °C until determination of the viral titers by a plaque-forming assay in Vero cells.

730

Forty-eight h before infection, the apical surface of HBEC was washed with 500 µl of

731

PBS for 1.5 hours at 37°C, and the cultures were moved into fresh air liquid interface media.

732

Immediately before infection, apical surfaces were washed twice to remove accumulated

733

mucus with 500 µl of PBS with each wash lasting 30 min at 37°C. Two concentrations of either

734

PTX3 or MBL were added to the apical surface for 1 h prior to the addition of 100 µl of viral

735

inoculum (SARS-CoV-2) at a MOI of 1. HBEC were incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Viral inoculum

736

was then removed and the apical surface of the cultures was washed three times with 500 µl of

737

PBS. Cultures were incubated at 37°C for 72 h PI. Infectious virus produced by the HBEC was

738

collected by washing the apical surface of the culture with 100 µl of PBS every 24 h up to 72

739

h PI. Apical washes were stored at −80°C until analysis and titered by plaque assay in Vero

740

cells. At 72 h PI, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunofluorescence analysis.

741

All infection experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory at the

742

Laboratory of Medical Microbiology and Virology, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University.

743

Chemokine quantification

°C until analysis. Prior to chemokine quantification, 250 µl of medium was treated with 27 µl

747

of Triton X-100 and heated for 30 min at 56 °C to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

748

Chemokines (IL-8 and CXCL5) were quantified by ELISA (Quantikine ELISA kits,

749

code DY208, DY254, R&D Systems).

750

Plaque-forming assay

751

In order to measure the virus titer of the viral stocks, a plaque-forming assay was

752

optimized in Vero cells. Briefly, confluent Vero cells (1.5x106 cell/well) seeded in 6-well

753

plates (Corning) were incubated in duplicate with 1 ml of EMEM supplemented with 1% FBS

754

containing 10-fold serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 stock. After 1 h of incubation, the viral

755

inoculum was removed and methylcellulose (Sigma; 1 ml in EMEM supplemented with 5%

756

FBS) was overlaid on each well. After 4 days of incubation, the cells were stained with 1%

757

crystal violet (Sigma) in 70% methanol. The plaques were counted after examination with a

758

stereoscopic microscope (SMZ-1500; Nikon Instruments) and the virus titer was calculated in

759

terms of plaque forming units (PFU)/ml.

760

In order to determine the viral titers of the supernatant collected from Calu-3 cells at 48

761

and 72 h PI, confluent Vero cells (2.5x105 cell/well) were seeded in 24-well plates (Corning)

762

24 h prior to infection. Then, cells were incubated with 300 µl of EMEM supplemented with

763

1% FBS containing serially diluted (1:10) virus-containing supernatants. The plaque-forming

764

assay was performed as described above.

779

Leica SP8 STED3X confocal microscope system equipped with a Leica HC PLAPO CS2

780

63X/1.40 oil immersion lens. Confocal images (1.024 X 1.024 pixels) were acquired in XYZ

781

and tiling modality (0.25 µm slice thickness) and at 1 Airy Unit (AU) of lateral resolution

782

(pinhole aperture of 95.5µm) at a frequency of 600Hz in bidirectional mode. Alexa Fluor 488Ò

783

was excited with a 488 nm argon laser and emission collected from 505 to 550nm. Alexa Fluor

784

594Ò was excited with a 594/604nm-tuned white light laser and emission collected from 580

785

to 620nm. Alexa Fluor 5647Ò was excited with a 640/648nm-tuned white light laser and

786

emission collected from 670 to 750nm. Frame sequential acquisition was applied to avoid

787

fluorescence overlap. A gating between 0.4 and 7ns was applied to avoid collection of

788

Patient cohorts for genetic analyses

799

For association analyses, we investigated a total of 2,000 individuals. These included:

800

i) 332 patients with severe COVID-19, which was defined as hospitalization with respiratory

801

failure and a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA PCR test from nasopharyngeal swabs.

802

Patients were recruited from intensive care units and general wards at two hospitals in the

803

Milan area, i.e., the Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, IRCCS, in Rozzano, Italy (140

804

patients); and San Gerardo Hospital, in Monza, Italy (192 patients); ii) 1,668 controls from the

805

general Italian population with unknown COVID-19 status.

806

Details on DNA extraction, array genotyping and quality checks are reported elsewhere

807

(Myocardial Infarction Genetics et al., 2009; Severe Covid et al., 2020). The dataset for cases

808

was submitted to the European Bioinformatics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas) under accession

809

numbers GCST90000255 and GCST90000256, whereas the dataset for controls is deposited in

810

the Genotypes and Phenotypes database (dbGaP; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/), under

811

the phs000294.v1.p1 accession code.

812

Approvals for the project were obtained from the relevant ethics committees

813

(Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, reference number, 316/20; the University of Milano-

814

Bicocca School of Medicine, San Gerardo Hospital, reference number, 84/2020).

checked cases and controls for solving within-Italian relationships and for testing the possible

824

existence of population stratification within and across batches: to this aim, we performed

825

principal component analysis (PCA), using a LD-pruned subset of SNPs across chromosome

826

10 and the Plink v.1.9 package (Chang et al., 2015). The final set of analyzed variants

827

comprised 3,425 SNPs, distributed in the MBL2 region (the gene +/-500 kb).

828

Statistical analysis

829

Prism GraphPad software v. 8.0 (www.graphpad.com) was used for the statistical

830

analyses. Comparison among groups were performed using one or two-way analysis of

831

variance (ANOVA) and the Bonferroni’s correction. Non-linear fit of transformed data was

832

determined by using the log (agonist) vs. response (three or four parameters).

833

For genetic studies, case-control allele-dose association tests were performed using the

834

PLINK v.1.9 logistic-regression framework for dosage data. Age, sex, age*age, sex*age, and

835

the first 10 principal components from PCA were introduced in the model as covariates.

836

Analyses were conducted always referring to the minor allele. All P values are presented as not

837

corrected and accompanied by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI); however, in

838

the relevant table/figure, Bonferroni-corrected thresholds for significance are indicated in the

839

footnote/legend.

840

Haplotype analysis was performed in two ways: i) by selecting relevant SNPs and using

841

the –hap-logistic option implemented in PLINK v.1.07 (Purcell et al., 2007); ii) by an

842

unsupervised

843

(http://faculty.washington.edu/browning/beagle/b3.html), which uses the method described by

844

Browning & Browning (Browning and Browning, 2007) for inferring haplotype phase. In this

845

case, we used the default setting of 1,000 permutations for calculating corrected P values.
