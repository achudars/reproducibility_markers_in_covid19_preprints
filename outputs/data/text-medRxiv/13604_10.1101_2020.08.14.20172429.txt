Abstract
Background Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable virus that continues to
disrupt livelihoods, particularly those of low income segments of society, around the world. In
Ethiopia, more specifically in the capital city of Addis Ababa, a sudden increase in the number of
confirmed positive cases in high-risk groups of the community has been observed over the last few
weeks of the first case. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, practices and associated
factors that can contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups in Addis Ababa.
Methods A cross-sectional in person survey (n=6007) was conducted from 14-30 April, 2020
following a prioritization within high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. The study area targeted bus
stations, public transport drivers, air transport infrastructure, health facilities, public and private
pharmacies, hotels, government-owned and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, orphanages,
elderly centers, prison, prisons and selected slum areas where the people live in a crowed. A
questionnaire comprised of four sections (demographics, knowledge, practice and reported symptoms)
was used for data collection. The outcomes (knowledge on the transmission and prevention of
COVID-19 and practices) were measured using four items. A multi variable logistic regression was
applied with adjustment for potential confounding.

Results About half (48%, 95% CI: 46-49) of the study participants had poor knowledge on
the transmission mode of COVID-19 whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58-61) had good
knowledge on prevention methods for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures
towards COVID-19 was found to be low (49%, 95% CI: 48-50). Factors that influence
knowledge on COVID-19 transmission mechanisms were female gender, older age,
occupation (health care and grocery worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call
centre. Older age, occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of
respiratory illness and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about
the prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income,
knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the
practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19.
Conclusion The study highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission
modes and prevention mechanism. Similarly, there was moderate practice of measures that
contribute towards the prevention of COVID-19 among these priority high risk communities
of Addis Ababa. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in terms of transmission
mode and prevention methods of COVID-19 to improve preventions practices and control the
spread of COVID-19. Use of female public figures and religious leaders could support the
effort towards the increase in awareness.

Background

Coronaviruses are a large family group of viruses that cause illnesses that range from the
common cold to more severe diseases found in both animals and humans (1). A sudden
outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by infection with severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in December 2019 in Wuhan City,
Hubei Province, China (2). The most recent novel coronavirus, currently known as COVID19 virus, had not been detected before and could be a new strain of coronavirus that has no
antecedent known in humans (3).
Fever, dry cough, fatigue, and multiple systemic illnesses including respiratory (shortness of
breath, sore throat, rhinorrhea, hemoptysis, and chest pain), gastrointestinal (diarrhoea,
nausea, and vomiting), musculoskeletal (muscle ache), and neurologic (headache or
confusion) were the symptoms reported in the first cases in China (1,4). The best estimate of
the incubation period of the disease ranges from 1 to 14 days (3), it causes a huge burden on
the healthcare system and is a global public health emergency for all countries in the world
(3,5).
According to the Worldometer (As of August 4, 2020, 7 pm), COVID-19 has spread to more
than 210 countries and territories and accounted for 18,543,936 confirmed cases. Of these,
63.43% (11,762,600) cases recovered and 3.77% (699,987) of total reported cases have died
(6). In Africa, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) dashboard, since the first
case was registered in 14 February 2020 in Egypt, 968,020 cases, 629, 612 recoveries and 20,
612 deaths have been reported. According to the Ministry of Health and the Ethiopian Public
Health Institute’s COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and response daily situation report (4
August 2020) , since the first COVID-19 case was reported on 13 March, 2020, a total of 19,
877 COVID-19 confirmed positive cases have been registered; out of these, 41.45%(8249)
have recovered and 1.72%(343) have died (7).
The global community is struggling to slow down and eventually halt the spread of COVID19 that has claimed thousands of lives and sickened tens of thousands through improving the
knowledge and practice of COVID-19 prevention methods, testing and screening (8,9).
WHO reports that the best way to prevent and slow down the transmission of COVID-19 is to
accurately and widely inform the public about the disease, the causes, mode of transmission,
and simple prevention methods such as handwashing with soap or use of hand sanitizers,
maintaining social distance and staying home to remain protected from the infection (10). On

the other hand, poor hand hygiene practices, overcrowding and close physical contacts like
handshaking contribute to the fast spread of the virus within a very short period (11).
Implementing personal hygiene and public health interventions especially in priority highrisk groups is necessary to curb the spread of coronavirus (12). Therefore, enhancing the
community’s knowledge and practice of COVID-19 symptoms & prevention methods will
have a significant contribution to reduce the spread of the outbreak. A study conducted in
United States of America on awareness, attitudes, and actions related to COVID-19 revealed
that seven out of ten participants (71.7%) correctly identified three COVID-19 symptoms
and 69.8% were able to identify three prevention methods (13). Studies in China and the
United Arab Emirates revealed that 73.8% of health workers identified fever, cough, sore
throats and shortness of breath as symptoms of COVID-19 (14,15), while, 98% of health
workers suggested washing hands with soap and water, social distance and using face masks
could help in the prevention of disease transmission (14). In line with this, 96% of Chinese
residents had mentioned fever, fatigue, dry cough, and myalgia as the main clinical symptoms
of COVID-19 (16). Another study in Bangladesh also indicated that 98.7% of students
believed that handwashing with soap and water followed by avoiding touching your nose,
mouth and eyes with unwashed hands, the use of face mask/tissue when coughing or sneezing
and wearing a clean surgical mask during their respiratory illness as the prevention methods
for COVID-19 (17).
Ethiopia is currently showing a high commitment to prevent and slow down the COVID-19
pandemic before it causes significant health damages and an economic crisis in the
community. Case identification, contact tracing, isolation and mandatory quarantine, large
scale screening in high-risk groups are the actions being taken to control the spread of the
disease (11). Controlling the spread of infection in high-risk groups must be the target in the
containment strategy of COVID-19 responses. To our knowledge, no study has assessed the
knowledge and practices towards the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups.
Therefore, this study aimed to assess the knowledge, practices, and associated factors towards
the prevention of COVID-19 among the high-risk groups of Addis Ababa community.

Methods
Study area and period

The study was conducted in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Addis Ababa is often
referred to as "the political capital of Africa" for its historical, diplomatic and political
significance for the continent. The largest city in the country, with a total population of
4,793,699 (52% Female Vs 48% Male). The religious composition of the population showed
the overwhelming majority to be Orthodox Christian (81.8%), followed by Muslim (12.7%),
Protestant (3.9%) and Catholic (1%). The city is divided into 10 boroughs, called sub-cities.
Addis covers 527 square kilometres of area in Ethiopia. The population density is estimated
to be near 5,165 individuals per square kilometre (18).
Addis Ababa is located at 9°1 48 N 38°44 24 E. It has an elevation of 2,326 meters above

sea level, at the lowest point around Bole International Airport in the southern periphery and
it rises to over 3,000 metres above sea level in the Entoto Mountains to the North. The largescale assessment of the knowledge and practice in the prevention of COVID-19 was
conducted from 14 to 30 April, 2020.
Study population

A population assumed to be more likely within high risk groups of acquiring COVID-19 was
the study population. More likely high-risk groups are classified as groups who have high
exposure due to different risk factors of COVID-19 such as, exposure to public areas,
travellers, recently been overseas, close contact of COVID-19 positive confirmed cases, and
being in correctional and detention facilities. Health workers (including emergency services
and non-clinical staff) regardless of their risk, and street children, prisons, schools, long-term
living facilities, bus stations workers etc) were also classified as a high-risk.
Study participants

Most of the respondents were formal sector employees. These formal sector target facilities
included; the bus stations, public transport drivers, airport, cargo, health facilities, public, and
private pharmacies, hotels, government and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers,
children’s villages, custody centers, geriatric centers, prison, detention centers and selected
slum areas where people live in crowded housing (namely; Lideta, Atobis Tera, Kirkos).
Sampling strategy and data collection

Random sampling method was applied to identify the study participants. In total, 6,007
people were included.

Background and demographic information was collected using a questionnaire that is adapted
from the surveillance system for COVID-19. Senior statisticians developed the data entry
template using ODK. Internet-based cloud was used to transfer the data and computer tablets
were used for data collection. Information on reported symptoms, travel history, any
suspicious exposure to COVID-19 and attending gatherings/crowded areas was collected.
Thirty-two teams, each of them with two members, were involved in the fieldwork. Sixtyfour health professionals (Medical Doctors, Public Health Officers, Laboratories, Nurses,
Environmental health professional and Midwives) were trained for three days. The training
included a classroom lecture and practical exercise on the use of the data collection tool.
During the face-to-face interview, the field teams used all the necessary PPE. They also
practiced all the necessary precautions such as practicing hand hygiene, to avert the risk of
acquiring the infection from the study participants.
Data source

The analysis was done on the data that was collected for the large-scale COVID-19 screening
in Addis Ababa. The collected data includes socio-demographic information (such as age,
sex, religion, and occupation), income, knowledge about the transmission and prevention
methods. Personal practices towards the prevention of COVD-19 and reported symptoms
were also captured.
Definition of variables

The knowledge on the transmission of COVID-19 was measured using four items. The items
were; 1) during contacts (handshake and physical contact), 2) during coughing and sneezing,
3) during breathing, and 4) Eating and drinking contaminated foods. Good knowledge was
classified when the scoring was 3 (75% and above) out of four items and below 3 indicated

Data Quality Control

To maintain the quality of the data, two days training was provided for data collectors on the
aim of the study and methods of data collection. A computer-based data collection was used
to control entry errors. Field level suppression was done to control the data collection and
data quality.
Data management and analysis

We obtained the data from EPHI. The data was collected for the routine surveillance and
screening activity among more priority high risk groups of Addis Ababa people. Data were
directly transferred from the field staff tablet to EPHI server whenever the field team
completed each questionnaire.
The items were first coded as “1” favouring the good outcome and “0” not favouring a good
outcome. Then, all the items were added into one to represent the outcome. The new variable
had a total score range from 0 to 4. A score of 3 (75%) would favour and 2 (50%) would

≤

disfavour the outcome.
A descriptive statistic was done to present the results in count, proportion and graphs.
Multivariate Logistic regression was done to determine the factors associated with knowledge
on transmission and prevention of COVID-19 and practice towards the prevention of
COVID-19.
Result
Socio-demographic characteristic of the participants

A total of 6,007 participants were involved in the survey. Of these, the majority, 61% (3,634)
were male; 41% (2,470) were between ages 25-34 years; and around 4% (236) were above 60
years old. The mean age of the participants was 33(SD ±11.73) years. Over half (50%) of the
participants were non-formal employees such as street children, clients living in centres, in
children’s villages, cardiac centres and cancer centres, prisons etc, while a small proportion
were health care workers (14%) and public transport drivers (11%). Around, three-quarters
(75%) of the participants were Orthodox Christian in religion and half of the study
participants (50%) had a monthly income between 3,001 and 10,000 ETB (Table 1).

The experiences of COVID-19 related illness and communication were assessed. Among the
study participants, 3% had a history of fever and an experience of respiratory illness within
14 days before the study. Of those who had an experience of respiratory illness, 51% had a
cough, 34% had a runny nose, 18% had a sore throat and the rest, 11%, had shortness of
breath. Free call centres and hotlines have been made publicly available to create awareness,
receive information and for other COVID-19 related issues; however, only 11% of
participants contacted these facilities.
Knowledge of participants on the transmission, prevention, and practice for prevention of
COVID19

The majority, 87%, of the respondents mentioned direct contact with COVID-19 patients, and
71% mentioned breathing as possible transmission mechanisms for COVID-19. Regarding
prevention, 85% and 83%mentioned hand washing and social distancing as prevention
mechanisms for COVID- 19, respectively. More than 80% of the respondents practiced hand
washing, while 76% practiced social distancing to prevent the transmission of COVID-19
(Table 2).

Level of knowledge on transmission modes and prevention methods, and practice for the
prevention of COVID-19.

Findings demonstrated that study participants have low levels of knowledge on transmission
modes, prevention methods and practice of prevention of COVID-19. Over half (52%; 95%
CL: 51-54) of the respondents had good knowledge on transmission of COVID-19; about
60% (95% CL: 58–61) had good knowledge on prevention; and about half, 49% (95% CI:
48–50) had poor practices of the precautionary measures against COVID-19 (Fig 1).

than females (AOR= 0.87, 95% CI: 0.78 - 0.97). As age increases, the likelihood of being
knowledgeable about the transmission modes of COVID-19 increases. Age group > 64 years
were 14 times (AOR: 14.38, CI= 6.79 - 30.48) more likely to be knowledgeable on the
transmission of COVID-19 than those who were younger than 18 years old. Regarding the
occupation of respondents, health workers and grocery store workers were 2.25 and 2.22
times, respectively, more likely to be knowledgeable on the transmission methods of COVID19 than other occupations. As income increases, the likelihood of being knowledgeable about
the methods of transmission of COVID also increases; however, above some level of income
this is no longer the case. Participants whose income was greater than 10,000 Ethiopian Birr
were 49% (AOR: 0.51, 95%CI=0.39 - 0.65) less likely to be knowledgeable about the
transmission mechanism of COVID-19 than low-income participants (<1000 ETB). Those
participants who had contacted 8335 free call center were 1.3 times more likely to be
knowledgeable about transmission mechanisms of COVID-19 than those who did
not.(AOR=1.30, 95% CI=1.10 - 1.54) (Table 3).

Factors associated with knowledge on the prevention of COVID-19

Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age, occupation, income, religion, and
experience of respiratory illness 14 days before the study were significantly associated with
knowledge on the prevention of COVID-19. At age 64 or greater, knowledge on the
prevention methods of COVID-19 was 11 times higher than at ages below 18 years old.
(AOR=11.46, 95%CI=5.57 – 23.59). Regarding the occupation of respondents, health
workers and grocery store workers were 4 and 2 times more likely, respectively, to be
knowledgeable on the prevention methods, while drivers were 18%less likely to be
knowledgeable about the prevention methods of COVID-19 than other occupants. Those
participants who experienced respiratory illness in the past 14 days were 1.6 times
(AOR=1.61, 95%CI =1.17 -2.21) more likely to be knowledgeable about the prevention
methods of COVID-19 than those who did not experience respiratory illness (Table 4).

Factors associated with practices for the prevention of COVID 19

Using logistic regression analysis, the study found that occupation, religion, income, and
knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were found to be associated
with the practice of precautionary measures against COVID-19.
As depicted in table 5, health care workers were more than two times (AOR=2.33 (95%IC:
1.85 - 2.93) more likely to implement the precautionary measures of COVID-19 than other
occupants. Also, drivers (AOR= 1.94, 95% CI: 1.49 -2.52) and guards (AOR=1.83, 95% CI:
1.40 - 2.39) had higher odds of implementing the precautionary measures of COVID-19,
respectively. Implementation of precautionary measures against COVID-19 was found to be
lower among grocery store workers, at 0.71 (95% CI: 0.53 - 0.95) and students at 0.56, (95%
CI: 0.32 - 1.00) compared to other occupants. Regarding religion, Muslims participants were
at0.42 (95% CI: 0.19 - 0.88) lower odds of implementing the precautionary measures of
COVID-19 than others. The implementation of precautionary measures against COVID-19
were found to be lower among higher income groups. Those who earned more than 10,000
ETB per month had 0.42 lower odds of practicing the precautionary measures against
COVID-19 than those with lower income.
Participants who had good knowledge on transmission methods and prevention mechanisms
COVID-19 were four times (95% CI: 4.05 - 5.62) and fifteen times (95% CI: 12.55 -18.97)
more likely, respectively, to implement the precautionary measures of COVID-19(Table 5).

Discussion

The study found 52% and 60% overall knowledge of the respondents about transmission and
prevention of COVID-19, respectively. The practice of the prevention of COVID-19 was low
(49%). Regarding the factors, gender, age, occupation, income and having used the 8335 free
call center were the factors associated with knowledge on the transmission of COVID-19.
Age, occupation, income, religion, and experience of respiratory illness 14 days before the
study were significantly associated with the knowledge on the prevention of COVID-19. The
study found that occupation, religion, income, and knowledge on the transmission and
prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures against
COVID-19.
This study was conducted two months after the first COVID-19 positive case was reported in
the country; thus we expect the study community to have higher awareness now. However,
the level of knowledge that this study identified was unexpectedly low. The Ethiopian study
is compared and contrasted to some others globally. A study conducted in Iran revealed that
knowledge about the mode of transmission of the disease found a similar figure of 56% (8).
In contrast, a study conducted in China revealed that the overall knowledge of COVID-19
was high at 90% (16). Our study has found better knowledge on the prevention of COVID-19
than a study conducted in Thailand with a result of, 73.4% on the knowledge on prevention
and control of COVID-19 (19).

The level of practices for the prevention of COVID-19 in Ethiopia was 49%, which was
lower than the study conducted in Iran, 71%, (8),but much higher than the study conducted in
Thailand, 17%, (19). The sociodemographic characteristics of the study participants, study
differences in methodology, study time, and area of the study could explain the differences,
while the low-levels of use of the 8335 call centers and hotline may have limited people from
acquiring knowledge in the subject matter.
In this study, age, occupation, and income have shown significant association with the
knowledge on the transmission and prevention mechanisms of COVID-19. Gender, religion,
and contacting the 8335 free call center were significantly associated with the knowledge on
the transmission mechanisms of COVID-19, while participants who had a respiratory illness
14 days before the study were significantly associated with knowledge on the prevention
mechanisms of COVID-19. The findings of women being more knowledgeable than men
about the transmission of COVID-19 was in line with the studies conducted in China and Iran
(8,16).
Being a health professional was associated with better knowledge about COVID-19. This
finding is supported by the study conducted in Iran (8). A further similarity was found
between two studies on the association between age groups and knowledge, with both studies
showing better knowledge at older ages. The increase in income was inversely associated
with being knowledgeable about the transmission methods of COVID-19. In addition, the
study revealed that those participants who had contacted the 8335 free call center had better
knowledge on the transmission methods of COVID-19, and those patients who have
experience on respiratory illness 14 days before the study had better knowledge on the
prevention of COVID-19.

The study also found that occupation, religion, income, and knowledge on the transmission
and prevention of COVID- 19 were found to be associated with the practice of precautionary
measures against COVID-19. Health care workers, drivers, and guards reported practicing
prevention mechanisms such as hand washing, social distancing, use of face masks, and
staying home. On the other hand, participants such as grocery store workers, students and
high-income groups were not practicing the prevention methods of COVID-19 in the proper
ways. Contrary to our study, having health-care-related occupations was found to be
significantly associated with lower practice towards the prevention of COVID-19 (8). The
hand hygiene practice has strong relationship and it is widely practiced among Muslim
religion followers. However, the measurement of precautionary measures was estimated in

combined with other three preventive practices that lead to pulling the result towards
negative; such as the use of mask, physical distancing and staying at home. Our study
revealed that having good knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 was
found to be associated with good practices on COVID-19 prevention. This finding is not in
line with the study conducted in China, which revealed that study participants who had a
good knowledge score on the prevention mechanisms of COVID-19 were more likely to visit
crowded places and failed to wear face masks (16).
Strengths and limitations

Our study was large and had a broad scope with several strengths. It was based on a large
sample size and focused on participants from areas that were likely to be high risk; therefore,
the findings can be generalized across the city’s population. Unlike other studies, we did
face-to-face interviews in this challenging situation, which is another strength. However, it
has also limitations. The study did not gather important characteristics of the study
participants, such as educational status, marital status and visiting public places, smoking etc
that could affect knowledge on COVID19. Further, the initial assessment was done as part of
the routine COVID-19 response rather than specifically for this study.
Conclusion

The study pointed out that respondents had moderate knowledge about transmission modes,
preventions mechanisms and practice on the prevention of COVID-19 areas of high risk in
Addis Ababa. Awareness creation programs on more targeted groups, such as men, youth and
those with higher incomes are required in order to improve the knowledge and practices on
the prevention of COVID 19. Advocacy of the hand hygiene, physical distancing, use of
mask and others strategies should fulfil the characteristics of the targeted individuals.
