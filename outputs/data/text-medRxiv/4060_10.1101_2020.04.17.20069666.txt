ABSTRACT: The aim of our study was to predict the epidemic curves (daily new cases) of
COVID-19 pandemic using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs), then to compare and validate the predicted models with the observed data. We used the
publicly available datasets from the World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins University to
create a training dataset, then we used RNNs with gated recurring units (Long Short-Term
Memory) to create two prediction models. Information collected in the first t time-steps were
aggregated with a fully connected (dense) neural network layer and a consequent regression
output layer to determine the next predicted value. We also used Root Mean Squared
Logarithmic Errors (RMSLE) to compare the predicted models with the observed data. The
result of our study underscores that the COVID-19 pandemic is a propagated source epidemic,
therefore repeated peaks on the epidemic curve are to be anticipated. Besides, the errors between
the predicted and validated data and trends seems to be low. The influence of this pandemic is
significant worldwide and has already impacted our daily life. Decision makers must be aware,
that even if strict public health measures are executed and sustained, future peaks of infections
are possible.

1.INTRODUCTION
1.1 Coronavirus
High and low pathogenic species may be distinguished within the coronavirus family, with the
former including 4 viruses that are responsible for 10-30% of mild upper respiratory diseases
(e.g. common cold), and the latter known to cause a more severe form of acute lung injury:
SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome) [1]. SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong Province, China, and started to spread in
2002, causing over 8,000 cases in 29 countries around the world, with a crude fatality rate of
10% [2–4]. The virus has spread to Hong Kong in 2003 causing an outbreak of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS). A novel coronavirus was isolated and was suggested to be the
primary cause of the infections [5]. A few years later, in 2007 Cheng et. al issued a warning that
“the presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the
culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb” [4]. MERS-CoV began
spreading in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and, to the time of writing this, has led to a total of 2519
laboratory-confirmed cases in several countries around the world [6,7]. Its case-fatality rate
reached 37.1% over the course of the past 8 years [7].

1.2 Coronavirus Disease – 2019 (COVID-19)
The current form of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome noted as COVID-19, is
caused by a new variant of formerly known highly pathogenic Coronaviridae. The infection
allegedly began to spread from a market in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China, at the
end of 2019 [8,9]. Early genome sequencing has found that the new virus, which was named
SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, showed a 79.6%
homology with SARS-CoV, and has 96% sequence identity with bat coronavirus suggesting a
common origin from SARSr-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus). Also,
the suspected host was thought to be a bat species, Rhinolophus affinis (a horseshoe bat), but the
SARS-COV-2 probably needs an intermediate host [9,10].

Symptoms associated with the COVID-19 include fever (83%), cough (82%), shortness of breath
(31%), muscle aches (11%), confusion (9%), headache (8%), sore throat (5%), runny nose, chest
pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting [11]. According to a meta-analysis that compiled data from
more than 50 000 patients, the incidence of fever (0.891, 95% confidence interval (CI): [0.818;
0.945]) and cough (incidence of 0.722, 95% CI: [0.657; 0.782]) were the highest, respectively,
followed by muscle soreness and fatigue [12]. The incubation period of the virus was estimated
to be between 1-14 days (5 days on average) [13]. There is no definite data concerning the
transmissibility of the virus. However, several transmission routes have been identified including
respiratory droplets/aerosols, direct contact with virally-contaminated objects, and possibly
fecal-oral transmission [14].
It seems probable that those with a fulminant disease are most infectious, but reports have
identified asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic virus shedding as well. There is also a lack of
definite data regarding tertiary and quaternary spreading among humans, but it seems probable
that the person who has been exposed to the infection has acquired some (at least temporary)
immunity [15]. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), there were
91,816,091 confirmed cases and 1,986,871 fatalities globally as of January 15, 2021, which
corresponds to a case-fatality rate of 2.164% [16].
R0, the basic reproduction number, denoting the transmissibility of a virus that indicates
the average number of new infections induced by an infectious person in a susceptible, infection
naïve population. The transmissibility of the virus was apparently underestimated initially by the
WHO with R0 suggested to range between 1.4 and 2.5. More recent reports have indicated
higher R0 values around 3 (with the mean and median R0 for published estimates being 3.28 and
2.79, respectively) [13,17].

1.3 The Daily Number of Newly Diagnosed Infections - Epidemic Curves
The initial epidemic curves of the COVID-19 outbreak from Hubei, China showed a
mixed pattern, indicating that early cases were likely from a continuous common source e.g.,
from several zoonotic events in Wuhan, followed by secondary and tertiary transmission
providing a propagated source for the later cases [18].
The propagated (or progressive source) epidemic curve visualizes the spread of an
infectious agent that may be transmitted from human to human starting from with a single index
case, that continues to further infect other individuals. This shows up as a series of peaks on the
epidemic curve, that starts with the index case, followed by successive waves of the infection set
apart with respect to the incubation period of the pathogen. The waves continue to follow each
other, until appropriate mitigation measures, prevention, or treatment are implemented, or the
pool of the susceptible population becomes infected. This is a theoretic curve, that is generally
influenced by lots of other factors [18].
Several studies investigated the impact of different interventions with respect to
minimizing contact rates in the population in order to slow the infection spread, minimize
COVID-19 mortality rates and health care utilization, or to suppress the epidemic per se.
Flattening the curve by reducing peak incidence may limit overall case fatality rates.
Nevertheless, most of the forecasts and simulations thus far started out from Bell-shaped curves,
that fail to account for the progressive nature of the current outbreak given the known secondary,
tertiary even quaternary transmissibility of the virus. Taking this into account it is suggested that
the number of cases will rise once again after pandemic control measures are no longer in effect
[19].

1.4 Prediction
There are different mathematical models that may demonstrate and predict the dynamics of
different infectious diseases [20]. These models, used to simulate the dynamics of infectious
diseases, may be based on statistical, mathematical, empirical, or machine learning methods [21].

The first attempts to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medicine were made in the 1970s.
Initially, AI was used to implement programs to help clinical decision-making, but to date, its
use is gaining more and more widespread acceptance in biomedical sciences [22]. One class of
AI, a form of artificial neural networks, the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) were previously used to model and forecast the influenza epidemic, with
strong competitiveness and reliable results [23–25].

1.5 Aim of the Study
The current study aimed to use the publicly available official COVID-19 data as a training
dataset, to predict the possible outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic (epidemic curve of new
cases) using AI-based RNNs, and further, to compare the predictions with the observed data.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Data
We used the publicly available datasets from the WHO and Johns Hopkins University for
the following countries to create the training dataset: Austria, Belgium, China (Hubei) , Czech
Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Iran, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia,
Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA) [15,26].
Given that most infected people in China were from Hubei province, only data from that
province was included. For each country, the date of the first reported infection was set as Day 1
for the disease time scale. (Figure 1).

When determining the date of the first illness, point-source outbreaks were omitted (e.g.,
those cases where single verified cases were isolated, and no further transmission has occurred).
This was important to avoid distortion of the propagated epidemic curves. In Belgium, for
example, the first illness occurred on February 02, 2020 and there were no further cases reported
for up to 26 days. The next illness occurred on March 01, 2020. Inclusion of the early case from
February would contribute to a false learning rule for the AI, hence corrupting the results. As for
Hubei Province, the first officially available data is of January 22, 2020. This cannot be
considered as the first day of the illness, thus the first infection was arbitrarily defined to occur
on January 01, 2020. To account for the extreme variability of daily incident cases reported
which probably reflects delays in reporting procedures, a moving average was used (covering 3
days) for the Hubei dataset.

Accordingly, an epidemic curve was obtained for each country with a time series where
the first day denotes the day of the first confirmed case, and each successive day indicating the
number of newly confirmed cases that day. To account for the country-specific differences in the
size of the population, the number of daily new cases was normalized for 100.000 inhabitants in
each country. The observation period varies for each country, given the difference of time
elapsed since the disease initiation in that country. Accordingly, the longest time series covers
the observation period of 90 days. e.g., in Hubei, with the first 22 days lacking valid data and the
next 68 days having data. The shortest observation period was in Slovenia with only 30 days.

The training data set was obtained by averaging the daily incidence rates per 100 000
inhabitants across the 17 countries included, for each day in the time series. When calculating the
average, missing data was left blank, i.e., NULL, e.g., countries that did not contain data for a
specific day were excluded from the calculation of average. The resulting training data set is
shown in Figure 1. It should be noted that the first part of the data set (up to the initial 30 days
since Day 1 of the epidemic) contains data for almost all the countries listed, whereas the end of
the data set contains only data from Hubei. (Figure 2)

2.2 RNNs-Based Model for Prediction
The state-of-the-art for time series analysis is AI-based analytic tools, which have the best
est
prediction performance. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are specifically designed to cope
pe
with sequential input, characteristic of textual or temporal data [24]. This architecture is a neural
ral
network-based architecture, that contains hidden layers chained according to the time step, with a
possibility to predict the next sequence element(s). A time series has a special temporal form,
m,
where the input to the i-th hidden layer is at the i-th time-step that has a corresponding x(i)
(i)
observation. In its original form, a simple RNN tries to predict the next sequence element,
nt,
however, for the purposes of the current analysis, an encoder-decoder variant is a more natural
ral
choice, similarly to machine translation [27].

For our specific scenario this means that during the encoder phase including time steps
ps
1,…,t the RNN is fed with the already known time series data (the average of the number of new
ew
cases normalized to 100 000 inhabitants for day 1…t, respectively), followed by prediction in the
he
decoder phase for the future time steps t+1,…,T. In our analysis, T=t+1=90 days is the longest
est
known (Hubei) time interval. Since this covers quite a long data sequence, we have used gated
ed
recurring units (namely Long Short-Term Memory – LSTM units) in compliance with the
he
general recommendations [25]. Figure 3 depicts our RNN architecture showing how unknown
n
time series elements are predicted. Figure 3 also shows how the information collected in the first
rst
t time-steps are aggregated with a fully connected (dense) neural network layer and a consequent
nt
regression output layer to determine a predicted number of new patients as x(t+1).

The training data was described in the previous section. To assess possible specificities
regarding the countries two approaches were used for prediction:

•Prediction 1: An algorithm to update the training step and subsequent prediction was
formulated. This update step is based on the general recommendations of transfer learning that
considers the already known time interval for the given country and re-training is done in small
increments of the RNN network accordingly [28]. Thus, we start predicting the first unknown
element x(t+1) from the last 5% of the known data, and the same principle is applied to each
subsequent element. Moreover, after each prediction step our RNN architecture was re-trained
and the subsequent elements were predicted with this updated RNN.

•Prediction 2: We start predicting the first unknown element x(t+1) from the last known x(t),
and all the subsequent elements are predicted only from the preceding ones. Here the rules
depicted from the training data set are used, not retraining occurs.

The intuitive interpretations of the difference between Prediction 1 and Prediction 2 are
as follows. Prediction 2 makes its predictions utilizing the information derived from the training
data set, reflective of the trends in the average time series. It follows that predictions will comply
primarily with the Hubei time series, especially in the far future. Therefore Prediction 2 shows
the highest fidelity to the country-specific future scenario if the approach to mitigate the
epidemic is similar to that in Hubei. Accordingly, this scenario is also reflective of a countryspecific future state given the practices of Hubei were followed in said country. On the other
hand, Prediction 1 is yielded after the neural network is retrained after any prediction, providing
more valid insight into what is expected if the country goes on with the mitigation practices seen
during the observation period. The architecture was trained in 250 epochs with a total number of
100 hidden LSTM layers, to prepare a bit for prediction also after T=90 days. Naturally, the
length of the RNN can be freely increased later.

2.3 Validation
For the learning dataset, we used the data from the first pandemic wave. That is, we took
the available factual data from the first case reported in a country until April 10, 2020. Based on
that, we have made the above mentioned two predictions (1 and 2). Moreover, for the validation
process, we used the factual data of the first wave. By country, we considered 85-90 days from
the first case reported. Thus, the number of days predicted varied from country to country in the
same way as for the learning dataset. The amount of Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Errors
(RMSLE) was used for validation. In our analysis, the possible bias regarding the different ratios
between the observed and predicted values are interpreted using the RMSLE. Let n be the
number of days used for validation. Let p_1i and p_2i be the number of new cases per day
obtained using the two prediction methods in the examined time interval and let a_i be the actual
data for the given days. Err1 and Err2 will be RMSLE for Prediction 1 and Prediction 2,
respectively, where:

3. RESULTS
This section shows the outcomes for Prediction 1 and Prediction 2 for the individual
country-level data for France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, USA, and UK (Figures 4-10).
For each main graph, the small graph in the upper right corner contains the daily error values
calculated for the predictions. The more accurate the prediction, the smaller the RMSLE error. It
should be noted that if the error function is parallel to the x-axis, it means that the trend of the
prediction is the same as the real trend, only at a lower or higher scale. Also, the total errors for
the entire investigated period, the summarized mean of the predictions (RMSLE) by country, is
shown in Table 1.

4. DISCUSSION
The current COVID-19 pandemic has opened avenues for more effective and efficient
application of AI in various aspects of fighting and tackling infectious diseases. At the early
stage of the COVID-19 outbreak when little data were available regarding the nature and
transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, modelling studies have attempted to predict the epidemic
outcomes using Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, based on data from
Wuhan, China ; the starting point of the outbreak [29]. Besides, forecasting and predicting the
COVID-19 trajectories was not the only application of AI during the current pandemic. AI has
been adopted in contact-tracing , tracking public health behaviors, and currently in COVID-19
vaccination [30,31]. Since March 2020, we have had the opportunity in our present study to use
the declared numbers of daily new cases of COVID-19 to predict our models and to compare the
predicted trajectories with the observed data. In countries that imposed strict measures (e.g.,

strict lockdown), for example, France, Hungary, Italy, and Spain, the predicted models and
observed data were closely similar, however, this was not the case of the UK and the USA. This
could be attributed to the fact that the learning dataset was based mainly on data from Hubei
province where a strict total lockdown was imposed there, unlike the UK and the USA. Besides,
we can notice in the models that Prediction 1 is more accurate for some countries (Hungary,
Italy, UK, USA), while Prediction 2 is more accurate for others (France, Germany, Spain).
The findings of our study underscores that the COVID-19 pandemic is a propagated
source outbreak, therefore repeated peaks on the epidemic curve (rise of the daily number of
newly diagnosed infections) are to be anticipated. Predictions that were made using AI-based
RNNs further implicate that albeit the majority of investigated countries are near or over the
peak of the curve, they should prepare for a series of successively high peaks in the near future,
until all susceptible people will be infected by the SARS-CoV-2, or effective preventive (e.g.,
vaccination) or treatment options will become available and utilized effectively. These scenarios
are similar to other known propagated source epidemics, e.g., SARS and measles [32].
Albeit suppression and mitigation measures can reduce the incidence of infection,
COVID-19 disease, given its relatively high transmissibility reflected by average R0 values of
3.28, will continue to spread, most likely [16]. Accordingly, public health measures must be
implemented as the incubation period of the virus may be long (1-14 days, but there are some
opinions, that this can be 21 days), during which time asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic
spreading may ensue. Moreover, currently it is uncertain, whether those, who were diagnosed
with COVID-19 infection, will acquire sufficient immunity or not [13]. Finally, data from
countries with warm climates suggest that summer is unlikely to stop the pandemic, as the virus
already spreading in Australia and South Africa as well [15,19]. This is why the recurrence of
another peak is very likely, and the end of the pandemic cannot be accurately predicted at this
time.
Nevertheless, recent publications showed that the earlier the mitigation attempts are in
place (e.g., border closure, closing schools, the lockdown of the country, curfew), the more
effective is the reduction of the spread of the epidemic [19]. In fact, analyzing the effects of a
suppression strategy concerning the COVID-19, it was shown that early implementation of
suppression at 0.2 deaths per 100 000 population per week could save 30.7 million lives

compared to late implementation of these measures at 1.6 deaths per 100 000 population per
week [33]. This seems to be the case in the countries, which had prior knowledge regarding
coronavirus infections (e.g., China, Singapore, Hong Kong), as they were more prepared to
implement public health measures, had more equipment and health care personnel in place to
mitigate the spread of the infections. Those countries, that failed to implement efficient and strict
mitigation policies in a timely manner, were facing difficulty in controlling the spread of the
disease, as is the case of Italy, the UK and the USA [16].
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to model the predicted evolution of
the newly diagnosed infections using data from official databases with the help of the AI-based
RNNs trained on the currently available data, which were validated by RMSLE calculation. Most
studies to date expect a single peak of the epidemic curve, but some fear the emergence of future
peaks when mitigation-suppression measures will be discontinued. According to our model, this
can even happen, if strict measures are sustained.
Nevertheless, the are some limitations in our study. As the nature of SARS-COV-2 is
relatively unknown or dynamic, and it is prone to mutations, the prediction of the spread of the
pandemic is not an easy mission. Factors that influenced the reported new cases per day, for
example, the efficiency of reporting, the different quality and timing of public health measures,
country-specific age-pyramid, and chronic disease burden of the population were not included in
our training data set due to lack of reliable data. We did not investigate the number of deaths and
recoveries, as we found no reliable data at that time. Similarly, the data regarding diagnostic tests
performed per country, or death rates were omitted, given they are highly influenced by the
countries’ economic wellbeing, health care systems, facilities and capacities, and other factors
[34,35]. There are lots of unforeseen uncertainties and coincidences which could not be
implemented in our model, for example, there were days when a large number of people have
been diagnosed with COVID-19 on one day (for example in care homes in France or Hungary)
that caused a large increase in the number of the daily new cases [16].
To summarize, the COVID-19 disease is a global health challenge, which forced the
WHO to declare it a “public health emergency of international concern on 30/01/2020” and later
as a global pandemic [18]. The influence of this global epidemic has dug deep into the day-today conduct of everyone, with unforeseen challenges still pending for governments and

policymakers. Starting from this, everyone, especially decision-makers must be aware, that the
current situation might be just the beginning, and even if strict public health measures are
executed and sustained, future peaks of infections are possible.

5. CONCLUSION
The findings of our study underscore that the COVID-19 pandemic is a propagated
source epidemic, therefore repeated peaks of the rise of the daily number of newly diagnosed
infections are to be anticipated. In countries where strict control measures were imposed, the
predicted models were closely similar to the observed data. Most studies to date expect a single
peak on the epidemic curve, but some fear the emergence of future peaks when mitigationsuppression measures will be discontinued. According to our models, this can even happen, if
strict measures are sustained. The AI-based predictions might be useful tools and can be
recalculated according to the newly observed data to get a more precise forecast of the pandemic.
Finally, AI-based predictions are expected to provide public health practitioners and decision
makers with sufficient data that would be useful in improving countries’ preparedness to the next
stage of a pandemic.
