Abstract
In analogy to influenza the second wave of the CoVid-19 disease is generally considered as being triggered by
cooling-down in autumn and enhanced aerosol distribution. Here, the time histories of the total case numbers in
three European states are quantitatively compared with those of Argentina by a generally applicable fit procedure.
It turns out that Argentina on the southern hemisphere sees the second wave simultaneously with similar
parameters as Europe. This discards the assumption of the influence of atmospheric cooling in winter and puts into
question present models of SARS-CoV-2 spreading.

Keywords: CoVid-19, SARS-CoV-2, Argentina, Europe, temperature dependence, infection rate, case numbers,

1 Introduction
The case numbers of the CoVid-19 disease are of worldwide interest and large effort is made to understand
infection mechanisms and reduce infection rates. The person to person SARS-CoV-2 transfer by aerosols is
considered to be dominant. According to general assumptions, this mechanism is enhanced when weather is
cooling down and people spend more time inside closed buildings (1). The rapid increase of the infection rates in
many countries since October 2020, addressed as “second wave”, is attributed to increasing aerosol transfer
similarly to observations on influenza (2).

Data analysis proceeds often via compartment models which define different groups such as susceptible (S),
infected (I) and recovered (R) individuals, and others. The flow between these groups is governed by equations
analogous to chemical kinetics, mostly for first “reaction” order. Only the infection rate is proportional to the
product of infected and susceptible, and the respective equation (eq (1) in (3)) is a second order process. This
model describes outbreaks of a virus where the number I0 of infected persons is small at the beginning, and finally
affects the full group of susceptible persons S.

The comparison of different countries and various outbreaks in these countries has to proceed via few significant
free parameters, and here a modified SIR model is applied. The total case number in each country is decomposed
into a sum of outbreaks N, and each outbreak is fitted by a single logistic function, which describes the infection
of only a part SN of the total population of this country by I 0,N of initially infected persons.

It was shown earlier that a similar approach can be applied to many states (4). Here, France, Germany, Spain and
Argentina are considered: Germany and France have similar starting conditions, and Spain as a third European
state has a significantly warmer climate, especially different in autumn from Germany, and thus should be less
affected by the second wave. Argentina on the southern hemisphere goes in October and November from winter
to summer while the three European countries see cooling from summer to winter. Here it is claimed that data
from countries on the southern and northern hemisphere are very similar, and that this is not consistent with the
omnipresent assumption of enhanced virus spreading in colder seasons.

2 Method
Each outbreak N is fitted by a single logistic function, as described earlier in (4):
𝐼𝑁 (𝑡) =

𝑆𝑁
𝑆
1+( 𝑁 −1)∙𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑡⁄𝜏𝑁 )

(1)

𝐼0,𝑁

This well-known expression is the solution of the simple compartment model SIR (3). It is adapted to the observed
case numbers and infection rates from very different countries by varying only a few parameters (Table 1):
1) 𝐼0,𝑁 ≪ 𝑆𝑁 is the number of individuals triggering a new outbreak N.
2) The time constant 𝜏𝑁 of usually a few days has two implications:
- During the first days an exponential increase of both case number and infection rate is seen, and the often cited
doubling time is related to 𝜏𝑁 by 𝜏2,𝑁 = 𝜏𝑁 ∙ 𝑙𝑛(2).
- Later, increase is significantly slower than exponential and the case number and infection rate asymptotically
attain a constant value 𝑆𝑁 and zero, respectively. The time scale of the outbreak is also determined by 𝜏𝑁 .
3) 𝑆𝑁 is the maximum number of infected persons at infinite time in a given outbreak, i.e. the whole group, which
is in reach of the initially infected 𝐼0,𝑁 . In the simplest case, 𝑆𝑁 is as high as the total population P of the respective
country (cf. (5)). Social distancing limits the total number of individuals, which may be attained by the initially
infected group. This, in the modified SIR-model, 𝑆𝑁 in each outbreak is much smaller than P, and
𝑥𝑁 = 𝑆𝑁 /𝑃 ≪ 1. The second order rate constant 𝑘2,𝑁 of the SIR model (cf. 𝜆 in (3)) is given as 𝑘2,𝑁 =

1
𝜏𝑁 ∙𝑆𝑁

(in

days-1·susceptible persons-1).

Each outbreak N is described independently by a new logistic function 𝐼𝑁 (𝑡), and distinct outbreaks of the virus
are assigned to the observed data. Previously (4), outbreaks were considered separately in single time intervals. A
first outbreak, N=0, showed purely exponential increase and was quickly interrupted after a few days. Sufficient
data are now available for consistent fits over the whole time from end of January to mid-November. It thus turned
out that the further outbreaks N=1-4 do not occur consecutively, but may also overlap on the time scale, and that
the case numbers 𝐼𝑁 (𝑡) add up to the total case number 𝐼(𝑡) :
𝐼(𝑡) = ∑4𝑁=1 𝐼𝑁 (𝑡) = ∑4𝑖=1
𝑃𝑁 = (

𝑆𝑁

𝐼𝑁 (𝑡0,𝑁 )

𝑆𝑁
1+𝑃𝑁 ∙𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑡⁄𝜏𝑁 )

(2)

− 1) ∙ 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑡0,𝑁 ⁄𝜏𝑁 ) is used as fit parameter, and the number of infected persons triggering the start

of the wave N is estimated as 𝐼0,𝑁 = 𝐼𝑁 (𝑡0,𝑁 ) =

𝑆𝑁
1+𝑃𝑁 ∙𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑡0;𝑁 ⁄𝜏𝑁 )

4) The additional parameter 𝑡0,𝑁 is introduced since the outbreaks start at different times. It is determined as the
date, when the observed total case number and infection rate significantly increase with respect to the respective
calculated sums of the previous waves 1..N-1.

3 Results and Discussion
The observed total case numbers yield fairly smooth curves (Figure 1) , and in many cases steps indicating a new
outbreak are clearly visible. Even though a very simple model with few parameters (table 1) is underlying, the
observed data are well fitted by equation (2). It is possible to extrapolate the curves over short times. By early
identifying the deviation of observed data from the fit of the previous outbreaks (1..N-1), a spontaneous new
outbreak N can be predicted.
Daily infection rates oscillate with a seven days period and are subjected to strong noise due to fluctuations in data
collection (Figure 2). Calculating the day to day differences of this rate effectively yields the second derivative of
the total case number, which is an extremely rough function. In media presentation the problem of weekly
fluctuation is reduced either by showing a seven days running average, or by evaluating rate differences not
between consecutive days, but between a day and the same weekday in the week before. In any case statistical
noise is obscured by the weekly oscillations. The procedure adopted here circumvents this problem by fitting the
rather smooth total case number by an analytic function and then evaluating the infection rate as a smooth curve
from the fit. The infection rate is essentially the first derivative of the total case number as a function of time, and
shows a bell shaped structure for each outbreak.

Figures 1 and 2 and table 1 show plots and parameters for fitting the observed data by so far five outbreaks:
(1) N=0: The strictly exponential increase was interrupted after a few weeks in March by any form of social
distancing in all countries before a significant deviation from the exponential increase or a saturation were
recognizable. I0,0 was very low, but infection could have gone to very high numbers of 𝑆0 ≈ 𝑃 as provided in
the original SIR-approach. The time constants were 3-4 days, the doubling time then only 2.3-3 days.

The following four outbreaks all took place under conditions of social distancing. A few weeks after the beginning
t0,N, the additional case number IN(t) clearly drops below the initially exponential increase (4). The time N is
significantly higher for N=1-4 than for N=0, and the outbreaks continue independently:

(2) N=1: The first short outbreak after lock down or other measures started end of February or beginning of March
2020, and affected only a few tenth of percent of the population in Europe, whereas S1 was even nearly
negligible in Argentina (cf. Fig 1a). Without the sequence of continuing spontaneous outbreaks, the pandemic
should have ended in June 2020 (6). From the point of kinetics, this outbreak still had rather short time constants
and high rate constants of around six days and 10-6, respectively.

(3) N=2: The N=1 outbreak was immediately followed by a next one starting April to June. The case numbers in
this time were often ascribed to a release of the Anti-Corona measures. The initial number of infected people
was significant (I0,2 of a 5-30 thousand), but the total number of infections only moderately increased by about
0.1% of the population in Europe. Only in Argentina, which had seen small impact of the N=1 outbreak, the
case number was higher, around 1%. The time scale of this outbreak is considerably longer than of the previous
one (2,N around 20 days), but the rate constant is still of the order of 10-6 in Europe.

(4) N=3, 4: After a calm period in May and June, two severe outbreaks were observed in late summer/winter and
early autumn/spring without having an obvious origin. Both overlap each other in a similar way in Argentina,
France and Spain (Figures 2a, c, d). In Germany the outbreak N=3 had small impact, (x3=0.2%), and therefore
the rapid increase of infection rate in October became very obvious. These two outbreaks together are
considered here as a quantitative description of the “second wave”.

The numbers of initially infected persons of I0,3 and I0,4 are in a similar range of 2-50.000. The final values S3
and S4 during the second wave are significantly higher than S1, S2 immediately after the first measures in
March. Thus, x3 and x4 are around 1-2% of the total population, and add up to an infection of 1.1-3% of the
respective total population.

All rate constants k2,3 and k2,4 were close to 10-7 and thus significantly lower than for N=1 or 2. It may be
speculated that this indicates people being more cautious than in the beginning of the pandemic. The outbreak
N=3 started end of July till mid-August in the four considered countries with a similar time scale of 3 around
15-25 days as N=2. N=4 started in the first half of October even more synchronously in the four countries than
the previous outbreaks. It has a smaller time scale with 4 around 10 days and contributed mainly to the rapidly
increasing high infection rates and incidences in October and November 2020.

4 Conclusion
A thorough quantitative analysis shows that the total case numbers and infection rates are not only described as
first and second wave, but that a total of five outbreaks has to be distinguished so far. They typically start with a
small number of infected persons, in the beginning few 100, later with in increasing number I0,N up to 50.000.
During the infection process, the total case numbers typically increase by a factor of ten; but the ratio SN/I0,N varies
in a large range, as I0,N is not very strictly defined by the fit procedure.

In many cases, new outbreaks start parallel to previous ones, while these still generate significant infection rates.
The spontaneous appearance of new infection outbreaks with high initial case numbers shows that measures such
as the lock down earlier in 2020 had had no definite success.

In large countries outbreaks from different regions could be shifted with respect to each other, and their
superposition could scramble the data to be fitted. It has been shown in (4) that this is not the case. Obviously the
outbreaks are correlated even under conditions of reduced personal exchange. Thus, new outbreaks start
spontaneously, but simultaneously in different countries.

The fits (Figure 1) yield a fairly stable prognosis as long as only existing breakouts are continued. From the noisy
infection rate data, this is possible alone only with large computational effort, if at all (7). Prognosis on a longer
timescale and for the end of the infection spreading is not possible due to spontaneous outbreaks.

Here, case numbers and infection rates of Argentina were compared with respective data from Europe. The main
point to make is that the second wave occurs in a country on the southern hemisphere on a quite similar time scale
and with similar incidences as in European countries of comparable sizes. As Argentina now sees the transition
from winter to summer rather than from summer to winter as in Europe, this similarity discards the common theory
that the second wave is due to autumn cooling. Moreover, the second wave should have larger impact in Germany
than in Spain, where the climate in autumn still is rather mild. The opposite is observed, the country is far more
severely hit than Germany. These observations leads to the speculative question, if the person to person transfer
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in aerosols is indeed the only efficient infection mechanism. As nearly all measures in
