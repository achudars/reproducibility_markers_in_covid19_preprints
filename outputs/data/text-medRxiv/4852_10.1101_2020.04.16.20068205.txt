KEY POINTS
Question: What is the current evidence for use of Hydroxychloroquine in pharmacotherapy of
COVID-19?
Findings: We electronically explored various databases and clinical trial registries and identified
11 publications and 27 clinical trials with active recruitment. The in-vitro study data
demonstrates the viral inhibition by hydroxychloroquine. The clinical studies are weakly
designed and conducted with insufficient reporting and significant limitations. Well designed
robust clinical trials are being conducted all over the world and results of few such robust
studies are expected shortly.
Meaning: Current evidence stands inadequate to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in
pharmacotherapy of COVID-19.

ABSTRACT
Importance: The COVID-19 Pandemic has literally left the world breathless in the chase for
pharmacotherapy. With vaccine and novel drug development in early clinical trials, repurposing
of existing drugs takes the center stage.
Objective: A potential drug discussed in global scientific community is hydroxychloroquine. We
intend to systematically explore, analyze, rate the existing evidence of hydroxychloroquine in
the light of published, unpublished and clinical trial data.
Evidence review: PubMed Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google scholar databases, pre-proof article
repositories, clinical trial registries were comprehensively searched with focused question of
use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. The literature was systematically explored as
per PRISMA guidelines.
Findings: Total 156 articles were available as of 7th May 2020; of which 11 articles of relevance
were analyzed. Three in-vitro studies were reviewed. Two open label non-randomized trials,
two open label randomized control trials, one large observational study, one follow-up study
and two retrospective cohort studies were systematically analyzed and rated by oxford CEBM
and GRADE framework for quality and strength of evidence. Also 27 clinical trials registered in
three clinical trial registries were analyzed and summarized. Hydroxychloroquine seems to be
efficient in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in in-vitro cell lines. However, there is lack of strong evidence
from human studies. It was found that overall quality of available evidence ranges from ‘very
low’ to ‘low’.

Conclusions and relevance: The in-vitro cell culture based data of viral inhibition does not
suffice for the use of hydroxychloroquine in the patients with COVID-19. Current literature
shows inadequate, low level evidence in human studies. Scarcity of safety and efficacy data
warrants medical communities, health care agencies and governments across the world against
the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment, until robust
evidence becomes available.

Introduction
The ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected most of the countries
in the world with unimagined infectious disease morbidity and mortality. As per WHO (as of 7th
May, 2020), there has been a total of 3,672,238 confirmed cases and 254,045 deaths due to
COVID-19 worldwide.1 However, no specific drug has been approved for the treatment of
COVID-19 except the latest FDA emergency approval of remdesivir for use in severe cases.
Recent updates indicate the vaccine quest is at least a year away. Building on experience from
past Ebola and MERS pandemics, various human trials on novel pharmacotherapeutics are in
progress.2 Drugs such as remdesivir and favipiravir are in exploratory phases of clinical trials.3
More than 20 other drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, human
immunoglobulin, arbidol, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, interferons and
traditional Chinese medicines are aimed at repositioning for COVID-19 treatment.4 Forerunners
among these are antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, used extensively in
treatment of malaria and elsewhere since many decades.5,6 These drugs are 4-aminoquinoline
derivatives exhibiting wide range of in-vitro activity against viruses. Their antiviral efficacy has
been attributed to many different mechanisms.7 Chloroquine is known to possess considerable
broad-spectrum antiviral effects by interfering with the fusion process of viruses by increasing
the local pH.8Other mechanisms include raise in endosomal pH in host cells thereby inhibiting
auto-lysosome fusion and disrupting the enzymes needed for the viral replication. 9,10
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is synthesized by N-hydroxyethyl side chain substitution of
chloroquine. Although the antimalarial activity of HCQ is equivalent to that of chloroquine, HCQ
is preferred over chloroquine owing to its lower ocular toxicity.11It is also used in the treatment

of rheumatoid arthritis, chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, and systemic lupus
erythematosus. In addition to endosomal pH increase, HCQ is also said to inhibit terminal
glycosylation of ACE2 receptor, considered as target of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cell
entry.12The non-glycosylated ACE2 receptor might interact inefficiently with the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein, thus inhibiting the viral entry.13These myriad mechanisms of HCQ and its relative
lesser toxicity profile as compared to chloroquine make it an attractive candidate in the pursuit
of drug repositioning. In this highly demanding scenario of unmet need and steeply increasing
morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, many government bodies and expert panels have
recommended the use of chloroquine and HCQ for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.14-18
In such situation of urgency, there is a need to explore the current literature and critically
analyze the existing evidence. We intend to conduct a detailed systematic search analysis of
current literature and propose our findings.
Materials and methods
Data sources
A comprehensive literature search was done independently by each author to find the role of
HCQ in COVID-19 disease. PubMed Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google scholar databases were
searched for existing literature from 2019 to 7th May 2020, 2020. The clinical trial Registries of
the United States (clinicaltrials.gov), Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, WHO International clinical
trial registry platform (ICTRP) were searched for ongoing registered studies. For preprint/preproof articles, repositories like BioRxiv, MedRxiv and ChemRxiv were searched.

Literature search
Search words included MeSH Terms (hydroxychloroquine OR HCQ) AND (COVID-19 OR
Coronavirus OR nCov2 OR SARS-CoV2). We searched for both published and unpublished
studies extensively. No language, time, study type and demographic filters were used. The
search expansion was done using a snowballing method applied to the authors and references
of selected publications. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Article search included abstracts,
original

experimental

studies,

studies

and

controlled/uncontrolled trials. We excluded the articles like news items, magazine pieces,
duplicate papers, review articles, editorials and letters to editor, expert opinions, perspectives,
consensus statements and articles without the mention of the role of HCQ in COVID-19 or HCQ
use in other conditions.
We searched databases of clinical trial registries using the search terms ‘Hydroxychloroquine’,
‘HCQ’, ‘Plaquenil’, ‘COVID-19’, ‘SARS-CoV2’, ‘novel Corona virus’ ‘nCoV 2’. After identification
and elimination of duplicated appearances, 96 clinical trials were found to be registered. Each
database was further scanned and analyzed to remove the non-recruiting, inactive and
cancelled trials, finally yielding 27 randomized control trials (RCTs) currently undergoing active
recruitment for COVID-19 treatment with HCQ.

Screening, data extraction, data analysis, critical appraisal and evidence rating
Screening of articles was done independently by investigators according to titles, abstracts,
summaries and conclusions. Methodical data extraction was done from selected articles and
pertinent portions were identified, tabulated and presented systematically in the form of tables
&summary. Randomized clinical trials with active recruitment were analyzed after collecting
publically available information on various clinical trial databases. We used GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) framework methodology to
rate the certainty of evidence from both published and unpublished clinical studies and Oxford
center for evidence based medicine (CEBM) to assess and rate the quality of evidence.
Results
Total 156 articles were identified on initial search of databases. Following screening of titles and
abstracts and removal of duplicates, eleven articles (three in-vitro studies, two open label nonrandomized trials, two open label randomized control trials, one large observational study, one
follow-up study, two retrospective cohort studies) were selected for further data extraction and
analyses. Out of these 11, four clinical studies (one open label randomized control trial, one
open label non-randomized trial and two retrospective cohort studies) were from pre-print
servers. We also identified 96 clinical trials registered in three clinical trial registry databases.
Methodical screening and analysis further yielded 27 RCTs currently undergoing active
recruitment.

In vitro studies of Hydroxychloroquine demonstrating anti-coronaviral activity
Yao et al, assessed the pharmacological activity of chloroquine and HCQ using SARS-CoV-2
infected Vero cells. Further as continued part of the study, they simulated physiologically-based
pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) on the in vitro data obtained. The researchers found HCQ to be
more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS -CoV-2 in vitro. Based on PBPK extrapolation,
they recommended a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of HCQ sulfate given orally, followed
by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days.19
In another correspondence report letter of an in vitro study by Liu et al, the investigators used
VeroE6 cells and compared the antiviral activity of chloroquine versus HCQ against SARS-CoV-2
to determine different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) by quantification of viral RNA copy
numbers. They found out that 50% maximal effective concentration (EC50) for HCQ was
significantly higher than chloroquine and HCQ can efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in
vitro.20
Previously in 2006, French researchers demonstrated that chloroquine and HCQ effectively
inhibit both human and feline SARS COV in the infected Vero cells. EC50 for HCQ was
significantly higher than chloroquine.21 (Table 1)

Clinical studies conducted in COVID-19 patients
In the positive background of successful in vitro data and in the situation of an emerging
epidemic, the Chinese authorities issued a consensus statement for the use of chloroquine in
COVID-19 patients.14The earliest data of chloroquine administration in humans came from
various parts of China in the form of collective reports were published by Gao et al. 22 The
authors reported clinical experience data of treating more than 100 patients with chloroquine
in various locations. They mentioned that chloroquine reduced the duration of illness and
improved the pneumonia and pulmonary image changes in COVID-19 positive patients. The
authors also recommended the drug to be included in the COVID-19 Guidelines issued by the
National Health Commission of China for the use of drug in larger populations.23
The first empirical evidence of use of HCQ in humans was obtained by a small RCT conducted by
Chen et al24 in 30 adult COVID-19 patients. The treatment group received 400mg HCQ for 5
days, while the standard care was given to control group. The primary outcome was
nasopharyngeal swab test results on Day 7. Investigators found that there is no difference
between treatment and control group in the number of patients testing negative for COVID-19
on Day 7 (13 v/s 14), the duration of illness did not differ significantly (p= >0.05). There was one
drop out and seven (three in treatment group and four in control) adverse events. The authors
concluded that COVID-19 has good prognosis and larger sample size with better endpoints is
needed to investigate the effects further.24
An open-label, non-randomized clinical trial was conducted by Gautret et al25 in France with 36
patients diagnosed with COVID-19. HCQ in dose of 200mg three times daily was given to 20
patients for 10 days, additionally six patients in this group received azithromycin (500 mg on

day 1, 250mg on days 2-5) to prevent bacterial superinfection. The control group received
standard care. The primary outcome was detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal
samples. The authors reported that patients in the treatment group significantly differed for
SARS-CoV-2 detection than controls. On Day 6 of post initiation, 70% of HCQ treated patients
were virologically cured compared to 12.5% in the control group (p= 0.001). They concluded
that HCQ treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in
COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.25
A six-day pilot, uncontrolled, non-comparative observational follow-up study was conducted by
French investigators to assess the clinical and microbiological effect of a combination of HCQ
and azithromycin in 80 COVID-19 patients. The investigators reported that all patients but two
(a 86 years old succumbed to illness, a 74 years old needed ICU) showed clinical improvement
with the combination therapy. qPCR testing showed a rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load83% and 93% patients were negative at Day 7, and Day 8 respectively. 97.5% of respiratory
samples were negative for virus cultures at Day 5. The researchers urged to evaluate the
combination strategy to treat patients in early course and avoid the spread of the disease.26

A latest large observational study conducted by American researchers, assessed the association
between HCQ use and intubation or death. 1376 patients were followed up for median of 22.5
days. Among them, 811 (58.9%) patients received HCQ (600 mg twice on day 1, then 400 mg
daily for a median of 5 days). Overall 346 patients (25.1%) had a primary end-point event (180
patients were intubated, of whom 66 subsequently succumbed, and 166 died without
intubation). The authors reported that there was no significant association between HCQ use

and intubation or death. They concluded hydroxychloroquine administration was not
associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of
intubation or death.27 (Table 2)

Assessment of methodological quality and rating of evidence generated by clinical studies
We used GRADE framework approach (Figure 2) to assess the methodological quality of
published and unpublished clinical studies of HCQ in COVID-19. The Oxford center for evidence
based medicine (CEBM) levels of evidence was used to assess and rate the quality of evidence.
Individual outcomes, overall outcome and clinical relevance were applied to rate the strength
and quality of evidence. (Table 4)

Summary of Ongoing Clinical trial data from clinical trial registry databases
Many of the ongoing RCTs conducted are studying the effect of HCQ compared to
placebo(NCT04342221, NCT04333654, NCT04332991, NCT04331834), few of the RCTs have
parallel design arms of HCQ and azithromycin (NCT04341727,NCT04341207, NCT04334382).
Some RCTs have robust trial designs with quadruple masking and strong endpoints
(NCT04333654, NCT04332991,NCT04331834). Few RCTs are in advance phases of clinical trials
(NCT04316377, NCT04341493) and some studies have large sample size to measure the effect
with higher strength of confidence (NCT04328012, NCT04328467). There are studies which are
considering the safety endpoints in the main outcome measures (ChiCTR2000029868). Some
RCTs are also testing antiretroviral drugs like lopinavir/ritonavir, emtricitabine/tenofovir along

with HCQ arm (NCT04328012,NCT04334928). Other studies are interested in tocilizumab
(NCT04332094) and umefenovir/arbidol (ChiCTR2000029803) along with HCQ. Few of the
studies are being conducted in severely ill patients (NCT04325893, ChiCTR2000029898) and
some in mild infections of COVID-19 (NCT04307693, ChiCTR2000029899). Most of the studies
are registered to be conducted in United States and China, others being conducted in Spain
(NCT04331834, NCT04332094), Norway (NCT04316377), France (NCT04325893, NCT04341207),
Germany (NCT04342221), Denmark (NCT04322396), Brazil (NCT04322123, NCT04321278),
Mexico (NCT04341493) and Republic of Korea (NCT04307693). Few earlier studies registered in
China (in Feb 2020) are nearing their completion in April end or early May 2020, their results
can be expected in near future (ChiCTR2000029898, ChiCTR2000029899, ChiCTR2000029992).
Additional details regarding the ongoing trials can be obtained from Supplementary Table 1.
In Europe, the Discovery project (NCT04315948) study has commenced in late march 2020 and
with recruitment of 3100 patients. The four treatments set to be evaluated in the discovery
project as per WHO recommendations are Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, IFNβ-1a,
Hydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine. The first set of results is expected to be available in 3 to 4
weeks of time. The estimated study completion date has been set in March 2023.28
Discussion
As on 7th May 2020, COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than three and half million infections
and more than 250,000 deaths growing up in alarming rate. Specific pharmacotherapy is the
highest need of the world. Hydroxycholoroquine with relatively better safety profile than

choloroquine and possible better antiviral efficacy19 offers a compelling hope. We
systematically searched various databases and clinical trial registries to evaluate the evidence.
During the previous outbreak of SARS, an in vitro study demonstrated the anti-corona viral
effect of HCQ and choloroquine.21 More recently Chinese researchers conducted in-vitro studies
in cell lines and demonstrated the potential antiviral activity of HCQ against SARS-CoV2 as
compared to chloroquine.19,20 It is relevant to note that these studies were the basis of initial
opinions and general consensus statements given by various panels across the world during the
early stages of the pandemic. We found out that there is scarcity of well conducted and
adequately reported human studies of HCQ use in COVID-19. This is in agreement with the
other authors with similar findings of lack of literature in this regard. 29-32 Literature also lacks
studies conducted in healthcare workers for either prophylaxis or treatment. Gao et al reported
more than 100 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed clinical improvement and changes
in image findings on chloroquine administration.22 It is pertinent to note that this letter was the
brief report of ongoing many trials in various locations in China, neither it mentioned any
specific data regarding interventions, study design, study population and outcome measures,
nor any adverse events were discussed. Chen et al in a RCT involving 30 COVID-19 patients did
not find any significant difference between treatment and control group in both
nasopharyngeal swab negativity and duration of illness.24 This study was an open label trial with
small sample size and had high risk of confounding and selection bias, the authors agreed that
primary end point was weak and more robust end points with larger sample size is required to
establish the effects.

Gautret et al25 in a non-randomized clinical trial in 36 COVID-19 patients, reported viral load
reduction by HCQ and its reinforcement by azithromycin. This study had major limitations in the
form of small sample size, absence of randomization and masking, lack of intention to treat
analysis and long term follow up, there was no clinical endpoint as outcome measure. A follow
up study by Gautret et al in 80 COVID-19 patients reported 97.5% of respiratory samples were
negative for virus cultures at Day 5. This study too involved only mild illness patients and did
not report adverse effect profile and being an uncontrolled observational study, the strength of
evidence tends to be low.26 A latest large American observational study in 1376 patients
reported no association between hydroxychloroquine administration and intubation/death in
moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. This study had limitations of single center observational
design, confounding bias and possibility of missing data events.27
We assessed the methodological quality and certainty of evidence of both published and
unpublished clinical studies in existing literature and found that overall quality of available
evidence ranges from ‘very low’ to ‘low’; the Oxford CEBM rating used showed the quality of
studies to be mostly at 3b level and couple studies at 2b level. (Table 4)
We also searched, identified and analyzed clinical trial databases to explore the ongoing active
clinical trials (Supplementary Table 1) and found out relevant 27 clinical trials. Few trials among
these are in advanced phases. Earlier registered Chinese clinical trials are expected to report
the results in near future and robust designed RCTs elsewhere in the world are expected to
produce their interim findings shortly henceforth.
It is appropriate to note that none of the available studies of HCQ in COVID-19 have
emphasized on the adverse effects and toxicity profile of the drugs in treated patients. Even

though HCQ has relatively better safety profile than chloroquine, owing to its prolonged
pharmacokinetics (537 hours half-life) and gradual elimination, HCQ has potential to cause
various adverse events viz. gastrointestinal upset,33 retinal toxicity,34 fulminant hepatic failure,35
severe cutaneous adverse reactions.36 An important adverse effect of HCQ is cardiac conduction
defects and ventricular arrhythmias. QT prolongation and arrhythmias can be precipitated by
concomitant use of azithromycin.37 Small but absolute risk of cardiovascular death is seen to be
associated significantly with azithromycin as compared to fluoroquinolones. 38 Overdose or
poisoning of HCQ is difficult to treat, caution is warranted in patients with hepatic and renal
dysfunction, and regular ECG monitoring is advised in patients with cardiovascular diseases and
in electrolyte imbalances.39 Irrational use in general population without credible evidence may
pose greater risk than benefit.
To best of our knowledge, this systematic review is the most comprehensive exploration and
analysis of existing literature in this topic till date. Our systematic review has limitations in its
rigor due to the inadequate, inconsistent data and heterogeneity of studies available. The
rapidly expanding knowledge base of COVID-19 poses the possibility that some studies remain
un-captured. However, we have tried our best to mitigate this by allowing broad, flexible search
terms and by including many databases and preprint repositories, while remaining focused on
the research question. In this background, we believe that expert opinions and clinical
consensus statements given by various international authorities for the use of HCQ either as
prophylaxis to high risk individuals 15 and healthcare professionals16 or as emergency treatment
of COVID-19 patients17,18 lack strong evidence base.

Conclusion
The in-vitro cell culture based data of viral inhibition does not suffice for the use of
hydroxychloroquine in the patients with COVID-19. Current literature shows scant and low level
evidence in clinical studies. At this stage it is reasonable to suggest against the use
hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis both in general population as well as health care workers.
Considering the toxicity profile, chances of overdoses and poisoning can pose serious health
threats if hydroxychloroquine is used widely. Ongoing well designed clinical trials are expected
to provide explicit answer on safety and efficacy in near future. It is warranted against the
widespread use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 until robust evidence becomes available.
