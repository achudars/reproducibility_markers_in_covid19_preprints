Abstract
Highly sensitive, specific, and point-of-care (POC) serological assays are an essential tool to manage
the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we report on a microfluidic, multiplexed POC test that can profile the antibody
response against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens—Spike S1 (S1), Nucleocapsid (N), and the receptor binding
domain (RBD)—simultaneously from a 60 µL drop of blood, plasma, or serum. We assessed the levels of antiSARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma samples from 19 individuals (at multiple time points) with COVID-19 that
required admission to the intensive care unit and from 10 healthy individuals. This POC assay shows good
concordance with a live virus microneutralization assay, achieved high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%),
and successfully tracked the longitudinal evolution of the antibody response in infected individuals. We also
demonstrated that we can detect a chemokine, IP-10, on the same chip, which may provide prognostic insight
into patient outcomes. Because our test requires minimal user intervention and is read by a handheld detector,
it can be globally deployed in the fight against COVID-19 by democratizing access to laboratory quality tests.

Introduction
The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic poses an
enormous challenge to the world. SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in over 47 million cases of coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) worldwide, resulting in over 1.2 million deaths as of November 3, 2020 1. Unlike many other viruses,
SARS-CoV-2 displays high infectivity, a large proportion of asymptomatic carriers, and a long incubation time of
up to 12 days, during which carriers are infectious 2-4. As a result, transmission has been widespread, resulting
in overwhelmed healthcare capacities across the globe 5,6. Timely, reliable and accurate diagnostic and
surveillance tests are necessary to control the current outbreak and to prevent future spikes in transmission.
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which detects viral nucleic acids, is the current
gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis 7,8. Although RT-PCR is highly sensitive and specific 9,10, it does not detect
past infections—RNA is typically only present at high quantities during acute infection—and it does not provide
insight into the host’s response to infection 11. Serological assays, which detect antibodies induced by SARSCoV-2, are a crucial supplement to nucleic acid testing for COVID-19 management 12,13. Specifically, serological
assays are important to track the body’s immune response 14, and to potentially inform prognosis 15 or immunity
status 12. Serological assays are also essential for use in epidemiological studies 16, and are a critical enabling
tool for vaccine development 17.
SARS‐CoV‐2 is an enveloped RNA virus with four structural proteins: spike (S) protein, membrane (M)
protein, enveloped (E) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein 18. As the pandemic unfolded, several serological
binding assays were developed including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and lateral flow
assays (LFA). These assays measure either the level of total antibody or that of specific antibody isotypes that
bind to viral proteins—normally S or N. Several studies have demonstrated promising clinical sensitivity and
specificity for ELISA and some LFAs 19,20. Furthermore, several ELISAs have been shown to correlate well with
neutralizing antibody titers 21,22, and thus may be useful clinically and in vaccine development 23. However, both
ELISA and LFAs have major disadvantages that limit their applicability for COVID-19 management. ELISA
requires technical expertise, laboratory infrastructure, and multiple incubation and wash steps, limiting its
applicability to settings outside of a centralized laboratory 24. On the other hand, LFAs are portable, but they
have lower sensitivity and provide qualitative results 25, whereas a quantitative readout is preferred for clinical
use, research studies, and surveillance applications. Collectively, these shortcomings of ELISAs and LFAs
motivate the need for an easily deployable, point-of-care test (POCT) that can be manufactured in large volumes,
has quantitative figures of merit equal to laboratory-based tests, and is as easy to use as an LFA.
To address the challenge of creating a user-friendly and widely deployable assay that can detect prior
exposure to, and immunological response against SARS-CoV-2, we developed a new multiplexed portable
COVID-19 serological assay that is described herein. Our passive microfluidic platform provides sensitive and
quantitative detection of antibodies against multiple SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in 60 minutes with a single test
from a single 60 µL drop of blood, plasma, or serum. We chose to quantify the antibody response against three
different SARS-CoV-2 antigens because emerging studies have demonstrated that the primary antigenic target
of the humoral immune response may inform disease progression and prognosis 14. Thus, being able to
differentiate the viral targets of antibodies—as we can with our platform—may be especially valuable. Further,
our portable test is completely automated and can function independently of a centralized laboratory at the pointof-care. We also show that our test can be easily modified to detect additional protein biomarkers, such as
cytokines/chemokines, without compromising the performance of the serological assay, which may provide
further clinical insight into disease severity and or patient outcomes 2,26,27. Collectively, these attributes suggest
that our platform is a valuable tool for COVID-19 management both at the individual patient level (i.e. monitoring
patients who may progress to severe disease) and for large-scale epidemiological studies at the population level.

Results
The DA-D4 point-of-care test (POCT) for
COVID-19 serology
Our strategy to evaluate the
antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is
based on the D4 assay platform,
developed recently and reported
elsewhere 28. The D4 platform is a
completely self-contained immunoassay
platform fabricated upon a “non-fouling”
poly(oligoethylene glycol methyl ether
methacrylate) (POEGMA) brush, where
all reagents needed to complete the
assay are inkjet printed directly onto the
surface. In previous work, we have used
this platform for the detection of several
protein biomarkers using a fluorescent
sandwich immunoassay format 28. Here,
we modified the design of the assay to
detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
using a double-antigen (DA) bridging
immunoassay format, which detects total
antibody (all isotypes and subclasses).
The DA-D4 is fabricated by inkjet printing
viral antigens as stable and spatially
discrete capture spots. In addition, viral
antigens are labeled with a fluorescent
tag and are printed nearby on an
excipient pad as dissolvable spots.
When a sample is added to the assay
(Fig. 1a-i), the excipient pad dissolves
and liberates the fluorescently labeled
antigen (Fig. 1a-ii), which then diffuses
across the polymer brush to the capture
spots and labels any antibody that has
been captured from solution by the
stable capture spots of unlabeled
antigen (Fig. 1a-iii). The fluorescence
intensity of the capture spots is then
imaged using a fluorescent detector and
scales with antibody concentration in a
sample (Fig. 1a-iv). Because capture
spots of each antigen are printed at
spatially discrete locations, this design
enables multiplexed quantification of
multiple target antibodies using a single

liberated from the surface due to the dissolution of the underlying
trehalose pad. Antibodies targeting each viral antigen then bridge the
capture antigens to the dAgs, resulting in a fluorescence signal that
scales with antibody concentration. (b) Open format DA-D4 with 24individual assays. (c) Microfluidic DA-D4. Sample is added to the sample

wicking pad (WP) after the incubation process. The size is that of a

fluorescent tag, which greatly simplifies the detector design and assay readout.
To fabricate a serological assay for SARS-CoV-2, nucleocapsid (N), spike S1 domain (S1), and the
receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 were inkjet printed as the “stable” capture reagents onto POEGMA-coated
slides. Our rationale for simultaneously assaying the antibody response towards N, S1, and RBD antigens is that
it is not fully understood which epitopes elicit an immune response in all individuals, though they are all believed
to be immunogenic 29,30 and because studies have shown that the primary target of the immune response may
inform disease prognosis 14. N is expressed abundantly by SARS-CoV-2 during infection and is highly
immunogenic in other coronaviruses 31,32. The S protein—composed of the S1 and S2 domains—is exposed on
the viral coat of SARS-CoV-2 and plays an essential role in viral attachment, fusion, entry, and transmission 33.
Because S2 is highly conserved across many coronaviruses and is thus potentially cross-reactive, S1 was
chosen for antibody detection 34. RBD—the portion of S1 that binds cells expressing viral receptor—is the target
for many neutralizing antibodies and is thus a promising antigenic target for serological assays 34. Fig. S1a
shows the layout and dimensions of an open format DA-D4 chip. Each chip contains 24 individual assays with
S1, RBD, and N antigens arrayed as separate rows of five identical ~170 µm diameter spots. Next, fluorescent
conjugates of S1—which contains the amino acid sequence for RBD— and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of N
(produced in-house, see Fig. S2 for SDS-PAGE of expression and purification) were mixed 1:1 and inkjet printed
as twelve identical 1 mm diameter spots on an identically sized trehalose pad (Fig S1a). N-NTD —instead of
full-length N— was chosen as the detection reagent because the full N domain can dimerize in solution,
potentially leading to a false positive result in the DA format 35.

Analytical validation of the DA-D4 POCT using simulated samples
We first sought to demonstrate that the DA-D4 assay can detect antibodies against recombinantly
expressed SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Initially, the analytical performance was characterized using the open format
DA-D4 (Fig. 1b). This is because the open format DA-D4 assay has been extensively optimized and
characterized by our group and has extremely high analytical sensitivity which enables us to determine the
figures-of-merit that are theoretically possible for a particular D4 assay. A disadvantage of the open format DAD4 assay, however, is that it requires a rinse step by the user after incubation of the sample 28.
For point-of-care deployment and an improved user experience, we developed —in the course of this
study— a new, gravity and capillary driven “passive” microfluidic flow cell that fully automates the assay (Fig.
1c). The microfluidic flow cell is fabricated by adhering complementary layers of precision laser-cut acrylic and
adhesive sheets onto the functionalized POEGMA substrate (Fig. S3 and Fig. S1b for the print layout). The
resulting microfluidic flow cell features a reaction chamber, timing channel, sample inlet, wash buffer reservoir,
and wicking pad that automates the sample incubation, sample removal, wash, and drying steps. This simplifies
the user experience and limits the possibility of a user incorrectly carrying out the test, as it only requires the
user to add the sample and a drop of wash buffer to the cassette. After ~60 minutes, the cassette is ready for
imaging with a custom-built fluorescent detector—the D4Scope (Fig. 1d).
The D4Scope is a low-cost (<$1,000), portable fluorescence detector (with dimensions of 7 inches wide,
6 inches tall, 5 inches deep and a weight of ~5 pounds; see Fig. S4 for dimensions and image) built from offthe-shelf components and assembled using 3D-printed parts that can image microarray spots with high
sensitivity. It utilizes coherent 638 nm red laser light set at an oblique angle (30°) relative to the surface to excite
the fluorescently labeled antigens. The fluorescence wavelength emission from the labeled reagents is then sent
through a bandpass filter and imaged with a high-efficiency Sony IMX CMOS sensor in a Basler Ace camera
(Fig. 1d). This setup provides a large field-of-view of 7.4 mm x 5 mm and a fine (raw) lateral resolution of ~2.4
µm. A user-friendly interface was developed in Python that runs on a 3.5” Raspberry Pi touchscreen to control
laser excitation, camera exposure, and image file output (see supplementary information for more details, Fig.
S4).
To mimic seropositive samples, we spiked commercially available antibodies (with known binding affinity
towards SARS-CoV-2 antigens) into undiluted pooled human serum that was collected prior to the COVID-19

outbreak. A dilution series spanning four logs was evaluated on open format DA-D4 chips and yielded a doseresponse curve with fluorescence intensities that scaled with antibody concentration and approximated a
sigmoidal curve, demonstrating that the assay was responsive to the antibodies of interest (Fig. 1e). Within the
microfluidic flow cell, the chamber geometry, reagent spacing/alignment, and amount of printed reagent were
iteratively optimized to match the performance metrics of the open format DA-D4. Six doses (including a blank)
with varying amounts of anti-S1/RBD and anti-N antibodies were prepared and tested in quadruplicate on 24
separate microfluidic flow cells to demonstrate equivalence between the open format (Fig.1b) and microfluidic
flow cell (Fig.1c). In the microfluidic flow cell, the fluorescence intensity of the capture antigens—imaged with
the D4Scope—also scaled with antibody concentration, suggesting that the test is responsive to anti-SARSCoV-2 antibodies (Fig. 1f).

Clinical validation of the DA-D4 POCT
Next, we sought to validate the
clinical performance of the DA-D4 POCT in a
retrospective study using banked plasma
samples from patients with PCR-confirmed
COVID-19 who had been admitted to the
intensive care unit (ICU) at Duke University
Medical Center. A total of 34 COVID-19
positive plasma samples (heat-inactivated)
from 19 patients—some of which had
longitudinal samples available—and 10
negative samples (collected prior to the
COVID-19 pandemic) were tested on the
microfluidic DA-D4 and imaged with the
D4Scope. The median age of the COVID-19
patients was 55. Of the 19 patients, 10 were
female and 9 were male. For most patients,
the date of symptom onset was known (29
out of 34 samples), where the average was
20.7 days with a range of 6–48 days. The
complete patient profile is provided in Table
S1.
Antibody reactivity towards all three
viral antigens was measured on single
microfluidic flow cell for each patient sample.
For validation, we conservatively assigned
the threshold for a positive test result as three
standard deviations above the mean of the
negative controls. There was a statistically
significant difference between the mean
intensity for COVID-19 positive and negative
samples (p < 0.0001) for all three markers
(Fig. 2a-c). 33 out of 34 (97.1%) COVID-19
positive samples tested above the threshold
for anti-S1 and anti-N, while 34 out of 34
(100%) tested positive for anti-RBD. All
negative controls tested below the threshold

for each marker (specificity of 100%). Representative images for a high positive and negative sample are
included in Figure S5.
Next, we partitioned the data into five different groups based on days since symptom onset: 6–10 days,
11–14 days, 15–21 days, 22–28 days, and > 29 days (Fig. 2d-f). For two patients (five total samples), the date
of symptom onset was unknown, hence the day since first positive PCR test result was used instead (these data
points are marked with an x). When the data are partitioned by date since symptom onset, the sensitivity for all
three markers included in our test increased to 100% for 15 days or longer after symptom onset. For antibodies
targeting S1 and RBD, we found a statistically significant difference between the different time groups, as
determined by one-way ANOVA (p < 0.0001). Multiple comparisons by Tukey’s post hoc testing revealed that
the magnitude of the antibody response to S1 and RBD was higher in all groups after 11 days compared to days
6–10 (p < 0.05) and that there was no statistically significant (p > 0.05) difference between any group after day
11. These results suggest that our assay spans a useful temporal range to detect the dynamic production of
antibodies that typically occurs within 2 weeks of symptom onset 15. In addition, the patients tested all developed
a robust and sustained antibody response against S1 and RBD.
For antibodies targeting N, there was also a statistically significant difference in DA-D4 readout between
groups as determined by one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05). However, the production of N-targeting antibodies appears
to occur later, as there was no statistically significant difference in the antibody response when comparing days
241
6 – 10 and 11 – 14 (p > 0.05), but all groups
242
after 15 days were significantly higher than the
243
first time point (p < 0.05). The concentration of
244
N-targeting antibodies also appears to be more
245
variable across all patients, especially at later
246
time points, with some samples testing close to
247
the threshold value. This could be due to the
248
fact that some patients may develop a stronger
249
response against other viral antigens/epitopes
(RBD or S1) 36 or against an epitope of N not

within the NTD, highlighting the importance of
252
testing for antibodies against several antigens
253
simultaneously to maximize test sensitivity and
254
specificity.

We also conducted a proof-of-concept

Fresh blood was collected in EDTA-coated tubes from four patients with negative COVID-19 antibody status (as
determined by ELISA performed by the supplier) and from five patients with confirmed COVID-19 (from new
enrollments to the ICU study) (Table S2). Each 60 µL blood sample was tested on the microfluidic DA-D4 assay.
No complications were observed, such as coagulation of blood that can occur when testing whole blood in
microfluidic systems. Fig. 3b shows representative images of the reaction chamber, with the time since sample
addition noted in the lower right-hand corner of each sub-panel, demonstrating the ability of the microfluidic chip
to process whole blood. The antibody response towards S1, RBD, and N from whole blood is shown in Fig. 3c.
We set the threshold to determine a positive test as three standard deviations above the mean of the negatives.
All negative samples tested as negative, and all positives tested above the threshold. These preliminary results
suggest that the microfluidic DA-D4 assay is capable of detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in whole blood,
so that the assay can be carried out immediately at the point of sample collection without the need for transport
to a centralized laboratory for sample processing into serum or plasma and subsequent testing.

Monitoring antibody levels longitudinally
Having demonstrated the high clinical sensitivity and specificity of the microfluidic DA-D4 assay for
detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens, as well as the ability to detect changes in antibody levels
with time, we next sought to track individual patients to track their seroconversion. To accomplish this, we tested
longitudinal plasma samples from
six individual patients (Fig. 4a-f).
Across all six patients, the antibody
response was initially low for the first
time point tested and then increased
and plateaued at later time points,
consistent with the antibody
dynamics reported in other studies
15,37,38
. The DA-D4 readout for
antibodies targeting S1 and RBD
appeared to saturate by the second
time point—typically 2-3 weeks post
symptom onset—suggesting that
each patient mounted a strong and
robust immune response that was
sustained over time. For N, the
dynamics were slower in one patient
(#1) and did not fully saturate in
another (#3), providing insight into
the primary target of the antibody
response in those patients. In
general, patients with severe
COVID-19 often develop very high
antibody titers 37, which is reflected
in this ICU patient sample set by
saturated signals at later time

immune response. The earliest time points for each patient were also still elevated relative to the negative
controls, indicating that we may have been able to detect seroconversion earlier, had samples from earlier time
points been available. For patients later in disease progression with high antibody titers, dilutions could be
performed to adjust the concentration into the linear range of the assay. Testing a sample at various dilutions
would also allow us to calculate specific antibody titers, which we are not able to do from a single undiluted
sample.
Each sample in the longitudinal study was tested in duplicate on different days and by a different user to
characterize the reproducibility and robustness of our platform (Fig. 4g-i). We found a strong correlation for each
marker, with a Pearson’s r correlation of 0.98, 0.98, and 0.96 for S1, RBD, and N, respectively. The high
correlation between replicates further emphasizes the quantitative nature and reproducibility of our platform for
profiling the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

Concordance with neutralizing antibody titers
We next compared the performance of the DA-D4 with a microneutralization assay that monitors
functional neutralization of
SARS-CoV-2 via neutralizing
antibodies binding to the
RBD. All six patients that we
tracked
longitudinally
developed robust neutralizing
antibodies,
and
the
microneutralization titer was
strongly concordant with DAD4
assay
readout
for
antibodies targeting S1 and
the RBD of S1 (Fig. 5a-f).
Furthermore, a concordance
analysis of the DA-D4 assay
with the microneutralization
assay for antibodies targeting
S1 and RBD showed a strong
correlation across all plasma
samples tested (Fig. S7a, b),

> 0.70 (p < 0.0001). For Microneutralization titer is plotted on the left axis superimposed against the antibody
antibodies targeting N, the data from figure 3 (plotted on the right axis).
concordance between the two
assays was not as strong, with only a moderate correlation between the DA-D4 results and microneutralization
data (Fig. S7c). This is expected, as N resides inside the capsid of SARS-CoV-2 and is not relevant for functional
neutralization 39. This is also reflected in the longitudinal sample set. For example, patient #1 at day 15 after
symptom onset has strong neutralizing antibodies, as seen by the microneutralization assay, despite a weak
overall antibody level for N. Although future studies are required to validate the ability of neutralizing antibodies
to confer protection, these results suggest that the DA-D4 assay could be used as a supplement to live virus
neutralization assays, which typically require >48 hours and biosafety level 3 containment.

Profiling prognostic biomarkers concurrent with serological testing
Finally, we investigated the feasibility of detecting a prognostic protein biomarker concurrent with
serological profiling. This is motivated by the fact that others have identified potentially prognostic biomarkers
that correlate well with disease severity and patient outcomes 40,41. Therefore, tracking antibody levels alongside

prognostic biomarkers may provide clinically relevant information to inform interventions in the ICU for patients
with a high probability of a poor outcome. As proof-of-concept, detection of IFN-γ–induced protein 10 (IP-10,
CXCL10)—a chemokine that recruits inflammatory cells to the site of inflammation and which has been shown
to be elevated in severe disease and correlates with patient prognosis 27,41—was integrated into the DA-D4 assay
using a traditional sandwich immunoassay approach, as described previously 28.
Prior to testing patient samples, we sought to confirm that the multiplexed serological assay is compatible
(not cross-reactive) with the IP-10 sandwich assay. To do so, we fabricated open format chips containing all
necessary reagents for both COVID-19 serology and human IP-10 detection. First, we prepared a 15-point
dilution series of recombinant human IP-10 spiked into fetal bovine serum (FBS)—spanning the relevant
physiological range for COVID-19 patients identified elsewhere 41—and added samples to chips in triplicate in
the absence of antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 antigens. We observed a dose-dependent behavior for IP-10
response with a low limit-of-detection of
0.12 ng/mL 42 and minimal reactivity for
SARS-CoV-2
capture
antigens,
confirming that the IP-10 assay
components do not cross react with the
serology components (Fig. 6a). Next, we
prepared a dilution series of simulated
seropositive samples and added them to
the open format chips. Across all
concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibodies, IP-10 capture antibody
intensity was close to baseline, thus
confirming that the serology components
do not interfere with the IP-10 detection
assay (Fig. 6b).
Having
confirmed
the
compatibility of the IP-10 assay with
multiplexed serology in the open D4
format, we next sought to test the
performance of our assay in patient
samples. Ten COVID-19 positive plasma
samples (from 7 patients) were procured

we did observe that in the patients for which we tested multiple samples, IP-10 decreased over time, while the
levels of antibodies increased.
Overall, these results clearly show that the D4 assay format can simultaneously detect antibody response
to foreign native SARS-CoV-2 antigens and a native protein biomarker from undiluted patient plasma. One of
the benefits of detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from undiluted samples is that the sensitivity of the protein
detection assay is not reduced because of dilution, allowing us to detect chemokines and cytokines—which are
present at very low concentrations even during disease state—directly from complex biological milieu. Detection
of additional prognostic biomarkers could also be implemented on the same chip, as long as there is no crossreactivity between the assay reagents for serology and prognosis. Interestingly, a recent study found that the
ratio of IL-6 to IL-10 can be used to guide clinical decision making 43, which we plan to measure in the next
generation of this assay.

As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, countries around the globe grappled with developing streamlined
systems for diagnosis of acute infection using nucleic acid detection methods. Although there remains an urgent
need for rapid and sensitive point-of-care tests for acute diagnosis, developing accurate and reliable serological
assays has been deemed an equally important endeavor to complement existing diagnostic strategies 12,44. The
challenge with developing an easy-to-use serology assay that can be broadly disseminated, but that performs
as well as centralized laboratory-based methods is highlighted by the large number of ELISA and LFA tests that
have been developed. While LFAs are portable and easy-to-use and ELISAs are quantitative and highly
sensitive, there remains a need for a technology that can merge the best attributes of each format.
The DA-D4 POCT is a promising platform to supplement existing diagnostic technologies to manage the
COVID-19 pandemic because it marries the best attributes of LFAs and ELISAs— it is quantitative, easy to use,
widely deployable, requires only a single 60 µL drop of blood, and can be performed with minimal user
intervention. The SARS-CoV-2 DA-D4 assay can be used to measure antibody kinetics and seroconversion at
the individual patient level directly from unprocessed blood or plasma. This test is highly sensitive and specific
and is potentially suited for epidemiological surveillance at the population-level using low cost microfluidic
cassettes that can be transported and stored for an extended period of time without a cold chain, and that require
minimal user intervention to carry out the assay, which provide a quantitative readout using a low cost, handheld detector.
We show a strong correlation between the DA-D4 assay readout (for S1 and the RBD of S1) and
neutralizing antibody titers, suggesting that this test may be useful in understanding efficacy and durability of
natural or vaccine-induced humoral immunity, and to potentially inform disease prognosis and population-level
immunity. We also demonstrate that an additional prognostic biomarker can be easily incorporated into the test,
which may be useful for monitoring disease severity and predict clinical outcomes. Combined, these attributes
suggest this platform may also be useful on the individual patient level to aid in clinical decision making. While
the results presented here mainly highlight the performance of the microfluidic chip, the open format architecture
with up to 24 individual assays per glass slide may be useful for scenarios where higher throughput testing is
demanded. The open format still has advantages compared to traditional ELISA because the open format only
requires a single incubation step and one wash step, which reduces the hands-on time and equipment complexity
required to complete the assay.
The DA-D4 has additional features that synergize to deliver a highly desirable serological assay. First,
the double-antigen sandwich format (i.e. antibody bridging) has advantages over other serological assay formats.
Because total antibody is detected rather than a single antibody isotype or subclass, seroconversion in patients
can be detected earlier, which reduces the chances of a false negative result due to a test being administered
too early in disease 38. Furthermore, because the labeled reagent does not have species specificity, the single
assay kit could be used in pre-clinical vaccine development studies to measure antibody responses in

experimental animals 23. The lack of species-specific detection antibodies also reduces the risk of high
background signal caused by non-specific antibodies binding to the surface and subsequently being labeled 45.
Second, all reagents needed to complete the assay are incorporated onto the non-fouling POEGMA
brush, which eliminates virtually all non-specific protein adsorption and cellular adhesion, thereby enabling an
extremely low LOD directly from undiluted samples 46-48. Although many serological assays often dilute samples,
the ability to test undiluted samples is advantageous, especially when combined with prognostic biomarker
testing where dilution of low concentration analytes can lead to an undetectable signal. Testing multiple dilutions
can still be performed using our test when antibody levels become high, which could be used to calculate specific
titers. POEGMA also acts as a stabilizing substrate for printed reagents, enabling long term storage of chips
without a cold chain 28. In this study, results were generated over the course of three months from the same
batch of tests stored in silica desiccated pouches at room temperature and ambient humidity.
Third, this platform can be easily multiplexed, which can be used to capture a more detailed picture of
the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by quantifying the antibody level induced to multiple viral
antigens —in this case N, S1, and S1-RBD– from a single sample without sacrificing ease-of-use. This is
because each viral antigen is deposited at a spatially discrete location, which allows for a single fluorescent tag
to be used during fluorescence imaging of the chip, thereby simplifying assay readout compared to other
multiplexing technologies such as Simoa or Luminex assays which rely on multiple different reporter molecules
and a more complex readout 14,49. This method also allows us to simultaneously measure the concentration of
potential prognostic biomarkers directly from plasma 26,27 without compromising the performance of the
multiplexed serological assay. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no tests on the market that can
probe for antibodies against multiple viral antigens and prognostic protein biomarkers simultaneously.
Fourth, this platform is designed for point-of-care deployment because it requires a single drop of blood
that is readily obtained from a fingerstick. This droplet is injected into the sample port of a gravity driven
microfluidic chip that requires no further user intervention beyond the concurrent addition of a few drops of wash
buffer into a separate port. The assay runs by itself under the action of gravity and capillary action until all the
fluid is drained from the microfluidic path by the absorbent pad at the bottom of the cassette, which fully absorbs
and contains all liquid. The microfluidic chip relies only upon capillary action and gravity to drive fluid flow, which
eliminates the need for pumps, valves, or actuators, and reduces the complexity and cost of the assay. This
enables the assay to be read out at the point of sample collection using the D4Scope—a highly sensitive and
inexpensive handheld detector developed to work with the microfluidic chip. The D4Scope images a chip and
provides a quantitative readout in less than 5 seconds, does not require an external power source or laboratory
infrastructure, and can wirelessly transmit the results to a remote server over Wi-Fi. While smartphone-based
diagnostics are becoming more popular, a benefit of this platform is that it does not rely on smartphone hardware
and software, which change rapidly. Combined, these attributes make our platform ideal for providing ELISA-like
sensitivity and quantitation with the ease-of-use and scalability of LFAs.
Where might this point of care assay for COVID-19 serology and prognosis be useful? Serial
quantification of antibody response and prognostic biomarkers would be most useful to monitor symptomatic and
severe cases where use of available therapeutics, such as antiviral or monoclonal therapies, is indicated.
Further, it could be used to screen for patients with poor antibody responses who may benefit from convalescent
plasma or monoclonal antibody therapy. We believe that this platform has potential utility in point-of-care settings
such as ICUs, urgent care clinics, and at the point-of-use—at locations where periodic surveillance of healthcare
workers and other essential workers in close proximity to others for extended periods of time such as assemblyline manufacturing or food processing plants— is desirable to assist in tracking clusters of disease and
epidemiological studies. This platform could also be used as an inexpensive tool to study the longitudinal
dynamics of antibody levels to inform re-infection potential, as coronavirus immunity often lasts only ~6 months
50
. Similarly, it could be used to monitor vaccine-induced humoral immunity, which could help determine if
boosters are needed in certain vaccinated individuals. This technology is suitable for low-resource settings

across the globe, where eliminating the need for sample storage and transport to a centralized testing facility,
and the attendant cold chain, is desirable, and where access to expensive, high-throughput clinical analyzers
that process large volumes of serology and other sandwich immunoassays is limited. Similarly, remote and
austere settings —such as the field-forward position of the military or other remote locations where pandemics
often emerge— can also benefit from this platform, as the testing is carried out with a disposable cassette and
a low-cost, light-weight, and handheld detector whose production can easily be scaled up to enable wide-spread
and dispersed deployment.
While the results presented here are promising, there are several issues identified during this study that
require further investigation prior to its deployment. First, our cohort of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection
consisted of adults with clinically significant disease, which is not representative of the entire spectrum of COVID19 disease severity. These samples were chosen to demonstrate proof-of-concept of the DA-D4 assay and
because these samples were locally available through an existing biobank. We recognize that a larger sample
size that spans the disease severity spectrum is required to develop a more robust measure of sensitivity and
specificity of the DA-D4 serology test for SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, we were not able to match demographics in
our negative control group, which may have introduced confounding variables in our analyses. Furthermore,
several of the samples we tested saturated the readout of our assay, which limits the dynamics we can measure
once high antibody titers are achieved. This limitation could be addressed by testing individual samples on
separate microfluidic chips at various dilutions, which would effectively increase the dynamic range of our assay
and yield more precise quantitative titer. Additionally, because of the double antigen design of our assay, we are
also not able to discriminate between specific antibody subclasses or isotypes, which has been shown to be
important for other diseases. Despite these limitations, we believe our assay is well poised to complement
existing diagnostic solutions once additional validation studies encompassing larger patient cohorts are
completed.
In summary, we have developed a COVID-19 serological assay that merges the benefits of LFAs and
ELISAs. We used this test to simultaneously measure the antibody levels for multiple viral antigens and a
potential prognostic biomarker directly from plasma and whole blood. For COVID-19 management, our platform
may be useful to better understand patient antibody responses, provide actionable intelligence to physicians to
guide interventions for hospitalized patients at the point-of-care, to assess vaccine efficacy, and to perform
epidemiological studies. Further, our platform is broadly applicable to other diseases where sensitive and
quantitative antibody and or protein detection is desirable in settings without access to a centralized laboratory.
Overall, we believe that our platform is a promising approach to democratize access to laboratory quality tests,
by enabling rapid and decentralized testing with minimal user intervention to locations outside the hospital.

DA-D4 assay
The DA-D4 assay is based on the design of the D4 immunoassay, reported elsewhere 28. Briefly, a
polymer brush composed of poly(oligoethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate) (POEGMA) was “grafted from”
a glass slide by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization 47. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins
were then printed onto POEGMA-coated slides as capture and detection spots. Capture spots of the following
proteins were printed as ~170 µm diameter spots using a Scienion S11 sciFLEXARRAYER (Scienion AG) inkjet
printer: Spike S1 (Sino Biological, cat# 40591-V05H1), Spike RBD (Sino Biological, cat# 40592-V02H), and
Nucleocapsid protein (Leinco, cat# S854). Each protein was printed as a row/column of five identical spots. Next,
12 excipient pads of trehalose with 1.6 mm spacing were printed from a 10% (w/v) trehalose solution in deionized
water around the periphery of the capture antigen array using a BioDot AD1520 printer (BioDot, Inc.). To print
the detection reagents, S1 (Sino Biological, cat# 40591-V08H) and N-NTD (produced in-house), were first
conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (per the manufacturer’s instructions) and then detection spots, of the fluorescent
protein conjugates of these proteins were printed on top of the excipient pads as twelve 1 mm diameter spots.

detection spots is sown in Figure S1. After printing and final assembly, D4 chips were stored with desiccant until
use. The amount of reagent deposited for the open-format and microfluidic format was identical, with the only
difference being the relative spot placement (Fig. S1a, b). For DA-D4 assays that also detected IP-10, an
additional column of five spots of capture antibody (R&D systems, cat# MAB266) was included and anti-IP-10
detection antibody (R&D systems, cat# AF-266) was included in the detection cocktail for the open format chips.

Fabrication and analytical testing of open format DA-D4
Open format slides were prepared by adhering acrylic wells to each slide, which splits one slide into 24
independent arrays (see Fig. S1a for a schematic and Fig. 1b for an image). To validate the analytical
performance of the test, dose-response curves were generated using antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 antigens
(Sino Biological, cat#: 40143-MM05, 40150-D001, and 40150-D004) spiked into undiluted pooled human serum.
Open format chips were incubated with a 15-point dilution series (run in triplicate) for 30 minutes, briefly rinsed
in a 0.1% Tween-20/PBS wash buffer and then dried. Arrays were imaged on an Axon Genepix 4400 tabletop
scanner (Molecular Devices, LLC).

Fabrication and analytical testing of microfluidic DA-D4
The microfluidic chip fabrication process is described in detail in the supplementary information section
3. Briefly, the microfluidic chip was fabricated by adhering complementary layers of precision laser-cut acrylic
and adhesive sheets onto the POEGMA substrate that had been functionalized with the relevant capture and
detection reagents. The resulting assembly features a reaction chamber, timing channel, sample inlet, wash
buffer reservoir, and wicking pad that automates the sample incubation, sample removal, wash, and drying steps.
Simulated doses were prepared using antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Sino Biological, cat#: 40143MM05, 40150-D001, and 40150-D004) spiked into undiluted pooled human serum. Six doses (including a blank)
were tested on the microfluidic DA-D4 in the following way: (1) The user dispenses 60 µL of sample into the
sample inlet using a pipette. (2) The user dispenses 135 µL of wash buffer into the wash reservoir of the cassette
using a pipette. (3) The user waits 60 minutes for the cassette to run to completion. During this time, (a)
fluorescently labeled antigens dissolve and form sandwiches with the antibodies of interest and the immobilized
capture antigen in the reaction chamber. (b) A small volume of sample traverses the timing channel, which
governs the incubation time. (c) The sample reaches an absorbent pad situated at the end of the timing channel
that rapidly wicks away all sample from the reaction chamber, ending incubation. (d) As the sample clears, wash
buffer enters the reaction chamber removing residual sample and unbound reagent before it is also wicked away
leaving a cleaned and dry imaging surface. We observed less than a +/- 10% variation in the designed 23-minute
incubation time for the data presented in Figure 1f. The remaining difference in time accounts for washing and
drying time. (4) The cassette is ready for analysis on the D4Scope. The vertical orientation of the cassette works
in conjunction with the POEGMA brush to maintain low background fluorescence. Cellular and other sample
debris can collect on the brush surface due to gravitational forces, even if no binding is occurring. The vertical
orientation ensures that these debris fall harmlessly towards the timing channel during the wash step. This
proved especially important when testing with undiluted human whole blood samples.

Clinical testing of microfluidic DA-D4
The same testing procedure as described in “Analytical testing of microfluidic DA-D4" was used to test
both the plasma and whole blood clinical samples. For both cases, sample was added directly to the microfluidic
DA-D4. For blood, a variation in the microfluidic design was used and is described in supplementary information
section 7. This required the use of 200 µL of wash buffer. All other procedures remained the same.

D4Scope fabrication and operation
The D4Scope design, fabrication, and assembly is described in detail in the supplementary information
section 5. Briefly, the D4Scope’s optical elements – the laser, bandpass filter, lens, and camera—and processing
elements – the Raspberry Pi 4, touchscreen, and cabling—are mounted in a custom 3D printed chassis. Fully
assembled, it weighs ~5 pounds. The D4Scope can be powered either through a portable battery pack or wall

power. Once connected to the power source, the D4Scope automatically runs our custom imaging Python
program. The user removes the light protection cover from the cassette loading port and slides the microfluidic
cassette with glass side towards the detector. The light protection cover is then replaced enclosing the cassette.
The user is then prompted to enter the sample ID # and chip ID # using either the touchscreen or optional
attached keyboard and mouse.
The D4Scope has two fine adjustment knobs on the cassette loading port that allow for precise vertically
and horizontally movement of the cassette relative to the laser source to ensure that the DA-D4 array is perfectly
centered with the excitation source. Each array has co-printed two control spots that will always be uniformly
bright across all tested samples and align with two super-imposed alignment cross hairs on the live video-feed
of the D4Scope. Using the “Toggle video” function on the UI activates the laser and camera to provide a live
view of the imaging area for this alignment. Once aligned, the “Toggle video” function can be pressed again to
end the live view, and the “Capture image” function can be used to collect and save the resulting image onto the
on-board hard-drive and optionally to a cloud-based server defined by the end-user. The live-view feature should
be used sparingly to prevent photo-bleaching of the sample. For this study we manually analyzed the resulting
fluorescence intensity using Genepix Analysis software. However, we have developed an algorithm for automatic
analysis of spot intensity and instantaneous results on our open-format platform, which will be reported
elsewhere.

Patient samples
De-identified heat-inactivated EDTA plasma samples (57°C for 30 minutes) were accessed from the Duke
COVID-19 ICU biorepository (Pro00101196, PI Bryan Kraft) via an exempted protocol approved by the Duke
University Institutional review board (Pro00105331, PI Ashutosh Chilkoti). Briefly, eligible patients included in
the repository were men and women ages 18 years and above that were admitted to an adult ICU at Duke
University Hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR testing. Samples were collected on study days
1, 3, 7, 14, and 21. In addition to biological samples, clinical data on these patients were also collected including
demographics, laboratory data, and clinical course. All data reported in this paper were obtained with patient
samples from the Duke ICU Biorepository and this study was performed in collaboration with Biorepository team.
Negative control plasma samples were collected under a normal blood donor protocol (Pro00009459, PI
Tony Moody) and range in collection dates from 2014 to 2019 (prior to the COVID-19 outbreak). All patient
information, including demographics, is unknown to the investigator team. These samples were accessed via an
exempted protocol approved by the Duke University Institutional review board (Pro00105331, PI Ashutosh
Chilkoti).
Blood was either purchased commercially (Innovative Research, Inc.) or accessed from the ICU
biorepository (Pro00101196, PI Bryan Kraft) in EDTA-collection tubes and was tested within 48 hours of sample
collection.

Live SARS-CoV-2 Microneutralization assay (MN)
The SARS-CoV-2 virus (Isolate USA-WA1/2020, NR-52281) was deposited by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH. SARS-CoV-2 Micro-neutralization
(MN) assays were adapted from a previous study 51. In short, plasma samples are diluted two-fold and incubated
with 100 TCID50 virus for 1 h. These dilutions are transferred to a 96 well plate containing 2x104 Vero E6 cells
per well. Following a 96 h incubation, cells were fixed with 10% formalin and CPE was determined after staining
with 0.1% crystal violet. Each batch of MN includes a known neutralizing control antibody (Clone D001; SINO,
CAT# 40150-D001). Data are reported as the inverse of the last dilution of plasma that protected from CPE,
log10 transformed.

biorepository. 60 µL of each sample was added to two separate DA-D4 chips, incubated for 30 min, and the
chips were then rinsed using 0.1% Tween in 1x PBS. All slides were scanned with the Genepix tabletop scanner.
IP-10 levels were measured using the LEGENDplex™ Human Proinflammatory Chemokine Panel (13plex) and LEGENDplex™ Human Anti-Virus Response Panel (13-plex) obtained from BioLegend. Assays were
performed with patient serum per the manufacturer’s instructions. The assay was performed using a Beckman
Coulter CytoFLEX flow cytometer and data processing was performed using BioLegend’s Bio-Bits cloud-based
software platform. Each sample was tested in triplicate, and the results are reported as mean of these triplicates.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.4.1 (GraphPad Software, Inc). All
data were log transformed for analysis. To establish statistical significance between two groups (Fig. 2a-c),
unpaired t-tests were used. When comparing multiple groups, a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc
multiple comparisons test was used. Pearson r correlation was used to assess the degree of correlation between
measurements.
