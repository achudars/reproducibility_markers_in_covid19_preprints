ABSTRACT

2

Introduction: Humans and viruses have co-evolved for millennia resulting in a complex host genetic

3

architecture. Understanding the genetic mechanisms of immune response to viral infection provides insight

4

into disease etiology and informs public health interventions.

5

Methods: We conducted a comprehensive study linking germline genetic variation and gene expression

6

with antibody response to 28 antigens for 16 viruses using serological data from 7924 participants in the

7

UK Biobank cohort. Using test results from 2010 UK Biobank subjects, we also investigated genetic

8

determinants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

9

Results: Signals in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region dominated the landscape of viral

10

antibody response, with 40 independent loci and 14 independent classical alleles, 7 of which exhibited

11

pleiotropic effects across viral families. Genome-wide association analyses discovered 7 novel genetic loci

12

associated with viral antibody response (P<5.0´10-8), including FUT2 (19q13.33) for human polyomavirus

13

BK (BKV), STING1 (5q31.2) for Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), as well as CXCR5 (11q23.3) and TBKBP1

14

(17q21.32) for human herpesvirus 7. Transcriptome-wide association analyses identified 114 genes

15

associated with response to viral infection, 12 outside of the HLA region, including ECSCR: P=5.0×10-15

16

(MCV), NTN5: P=1.1×10-9 (BKV), and P2RY13: P=1.1×10-8 (Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen). We also

17

demonstrated pleiotropy between viral response genes and complex diseases, such as C4A expression in

18

varicella zoster virus and schizophrenia. Finally, our analyses of SARS-CoV-2 revealed the first genome-

19

wide significant infection susceptibility signal in EHF, an epithelial-specific transcriptional repressor

20

implicated in airway disease. Targeted analyses of expression quantitative trait loci suggest a possible role

21

for tissue-specific ACE2 expression in modifying SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility.

22

Conclusions: Our study confirms the importance of the HLA region in host response to viral infection and

23

elucidates novel genetic determinants of host-virus interaction. Our results may have implications for

24

complex disease etiology and COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

30

Viruses have been infecting cells for a half a billion years1. During our extensive co-evolution viruses have

31

exerted significant selective pressure on humans; overtly during fatal outbreaks, and covertly through

32

cryptic immune interaction when a pathogen remains latent. The recent pandemic of severe acute

33

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highlights the paramount public health need to

34

understand human genetic variation in response to viral challenge. Clinical variation in COVID-19 severity

35

and symptomatic presentation may be due to differences host genetic factors relating to immune response2.

36

Furthermore, many common infections are cryptically associated with a variety of complex illnesses,

37

especially those with an immunologic component, from cancer to autoimmune and neurologic conditions3-

38

5

39

been conducted on viral infections6-10. Understanding the genetic architecture of immunologic response to

40

viruses may therefore provide new insight into etiologic mechanisms of diverse complex diseases.

41

Several common viruses exert a robust cell mediated and humoral immune response that bi-directionally

42

modulate the balance between latent and lytic infection. Previous studies have identified associations

43

between host polymorphisms in genes relating to cell entry, cytokine production, and immune response

44

and a variety of viruses11. Other studies have demonstrated a strong heritable component (32-48%) of

45

antibody response12. Previous investigations have implicated human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II

46

in the modulation of immune response to diverse viral antigens7,13. Furthermore, during the 2003 severe

47

acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, caused by a betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, an

48

association with infection severity was reported for the HLA-B*46:01 allele in East Asian patients14.

49

In this study we utilize data from the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort15 to evaluate the relationship between host

50

genetics and antibody response to 28 antigens for 16 viruses that have been linked to cancer and

51

neurodegenerative diseases16, as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection. We conduct integrative genome-wide and

52

transcriptome-wide analyses of antibody response and positivity to viral antigens, which elucidate novel

53

genetic underpinnings of viral infection and immune response.

. Despite their broad health relevance, few large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have

METHODS

56

Study Population and Phenotypes

57

The UK Biobank (UKB) is a population-based prospective cohort of over 500,000 individuals aged 40-69

58

years at enrollment in 2006-2010 who completed extensive questionnaires, physical assessments, and

59

provided blood samples15. Analyses were restricted to individuals of predominantly European ancestry

60

based on self-report and after excluding samples with any of the first two genetic ancestry principal

61

components (PCs) outside of 5 standard deviations (SD) of the population mean. We removed samples

62

with discordant self-reported and genetic sex, samples with call rates <97% or heterozygosity >5 SD from

63

the mean, and one sample from each pair of first-degree relatives identified using KING17.

64

Of the 413,810 European ancestry individuals available for analysis, a total of 7948 had serological

65

measures. A multiplex serology panel was performed over a 2-week period using previously developed

66

methods18,19 that have been successfully applied in epidemiological studies7,20. Details of the serology

67

methods and assay validation performance are described in Mentzer et al.16 Briefly, multiplex serology was

68

performed using a bead-based glutathione S-transferase (GST) capture assay with glutathione-casein

69

coated fluorescence-labelled polystyrene beads and pathogen-specific GST-X-tag fusion proteins as

70

antigens16. Each antigen was loaded onto a distinct bead set and the beads were simultaneously presented

71

to primary serum antibodies at serum dilution 1:100016. Immunocomplexes were quantified using a Luminex

72

200 flow cytometer, which produced Median Fluorescence Intensities (MFI) for each antigen. The serology

73

assay showed adequate performance, with a median coefficient of variation (CV) of 17% across all antigens

74

and 3.5% among seropositive samples only16.

75

A total of 5356 records for SARS-CoV-2 test results between March 16, 2020 and May 3, 2020 was provided

76

by Public Health England for 3002 UKB participants. Results based on serum, skin swabs, or specimens

77

of unknown origin (799 records) were excluded due to potentially unreliable detection2. Using the remaining

78

4557 records (2622 participants), cases were classified as individuals with at least one positive SARS-CoV-

79

2 test result based on respiratory specimens. After restricting to individuals of predominantly European

80

ancestry, 676 cases and 1334 controls results remained.

81

Genome-Wide Association Analysis

82

We evaluated the relationship between constitutive genetic variants across the genome and antigens or

83

SARS-CoV-2 status using PLINK 2.0 (October 2017 version). Participants were genotyped on the

84

Affymetrix Axiom UK Biobank array (89%) or the UK BiLEVE array (11%)15 with genome-wide imputation

85

performed using the Haplotype Reference Consortium data and the merged UK10K and 1000 Genomes

86

phase 3 reference panels15. We excluded variants out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at p<1´10-5, call rate

87

<95% (alternate allele dosage required to be within 0.1 of the nearest hard call to be non-missing),

88

imputation quality INFO<0.30, and MAF<0.01.

89

Seropositivity for each antigen was determined using established cut-offs based on prior validation work16.

90

The primary antigen GWAS focused on those with seroprevalence of ³20%, and investigated continuous

91

phenotypes (MFI values), corresponding to the magnitude of antibody response or seroreactivity among

92

seropositive individuals. MFI values were transformed to standard normal distributions using ordered

93

quantile normalization21.

94

The antigen GWAS entailed linear regression of MFI z-scores on genotype. These regression models

95

adjusted for age at enrollment, sex, body-mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status (Townsend deprivation

96

index), the presence of any autoimmune and/or inflammatory conditions, genotyping array, serology assay

97

date, quality control flag indicating sample spillover or an extra freeze/thaw cycle, and the top 10 genetic

98

ancestry principal components (PC’s). Autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions were identified

99

using the following primary and secondary diagnostic ICD-10 codes in Hospital Episode Statistics.

100

Individuals diagnosed with any immunodeficiency (ICD-10 D80-89, n=24) were excluded from all analyses.

101

For all antigens with at least 100 seropositive (or seronegative for pathogens with ubiquitous exposure)

102

individuals, GWAS of discrete seropositivity phenotypes was undertaken using logistic regression, adjusting

103

for the same covariates listed above.

104

The functional relevance of the lead GWAS loci for antibody response was assessed using in-silico

105

functional annotation analyses based on Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD)22 scores and

106

RegulomeDB 2.023, and by leveraging external datasets, such as GTEx v8, DICE (Database of Immune

107

Cell Expression)24, and the Human Plasma Proteome Atlas25,26.

108

Pleiotropic Associations with Disease

109

We explored pleiotropic associations between lead variants influencing antibody levels and several chronic

110

diseases with known or hypothesized viral risk factors. Associations with selected cancers were obtained

111

from a cancer pleiotropy meta-analysis of the UK Biobank and Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging

112

cohorts27. Summary statistics for the schizophrenia GWAS of 33,640 cases and 43,456 controls by Lam et

113

al.28 were downloaded from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Association p-values were obtained

114

from the National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site for the GWAS by

115

Jun et al.29, which included 17,536 cases and 53,711 controls. Associations with p<7.3×10-4 were

116

considered statistically significant after correction for the number of variants and phenotypes tested.

117

HLA Regional Analysis

118

For phenotypes displaying a genome-wide significant signal in the HLA region, independent association

119

signals were ascertained using two complementary approaches: clumping and conditional analysis.

120

Clumping was performed on all variants with P<5´10-8 for each phenotype, as well as across phenotypes.

121

Clumps were formed around sentinel variants with the lowest p-value and all other variants with LD r2>0.05

122

within a ±500kb window were assigned to that variant’s clump.

123

Next, we conducted conditional analyses using a forward stepwise strategy to identify statistically

124

independent signals within each type of variant (SNP/indel or classical HLA allele). A total of 38,655

125

SNPs/indels on chromosome 6 (29,600,000 – 33,200,000 bp) were extracted to conduct regional analyses.

126

Classical HLA alleles were imputed for UKB participants at 4-digit resolution using the HLA*IMP:02

127

algorithm applied to diverse population reference panels15. Imputed dosages were available for 362

128

classical alleles in 11 genes: HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C (class I); HLA-DRB5, HLA-DRB4, HLA-DRB3,

129

HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPA1, and HLA-DPB1 (class II). Analyses were restricted to 101

130

common alleles (frequency ³ 0.01) in 413,810 European ancestry participants. Linear regression models

131

were adjusted for the same set of covariates as the GWAS.

132

For each antigen response phenotype, we identified genetic variants (SNPs/indels or classical HLA alleles)

133

with the lowest p-value and performed forward iterative conditional regression to identify other independent

134

signals, until no associations with a conditional p-value (Pcond)<5×10-8 remained. Conditional analyses of

135

classical HLA alleles were restricted to Bonferroni-significant associations corrected for 101 alleles

136

(P<5×10-4) in the unconditional analysis. We also assessed the independence of associations across

137

different types of genetic variants by including conditionally independent HLA alleles as covariates in the

138

SNP-based analysis.

139

Genetic Associations With SARS-CoV-2 Status

140

GWAS of SARS-CoV-2 status was conducted using logistic regression with adjustment for age at

141

assessment, sex, BMI, Townsend index, specimen origin (confirmed inpatient vs. unknown), genotyping

142

array, the top 10 PC’s, and smoking status. We also examined associations with 101 common classical

143

HLA alleles. Based on recent evidence that SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor encoded by the ACE2 gene for

144

cell entry30, we evaluated associations between significant ACE2 eQTLs in any tissue (qFDR<0.05) identified

145

in GTEx and SARS-CoV-2 test status. The overall relationship between ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-

146

2 was quantified using a linear regression model with log(OR) for testing positive as the outcome and eQTL

147

effect size as the predictor, clustered by tissue type. We further investigated this relationship using

148

genotyping data and ACE2 expression in lung tissues from 409 subjects that underwent lung cancer surgery

149

at the Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (IUCPQ)31.

150

Transcriptome-Wide Association Analysis

151

Gene transcription levels were imputed and analyzed using the MetaXcan approach32, applied to GWAS

152

summary statistics for quantitative antigen phenotypes. For imputation, we used biologically informed

153

MASHR-M prediction models33 based on GTEx v8 with effect sizes computed using MASHR (Multivariate

154

Adaptive Shrinkage in R)34 for variants fine-mapped with DAP-G (Deterministic Approximation of

155

Posteriors)35,36. An advantage of this approach is that MASHR effect sizes are smoothed by taking

156

advantage of the correlation in cis-eQTL effects across tissues. For each antigen, we performed a

157

transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using gene expression levels in whole blood. Statistically

158

significant associations for each gene were determined based on Bonferroni correction for the number of

159

genes tested.

160

We also examined gene expression profiles in tissues that represent known infection targets or related

161

pathologies. Human herpesviruses and polyomaviruses are neurotropic and have been implicated in

162

several neurological conditions37,38, therefore we considered gene expression in the frontal cortex. For

163

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens additional models included EBV-transformed lymphocytes. Merkel cell

164

polyomavirus (MCV) is a known cause of Merkel cell carcinoma39, a rare but aggressive type of skin cancer,

165

therefore we examined transcriptomic profiles in skin tissues for MCV only.

166

Pathways represented by genes associated with antibody response to viral antigens were summarized by

167

conducting enrichment analysis using curated Reactome gene sets and by examining protein interaction

168

networks using the STRING database40. Significantly associated TWAS genes were grouped by virus family

169

(herpesviruses vs. polyomaviruses) and specificity of association (multiple antigens vs. single antigen).

170

Protein interaction analyses were restricted to genes associated with more than one antigen. We

171

considered unidirectional functional interactions with confidence scores ≥400 (medium).

172

RESULTS

173

A random sample of the participants representative of the full UKB cohort was assayed using a multiplex

174

serology panel16. We analyzed data from 7924 participants of predominantly European ancestry, described

175

in Supplementary Table 1. Approximately 90% of individuals were seropositive for herpes family viruses

176

with ubiquitous exposure: EBV (EBV EA-D: 86.2% to ZEBRA: 91.2%), Human Herpesvirus 7 (HHV7

177

94.8%), and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV 92.3%). Seroprevalence was somewhat lower for cytomegalovirus

178

(CMV), ranging between 56.5% (CMV pp28) and 63.3% (CMV pp52), and Herpes Simplex virus-1 (HSV1

179

69.3%). Human polyomavirus BKV was more prevalent (95.3%) compared to other polyomaviruses, Merkel

180

cell polyoma virus (MCV 66.1%) and polyomavirus JC (JCV) (56.6%). Less common infections included

181

HSV-2 (15.2%), HPV16 (E6 and E7 oncoproteins: 4.7%), HPV18 (2.4%), Human T-cell lymphotropic virus

182

type 1 (HTLV1, 1.6%), Hepatitis B (HBV, 1.6%), and Hepatitis C (HCV, 0.3%).

183

Baseline characteristics of 3002 UKB participants with SARS-CoV-2 test results up to May 3, 2020 are

184

described in Supplementary Table 2. Compared to the full UKB cohort, individuals who were tested for

185

SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be ever smokers (51.9% vs. 45.2%), had higher mean BMI (28.5 vs. 27.4

kg/m2), higher levels of deprivation based on the Townsend index, and a higher burden of comorbidities

187

based on the Charlson index (1 or more: 45.8% vs. 29.8%). Comparing within participants who were tested,

188

those with at least one positive SARS-CoV-2 test result included a higher proportion of men (54.1% vs.

189

40.6%), former smokers (41.6% vs. 37.0%), and self-identified as non-white (12.2% vs. 8.1%). The two

190

groups had similar distributions of other health-related characteristics. The final analytic dataset included

191

676 cases and 1334 controls of European ancestry with test results from respiratory samples.

192

Genetic Determinants of Response to Viral Infection

193

Results from our GWAS of antibody response phenotypes were dominated by signals in the HLA region,

194

which were detected for all EBV antigens (EA-D, EBNA, p18, ZEBRA), CMV pp52, HSV1, HHV7, VZV, JCV

195

and MCV (Table 1; Supplementary Figure 1). Most of the top-ranking HLA variants for each antigen were

196

independent of those for other antigens (Supplementary Figure 2). Exceptions were moderate LD

197

between lead variants for EBV ZEBRA and HSV1 (r2=0.45), EBV EBNA and JCV (r2=0.45), and HHV7 and

198

MCV (r2=0.44). Outside of the HLA region, genome-wide significant associations with seroreactivity were

199

detected for: MCV at 3p24.3 (rs776170649, LOC339862: P=1.7´10-8) and 5q31.2 (rs7444313, TMEM173

200

(also known as STING1): P=2.4´10-15); BKV at 19q13.3 (rs681343, FUT2: P=4.7´10-15) (Figure 1); EBV

201

EBNA at 3q25.1 (rs67886110, MED12L: P=1.3´10-9); HHV-7 at 11q23.3 (rs75438046, CXCR5: P=1.3´10-

202

8

203

GWAS of discrete seropositivity phenotypes identified associations in HLA for EBV EA-D (rs2395192:

204

OR=0.66, P=4.0´10-19), EBV EBNA (rs9268848: OR=1.60, P=1.2´10-18), EBV ZEBRA (rs17211342: 0.63,

205

P=1.6´10-15), VZV (rs3096688: OR=0.70, P=3.7´10-8), JCV (rs9271147: OR=0.54, P=1.3´10-42), and MCV

206

(rs17613347: OR=0.61, P=1.2´10-26) (Supplementary Figure 1; Supplementary Table 3). An association

207

with susceptibility to MCV infection was also observed at 5q31.2 (rs1193730215, ECSCR: OR=1.26,

208

P=7.2´10-9), with high LD (r2=0.95) between seroreactivity and seropositivity lead variants.

209

Several significant associations were observed for antigens with <20% seroprevalence, which were not

210

included in the GWAS of antibody response due to inadequate sample size (Supplementary Table 3).

211

Significant associations with infection susceptibility were observed for HSV2 in 17p13.2 (rs2116443:

) and 17q21.3 (rs1808192, TBKBP1: P=9.8´10-9); and HSV-1 at 10q23.3 (rs11203123: P=3.9´10-8).

214

(rs4243652: OR=3.13, P=7.0´10-10). Associations were also detected for Kaposi's sarcoma-associated

215

herpesvirus (KSHV), HTLV1, HBV and HCV, including a variant in the MERTK oncogene (HCV Core

216

rs199913364: OR=0.25, P=1.2´10-8).

Functional Characterization of GWAS Findings

218

In-silico functional analyses of the lead 17 GWAS variants identified enrichment for multiple regulatory

219

elements (summarized in Supplementary Table 4). Three variants were predicted to be in the top 10% of

220

deleterious substitutions in GRCh37 based on CADD scores >10: rs776170649 (MCV, CADD=15.61),

221

rs139299944 (HHV7, CADD=12.15), and rs9271525 (JCV, CADD=10.73). Another HHV7-associated

222

variant, rs1808192 (RegulomeDB rank: 1f), an eQTL and sQTL for TBKBP1, mapped to 44 functional

223

elements for multiple transcription factors, including IKZF1, a critical regulator of lymphoid differentiation

224

frequently mutated in B-cell malignancies.

225

Eleven sentinel variants were eQTLs and 8 were splicing QTLs in GTEx, with significant (FDR<0.05) effects

226

across multiple genes and tissues (Supplementary Figure 3). The most common eQTL and sQTL targets

227

included HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQB2, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DRB6. Outside of HLA,

228

rs681343 (BKV), a synonymous FUT2 variant was an eQTL for 8 genes, including FUT2 and NTN5. MCV

229

variant in 5q31.2, rs7444313, was an eQTL for 7 genes, with concurrent sQTL effects on TMEM173, also

230

known as STING1 (stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1) and CXXC5. Gene expression

231

profiles in immune cell populations from DICE24 identified several cell-type specific effects that were not

232

observed in GTEx. An association with HLA-DQB1 expression in CD4+ TH2 cells was observed for

233

rs9273325, 6:31486158_GT_G was an eQTL for ATP6V1G2 in naïve CD4+ T cells, and rs1130420

234

influenced the expression of 8 HLA class II genes in naïve B-cells and CD4+ TH17 cells.

235

We identified 7 significant (p<5.0´10-8) protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) for 38 proteins (Supplementary

236

Table 5). Most of the pQTL targets were components of the adaptive immune response, such as the

237

complement system (C4, CFB), chemokines (CCL15, CCL25), and defensin processing (Beta-defensin 19,

; HLA-DRB1) and 19q12 (rs144341759: OR=0.383, P=4.0´10-8; CTC-448F2.6); and HPV18 in 14q24.3

Trypsin-3). The greatest number and diversity of pQTL targets (n=16) was observed for rs681343, including

239

BPIFB1, which plays a role in antimicrobial response in oral and nasal mucosa41; FUT3, which catalyzes

240

the last step of Lewis antigen biosynthesis; and FGF19, part of the PI3K/Akt/MAPK signaling cascade that

241

is dysregulated in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases42.

242

Pleiotropic associations with disease outcomes

243

To contextualize the relevance of genetic loci involved in infection response, we explored associations with

244

selected cancers, schizophrenia, and that have a known or suspected viral etiology (Supplementary Table

245

6). The strongest secondary signal was observed for rs9273325, which was negatively associated with VZV

246

antibody response and positively associated with schizophrenia susceptibility (OR=1.13, P=4.3´10-15).

247

Other significant (Bonferroni P<7.4´10-4) associations with schizophrenia were detected for HSV1

248

(rs1130420: OR=1.06, P=1.8´10-5), EBV EA-D (rs2647006: OR=0.96, P=2.7´10-4), BKV, (rs681343:

249

OR=0.96, P=2.5´10-4) and JCV (rs9271525: OR=1.06, P=6.8´10-5). Inverse associations with hematologic

250

cancers were observed for HSV1 (rs1130420: OR=0.89, P=3.5´10-6), VZV (rs9273325: OR=0.88,

251

P=4.4´10-5), and EBV EBNA (rs9269233: OR=0.88, P=2.7´10-4) variants. HSV1 antibody response was

252

also linked to Alzheimer’s disease (rs1130420: P=1.2´10-4).

253

Regional HLA Associations

254

Associations within the HLA region were refined by identifying independent (LD r2<0.05 within ±500kb)

255

sentinel variants with P<5.0´10-8 for each antigen response phenotype (Supplementary Table 7).

256

Clumping seropositivity associations with respect to lead antibody response variants did not retain any loci,

257

suggesting non-independence in signals for infection and reactivity for the same antigen. For this reason,

258

all subsequent analyses focus on seroreactivity phenotypes. Clumping across phenotypes to assess the

259

independence of HLA associations for different antigens identified 40 independent sentinel variants: EBV

260

EBNA (12), VZV (11), EBV ZEBRA (8), EBV p18 (5), MCV (3), and EBV EA-D (1) (Supplementary Table

261

9). No LD clumps were anchored by variants detected for CMV pp52, HHV7, HSV1, or JCV, suggesting

262

that the HLA signals for these antigens are captured by lead loci for other phenotypes. The largest region

263

with the lowest p-value was anchored by rs9274728 (P=4.7´10-67) near HLA-DQB1, originally detected for

264

EBV ZEBRA. Of the 11 VZV-associated variants, the largest clump was formed around rs4990036

265

(P=4.5´10-26) in HLA-B.

266

Iterative conditional analyses adjusting for the HLA SNP/indel with the lowest p-value were performed until

267

no variants remained with Pcond<5.0´10-8. Additional independent variants were identified for EBV EBNA

268

(rs139299944, rs6457711, rs9273358, rs28414666, rs3097671), EBV ZEBRA (rs2904758, rs35683320,

269

rs1383258), EBV p18 (rs6917363, rs9271325, rs66479476), and MCV (rs148584120, rs4148874) (Figure

270

2; Supplementary Table 8). For CMV pp52, HHV7, HSV1, JCV, and VZV, the regional HLA signal was

271

captured by the top GWAS variant (Figure 2; Supplementary Table 8).

272

Next, we tested 101 classical HLA alleles and performed analogous iterative conditional analyses.

273

Significant associations across viruses were predominantly observed for class II HLA alleles. Five

274

statistically independent signals were identified for antibody response to EBV ZEBRA (DRB4*99:01:

275

P=1.4´10-46; DQB1*04:02: Pcond=1.0´10-19; DRB1*04:04: Pcond=1.1´10-18; DQA1*02:01: Pcond=1.1´10-10,

276

A*03:01: Pcond=1.9´10-8) and EBV EBNA (DRB5*99:01: P=8.7´10-30; DRB3*02:02: Pcond=6.8´10-30;

277

DQB1*02:01: Pcond=3.6´10-12; DRB4*99:01: Pcond=8.3´10-17; DPB1*03:01: Pcond=4.7´10-14) (Figure 3;

278

Supplementary Tables 10-11). Fewer independent alleles were observed for EBV p18 (DRB5*99:01:

279

P=1.7´10-22; DRB1*04:04: Pcond=1.3´10-18) (Figure 3; Supplementary Tables 12).

280

DQB1*02:01 was the only independently associated allele for EBV EA-D (b=-0.154, P=8.4´10-11) and HSV1

281

(b=0.145, P=2.8´10-8), although its effects were in opposite directions for each antigen (Supplementary

282

Table 13). For VZV, associations with 16 classical alleles were accounted for by DRB1*03:01 (P=7.3´10-

283

26

284

(Supplementary Table 13). Four conditionally independent signals were identified for MCV (DQA1*01:01:

285

P=1.1´10-15; DRB1*04:04: Pcond=3.0´10-11; A*29:02: P=1.0´10-11; DRB1*15:01: P=3.7´10-12) (Figure 3;

286

Supplementary Table 14). Lastly, we integrated associations across variant types by including

287

conditionally independent HLA alleles as covariates in the SNP-based analysis. With the exception of EBV

288

antigens and HHV7, the classical alleles captured all genome-wide significant SNP signals

289

(Supplementary Figure 5).

). JCV shared the same lead allele as EBV EBNA and EBV p18 (DRB5*99:01: P=1.2´10-21)

Genetic Associations With SARS-CoV-2 Status

291

We detected a significant association with having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test for rs286914 (OR=1.52,

292

P=2.0´10-8) in EHF (ETS homologous factor) on 11p13, a gene part of the ETS transcription factor family

293

characterized by epithelial-specific expression (Table 2; Supplementary Table 4). Sensitivity analyses

294

using remaining UKB subjects (n=411,795) further demonstrate that rs286914 confers an increased risk of

295

SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR=1.22, P=5.0´10-4) and reduced likelihood of having a negative test (OR=0.81,

296

P=7.2´10-6). However, rs286914 was not associated with being tested for SARS-CoV-2 (P=0.10). We also

297

identified two classical HLA alleles inversely associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2):

298

DQA1*03:01 (OR=0.80, P=0.012) and A*31:01 (OR=0.53, P=0.019). The former was also associated with

299

antibody response to five viral antigens (Bonferroni-corrected P<5´10-4).

300

We observed tissue-dependent and inconsistent associations between SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and

301

ACE2 expression. A total of 288 significant (qFDR<0.05) eQTLs were available in GTEx v8 for 9 tissue types

302

(adipose, artery, brain, breast, nerve, muscle, pituitary, prostate, testis), but no significant eQTLs were

303

available for lung. After restricting to independent eQTLs (LD r2<0.10) available in our GWAS (n=10), we

304

identified two variants inversely associated SARS-CoV-2: rs11798628 (OR=0.88, P=5.1´10-3) and

305

rs4830974 (OR=0.77, P=0.026) (Table 2). There was negative overall association (-0.293, P=1.3´10-3)

306

between ACE2 expression and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Figure 6). However,

307

based on eQTLs in lung tissue (LD r2<0.10; qFDR<0.05), a weak positive relationship was observed (0.098,

308

P=0.13) with infection status. None of the significant lung eQTLs were associated with testing positive for

309

SARS-CoV-2, but we identified a potential risk variant (rs5934251: OR=2.12, P=5.3´10-4) among nominally

310

associated lung ACE2 eQTLs (Table 2). We also note limited overlap in ACE2 eQTLs across tissues, with

311

only 6 GTEx eQTLs from other tissues being associated with lung ACE2 expression at P<0.05.

312

TWAS of Genes Involved in Antibody Response

313

Based on known targets of infection or related pathologies, we considered expression in the frontal cortex

314

(Supplementary Table 15), EBV-transformed lymphocytes for EBV antigens (Supplementary Table 16),

315

and skin for MCV (Supplementary Table 17). Concordance across tissues was summarized using Venn

316

diagrams (Figure 4; Supplementary Figure 5). TWAS identified 114 genes significantly associated

317

(PTWAS<4.2×10-6) with antibody response in at least one tissue, 54 of which were associated with a single

318

phenotype, while 60 influenced seroreactivity to multiple antigens. We also include results for 92 additional

319

suggestively (PTWAS<4.5×10-5) associated genes.

320

The TWAS results included a predominance of associations in HLA class II genes. Some of the strongest

321

overall associations were observed for HLA-DRB5 (EBV ZEBRA: Pcortex=4.2×10-45) and HLA-DRB1 (EBV

322

EBNA: Pcortex=6.7×10-39; EBV ZEBRA: Pcortex=3.3×10-33; JCV: Pcortex=6.5×10-14; EBV p18: Pcortex=2.2×10-12).

323

Increased expression of HLA-DQB2 was positively associated with antibody response to EBV ZEBRA

324

(Pblood=7.6×10-19), JCV (Pblood=9.9×10-10), VZV (Pblood=7.0×10-9), HHV7 (Pblood=7.3×10-8), and HSV1

325

(Pblood=3.3×10-7), but negatively associated with EBV EBNA (Pblood=3.6×10-34) and EBV p18 (Pblood=2.1×10-

327

on EBV EBNA and EBV p18 and inverse associations with EBV ZEBRA, JCV, VZV, HHV7, and HSV1.

328

The TWAS analyses also identified a number of significant associations in the HLA class III region that

329

were not detected in other analyses. The top-ranking VZV associated gene was APOM (Pblood=7.5×10-27,

330

Pcortex=1.1´10-25). Interestingly, opposite directions of effect for C4A and C4B gene expression. Increased

331

C4A expression was positively associated with all EBV antigens (Supplementary Table 16), but negatively

332

associated with VZV (Pblood=2.3×10-24) and HSV1 (Pcortex=1.8×10-5) antibody levels (Supplementary Table

333

15). On the other hand, increased C4B expression was inversely associated with EBV phenotypes, but

334

positively associated with VZV (Pblood=8.1×10-25) and HSV1 (Pblood=1.1×10-5). A similar pattern was also

335

observed for CYP21A2 and C2, with positive effects on antibody response to VZV and HSV1, and negative

336

effects for all EBV antigens. Other novel TWAS findings were detected for HHV7 in 22q13.2 (CTA-223H9.9:

337

PTWAS=2.5×10-6; CSDC2: PTWAS=3.0×10-6; TEF: PTWAS=3.1×10-6) and 1q31.2 (RGS1: PTWAS=3.3×10-6).

338

The TWAS recapitulated several GWAS-identified loci: 3q25.1 for EBV EBNA (P2RY13: Pcortex=1.1×10-8;

339

P2RY12: Pblood=3.3×10-8) and 19q13.33 for BKV (FUT2: PTWAS=8.1×10-13; NTN5: PTWAS=1.1×10-9).

340

Transcriptomic profiles in skin tissues provided supporting evidence for the role of multiple genes in 5q31.2

341

in modulating MCV antibody response (Figure 4; Supplementary Table 17). The strongest signal was

342

observed in for ECSCR (skin sun unexposed: PTWAS=5.0×10-15; skin sun exposed: PTWAS=4.2×10-13),

), in a consistent manner across tissues. The opposite was observed for HLA-DQB1, with positive effects

343

followed by PROB1 (sun unexposed: PTWAS=1.5×10-11). ECSCR expression was also associated based on

344

expression in the frontal cortex, while PROB1 exhibited a significant, but attenuated effect in whole blood.

345

VWA7 was the only gene associated across all four tissues for MCV and was also associated with antibody

346

response to several EBV antigens.

347

Comparison of results for seroreactivity and seropositivity revealed a number of genes implicated in both

348

steps of the infection process (Supplementary Table 18). Associations with HLA DQA and DQB genes in

349

whole blood and HLA-DRB genes in the frontal cortex were observed for EBV antigens, JCV, and MCV.

350

For MCV, the strongest seropositivity signals were observed for HLA class III genes AGER (Pcortex=9.0×10-

351

21

352

Increased ECSCR expression conferred an increased susceptibility to MCV infection (Pcortex=1.8×10-8),

353

mirroring its effect on seroreactivity. In contrast to antibody response, no significant associations with any

354

HLA genes were observed for VZV seropositivity.

355

Analyses using the Reactome database identified significant (qFDR<0.05) enrichment for TWAS-identified

356

genes in pathways involved in initiating antiviral responses, such as MHC class II antigen presentation,

357

TCR signaling, and interferon (IFN) signaling (Supplementary Figure 7). Pathways unique to

358

herpesviruses included folding, assembly and peptide loading of class I MHC (q=3.2×10-7) and initial

359

triggering of complement (q=9.8×10-3). Polyomaviruses were associated with the non-canonical nuclear

360

factor (NF)-kB pathway activated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily (q=1.9×10-3). Protein

361

interaction networks among genes associated with more than antigen identified 21 significant (qFDR<0.05)

362

nodes, most of which were centered around HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1, and involved interactions with

363

other MHC class II molecules, C4, and TNF (Supplementary Figure 8).

364

DISCUSSION

365

We performed genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association studies for serological phenotypes for 16

366

common viruses in a well-characterized, population-based cohort. We discovered novel genetic

367

determinants of viral antibody response beyond the HLA region for BKV, MCV, HHV7, EBV EBNA, as well

368

as SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Our comprehensive HLA analyses demonstrate that class II and III genes

) and EHMT2 (Pblood=5.8×10-18), which were also among the top-ranking genes for seroreactivity.

369

are crucial host genetic factors involved in regulating immune response to diverse viral antigens7. Taken

370

together, the findings of this work provide a resource for further understanding the complex interplay

371

between viruses and the human genome, as well as a first step towards understanding germline

372

determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

373

One of our main findings is the discovery of 5q31.2 as a susceptibility locus for MCV infection and MCV

374

antibody response, implicating two main genes: TMEM173 (or STING1) and ECSCR. The former encodes

375

STING (stimulator of interferon genes), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that controls the transcription

376

of host defense genes and plays a critical role in response to DNA and RNA viruses43. STING is activated

377

by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a cytosolic DNA sensor that mounts a response to invading

378

pathogens by inducing IFN1 and NF-kB signalling44,45. Polyomaviruses penetrate the ER membrane during

379

cell entry, a process that may be unique to this viral family46, which may trigger STING signaling in a distinct

380

manner from other viruses46. Multiple cancer-causing viruses, such as KSHV, HBV, and HPV18, encode

381

oncoproteins that disrupt cGAS-STING activity, which illustrates the evolutionary pressure on DNA tumor

382

viruses to develop functions against this pathway and its importance in carcinogenesis44. Furthermore,

383

cGAS-STING activation has been shown to trigger antitumor T-cell responses, a mechanism that can be

384

leveraged by targeted immunotherapies

385

against tumors resistant to PD-1 blockade, as well as promising adjuvants in cancer vaccines50-52.

386

ECSCR expression in skin and brain tissues was associated with MCV antibody response and infection.

387

This gene encodes an endothelial cell-specific chemotaxis regulator, which plays a role in angiogenesis

388

and apoptosis53. ECSCR is a negative regulator of PI3K/Akt signaling by enhancing membrane localization

389

of PTEN and operates in tandem with VEGFR-2 and other receptor tyrosine kinases54. In addition to 5q31.2,

390

another novel MCV seroreactivity associated region was identified in 3p24.3, anchored by rs776170649,

391

which has been linked to platelet phenotypes55. These findings align with a role of platelet activation in

392

defense against infections via degranulation-mediated release of chemokines and β-defensin56.

393

Genetic variation within Fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) has been studied extensively in the context of human

394

infections; however, its effect on BKV seroreactivity is novel. Homozygotes for the nonsense mutation

395

(rs601338 G>A) that inactivates the FUT2 enzyme are unable to secrete ABO(H) histo-blood group

47-49

. Several studies suggest STING agonists may be effective

antigens or express them on mucosal surfaces57,58. The allele which confers increased BKV antibody

397

response (rs681343-T) is in LD (r2=1.00) with rs601338-A, the non-secretor allele, which confers resistance

398

to norovirus59,60, rotavirus61, H. pylori62, childhood ear infection, mumps, and common colds13. However,

399

increased susceptibility to other pathogens, such as meningococcus and pneumococcus63 has also been

400

observed in non-secretors. Isolating the underlying mechanisms for BKV response is challenging because

401

FUT2 is a pleiotropic locus associated with diverse phenotypes, including autoimmune and inflammatory

402

conditions64,65, serum lipids66, B vitamins58,67, alcohol consumption68, and even certain cancers69. In addition

403

to FUT2 in 19q13.33, NTN5 (netrin 5) suggests a possible link between BKV and neurological conditions.

404

NTN5 is primarily expressed in neuroproliferative areas, suggesting a role in adult neurogenesis, which is

405

dysregulated in glioblastoma and Alzheimer’s disease70,71.

406

We also report the first GWAS of serological phenotypes for HHV7. Genetic determinants of HHV7 antibody

407

response in 6p21.32 were predominantly localized in HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1, with associations similar

408

to other herpesviruses. In 11q23.3, rs75438046 maps to the 3′ UTR of CXCR5, which controls viral infection

409

in B-cell follicles72, and BCL9L, a translocation target in acute lymphoblastic leukemia73 and transcriptional

410

activator of the Wnt/β-catenin cancer signaling pathway74. In 17q21.32, TBKBP1 encodes an adaptor

411

protein that binds to TBK1 and is part of the TNF/NF-kB interaction network, where it regulates immune

412

responses to infectious triggers, such as IFN1 signaling75. Interestingly, a protein interactome map recently

413

revealed that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 13 (Nsp13) includes TBK1-TBKBP1 among its targets 76.

414

Other functions of the TBK1-TBKBP1 axis relate to tumor growth and immunosuppression through induction

415

of PD-L177.

416

Several additional genes involved in HHV7 immune response were identified in TWAS. TEF in 22q13.2 is

417

an apoptotic regulator of hematopoietic progenitors with tumor promoting effects mediated by inhibition of

418

G1/S cell cycle transition and Akt/FOXO signaling78. RGS1 in 1q31.2 has been linked to multiple

419

autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis79, as well as poor prognosis in melanoma and diffuse

420

large B cell lymphoma mediated by inactivation of Akt/ERK80,81.

421

Other genes outside of the HLA region associated with viral infection response were detected for EBV

422

EBNA in 3q25.1. The lead variant (rs67886110) is an eQTL for MED12L and P2RY12 genes, which have

423

been linked to neurodegenerative conditions82,83. P2RY12 and P2RY13, identified in TWAS, are purinergic

424

receptor genes that regulate microglia homeostasis and have been implicated in Alzheimer’s susceptibility

425

via inflammatory and neurotrophic mechanisms83.

426

Considering genetic variation within the HLA region, our results not only confirm its pivotal role at the

427

interface of host pathogen interactions, but also highlight the overlap in variants, classical alleles, and genes

428

that mediate these interactions across virus families and antigens. We identified 40 independent

429

SNPs/indels associated with EBV (EBNA, EA-D, VCA p18, and ZEBRA), VZV, and MCV antibody response

430

that accounted for all significant HLA associations for other phenotypes. Of the 14 conditionally

431

independent, genome-wide significant classical alleles identified for 10 antigens, 7 were associated with

432

multiple phenotypes. The most commonly shared HLA alleles were DRB5*99:01, DRB1*04:04, an know

433

rheumatoid arthritis risk allele84, and DQB1*02:01, which is implicated in susceptibility to celiac disease85.

434

Furthermore, nodes anchored by HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 were at the center of the protein interaction

435

network identified for TWAS genes that were implicated in antibody response to multiple antigens. Despite

436

the predominance of association in HLA class II, one notable association in HLA class I was detected for

437

A*29:02 and MCV seroreactivity, which is consistent with downregulation of MHC I as a potential

438

mechanism through which Merkel cell tumors evade immune surveillance86.

439

Comparison with other studies of host genetics and viral infection susceptibility shows that our results align

440

with previously reported findings. We replicated (P<5´10-8) many associations from a GWAS of humoral

441

immune response by Hammer et al.7, specifically HLA signals for MCV (rs1049130, DQB1*06:02), JCV

442

(rs9269910, DQA1*01:02), and EBV EBNA (DRB1*07:01, HLA-DRB1*03:01, also reported by Scepanovic

443

et al8). Associations with JCV seroreactivity replicated (P<5´10-8) class II HLA alleles (DQB1*03:01,

444

DQB1*06:02, and DQA1*01:02) linked to JCV infection in a cohort of multiple sclerosis patients and

445

population-based controls87. We also replicated two HLA-DRB1 variants (rs477515, rs2854275: P<5´10-

L1 replicated a variant previously linked to HPV8 seropositivity (rs9357152, P=0.008)6. Some of our findings

451

be an imprecise indicator of infection with certain viruses.

452

One of the most striking findings in SNP-based HLA analyses was the genome-wide significant association

453

between rs9273325, sentinel VZV antibody response variant, and risk of schizophrenia. This observation

454

is consistent with the established role the HLA region, including HLA-DQB1, in schizophrenia etiology88,89,

455

and is further supported by previously reported associations for rs9273325 with blood cell traits55 and

456

immunoglobulin A deficiency90, as well as its role as an eQTL for HLA-DQB1 in CD4+ T2h cells. An inverse

457

association with schizophrenia has been reported for DRB1*03:0188, the lead HLA allele associated with

458

increased VZV antibody response. Two other strongly associated schizophrenia alleles, HLA-DQB1:02 and

459

HLA-B*08:01, were also among the top VZV-associated variants (P<5´10-25) in the unconditional analysis.

460

Enhanced complement activity has been proposed as the mechanism mediating the synaptic loss and

461

excessive pruning which is a hallmark of schizophrenia pathophysiology91. Complement component 4 (C4)

462

alleles were found to increase risk of schizophrenia proportionally to their effect on increasing C4A

463

expression in brain tissue91. Using gene expression models in whole blood and the frontal cortex we

464

demonstrated that increased C4A expression is negatively associated with VZV antibody response. We

465

also observed associations with C4A and C4B in EBV and HSV-1, but not other viruses. Taken together,

466

these findings delineate a potential mechanism through which aberrant immune response to VZV infection,

467

and potentially HSV-1 and EBV infection, may increase susceptibility to schizophrenia.

468

The main finding of our genetic associations analyses of SARS-CoV-2 infection status was the discovery

469

of a genome-wide significant signal in EHF (rs286914), which encodes a transcriptional repressor that plays

470

a critical role in lung inflammation and response to injury92 and modifies disease severity in cystic fibrosis93.

471

Since EHF occupies the relatively common ETS motif, allowing it to up- or down-regulate gene expression,

472

the mechanism of action most relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 symptom severity may

473

depend on its interactions with other transcription factors. We also identified nominal inverse associations

474

with SARS-CoV-2 infection for HLA A*31:01 allele, which has been implicated in immune-mediated adverse

475

reactions to anticonvulsant carbamazepine94, and DQA1*03:01, which is a part of a known type I diabetes

476

susceptibility haplotype95. We were unable to assess the role of B*46:01, previously linked to 2003 SARS

). These differences may be partly accounted for by self-reported disease status in Tian et al. which may

477

in an East Asian population, due to the low frequency (3.2×10-5) of this allele in our data. This illustrates the

478

need for studies in large, genetically diverse populations to elucidate the role of HLA in SARS-CoV-2

479

infection dynamics.

480

The relationship between genetically predicted ACE2 gene expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection appears

481

to be complex and tissue-dependent. ACE2 is expressed at high levels in intestinal organs, adipose tissue,

482

kidney, heart, and testis and has multiple significant eQTLs in different brain structures. Based on

483

expression profiles in these diverse tissues, we observed an inverse association between genetically

484

predicted ACE2 levels and having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. However, considering ACE2 expression in

485

lung tissue, we observed a trend towards higher expression conferring increased SARS-CoV-2

486

susceptibility, which is consistent with increased expression facilitating increased receptor availability.

487

SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor for cell entry30, yet studies of betacoronavirus SARS have shown

488

that ACE2 is downregulated upon viral establishment96, which is believed to be the molecular basis of

489

COVID-19 respiratory distress. The role of ACE2 expression in susceptibility to infection remains unclear

490

and may be modulated by tissue-specific post-translational regulation. Further research is needed to

491

elucidate the pathways through which ACE2 may influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection as well

492

as COVID-19 symptom severity.

493

While the reported associations for SARS-CoV-2 were based on a limited sample size, we believe these

494

findings may be informative when considered in the context of our results for other viral infections, and

495

contribute to the global, pressing need to understand COVID-19, which motivated our rapid analysis of

496

these data. However, care must be taken with the interpretation of genetic associations with SARS-CoV-2

497

status, which should be regarded as preliminary and exploratory given the small number of tests conducted

498

in a biased sample, confounding by factors related to symptom recognition, access to testing, and limited

499

statistical power.

500

Several additional limitations of this work should be noted. First, the UK Biobank is unrepresentative of the

501

general UK population due to low participation resulting in healthy volunteer bias97. However, since the

502

observed pattern of seroprevalence is consistent with previously published estimates16 we believe the

503

impact of this bias is likely to be minimal on genetic associations with serological phenotypes. Second, our

20

504

analyses were restricted to participants of European ancestry due to limited serology data for other

505

ancestries, which limits the generalizability of our findings to diverse populations. Third, we were unable to

506

conduct formal statistical replication of novel GWAS and TWAS signals in an independent sample due to

507

the lack of such a population. Nevertheless, our successful replication of multiple previously reported

508

variants and, combined with the observation that newly discovered genes and variants are part of essential

509

adaptive and innate immunity pathways, support the credibility of our findings. Lastly, we also stress caution

510

in the interpretation of GWAS results for non-ubiquitous pathogens, such as HBV, HCV, and HPV, due to

511

a lack of information on exposure, as well as low numbers of seropositive individuals.

512

Our study also has distinct advantages. The large sample size of the UK Biobank facilitated more powerful

513

genetic association analyses than previous studies, particularly in a population-based cohort unselected for

514

disease status. Our detailed HLA analysis shows independent effects of specific HLA alleles and pleiotropic

515

effects across multiple viruses. Analyses of genetic associations in external datasets further demonstrate

516

a connection between host genetic factors influencing immune response to infection and susceptibility to

517

cancers and neurological conditions. Finally, integration of SARS-CoV-2 test results with findings for

518

serology measures for common viruses provides previously unknown context for putative associations.

519

The results of this work highlight widespread genetic pleiotropy between pathways involved in regulating

520

humoral immune response to novel and common viruses, as well as complex diseases. Understanding the

521

interplay between host genetic factors and immune response has implications for public health and may

522

facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutics including vaccines.

Figure 4: TWAS associations with continuous antigen response phenotypes. Two Manhattan plots depicting the
transcriptome-wide associations for genes with a positive direction of effect (increased expression leads to higher
antibody response) and genes with a negative direction of effect (increased expression is associated with a reduced
antibody response).
