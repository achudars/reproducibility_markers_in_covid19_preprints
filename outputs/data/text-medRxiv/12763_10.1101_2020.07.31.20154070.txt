Abstract
After lifting the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and opening businesses, screening is essential to prevent
the spread of the virus. Group testing could be a promising candidate for screening to save time and resources.
However, due to the high false-negative rate (FNR) of the RT-PCR diagnostic test, we should be cautious
about using group testing because a group’s false-negative result identifies all the individuals in a group as
uninfected. Repeating the test is the best solution to reduce the FNR, and repeats should be integrated
with the group-testing method to increase the sensitivity of the test. The simplest way is to replicate the
test twice for each group (the 2Rgt method). In this paper, we present a new method for group testing
(the groupMix method), which integrates two repeats in the test. Then we introduce the 2-stage sequential
version of both the groupMix and the 2Rgt methods. We compare these methods analytically regarding the
sensitivity and the average number of tests. The tradeoff between the sensitivity and the average number
of tests should be considered when choosing the best method for the screening strategy. We applied the
groupMix method to screening 263 people and identified 2 infected individuals by performing 98 tests. This
method achieved a 63% saving in the number of tests compared to individual testing. Our experimental
results show that in COVID-19 screening, the viral load can be low, and the group size should not be more
than 6; otherwise, the FNR increases significantly. A web interface of the groupMix method is publicly
available for laboratories to implement this method.

I. Introduction
n the post-COVID-19 era, most countries are trying to lift their lockdown restrictions. However, an
infected person can remain completely asymptomatic and spread the virus. Hence, it is essential to
increase screening tests to identify and quarantine the infected person and identify any other person
who has been exposed to that individual. Unfortunately, the testing capacity of many countries is
not sufficient, and they have to save their capacity for the second or even the third wave of the
coronavirus outbreak.
In this situation, the group testing (or pool testing) technique can immediately and dramatically
increase worldwide testing capacity by decreasing the required number of individual tests in a population. In this technique, separate samples are mixed together to create a sample pool. After a
single diagnostic test has been performed on each group of samples, a negative result indicates that
everyone in the group is uninfected; otherwise, at least one of the samples in the group is infected.
Then, in conventional group testing [1], [2], an individual test on each sample in the infected group
is performed to identify the infected samples. With this method, the number of tests is decreased by
not testing the individual samples in an uninfected group.
Although different types of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are
the predominant diagnostic methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2, the accuracy of these methods for

COVID-19 is still unknown [3]. False positives are rare for RT-PCR testing when primers and probes
are designed appropriately. There are many reports of specificity of 100% for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR
assays, based on the in vitro cross-reactivity assessment [4], [5], [6]. However, the clinical specificity,
which is affected by the contamination of laboratory equipment and reagents or human error, could
be less than 100%. Overall, the false positive rate (FPR) of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR diagnosis, without
human error and contamination, can be considered to be zero.
The major problem in COVID-19 diagnosis with RT-PCR is false negatives. A false-negative rate
(FNR) of up to 50% has been reported for RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing [4], but an
FNR of 10-20% is more frequent in the reports [6], [7]. An unsuitable type of sample (e.g., a throat
swab rather than a nasal swab [8]) and inadequate or inappropriate specimen collection, storage, and
transport are responsible for a large portion of this high FNR. Moreover, the FNR of SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR diagnosis is affected by the number of days that have elapsed since an individual first
became infected. Indeed, the FNR is about 67% and 38% on day 4 and on the day of symptom onset
(day 5), respectively. Three days after symptom onset (day 8), the FNR decreases to 20%, and then,
it gradually increases again to 66% on day 21 [9].
A false-negative result puts the whole society at risk by falsely indicating that an infected person
does not have an infection. Hence, this person, might move around the community and infect others.
False negatives in group testing are much riskier than in individual testing. If a group of specimens
is infected, each sample in the group can potentially be infected. Consequently, if the test result of
this infected pool is a false negative, this result indicates that every person with a specimen in the
pool is infection-free. Also, the mixing of specimens in group testing makes an infected specimen
become diluted by the uninfected samples. Therefore, if the group size is not determined wisely, the
infected specimen becomes undetectable, and the sensitivity of the test is reduced, resulting in false
negatives (the dilution effect). Hence, the group testing methods must be made resistant to falsenegative results. Unfortunately, the main focus of most of the studies in the field of group testing is
only on reducing the average number of tests. Hence, more studies are needed to mitigate the effect
of false negatives and increase the sensitivity of the test in group testing. This paper aims to address
this need.
In this work, we propose a new method of group testing, called the groupMix method, for mitigating
the false negatives. We propose 1-stage and 2-stage sequential versions of this method. In [10], the
authors propose a method for false-negative mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 group testing. We propose
a 2-stage version of this method and compare the sensitivity and the average number of tests of
1-stage and 2-stage versions of this method with those of the groupMix method. Then we present
our experimental test results for COVID-19 screening by using the groupMix method. Finally, we
introduce our web interface, which will help laboratories to implement the groupMix method.
II. Group Testing Methods
In the case of individual testing, the best practice to mitigate the effect of false negatives is to repeat
the test [11]. If the false-positive results are ignored, a person can be diagnosed as positive if either
test is positive. Assume that there is no human error and contamination resulting in false positive,
and the FNR of the RT-PCR test is 20% and the test errors are independent. In this case, if we
repeat the test for an individual twice independently by getting two samples, the chance of obtaining
two false-negative results drops to 4%. Consequently, the sensitivity of the test increases from 80%
(for a single test) to 96% (for two tests). Inspired by this easy method of false-negative mitigation
for individual testing, this test repetition could be integrated into the group-testing procedure to
mitigate the effect of false negatives in the detection of infected groups. For instance, an adaptive
screening procedure is introduced in [12] so that the negative groups of each stage are re-tested. If
both tests of a group are negative, this group is considered as a negative group. Recently, a group
testing method has been proposed for SARS-CoV-2 in [10] for false-negative mitigation. Here, we

call this method 2-replicate group testing, denoted by 2Rgt. We introduce this method in the next
section, and then, we propose a 2-stage sequential version of it to reduce its required number of tests.
We will compare the results of our proposed method, groupMix, with 2Rgt’s results.
A. Model and Notation
Assume that the prevalence (prior probability) of the disease in the population is p. We want to
test N independent specimens by using group testing. The group size, i.e., the number of specimens
in each pool, is n. The optimum group size, nopt , minimizes the average number of tests, T . The FNR
of the diagnostic method for a single test is denoted by fN , and the FPR is negligible. It is assumed
that testing the pooled sample does not change fN . In other words, the group size n is determined
wisely to prevent the dilution effect and a drop in the sensitivity.
Denoting a group of samples by G, G = 0 means that all samples in G are uninfected. In contrast,
G = 1 implies that G is a positive group; i.e., it has at least one infected specimen. By observing the
results of group tests in different methods, we identify a group as infected or uninfected, denoted by
Ĝ = 1 and Ĝ = 0, respectively. Here, we define two types of sensitivity. The sample-level sensitivity,
Ss , refers to the probability of detecting an infected sample as positive. On the other hand, the
group-level sensitivity, Sg , refers to the probability of positive detection of an infected group; i.e.,
P (Ĝ = 1 | G = 1). To be able to detect an infected sample, its corresponding pool should be diagnosed
positive first, and then, its individual test should also be positive. Therefore, Ss = Sg (1 − fN ). In
comparing different methods of group testing, we compare Sg values to measure the accuracy of the
methods.
B. groupMix Method
The schematic diagram of the groupMix method is depicted in Fig. 1. This method has the following
steps.
1) Pooling: We make groups of samples with the group size of n. Therefore, we have m = dN/ne
groups. We label each group as Gi where 1 6 i 6 m, and we call them primary groups.
2) Group mixing: Each primary group Gi (2 6 i 6 m − 1) is mixed with Gi−1 and Gi+1 separately,
giving the mixed groups Mi−1,i and Mi,i+1 , respectively, a group size of 2n. In the case of the first
(G1 ) and last (Gm ) groups, we mix them together and make Mm,1 . With this form of mixing, each
group exists in two mixed groups. Hence, each group will be tested twice by testing the mixed groups.
3) Group Testing: Each mixed group will be tested to identify the infected mixed groups. This form
of group mixing results in m mixed groups, which equals the number of the primary groups Gi .
Therefore, in this step, we need m tests.
4) Infected group detection: In this step, we detect the infected primary groups from the test
results of the mixed groups. Different approaches can be applied for this purpose, based on the level
of compromising the false negatives and the tradeoff between sensitivity and the number of tests.
Assume that we want to detect the infected group in Fig. 1. Here, M2,3 and M3,4 are positive. We
can have the following detection approaches.
• Conservative group detection: In a conservative approach, M2,3 = 1 indicates that both Ĝ2 and Ĝ3
should be considered as infected because both can cause a positive result for M2,3 . However, Ĝ2 = 1
should also make the test result for M1,2 positive. Here, we assume pessimistically that the observed
value of M1,2 = 0 is a false-negative result. Similarly, M3,4 = 1 results in Ĝ3 = 1 and Ĝ4 = 1. Hence,
with this approach, the primary groups Ĝ2 , Ĝ3 , and Ĝ4 should be detected as positive in Fig. 1. Here,
Ĝ2 = 1 and Ĝ4 = 1 are false positives due to our detection algorithm. Consequently, this method
makes algorithmic false positives, increasing the number of tests. However, this approach results in
Sg = 1 − fN2 . In summary, in conservative group detection, we consider Ĝi = 1 and Ĝi+1 = 1 provided
that Mi,i+1 = 1.
• Non-conservative group detection: To reduce the number of algorithmic false positives, and

consequently, to decrease the number of tests in conservative group detection, we should be tolerant
of false negatives. To achieve this goal, we can detect only more probable infected groups, with the
cost of less sensitivity. In this way, both M2,3 and M3,4 in Fig. 1 are positive, most likely because
G3 = 1. Although these positive results can also occur if G2 = 1 and G4 = 1, the lack of M1,2 = 1
and M4,1 = 1 makes it unlikely that G2 and G4 will both equal 1. In this approach, if, for example,
G2 is truly positive and M1,2 = 0 is a false-negative result, we will miss Ĝ2 = 1, resulting in less
sensitivity. We will propose a 2-stage sequential version of this method to resolve this problem and
increase the sensitivity.
If there is not any false-negative result, we should always see a pair of positive mixed groups for an
infected group Gi , i.e., Mi−1,i and Mi,i+1 . Therefore, provided that we observe only a single positive
mixed group, i.e., Mi−1,i = 0, Mi,i+1 = 1, and Mi+1,i+2 = 0, then the other mixed group of the pair
is not diagnosed positive because of the false-negative result. Hence, a single positive mixed group

Mi,i+1 indicates that both Gi and Gi+1 can potentially be infected. Consequently, we consider both
groups positive to test all of their specimens individually in the next step.
In summary, we have the following rules in non-conservative group detection.
1) Provided that the test result of both Mi−1,i and Mi,i+1 are positive, Ĝi is considered as a positive
group; otherwise, it is negative.
2) If we have a single positive mixed group, e.g., Mi,i+1 , both Ĝi and Ĝi+1 are considered as infected.
5) Individual testing: The specimens of all primary groups that are detected positive (Ĝi = 1) are
tested individually.
In Fig. 1, there are N = 12 samples with one infected sample. The pooling of samples is performed
with a group size of n = 3. Hence, there are m = 4 primary groups in which G3 is infected. Fig.
1 depicts the non-conservative group detection. We need 4 tests in the group-testing step and 3
individual tests in the last step, or a total of 7 tests. Using the conservative group detection, we need
4 tests in the group-testing step and 9 more individual tests, or a total of 13 tests. We can see the
effect of the algorithmic false positives in increasing the number of tests.
C. Sequential groupMix Method
We propose a 2-stage sequential version of the non-conservative groupMix method, denoted by
2S-groupMix, to increase its sensitivity. As explained in Sec. II-B, some cases are undetected by the
non-conservative group detection. For instance, assume that G1 = 0, G2 = 1, G3 = 0, and G4 = 1.
In this case, if we observe M1,2 = 0 (a false negative), M2,3 = 1, M3,4 = 1, and M4,1 = 1, the
non-conservative method detects Ĝ3 = 1 and Ĝ4 = 1. Here, Ĝ2 = 1 is not detected because of the
false-negative result. Since Ĝ3 = 1 is an algorithmic false positive, the individual test of its specimens
will not show any infected sample. This observation indicates that M2,3 = 1 could be due to G2 = 1,
and implicitly shows that M1,2 = 0 is a false negative. Therefore, in the second stage, Ĝ2 is considered
infected, and its specimens are tested individually. In this way, the sensitivity of the non-conservative
groupMix method is increased by performing the second stage. In summary, the 2S-groupMix method
is as follows.
1) Perform the groupMix method by using the non-conservative group detection.
2) Assume that the test of a mixed group is positive in the previous stage (e.g., Mi,i+1 = 1), and
that only one of its primary groups is detected as a positive group (for example, Ĝi = 0 and
Ĝi+1 = 1). Provided that the individual tests on the samples of the detected group (i.e., Gi+1 )
are all negative, perform the individual test on the specimens of the other undetected primary
group (i.e., Gi ).
Since this approach is a sequential method, we need to spend more time to increase the sensitivity
of the test. In other words, there is a tradeoff between the test time and the sensitivity.
D. 2-replicate group test
In 2-replicate group test (2Rgt) method, each group is tested twice. Provided that the result of at
least one of the tests is positive, this group is diagnosed as a positive group. In this case, Sg = 1 − fN2 .
Note that the 2Rgt method has no algorithmic false positive.
In the case of Fig. 1, we need 11 tests if we use the 2Rgt method, while 7 and 13 tests are required
if we use the non-conservative and the conservative groupMix method, respectively.
E. Sequential 2-replicate group test
Here, we present a 2-stage sequential version of the 2Rgt method, denoted by 2S-2Rgt, to reduce
the number of tests, while the sensitivity of the test, i.e., Sg = 1−fN2 , remains the same. The drawback
of the 2Rgt method is that it uses two tests for each group and increases the required number of tests.

Fig. 2. The average number of tests per sample (left y-axis, blue curves) and group-level sensitivity Sg (right y-axis, red curves)
of different methods against the group size.

Since observing only one positive result out of two tests is enough to consider a group as infected,
we can separate these two tests on each group and avoid the second test for positive groups of the
first stage. The summary of this method is as follows.
1) Test all groups once and identify the positive groups as infected.
2) Perform the second test only on the negative groups of the first stage and identify the positive
groups.
3) Individually test the specimens of the positive groups of stages 1 and 2.
In this way, we reduce the number of tests by saving the second test of the infected groups identified
in the first stage.
III. Analytical Results
In this section, we present the results of the analytical analysis of the different group-testing
methods regarding Sg , and the average number of tests per sample, T /N . The proof for the analyses
is available in Appendix A. All analytical results are verified by simulation. In the following results,
it is assumed that the FNR of the diagnostic test is 10%.
A. The effect of group size on T and Sg
First, we consider the effect of the group size on T /N and Sg in Fig. 2 for FNR = 10% and
p = 2%. This figure has two different y-axes. The right axis shows Sg for the non-conservative (NC),
conservative (C), and 2-stage sequential (2S) groupMix methods, the 2Rgt and 2S-2Rgt methods,
and the conventional method. The left axis shows T /N for the NC-groupMix and the 2S-groupMix

methods. This figure indicates that for these specific values of FNR and prevalence, nopt , which
minimizes the average number of tests, is 7.
Moreover, Fig. 2 shows that Sg of both the C-groupMix and 2Rgt methods is independent of n,
equal to Sg = 1 − fN2 , which is 0.99 for fN = 0.1. Similarly, the conventional group-test method has
the fixed group-level sensitivity Sg = 1 − fN over n. However, Sg in NC- and 2S-groupMix methods
varies with n. In other words, with smaller value of n, a larger value of Sg is achieved. In this figure,
it is obvious that there is a tradeoff between Sg and T /N for n 6 7.
If the primary concern in group testing is only to reduce the average number of tests T , then
the group size should minimize T . However, in practice, using the optimum value of n may not be
possible in the presence of problems like the dilution effect. For example, the study in [13] shows
that for detecting SARS-CoV-2 with the standard kits and protocols, a single infected sample can be
detected in pools of up to 32 samples, with an estimated FNR of 10%. This finding could be valid for
the specimen of an active symptomatic patient. However, in COVID-19 screening, we usually deal
with asymptomatically-infected or pre-symptomatic individuals or people with very mild or atypical
symptoms. These cases may not have a high viral load and detectable amounts of the virus in their
specimen.
Consequently, in the screening scenario, the maximum group size could be much less than 32. Our
experiments show that a group size of 6 is a good choice for group testing in COVID-19 screening;
otherwise, the viral load in the pool becomes very low, and the FNR increases dramatically. A
thorough investigation is required to determine the maximum group size for COVID-19 screening
rather than for diagnostic testing for detecting active symptomatic patients.
B. Optimum group size
Figure 3(A) depicts nopt against the prevalence percentage p for FNR = 10%. In the case of the
groupMix methods, nopt refers to the optimum group size of the primary group, i.e., Gi . Hence, the
optimum size of the mixed group tested by the diagnostic method is 2nopt . Theoretically, the smaller
values of p allow us to have larger groups of specimens. However, as we discussed above, the use of
larger groups can reduce the sensitivity of the test.
C. Group-level sensitivity
Figure 3(B) shows Sg versus p for FNR= 10%. Overall, Sg of the C-groupMix, 2Rgt, and 2S-2Rgt
methods does not vary with p and has the fixed value of Sg = 1 − fN2 . Similarly, the conventional
group-test method has the p-independent sensitivity of Sg = 1 − fN . However, when we utilize the
non-conservative infected group detection in the groupMix method, i.e., the NC- and 2S-groupMix
methods, Sg is a decreasing function of p. In non-conservative group detection, the sensitivity is
compromised by accepting more false negatives to reduce the number of algorithmic false positives.
The undetected cases in the non-conservative method occur more in higher values of p, resulting in
less sensitivity. Even after a specific value of p, e.g., p > 0.13 for the NC-groupMix method and the
FNR of 10%, Sg becomes less than that of the conventional method. Therefore, the usage of the NCgroupMix method is acceptable for small values of p, say, less than 5%. Moreover, Fig. 3(B) depicts
that the 2S-groupMix method improves Sg significantly compared to the NC-groupMix method.
As we saw in Fig. 2, Sg of the C-groupMix, the 2Rgt, and the conventional methods does not vary
with n. On the contrary, Sg of the NC-groupMix and the 2S-groupMix methods depends on n. For
these two methods, we see Sg in Fig. 3(B) for two cases of n = 3 (i.e., a mixed group size of 6) and
n = nopt . For FNR = 10%, nopt equals 3 for p greater than about 10%, resulting in the same Sg for two
different cases of group size. For smaller values of prevalence, nopt >3. Since Sg of the NC-groupMix
and the 2S-groupMix methods is a decreasing function of n (Fig. 2), the group testing with n = nopt
is less sensitive than n = 3 for p < 10%.

Fig. 3. Comparing different methods against the percentage of prevalence: (A) the optimum group size nopt to minimize the
average number of tests; (B) the group-level sensitivity Sg of the methods; (C) the average number of tests per sample for
n = nopt ; (D) the average number of tests per sample for the group (or the mixed group in the groupMix method) size of 6.

D. Average number of tests
Figure 3(C) depicts the average number of tests per sample, T /N , against the prevalence percentage
p for n = nopt . As discussed earlier, in a COVID-19 screening scenario, the group size should not
be more than 6 to prevent the dilution effect. Hence, Fig. 3(D) shows T /N of different methods
versus p for ngroupMix = 3 (the size of the mixed group is 6), n2Rgt = 6, and nconventional = 6. As these
figures show, all methods proposed for false-negative mitigation require more tests compared to the
conventional method.
Among the 1-stage methods, the NC-groupMix method needs the least average number of tests.
However, as mentioned before, its sensitivity reduces with p, and after a specific value of p, its
sensitivity becomes even worse than that of the conventional group test method. Therefore, it is
reasonable to use the NC-groupMix method for small values of p, say p < 5%, to have both high
sensitivity and less number of tests. In a comparison between the 1-stage C-groupMix and the 1-stage
2Rgt methods, which both have the same sensitivity of Sg = 1 − fN2 , the C-groupMix method needs
more tests due to algorithmic false positives. Therefore, if the goal is to reach Sg = 1 − fN2 by using

a 1-stage method, the 2Rgt method is preferred.
In the case of the 2-stage sequential methods, the average number of tests in the 2S-2Rgt method
is less than that of the 2Rgt method. This reduction in the number of tests occurs because, in the 2S2Rgt method, we perform the second test only for the negative groups in the first stage, rather than
using two tests for each group in 2Rgt. In contrast, in groupMix methods using the non-conservative
infected group detection, the 2S-groupMix needs more tests compared to the 1-stage NC-groupMix
method. This increase in the number of tests occurs because the sequential version performs the full
NC-groupMix test in the first stage, followed by the second stage.
In a comparison between the 2S-groupMix and the 2S-2Rgt methods, the former needs fewer tests
than the latter. However, the sensitivity of the 2S-groupMix method is less than that of the 2S-2Rgt,
and reduces with an increase of p. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between Sg and T in decisions about
choosing a 2-stage sequential group-test method for false-negative mitigation.
Considering the maximum group size (or the size of the mixed group in the groupMix method) of
6, compared to individual testing at 1% prevalence, we save 60% at the FNR of 10% for all proposed
methods to mitigate the false negatives. For the optimum group size, this saving is between 70% to
80% at 1% prevalence, but it may result in less sensitive tests.
Overall, in choosing the best group-testing method to mitigate the false-negative results, we should
determine the desired level of sensitivity and the amount of saving in the number of the tests.
Moreover, the expected time of the test determines whether the sequential method should be used.
IV. Experimental Methods
We performed COVID-19 screening in the Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM),
Tehran, Iran. A total of 263 individuals participated in the screening on five different days. These
groups consisted of 78, 30, 31, 66, and 58 individuals, respectively. Swabs from the throat were
collected and sent to the Clinical Genetic Laboratory at the Royan Institute, Tehran, Iran. Samples
were collected between June 15-30, 2020.
The samples were pooled into the primary groups with a size of 3 prior to RNA extraction. Then,
the primary groups were mixed according to the groupMix method’s procedure, resulting in mixed
groups of size 6.
A volume of 200 µL of the sample was mixed with 600 µL Lysis buffer, and RNA was extracted
by using the Norgen Cell-Free RNA Purification Kit (Cat. No: 56300). 50 µL of Elution buffer was
used in the extraction procedure.
The Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time Multiplex kit (Liferiver, Cat. No: ZJ0009) was
utilized for real-time RT-PCR diagnosis. This kit detects the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by
detecting the three genes N, OFR1ab, and E. Reactions were heated to 45°C for 10 minutes (1
cycle) for reverse transcription and denatured in 95°C for 90 seconds (1 cycle). Then, 45 cycles
of amplification were carried out in 95°C for 15 seconds and 58°C for 30 seconds. Fluorescence was
measured at 58°C. The 1-stage NC-groupMix method was performed to detect the infected specimens.
This study was approved by the ethical committee of the Royan institute with a waiver of informed
consent due to de-identified nature of the data.
V. Experimental Results
On the second, fourth, and fifth days, all groups with 30, 66, and 58 individuals were negative. For
these days, we performed 10, 22, and 20 tests, respectively. Therefore, we saved 67%, 67%, and 66%
in the number of tests, compared to individual testing.
In the first group, consisting of 78 individuals, we had 26 primary and mixed groups. With the
NC-groupMix method, only the mixed group M20,21 was positive. Since we should always have a pair
of positive mixed groups, this result indicates that one mixed group is a false negative. Therefore,
both primary groups G20 and G21 were candidates to be infected. Ultimately, by performing the

individual test on these primary groups, one specimen in G20 was identified as infected. Consequently,
we performed 32 tests to detect one infected sample out of 78 samples. Indeed, we had a 59% saving
in the number of tests, compared to individual testing.
Regarding the third group consisting of 31 individuals, the mixed groups M4,5 and M5,6 were
positive. Hence, G5 was detected as the infected group. The individual test on G5 revealed the
presence of one infected sample in this group. Hence, we detected this infected sample by using 14
tests (i.e., a 55% saving).
In conclusion, 2 positive samples were successfully identified out of 263 by using 98 tests, i.e., a
63% saving in the number of tests compared to individual testing. Since the average prevalence in
this population was about 0.8%, the average group-level sensitivity Sg of this screening was very close
to 1 − fN2 .
VI. Discussion and Conclusion
In this paper, we investigated false-negative mitigation in group testing, focusing on massive
testing for COVID-19 screening. Group testing is receiving attention as a strategy that can save
time or resources for COVID-19 testing. Indeed, group testing is reasonable for screening since the
percentage of infected people is very low, resulting in substantial savings. However, the high rate
of false-negative results in RT-PCR-based COVID-19 diagnostic tests has been widely addressed
recently as an important public health-related problem. This problem needs more attention in group
testing because a false-negative result for a group of potentially infected individuals does not lead to
isolating them, and they can quickly spread the virus in their community.
To mitigate the false-negative results and to increase the sensitivity of the group testing, we studied
different strategies for repeating the test. By implementing r replicates in the test design, we can
achieve the maximum group-level sensitivity of Sg = 1 − fNr , but there is a tradeoff between the
sensitivity and the average number of tests; hence, we can reduce the average number of tests by
compromising the false negatives. However, this compromising is negligible for the very low percentage
of infected samples that usually occurs in screening.
Typically, in group-testing studies, researchers propose different methods for pooling and identifying
the infected groups. Then, they find the optimum group size to minimize the average number of tests.
However, we explained that in COVID-19 screening, the high viral load might not be available because
we are dealing with asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, or mild-symptomatic people. This fact is crucial
in group testing because the dilution effect in the pooling of specimens can cause more false-negative
cases. Therefore, the theoretical optimum group size of different methods may yield a severe dilution
effect and high FNR in the screening scenario. Our experimental studies showed that the maximum
group size in COVID-19 screening should be 6. However, systematic studies are still required to
determine the maximum group size for COVID-19 screening. Moreover, by filtering out symptomatic
individuals and testing them individually, we can increase the performance and sensitivity of the test.
For further studies, we can pool specimens based on the age and medical background of individuals
and investigate the effect of these factors on the performance of the group-testing method.

Appendix A
Analysis
In our analysis, we present Sg , and the average number of tests per sample, i.e., T /N , for each
method. Then, we explain how to obtain nopt . First, we introduce some notations and basic equations
to prove our analysis accordingly.
∆
• #(x) = the number of the occurrence of event x
∆
• E[X] = the expected value of a random variable X
∆
• m = #(groups) = N/n (m may not equal an integer, however, we do not round it up in our
analysis, so that we can calculate the derivatives and simplify the equations. We will round up
the all integer size values at the end of our analysis).
• TPg : the detected positive group is a true positive
• FPg : the detected positive group is a false positive
• The probability of having a positive group is

B. Analysis of the 2Rgt method
Assume that Ĝ(1) and Ĝ(2) are the results of the first and the second test of G. Ĝ(1) and Ĝ(2) are
dependent because they both depend on whether G is infected or not. However, they are conditionally
independent given G; i.e.,
P (Ĝ(1) , Ĝ(2) | G) = P (Ĝ(1) | G)P (Ĝ(2) | G).
1) Sg :
Sg2Rgt = P (Ĝ = 1 | G = 1)
= 1 − P (Ĝ = 0 | G = 1)
= 1 − P (Ĝ(1) = 0, Ĝ(2) = 0 | G = 1)
= 1 − P (Ĝ(1) = 0 | G = 1)P (Ĝ(2) = 0 | G = 1)
= 1 − fN2 .
2) T /N : According to Eq. (1) we have
T 2Rgt

= + Pg Sg2Rgt

= + (1 − fN2 )Pg .

C. Analysis of the 2S-2Rgt method
1) Sg : Assume that Ĝ(1) and Ĝ(2) are the test results of G in the first and the second stage of the
sequential 2Rgt (2S-2Rgt) method.
Sg2S-2Rgt = P (Ĝ = 1 | G = 1)
= P (Ĝ(1) = 1 | G = 1) + P (Ĝ(1) = 0, Ĝ(2) = 1 | G = 1)
= P (Ĝ(1) = 1 | G = 1) + P (Ĝ(1) = 0 | G = 1)P (Ĝ(2) = 1 | G = 1)
= (1 − fN ) + fN (1 − fN )
= 1 − fN2 .
Sg of the 2S-2Rgt is the same as that of the 2Rgt method.
2) T /N :
T 2S-2Rgt = #(groups) + #(groups diagnosed negative in 1st stage) + E[#(individual tests)]
= m + m[1 − Pg (1 − fN )] + (n+
g × n)
⇒

T 2S-2Rgt
1
= [2 − Pg (1 − fN )] + (1 − fN2 )Pg .
N
n

The term 2 − Pg (1 − fN ) on the right-hand side is less than 2; hence, T /N in the 2S-2Rgt method
is less than that in the non-adptive 2Rgt method. Indeed, we save on average N Pg (1 − fN )/n tests
with the sequential approach.

D. Analysis of the C-groupMix method
In the groupMix method, M̂i−1,i and M̂i,i+1 are conditionally independent given Gi , i.e.,
P (M̂i−1,i , M̂i,i+1 | Gi ) = P (M̂i−1,i | Gi )P (M̂i,i+1 | Gi ).
Moreover, we use the following conditional probabilities in the proof of our analyses for the groupMix
method.
1) P (M̂i−1,i = 1 | Gi = 1) = 1 − fN
2) P (M̂i−1,i = 0 | Gi = 1) = fN
3) P (M̂i−1,i = 1 | Gi = 0) = P (Gi−1 = 1)P (M̂i−1,i = 1 | Gi−1 = 1, Gi = 0) = Pg (1 − fN )
4) P (M̂i−1,i = 0 | Gi = 0) = 1 − Pg (1 − fN )
The same equations are valid for M̂i,i+1 .
1) Sg :
SgC-groupMix = P (Ĝi = 1 | Gi = 1)
= 1 − P (Ĝi = 0 | Gi = 1)
= 1 − P (M̂i−1,i = 0, M̂i,i+1 = 0 | Gi = 1)
= 1 − P (M̂i−1,i = 0 | Gi = 1)P (M̂i,i+1 = 0 | Gi = 1)
= 1 − fN2 .
2) T /N : There is an algorithmic false positive in the groupMix method. Hence, we should first

obtain the FPRC-groupMix

= 1 − [1 − Pg (1 − fN )]2 .

E. Analysis of the NC-groupMix method
1) Sg : In the NC-groupMix method, the primary group Gi is detected positive if the test results
of both Mi−1,i and Mi,i+1 are positive, or if we have a single positive mixed group, i.e., either Mi−1,i
or Mi,i+1 . Therefore, we can calculate Sg as follows:
SgNC-groupMix = P (Ĝi = 1 | Gi = 1)
= P (M̂i−1,i = 1, M̂i,i+1 = 1 | Gi = 1)
+ P (M̂i−2,i−1 = 0, M̂i−1,i = 1, M̂i,i+1 = 0 | Gi = 1)
+ P (M̂i−1,i = 0, M̂i,i+1 = 1, M̂i+1,i+2 = 0, | Gi = 1).

15

The second and the third probabilities in the above equation are equal. Hence, we have
SgNC-groupMix = P (M̂i−1,i = 1 | Gi = 1)P (M̂i,i+1 = 1 | Gi = 1)
+ 2P (Gi−1 = 0)P (M̂i−2,i−1 = 0, M̂i−1,i = 1, M̂i,i+1 = 0 | Gi−1 = 0, Gi = 1)
+ 2P (Gi−1 = 1)P (M̂i−2,i−1 = 0, M̂i−1,i = 1, M̂i,i+1 = 0 | Gi−1 = 1, Gi = 1).
By applying the multiplying property of the conditional independence and using the equations
explained at the beginning of Section A-D, we obtain
SgNC-groupMix = (1 − fN2 ) + 2(Pg2 − 2Pg )fN (1 − fN )2 .
, the equations are like the equations for calculating Sg ,
2) T /N : For calculating FPRNC-groupMix

except that the condition is Gi = 0. Ultimately, we obtain

F. Analysis of the 2S-groupMix method
In the 2S-groupMix method, we first perform the NC-groupMix method, and then, the second
stage of the test is done based on the results of the first stage. Therefore, the Sg and T /N values
of the 2S-groupMix method are calculated by using the sum of those values in the NC-groupMix
method with the added values obtained by performing the second stage. In the following analyses,
the superscript indexes (1) and (2) denote the first and the second stage of the 2S-groupMix method,
respectively.

where TP(1)

Because of the symmetry, the probabilities (I) and (III), and (II) and (IV) are equal. Therefore, we
(2)
calculate only the probabilities (I) and (II) separately and then obtain the value of Sg .
(I) :

P (M̂i−2,i−1 = 1, M̂i−1,i = 1, M̂i,i+1 = 0, Gi−1 = 0 | Gi = 1)
= P (Gi−1 = 0)P (M̂i−2,i−1 = 1, M̂i−1,i = 1, M̂i,i+1 = 0 | Gi−1 = 0, Gi = 1)
= (1 − Pg )P (M̂i−2,i−1 = 1 | Gi−1 = 0)P (M̂i−1,i = 1 | Gi−1 = 0, Gi = 1)P (M̂i,i+1 = 0 | Gi = 1)
= Pg (1 − Pg )fN (1 − fN )2 .

Similarly, we have
(II) : P (M̂i−2,i−1 = 1, M̂i−1,i = 1, M̂i,i+1 = 0, Gi−1 = 1, Ĝi−1 = 0 | Gi = 1)
= P (Gi−1 = 1, Ĝi−1 = 0)P (M̂i−2,i−1 = 1, M̂i−1,i = 1, M̂i,i+1 = 0 | Gi−1 = 1, Gi = 1)
= fN (1 − fN )2 × P (Gi−1 = 1, Ĝi−1 = 0).
In the above equation, Gi−1 = 1 and Ĝi−1 = 0 means that the primary group Gi−1 has at least one
infected sample, but the individual test results of the infected
samples in the first stage are all false
P
negative. Therefore, P (Gi−1 = 1, Ĝi−1 = 0) denoted by (n, p, fN ) is as follows:

G. Finding the optimum group size
To find the optimum group size nopt , we should find the minimum value of T against n. Hence, we
need to find the solution of dT /dn = 0. This solution is the same as the solution of d(T /N )/dn = 0.
By using Eq. (1) for 1-stage group-testing methods, we have

nopt can be founf by solving the above equation.

PIn the case of the 2S-groupMix method, Pg is not only a function of Pg , and the derivative of
(n, p, fN ) does not have a closed-form solution. Therefore, for this method, we find nopt by using
numerical computation. For the 2S-2Rgt method, the calculation of d(T /N )/dn is straightforward
when the above formula for dPg /dn is used. Ultimately, the value of nopt obtained by solving the
equation d(T /N )/dn = 0 should be rounded to the closest integer number.
Appendix B
groupMix Web Interface
In this appendix, we explain different parts of the groupMix web interface. In this web, the 1-stage
NC-groupMix method is implemented. The following sections in this web interface can be navigated
using the left side of the website.
A. Create Groups
In the ”Create Groups” section (Fig. B.1), we should set three input values of the number of
specimens, prevalence (%), and FNR (%). Then, the optimum size of the primary groups, i.e.,nopt ,
the number of groups, and the average number of tests is calculated according to the provided input
values. Under these values, the mixed groups and their corresponding specimen numbers are depicted.
The group size can be changed to a different value.
For instance, in Fig. B.2, the input values, and the group size are set according to the case of group
testing depicted in Fig. 1, where we have 12 samples and four mixed groups. After performing the
tests on mixed groups, we can set the test results by clicking on the green icons in the ”Test Results”
column. The green icon indicates that the mixed group is uninfected, and it turns into a red color,
indicating infected, by clicking on the green icon. After determining the infected mixed groups, the
index of specimens that should be tested by individual testing, i.e., the samples of infected primary
groups detected by the non-conservative group detection method, are listed at the bottom of the
page. Finally, this test setup can be saved by clicking on the ”Save Test Line” button.

B. Test Lines
In this section, we can see the list of saved test lines (Fig. B.3). Moreover, we can edit or delete
each test line, and download the list of available test lines as an Excel spreadsheet.
