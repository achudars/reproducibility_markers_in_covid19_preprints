Abstract
Several recent studies identified SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in people without exposure to the
virus. However, pathophysiological implications of these findings remain unknown. Here, the
potential impact of pre-existing T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected individuals on
markedly different COVID-19 mortality levels in different countries has been investigated. The
inverse correlation is documented between the prevalence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive
T cells in people without exposure to the virus and COVID-19 mortality rates in different
countries. In countries with similar levels of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells in
uninfected individuals, differences in COVID-19 mortality appear linked with the extend and
consistency of implementations of social measures designed to limit the transmission of SARSCoV-2 (lockdown; physical distancing; mask wearing). Collectively, these observations support
the model that the level of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells is one of the important
determinants of the innate herd immunity against COVID-19. Together with the consistent social
measures directed to limit the virus spread, high levels of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T
cells appear significant determinants diminishing the COVID-19 mortality. Observations reported
in this contribution should have significant impact on definitions of the herd immunity threshold
required to effectively stop the pandemic in different countries across the globe.

Several recent studies identified SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals or
people without exposure to the virus in various countries across the globe (1-5). It has been
pointed out that the common major limitation of these studies was the relatively small numbers
of donors contributing blood samples for the analyses (6). However, the most recent study (7)
confirmed and extended these findings based on the analyses of 185 uninfected individuals,
thus addressing to a significant degree this limitation. In unexposed to the SARS-CoV-2
individuals, the cross-reactive T cells were detected against 9 of 29 (31%) of the validated HLA
class I and to 14 of 20 (70%) HLA-DR T cell peptide epitopes (7). Recognition frequencies
against individual T cell epitopes in unexposed individuals were highly variable reaching up to
27% and 44% for the best-performing HLA class I and HLA-DR peptide epitopes, respectively
(7). Therefore, studies utilizing validated individual peptide epitopes as well as predicted or
random SARS-CoV-2-derived peptide pools, consistently demonstrated pre-existing SARSCoV2-directed T cell responses in unexposed as well as seronegative for SARS-CoV-2
individuals (1-7). The likely source of this phenomena is the immune cross-reactivity between
human common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 (1-8).
Interestingly, the level of T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed individuals
varied in different countries, ranging from 18% in Sweden (5) to 51% in Singapore (4). These
findings prompted the analysis of the possible association between levels of T cell reactivity
against SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed individuals and COVID-19 mortality rates in different
countries. To this end, the currently available primary data on levels of T cell reactivity against
SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected individuals and numbers of COVID-19 cases and death in five
countries (United States; Netherlands; Germany; Singapore; Sweden) were obtained from
original publications (1-5), analyzed (Methods), and plotted for visualization.
Notably, the significant inverse correlation (r = - 0.991) has been observed between the
levels of pre-existing T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 and mortality rates in different
countries (Figure 1). The most extreme cases were represented by Singapore, where 51% of

population manifested pre-existing T cell reactivity associated with the COVID-19 mortality rate
of 0.05%, compared with Sweden, where 18% of population manifested pre-existing T cell
reactivity associated with the COVID-19 mortality rate of 6.35% (Figure 1).

uninfected individuals and COVID-19 mortality rates in different countries. COVID-19 mortality
rates are reported as the case fatality rates (CFR) independently defined for each country (see
Methods).

Interestingly, in two separate instances two countries manifesting similar levels of preexisting T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected individuals reported markedly
different COVID-19 mortality calculated as the numbers of death per million population (Figure
2). Germany and United States manifested similar levels of pre-existing T cell reactivity against
SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected individuals: 34% and 36%, respectively. However, the reported
COVID-19 mortality was 114 death per million in Germany and 627 death per million in United
States. Similarly, Netherlands and Sweden manifested similar levels of pre-existing T cell

reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected individuals: 20% and 18%, respectively. However,
the reported COVID-19 mortality was 374 death per million in Netherlands and 576 death per
million in Sweden.

Significantly, in both instances countries with lover COVID-19 mortality are known to adhere to
more strict and consistent modes of implementations of social measures designed to limit the
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (lockdown; physical distancing; mask wearing) compared to their
counterparts.
In contrast, no apparent association has been observed between the pre-existing T cell
immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and numbers of COVID-19 cases in different countries (Figure
3). In both metrics reflecting either the mortality (Figure 2) or prevalence (Figure 3) of the
COVID-19 pandemic, numbers reported for the United States appear notable outliers likely

because systematic failures to articulate and consistently implement the national pandemic
mitigation strategy designed to efficiently limit the spread of the virus.

against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in uninfected individuals and the prevalence of the COVID-19

Observations reported in this contribution indicate that pre-existing cross-reactive against
SARS-CoV-2 T cells may contribute to the innate herd immunity against COVID-19 and affect
populations’ susceptibility to the infection. Therefore, if pre-existing cross-reactive against
SARS-CoV-2 T cells are significant contributors to populations’ herd immunity, the herd
immunity threshold required to effectively stop the pandemic can be reduced from 60% of a
population getting infected down to as low as 10% based on an R0 of 2.5 (the average number
of secondary cases generated by an infectious individual among susceptible people) and
achieved depending on the prevalence, quantity, and quality of pre-existing immunity among

uninfected people (9-11). Based on these considerations, it seems likely that the upcoming
implementation of even moderately efficient vaccination programs would facilitate the rapid
attainment of the desirable herd immunity levels. If this conclusion is correct, we may be
approaching the crossing of the herd immunity threshold required to stop the COVID-19
pandemic in not very distant future. Collectively, present findings indicate that the heterologous
immunity facilitated by cross-reactive T cells pre-existing in uninfected individuals may be one of
important contributing factors affecting the clinical course of the COVID-19 pandemic (7, 8) and
strongly support the previously articulated rationale (3) for worldwide prospective studies
precisely mapping the levels of pre-existing immune cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 to the
clinical course and outcomes of the pandemic.
Limitations
One of the most significant limitations of this work is the small sample size of all reported to date
studies on the levels of pre-existing T cell immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 in different
countries, which is difficult to justify as representative samples of corresponding populations.
Arguably, the COVID-19 mortality rate metric (also known as the case fatality rate, CFR) could
be influenced by the lack of uniformity of diagnostic tests and the apparent inconsistency of the
data collection and reporting in different countries, which could make uncertain the validity of
observed differences between different countries. Future population-scale studies should help to
address these uncertainties.
Methods
The primary data on levels of T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected individuals are
currently available for the following five countries: United States (1); Netherlands (2); Germany
(3; 7); Singapore (4); Sweden (5). These data were obtained from original publications,
supplemented with numbers of COVID-19 cases and death in corresponding countries
(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), analyzed, and plotted for visualization. Mortality rates
were calculated for each country based on the statistics available on October 01, 2020 and
