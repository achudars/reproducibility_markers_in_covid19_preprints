Title: High-Quality Masks Reduce COVID-19 Infections and Deaths in the US
ABSTRACT
Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of widespread adoption of masks or face coverings
to reduce community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.
Methods: We created an agent-based stochastic network simulation using a variant of the
standard SEIR dynamic infectious disease model. We considered a mask order that was
initiated 3.5 months after the first confirmed COVID-19 case. We varied the likelihood of
individuals wearing masks from 0-100% in steps of 20% (mask adherence) and considered
25% to 90% mask-related reduction in viral transmission (mask efficacy). Sensitivity
analyses assessed early (by week 13) versus late (by week 42) adoption of masks and
geographic differences in adherence (highest in urban and lowest in rural areas).
Results: Introduction of mask use with 50% efficacy worn by 50% of individuals reduces the
cumulative infection attack rate (IAR) by 27%, the peak prevalence by 49%, and populationwide mortality by 29%. If 90% of individuals wear 50% efficacious masks, this decreases
IAR by 54%, peak prevalence by 75%, and population-wide mortality by 55%; similar
improvements hold if 70% of individuals wear 75% efficacious masks. Late adoption reduces
IAR and deaths by 18% or more compared to no adoption. Lower adoption in rural areas
than urban would lead to rural areas having the highest IAR.
Conclusions: Even after community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been established,
adoption of mask-wearing by a majority of community-dwelling individuals can
meaningfully reduce the number and outcome of COVID-19 infections over and above
physical distancing interventions.

Highlights:
•

This paper shows the impact of widespread adoption of masks in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, with varying levels of population adherence, mask efficacy,
and timing of mask adoption.

•

The paper’s findings help inform messaging to policymakers at the state or local level
considering adding or keeping mask mandates, and to communities to promote
widespread adoption of high-quality masks.

•

Adoption of masks by at least half of the population can reduce cumulative infections
and population deaths by more than 25%, while decreasing peak prevalence by about
50%. Even greater marginal improvements arise with adoption rates above 70%. The
benefits of adopting high-quality masks is above that achieved by mobility changes
and distancing alone.

•

Rural and suburban areas are at higher relative risk than urban areas, due to less
distancing and lower adoption of masks.

INTRODUCTION
Since its introduction in early 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has
been widely circulating throughout the United States [1]. While there is growing empirical
evidence that masks can be effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission via droplets [2,
3], the impact of population-based mask use on the COVID-19 pandemic is still poorly
defined. Some states were early mask promoters (e.g., North Carolina or NC in June), some
were late (e.g., North Dakota in November), and some have remained silent (e.g., South
Dakota). This study prospectively assesses the effectiveness of face coverings at the state
level and across urban, suburban, and rural counties under different mask efficacy and
population adherence levels while providing additional evidence for the benefit of existing
adoptions. We focus on masks because they are relatively inexpensive and logistically nondisruptive (compared to, e.g., physical distancing measures). Masks are also a fast
intervention that can be adopted if SARS-Cov-2 mutates or if other viruses arise. We include
analysis of state-wide effects along with those on subpopulations stratified by geography and
demographics.
METHODS
We employ an agent-based stochastic network model with an SEIR framework [4] for the
progression of SARS-CoV-2 [5, 6]. As in Keskinocak et al [6], we simulate interactions
among agents, where transmission can occur daily in households, workplaces and schools,
and community settings, with day/night differentiation in interactions. The model is also
similar to Patel et al [7], where we study vaccine distribution. The network of agents is built
using US Census data [8] at the tract level using household size, presence of children, and age
groups (defined as <= 4,5- 9, 10-19, 20-64, or 65 years old and above). Model parameters
include the reproductive rate (2.4 without interventions), hospitalization and mortality rates
(by age group), an effective overall Infection Fatality Rate just under 0.5%, and
asymptomatic and symptomatic transmission coefficients [5-7]. We also incorporate
race/ethnicity in the model at the household level, as well as the existence of a COVID-19associated health condition (diabetes) stratified by race/ethnicity using available data [9]. Full
details are outlined in Supplementary Materials available online.
Analysis was performed for the representative state of North Carolina (NC), which has had
SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate that puts it in the lower half of US states as quantified by

deaths per capita [1]. The population of 10.5 million people is represented with a sample of
1,017,720 agents. The simulation is seeded (day 1) with cumulative cases as of March 24,
2020 [1], where the initial cases are multiplied by 10 to account for underreporting [10] and
scaled to the number of agents in the simulation; the simulation is run for 365 days. County
cases are distributed to households randomly across each county’s census tracts proportional
to the tract population. We categorize each census tract by urban/suburban/rural status, where
urban corresponds to Rural-Urban-Commuting-Area (RUCA) codes of 1,2 for urban;
6,7,8,9,10 for rural; and the remainder for suburban [11].
The model captures the likelihood an adult agent stays home over time using SafeGraph data
[12] (see supplement for details) aggregated by month and census tract. SafeGraph data
captures the presence of devices in homes or other settings over time and across census
blocks, which we aggregated into tracts grouped by urbanicity (urban, rural, suburban) and
median household income (4 quartiles statewide). An adult will work from home on a given
day according to a probability drawn from their census tract’s rate. For interactions with the
community by age group, we assume the rate follows the same pattern as the workplace
mobility data but with a smaller reduction compared to workplace (e.g., a 40% reduction in
work attendance is associated with a 12% reduction in community interaction), see
Supplemental Appendix). This is consistent with our comparisons of workplace mobility with
other types of mobility [12, 13]. We assume mobility rates stabilize at month six levels. We
do not assume a link between mobility and population infections as we did not see it
consistently across locations when comparing mobility data and infections. The mobility data
captures the fact that many people stayed home shortly after cases began rising (consistent
with shelter-at-home orders given in NC and many other states) and mobility continues to be
lower than pre-pandemic rates. We assume that households with a symptomatic Covid-19
infection will voluntarily quarantine (VQ), in line with the low quarantining rates from [6]
(see Supplemental Appendix). Schools are virtual or closed initially, opening on month six
with students rotating every other day. Anyone who is symptomatic stays home from school
and away from work peer groups.
Unlike Keskinocak et al [6], a proportion of the population wears masks under early and late
scenarios. In the early scenario, the adherence rate increases approximately monthly (days 694, where the last date corresponds to the state mask order in NC), linearly from 0 to the final
adherence probability of (0, 40, 60, 80, or 100%). The “late” scenario, where mask adoption

reaches the highest level when the cumulative infections are approximately equal to 15% in
the baseline cases (specifically, on day 282), corresponds to later mask orders such as the one
issued in North Dakota [14]. In the baseline scenarios, we assume the mask adherence is
homogeneous across the population, as supported by large-scale random sampling of the
population from July 2020 [15]. In sensitivity analysis, we allow mask adherence to vary by
urbanicity, [85%,75%,65%] or [85%,70%,55%] based on the November 2020 surveys
conducted by Facebook [16], with values representing typical ones for states with higher or
lower mask usage (e.g., NC that had early adoption vs ND that had late adoption). Based on
recent experimental analysis [3], in the baseline scenarios we assume that masks reduce the
infectivity to others and susceptibility by 50% each (mask efficacy); if two agents encounter
each other in the simulation, the potential for encounter-based transmission reduction is
multiplicative if both are wearing masks. We compare the baseline mask efficacy with
scenarios where higher quality, more efficacious masks are employed (e.g., 80+% reduction
in transmission and susceptibility risk, as may be achieved by surgical, N95, or even multilayer sewn masks). Note that the population-level effectiveness of masks can be computed as
adherence multiplied by efficacy, e.g., 75% adherence times 50% efficacy equals 37.5%
effectiveness. For our no-intervention control, we assume there are no interventions
throughout the pandemic and mobility is as normal; there is also a scenario with 0% mask
adherence that has changes in mobility. Note that we do not assume a direct relationship
between rising infections and other aspects such as distancing (captured by mobility), mask
usage, or changes in fatality rates.
The model is validated against reported hospitalizations and deaths in NC as of 11/1/2020,
where the validation accounts for the fact that not all positive cases are lab-reported (See the
Supplemental Appendix). All simulation output values are adjusted to the true population of
10.49 million.
We compute the infection attack rate (IAR) of all infections over the time horizon, the peak
percentage of the population simultaneously infected, the peak count of hospitalizations, and
the mortality of the total population (total deaths or a mortality rate for subpopulations. Since
the model is stochastic, we quantify the mean and standard deviation values over 15
replications, where the number of replications balances reductions in variability of measures
such as IAR and total deaths with computational time. We provide values at the state level,
by county, and stratified by urban/suburban/rural status. In the studied state, 75% of people

are in urban areas, 15% in suburban, and 10% in rural areas. We use the phrase percentage

drop from 30% to 20% IAR is 10 percentage points or a 33% reduction).

RESULTS
Even at low levels of effectiveness, mask-wearing reduces cumulative infections, peak
infections, hospitalizations, and mortality for COVID-19 (Table 1). If 75% of individuals
wear 50% efficacious masks (population-level effectiveness of 37.5%), the IAR, peak
infection, and deaths are reduced by 37%, 68%, and 47%, respectively, vs. no mask use,
even in the setting of effective physical distancing measures. .
Higher mask adherence leads to improvement in each metric, and the improvement is not
necessarily linear. Increasing adherence from 50% to 75% has a higher incremental
improvement in IAR points (5.4) than increasing from 0 to 25% or 25% to 50% (3.6 and 4.3,
respectively). A similar improvement is seen in the number of deaths, which drops by 25.8%
when adherence increases from 50% to 75%.
Notably, in the best scenario we studied where 90% of people wear a mask that is 50%
efficacious, this results in an almost 50% reduction in IAR to 13.7% (compared to 21.7%
with 50% adherence); additionally, peak hospitalizations decrease by 51% and deaths by
36.7% in this scenario.
If higher quality masks are worn, then all metrics improve. As with mask adherence, the
incremental improvement is nonlinear. For example, the IAR decreases incrementally by 7,
8.4, and 2.9 percentage points over the previous value as mask efficacy increases (from 25%
to 50%, then to 75%, then to 90%, respectively, all with adherence of 70%). The incremental
reduction in the number of deaths is also highest as efficacy increases from 50 to 75%.
Performance measures are better if mask adherence is adopted early (starting week 1), but
late mask adherence (starting week 40) still improves population-based outcomes (see Figure
1, which shows the prevalence over time for mask adherence, efficacy, and timing, and Table

1 for corresponding summary values). Early adoption has a cumulative IAR that is 4.8 to 8.7
percentage points better than the corresponding late adoption case, depending on other
parameters. However, even late adoption of mask use with adherence levels of 50%-90%
improves the cumulative IAR over the no mask case by 3.1-7.2 percentage points, and
reduces the number of deaths by 12.1%-25.6%. Late adoption with high mask adherence
(90%) is marginally better than early adoption with low adherence (25% or 50%).
The results vary somewhat by RUCA county type, see Table 1 and Figure 2. Note that
mobility differences across area types (shown in the Supplemental Appendix) indicate that
urban areas have stayed home at higher rates than other areas, d with rural areas remaining
the most mobile. In the baseline scenario (50% adherence): the IAR for suburban areas is
about two points higher than that of urban and rural areas (23.59% versus 21.5% and
21.62%). The difference between urban and rural areas is biggest with 0% mask adherence
(25.7% versus 26.3%) and smallest with 90% adherence (13.63% and 13.64%).When mask
adherence differs across geographies as seems indicated in recent data, then the IAR tends to
be highest for rural areas.
Examination of results across demographics indicate that Whites have the lowest IAR and
Blacks have the highest mortality rate, findings that are consistent across all masking
scenarios.
Finally, the impact of masks on simulation outcomes is additive to the effects of changes in
mobility and voluntary quarantining. The control with no masks and no interventions had an
IAR of 58%, peak prevalence of 4.7%, 49,000 hospitalizations, and more than 27,000 deaths,
while the scenario with mobility changes but 0% mask adherence resulted in 29.6% IAR,
0.74% peak prevalence, 8390 hospitalizations, and fewer than 15000 deaths. In comparison,
the results with 50% efficacy and 70% adherence or with 50% adherence and 75% efficacy
provided additional improvement over no masks, with IAR below 18%, peak prevalence
below 0.3%, hospitalizations below 3300, and deaths below 8600.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
According to this dynamic model of COVID-19 spread, widespread use of masks after
community transmission has begun decreases the impact of the pandemic, even when the
overall effectiveness of the intervention is less than 50%. This finding is consistent with
empirical findings using publicly reported state-based data from April 1 to May 21, 2020 [17]

and a deterministic aggregate model of disease spread [18]. Our modeled scenarios suggest
40% or higher reductions in infections and mortality, over and above those resulting from
physical distancing interventions in place, for scenarios with adherence 70% or greater, at
least 50% efficacy, and early adoption. Even adoption of mask use many months later in the
outbreak can lead to 18% or more reductions in IAR and deaths. We stress that since mask
use does not reduce disease transmission to zero in any scenario, other non-pharmaceutical
(and future pharmaceutical) interventions need to be maintained.
The finding that rural and suburban areas are at risk for high IAR is consistent with the recent
spread of COVID-19 well beyond urban areas [1]. It is somewhat surprising that suburban
areas are at higher risk in some scenarios, although these locales have relatively high
population density compared to rural areas and their mobility changes have been less than in
urban areas (see Supplemental Appendix). Differences in timing of mask adoption and in
adherence across geographical areas may eventually be associated with much higher IAR in
rural areas that adopted masks late compared to urban ones that adopted early, which was as
much as 10 percentage points in the IAR difference in some scenarios from Figure 2. Our
demographic results highlight continued disparities for Blacks even under mask mandates,
and our results likely underestimate the true demographic gap in infections or mortality.
Our findings lend further support to states or other localities considering mask orders and
evidence that such practices have been effective. Improving the quality of masks worn also
has the potential to improve population health, e.g., by shifting people from coverings like
neck gaiters or bandanas with lower efficacy to masks with multiple fabric layers or special
filtration material like N95 masks. Public health organizations should consider adding this to
messaging around face masks. In our discussions with health departments, the ability to
quantify the improvement from increased mask adoption is also valuable in targeting
messaging to the population.
Limitations of this modeling study include potential mischaracterization of SARS-CoV-2
transmission and illness-causing mechanisms, as well lingering data deficits regarding agebased hospitalizations and mortality rates. Some of the key assumptions that are critical
include the efficacy of masks and the adherence in the population. The survey data used
captures whether people report wearing masks “most or all of the time”, which is insufficient
as a true measure of adherence. We do not account for bias in who is wearing a mask, in
terms of their social networks or their mobility patterns. We do not incorporate behavioral

changes with respect to rising infections; our review of the recent mobility and infection data
did not support this consistently across all areas and time periods (unlike earlier analysis by
[19]). If this assumption is wrong then we overestimate the impact of masks. If crowded
hospitals lead to an increased fatality rate then we underestimate the value of masks in
reducing COVID-19-related mortality. The results do not account for vaccination, which we
study in a companion paper [7].
In future research, it may be useful to examine the impact of potential covariance of of
likelihood of vaccine uptake and likelihood of mask use, and consequent implications for
health equity across diverse affected populations.
CONCLUSION
This simulation of the impact of mask use to counter ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
outbreaksprovides evidence that transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be meaningfully
reduced if many people wear masks, especially masks of higher quality. The effect is greater
at higher levels of adherence and with masks of higher efficacy, but still meaningful at the
lowest levels of each examined. Rural areas with low mask adherence are at particularly high
risk for negative outcomes. Specific quantitative values of 20% benefit (late adoption) or
40% (early adoption) may help improve messaging.

Figure 1: Prevalence of infectious people over time is shown. Subfigure (top) shows
prevalence of cases with different levels of population adherence (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%)
while mask efficacy is 50%. Subfigure (middle) shows prevalence with different levels of
mask efficacy (25%, 50%, 75%, 90) while population adherence is 70%. Subfigure (bottom)
shows prevalence with different levels of population adherence under late adoption of masks.

Figure 2: Infection Fatality Rates for areas categorized by urban, rural, and suburban status,
where the band is ± 2 standard deviations around the daily mean for all areas in that category
across all replications. Mask adherence is shown for 0% adherence, 50% across all areas with
early adoption, and two scenarios of differing adherence levels by early and late timing.
