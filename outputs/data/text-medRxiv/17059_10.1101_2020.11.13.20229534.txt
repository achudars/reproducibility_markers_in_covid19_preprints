ABSTRACT:
Overview: Currently, multiple vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are in clinical
trials. In Oct-Nov 2020, 1078 individuals in West Bengal surveyed to evaluate possible
acceptance rates, affordability and factors affecting the acceptance of a vaccine for COVID-19.
Result: 77.27 percent of respondents reported that they would be very or very likely to take a
vaccine for COVID-19, 5.3 percent don’t want to take vaccine and 12.24 don’t know about their
decision. In that 58 percent respondents want to take Indian Vaccine; 19 percent respondents
want to take foreign vaccine. Other respondents can take any vaccine. The affordability, 40
percent respondents want a vaccine bellow 500 INR, 25 percent respondents want a vaccine of
500-1000 INR. 11 percent respondents want vaccine of over 1000 INR.
Method of Study: The google form is prepared with the questions on acceptance and affordability
of vaccines. The form is circulated digitally among the people and then we have collected the
data in excel. Based on the result we have prepared our statistical graphs.
Conclusion: Majority of Responders want a COVID 19 vaccine. Majority responders want
Indian COVID19 Vaccine. Majority responders want a vaccine in a cost of below 500 INR.
Introduction:
It is expected that the COVID-19 pandemic will begin to inflict immense morbidity and
mortality pressures thus seriously affecting populations and economies worldwide. Governments
must be prepared to ensure access to and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines on a wide scale, in a
equal manner, if and when safe and reliable vaccines become available. This would include
ample capacity for the health sector, as well as strategies to increase trust in and understanding of
the vaccine and those that administer it. In 2015, considering the availability of vaccination
facilities, the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Committee of
Immunization Experts described vaccine hesitancy as a 'delay in approval or denial of
vaccination'(1), which may differ in type and severity depending on when and where it occurs
and what vaccine is involved, as has been verified in several studies (2,3). Vaccine hesitancy
issues are rising globally (4); in particular, in 2019, WHO recognized it as one of the top ten
global health risks. Vaccine hesitancy and disinformation in many countries poses major
challenges to the achievement of coverage and population immunity (5,6). Governments, public
health agencies and awareness organizations must be prepared to tackle hesitancy and improve
vaccine awareness so that, where possible, the population supports immunization. Antivaccination groups are now lobbying against the need for a vaccine in several nations, with

others questioning the presence of COVID-19 entirely. Misinformation sent across multiple
networks may have a major effect on the approval of a COVID-19 vaccine. (7,8). Governments
and communities must assess existing levels of readiness to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine that is
potentially safe and successful and identify causes of hesitancy and or approval of the vaccine.
Phizer COVID 19 vaccine is 90% effective in SARS-COV2 infection COVID19 and it will be
distributed from dec.(9) We are surveying on 1078 respondents in the focus of willingness and
affordability of the vaccine.
Methodology of the study:
This is a survey based study which is done in west Bengal, a state in India. The Capital of West
Bengal is India. In this survey a questionnaire is prepared on the acceptance and the affordability
of COVID 19 vaccine. The questionnaire is prepared in google form and the google form is
circulated among the people of West Bengal. The Data is taken in Excel sheet and the statistical
graph is prepared in SSPS.
The Questionnaire is

that you want to take vaccine or not when it will be available in

minutes only. Thank You

Discussion: This study is based on a Spanish study which is published in Nature.(10) Our study
is focused in only one state in India that is West Bengal. We have seen that most of the
responders eagerly waiting for a vaccine which is a good sign. Although some responders have
many misconceptions and educational gaps for which they don’t want to take a vaccine. A proper
awareness is needed to them. Responders will prefer a Indian Vaccine although they have
informed that which vaccine will come first in the market they will take irrespective of any
origin. The responder’s affordability is checked in this study where most of the responders wants
a cheap vaccine or a free vaccine from the government.
This study shows people eagerly waiting for a COVID19 vaccine. Although there are some
limitation in the study. We made it digital survey, so the class of responders have a basic
education and have a smart phone. Due to COVID 19 situation we are unable to reach the slam
area community people. Some people don’t know anything about vaccine so there is an
educational gap. A proper awareness about vaccination is needed.
Conclusion: Majority of Responders want a COVID 19 vaccine. Majority responders want
Indian COVID19 Vaccine. Majority responders want a vaccine in a cost of below 500 INR.
