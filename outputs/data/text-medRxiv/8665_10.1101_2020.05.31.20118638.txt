A key question in COVID-19 infection is why some previously healthy patients
develop severe pulmonary failure and some ultimately die. Initial pulmonary failure
does not exhibit classical features of ARDS; hypercoagulability is a common
laboratory finding, and pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy has been reported
post mortem1,2,3. Biomarkers cannot robustly identify such patients pre-emptively and
no specific interventions exist to mitigate clinical deterioration. Mononuclear
phagocytic cells are key immune cells and bind fibrinogen through the CD11b/CD18
dimer CR3, whose activated form can initiate microthrombus formation. Accordingly,
we profiled circulating monocyte CD11b/CD18 cell surface density from COVID-19
infected adults who were (i) symptomatic but breathless, (ii) requiring ventilatory
support, and (iii) recovering following ICU care for hypoxia.
Methods
We repurposed a multiparameter flow cytometry assay, used routinely in our
institution for the diagnosis of leukaemia, to measure the cell surface expression
density of CD11b and CD18 in peripheral blood monocytes from three clinically
distinct groups of COVID19 patients (29 in total), and compared them to non-COVID19 patients requiring ventilatory support, with the historical group of healthy controls
used for initial test calibration as reference. Analysis was performed using surplus
material from routine CBC specimens. Sample preparation was with the TQ-Prep
whole blood lysis system (Beckman Coulter), and antibody staining was with a
Duraclone lyophilised antibody panel (B38683, Beckman Coulter, Table 1). A
minimum of 50000 events were collected: monocytes were defined as
CD45+CD13+CD33++CD15+/-SScint cells. The expression level of each antigen was
calculated as its corrected Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI): [raw value arithmetic
mean fluorescence in monocytes - raw value arithmetic mean fluorescence in
CD45++CD2+CD56- SSclo T cells]. We defined “hypoxic” patients as requiring ICU
Level 3 ventilatory support within 15 days of a PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV2
infection; “convalescing” as having recovered following ICU care for COVID with
minimal or absent oxygen requirements, but at least 30 days from initial diagnosis;
and “well” as having mild symptoms prompting a positive PCR test within the
previous 10 days, but who were neither ever breathless nor hospitalised. No patient
in this study had a prior history of malignancy or immunosuppression.

Results
Table 2 shows clinical and haematological parameters and Figure 1 the levels of
monocyte CD11b and CD18 for each COVID-19 group and the two non-COVID-19
cohorts. CBC parameters were not significantly different, however expression of both
CD11b and CD18 was higher in COVID-19 patients who were hypoxic requiring
respiratory support. Convalescing patients had intermediate levels of CD11b, but
CD18 had returned to normal. Levels were not elevated in patients who had SARSCoV2 infection but remained well, and those requiring ventilatory support for reasons
other than COVID-19. Consistent with others, we found that hypoxic COVID-19
patients had lymphopenia, but this was also seen in non-COVID hypoxic patients,
and likely represents a stress response.
Discussion
Monocytes mediate initial immune responses to pathogens, induce inflammation
following tissue damage and regulate haemostasis at sites of injury4. CD11b and
CD18, which together constitute Complement Receptor 3 (CR3) are key to this5. We
demonstrate that monocyte CR3 is significantly increased in COVID-19 patients with
hypoxia compared with those without respiratory symptoms and non-COVID hypoxic
patients. This hitherto unappreciated observation tables monocyte activation as a
biomarker for respiratory complications in COVID-19, possibly by driving thrombotic
microangiopathy due to increased binding of fibrinogen. Although adaptive immune
responses to SARS-CoV2 determine subsequent immunity, innate immune
responses dictate the early clinical course, and our findings encourage serial
tracking of monocyte CR3 expression in individual patients with COVID-19. CR3 may
be targeted therapeutically; both non-specifically by early anticoagulation, or directly
using several licensed drugs5. Such approaches may reduce the likelihood of
respiratory failure and could inform a preventative approach to the management of
COVID19- mediated respiratory failure in the future.

Laboratory parameters of patient groups. COVID “hypoxic”, COVID “convalescing”
and non-COVID ”hypoxic” cohorts had significantly lower CD3+4+ and CD3+8+ T cell
counts, and significantly higher serum LDH levels than the COVID “well” group
(p<0.05). The difference in D-Dimer between the three COVID groups was not
significant.
