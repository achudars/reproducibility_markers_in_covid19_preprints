Health Condition and Test Availability as Predictors of Adults’ Mental Health
during the COVID-19 Pandemic
ABSTRACT
Background:
Research identifying adults’ mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic relies
solely on demographic predictors without examining adults’ health status during the
COVID-19 pandemic as a potential predictor.
Methods:
An online survey of 669 adults in Malaysia was conducted during May 2–8, 2020, six
weeks after a Movement Control Order (MCO) was issued.
Findings:
Adults’ health condition had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped)
with insomnia, anxiety, depression and distress. Reported test availability for
COVID-19 (from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” ) also had curvilinear
relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with anxiety and depression. Younger
adults reported worse mental health, but people from various religions and ethnic
groups did not differ significantly in reported mental health.
Interpretation:
Adults with worse health conditions had more mental health problems, especially
adults at the lower end of the health spectrum. Test availability negatively predicted
anxiety and depression, especially for adults experiencing poor COVID-19 test
availability. The significant predictions of health condition and COVID-19 test

1. Introduction
In May 2020, the UN Secretary-General issued a message that the COVID-19
pandemic had resulted in massive mental suffering and called for actions.1 A number
of studies have predicted the mental health of adults by means of demographic
variables,2–5 but little research has predicted mental health based on adults’ health
status during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is the first, to the best of our
knowledge, to identify such predictors, specifically adults’ health condition and
availability of testing for COVID-19.
First, good health condition can lower individuals’ chance of COVID-19 infection,
and healthcare workers (e.g., general practitioners) may already have some
knowledge of the health status of people under their care. Second, as individuals have
heterogeneous access to COVID-19 testing due to limited testing capacity in many
countries, individuals who have poorer access to COVID-19 testing may be more
concerned or anxious about the COVID-19 pandemic. Test availability for COVID-19
is potentially a unique predictor of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. Methods
The first case of COVID-19 in Malaysia was confirmed on February 4, 2020, and
on March 18, 2020, Malaysia implemented a Movement Control Order (MCO) to ban
citizens from non-essential travel and mass gatherings. The data for this study was
collected by an online survey from May 2 to 8, 2020, six weeks after the
implementation of the MCO. On May 8, 2020, there were a total of 6,535 confirmed
cases of COVID-19 and 108 deaths.6

Even though we were not aiming for a fully representative sample, we applied
two-stage stratified sampling in terms of ethnicity, gender, age, and geographical area7
to ensure coverage of all regions and ethnic groups in Malaysia.8 Participation in this
survey was voluntary and participants could opt-out at any time. Moreover,
participants were assured anonymity and confidentiality of their responses. The
survey was granted ethical approval by Tsinghua University (20200322). The online
survey was issued in Malay, Mandarin and English, the major languages used in
Malaysia.
The participants reported their demographic characteristics, including gender, age,
education level, number of children under 18 years old in the household, religion, and
ethnic group. We assessed health condition using the global health measure SF-19
with a five-point scale from 1 to 5 (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent). To capture
availability of testing for COVID-19 in Malaysia, we asked participants to rate the
statement “I can get a test for COVID-19 rapidly if I need it” from 1 to 7 (strongly
disagree, disagree, somewhat disagree, neither agree nor disagree, somewhat agree,
agree, strongly agree). We used four dimensions for mental health: insomnia, anxiety,
depression and distress.
Insomnia. Adults’ insomnia was measured with the five-item Athens Insomnia
Scale (AIS-5)10, including “I have trouble falling asleep” and “I feel tired and
worn-out after my usual amount of sleep”. The items were scored from 1 (to a very
small extent) to 5 (to a very large extent). The Cronbach’s alpha was 0·82.
Anxiety. Adults’ anxiety was measured by the seven-item generalized anxiety

disorder (GAD-7)11 scale. The seven items were scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly
every day). The Cronbach’s alpha was 0·92.
Depression. Adults’ depression was measured with the nine-item Patient Health
Questionnaire depression module (PHQ-9),12 with items scored from 0 (not at all) to 3
(nearly every day). The Cronbach’s alpha was 0.90.
Distress. Adults’ psychological distress was measured with the six-item K6
screening scale,13 with items scored from 1 (all of the time) to 5 (none of the time).
The Cronbach’s alpha was 0·95.
We applied ordinary least squares (OLS) regression for the four dependent
variables. Stata 16·0 was used to identify the predictors for insomnia, anxiety,
depression and distress.

3. Results
3.1 Descriptive findings
Overall, 669 adults from all the states and federal territories of Malaysia
participated in this survey. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the sample.
Participation by both genders was almost equal. The youngest participant was 21
years old and the oldest was 71 years old. Malaysia is a diverse country in terms of
ethnicity and religion. Religion and ethnicity were reported in Table 1. Overall, our
sample captured all the major ethnic and religious groups in Malaysia, but the sample
is not taken as representative.
The average levels of mental health of adults in Malaysia were different from

adults in other countries. The mean scores of insomnia (AIS-5), anxiety (GAD-7),
depression (PHQ-9) and distress (K6) were 1·76 (SD = 0·84), 4·50 (SD = 4·90), 4·67
(SD = 5·12), and 5·95 (SD = 6·51), respectively. The mean scores of depression and
anxiety in Malaysia were significantly lower than those in a sample of 300 adults
collected on January 31 to February 7, 2020 in China14 of 8·3 (difference = -3·63, se =
0·39, 95% CI: -2·95 to -4·45, p < 0·001) and 7·7 (difference = -3·20, se = 0·37, 95%
CI: -2·47 to -3·93, p < 0·001), and also lower than scores in a sample of 1,009 adults
on April 10–20, 2020 in Austria15 of 6·20 (difference = -1·53, se = 0·26, 95% CI: -0·98
to -2·02, p < 0·001) and 5·85 (difference = -1·35, se = 0·26, 95% CI: -0·98 to -2·02, p
< 0·001). The average degree of distress in a sample of 369 working adults (mean =
8·46) in China16 was significantly higher than in our sample (difference = 3·36, se =
0·32, 95% CI: 3·98 to 2·74, p < 0·001). The proportion of insomnia disorder in our
sample (38·9%, n = 669) was similar to that in a sample collected during April 10–13,
2020 in Greece (37·6%, n = 2,427, difference = 1·3%, p = 0·540) during the
COVID-19 pandemic.17

3.2 Predictors of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and distress
Table 2 presents the results of the regression models. The quadratic terms of
health condition (health condition – square in Table 2) were significant across the
regressions for all four dimensions of mental health: insomnia (β = 0·10, 95% CI: 0·03
to 0·17, p = 0·003), anxiety (β = 0·79, 95% CI: 0·36 to 1·22, p < 0·001), depression (β
= 0·74, 95% CI: 0·38 to 1·11, p < 0·001), and distress (β = 0·45, 95% CI: 0·01 to 0·88,
p = 0·045), demonstrating curvilinear relationships between health condition and
mental health dimensions. The margin analysis of the slope of insomnia by health
condition was -0·71 (p < 0·001) at “poor”, -0·51 (p < 0·001) at “fair”, -0·31 (p < 0·001)
at “good”, -0·10 (p = 0·017) at “very good”, and 0·10 (p = 0·328) at “excellent” health
condition, showing a horizontally reversed J-shaped curve across the scoring range of
health condition· Similar curvilinear relationships were also observed from “poor” to
“excellent” health condition for anxiety (d = -5·34, p < 0·001; d = -3·76, p < 0·001; d
= -2·18, p < 0·001; d = -0·60, p = 0·019; d = 0·98, p = 0·114), depression (d = -5·04, p
< 0·001; d = -3·55, p < 0·001; d = -2·06, p < 0·001; d = -0·57, p = 0·024; d = 0·91, p =
0·104) and distress (d = -3·11, p = 0·006; d = -2·21, p = 0·002; d = -1·32, p < 0·001; d

= -0·43, p = 0·188; d = 0·46, p = 0·511).
The quadratic term of test availability (test availability – square in Table 2) was
positively associated with anxiety (β = 0·17, 95% CI: 0·03 to 0·31, p = 0·017) and
depression (β = 0·16, 95% CI: 0·02 to 0·29, p = 0·027). The margin analysis of the
slope of anxiety by test availability was -1·49 (p < 0·004) at “strongly disagree”, -1·15
(p = 0·002) at “disagree”, -0·81 (p = 0·001) at “somewhat disagree”, -0·48 (p = 0·001)
at “neither disagree nor agree”, -0·14 (p = 0·311) at “somewhat agree”, 0·19 (p =
0·423) at “agree”, and 0·53 (p = 0·152) at “strongly agree”, showing a horizontally
reversed J-shaped curve across the scoring range of test availability. The margin
analysis of the slope of depression by test availability demonstrated a similar pattern
at the 7-point anchor from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” (d = -1·41, p =
0·005; d = -1·10, p = 0·003; d = -0·79, p = 0·001; d = -0·48, p = 0·001; d = -0·17, p =
0·263; d = 0·16, p = 0·562; d = 0·46, p = 0·227).
In addition, age negatively predicted insomnia (β = -0·02, 95% CI: -0·02 to -0·01,
p < 0·001), anxiety (β = -0·08, 95% CI: -0·11 to -0·05, p < 0·001), depression (β =
-0·11, 95% CI: -0·14 to -0·08, p < 0·001) and distress (β = -0·06, 95% CI: -0·10 to
-0·02, p = 0·005). Although we included religion and ethnicity in the regression model,
insomnia, anxiety, depression and distress did not vary significantly by
them· Significant results are shown in Figure 1.

4. Discussion
This study identifies several predictors of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and
distress among adults in Malaysia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with
past studies,5,18 age was found to be a predictor of mental health problems for the
general population in Malaysia. This is also consistent with studies of healthcare
workers, where older healthcare workers were less likely to have mental health
problems.19,20 However, other predictors found in the literature, such as education16
and gender,17 failed to predict mental health among adults in Malaysia, similar to a
study in the UK.5 Our results suggest that future research should identify the effect of
education and gender across more countries and future meta-analysis should identify
contingent factors. Religion and ethnic group did not predict Malaysian adults’ mental
health, consistent with another Malaysian study21 which found that ethnicity is not
correlated with mental health disorder. In line with previous research, our findings
highlight the need to identify specific predictors of mental health under various
contexts of the COVID-19 pandemic.19
More importantly, this study uncovers two unique risk factors for mental health.
The first risk factor is existing health condition, which had significant curvilinear
relationships with insomnia, anxiety, depression and distress. The results indicated
that adults with worse reported health condition had worse mental health, especially
for those at the lower end of the health spectrum. In other words, individuals’ existing
health condition is a useful screener of insomnia, anxiety, depression and distress for
less healthy adults.
The second risk factor is test availability for COVID-19 having curvilinear

relationships with anxiety and depression. Test unavailability predicted worse anxiety
and depression, especially for people who disagreed that they could get tested for
COVID-19 when needed. There was also no significant difference in mental health
among people who “somewhat agreed”, “agreed” and “strongly agreed” that they
could get a COVID-19 test. Test availability could be a predictor of mental health,
especially for adults who reported they lack access to COVID-19 tests.
Our findings suggest that healthcare service providers could use adults’ general
health condition and COVID-19 test availability to identify mentally vulnerable
adults. The curvilinear relationships highlight the need to pay more attention to adults
with poor health condition and adults who lack access to a COVID-19 test. Healthcare
service providers such as hospitals may be able to use the health records of their
patients and COVID-19 testing coverage to help identify those who need more mental
health assistance.
4.1 Limitations and future work
Firstly, we used a two-stage stratified sampling method to aim for a broader
coverage of Malaysian adults, but our study did not aim for a representative sample of
adults in Malaysia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, we used SF-1, a brief
one-item measure of general health condition, and future research may use the
lengthier form of SF-12 or SF-36. Thirdly, instead of general health condition, future
research may explore specific medical issues, such as heart disease, diabetes, or
cancer, as predictors of mental health. Fourthly, we measured adults’ perceived test
availability for COVID-19 because we were interested in their mental health and

future research may use alternative indicators of COVID-19 test availability.
4.2 Conclusion
This study identified two unique predictors of health condition and test
availability for COVID-19 for Malaysian adults’ mental health, operationalized as
insomnia, anxiety, depression and distress. Unlike the demographic predictors
identified in prior research, these two risk factors suggest new risk factors to predict
mental health. Moreover, these predictors carried quadratic associations with various
mental health dimensions, implying a need to focus on curvilinear predictors of
mental health.
