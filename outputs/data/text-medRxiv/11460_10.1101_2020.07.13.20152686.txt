ABSTRACT
The Distributed Logistic Model and the Adaptive Logistic Model of epidemics are formulated and used to study the course of cases and deaths during
the COVID-19 pandemic. The distributed model is designed to account for a
spread of initiation times of hot spots across a country; it does especially well
at capturing the initial and linear phases of epidemics. The adaptive model
accounts for the development of social mitigation factors, and does especially
well at capturing the declining phases of epidemics. The historical data for the
U.S., Italy, and the U.K. are analyzed in detail. The parameters of the fits
to the two models provide complementary information about the pandemic.
The initial infection rate constant was r0 ≃ 0.29 day−1 for each country, and
the effective infection rate constants evolved with time in essentially the same
way for each. This suggests that mitigation effects were equally effective in
all three countries. Analysis with the distributed model suggests that it took
somewhat different times T for the epidemic to spread across each country,
with T (US)≃ 50 days significantly greater than the T ’s of Italy or the U.K.
The mortality ratio in the U.S. was about 0.061 while in Italy and U.K. it was
much larger at about 0.15.

Introduction

Currently a pandemic of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is overspreading the
world. The United States has been particularly impacted by the disease it causes, COVID19. Epidemiologists have worked to describe adequately this pandemic and to predict its
future course. This is a complex undertaking, involving the mathematics of epidemiology
and a vast amount of uncertain data that serve as input to the models (see, for example,
CCD 2020; Fivethirtyeight 2020).
This paper derives two new epidemiological models, the Distributed Logistic Model and
the Adaptive Logistic Model, and uses them to study the course of the COVID-19 pandemic
in the U.S., Italy, and the U.K. The goal of each model is to extract different information
about the progress of each epidemic; they are not merely ad hoc parameterizations designed
to fit the data.
The plan of this paper is as follows: Section 2 reviews standard epidemiological approaches to the study of the COVID-19 pandemic, section 3 introduces the basic logistic
model, section 4 derives the Distributed Logistic Model, section 5 derives the Adaptive
Logistic Model, section 6 uses these two models to extract new information about each
epidemic, and section 7 discusses the results.

Approaches to the Study of Epidemics
The SIR and Other Models for Epidemics

The study of the spread of disease through a population is a highly mathematical enterprise involving the solution of multiple coupled ordinary differential equations (see, for
example, Hethcote 2000). The fundamental set of equations are the Susceptible-InfectedRecovered/Removed (“SIR”) equations (Kermack & McKendrick 1927) and their extensions and generalizations (Hethcote 2000 and references therein). These equations describe
the flow of individuals among three or more classes using a series of coupled rate equations.
In some cases (Lavrova et al. 2017) they can be reduced to the single logistic differential
equation (Verhulst (1838), Equation 1 below).

Applications of the SIR Equations to the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic

Numerous authors have applied the SIR equations or their generalizations to the study
of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Huang et al. (2020) used the standard SIR model to
examine the COVID-19 pandemic in China, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Faroe Islands, French
Guiana, Maldives, Malta, Martinique, and Republic of Moldova. Chen et al. (2020) used a
time-dependent SIR model to study the outbreaks in China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran.
They concluded that various approaches to social distancing could lead to a reduction
in the basic reproductive number R0 . Zhao and Chen (2020) applied a Susceptible, Unquarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to study
several cities and regions of China. They extracted the reproductive numbers R and other
parameters, and predicted the course of the epidemics. Wangping et al. (2020) used an
extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model to study the epidemic in Italy and
compare it to that in China.
The American Hospital Association keeps an updated compendium of the models
being used to track the COVID-19 pandemic (AHA 2020), as does the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC 2020). Among the goals of these studies has been to predict
the future course of the pandemic. The results have varied widely, and have not engendered
a great deal of confidence in this enterprise (e.g., Best & Boice (2020), CDC (2020)).

2.3.

Applications of the Logistic Equation and Its Generalizations

Other authors have used the logistic equation (Equation 1 below) or its generalizations
to analyze the epidemics in various countries. Shen (2020) used the logistic equation
to study the outbreaks in ten Chinese municipalities and nine western countries. They
concluded that there is potential for this model to contribute to better public health policy
in combatting COVID-19. This study also outlined certain challenges in modeling and
their implications for the results. Chen, Chen, & Chen (2020) studied the epidemic in the
United States using a five-parameter logistic model,
C(t) = Cmin + 

Cmax − Cmin
α ,
1 + e−r(t−tmin )

where C(t) is the population of infected individuals. This is a generalization of the solution
to the logistic equation given in Equation 2 below. Here tmin and α are ad hoc parameters.
These authors demonstrated the ability of this model to fit the U.S data. Wu et al. (2020)

Batista (2020) used the logistic growth model for estimation of the final sizes and peak
times of the coronavirus epidemic in China, South Korea, and the rest of the world.
Except for Wu et al. (2020), these models provided only modestly good fits to the
data. In no case could the added parameters be interpreted physically. The sections below
show how this situation can be improved by two well motivated modifications of the logistic
equation.

2.4.

Approach in This Paper

The current paper takes a different tack toward providing a mathematical description
of epidemics. The procedure will be to make two separate modifications to the logistic
equation, changes that represent two effects that are neglected in derivation of the basic
logistic equation. The goal is to use the data to determine the values of the new parameters
that are introduced, and then to interpret them in terms of the course of the spread of the
disease and of the response of humanity to the pandemic.
The history of the epidemic in each country is encapsulated in a time series of cases
of infections and a time series of deaths. The sections below analyze these data using
the basic logistic equation and the two modifications. The reader should note that the
author is a physicist not an epidemiologist, and that his approach will be intrinsically that
of his discipline. However, the results of the analyses will be connected to the real world
environment of the pandemic.

Basic Logistic Model
3.1.

Derivation

The simplest model for the evolution of an epidemic is based on the logistic differential
equation. This describes an epidemic that begins with a small number f0 of infected
individuals at a single time and place, and subsequently spreads through a population.
The motivation for this model is as follows. If the population of infected individuals (i.e.,
the total number of cases of disease) as a function of time is f (t), simple exponential growth
with growth rate constant r is determined by the differential equation
df
= rf,
dt
with the growing exponential solution
f (t) = f0 ert ,
where f0 = f (0). That is what happens with an unlimited pool of subjects. However, for
a finite number of subjects K, as the population of infected individuals grows the number
of subjects available to be infected is reduced by the factor (1 − f /K); taking this into
account leads to the logistic differential equation,2

The solution of this equation is well known to be
f (t) =

K + f0 (ert − 1)

(2)

which satisfies the conditions f (0) = f0 and f (∞) = K. The time course described by
Eqn. 2 is the familiar S curve used to describe bacterial growth and other rate limited
phenomena (see Fig. 1 for examples). The history of the total number of cases of disease
can be fitted by this equation to determine the parameters r and K, each of which has
a well-defined meaning. In particular, K represents a prediction of the endpoint of the
epidemic.
An analysis of the total number of cases as a function of time with f (t) is not the only
way to compare model and data. Instead one can examine the number of new cases per
2

This is a version of the Bernoulli differential equation f ′ = f (1 − f ).

In either case, for the logistic model the three parameters to be adjusted are f0 , K, and

The fits to the U.S. data on number of cases and number of deaths4 are shown in Fig. 1.
The basic logistic model will be referred to as the BLM.

Fitting the daily numbers is statistically the preferred procedure as the data points are independent,
unlike those for daily totals. Where there are results from fitting total data and from fitting daily data, the
latter will be adopted.

The use of the logistic equation to fit the data on deaths is justified in below.

The Distributed Logistic Model
4.1.

Derivation

In reality the COVID-19 epidemic in the US is a series of epidemics centered at various
places distributed across the country and beginning over a range of times. This can be
accounted for this by averaging a series of logistic distributions over a range of starting
times ti spanning a total time T ; the appropriate function to be averaged is
Kf0 er(t−ti )
.
K + f0 (er(t−ti ) − 1)

f (t, ti ) =

(4)

To account for a total range of time T over which the various hot spots of the epidemic
are distributed, one integrates Eqn. 4 over 0 ≤ ti ≤ T and divides by T . The result is the
distributed logistic function

and is used to model the daily data. For the Distributed Logistic Model the four parameters
to be adjusted are f0 , K, r, and T ; the total number and the daily numbers are fit
independently. The fits to the U.S. data on cases of disease and on deaths are shown in
Fig. 3 below. The Distributed Logistic Model will be referred to as the DLM.5

The Adaptive Logistic Model

Derivation

During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries across the world introduced a
number of measures to reduce the spread of the disease, including quarantining, masking,

The DLM was introduced by Roberts (2020) who analyzed only U.S. cases.

social distancing, and contact tracing and isolating. As the pandemic progressed these
measures tended to become more effective. Their effect was to make the average infected
individual progressively less likely to infect another person. A factor that reduces the
probability of transmission as the pandemic progresses can be introduced into Eqn. 1 to
account for this effect. A simple way to do this is to modify the infection rate constant r by a
function that decreases as the infected population increases. After some experimentation,6
the function S/(S+g) = 1/(1+g/S), where S is a dimensionless parameter to be determined
from the data, was chosen, leading to the adaptive logistic equation7

decreases, so reff is a function of time. The Adaptive Logistic Model fits to the U.S. data
are shown in Fig. 4. The Adaptive Logistic Model will be referred to as the ALM.

5.2.

Method of Solution

For the BLM and the DLM the parameters were estimated from the data by use of
non-linear least squares minimization of the differences between the data and the prediction
of Eq. 1, 3, 5, or 6 using the NMinimize function in MathematicaTM. A closed form
solution to Eqn. 7 could not be found, so it was solved and fit to the data numerically.
This was done with MathematicaTM code whose key parts are shown in Fig. 2. In this
example, the matrix CovidTotalCases contains the data.8 To determine the predicted
distributions of the number of daily cases or deaths one takes the numerical derivatives
of the fits to g(t). It must be emphasized that this does not fit the daily numbers, it
6

Models where the function is of the form e−g/S or e−t/τ , where τ is a characteristic time, were also
explored, as were hybrid models that included both factors. None of these provided fits to the data as close
as the choice 1/(1 + g/S), so it was used in Eqn. 7.
7

Eqn. 7 is so named because it models a population’s adaptation to the disease.

The Analyses of the Pandemic

The logistic equations are intended to describe the time behavior of the number of
cases of disease. However, if the mortality ratio is roughly time independent for a given
country, the same functions will describe the history of deaths;10 thus both cases and deaths
are analyzed using Equations 2, 3, 5, 6, & 7. The BLM was applied only to the U.S. data.
The data were taken from ECDPC (2020); they span January 31, 2019 through June
22, 2020 (174 days).

Eqn. 7 cannot be used to fit directly the daily numbers.
Section 7.2 below shows that the mortality ratio evolves only slightly through each epidemic.

Comparison of the Models

Figures 1, 3, & 4 show the fits of the three logistic models to the same four U.S. data
sets. It is apparent from these figures that the BLM does poorly at fitting any of the data
sets, and it will not be considered further.11 It is for this reason that the other two models
were derived; the motivations for their specific forms are given with their derivations. Now
the question is, which of these two new models provides a superior representative of the
data? Figure 5 is a comparison of the DLM and ALM fits to the daily U.S. cases data. Both
models are successful at fitting the exponential rise and subsequent linear phase, while the
ADM is more successful at fitting the declining phase of the epidemic. The parameter T
in the DLM tells us the length of time it has taken the epidemic to spread across each
country, while the parameter S in the ALM contains information on the time history of
the effective infection rate constant.
Two measures of the qualities of the fits are shown in Tables 1 & 2, the scaled12 rootmean-squared deviation for the daily data (RMSdaily ) and the scaled chi-squared per degree
of freedom13 for the daily data (χ2 /d.o.f.). Which model provides us with better understanding of epidemics? Overall, the values of the scaled RMS’s and the scaled (χ2 /d.o.f)’s
in Tables 1 & 2 suggest that the ALM is superior. However, examination of the figures
shows that these differences are largely due to the declining phases of the daily curves, and
that the DLM provides a good fit to the initial rises and the linear phases of the curves.
Thus the DLM will be used to estimate the parameter T and the ALM to determine the
parameter S (see §7).
The next two sections show the cases and deaths data for Italy and the U.K., and
display the best fits to the DLM and the ALM for each data set.

11

The values of the infection rate constant r derived from the BLM will be used to compare to the results
from the DLM and the ALM.
12

To account for the larger numbers of cases than deaths, the values for the cases data were scaled by
the mean mortality ratio to compare them with the results for the death data.
13

Poisson statistics were used for the uncertainties of each datum, where σi2 = gi , where gi is the model
prediction for the ith datum. This leads to χ2 per degree of freedom greatly in excess of unity, suggesting
that this estimate for σi is significantly too small. Although these statistics cannot be used to determine a
goodness of fit, they can be used to compare qualitatively the fits for different models and data sets.

Discussion

The History of Cases Versus that of Deaths

The history of testing in the U.S. is such that early on in the epidemic cases were
recognized only when people exhibiting symptoms were tested, but as testing became more
widespread, cases were discovered in asymptomatic individuals. This has the effect of
increasing the number of cases as the epidemic proceeds. The same is not true for deaths,
so one expects deaths to provide a more accurate measure of the history of the epidemic.
Indeed, examination of Figures 4, 7 & 9 shows a faster decline in the number of deaths
than in the number of cases, as expected from this argument. The parameters derived from
the deaths data will be adopted in the analysis below.

7.2.

The Mortality Ratios and Infection Delays

It is interesting to learn if and how the mortality ratio M evolved during the epidemics
in each country. One analysis found the best single M and time shift ∆t for each country
by shifting and scaling the raw daily cases and comparing the results to the deaths data; it
found M and ∆t by minimizing the summed squares of their differences. Fig. 10 shows the
shifted and scaled data, and the best fit parameters M and ∆t are in Table 3. The ratio
M was found to be significantly lower in the U.S. than in Italy or the U.K. The delays
between the cases and deaths curves were about 6 days for the U.S. and Italy, but zero
for the U.K. (which we do not understand). The delays presumably represents the average
course of the disease for each fatality, confounded by differences in reporting of the two
phenomena.
Second, Fig. 11 shows the instantaneous mortality ratios calculated by dividing the
deaths by cases (shifted by ∆t); it also shows the mean mortality ratios M just determined.
A general trend is that the mortality ratios vary slowly with time in each country.

Comparison of Parameters in Common in DLM and ALM

1. For Italy and the U.K., in both the DLM and the ALM the K’s closely equal the
total numbers Ntot (sizes of the data sets). However for the U.S. K is significantly
larger than Ntot , suggesting that the epidemic has more time to run.
2. For each model the initial infection rate constants are comparable in the three coun-

tries, and they are different for the DLM (0.11) and ALM (0.29). This difference is
because r and r0 have different meanings in the DLM and the ALM.
3. It is important to realize that the parameter r, the infection rate constant in the
BLM and DLM, is distinct from the initial infection rate constant r0 of the ALM.
While r is truly a constant, r0 is the infection rate constant only at the outset of
the epidemic; it is the effective infection rate constant reff that determines the rate
dg/dt at any later time. Eqn. 8 shows how this goes, and it’s illustrated in Fig. 12,
which compares the effective values reff (t) along with the values of r from the BLM
(Table 4) for each country. Since the way reff varies with time depends on the value
of S, which is different for each country, a simple comparison of r0 ’s across countries
would be misleading. The correct treatment is to compare plots of reff (t) as each
epidemic unfolds, as shown in Fig. 12. From these plots one can conclude that the
effective infection rate constants for all three countries are essentially identical for
given times after the onset of each epidemic.
4. As discussed above, one expects the behavior of the numbers of deaths with time to
more accurately reflect the course of the epidemics than does the behavior of cases.
Because the fits to the ALM are systematically superior to those to the DLM, the
ALM values were adopted in each case when they were available. With these things
in mind, Table 4 presents the best estimates of the properties of the epidemics, listed
by country.

good representations of the full course of the epidemic in any country.
2. Comparing Figs. 1 and 2, one can see the effect of adding the time smoothing parameter T on the DLM curves. The result fits much better the widths of the data history,
and better fits the rise of the epidemics. The result is T (US) > T (Italy) > T (UK).
This is what is expected given the geographical sizes of the three countries. The
value T (US) ≃ 50 days is comparable to the interval over which hot spots developed
across the U.S. during the spring of 2020 (New York Times, 2020). One expects that
subsequent analysis with the DLM will find T to have increased as more and more
hot spots arise due to the easing of mitigating factors across the countries, especially
in the U.S.
3. The ALM can well describe the epidemics, and its best estimates of the effective
infection rate constants reff as a function of time show them to be essentially identical
for all three countries.
4. For each model separately the initial infection rate constants are essentially identical
in the three countries.
5. The fact that the effective infection rate constant declines with time is likely the
product of increasing mitigation efforts and improving medical treatments.
6. The time-averaged mortality ratio in the U.S. was about 0.061, while in Italy and
U.K. it was much higher at about 0.14. In all three countries it tended to vary slowly
through each epidemic.

Concluding Remarks

This paper has presented two new versions of the logistic model that describe the
evolution of the number of infections in an epidemic as a function of time. The first
modification, the Distributed Logistic Model (DLM), approximates the spread of disease
centers across a large country like the United States; this introduces a single new parameter
T that measures the time span over which different hotspots appear. It is successful in
capturing the initial and linear phases of the epidemics in each country. However, it is
intrinsically time-symmetric, with the rising and declining phases of the daily curves being
mirror images, which does not match the data. The basis of the second modification, the
Adaptive Logistic Model (ALM), is an infection rate constant that declines with time as
public health and social mitigation measures are introduced; this requires a single new
parameter S that parameterizes the point at which social mitigation efforts take effect.
This model, which is intrinsically asymmetric across an epidemic, is especially successful
at capturing the declining phases of epidemics. When fit to all of the data for number of
cases and number of deaths, the results for both models are good, especially for the ALM.
The results of the fitting show (1) that it took about two months for the epidemic to spread
across the U.S., and somewhat less time for Italy and the U.K, and (2) that mitigation
efforts have been equally successful in the three countries.
These new approaches are useful ways to understand the histories of epidemics. In
particular, each provides a quantitative measure of a parameter that helps to control the
evolution of an epidemic. However, they neither are intended to replace traditional epidemiological analysis, nor are they suitable for predicting the future, for example, in the
event that mitigation efforts are significantly modified.
