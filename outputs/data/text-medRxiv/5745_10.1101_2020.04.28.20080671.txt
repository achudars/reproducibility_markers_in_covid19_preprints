Abstract
The outbreak of COVID-19 might produce dramatic psychological effects on the
individuals’ life. In this study, we aimed to explore the elements that may reduce the
negative effects on mental health of the quarantine period imposed by most governments
during this worldwide crisis. We conducted an online survey to evaluate demographic,
lifestyle and mental health variables in the Portuguese population. We observed that factors
related with living conditions, maintaining the work either online or in the workplace,
frequency of exercise and absence of a previous psychological or physic disorders are
protective features of psychological well-being (anxiety, depression, stress and obsessivecompulsive symptoms). Finally, the individuals previously receiving psychotherapeutic
support exhibited better psychological indicators if they did not interrupt the process as a
consequence of the outbreak. Our results indicate that the practice of physical exercise,
reduced consumption of COVID-19 information and the implementation of remote mental
healthcare measures might prevent larger impacts on mental health during the COVID-19
outbreak.

1. Introduction
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has originated a worldwide
crisis with dramatic consequences for health, economy and society (Holmes et al., 2020).
Most governments are imposing quarantine periods, where the movements and contact
between people are restricted to reduce the propagation of the disease. While the use of
quarantine plays a critical role for the promotion of public health safety, it also has marked
negative effects. In such an unprecedent scenario for most of us, people are restricted of
maintaining contact with loved ones, their daily routines are dramatically changed, and their
working activities needs profound adjustments (Brooks et al., 2020). These factors together
with the uncertainty, distress and fear related to the progression of the disease are likely to
increase the psychological burden, including anxiety (Rubin and Wessely, 2020), acute
stress or depression (Brooks et al., 2020; Holmes et al., 2020). Furthermore, whereas the
absent of a quarantine can be even more detrimental to the psychological health (Hawryluck
et al., 2004), the results from previous investigations highlight that the psychological impact
of a quarantine is substantial and may subsist in the long-term (Brooks et al., 2020; Holmes
et al., 2020). As such, considering that the quarantine period is a necessary measure in
most countries to face the COVID-19 pandemic, it is of utmost relevance to understand how
we can minimize its negative psychological effects. In line with this, we conducted a crosssectional investigation to understand whether specific variables related with living conditions
during the quarantine period may have a protective role on mental health-being of the
Portuguese population. In Portugal, the first COVID-19 cases were confirmed on 2 March
2020 and the Portuguese government imposed the emergency state (quarantine and social
distancing measures) on 19 March 2020. Portugal has currently 23,392 confirmed and
231,737 suspected cases of COVID-19, with 1,277 recoveries and 880 deaths (25 April
2020; www.dgs.pt).

2. Experimental procedures
An online survey was conducted to comprehensively characterize a set of
demographic, social and mental health variables (Hawryluck et al., 2004) in a Portuguese
sample during the outbreak of COVID-19. The survey started to be applied on 23 March
2020, four days after the declaration of the emergency state by the Portuguese government.
Data was collected until the end of March. Participants were invited to collaborate
throughout institutional e-mail, social media and local and national online newspapers. Only
participants with 18 years old or more were included in the study. Ethical approval was
obtained from the Ethical Committee for Life Sciences of University of Minho (Braga,
Portugal). Electronic informed consent was obtained from all the participants in which study
goals were comprehensively explained. The study followed the Helsinki Declaration.
Demographic variables consisted of age (Age), gender (Gender) and years of
education (Education). The survey included the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale with
21 items (DASS-21) (Pais-ribeiro et al., 2004) to evaluate depression, anxiety and stress
symptoms experienced in the week before. Severe depression, anxiety and stress
symptoms correspond to subscale scores higher than 10, 7 and 12, respectively. The
Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory – Revised scale (OCI) (Foa et al., 2002) was also included
to measure obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms in the previous month. An OCI-R score
higher than 20 indicates the presence of OC disorder. The health status was also
characterized regarding the existence of a previous diagnosis of physical (PhysicalDisorder)
or psychological (PhychDisorder) conditions, and whether the participants were receiving
mental health support (MentalSupport). Questions pertaining to living conditions were also
included: the existence of outdoor green spaces (Garden), number of individuals sharing the
property (Housemates), and the presence of pets (Pets). Participants also indicated their
current work status: whether they were working at the regular workplace (WorkRegular),
teleworking (WorkOnline), or not working (NoWork). A set of questions was also included to
characterize the frequency of daily activities, namely the number of hours doing exercise
(Exercise) and consuming information related to COVID-19 (MediaTime).
A sequence of multiple linear regression models was implemented to identify the
significant predictors of mental health variables (DASS-21 and OCI). Dummy variables were
created for the variables WorkStatus, Housemates, Garden and Pets. In addition,
dichotomous variables were defined for the variables Exercise and MediaTime (0 – less than
one hour per day; 1 – one or more hours per day). Finally, the models included variables
related with health status to characterize the effect of pre-existence of physical or
psychological conditions (PhysicalDisorder and PsychDisorder, respectively). The models
were adjusted for demographic variables (Gender, Age and Education). Statistical analysis
was implemented with R (version 3.6.1). The visualization of the regression models was
produced with the sjPlot package.

3. Results
A sample of 1280 individuals (79.8% females) with a mean ± standard deviation age
of 37.1±12.1 years and education 17.1±3.4 years participated in this study (Table 1). The
average scores for DASS-21 were: depression 3.7±4.0; anxiety 2.6±3.3; stress 6.1±4.4. The
mean OCI score was 10.3±9.1. Severe depression, anxiety and stress symptoms existed in
7.6%, 9.1% and 9.3% of the sample, respectively. Severe OC symptoms were present in
12.4% of the participants (Table 2).
The results from the linear regression models revealed a significant effect of Gender,
with female participants reporting higher anxiety and stress (β≥-.126); lower Age (β≥.124)
and lower Education (β≤-.083, for depression, anxiety and OC symptoms), associated with
higher psychological symptomatology. Housemates and Pets were not significant predictors
of the outcome variables, while the existence of a garden was related with lower depression

and stress (β≤-.055). Continuing to work (either remotely or in the workplace) was linked to
lower depressive symptoms and marginally associated with significantly lower OC levels
(β≤-.063). More Exercise (β≤-.062) and less MediaTime (β≥.145) were associated with
decreased symptom severity among the considered mental health variables. The presence
of previously diagnosed psychological (β≥.126) or physical disorders (β≥.078) was
associated with increased symptomatology for all variables. To further explore this finding, a
complementary analysis in a subset of individuals receiving psychotherapeutic (n=204)
revealed that the suspension of the therapeutic process during the pandemic (StopConsult)
was characterized by higher stress and anxiety (β=.162 and β=.140, respectively) (Figure 1
and Table 1).

4. Discussion
Our results provide elucidative insights about the predictors of mental health being
during the outbreak of COVID-19. Being male, active working, having a garden and
practicing regular physical exercise seem to be relevant during this particular period. On
contrary, higher periods of media consumptions seem to be related with poor mental health
indicators.
Previous studies reported an adverse effect on mental health for younger Chinese
participants (12 to 21 years) during COVID-19 outbreak, mostly students (Wang et al.,
2020). They proposed that their routine was severely impacted by COVID-19 in comparison
to older adults. Our results also point to a higher risk for younger individuals, despite the lack
of children and adolescents in our sample. Other authors have also demonstrated that
depression and anxiety levels were higher in individuals under 35 years of age (Huang and
Zhao, 2020). Anxiety has been demonstrated to increase with increased concerns about the
impact of the virus on economic and academic domains and decreased social support in
college students (Cao et al., 2020), further supporting our findings. However, past research
in China reported decreased distress in individuals under 18 years of age, but also
enhanced distress for adults with age between 18 and 30 years in line with our findings (Qiu
et al., 2020).
Our findings demonstrate that males are associated with less symptomatology. In
accordance with such findings, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), distress, anxiety and
depression symptoms were higher in Chinese women during the pandemic (Lai et al., 2020;
N. Liu et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020). Contrary to our results, higher education in Chinese
individuals was associated with increased distress during the effects of COVID-19 (Qiu et
al., 2020). These authors suggested that more educated people are more aware of their
health. However, previous literature supports our results (Bracke et al., 2014; Brooks et al.,
2020).
Our results agree with past research demonstrating that working at home or working
without restrictions when compared to not working was associated with better mental health,
life satisfaction and lower distress in Chinese individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic (S.
X. Zhang et al., 2020). On the other hand, healthcare workers presented elevated values of
insomnia/poor sleep quality, fear, anxiety, depression, and OC symptoms due to COVID-19
(Huang and Zhao, 2020; Lu et al., 2020; W.-R. Zhang et al., 2020). Thus, further analyses
should explore the effect of riskier job categories on mental health.
In line with our findings, recent reports demonstrated an association between
frequent social media exposure or access to COVID-19 information and increased levels of
depression and anxiety in the Chinese population during the COVID-19 pandemic (Gao et
al., 2020; Huang and Zhao, 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Worry feelings were also associated
with exposure to COVID-19 information in social media, television and journals in India (Roy
et al., 2020). The adoption of lifestyle changes such as increased resting, relaxing and
exercising time was associated with lower stress scores (Zhang and Ma, 2020). However,
groups with highly physically active individuals reported reduced life satisfaction. These

individuals might have been more affected by the confinement impositions in China (S. X.
Zhang et al., 2020). In Portugal, the population can go outside for short periods during the
emergency state for exercise and children outdoor activities. Thus, physical activity is only
limited by social distancing measures. Also in agreement to our results, gardening is related
to a positive impact on mental health because it involves more physical activity and better
access to healthy food (Al-Delaimy and Webb, 2017).
We did not find statistically significant effects regarding the number of housemates.
Previous authors point to a negative effect of living with families in depression scores (W.-R.
Zhang et al., 2020) and increased PTS while living with more housemates (Wang et al.,
2020) during the pandemic in China. However, other authors reported a beneficial effect for
anxiety of living with parents in Chinese college students during the outbreak (Cao et al.,
2020). Herein, we did not discriminate the housemates belonging to the family. Thus, future
analyses should investigate in more detail the housemates’ characteristics (e.g. age range,
relationships and infection vulnerability). Living with people more susceptible to be infected
(Cao et al., 2020; N. Liu et al., 2020) or taking care of younger or elderly family members
while working remotely might have an impact on mental health.
Moreover, Chinese individuals with non-psychiatric diseases had higher risk for
insomnia, depression, and OC symptoms during the pandemic (W.-R. Zhang et al., 2020),
and chronic diseases were associated with reduced life satisfaction (S. X. Zhang et al.,
2020) and enhanced levels of PTS, anxiety, depression, and stress (Wang et al., 2020).
These results agree with our findings pointing to the diagnostic of a psychical/mental
disorder as a risk factor for mental health.
One point of particular interest for mental health providers relates with the negative
effects of the discontinuation of therapeutic processes on measures of acute psychological
symptomatology (Fiorillo and Gorwood, 2020; Yao et al., 2020). Past research focusing on
Chinese healthcare workers reported more mental disturbances for individuals with reduced
access to printed/online psychological help resources (Kang et al., 2020). While our results
should be interpreted with caution due to the cross-sectional design of this study and the
modest explained variance of the target variables (.07≤R2adj≤.12), they raise the need for the
adoption of strategies aimed to deliver psychological support throughout the use of remote
tools, including videoconference or other web-based technologies (Holmes et al., 2020; S.
Liu et al., 2020). Throughout the use of such approaches, the negative effects of a
quarantine on psychological well-being can be ameliorated.
The only longitudinal study assessing mental health parameters during the pandemic
in China did not report changes in anxiety, depression and stress scores (DASS-21), but
demonstrated a statistically significant but clinically meaningless decrease in PTS values.
Indeed, the PTS score in the two timepoints was above the cut-off value. Augmented
washing and avoidance behaviors in face of putative contamination was associated with
decreased PTS and DASS-21 scores (Wang et al., 2020). The authors suggested that the
implementation of lockdown and public health measures might explain these outcomes
because they might have increased the population confidence and safety feelings (Qiu et al.,
2020). The prevalence of depression, anxiety and impulsivity disorders in Portugal in 2014
was 7.9%, 16.5% and 3.5% respectively (www.dgs.pt). OC disorder has a prevalence of 23% (Stein et al., 2019). Our results of severe OC symptoms in 12.4% of the sample might
indicate an increase in OC symptoms during the pandemic, but this need to be confirmed by
longitudinal analyses. It is important to study the evolution of OC symptoms over time to
prevent higher incidence of OC disorder during and after the pandemic (Holmes et al.,
2020). Indeed, some studies suggest negative psychological effects months or years after
quarantine (Brooks et al., 2020).
Our results are limited by the cross-sectional design. Additionally, our sample is
younger and has more proportion of women than the average Portuguese population
(www.ine.pt) and does not include children and adolescents.
Nonetheless, our findings agree with a recent review of previous quarantine periods
unrelated to COVID-19 (Brooks et al., 2020) and replicate the major results in the Chinese
population for preventive factors of mental health during COVID-19 outbreak: (1)

demographic (male gender, older age and higher education); (2) lifestyle (active working,
more exercise, use of green spaces, and less exposure to COVID-19 information); (3)
clinical (absence of physical/mental health disorders and continuity of mental healthcare).
These outcomes align with recent recommendations to protect mental health during the
pandemic and prevent long-term effects (Fiorillo and Gorwood, 2020; Holmes et al., 2020).
