Abstract
Introduction
The risks to surgeons of carrying out aerosol generating procedures during the COVID pandemic are
unknown. To start to define these risks, in a systematic manner, we investigated the presence of
SARS-CoV-2 virus in the abdominal fluid and lower genital tract of patients undergoing surgery.

Methods
We carried out a prospective cross sectional observational study of 113 patients undergoing
abdominal surgery or instrumentation of the lower genital tract. We took COVID swabs from the
peritoneal cavity and from the vagina from all eligible patients. Results were stratified by pre
operative COVID status.

Results
In patients who were presumed COVID negative at the time of surgery SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA was
detected in 0/102 peritoneal samples and 0/98 vaginal samples. Peritoneal and vaginal swabs were
also negative in one patient who had a positive nasopharyngeal swab immediately prior to surgery.

Conclusions
The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the abdominal fluid or lower genital tract of presumed negative
patients is nil or extremely low. These data will inform surgeons of the risks of restarting
laparoscopic surgery at a time when COVID19 is endemic in the population.

Introduction
As health services around the world emerge from the first wave of COVID 19 infections the ability to
resume normal work patterns becomes of paramount importance. Surgeons in particular need to be
able to deliver effective and safe treatments to patients and reduce the inevitable backlogs that
have developed.

Laparoscopy and other surgical procedures such as colposcopy and hysteroscopy are essential parts
of the management of cancer patients with laparoscopy being associated with reduced hospital stay
and reduced complication rates compared to open surgery [1].

However the safety of these procedures, which are known to be aerosol generating, is unclear, thus
leading to a profusion of conflicting guidance (reviewed in [2]). Although the presence of other
viruses, including Hepatitis B virus, has been confirmed in laparoscopic aerosols [3] evidence for the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus is mixed [4] and has not been studied systematically.

The first step in such a process is to determine the risk of undertaking minimal access surgery in a
low risk patient. Here we describe a prospective study to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
virus in peritoneal fluid, a prerequisite for the presence of viral particles in laparoscopic aerosol or
surgical plume, and the lower genital tract.

Methods
Study population
Patients were enrolled into the study at Saint Mary’s Hospital, Manchester Royal Infirmary and
Wythenshawe Hospital, all part of Manchester University Foundation NHS Trust, between 7

th

and 29

th

June

July, 2020. The study was registered with the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)

register of COVID related trials. Ethical approval was obtained from Frenchay Research Ethics
Committee (20/SW/0088) and informed written consent obtained from all patients prior to the
collection of swabs and data. The study was sponsored by Manchester University NHS Foundation
Trust.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Patients were eligible if they were undergoing abdominal surgery including laparoscopy, laparotomy
and caesarean section, or undergoing instrumentation of the lower genital tract including but not
limited to colposcopy, hysteroscopy and insertion of intra uterine device. All patients had a
nasopharyngeal COVID swab taken within 48 hours of the procedure.

Patients were excluded if there was evidence of faecal or amniotic contamination of the peritoneal
cavity prior to the swab being taken

Study procedures
Where applicable patients had one or both of the following samples collected.

A vaginal COVID swab was taken from all four vaginal fornices, prior to any vaginal prep,
catheterisation or vaginal instrumentation

An abdominal COVID swab was taken as soon as the abdominal cavity was opened. The swab was
taken from the pelvis and the paracolic gutters. For laparoscopic cases, the swab was inserted
through a 5mm operating port, manipulated using laparoscopic forceps to ensure it was applied
firmly to peritoneal surfaces and then removed immediately through the laparoscopic port.

Samples were collected in viral transport medium and tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using

the Cobas® SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay

(Roche, USA).

Clinical Risk Groups
For the purposes of analysis patients were classified into the three risk groups defined by NHS
England [5]. Many UK centres have adopted these risk groupings as a mechanism for cohorting
patients within hospitals. For this study the three groups were therefore defined as:

Green (COVID-clear). Patients who self isolate for 14 days prior to admission, undergo negative
nasopharyngeal swab within 48 hours of admission (and in the case of patients being admitted to
level 2 and 3 care also undergo negative chest imaging) and are treated by teams of clinicians only
caring for “green” patients.

Amber (undifferentiated). Patients who have not self isolated but are asymptomatic at time of
admission, undergo nasopharyngeal testing within 4 hours of admission or have suspicious but not
diagnostic chest radiological findings.

Blue (COVID-positive). Patients who have had positive COVID nasopharyngeal testing, or who have
symptoms or radiological findings in keeping with current acute infection.

Clinical COVID testing
All patients recruited underwent standard screening for active COVID-19 infection using combined
nose and throat swabs, tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR.

Whilst the study was recruiting SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing became available for some patients and
these results, where available, were collected from the patient record along with other clinical
details.

Population infection rates estimation
Estimates of the incidence of COVID positivity during the study were derived from UK government
websites.

Sample size and statistical analysis
As this was an observational study a formal power calculation was not possible. The number to be
recruited was therefore estimated using a Bayesian approach. The number needed for the study was
defined as the number needed to convince a majority of clinicians that the rate of COVID positivity in
a particular cohort is sufficiently low that the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks.

Polling a panel of surgeons revealed that a rate of 0/100 for any particular risk group would be
sufficiently low risk to convince surgeons that this was a safe procedure. A total number of 100 cases
was therefore selected for the study.

Data were analysed using MS Excel.

Data are reported in line with STROBE guidance for the reporting of cross sectional observational
studies [6].

Results
A total of 113 patients were recruited, of whom 102 and 98 had a peritoneal and/or vaginal swab
taken respectively. Only 1/113 patients had a positive nasopharyngeal swab prior to surgery. This
patient was asymptomatic at the time of admission for elective caesarean section, underwent the
procedure as planned, and has remained well in the post operative period.

Peritoneal swab cohort
Peritoneal sampling was carried out in 102 patients at the time of surgery. Clinical characteristics of
this cohort are shown in table 1. Of note, during the study period there was only one patient
undergoing surgery who had evidence of acute infection (blue risk). 78 were managed as amber risk
and 23 as green risk. 4/31 (13%) of this cohort who underwent testing showed evidence of SARSCoV-2 antibody suggesting previous infection.

0/65 peritoneal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA. This included the one patient who
had a positive nasopharyngeal swab immediately prior to caesarean section.

Vaginal swab cohort
Vaginal sampling was carried out in 98 patients at the time of surgery. Clinical characteristics of this
cohort are shown in table 2. Of note, during the study period there was only one patient undergoing
surgery who had evidence of acute infection (blue risk). 75 were managed as amber risk and 22 as
green risk. 4/32 (13%) of this cohort who underwent testing showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2
antibody suggesting previous infection.

0/98 vaginal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA. This included the one patient who had a
positive nasopharyngeal swab immediately prior to caesarean section.

Discussion
In this study we were unable to detect any SARS-CoV-2 RNA in either the abdominal cavity or the
vaginal fluids of a prospective series of over 100 patients undergoing surgery.

Specifically, the numbers of “green” (n=27) and “amber” (n=84) patients included here provides
reassurance that the risks in these two groups are extremely low and that surgery in patients who
have been tested preoperatively could be undertaken safely, including minimal access surgery as
appropriate.

It is also interesting that we were unable to detect virus in the 4/32 (13%) patients who had positive
antibody titres and the one patient who had active infection at the time of surgery. These numbers
remain too small to make strong recommendations but we will continue to recruit these subgroups
of patients for further study.

This study was carried out at a time when the community incidence rate of COVID infection was
estimated to be stable at 0.02% [7]. This rate of infection would seem to represent the ongoing
endemic rate which is likely to persist for at least a period of months.

Our study was weighted towards the inclusion of patients undergoing caesarean section as this is
currently the commonest abdominal operation being carried out in our institution. There is no
reason to suppose that this population is particularly different from the general surgical population.

This study has not included patients in whom there was faecal contamination of the abdominal
cavity at the time of surgery. Further studies are now underway to address this and also to assess
risk in asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID positive patients, and those who have positive
antibodies.

In summary we have demonstrated that undertaking abdominal and gynaecological surgery,
including laparoscopic surgery, in patients who have been COVID tested pre operatively, whether
they have been self isolating or not, must be considered a low risk procedure. These data will allow
surgeons, and their teams, to make informed decisions about returning to laparoscopic surgery, the
role of filtration devices, and the need for PPE in low risk patients who comprise the majority of
patients currently awaiting a surgical procedure.
