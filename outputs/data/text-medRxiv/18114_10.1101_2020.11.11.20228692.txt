Abstract
Stringent nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as lockdowns and border closures are not
currently recommended for pandemic influenza control. New Zealand used these NPIs to eliminate
coronavirus disease 2019 during its first wave. Using multiple surveillance systems, we observed
a parallel and unprecedented reduction of influenza and other respiratory viral infections in 2020.
This finding supports the use of these NPIs for controlling pandemic influenza and other severe
respiratory viral threats.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, declared by the World Health Organisation
(WHO) on 11 March 2020, reached New Zealand (NZ) on 28 February 2020. From 2 February
2020, NZ introduced progressive border restrictions and a 4-level alert system aiming to eliminate
COVID-19.1 Soon after the emergence of community transmission of COVID-19, the stringent
nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) of Level-4 (nationwide lockdown) were applied, lasting
from 25-March to 27-April-2020. These included: 1) blocking importation of the virus (border
closure to non-New Zealanders, and 14-day quarantine for returning travellers); 2) stamping out
transmission within NZ (widespread testing, isolating cases, contact tracing and quarantine of
exposed persons); 3) physical distancing measures (stay-at-home orders, cancelling all
gatherings, closing schools, non-essential businesses and all public venues, and restricting
domestic travel); 4) individual infection prevention and control measures (promoting hand hygiene
and cough etiquette, staying home with mild respiratory symptoms, and mask wearing if unwell);
and 5) communicating risk to the public and various stakeholders. The implementation of these
NPIs combined with public compliance effectively eliminated community transmission of COVID19 during the first wave (12-February to 13-May), achieving 101 consecutive days without
detection of community COVID-19 cases.2,3 Since this implementation, NZ has continued to apply
NPIs in various forms up until submission of this report.1
The effectiveness of NPIs in reducing viral transmission depends on transmission characteristics
of the virus.4 If a substantial proportion of transmission occurs before the onset of symptoms (i.e.
pre-symptomatic shedding) or during asymptomatic infection, the population impact of health
screening and case-patient isolation will be diminished.5 Influenza virus has a shorter serial interval
and earlier peak infectivity compared to SARS-CoV-2. Our recent publication also showed that up
to 32% of influenza virus infections in NZ are mild or asymptomatic, suggesting the likelihood of
substantial asymptomatic transmission.6 These characteristics led to the assumption that these
NPIs would be less successful in controlling influenza virus than coronaviruses,7 however, robust
field data are lacking. New Zealand’s use of stringent NPIs created a natural experiment enabling
an understanding of the impact of these NPIs on illnesses caused by influenza and other
respiratory viruses. This type of knowledge is valuable for informing pandemic influenza
preparedness and seasonal influenza planning for the northern hemisphere’s upcoming winter in
the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Here we describe the complete absence of the usual winter influenza virus epidemic and a
remarkable reduction of other respiratory viral infections in NZ during and after the implementation
of these stringent NPIs in 2020.

Results
Influenza activity in NZ during the winter of 2020 was very low as confirmed by multiple national
surveillance systems (Figure 1).
From May to September 2020, hospital-based severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance
(catchment population of 1 million people) showed very low SARI incidence rates, all below the
seasonal threshold defined by the reference period of 2015-2019 (F1-a). No influenza-associated
SARI were identified (F1-b).
The national sentinel general practice (GP)-based surveillance usually covers ~10% of the NZ
population and captures patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) attending medical consultations.
However, this patient flow was altered in 2020 as many patients with ILI were channelled to
COVID-specific testing centres where patients were predominantly only tested for SARS-CoV-2.
Additionally, the number of participating practices were 18-57% lower than the usual participation
rate over the surveillance period. The ILI incidence rates were below the seasonal threshold
compared to the reference period (F1-c). No influenza-associated ILI were detected (F1-d).
Independently, the low ILI incidence rates were also observed in the HealthStat GP-based ILI
surveillance system (Supplementary Figure 1).
SHIVERS-II & III (the second and third iterations of the Southern Hemisphere Influenza and
Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance programme) are two community-based cohorts
that follow ~1400 adults aged 20-69 years and ~80 infants in the Wellington region, respectively.
Active surveillance for both cohorts in 2020 included swabbing of participants meeting the case
definition for ILI and/or acute respiratory illness (ARI). The ILI incidence rate in 2020 was lower
than the previous years of 2019 and 2018, however, ARI incidence was high (F1-e). No influenzaassociated ILI or ARI were identified (F1-f).
The national International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-coded (ICD-10AM-VI code J9-J11)
influenza hospitalisations for all NZ public hospitals showed a significant decline (F1-g). From 1January to 31-July-2020, a total of 291 influenza hospitalisations were coded: pre-lockdown 238
(81.8%); lockdown 33 (11.3%); and post-lockdown 15 (5.2%). The Cochran–Armitage test showed
a significant downward trend (p<0.001) in influenza hospitalisations.
The laboratory-based surveillance system includes testing samples ordered by clinicians during
routine clinical diagnostic processes for hospital inpatients and outpatients (serving ~70% of the
NZ population). Additionally, this system also includes testing samples from all influenza
surveillance systems (F1-h). During the COVID-19 laboratory response, some labs may have
prioritised testing for SARS-CoV-2 over influenza and other respiratory viruses. From 1-January to

27-September-2020, there were 500 influenza virus detections: pre-lockdown 474 (94.8%);
lockdown 20 (4.0%); and post-lockdown 6 (1.2%). The Cochran–Armitage test showed a
significant downward temporal trend (p<0.001) in influenza virus detections.

Table 1 shows the number of respiratory viruses detected and the proportional reduction for each
virus in 2020 (versus the reference period of 2015-2019) before, during and after the lockdown.
Dramatic reductions were observed for influenza virus compared with the reference period: 67.7%
reduction during and 99.9% after the lockdown. Marked reductions were also evident for other
respiratory viruses during post-lockdown compared with the reference period (for temporal
distribution, see supplementary Figure 2): respiratory syncytial virus (98.0% reduction), human
metapneumovirus (92.2%), enterovirus (82.2%), adenovirus (81.4%), parainfluenza virus types 1-3
(80.1%), and rhinovirus (74.6%). During post-lockdown when the restrictions were eased to Level1, we observed a significant increase in the proportion of rhinovirus compared to the median rate
for this period from the preceding period: 33% (175/529) from 8-June to 11-August vs 4.8%
(10/209) from 13-May to 7-June (p<0.0001). The rhinovirus-associated incidence rates in 2020
among SHIVERS-II&III and SARI surveillance also increased after the ease of restrictions
(Supplementary Figure 3).

Discussion
New Zealand, a southern hemisphere country with a temperate climate, has a well-established
influenza circulation pattern with peak incidences in the winter months.8-10 Multiple surveillance
systems showed that there was no annual laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreak or epidemic
detected during the 2020 winter season. Remarkably, influenza virus circulation was almost nonexistent during the 2020 winter, a 99.9% reduction compared with previous years. We postulate
that NZ’s use of stringent NPIs (lockdowns and border controls) have markedly changed human
behaviour, resulting in substantial reductions in contacts between influenza-infected individuals
and influenza-susceptible individuals. The nationwide lockdown occurred during late autumn
before the usual influenza season. This timing may also be important as the resulting small
number of influenza-infected individuals did not appear sufficient to trigger a sustained influenza
epidemic in the oncoming winter, in a setting of strict border control, personal hygiene promotion
and ongoing forms of social distancing that remained in place after the lockdown.1

The WHO’s pandemic influenza intervention guidance does not recommend stringent NPIs when
pandemic influenza reaches sustained transmission in the general population because these NPIs
have been considered ineffective and impractical.5 However, the knowledge base used in
developing WHO guidance for influenza pandemic prevention is limited and consists primarily of

historical observations and modelling studies. In light of these data presented from NZ, previous
experiences from Hong Kong during the 2003 SARS epidemic,11 and the COVID-19 pandemic,12
we suggest it is important to re-evaluate the role of NPIs in mitigating or even eliminating severe
pandemic influenza. This knowledge may inform better preparedness for future influenza
pandemics and seasonal influenza control and other severe respiratory viral threats.

Other potential contributing factors for the reduction in influenza virus detections include influenza
vaccination, climatic changes and viral-viral interactions. The NZ National Immunisation Register
recorded ~22% influenza vaccine coverage in 2020 (35% more than recorded in the three months
after the start of funded influenza vaccinations in 2020 compared with 2019, personal
communication). Cold temperature promotes the ordering of lipids on the viral membrane which
increases the stability of the influenza virus particle.13 Winter 2020 was NZ’s warmest winter on
record. The nationwide average temperature was 9.6°C, 1.1°C above the 1981-2010 average.14
The warmer winter may reduce virus stability, contributing to lower influenza circulation.
Rhinovirus, the most prevalent virus after the lockdown, may protect individuals against influenza
virus infection. Interferon-stimulating immunity mediated by rhinovirus infection may make it
difficult for additional viruses such as influenza to become established in a population.15 Similar
observations were reported in Sweden and France during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic when lower
H1N1 influenza cases coincided with rhinovirus outbreaks.16,17
Stringent NPIs may contribute to the significant reduction of all other non-influenza respiratory viral
infections including RSV, hPMV, PIV1-3, adenovirus, enterovirus and rhinovirus. When the NPIs
were relaxed after lockdown, the incidence of rhinovirus increased rapidly, a trend not seen with
these other viruses. The mechanism behind this finding is unclear. High household transmission
rates of rhinovirus, particularly between those contacts and their rhinovirus-infected children,18
plus a high proportion of asymptomatic infections19 may have contributed to this observation.
In the incoming autumn and winter of 2020 and 2021, many northern hemisphere temperate
countries will have continuing COVID-19 circulation overlapping with the influenza season,
resulting in increased burden on already stretched health systems. NZ’s experience strongly
suggests that NPIs can greatly reduce the intensity of seasonal influenza and other respiratory
viral infections. Continuation or strengthening of NPIs may, therefore, have positive impacts far
beyond COVID-19 control. Even without these interventions, the severity of the 2020-2021
northern hemisphere influenza season remains uncertain. Both international and domestic air
travel has been suggested as important drivers of influenza introduction and subsequent spread.20
It is possible that fewer seeding events from NZ and other southern hemisphere countries, from
both reduced influenza activity and reduced air travel, may result in low influenza activity in these
northern hemisphere countries during their incoming winter.

Our study has several limitations. Firstly, this is an observational study. Multiple simultaneous
measures were applied depending on alert levels, making it difficult to understand the relative
contribution of each of these measures. Secondly, during the COVID-19 laboratory response,
some laboratories prioritised testing for COVID-19 and reduced testing for influenza and other
respiratory viruses. Additionally, those samples ordered by clinicians for hospital inpatients and
outpatients during normal clinical practices were based on clinician’s judgement, rather than a
systematic sampling approach. This may result in selection bias. Thirdly, the government set up a
number of community-based testing centres around the country to provide access to safe and free
sampling for COVID-19. The usual flow and processes established for sentinel general practice
based influenza-like illness surveillance may have been interrupted as many ILI patients would
visit these centres instead of sentinel GP clinics. Additionally, national sentinel GP-based ILI
surveillance requires swabbing from an ILI patient. This may contribute to the lower GP
participation for this surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors probably resulted
in lower consultation and reporting and sample collection for sentinel ILI surveillance in 2020.
However, the SARI surveillance system and SHIVERS-II&III cohorts operated as usual and
showed the same apparent elimination of influenza virus circulation.

In conclusion, this observational study reported an unprecedented reduction in influenza and other
important respiratory viral infections and the complete absence of an annual winter influenza
epidemic, most likely due to the use of stringent nonpharmaceutical interventions (border
restrictions, isolation and quarantine, social distancing and human behaviour changes). The data
can inform future pandemic influenza preparedness and seasonal influenza planning for the
northern hemisphere’s upcoming winter.

Methods
Ethical approval
Ethical approval was obtained for the SHIVERS (including SARI and ILI surveillance), SHIVERS-II
and III cohort studies from the NZ Northern A Health and Disability Ethics Committee
(NTX/11/11/102). The ICD-coded influenza hospitalisation data and laboratory-based respiratory
virus surveillance data are part of public health surveillance in NZ. It is conducted in accordance
with the Public Health Act and thus ethics committee approval was not needed for collection or
use of these data.
Hospital-based severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance
The population-based hospital surveillance for severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) among
residents (ca ~1 million) of Central (Auckland District Health Board) and South (Counties Manukau
District Health Board) Auckland was established in 2012.21 Research nurses reviewed daily
records of all overnight acutely admitted inpatients to identify any inpatient with a suspected acute
respiratory illness (ARI). They enrolled those patients with cough and history of fever (subjective
fever or measured temperature ≥38°C) and onset within the past 10 days, defined by the World
Health Organisation as SARI. A respiratory specimen (nasopharyngeal or nasal or throat swab)
was collected and tested simultaneously for influenza and other respiratory viruses by real-time
reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques:22 influenza virus,
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1-3, enterovirus,
adenovirus, human metapneumovirus.

Sentinel general practice-based influenza like-illness (ILI) surveillance
The population-based surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) among persons enrolled in sentinel
general practices (~90) who seek medical consultations has been in operation since 1990,8 usually
covering ~10% of the NZ population. The participating general practitioners and practice nurses
assessed all consultation seeking patients. If a patient met the influenza-like illness (ILI) case
definition: “an acute respiratory illness with a history of fever or measured fever of ≥38°C, and cough,
and onset within the past 10 days, and requiring consultation in that general practice”, a respiratory
specimen (nasopharyngeal or nasal or throat swab) was collected to test for influenza and other
respiratory viruses.21 In 2020, sentinel general practice-based ILI surveillance was not operated in a
usual way due to the COVID-19 response. Instead of visiting sentinel GPs for medical consultations,
many ILI patients would visit one of the community-based testing centres. Additionally, national
sentinel GP-based ILI surveillance requires swabbing from an ILI patient. This may contribute to less
GP participation (18-57% of the usual participation rate over the winter period in 2020) in the COVID19 pandemic situation. These factors would contribute to lower consultation, reporting and detection
of influenza and other respiratory viruses compared with previous years.

SHIVERS-II and WellKiwis cohort ILI surveillance
SHIVERS-II (the second iteration of the Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness
Research and Surveillance programme) is a prospective adult cohort study in Wellington, NZ. The
cohort study has been in operation since 2018 enrolling individuals aged 20-69 years, randomly
selected from those healthy individuals listed in the general practice’s primarycare management
system. In 2020, SHIVERS-II study staff followed these participants (~1400) and monitored their ILIs
and ARIs.

WellKiwis (i.e. SHIVERS-III) is a prospective Wellington infant cohort aiming to recruit 600 infantmother pairs from Oct 2019-Sept 2022 (200 pairs a year) and follow them until 2026. In 2020,
WellKiwis study staff followed up ~80 infants and monitored their ILIs and ARIs.

During May-September 2020, SHIVERS-II and WellKiwis study staff sent weekly surveys to
participants regarding their respiratory illness. Due to COVID-19, the ARI case definition in 2020 has
changed to: “acute respiratory illness with fever or feverishness and/or one of following symptoms
(cough, running nose, wheezing, sore throat, shortness of breath, loss of sense of smell/taste) with
onset in the past 10 days.” The case definition for ILI during 2018-2020 was the same: acute
respiratory illness with cough and fever/measured fever of ≥38C and onset within the past 10 days.
For those participants who met the case definition for ILI and ARI, research nurses visited the
participant and take a nasopharyngeal or nasal or throat swab to test for influenza and other
respiratory viruses and SARS-CoV-2.23
International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-coded influenza hospitalisations
Hospitalisation data for ICD-coded influenza hospitalisations (ICD-10AM-VI codes (J09-J11) were
extracted from the NZ Ministry of Health’s National Minimum Dataset by discharge date. In this
dataset, patients who spent less than one day in a hospital are excluded. Influenza-related
hospitalisations are conservatively taken to include only those cases where influenza was the
principal diagnosis. Repeat hospital admissions were included because infection with a different
influenza A sub-type or influenza B virus is possible.

Laboratory-based surveillance
The laboratory-based surveillance for influenza and common respiratory viruses is carried out allyear-around by the NZ virus laboratory network consisting of the WHO National Influenza Centre
(NIC) at ESR and six hospital laboratories in Auckland (2), Waikato, Wellington, Christchurch and
Dunedin. This laboratory network tests specimens ordered by clinicians for hospital inpatients and

outpatients during normal clinical practice (serving ~70% of the NZ population). Sample collection
is based on clinician’s judgement, rather than systematic sampling approach. This may result in
selection bias. In addition, this laboratory network conducts testing for public health surveillance
including SARI, ILI and SHIVERS-II and WellKiwis cohort surveillance.

Data analyses
Study data were captured using REDCap electronic data capture tools.24 Analyses were
performed in Stata 16.1 (StataCorp LLC).

The observed incidence rates of influenza-PCR-confirmed SARI or ILI or ARI were corrected each
week to account for missed swabs from ILI cases by applying the influenza positivity rate of those
tested to those non-tested (Corrected number of influenza-PCR-confirmed SARI or ILI or ARI
events = Number of SARI or ILI or ARI x Actual number of influenza-PCR-confirmed SARI or ILI or
ARI/Actual number of SARI or ILI or ARI swabs).

Based on SARI and ILI surveillance data from 2015-2019, the start of the annual influenza season
and intensity level of the influenza epidemics was defined by using the Moving Epidemid Method
(MEM).25-27 Briefly, MEM has three main steps: Step 1: for each season separately, the length of
the epidemic period is estimated as the minimum number of consecutive weeks with the maximum
accumulated percentage rates, splitting the season into three periods: a pre-epidemic, an
epidemic, and a post-epidemic period; Step 2: MEM calculates the epidemic threshold as the
upper limit of the 95% one-sided confidence interval of 30 highest pre-epidemic weekly rates, the
n highest for each season taking the whole training period, where n = 30/number of seasons; Step
3: medium, high, and extra-ordinary intensity thresholds were estimated as the upper limits of the
40%, 90%, and 97.5% one-sided confidence intervals of the geometric mean of 30 highest
epidemic weekly rates, the n highest for each season taking the whole training period, where n =
30/number of seasons. Five categories are used to set thresholds and define intensity level as no
activity or below epidemic threshold, low (0-40%), moderate (40-90%), high (90-97.5%) and extraordinary (>97.5%) one sided confidence interval of the geometric mean.

The Cochran–Armitage test for trend analysis was performed for ICD-coded influenza
hospitalisations and numbers of the reported virus detections.
Laboratory-based surveillance data and ICD-coded influenza hospitalisation data used the median
weekly value to represent the reference period of 2015-2019. Median and interquartile ranges
were calculated for the number of viruses reported during 2015-2019; Percentage of reduction = 1
- [No. virus (2020)/median no. virus (2015-2019)]%

Abbreviations: SARI (severe acute respiratory illness); GP (general practice); ILI (influenza-like illness); ARI (acute respiratory illness); SHIVERSII&III (The second and third iterations of the Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance programme);
ICD ( International Classification of Diseases); flu refers to influenza. The calculation for epidemic threshold and low influenza activitiy is described
in the Methods. A patient with cough and history of fever (subjective fever or measured temperature ≥38°C) and onset within the past 10 days
meets the SARI case definition if hospitalised or meets the ILI case defintion if consulting a GP or participating in the SHIVERS-II&III study. The ARI
case definition among SHIVERS-II&III participants refers to an “acute respiratory illness with fever or feverishness and/or one of following
symptoms (cough, running nose, wheezing, sore throat, shortness of breath, loss of sense of smell/taste) with onset in the past 10 days.”
