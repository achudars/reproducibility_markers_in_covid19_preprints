ABSTRACT

51
52

Background

53

COVID-19 has overloaded national health services worldwide. Thus, early identification

54

of patients at risk of poor outcomes is critical. Our objective was to analyse SARS-CoV-

55

2 RNA detection in serum as a severity biomarker in COVID-19.

56
57

Methods and Findings

58

Retrospective observational study including 193 patients admitted for COVID-19.

59

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum (CoVemia) was performed with samples

60

collected at 48-72 hours of admission by two techniques from Roche and Thermo Fischer

61

Scientific (TFS). Main outcome variables were mortality and need for ICU admission

62

during hospitalization for COVID-19.

63

CoVemia was detected in 50-60% of patients depending on technique. The correlation

64

of Ct in serum between both techniques was good (intraclass correlation coefficient:

65

0.612; p < 0.001). Patients with CoVemia were older (p = 0.006), had poorer baseline

66

oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2; p < 0.001), more severe lymphopenia (p < 0.001) and higher

67

LDH (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p = 0.021), C-reactive protein (CRP; p = 0.022) and procalcitonin (p

68

= 0.002) serum levels.

69

We defined "relevant CoVemia" when detection Ct was < 34 with Roche and < 31 for

70

TFS. These thresholds had 95% sensitivity and 35 % specificity. Relevant CoVemia

71

predicted death during hospitalization (OR 9.2 [3.8 - 22.6] for Roche, OR 10.3 [3.6 - 29.3]

72

for TFS; p < 0.001). Cox regression models, adjusted by age, sex and Charlson index,

73

identified increased LDH serum levels and relevant CoVemia (HR = 9.87 [4.13-23.57] for

TFS viremia and HR = 7.09 [3.3-14.82] for Roche viremia) as the best markers to predict

mortality.

Conclusions

78

CoVemia assessment at admission is the most useful biomarker for predicting mortality

79

in COVID-19 patients. CoVemia is highly reproducible with two different techniques (TFS

80

and Roche), has a good consistency with other severity biomarkers for COVID-19 and

81

better predictive accuracy.

AUTHOR SUMMARY

85

COVID-19 shows a very heterogeneous clinical picture. In addition, it has overloaded

86

national health services worldwide. Therefore, early identification of patients with

87

poor prognosis is critical to improve the use of limited health resources. In this work,

88

we evaluated whether baseline SARS-CoV2 RNA detection in blood (CoVemia) is

89

associated with worse outcomes. We studied almost 200 patients admitted to our

90

hospital and about 50-60% of them showed positive CoVemia. Patients with positive

91

CoVemia were older and had more severe disease; CoVemia was also more frequent in

92

patients requiring admission to the ICU. Moreover, we defined “relevant CoVemia”, as

93

the amount of viral load that better predicted mortality obtaining 95% sensitivity and

94

35% specificity. In addition, relevant CoVemia was a better predictor than other

95

biomarkers such as LDH, lymphocyte count, interleukin-6, and indexes used in ICU such

96

as qSOFA and CURB65.

97

In summary, detection of CoVemia is the best biomarker to predict death in COVID-19

98

patients. Furthermore, it is easy to be implemented and is reproducible with two

99

techniques (Roche and Thermo Fisher Scientific) that are currently used for diagnosis

100

in nasopharyngeal swabs samples.

INTRODUCTION

109

The wide spectrum of COVID-19 severity ranges from asymptomatic to critical cases,

110

albeit less than 10% of patients develop a severe disease [1]. Even though only a minority

111

of patients need hospitalization for COVID-19, the higher transmission rate of SARS-Cov-

112

2 compared to other viruses, the absence of previous immunity in the population, and

113

the high incidence of this disease in a short period of time are collapsing health care

114

systems worldwide [2]. One remaining challenge from COVID-19 is the difficulty of

115

predicting individual prognosis since determinants of disease severity remain unclear.

116

Previous studies have suggested that age, male sex, obesity, hypertension, and

117

underlying diseases like hematologic malignancies are associated with worse prognosis

118

[3–5]. Likewise, some blood biomarkers are able to predict the emergence of the

119

cytokine storm leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome, the most frequent cause

120

of clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients [6–8].

121
122

Despite the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for the upper respiratory tissue [9], the relevance of

123

its viral load in nasopharyngeal samples remains controversial [10]. However, several

124

authors have reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum or plasma samples

125

(henceforth CoVemia) associated with a worse prognosis, assessed as higher probability

126

of clinical deterioration, higher levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-5 or CXCL10, intensive care

127

unit (ICU) admission, critical disease and death [8,11–13].

128

detection of CoVemia with more sensitive techniques was not associated with mortality,

129

but with immune suppression status [14].

Notwithstanding, the

131

Therefore, we aimed to assess whether there is an association of CoVemia with COVID-

132

19 severity using two different real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain

133

reaction (rRT-PCR) techniques,and compare them with other suggested severity

134

biomarkers.

Depending on the technique, CoVemia was detected in 95 (48%; Roche) and 117 (59%;

156

TFS) patients; the correlation between Ct (Cycle threshold) in serum obtained with both

157

techniques was very good (r = 0.738 [0.667 - 0.795], p < 0.001), and detection by TFS

158

was more sensitive than by Roche (S1A Figure). The agreement to detect CoVemia was

159

75.5% and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.612 (p < 0.001). Conversely, the

160

correlation of Ct between nasopharyngeal and throat swab (NPTS) and serum samples

161

was weak either with TFS or Roche techniques (S1B and 1C Figure, respectively).

Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 viremia is higher in patients requiring ICU admission

188

In order to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19 severity and viremia we first

189

studied the relative frequency of CoVemia in patients who required ICU admission and

190

those who did not. As shown in Figure 1, viremia was significantly more frequent for

191

both techniques in patients requiring ICU (p < 0.001 for Roche and p = 0.002 for TFS).

192

Although TFS was more sensitive to detect CoVemia, it seemed to be less specific to

193

predict the need for ICU (OR 2.47 [95% CI: 1.37 - 4.47], p = 0.003 for TFS vs 3.04 [1.71 -

194

Additionally, we performed a multivariable logistic regression in order to determine

whether CoVemia can help predicting ICU admission compared to other variables. The

202

best model to predict the need for ICU admission included the following variables:

203

COPD, total lymphocyte count and PaO2/FiO2 at admission (Table 2). When we forced

204

CoVemia into this model, it did not reach statistical significance either when it was

205

assessed by Roche or by TFS (Table 2).

SARS-CoV-2 viremia predicts mortality in COVID-19 admitted patients

229

As it was previously suggested that CoVemia can be associated with a higher risk of

230

mortality, we also analyzed how both techniques predicted death during admission. TFS

231

was more sensitive than Roche’s technique but less specific either in the whole

232

population (OR 5.8 [2.6 - 13.3] for Roche and 3.3 [1.4 - 7.4] for TFS), or after stratification

233

by requirement of ICU (S2 Figure).

239

240
241

Therefore, we analyzed whether a threshold of CoVemia (as Ct) could help to better

242

predict mortality during hospitalization. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B the area under

243

ROC curves for Roche and TFS were quite similar (0.736 [0.642 - 0.829] vs 0.702 [0.603 -

244

0.801] respectively; p = 0.323). The best cut-off to predict mortality was 34 Ct for Roche

245

(sensitivity 91%, specificity 38%) and 31 Ct for TFS (sensitivity 93%, specificity 32%).

246

Using these cut-off points to define “relevant CoVemia”, the capability to predict

247

mortality improved with both techniques: OR 9.2 (3.8 - 22.6) for Roche and 10.3 (3.6 -

248

29.3) for TFS (Figures 2C and 2D, respectively).

249

In addition, Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed that those patients with “relevant CoVemia”

250

at admission survived less than those with non-relevant detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA

251

(Figures 2E and 2F), being slightly higher the incidence risk ratio for CoVemia determined

252

by TFS compared to Roche (IRR 4.1 [2.3 - 6.9] vs 2.4 [1.5 - 3.9] respectively).

19, we analyzed its association with clinical and laboratory parameters that have been

Finally, we analyzed the hazard ratio for mortality of CoVemia in comparison with all

these parameters. All models were adjusted by age and Charlson index, which

significantly affected survival of COVID-19 patients, as well as by sex, which did not

significantly affect survival. Baseline qSOFA and CURB65 showed the worst capability to

predict survival (Table 3, model 1). On the contrary, the best predictors always included

305

baseline “relevant CoVemia” and high LDH serum levels (Table 3, all models).

306

Interestingly, even when relevant CoVemia, and high LDH levels were included together

307

in model 4, both were able to independently predict survival, although the hazard ratio

was higher for the former (Table 3 last two columns; HR 9.87 [4.13 - 23.57] for TFS

DISCUSSION

322

Many efforts have been made since the first COVID-19 outbreak in China to identify poor

323

prognosis factors in this worldwide and evolving pandemic. Several biomarkers such as

324

low total lymphocyte count, high LDH serum levels, increased acute phase reactants (C-

325

reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, among others) or increased IL-6 serum levels have

326

been proposed [6,15]. Recently, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood has been

327

suggested as a potential severity biomarker [12,13,16–18]. In this regard, our results

328

reinforce these previous data with a main contribution to the management of COVID-

329

19: we have determined a semiquantitative threshold for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in

330

serum early after admission that allows establishing RNA values (“relevant CoVemia”)

331

associated with higher mortality risk. Furthermore, we have shown that, technically, this

332

finding is reproducible and, it is the most useful biomarker in the clinical setting for

333

predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients.

334
335

From a technical point of view, we were able to detect CoVemia with high accuracy and

336

concordance by using two commercially available kits, from Roche and TFS, as previously

337

described [19]. These kits had been previously approved for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in

338

nasopharyngeal samples. Although the sensitivity of TFS technology was slightly better

339

for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in serum, this difference disappeared when the specific
19

340

Ct cut-offs for each kit were applied to define relevant CoVemia. These results support

341

the notion that the CoVemia detection can be highly reproducible since the Roche and

342

TFS technologies are based on different procedures for RNA extraction and

343

retrotranscription, as well as different genes for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Furthermore,

344

our results validate previous reports that used the Roche kit and an “in-house” kit for

345

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection [12,13].

346
347

From a clinical point of view, we have shown that CoVemia has a high consistence as a

348

severity biomarker in COVID-19, since it correlates with several variables that have been

349

proposed to be associated with poor evolution in COVID-19, namely old age,

350

comorbidity, qSOFA and CURB-65, as well as with laboratory markers such as high IL-6

351

or LDH serum levels and severe lymphopenia. Furthermore, multivariable Cox regression

352

analysis identified high LDH serum levels and relevant CoVemia as independent and solid

353

predictors for mortality after adjusting by age, sex, and presence of comorbidity. Neither

354

qSOFA, CURB-65, low total lymphocyte count, nor high IL-6 serum levels maintained

355

statistically significant association with mortality. Therefore, presence of relevant

356

CoVemia was proved to be the best mortality predictor in our population since it

357

provides a hazard ratio three times higher than that of the other significant variable,

358

high LDH serum level.

359
360

Certain immunological mechanisms may underlie some of these associations. First, it is

361

tempting to suggest that a decrease in activity or number of immune cells involved in

362

lysis of infected cells may lead to higher viral replication and viral spread in the blood. In

363

this regard, the correlation between IL-6 levels and CoVemia levels could be related with

364

the recent description of lower cytotoxic potential of NK cells and senescence of CD8+ T

365

lymphocytes associated to high IL-6 levels, which can be restored by tocilizumab

366

treatment [20]. Second, association between lymphopenia and CoVemia could be

367

related with lymphocyte viral infection and cellular lysis by cytotoxic cells. However,

368

lymphopenia is more likely to be related with increased cellular migration into the lungs,

369

as we have recently described for dendritic cells [21].

370
371

Strengths of our research include: immediacy of results during the emergency situation

372

of the COVID-19 first wave, sufficient sample size (n = 193), fulfillment of STROBE

373

standards for observational research, and a multifaceted view of patients including

374

Immunology, Microbiology and many clinical assessments. However, this study has

375

some limitations. Firstly, a single-center and retrospective design and, therefore,

376

variability on the day of sample extraction. Nevertheless, the average time from

377

beginning of symptoms to sample extraction (median of two days) was equal in patients

378

with positive and negative CoVemia. Secondly, the moderate specificity of relevant

379

CoVemia at admission to predict mortality. This finding could be associated to the

380

variability over time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in serum in COVID-19 patients [22].

381

Because of this variability, CoVemia detection at a specific time point may not properly

382

reflect the state of viral infection, thereby influencing the assessment of severity

383

outcomes. This could explain why previous descriptions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection

384

in blood provided heterogeneous information on its value as severity biomarker

385

[13,14,17]. Therefore, sequential assessment of CoVemia may be needed to improve its

386

specificity to predict mortality. Last but not least, our findings are restricted to the so-

387

called “first wave”, when an overloaded health system could not cover all the needs to

provide critical care in some severity ill patients. Although the results are solid, studies

389

in new waves experienced elsewhere are needed to validate their utility throughout the

390

pandemic.

391
392

In summary, the study presented here has established the usefulness of SARS-CoV-2

393

RNA detection in blood in the initial assessment of patients admitted for COVID-19 due

394

to its capability to predict mortality. This assessment would be easily implemented since

395

it is reproducible, regardless of the commercially available kit used for SARS-CoV-2 RNA

396

detection. Accordingly, information from tests widely used for diagnosis could be readily

397

used for prognosis evaluation. However, the need for quantitative standardization of

398

relevant CoVemia and evaluation of the meaning of persistent CoVemia must be

399

addressed in further longitudinal studies.

Study inclusion criteria were: a) patients with confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA

410

in nasopharyngeal and throat swabs (NPTS), and b) availability of serum samples at the

411

Microbiology Department for additional measurement of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood.

412

Regarding the last criterion, on average, serum samples were obtained at a median of

413

two days from admission (interquartile range [IQR] 1 to 3) which nearly corresponded

414

to one week after the beginning of symptoms (median: 8 days, IQR: 6 to 11).

415
416

Clinical, laboratory and therapeutic data were collected from electronic clinical records

417

and included in an anonymized database as previously described [6]. Baseline clinical

418

data refer to those obtained at admission day and baseline laboratory data refer to one

419

to three days from admission date.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection

422

Nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples were obtained and real-time reverse-

423

transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was performed with LightCycler®

424

Multiplex Virus Master (Roche Diagnostics, USA) using the LightMix® Modular SARS and

425

Wuhan CoV E-gene primers (Roche Diagnostics, USA), targeting the e gene as a first-line

426

screening, followed by confirmatory testing with TaqPath™ COVID-19 CE-IVD Kit RT-PCR

427

(Applied Biosystems™, USA) which detects three specific SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions:

428

orf-1ab, s, and n genes. Both procedures were performed according to manufacturers’

429

directions on a Quant Studio-5 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems™, USA) and

430

amplification curves were analyzed with QuantStudio™ Design and Analysis software

431

(Applied Biosystems, USA), for their interpretation by a clinical microbiologist.

432
433

To evaluate CoVemia, we used 400 µL of surplus sera from routine HIV and hepatitis

434

serology assessment that are usually frozen at -20 ºC for internal quality controls. Serum

435

samples were treated previously for virus inactivation and then tested with two rRT-PCR

436

methods: cobas® SARS-COV-2 test (Roche Diagnostics, USA), a qualitative assay for

437

detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and TaqPath™ COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR Kit (Thermo

438

Fisher Scientific [TFS], USA), a multiplex RT-PCR assay for qualitative detection of SARS-

439

CoV-2 nucleic acids, as previously described [19]. The number of amplification cycles

440

needed for the fluorescence signal to cross the threshold (Ct) was recorded. Briefly:

441

a) Roche test detects a fragment of the orf-1ab region, specific of SARS-COV-2; and a

442

conserved region of e gene, a structural envelope gene, for pan-sarbecovirus detection.

443

Test was performed by cobas® 6800 System (Roche Diagnostics, USA); an automatic

444

platform for nucleic acid extraction and RT-PCR amplification and detection. Serum

445

samples were processed according to manufacturer’s indications, following the same

446

protocol used for SARS-CoV-2 detection in respiratory samples. Results were analyzed

447

and interpreted automatically by the cobas® 6800/8800 Software version 1.02.12.1002.

448

B) TFS test detects three specific SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions: orf-1ab, s, and n genes.

449

This technique requires a previous nucleic acid extraction from the sample, which was

450

performed by the automatic eMAG® Nucleic Acid Extraction System (Biomerieux,

451

France), a validated system for the extraction of nucleic acids from serum and plasma

452

samples. Extraction was carried out according to eMAG® manufacturer’s directions,

453

obtaining purified nucleic acids in 60 µL of elution buffer. Assay was performed using 5

454

µL of the eluted and according to the manufacturer’s instructions, by a QuantStudio™ 5

455

Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). Amplification curves were analyzed

456

with QuantStudio™ Design and Analysis software version 2.4.3 (Applied Biosystems,

457

USA). Interpretation of results was carried out by a clinical microbiologist, through

458

amplification curve analysis.

459
460

IL-6 serum level measurement

461

IL-6 serum levels were quantified in duplicate with the Human IL-6 Quantikine high

462

sensitivity enzyme-immune assay from R&D Systems Europe Ltd. (Abingdon, UK), as

463

described previously [6].

464

Variables

465

We used two different variables to evaluate CoVemia: a) dichotomic variable: CoVemia

466

was considered positive when at least one of the genes studied was positive according

467

to the output of the two systems used; and b) quantitative variable: when more than

468

one gene target was detected by one test, the mean Ct value of amplified genes was

469

calculated. There was a high consistency among the results of the three genes analyzed

470

with TFS and a slightly lower one for the two genes analyzed in the Roche system [19].

471

Since none of the two systems (Roche and TFS) provided positive results with Ct > 40,

472

by consensus decision, we assigned Ct = 42 to those samples reported as negative (for

473

all the genes) by the system.

474
475

Baseline IL-6 levels were considered high if > 30 pg/ml, according to their sensitivity and

476

specificity to predict severity determined in a previous study [6]. In addition, in order to

477

be able to compare different biomarkers, other continuous variables previously

478

described as COVID-19 severity biomarkers were also transformed into dichotomic

479

variables considering as cut-off point their median values in our population, namely:

480

total lymphocyte count was considered low when < 700 cells/mm3, lactate

481

dehydrogenase (LDH) serum level was considered high when > 400 U/L, qSOFA and

482

CURB65 were considered high if > 1. Patients were considered elderly if age > 70 years.

483
484

Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome was considered when at least two organs reached a

485

score > 1 in SOFA scale [23]. Multiorgan failure was considered when at least two organs

486

reached a score > 3 in SOFA scale [24].

487
488

To analyze whether CoVemia could predict disease severity, two main outcomes were

489

considered: need for ICU admission and all-cause in-hospital mortality. Only 14 patients

490

out of 89 admitted to ICU did not require invasive mechanical ventilation.

492

Statistical analysis

493

Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14 for Windows (Stata Corp LP, College

494

Station, TX, USA). Quantitative variables following a non-normal distribution were

495

represented as median and IQR, and the Mann Whitney test was used to assess

496

significant differences. Variables with a normal distribution were described by mean ±

497

standard deviation (SD) and differences between groups were assessed with Student’s

498

t-test. Qualitative variables were described as counts and proportions and Chi square or

499

Fisher´s exact test was used for comparisons. Correlation between quantitative

500

variables was analyzed using the Pearson correlation test. To estimate the 95%

501

confidence interval (CI) of correlation coefficients we used the ci2 command of Stata.

502

To evaluate the agreement between CoVemia assessed by Roche and TFS we estimated

503

the intraclass correlation with the icc command of R.

504
505

To determine the variables associated with the need for ICU admission, we performed

506

a multivariable logistic regression analysis that was first modeled by adding all the

507

variables with a p-value lower than 0.15 to the bivariable analysis, namely low

508

lymphocyte count, D-dimer, high LDH, low PaO2/FiO2 (< 250), COPD, high qSOFA, high

509

CURB65, hypertension, C-reactive protein, and high IL-6 level. The final model was

510

reached through backward stepwise removal of variables with p-value higher than 0.15

511

and using Wald tests to demonstrate that each model was better than its previous

512

iteration. Once the final model was obtained, the dichotomic variables CoVemia (both

513

Roche and TFS) were forced into the model in order to determine whether they were

514

able to predict the need for ICU admission.

515
516

Odds ratio (OR) for mortality according to the presence of CoVemia was estimated for

517

both systems with the cs command of Stata. Since differences between the two

518

techniques were detected in the sensitivity to detect viremia and the capability of

519

predicting mortality, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed

520

using the roctab command in order to estimate the best cut-off point for each system.

521

Cut-off values for relevant CoVemia were selected based on the best trade-off values

522

between sensitivity, specificity and the percentage of patients correctly classified.

523

Survival time was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method with the sts command of Stata.

524

Date of admission was considered the date of entry, and for exit date we considered the

525

date of death. For those patients without this event, the last revision of the database

526

(electronic chart or telephone call) on May 21st was used to censor their follow-up.

527

Differences in time to death between different variables were analyzed by log-rank test.

528
529

To compare the predictive capability of baseline CoVemia with that of other baseline

530

parameters (qSOFA, CURB65, total lymphocyte count, LDH and IL-6 serum levels)

531

described in previous publications [12,13,25] we fitted different Cox regression models.

532

In the first model after adjustment by age, sex and Charlson comorbidity index, the

533

hazard ratio (HR) for all other variables including relevant viremia by TFS or Roche was

534

estimated. Since qSOFA and CURB65 did not reach a p-value < 0.15, they were excluded

535

from the analysis in the subsequent models. Model 2 was adjusted by the same variables

536

included in model 1 and low lymphocyte count, the hazard ratio for the remaining

537

variables was then estimated. Model 3 and 4 were developed as model 2 but

538

substituting low lymphocyte count by high IL-6 and high LDH, respectively.
