Abstract:

55

Background: In the emergency of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, great efforts were made to quickly

56

provide serology testing to the medical community however, these methods have been introduced into

57

clinical practice without the complete validation usually required by the regulatory organizations.

58

Methods: SARS-CoV-2 patient samples (n=43) were analysed alongside pre-pandemic control specimen

59

(n=50), confirmed respiratory infections (n=50), inflammatory polyarthritis (n=22) and positive for

60

thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (n=30). Imprecision, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and

61

concordance were evaluated on IgG serologic assays from EuroImmun, Epitope Diagnostics (EDI),

62

Abbott Diagnostics and DiaSorin and a rapid IgG/IgM test from Healgen.

63

Results: EDI and EuroImmun imprecision was 0.02-14.0% CV. Abbott and DiaSorin imprecision (CV)

64

ranged from 5.2% - 8.1% and 8.2% - 9.6% respectively. Diagnostic sensitivity of the assays were 100%

65

(CI: 80-100%) for Abbott, EDI and EuroImmun and 95% (CI: 73-100%) for DiaSorin at ≥14 days post

66

PCR. Only the Abbott assay had a diagnostic specificity of 100% (CI: 91-100%). EuroImmun cross-

67

reacted in 3 non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections and 2 controls. The DiaSorin displayed more false

68

negative results and cross-reacted in six cases across all conditions tested. EDI had one cross-reactive

69

sample. The Healgen rapid test showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. Overall, concordance of the

70

assays ranged from 76.1% to 97.9%.

71

Conclusions: Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 showed good analytical performance. The head-to-head

72

analysis of samples revealed differences in results that may be linked to the use of nucleocapsid or spike

73

proteins. The point of care device tested demonstrated adequate performance for antibody detection.

Introduction

77

The scientific community has had to rapidly develop and manufacture tests for the new SARS-CoV-2

78

pandemic at unprecedented speed, taking three months to develop assays that would ordinarily take three

79

years. Serology testing, that can identify those who have previously been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2

80

virus and have mounted an immune response, has been hailed as key to managing the pandemic however

81

controversy remains over both the accuracy and utility of serology testing in disease management.

82

Structural proteins, including the spike (essential for viral infection) and the nucleocapsid (important for

83

viral RNA transcription), are both potential targets for early detection of infection and known to elicit an

84

immune response in the host (1) with antibodies detectable within 20 days of disease onset (2–4).

85

Systematic reviews (5,6) challenged the diagnostic accuracy of serological tests, particularly when using

86

lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs). Public Health England (PHE) showed only the Siemens and the

87

Roche Diagnostics assays met the minimum UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency

88

Target Product Profile criteria for sensitivity (7) after the threshold of positivity was adjusted to 0.128.

89

Assays from DiaSorin and Abbott Diagnostics (8) also provided acceptable diagnostic results. These

90

evaluations did not address cross-reactivity. To our knowledge little has been done regarding interference

91

from antibodies produced during other viral infection and autoimmune disorders. Additionally, with the

92

focus on diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, little has been done to evaluate the analytical accuracy,

93

which if poor, has the potential to negate all of these study findings. Indeed in the editorial, Duong and

94

colleagues clearly states that there is a need for critical independent evaluations of these tests, using the

95

same specimen panels(9).

96

This study provides a head-to-head evaluation of the diagnostic and analytical performance of four

97

commercially available IgG based serology assays for SARS-CoV-2 and a diagnostic accuracy study of

98

one point of care LFIA.

Material and methods

101

Specimen collection and storage

102

Patients were not involved in any part of the work. All samples were from archived specimens and were

103

fully anonymized before we accessed them. Therefore, our study is in accordance with the blanket Ethical

104

standards of University of East Anglia on de-identified samples for method development. Moreover,

105

using the UK NHS Research Ethics Committee decision toolkit (http://www.hra-

106

decisiontools.org.uk/ethics/) we confirmed that separate ethical review is not required for this study which

107

is in concordance with the Helsinki Declaration.

108

All serum samples were collected, anonymized, aliquoted and stored at –80oC until analysed. SARS-

109

CoV-2 PCR-positive patients (AusDiagnostics platform, Chesham, UK) were of both genders, age range

110

66 to 93 and hospitalized at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (NNUH) or Queen Elizabeth

111

Hospital in King Lynn (QEH). Samples were taken 8-44 days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.

112

Negative control samples were collected in 2018 from patients with no history of infection or immune

113

disorder. Pre-pandemic samples from patients who had a range of confirmed respiratory infections

114

(including Influenza A, B and seasonal coronaviruses [Table 1]), samples collected from patients with

115

inflammatory polyarthritis positive for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) along with

116

samples positive for thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) were used to test the non-specific binding

117

of non-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These groups of samples are referred to as N (negative control), CR

118

(cross-reactivity), RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis), TSI (patients with thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin)

119

and P (SARS-CoV-2 Positive). A total of 195 individual serum samples (43 P, 50 N, 50 CR, 22 RA and

120

30 TSI) were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. For a subset of patients, samples were available

121

for a series of time-points thus allowing for a time course analysis (43 patients, 142 samples).

124

SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays were from 1) Epitope Diagnostics Inc. (EDI, San Diego, CA, USA)

125

performed using the Agility ELISA automate (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA, USA), 2) EuroImmun

126

UK ITC (UK) performed manually, 3) Abbott Diagnostics (Maidenhead, UK) on the Alinity™ i analyser

127

and 4) DiaSorin (London, UK) on the Liaison XL analyser. A subset of samples were also tested using

128

the point of care testing (POCT) device SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM rapid test from Healgen (Houston, TX,

129

USA). Due to a limited number of cassettes available, 49 samples from 27 P were analysed along with 3

130

N, 8 CR, 4 RA and 4 TSI. Cross-reactive and negative samples were primarily chosen from patient

131

samples proven positive for seasonal coronaviruses and influenza A or a false positive result in one or

132

more of the immunoassays. We focused on the IgG results in order to compare with the immunoassays.

133

Assays were performed by trained biomedical scientists using manufacturer’s instructions. The SARS-

134

CoV-2 Abbott assay was performed in the clinical biochemistry department at NNUH and the other

135

SARS-CoV-2 assays were performed at the University of East Anglia. All other non- SARS-CoV-2

136

related tests were performed at the NNUH virology department. DiaSorin SARS-Cov-2 is a quantitative

137

assay and antibody concentrations are expressed in AU/mL. The Abbott, EDI and EuroImmun are

138

qualitative assays for which the result is calculated using the ratio of the sample optical density (OD)

139

against the negative or calibrator control (Supplemental Table). EuroImmun and DiaSorin assays detect

140

antibodies to, respectively, recombinant S1 and S1/S2 domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein while

141

both the EDI and Abbott assay detect antibodies to the nucleocapsid. The POCT from Healgen is a solid

142

phase lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 of IgG and IgM,

143

antigen not specified.

144
145

Imprecision

146

As the results are expressed with a values correlating with the amount of antibody detectable, imprecision

147

was assessed using a Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP-15 based protocol on the

automated clinical laboratory analysers protocol (34). Positive and negative patient pools and/or controls

149

of different concentrations were prepared and frozen as aliquots and assayed as 5 replicates per day on 5

150

different days. For the plate based assays, inter- and intra-assay CVs were calculated. Intra-assay was

151

determined using the CV of the optical density (OD) of duplicated samples. Inter-assay was determined

152

using the CV obtained from the sample pool and the kit positive control across the plates.

153
154

Statistics

155

Using IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0.0.1, Mann-Whitney and Cohen’s Kappa tests were used to compare OD

156

results between groups and to determine the concordance between the assays, respectively. Analysis of

157

EP15 was performed using EP evaluator. Variation was estimated on calculated values (R) or response

158

(Relative Light Unit, RLU) as intra and inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV). Graphical

159

representations were conducted with GraphPad Prism version 8.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., USA).

Throughout the tables, figures, and legends, the following terminology is used to show statistical

168

DiaSorin EP15 imprecision was estimated based on response intensity (RLU). Positive control

170

consistently below the lower limit of detection of 3.8AU/mL and the negative pool concentration was

171

consistently below 10AU/mL, the resulting calculated imprecision was therefore expectedly elevated.

172

EDI and EuroImmun Intra-assay imprecision on duplicate samples (Table 2) was on average CV=

173

3.3±3.8% and 6.1±6.7% respectively. Inter-assay imprecision of EDI was CV=14.2% for the kit positive

174

pool and 16.5% for the negative pool. Baseline OD varied between the plates increasing the inter-assay

175

variations, however, the ratio positive/cut-off was on average 1.43 ±0.16 (CV =11.1%). Inter-assay of

176

EuroImmun was evaluated using the positive kit QC, the calibrator and the negative kit control.

177

Coefficient of variation were CV = 12.9%, 9.5% and 3.7% respectively.

178
179

Specificity and sensitivity

180

A total of 43 individual P were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Of these, twenty had samples

181

taken at least 14 days after a positive PCR result (P≥14) and 23 were taken prior (P<14). All P≥14 had

182

detectable antibodies in the EDI, EuroImmun, Abbott and Healgen assays. However, one sample returned

183

a negative result using the DiaSorin assay. These results suggest a true positive rate of 100% with EDI,

184

EuroImmun, Abbott and Healgen assays and 95% for the DiaSorin assay.

185

Amongst the 23 P<14 samples, antibodies were detected for 65% (Abbott & EuroImmun), 61% (EDI) and

186

43% (DiaSorin) of the samples. Two samples R were close to the threshold in EDI and Abbott (EDI: 0.8

187

and Abbott 1.9; EDI: 1.0 and Abbott 0.8) resulting in one being positive in one assay and negative in the

188

other (and vice-versa).

189

All 50 N were negative on the Abbott and EDI. Two samples were positive and 48 were negative on the

190

EuroImmun (although 2 were equivocal). Two false positive samples were also observed on the DiaSorin,

191

one being positive on both DiaSorin and EuroImmun assays.

192

The IgG kits showed a very good diagnostic ability to differentiate between P and N (Table 3). Overall,

193

EuroImmun and DiaSorin showed lower sensitivity and specificity than EDI and Abbott. Sensitivity

194

ranged between 81-100% on all time points for EDI, EuroImmun and Abbott. DiaSorin sensitivity was

195

71% on all time points and 95% for P≥14. Specificity was consistently 100% for the Abbott while it

196

ranged between 92 to 100% for the other assays.

197
198

Cross-Reactivity

199

There were no SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive results from patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 infection (CR,

200

n=50, including seasonal flu (n=7)), anti-CCP positive (RA, n=22) nor TSI positive (n=30) using the

201

Abbott and the EDI assays. Overall, DiaSorin showed the highest (4%) cross-reactivity (2CR, 1 RA and 1

202

TSI), followed by EuroImmun (3% - 3CR) and EDI (1% - 1 TSI). The Mann-Whitney test showed that on

203

the EDI only, the R value of samples used to test cross-reactivity (RA and TSI) was significantly

204

elevated, however only one sample was falsely positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1).

205

Any sample that gave a false positive result in any of the immunoassays was also tested on the Healgen

206

POCT and none were IgG positive. However, a very weak signal could be detected on one TSI sample

207

and one sample from a patient with seasonal flu. Because of the very small number of sample tested,

208

specificity calculation was not performed for the rapid test.

209
210

Time course analysis

211

We analysed 1 to 13 data points for 43 P. We observed an increase of the signal for presence of IgG over

212

time going from negativity to positivity and reaching a plateau (Figure 2). Sigmoid curve-fitting indicated

213

a time from PCR to seroconversion at 9.8 days (95% CI 10.7-13.7), 10.2 (95% CI 8.5-11.8), 12.2 days

214

(95% CI 10.7-13.7) and 10.4 days (95% CI 7.9-12.9) for EDI, Abbott, DiaSorin and EuroImmun assays

215

respectively. Note that due to a limited number of EuroImmun tests available, we only had measurements

216

for 56 (of 142) data points. One data point was missing for Abbott and 4 were missing for DiaSorin due to

217

insufficient sample volume.

218

We tested 48 samples from 27 P patients using the Healgen rapid test. Ninety four percent (n=45)

219

displayed a positive test for IgG. Samples showed positive results with POCT from day 7 post PCR

220

although these were still negative in the other immunoassays (SARS-CoV-2 positive at day 12).

221
222

Assay Concordance

223

Abbott and EDI had the greatest concordance with Cohen’s Kappa of 0.957 and 97.9% agreement

224

between the all results (Table 4). DiaSorin was the most different, with agreements below 95%. The

225

Healgen POCT concordance with the other assays was low (below 90%) but reflect a limited number of

226

samples and may not be representative. Modifying the threshold to 0.8 for EDI would allow the detection

227

of 2 more P<14 without increasing the rate of false positive. No change in threshold in the other assay

228

would reclassify any results without dramatically affecting the specificity to either have a high rate of

229

false positive or false negative.

231

Discussion

232

Statement of principal findings

233

In this head to head study we demonstrated the good performance of four commercially available

234

serologic assays for SARS-CoV-2 and one POCT. Abbott, Epitope Diagnostics Ltd and EuroImmun

235

demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity than the DiaSorin assay on the same specimens. The

236

Abbott assay showed no cross-reactivity to any other potential interfering substances tested while EDI,

237

EuroImmun and DiaSorin cross-reacted in 1%, 3% and 4% of the sample tested. However, no assay

238

cross-reacted with Influenza A and B or other coronaviruses. The analytical performance was deemed

239

acceptable although it varied considerably between the different methods.

240
241

It is estimated that there are nearly 300 different SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests in development globally

242

ranging from POCT through to assays on large clinical laboratory analysers. Whilst data is accruing on

243

the sensitivity and specificity of a number of these assays (5,6) there are still many with little or no

244

published, independent performance evaluations. Whilst there is a focus on the diagnostic accuracy of

245

these tests, much less is understood about the analytical performance of these devices such as imprecision

246

and cross reactivity with common respiratory illnesses or immunoassay interferences. Without this

247

knowledge the sensitivity and specificity data is brought into question and it is important that the

248

limitations of assay are fully understood before applying the results in clinical practice. The Food and

249

Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency acceptance criteria for biological assays typically

250

define the required between-run and within-run precision as CV≤15 % for positive samples and ≤20 % for

251

samples at the lower limit of quantification (10,11). All immunoassays passed the criteria for positive

252

samples.

253

Published median seroconversion time for IgG is around 14 days post symptoms (12–14). As we did not

254

have access to symptom onset for most patients, we used PCR day to date the samples, before and after

255

day 14. All samples post day 14 were positive in all assay except DiaSorin, which returned one false

256

negative (day 39). Positivity prior to day 14 was consistent between EDI, EuroImmun and Abbott. These

257

results are differing from those published by PHE who observed more false negative results in the Abbott

258

than the DiaSorin (92.7% sensitivity vs 95% sensitivity, respectively) (8). We estimated seroconversion

259

post PCR positivity to be between 9 and 12 days on these assays. Although we couldn’t do a full

260

comparison of the POCT with the immunoassays, 100% of the P≥14 samples were IgG positive. More

261

samples were also positive with POCT prior day 14 than in the other assays.

262

In regard to the POCT, our study showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. We observed no false

263

negative results on P≥14 after a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and more samples were IgG positive P<14

264

than the other immunoassays. Two potential false positive were detected (including seasonal flu) but the

265

signal was very weak and confirmation would be necessary. The results of systematic reviews on point-of

266

care serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 suggest discontinuing the use of the devices due to low sensitivity

267

(5). Our results tend to reveal a different pattern however we only performed a limited number of tests.

We chose 50 samples collected in 2018 from patients with no known infection as negative controls. Both

269

the EDI and the Abbott showed 100% specificity. However, EuroImmun and DiaSorin produced false

270

positives (n=4 and 2, respectively). Only one of these samples was common between both assays. PHE

271

also showed lower specificity of the DiaSorin assay (vs Abbott). We analysed 50 samples from patients

272

(pre-pandemic) presenting with respiratory infection. Among those 7 had the seasonal flu, 8 had influenza

273

A., other viruses included EBV, Varicellazoster virus, parainfluenza, Adenovirus. EDI and Abbott

274

showed 100% specificity with no false positive; however, we observed 3 positive results with the

275

EuroImmun, two of these also being positive with the DiaSorin. These samples were from patients with

276

EBV (n=1) and RSV (n=2). Our results on EuroImmun differ slightly from a previous evaluation (15),

277

where specificity of the assay was excellent as early as 4 days after positive PCR and only 2 of 28

278

samples showed borderline cross-reactivity to common human coronaviruses. None of the assays showed

279

cross-reactivity either to the seasonal CoV flu or to Influenza A. Although it is based on a small number

280

of sample (n=7 for each), it brings confidence that assays will be able to discriminate SARS-CoV-2

281

antibodies during the next seasonal flu. Tang et al., showed similar results on 5 patients using EuroImmun

282

and Abbott Assay (16). A great variety of endogenous substances such as polyreactive antibodies or

283

autoantibodies, can interfere with the reaction between analyte and reagent antibodies in immunoassays.

284

Assays for SARS-CoV-2 are no exception. Manufacturers, and evaluation studies to date, offer a limited

285

insight into cross-reactivity of other antibodies in particular to other SARS-CoV antibodies(17–21). A

286

small independent study showed no cross-reactivity was seen for patients with Influenza A (n=2),

Influenza B (n=2) and other coronaviruses (n= 5) (16). Samples with potentially interfering antibodies did

288

not cross-react in the Abbott Diagnostics assay, and a limited number cross-reacted in the other assays.

289

None of these samples was common between the different assays and modification of the various

290

threshold would not improve performance of any assay.

291

Successful attempts to treat SARS-CoV-2 patients with blood from convalescent individuals suggest

292

antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may have the ability to confer protective immunity to the disease (22–

293

27). Spike proteins are the most likely target for neutralizing antibodies are displayed on the surface of the

294

virus whereas the nucleocapsid is contained within the viral envelope(28,29). Antibodies against the

295

nucleocapsid have been shown to appear first (30,31), followed by the production of antibodies against

296

the spike protein (12,13). Therefore, assays based on the nucleocapsid detection appear to be more

297

sensitive early on in the disease recovery but presence of anti-S1/S2 antibodies may indicate presence of

298

neutralizing antibodies. Both the EuroImmun and the DiaSorin are targeted the spike protein of SARS-

299

Cov-2 while the EDI and Abbott are targeted to the nucleocapsid protein of the virus. We observe a

300

highest specificity of both nucleocapsid assays (EDI and Abbott, 100% (91-100%)) compared to the two

301

spike assays (DiaSorin (96% (85-99%)) and EuroImmun (92% (79-97%)). Although the EuroImmun

302

assay had the same sensitivity (all time points to PCR) as the EDI and Abbott, the DiaSorin assay was

303

less sensitive (71% (73-100%) vs (81% (66-91%)), potentially supporting this hypothesis.

304

Overall, the assays had high concordance, DiaSorin being the least identical to the others, with higher

305

false negative and false positive, and lower performance. This is in accordance with the high false

306

positive rate observed by Boukli et al. (32) with the DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay on patients

307

with non-SARS-CoV-2 acute infections. The same samples were analysed on the different platforms and

308

therefore the direct comparison is possible. However, one needs to consider the potential variance in

309

antigen as the Wuhan strain has evolved as geographic spread has occurred between the different regions

310

of the globe (GISAID) (33) and it is possible that these differences will not be seen on a different set of

311

samples. Harmonization of the assays is necessary but will be near impossible with such variation

between assay designs (spike vs nucleocapsid). The Wales External Quality Assessment Scheme

313

(WEQAS, UK, https://www.weqas.com/) is now offering a SARS-CoV-2 antibody external quality

314

assessment (EQA) program for laboratories which will reduce uncertainty associated with different

315

methods.

317

Conclusion and policy implications

318

The role of serology testing in the management of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection will remain

319

controversial until we have clear data that enables an understanding of how production of IgG relates to

320

immunity over time and whether or not the presence or absence of antibodies can inform risk of future

321

infection. Whilst the clinical utility of serology tested is debated, it is important that the diagnostic and

322

analytical performance of these tests is understood and adequate for need so that there can be confidence

323

in the results when a meaningful clinical use is determined. Without high quality analytical testing the

324

clinical application of serology testing in the future is not viable.

325

This study examines the performance of four commercially available serologic assays for SARS-CoV-2

326

in a head to head study. Our study demonstrated good analytical performance for all of the assays,

327

however we observed Abbott, EDI and EuroImmun demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity than

328

the DiaSorin assay in this study. Whilst a full evaluation was not possible the P14+ samples from the

329

main study were used in a sub analysis using the Healgen POCT device which showed 100% specificity,

330

this contradicts earlier studies (5,6) and indicates that the evolution of the quality of POC devices has

331

been rapid and some may now demonstrate adequate performance for antibody detection.

332

Assays showed 0-4% cross-reactivity, however none with Influenza viruses. This may give increase

333

confidence of the test during the seasonal flu period. We observed differences between the assay

334

responses with DiaSorin being the most different from the other three. We hypothesize that these

335

differences may be linked to the design of the assay themselves (spike glycoprotein or nucleocapsid) and

336

the timeline of production of antibodies for either antigen. We also suggested the possibility that the

337

antigen plasticity and the antigen used when the manufacturer set up the test may influence the sensitivity

338

of the CoV-2 assays. These findings highlight the importance of following the evolution of the antibody

339

production and evolution of the virus over time. But it also highlights how harmonization of the assays

340

will be complex.
