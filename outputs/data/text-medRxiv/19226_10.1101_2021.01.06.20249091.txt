COVID-19 in Kazakhstan

1

ABSTRACT.

2

Background: The earliest coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases in Central Asia

3

were announced in March 2020 by Kazakhstan. Despite the implementation of aggressive

4

measures to curb infection spread, gaps remain in the understanding of the clinical and

5

epidemiologic features of the regional pandemic.

6

Methods: We did a retrospective, observational cohort study of patients with laboratory-

7

confirmed COVID-19 in Kazakhstan between February and April 2020. We compared

8

demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data of patients with different COVID-19

9

severities on admission. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to

10

assess factors associated with disease severity and death. Whole-genome SARS-CoV-2

11

analysis was performed in 53 patients without a recent history of international travel.

12

Findings: Of the 1072 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in March-April

13

2020, the median age was 36 years (IQR 24–50) and 484 (45%) were male. On admission,

14

683 (64%) participants had mild, 341 (32%) moderate, and 47 (4%) severe-to-critical

15

COVID-19 manifestation; 20 deaths (1.87%) were reported at study exit. Multivariable

16

regression indicated increasing odds of severe disease associated with older age (odds ratio

17

1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.07, per year increase; p<0.001), the presence of comorbidities (2.13,

18

95% CI 1.07-4.23; p<0.031) and elevated white blood cell count (WBC, 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-

19

1.28; p<0.032) on admission, while older age (1.09, 95% CI 1.06-1.12, per year increase;

20

p<0.001) and male sex (5.97, 95% CI 1.95-18.32; p<0.002) were associated with increased

21

odds of death. The Kazakhstan SARS-CoV-2 isolates grouped into seven distinct lineages

22

O/B.4.1, S/A.2, S/B.1.1, G/B.1, GH/B.1.255, GH/B.1.3 and GR/B.1.1.10.

23

Interpretation: Older age, comorbidities, increased WBC count, and male sex were risk

COVID-19 in Kazakhstan

1

INTRODUCTION.

2

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the

3

coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), within months of emergence from Wuhan, China,

4

rapidly spread exacting a devastating human toll across the globe 1. While the search for

5

effective treatments continues and vaccines have commenced early implementation 1, it is

6

imperative that up-to-date information be available from diverse populations on the disease

7

epidemiology, clinical presentation, and population-specific characteristics influencing

8

COVID-19 prevention, treatment, and vaccine strategies. This is especially critical in low-

9

and middle-income countries (LMIC), where epidemiologic surveillance is often

10

constrained due to resource shortages 2.

11

Kazakhstan was the first among the Central Asian LMICs to initiate COVID-19 screening

12

in early 2020, with the first confirmed cases identified in mid-March, and a country-wide

13

emergency state declared on 16 March 2020 3. Kazakhstan neighbours Russia, China, and

14

the Central Asian states, and harbours an extensive ground and airway transit network,

15

setting it in a vulnerable position for both COVID-19 importation and rapid community

16

spread. Despite the initial swift public health response, Kazakhstan has encountered major

17

barriers regarding case reporting and attempts have been made by both the government and

18

public to increase transparency over COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality 3,4. Thus a

19

recent study from Kazakhstan has described the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in

20

children 5, corroborating a relatively mild disease course for pediatric COVID-19.

21

However, little is still known about the clinical attributes and molecular epidemiology of

22

COVID-19 across varied age and ethnic groups, information that is urgently needed to

23

guide the public health authorities and clinicians in the wake of the on-going pandemic.

COVID-19 in Kazakhstan

1

Here, we examined data from hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19

2

during the first months of the pandemic to explore demographic, clinical and laboratory

3

features and factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity and death in Kazakhstan.

4

We also analyzed whole-genome SARS-CoV-2 data to characterize the regional

5

community-level virus diversity.

METHODS.

8

Study design and participants

9

Medical records were obtained for individuals who presented with COVID-19-like

10

symptoms or had a suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 between 20 February and 30 April

11

2020, as reported to the Republican Centre for Health Development by hospitals in 14

12

regions and 3 major cities (Fig 1A). During this period, all subjects with suspected or

13

confirmed COVID-19 infection were hospitalized in specialized "provisional" clinics. The

14

retrospective cohort study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of Semey Medical

15

University as an anonymized epidemiological study, for which the requirement for

16

informed consent was waived due to the pandemic state and urgent need to collect and

17

analyze data. Virological samples used in genomic studies were anonymized and all

18

genomic study procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Centre

19

for Biotechnology.

20

Data collection

21

Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were

22

extracted from de-identified electronic medical records using a standardised data collection

23

form. Radiological data were only available in the form of a radiologist's final diagnosis; a

detailed description of imaging scans was unavailable. All data were entered into a

2

computerized database and cross-checked by two physicians (MG and RI), and

3

subsequently by a third researcher (SY).

4

Laboratory procedures

5

Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was done using real-time quantitative -

6

PCR (qPCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs by the regional National Centre of Expertise (NCE)

7

laboratories using the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) kit (Shenzhen, China) targeting the

8

Orf1ab locus A. Laboratory examinations included complete blood counts, blood chemical

9

analyses, coagulation testing, liver and renal function assessment, and measurements of

10

electrolytes, C-reactive protein, creatinine, D-dimer and lactate.

11

Virus genome sequencing and bioinformatics

12

Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 53 randomly selected symptomatic patients,

13

who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and were hospitalized in the capital city, Nur-

14

Sultan between 22 March and 9 May (Fig 1B). Travel history was available for 49 patients,

15

none of whom had a history of recent international travel. Full description of the

16

sequencing methods involving Sanger and Next Generation Illumina Sequencing is

17

provided in appendix pp. 2-4.

18

Phylogenetic analyses

19

The global SARS-CoV2 phylogeny, consisting of 5022 genomes representative of the total

20

repository of 66,940 sequences, and associated metadata were downloaded from

21

Nextstrain6 on 8 July 2020; the tree was reconstructed using the Nextstrain/ncov pipeline.

22

To visualize the phylogenetic relationship of the Kazakhstan isolates in the context of

23

possible origins of importation, we created a tree using 165 sequences from the Global

Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) 7 satisfying one or all of the following

2

criteria: i) proximity to the Kazakhstan sequences, as determined by calculating the

3

pairwise distance between all samples in the Global GISAID Phylogeny using snp-dists 8

4

and selecting the global strains closest to the Kazakhstan isolates (n=21); ii) representing

5

non-redundant SARS-CoV-2 strains from regions, where international travel was reported

6

from in the current cohort (see Fig 3) (n=63); and iii) randomly selected SARS-CoV-2 full-

7

length sequences from each of the clades observed in Kazakhstan (appendix p. 5) per

8

month between 31 December 2019 and 9 May 2020 (n=81). Sequences were aligned to the

9

Wuhan reference using MAFFT 9, the alignment checked for discrepancies and ends

10

trimmed manually to match the reference, followed by reconstruction of a maximum

11

likelihood phylogeny in IQTREE 10 using the GTR + F + I model and ultrafast bootstrap

12

option with 1,000 replicates. The phylogenetic trees were visualized using ggtree 11, and

Definitions

16

A patient was assigned a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis if their medical record

17

contained at least one positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result. Fever was defined as axillary

18

temperature of at least 37·3°C. The degree of COVID-19 severity was defined following

19

the interim WHO guidelines 13. To avoid inconsistencies arising from varied terminology in

20

electronic records, patients described as having “asymptomatic”, “presymptomatic” and

21

“mild” COVID-19 severity were combined into one “mild COVID-19 disease” category.

22

To facilitate comparisons with the literature, the term "non-severe" COVID-19 was used

23

for both "mild" and "moderate" disease, while the term "severe" COVID-19 was reserved

defined as travel outside of Kazakhstan within two weeks prior to hospitalization or

3

symptom onset, whichever was first.

Statistical analysis

6

Variables were excluded prior to analysis if data were available for less than 40% of

7

patients in any comparison group. We used the two-sided Mann-Whitney U, χ2, or Fisher's

8

exact tests to compare differences between groups, as appropriate. For uni- and

9

multivariable logistic regression analyses, patients with mild and moderate disease severity

10

were pooled into one "non-severe" category and compared with the "severe" (severe-

11

critical) patient group. Risk factors associated with disease severity and death and their

12

odds ratios (OR) were first analyzed by univariable logistic regression. In the multivariable

13

logistic regression analyses, to avoid model overfitting due to the limited size of endpoint

14

events, four variables were chosen for the analysis of disease severity (n=47 for severe-

15

critical patients) and two variables were ultimately included in the non-survivor analysis

16

(n=20 for non-survivors). Variables for multivariable analyses were selected based on

17

significance in the univariable model (p<0.05), low collinearity, sample size constraints for

18

each variable, and prior knowledge from the literature. Statistical analyses were performed

19

using IBM SPSS V.23 and R V.3.6.3.

RESULTS.

5

Medical record data were obtained for a total of 1960 subjects with COVID-19-like clinical

6

symptoms or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via a close contact or travel. After

7

excluding 96 patients, for whom a SARS-CoV-2 PCR result was unavailable, there were

8

1864 patients with a known PCR result (Fig 1A). Our analysis focused on the 1072

9

patients, who had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ diagnosis, representing 32% of all

10

(n=3402) patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 (Fig 2A), who had been

11

hospitalized in Kazakhstan as of April 30, 2020 14.

12

The largest number of PCR-confirmed patients (207, 19%) were admitted in the capital city

13

and affiliated municipality (Nur-Sultan, Akmola region), followed by Almaty city and

14

region (127, 12%) (Fig 2B). 344 (32%) and 728 (68%) patients were hospitalized in March

15

and April, respectively, and all patients had been discharged or died by 5 May 2020. 439

16

(41%) of all PCR+ cases were identified through COVID-19 screening of inbound travelers

17

and through tracing activities, while 633 (59%) patients were admitted based on the

18

presence of COVID-19-like symptomatology. Professional occupation data were available

19

for 350 patients, of whom 91 (26%) were identified as health care workers. Recent

20

international travel was reported by 170 (16%) patients; most reported travel was from

21

Russia (58%) and Europe (30%), via airplane (59%) and ground transportation (41%) (Fig

22

3). The comparisons of patient demographic and clinical characteristics on admission

23

grouped by disease severity and death are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

COVID-19 in Kazakhstan

1

Of all 1072 patients, 63·8 % had mild, 31·8% moderate, 3·83% severe 0·56% critical

2

severity of disease on admission. A total of 20 deaths were reported: 1 (0·1%) in a patient

3

with mild symptoms, 4 (1·2%) in patients with moderate disease, and 15 (31%) among

4

patients with severe-critical disease (Table 1). The median age of the cohort was 36 years

5

and 8·8 and 7·6% of the patients were younger than 15 and older than 65 years,

6

respectively. Patients with moderate and severe-critical disease were older than those with

7

mild disease by a median of 6 and 26 years, respectively (Table 1). Compared to survivors,

8

non-survivors were older by a median of 30 years, with most exceeding 50 years of age,

9

and were more likely to be male (Table 2).

10

Most patients (80%) were Kazakh; patients with severe-critical disease and non-survivors

11

were less likely to be Kazakh, compared to non-severe patients (Table 1) and survivors

12

(Table 2), respectively. The proportion of patients with comorbidities increased with

13

disease severity, and 80% (16/20) of the non-survivors had a comorbidity. Presentation of

14

most clinical symptoms and signs differed across disease severity categories (Table 1).

15

Compared to survivors, non-survivors were more likely to have fever, respiratory

16

abnormalities, low blood pressure, and myalgia/fatigue on admission (Table 2).

17

Disease severity was associated with altered markers of coagulation (prothrombin time,

18

fibrinogen), liver (albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase

19

(AST), bilirubin) and kidney (blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine) function, and changes

20

in blood glucose, C-reactive protein and minerals (potassium, calcium). Severe-critical

21

patients were also more likely to have elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (33% of the

22

patients) compared to mild and moderate severity patients (16 and 14%, respectively).

23

Compared to survivors, non-survivors were more likely to have leukocytosis (7·5 vs 22% of

2

bilirubin, glucose, BUN, creatinine, and sodium levels. D-dimer and lactate measurements

3

were excluded from the analysis due to the small proportion of patients with available data.

4

Chest X-ray and/or computed tomography (CT) data were available for 418 (39%) patients,

5

of whom 57% had abnormalities defined as "pneumonia"(31%) or "bronchitis"(26%) by the

6

radiologists in charge. Pneumonia was most frequently diagnosed in severe-critical patients

7

(91%, Table 1) and non-survivors (80%, Table 2) compared to patients with non-severe

8

disease and survivors.

9

Antibiotics and anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy were more likely administered to

10

patients with severe-critical disease, while significantly fewer patients with severe-critical

11

disease received antiviral medications compared to patients with non-severe disease (Table

12

1). Compared with survivors, non-survivors were more likely to receive ribavirin and

13

lopinavir-ritonavir and anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy (Table 2). Oxygen therapy was

14

administered to a total of 64 (6%) patients, chiefly those with severe-critical disease (65%)

15

and all non-survivors (100%). Mechanical ventilation was performed on 27 (3%) patients,

16

of whom 40% had severe-critical disease and 90% were non-survivors (Tables 1 and 2).

17

In the univariable analysis of COVID-19 severity predictors, older age, non-Kazakh

18

ethnicity, comorbidities, elevated white blood cells (WBC), high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte

19

ratio (NLR), lower haemoglobin, lower albumin and elevated creatinine were all associated

20

with severe disease. We included 1072 patients (1024 non-severe and 47 severe-to-critical

21

patients) in the multivariable analysis, with two continuous and two categorical variables

22

(age, ethnicity, comorbidities, and white blood cells (WBC). Older age (OR 1·05 [95% CI

In the univariable analysis of COVID-19 mortality predictors, older age, male sex, non-

and elevated creatinine were associated with death. 1072 patients (1052 survivors and 20

6

9

associated with increased odds of death (Table 4).

10

Genomic data were generated for the viral samples acquired from all 53 patients (median

11

age 21 years (IQR 21-34), 66% male, 94% Kazakh, see Fig 1B and appendix p. 5).

12

Compared to the Wuhan-1 reference, there were a maximum of 12 single-nucleotide

13

polymorphisms (SNPs) per virus genome (median 9 SNPs, IQR 8-10, see appendix p. 6),

S/B.1.1 (19), GH/B.1.255 and GH/B.1.3 (n=5), G/B.1 (n=1) and GR/B.1.1.10 (n=1) (Fig

17

4A, appendix p.6). Kaz_O/B4.1 isolates clustered with predominantly Middle Eastern

18

sequences that also included European isolates (Fig 4B), Kaz_S/A2-B.1.1 viruses were

19

closely related to the strains from Spain, Britain, and Russia, although this clade appears to

20

have predominantly Asian origins (Fig 4B). Kaz_GH/B.1.255-B.1.3 viruses were nested

21

with Mexican and Argentinian viruses deriving ancestral lineages from both the Middle

22

East and Europe. Kaz_G/B.1 and Kaz_GR/B.1.1.10 viruses cluster closely with North-

23

Western/Western European and Southern European viruses, respectively (Fig 4B).

COVID-19 in Kazakhstan

1

DISCUSSION.

2

Here we detailed the clinical features of 1072 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-

3

19 and described the genetic diversity of circulating SARS-CoV-2 in Kazakhstan.

4

Consistent with data from other cohorts1,17–22, older age, comorbidities, and elevated WBC

5

on admission were associated with higher odds of severe disease, while higher odds of

6

death were associated with older age and male sex. Additional factors observed in patients

7

with severe disease included non-Kazakh ethnicity, high NLR, lower haemoglobin, lower

8

albumin and elevated creatinine. Other factors commonly observed in non-survivors

9

included non-Kazakh ethnicity, comorbidities, elevated WBC, decreased platelet counts,

10

lower albumin and elevated creatinine. Our genomic findings point at several independent

11

importations of SARS-CoV-2, followed by community-level amplification early in the

12

pandemic.

13

A highlight of the current cohort is a lower ratio of patients with severe-critical to non-

14

severe (moderate and mild) COVID-19 compared to other cohorts, despite an early

15

implementation in Kazakhstan of the WHO disease classification guidelines13. Thus, the

16

proportion of severe-critical cases in our study was 4%, which is approximately 5-fold

17

lower than that reported elsewhere 17,21,23. At the same time, the overall mortality rate in our

18

cohort (1.9%) is consistent with the estimates of crude confirmed case fatality risk among

19

COVID-19 patients presenting a wide spectrum of disease manifestations 24, but is 10-fold

20

lower than the rates typically described for hospitalized patients 25,26- probably because in

21

Kazakhstan all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, regardless of disease

22

manifestation on admission, were admitted to hospitals. As expected, in our cohort

23

mortality correlated with disease severity; the risk of death was low in patients with mild

COVID-19 in Kazakhstan

1

disease, similar to that reported typically (~0.1%) 17, but it escalated dramatically to a 4-

2

fold higher risk in patients with severe-critical disease compared to severe COVID-19

3

elsewhere (e.g. 8% in 17). The high mortality associated with severe-critical COVID-19 in

4

this cohort could be due to a combination of mis-categorization of patients manifesting

5

severe COVID-19 symptoms into non-severe disease categories, and subsequent

6

“saturation” of the severe-critical disease category by patients with unfavorable prognosis,

7

and a shortage of healthcare resources in a rapidly escalating pandemic 2,3.

8

Consistent with other studies, including those from the neighbouring Uzbekistan and

9

Russia 1,17–20,24,27, older age was a key contributor to COVID-19 severity and mortality, and

10

the non-survivor group consisted predominantly of older men. The cohort’s median age (36

11

years) was higher than the Kazakhstan median (31 years)28 and identical to that of COVID-

12

19 patients in Uzbekistan 27. The cohort sex ratio and ethnic make-up were consistent with

13

the recent census data 28,29, whereby most Kazakhstan residents are Kazakh (68·5%),

14

followed by peoples of Russian (18·9%) and of other ancestries (12·6%), principally

15

Uzbeks, Uyghurs, Ukrainians, Tatars and Germans. In univariable analyses, non-Kazakh

16

ethnicity was associated with both COVID-19 severity and death, although this effect was

17

abrogated in multivariable models, suggesting that non-Kazakh ethnicity is linked to other

18

risk factors, consistent with augmented risk of COVID-19 infection and more severe

19

disease among ethnic minority groups in Western countries 30. A biological predisposition

20

of non-Kazakh people to a more severe COVID-19 disease should be addressed by future

21

investigations.

22

Overall, both our clinical and laboratory findings were in line with earlier research.

23

Notwithstanding, there are differences that may have arisen due to the heterogeneity in data

collection by facilities across the country. For example, unlike in other studies 17,22,

2

thrombocytopenia in our cohort was uncommon, but, consistently, lower absolute platelet

3

counts were associated with death. Further, differences in other blood count parameters

4

were not significant among the patient sub-categories, but consistent changes associated

5

with COVID-19 severity were observed in blood biochemistry, coagulation and liver and

6

renal function tests, inflammatory markers and electrolytes 17,22,25. These observations

7

emphasize the need for careful re-examination of the diagnostic test reference ranges

8

utilized across the country in the context of COVID-19 patient management. Predictably,

9

the prevalence of radiology-confirmed pneumonia increased with disease severity; based on

10

radiological assessment, bronchitis was a common diagnosis in non-severe COVID-19,

11

consistent with bronchial wall thickening in ~20% of COVID-19 cases, indicating an effect

12

of SARS-CoV-2 with or without a respiratory coinfection31.

13

We identified representatives of five of the eight global SARS-CoV-2 clades circulating in

14

Kazakhstan early in the pandemic. Most isolates (46/53) belonged to clades O or S -

15

descendants of the early lineages that originated in Asia and were globally prevalent prior

16

to the appearance of the D614-G614 mutation that swept through Europe, reaching a ~67%

17

frequency among European sequences by mid-March 32. Since our viral isolates were

18

sampled after the appearance of the G clade mutation in Europe, the high prevalence of O

19

and S sub-types in Kazakhstan suggests an early importation, perhaps weeks prior to the

20

declaration of the international travel ban, and subsequent amplification through

21

community spread. Notably, the Kazakhstan S lineage isolates clustered with viruses of

22

from Europe, such as Spain in the case of lineage S/A.2, while the Kazakhstan O clade

23

isolates, clustering with Middle Eastern (particularly, Iranian) strains, all belonged to

lineage B.4.1, which arose uniquely in Kazakhstan. These observations are consistent with

2

the evidence that areas of southern Europe and the Middle East represented early points of

3

SARS-CoV-2 introduction and spread 33. Additionally, the presence of three clade G

4

lineages in Kazakhstan at diverse timepoints, between 25 March and 9 May, indicates

5

multiple independent importations from Europe and the Americas.

6

Patient travel histories suggest that during the study period COVID-19 infections were

7

imported mainly from the neighboring Russia, and from Europe. Only 1% of the patients

8

reported travel from China, where case numbers had substantially decreased by March

9

2020 34. Remarkably, 41% of the international travelers used train or bus, and other means

10

of ground transportation, which has implications for public health policies aimed to curtail

11

COVID-19 spread on public transit.

12

Our study has several limitations. First, our cohort represents only a third of all COVID-19

13

cases confirmed by PCR in March-April in Kazakhstan. Second, the quality of our dataset

14

is largely dependent on the quality of the medical record data, which were collected in

15

emergency settings by clinicians and which could have increased data heterogeneity. Third,

16

some data, such as laboratory findings for CRP, were only available for a subset of

17

participants, while other data, such as D-dimer levels and information on clinical outcomes

18

or complications were available for <40% of patients within the comparison groups and

19

were excluded from the analyses. Fourth, death reporting may have been delayed or more

20

deaths may have occurred after April 30, resulting in under-estimation of mortality. Fifth,

21

laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was done using a commercially available PCR

22

supplied centrally to all testing sites, but we were unable to access data on the intra- and

23

inter-laboratory performance of this test. Sixth, our genomic analysis was limited to a

qualitative assessment and cannot fully recapitulate the country-wide SARS-CoV-2

2

diversity due to the small sample size and geographic constraints.

3

To conclude, we are hopeful that these clinical and virologic data on COVID-19 will help

4

shape public health policies and therapeutic and vaccine interventions in Kazakhstan. Our

5

findings could ultimately be applicable to other neighbouring countries that are similar in

6

their ethnic and socio-cultural profiles and healthcare structures, meriting consideration by

7

a broad spectrum of international public health authorities and policy makers.
