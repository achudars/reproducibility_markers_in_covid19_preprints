Abstract
A common non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) during the Covid-19
pandemic has been group size limits. Further, educational settings of schools
and universities have either fully closed or reduced their class sizes. As
countries begin to reopen classrooms, a key question will be how large classes
can be while still preventing local outbreaks of disease. Here we develop and
analyse a simple, stochastic epidemiological model where individuals
(considered as students) live in fixed households and are assigned to a fixed
class for daily lessons. We compare key measures of the epidemic - the peak
infected, the total infected by day 180 and the calculated R0 - as the size of
class is varied. We find that class sizes of 10 could largely restrict outbreaks
and often had overlapping inter-quartile ranges with our most cautious case of
classes of 5. However, class sizes of 30 or more often result in large epidemics.
Reducing the class size from 40 to 10 can reduce R0 by over 30%, as well as
signficantly reducing the numbers infected. Intermediate class sizes show
considerable variation, with the total infected varying by as much as from 10%
to 80% for the same class size. We show that additional in-class NPIs can
limit the epidemic still further, but that reducing class sizes appears to have a
larger effect on the epidemic. We do not specifically tailor our model for
Covid-19, but our results stress the importance of small class sizes for
preventing large outbreaks of infectious disease.

1. Introduction

8

The classic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological model has

9

long been used to model the spread of infectious disease in human, animal and

10

plant populations (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927; Anderson and May, 1979).

11

More recently, its extended SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered)

12

framework has formed a central pillar of much of the modelling of the

13

Covid-19 pandemic, often including highly realistic movement and contact

14

networks (Ferguson et al, 2020; Kucharski et al, 2020; Firth et al, 2020; Kain

15

et al, 2021). A key non-pharamceutical intervention (NPI) for populations

16

across the world during the Covid-19 pandemic has been restricting population

17

mixing through ‘lockdowns’, with people encouraged to stay at home and

18

avoid mixing with individuals outside their household unless essential. This

19

has often included closing educational settings of universities and schools, with

20

31 countries enacting full school closures and reduced schooling in a further 48

21

countries (UNESCO, 2020). As countries move to reopen these settings, an

22

important question is how classes can be organised to minimise further

23

disruption to students’ education whilst limiting epidemic spread. There have

24

been some excellent, in-depth modelling studies of infection spread in

25

educational settings, especially universities, with a range of NPIs included,

26

often with a focus on testing and isolation strategies (Bahl et al, 2020; Brook

27

et al, 2020; Cashore et al, 2020; Lopman et al, 2020). Here we focus on the

28

question of how class sizes may impact an epidemic.

29

An important measure of infectious disease growth and severity is the basic

30

reproductive ratio, R0 (Anderson and May, 1982; Heesterbeek, 2002). This

31

well-known term defines the average number of new infections from one

32

infected individual in an otherwise disease-free population. In mathematical

33

definitions, R0 is broadly the product of three quantities: the potential (or

34

probability) of infection upon an infectious contact, the infectious period and

35

the number of disease-free individuals contacted per unit time (Dietz, 1993).

36

An important consequence of this is that the larger the population that can be

37

contacted by an infectious individual - the effective population size - the

38

greater the potential spread of the epidemic. Thus, if a population can be

39

partitioned in to smaller sub-groups with minimal mixing between them, the

40

spread of disease can be significantly limited. This is a reality populations all

41

over the world have experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic, with

42

‘lockdown’ measures aimed at limiting mixing of households or groups. Data

43

suggests that such NPIs - such as closing businesses, closing schools and, of

44

relevance to our study, limiting group gathering sizes - have reduced the R0 of

45

Covid-19 by as much as 60% (Brauner et al, 2020). While there are many

46

studies examining epidemic spread in heterogeneous environments and/or on

47

networks, to our knowledge few modelling studies have specifically explored

48

how group size limits might impact the extent and severity of an epidemic.

49

Kain et al (2021) found that ‘chopping off the tail’ of individual infection

50

distributions - in effect preventing large gatherings - could effectively restrict

51

an epidemic in their Covid-19 parameterised model, reducing both mean

52

transmission and the variance in outcomes. In their broader examination of

53

Covid dynamics on a university campus, Brook et al (2020) found that a group

54

size limit of 6 could reduce the effective reproductive ratio from 1.05 to 0.86,

55

but limits of 50 had almost no impact on disease spread. As we seek to reopen

56

universities and schools, some mixing between households will be essential. An

57

important consideration, then, is the degree to which we could allow some

58

mixing whilst still limiting the extent of the epidemic.

59

Ultimately, our study investigates what happens to an epidemic when a

60

population partitioned into households is mixed for a short time period each

61

day into fixed groups. The situation loosely in our minds is of a university

62

cohort living in accommodation who attend a class each day. Similarly, we

63

might consider a school population attending classes, or a local community

64

forming interaction bubbles. However, we stress that our study is a relatively

65

simple, theoretical study of the impact of mixing, and we make no strong

66

claims about the precise values or predictions our model makes. For clarity

and transparency we state here a few of our key assumptions: (i) all classes

68

occur simultaneously with immediate transitions between class and home, (ii)

69

we do not include testing and isolation, (iii) there is no further mixing than in

70

classes and homes, either within the population or externally, (iv) we do not

71

include ’superspreaders’ but instead assume all individuals experience the

72

same transmission rates. We discuss the possible impact of each of these

73

assumptions in the Discussion. We also do not attempt to parameterise or

74

structure our model specifically for Covid-19. Rather, we seek to identify the

75

general patterns that result from mixing partititioned populations into

76

different sized groups.

77

2. Methods

78

We develop and run stochastic simulations of an epidemiological model using

79

python (code is available from GitHub,

80

https://github.com/abestshef/classsizeSEIR). The underlying epidemiological

81

model is an SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) framework where,

82

within a setting (‘home’ or ‘class’), the dynamics would be given by the

83

following ordinary differential equations,

87
88

dS
dt
dE
dt
dI
dt
dR
dt

89

where β is the transmission coefficient (with βI the ‘force of infection’), ω is

90

the rate of progression from exposed to fully infected and γ is the recovery

91

rate. We note that our state variables are defined as densities, not

92

proportions, and that the total population size is N = S + E + I + R rather

93

than being normalised to 1. The stochastic simulations use a Gillespie

94

algorithm (Gillespie, 1977) to calculate waiting times between events. The

95

possible events are initial infection (S → E), progression to full infection

96

(E → I) and recovery (I → R). Which event occurs at a chosen time point

97

depends on their relative probabilities at that point and in the relevant

98

setting. Each day is divided in to fixed time periods where all students are in

99

each setting, either home or class. We assume immediate movement between

100

settings, with classes occuring during t ∈ [day + 0.4, day + 0.5], roughly

101

equivalent to a 2.5 hour period. The event probabilities will be different in

102

each setting; thus when a transition time is reached, the waiting time is

103

stopped and recalculated from the transition point. Besides these transitions,

104

infection is assumed to occur evenly throughout the 24 hour period.

105

The total population size is N = 1000 and students are randomly divided in to

106

houses of size nh and classes of (target) size nc . We take two household sizes,

107

nh = 10 (100 households) and nh = 5 (200 households; arguably reasonable

108

averages for university halls and private housing respectively). Every

109

household has exactly nh individuals. Target class sizes vary in steps of 5 from

110

5 to 50. Where N/nc is an integer, exactly that many classes are created, all

111

containing exactly nc individuals. Where this is not the case, the classes

112

contain either nc or nc − 1 individuals (for example, for a target class size of

113

15, there are 62 classes of 15 students and 5 classes of 14 students). Both the

114

house and class composition is fixed in each simulation. We randomly choose

115

25 individuals to be infected at the beginning of each simulation, and all other

116

individuals are susceptible (we do not investigate the effect of varying this

117

initial number). Our key investigation will be to vary average class sizes and

118

explore the impact on the epidemic. We also compare results where

119

transmission is high (β = 0.5γ) and low (β = 0.2γ). These values are chosen

120

partly to give reasonably realistic estimates for R0 and also because the lower

121

value represents a 60% reduction of the higher value, which we use to

122

represent a reduction due to NPIs (see below). While these values would

123

appear to produce very high values of the basic reproductive ratio, R0 , in the

124

mean-field model (β = 0.5γ, N = 1000 =⇒ R0 = βN/γ = 500), it is well

125

known that the actual R0 is considerably lower in individual-based models,

126

especially when interactions networks are small (Keeling and Grenfell, 2000).

127

We directly calculate R0 from our simulations (see below) and found across all

128

the results presented here the median R0 fell in the range [0.66,3.68]. We also

129

additionally examine the case where NPIs in the class (e.g. masks, ventilation,

130

distancing) reduce transmission from the high to the low value (a reduction of

131

60%). We additionally assume γ = 1/14 and ω = 1/7 in all simulations, giving

132

a latent period of 7 days and infectious period of 14 days.

133

Recent work has highlighted the difficulties in representing outcomes from

134

stochastic epidemic models (Juul et al, 2020). First, to visualise the ‘typical’

135

time courses, we follow the methods of Juul et al (2020) to present the ‘most

136

central’ 50% of simulation runs. 100 simulations are run, discretised and

137

stored. We then repeatedly sample subsets of these stored runs (100 samples

138

of 20 curves) and increase the ‘score’ of any run that falls entirely within the

139

bounds of the sampled curves between time-points 10 and 150. Secondly we

140

present three key measures of the epidemic - the peak number infected, the

141

total number infected by day 180 and the calculated R0 (see below) - from 100

142

simulation runs for each class size using box and whisker plots. These

143

highlight the median values, the inter-quartile range (IQR; 25%-75%), the

144

maximum/minimum (or 1.5×IQR if smaller) and any outliers (values greater

145

than 1.5×IQR). Alongside these, we compare the IQR of the class of 5 (the

146

‘most cautious’ approach) with all other class sizes, noting where the IQRs do

147

and do not overlap using shading of the boxplots. This allows us to explore

148

whether class sizes can be raised above this cautious level without causing

149

large changes to the outcome.

150

A brief note on the basic reproductive ratio, R0 ; in our simple SEIR structure

151

we would have R0 = β N̂ /γ, which depends on the effective disease-free

152

population size N̂ . However, the interpretation of N̂ will vary depending on

153

the degree of mixing. Here we make a direct calculation of R0 in each

154

simulation by recording the number of infections caused by the 25 initially

155

infected individuals, an intuitive measure of R0 as might be estimated during

158

3.1. Large households

159

Taking an average household size of 10 and comparing the most central 50% of

160

runs for average class sizes of 10 and 40 (figure 1a-c), it is clear that smaller

161

class sizes substantially restrict the epidemic. When infection rates are low

162

(β = 0.2γ, figure 1a), with a class size of 40 there is considerable variability,

163

with some of the central curves showing minimal spread but others reaching

164

peaks above 15% infected. Reducing the class size to 10 clearly restricts the

165

central epidemics, with few curves peaking above 5% infected and in some

166

cases the epidemic completely finishing by day 60. For greater infection rates

167

(β = 0.5γ, figure 1b) there is a clear epidemic in all of the central runs for any

168

class size, but is clearly more severe with the larger groups, with the peak of

169

the central runs increasing from never more than 20% for a class size of 10 to

170

always more than 26% for a class size of 40. Finally we investigate the impact

171

of having simple NPIs in place in classes such that the infection is reduced

172

(from β = 0.5γ to β = 0.2γ) while in class but not at home. Compared to the

173

previous case we do see reductions in the epidemic, with the peaks lowered by

174

around 10%. Noticeably, however, solely reducing the class size from 40 to 10

175

(figure 1b blue v red) causes a greater reduction in the epidemic than solely

176

instituting the in-class NPIs in a class of 40 (figure 1b red v figure 1c blue).

177

Looking in more detail for varying class sizes using the boxplots, with low

178

infection rates (figure 2a-c) we again clearly see that greater class sizes lead to

179

larger epidemics in terms of all three measures. The colouring highlights that

180

only a class size of 10 has an overlapping IQR for both peak and total

181

infections, while class sizes up to 25 have an overlapping IQR for peak

182

infections only, meaning sizes of 30 or above have clearly different outcomes to

183

a class of 5. Moreover, for a class size of 10 the top of the inter-quartile range

184

(IQR) is 19% total infecteds, but for a class size of 40 the bottom of the IQR

185

is 58%, emphasising the large effect of different sizes. While all class sizes have

186

overlapping R0 IQRs with the class of 5, since this is essentially a logarithmic

187

quantity of epidemic growth it is not unexpected, and the median value is

188

reduced from 1.68 for a class size of 40 to 1.40 for a class size of 10.

189

We see considerable variation for intermediate class sizes, with the minimum

190

and maximum total infected for classes of 35 and 40 extending from below

191

10% to above 80%, suggesting different locations could experience very

192

different epidemics purely due to stochastic variation. We also note that we

193

assumed the same number of initial infections in all simulation runs. Different

194

institutions would likely start with different number of infections, which would

195

further increase the heterogeneity of outcomes.

196

When infection rates are larger (figure 2d-f), there are very large epidemics no

197

matter the class size, especially in terms of the total number infected. There

198

are clearly no class sizes where the IQRs overlap with the smallest class for the

199

peak and total infected, while only class sizes of 30 or smaller have overlapping

200

IQRs for R0 . A class size of 15 or above results in more than 94% of the

201

population infected in every single simulation run. Smaller class sizes do lead

202

to noticeabley lower peaks, however - the top of the IQR for class sizes of 15 is

203

22% and for a class size of 10 it falls to 17%. Reducing the class size from 40 to

204

10 also leads to a drop in the median R0 from 3.40 to 2.64 (a 22% reduction).

205

In-class NPIs lead to a modest reduction in the severity of the epidemic at all

206

class sizes (figure 2g-i), though the epdiemic remains signficiantly larger for

207

larger class sizes. Interestingly, a class size of 10 with no NPIs (peak IQR

208

14%-17%, total IQR 91%-95%) generally results in smaller epidemics than a

209

class size of 40 with NPIs (peak IQR 21%-23%, total IQR 97%-99%). Thus

210

group size limits in themselves may lead to better outcomes than many other

211

mitigation measures (given our assumptions). The combination of small class

212

sizes and the in-class NPIs can dramatically reduce the severity of the

213

epidemic. Comparing a class size of 40 without NPIs to a class size of 10 with

214

NPIs, the median peak is reduced from 32% to 8%, the median total from 99%

215

to 64% and the median R0 from 3.40 to 2.48. The class size of 10 has an

216

overlapping IQR with the class of 5 for the peak infected, but no classes

217

overlap for total infected.

218

For completeness, we also ran simulations with a finer resolution of

219

transmission coefficient, β, and recorded the median peak and total infected

220

(figure 3). At the lowest transmission (β = 0.1γ) there are no outbreaks for

221

any class size. However, as the transmission increases we clearly see the

222

increasing important of smaller class sizes, particularly in terms of total

223

numbers infected.

3.2. Small households

225

When the average houshold is reduced to 5, comparing figures 1 and 4 shows

226

that the size of the epidemic is reduced in all cases, since there is naturally less

227

mixing between individuals. When transmission is low (β = 0.2γ, figure 4a,

228

5a-c) there are no significant outbreaks for any class size. For all class sizes

229

considered the median R0 is less than 1, and the peak is lower than 5% in

230

every simulation run. All class sizes’ peak IQRs overlap with the class of 5’s

231

IQR, and classes of 40 or smaller have overlapping IQRs for total infected.

We see dramatic impacts of reducing the class size when transmission is higher

233

(β = 0.5γ, figure 4b, 5d-f). Reducing the class size from 40 to 10 reduced the

234

median R0 from 2.12 to 1.40 (a 33% dcrease). Even classes of 25 lead to

235

significant outbreaks with the bottom of the IQR being 67% for the total and

236

8% for the peak, whereas for a class size of 10 the top of the IQR is 14% for

237

total infected and 3% for the peak. Compared to the class of 5, only classes of

238

10 and 15 have an overlapping IQR for the peak infected and only classes of 10

239

overlap for total infected. We again see considerable variation in outcomes for

240

fixed class sizes, with total infected in class sizes of 20 and 25 stretching from

241

a minimum of below 10% to a maximum of above 80%.

242

When NPIs are included in the class setting (figure 4c, 5g-i), for a class size of

243

40 the median peak is reduced from 21% without the NPI to 4% with it, and

244

the median R0 from 2.12 to 1.52. These figures make it roughly equivalent to

245

a class size of 15 without NPIs. We again see that the epidemic is more severe

246

for a class size of 40 with NPIs than for a class size of 10 without (respective

247

median peaks: 4% vs 3%, median totals: 22% vs 12%, median R0 : 1.52 vs

248

1.40). Combining both smaller classes and in-class NPIs can have substantial

249

impacts: comparing a class size of 40 without NPIs to a class size of 10 with

250

NPIs, we see the median peak reduced from 21% to 3%, the median total

251

infected from 94% to 10% and median R0 from 2.12 to 1.26. Compared to the

252

class of 5, class sizes of 35 and below have overlapping IQRs for the peak, but

253

only class sizes of 10 and 15 for the total infected. We also see significant

3.3. Time in class

256

We additionally consider what happens when we alter the time in class to be

257

double (t ∈ [day + 0.4, day + 0.6]) or halved (t ∈ [day + 0.4, day + 0.45])

258

compared to above, assuming large housesholds (nh = 100) and low infection

259

rates (β = 0.2γ). Predictably, increasing the class length leads to larger

260

epidemics and decreasing it leads to smaller ones (figure 6). For the shorter

261

classes, all class sizes’ peak and total IQRs overlap with the class of 5.

262

Interestingly R0 is found to be similar for any class size, the median varying

263

only from 1.40 to 1.54. In contrast, no class sizes have overlapping IQRs for

264

total infected and only classes of 10 for peak infected when the class length is

265

doubled.

266

4. Discussion

267

As might be expected, a clear result from our model is that the smaller the

268

class size, the lesser the severity of the epidemic. For our paramater sets,

269

reducing the class size from 40 to 10 showed reductions in the median R0 of up

270

to 30%. Within that, our results suggest that ‘optimal’ class sizes across all

271

measures of epidemic severity will rarely exist. Instead, decisions may vary

272

depending on the aim, for example whether to ensure a low peak (to limit

273

pressure on health services) or a low number of total infections (to protect as

274

many individuals as possible from infection). Broadly speaking, small

275

increases in class size from small groups initially lead to only modest increases

276

in the peak of infections but rapid increases in total infections. For example,

277

for high infection rates and small households, increasing the class size just

278

from 10 to 15 led the median peak to increase from 5% to 9% but the median

279

total infected from a modest 27% to a substantial 66%. The average household

280

size and time in class also impacted the severity of outbreak, with larger

281

households and longer classes predictably increasing the potential for large

282

epidemics. In these cases small class sizes were even more essential.

283

Institutional decisions are therefore likely to depend on the desired outcome

284

and specific local conditions, and transparency of decision making will be

285

crucial.

286

If we were to trust our values here as being representative of a real university

287

(which we would caution should be in the light of the many assumptions

288

underlying the model), we would suggest that to ensure the best chance of a

289

restricted epidemic then classes should be limited to 10. In many cases this

290

would have an overlapping inter-quartile range with - and thus not be clearly

291

different to - the most cautious approach of classes of 5 for the peak and total

292

infected. Slightly larger classes - up to 25 - may prevent the peak from rising

293

too high, but will likely result in large numbers of total infections. We would

294

strongly recommend against larger class sizes than 25 based on our parameters

295

and assumptions as both peak and total infected were then consistently clearly

296

different to the most cautious case of a class of 5. In their more detailed study

297

applied to a specific institution, Brook et al (2020) similarly found that small

298

group size limits were the key NPI to reducing infection, showing that a limit

299

of 6 could reduce the effective reproductive ratio from 1.05 to 0.86, but limits

300

of 50 had almost no impact on disease spread. Similarly, Kain et al (2021)

301

found that ‘chopping off the tail’ of individual transmission distributions -

302

effectively preventing the grouping of large numbers of individuals - could be a

303

key control measure. Moreover, based on data, Brauner et al (2020) found

304

that restricting gatherings in all settings to 10 people or fewer was one of the

305

most succesful measures at reducing R0 during Covid-19. It thus appears a

306

consistent result that limiting group sizes to around 10 can be a succesful NPI

307

for slowing or even stopping epidemics.

308

The stochastic simulations reveal considerable variation in the epidemic time

309

courses, particularly for intermediate class sizes. In some cases, the maximum

310

and minimum of total infecteds in the 100 simulations spread from less than

311

20% to more than 80%. Thus while methods exist for approximating

312

individual-based models with deterministic systems of ordinary differential

313

equations (Matsuda et al, 1992; Keeling, 1999; Sharkey, 2008), we highlight

314

the importance of using stochastic simulations to appreciate the variety of

315

possible outcomes. In practice, this demonstrates that institutions may make

316

the same decisions about class sizes but experience very different epidemic

317

time courses. As such, institutions may need to consider their ‘risk appetite’

318

for organising logistically easier bigger class sizes at the risk of a large

319

epidemic. Again, though, we emphasise that limiting class sizes to 10 or fewer

320

largely prevented significant epidemics.

321

We investigated a simple case of employing non-pharmaceutical interventions

322

(NPIs) in the class setting that would reduce the infection rate by 60%. We

323

note that this would be a rather strong effect compared to estimates of NPI

324

impacts from data (Brauner et al, 2020; Chu et al, 2020). This reduction was

325

assumed to be due to simple NPIs such as social distancing but the exact

326

method was not explicitly modelled. We found that, as would be expected,

327

this led to smaller epidemics than if no NPIs were present, reducing R0 by up

328

to 25% for large class sizes. However, we consistently found that the epidemic

329

was smaller in a class size of 10 without NPIs than a class size of 40 with

330

NPIs. Given that the 60% reduction due to the NPI is already rather strong,

331

this would suggest that reducing the class size may be the most efficient

332

control measure. Both models (Brook et al, 2020) and data analysis (Brauner

333

et al, 2020) have similarly found that group size limitations was one of the

334

most effective NPIs to prevent spread of Covid-19. Of course, both reducing

335

the class size and implementing the NPI could reduce the epidemic

336

considerably, in some cases reducing the median total infected from 96% to

337

just 14% in our model.

338

As we have stated, we have relatively modest ambitions in this study of

339

exploring how the size of mixing groups (considered as classes here) impact the

340

time course of epidemics in partitioned populations. Other studies have

341

provided highly detailed analyses of models with many realistic assumptions,

342

contact networks and NPIs included (Ferguson et al, 2020; Kucharski et al,

343

2020; Firth et al, 2020; Kain et al, 2021) including in university settings (Bahl

344

et al, 2020; Brook et al, 2020; Cashore et al, 2020; Lopman et al, 2020). If our

345

study were to be applied to more realistic scenarios or to form the basis of

346

decision making, some key further additions would be necessary. There are

347

some key additions we would highlight. Firstly, we have assumed that all

348

classes occur simultaneously and that transitions are immediate. In reality

349

classes would likely be spread throughout the day and there would be

350

unavoidable mixing during transitions. Spreading the classes out would lower

351

the effective size of the household population for much of the day, potentially

352

reducing infection, while increased mixing during transitions would act

353

oppositely. Secondly we should consider additional NPIs, most importantly

354

isolation of symptomatic (and possibly asymptomatic) individuals, as have

355

been included in other models (Bahl et al, 2020; Brook et al, 2020; Cashore

356

et al, 2020; Lopman et al, 2020). Given that any sort of isolation - whether

357

due to infection or simply imposed - will reduce the degree of mixing and

358

effective population size, such an approach would clearly be expected to

359

further limit the epidemic. Also, we have assumed a closed population with no

16

360

mixing outside of households or classes and full adherence by the population.

361

We should account both for further external contacts and for additional

362

mixing between individuals due to socialising, which we would expect to

363

increase the potential for infection. We also assumed that all individuals have

364

the same transmission rate when infected, but there is likely to be individual

365

variation leading to ’super-spreaders’ (Lloyd-Smith et al, 2005) and estimates

366

from Covid-19 data suggest a high degree of super-spreading occurring (Wang

367

et al, 2020). This is likely to lead to greater variation in outcomes, with

368

super-spreading often leading to rarer but larger outbreaks (Lloyd-Smith et al,

369

2005). Further, we assume that all individuals within each household attend

370

exactly one class with the same cohort of classmates. We do not account for

371

the fact that (i) students may live in households with individuals who do not

372

attend classes (family or other friends, for example) or (ii) that students may

373

attend multiple classes. The latter in particular will lead to increased mixing

374

of the population and thus increased transmission. While these additions

375

would undoubtedly change the quantitative values found here, we would

376

expect the fundamental findings - that smaller class sizes lead to smaller

377

epidemics with less variation and that the patterns will vary according to the

378

target measure - will remain.
