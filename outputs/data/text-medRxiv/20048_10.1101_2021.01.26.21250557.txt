Abstract
The cycle thresholds (Cts) at which reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) tests for covid-19
become positive are intimately associated with both viral load, and covid-19 infectiousness (i.e., ability
to culture live virus). Clinical data indicate lower Cts—and hence larger viral loads—independently predict
greater covid-19 mortality when patients are hospitalized for symptomatic covid-19 pneumonia. We
merged public covid-19 mortality data from the Rhode Island Department of Health with a de-identified dataset
of n=5036 positive rtPCR test Cts from the Rhode Island Department of Health State Laboratory to explore the
potential relationship between positive covid-19 test Ct distribution trends, and covid-19 mortality in the state of
Rhode Island, from March through early to mid-June, 2020. Mean daily covid-19 positive test Ct data were
compiled, and 7-day rolling average covid-19 mortality was offset by 21-days, given the lag between infection
and death. We divided the Ct data into three strata, >32, 28-32, and <28, which were operationally defined as
“not infectious,” “maybe infectious,” and “infectious,” respectively. Between late March and June, mean daily Ct
values rose linearly (R-squared=0.789) so that by early June, as the covid-19 pandemic ebbed in severity, all
means reached the noninfectious (Ct >32) range. Most notably, this May-June trend for Cts was accompanied
by a marked, steady decline in Rhode Island’s daily covid-19 mortality. Our results suggest that monitoring,
and public reporting of mean population covid-19 test Cts over time is warranted to gauge the vacillations of
covid-19 outbreak severity, including covid-19 mortality trends.

Introduction
The cycle thresholds (Cts) at which reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) tests for covid-19
become positive are intimately associated with both viral load, and covid-19 infectiousness (i.e., ability to
culture live virus).1,2 An rtPCR covid-19 assay system developed at the Harvard University/ Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Broad Institute,3 currently determining covid-19 “positivity” at 108 northeastern
universities—including Rhode Island’s major colleges4—described this exponential relationship:3 “…the Ct
values correlated strongly with the logarithm of (covid-19) RNA concentration (R-squared > 0.99), with the
observed range from Ct =12 cycles to Ct = 38 cycles corresponding to viral loads ranging from ~1.9 billion
copies/mL to 8 copies/mL, respectively
Additional clinical data indicate lower Cts—and hence larger viral loads—independently predict greater covid19 mortality when patients are hospitalized for symptomatic covid-19 pneumonia, or other manifestations of
being heavily infected by the virus.5 Conversely, a study which recorded Cts of patients, serially, during their
hospitalization for diagnosed covid-19 pneumonia, reported that increasing Cts were accompanied by
decreasing disease severity (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment; SOFA) scores.6 We explored the potential
relationship between positive covid-19 test Ct distribution trends, and covid-19 mortality in the state of Rhode
Island, between March and June, 2020.
Methods
Public covid-19 mortality data from the Rhode Island Department of Health COVID-19 Data Tracker,7 were
merged with a de-identified dataset of n=5036 positive rtPCR test Cts obtained through an Access to Public
Records Act request to the Rhode Island Department of Health State Lab (RISHL). Standard rtPCR SARSCoV-2 assay methodology targeting the nucleocapsid genes N1 and N2 was employed by the RISHL.8 Mean
daily covid-19 positive test Ct data were compiled, and 7-day rolling average covid-19 mortality was offset by
21-days, given the lag between infection and death. We divided the Ct data into three strata, >32, 28-32, and
<28, which were operationally defined as “not infectious,” “maybe infectious,” and “infectious,” respectively,
consistent with prior reports1,2, including a pooled analysis of six studies1.
Results
Between late March and June, mean daily Ct values rose linearly (Figure 1.; R-squared=0.789) so that by early
June, as the covid-19 pandemic ebbed in severity, all means reached the non-infectious (>32) range. Most
notably, Figure 2. depicts how this May-June trend for Cts was accompanied by a pronounced, steady decline
in Rhode Island’s daily covid-19 mortality,
Discussion
An analysis evaluating the infectiousness of patients hospitalized with covid-19 reported that only viral loads >
10 million copies/mL, equivalent to Cts ≤ 25, were associated with isolation of infectious virus from the
respiratory tract.9 A complementary systematic review published 12/3/30 by the Oxford University Center for
Evidence-Based Medicine confirmed that covid-19 rtPCR testing patient sample Cts >30 (mean from 6-studies)
are associated with an inability to culture live virus, i.e., are non-infectious.1
Data analyzed from the United Kingdom’s National Covid-19 Infection Survey revealed a significant impact of
calendar time on the prevalence of rtPCR positives at a Ct <30: markedly fewer during mid-July to early
August, versus the month of May, through mid-June, 2020.6 Moreover, investigators from the Bronx
Montefiore Medical Center have reported lower hospital admission covid-19 rtPCR Cts were independently
associated with increased covid-19 inpatient mortality.5 Specifically, Cts <22.9 (the lowest quartile),
multivariable-adjusted for age, sex, body-mass index, hypertension, and diabetes, were associated with ~4fold greater covid-19 mortality risk, versus Cts >32.4 (the uppermost quartile).5 Using a comparable cutpoint, a
priori, i.e., Cts >32,2 we externally validated these findings by demonstrating that statewide Rhode Island
covid-19 mortality dropped precipitously from March to June, 2020, as mean covid-19 positive test Cts from our
RISHL sample rose above 32.

Conclusion
Our results suggest that monitoring, and public reporting of mean population covid-19 test Cts over time is
warranted to gauge the vacillations of covid-19 outbreak severity, including covid-19 mortality trends.
