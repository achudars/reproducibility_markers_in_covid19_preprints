Abstract
Objective
To characterise the clinical features of children and young people admitted to hospital
with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) infection in the UK, and explore factors associated with admission to critical
care, mortality, and development of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children
and adolescents temporarily related to covid-19 (MIS-C).
Design
Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time
analysis.
Setting
260 acute care hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 17th January and
5th June 2020, with a minimal follow-up time of two weeks (to 19th June 2020).
Participants
451 children and young people aged less than 19 years admitted to 116 hospitals and
enrolled into the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emergency Infections
Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK study with
laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2.
Main Outcome Measures
Admission to critical care (high dependency or intensive care), in-hospital mortality,
or meeting the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C.
Results
Median age was 3.9 years [interquartile range (IQR) 0.3-12.9 years], 36% (162/451)
were under 12 months old, and 57% (256/450) were male. 56% (224/401) were
White, 12% (49/401) South Asian and 10% (40/401) Black. 43% (195/451) had at
least one recorded comorbidity. A muco-enteric cluster of symptoms was identified,
closely mirroring the WHO MIS-C criteria.
17% of children (72/431) were admitted to critical care. On multivariable analysis this
was associated with age under one month odds ratio 5.05 (95% confidence interval

1.69 to 15.72, p=0.004), age 10 to 14 years OR 3.11 (1.21 to 8.55, p=0.022) and
Black ethnicity OR 3.02 (1.30 to 6.84, p=0.008). Three young people died (0.7 %,
3/451) aged 16 to 19 years, all of whom had profound comorbidity.
Twelve percent of children (36/303) met the WHO MIS-C criteria, with the first
patient developing symptoms in mid-March. Those meeting MIS-C criteria were
older, (median age 10.8 years ([IQR 8.4-14.1] vs 2.0 [0.2-12.6]), p<0.001) and more
likely to be of non-White ethnicity (70% (23/33) vs 43% (101/237), p=0.005).
Children with MIS-C were four times more likely to be admitted to critical care (61%
(22/36) vs 15% (40/267, p<0.001). In addition to the WHO criteria, children with
MIS-C were more likely to present with headache (45% (13/29) vs 11% (19/171),
p<0.001), myalgia (39% (11/28) vs 7% (12/170), p<0.001), sore throat (37% (10/27)
vs (13% (24/183, p = 0.004) and fatigue (57% (17/30) vs 31% (60/192), p =0.012)
than children who did not and to have a platelet count of less than 150 x109/L (30%
(10/33) vs 10% (24/232), p=0.004).

Conclusions
Our data confirms less severe covid-19 in children and young people than in adults
and we provide additional evidence for refining the MIS-C case definition. The
identification of a muco-enteric symptom cluster also raises the suggestion that MISC is the severe end of a spectrum of disease.

Introduction
Children and young people comprise only 1-2% of covid-19 cases worldwide [1–3].
In contrast to other respiratory viruses, children appear to have a lower risk of
infection than adults [4] and the vast majority of reported infections in children are
reported as mild or asymptomatic, with few recorded childhood fatalities attributed to
covid-19 [2,5–7]. Initial reports from China showed only 0.6% of children with covid19 were critically ill [5].
A severe disease phenotype has emerged in children which appears temporally
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection [8,9]. The condition was first described in
May 2020 in a cluster of children admitted to critical care in South London (UK) with
evidence of a multisystem hyperinflammatory state with features similar to Kawasaki
disease and toxic shock syndrome [8]. These children required inotropic support for
refractory circulatory shock and mechanical ventilation for cardiovascular
stabilisation rather than respiratory failure. Similar cohorts have been reported in Italy
[10]

and France [11]. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on

15th May 2020 estimated around 230 children had presented with this new syndrome
in EU/EEA countries with two fatalities [3]. Preliminary case definitions have been
proposed by the WHO [9] and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health
(RCPCH) [12]. The WHO use the term multisystem inflammatory syndrome in
children and adolescents temporarily related to covid-19 (MIS-C) while RCPCH
describe this illness as Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome temporally
associated with SARS-COV-2 (PIMS-TS).
We aimed to characterise the features of children and young people (aged less than 19
years old) admitted to hospital in the UK with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium
(ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) cohort. Since our
study enrolled patients prospectively from the beginning of the pandemic, we also had
a unique opportunity to examine the emergence, timing, risk factors, clinical
presentation, progression, course and outcomes of children and young people meeting
the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C [9].

Methods
Study design and setting
The ISARIC WHO CCP-UK is an ongoing prospective cohort study across acute care
hospitals in England, Wales and Scotland (8). This standing protocol for studying
disease caused by pathogens of public health interest was activated on 17th January
2020. The protocol, associated documents, and detail of the Independent Data and
Material Access Committee (IDAMAC) are available at https://isaric4c.net. STROBE
guidelines were used when reporting.
Participants
Patients of any age admitted to hospital with proven or high likelihood of SARSCoV-2 infection were enrolled into the ISARIC WHO CCP-UK cohort as previously
described [13]. We present the data from children and young people aged less than 19
years old on the date of hospital admission, enrolled into the study up to and including
5th June 2020, who had at least two weeks of outcome data available, and who had
documented laboratory evidence of a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 (by PCR or
serology). Patients who were already admitted for other clinical reasons and
subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 whilst an inpatient were also included
in this cohort.
Data collection
Demographic and baseline data (including comorbidities and regular medications
taken) alongside data pertaining to symptoms, clinical signs (including vital signs)
during admission, laboratory and pathology investigations, treatments received whilst
admitted and outcome were collected onto case report forms (supplement available
online). Data regarding illness progression and severity, including location within the
hospital (ward vs. critical care) were collected on day 1 (admission/diagnosis), days 3,
6, and 9, admission to critical care and on discharge/death. Data were collected from
healthcare records onto the case report forms through a secure online database,
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt University, hosted by the
University of Oxford (UK)). Collection of this routine anonymised demographic and
clinical data from medical records did not require consent in England and Wales. In
Scotland, a waiver for consent was obtained from the Public Benefit and Privacy
Panel.

The case report form was agnostic to patient age and as such existing comorbidity
variables were not tailored to the paediatric population (see Supp Methods for case
report form and recoding of paediatric variables). Ethnicity was self-reported and
transcribed from the healthcare record. The Paediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS)
was used as a measure of disease severity at admission [14].
Criteria for diagnosis of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children and
Adolescents (MIS-C)
The WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C [9] was used as a framework for
identifying children with the syndrome within this dataset (box 1).

1. Fever for 3 days or more (of any duration, self-reported prior to presentation)
2. Plus two of the following:
a. Rash or bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis or muco-cutaneous inflammatory
signs (self-reported rash / conjunctivitis)
b. Hypotension or shock (age < 2 years systolic blood pressure < 60 mmHg; ≥2
and < 5 years <70 mmHg; ≥ 5 and < 12 years <80 mmHg; ≥ 12 years < 90
mmHg at any point in admission [14])
c. Features of myocardial dysfunction, pericarditis, valvulitis, or coronary
abnormalities (diagnosis of endocarditis or myocarditis or documented
pericardial effusion, coronary artery aneurysm, cardiomegaly or cardiac
dysfunction on echocardiography)
d. Evidence of coagulopathy (INR > 1.2 (any age [15]); age ≤3 months and PT
>14s; age > 3 months and PT > 12s [16])
e. Acute gastrointestinal problems (self-reported diarrhoea, vomiting, or
abdominal pain)
3. Plus elevated markers of inflammation (CRP ≥ 60 mg/L or ferritin ≥ 200 mg/L
at any point during admission; cut offs chosen after expert discussion)
4. Plus no other obvious microbial cause of inflammation (no significant positive
growth on blood culture / cerebrospinal fluid culture during admission)

The primary outcomes of this study were critical care admission (high dependency
unit (HDU) or intensive care unit (ICU)), development of MIS-C, and in-hospital
mortality. Requirement for respiratory and cardiovascular support were also
examined. A minimum two-week follow-up time was ensured for all included
patients.
Bias
Specialist children’s hospitals (tertiary-care) with paediatric-specific research teams
may be over-represented. Capacity to enrol was also limited by staff resources at
times of high covid-19 activity, and we were unable to comment on patients not
recruited.
Missing data
The pandemic disrupted routine care and usual research activities limiting data
collection and verification, particularly during the peak of outbreak activity. We did
not impute missing data for this descriptive analysis. To reduce the impact of missing
data on outcome analyses, we restricted these analyses to patients who had been
admitted for at least two weeks before data extraction. Complete data were not
available for all variables, hence denominators differ between analyses.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are displayed as mean (standard deviation) or median
(interquartile range) if non-normally distributed. Categorical variables are presented
as a frequency (percentage) unless otherwise stated. For univariable comparisons, we
used Welch’s t, ANOVA, Mann–Whitney U, or Kruskal–Wallis tests according to
data distribution. Categorical data were compared using chi-squared tests. A p-value
of <0.05 was considered statistically significant; all tests were two sided. No
adjustment was made for multiple comparisons. Parsimonious criterion-based model
building used the following principles: relevant explanatory variables were identified
from previous studies; interactions were checked at first order level; final model
selection was informed by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and c-statistic,
with appropriate assumptions checked including the distribution of residuals.
Analysis of symptom co-occurrence was performed using the Jaccard similarity
coefficient and presented as a hierarchically ordered heatmap. Statistical analyses
were performed using R (R Core Team version 3.6.3, Vienna, Austria) with packages
including tidyverse, finalfit lubridate, ggplot2, gplot, dendextend and UpSetR.

Patient and public involvement
This was an urgent public health research study in response to a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern. Patients or the public were not involved in the
design, conduct, or reporting of this rapid response research.

Results
451 patients under 19 years with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (451/55 092,
0.8% of total cohort) were enrolled at 116 hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales
between 17 January and 5 June 2020, and 55 092 people of all ages were admitted to
260 hospitals. (Error! Reference source not found. and Supp Figures 1 and 2).
Age, sex and ethnicity
The median age of the children was 3.9 years [IQR 0.3-12.9 years] and 57%
(256/450) were male. Ethnicity was recorded in 89% (401/451) of cases: 56%
(224/401) were White, 12% (49/401) were South Asian and 10% (40/401) were of
Black ethnicity. At least one comorbidity was reported in 43% (195/451).
Symptoms
The most common presenting symptoms were fever (73%, 306/418), cough (43%,
175/408), shortness of breath (32%, 124/389) and nausea/vomiting (32%, 120/380,
Error! Reference source not found., upper panel). Fever, cough and shortness of
breath did not show an association with age, however nausea and vomiting,
abdominal pain, headache, and sore throat showed an increasing trend with age (Supp
Figure 4). A heatmap and dendrogram of presenting symptoms revealed distinct
clusters of clinical sub-phenotypes (Error! Reference source not found., lower panel).
These comprised a respiratory illness, with clustering of both upper and lower
respiratory symptoms together (light green and brown clusters) in addition to a cluster
representing a muco-enteric illness (orange clusters). The latter cluster contained the
symptoms specified in the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C (diarrhoea,
abdominal pain, vomiting, rash and conjunctivitis) in addition to fatigue and
headache. The two main clusters were not entirely dichotomous, and the muco-enteric
cluster showed some overlap with upper respiratory tract symptoms (light green
cluster), but very little overlap with the lower respiratory tract symptoms of wheeze
and lower chest wall indrawing (brown cluster).

Comorbidities
The most common comorbidities were neurological (12%, 51/419),
haematological/oncological/immunological (combined category as described in Supp
Methods, 8%, 35/420) and cardiac (7%, 31/416). Data on prematurity (defined as
being born before completion of 37 weeks gestation) was only routinely collected for
children aged under 1 year old and 22% (32/148) were premature (Supp Table 1 and
Supp Figure 3).
The median PEWS at presentation was 3 [IQR 1.0-5.0] and blood tests at presentation
were mainly within normal ranges (Supp Tables 2 and 3). Antibiotics were given to
71% (281/397) of children and 7% (26/368) received antiviral medication (22
received acyclovir and 4 received remdesivir, Table 2).

Children requiring critical care
17% of children (72/431) were admitted to critical care (ICU or HDU level care); 5%
(12/240) received inotropic support, 7% (28/408) received non-invasive ventilation
and 9% (35/408) received invasive mechanical ventilation (Tables 2, Table 3 and
Supp Figure 5). Black ethnicity was significantly associated with admission to
critical care on multivariable analysis (odds ratio (OR) 3.02 (95% confidence interval
1.30 to 6.84, p=0.008 Table 4 and Supp Table 4). On multivariable analysis, both
age under one month (OR 5.05 (1.69 to 15.72, P=0.004)) and age between 10-14
years (OR 3.11 (1.21 to 8.55, p=0.022)) were associated with admission to critical
care (reference age group 15 to 19 years), but there was no association with sex on
either univariable or multivariable analysis (Table 3, Table 4 and Supp Table 4).
On univariable analysis, children with comorbidities were more likely to be admitted
to critical care than those without (OR 1.90 (1.14 to 3.19, p=0.014) however, this no
longer reached significance in the multivariable model (OR 1.72 (0.95 to 3.26, p =
0.074). Comorbidities most commonly associated with critical care admission on
univariable analysis were prematurity (48% (11/23) critical care admissions vs 18%
(21/120) of standard care admissions, p=0.005), obesity (8% (6/71) vs 2% (7/338),
p=0.014) and gastrointestinal comorbidities (7% (5/72) vs 1% (5/342), p=0.017,
Table 3 and Supp Table 5). Children receiving critical care were more likely to have

been admitted to hospital more than 5 days before their symptoms started (indicating
likely hospital acquired infection) than those receiving ward level care (15/71 (21%)
vs 27/344 (8%) p=0.002). No association was seen between prior immunosuppressant
use and critical care admission (Error! Reference source not found.).
Children admitted to critical care were more likely to have presented with diarrhoea,
(35% (22/63) vs 12% (36/309), p <0.001), conjunctivitis (13% (8/62) vs 2% (6/285),
p=0.001) and confusion (22% (13/60) vs 7% (20/302), p=0.001) than those cared for
on a standard ward (Supp Table 6). They were objectively more unwell at
presentation than those receiving standard ward care (median PEWS of 5 [IQR 3.08.0] vs 2 [1.0-4.0], p<0.001, Supp Table 7). There were also significant differences
in haematologic, biochemical and radiologic abnormalities between the two groups at
presentation (Supp Table 8). In particular, children admitted to critical care had a
lower platelet count (median 206.5 x109/L [IQR 129.0-296.8] vs 298.0 x109/L [233.0387.0], p <0.001), a higher neutrophil count (7.5 x109/L [4.8-13.0] vs 4.6 x109/L [2.38.3], p <0.001) and higher CRP (66.0mg/L [7.0-211.3] vs 12.0mg/L [4.0-58.0],
p<0.001) at presentation than those cared for on a standard ward. Children admitted to
critical care were also more likely to have infiltrates on chest radiograph (64% (32/50)
vs 34% (38/112), p <0.001).
Patient outcomes
Overall, 83% (373/451) of children and young people were discharged alive, 0.7%
(3/451) died, and 17% (75/451) continued to receive care at the date of reporting or
were missing outcomes (Table 2).
There were no deaths in children under 16 years of age in this cohort. Three young
people died, who were 16 to 19 years. Two of these young people had profound
neurodisability with pre-existing respiratory compromise. The third young person was
immunosuppressed by chemotherapy for a haematological malignancy.

Patients meeting the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C
Twelve per cent (36/303) of children met the WHO preliminary case definition for
MIS-C (17) (Table 5 and Supp Figure 6). The first patient identified developed
symptoms in mid-March, when covid-19 cases were increasing nationally, followed

by a small number of cases identified steadily throughout the surveillance period
(Figure 2). Geographically, the highest number of children with MIS-C came from
areas with the largest covid-19 outbreaks, namely the Midlands and London (Supp
Figure 7).
Children meeting the WHO preliminary definition for MIS-C were significantly older
than those who did not (median 10.8 years [IQR 8.4-14.1] vs 2.0 [0.2-12.6], p<0.001)
and were significantly more likely to be of non-White ethnicity (70% (23/33) vs 43%
(101/237), p=0.005, Table 5). MIS-C was not associated with comorbidity (Supp
Table 9). In addition to the WHO case definition features (fever, rash, conjunctivitis
and gastrointestinal symptoms), the children with MIS-C were also more likely to
present with headache (45% (13/29) vs 11% (19/171), p<0.001), myalgia (39%
(11/28) vs 7% (12/170), p<0.001) lymphadenopathy (21% (6/29) vs 3% (6/210),
p=0.001), sore throat (37% (10/27) vs (13% (24/183), p = 0.004) and fatigue (57%
(17/30) vs 31% (60/192), p=0.012) than children who did not (Supp Table 10).
Children with MIS-C also had a higher PEWS score at presentation (median 5.5 [IQR
3.0-7.0] vs 3.0 [1.0-5.0], p<0.001) and were more likely to have reduced
consciousness (32% (10/31) vs 9% (17/200), p=0.001) than those who did not meet
the criteria (Supp Table 11 and Supp Figure 8).
Review of laboratory investigations found that children meeting the criteria for MISC were more likely to have a platelet count of less than 150 x109/L than those who did
not (30% (10/33) vs 10% (24/232), p=0.004, Supp Table 12). Children meeting the
MIS-C criteria also had lower lymphocyte counts (median 0.9 x 109/L [IQR 0.7-1.8]
vs 2.1 x 109/L [1.4-3.6], p<0.001) but higher neutrophil counts (7.8 x 109/L [5.7-12.3]
vs 5.1 x 109/L [2.3-9.3], p=0.001) and higher creatinine (57.0 μmol/L [38.0-74.8] vs
28.0 μmol/L [20.0-46.0], p<0.001) than those without (Supp Table 12).
Children with MIS-C were four times more likely to be admitted to critical care (61%
(22/36) vs 15% (40/267, p<0.001, Table 5). They were more likely to receive
intravenous corticosteroids (47%, (14/30) vs 4% (9/226) p <0.001), non-invasive
(25% (9/36) vs 6% (14/254), p=0.001) and invasive ventilation (25% (9/36) vs 9%
(22/254), p=0.007) as well as inotropic support (28% (5/18) vs 4% (6/144), p=0.003,
Table 5). There were no deaths in the MIS-C group.

Discussion
Principal Findings
There were 451 children and young people under 19 years with laboratory confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 recruited to the ISARIC WHO CCP-UK study between 17 January and
5 June 2020, accounting for 0.8% of all patients in the whole cohort at that time. The
median age of children with covid-19 was 3.9 years [IQR 0.3-12.9]. The cohort was
predominantly male (57%) and of White ethnicity (56%) with most (57%) children
having no known comorbidities. The most common presenting symptoms were fever,
cough, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting and a clear muco-enteric cluster of
symptoms was seen. Seventeen percent of hospitalised children required critical care.
Critical care admission was associated with age younger than one month, age 10 to 14
years and Black ethnicity. The in-hospital case fatality rate was strikingly low (3
patients, 0.7%) when compared with 25% (14 025 / 55 092) across all age groups in
the cohort with covid-19 for the same time period. In this paediatric cohort, 12% of
patients met the WHO preliminary criteria for MIS-C, which was associated with
older age, non-White ethnicity and admission to critical care. MIS-C cases were first
identified in mid-March when cases of covid-19 began to rise in the UK. In addition
to the clinical criteria provide by the WHO, we found children with MIS-C were more
likely to present with headache, myalgia, fatigue, sore throat and lymphadenopathy as
well as a lower platelet count than children with SARS-CoV-2 who did not meet the
MIS-C criteria.
Strengths and limitations of this study
This study is unique in that data for patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 were
collected prospectively and throughout the admission. The ISARIC WHO CCP-UK
study had previously been activated in 2016 and 2018 for cases of Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and monkeypox so was prepared for the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, allowing swift activation. Consequently, in addition to reporting the
clinical characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of covid-19 in children, this dataset
provided a unique opportunity to objectively monitor the emergence and progression
of a novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in the UK, whilst minimising recall
bias. The first patient meeting the criteria for MIS-C was identified on 19 March
2020, whilst the first published cases were reported on 6 May 2020 [8]. Comparison
with overall covid-19 cases confirms the sporadic occurrence of the MIS-C

throughout the first peak of the covid-19 pandemic in the UK. In contrast to previous
reports, our analysis was limited only to children admitted with laboratory confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 which allowed us to clearly define the picture of covid-19 in children
and reduce confounding with other potential causes.
The ISARIC WHO CCP-UK database is estimated to represent 53% of covid-19
hospitalisations across England, Wales and Scotland. It is therefore susceptible to
selection bias, particularly as tertiary centres with critical care units and specialist
children’s hospitals are more likely to have dedicated research teams, potentially
skewing the severity and age of the patients reported.
The most common presenting symptoms in children in our study (fever, cough and
dyspnoea) reflect the original case definition for SARS-CoV-2 testing in the UK,
suggesting that this paediatric cohort is likely to have been influenced by the testing
criteria.
The PEWS is validated up to 16 years of age [14]. As ranges of clinical observations
do not vary considerably between 16 and 18 year olds [17] PEWS scoring was
extended to all those under 19 years. To identify children and young people meeting
the WHO criteria for MIS-C it is necessary to have data on CRP and fever. Decisions
to measure CRP and other parameters were at physicians’ discretion. Children
missing either of these variables were excluded from this analysis.
A limitation of this study is the use of a case record form that was agnostic to age so
not specifically tailored for paediatric data collection, particularly in regard to
comorbidities. Some of this information was available in free text but these data were
incomplete. By design we are not able to differentiate between people whose
symptoms were directly attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and those who had
been admitted for other reasons and then found to be positive for the virus. The study
relied primarily on PCR testing as evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as diagnostic
serology was not widely available at the start of the pandemic. As other studies of
MIS-C report several children who are PCR-negative but have serological evidence of
infection, this could have limited early recruitment of MIS-C cases. Finally, in order
to share findings from this study promptly as an urgent public health research priority,
these analyses were performed on a cohort with ongoing data collection and missing
data, the proportion of which will decrease with time. We do not have data for

children identified as infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the community who were not
admitted to hospital, and we cannot yet report on sequelae of covid-19 in children
after discharge.
Comparison with other studies
Children and young people under 19 years accounted for 0.8% (451/55 394) of the
ISARIC WHO CCP-UK cohort on 5 June 5 2020, which is broadly consistent with
2% reported in China [1] and 1.7% in North America [2]. Our cohort of paediatric
hospitalised cases had a median age of 3.9 years which was similar to an Italian
cohort (3.3 years [18]), but younger than Chinese (6-7 years) [5,6] and North
American (11 years) cohorts [2], however these other cohorts were not limited to
hospitalised children. While respiratory presentations were most common, 35% of
children also had gastrointestinal symptoms at presentation, which is higher than 1022% reported in other paediatric literature [2,18,19]. Gastrointestinal symptoms have
also been prominent in children presenting with infection by MERS-CoV (28%) [20]
and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (30%) [21]. We also identify for
the first time a clear muco-enteric cluster of symptoms which shows some overlap
with upper, but not lower respiratory tract symptoms.
Children of Black ethnicity were over-represented, comprising 10% of our paediatric
cohort compared with 4.7% of all children under 18 years across England and Wales
[22] and 1% in Scotland [23]. This finding may also be influenced by the ethnic
composition of the population served by the sites recruiting to this study. Black
ethnicity was also associated with increased odds of admission to critical care on
multivariable analysis, consistent with reports for adult populations suggesting South
Asian and Black ethnicities are disproportionately severely affected by SARS-CoV-2
infection [24–26]. Studies of paediatric covid-19 from other countries have either
been from ethnically homogenous groups or have not reported ethnicity, making
comparisons difficult.
The critical care admission rate in our cohort was 17% compared to 10% reported in a
north American cohort of hospitalised children [2] and 13% in a multicentre cohort
study across 25 European countries [19]. As previously noted, this rate may be
elevated in our study owing to hospitals with dedicated paediatric research teams
being more likely to provide paediatric critical care. The prevalence of comorbidities

(53%) in children admitted to critical care in our cohort was also similar to that
reported in the European multicentre study countries (52% [19]). Obesity was
associated with critical care admission in our paediatric cohort, in agreement with
adult data from ISARIC WHO CCP-UK [13]. In England 20% of children are obese
by 11 years of age [27]. Childhood obesity, however, is also influenced by
deprivation [27], which was not analysed in our study. Age under 1 month was
associated with increased odds of critical care admission, in agreement with the
European cohort [19]. As previously noted, a limitation of our study was the difficulty
in differentiating between children with symptoms directly attributable to SARSCoV-2 infection and those admitted for other reasons and subsequently testing
positive for the virus. This may explain the association between age under one month
and admission to critical care, if these babies were already admitted to neonatal
intensive care and undergoing regular SARS-CoV-2 screening. Children who had
been admitted to hospital for more than 5 days prior to symptoms were also more
likely to be admitted to critical care. By definition, this group includes children with
comorbidity. SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial infections in children are not well reported
and this area requires closer scrutiny, ideally with the use of viral sequence data.
Using adapted WHO criteria [9], we identified 36 patients meeting the criteria for
multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Initial UK reports described children admitted
to hospital with circulatory shock and a hyperinflammatory state with features of
similar to toxic shock or Kawasaki disease [8]. Children fulfilling the case definition
for MIS-C have been reported in multiple regions experiencing large outbreaks of
covid-19, including England (UK) [28], Paris (France) [11], Bergamo (Italy) [10] and
New York City (USA) [29]. Ours is the first report, however, to identify cases and
timelines using a prospective national data collection strategy. MIS-C appears to be
temporally associated with covid-19 but a causal relationship remains to be
established. Older age and non-White ethnicity were associated with MIS-C in our
study, in agreement with a recent case series of 99 children with MIS-C from New
York State (USA) where 63% were of non-White ethnicity and 69% were between 6
and 20 years [29]. Children in our study with MIS-C were much more unwell than
other children with covid-19, with 28% requiring inotropic support, (compared with
20% in the Italian cohort[10], 47% in the French cohort [11] and 62% in the New
York cohort [29].

Across the whole of our paediatric cohort, we identified a distinct cluster presenting
with muco-enteric symptoms (rash, conjunctivitis, diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal
pain) in addition to headache and fatigue which overlapped very closely with the
WHO preliminary case definition [9], suggesting that children with MIS-C may be at
the severe end of this muco-enteric spectrum. The significant associations between
MIS-C and headache, myalgia, fatigue, sore throat and lymphadenopathy in our
cohort may be useful in refining the case definition. In addition, the association of
MIS-C with platelet count less than 150 x109/L and low lymphocyte counts is in
agreement with previous reports [28,29]. These important findings may assist in
differentiating this syndrome from other illnesses, particularly Kawasaki disease
where platelet counts are typically elevated.
Conclusion and policy implications
Our data confirms less severe covid-19 in children and young people with SARSCoV-2 infection than in adults. Admission to critical care was associated with age
under 1 month, age 10-14 years and Black ethnicity. In agreement with previous
reports, we find older age and non-White ethnicity to be associated with MIS-C. In
addition, we provide evidence for refining the case definition for MIS-C including an
association with low platelet count, headache, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, sore throat
and fatigue which could be incorporated into future iterations of the case definition.
The identification of a muco-enteric symptom cluster across the whole cohort also
raises the suggestion that MIS-C may be the severe end of a spectrum of disease.

Summary box

What is already known on this topic:
The literature to date has consistently reported that children are less severely affected
by SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults. Consequently, there is a less information
regarding ethnicity, comorbidities, clinical and laboratory findings in children with
SARS-CoV-2. A Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children and Adolescents
(MIS-C) temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 has been widely reported, however
all reports to date arise from retrospective cases series which are vulnerable to recall
bias.
What this study adds :
This is a large prospective cohort study of children admitted to hospital with
laboratory-confirmed covid-19 and the first with prospective recruitment to examine
MIS-C. Severe disease was rare and death exceptionally rare, and then occurred in
older children with profound co-morbidity. We find that MIS-C cases have been
present for longer than reported.
Ethnicity appears to be a factor both in critical care admission and MIS-C. This cohort
has also enabled identification of additional clinical (headache, myalgia, fatigue, sore
throat and lymphadenopathy) and laboratory characteristics (including low platelets)
which may help to refine the WHO criteria for MIS-C.

List of Figures:

Figure 1. Upper Panel – Proportion of patients presenting with each symptom.
Figure 1. Lower Panel - Heatmap with dendrogram describing the clusters of cooccurring symptoms calculated using hierarchical clustering with Jaccard distance as
metric and complete linkage. Heatmap displays the pairwise Jaccard indices among
22 symptoms. Jaccard index is a measure of similarity that computes the ratio of the
number of times two symptoms appear together in the data and the number of times
either of them appear in the data. The index varies between 0 and 1 with 0 implying
that the two symptoms never appear together (no co-occurrence), and 1 implying that
the two symptoms only appear together (co-occurrence only). The dendrogram
describing the clusters of symptoms in the heatmap was calculated using hierarchical
clustering with Jaccard distance as metric and complete linkage, where Jaccard
distance is calculated by subtracting the Jaccard index from 1. Conjunc =
conjunctivitis. Lower chest = lower chest wall indrawing. Lymp = lymphadenopathy
