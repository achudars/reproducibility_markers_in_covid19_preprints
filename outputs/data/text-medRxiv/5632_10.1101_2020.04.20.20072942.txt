Summary
Background
Public health efforts to determine population infection rates from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been hampered by limitations in testing capabilities and
the large shares of mild and asymptomatic cases. We developed a methodology that
corrects observed positive test rates for non-random sampling to estimate population
infection rates across U.S. states from March 31 to April 7.

Methods
We adapted a sample selection model that corrects for non-random testing to estimate
population infection rates. The methodology compares how the observed positive case
rate vary with changes in the size of the tested population, and applies this gradient
to infer total population infection rates. Model identification requires that variation
in testing rates be uncorrelated with changes in underlying disease prevalence. To this
end, we relied on data on day-to-day changes in completed tests across U.S. states
for the period March 31 to April 7, which were primarily influenced by immediate
supply-side constraints. We used this methodology to construct predicted infection
rates across each state over the sample period. We also assessed the sensitivity of the
results to controls for state-specific daily trends in infection rates.

Results
The median population infection rate over the period March 31 to April 7 was 0.9%
(IQR 0.64 1.77). The three states with the highest prevalence over the sample period
were New York (8.5%), New Jersey (7.6%), and Louisiana (6.7%). Estimates from mod-

els that control for state-specific daily trends in infection rates were virtually identical
to the baseline findings. The estimates imply a nationwide average of 12 population
infections per diagnosed case. We found a negative bivariate relationship (corr. =
-0.51) between total per capita state testing and the ratio of population infections per
diagnosed case.

Interpretation
The effectiveness of the public health response to the coronavirus pandemic will depend
on timely information on infection rates across different regions. With increasingly
available high frequency data on COVID-19 testing, our methodology could be used to
estimate population infection rates for a range of countries and subnational districts.
In the United States, we found widespread undiagnosed COVID-19 infection. Expansion of rapid diagnostic and serological testing will be critical in preventing recurrent
unobserved community transmission and identifying the large numbers individuals who
may have some level of viral immunity.

Introduction
In December 2019, several clusters of pneumonia cases were reported in the Chinese

city of Wuhan. By early January, Chinese scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus
(SARS-CoV-2), later named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), for which a laboratory test was quickly developed. Despite efforts at containment through travel

restrictions, the virus spread rapidly beyond mainland China. By April 7, more than
1.4 million cases had been reported in 182 countries and regions.
Our understanding of the progression and severity of the outbreak has been limited
by constraints on testing capabilities. In most countries, testing has been limited to
a small fraction of the population. As a result, the number of confirmed positive
cases may grossly understate the population infection rate, given the large numbers
of mild and asymptomatic cases that may go untested [1–5]. Moreover, testing has
often been targeted to specific subgroups, such as individuals who were symptomatic
or who were previously exposed to the virus, whose infection probability differs from
that in the overall population [6, 7].1 Given this sample selection bias, it is impossible
to infer overall disease prevalence from the share of positive cases among the tested
individuals.
A further challenge to our understanding of the spread of outbreak has been the
wide variation in per capita testing across jurisdictions due to different protocols and
testing capabilities. For example, as of April 7, South Korea had conducted three times
more tests than the United States on a per capita basis [8,9]. Large differences in testing
rates also exist at the subnational level. For example, per capita testing in the state
of New York was nearly two times higher than in neighboring New Jersey [8]. Because
the severity of sample selection bias depends on the extent of testing, these disparities
create large uncertainty regarding the relative disease prevalence across jurisdictions,
and may contribute to the wide differences in estimated case fatality rates [10, 11].
In this study, we implemented a procedure that corrects observed infection rates
among tested individuals for non-random sampling to calculate population disease
prevalence. A large body of empirical work in economics has been devoted to the
problem of sample selection and researchers have developed estimation procedures to

correct for non-random sampling [12–17]. Our methodology builds on these insights to
correct observed infection rates for non-random selection into COVID-19 testing.
Our procedure compares how the observed infection rate varied as a larger share
of the population was tested, and uses this gradient to infer disease prevalence in the
overall population. Because investments in testing capacity may respond endogenously
to local disease conditions, however, model identification requires that we find a source
of variation in testing rates COVID-19 that is unrelated to the underlying population
prevalence. To this end, we relied on high frequency day-to-day changes in completed
tests across U.S. states, which were primarily driven by immediate supply-side limitations rather than the more gradual evolution of local disease prevalence. We used this
procedure to correct for selection bias in observed infection rates to calculate population
disease prevalence across U.S. states from March 31 to April 7.

Methodology

2.1

Theory

To evaluate population disease prevalence, we developed a simple selection model
for COVID-19 testing and used the framework to link observed rates of positive tests
to population disease prevalence. We considered a stable population, denoting A and
B as the numbers of sick and healthy individuals, respectively. Let pn denote the
probability that a sick person is tested and qn the probability that a healthy person is
tested, given a total number of tests, n. Thus, we have:

n = pn A + qn B,

and the number of positive tests is:

s = pn A.

This simple framework highlights how non-random testing will bias estimates of the
population disease prevalence. Using Bayes’ rule, we can write the relative probability
of testing as the following:
qn
P r(sick|n)/P r(healthy|n)
=
,
pn
P r(sick|tested, n)/P r(healthy|tested, n)
which is equal to one if tests are randomly allocated, P r(sick|tested, n) = P r(sick|n).
When testing is targeted to individuals who are more likely to be sick, we have
P r(sick|tested, n) > P r(sick|n) and P r(healthy|tested, n) < P r(healthy|n), so the
ratio will fall between zero and one. In this scenario, the ratio of sick to healthy people


in the sample, pn A qn B, will exceed the ratio in the overall population, A B.
We specified the following functional form for the relative probability of testing:
1
qn
=
,
pn
1 + e−a−bn

(1)

which is in [0,1] for −a − bn ≤ 0. The term e−a−bn > 0 reflects the fact that testing
has been targeted towards higher risk populations, with the intercept, −a, capturing
the severity of selection bias when testing is limited. Meanwhile, the coefficient b >
0 identifies how selection bias decreases with n as the ratio qn /pn approaches one.
Intuitively, as testing expands, the sample will become more representative of the
overall population, and the selection bias will diminish.

the state population. The term ui,t is an error which we assumed to follow a Gaussian
distribution with mean zero and unknown variance. We restricted the model to a cubic
approximation of the function in equation (4), since higher order terms were found to
be statistically insignificant. This approximation is supported by graphical evidence
depicted below. We estimated equation (4) by maximum likelihood.
For model identification, we required that day-to-day changes in the number of tests
be uncorrelated with the error term, ui,t . In practice, this assumption implies that daily
changes in underlying population disease prevalence cannot be systematically related
to day-to-day changes in testing. Our identification assumption is supported by at least
three pieces of evidence. First, severe constraints on state testing capacity have caused
a significant backlog in cases, so that changes in the number of daily tests primarily
reflects changes in local capacity rather than changes in demand for testing. Second,
because our analysis focuses on high frequency day-to-day changes in outcomes, there is
limited scope for large evolution in underlying disease prevalence. Finally, in robustness
exercises, we augmented the basic model to include state fixed effects, thereby allowing
for state-specific exponential growth in underlying disease prevalence from one day to
the next. These additional controls did not alter the main empirical findings.
To recover estimates of population infection rates, P̂i,t , in state i at date t, we
combined the estimates from equation (4) and set n = popi according to the following

Data

The analysis was based on daily information on total tests results (positive plus
negative) and total positive test results across U.S. states for the period March 31
to April 7. These data were obtained from the COVID Tracking Project, a site that
was launched by journalists from The Atlantic to publish high-quality data on the
outbreak in the United Stated [8]. The data were originally compiled primarily from
state public health authorities, occasionally supplemented by information from news
reporting, official press conferences, or message from officials released on facebook or
twitter. We focused on the recent period to limit errors associated with previous
changes in state reporting practices. We supplemented this information with data on
total state population from the census [18].

Results
Table 1 (Model 1) reports the estimated coefficients from equation (4). Model 2

and Model 3 present the estimation results from models with state fixed effects (Model
2), and for the subsample of state-day observations with a positive test ratio smaller
than 0.5 (Model 3).
Figure 1 depicts the relationship between daily changes in the positive test rate and
per capita testing, based on the relationship implied by equation (4), estimated across
states for the period March 31 to April 7. Because β̂ is negative, the upward sloping
pattern implies a negative relationship between daily changes in testing and the share
of positive tests. A symptom of selection bias is that variables that have no structural
relationship with the dependent variable may appear to be significant [13]. Thus, these
patterns strongly suggest non-random testing, since daily changes in testing should be

unrelated to population disease prevalence except through a selection channel.3
Table 2 reports the results that adjust observed COVID-19 case rates for nonrandom testing based on the procedure described in Section 2. For reference, column
(1) reports the observed positive test rate on April 7, 2020. Columns (2) and (3) report
the adjusted rates for April 7 along with 95 percent confidence interval. The results
suggest widespread undiagnosed cases of COVID-19. Estimated population prevalence
ranged from 0.3 percent in Wyoming to 7.6 percent in New Jersey. To put these
estimates in perspective, in New York state, which had conducted the most extensive
testing in the nation, 0.7 percent of the population had tested positive for COVID-19
by April 7. Our estimates imply that 34 states had population case rates that exceeded
the observed prevalence in New York.
Table 2, col. (4) reports the average estimated population prevalence for the period
March 31 to April 7. These averages mitigate sampling error in the daily prevalence
estimates, which depend on the observed share of positive tests on any particular day.
The average estimates are similar to the April 7 estimates, albeit generally smaller in
magnitude, suggesting continued spread of the disease in many states.
In Table 3, we examined the robustness of the main estimates. To begin, we estimated modified versions of equation (4) that include state fixed effects. These models
allow for an exponential trend in infection rates, thereby addressing concerns that underlying disease prevalence may evolve from one day to the next. We allowed each
state to have its own specific intercept to capture the fact that the trends may differ
depending on the local conditions. The results (reported in cols. 2 and 7) are virtually
identical to the baseline estimates. Moreover, the augmented model tends to produce
more precise confidence intervals.
3

To the extent that day-to-day changes in testing responded endogenously to changes in disease
prevalence, we might actually expect this relationship to be positive. In this scenario, our estimates
should be interpreted as a lower bound for sample selection bias.

We explored the sensitivity of the results to excluding days in which a large fraction
of tests were positive. This specification addresses concerns that the functional form of
the estimating equation may differ in settings in which the share of positive was large,
due to the approximation in equation (2). We restricted the sample to observations
in which fewer than 50% of tests were positive, and re-estimated equation (4). Table
3, cols. 5,6,9 report the results. Although the sample size is reduced, the predicted
infection rates are similar in magnitude to the baseline estimates and have similar
confidence intervals.
In Table 4, we explored the relationship between the number of diagnosed cases
and total population COVID-19 infections implied by our estimation procedure. We
compared the average population infection rates from March 31 to April 7 to the total
number of diagnosed cases by April 12. Because many individuals may not seek testing
until the onset of symptoms, the latter date was chosen to capture the virus’s typical
five day incubation period [19, 20]. Column (1) reports the total diagnosed cases by
April 12; column (2) reports the total number of COVID-19 cases implied by the
estimates reported in Table 2 (col. 4); and column (3) presents the ratio of total cases
to diagnosed cases.
The results reveal widespread undetected population infection. Nationwide, we
found that for every identified case there were 12 total infections in the population.
There were significant cross-state differences in these ratios. In New York, where more
than two percent of the population had been tested, the ratio of total cases to positive
diagnoses was 8.7, the lowest in the nation. Meanwhile, Oklahoma had the highest
ratio in the country (19.4), and tested less than 0.6 percent of its population.
Figure 2 presents a bivariate scatter plot between the ratio of total COVID-19 cases
per diagnosis and cumulative per capita testing by April 12. The negative relationship
(corr = -0.51) indicates that relative differences in state testing do not simply reflect a

response to geographic differences in pandemic severity. Instead, the patterns suggest
that states that expanded testing capacity more broadly were better able to track
population prevalence.
Figure 3 documents a positive relationship between per capita COVID-19 diagnoses
and population prevalence. The similarity between these two series is notable, given
that our estimates were derived from an entirely different source of variation from the
cumulative case counts. Nevertheless, observed case counts do not perfectly predict
overall population prevalence. For example, despite similar rates of reported positive
tests, Michigan had roughly twice as many per capita infections as Rhode Island.
These differences can partly be explained by the fact that nearly two percent of the
population in Rhode Island had been tested by April 12, whereas fewer than one
percent had been tested in Michigan. Together, these findings suggest that differences
in state-level policies towards COVID-19 testing may mask important differences in
underlying disease prevalence.

Discussion
The high proportion of asymptomatic and mild cases coupled with limitations in

laboratory testing capacity has created large uncertainty regarding the extent of the
COVID-19 outbreak among the general population. As a result, key elements of virus’
clinical and epidemiological characteristics remain poorly understood. This uncertainty
has also created significant challenges to policymakers who must trade off the potential
benefits from non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed at curbing local transmission
against their substantial economic and social costs.
A number of recent studies have sought to estimate COVID-19 disease prevalence
and mortality in the United States and internationally [21–26]. One approach has

been based on variants of the Susceptible Infectious Removed (SIR) model, in which
parameters are “calibrated” to the specific characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
to estimate current and future infections. A challenge for this approach is the large
uncertainty regarding the relevant parameter values for the virus, and the fact that the
parameter values will evolve as societies take different measures to reduce transmission.
Other research has relied on Bayesian modelling to infer past disease prevalence from
observed COVID-19 deaths, and apply SIR models to forecast current infection rates.
This approach requires fewer assumptions regarding the underlying parameter values.
Nevertheless, because these models ‘scale up’ observed deaths to estimate population
infections, small differences in the assumed case fatality will have substantial effects
on the results. This poses a challenge for estimation, given that there is considerable
uncertainty regarding the case fatality rate, which may vary widely across regions due to
local demographics and environmental conditions [27–31]. Moreover, to the extent that
there is significant undercounting in the number of COVID-19 related deaths [32, 33],
these estimates may fail to capture the full extent of population infection.
In this paper, we developed a new methodology to estimate population disease
prevalence when testing is non-random. Our approach builds on a standard econometric technique that have been used to address sample selection bias in a variety of
different settings. Our estimation strategy offers several advantages over existing methods. First, the analysis has minimal data requirements. The three variables used for
estimation – daily infections, daily number of tests, and total population – are widely
reported across a large number of countries and subnational districts. Second, the
model identification is transparent and depends only on a simple exclusion restriction
assumption that daily changes in the number of conducted tests must be uncorrelated
with underlying changes in population disease prevalence. This assumption is likely to
hold in many jurisdictions where constraints on capacity are a primary determinant of

testing.
We used this framework to estimate disease prevalence across U.S. states. We
estimated substantial population infection that exceeded the observed rates of positive
tests by factors of 8 to 19. These results are consistent with recent evidence suggesting
that there may be widespread undetected infection across many regions of the U.S. [26].
Our findings are comparable to previous studies on U.S. population prevalence that
find ratios of population infection to positive tests ranging from 5 to 10 by mid-March
[22, 25]. Despite a dramatic expansions in testing capacity in the intervening weeks,
the vast majority of COVID-19 cases remain undetected.
Our results are comparable to recent estimates of population prevalence in a number
of European countries [21]. We found a nationwide 1.9 percent infection rate in early
April, which is similar to the estimated prevalence in Austria (1.1%), Denmark (1.1%),
and the United Kingdom (2.7%) as of March 28. Meanwhile, Germany’s 0.7% infection
rate would rank in the lowest tercile of prevalence among U.S. states. The highest rates
of infection in New York (8.5%), New Jersey (7.6%), and Louisiana (6.7%) are still lower
than the estimated rates in Italy (9.8%) and Spain (15%). Given the rapidly expanding
availability of high frequency testing data at both the national and subnational level,
in future research we plan to apply this methodology to compare infection rates across
a broader spectrum of countries.
There are several limitations to our study, which should be taken into account when
interpreting the main findings. First, the estimation results depend on several functional form assumptions including a constant exponential growth rate in new infections
and the specific functions governing how the number of available tests affect individual
testing probability. As more data on testing become available, the increased sample
sizes will allow future studies to impose weaker functional form assumptions through
either semi- or non-parametric approaches. Second, our analysis required an assump13

tion that the underlying sample selection process was similar across observations. To
the extent that decisions regarding who to test, conditional on the number of available
tests, diverged across states or changed within states over the sample period, our model
may be misspecified. Finally, our analysis depends on the quality of diagnostic testing,
and systematic false negative test results may affect the population disease prevalence
estimates [34–36].4
As countries continue to struggle against the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, informed policymaking will depend crucially on timely information on infection rates
across different regions. Randomized population-based testing can provide this information, however, given the constraints on supplies, this approach has largely been
eschewed in favor of targeted testing towards high risk groups. In this paper, we
developed a new approach to estimate population disease prevalence when testing is
non-random. The estimation procedure is straightforward, has few data requirements,
and can be used to estimate disease prevalence at various jurisdictional levels.

Provided that the rates of misdiagnosis were unrelated to the number of tests, these errors will
not bias the coefficient estimates, but may reduce precision through classical measurement error [37].

Figure 2: Testing and Population COVID-19 Infection Rates across States

(a) Per Capita Testing and Total COVID-19 Cases per Diagnosis

(b) Diagnosed Cases and Total COVID-19 Cases
Notes: (a) This figure presents the bivariate relationship between per capita testing and the ratio of total COVID-19
cases per diagnosis. Tests per 1,000 population are based on the cumulative number of tests by April 12. The ratio
is the total number of COVID-19 cases, derived from the average estimated population prevalence from March 31
to April 7, divided by the cumulative number of positive tests by April 12. (b) This figure presents the bivariate
relationship between log positive tests per capita and log total COVID-19 cases per capita. Positive tests per 1,000
population are based on the cumulative number of positive tests by April 12. The total number of COVID-19 cases
is derived from the average estimated population prevalence from March 31 to April 7.

Notes: Columns (1) to (6) report the estimates and heteroskedasticity robust 95% confidence intervals for population prevalence
of COVID-19 on April 7 based on the methodology described in Section 2. Columns (7) to (9) report the the average estimates
for population prevalence of COVID-19 from March 31 to April 7. Columns (3), (4) and (8) report results based on models that
include state fixed effects. Columns (5), (6), and (9) report results based on models that restrict the sample to observations
for which the share of positive cases was less than 0.5. In cases of incomplete testing data on April 7, population prevalence is
reported for the closest day: * indicates prevalence on April 6, ** indicates prevalence on April 5, and *** indicates prevalence
on March 31.

Notes: This table reports the estimation of the coefficients from Equation (4).
Model 1 presents the baseline results for the full sample. Model 2 reports
the results with additional state fixed effects controls. Model 3 restricts the
sample to observations for which the share of positive cases was less than 0.5.
Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors are reported in parentheses.
