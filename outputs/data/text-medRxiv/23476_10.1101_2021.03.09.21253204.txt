Abstract
The emergence SARS-CoV-2 P.1 lineage has been coincidental with a rapid growth in
hospitalization in the northern region of Brazil. An exponential growth of severe COVID-19
occurred in Rio Grande do Sul state, Southern Brazil in February-2021. Whole-genome
sequencing revealed that the previously undetected P.1 lineage accounted for 88.9% of
specimens collected from patients at a referral COVID-19 hospital. These findings raise
concerns regarding a possible association between lineage P.1 and rapid growth in cases and
hospitalizations.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, P.1 lineage, COVID-19

The state of Amazonas, Northern Brazil, has been hit hardest by COVID-19 among all regions
in the country. The first wave was mostly driven by lineage B.1.195, which was subsequently
replaced by B.1.1.28 [1]. A second wave with striking exponential growth in hospitalizations and
deaths has been observed since mid-December 2020, and has been shown to coincide with the
emergence of the P.1 variant of concern (VOC), which was first detected in a Brazilian traveler
from Amazonas to Japan on January 2, 2021 [2]. Rio Grande do Sul (RS) is the southernmost
Brazilian state. With a population of 11,422,973 and land borders with Uruguay and Argentina, it
was one of the least affected states during the first wave (early July–September 2020), although
the toll increased markedly from early November to late December 2020 [3]. A previous study
conducted in the municipality of Esteio, RS, from May to October 2020 revealed that the most
common lineages were B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.248 [4]. Genomic surveillance by the central state
laboratory confirmed the predominance of these lineages across RS, following a distribution
similar to that observed in other Brazilian states, but revealed that lineage P.2, first detected in
October 2020, had been gradually replacing these as the predominant variant as of 31 January
2021 [5]. Lineage P.1 was first detected in a single clinical specimen (of 23 collected in the year
2021 to date) obtained on 01 February 2021 from a resident of Gramado, a popular tourist
destination in RS, who however had no history of travel or contact with returning travelers from
Northern Brazil [6].
Since epidemiological week 6, starting 07 February 2021, RS has witnessed exponential growth
of hospitalizations for COVID-19, from 1738 inpatients on 07 February to 6995 on 06 March—a
3.8-fold increase in the number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (Figure 1), resulting in
collapse of the regional health system. Since community transmission of lineage P.1 was
documented in a highly visited RS municipality one week before the exponential increase in
hospitalizations (Figure 1), we decided to investigate whether the P.1 VOC could be detected in
specimens from patients hospitalized on February 2021 and compare our findings with
specimens obtained in January 2021 and the previous year from a large tertiary care center in
the state capital, Porto Alegre, which has been designated as a COVID-19 referral center.
Of 337 specimens obtained from hospitalized patients or hospital workers in February 2021 and
307 obtained in January 2021, 27 (8.0%) and 15 (4.9%), respectively, were selected for
genomic analysis based on cycle threshold (Ct) values (lower values were selected) of the RTqPCR (https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download) and patient age (specimens from younger
patients were preferred). Of 3224 specimens obtained in 2020, 26 (0.81%) were randomly
selected among those with lower Ct values.
Sequencing libraries were prepared with the CleanPlex SARS-CoV-2 panel (Paragon
Genomics, Inc, Hayward, CA, USA) protocol for target enrichment and library preparation,
following manufacturer instructions (https://www.paragongenomics.com/wpcontent/uploads/2020/03/UG4001-01_-CleanPlex-SARS-CoV-2-Panel-User-Guide.pdf). The
resulting libraries were pooled in equimolar amounts and were 250bp-paired-end readsequenced in an Illumina MiSeq sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Consensus

sequences were generated by the QIASeq SARS-CoV-2 pipeline (QIAGEN CLC Genomics
Workbench 21). We obtained 68 whole genomes with high quality (coverage >80%, <10% N,
>29.5 Kb). The lineages were classified using pangolin (accessed on 28-02-2021) [7]. The
sequences were deposited into GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/)
Of 27 specimens obtained in February 2021, 24 (88.9%) were identified as lineage P.1, versus
one (6.7%) of 15 specimens obtained in January 2021. Data regarding the P.1 specimens are
listed in Table 1. Thirteen patients (46.4%) were 20 to 29 years old, five (17.8%) were 30-39,
four (14.3%) were 50-59, two (7.1%) were 40-49, two (7.1%) were 60-69, and two (7.1%) were
children under 2.
The other three specimens from February 2021 were identified as lineages B.1.1.28 (n=2) and
B.1.1.143 (n=1). The lineages identified in January and February 2021 and throughout 2020 are
listed in Table 2. Among the 68 sequenced specimens, 43 (63.2%) and 25 (35.8%) were from
inpatients and outpatients, respectively; there was no significant difference in proportion of the
specimen recovery setting across the periods of study (P=0.46; chi-square test).
As a post-hoc analysis, we also compared the Ct values of the N1 and N2 targets across the
12-month period of the study. Ct values in February 2021 were the lowest observed in the
period (mean, 21.11; 95%CI, 20.39-21.84; P=0.14; and 22.01; 95%CI, 21.23-22.78; P<0.001,
for N1 and N2 targets, respectively; one-way ANOVA; Figure 2).
Until January 2021, the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages observed in patients treated at our
COVID-19 referral center was similar to that observed in regional reports, which tended to follow
the distribution of most Brazilian regions, except for the North, where lineage P.1 had been
predominant since December [5,8]. In February 2021, however, an overwhelming increase in
hospitalizations has been observed since epidemiological week 6, coinciding temporally with the
finding that lineage P.1 became predominant, accounting for the vast majority of specimens
selected for genotyping in this period.
Since the hospitalization dynamics observed in Rio Grande do Sul resemble those noted in
December in the Northern states, where P.1 vastly predominated among tested specimens, we
hypothesize that P.1 might be at least partially associated with the striking rise in hospitalization
in Rio Grande do Sul. Previous findings suggesting that P.1 may be more transmissible than
other lineages corroborate our hypothesis [1,8,9]. Social behavior and the lack of strict COVID19 control measures in RS, as in other Brazilian states, might have been the perfect scenario
for dissemination of a more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 VOC.
Our data have limitations and must be interpreted accordingly. First, our sample comprises
patients from a single referral center, and the specimens were chosen by convenience; thus,
they should not be interpreted as a prevalence study for our region. Nonetheless, it should be
noted that the criteria for specimen selection of isolates from January (one P.1) and February

2021 (24 P.1) were the same. Second, although consistent with previous findings [1,9], the
lower Ct values observed in February must be interpreted with caution, because Ct values were
not adjusted for time from onset of symptoms.
In summary, our findings raise concerns regarding a possible association between lineage P.1
and rapid growth in cases and hospitalizations. Despite the relatively low number of specimens
analyzed, the finding that the previously undetected P.1 lineage now accounts for almost 90%
of specimens from a COVID-19 referral hospital in a state where exponential growth in
hospitalizations has been observed warrants close attention and highlights the need for VOC
surveillance. Further studies are necessary to investigate the potential association of P.1
dissemination with rapid increase in hospitalizations.

Figure 1. Number of hospitalized patients, cases, and deaths in Rio Grande do Sul,
April 12, 2020–present. From epidemiological week 06-2021 (February 7-16, 2021) through
week 09-2021 (February 28-March 6, 2021), the total number of hospitalized patients with a
positive diagnostic test for COVID-19 exhibited exponential growth, with an average doubling
time of 13.4 days and a daily growth rate of 5.29%. In the same period, similarly exponential
growth (doubling time 13.3 days, daily growth rate 5.35%) was observed for hospitalizations in
the city of Porto Alegre, where most P.1 specimens were found (not shown in figure). Note that
cases and deaths for epidemiological weeks 08-2021 and 09-2021 are not final and are subject
to increase due to the lag in reporting.

Figure 2. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of N1 and N2 targets in RT-qPCR performed at
Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre from March 2020 to February 2021. Ct values of N1
and N2 were lowest in specimens from February (mean, 21.11; 95% Confidence Interval, 20.3921.84; P=0.14 and 22.01; 95% Confidence Interval, 21.23-22.78; P<0.001, respectively) when
P.1 lineage was detected in 24 (88.9%) of 27 specimens.
