Abstract

22

The capacity of antibodies to engage with innate and adaptive immune cells via the

23

Fc region is important in preventing and controlling many infectious diseases, and is

24

likely critical in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The evolution of such antibodies during

25

convalescence from COVID-19 is largely unknown. We developed novel assays to

26

measure Fc-dependent antibody functions against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-expressing

27

cells in serial samples from a cohort of 53 subjects primarily with mild-moderate

28

COVID-19, out to a maximum of 149 days post-infection. We found that S-specific

29

antibodies capable of engaging dimeric FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa decayed linearly over

30

time. S-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-

31

dependent phagocytosis (ADP) activity within plasma declined linearly as well, in line

32

with the decay of S-specific IgG. Although there was significant decay in S-specific

33

plasma ADCC and ADP activity, they remained readily detectable by all assays in 94%

34

of our cohort at the last timepoint studied, in contrast with neutralisation activity which

35

was only detectable in 70% of our cohort by the last timepoint. Our results suggest

36

that Fc effector functions such as ADCC and ADP could contribute to the durability of

37

SARS-CoV-2 immunity, particularly late in convalescence when neutralising

38

antibodies have waned. Understanding the protective potential of antibody Fc effector

39

functions is critical for defining the durability of immunity generated by infection or

40

vaccination.

Introduction

42

Most individuals who recover from COVID-19 develop binding and neutralising

43

antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (1, 2), with neutralising

44

antibody responses generally targeted to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S (3).

45

Passive transfer of neutralising monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can protect animal

46

models from subsequent SARS-CoV-2 challenge (4-6), suggesting neutralisation is

47

likely to be a correlate of protection in humans (7). However, the duration of protection

48

from re-infection in humans conferred by neutralising antibodies is not known. Several

49

studies now show neutralising antibodies decline rapidly during early convalescence

50

(2, 8, 9), with the magnitude of the antibody response positively correlating with

51

disease severity (10, 11). Following mild COVID-19, many subjects mount modest

52

neutralising antibody responses that decline to undetectable levels within 60 days,

53

despite the maintenance of S- and RBD-specific IgG binding antibodies (10). Given

54

that reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 re-infection have been rare to date, it is likely that

55

immune responses beyond neutralisation contribute to SARS-CoV-2 protective

56

immunity. Apart from direct virus neutralisation, antibodies can also mediate antiviral

57

activity such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-

58

dependent phagocytosis (ADP) by engaging Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) on NK cells

59

or phagocytes. Fc effector functions contribute to the prevention and control of other

60

viral infections including HIV-1, influenza and Ebola (12-14). Butler et al. recently

61

showed that SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies within plasma could crosslink Fcγ

62

receptors, and mediate ADP and antibody-dependent complement deposition (15).

63

Importantly, two recent challenge studies demonstrated that certain RBD-specific

64

mAbs rely on Fc effector functions to mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2 in mice

65

(16, 17).

66
67

We previously reported that binding antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S exhibit substantially

68

longer half-lives than the neutralising antibody response (8), suggesting that Fc-

69

mediated antibody function may extend the protective window beyond that inferred

70

from neutralising activity alone. At present, analyses of Fc-mediated functions of

71

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within COVID-19 convalescent subjects have focussed upon

72

cross-sectional analyses or short-term longitudinal studies up to 1-2 months post-

73

symptom onset (15, 18, 19). We extend these findings and analyse Fc effector

74

functions mediated by S-specific antibodies in a cohort of 53 convalescent individuals

75

up to 149 days post-symptom onset. We developed novel functional assays using

76

SARS-CoV-2 S-expressing cells to comprehensively analyse plasma ADCC and ADP

77

activity against SARS-CoV-2 S. Our results show that plasma ADCC and ADP activity

78

decay over the first 4 months post-infection, mirroring the decline in S-specific IgG

79

titres. Importantly, however, S-specific antibodies capable of Fc-mediated antiviral

80

activity remain readily detectable in almost all donors out to 4 months post-infection,

81

even in donors whose neutralising antibody responses have waned to undetectable

82

levels. Consequently, S-specific IgG could potentially mediate Fc-dependent effector

83

functions that contribute to protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection even in the absence

84

of plasma neutralising activity.

Results

86

Decay of dimeric FcγR-binding S and RBD-specific antibodies

87

We collected repeated (2-4) longitudinal samples from a cohort of 53 subjects after

88

recovery from COVID-19 (Fig 1A, Table S1). The first sample was collected at a

89

median of 41 days post-symptom onset (IQR 36-48) while the last sample was

90

collected at a median of 123 days post-symptom onset (IQR 86-135). The engagement

91

of dimeric recombinant soluble FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIa proteins by antibodies mimics

92

the immunological synapse required for FcγR activation of innate immune cells, and

93

is a surrogate measure of ADCC and ADP respectively (20, 21). To determine the

94

dynamics of Fc-mediated function in plasma samples over time, we measured the

95

capacity of dimeric FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIa receptors to engage antibodies specific for

96

SARS-CoV-2 S antigens (trimeric S, S1 or S2 subunits or the RBD; Table S2). Using

97

mixed-effects modelling, we assessed the fit of single-phase or two-phase decay in

98

FcγR-binding between the timepoints analysed. We found that dimeric FcγRIIIa

99

(V158)-binding antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S and RBD both had single-

100

phase decay kinetics with half-lives (t1/2) of 175 and 95 days respectively (Fig. 1B-C).

101

Dimeric FcγRIIa (H131) binding-antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S and RBD

102

also decayed constantly with t1/2 of 175 and 74 days respectively. Kinetics of decay

103

for dimeric FcγR-binding antibodies against S and RBD for the lower affinity

104

polymorphisms of FcγRIIIa (F158) and FcγRIIa (R131) were broadly similar to their

105

higher affinity counterparts (Fig. S1A), with dimeric FcγR-binding antibodies against

106

RBD decaying faster than for S. Consistent with our previous report that S1-specific

107

IgG decays faster than S2-specific IgG(8), FcγR binding activity with antibodies

108

against the S1 subunit decayed faster than that of S2 (FcγRIIIa, t1/2 of 84 vs 227 days;

109

FcγRIIa, t1/2 of 65 vs 317 days; Fig. S1B).

110
111

Decay of S-specific ADCC

112

ADCC could play a role in eliminating cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. We generated

113

Ramos- and A549-derived cell lines as model target cells that stably express

114

membrane-localised S with either mOrange2 or luciferase reporters (Fig. S2A-B). The

115

capacity of plasma IgG to recognise S was measured in 36 subjects in our cohort who

116

had at least 60 days between the first and last visits (median of 89 days between first

117

and last visits; Table S1) and 8 seronegative controls. Using a Ramos cell line

118

expressing high levels of S (Ramos S-Orange) (Fig. S2C), we find IgG binding to cell-

119

surface displayed S proteins decayed significantly between the first and last visits

120

(p<0.0001; Fig. S2C) with a half-life of 97 days (Fig. S3). These results are consistent

121

with the decay of S-specific IgG titres we observed previously (8) and the decay of

122

dimeric FcγR-binding antibodies against S in Fig 1B.

123
124

As a surrogate measure of ADCC, we next used FcγRIIIa reporter cells to quantify the

125

capacity of S-specific antibodies in plasma to engage cell surface FcγRIIIa and

126

activate downstream NF-κB signalling (measured by induced nano-luciferase

127

expression in the FcγRIIIa reporter cells) (Fig. 2A, Fig. S4A). FcγRIIIa activity decayed

128

significantly over time (p<0.0001; Fig. 2C) with a half-life of 119 days (Fig. S3), and

129

was correlated with S-specific IgG titres measured using stably transduced cells or by

130

binding to dimeric FcγRIIIa (Fig. 2D). To confirm antibody recognition could mediate

131

killing of S-expressing cells, we quantified the loss of cellular luciferase signal in

132

Ramos S-luciferase target cells in the presence of convalescent plasma and primary

133

human NK cells (Fig. 2B, Fig. S4B). S-specific ADCC decayed significantly over time

134

(p<0.0001; Fig. 2E) with a half-life of 105 days (Fig. S3), and correlated with both cell-

135

associated S-specific IgG and dimeric FcγRIIIa-binding antibodies against S (Fig. 2F).

136
137

Decay of S-specific ADP

138

As has been suggested for SARS-CoV, ADP could play a role in eliminating antibody-

139

opsonised virions (22). We first used a well-established ADP assay (23) to measure

140

antibody-mediated uptake of S-conjugated fluorescent beads into THP-1 monocytes

141

(Fig. 3A; gating in Fig. S5A-B and optimisation in Fig. S6A-C). ADP of S-conjugated

142

beads was detected in all 36 subjects at the first time point studied but decayed

143

significantly over time (p<0.0001; Fig. 3C) with a half-life of 263 days (Fig. S3). ADP

144

of S-conjugated beads correlated with cell-associated S-specific IgG and S-specific

145

dimeric FcγRIIa-binding antibodies (Fig. 3D).

146
147

In addition to uptake of antibody-opsonised virions, phagocytes could also potentially

148

mediate clearance of infected cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S on the cell surface.

149

THP-1 cells have been shown to mediate both trogocytosis (sampling of plasma

150

membrane fragments from target cells that can lead to cell death) and phagocytosis

151

via antibody Fc-FcγR interactions with target cells (24-26). As such, we measured the

152

FcγR-dependent association of THP-1 cells with Ramos S-orange cells following

153

incubation with plasma from convalescent individuals or uninfected controls (Fig. 3B;

154

gating in Fig. S5C and optimisation in Fig. S6D-F). Association of THP-1 cells with

155

Ramos S-orange cells was detected in all subjects at the first time point but decayed

156

significantly over time (p<0.0001; Fig. 3E) with a half-life of 351 days (Fig. S3),

157

correlating with IgG binding to cell-associated S and S-specific dimeric FcγRIIa-

158

binding antibodies (Fig. 3F).

Cross-reactivity with HCoV S-specific antibodies

161

Cross-reactive antibodies between endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) and SARS-

162

CoV-2 have been widely reported (27, 28), suggesting past exposure to HCoVs may

163

prime ADCC and ADP immunity against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, several studies

164

have shown back-boosting of antibodies against endemic human coronaviruses

165

(HCoV) following infection with SARS-CoV-2 (29, 30), likely due to the recall of pre-

166

existing B cell responses against conserved regions of S. We thus determined whether

167

IgG antibodies against S from four HCoV strains (OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63)

168

(Table S2) were boosted in COVID-19 convalescent subjects compared to uninfected

169

healthy controls. We found that COVID-19 convalescent subjects had increased IgG

170

antibodies against S from the betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 (that are more

171

closely related to SARS-CoV-2) at the first timepoint sampled compared to uninfected

172

controls (Fig S7), while there was no difference in IgG levels against S from the

173

alphacoronaviruses 229E and NL63. Correspondingly, the elevated IgG against OC43

174

and HKU1 S decayed over time while IgG against 229E and NL63 S remained stable

175

(Fig 4A). We then measured whether dimeric FcγR-binding antibodies against HCoV

176

S antigens in COVID-19 convalescent individuals declined over time. Dimeric FcγR-

177

binding antibodies against OC43 and HKU1 S antigens were much higher in COVID-

178

19 convalescent individuals than in healthy controls and decayed more rapidly over

179

time compared to that against 229E and NL63 (Fig. 4A, Fig S8A-C). While there was

180

an overall decay of dimeric FcγR-binding antibodies against OC43 S (FcγRIIIa t1/2 =

181

224, FcγRIIa t1/2 = 171 days), this was largely due to a decay in antibodies against the

182

more conserved S2 subunit (FcγRIIIa t1/2 = 229, FcγRIIa t1/2 = 179 days) as FcγR-

183

binding antibodies against the S1 subunit were not boosted and did not change

184

substantially over time (Fig. 4B-C). This was also the case for HKU1, where dimeric

185

FcγR-binding antibodies against S decayed over time but antibodies against the S1

186

subunit did not change (Fig S8A).

187
188

Decay kinetics of S-specific antibodies, neutralisation and Fc effector functions

189

To compare the decay kinetics of S-specific antibodies, neutralisation and Fc effector

190

functions, we plotted the best fit decay slopes over time as a percentage of the

191

response measured at timepoint 1 (Fig. 5A). The best-fit decay slopes of S-specific

192

IgG and plasma neutralisation titres were obtained from a previous dataset that

193

encompass the same subjects analysed for dimeric FcγR-binding antibodies and Fc

194

effector functions (8) (Fig. S3). The general decline in plasma S-specific IgG titres and

195

dimeric FcγR-binding activity was similarly reflected in reductions in Fc effector

196

functions during convalescence from COVID-19. Importantly, Fc effector functions at

197

the last timepoint sampled were still readily detectable above baseline activity

198

observed in uninfected controls (97% for FcγRIIIa activation, 94% for ADCC, 100% for

199

ADP and 100% for THP-1 association). This contrasted with plasma neutralisation

200

activity, which was detectable above background for only 70% of subjects (Fig. 5B).

201

The longer persistence of S-specific IgG and dimeric FcγR-binding antibodies against

202

S has important implications as they may contribute to protection from SARS-CoV-2

203

infection following the decline of neutralising antibodies.

Discussion

205

Using a multiplex bead array and novel assays measuring Fc effector functions against

206

SARS-CoV-2 S, we find that FcγR-binding, ADCC and ADP activities of S-specific

207

antibodies decay during convalescence from COVID-19. The decline of plasma ADCC

208

and ADP activity correlated with the decay of S-specific IgG and FcγR-binding

209

antibodies. Importantly, Fc effector functions were readily detectable above uninfected

210

controls in 94% of subjects for all assays at the last timepoint sampled, in sharp

211

contrast with neutralisation activity, which remained detectable above background for

212

only 70% of subjects. While neutralising antibodies are likely to form a correlate of

213

protection for SARS-CoV-2 (7), several studies find that neutralising antibodies in

214

convalescent donors with mild COVID-19 wane rapidly (2, 8, 9). The rapid decline of

215

plasma neutralisation activity in the early weeks following infection could potentially be

216

explained by the rapid decline of plasma IgM and IgA titres against S and RBD (19,

217

31), which substantially contribute to neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 (32-34). Given the

218

relative scarcity of re-infection cases reported to date, it is likely that immune

219

responses beyond neutralisation, including antibody Fc effector functions and T cell

220

responses, contribute to long-term protection from SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, a recent

221

study demonstrated that cellular immunity in convalescent macaques, mainly CD8+ T

222

cells, contribute to protection against re-challenge after neutralising antibodies have

223

waned (22, 35).

224
225

Our results demonstrate that FcγR-binding antibodies against betacoronaviruses

226

OC43 and HKU1 are much higher in COVID-19 convalescent individuals compared to

227

uninfected controls. This could either be due to the back-boosting of pre-existing HCoV

228

antibodies that are cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2 (27, 28), or the de novo

229

generation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that are cross-reactive with conserved HCoV

230

epitopes. Cross-reactive S antibodies were largely directed against the more

231

conserved S2 subunit, in line with other reports (27, 28). A recent study found cross-

232

reactive binding and neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S2 in uninfected

233

children and adolescents (27), suggesting prior infections with OC43 or HKU1 can

234

elicit cross-reactive antibodies against the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S. These

235

findings raise the interesting question of whether cross-reactive antibodies are

236

recalled rapidly during early SARS-CoV-2 infection and can contribute to Fc effector

237

functions against conserved epitopes within the S2 subunit. The presence of cross-

238

reactive S2-specific antibodies capable of mediating Fc effector functions in early

239

infection could potentially ameliorate disease symptoms and severity. Follow-up

240

studies to dissect the influence of S1 or S2 antibody epitope localisation on FcγR

241

engagement and the impact on Fc effector functions are also warranted.

242
243

Initial concerns for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of COVID-19 were driven

244

by the reported association of higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres with severe disease

245

(36). However, this could simply be the result of prolonged antigen exposure due to

246

higher viral loads. Importantly, Zohar et al. showed that in subjects with severe COVID-

247

19, those who survived had higher levels of S-specific antibodies and Fc-mediated

248

effector functions compared to those who died (31). Notably, numerous trials of

249

convalescent plasma (CP) therapy for COVID-19 have been safely conducted (37-39),

250

with no enhancement of disease reported to date (40-42). Since RBD-specific IgG1

251

antibodies in severe COVID-19 are more likely to have afucosylated Fc regions and

252

trigger hyper-inflammatory responses from monocytes and macrophages (43, 44),

253

there could be implications for ADE in people who are re-infected with SARS-CoV-2

254

after initial neutralising antibodies have waned but non-neutralising antibodies remain.

255

Excessive Fc-mediated effector functions and immune complex formation in the

256

absence of neutralisation could potentially trigger a hyper-inflammatory response and

257

lead to ADE of disease, as observed for RSV and measles infections (45, 46). While

258

ADE during re-infection remains only a theoretical risk, there have been two reported

259

cases of re-infection where the second infection resulted in worse disease (47, 48).

260

However, antibody levels after the first infection were not measured for one case (47)

261

and only IgM was detectable after the first infection for the second case (48), arguing

262

against Fc-mediated effector functions as the cause of increased pathogenicity.

263
264

Overall, we find that FcγR-binding, ADCC and ADP antibody functions decay following

265

recovery from COVID-19 at a slower rate than serum neutralisation activity,

266

suggesting non-neutralising antibody responses elicited by infection or vaccination

Materials and methods

Cohort recruitment and sample collection

270

People who recovered from COVID-19 and healthy controls were recruited to provide

271

serial whole blood samples. Convalescent donors either had a PCR+ test during early

272

infection or clear exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-

273

2 S- and RBD-specific antibodies via ELISA as previously reported (1).

274

Contemporaneous uninfected controls who did not experience any COVID-19

275

symptoms were also recruited and confirmed to be seronegative via ELISA. For all

276

subjects, whole blood was collected with sodium heparin or lithium heparin

277

anticoagulant. The plasma fraction was then collected and stored at -80ºC. A subset

278

of 36 donors with at least 60 days between the first and last visits were chosen to

279

proceed with the more labour-intensive functional ADCC and ADP assays. Plasma

280

was heat-inactivated at 56ºC for 30 minutes prior to use in functional assays.

281

Characteristics of the COVID-19 convalescent and uninfected donors are described

282

in Table S1. The study protocols were approved by the University of Melbourne

283

Human Research Ethics Committee (#2056689). All subjects provided written

284

informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

285
286

Luminex bead-based multiplex assay

287

As previously described (49), a custom multiplex bead array was designed and

288

coupled with SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, S1 subunit (Sino Biological), S2 subunit (ACRO

289

Biosystems) and RBD (BEI Resources), as well as HCoV (OC43, HKU1, 229E, NL63)

290

S (Sino Biological) (Table S2). Tetanus toxoid (Sigma-Aldrich), influenza

291

hemagglutinin (H1Cal2009; Sino Biological) and SIV gp120 (Sino Biological) were also

292

included in the assay as positive and negative controls respectively. Antigens were

294

carbodiimide reaction and blocked with 0.1% BSA, before being resuspended and

295

stored in PBS 0.05% sodium azide till use.

296
297

Using the coupled beads, a custom CoV multiplex assay was formed to investigate

298

the dimeric recombinant soluble FcγR-binding capacity of pathogen-specific

299

antibodies present in COVID-19 convalescent plasma samples and uninfected

300

controls (49). Briefly, 20µl of working bead mixture (1000 beads per bead region) and

301

20µl of diluted plasma (final dilution 1:200) were added per well and incubated

302

overnight at 4°C on a shaker. Different detectors were used to assess pathogen-

303

specific antibodies. Single-step detection was done using phycoerythrin (PE)-

304

conjugated mouse anti-human pan-IgG (Southern Biotech; 1.3µg/ml, 25µl/well). For

305

the detection of FcγR-binding, recombinant soluble FcγR dimers (higher affinity

306

polymorphisms FcγRIIIa-V158 and FcγRIIa-H131, lower affinity polymorphisms

307

FcγRIIIa-F158 and FcγRIIa-R131; 1.3µg/ml, 25µl/well) were first added to the beads,

308

washed, followed by the addition of streptavidin R-PE (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

309

Assays were read on the Flexmap 3D and performed in duplicates.

Cell lines

312

As target cells for the functional antibody assays, Ramos and A549 cells stably

313

expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 S and the reporter proteins mOrange2 or

314

luciferase were generated by lentiviral transduction (Fig. S2A). To stain for S-

315

expression, transduced cells were incubated with convalescent plasma (1:100 dilution)

316

prior to staining with a secondary mouse anti-human IgG-APC antibody (1:200 dilution;

317

clone HP6017, BioLegend). S-luciferase cells were bulk sorted on high S expression

while S-orange cells were bulk sorted on high S- and mOrange2-expression. Following

319

a week of outgrowth, the bulk sorted cells were single-cell sorted to obtain clonal

320

populations of S-orange and S-luciferase cells (Fig. S2B). The Ramos cell lines were

321

grown in complete RPMI medium (10% fetal calf serum (FCS) with 1% penicillin

322

strepytomycin glutamine (PSG)) while the A549 cell lines were grown in complete

323

DMEM medium (10% FCS with 1% PSG).

324
325

FcγRIIIa-NF-κB-RE nanoluciferase reporter cells were used as effector cells for the

326

FcγRIIIa activation assay. IIA1.6 cells expressing the Fc receptor gamma subunit

327

(FcR-γ) were maintained in RPMI containing 10% FCS, 2.5 mM L-glutamine, 55 µM

328

2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units penicillin and 100 units streptomycin (Sigma Aldrich).

329

These were further transduced as described previously (50) using a FcγRIIIa V158

330

cDNA in pMX-neo and the packaging line Phoenix. IIA1.6/FcR-γ/FcγRIIIa V158 cells

331

were transfected with a NF-κB response element driven nanoluciferase (NanoLuc)

343

A549 S-orange cells were plated (2×105/ml, 100 µl/well) in 96-well white flat-bottom

344

plates (Corning). The next day, COVID-19 convalescent and uninfected plasma were

345

serially diluted and 50 µl aliquots transferred to the aspirated A549 S-orange cells and

346

incubated at 37ºC, 60 min, 5% CO2. Unbound antibody was removed by aspirating the

347

wells and refilling with RPMI (200 µl) four times. FcγRIIIa-NF-κB-RE nanoluciferase

348

reporter cells (4 x 105/ml, 50 µl/well) were added to the aspirated wells containing the

349

opsonised A549 S-orange cells. After incubation (370C, 4h, 5%CO2) cells were lysed

350

by adding 50 µl/well of 10 mM Tris-pH 7.4, containing 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2%

351

Igepal CA-630 (Sigma Aldrich), and Nano-Glo luciferase assay substrate (1:1000).

352

Induction of nanoluciferase was measured using a 1s read on a Clariostar Optima

353

plate reader (BMG Labtech) with background luminescence from control wells without

354

agonist subtracted from test values.

355
356

Luciferase-based ADCC assay

357

A luciferase-based ADCC assay was performed to examine ADCC against S-

358

expressing cells. NK cells from healthy donors were first enriched from freshly isolated

359

PBMCs using the EasySep Human NK Cell Enrichment Kit (Stemcell Technologies).

360

In a 96-well V-bottom cell culture plate, purified NK cells (20,000/well) were mixed with

361

Ramos S-luciferase cells (5,000/well) in the presence or absence of plasma from

362

convalescent or uninfected donors at 1:100, 1:400 and 1:1600 dilutions. Each

363

condition was tested in duplicate and “no plasma” and “target cell only” controls were

364

included. Cells were centrifuged at 250g for 4 min prior to a 4-hour incubation at 37ºC

365

with 5% CO2. Cells were then washed with PBS and lysed with 25µl of passive lysis

366

buffer (Promega). Cell lysates (20µl) were transferred to a white flat-bottom plate and

367

developed with 30µl of britelite plus luciferase reagent (Perkin Elmer). Luminescence

368

was read using a FLUOstar Omega microplate reader (BMG Labtech). The relative

369

light units (RLU) measured were used to calculate %ADCC with the following formula:

370

(“no plasma control” – “plasma sample”) ÷ “target cell only control” × 100. For each

371

plasma sample, %ADCC was plotted against log10(plasma dilution-1) and the area

372

under curve (AUC) was calculated using Graphpad Prism.

373
374

Bead-based THP-1 ADP assay

375

To examine ADP mediated by COVID-19 convalescent plasma, a previously published

376

bead-based ADP assay was adapted for use in the context of SARS-CoV-2 (23).

377

SARS-CoV-2 S trimer was biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC biotinylation kit

378

(Thermo Scientific) with 20mmol excess according to manufacturer’s instructions and

379

buffer exchanged using 30kDa Amicon centrifugal filters (EMD millipore) to remove

380

free biotin. The binding sites of 1μm fluorescent NeutrAvidin Fluospheres beads

381

(Invitrogen) were coated with biotinylated S at a 1:3 ratio overnight at 4°C. S-

382

conjugated beads were washed four times with 2% BSA/PBS to remove excess

383

antigen and incubated with plasma (1:100 dilution) for 2 hours at 37ºC in a 96-well U-

384

bottom plate (see Fig. S6 for optimisation). THP-1 monocytes (10,000/well) were then

385

added to opsonized beads and incubated for 16 hours under cell culture conditions.

386

Cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and acquired on a BD LSR Fortessa with a

387

HTS. The data was analyzed using FlowJo 10.7.1 (see Fig. S5 for gating strategy) and

388

a phagocytosis score was calculated as previously described (51) using the formula:

389

(%bead-positive cells × mean fluorescent intensity)/103. To account for non-specific

390

uptake of S-conjugated beads, the phagocytosis scores for each plasma sample were

391

subtracted with that of the “no plasma” control.

Cell-based THP-1 association assay

394

To assess the capacity of THP-1 monocytes to associate with S-expressing target

395

cells via Ab-FcγR interactions, an assay using THP-1 cells as effectors and Ramos S-

396

orange cells as targets was performed. THP-1 monocytes were first stained with

397

CellTraceTM Violet (CTV) (Life Technologies) as per manufacturer’s instructions. In a

398

96-well V-bottom cell culture plate, Ramos S-orange cells (10,000/well) were

399

incubated with plasma from convalescent or uninfected donors (1:2700 dilution) for 30

400

minutes (see Fig. S6 for optimisation). Opsonised Ramos S-orange cells were then

401

washed prior to co-culture with CTV-stained THP-1 monocytes (10,000/well) for 1 hour

402

at 37ºC with 5% CO2. After the incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 2%

403

formaldehyde and acquired using the BD LSR Fortessa with a high-throughput

404

sampler attachment (HTS). The data was analyzed using FlowJo 10.7.1 (see Fig. S5

405

for gating strategy). The percentage of Ramos S-orange cells associated with THP-1

406

monocytes (% association) was measured for each plasma sample and background-

407

subtracted with the “no plasma” control.

408
409

Decay rate estimation

410

The decay rate was estimated by fitting a linear mixed effect model for each response

411

variable (yij for subject i at timepoint j) as a function of days post-symptom onset and

412

assay replicate (as a binary categorical variable). The model can be written as below:

413

𝑦"# = 𝛽& + 𝑏&" + 𝛽) 𝑅"# + 𝛽+ 𝑡"# + 𝑏+" 𝑡"# – for a model with a single slope; and

414

𝑦"# = 𝛽& + 𝑏&" + 𝛽) 𝑅"# + 𝛽+ 𝑡"# + 𝑏+" 𝑡"# + 𝛽- 𝑠"# + 𝑏-" 𝑠"# – for a model with two different

415

slopes, in which:

416

𝑠"# = /

0, 𝑡"# < 𝑇&
𝑡"# − 𝑇& , 𝑡"# ≥ 𝑇&.

417

The parameter 𝛽& is a constant (intercept), and 𝑏&" is a subject-specific adjustment to

418

the overall intercept. The slope parameter 𝛽+ is a fixed effect to capture the decay

419

slope before 𝑇& (as a fixed parameter, 70 days); which also has a subject-specific

420

random effect 𝑏+" . To fit a model with two different decay rates, an extra parameter 𝛽-

421

(with a subject-specific random effect 𝑏-" ) was added to represent the difference

422

between the two slopes. Assay variability between replicates (only for HCoV response

423

variables) was modelled as a single fixed effect 𝛽) , in which we coded the replicate as

424

a binary categorical variable 𝑅"# . The random effect was assumed to be normally

425

distributed with zero mean and variance 𝛿.

426
427

We fitted the model to log-transformed data of various response variables, and we

428

censored the data from below if it was less than the threshold for detection. The

429

response variables had background levels subtracted by taking the mean of all the

430

background values, and the threshold for detection was set at two standard deviations

431

of the background responses. The model was fitted by using lmec library in R, using

432

the ML algorithm to fit for the fixed effects. We also tested if the response variables

433

can be fitted better by using a single or two different decay slopes (likelihood ratio test

434

– based on the likelihood value and the difference in the number of parameters). These

435

analyses were carried out in R: A language and environment for statistical computing

436

version 4.0.2.

437
438

Statistics

439

Statistical analyses were performed with Graphpad Prism 8. Correlations between

440

functional ADCC and ADP responses with cell-associated S-specific IgG and FcγR-

441

binding S-specific antibodies were assessed using the non-parametric Spearman test.
