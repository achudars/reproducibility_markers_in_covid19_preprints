ABSTRACT

19

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the biggest public health problem of

20

the present world. As the number of people suffering from the pandemic is rising, it is likely to

21

claim more life and worsen the global health and economy. Nepal, one of the developing countries

22

in the south Asia has been strongly influenced by the pandemic and struggling to contain it with

23

multiple interventions, however, spatiotemporal dynamics of the epidemic and its linkage with

24

various intervention strategies has not been studied yet. Here, we employed the prospective spatial-

25

temporal analysis with SaTScan assessing dynamics of the COVID-19 cases from 23 January to

26

31 August 2020 at district level in Nepal. The results revealed that COVID-19 dynamics in the

27

early stage of transmission was slower and confined in certain districts. However, from the third

28

week of April, transmission spread rapidly across districts of Province No. 2 and Sudoorpaschim

29

Province, primarily introduced by Nepalese citizens returning from India. Despite nationwide

30

lockdown, nine statistically significant active and emerging clusters were detected between 23

31

January and 21 July 2020, whereas ten emerging clusters were observed for extended period to 31

32

August. The population density and population inflow from India crossing the sealed border had

33

significant effects on the elevated risk of the epidemic. The capital city Kathmandu has become

34

the highest-risk active cluster since August when travel restriction has been suspended. Movement

35

restriction appears to be the most effective non-pharmaceutical intervention against the COVID-

36

19 for resource-scarce countries with limited health care facilities. Our findings could be valuable

37

to the health authorities within Nepal and beyond to better allocate resources and improve

38

interventions on the pandemic for containing it efficiently.

1. Introduction

41

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has been considered a Public Health

42

Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and declared a global pandemic on 11

43

March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). This viral disease caused by the severe

44

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected 39,596,858 people and

45

killed 1107374 lives as of 18 October 2020 (WHO, 2020). COVID-19 is a highly contagious

46

disease with an initial estimated average basic reproductive rate (R0) of 3.28 (Liu et al., 2020) that

47

has been substantially reduced by the multiple intervention approaches (You et al., 2020). The

48

disease has been described to have higher severity to the old-age and immunosuppressed people

49

such as suffering from cardiac and pulmonary disorders (Zheng et al., 2020). Despite the constant

50

efforts of scientists across the globe, we still lack the well-tested and approved vaccines and drugs

51

against the disease.

52

Analogous to many countries in the world, Nepal has hugely suffered from the COVID-19

53

pandemic (Panthee et al., 2020). The first case of the disease was reported on 23 January 2020 in

54

a China-returned 32 years old male (Pun et al., 2020; Shrestha et al., 2020). After the lag period of

55

two months, the second positive case was reported on 23 March 2020 (Piryani et al., 2020).

56

Subsequently the number of the disease victims gradually increased and almost all the cases in the

57

earlier days were among the people returned from Europe, Middle-East countries and others.

58

Despite being neighbored to the China also, the number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in Nepal

59

surged up when the Nepalese workers from its southern neighbor India returned home via open

60

border between the two countries. By the date of 18 October 2020, there have been 132246 cases

61

and 739 deaths across the country (MoHP, 2020). The geographical distribution of the COVID-19

62

cases within the Nepal territory is not uniform. Communities associated with the poverty in densely

63

populated growing cities are estimated more vulnerable to the infection (Khanal et al., 2020).

64

Additionally, disease intervention efforts are not equal among the local administrative units of

65

Nepal and so is the pattern of spread of the COVID-19.

66

The magnitude and timing of the interventions matter for the mitigation of the outbreak (Dehning

67

et al., 2020). When the second COVID-19 case was recorded in Nepal and number of cases was

68

also rising in India, the Government of Nepal closed all international flights and borders on 23

69

March 2020 (Sapkota et al., 2020). The very next day, a nation-wide lockdown was further

70

enforced that continued till 21 July 2020. Besides the diagnosis, isolation and treatment of the

71

COVID-19 patients, Government of Nepal employed multiple public health measures such as

72

border closure, lockdown, social distancing, and personal hygiene which aided Nepal in avoiding

73

the spread of the novel coronavirus during the initial days (Basnet et al., 2020; Dhakal and Karki,

74

2020). Physical distancing measures, such as closure of schools and colleges, retail businesses,

75

and restaurants, cancellation of public events, as well as constraints on individual movements and

76

social interactions, are now in place in many countries with the aim of reducing transmission of

77

SARS-CoV-2 (Cowling et al., 2020; Davies et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Among other

78

measures, travel restrictions, physical distancing, home quarantine, centralized quarantine,

79

compulsion on mask wearing in public places, universal symptom survey, implementation of

80

testing, isolation, and contact tracing probably slowed the transmission dynamics significantly

81

(Davies et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020). Despite of continuous lockdown enforced

82

for 120 days, the outbreak of the COVID-19 is reemerging and the efficacy of such interventions

83

have never been assessed in Nepal.

84

Pharmaceutical interventions alone are not enough to contain the COVID-19, hence, countries

85

augmented them with non-pharmaceutical approaches. However, how different combinations of

86

interventions, timings, and extents have yielded desired outcomes to curb the disease transmission

87

remains unclear (Cowling et al., 2020; Davies et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2020; MacIntyre and Wang

88

2020; Pan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The level of vulnerability to the COVID-19 differed

89

among the communities based on the demographic, socioeconomic, accessibility to the health

90

facilities, prevalence of the pulmonary and cardiac disorders, etc. (Khanal et al., 2020). The

91

complex spatial and temporal epidemiology of COVID-19 due to rapid changes in human

92

population dynamics and its demographic and environmental drivers challenges in its efficient

93

control (Alkhamis et al., 2020). One of the important drivers of the spreading of infectious diseases

94

is the human movement, tracking of which is using data sources such as public transportation (bus,

95

train, and flight), social-media data, and mobile-phone data could be critical for the prediction of

96

virus transmission, the identification of risk area, and decisions about control measure (Zhou et

97

al., 2020). Therefore, it is important to analyze the spatiotemporal pattern of the COVID-19

98

outbreak in the light of human dynamics and non-pharmaceutical interventions.

99

The use of spatiotemporal analytical tools for rapid risk-based surveillance can offer valuable near-

100

real-time insights into the severity of pandemic spread as well as the effectiveness of intervention

101

measures and can aid decision making, planning and community action (Franch-Pardo et al.,

102

2020). Such analyses have been proven to be effective to identify the extent and impact of the

103

pandemic and formulate the intervention strategies in many countries including Bangladesh

104

(Masrur et al., 2020), China (Kang et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2020), Italy (Gatto et al., 2020;

105

Martellucci et al., 2020), Spain (Santamaría and Hortal 2021), USA (Cordes and Castro 2020;

106

Mollalo et al., 2020; Sun et al. 2020), etc. Additionally, findings of such analyses could be decisive

107

for early identification of high-risk groups for disease transmission and efficient deployment of

108

resources for developing economies like Nepal. The spatial scan statistic (SaTScan) is a widely

109

used method for geographical disease surveillance that detects and determines statistical

110

significance of geographical cluster without having to prespecify the cluster size or location. It

111

applies a moving circular window on the map, centered on each of many possible grid points

112

positioned throughout the study region and creates many thousands of distinct geographical circles,

113

each being the possible candidate cluster. The retrospective analysis on the SaTScan can identify

114

all past and current significant clustering events throughout the study period (Kulldorff, 1997).

115

The epidemic crisis management demands estimation of the actual effects of interventions taken

116

not only to make rapid adjustments but also to adapt short-term forecasts (Dehning et al., 2020).

117

Nepal offers an opportunity to assess the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-

118

19 that could be rolled out in resource-limited settings in other countries. The main objective of

119

this study was to assess spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 on the context of various

120

restrictions imposed as preventive measures to contain the disease transmission. We explored

121

active and emerging disease clusters using the prospective space–time scanning (Desjardins et al.,

122

2020; Masrur et al., 2020) for two time periods, 23 January - 21 July, and 23 January - 31 August

123

2020 taking the cutoff date of 21 July. In addition, we investigated biweekly space-time

124

propagation of transmission for locating risk and newly emerged clusters along the timeline

125

accounting two weeks incubation period of the SARS-CoV-2.

2. Methods

127

2.1 Data Source

128

This study was conducted covering the entire 77 districts of Nepal (Fig. 1) using three different

129

datasets. COVID-19 cases reported to the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP), Government

130

of Nepal was the first of its kind. This dataset contains daily COVID-19 positive cases, death and

131

recovery aggregated at district. The COVID-19 were tested using the RT-PCR in various lab

132

distributed across the country. We extracted reported positive case and joined them with district

133

shapefile collected from Department of Survey, Government of Nepal. In addition, we obtained

134

gridded population dataset in 100-meter spatial resolution for the year of 2020 from the worldpop

135

geoportal (https://www.worldpop.org/). We summarized it for each district using the zonal

136

statistics tool of ARC GIS which was used later as a base population to assess underlying risk to

137

COVID-19 in the district.

143

government of Nepal. The country was shut down from 23 March 2020, which was lifted five

144

months later in 21 July 2020. We visualized the temporal dynamics using epidemic curve and

145

several restrictions enforced in different spatiotemporal scales. The spatial distribution of

146

cumulative cases of reported COVID-19 and incidence rate before and after the cutoff date of 21

147

July 2020 is presented through choropleth mapping technique.

148

To quantify spatiotemporal dynamics of the epidemics, we used the SatScan approach (Kulldorff,

149

1997) using the SaTScan version 9.6 (Kulldorff, 2018). The SaTScan statistics has been used

150

widely to identify significant spatial/ temporal and spatiotemporal disease clusters including

151

COVID-19 in different region of the world (Acharya et al., 2016; Desjardins et al., 2020; Masrur

152

et al., 2020). The SaTScan scans across time and/or space using moving window to identify

153

possible clusters by comparing the number of observed cases and expected cases assuming random

154

distribution inside the window at each location. Scanning window is a time interval for purely

155

temporal scan, a circle or ellipse in spatial scan and a cylinder in space-time scan where base of a

156

cylinder represents space dimension and height represents the temporal dimension (Kulldorff,

157

2001; Kulldorff, 2018). The null hypothesis states that there is no difference in risk between inside

158

and outside of the circle or cylinder while alternative hypothesis states the number of observed

159

cases exceeds the number of expected cases derived from null models with elevated risk within

160

the circle/cylinder. The expected number (μ) under the null hypothesis H0 is derived as follows

161

(Desjardins et al., 2020):
𝐶

162

𝜇 = 𝑝 ∗ 𝑃 … … … … … .. (1)

163

where, 𝑝 is the population in a geographic area, C and P are the total number of reported cases and

164

the total estimated population, respectively.

165
166

The SaTScan also identifies secondary clusters in addition to the most likely cluster for spatial and

167

spatiotemporal scan, and orders them according to their likelihood ratio test. Equation (2) was used

168

for calculating maximum likelihood ratio that identified scanning windows with elevated risk

169

(Kulldorff, 2001).

where, L(Z)= Log likelihood function for scanning window; L0 is the likelihood function for null

172

hypothesis; nZ is the number of reported cases within the window; µ(Z) is the number of expected

173

cases within the window Z; N is the total number of observed cases for the entire study areas

174

across all time periods; and µ(T) is the total number of expected cases in the study area across all

175

time periods.

176

Due to the assumption of uniform relative risk (RR) across a cluster, multiple geographic units can

177

belong to significant space-time clusters. To avoid that assumption, relative risk for each spatial

178

unit that belongs to a cluster is computed. The relative risk is for each location belonging to a

179

cluster is calculated as (Liu et al., 2018; Hohl et al., 2020):
𝑅𝑅 =

180

𝑐/𝑒
… … … … . . (3)
(𝐶 − 𝑐)/(𝐶 − 𝑒)

181

where, ‘c’ is the total number reported cases, ‘e’ is the total number of expected cases, and ‘C’ is

182

the total number of observed cases in the entire study area.

183

In this study, we chose prospective space time analysis to detect emerging or active space-time

184

clusters that are still occurring at the end of the study period based on the discrete Poisson model

185

(Kulldorff, 1997, 2001). We chose discrete Poisson probability model to account heterogeneous

186

distribution of COVID-19 transmission across the space and time (Kim and Castro 2020; Masrur

187

et al., 2020). The space-time scan statistic employs moving cylinders for potential space-time

188

clusters of COVID-19 cases. We performed this analysis on daily reported cases of COVID-19

189

aggregated on 77 districts. As we were interested to locate elevated risk zones to the COVID-19,

190

high rate was chosen for further analysis. We set the upper bounds to have a maximum spatial and

191

temporal scanning window size of 10% of the population at-risk to avoid extremely large clusters;

192

and 50% of the study period, respectively. We utilized Monte Carlo testing with 9999 replications

193

to assess the statistical significance of space-time clusters with default P of 0.05.

194

To understand the space-time propagation of the transmission we computed difference of relative

195

risk between two-study periods and also detected emerging clusters using with shorter temporal

196

scan through biweekly cumulative prospective scanning approach accounting two weeks

197

incubation period (Desjardins et al., 2020) for locating the risk and newly emerged high-risk areas

198

along the timeline.

3. Results

200

3.1 General overview of the COVID-19 in Nepal

201

A total 39460 cases of COVID-19 were reported in Nepal as of 31 August 2020 out of 693,472

202

tests done by RT-PCR. Among the total infected people, 30,881 (78.25%) were males and 8579

203

(21.74%) were females. The fatality rate and cured rate in Nepal due to COVID-19 were 0.6% and

204

54.3%, respectively.

Figure 2. Epidictic curve of COVID-19 cases in Nepal reported. The primary axis (left) is
cumulative count of reported cases and secondary axis (right) is daily reported count

208

The temporal dynamics of the epidemic is presented in the Fig. 2. The epidemic curve started

209

ascend only after third week of April, which was almost four months later the detection of the first

210

case in 23 January 2020. However, sporadically COVID-19 cases were detected from different

211

districts despite nationwide lockdown started on 24 March. From the third week of the May the

212

epidemic curve started to rise abruptly and the trend continued until the June last. In this period,

213

significantly higher number of migrant workers returned home from India. Once the number of

214

returns from India decreased slowly the positive case also shrunk rapidly. However, the number

215

of COVID-19 cases increased substantially again after lifting the nationwide lockdown in 21st July

216

2020. The rising trend continued in the later part of July and entire August despite the local level

217

restrictions enforced in different districts.

218

Spatial distribution of cumulative cases and district level incidence rate of COVID-19 reported

219

before and after the cutoff date is presented in the Figures 3a and 3b, respectively. By July 21, the

220

epidemic was more intense in several western districts such as Dailekh, Doti, Achham and Bajura

221

and low lying Tarai districts bordering with India including Rautahat, Kailali, Mahotari and

222

Sarlahi, although it was already spread across the country. Spatial pattern of the incidence rate was

223

slightly different than the patterns of total cumulative cases which determined by the population

224

distribution. Bajura, Doti, Achham, Dailekh were districts with higher incidence. Higher incidence

225

rates were also reported from Palpa, Parbat and Arghaghkanchi districts of Gandaki province. By

226

August 31, the epidemic had become more intense across the country (Figure 3b). The highest

227

number of cases were reported from Kathmandu followed by Parsa, Sarlahi, Rautahat while the

228

least cases were reported from Mustang, Manang and Humla, respectively. In the same period, the

229

highest incidence was observed in Doti, followed by Bajura and Dailekh, where the incidence was

230

above 30/1000.

3.2 Emerging district level clusters: 23 January- 21 July 2020

235

Nine statistically significant emerging space-time clusters of COVID-19 were detected at district

236

level between January 23 and July 21, 2020 in Nepal. Table 1 provides the characteristics of these

237

clusters with varying size, relative risk and onset time and duration. The most likely cluster i.e.

238

cluster 1 and other secondary clusters; 3, 4 and 5 emerged from June 12 while cluster 6, 7 and 8

239

lately emerged almost at the end of study period. The relative risk of these clusters also varied

240

significantly. For example, the RR of cluster 1 (most likely cluster) was 16.95 while those of the

241

cluster 2 and 3 were 9.87 and 9.81, respectively. Cluster 5, 8 and 9 were low risk clusters with RR

242

less than 3.00.

Figure 4a shows the locations and spatial patterns of the nine emerging space-time clusters of

246

COVID-19 at the district level in Nepal between January 23 and July 23, 2020. Cluster 1 contains

247

11 districts of Karnali and Sudoorpaschim province. Cluster 2, the first secondary cluster, is the

248

largest cluster with 145 km radius and covers 19 districts of western Nepal. Cluster 3, 5 and 6 were

249

smaller compared to the first two clusters with radius 53, 44 and 27 km and number of districts

250

inside the clusters were 5, 3 and 3, respectively. Cluster 4 and 9 were single district cluster of

251

Saptari and Sindhupalchok, correspondingly. There were 28 out of 77 districts outside these 9-

252

emerging clusters having RR=0; at the time of this analysis, they were non emerging COVID-19

253

risk districts.

Fig. 4b illustrates extent and spatial distribution 10 emerging space-time clusters of COVID-19 at

269

the district level in Nepal between January 23 and August 31, 2020. Cluster 4 is the largest cluster

270

with 100 km radius, which contains 10 districts of Karnali and Sudoorpaschim province. The most

271

likely cluster (Cluster 1) was located in central Nepal covering Parsa, Makawnpur Bara and

272

Chitwan districts. Cluster 3, 7, 9 and 10 were single districts clusters located in the Eastern Nepal.

273

Figure 5 also elucidates the elevated risk of 38 districts lying inside these clusters with varying

274

risk level ranging from 2.2 (Cluster 8) to 10.51 (Cluster 5). Bhaktapur, Lalitpur and Sarlahi were

275

the districts with higher relative risk (RR> 10). The number of the districts with moderate relative

276

risk were 16 (RR= 5-10) while lower risk (RR= 1-5) were observed 19 districts. Other 39 districts

277

exhibited no elevated risk of exposure (RR = 0) to the COVID-19 infection.

278

3.4 Progression of relative risk of COVID-19 in Nepal

279

The changing patterns of relative risk (RR) over two emerging periods have been shown in the

280

Figure 5. An abrupt reduction of RR was observed in 19 districts of which most of the districts

281

belonged to the cluster 1 and cluster 2 during 23 January- 21 July. A rapid rise of RR (>5) also

282

noticed in 8 districts including Dailekh, Arghakhanchi, Baitadi, Dadeldhura, Rautahat, Parbat,

283

Gulmi and Mahottari while moderate rise and fall in RR was observed in 11 and 12 districts

284

symbolized by light red and light green, respectively. Some districts with RR = 0 over the two

periods indicated no difference in relative risk which were regarded as “non-emerging” COVID-

286

19 districts. However, it should be noted that these districts had also experienced the outbreak

287

during the study period. Some of them became emerging clusters (with elevated RR) at some point

288

in time when scanned over a shorter temporal window (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Space-time propagation of COVID-19 relative risk in different weeks in Nepal

300

The elevated risk of COVID-19 transmission was observed in 21 April for the first time in Nepal

301

although sporadic cases were reported from different districts since its first report in 23 January

302

2020. In this time, only six districts had elevated risk with significant variation in RR. The RR of

303

Udayapur was extremely high (RR=297) followed by Jhapa (RR=68). The relative risk of Baglung,

304

Chitawan, Kailali, Parsa and Nawalparasi East were moderately low (RR<20). This was the first

305

cluster level transmission (14 cases) of COVID-19 suspected in Udayapur district of Nepal with

306

migration history of the infected people from India. Two weeks later Banke and Parsa districts

307

bordering India became hotspots while the risk of transmission in Udaypur persisted continuously

308

(RR=86). By the May 21, the elevated risk expanded in 21 districts with significant spatial

309

variation on RR. Dhankuta and Jhapa emerged as new hotspots while elevated risk of Banke

310

remained constantly high (RR= 100). The COVID-19 transmission further spread in the next two

311

weeks, till 07 June and the number of elevated risk (RR>1) districts reached 32. At this time

312

Kalikot and Dailekh districts became hotspots (RR>150) while the risk of Rautahat and Kapilvastu

313

was also significantly high (RR>50). In the later weeks, elevated risk of COVID-19 further

314

expanded but the unexpectedly high RR was more stabilize. From the beginning of July, the

315

districts with higher relative risk further expanded on the proximity of Dailekh and Kailkot and

316

the vicinity of Palpa and Syangja which continue until the first week of August. By the August 31,

317

which is the last date of study period, the elevated RR was expanded to 56 districts.

4. Discussion

319

COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected the south-Asian countries including Nepal where

320

number of cases are still (first week of October) increasing exponentially (MoHP, 2020). This

321

study employed prospective space-time scan statistics for identifying currently active or emerging

322

clusters of COVID-19 at the district level in Nepal, providing results at two distinct time periods

323

of differential intervention attempts. The prospective scanning is valuable surveillance tool in

324

monitoring disease outbreaks and locate active elevated risk of disease in space and time

325

(Desjardins et al., 2020). Our findings can be useful for rapidly monitoring evolving space-time

326

patterns of COVID-19 that will enable government and health officials to take appropriate time-

327

sensitive intervention by considering disease’s space-time diffusion pathways and potentially

328

prepare for future outbreaks of a highly contagious disease (Masrur et al., 2020).

329

After the first recorded positive case of COVID-19 on 21 January, there was a lag period of two

330

months for the very next case. However, the cases increased after the third week of the March and

331

continued to grow exponentially. The first ascend on the epidemic curve was observed after the

332

third week of April when Nepalese migrants working in India returned home after nationwide

333

lockdown there. The open border between the countries and surge of large number of returnees

334

made it impossible to regulate the movement and manage proper test and isolation. Therefore,

335

most of the cases were recorded from the districts of Province No 2 bordering India and that of

336

Sudoorpaschim province, large number of people from those districts are working in India since

337

long (Chalise 2020). Human mobility and control strategy determine the spatial spread of the

338

epidemics (Arimura et al., 2020; Drake et al., 2020; Kraemer et al., 2020; Rader et al., 2020; Zhou

339

et al., 2020). The areas close to the outbreak has a higher risk of contagion, especially in the initial

340

stage of infection (Carteni et al., 2020). Indian cities were severely affected of the COVID-19 since

341

early April (Ray et al., 2020; Tomar and Gupta 2020) and inflow of infected but asymptomatic
16

342

people from those areas without testing increased the cases in particular areas of Nepal.

343

Additionally, those districts of elevated incidences are also characterized by higher population

344

density, lower literacy rates, higher poverty, and in turn preeminent vulnerability to the epidemics

345

(Khanal et al., 2020). Population density is one of the important factors in shaping the spatial

346

pattern of the epidemics as the crowded cities worldwide could experience more prolonged

347

epidemics (Rader et al., 2020). Similar results were observed in China where the population inflow

348

from Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic and the strength of economic connection were the

349

main factors affecting the epidemic spread (Xie et al., 2020).

350

The spatial analysis and predictive modelling of the evolution of the COVID-19 is important to

351

interpret the epidemic phenomenon (Franch-Pardo et al., 2020). Our prospective space–time

352

scanning analysis revealed nine major emerging clusters for the first phase of the study (23 January

353

- 21 July). The most likely cluster, the C1, emerged on 12 June that included 11 districts from

354

Karnali and Sudoorpaschim provinces. These districts have higher poverty and majority of the

355

households have one or more members of the family working as low-skilled manpower in Indian

356

cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and others (Khanal et al., 2020). The first cluster of COVID-19 observed

357

was the consequence of infected returnees from India. Despite the nationwide lockdown imposed

358

and borders sealed, people from India used resumed Indian railway services after the middle of

359

May and returned back Nepal crossing the open border without taking proper precautions and in

360

many cases violating isolation and quarantine protocols of federal and local governments (Chalise,

361

2020). Clusters 1-5 began on the second week of June and persisted till 21 July that were all

362

associated to the inflow of people from India. It has signified the importance of social distancing

363

and movement restrictions in containing the epidemic.

364

The prospective space–time scanning analyses for wider temporal scale, i.e. from 23 January to 31

365

August revealed 10 emerging clusters. The Cluster 4 in the far-western lowland Nepal was the

366

largest cluster encompassing 10 districts with relative risk of 4.03, which is apparently the

367

continuation of the Cluster 1 of the previous time frame i.e. 23 January- 21 July 2020. The Cluster

368

5 with the highest relative risk of 10.5 included two districts of the capital city Kathmandu valley-

369

Bhaktapur and Lalitpur. The number of COVID-19 cases were much higher in the Kathmandu

370

district of the valley (MoHP, 2020); however, our analysis didn’t account a high relative risk for

371

it due to an enormous base population. When the Government of Nepal lifted the nationwide

372

lockdown on 21 July, people from different districts rushed to the capital city and the number of

373

cases raised abruptly that developed a strong cluster (Cluster 5) with very high relative risk.

374

Epidemics in crowded cities disperse rapidly and have larger total attack rates than less populated

375

cities (Rader et al., 2020). To better understand the COVID-19 transmission dynamics, datasets on

376

patient’s travel and contact history need to be incorporated (Masrur et al., 2020), however, there

377

is no proper mechanism of tracking in Nepal. Therefore, the Kathmandu valley with more than

378

four million population within 665 km2 area is under severe risk of COVID-19 outbreak.

379

During nationwide lockdown imposed by the federal government of Nepal, all public places

380

remained shut down and strictly followed government directives. Many local municipal

381

governments also efficiently implemented the closure, isolation, tracking and quarantine; those

382

which failed to do so experienced initial community outbreaks. Therefore, till June 2020,

383

community level transmission was localized in few districts such as Udaypur, Parsa, and Banke

384

(Figure 6). However, since July, many districts of Lumbini and Sudoorpaschim provinces

385

experienced a high relative risk. Major reason behind such was unpreparedness of the federal

386

government (Thakur et al., 2020) which failed to seal the southern border that imported hundreds

387

of COVID-19 positive people from India, and could not properly test, track and isolate the

388

individuals rescued from the Arabian countries. Another important shortcoming was the use of

389

less reliable and inefficient antibody-based diagnosis (the rapid diagnostic tools) (Bisoffi et al.,

390

2020; Ghaffari et al., 2020) emphasized in place of the antigen-based RT-PCR. By the end of

391

August, densely populated Kathmandu valley that had very few cases of COVID-19 for the first

392

five months of lockdown started having thousands of cases diagnosed every day. Centralization of

393

the health facilities in the capital city Kathmandu caused people to move into it for the diagnosis

394

and treatment of diseases including COVID-19. It is an established fact that people having

395

compromised immunity due to pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders are highly prone to the

396

COVID-19 infection (Fang et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). Large number of old-age people

397

visiting hospital for medical checkup were found positive to the COVID-19 and many were

398

diagnosed positive only after death. Inefficient and inadequate intervention against the epidemic

399

has resulted a strong cluster within the Kathmandu valley and Bharatpur where medical facilities

400

are centralized but becoming short to contain the COVID-19. Therefore, together with medical

401

care, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as travel restrictions, tracking and isolation are

402

inevitable.

5. Conclusion

404

The epidemic spread rate in Nepal has an evident spatial variation. Districts of Sudoorpaschim

405

province and Province No 2 bordering India experienced rapid transmission of the COVID-19

406

when the Nepalese migrants returned home in May/June. The unmanaged population inflow from

407

India crossing the sealed border had significant effects on the epidemic spread rate. The capital

408

city Kathmandu and Bharatpur where medical facilities are concentrated have become the highest-

409

risk active clusters since August. It is important to detect emerging clusters that would reveal more

410

updated space-time transmission dynamics of COVID-19 to better allocate resources and improve

411

decision-making as the outbreaks continue to grow. The purposive and time-bound movement

412

restriction appears to be the most important non-pharmaceutical intervention against the COVID-

413

19 for resource-scarce countries with limited health care facilities.
