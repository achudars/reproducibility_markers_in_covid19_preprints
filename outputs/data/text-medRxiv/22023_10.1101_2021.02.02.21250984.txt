Abstract

24

Rapid antigen assays (RAD) based on lateral flow immunochromatography (LFIC)

25

technology have emerged as a valuable tool for the control of COVID-19 pandemic.

26

Manufacturerindependent, realworld evaluation of these assays is crucial given the

27

considerable heterogeneity reported in their clinical and analytical performances. Here,

28

we report for the first time on the point-of-care performance of the CLINITEST® Rapid

29

COVID-19 Antigen Test (Siemens, Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) to detect SARS-

30

CoV-2 infection in presumptive COVID-19 cases or asymptomatic close contacts of

31

COVID-19 patients. When compared to RT-PCR, the overall sensitivity of the assay

32

was 80.2 (95% CI, 70.9-87.1) for symptomatic patients sampled (nasopharyngeal

33

specimens) within five days after the onset of symptoms and 60% (95% CI, 40.7-

34

76.6%) for asymptomatic participants. The overall specificity was 100% in both

35

population groups.

46

Rapid and decentralized testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the cornerstones of

47

controlling the COVID-19 pandemic [1]. Rapid antigen assays (RAD) based on lateral

48

flow immunochromatography (LFIC) technology offer advantages over molecular

49

assays for the purpose, as they are low-cost, easy-to-use and instrument-free devices.

50

An increasing number of RAD LFIC assays are being marketed nowadays.

51

Manufacturerindependent, realworld evaluation of these assays is crucial given the

52

considerable heterogeneity reported in their clinical and analytical performances [2].

53

Here, we report for the first time on the point-of-care (POC) performance of the

54

CLINITEST® Rapid COVID-19 Antigen Test (Siemens, Healthineers, Erlangen,

55

Germany) to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in presumptive COVID-19 cases or

56

asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 patients. The CLINITEST® RAD is a LFIC

57

device licensed for detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal

58

(NP) or nasal swabs to diagnose COVID-19 within the first week after symptoms onset.

59

A total of 270 subjects were enrolled in this prospective study from November 26 2020

60

to January 21 2021. The study was approved by the Ethical Committeee of Hospital

61

Clínico Universitario INCLIVA, Valencia (October, 2021). Participants were either

62

outpatients with suspected COVID-19 (n=178; median age, 41 years; range, 11-83

63

years; females, 112 -62.9%-), reporting at 5 or days or less (median 3 days; range 1-5

64

days) after onset of symptoms (one or more of the following: fever, dry cough,

65

rhinorrhea, chest pain, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, anosmia, ageusia, odynophagia,

66

diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and cephalea), or asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19

67

patients (n=92; median age, 44 years; range, 11-87 years; females, 54 -58.7%-), as

68

defined by the Spanish Ministry of Health [3]. Of the latter subset, 78 and 14 subjects

69

were household or non-household contacts, respectively. These were sampled at a

70

median of 4 days (range, 0-7 days) in the former group and a median of 5 days (range,

71

2-7 days) in the latter.

72

NP for RAD and RT-PCR testing were collected at POC by experienced nurses. For

73

each patient, one swab was taken from the left nostril for RAD testing, and the other,

74

obtained from the right nostril, was placed in 3 ml of Universal Transport Medium

75

(UTM, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA) and used for RT-PCR testing. RAD

76

testing was carried out at POC immediately after sampling following the manufacturer’s

77

recommendations. RT-PCRs were conducted within 24 h. of specimen collection at the

78

Microbiology Service of Hospital Clínico Universitario (Valencia, Spain) with the

79

TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA).

80

Among symptomatic patients, 73 tested positive by RT-PCR and RAD, 18 by RT-PCR

81

only, and the remaining patients tested negative by both assays, thus indicating good

82

agreement between RT-PCR and RAD results (Kappa index, 0,80; 95% CI, 0.71-0.88).

83

Household contacts (n=78; median age, 42 years; range, 14-81 years; females, 45 -

84

57.7% -) were tested at a median of 4 days (range, 0-7) after diagnosis of the index case.

85

Non-household contacts (n=14; median age, 52 years; range, 11-87 years; range, 11-87

86

years; females, 9 -64.3%-) were sampled at a median of 5 days (range, 2-7) after self-

87

reported exposure. Of the 15 subjects returning RT-PCR positive/RAD positive results,

88

10 tested positive only by RT-PCR, and the remaining 67 tested negative by both

89

assays. The concordance between results returned by both assays was moderate in this

90

population group (Kappa index, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50-0.87). Interestingly, of the 15

91

asymptomatic participants testing positive by RT-PCR, five became symptomatic later

92

on, all of whom had a positive RAD result.

94

As expected [2], SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was significantly higher (P<0.0001) in RT-

95

PCR positive/RAD positive specimens than in RT-PCR positive/RAD negative samples

96

from both symptomatic and asymptomatic participants (Supplementary Table 1).

97

Of note, time to sampling from symptoms onset or after exposure to the index case was

98

similar across RAD-positive and RAD-negative participants (not shown).

99

Therefore, the sensitivity of the RAD assay was notably higher in symptomatic than in

100

asymptomatic subjects (Table 1), whereas specificity was similar (100%). Negative and

101

positive predictive values, adjusted to the median prevalence of positive cases within

102

the study period in our Health Department (22%) were 94.7 % (95% CI, 87.6-97.9%)

103

and 100 % (95% CI, 82.1-100%), respectively for symptomatic patients and 89.9%

104

(95% CI, 81.7-94.6%) and 100% (95% CI, 77.5-100%), respectively for asymptomatic

105

close contacts.

106

According to our data, the CLINITEST® Rapid COVID-19 Antigen Test meets the

107

criteria recommended in WHO interim guidance for RAD diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2

108

infection (at least 80% sensitivity and 97% specificity), but as with other commercially-

109

available RAD assays [1,5,6], this only applies in symptomatic patients with suspected

110

COVID-19 who are tested shortly after symptoms onset (up to 5 days in the current

111

study). In contrast, the POC performance of this and other RAD assays [1,6], is clearly

112

suboptimal in asymptomatic close-contact individuals, either household or non-

113

household. Two non-mutually exclusive factors may account for this observation: (i)

114

SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in the upper respiratory tract (URT) could follow different

115

kinetics in symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects, implying that the sampling time in

116

the latter may have been inappropriate (too early or too late) to capture all infection

117

cases; (ii) SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals not subsequently developing COVID-19

118

display lower overall viral loads in URT than those who do. In support of this latter

119

viewpoint, all five participants eventually developing COVID-19 returned positive

120

results by RAD at the sampling time. This was also observed in a previous study using

121

the Panbio RAD assay from Abbott Laboratories [6].
