Abstract

21

Background

22

COVID-19 pandemic is underway. Some COVID-19 cases re-tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA after

23

discharge raising the public concern on their infectivity. Characterization of re-positive cases are urgently needed

24

for designing intervention strategies.

25

Methods

26

Clinical data were obtained through Guangdong COVID-19 surveillance network. Neutralization antibody titre

27

was determined using a microneutralization assay. Potential infectivity of clinical samples was evaluated after the

28

cell inoculation. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using three different RT-PCR kits and multiplex PCR with

29

nanopore sequencing.

30

Results

31

Among 619 discharged COVID-19 cases, 87 were re-tested as SARS-CoV-2 positive in circumstance of social

32

isolation. All re-positive cases had mild or moderate symptoms in initial diagnosis and a younger age distribution

33

(mean, 30.4). Re-positive cases (n=59) exhibited similar neutralization antibodies (NAbs) titre distributions to

34

other COVID-19 cases (n=150) parallel-tested in this study. No infective viral strain could be obtained by culture

35

and none full-length viral genomes could be sequenced for all re-positive cases.

37

Re-positive SARS-CoV-2 was not caused by the secondary infection and was identified in around 14% of

38

discharged cases. A robust Nabs response and a potential virus genome degradation were detected from nearly all

39

re-positive cases suggesting a lower transmission risk, especially through a respiratory route.

Introduction

42

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome

43

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1), which shares a 96% genetic similarity with the most closely related bat origin

44

SARS-like virus (RaTG13) (2). As a newly emergent virus, the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infections were

45

largely unknown at the beginning of the outbreak but are becoming gradually clearer as a result of global clinical

46

studies (3, 4). The design of risk assessments and successful interventions for COVID-19 are dependent on how

47

well we understand the course of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

48

49

The COVID-19 pandemic is underway (5). Social measures for monitoring, controlling and treating COVID-19

50

are varied among countries. It has been suggested that the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 could serve as

51

the basis for an “immunity passport”, however it is currently unclear whether recovered COVID-19 cases have

52

neutralizing antibodies that protecting them from a second infection. There have been reports that some recovered

53

COVID-19 cases have re-tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA a few days after discharge (6, 7). Since a RT-PCR

54

test that targets a short fragment of the virus genome cannot indicate if an individual is infectious or not, we define

55

in this study these observations as “re-positive” cases, not relapse or repeat infection cases.

56

57

Re-positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA raises questions about the transmission risk of the disease, including,

58

(i) the percentage of re-positive in COVID-19 discharged cases and its association with clinical characters, (ii) the

59

immune status of re-positive cases, and (iii) infectivity of re-positive cases.

61

Guangdong Province reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases in China except Hubei. Guangdong

62

launched an enhanced surveillance network and a series of intervention measures in response to the outbreak soon

63

after the first COVID-19 case was reported in December 2019 (8). Since 23 January, all discharged COVID-19

64

cases were isolated in designated hotels under medical observation for another 14 days. In this study, we screened

65

619 recovered COVID-19 cases in Guangdong discharged between 23 January and 19 February. One hundred

66

thirty-seven swabs and 59 serum samples from 70 re-positive cases were collected in order to reveal the

67

immunological and virologic characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 re-positive cases.

Methods

70

Discharge criteria and after discharge measures for COVID-19 cases in Guangdong

71

Guangdong follows the Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme of SARS-CoV-2 released by the National Health

72

Commission of China with a little modification. The Discharge criteria a for COVID-19 cases in Guangdong

73

include: 1) Body temperature is back to normal for more than three days; 2) Respiratory symptoms improve

74

obviously; 3) Pulmonary imaging shows obvious absorption of inflammation, and 4) Nuclei acid tests negative

75

twice consecutively on both respiratory tract samples such as sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs and digestive

76

tract samples such as stool and anal swabs (sampling interval being at least 24 hours). The interventions

77

measures for discharged COVID-19 cases include: 1) all discharged COVID-19 cases are isolated in designated

78

hotels for another 14 days; 2) during the isolation, discharged cases live in well-ventilated single room, separate

79

dinning, practice hand hygiene and minimize close contact with others; 3) health status are monitored during the

80

isolation and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests are performed on 7th and 14th or more frequently after discharge; 4)

cases could back home only when nuclei acid tests are negative on both respiratory tract samples and digestive

82

tract samples during the isolation. The clinical outcome was categorized as mild, moderate, severe, and critical

as previously described (8).

85

Case definition and specimen collection

86

The term “re-positive case” in this study refers to the discharged cases who retested as SARS-CoV-2 positive

87

using real-time Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR; see below). In Guangdong, all

88

discharged COVID-19 cases were continuously isolated in designated hotels and samples including

89

nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs and anal swabs, were collected for RT-PCR diagnosis at 7 days and 14 days

90

after discharge, or more frequently. The demographic, clinical and laboratory information of all confirmed

91

COVID-19 cases were retrieved from Guangdong Provincial COVID-19 surveillance network.

92

93

Viral isolation and RT-PCR

94

Vero E6 cells were inoculated with 100 µl processed patient sample. Cytopathic effect (CPE) were observed daily.

95

If there was no CPE observed, cell lysis was collected by centrifugation after three repeated freeze-thaw and 100

96

µl supernatant were used for the second round of passage. For RT-PCR diagnosis, total RNA was extracted from

97

clinical specimens using the QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s

98

instructions. In this study, 3 RT-PCR kits were used to conduct nucleic acid testing, in an attempt to avoid the

99

occurrence of false negatives. Kit A (DAAN GENE, Guangzhou, China) and Kit B (BioGerm, Shanghai, China)

100

have primers and probes targeting the open reading frame (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N), respectively.

101

Kit C (Liferiver, Shanghai, China) is designed to detect RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope

102

protein (E) and N.

105

Serum samples were collected from re-positive cases, cases in hospitalization and general discharged COVID-19

106

cases at more than 21 days post illness onset. Microneutralization antibody assays for SARS-CoV-2 were

107

performed in a BSL-3 laboratory according to the standard protocol of a neutralization test. A local SARS-CoV-2

108

strain isolated from the first COVID-19 patient in Guangdong (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_403934) was

109

used microneutralization assay. All neutralizing antibody assays were run in 96-well microplates. Serum samples

110

were inactivated at 56°C for 30 mins before use, diluted two-fold from 1:4 to 1:1,024, and then incubated at 37°C

111

for 2 hours with equal volumes of 100 half tissue culture infective doses (100 TCID50). Thereafter, the mixture

112

was added into 96-well Vero-E6 cell culture plate. The viral-induced CPE was monitored daily for 7 days. All the

113

diluted samples were tested in duplicate. Cell control, serum control and virus control were included in each plate.

114

Virus back titration was conducted in each test. The antibody titre of the sample was defined as the highest dilution

115

that could inhibit CPE development in 50% of the virus-infected wells.

116

117

High-throughput sequencing

118

For the multiplex PCR approach, we followed the general method of multiplex PCR as described in

119

(https://artic.network/ncov-2019) (9). Briefly, multiplex PCR was performed with two pooled primer mixtures

120

and cDNA reverse-transcribed with random primers was used as a template. After 35 rounds of amplification,

121

PCR products were collected and quantified, followed by end-repairing and barcoding ligation. Around 50 fmol of

122

final library DNA was loaded onto the MinION sequencing device. The ARTIC bioinformatics pipeline for

123

COVID (https://artic.network/ncov-2019) was used to generate consensus sequences and call single nucleotide

124

changes relative to the reference sequence (MN908947). Assembly of the nanopore raw data was performed using

Statistical analysis

132

Statistical analyses were completed using R version 3.5.1 and GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San

134

analysis of variance (ANOVA) otherwise they were analysed using the Wilcoxon rank test and Kruskal-Wallis H

135

test. Categorical variables were compared using a Chi-square test or Fisher's Exact Test to assess deviation from

136

the null hypothesis. Spearman’s correlation was to assess the correlation between age and Neutralization antibody

Ethics Approval

140

This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Guangdong Provincial Center for

141

Disease Control and Prevention. Data collection and analysis of cases were determined by the Health Commission

142

of Guangdong province to be part of a continuing public health outbreak investigation during the emergency

143

response and were thus considered exempt from institutional review board approval.

Results

145

Clinical characteristics of re-positive cases

146

A total of 619 COVID-19 cases were discharged from designated hospitals between 23 January and 19 February,

147

2020. These cases were continuously isolated in designated hotels and were all screened for SARS-CoV-2 after

148

discharge (see details in Methods). Up to 25 February 2020, 87 cases (14%) retested as positive for SARS-CoV-2

149

RNA via RT-PCR and returned to the local designated hospital for isolation and medical observation. The

150

demographic characteristics of 87 re-positive cases are as follows: (i) the gender distribution was equal, with 45

151

males and 42 females; (ii) re-positive detection of viral RNA was observed in all age groups, ranging from 11

152

months to 68 years, with an average age of 30.4 years, which is significantly younger than that of general

153

COVID-19 patients in Guangdong (average age of 44.8 years, Table 1). Notably, all re-positive cases had only

154

mild (46) or moderate (41) clinical symptoms during initial hospitalization and first retested as SARS-CoV-2 viral

155

RNA positive at a mean of 6.7 days (range 3 to 10 days) post-discharge. Possibly due to their moderate clinical

156

symptoms, re-positive cases had shorter hospital stays (mean, 14.8 days) than general COVID-19 cases (mean,

157

20.1 days) (Table 1). After discharge, 77 of 87 re-positive cases were asymptomatic, and 10 cases had a symptom

158

of unproductive cough, mainly at night. Forty-four cases received computerized tomography (CT) examination,

159

and no abnormalities were reported.

160

161

Neutralizing antibody in re-positive cases

162

An impaired immune response has been associated with fatal COVID-19 infections that exhibit prolonged

163

persistence of viral RNA (13). One possible explanation for the re-positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is that

164

some COVID-19 patients may have insufficient immune responses and neutralization antibodies (NAbs) to clear

165

infection completely. To investigate the immunological and virological characteristics of re-positive COVID-19

166

cases, 70 of 87 re-positive cases were resampled by Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and

167

Prevention (GDCDC) between 22 February and 1 March, 2020 including 59 serums and 137 swab samples

168

(Figure 1A). Serum samples were collected at a median of 35 days post illness onset (ranging from 23 to 47 days).

169

As a comparation, 150 serum samples from general discharged cases (n=38) and cases in hospitalization (n=112)

170

were collected with a median duration from illness onset to serum sampling of 30 days (ranging from 22 to 47

171

days) and 32 days (ranging from 22 to 45 days), respectively. The titre of viral-specific NAbs was estimated by

172

microneutralization assay, which is regarded as a gold standard for determining protective antibodies. As shown in

173

Figure 1B, 58 of 59 (98.3%) re-positive cases developed NAbs with a titre >4, ranging from 4 to >1024. Our

174

results demonstrated competent immune activation in re-positive cases, which exhibit a distribution of NAbs titres

175

similar to that of general discharged cases and COVID-19 cases in hospitalization (Kruskal-Wallis H test, p=0.12,

176

Figure 1B).

177

178

Viral RNA detection and viral isolation in re-positive cases

179

A total of 137 swabs, including 51 nasopharyngeal swabs, 18 throat swabs and 68 anal swabs, were tested using

180

three different RT-PCR kits, in an attempt to reduce the chance of false negatives caused by difference in

181

sensitivity and primer specificity. Fifty re-positive cases had paired nasopharyngeal swabs and anal swabs, and

182

18 cases had paired throat swabs and anal swabs for viral RNA detection. Thirty-six swabs from 33 cases were

183

detected as positive by at least one RT-PCR kit (Table S1). RT-PCR positive rates were not statistically different

184

for different sample types in 68 paired samples (anal swabs vs nasopharyngeal swabs, and anal swabs vs throat

185

swabs; Chi-square test, p=0.648; Fisher exact test, p=0.443). In this cross-sectional analysis, 32 of 33 cases had

186

clear information on time intervals of illness onset, discharge and sample testing (Figure 2). We find that the

187

duration from discharge to the time tested as re-positive can range from 6 to 28 days (Figure 2). Importantly,

188

there was no correlation between neutralization antibody titre and the length of time between discharge and the

189

date the case tested as re-positive. For example, for Case 21, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was re-detected at 28 days after

190

discharge and 46 days post symptom onset, yet NAb titre for this case was as high as 1024 (Figure 2). The 36

191

RT-PCR positive samples including 14 nasopharyngeal swabs, 3 throat swabs and 19 anal swabs. These RT-PCR

192

positive samples were inoculated into Vero-E6 cell line but no live viruses could be cultured following two

193

rounds of cell passage.

194

195

Virus whole genome sequencing in re-positive cases

196

A previously study proved virus isolation success was also depended on viral load, and samples containing <10 6

197

copies/mL (or copies per sample) never yielded an isolate (3). For acute infection cases, we found that high

198

quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes could be obtained by using a multiplex PCR method even for samples with a low

199

viral load (8). Therefore, the successive detection of a complete or nearly complete viral genome may provide

200

clues on the status of viral replication. None of full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome could be obtained by

201

sequencing 94 samples from 54 patients and the sequencing coverage ranged from 0.00–75.48% (Figure 3A,

202

Table S1).

204

Intriguingly, a discrepancy was observed between the results of RT-PCR and multiplex PCR sequencing (Figure

205

3A & B). For instance, 21 of 33 samples that were RT-PCR positive did not perform well in sequencing and

206

produced sequences that covered < 10% of the virus genome (Figure 3B). Conversely, 12 samples detected as

207

negative by three RT-PCR kits gave rise to virus sequences that spanned >10% of the virus genome (Figure 3A

208

& 3B). This discrepancy could be expected when the viral genome was not intact and the primers in RT-PCR

209

and multiplex PCR targeting the different fragments of viral genome.

210

211

Sequencing results of matched samples from individual cases (anal swabs vs nasopharyngeal swabs, and anal

212

swabs vs throat swabs) showed that the genome coverage of sequences from digestive samples were

213

significantly higher than that of the matched respiratory swabs (Figure 3C). For case 6 and case 42 having

214

sequencing results of matched samples, we observed some single nucleotide variants (SNVs) between viral

215

genome sequences achieved from respiratory samples and that from digestive samples (Figure 3A).

216

217

Discussion

218

Tens of thousands of people have recovered from COVID-19 infection, and there have been preliminary reports

219

of people testing re-positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA after recovery [7,8]. Here, we use data from the

220

Guangdong COVID-19 surveillance system to analyse the characteristics of re-positive cases in Guangdong

221

between 23 January and 26 February, and we explore questions such as the percentage, immune status and

222

infectivity of re-positive cases.

224

The first question we addressed is the re-positive rate in COVID-19 discharged cases. Here, the discharge

225

criteria are according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme of SARS-CoV-2 (see Methods for detail). By

226

screening 619 discharged cases, up to 25 February, the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 re-positive cases is around

227

14%. According to the scheme, all discharged cases are continuously isolated in designated hotels with strict

228

interventions on diseases transmission. Thus, the identification of re-positive SARS-CoV-2 during the isolation

229

phase exclude the possibility that re-positive cases is caused by the secondary viral infection. Our results also

230

highlight a significant feature of re-positive cases. All re-re-positive cases in our study developed only mild or

231

moderate symptoms in the initial diagnosis, with the median age significantly lower than that of the general

232

COVID-19 cases (Table 1). The relatively mild symptoms may explain why the median time from onset to

233

discharge in re-positive cases (median 19.3 days) is slightly lower than that of the other discharged COVID-19

234

cases (median 24 days). It is unlikely that cases tested as re-positive because they were discharged too early

235

since all re-positive cases tested negative for both nasopharyngeal and anal swabs in two successive tests before

236

discharge. The time from symptom onset to discharge (the time when COVID-19 cases have twice tested

237

negative by PCR) for re-positive cases (median 19.3, Table 1) is consistent with the time that detectable

238

SARS-CoV-2 RNA is reported on other studies to persist (median 20) in respiratory sites (13, 14). These data

239

indicate that the course in re-positive cases is similar to other COVID-19 cases. The re-positive of SARS-CoV-2

240

RNA is not random and mainly observed in young cases without severe clinical symptoms.

241

242

Prolonged detection of virus RNA presents a challenge to targeted public health interventions. Therefore, it is

243

important to know if re-positive cases are infectious. One previously proposed reason for prolonged detection of

244

viral RNA in deceased patients is impaired neutralizing ability (13). Our microneutralization result shows that

58 of 59 (98%) re-positive cases generated specific NAbs to SARS-CoV-2, and their titre distribution is similar to

246

the normal recovered cases and hospitalized COVID-19 cases (Figure 1B). To investigate virus infectivity, we

247

attempted live virus isolation on different clinical samples from re-positive cases. All samples from re-positive

248

cases are diagnosed with higher CT values (Table S1) than our previous finding in acute infection cases. Due to

249

the limited sensitivity of culture method (3), infectivity may not accurately illustrated by the culture method

250

although no viral isolates were obtained from RT-PCR positive samples. Thus, we also perform the multiplex

251

PCR combined with high-throughput sequencing on these samples. The discrepancy we observed among

252

different RT-PCR kit results, as well as between RT-PCR and multiplex PCR sequencing results, suggests that

253

the virus genomes detected in re-positive cases could be highly degraded. We only recovered one virus sequence

254

with genome coverage >20% (34.5%) in 23 RT-PCR positive respiratory samples (Figure 3A). These results

255

suggest a low residual risk of infectivity of re-positive cases, especially from the respiratory transmission route.

256

257

Several limitations of our study should also be noted. First, we did not obtain successively collected samples,

258

resulting in the existence of bias toward the summarized duration from the discharge to firstly re-positive result

259

for viral RNA as well as the time of the re-positive RNA to negative. Secondly, we did not obtain the

260

corresponding samples during the acute infection for these re-positive cases. Therefore, some virologic

261

questions remain, including whether there any genetic differences for SARS-CoV-2 viruses sampled in an acute

262

infection phase and a re-positive phase. The significance of SNVs identified in different samples of re-positive

263

cases is limited by the sample size (Figure 3A) and should be further clarified in following studies.

265

Appropriate design intervention strategies on COVID-19 has been largely relied on how well we understand the

266

characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Re-positive of viral RNA in some discharged cases could raise a

267

challenge for disease interventions which means a prolonged isolation phase and a more requirement on hospital

268

isolation facilities. Our study result shows a comparable Nab response in re-positive cases comparing to other

269

COVID-19 cases. More importantly, none of infective strains could be successfully isolated and no intact viral

270

genome could be sequenced from all re-positive cases samples highlighting a lower risk for disease transmission

271

from such cases. The additional educations related on SARS-CoV-2 re-positive should be performed to calm

272

down the public panic and allocate of limited medical resources.
