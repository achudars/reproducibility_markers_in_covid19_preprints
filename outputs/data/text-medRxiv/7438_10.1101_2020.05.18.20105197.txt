Abstract
Background
The correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 and their longevity remain unclear. Studies in
severely ill individuals have identified robust cellular and humoral immune responses against the
virus. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 has also been described, but it is unknown
whether this is suﬃcient to produce antibody responses.
Methods
We performed a cross-sectional study recruiting 554 health care workers from University
Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust who were at work and asymptomatic. Participants
were tested for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab for real-time
polymerase chain reaction and for seroconversion by the measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein antibodies by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results were interpreted in the
context of previous, self-reported symptoms of illness consistent with COVID-19.
Results
The point prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, determined by the detection of SARS-CoV-2
RNA on nasopharnygeal swab was 2.39% (n=13/544). Serum was available on 516 participants.
The overall rate of seroconversion in the cohort was 24.4% (n=126/516). Individuals who had
previously experienced a symptomatic illness consistent with COVID-19 had significantly greater
seroconversion rates than those who had remained asymptomatic (37.5% vs 17.1%, χ2 =21.1034,
p<0.0001). In the week preceding peak COVID-19-related mortality at UHBFT, seroconversion
rates amongst those who were suﬀering from symptomatic illnesses peaked at 77.8%. Prior
symptomatic illness generated quantitatively higher antibody responses than asymptomatic
seroconversion. Seroconversion rates were highest amongst those working in housekeeping
(34.5%), acute medicine (33.3%) and general internal medicine (30.3%) with lower rates observed
in participants working in intensive care (14.8%) and emergency medicine (13.3%).

Conclusions
In a large cross-sectional seroprevalence study of health-care workers, we demonstrate that
asymptomatic seroconversion occurs, however prior symptomatic illness is associated with
quantitatively higher antibody responses. The identification that the potential for seroconversion in
health-care workers can associate diﬀerentially with certain hospital departments may inform
future infection control and occupational health practices.

Research in context
Evidence before the study
To date, no study has examined the cross-sectional seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibodies in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing evidence suggests
that the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies developing following infection may vary with disease
severity in keeping with previous coronavirus pandemics.
Added value of this study.
We demonstrate that seroconversion can occur in health care workers who have suﬀered no
previous symptoms of SARS-Cov-2 infection. However, prior symptomatic infection tends to drive
quantitatively superior antibody responses against the virus. We observed diﬀerential
seroconversion rates in individuals working within diﬀerent hospital departments. Using intensive
care as a reference, the relative risk for seroconversion was greatest for those working in
housekeeping, acute and general internal medicine.
Implications of all the available evidence
Insight into the current seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within a high-risk cohort of
health-care workers is of direct relevance as a reference point for future community serological
surveys. We provide further evidence of asymptomatic infection and seroconversion,
strengthening the argument for regular, routine screening of health-care workers. Finally, we
provide evidence that individuals working in particular roles within the NHS are at greater risk of
seroconversion with significant implications for their occupational health.

Introduction
The correlates of protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the immunological factors
that determine progression to severe disease remain uncertain. Previous outbreaks of SARS
provide limited insight as they focused on individuals with severe disease [1], a group that forms a
small fraction of the overall number of COVID-19 cases [2]. Nevertheless, robust cellular and
humoral responses are postulated to be necessary for temporary and certainly long-lasting
immunity.
Individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 requiring hospital admission have shown seroconversion
rates approaching 100% two weeks after symptom onset [3]. Preliminary data suggests the
magnitude of antibody responses against the virus and its neutralising capacity are proportional
to age and strong correlations have been observed between the presence of nucleoproteinspecific T cells and neutralising antibody titres [4]. While asymptomatic detection of SARS-CoV-2
RNA has been demonstrated in health care workers and pregnant mothers [5, 6], it remains
unclear whether asymptomatic infection can lead to an immune response, seroconversion and
sterilising immunity.
The seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in health care workers and the general
population is currently unknown. Cross-sectional studies that determine the seroprevalence of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can assist in defining prior exposure to the virus and, when followed
longitudinally, inform the potential eﬀectiveness of serum antibody status as a correlate of
protection against future disease. Health care workers provide a unique group to understand the
correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 because of their occupational exposure to the virus.
University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT) is one of the largest hospital
trusts in the UK with over 20,000 employees delivering care to 2.2 million people per annum. We
conducted a cross-sectional study of 554 staﬀ at UHBFT to determine the incidence of infection
and seroconversion in health care workers and their relationship to prior symptoms of COVID-19.

Methods
A cross-sectional study of health-care workers at University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust was
undertaken, recruiting 554 individuals over the course of 24 hours on 25/4/2020 across four
hospital sites serving central and east Birmingham. Invitation to participate in the study was made
using UHBFT trust email. All individuals voluntarily provided a nasopharyngeal swab for SARSCoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing and blood and saliva samples for anti-SARS-CoV-2
testing on a high-sensitivity ELISA developed at the University of Birmingham. At enrolment,
individuals were asked to retrospectively report any illnesses consistent with COVID-19 that they
had suﬀered in the previous four months.
Serum was available for analysis on 516 individuals (Table 1). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was
performed using real-time PCR (Viasure, CerTest Biotec) directed against the ORF1ab and N
genes following guanidine isothiocyanate inactivation of nasopharyngeal swabs. Serological
analysis was performed using a high-sensitivity ELISA developed in-house. Serological analysis
was performed at biological containment level 2. High-binding plates (Greiner Bio-One) were
coated with trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein [7, 8] and blocked with Stabilcoat solution
(Sigma Aldrich). Serum was pre-diluted 1:40 prior to analysis. A combined secondary layer
containing horse-radish peroxidase conjugated polyclonal antibodies against IgG, IgA and IgM
followed by 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine development was used to detect the presence of
antibodies. The cutoﬀ for positivity on the ELISA was set at 2 standard deviations above the mean
OD450 of eight pre-2019 negative sera run independently across seven separate plates.
Patient mortality data for the UHBFT was sourced from data submitted to NHS England. Indices
of deprivation in participants postcodes were sourced from 2019 national statistics published by
the UK Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government [9].
Data were analysed using Graph Pad Prism 8.4.2 for macOS. Significant diﬀerences in categorical
data were analysed using the Chi squared test. The Kolomogorov-Smirnov and Kruskal-Wallis
tests were used to compare distributions of optical density data. The Mann-Whitney U test was
used for all other purposes. Results were considered statistically significance if the p-value 0.05.
The study was approved by the London - Camden & Kings Cross Research Ethics Committee,
study number 282525. All participants provided written, informed consent prior to enrolment in
the study.

Results
The point prevalence of PCR positivity in asymptomatic health care workers at UHBFT on the
25/4/2020 was 2.39% (n=13/554).
Serum was available for further analysis on 516 individuals (Table 1). 26.3% (n=136/516) of these
individuals reported a prior illness consistent with COVID-19. To examine the relationship between
SARS-CoV-2 infection in staﬀ and COVID-19 caseload throughout the trust, the onset of
symptoms in health care workers with prior illnesses was mapped to weekly trust wide COVID-19
mortality and final seroconversion status on 25/4/2020 (Figure 1a). This showed that, in those
experiencing prior illnesses, the highest rates of seroconversion (77.8%, n=14/18) were observed
in the week beginning 28/3/2020, one week before the peak weekly mortality was reached within
UHBFT. No one developed symptoms in the two weeks before 25/04/2020 because they were
excluded from the study through self isolation at home. The overall seroconversion rate across the
cohort was 24.4% (n=126/516); individuals reporting a prior symptomatic illness had significantly
greater rates of seroconversion than those who had been asymptomatic throughout the timeperiod assessed (37.5% vs 17.1%, χ2 =21.1034, p<0.0001) (Figure 1b). Furthermore, antibody
responses in individuals who had experienced a prior symptomatic illness were quantitatively
greater than those who remained asymptomatic (Kruskal-Wallis statistic 7.159, p=0.02) (Figure
1c).
Rates of seroconversion were mapped to the departments where individuals work within UHBFT
(Figure 1d). Rates of seroconversion were highest in those working in housekeeping (34.5%,
n=10/29), acute medicine (33.3%, n=10/30) and general internal medicine (30.3%, n=30/99) with
the lowest rates observed in participants working in intensive care (14.8%, n=9/61) and
emergency medicine (13.3%, n=2/15) and general surgery (13.0%, n=3/23). Using intensive care
as a reference, the relative risk for seroconversion for those working in housekeeping was 2.34 (CI
1.03-5.36, p=0.04), acute medicine 2.25 (CI 1.03-4.97, p=0.04) and general internal medicine 2.05
(CI 1.05-4.03, p=0.04).
There was no significant diﬀerence in ethnodemographic data between individuals who had and
had not seroconverted by the time of the study including indices of deprivation within the
geographical postcode where study participants live (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). This
supports an interpretation that the observed diﬀerence in seroconversion rates are more likely due
to occupational risk, rather than external factors.

Discussion
We present a cross-sectional study of health care workers that simultaneously determines the
prevalence of infection and antibody seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2 in a group of healthcare workers employed by one of the largest NHS trusts in the United Kingdom.
The point prevalence of infection in health care workers in this study (2.39%) is concordant with
the results of a similar study performed in London during the same week [5] and less than the rate
of 14% observed in symptomatic health care workers in Newcastle on samples taken from March
10th to March 31st 2020 [10]. In contrast to these results, we report an overall seroconversion rate
of 24.4% across our cohort by 25/4/2020. This would suggest that PCR testing on
nasopharyngeal swabs consistently underestimates true infection rates [11]. In light of further
evidence of asymptomatic infection and seroconversion, the impact of mandatory screening of
health care workers should be thoroughly investigated [12]
The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies amongst the UK general population remains
unknown and few studies have considered seroprevalence in other populations. In Santa Clara,
California, the seroprevalence rate has been estimated at between 1.3 and 4.7%, significantly
lower than that found in the health-care worker cohort described herein, but this was assessed
using diﬀerent diagnostic methods [13]. In the SARS-CoV epidemic, the rate of seroconversion in
healthcare workers with SARS (88.9%) and in asymptomatic health care workers (1.4%) were
both higher than the general population (0.4%) suggesting increased seroprevalence due to
occupational risk. This also indicates that, even after exposure to this far more lethal virus,
seroconversion can occur without any accompanying symptomatology.
In our cohort, the relationship between prior symptomatic illness and seroconversion closely
followed the temporal epidemiology of the pandemic across the UK and at UHBFT. We cannot
exclude the possibility this study underestimates SARS-CoV-2 infections in health care workers
by failing to capture more recent infections that had not led to seroconversion by 25th April.
Longitudinal studies involving serial sampling will be necessary to provide up-dated assessments
of seroconversion and the longevity of antibody responses.
Individuals with prior symptomatic illnesses were significantly more likely to seroconvert than
asymptomatic individuals (35.8% vs 17.1%) and, in general, mount quantitatively greater antibody
responses, in keeping with studies from the SARS-CoV pandemic [14]. Future work must explore
the quality and longevity of antibody responses in individuals who have seroconverted, in
particular, whether neutralising anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist and provide sterilising
immunity [4].
Debate exists regarding nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to staﬀ [10] [15].
Seroconversion rates in our cohort were highest amongst housekeepers and those working in
acute and general internal medicine (32.7%). The explanation for this remains unclear; exposure
to the virus is necessary for seroconversion and it is plausible that exposure to the virus is greater
in these employees. In the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic, seroconversion rates were highest
amongst nurses and health-care assistants raising the possibility of diﬀerential occupational
exposure and risk [16].
To explore the possibility that occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is important compared with
exposure from outside of the health-care setting, indices of deprivation were considered in the
home postcodes of those who seroconverted compared to those who had not and no diﬀerences
were observed. Deprivation has been associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19,

although whether this is partly secondary to increased exposure to the virus is not known [17].
Knowledge of local and population rates of seroconversion will allow more accurate determination
of the relative risk of working in diﬀerent hospital environments and better inform infection control
and prevention measures.
In conclusion, we provide evidence of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in health care workers with
and without prior symptomatic illness. The magnitude of the antibody response is greater in those
with prior illness. We observe that the risk of seroconversion appears variable depending on
where individuals work within the hospital environment.
