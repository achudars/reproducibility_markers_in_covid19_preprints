Abstract
Background
Racialized and low income communities face disproportionally high rates of coronavirus 2019 (COVID19) infection and death. However, data on inequities in COVID-19 across granular categories of sociodemographic characteristics is more sparse.

Methods
Neighbourhood-level counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Ontario, Canada recorded as of July 28th,
2020 were extracted from provincial and local reportable infectious disease surveillance systems.
Associations between COVID-19 incidence and mortality and 18 neighbourhood-level measures of
immigration, race, housing and socio-economic characteristics were estimated with Poisson generalized
linear mixed models. Housing characteristic variables were subsequently added to models to explore if
housing may have a confounding influence on the relationships between immigration, race, and socioeconomic status and COVID-19 incidence.

Results
There were large inequities in COVID-19 incidence and mortality across the socio-demographic variables
examined. Neighbourhoods having a higher proportion immigrants, racialized populations, large

households and low socio-economic status were associated with COVID-19 risk. Adjusting for housing
characteristics, especially unsuitably crowded housing, attenuated COVID-19 risks. However persistent
risk remained for neighbourhoods having high proportions of immigrants, racialized populations, and
proportion of Black, Latin American, and South Asian residents.

Conclusions
Socio-demographic factors account for some of the neighbourhood-level differences in COVID-19 across
Ontario. Housing characteristics account for a portion, but not all, of the excess burden of COVID-19
experienced by immigrant, racialized, low income and low education populations.

Introduction

As the COVID-19 pandemic surges globally, racial and socio-economic inequities in coronavirus 2019
(COVID-19) infections and associated outcomes have emerged as critical public health priorities.[1]
Cumulating international evidence has documented disproportionately high rates of COVID-19 infection
and mortality experienced by racialized and low income populations. For example, early in the pandemic
it was observed that Black adults have four times higher odds of COVID-19 death than White adults in
the United Kingdom (UK); South Asian and mixed ethnicity individuals also have significantly higher odds
of death.[2] In the United States (US), nearly 70% of early COVID-19 deaths in Chicago, Illinois occurred
among Black individuals despite comprising only 30% of the population, with similar patterns observed
in other heavily affected areas during the emergence of COVID-19 in the US.[3] Overall, there has been a
dearth of US and Canadian COVID-19 surveillance data disaggregated according to important equity
stratifiers, such as race and socio-economic status, and when available, has often been incomplete.[4,5]
Better understanding the social distribution of COVID-19, particularly within local jurisdictions where
COVID-19 trends differ, is critical towards informing the design of equitable policy and intervention
strategies to reduce the burden of COVID-19.
Area-level measures of socio-economic status are commonly used to better understand inequities in
COVID-19 incidence and mortality when individual-level measures are not available. Ecological studies
using area-level measures have revealed widespread evidence of social inequities in COVID-19 incidence
and mortality associated with race, poverty, and residential crowding.[6–11] While these trends have
been consistently identified, the specific populations at risk and strength of association vary between
jurisdictions. With limited data available in Canada, evidence is urgently needed to understand the
extent to which COVID-19 outcomes and risk factors vary according to race and socioeconomic status in
a Canadian context.
In Ontario – Canada’s largest province by population – inequities in the burden of COVID-19 among both
ethno-racially diverse and low socioeconomic neighbourhoods have been identified.[12–14] While these
findings confirm that socio-demographic factors influence COVID-19 risk in Ontario, they lack the ability
to disaggregate findings by granular race and socio-economic categories. Further, these analyses do not
consider how housing characteristics, especially household size and overcrowding, may contribute to
the higher impact of COVID-19 in racialized and low socioeconomic communities. Therefore, the
objective of this study was to estimate the associations between neighbourhood socio-demographic
characteristics and neighbourhood-level incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in Ontario. Of primary
interest was to understand inequities across more granular categories of immigration, race, housing,
and socio-economic characteristics. A secondary objective was to evaluate if the association between
neighbourhood proportion of immigration, race, and socio-economic status and COVID-19 incidence was
independent of household characteristics.

Methods

Study Design and Population
We conducted a cross-sectional study using data extracted from provincial and local reportable
infectious disease surveillance systems (collectively known as CCM plus) which include all known COVID19 infections and deaths from Ontario, Canada reported between January 23, 2020 and July 28, 2020.
The study population includes all Ontario community residents reported to CCM plus who met the
provincial case definition for COVID-19 (i.e., positive nucleic acid amplification test). Due to relatively

poor representativeness of people living in institutions, congregate living settings, and Indigenous
communities living on reserves in the Canadian Census (from which exposure and denominator data are
derived), these populations were excluded from this study. Residents of institutional and congregate
living settings were identified and removed from our sample if they were flagged as such in CCM plus, or
their residential address was matched to a comprehensive list of addresses of known institutions and
congregate settings using a natural language processing algorithm. These settings and addresses include
long-term care facilities, retirement homes, shelters, correction or detention centres, hotels and motels,
group homes, hospitals, and on-site accommodations for farm workers.

Covariables
Neighbourhood socio-demographic characteristics were derived from the 2016 Census of Population
using Statistics Canada Aggregate Dissemination Areas (ADA) as the measure for neighbourhood.
Neighbourhoods with small populations (<1,000 people) were excluded due to stability concerns. On
average, neighbourhood populations ranged between 5,000 to 15,000 people. Case records from CCM
plus were assigned to a neighbourhood based on postal code of residence using Statistics Canada Postal
Code Conversion File (PCCF) plus version 7C. Eighteen neighbourhood-level socio-demographic
measures were included in this study, including: 1) eight measures of the proportion of immigration and
race (immigrants, recent immigrants (within five years), visible minority (non-white and non-Indigenous
population), Black, East/Southeast Asian, Latin American, Middle Eastern, and South Asian); 2) six
measures of housing characteristics (average household size, proportion multigenerational families
(households with at least one person living with a child and a grandparent), proportion unsuitably
crowded housing (according to the National Occupancy Standard on housing suitability based on
number of bedrooms and composition of the household), proportion of dwellings in apartments in
flat/duplex, proportion of dwellings in low-rise apartments (≤4 storey), and proportion of dwellings in
high-rise apartments (≥5 storeys)); and 3) four socio-economic status measures (labour force
participation (age ≥15 years), proportion without a high school diploma (age ≥25 years), proportion low
income (measured using after-tax low income cut-offs (LICO)), and proportion unaffordable housing
(spending >30% of income on housing)). Urban/rural geographic stratification was determined by
grouping neighbourhoods into four categories based on community size, population density, and level of
integration with a census metropolitan area or census agglomeration.[15]

Outcomes
Cumulative (until July 28, 2020) incidence and mortality rates were calculated using the 2016 census
population denominators, as more recent population projections were not available at the
neighbourhood-level. Postal code of residence, age group (<15, 15-64, and ≥65 years), sex (male,
female), case status, and outcome status were extracted from CCM plus.
This study received ethics approval from Public Health Ontario’s Research Ethics Board.

Statistical Analysis
Associations between neighbourhood-level characteristics and neighbourhood-level counts of COVID-19
infections and deaths were estimated by running a series of Poisson generalized linear mixed models
with random effects for neighbourhood, offset for neighbourhood population, using the ‘glmer’ package
in R. Bivariable models were used to estimate associations between neighbourhood measures of
immigration, race, housing, and socio-economic status and COVID-19 incidence and mortality.
Subsequent multivariable models were adjusted for individual-level age, sex, and neighbourhood
urban/rural geography. Model estimates were standardized to show relative risks and 95% confidence

intervals of COVID-19 incidence and mortality between the 10th (p10) and 90th (p90) percentile of each
neighbourhood socio-demographic characteristic.
To explore how housing characteristics may confound relationships between COVID-19 incidence and
neighbourhood-level immigration, race and socio-economic characteristics, an additional series of
multivariable models adjusting for housing characteristic variables (average household size, proportion
multigenerational families, and proportion unsuitably crowded housing) were run.

Results

Between January 23rd and July 28th, 38,984 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 were recorded in CCM
plus in Ontario. Of those, 37,343 individuals (96%) had a valid postal code record that was successfully
assigned to a neighbourhood. A further 8,822 (24%) residents of congregate settings, and 59 (0.5%)
Indigenous communities living on reserves or small neighbourhoods with populations <1,000 were
excluded. In total, our study population included 28,808 people with COVID-19 infection and 683 COVID19 deaths. Socio-demographic data were derived for 1,526 Ontario neighbourhoods.

COVID-19 incidence and mortality across neighbourhoods
The distribution of COVID-19 incidence and mortality varied across neighbourhoods in Ontario (Figure
1). The top 10% highest incidence neighbourhoods accounted for 36% of the cases. The highest rate of
COVID-19 incidence was 1,771 per 100,000. In nearly 70% of neighbourhoods, there were zero COVID-19
deaths and the top 10% highest mortality neighbourhoods accounted for 59% of all COVID-19 deaths.
The highest neighbourhood COVID-19 mortality rate was 96 per 100,000.
The 18 neighbourhood-level measures we explored are described in terms of composition of the
neighbourhoods (neighbourhood median and interdecile range), and incidence and mortality for
neighbourhoods in the lowest and highest decile of that characteristic (Table 1). For most
neighbourhood characteristics, the rates of COVID-19 incidence and mortality were higher among the
highest compared to lowest decile, with the exception for neighbourhood low-rise apartments, and
neighbourhood labour force participation. COVID-19 incidence was highest among the neighbourhoods
in the highest decile of proportion Black residents, and mortality was highest among the
neighbourhoods in the highest decile of unsuitably crowded housing.

Modeling estimates
The rate of COVID-19 incidence per 100,000 are plotted as a function of neighbourhood-level
immigration and race (Figure 2a), housing (Figure 2b), and socio-economic status (Figure 2c), with
bivariable regression estimates and lines marking the 10th and 90th percentile of each predictor’s
distribution. Across 16 of the 18 predictors, as the proportion of the neighbourhood-level characteristic
increases, so did the incidence of COVID-19. There was no association with proportion of low-rise
apartments, and as neighbourhood proportion with less than high school education increases, COVID-19
decreases.

COVID-19 incidence and mortality risk were estimated using both bivariable and multivariable models
(Table 3). Overall, our models estimate that neighbourhoods in the 90th percentile (p90) of sociodemographic characteristics were associated with higher rates of COVID-19 incidence and mortality
compared to neighbourhoods with in the 10th percentile (p10) of socio-demographic characteristics for
most unadjusted models. Adjusting for age, sex, and urban/rural geographies reduced the strength of
most associations.
Neighbourhoods with high labour force participation had lower rates of COVID-19 mortality compared
to neighbourhoods with low labour force participation. The proportion of low-rise apartments was not
associated with COVID-19 incidence or mortality (Table 3). Fully adjusted models also reversed the
protective association between neighbourhoods with the highest compared to lowest proportion of less
than high school education and COVID-19 incidence, controlling for confounding related to urban/rural
geographies.
The proportion of immigrants in a neighbourhood showed the strongest association with COVID-19, with
an incidence relative risk of 4.0 (95% CI: 3.5 – 4.5) and mortality relative risk of 5.2 (95% CI: 3.8 – 7.1) in
fully adjusted models. The proportion of visible minority residents showed stronger associations with
incidence and mortality compared to the proportion of residents from individual race groups.
Neighbourhood proportions of Black residents, followed by proportion South Asian residents, and
proportion Latin American residents show the strongest associations of individual race groups.

Adjusting for housing characteristics
Exploratory models that added housing characteristic terms to models of immigration, race and socioeconomic characteristics and COVID-19 incidence were run with adjustments for age-group, sex, and
urban/rural geography (Table 4). In most cases, adding housing characteristic predictors reduced the
association between immigration, race, and socio-economic status and COVID-19 incidence.
Of the housing characteristics, adjusting for unsuitably crowded housing had the greatest impact on
these associations. The association of neighbourhood proportion immigrants, visible minority status,
proportion of Black, Latin American, and South Asian residents and COVID-19 incidence were
attenuated, but persistent risk remained after adjusting for all household characteristics. However,
these adjustments produced null associations for neighbourhood proportion recent immigrants, Middle
Eastern, East/Southeast Asian, low income, less than high school education, and unaffordable housing.

Discussion

Linking COVID-19 surveillance data to neighbourhood-level characteristics from Ontario, Canada, this
study found higher COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates in neighbourhoods with a higher proportion
of immigrants, racialized populations, large households and low socio-economic status. These findings
highlight how structural barriers are acting as key determinants of COVID-19 inequities. Additionally,
housing characteristics, in particular unsuitably crowded housing, are important factors increasing
COVID-19 risk among immigrant, racialized and low socio-economic communities.
People living in the most marginalized neighbourhoods are experiencing elevated rates of COVID-19
outcomes, both in Canada[12,13] and internationally.[6,7,11,16–18] For example, US counties with the
highest compared to the lowest proportion of populations of colour and poverty had 4.9 and 1.7 times
higher rates of COVID-19 death.[7] Similarly in Canada, age-standardized COVID-19 mortality rates were
two times higher in neighbourhoods with the highest (>25%) compared to lowest (<1%) proportion of

visible minorities, although this varied by province with COVID-19 mortality rates 3.4 higher in
Ontario.[19] Our study adds to this body of evidence by examining associations between specific sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19 burden. We found neighbourhoods with a high proportion of
immigrants had four times higher risk of COVID-19 infection and 5.2 times higher risk of death, followed
by neighbourhoods with a high proportion of visible minority residents which had 3.3 times higher risk
of COVID-19 infection and 3.5 times higher risk of death. Further, the increased risk among
neighbourhoods with high proportions of Black, South Asian, and Latin American populations found in
our study are consistent with a a recent systematic-review and meta-analysis of 50 studies on individuallevel ethnicity and COVID-19 from the UK and US.[20]
Existing and persistent structural inequities put immigrant, racialized, and low-income communities at
higher risk of COVID-19 exposure and infection. Housing conditions, especially household size and
crowding, is an important predictor of COVID-19 transmission.[7,21,22] In Canada, 21.1% of racialized
individuals live in unsuitably crowded households, nearly four times the rate of non-racialized
individuals.[23] Additionally, immigrants are twice as likely to live in multigenerational households
compared to non-immigrants.[24] In our study, adjusting for measures of housing characteristics
attenuated the associations but social inequities in COVID-19 incidence remained, suggesting they play
an important role but do not fully explain the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on these
communities.
Low socio-economic status further accounts for excess COVID-19 burden experienced by immigrant and
racialized populations, impacting the ability to avoid COVID-19 infection at work. Evidence from the
literature describes significant risks of COVID-19 associated with occupations, especially those in
precarious employment, where it is difficult to distance from others, there is increased risk of exposure
to infections while at work, and employers are less likely to provide paid sick leave.[25–28] In Canada,
immigrant and racialized individuals are not only more likely to live in poverty,[29] but also
overrepresented in risky essential occupations. For example, immigrants and racialized populations in
Ontario are disproportionately employed in long-term care facilities as nurse aids, orderlies, and patient
service associates.[30] Further, COVID-19 testing data from Ontario confirmed that a disproportionate
number of immigrants diagnosed with COVID-19 were employed as health care workers.[31] Further
exploring the role that occupation and workplace settings has on contributing to inequities in COVID-19
transmission and negative outcomes in Ontario represents an important area of future study.
Other explanations for the stark inequities in COVID-19 outcomes found in this study may be rooted in
systematic barriers faced by racialized and newcomer populations.[32] In Canada, racism and other
structural determinants are an underlying cause of the overrepresentation of Black individuals having
lower socio-economic status and inadequate access to a regular doctor.[33,34] Racialized populations
also experience pre-existing health inequities, such as higher rates of comorbidities, which could also
contribute to greater vulnerability to severe COVID-19 outcomes.[35,36] However, data from the first
wave in Ontario showed that although incidence and mortality were higher among diverse
neighbourhoods, the case-fatality ratio was lower, suggesting that greater number of infections, and not
co-morbidities, was a driving cause for the increased rate of death.[12] Systemic racism has been
observed in other Western jurisdictions in ways that can contribute to increased COVID-19 risk. In the
US, racialized individuals are more likely to be incarcerated, which in turn increases the likelihood of
infection,[8] and racial discrimination in mortgage lending practices in urban areas may be a driving
factor in residential crowding among Black Americans.[37] In the UK, non-White physicians comprise the
vast majority of COVID-19 deaths among doctors and, compared to White physicians, are more likely to
report being under pressure to attend to patients without receiving the necessary physical
protection.[38]

This study is subject to some limitations. First, the number of COVID-19 cases included in this study is an
undercount of the true number of infections, and may be biased by changes in testing criteria during the
study period and differences in testing patterns between various socio-demographic populations.
However, recent Ontario research describing both the odds of having been tested for COVID-19 and the
odds of having received a positive COVID-19 diagnosis suggest that selection bias is not driving sociodemographic inequities in COVID-19 incidence in the province.[39] Additionally, the use of
neighbourhood-level measures of socio-demographic characteristics may dilute the real effect of these
characteristics on COVID-19 risks, as individual cases may not reflect the characteristics of the
neighbourhoods they live in. Previous Canadian studies comparing individual and area-level measures
have shown that even with relatively poor agreement between measures, area-level measures may be
describing important community-level effects that contribute to health inequities.[40] The collection of
individual-level socio-demographic data in Ontario during subsequent phases of the pandemic will allow
for future validation of our findings.
This study has several strengths. The ability to use postal code to link people with COVID-19 to census
data at the neighbourhood-level provides greater accuracy than is possible with most publically
available data on COVID-19. Additionally, we included a large number of socio-demographic
characteristics, notably the ability to examine specific immigration, race, housing and socio-economic
categories. Finally, this is the first study to demonstrate the impact that neighbourhood-level household
characteristics have on the associations between immigration, race, income and education and COVID19 incidence in Ontario. By including housing factors in our models, we have confirmed the importance
of housing as a focus for public health interventions.

Conclusion

Neighbourhood socio-demographic factors appear to explain much of the neighbourhood-level
variability in COVID-19 across Ontario. Housing characteristics, especially unsuitably crowded housing,
seem to account for a portion of the burden of COVID-19 experienced by immigrant, racialized, low
income and low education populations. These results suggest that prevention of household
transmission, in addition to culturally safe approaches to engaging with racialized communities and
communities living in poverty, are important public health strategies for reducing COVID-19 inequities.
Future research on COVID-19 inequities should focus how the relationship between the sociodemographic factors examined in this study and COVID-19 are confounded by occupation and workplace
characteristics.
