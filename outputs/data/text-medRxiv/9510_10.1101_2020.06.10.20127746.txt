Abstract
Objectives: Health events emerge from a multifactorial milieu involving host, community,
environment, and pathogen factors. Therefore, developing accurate forecasting models to
improve epidemic prediction towards better prevention and capabilities management is a
complex task. Here, we describe an exploratory analysis to identify non-health risk factors that
could improve the forecast and events risk signals using a feasible and practical approach by
combining surveillance report data with non-health data from open data sources. Methods: A
line listing was developed using information from the World Health Organization Disease
Outbreaks News from 2016-2018. A database was created merging the line listing data with nonhealth indicators from the World Bank. Poisson regression models employing forward
imputations were used to establish relationships and predict values over the dependent variable
(health event frequency); which are the health events reported by each country to WHO during
2016-2018. Findings: The resulting regression model provided evidence that changes in nonhealth factors important to community experiences impact the risk of the number of major health
events that a country could experience. Three non-health indicators (extrinsic factors) were
associated significantly to event frequency (population urban change, gross domestic product
change per capita—a novel factor, and average forest area). An exploratory analysis of the
current COVID-19 pandemic suggested similar associations, but confounding by global disease
burden is likely. Conclusion: Continued development of forecasting approaches capturing
available whole-of-society extrinsic factors (non-health factors); could improve the risk
management process through earlier hazard identification, and as importantly inform strategic
decision processes in multisectoral strategies to preventing, detecting, and responding to
pandemic-threat events.

Introduction
The challenge of employing infectious disease outbreak data usefully to help those
managing an emergency, and the need to purposefully develop models oriented to decision
makers and in a context of being connected to management, is increasingly recognized.(1) There
are several barriers to meeting these. Among them are availability of validated data before an
emergency to proof the model, and during an event to give actionable information. Such efforts
focus on early warning of an event or its trajectory. They often are anchored on specific
characteristics of how an outbreak pathogen behaves. This may result in clumsy applications of
information oriented in that way to a community-based perspective of what must be done to
prevent and mitigate risks. Here, we attack these challenges from the flank, pursuing in a pilot
analysis prediction in a broad stroke across many pathogens rather than early warning; seeking to
demonstrate potential utility of openly available information from both health and non-health
inter-agencies; and, exploring triggers meriting prevention and early mitigation efforts rather
than response.
The Disease Outbreak News (DON) by the World Health Organization is a major conduit
for information sharing relevant to state party obligations under the International Health
Regulations. Last published in 2007, the International Health Regulations includes an assessment
and notification tool to report events that may constitute a public health emergency of
international concern.(2) The outputs from this risk identification tool are translated into brief
reports for the DON. Each WHO Member State is meant to report events in accordance to these
Regulations.(2)

We aimed to 1) describe reported outbreak events impactful to communities via the
WHO Disease Outbreak News from 2016-2018; 2) identify and explore major extrinsic factors at
the population level potentially related to these events; and, 3) generate hypotheses regarding
associations between extrinsic factors and events for the purpose of identifying triggers for
enhanced surveillance, other health system strengthening, or holistic community interventions
that might later be investigated for either early risk mitigation or prevention of pandemic-threat
events. Detecting early risk signals boosts the risk management process (Figure 1) through
longer lead time for risk identification and characterization.
Methods
Information contained in WHO Disease Outbreaks News from 2016-2018 was reviewed,
and employed to construct a line listing. Each row of the line listing identified a single outbreak
(event) in a single country. Multiple reports corresponding to the same outbreak (or event) were
summarized within the same row. Outbreak information such as demographics and
epidemiological indicators were recorded, as available.
Extrinsic factors were defined as non-biological factors that could contribute to the risk
of a health event regardless of the pathogen involved. The main reason to understand extrinsic
factors and health events is to account for predictability. However, as outbreaks spread and
spatiotemporally separated waves become entangled with human mobility, behavioral changes,
pathogen evolution and other factors, the predictability of the models structures decrease despite
increasing time-series lengths.(3) This make the prediction of an event very complex. We
limited our study to evaluate a specific amount of predictors to explore extrinsic factors
associated with frequency of health events. In particular, we employed World Bank’s World
Development Indicators. They are internationally comparable statistics about global development

selected as community-centric risk factors which are routinely assessed and could inform a risk
management and prioritization process. We selected particular factors for their potential
relevance to communities’ vulnerability and exposure. Together with health event data, this
information combined in a model will served as a proxy to predict health events frequency (risk
signals) in a feasible and practical approach aim to impact the risk management process.
Data Management
Data was aggregated using country (N=96) as a grouping variable. Events’ frequency
(dependent variable) was summed and grouped per country. All the countries reported at least
one event within the timeframe analyzed. Independent variables related to economics, population
level and environment were collected at baseline and current years. Baseline values were
considered 10 years before (2006-2008) the DON reports included in the line list (2016-2018).
Independent indicators were extracted from the World Bank open data repository. This database
contains 1,600 time series indicators for 217 economies and more than 40 country groups from
the last 50 years.(4)
Statistical Analysis
For each independent variable an average delta (Δ) was calculated as the difference
between averages per annum baseline values (2006-2008) and average current per annum values
(2016-2018). Descriptive statistics were used to describe the health events in terms in terms of
age, sex, case count, death count and other variables. Nonparametric statistics were applied to the
dataset. Bi-variate analyses exploring associations included Spearman's Rank Correlation
Coefficient and Mann–Whitney U tests. Country comparisons to identify a potential confounding
factor related to economic reporting behaviors relevant to achieving aid was performed. Data

related to global health security funding commitments from 2014-2019 for the three countries in
our data set with the most and least absolute gross domestic product (GDP) change was retrieved
and compared using the Georgetown Infectious Disease Atlas.(5)
Poisson regression models employing forward imputations were used to establish
relationships and predict values over the dependent variable. Model fitting was assessed by
Omnibus Test (p<0.001) and the goodness of fit. Over-dispersion was evaluated by Pearson chiSquare value from the goodness of fit. All statistics were considered significant at p- value of
0.05. A Monte Carlo simulation was used using the predicting model equation obtained from the
Poisson regression model to explore model performance.All input variables were fitted before
running the simulation model.
Results
From 2016 -2018, a total of 96 countries reported to WHO through the Disease Outbreak
News the amount of 155 health events from 29 different pathogens (Figure 2a). The top five
pathogens/ disease events reported are displayed in Figure 2b. The Zika outbreaks represented
the 18.7% of the health evens reported, followed by MERS-CoV (11.0%) and Yellow Fever
(8.4%). A Dengue virus event was the largest reported with more than 94,000 cases, followed by
cholera with 27,978 cases. The demographic characteristics of the countries with more health
events and least health events reported are depicted on Table 1. We observed no overall trend
when comparing demographic indicators between countries with the highest number of reported
health events against those with the number reported (a single report).
Extrinsic factors tested against health event frequency are described in Table 2. Total
population and GDP per capital had the greatest magnitude of change. The least changing factor

was female population with an overall mean change of -0.17 %.

Bivariate Poisson models

results showed that the extrinsic factors GDP per capita change, urban population change, and
current average forest area were significantly associated with health event frequency (p=0.000,
0.004, and 0.000, respectively). Net migration change factor was the least related factor
(p=0.838).
After testing all covariates (nine in total) against the dependent variable: health event
frequency, multiple models were constructed. The final Poisson model includes three variables
associated significantly to event frequency (population urban change, GDP change per capita,
and the average forest area (2016-2018 current average)) and a fourth variable (percent of trade
change), which is not statistically significant alone in the model but appears to interact with the
other covariates (Table 3). The model suggests that an increase in the GDP change increases the
likelihood of an event by 1% (p=0.00), increase in urban population change raises the likelihood
by 7.2% (p=0.011), and an increase in average forest area (sq. meter) increases the likelihood by
27.9% (p=0.002). Model adequacy obtained from the goodness-of-fit Pearson chi-square was
0.850, suggesting a good fit of our data to a Poisson distribution in the regression. The likelihood
ratio chi – square for model effects showed GDP change per capita, population urban change and
average forest area have an discernible effect ( p<0.05).
Results related to model performance continued to show strong correlations with GDP
change per capita, population urban change and average forest area in Monte Carlo
simulations. A total of 71,075 cases were simulated using Monte Carlo method to meet the
confidence interval of the mean of the target variables (health events), at the 95% confidence
level. The tornado chart (Figure 3a) shows a strong Pearson correlation between health events
and GDP per capita change (adjusted) of 0.85 and moderate correlations for the input variables

population urban change and current average forest area (adjusted) with correlation coefficients
of 0.54 and 0.40, respectively. The probability density chart (Figure 3b) displayed the
distribution of the target variable (health events frequency) simulated by Monte Carlo Method.
Results show a probability of 14% to have more than two health events and a probability of
87.9% to have at least one health event with our Poisson model indicators.
A confounding analysis related to economic reporting behaviors was performed. It
showed Venezuela, Nigeria, and the United States with the most GDP change; and, Haiti,
Bahrain, and Pakistan with the least change. Among the low- and middle-income countries,
global health security funds commitments were comparable for size with the exception of
Venezuela; however, given the political distance between the major global health security donors
and that country during the time period, this was not surprising. After evaluating comparisons
among countries, an economic reporting bias was not found.
In light of the on-going novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) public health emergency
of international concern (PHEIC), we undertook an additional exploratory analysis of current
COVID-19 cases reported in the countries included in our dataset. Two of our non-health
indicators are also significantly correlated with COVID-19 reported cases. The correlation
analysis showed GDP change per capita (p= 0.024) and average forest area (p<0.001) linkages to
COVID-19 case counts. This is further supported with a linear regression model demonstrating
that GDP change per capita, average forest area, and urban population change influence the
outcome variable, in this case, COVID-19 cases reported (p<0.001). An R=0.5 suggests
moderate correlation, and a 32% variance proportion in the dependent variable (COVID-19
reported cases, R2) can be predicted from these same three variable.

Research that pushes how surveillance and related activities happen is important.(6)
Doing so can be challenging for many reasons. Medical intelligence and surveillance are
increasingly multisectoral in nature resulting in many stakeholders which both compete and
collaborate. Nonetheless, opportunities for enhancing public health practice exist in terms of
increased scientific rigor, outcomes-focused research, and health informatics.(6) We sought a
novel application of unconventional data for these purposes, selecting the WHO Disease
Outbreak News because the events matter to communities, and the World Bank development
factors as they reflect large aspects of community wellness. We applied them holistically in a
way which mitigates their internal validity issues.
This regression model only includes those WHO countries which reported events during
2016-2018, resting on premises that past experiences are related to future experiences, and that
these countries offer lessons for those which have not yet reported such events, even if they may
have experienced analogous ones.
Our study evaluated a total of nine extrinsic factors; four of these were significantly
related to frequency of a reported emerging infectious diseases event, with the average forest
area sq. meter being the extrinsic factor with the highest effect, as shown in the Poisson model.
Our simulation model showed that there is an 87% probability that a country will experience a
health event during a three year observation period if it has undergone significant GDP, trade,
and population changes in the previous 10 years while having a large forest area. Moving
forward, intrinsic factors related to the health event must be incorporated, or a tiered approach
adopted, in order to have a fuller picture of community and patient vulnerabilities for an event.
Previous studies have showed that extrinsic factors are associated with health; such as
green space area, population density, wealth, education and others.(7-10) Our results showed an

association between forest area and health events. More forest area available was associated with
an increasing risk of a reported emerging infectious diseases event. Changes in land cover and
land use, including forest area change (particularly deforestation and forest fragmentation),
urbanization (which is included in our model as population urban change), and agricultural
intensification are major factors contributing to the surge in infectious diseases.(11) A recent
study sought to forecast the next forest-based emerging infectious disease and concluded that
southern and eastern forests around Freetown in Sierra Leone, the forest region around Douala in
Cameroon, or the southern forest region in Nigeria were potential upcoming originating centers
of emerging infectious disease.(12) These regions have extensive forest areas, consistent with
our model forecast, presumably from increased opportunities for zoonotic cross-over events.
Exposure time is a dominant feature of risk.
Urban population change had a moderate association to health events in our model. In
2014, WHO asserted that urban areas held 54% of the total global population.(13) This ratio is
expected to increase from 55% in 2018 (some 4.2 billion people) to 68% by 2050.(14) Our
findings suggest that undergoing an urban population change increases risk of a health event.
Whether this is better explained by forest incursion from urbanization; human consolidation and
so increased human: human exposure time; aspects of domestic travel and draw from more wild
fringe areas prone to sentinel zoonotic events; or, other root causes is less clear. Incorporation of
more local market and migration factors could assist in making these distinctions. Regardless,
with rapid global urbanization, understanding relationships between the changing urban
environment and human health is vital. Urban environments play an indispensable role in
influencing human health and wellbeing.(15)

Human population density has been recognized as a putative driver of emerging
infectious diseases.(16) Human behavioral changes regarding movement and urbanization are
thought to contribute to this.(17) Megacities may serve as incubators for new epidemics and
zoonotic diseases of rapid spread.(18) Sporadic encounters between wildlife and humans in
urban areas may become more frequent in peri-urban settings resulting in greater exposures to
parasites, Dengue virus, cholera, tuberculosis, Lyme, and other threats.(16, 17, 19-23)
Our statistically strongest association rested with whether the gross domestic product of a
country had undergone change in the intervening decade. Studies have shown associations
between GDP and health outcomes, as well as increased health care expenditures and GDP
growth.(24, 25) We specifically tested whether a changing GDP changed risk for a health event.
This bore from our suspicion that whether increasing or decreasing, a changing GDP indicated a
condition under which communities must adapt in ways that seek new markets and ways of
instigating commerce, sporadic and sustained forest contact, and evolving interactions with
urban areas. Indeed, our results demonstrate the novel risk indicator that actual increasing GDP
change per capita increases the probability of an emerging infectious diseases event. This
suggests that all countries are vulnerable to this effect regardless of baseline GDP.
There are new initiatives aimed at how risk models for infectious diseases are developed,
such as the Epidemic Prediction Initiative from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.(26) While this initiative is meant to facilitate open forecasting projects towards
public health decision making, they are targeted to explore specific pathogens, diseases, or
vectors (e.g. Dengue, influenza, Aedes aegypti, and Aedes albopictus).(26) Our approach may be
particularly useful for whole-of-society planning and operational health emergency risk
management processes, such as called upon in the Joint External Evaluation monitoring progress

in country attainment of IHR 2005 capacities, as well as other capability development and
exercise initiatives.(27)
The main advantages of our approach are model simplicity; ready hypothesis generation
from existing open source, long-lived data mechanisms; and, the ability to be adapted to specific
epidemiological scenarios including contextual layering on current pathogen-specific prediction
models. Employing non-health factors may improve a variety of models’ accuracy when
predicting risks from pandemic threats. It offers readily observable triggers for public health
strategic decision making and resource allocation; and, it may improve event-based surveillance.
(28)
Our exploration into these effects’s impact on COVID-19 risk were limited. However,
these results suggest that COVID-19 disease dynamics (e.g. outbreak magnitude, cases, death
toll) when reported could be affected by the non-health indicators identified in our findings. The
analysis may have heavily confounding by the pervasiveness of COVID-19 in the pandemic
setting.
Our main limitations revolve around data collection in low resourced settings and
reporting in politically associated systems. Variability existed in how data was reported in the
WHO Disease Outbreak News. Demographical characteristics and epidemiological indicators
were sometimes non-specific or missing. Under-reporting of cases occurred. For example, while
Ebola virus disease, influenza, and Zika events were reported when the outbreak started in the
country, subsequent reports of the outbreaks were omitted or contained limited information.
Data extraction was made from WHO DON reports, therefore all the countries incorporated in
analysis have at least one event reported. On one hand this introduces bias and limits the
applicability of the findings to the non- reporting countries on the studied timeframe, on the other

hand countries without a report at all were relatively few and the presence of at least one report
indicates that the country will and has the mechanism to report. While our confounding analysis
regarding country wealth, funding, and reporting behaviors yielded reassuring results,
confounding may still be present.
Conclusion
Our exploratory analysis demonstrates that non-health factors are associated with whether
a country experiences a significant health event from an emerging or re-emerging infectious
disease, based upon major health events (e.g. infectious diseases outbreaks) reported by WHO
state members between 2016-2018. In addition to urban population, forest area, and trade, we
identified a novel factor, GDP per capita change, which had the statistically strongest association
in our model. Further exploration of dynamic non-health extrinsic factors as tools in prediction
of such events anchored in community-centered outcomes is merited. Even now, the model may
be useful in use case applications to contextualize whole-of-society threat planning processes and
medical intelligence leading to public health decision-making for priority surveillance and other
health and non-health investments.
