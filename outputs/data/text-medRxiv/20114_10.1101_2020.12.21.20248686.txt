Abstract
Study Design: A prospective cross-sectional survey.
Objective: The study aimed to examine the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) of
people living with Spinal cord injury (SCI) towards COVID-19 and their psychological status
during in-patient rehabilitation in Bangladesh.
Setting: The Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralyzed (CRP) and the National Institute
of Traumatology and Orthopedic Rehabilitation (NITOR), two tertiary level hospitals in
Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Methods: From July to September 2020, a prospective, cross-sectional survey of SCI
subjects, 13-78 years of age, carried out in two SCI rehab centers in Bangladesh. Data has
been collected by face to face interview through a pretested, and language validated
questionnaire on KAP and Depression, Anxiety, Stress (DASS). Ethical approval and trial
registration obtained prospectively. As all the patients were previously living with Spinal
cord injury (SCI), therefore, all the patients admitted/ attend SCI rehab centers were
considered as SCI positive samples.
Results: A total of 207 people with SCI responded, 87%were male, and 13% were female
with mean age34.18±12.9 years. 33.8% was tetraplegic and 66.2% was paraplegic and 63.8%
of them were diagnosed ASIA-A, with motor score 45.38±19.5, sensory score 97.2±52, SpO2
95.07±3.3, and Vo2max 35.7±3.7mL/kg/min. 178 people had at least one health issue.
Overall knowledge score was 8.59±2.3 out of 12, depression 11.18±8, anxiety 7.72±5.1, and
stress was 9.32±6.7 from a total of 21 scores each. There was a correlation between
Knowledge and DASS with age (P<.05); and Knowledge with gender (P<.05), and education
(P<.01). Binary logistic regression found a higher association of Knowledge and DASS with
gender (OR 6.6, 6.6, .95, 6.6; P<.01); and young age (OR.418, P<.01), illiterate (OR3.81,
P<.01), and rural people (OR.48, P<.05) with knowledge. A linear relation was noted

between depression and anxiety scores (r.45, P<.01) and stress scores (r.58, P<.01). A
positive attitude was reported for the majority of subjects. SCI Persons reported they and the
caregiver followed health advisory in consulting health professionals (65.7%), isolation
(63.8%), droplet precaution (87.4%), and hygiene (90.3%).
Conclusions: During in-patient rehabilitation in Bangladesh, the majority of SCI reported
that they had communicated with health professionals and practiced behaviors that would
reduce transmission and risk of COVID-19.

Introduction
Bangladesh is in a steady status of COVID-19 cases and is expected to experience the second
phase of transmission from December 2020 [1]. Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control
and Research (IEDCR) reports 417,475 cases have been diagnosed for COVID-19, among
them, 6036 cases died from March 8 2020 to November 8, 2020 [2]. Among the affected
cases 54% were aged 21-40 years, males were 71% and among the death cases 39% were
aged more than 60, and 29.6% were aged 50-60 years. A low death rate has been observed in
active age 21-40 years (11.33%) and a high death rate for Male (77%) among the confirmed
cases in Bangladesh [3]. UN called for a disability-inclusive response for COVID-19 [4].
Bangladesh has 10-15% of persons with disabilities (PWD’s) and 80% of them live in rural
areas [5-6]. There are many confounding factors and doubts regarding the testing and
protection of PWD’s from COVID-19 in Bangladesh [7]. WHO expressed concerns regarding
the accessibility of proper information and knowledge on COVID-19 for the PWD’s and
urged them to consider the physical, environmental and psychosocial barriers to following the
health advisory for them [8].

Sound knowledge on COVID-19 has a relationship with a positive attitude and practicing
recommended health advisory in Bangladesh [9]. The study also reflects that using a mask is
a key practice along with other advisories to prevent COVID-19 [10]. The study found a
strong linear correlation between the knowledge of COVID-19 and the practice of wearing a
mask in Bangladeshi general people [9]. Hence, there is no study on Knowledge, attitude and
practice towards COVID-19 for any specific group of Persons with disabilities or vulnerable
communities in Bangladesh. COVID-19 also has a profound Psychological impact on general
people, Bangladeshi people are in fear [9], depressed and anxious [11] and the collective
psychological issues may have a long term impact on them [12]. There are profound Psychosocial and economic impacts on persons with disabilities also [13]. Spinal cord injury is a
devastating [23, 25], challenging [18], longlasting diverse type of functional impairments that
leads to temporary or permanent functional impairments [17]. The survivors of Spinal Cord
Injury (SCI) are among the vulnerable communities who require life-long care and face
several Physical [14], environmental [15], and psycho-social barriers [16] in the community.
Bangladesh has more male dominant, active aged (21-40 years) and complete SCI people
who are largely dependent on caregivers and are at risk of several comorbidities [14]. The
study recommends SCI people have a real concern of fatality if they are infected with
COVID-19 so there is an urgency to protect them [17]. As Bangladeshis have been shown a
positive relationship among knowledge, attitude, and practice that is key to prevent COVID19; there are recommendations from scholarly paper to evaluate the KAP and Psychological
status for the people with disabilities also [9].
In the pandemic period, this was not possible to collect data on KAP and the psychological
status of SCI people in the community. This study aims to find out the Knowledge, attitude,
and practice (KAP) of people living with SCI towards COVID-19 and explore their anxiety,

Bangladesh.
Methods
Study design
The study was a prospective cross-sectional survey of the Persons living with Spinal Cord
Injury (SCI) during in-patient rehabilitation in Bangladesh.
Participants
From July to September 2020 SCI admitted in-patient subjects, all ages, and all genders
carried out in two SCI rehab centers in Bangladesh. The patients who are unwilling to
respond were excluded from the study. The sample size was not calculated as all the admitted
cases from July to September 2020 have been taken as the sample.
Setting
The study was carried out in the Spinal Cord Injury Unit of the Centre for the Rehabilitation
of the Paralyzed (CRP) and the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedic
Rehabilitation (NITOR).
Questionnaire
The questionnaire was structured, validated, translated, and customized to fulfill the
objectives of the study. The socio-demographic questions (Table 1) were customized to
Spinal Cord Injury. The knowledge question was a 12 score pretested questionnaire taken
from a Chinese study [18], customized, translated, and used in a population-based study in
Bangladesh [9,10]. The health status and co-morbidity questionnaire were modified for SCI
respondents and taken from a population-based study [10]. There were Categorical answers
to attitudes and beliefs towards the control of the pandemic, and practices of wearing masks
and avoiding public gatherings. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress have been assessed by
DASS-21, which is validated [19] to use in SCI subjects. DASS -21 has 21 scores of

Depression, Anxiety, and Stress each. For language validation, the questionnaire was
translated in forwarding and backward translation to English and Bangla by a group led by a
Bilingual British researcher. Later it was evaluated and commented on by a bilingual
epidemiologist, a psychiatrist and a clinician experienced working for SCI-related researches.
Data Collection procedure
From July to September 2020, a group of trained data collectors collected the data by face to
face interview in the in-patient SCI unit of Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed
(CRP) and the National Institute of Traumatology &Orthopaedic Rehabilitation (NITOR). All
the admitted subjects responded to the survey. The questionnaire was asked by the data
collector and answers have been documented by them. A total of 207 cases were admitted in
the two separate hospitals and all the data has been collected and found eligible (all age
groups, willing to participate and no sign and symptoms of COVID 19)to analyze after data
audit. The respondents were representing two of the only designated SCI rehabilitation
centers in Bangladesh. So it represents all the in-patient SCI peoples in Bangladesh.
Statistical Analysis
The knowledge score was calculated out of 12 scores as per the correct answers provided and
considered as continuous data. The attitude and practice answers were categorical data and
DASS-21 is calculated separately in depression, anxiety, and stress out of 21 scores, those are
continuous data. Descriptive statistics employed in socio-demographic data, to measure
relationships among continuous and categorical data-independent sample t-test for
dichotomous data or Chi-square test for more than 2 categories responded. Further Binary
logistic regression has been employed using dichotomous variables as the dependent variable
and KAP and DASS 21 as covariates. The Pearson test has been used to measure the
relationship between two continuous variables. A Chi-square test has been used to determine
the relationship between categorical variables. Data analysis was done using the Statistical

Results
Socio-demographics
The socio-demographic data of the SCI respondent was shown in Table 1. It has been found
that 207 respondents responded, 180 were male and 27 were female. The mean age was
34.18± 12.9 years, Majority of the respondents (70.5%)were aged 19-40 years and 21.25%
were aged 41-60 years. The majority of the respondents were with secondary education
(27%) and 20% of the respondents were illiterate. 70% of the respondents were from CRP
and 67% used to live in rural areas. Respondents represent all the administrative divisions of
Bangladesh. The majority of the participants (63%) were diagnosed ASIA A and 178 people
(85%) reported to have any one of the SCI related complications or COVID-19 related comorbidities.
Health status and comorbidity
Among the respondents 33.8% were tetraplegic and 66.2% were paraplegic. 63.8% of the
admitted SCI people had been diagnosed as ASIA A. In the International Standard for
Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) the mean motor score was
45.38±19.5 out of 100 and the sensory score mean was 97.2±52 out of 253.

Oxygen

saturation (SpO2) mean was 95.07±3.3 and the maximum rate of oxygen consumption
(Vo2max) found was35.7±3.7 mL/kg/min. 178 people (85%) reported having any one of the
SCI related complications or COVID-19 related co-morbidities. From multiple response
analysis comorbidities are heart disease 2.5%, Hypertension 5%, existing respiratory disease
( mostly COPD) 5.7%, Diabetes 1.7%, ulcer and GIT disease 2.7%, Chronic Kidney disease
1%, Chronic liver disease 0.2%, existing pressure sore 18.8%, depressive symptoms 15.1%,

urinary tract infection 5.9% postural hypotension 7.7%, bowel bladder complication 20.3%
and spasticity 13.3%
Knowledge
The overall mean knowledge score was 8.59± 2.3 out of 12. Females had a greater mean
(12.15±9.4) than males (11.04±7.8). There was a higher knowledge score in the age group
19-40 years (9.06±2.07) but all age groups had a mean of more than 7. The graduates have
more knowledge (10.1±1.9) but the illiterate people also have sufficient knowledge of
COVID-19 (8.21±2.0). CRP (8.53±2) and NITOR (8.72±2.3) have similar knowledge scores,
also the knowledge found satisfactory in rural and urban dwellers. The SCI originated from
the Dhaka division has a knowledge score of 8.27±2.1, hence 12 respondents originated from
the Rangpur division had a knowledge score of 2.50±2.3. SCI with all the ASIA diagnostic
criteria had similar knowledge scores and people with comorbidity had similar knowledge
scores (8.56± 2.3) than without comorbidity (8.76±2.1). Statistical association observe with
gender and knowledge (t=2.06, p< .05), age with knowledge (X2 = 56.18, p< .05), education
and knowledge score ( X2= 75.2, p< .01) and geography with knowledge score ( X2= 1.78,
p< .01). Details are supplied in table 1.
In table 2, Binary logistic regression found relationship with knowledge score and gender
(X2=11.07, OR= 6.6, p< .01), knowledge score with 19 to 40 years vs others (X2=29.9, OR=

Attitude
The majority of the respondent beyond age, gender, geography had a positive attitude
towards preventing COVID-19. Table 4 shows, the statistical relationship between education
and belief in control (X2= 14.0, p<.05), living area with belief in control (X2= 9.4, p< .05),
and geography with a positive attitude ( X2= 4.19, p<.05).
Practice
The majority of the respondents (66%) did not go to the crowd and 80% wear a mask during
every exposure. 32% of the male respondents went to the crowd at least one time and 39% of
the female respondents went to the crowd once during the lockdown period. 18% of the male
did not wear the mask and 17% of females did not wear a mask during exposure to outside
people. There was a statistically significant relationship found with age and practice of
wearing the mask ( X2= 17.6, p<.05), geography with staying isolated (X2=6.4, p<.05), and
complete SCI with practice wearing mask ( X2=17.9. p,.05). Details are in table 4. SCI
Persons reported they and the caregiver followed health advisory in consulting health
professionals (65.7%), isolation (63.8%), droplet precaution (87.4%), and hygiene (90.3%).
Depression
The overall mean depression score was 11.18±8 out of 21. Females had higher depression
(12.15±9.4) than men (11.04±7.8). Elderly people, more than 60 years old had higher
depression (13.8±7.8) than other age groups. Urban people had more depression (12.76±10)
than rural or semi-urban dwellers. The persons with SCI having comorbidities showed a
higher level (11.34±8) of depression. There was a relationship between depression with age
(X2=82.31, p<.05) (Table 1). Table 2 shows, Male had more depression than females (X2=28,
OR=6.6, p<.01) and the young age people aged 19 to 40 years had more depression than
others (X2=12.38, OR=.418, p<.01). illiterate people were in high depression than literate
(X2=1.33, OR=3.8, p<.05), rural people showed higher depression than urban people and SCI

people diagnosed with ASIA A were highly depressed than incomplete SCI ( X2=14.05,
OR=.56, p<.01). Table 3 represents statistical relationships among depression and anxiety (r=
.45, p<.01), and depression with stress (r= .58, p<.01).
Anxiety
The overall mean depression score was 7.72±5.1 out of 21. Table 1, represents females
(8.81±6.6) had a higher anxiety score than males (7.56±4.9). Persons aged 41 to 60 years had
more anxiety (8.41±4.9), the person having higher secondary education (8.46±5.4), urban
people (9±7.8), incomplete paraplegic (8.40±6.7), and the person with comorbidities shown
higher anxiety level (7.81±5.3). Binary logistic regression did not find any relationship
between the anxiety score and any specific group variables. Pearson correlation found highly
statistical significance (p<.01) of the relationship between anxiety with depression (r= .45)
and anxiety with stress (r=.47) (table 3).
Stress
The overall mean depression score was 9.32± 6.7 out of 21. Females had higher stress
(10.67±11.2) than males (9.12±5.8) (table 1). Binary logistic regression results similar
(X2=1.108, OR= 6.6, p<.01) (Table 2). In table 3,the relationship was found with stress and
depression (r= .58, p<.01) and anxiety (r=.476, p<.01) (Table 3).
Discussion
The survey aimed to find out the Knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of people living
with SCI towards COVID-19 and determine their anxiety, depression, and stress during inpatient rehabilitation in Bangladesh. All of the 207 in-patient rehab patients admitted in two
dedicated spinal injury units of two renounced rehabilitation centers from July-September
2020 responded to the survey. Data are scarce on the exact prevalence of SCI; hence CRP
accommodates 390 SCI patients that is one of the largest facilities in LMIC’s of the World
[20]. SCI’s are one of the most vulnerable groups of persons with disabilities having diverse

Physical, environmental and psycho-social impairments [20] and perceived death of every
one of five people within 2 years of discharge from hospital [21]. The survey found a
satisfactory overall knowledge about COVID-19 (8.59±2.3 out of 12), and a positive attitude
and practice with the general population (8.71±1.64 out of 12) in Bangladesh [9]. The reason
might be a series of patient education and awareness activities [22] made by the rehabilitation
centers during their uninterrupted service provision in the COVID-19 Pandemic. There were
nearly 36 COVID-19 positive cases among the respondents who were later diagnosed by
Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test at CRP, a few of them needed critical
care but none reported the death.
The materials and tools were satisfactory. Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP)
questions were validated and used in a population-based survey of 2157 respondents in
Bangladesh [10]. The knowledge score was more in females in this study, similar findings
attributed in that population-based survey. Additionally, some questions were added related
to the practice of additional health advisory for the SCI people and their caregivers. DASS-21
is validated for SCI cases [19], hence the appropriate process of forwarding and backward
translation and expert opinion has been taken before using the tools.
The respondents were male-dominant aged 19-40 years, the majority was diagnosed as
ASIA-A, were rural dwellers, and with a co-morbidity. This is a common feature as young
males living in rural areas are more prone to risks associated with SCI, and five years
epidemiological study reports more than 80% of admitted SCI’s are male, 55% with age
range 19-40 years, 69% lived in rural areas and 60% were diagnosed as ASIA-A [23]. The
co-morbidity of SCI people is common in many aspects ranging from pain, respiratory issues,
pressure ulcers, cardiovascular, nephrology, and physical inactivity in almost every SCI
survivors; the ambulatory people have less complication than bed-ridden people [20-21]. The
respondents were admitted to hospital and mostly bed-ridden or dependent on a caregiver,

these cumulative factors made an SCI survivor one of the vulnerable groups to the fatality of
COVID-19 in Bangladesh.
SCI people and their caregivers had a positive attitude to the control of COVID-19 and they
mostly followed (>80%) the health advisory during in-patient rehabilitation. The reason
behind the findings might be the successful patient protective policy of CRP and NITOR
during the COVID-19 pandemic, moreover, the similar positive attitude and practice noted in
a population-based study in Bangladesh [10].
The overall depression score 11.18±8, anxiety 7.72±5.1, and stress 9.32±6.7 from a total of
21 scores each seems different from the population assumption. The depression level was a
little higher as 15% of the respondents had existing issues with depression. The majority of
psychological issues were relevant to the male gender, young age, and complete patients. In
a web-based survey majority of the male university students had mild depressive symptoms
in Patient Health Questionnaire [24]. Another Bangladeshi study [20] also supports having a
lower depression level in the majority of SCI people in Bangladesh. Hence anxiety and stress
are interrelated and a linear relation was noted between depression and anxiety scores (r.45,
P<.01) and stress scores (r.58, P<.01). A population-based study reveals, nearly 86% of
Bangladeshi people have stress issues related to COVID-19 [25]. The anxiety and stress score
may be associated with the affordability, safety, and reliability issues of the rehabilitation
centers that were not examined in this survey.
There was a correlation between Knowledge and DASS with age (P<.05); and Knowledge
with gender (P<.05), and education (P<.01). Binary logistic regression found a higher
association of Knowledge and DASS with gender (P<.01); and young age (P<.01), illiterate
(P<.01), and rural people (P<.05) with knowledge. The findings are identical to the similar
population-based study [9].

The study limits the SCI survivors during in-patient rehabilitation. In this period they are
cared for by the health professionals and surrounded by the protection of an institution based
Rehabilitation. WHO reported non-communicable disease services and rehabilitation to be
mostly interrupted or affected services during the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide [12]. The
study reflects a positive role of institutions to take necessary steps on the protection, health
promotion, and rehabilitation of the SCI’s in the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.
There are concerns about the safety and protection of People with SCI living in the
community [26]. Future studies of KAP, psychological aspects, coping on COVID-19 and the
livelihood issues of the persons living in the community with Spinal Cord Injury are
recommended.
Conclusion
During in-patient rehabilitation in Bangladesh, the majority of SCI reported that they had
communicated with health professionals and practiced behaviors that would reduce
transmission and risk of COVID-19. The Institute based rehabilitation to SCI was appropriate
to protect these vulnerable SCI people from the COVID-19 catastrophe in Bangladesh.
