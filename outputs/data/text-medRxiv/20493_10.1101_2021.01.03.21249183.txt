radiomics nomogram (RN) after radiomics features extracted to predict disease
progression in patients with COVID-19. Results: The auto-segmentation framework
yielded a dice value of 0.79 in the training set. CM, AM, PM, FM, and RN obtained
AUCs of 0.712, 0.692, 0.763, 0.791, and 0.806, respectively in the training set. FM
and RN had better predictive efficacy than CM (P < 0.0001) in the training set. RN
showed that there was no significant difference in the validation set (mean absolute
error [MAE] = 0.04) and test set (MAE = 0.075) between predictive and actual results.
Decision curve analysis showed that if the threshold probability was more than 0.3 in
the validation set or between 0.4 and 0.8 in the test set, it could gain more net benefits
using RN than FM and CM. Conclusion: Radiomics features extracted from the
adrenal gland and periadrenal fat CT images may predict progression in patients with
COVID-19.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused serious public health
problems, which have been much worse than those caused by SARS in 2002–2003.
Until December 1, 2020, WHO reported 62,363,527 confirmed patients and 1,456,687
deaths globally (https://covid19.who.int/). Although a diagnosis and treatment protocol
suitable for the national situation has been enacted in each country, the consensus is
to separate moderate patients from severe patients who need special care. We must
predict early disease progression and accurately identify which patients are at risk of
developing a severe or critical disease. This is not only conducive to the early disease
control but will also effectively allocate medical resources globally.
Because it was unclear that the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique(1),
clinical symptoms, and laboratory tests were correlated with progression in patients
with COVID-19 (2), researchers started exploring predicting the disease prognosis of
COVID-19 combining artificial intelligence (AI) technology and CT images. Zhang et al.
(3) constructed a comprehensive system for accurate diagnosis, quantitative
measurements, and prognoses of COVID-19 pneumonia using chest CT images and
AI technology. They reported more than 0.95 of AUC, both in training and validation
sets. The results proved that the combination of chest CT and AI technology is a
potential tool to predict disease progression in patients with COVID-19 using chest CT
images and clinical indicators based on AI technology. Most studies have focused on
the relationship between features from chest CT images with disease progression and
ignored the endocrine system that played an important role in disease progression (4).

The endocrine system was largely unnoticed during the outbreak of SARS. It has
been proved that damage and changes in endocrine functions were important
predictors of morbidity and mortality during the previous SARS outbreak (5). The
endocrine system was largely unnoticed during the outbreak of SARS. It has been
proved that damage and changes in endocrine functions were important predictors of
morbidity and mortality during the previous SARS outbreak (6). However, studies
showing whether the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 can be affected by direct
damage or indirectly change of adrenal glands or periadrenal fat are lacking.
The adrenal gland is a key component of the body’s stress and immune system
that

is

composed

of

the

hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal

axis

and

the

sympathetic-adrenal-medullary system (7). The adrenal gland integrates the cortex,
which secretes glucocorticoids plus catecholamines, and the medulla, which secretes
catecholamines within one organ capsule. The pituitary gland mostly regulates
adrenal cortex function through adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and aldosterone,
an important part of the renin-angiotensin system. The adrenal medulla also secretes
catecholamines in response to the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Entire system
and the organs mentioned above are closely related to the immune-inflammatory
state of COVID-19 patients (8). Moreover, the adrenal gland can be changed not only
by receiving a direct attack from SARS-CoV-2 through angiotensin-converting
enzyme-2 (ACE2) (9) but also by adapting to physiological needs and pathological
conditions because it has an astonishing regenerative capacity to adjust to unique
micro-environments based on an extensive vascular network (10). Therefore, we

hypothesized that adrenal gland changes could occur due to its adaptive mechanism
and SARS-CoV-2 invasion. The periadrenal fat was bound to be affected as the
closest tissue around the adrenal gland. Fundamental changes can be detected by
extracting radiomics features from chest CT images using AI technology. Radiomics
is an emerging technique that can convert images difficult for human eyes to
distinguish into high-throughput quantitative features that may reflect potential
pathological and physiological states (11). Manual segmentation is the first and key
step of successfully constructing a radiomics model, but it is time-consuming and
error-prone because of repeated labor. Combining the auto-segmentation framework
based on AI technology with manual revision improves both efficiency and quality
(12). Cascaded V-Nets have been used to segment brain tumors with good results
(13), which could be further improved if incorporated with extra information, such as
coarse localization.
We therefore constructed an auto-segmentation framework and developed a
radiomics nomogram (RN) to predict progression in patients with COVID-19 by
integrating radiomics features from adrenal glands and periadrenal fat CT images with
clinical indicators and to determine that radiomics features extracted from the adrenal
gland and periadrenal fat CT images were related to progression in patients with
COVID-19.

A total of 1,245 patients (685 moderate and 560 severe patients) were enrolled in
the retrospective study from two hospitals (1,209 patients from one and 36 patients
from the other). The data of 1,209 patients were formed as our training and validation
sets, including 672 patients who suffered from moderate COVID-19 and 537 who
suffered from severe COVID-19. The patient characteristics in training and validation
sets are listed in Table 1. No significant differences were observed between the
training and validation set in sex (P = 0.238). lnterleukin 6 (IL-6) levels, white blood
cell count (WBC), lymphocyte count (L), neutrophil count (N), C-reactive protein
(CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), prothrombin time (PT), D dimer (DD), blood sugar (BS),
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST), albumin (ALB), direct bilirubin (D-Bil),
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine
kinase-MB (CK-MB) differed significantly between moderate and severe pneumonia
sets both in training and validation sets (P < 0.05).
The auto-segmentation framework construction, radiomics feature extraction,
feature selection, and predicting model building were established on the Research
Portal V1.1 (Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence, Co., Ltd.).
Adrenal gland and periadrenal fat auto-segmentation framework
For adrenal gland segmentation, we manually delineated bilateral adrenal glands
from the CT images of 315 patients, 265 of them were used for training. The
remaining data from 50 patients were used to evaluate the performance and the
segmentation model yielded average Dice values of 79.48% for the left adrenal gland
and 78.55% for the right adrenal gland. The entire adrenal gland achieved an average

Dice value of 79.02%. Representative auto-segmentation results are shown in Figure
1. We also visually verified the segmentation results, and they were considered
satisfactory based on radiologists’ judgment. The segmentation algorithm was then
used to segment all the remaining data automatically.
Radiomics feature and clinical indicator selection
In the training set, K-best and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
(LASSO) analyses were used to select the radiomics features most relevant to the
progression of COVID-19. The number of radiomics features was reduced to 23 for
building AM that included 8 ﬁrst-order features and 15 texture features (Gray Level
Co-occurrence Matrix [GLCM] = 3, Gray Level Size Zone Matrix [GLSZM] = 8, Gray
Level Run Length Matrix [GLRLM] = 2 and Gray Level Dependence Matrix [GLDM] =
2); 68 for PM that included 11 ﬁrst-order features, 2 sharp feature, and 55 texture
features (GLCM = 13, GLSZM = 25, GLRLM = 7, GLDM = 9 and Neighboring Gray
Tone Difference Matrix [NGTDM] = 1) and 82 for FM that included 12 ﬁrst-order
features and 70 texture features (GLCM=17, GLSZM=38, GLRLM = 3, GLDM=5 and
NGTDM = 7). These features were evaluated to construct three radiomics models.
A total of 30 clinical factors and serum biomarkers were analyzed in our study.
They were age, sex, IL-6, WBC, L, N, hemoglobin (HB), red blood cell count (RBC),
blood platelet count (PLT), CRP, PCT, PT, thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (FIB), DD,
BS, Alanine transaminase (ALT), AST, total protein (TP), ALB, total bilirubin (TBil),

biomarkers were selected using univariate logistic regression analysis, and 7
indicators, LDH, L, HB, DD, WBC, TT, and TP, were selected using multivariate
logistic regression analysis. The relationship between RadScore from FM used in the
construction of radiomics nomogram (RN) and 30 clinical factors plus serum
biomarkers were analyzed using Pearson correlation between training, validation, and
test sets (Figure 2). The difference in RadScores with clinical factors or serum
biomarkers was not significant. The radiomics information extracted from onset CT
images belonged to another dimension, and this information was not affected by
clinical factors and serum biomarkers. Then, 17 clinical factors and serum biomarkers
were selected using univariate logistic regression analysis, and 7 indicators, LDH, L,
HB, DD, WBC, TT, and TP, were selected using multivariate logistic regression
analysis.
Three radiomics models and clinical model building
We developed three radiomics models (adrenal gland model [AM], periadrenal fat
model [PM], a fusion of adrenal gland and periadrenal fat model [FM]) based on
radiomics features and a clinical model (CM) based on the seven selected
independent predictive clinical indicators. We used three evaluation indicators (area
under the curve [AUC], 95% CI, sensitivity [SEN] and specificity [SPE]) to assess AM,
PM, FM, and CM for predicting progression of patients with COVID-19 in training,
validation, and test sets. In general, AM achieved an AUC of 0.692, 0.716 and 0.659
in the training set, validation set and test set respectively; PM achieved an AUC of

0.763, 0.736 and 0.645; FM achieved an AUC of 0.791, 0.760 and 0.686; CM
obtained an AUC of 0.712 ,0.717 and 0.692(Figure 3, Table 2).
Box plots summarizing the RadScores and coefficients of seven clinical
indicators in training, validation, and test sets directly demonstrate the difference
between RadScore and coefficients of seven clinical indicators between the moderate
and severe patient sets (Figure 4).
RN construction and validation
Multivariate analysis revealed that RadScore and seven clinical indicators were
significant independent factors predicting disease progression in patients with
COVID-19. Using collinearity diagnosis, variance inflation factor (VIF) for the
radiomics score and seven clinical indicators were from 1.007 to 1.191, indicating no
severe collinearity in these factors. Next, we used the RadScore from FM combined
with seven clinical indicators to construct the RN to assess disease progression in
patients with COVID-19 (Figure 5). The RN showed satisfactory performance for
predicting and assessing progression in patients with COVID-19 with AUC of 0.806
(95% CI, 0.780 to 0.831) in the training set, 0.833 (95% CI, 0.780 to 0.878) in the
validation set, and 0.773 (95% CI, 0.603 to 0.895) in the test set (Figure 3, Table 2).
DeLong’s test was used to compare the AUCs of three radiomics models, CM
and RN, in the training set. The result showed that the RN and FM were significantly
better than CM (P < 0.0001). The difference between FM and RN was not statistically
significant (P = 0.233) in the validation and test sets.

The calibration curve showed an agreement between the predicted and actual
values. The Hosmer–Lemeshow test was not significant in the validation set (mean
absolute error [MAE] = 0.075) or test set (MAE = 0.04), which suggests that there was
no significant departure from actual values (Figure 6). Decision curve analysis (DCA)
was used to evaluate the performance of RN (Figure 7). If the threshold probability
was more than 0.3 in the validation set, the RN could get more net benefits than FM
and CM. If the threshold probability was between 0.4 and 0.8 in the test set, RN can
still get more net benefits than FM and CM.
Discussion
In this study, an adrenal gland auto-segmentation framework was constructed.
We rapidly finished the auto-segmentation of adrenal glands and periadrenal fat using
the framework. We found several radiomics features and seven clinical indicators
related to disease progression in patients with COVID-19. Next, we built and validated
a RN for predicting disease progression based on radiomics features extracted from
the onset of the adrenal gland and periadrenal fat CT images combined with clinical
indicators. Our study indicated that the auto-segmentation framework could robustly
localize the adrenal glands and accurately refine their boundary. The RN using
adrenal glands and periadrenal fat onset CT images performed well, reflecting that the
microscopic changes in adrenal glands and periadrenal fat in patients with COVID-19
can be detected using radiomics features.
Our results suggested that adrenal gland and periadrenal fat changes on the
onset of CT images in severe patients differed from those in moderate patients.

Results from autopsies in 10 patients from COVID-19 performed by Zinserling et al.
(14) showed that even macroscopic changes of adrenal glands were unremarkable.
However, they found inflammation—small proliferations of cells with enlarged light
nuclei and mononuclear infiltration, CD3+ and CD8+ in different layers of adrenal
glands and their surrounding tissue, such as periadrenal fat. These changes may be
related to direct damage of adrenal glands and indirect changes stimulated by
systemic inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 or immune state. In one respect, the
changes were caused by direct damage done by SARS-CoV-2. The SARS virus has
been identified in adrenal cells, suggesting a direct local replication-mediated
cytopathic effect of the virus in adrenal tissue (15). Moreover, virus may cause
hemorrhage, necrosis, or thrombosis at the adrenal level. (16) Adrenal lesions due to
influenza and other viruses have been described previously (17). Recent findings
have indicated the possibility of venous thrombo-embolism in patients with COVID-19
that may cause an acute adrenal insufficiency that may be an indicator of making the
disease worse (18). Additionally, the adrenal gland is one of the most highly
vascularized organs of the human body, with almost every adrenal cell in close
location to endothelial cells. Therefore, endotheliitis in COVID-19 may further increase
the vulnerability of adrenal tissue. However, this needs further study and validation.
We hypothesized that the same effect could occur in patients with COVID-19 due to
similar virus types. Our predicting results showed that AM’s AUC value was slightly
better than PM’s, but there was no statistical significance. That may indicate that the
inner changes in adrenal glands were not different from the changes from periadrenal

fat. Further research is needed to confirm changes in periadrenal fat were caused by
adrenal gland inflammatory cells' infiltration or direct damage of SARS-CoV-2 (19).
Previous research also reported that rather than direct damage by SARS-CoV-2
itself, adrenal gland changes were believed to be caused by immune overreaction or
cytokine storm-inducing endocrinological pathway impaired through a tight binding
mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 (20). Endocrinological pathway impairment
may be related to the following aspects. First, ACE2 is highly expressed in human
adrenals, which serves as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 that is bound to be
significantly affected. Although no studies have proved it, some work has proposed
that the imbalanced ACE/ACE2 axis may mediate tissue repair and wound healing
pathways in the lungs, such as fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 (21). Second, the main
substrate for ACE2 is angiotensin II. ACE2 acts as a negative regulator of the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) by converting the active angiotensin
and angiotensin II to the inactive angiotensin 1-7 (22). The adrenal gland is one of the
most critical end organs of RAAS that is fundamental in regulating blood pressure,
maintaining homeostasis, and is mediated in the organs’ inflammatory response.
Finally, the SARS virus contains several permutations of amino acid sequences with
homology to the antigenic relevant residues of ACTH (23) that will have potential and
significant pathophysiological effects due to molecular mimicry. ACTH is a key
hormone that regulates autoantibodies’ release by adrenal corticosteroids and could
abrogate the adrenal stress response when autoantibodies were binding ACTH.

immunocompetent cells in adrenal glands(14). In summary, these aspects suggested
that adrenal cells and surrounding tissue damage in patients with COVID-19 may be
caused by a viral infection and further secondary inflammatory plus autoimmune
processes located in the adrenal glands.
In conclusion, we proposed and constructed an adrenal gland auto-segmentation
framework based on chest CT images and AI technology. We automatically obtained
the ROI from the onset CT images through the auto-segmentation framework and
inflation algorithm, extracted the radiomics features, and then developed and
validated a RN for predicting the disease progression of COVID-19 combining onset
CT images with clinical indicators. Until now, we did not find any research using
adrenal gland CT parameters as indicators to evaluate the progression in patients
with COVID-19, especially in the radiomics field. Our work has some limitations. First,
we used the chest CT images as data resources. However, taking clinical practicality
and radiation to patients into consideration, there is no need to perform another CT
scan using professional adrenal glands CT parameters to observe adrenal lesions a
little better because CT examination of patients with COVID-19 is mainly to detect and
observe pulmonary lesions. Second, different from other studies, we selected the
entire organ as ROIs rather than the lesion itself. The periadrenal fat area may not be
precise and contain some other tissue that is indistinguishable to the human eye.
Although there are some deficiencies, our findings validated the potential for
radiomics features extraction from adrenal glands and periadrenal fat CT images to

be the indicators of COVID-19 prognosis. However, these need to be validated in
large-scale prospective studies.
Methods
Data resources and image grouping
CT images and clinical data were retrospectively and consecutively collected
from two hospitals: Huoshenshan Hospital (HSH) (n = 1,209) and Maternal and Child
Health Hospital Optical Valley Branch Hospital of Hubei province (MCH) (n = 36),
China. Diagnosis and clinical classification of patients with COVID-19 were confirmed
according to Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia
(Trial Version 8). Patients of age ≤ 14 years (n = 2) were excluded. All images were
non-enhanced chest CT images and reconstructed at a slice thickness of 1.00 mm.
Details of CT characteristics are listed in Supplementary Table. Patients with adrenal
lesions were excluded after being evaluated by two radiologists with more than 10
years of experience. We chose chest CT images scanned within four days to the first
diagnosis as the onset image. If the CT scan was done more than once, we chose the
one closer to the admission date. Figure 8 demonstrates the inclusion and exclusion
criteria. Figure 9 shows the workflow of our study.
CT images of 1,209 patients from Huoshenshan hospital were used to construct
the prediction models divided into the training set (967/1209, 80%) and the validation
set (242/1209, 20%) randomly. We used different imaging and clinical features and
their combinations to predict the progression of COVID-19. We constructed five
models: adrenal gland radiomics model (AM), periadrenal fat radiomics model (PM), a

fusion of the adrenal gland and periadrenal fat radiomics model (FM), clinical model
(CM) and radiomics nomogram (RN). A total of 36 Patients (13 moderate and 23
severe patients) from Maternal and Child Health Hospital Optical Valley
Branch Hospital were included as an independent test set.
Auto-segmentation framework and ROIs delineation
The objective of image segmentation is to extract ROIs, including bilateral
adrenal glands and the periadrenal fat. Here, we propose a cascaded V-net network
framework to segment the bilateral adrenal glands automatically, and ROI of
periadrenal fat was obtained using the inflation algorithm based on the adrenal gland.
An experienced radiologist (Y.F.) manually delineated the ROIs of bilateral adrenal
glands which were as the ground truth labels of adrenal, and he was asked to
delineate the adrenals according to the image delineating principles of BraTS 2018.
For the auto-segmentation framework, we first trained a coarse localization model as
Model 1, which can perform coarse segmentation to locate the adrenal gland area.
The second V-Net model was used for defining segmentation as Model 2, and further
divided into the left adrenal gland and the right adrenal gland.
The main structure of V-net includes Down-Block and Up-Block. The high-level
context information was extracted by convolutions and Down-Blocks first. Then, skip
connections were used to fuse high-level context information and fine-grained local
information. Through residual function and skip connection, the model can achieve
high accuracy. Normalization is performed before the image is input to the network.

the bilateral adrenal glands worked sequentially to obtain more accurate
segmentation results.
ROIs including bilateral adrenal glands and periadrenal fat from all CT images
without annotation were segmented using the auto-segmentation framework. Next,
the ROIs with serious nonconformity were manually verified by two radiologists with
more than 5 years of clinical experience and validated by another radiologist with 20
years of clinical experience.
Radiomics feature selection and models building
Radiomic features were extracted from ROIs on the CT images using a Python
package (PyRadiomics V3.0). B-spline interpolation resampling was used to
normalize the voxel size, and the anisotropic voxels were resampled to form isotropic
voxels of 1.0 mm × 1.0 mm × 1.0 mm in the feature extraction. A total of 2,264
features of each ROI were extracted, which can be divided into 3 common feature
groups, 450 first-order features, 14 shape features, and 1,800 texture features
(gray-level co-occurrence matrix [GLCM] = 525, gray-level run-length matrix [GLRLM]
= 350, gray-level size zone matrix [GLSZM] = 400, gray-level dependence matrix
[GLDM] = 400 and neighboring Gray Tone Difference Matrix [NGTDM] = 125) (24).
Next, the feature in the training set was preprocessed by standardization. The mean
and variance in the training set were applied to the validation and test sets.
To reduce dimensionality and select significant features, we performed a feature
dimension reduction process to select the most relevant features. First, a univariate
analysis named K-best was employed (25). It selected features according to K highest

scores computed through ANOVA F-value and P-value between label and features.
Features with a significant difference (P < 0.05) were selected. Next, the LASSO
feature-selection algorithm was used to extract the most informative radiomics
features to prevent the "curse of dimensionality". After feature extraction and selection,
logistic regression (LR) algorithms were trained to construct three radiomics models
(AM, PM, and FM) for predicting the disease progression of COVID-19 using a
five-fold cross-validation strategy. In the FM model, the RadScore of the patient was
calculated according to the LASSO algorithm.
RN construction and evaluation
We used univariate analysis to assess the relationship between clinical factors
plus serum biomarkers and disease outcome. Features with P < 0.05 were introduced
into multivariate LR analysis with radiomics features to select the best combination
using a five-fold cross-validation strategy. The best assignment of training and
validation sets was chosen for the next analysis. Next, we applied the multivariate LR
model to build CM using valuable clinical indicators and RN using the RadScore from
FM with clinical indicators to predict the disease progression of COVID-19.
We conducted collinearity diagnosis by calculating the VIF for variables in RN to
detect multicollinearity among the radiomics nomogram variables. In the end, RN was
verified in the validation and test sets. Calibration curves and Hosmer–Lemeshow test
were used to assess the relation between the predicted risks and actual results. DCA
was used to evaluate the performance of the RN.

Before model building, differences in clinical factors and serum biomarkers
between moderate and severe patient sets were assessed using Mann-Whitney U
test or Student’s t-test for continuous variables and the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test
for categorical variables. We analyzed all data using SPSS for Windows version 26.0
(IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). P < 0.05 was considered a statistically
significant difference.
Dice value was used to assess the effectiveness of auto-segmentation
framework. The AUC of receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) with 95%
confidence interval (95% CI), sensitivity, and specificity were used to evaluate the
performance of AM, PM, FM, CM and RN. Accuracy was calculated to assess the
prediction performance. Differences in AUC values among different models were
estimated using the DeLong test.

lactate dehydrogenase(LDH), lymphocyte count(L), hemoglobin(Hb), D dimer(DD),
white blood cells count(WBC), thrombin time(TT) and total protein(TP). Points are
assigned for each variable by drawing a line upward from the corresponding variable
to the Points line. The sum of points plotted on the total Points line corresponds with
the severity of patients with COVID-19.

Figure 6. Calibration curves of the radiomic nomogram for predicting the disease
progression of COVID-19 pneumonia in validation set (a) and test set (b). The y-axis
represents the actual probability of the COVID-19 pneumonia becoming severe, the
x-axis represents the predicted risk. Dashed line was reference line where an ideal
nomogram would lie. Dotted line was the performance of radiomics nomogram, while
the solid line corrects for any bias in radiomics nomogram. MAE is 0.04 in validation
set and 0.075 in test set.

Figure 7 Decision curve analysis(DCA) for the radiomic model, clinical model and
radiomics nomogram. The y-axis measures the net benefit. using the clinical
model,radiomic model and radiomics nomogram in the study to predict COVID-19
pneumonia progress adds more benefit than the treat all patients as severity patients
scheme or the treat none scheme. The net benefit of radiomics nomogram was better
than clinical model and radiomic model in both two sets and with several overlaps in
the training set.
