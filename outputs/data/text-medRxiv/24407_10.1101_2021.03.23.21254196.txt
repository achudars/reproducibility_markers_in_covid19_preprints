Abstract
The early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is
required to identify and isolate contagious patients to prevent further transmission of the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In this study, we present a multitarget real-time TaqMan reverse

transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 and some of its
circulating variants harboring mutations that give SARS-CoV-2 a selective advantage. Seven different
primer-probe sets that included probes containing locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleotides were designed
to amplify specific wild-type and mutant sequences in Orf1ab, Envelope (E), Spike (S), and
Nucleocapsid (N) genes.

Furthermore, a newly developed primer-probe set targeted human β2-

microglobulin (B2M) as a highly sensitive internal control for RT efficacy. All singleplex and fourplex
assays detected ≤ 14 copies/reaction of quantified synthetic RNA transcripts, with a linear amplification
range of 9 logarithmic orders. Primer-probe sets for detection of SARS-CoV-2 exhibited no falsepositive amplifications with other common respiratory pathogens, including human coronaviruses
NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU-1. Given the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their rapid spread
in some populations, fourplex rRT-PCR assay containing four primer-probe sets represents a reliable
approach to detect multiple viral target sequences containing typical mutations of SARS-CoV-2 variants
in a single reaction, allowing quicker detection of circulating relevant variants.

Introduction
The human SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the respiratory infection COVID-19 started in the Wuhan
province of China in late 2019, and then spread around the world (Wu et al. 2020; Zhang and Holmes
2020; Zhu et al. 2020). This novel coronavirus belongs to the subgroup betacoronavirus and the
subgenus Sarbecovirus (Chan et al. 2020; Lu et al. 2020a; Zhu et al. 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 genome
is constituted of a positive single-stranded RNA with a genome size of nearly ~29 800 to 29 900
nucleotides in length (Lu et al. 2020a). At the beginning of the outbreak, numerous patients exhibiting
an atypical viral pneumonia in Wuhan City were notified to World Health Organization (Wu et al.
2020). Shortly thereafter, infected foreign residents of China and foreign travelers arriving in their
countries of residence from international destinations, including visitors from Wuhan, contributed to the
spread of the virus through person-to-person contact (Chan et al. 2020; Holshue et al. 2020; Oude
Munnink et al. 2020). Subsequently, spreading of the virus occurred easily and rapidly from person-toperson transmission in local communities, resulting in a pandemic spread across the globe.
Although a number of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed, they are not available to all
people as their production and distribution require efficient logistic and time. Until vaccines become
universally available, governments from many countries around the world strongly suggest to their
citizens to maintain and sometimes enforce social distancing as they impose lockdown measures,
overnight curfew and implement an obligatory quarantine in the case of international travelers flying or
driving to different countries. Although rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients is critical
to trigger off their isolation, the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 remains difficult for the following
reasons. First, some SARS-CoV-2-infected patients exhibit no symptoms throughout the course of the
infection. Second, other SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with mild symptoms could be confounded with
patients who possess other kinds of atypical respiratory tract infections (Guarneri et al. 2021; Lai et al.
2020; Rivett et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020). In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, numerous
national public health agencies across the world have been proactive by setting up testing programs.

Most of these agencies have recommended and used a nucleic-acid-based method for early detection of
SARS-CoV-2. These nucleotide-based tests rely on the real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR)
that has been considered the "gold standard" approach for SARS-CoV-2 detection due to its
hypersensitivity for correctly identifying the viral RNA genome found in nasopharyngeal swabs and
sputum samples collected from infected patients (Corman et al. 2020; Esbin et al. 2020; Lu et al.
2020b).
For daily clinical specimen testing, clinical microbiology laboratories have used different primer-probe
sets for detection of SARS-CoV-2 (Corman et al. 2020; Lu et al. 2020b; Nalla et al. 2020). Among
them, the CDC N2 and Corman E (also called E Sarbeco) primer-probe sets have been identified to be
particularly sensitive (Nalla et al. 2020). A typical singleplex reaction contains one set of primer pairs
(forward and reverse) and a TaqMan probe that hybridizes to a specific targeted region of the viral
genome. Short sequences within the N and E gene regions are examples of viral templates proved to be
detectable with high reproducibility (Corman et al. 2020; Lu et al. 2020b). In the same master mixture,
a second set of primer pairs and TaqMan probe containing a distinct fluorophore are added to target a
human gene, such as the ribonuclease P gene (RNase P also denoted RP or RPP30) to monitor nucleic
acid extraction and amplification (Lu et al. 2020b; Lu et al. 2014).
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies have reported genomic sequence
variations of SARS-CoV-2 isolates (Leung et al. 2021; Martin et al. 2021; Rondinone et al. 2021;
Tegally et al. 2021a; Tegally et al. 2021b). Among these genetic variations, a single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) found at position 8,782 (in orf1ab; C instead of T) of SARS-CoV-2 genomic
sequence is a hallmark of the L strain (Tang et al. 2020), whereas the unaltered nucleotide is found at
the same position in the S strain. Several mutations have also been found in the coding sequence of the
Spike protein (Starr et al. 2020; Yi et al. 2020). One critical mutation in which an adenine has been
substituted by a guanine at position 23,403 in the genome of the Wuhan reference strain produces a
mutant form of Spike containing D614G substitution (aspartic acid to glycine substitution at amino acid

residue 614) (Korber et al. 2020). Another critical mutation in which an adenine has been substituted by
a thymine at position 23,063 generates a mutant form of Spike harboring N501Y substitution
(asparagine to tyrosine substitution at amino acid residue 501) that is found in the United Kingdom
(UK) B.1.1.7 strain as well as other reported variants (Leung et al. 2021). These mutations represent
few examples of the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to rapidly evolve since the beginning of the outbreak.
In this study, we report the development of novel primer-probe sets for the detection of SARS-CoV-2
variants. We use fluorogenic probes containing locked nucleic acid (LNA) for detection of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 using the TaqMan-LNA rRT-PCR
method. In addition to the new primer-probe sets, we have developed a fourplex rRT-PCR assay in
which four sets of primer pairs and fluorogenic probes are contained in a single reaction master
mixture.

Furthermore, we have created and used a novel set of primers/probe that detects the

ubiquitously expressed human β2-microglobulin (B2M) transcripts (instead of RNase P) as a positive
control for monitoring performance of the whole procedure. These include the presence of RNAs in the
collected sample, RNA extraction, reverse transcription efficacy, and real-time amplification. Thus,
this multitarget rRT-PCR assay will improve our ability to narrow the differential identification of
SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

Materials and methods

Primer and probe design. The Wuhan-Hu-1 genome reference sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (Lu et al.
2020a; Wu et al. 2020) as well as several other listed sequences of its genome (available in the
repository of the National Center for Biotechnology Information) were aligned using BLASTn software
to identify conserved nucleotide regions corresponding only to the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome and not

found in other viral sequences. Subsequently, different primer-probe sets targeting distinct regions of
the SARS-CoV-2 genome, especially within E, Orf1ab, and S genes, were designed using Primer
Express 3.0.1 software. The N LSPQ primer-probe set was designed as described previously (Longtin
et al. 2021). After validation of their exclusivity by comparing them to Virus Pathogen Resource
(ViPR), Reference Viral DataBase (RVDB) and human GRCh38 genomic DNA/mRNA databases, the
indicated TaqMan primer-probe sets (Table 1) were predicted to specifically amplify SARS-CoV-2,
exhibiting the absence of non-specific homologies with other respiratory viral pathogens or humanrelated gene sequences. The only exception was the E Sarbeco primer-probe set that was predicted to
hybridize with the E gene sequence of SARS-CoV-1 in addition to the E gene of SARS-CoV-2
(Corman et al. 2020). TaqMan probes were labeled at the 5’ end with either 6-carboxyfluorescein (6FAM), Texas Red 615 (TEX 615), hexachlorofluorescein (HEX), or Cytiva5 (Cy5) and at the 3’ end
with either Iowa Black FQ (IBFQ) or Black Hole Quencher 1 (BHQ1) (Integrated DNA Technologies,
Coralville, Iowa).
In the case of probes containing locked nucleic acid (LNA) residues, they were designed for detection
of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Orf1ab and S genes of SARS-CoV-2. Essentially,
we used forward and reverse primers that hybridized with each side of the target sequence and wildtype or mutant TaqMan LNA probes that hybridized at the mutation site, which was located between
the forward and reverse primers.

All primers and TaqMan probes were designed to avoid self-

complementarity and the formation of primer-dimer by-products and hairpins.

Furthermore, all

primer/probe sets were validated for their compatibility in multiplex rRT-PCR assays.

Synthesis of RNA transcripts used as standards.

gBlocks double-stranded DNA fragments

encompassing the amplified region of each targeted SARS-CoV-2 region were synthesized
accompanied with a T7 promoter sequence at their 5’ends (Fig. S1). A similar approach was used in
the case of the DNA fragment covering the amplified region of the human β-2-microglobulin (B2M)

gene.

Purified gBlocks products were used for in vitro T7-dependent transcription, as described

previously (Vijgen et al. 2005). The gBlocks DNA templates were eliminated by digestion with
RNase-free DNase I for 15 min at 37oC. The RNA transcripts were purified using a MEGAclear
transcription clean-up kit (Invitrogen) and were quantified spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. After
RNA levels quantification, measurements of transcripts were converted to the molecule number per µl
as described previously (Fronhoffs et al. 2002). To validate calculations of viral RNA copies per
reaction, we have established standard curves from 10-fold dilutions of RNA isolated from known
number of copies from a prototype viral RNA preparation that was commercially available (Exact
Diagnostics, Fort Worth, TX; Vircell, Granada, Spain).

Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR). Reactions were performed in a 10-µl
reaction mixture including 7 µl extracted RNA-containing samples or RNA transcripts used as
standards, 2.5 µl Reliance One-Step Multiplex rRT-PCR Supermix (4X concentrated) (BioRad), and
0.5 µl of forward and reverse primers (500 nM) and the indicated TaqMan or TaqMan-LNA probe (250
nM). One-step rRT-PCR amplification and detection were performed in a CFX96 Touch Real-Time
PCR System (BioRad) under the following conditions. Reverse transcription of 10 min at 50°C was
followed by PCR activation at 95°C for 10 min and 50 cycles of amplification (10 s at 95°C and 30 s at
60°C or for some indicated reactions at 63°C). In singleplex reaction mixtures, each reaction mixture
contained a single primer pair and TaqMan or TaqMan-LNA probe. In the case of fourplex reactions,
they contained all four sets of primers (500 nM per set) and probes (250 nM per probe) within a single
reaction master mixture. Fluorescence measurements were monitored after each amplification round
and the threshold cycle (Ct) value for each sample was calculated by assessing the point at which
fluorescence crossed the threshold line, exhibiting an increase in fluorescence above the calculated
background levels. The result was considered valid if two or more of the target-specific fluorescent

and no amplification, respectively.

BioFire FilmArray assays. The collection of respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens was obtained
from ZeptoMetrix (cat #NATRVP-IDI). The collection is called NATtrol Respiratory Verification
Panel (NATRVP) and contains 20 vials x 0.6 ml, each containing viral and bacterial targets listed in
Table 4. A master mixture that was constituted of an aliquot of each pathogen of NATRVP was
injected into the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1) Pouch in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions for analyze using the BioFire FilmArray 2.0 System (BioFire Diagnostics) as described
previously (Poritz et al. 2011). The loaded RP2.1 Pouch inserted into the FilmArray instrument
contained all necessary reagents for automated nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, and two
consecutive multiplex PCR amplification runs.

Furthermore, the FilmArray instrument has the

potential to undergo gene target melt curve analysis with each target in a valid run reported as detected
or not detected.

Results
Limits of detection (LoD) with SARS-CoV-2 RNA transcripts in singleplex reactions. gBlocks DNA
templates containing a 5’ T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence were used to produce viral
transcripts that corresponded to specific SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions (Fig. S1).

These RNA

molecules were used as standards for the generation of standard curves to determine the limit of
detection (LoD) of each primer-probe set. Oligonucleotide primer pairs and fluorogenic probes are
listed in Table 1. In the case of the E Sarbeco probe and primers, their nucleotide sequences were
identical to those described previously (Corman et al. 2020). The other primer pairs and fluorogenic

probes were designed from the SARS-CoV-2 complete genome (Lu et al. 2020a; Wu et al. 2020). In
the cases of SARS-CoV-2 L and S strains, specific TaqMan locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes were
designed to discriminate between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) found at position 8,782 (in
orf1ab; C instead of T) of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence as described previously (Tang et al. 2020).
Similarly, a specific TaqMan LNA probe was synthesized to detect a guanine instead of an adenine at
position 23,403 in the Wuhan reference strain (Lu et al. 2020a; Wu et al. 2020), allowing the
identification of the Spike variant harboring a glycine residue instead of an aspartic acid residue at
position 614 (Zhang et al. 2020). An additional mutation found in the UK strain B.1.1.7 was of interest
to probe with a specific TaqMan LNA oligonucleotide to discriminate between the SNP found at
position 23,063 (in Spike; thymine instead of adenine) where a tyrosine residue instead of an asparagine
residue at position 501 was found (Kemp et al. 2021). The sensitivity of each set of primer pair and
TaqMan probe was first evaluated in singleplex reactions. Tenfold serial dilutions of viral transcript
ranging from 1.3 to 1.4 x 109 copies per reaction mixture were tested in triplicate by real-time
quantitative RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays. Results were analyzed in terms of the Ct value that was
defined as the threshold cycle in which a target viral sequence was first detected. Samples with Ct
values ≤ 37 were considered to be positive in comparison with background cross-reactivity of the
primers and probes in non-template control (NTC) reactions. The highest dilution of transcript that
gave a significative Ct value was defined as the limit of detection (LoD) for a targeted RNA transcript.
Results showed that LoD values ranged from 1.3 to 13 or 14 RNA transcript copies / reaction (Table 2).
Linear regression curves were achieved over a 9-log dynamic range, from 1.3 to 1.3 x 109 copies or 1.4
to 1.4 x 109 copies per reaction for all nine probes, with calculated efficient values of 83.3% to 95.1%
(Fig. 1).

Limits of detection (LoD) in the case of fourplex rRT-PCR assays. Following analytical sensitivity of
the primers and probes in singleplex reactions, we sought to develop a fourplex rRT-PCR assay that

contained four sets of primers and probes within one reaction master mixture. Limits of detection in the
indicated fourplex assays were determined to verify whether their sensitivities were comparable to
those of singleplex reactions (Tables 2 and 3). Fourplex reactions that were prioritized included
TaqMan probes for detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genome of the SARS-CoV-2
strain that had been found in patient samples (Korber et al. 2020; Leung et al. 2021). With the goal of
identifying distinct SARS-CoV-2 virus variants, different combinations of primer-probe sets were
mixed within one reaction master mixture to specifically detect viral RNA genes that have undergone
genetic variations. As an example, a fourplex master mixture contained all four sets of primers and
probes to determine whether a SARS-CoV-2 isolate possessed viral RNA that encoded a Spike variant
harboring either an Asp614 or a Gly614 (also denoted D614G mutation) (Korber et al. 2020). Similarly,
additional fourplex master mixtures contained sets of primers and probes to determine whether a
SARS-CoV-2 isolate belongs to the L or S strain (Tang et al. 2020). Other examples of fourplex
reactions included primer-probe sets to identify the SNP found in Spike gene at position 23,063
(thymine instead of adenine) that results in an amino acid substitution N501Y that triggers a stronger
interaction of the Spike receptor-binding domain with the human cell-surface receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Leung et al. 2021; Martin et al. 2021). This multiplex approach could
facilitate tracking of SARS-CoV-2 variants that carry mutations. Serial 10-fold dilutions of SARSCoV-2 transcripts were produced as described above and were tested using different combinations of
sets of primer pairs and fluorogenic probes in one reaction mixture as described in Table 3. Linear
amplification was performed over a 9-log dynamic range, from 1.4 to 1.4 x 109 copies per tetraplex
reaction for all combined probes (Table 3). Results showed linear regression curves that exhibited
calculated efficient values of 85.1% to 110.4% (Fig. 2).
When we compared the sensitivity measured as the lowest Ct value of the TaqMan probes (Orf1ab L,
Orf1ab S, Spike 614G, Spike D614, Spike N501, Spike 501Y, E Sarbeco, N LSPQ, and B2M) in
singleplex reactions (Table2) and fourplex reactions (Table 3), results showed that sensitivities of these

probes between singleplex and fourplex reactions were comparable. In the cases of E Sarbeco, Orf1ab
L, and B2M, their limit of detection was generally 1.3 or 1.4 copies of transcript per reaction in both
singleplex and fourplex rRT-PCR assays. In the cases of Orf1ab S, Spike D614, Spike 614G, Spike
N501, Spike 501Y, and N LSPQ probes, a limit of detection of 13 or 14 copies per reaction was
observed with much more consistency in singleplex and fourplex assays. Taken together, all designed
primer-probe sets performed comparably in singleplex and fourplex assays that reproducibly detected
as few as 1.4 to 14 copies of target sequences per reaction.

Specificity of primers and probes in fourplex reactions. In the course of designing primer and probe
sequences used for detection of SARS-CoV-2, we performed BLAST analyses to verify the absence of
significant sequence homologies with other respiratory viruses and human genome sequences to avoid
the possibility of false positive results. To test the specificity of the primers and probes that we have
used in fourplex rRT-PCR reactions, we performed several assays using aliquots of the entire collection
of NATtrol Respiratory Verification Panel (NATRVP) from ZeptoMetrix, which contains purified
intact respiratory virus and bacteria particles that have been inactivated to make them non-infectious.
These microbial particles were supplied in liquid samples containing a specialized matrix that included
human cells to mimic the composition of a true clinical specimen. All SARS-CoV-2 primer and probe
sets used in fourplex reactions (see Table 3 for all combinations of four sets of primer and probes per
one reaction master mixture that have been tested) showed the absence of nonspecific amplification
against the ZeptoMetrix NATRVP preparation that includes 19 respiratory pathogens such as influenza
A and B, different types of parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus A, and other coronaviruses such as
NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU-1 (Table 4). In contrast, the B2M primer-probe set yielded positive
results for the same biological samples due to the presence of human cells that are associated with the
ZeptoMetrix NATtrol Respiratory pathogen samples. As positive assays for nucleic acid detection of
the 19 respiratory pathogens of the ZeptoMetrix NATRVP, we performed BioFire tests using the

BioFire FilmArray 2.0 system (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT). A master mixture containing
all viral and bacterial particles of ZeptoMetrix was injected into the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1
Pouch that contained all the necessary reagents for automated nuclei acid extraction, reverse
transcription, two stages PCR amplification, and detection of multiple respiratory pathogen targets in a
single assay.

Results showed that the FilmArray instrument in combination with BioFire Pouch

reagents including multiple independent sets of primers allowed multiplex-tandem PCR detection of the
microbial panel members listed in Table 4. Therefore, FilmArray runs validated the presence of viral
and bacterial nucleic acids in the ZeptoMetrix NATRVP preparation. Taken together, the results
showed that fourplex assays are specific for the SARS-CoV-2 virus target and that there is an absence
of false-positive signals with other respiratory viral or bacterial pathogens.

LNA probes allow differential identification of specific SARS-CoV-2 transcripts in fourplex reactions.
We tested different groups of differentially labeled four-color sets of probes that allow discrimination
of single-nucleotide mutations found in genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 to validate specific LNA
probe-target interaction for SNPs detection in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 5). Results showed
that the Orf1ab L probe containing a "C LNA" at the polymorphic site (position 8782 in SARS-CoV-2
sequence; Table 1) generated a positive fluorogenic signal that was specific for transcripts produced
from the new circulating L variant strain, whereas no fluorogenic signal was detected in the presence of
RNA obtained from the older S variant strain (Table 5; e.g. probes in fourplexes 1 and 2). In the case
of the Orf1ab S probe containing a "T LNA" at the polymorphic site (Table 1), this probe exhibited a
positive amplification signal in the presence of transcripts produced from the S variant strain and failed
to detect transcripts of the L variant strain (Table 5; e.g. probes in fourplexes 3 and 4).
Two oligonucleotide probes containing LNA residues were created for specific hybridization of target
sequences containing nucleotide substitutions that confer amino acid substitution in Spike at Asp614
(also denoted D614) and Gly614 (also called 614G) (Table1). The LNA probe for the detection of the

Wuhan reference D614 strain carried an "A LNA" at the SNP site (position 23,403 in the viral genome),
whereas the fluorogenic probe specific for the detection of the circulating Spike variant (614G)
contained a "G LNA" at this position (Table 1). In the case of the Spike D614 LNA probe, results
showed that it was specific for the detection of transcripts from the Spike D614 gene and did not
generate amplification signal in the presence of transcripts of the Spike 614G variant gene (Table 5; e.g.
probes in fourplexes 3 and 5). In contrast, results showed that the Spike 614G LNA probe exhibited
high specificity for detection of transcripts from the Spike 614G gene but failed to amplify transcripts
from the Spike D614 coding sequence (Table 5; e.g. probes in fourplex 5). Similarly, experiments by
fourplex rRT-PCR assays verified that the LNA probe for the detection of Spike 501Y transcripts
(nucleotide change A23,063T) (Tables 1 and 2) failed to detect the Spike N501 transcripts (Table 5, e.g.
probes in fourplex 6). Consistently, results showed that the LNA probe for detection of the Spike N501
transcripts (nucleotide A at position 23,063) (Tables 1 and 2) did not detect the Spike 501Y transcripts
(Table 5, e.g. probes in fourplex 7). In contrast, results showed that the Spike N501 and Spike 501Y
LNA probes exhibited high specificity for detection of transcripts from the Spike N501 and Spike 501Y
coding sequences, respectively (Table 5, e.g. probes in fourplex 8). Taken together, the results showed
that the oligonucleotide probes containing LNA residues can be used for differential identification of
SARS-CoV-2 viral templates in which mutations have occurred.

Discussion
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic characterized by successive waves of infection is a driving force for
optimization and constant development of SARS-CoV-2 testing assays (Esbin et al. 2020; Graham et al.
2021). Here, we report the development of a fourplex TaqMan-LNA rRT-PCR assay that included per

single reaction: four sets of primer pairs and four distinct TaqMan probes labelled with different
fluorophores. Results showed that a tetraplex reaction in a single master mixture reached a detection
limit of 14 viral transcript copies per reaction (Table 3). The amplification efficiencies of tetraplex
reactions (values of 85.1% to 110.4%) were equivalent to those in the singleplex reactions (values of
83.3% and 95.1%) in which a single viral primer-probe set was used within one reaction master mixture
(Table 2). The primer-probe set targeting a single nucleotide substitution in the Orf1ab L transcript was
more sensitive than primer-probe sets targeting single nucleotide substitutions in the Orf1ab S, Spike
614G, Spike D614, Spike N501, and Spike 501Y transcripts. This set could detect transcript at levels
as low as 1.4 copies per reaction in singleplex and fourplex rRT-PCR assays (Tables 2 and 3). In the
cases of primer-probe sets targeting single nucleotide substitutions in the Orf1ab S, Spike 614G, Spike
D614, Spike N501, and Spike 501Y transcripts, a detection limit of 14 transcript copies was reached
when they were used in fourplex assays on three independent experiments (Table 3). In the case of the
primer-probe set targeting the E gene that is denoted E Sarbeco (Corman et al. 2020), it was more
sensitive than the N LSPQ probe targeting the N gene (Tables 2 and 3). The E Sarbeco primer-probe
set could detect transcripts levels as low as 1.3 to 1.4 copies per reaction, whereas 14 transcript copies
per reaction was reached with the N LSPQ primer-probe set under our experimental conditions.
During the course of studies, we have found that the human β2-microglobulin (B2M) gene encoding an
ubiquitously expressed protein could be a positive control of choice for monitoring efficiency of RNA
extraction from swab samples and subsequent reverse transcription reaction reliability. To create the
B2M primer-probe set and ensure that its resulting product originates from RNA/complementary DNA
(cDNA) amplification and not from genomic DNA amplification, we designed the reverse primer on
exon2-exon3 junction of the B2M gene. Because this exon2-exon3 boundary sequence is only present
in spliced B2M mRNA and not in genomic DNA, this approach eliminated the possibility that the B2M
rRT-PCR signal resulted from an amplification of genomic DNA. Results showed that the B2M
primer-probe set was highly sensitive when tested in singleplex assays, exhibiting an efficiency of

95.1% (r2 = 0.996) and a detection limit of 1.3 transcript copies per reaction (Fig. 1 and Table 2). When
the B2M primer-probe set was used in fourplex assays, it remained highly sensitive with high levels of
rRT-PCR efficiency (95.5% to 106.5%) and a similar detection limit (1.4 transcript copies per reaction)
as compared to that observed in the case of singleplex assays (Figs 1 and 2) (Tables 2 and 3). The vast
majority of COVID-19 tests are currently targeting the human RNase P gene (denoted RPP30 or h-RP)
as a positive control to monitor RNA extraction and its quality to be reverse transcribed for its
subsequent PCR amplification (Lu et al. 2020b; Lu et al. 2014). However, problems with the use of
one CDC-recommended h-RP primer-probe set have been reported previously (Dekker et al. 2020).
One issue is that the reverse primer hybridizes in the same exon as the forward primer and the TaqMan
probe, therefore allowing amplification from genomic DNA instead of exclusively from spliced mRNA
(Dekker et al. 2020). In that case, a positive result with this specific primer and probe set fails to
validate the quality of the clinical sample specimen with respect to its RNA content.
The use of multiplex rRT-PCR assays allowed simultaneous targeting of different regions of the SARSCoV-2 genome in a single master mixture. Among the targeted regions, we often included the E
Sarbeco probe due to its reported successful use and high sensitivity (Corman et al. 2020; Nalla et al.
2020). In this manner, Ct values of the E Sarbeco probe in fourplex assays served as a point of
reference to assess the significance of Ct values of the other tested probes. Interestingly, we have
observed that utilization of multiplex SARS-CoV-2 primer/probe sets with distinct fluorophores shed
light on which regions of the virus genome are more sensitive for a rRT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2specific identification assay. Another advantage of using a multitarget rRT-PCR method is the fact that
it reduces the amount of non-enzymatic reagents, enzyme mixtures and plasticware required to analyze
all the samples on a daily basis.
RNA viruses exhibit high mutation rates that may result in self beneficial properties by increasing their
ability to infect host cells (Cuevas et al. 2015; Geller et al. 2016; Lauring et al. 2013). In the case of
SARS-CoV-2, several mutations have been identified since the start of the pandemic (Fontanet et al.

2021; Mascola et al. 2021; Tegally et al. 2021b). For instance, two linked SNPs in the genome of
SARS-CoV-2 have defined two major lineage of the virus that are designated S and L strains (Tang et
al. 2020). Another example consists of nucleotide mutations found in the viral sequence of the gene
encoding Spike that result in increased virus infectivity, especially nucleotide changes resulting in
amino acid changes at Asp614 (D614G) and Asn501 (N501Y) (Korber et al. 2020; Leung et al. 2021).
Here, we have used forward and reverse primers that hybridize to each side of hot spot mutational sites
found in Orf1ab (nucleotide change T8782C, generating lineage S versus L), and at different locations
in Spike such as nucleotide change A23403G (resulting in Spike variation D614G) and nucleotide
change A23063T (giving rise Spike variation N501Y).

These pairs of primers were used in

combination with wild-type and mutant-LNA probes that hybridize at the mutation site. The fourplex
real-time RT-PCR assay using LNA-based TaqMan probes exploits the 5’-3’ nuclease activity of Taq
DNA polymerase, allowing direct detection of each of the four fluorogenic qPCR products by the
uncoupling of a reporter dye from its quencher dye during qPCR. Furthermore, LNA modification of
TaqMan probes increases their base pairing stability and creates a highly favorable context of duplex
formation between them and their target sequences under more stringent conditions (Braasch and Corey
2001; McTigue et al. 2004; Petersen and Wengel 2003; Ugozzoli et al. 2004). Therefore, these
properties allow LNA-based probes to discriminate between distinct viral genomic sequences that differ
by a single nucleotide at a precise hot spot mutational site. This was performed, in three different
places on the genome of SARS-CoV-2 at the same time into one reaction. In this way, it is possible to
detect a range of representative genotypes that could reveal the presence of different variants of SARSCoV-2 geographically. This method for differential diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates could be
of help for effective surveillance. Furthermore, this multitarget rRT-PCR assay enables rapid follow-up
of the most clinically relevant variants across the population in real-time and effectively guide the
selection of viral strains that disserve further analysis by their whole-genome sequencing using nextgeneration sequencing methods.

Figure legends
Fig. 1. Standard curves to determine synthetic RNA copy number. A – I. Tenfold serial dilutions
ranging from 100 to 109 copies of Orf1ab L. Orf1ab S. Spike 614G. Spike D614. Spike N501. Spike
501Y. E Sarbeco. N LSPQ. and B2M synthetic RNA transcripts were analyzed by rRT-PCR assays.
Each representative graph was generated by plotting the Ct values (y-axis) and the log of initial number
of copies of synthetic transcripts (x-axis). Calculated linear correlation coefficients (R2) and percentage
of amplification efficiencies are indicated for each primer-probe set.

The graphs represent

quantification of the results of three independent experiments.

Fig. 2. Linear regression curves to assess synthetic RNA copy number in fourplex rRT-PCR assays. A –
G. For each representative graph. four primer-probe sets within one reaction mixture were used to
detect serial 10-fold dilutions of four synthetic RNA transcripts ranging from 100 to 109 copies per
reaction. The y and x axes of each graph are the Ct values and the log of the input of synthetic RNA
transcripts. respectively. For each fourplex reaction. R2 indicates calculated linear coefficients and Eff.
shows percentage of amplification efficiencies for each primer-probe set that is present with three other
sets of primers and probes within one reaction master mixture. Fluorogenic probe color codes are as
follows: blue. E Sarbeco; red. Orf1ab L; violet. N LSPQ; black. B2M; green. Spike 614G; orange.
Orf1ab S; brown. Spike D614; pink. Spike 501Y; and gold. Spike N501.

The graphs represent

quantification of the results of three independent experiments.
