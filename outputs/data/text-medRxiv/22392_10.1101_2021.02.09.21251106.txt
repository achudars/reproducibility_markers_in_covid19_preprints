Abstract

21

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the need to understand the unique risk

22

drivers that contribute to uneven morbidity and mortality in US communities. Addressing

23

the community-specific social determinants of health that correlate with spread of

24

SARS-CoV-2 provides an opportunity for targeted public health intervention to promote

25

greater resilience to viral respiratory infections in the future.

26

Our work combined publicly available COVID-19 statistics with county-level

27

social determinants of health information. Machine learning models were trained to

28

predict COVID-19 case growth and understand the unique social, physical and

29

environmental risk factors associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in

30

Tennessee and Georgia counties. Model accuracy was assessed comparing predicted

31

case counts to actual positive case counts in each county. The predictive models

32

achieved a mean r-squared (R2) of 0.998 in both states with accuracy above 90% for all

33

time points examined. Using these models, we tracked the social determinants of

34

health, with a specific focus on demographics, that were strongly associated with

35

COVID-19 case growth in Tennessee and Georgia counties. The demographic results

36

point to dynamic racial trends in both states over time and varying, localized patterns of

37

risk among counties within the same state.

38

Identifying the specific risk factors tied to COVID-19 case growth can assist

39

public health officials and policymakers target regional interventions to mitigate the

40

burden of future outbreaks and minimize long-term consequences including emergence

41

or exacerbation of chronic diseases that are a direct consequence of infection.

Introduction

43

In January 2021, Tennessee and Georgia reported over 1,550,000 cases and

44

22,100 deaths due to COVID-19. Hispanic individuals comprise 14% of the states’

45

population but represent 25% of confirmed cases, suggesting race and ethnicity are

46

associated with case growth.1

47

Combining publicly available COVID-19 data and proprietary social determinants

48

of health (SDOH), which measure certain physical, social, economic, and demographic

49

characteristics, we built and tuned machine learning models to predict COVID-19 case

50

growth in Tennessee and Georgia. We sought to accurately predict COVID-19 case

51

growth and investigate the changing significance of demographic features influencing

52

these predictions. Our approach produced highly accurate forecasts of COVID-19 case

53

growth in both states while uncovering evolving patterns of specific demographic factor

54

importance during a seven-month period. This approach also yielded state- and county-

55

level insights that can inform targeted mitigation efforts to slow respiratory virus spread.

56
57

Methods

58

Our approach combined publicly available COVID-19 case, hospitalization and

59

death metrics with county-specific SDOH data.2,3 Feature engineering and feature

60

selection were employed to define the data inputs that best represent changes in

61

COVID-19 case growth over time. We lagged (offset case growth over time), windowed

62

(summed or averaged case growth over time), and developed novel time window

63

features (i.e., “days since the 100th COVID-19 case”) using state health department

data. SDOH enrichment data, including demographic information, was appended to the

65

engineered features for each county.4 The target for predictive modeling was defined as

66

the future relative case growth normalized to the population in Tennessee and Georgia

67

counties from July 2020-January 2021. A grid search of generalized linear and tree-

68

based machine learning models was performed. Briefly, we trained and tested each

69

model using four to six weeks of historical COVID-19 case data and made predictions

70

using the most recent data available. From the ~50 regression models that we built for

71

each timepoint, models were chosen in a survival of the fittest approach comparing

72

statistical and real-world accuracy for predicting COVID-19 case growth.5 We identified

73

the top third of each state’s counties at highest risk for case growth and assessed our

74

prediction accuracy versus actual case growth over time. Finally, we analyzed each

75

feature’s impact at the state- and county-level to understand the demographic features

76

that drove COVID-19 case growth.

77

Results

79

Candidate models for Tennessee and Georgia achieved excellent metrics across

80

all timepoints including a mean R2 value of 0.998 (TN and GA), mean Tweedie deviance

81

of 0.003 (TN) and 0.002 (GA), as well as a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.357 (TN)

82

and 0.337 (GA) (Supplementary Figure 1A). Prediction accuracy was >90% in all

83

models across both states when compared to actual future case growth (Supplementary

84

Figure 1B).

Demographics produced variable trends at both the state- and county-level. The

86

two most populous counties in Tennessee, Shelby and Davidson, revealed an identical

87

pattern of importance for Native American demographics in determining future case

88

growth while exhibiting differences among the Asian demographic. Shelby County

89

displayed a gradual increase in importance in the Asian demographic while Davidson

90

County saw a more pronounced spike between October and November. Comparing

91

demographic importance at the Tennessee state-level versus individual counties yields

92

similar patterns (Non-Hispanic White) as well as contrasting trends (African American).

93

Further, Tennessee’s stable Hispanic demographic trend differed from the individual

94

counties’ more acute fluctuation of importance (Figure 1A).

95

Additionally, similarities and differences in demographic trends extend across

96

state borders. While the Hispanic demographic displayed the most meaningful

97

importance in Tennessee during July and August, Georgia saw a similar increase in

98

importance starting in September. Comparison of the two states’ top demographic

99

drivers showed a potential macro-pattern in which the most important driver for one

100

state often preceded its rise to top importance in the other (Figure 1A and Figure 1B).

Discussion

103

This analysis of community-specific relationships among SDOH and COVID-19

104

case growth in Tennessee and Georgia discovered localized, evolving patterns of risk,

105

highlighting the quantitative differences in state- and county-level case growth, and the

106

qualitative differences in important demographic factors that influence spread of

infection. These patterns can shift dramatically month-to-month, increasing or

108

decreasing over time and vary significantly by geography; even among similarly sized

109

counties within a state or between two neighboring states.

110

Identifying the specific risk drivers across the country during a pandemic can

111

assist decision-makers in protecting especially vulnerable populations through targeted

112

interventions. Closing the loop to address these risk factors can also enhance

113

community resilience to future viral respiratory infections.6

114

Applications of this approach extend beyond acute respiratory infection to chronic

115

disease outcomes including those that are a consequence of COVID-19. A growing

116

percentage (>10%) of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop long-COVID.7 These

117

patients experience prolonged, debilitating symptoms months after infection and

118

emergence or exacerbation of chronic illness. Thus, targeted approaches to mitigate

119

spread of disease can lessen future acute and chronic disease burden.

demographic feature importance across top predictive models are reported for the entire

state of Tennessee () and the two most populous counties in Tennessee, Shelby

184

County (p) and Davidson County (¢) as well as the state of Georgia (¿). A score of 5

on the importance rank indicates the most important demographic feature relative to the

other four demographic features. Groups include Native American (), Asian (),

African American (), Hispanic (), and Non-Hispanic White (). (B) Differences in the

rank of demographic feature importance in Tennessee and Georgia over time. The color

189

of the bubble (TN ; GA ) indicates the state that exhibited a higher importance rank

190

of the specific demographic feature for predicting COVID-19 case growth. Black dots

191

() designate months where the two states displayed the same importance rank for an

192

individual demographic feature. The size of the bubbles shows the difference in

193

importance of each demographic feature between the two states. Larger bubbles

connote greater difference in importance.
