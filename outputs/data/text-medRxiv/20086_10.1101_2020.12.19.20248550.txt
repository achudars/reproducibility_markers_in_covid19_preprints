Abstract

Objective: The study assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions toward the COVID19 pandemic during the total lockdown of spring 2020 in Greece.
Methods: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 13 to May 5, 2020.
Adult residents of Greece anonymously completed an online survey that was distributed
through email and social media. A total of 1396 fully complete questionnaires were collected.
Demographic questions, questions regarding the knowledge about the disease etiology,
diagnosis and prevention, and questions related to the respondents’ attitude and perception
toward the restriction measures and the confidence in different kinds of institutions providing
information were included in the survey items. The appropriate statistical analyses were
conducted according to the type of variable and the research question.
Results: The highest knowledge scores were found in females (74.8%, p = 0.015), individuals
over 60 years old (77.3%, p < 0.001) and individuals having completed post-secondary or
tertiary education (76.5%, p < 0.001). Five attitude patterns toward the pandemic were
identified: “trust in institutions”, “trust in the restriction measures”, “trust in media and the
internet”, “trust in traditional institutions”, and “measures deniers”. Age, education, and
knowledge score were the factors defining the attitudinal patterns revealed.
Conclusions: Education and public awareness of scientifically accurate information are the
means for eliminating individually and socially irresponsible and dangerous behaviors and
protecting public health in periods of health crises.
Keywords: COVID-19 pandemic, cross - sectional study, knowledge, attitude, perception

1. INTRODUCTION

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), having emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,
China, has been declared as a global public health emergency by the World Health
Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020 [1]. After the report of an enormous number of new
cases across 118 countries during the first week of March 2020, the disease was characterized
as a pandemic [2]. Human - to - human viral transmission through droplet and direct contact
have been identified as the main ways through which COVID-19 is rapidly spread. The lack of
antiviral treatment or vaccine during the first months of the novel health crisis highlighted the
significance of applying the appropriate prevention measures to control infections [3].
The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Greece was reported on February 26, 2020. On the same
day, the public information campaign about the disease by the Greek General Secretariat for
Civil Protection, titled “We do not fear, Knowledge is our shield,” was launched. The
subsequent increase in the number of confirmed cases and deaths led to a progressive
suspension of the operation of educational institutions (March 10), theaters and restaurants
(March 13) and religious ceremonies (March 16). Finally, the Greek Government implemented
a total lockdown on March 22, 2020. During the lockdown period, a daily press conference by
the scientific representative of the Greek Ministry of Health, and the under-secretary,
responsible for Civil Protection and Crisis Management was taking place, informing the public
about the disease progression both in Greece and globally. During the same period, a new
campaign titled “We stay at home, we stay safe” was launched [4]. The lifting of the lockdown
restrictions occurred gradually, being initiated on May 4, 2020. Greece’s management of the
first wave of the pandemic has been characterized as successful and the country has been
described as an example of handling the first wave of the health crisis, showing the significance
of acting quickly and informing people about the severity of the threat [5].
The pandemic has globally caused not only the loss of numerous human lives, but also job
losses, and deterioration of healthcare services and national economies [6]. In such periods of
crisis, maintaining social integrity and functions depends on the level of public knowledge, the
type of attitude and behavior toward the applied policies and measures and the confidence in
authorities and institutions. Surveying knowledge, attitudes and perceptions allows information
on what is known, believed, and done by the members of a population, to be collected. The
analysis of such data can reveal the factors underlying possible trends and defining the major
patterns of individual and social responses against the pandemic.

To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first assessing the knowledge, attitudes,
and perceptions of the adult Greek population toward the COVID-19 pandemic during the total
lockdown period (March 22 – May 03, 2020), to shed light on the parameters having shaped
the success of the “Greek example”. Additionally, we investigated whether the observed trends
are organized into patterns within the study population and to identify the major factors
defining these patterns.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design and sample size

A cross-sectional, web-based questionnaire study was conducted from April 13 to May 5, 2020.
The design and reporting of the study adhered to the STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional
studies in epidemiology [7]. Snowball sampling was selected because of the difficulty in
accessing subjects during the total lockdown, due to the imposed precautionary measures
against COVID-19. Greek adults living in Greece during the period the study was conducted,
were the target population. The sample size was calculated using the Raosoft sample size
calculator [8]. Given the size of the Greek population and for a response distribution of 50%
the minimum recommended sample size was 664 (99% confidence level, 5% margin of error).

2.2 Survey Development and Distribution

The survey instrument was in Greek and consisted of 49-items divided into three sections:
demographics, COVID-19 related knowledge and self-reported attitude and perception. The
instrument was developed using a W.H.O. course material on COVID-19 methods for
detection, prevention, response, and control [9]. Before the questionnaire was administered, an
internal consistency test was conducted in a pilot study among 45 randomly chosen participants
and Cronbach’s alpha values for the Knowledge and Attitude - Perception sections were
calculated. The time required to answer the survey was also assessed. The results of the pilot
study were excluded from the final analysis. For assessing clarity and readability, the
questionnaire was reviewed by 2 faculty members. Their suggestions for refinements were
adopted in the final version of the instrument.

perpetuity.

The survey was administered using Google Forms. Researchers’ email and social networks
contacts, as well as participants of online and open fora and groups were sent the link for the
questionnaire. The responses were automatically entered into a Google database. Before data
entry, participants were informed about the average length of time of the survey, the type of
data stored, the database and the duration of their storage, the identity of the researchers and
the purpose of the study.

2.3 Content of the Survey Instrument

The 49-item questionnaire consisted of closed-ended questions and it comprised three sections.
The first section assessed the following demographic characteristics of the participants: gender,
age, educational level, and prefecture of residence. The second section included 23 items and
assessed the respondents COVID-19 related knowledge regarding the disease etiology,
diagnosis, transmission, symptoms, prevention, and treatment. A scoring system was used for
the questions of this section. Correct answers were scored 1 point and incorrect or “I do not
know” answers were scored 0 points. The overall knowledge scores were calculated from the
total sum of correct responses and they were converted into percentiles. The third section of
the questionnaire assessed the attitudes and perceptions of the respondents toward the
pandemic. The items of this section were organized into two parts. The first part (12 items) was
asking for the degree of agreement to statements regarding the significance, efficiency and
impact of the restriction measures, and practices related to the prevention against COVID-19.
The second part (10 items) assessed the confidence of the participants in political, scientific,
social and religious institutions as information providers. All the responses of the third part
were recorded on a 1 to 5-point Likert scale (“very low”, “very high”). It is clarified that,
throughout the text, trust and confidence are used as synonymous terms.

2.4 Data Analysis

The data obtained were coded, validated, and analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2019 and Jamovi
version 1.6.8 (The Jamovi project (2020)). In the analysis only completed questionnaires were
used. Descriptive analysis was applied for calculating the frequencies and proportions for the
categorical variables and the central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard
deviation, interquartile range – IQR) for the numerical variables, as appropriate.

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test was applied for assessing the normality of the
distribution of continuous variables; the role of demographics in the knowledge, attitude and
perception of the respondents was investigated by comparing the differences in the responses
of demographic groups using parametric or non-parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA), as
appropriate. In all comparisons, a p value of less than .05 was considered statistically
significant. Moreover, pairwise comparisons were conducted to identify which pairs of levels
of the demographic variables significantly differ from each other.
Additionally, multiple linear regression was used to identify the main demographic variables
(predictors) that define the COVID-19 related knowledge scores. A full model (all interactions
included) was initially constructed, before the predictor with the largest p value (p>0.05) was
removed. The final model included only the predictors that were statistically significant (p <
0.05). Collinearity checks for the identification of interactions between the independent
variables were also conducted.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for all attitude/perception items of the
questionnaire. The technique was used to reduce the number of variables and to reveal patterns
of association between them. The Keiser – Meyer – Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling
adequacy and Bartlett’s sphericity test were applied prior to the PCA to show whether
associations between the original variables exist. The orthogonal varimax rotation was used to
increase the interpretability of the produced factors (components). Naming of the factors and
the respective patterns of attitude/perception regarding COVID-19 was based on the factor
loadings, considering the highest loadings. Only factor loadings equal or higher than 0.2 (or
lower than - 0.2) were considered in the interpretation of the pattern. Solutions of 2 – 5 factors
were tested to decide on the factors that should be retained. After the PCA, associations
between attitude/perception patterns and knowledge scores were assessed through linear
regression modeling, using the attitude and perception items per principal component as the
predictors.

2.5 Ethical Considerations

Participants' information remained anonymous and confidentiality of personal information was
protected throughout the study. The participation was voluntary, and the respondents were
asked to provide honest answers. An informed consent was included on the initial page of the
survey. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration

of Helsinki as revised in 2013 and had the Approval of the Bioethics Committee of the Medical
School of Aristotle University.

3. RESULTS

3.1 Instrument validity and completeness rate

The internal consistency of the survey was confirmed using the results of the pilot study.
Cronbach’s alpha values for the knowledge and attitude - perception sections were 0.76 and
0.71, respectively. The overall Cronbach’s alpha value was 0.72. A total of 1537 individuals
responded to the questionnaire and 1396 of them were completed without blanks, yielding a
completeness rate of 90.82%.

3.2 Study population characteristics and knowledge scores

Participant characteristics regarding gender, age and education are shown in Table 1. Of the
total number of participants, 64.6% were female, and most were in the 21 - 29 age class
(31.1%). Almost half of the participants (48.5%) had a post-secondary diploma or a university
degree. All prefectures were represented in the study population and the distribution of the
participants in them was similar to the distribution of the general population (data not shown).

[Table 1 Here]

The results of the Kolmogorov - Smirnov normality test indicated that the knowledge scores in
the study population were not normally distributed (p < 0.01). The median of the knowledge
scores was 74.8%. Statistically significant differences in the knowledge scores were identified
between genders, ages and education levels (Table 1). The highest median knowledge scores
were found in females (74.8%, p = 0.015), individuals over 60 years old (77.3%, p < 0.001)
and individuals having completed post-secondary or tertiary education (76.5%, p < 0.001). The
overall effect size indicated weak - moderate associations between the variables, the strongest
being the one between the educational level and knowledge score (ε2 = 0.078).

Linear regression modelling was used to further investigate the combined effect of the
demographic variables on the knowledge score. Collinearity checks (VIF and tolerance)
confirmed the lack of interaction between the independent variables (age, gender, education
level and prefecture). Linear regression confirmed the weak association between the
independent variables and the knowledge score (R2 = 0.125). Moreover, the prefecture was the
only non-significant factor (p > 0.05) (Table 2), thus it was excluded from the final model
(Table 3).

[Table 2 Here]

[Table 3 Here]

3.3 Attitudes and perceptions

Attitudes and perceptions of the study population toward COVID-19 pandemic were recorded
as the degree of agreement to a set of statements (Table 2) and the level of confidence in
different institutions (Table 3). The highest mean agreement scores were recorded for adopting
the precautionary measures against COVID-19 (4.18 ± 0.85) and the perception that the viral
spread will be eliminated due to the restriction measures (3.82 ± 1.59).

[Table 4 Here]

Medical and scientific institutions seemed to have gained the trust of the public (level of
confidence range: 3.66 - 3.92), while this was not true for political and religious institutions
and social networks (level of confidence range: 1.52 - 1.90).

[Table 5 Here]

Statistically significant differences in the attitudes and perceptions of the respondents were
identified mainly between ages and education levels (Tables 4, 5). The results of the pairwise
comparisons between levels of the demographic variables (data not shown) are argued in the
Discussion session.

3.4 Principal Component Analysis
The KMO score was 0.77 and Bartlett’s test of sphericity was statistically significant (p <
0.001) supporting the application of factor analysis. The PCA results indicated five components
with eigenvalues greater than 1.00, corresponding to a cumulative variance equal to 59.03%
(Table 6).

[Table 6 Here]

The variables considered in the PCA and their factor loadings are shown in Table 7.

[Table 7 Here]

The five principal components corresponded to five attitude and perception patterns regarding
COVID-19 identified in the study population. The first pattern was labeled “trust in
institutions” and was correlated with high confidence levels in scientific and political
institutions. The second pattern was labeled “trust in the restriction measures” and was
characterized by the respondent’s perception of the necessity and the efficiency of the imposed
measures, despite their impact on the economy. The third pattern was labeled “trust in media
and the internet” and was correlated with high confidence levels in the respective factors. The
fourth pattern was labeled “trust in traditional institutions” and was characterized by high
confidence levels in the church and political parties. Finally, the fifth pattern was labeled
“measures deniers” and was correlated with a high degree of agreement regarding the impact
of the measures on the economy and on human rights and a negative perception of the
vaccination, the ability of the Greek Public Healthcare System to cope with COVID-19
outbreak and the Government.

3.5 Association between attitude/perception patterns and knowledge scores

The measures of the linear model fit are shown in Table 8.

[Table 8 Here]

R2 and adjusted R2 values indicated weak associations between the attitude and perception
variables of each principal component and the knowledge score. Among them, the variables of
principal component 2, named “trust in the restriction measures” fitted a slightly better with
the linear model compared to the rest of the components (R2 = 0.101, adjusted R2 = 0.0816, p
< 0.001). On the contrary, the variables loaded on principal component 3, “trust in media and
the internet” had the lowest R2 and adjusted R2 values (0.0413 and 0.0240 respectively, p <
0.001).

4. DISCUSSION

This study assessed the level of knowledge of the Greek population about the COVID-19
etiology, prevention and treatment and their attitudes and perceptions regarding the restriction
precaution measures and the trust they showed to scientific, political, and other institutions
during the national lockdown period of the spring 2020 (March 23 - May 3). Assessing the
acquisition of appropriate knowledge and the societal trust in institutions and authorities could
provide an indication of the degree of preparedness of the community to effectively prevent
and control the pandemic during these first months of the global health crisis.
The participants of the study had a moderate high knowledge about the disease etiology,
diagnosis, transmission, symptoms, prevention, and treatment (overall median score: 74.8%).
The age and educational level had stronger independent effects on the population's knowledge.
Higher educational level is a consistent indicator of higher knowledge scores regarding the
pandemic in different studies. In contrast, the correlation between age and knowledge scores
appears differentiated in different populations. For example, survey studies in Egypt [10],
China [11], and Bangladesh [12] concluded that younger individuals tend to have higher
knowledge scores. In these cases, the observed differences were attributed to an existing
educational gap between people of different age, socioeconomic status, or place of residence
(rural vs urban).
The accurate knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic originates from the scientific
authorities and media that reproduce the relevant information. On the other side, the lack of
knowledge can be attributed to lack of interest, lack of access to information, or use of easily
accessible but unreliable sources of information. An example of the latter are the social media
which function as open access medical education providers, though in an uncontrolled online

environment, thus raising concerns about the actual benefits and risks of people seeking
information from these resources [13]. Misinformation has been characterized as the leading
cause of confusion that hampers the appropriate attitudes toward the pandemic [14]. A potential
underestimation of the severity of the disease and any misleading information about the
significance of prevention can lead to individually and socially irresponsible and dangerous
behaviors. Indeed, in a short time after the emergence of the disease in China, conspiracy
theories and rumors regarding the origin of the virus and the efficiency of the prevention
measures and treatments were globally spread through digital media accompanied by
fearmongering and racist trends [13]. This is the reason why the WHO created the COVID-19
myth busters webpage focusing in the correction of circulating misinformation, thus fighting
phenomena of mass panic [15].
Our results indicated that most of the participants adopted the imposed restriction and
prevention measures, describing them as efficient, despite their significant impact on the
economy. The participants demonstrated their confidence in scientific institutions and the
Greek government. In contrast, the media, online social networks, and the Church did not
attract the public’s trust. The level of education had the strongest effect on the attitudes and
perceptions of the respondents, while gender was not a factor of significant differentiation.
According to the results of pair-wise comparisons, more educated people showed a higher level
of trust in the scientific organizations and a more positive attitude toward the efficiency of the
restriction measures and the practice of vaccination. The latter seems to remain a controversial
issue in Greece, as shown by both the overall score in the relevant item and the significant score
differences between people of different gender, age and education.
An attitude against vaccination by a significant proportion of the Greek population had also
been reported during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic of 2009 [16]. Only 22.2% of the
general population were then likely to accept vaccination, mainly because of uncertainty about
the safety of the vaccine. The same barrier against vaccination has also been reported in other
studies of the Greek [17] or other [18], [19] populations. The negative attitude toward
vaccination against H1N1 in Greece was associated with female gender, ages 30-64 y.o. and
perception of low risk of being infected or at risk because of infection. Compared to the above,
in this study the anti-vaccination attitude observed during the first months of the pandemic was
not correlated with gender, but with younger age and lower education.
The results regarding the trust of the respondents in institutions and authorities showed
differences associated with the age and education level. More educated people expressed
stronger trust in scientific institutions. Younger people trusted more the W.H.O. compared to

older individuals. In contrast, older people showed more confidence in the media (television
and radio) and the Church. The latter is reasonable since older people are expected to be closer
to the religious culture of the country and familiar with the traditional means of communication,
which provide them access to the information given by the authorities. Obviously, these
findings reflect the public’s perceptions during a crisis period and they could be different if the
pandemic was missing. However, there have been studies reporting almost unchanged public
confidence in institutions before and during the COVID-19 crisis. The latter has been reported,
for instance, for Sweden [20]. In order to have comparable data between countries, social and
cultural parameters should be considered.
Historically, in periods of crisis, humans tend to shift toward religion. During the COVID-19
health crisis, Google searches for prayer increased by 50% according to data from 95 countries
around the world. This increase was not related to socioeconomic factors, neither was a
substitute for services in physical churches. Instead it was a means for coping with the current
adversity [21]. For a significant proportion of the Greek population, the Church is not only a
religious organization but a reflection of the Greek-Orthodox cultural and spiritual tradition.
Thus, the values and fundamental principles of many Greeks were challenged because of the
closure of churches and the abstention from rituals. All the above would look inconsistent to
the low trust score for the Church recorded in the study, if the following clarification was not
made: This score reflected the public confidence in the reliability of the Church authorities
within the context of the health crisis and was not related to its significance as a component of
the country’s culture. It seems that the respondents did not confuse their faith and tradition with
the scientific knowledge required for coping with the disease.
Finally, in our study, Principal Component Analysis was implied to investigate the attitudinal
barriers within the study population and potentially explain the trends revealed by the
independent attitude and perception scores and the respective between-groups comparisons. In
the same context, the five patterns identified were further assessed for their association with
the knowledge scores. The two major patterns, “trust in scientific institutions” and “trust in the
restriction measures” included variables correlated with a higher education level and exhibited
a stronger association with higher knowledge scores. On the contrary, the “trust in traditional
institutions” pattern showed an association with older ages and low knowledge scores, while
the “measures deniers” was correlated with younger ages and lower education levels. These
findings suggest that the continuum of attitudes and perceptions of the Greek population toward
the COVID-19 pandemic is separated into areas, between which the barriers are set by the level
of education, the age and the obtained knowledge about the disease. Attitudinal patterns

indicating a higher level of individual and social responsibility and a positive attitude toward
the scientific institutions and the implemented measures tended to be correlated with higher
levels of education and knowledge score. On the contrary, negative attitudes were associated
with lower education and younger ages.
In conclusion, the participants of this survey study showed a moderate high level of knowledge
about COVID-19. However, knowledge was lower among males younger and less educated
individuals. The participants had, in general, positive attitudes and perceptions toward the
restriction measures and the scientific institutions. Age, education, and knowledge score were
the factors defining the attitudinal patterns revealed. We conclude that education, as an
overarching, long-term target, and public awareness of scientifically accurate information
through multimedia reports, internet messages, campaigns etc. are the means for eliminating
irresponsible and dangerous behaviors and for protecting individual and public health, social
integrity, and prosperity in periods of health crises.

Limitations
Training material about COVID-19 pandemic was used for constructing the survey instrument,
that was further validated through a pilot study. However, this was a cross-sectional study,
conducted online once, at a particular time, during a global health crisis, and with the use of a
convenience sample. Thus, generalizations were limited, and causality between variables could
not be investigated.
