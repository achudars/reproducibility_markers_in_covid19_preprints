Abstract
We show phase-wise growth of COVID 19 pandemic and explain it by comparing real time data with Discrete Generalized Growth model and Discrete
Generalized Richard Model. The comparison of COVID 19 is made for China,
Italy, Japan and the USA. The mathematical techniques makes it possible to
calculate the rate of exponential growth of active cases, estimates the size of
the outbreak, and measures the deviation from the exponential growth indicating slowing down effect. The phase-wise pandemic evolution following the real
time data of active cases defines the impact-point when the preventive steps,
taken to eradicate the pandemic, becomes effective. The study is important to
devise the measures to handle emerging threat of similar COVID-19 outbreaks
in other countries, especially in the absence of a medicine.

Keywords: COVID-19, Generalised growth model, Generalised Richard model
Introduction On December 27, 2019, a hospital in Wuhan, capital of Hubei
province, reported the first mysterious, suspected pneumonia cases to the center
of disease control (CDC) in the capital. On January 8, 2020 a new coronavirus was
identified as the cause of pneumonia that spread all over China in next three weeks.
Since then, the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, spread across the globe in the next
month. In March the World Health Organization declared it to be a pandemic, that
in the absence of a vaccine became a challenge for mankind with a tendency to grow
exponentially if no measure is taken to prevent it. The incubation period of COVID19 can last for a period of two weeks or longer. During the period of latent infection,

the disease may still be infectious. The coronavirus can spread from person to person
through respiratory droplets and close contact.
Employing social distancing, following patient history case by case, and locking down the province of Hubei, and de-facto quarantining the other provinces by
restricting the movement of people China controlled the COVID-19 spread, as reported, in thirty five days successfully with eighty three thousand confirmed active
cases. On the other hand similar out break in USA, and Italy remained uncontrolled
after fifty days. [1].
In this contribution, based on mathematical modelling, phase-wise evolution of
COVID-19 pandemic is defined and explained. Moreover, following real time data
of active cases [2, 3, 4] a comparison of the COVID-19 outbreak is provided in
four different countries, namely USA, Japan, Italy and China. The study reveals
information that is helpful to control and eradicate the pandemic in other countries
especially in the absence of a vaccine.
In the presence of an almost consistent growth of young population and large
old population, the population pyramid in the USA, Italy and Japan have close
resemblance [5], as shown in figure 1. In USA, Italy and Japan the population
between 15 and 65 years is 64%, 61.4% and 63%, respectively, whereas the above
65 years of age population is, respectively, 22.41%, 27.1% and 14.79%. However the
pandemic has effected the three countries in diversely different pattern.

Figure 1: The population pyramid of United States of America (USA), Italy and
Japan is provided.

Following discrete generalized growth model (DG2 M) , the real-time data
of active cases (including infected, recovered and deceased cases) [2, 3, 4], Cn , is compared with the change in active cases, ∆Cn . It is found that logrhythm of change
in the active COVID-19 patients per day (log ∆Cn ) follows a linear behaviour with
the logrhythm of the active patients (log Cn ), such that log ∆Cn = p log Cn + log r.

The outbreak follows a certain rate of growth r of its spread, whereas another parameter p describes the exponent of the spread of the outbreak: it is sub-exponential
for 0 < p < 1, exponential for p = 1, and faster than exponential for p > 1. We
may understand the role of ’p’ as, a patient, on average, infects two healthy persons
and each of the two new patients effect two healthy persons each and so on — the
outbreak expands exponentially. Whereas r defines the rate with which these events
in exponential growth are taking place in a day. Interestingly a comparison of the

USA, Italy and Japan: In the panel for the USA we show real time data as dots,
following DG2 M model it makes two straight lines: red dashed-line for r = 0.496
and p = 0.925, whereas the blue dashed-line for r = 2.718, p = 0.775. In the panel
for Italy we show the real-time data of active cases in Italy making two lines, red
dashed-line for r = 0.33 and p = 0.95, whereas the blue line for r = 2.46, p = 0.72.
In the panel for Japan the red-dashed line plotted by means of DG2 M has r = 0.427,

real time data of the active patients with numerical results divides the data into two
sub-groups:
First phase COVID-19: First sub-group of the data describes the evolution of
COVID-19 pandemic in its early phase, expressed by red-dashed lines in figure 2.
For the USA we obtain the red-dashed line for r = 0.496 and p = 0.925, for Italy,
DG2 M model provides r = 0.33 and p = 0.95, whereas in case of Japan r = 0.427 and
p = 0.7. The values of r in case of USA and Japan are comparable, however smaller
in case of Italy, indicating a higher inflow of number of positively tested carriers
from the infected countries in USA and Japan as compared to Italy. In contrast
a smaller exponent, p, value for Japan corresponds to a slower spread of pandemic
as compared with the USA and Italy. That is due to a general social distancing
awareness in Japan.

Furthermore, DG2 M results for Japan show a gradual transition within early
phase data, as a straight line is developed by the initial data that has r = 1.16,
and p = 0.55. This gradually transforms to the red-dashed straight line with values
r = 0.427, and p = 0.7. The very early large rate, r = 1.16 indicates that a larger
number of active cases entered in Japan as foreign travellers from infected countries
which had lesser tendency to mingle in the society, keeping a small value for p = 0.55.
Second phase COVID-19: The next sub-group emerges as another linear trend
in the real time data following DG2 M, that appears as the pandemic is slowing down.
In case of the USA by employing DG2 M we get the linear behaviour with r = 2.718,
p = 0.775. For Italy, with the help of DG2 M, we get r = 2.46, p = 0.72, and in
case of Japan we have r = 0.169 and p = 0.92. The very small r value for Japan
and the exponent p comparable with USA and Italy indicates a swift approach on
day-to-day basis that restricted the number of patients comparatively to lower value
so that after eighty days without locking down in the country the number of active
cases are very low.
The Discrete Generalized Richard Model (DGRM) provides the pandemic
evolution after the second phase of COVID-19. The DGRM is valid when the DG2 M
breaks beyond the point of inflection. The DGRM reads as ∆Cn = rCnp (1 − (Cn /K)α ),
where α shows the deviation from the exponential growth and K is the scaling number related to the size of the outbreak or maximum number of active cases. The
values of r and p come from DG2 M that defined the second phase of COVID-19.
Together with the values of r and p obtained from DG2 M, the number of active cases
in USA show an overlap with DGRM results for α = 0.78, and K = 1250, 000. We
show the overlap of the actual number of active cases and the corresponding DGRM
results for Cn versus n in figure 3. In case of Italy we have α = 1.25 and K = 210000
whereas in case of Japan we simulate the real time data by means of α = 1.7 and
K = 17000, together with corresponding r and p values from DG2 M.
An excellent match between numerical plots and real time data confirms the
parametric evolution. From the figure 3 we note that the discrete generalized growth
model (DG2 M) show the gradual increase at first phase that matches very good with
the real time data of active patients in USA, Japan and Italy. The deviation from
unrestricted exponential growth comes from DGRM, that indicates a positive effect
of the steps taken by the countries, for example in case of Italy strict lock down,
restricting intercity train and bus travel, closure of education sector, and limiting
unnecessary travels as the positively tested cases reached around ten thousands.
However the preventive measures taken in Japan appear in a very controlled evolution

Figure 3: We plot the number (in thousands) of active cases Cn versus the number
of days, n, in the alphabetical order for USA (A), Italy (B) and Japan (C). The red
dashed-line is obtained by DG2 M, describes the first phase of the pandemic. The
blue dashed-line comes from DG2 M, whereas DGRM result is shown as blue line.
Together with the values of r and p obtained from DG2 M, (A) in case of the USA
we have α = 0.78, and K = 1250, 000, (B) in case of Italy we have α = 1.25 and
K = 210000. (c) In case of Japan, α = 1.7 and K = 17000.
in the DG2 M model, scaling down the increase on every day basis without locking
down the country, and keeping the business sector open, hence effecting the economic
activities to the least.
Developing situation: The phase-wise evolution is seen as making two straight
lines as shown in figure 2. The point of intersection of the two lines or the point of
impact may be associated with the efficacy of the measures to limit the pandemic in
each country as a function of time. In case of China, the intersection corresponds to
a general lock down in most of the provinces of China on January 26,2020, as soon
as the reported cases were around one thousands.
The real time data from Italy show the point of impact when the Cn value is
around 10000. Italy applied serious lock down and restrictions after almost an order
of magnitude increase in the number of active cases, that is around 10000. In the
night between 7 and 8 March, the Italian government approved a decree to lock
down Lombardy and 14 other provinces in Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont and
Marche, involving more than 16 million people.
In case of USA the point of impact appeared after another order of magnitude
increase, that is seen as a slower reaction to combat the pandemic, for instance, due
to lack of testing kits. By mid-March, the USA had tested 125 people per million
of their population, which was lower than several other countries. On March 27,
the U.S. President Trump signed the stimulus bill that approved $2 trillion to fight
against COVID-19. The number of active patients had already reached one hundred
thousands by that day.
In case of Japan, however, the point of impact appeared as the number of cases

were one hundred, as shown in figure 2, that implies a very quick response of the
country to the pandemic. For example, on 16 February, Abe convened the government’s first Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting at the Prime Minister’s Office to draft
national guidelines for COVID-19 testing and treatment.
Expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic The logrhythmic evolution, in figure 4,
expresses the size of the outbreak in USA, Italy, Japan, and China. The numerical
calculations are based on the DGRM and show very good agreement with the real
time reported data of the pandemic, it is expected that in USA in the presence
of strict measures the coronavirus pandemic may effect around 1.25million people
before the situation approaches to stability, and 0.21 million in Italy. Whereas for
Japan the estimated number of active patients is around sixteen thousands by the
time the pandemic is appreciably eradicated, that is possible by mid of May.

Figure 4: Along the vertical axis we show the logrhythm of number of active cases
of COVID-19, Cn , and the number of days n are along the horizontal axis. The blue
dashed-lines are obtained by DGRM whereas the blue dots represent the real-time
data. The values of the parameters are the same as given in figure 2, and figure 3.

Conclusions: In the analysis the phase-wise growth of COVID 19 pandemic is
defined and explained based on DG2 M and DGRM models. Furthermore the study
explains the exponential growth, provides the rate of growth, and estimates the size
of the outbreak, and measures the deviation from the exponential growth indicating
slowing down effect. The phase-wise pandemic evolution following the real time
data of active cases indicates the effectiveness of preventive steps taken in these

countries. It is shown that the preparedness of Japan in dealing with the COVID-19
pandemic is the highest, that makes it promising to initiate the 2020 Olympics in
the next year. The study is important to devise the measures to handle the emerging
threat of similar outbreaks in other countries. Moreover the research work leads us
to identify suitable model needed to handle eradication of COVID-19 pandemic in
already effected countries in the absence of tested medicines.
