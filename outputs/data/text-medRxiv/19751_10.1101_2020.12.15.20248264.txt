Abstract:
As increasing numbers of people recover from and are vaccinated against COVID-19, tests are

34

needed to measure levels of protective, neutralizing antibodies longitudinally to help determine

35

duration of immunity. We developed a lateral flow assay (LFA) that measures levels of

36

neutralizing antibodies in plasma, serum or whole blood. The LFA is based on the principle that

37

neutralizing antibodies inhibit binding of the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to

38

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The LFA compares favorably with authentic SARS-

39

CoV-2 and pseudotype neutralization assays with an accuracy of 98%. Sera obtained from

40

patients with seasonal coronaviruses did not prevent RBD from binding to ACE2.

41

demonstrate the usefulness of the LFA for measuring antibodies in convalescent plasma used

42

for therapy, we measured conversion of non-immune plasma into strongly neutralizing plasma.

43

This is the first report of a neutralizing antibody test that is rapid, highly portable and relatively

44

inexpensive that might be useful in assessing COVID-19 vaccine-induced immunity.

Introduction
The pandemic virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)

49

continues to be transmitted by person to person spread from its origin in Wuhan, China in

50

December 2019(1–3) . Vaccine trials are ongoing, and preliminary results from at least 2

51

vaccines show that the vaccines elicit protective immunity, but durability of vaccine responses is

52

not known(4).

53

Molecular tests such as PCR detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal

54

secretions and saliva and are diagnostic of infection(5). These molecular tests can determine

55

the rate of infection and potential re-infection. When negative they indicate that patients have

56

cleared the virus. In response to infection, all immunocompetent hosts generate antibodies

57

against the virus. Patients may have a positive serologic test result as well as a PCR-positive

58

test result if they are early in convalescence(6). For SARS-CoV-2, antibodies to spike protein

59

do not always predict recovery from COVID-19(7).

60

Although immunocompetent individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 generate antibodies

61

against the virus, it is essential to know which individuals generate high levels of neutralizing

62

antibodies (NAbs) so that they can resume normal activities without fear of being re-infected

63

and spreading the virus to others(8–10). The goal of COVID-19 vaccines is to induce NAbs and

64

T cell responses that prevent infection/re-infection. Additionally, development of NAbs indicates

65

which individuals might be optimal donors for convalescent plasma protocols. Although NAbs

66

are important for elimination of the virus and protection from subsequent infection, it has been

67

reported by several groups that up to one-third of convalescent plasma samples from individuals

68

who have recovered from COVID-19 do not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 or spike pseudotype virus

69

infection(11–13).

70

Viral neutralization assays measure levels of antibodies that block infection of host cells.

71

Two main types of viral neutralization assays are utilized for SARS-CoV-2. Authentic

72

microneutralization assays measure reduction of viral plaques or infectious foci in

73

microneutralization assays in susceptible host cells using SARS-CoV-2 under BSL3 conditions.

74

These assays are slow, laborious, require highly trained personnel and require a BSL3 facility.

75

Pseudotype virus neutralization assays have been developed in which SARS-CoV-2 spike

76

protein is expressed in a virus such as vesicular stomatitis virus or lentivirus(14, 15). These

77

assays are faster and less dangerous than authentic microneutralization assays, but still require

78

BSL2 conditions and 24-48 hours for results. Another challenge is that both authentic and

79

pseudovirus virus neutralization assays depend on host cells for infection which adds variability

80

to the assay.

81
82

It is known that SARS-CoV-2 uses receptor binding domain (RBD) on spike protein to
bind angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells; this appears to be the principal

83

neutralizing domain of SARS-CoV-2(16, 17). Using this knowledge, we developed a lateral flow

84

assay (LFA) that measures levels of (neutralizing) antibodies which block RBD from binding to

85

ACE2. Other groups have developed RBD-ACE2-based competition ELISAs(18)-(19) but none

86

have developed a rapid, highly portable semi-quantitative point-of-care (POC) test.

Methods

89

Human Subjects and Samples

90

Peripheral blood, serum and plasma were collected for this study under an Arizona State

91

University institutional review board (IRB) approved protocol #0601000548 and Mayo Clinic IRB

92

protocol #20-004544. Plasma was obtained by ficoll gradient separation of peripheral blood and

93

serum was obtained by centrifugation 30 minutes after drawing blood. Plasma and serum

94

samples obtained from excess clinical samples at Mayo Clinic were pre-existing, de-identified

95

and leftover from normal workflow. COVID-19 samples ranged from 3 to 84 days post PCR

96

positive result. Residual clinical samples were stored at 2-8oC for up to 7 days, and frozen at

97

-80oC thereafter.

98
99

Serum samples from patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory illnesses were also tested.
These specimens were collected from patients from 2/14/17 – 4/6/20 and were tested by the

100

FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 (RP2) (Biofire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT) respiratory virus

101

panel as part of routine clinical workflow. Specimens were stored at -80°C until analysis.

102
103

Pseudotype Virus Neutralization Assays

104

Titers were obtained from 60 COVID-19 patient sera using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)

105

spike protein pseudotype assay as previously reported with modifications (14). Patient sera had

106

been stored at -80°C prior to testing. Briefly, SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes were created by

107

replacing VSV G glycoprotein with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein resulting in a pseudotyped virus

108

with the C-terminal 19 amino acids removed from spike. The pseudotyped virus is called VSV-

109

SARS-CoV-2-S-∆19CT and was produced by BHK-21 cells. It induces syncytium formation

110

when incubated with vero cells. Two different Vero cells encoding split product luciferase

111

(DSP1 and DSP2) were cultured at a 1:1 ratio as a monolayer. Virus-induced fusion leads

112

to luciferase complementation and in the presence of luciferase substrate

113

EnduRenTM (Promega, Madison, WI) generates luminescence. The higher luminescence, the

114

more infection events by the virus. A human monoclonal antibody (Regeneron, Tarrytown,

115

NY) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was diluted to set a cut-off at 50% neutralizing

116

activity and utilized as a single point calibrator. Patient sera with serial dilutions (1:80-

117

1:2560) and the calibrator were pre-incubated with virus for 30 minutes (neutralization) prior to

118

addition to DSP1 and DSP2 Vero cells. The virus-cell mixture was incubated at 37°C in a 5%

119

C02 incubator for a total of 24 hours before luminescence reading; the substrate

120

EnduRenTM was added at 18 hours of incubation. The raw luminescence signal of each sera

121

dilution was compared against the raw luminescence signal of the calibrator. The

122

last consecutive dilution with luminescence signal below the calibrator was considered the end-

123

point titer. Samples were tested in duplicate. The same serum samples, 68 coded sera (10

124

serum samples at titers of 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, 1:640, 1:1280, 1:2560 and 8 serum samples from

125

individuals never infected with COVID-19) were frozen at -20oC and shipped by Dr. Mills from

126

Mayo Clinic Rochester to Mayo Clinic Arizona and the Lake Lab for LFA testing.

127
128

Authentic SARS-CoV-2 Microneutralization Assay

129

The authentic microneutralizing assay was performed using a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 that

130

expresses mNeonGreen (SARS-CoV-2ng) during replication in permissive cells, as previously

131

described (20). Inhibitory concentrations for which 50% of virus is neutralized by serum

132

antibodies (IC50 values) were obtained on a unique set of 38 COVID-19 sera. Sixty µl aliquots of

133

SARS-CoV-2ng were pre-incubated for 1 h in 5% CO2 at 37ºC with 60µl serial 2-fold serum

134

dilutions in cell culture media, and 100µl were inoculated into Vero-E6 monolayers in black

135

polystyrene 96-well plates with clear bottoms (Corning, Tewksbury, MA ). Each serum was

136

tested in duplicates. The final amount of the virus was 200 PFU/well, and the starting serum

137

dilution was 1:20 and the end dilution was 1280 unless an IC50 was not reached in which case

138

serum was diluted to 1:10240. Cells were maintained in Minimal Essential Medium

139

(ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented by 2% FBS (HyClone, Logan, UT) and

140

0.1% gentamycin in 5% CO2 at 37ºC. After 2 days of incubation, fluorescence intensity of

141

infected cells was measured at a 488 nm wavelength using a Synergy 2 Cell Imaging Reader

142

(Biotek, Winooski, VT). The signal readout was normalized to virus control aliquots with no

143

serum added and was presented as the percentage of neutralization. IC50 was calculated with

144

GraphPadPrism 6.0 software. Work with infectious SARS-CoV-2ng was performed in a BSL-3

145

biocontainment laboratory of the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Tx, Galveston

146

National Laboratory.

Serologic Antibody Assay
The Ortho Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test was performed on the Ortho Clinical

150

Diagnostics Vitros 3600 Immunodiagnostics System (Ortho, Raritan, NJ) following

151

manufacturer’s instructions at the Mayo Clinic. This assay is approved for use in clinical testing

152

under FDA Emergency Use Authorization to qualitatively detect antibody to the S1 subunit of

153

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Results are reported as reactive (S/CO ≥ 1.0) or Nonreactive (S/CO

154

<1.0). Quantitative results are not reported for clinical workflows but are measured and recorded

155

in this assay. Specimens were tested within 7 days of collection and were stored at 2-8oC per

156

manufacturer’s instructions. This assay was performed after the VSV assay was performed on

157

the set of 60 serum samples, then the samples were frozen at -80°C before running them on the

158

LFA. A separate set of 38 samples was run concurrently in the SARS-CoV-2 authentic

159

microneutralizing antibody assay, the LFA, and the Ortho Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay.

Lateral Flow Neutralizing Antibody Assay

161

The Lateral Flow Neutralizing Antibody assay was developed to detect antibodies that

162

compete with ACE2 for binding to RBD. The LFA cassette contains a test strip composed of a

163

sample pad and blood filter, conjugate pad, nitrocellulose membrane striped with test and

164

control lines, and an absorbent pad to wick excess moisture (Axim Biotechnologies Inc, San

165

Diego, CA). The blood filter allows serum to pass through but prevents red blood cells and

166

leukocytes from interfering with the assay. Test strips are secured in a cassette that contains a

167

single sample port (Empowered Diagnostics, Pompano Beach, FL). For procedural control

168

purposes, the LFA also contains a control mouse antibody conjugated to red gold nanospheres

169

and corresponding anti-mouse control line.

170

LFAs were performed at ambient temperature and humidity on a dry, flat surface and left

171

to run undisturbed for 10 minutes prior to reading results. First, 10µl of plasma, serum or whole

172

blood were transferred to the cassette sample port and immediately followed by two drops

173

(~50µl) of chase buffer. After 10 minutes, each test was placed in an iDetekt RDS-2500 LFA

174

reader (Austin, TX) and the densities of both test and control lines were recorded electronically.

175

This assay was performed on the VSV subset (n = 60) as well as the authentic SARS-CoV-2

176

microneutralizing antibody assay subset (n = 38).

177

Serum samples from COVID-19 patients as well as sera from patients with PCR-

178

confirmed seasonal respiratory viruses including PCR-confirmed seasonal coronaviruses were

179

tested in the LFA as controls. Twenty-seven sera from patients with seasonal respiratory

180

viruses were tested in the LFA in a manner identical to COVID-19 sera.

181
182

The test leverages the interaction between RBD-conjugated green-gold nanoshells
(Nanocomposix, San Diego, CA) that bind ACE2 at the test line when RBD-binding/neutralizing

183

antibodies (RBD-NAbs) are absent or low. As indicated by the competitive nature of this assay,

184

test line density is inversely proportional to RBD-NAbs present within the sample. Thus, an

185

absent or faint test line indicates high levels of RBD-NAbs, whereas a dark or strong test line

186

suggests lack of RBD-NAbs within a given plasma sample (Figure 1A).

187

As a semi-quantitative test, the results of the LFA can be interpreted using a scorecard

188

or a densitometer. Figure 1B demonstrates the scorecard. Red control line across from the “C”

189

on the cassette is composed of a mouse monoclonal antibody coupled to red-gold beads

190

binding to an anti-mouse IgG. A red line indicates that the test ran properly and the green test

191

line across from the “T” can be used to semi-quantitatively measure the ability of plasma, serum

192

or whole blood to block RBD on green-gold nanoshells from binding to ACE2.

193

To demonstrate the ability of the test to measure NAbs in whole blood, 10µg of a

194

neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) based on the sequence of B-38(20)(Axim

195

Biotechnologies, Inc, San Diego, CA) was mixed with 10µl of normal donor whole blood

196

collected in a heparinized blood collection tube. Two-fold dilutions were made in whole blood to

197

a final concentration of 0.625µg/ml neutralizing mAb. Then, 10µl of each dilution were

198

transferred to LFA cassettes, chased with 50µl running buffer, and read with an LFA reader after

199

10 minutes.

200
201

Conversion of Non-immune Normal Human Plasma (NIHP) into Neutralizing Plasma

202

To convert NIHP into strongly neutralizing plasma (SNP), plasma from a convalescent

203

donor who demonstrated the ability to block RBD from binding to ACE2 (M21) was mixed with

204

NIHP collected prior to December 2019. For example, for a 1% mixture, 1µl of SNP was mixed

205

with 99µl NIHP; for a 5% mixture 5µl of SNP was admixed with 95µl NIHP, etc. We performed

206

the test with 10µl of 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% SNP admixed into NIHP.

Data Analysis

209

Pearson’s correlation (r) was conducted to assess the strength and significance of

210

associations between the LFA, the Ortho Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, VSV titers and IC50

211

values. Regression analysis using IC50 values was performed to evaluate consistency(18) while

212

Bland-Altman plots were constructed to assess agreement and bias(21, 22). Correlation analysis

213

was conducted using IBM SPSS (Armonk, NY). Regression analysis was performed using

214

Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA); Bland-Altman plots were visualized using IBM SPSS. For two-

215

group analysis, IC50 values corresponding to >240 were categorized as titer of ≥1:320

216

(neutralizing), whereas IC50 values ≤240 were categorized as ≤1:160 (non-neutralizing). Receiver

217

operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess classification accuracy,

218

sensitivity, and specificity of the LFA and Ortho Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test methods in

219

assessing neutralizing capacity; optimal cutoffs for each method were established to maximize

220

area under curve (AUC)(23, 24). ROC analysis was conducted using R language in the RStudio

221

environment (version 3.6.2; RStudio PBC, Boston, MA). All analyses were conducted using raw

222

values; data were not normalized, transformed, or scaled.

223
224
225

Results
The lateral flow assay reported here is a rapid 10-minute POC test. As shown in the

226

schematic in Figure 1A, this test utilizes serum, plasma or whole blood to semi-quantitatively

227

measure levels of NAbs. An example of strong, moderate and non-neutralizing sera is shown in

228

Figure 1B. As diagrammed in Figure 1A, levels of NAbs in serum or plasma are reflected by

229

the intensity of the test line which can be read on a hand-held densitometer or compared

230

visually to a scorecard (Figure 1B). Strong neutralization results in a weak line because

231

neutralizing antibodies are binding RBD on green gold beads and preventing RBD-beads from

232

binding to the ACE2 cellular receptor at the test line.

flow strip demonstrating actual line density. Addition of non-COVID19-immune serum or plasma
(top) does not block binding of RBD-beads (green particles) to ACE2 resulting in the RBDbead–ACE2 complex creating a visible line. Addition of patient serum with moderate titer NAbs
to the sample pad creates a weak line (middle). Addition of patient serum with high titer NAbs
(> 1:640) blocks binding of RBD-beads to ACE2 such that no line is observed at the test

We tested 60 serum samples with known neutralization titers obtained in a VSV-based

266

spike pseudotype assay in our LFA. De-identified serum samples were sent from Mayo Clinic

267

Rochester to our laboratories at Mayo Clinic Arizona and run in a blinded manner. The LFA

result compared favorably with serum titers, especially at higher titers and correctly

To further support the application of our lateral flow test to measure levels of antibodies
that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, we tested a different set of 38 serum samples that were assigned
IC50 values in an authentic SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assay(25). Again, the experiment
was performed in a blinded manner such that personnel running either the LFA or the
microneutralization assay did not know the results of the comparator test. When line densities
from the LFA were plotted against IC50 values determined in the SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization

indicates that neutralizing antibodies inhibited RBD from binding to ACE2 (Figure 2B).

Next, we determined if our test detected any neutralization activity in serum samples

290

collected from patients with other PCR -confirmed respiratory viruses including seasonal

A positive control serum from a convalescent COVID-19 patient is shown on the far right of the

We evaluated how the Ortho Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test and our LFA compared to

307

IC50 values determined in an authentic SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assay using 38 COVID-

308

19 sera. FDA guidance indicates that an Ortho Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test of ≥12 meets a

309

threshold for convalescent plasma use in patients with COVID-19. To determine the agreement

310

between our lateral flow assay and the Ortho Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, density units from

311

our LFA and values from the Ortho test were regressed onto IC50 values (Figure 4).

318

LFA values accounted for roughly 52% of observed variance in IC50 values, while Ortho

319

Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test accounted for approximately 27% of IC50 variance. Since the

320

format of the LFA reports decreasing density values as neutralization increases, LFA was

321

significantly inversely correlated with IC50 values (r = -0.720, p < 0.001), while Ortho Vitros Anti-

322

SARS-CoV-2 IgG test values showed a significant positive correlation to IC50 values (r = 0.522, p

323

= 0.001). Additionally, LFA and Ortho Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test values showed a

324

significant relationship with each other (r = -0.572, p < 0.001).

325

To evaluate bias between the assays, mean differences and 95% confidence intervals

326

(CIs) were calculated and plotted alongside limits of agreement (Figure 5). Both LFA and Ortho

327

Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test values showed high agreement with titer, although Ortho Vitros

developed LFA and Ortho assay to classify non-neutralizing (Neg—1:160), and neutralizing

groups (≥1:320) (Figure 6). As can be seen in Figure 6B and 6D, the LFA misclassified one non-

339

neutralizing sample (Neg—1:160) as neutralizing (≥1:320). In contrast, Ortho Vitros Anti-SARS-

340

CoV-2 IgG test misclassified that same non-neutralizing sample as neutralizing, in addition to

341

incorrectly classifying five additional neutralizing samples as non-neutralizing. Importantly, our

342

LFA method exhibited a greater dynamic range of differential values as compared to Ortho’s test.

(Figure 5), translating to superior classification accuracy of the LFA method in detecting

neutralizing samples (titer ≥ 1:320) compared to Ortho Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test (Figures

363

SARS-CoV-2 IgG test showed only 70% sensitivity. In contrast, the novel LFA method showed

364

perfect sensitivity (100%) in this analysis of 38 samples.

365

Optimal cutoffs were computed to maximize AUC. For the LFA, density unit values below

366

263,000 classify samples as neutralizing and correspond to titers ≥1:320. Density unit values

367

above this LFA cutoff classify samples in the non-neutralizing group. For the Ortho Vitros Anti-

368

SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, values between 0 and 23.3 were representative of non-neutralizing

369

capacity, whereas values above 23.3 were reflective of the neutralizing group. If we used the

370

FDA cutoff of 12 instead of the 23.3 value calculated using our results, AUC would be reduced to

371

0.69 (sensitivity = 0.55, specificity = 0.83).

372

Polyclonal antisera was used in this study, not an individual Mab, so the limit of detection

(LoD) does not exactly apply). However, we can calculate the LoD by line density based on the

374

method of Armbruster and Pry(26) as the highest line density from samples still containing

375

neutralizing antibodies and distinguishable from blank except that the operand sign was changed

fighting COVID-19 is to transfer NAbs from the donor to the recipient, as has been done for

several other diseases(27–29). The rapid test described here, could quickly and efficiently

classify COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) units so that the sickest patients might receive

the most potently neutralizing plasma. Although levels of neutralizing antibody to achieve in

385

patients receiving CCP remains undefined, our point-of-care test might be useful at the bedside

386

to monitor a patient receiving highly neutralizing CCP as he/she begins to demonstrate NAbs in

circulation, as shown in Figure 7A. It could help in deciding whether to administer another unit

of highly neutralizing CCP to a patient fighting COVID19. The same scenario might also be

389

applied to hyperimmune gammaglobulin or neutralizing monoclonal antibody infusion.

390

To demonstrate the utility of our LFA to measure NAbs in whole blood, we used a lateral

391

flow strip with a blood filter and performed an experiment in which a neutralizing monoclonal

392

antibody based on the B-38(20) sequence was titrated into whole blood as shown in Figure 7B.

393

Density units were not obtained in these experiments but both Figures 7A and 7B demonstrate

394

the semi-quantitative nature of this test to visually distinguish different levels of NAbs in plasma

395

and whole blood.

Discussion
Serologic tests that detect responses to infection are an important population
surveillance tool during pandemics because they provide data on pathogen exposure, especially

441

when a subset of the population is asymptomatic and would not have been diagnosed by

442

molecular methods(30, 31). While over 90% of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 generate

443

antibody responses(30) we are only beginning to learn about the prevalence and duration of

444

NAbs induced by a natural infection. This lack of knowledge is mainly due to the fact that virus-

445

based neutralization assays require i) BSL2 or BSL3 facilities, ii) highly skilled personnel, iii)

446

permissive cells and quantified virus, and iv) take longer than 24 hours to obtain results. Since

447

every viral vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines, administered to humans is designed to elicit

448

antibodies that neutralize virus by blocking host cell infection, development of NAbs is a

449

hallmark of protection from disease. Therefore, there is a need for rapid, accurate tests that

450

measure levels of NAbs. Furthermore, in a post-vaccine world, longitudinal measurement of

451

protective, neutralizing antibodies is crucial. Measurement of anti-viral T cells also indicates that

452

infected individuals could destroy infected host cells if virus escapes neutralization.

453

We developed a rapid, 10-minute lateral flow test that measures levels of NAbs in serum

454

and plasma. As shown in Figure 2, the lateral flow test correlates well with serologic titers

455

determined using a VSV-based pseudotype assay, and IC50 values in an authentic SARS-CoV-2

456

microneutralization assay, especially when serum sample titers are ≥640 and IC50 values

457

are >250. Samples with less potent NAbs in both viral assays correlated with decreased ability

458

to block RBD from binding to ACE2 in the LFAs.

459

The LFA and Ortho Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test methods showed a strong,

460

significant correlation with each other (r = -0.572, p < 0.001), displaying an appreciable degree of

461

linear relation (r = -0.720, p < 0.001)(32). Importantly, LFA accounts for 52% of observed IC50

462

variance (R2 = 0.5187) while, in comparison, Ortho Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test accounts for

463

27% (R2 = 0.2725). Although absolute quantitation of a construct demands an excellent coefficient

464

of determination (R2 ≥ 0.99)(33), variables with R2 ≥ 0.5 are highly predictive in univariate

465

regression models while measures with R2 < 0.5 are recommended for use in multivariate models

466

in combination with complementary measures to increase predictive accuracy(34, 35).

467

Additionally, Bland-Altman analysis (Figure 5) showed the Ortho Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG

468

test to be prone to underestimation of IC50 values. In contrast, the LFA method did not exhibit any

469

over- or underestimation bias. Furthermore, across mean values for both methods, LFA showed

470

discrete differential values while Ortho Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test struggled to differentiate

471

samples with high neutralizing capacity (IC50 values).

472
473

Since the Ortho Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test uses S1, which includes RBD, it is

474

likely that antibodies reactive with other parts of S1–even some that may neutralize via N-

475

terminal domain–are responsible for increased reactivity to S1 when they are not neutralizing in

476

our RBD-ACE2 competition assay. Advantages of our POC test is that it can be inexpensively

477

and rapidly deployed in studies to determine levels of NAbs that protect against re-infection and

478

limit transmission of the virus. Moreover, rapid inexpensive tests can be used longitudinally to

479

evaluate duration of protective immunity in both naturally infected and many more vaccinated

480

individuals than could ever be evaluated using BSL2 or BSL3-based neutralization assays.

481
482

In the setting of much debated CCP, a rapid test could be used to measure levels of

483

NAbs in a CCP product prior to infusion, or potential donors who recovered from COVID-19.

484

During infusion of CCP, a rapid test could be used to help decide if a patient fighting COVID-19

485

requires another unit of highly neutralizing plasma. If a particular donor’s CCP has very high

486

levels of CCP, patients might need only one unit. On the other hand, if donor CCP contains

487

moderate levels of NAbs, the patient may require multiple units to achieve therapeutic levels of

488

NAbs. However, since we do not know what an adequate therapeutic dose of NAbs is, this

489

rapid test could be a valuable tool in trials to determine under what conditions CCP,

490

hyperimmune globulin, and neutralizing mAbs are effective therapeutic agents for COVID19

491

patients.

493

Limitations of the LFA are that it uses only the RBD portion of SARS-CoV-2 spike

494

protein. Although the vast majority of reports indicate that the principle neutralizing domain is

495

RBD portion of spike protein, mAbs have been reported that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by binding

496

to the N-terminal domain of spike protein(36, 37). Also, since the spike protein assumes several

497

conformations during viral binding and entry(38), neutralizing epitopes exist on the quaternary

498

structure of spike(37). Although RBDs on the nanoparticles may associate, it is unlikely they

499

assume a native quaternary conformation.

500

Other limitations are the binary nature of the data analysis (neutralizing and non-

501

neutralizing) of a continuous assay. Clearly, line densities demonstrate moderate levels of

502

neutralization. Since blood draws and subsequent assays are a “snapshot in time” of

503

neutralizing antibody activity, levels were undoubtedly increasing in some patients and

504

decreasing in others. LFAs are generally inexpensive and highly portable compared to other

505

laboratory-based tests, so neutralizing antibody levels could be measured using the LFA to

506

longitudinally assess protective neutralizing antibody immunity. Another limitation is that the

507

LFA does not differentiate high affinity anti-RBD NAbs from an abundance of lower affinity anti-

508

RBD NAbs. In related experiments, we have observed patient sera that bind strongly to RBD,

509

but do not demonstrate neutralizing activity (data not shown).

510

This test may prove very useful in monitoring COVID-19 vaccine recipients. Although

511

vaccines have now been approved for distribution and administration, durability of protective

512

immunity elicited by any COVID-19 vaccine is unknown. It is the goal of all COVID-19 vaccines

513

to induce protective NAbs. However, since clinical trials of vaccines have enrolled 30,000 to

514

60,000 participants, it is not logistically possible to draw a tube of blood from each vaccine

515

recipient longitudinally to determine duration of protective NAbs. Application of our test in

516

vaccine recipients using a drop of blood obtained from a finger-stick as shown in Figure 7B

517

might lead to more comprehensive longitudinal monitoring of increases and decreases in

518

protective humoral immunity.
