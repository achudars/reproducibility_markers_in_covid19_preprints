Abstract:
Importance: Intensity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and planning required to balance concerns of saving lives
and avoiding economic collapse, could depend significantly on whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission is sensitive to seasonal
changes.
Objective: Hypothesis is that increasing temperature results in reduced SARS CoV-2 transmission and may help slow the
increase of cases over time.
Setting: Fifty representative Northern Hemisphere countries meeting specific criteria had sufficient COVID-19 case and
meteorological data for analysis.
Methods: Regression was used to find relationship between the log of number of COVID-19 cases and temperature over time
in 50 representative countries. To summarize the day-day variability, and reduce dimensionality, we selected a robust
measure, Coefficient of Time (CT), for each location. The resulting regression coefficients were then used in a multivariable
regression against meteorological, country-level and demographic covariates.
Results: Median minimum daily temperature showed the strongest correlation with the reciprocal of CT (which can be
considered as a rate associated with doubling time) for confirmed cases (adjusted R2=0.610, p= 1.45E-06). A similar
correlation was found using median daily dewpoint, which was highly colinear with temperature, and therefore was not used
in the analysis. The correlation between minimum median temperature and the rate of increase of the log of confirmed cases
was 47% and 45% greater than for cases of death and recovered cases of COVID-19, respectively. This suggests the primary
influence of temperature on SARS-CoV2 transmission more than COVID-19 morbidity. Based on the correlation between
temperature and the rate of increase in COVID-19, it can be estimated that, between the range of 30 to 100 degrees
Fahrenheit, a one degree increase leads to a 1% decrease--and a one degree decrease leads to a 3.7% increase--in the rate of
increase of the log of daily confirmed cases.
Conclusion: The results suggest that boreal summer months are associated with slower rates of COVID-19 transmission,
with the reverse true in winter months. Knowledge of COVID-19 seasonality could prove useful in local planning for phased
reductions social interventions and help to prepare for the timing of possible pandemic resurgence during cooler months.

Introduction:
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), is a newly-identified enveloped, nonsegmented, positive sense RNA virus. It is responsible
for Corona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019), which was
designated a pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020.(1) SARS-CoV-2
belongs to a large family of human corona viruses such
as MER-CoV and SARS-CoV, which are respiratory
pathogens associated with a range of respiratory and
non-respiratory outcomes. Like other respiratory
infectious agents, coronaviruses display marked
seasonality.(2) Infection rates peak in mid-winter, and
then diminish during summer months. Because SARSCoV-2 is a recently identified human pathogen,
seasonal variations in its transmission have not become
evident, though there is much speculation that seasonal
change with the boreal summer might decrease
infection rates of SARS-CoV-2 and help flatten the
epidemic curve of COVID-19.(3)
A better understanding of the seasonal dependence
of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and the identification of
environmental conditions that regulate its spread,
would be helpful in assessing the differential impact of
the virus in different geographic locations under various
meteorological conditions. Such knowledge would also
help in predicting the timing and degree of potential
slowing of transmission in the summer and resurgence
of the virus during winter.(4)
To understand the seasonal dependence of SARSCoV-2 infections in the absence of year-long incidence
data, we examined the effect of atmospheric
temperature, the main variable with season,(4) on SARS
CoV-2 transmissibility using currently available data on
the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection during winter and
spring from fifty representative countries in the
Northern Hemisphere.
Methods:
Longitudinal changes in cumulative COVID-19
confirmed deaths, and recovered cases from 1/22/20
through 4/6/20 were estimated from databases made
available by the Johns Hopkins University.(5) The start
date of January 22, 2020 was chosen because that is
when the database started tracking cases. For analysis,
we selected only the Northern Hemisphere countries
because even though the number of cases have been
increasing on both sides of the equator, only the

Northern Hemisphere experienced an increase in
temperature during the study period. The opposite was
true in the Southern Hemisphere. As a result, the
impact of temperature on the rate of new cases cannot
be investigated simultaneously on pooled data from
both hemispheres. We excluded from analysis China(6)
and Russia,(7) and countries where Russian was the
primary language, because of inconsistent reporting
over time. Italy was excluded because number of
confirmed cases seemed significantly larger than
adjacent countries for reasons that are not entirely
clear.(8)
To preserve methodological conformity, countries
with separate reports of cases from multiple regions
were excluded. Other countries were excluded due to
limited access to, or the lack of, reliable data on COVID19 cases or meteorological data. To enable analysis of
cases during consecutive days in a log linear fashion, we
established the following criteria to ensure sufficient
numbers of confirmed cases: to be included during time
period 1/22/20-4/6/20, countries needed to have a
median number of confirmed cases >1 or the mean
number of confirmed cases >75.
The resulting 50 representative countries (Table 1)
had a mean latitude of 38 +/-15 SD, range 1-65 degrees,
that covers 70% of the total range (1-90 degrees), with
each country being separated from the next by a mean
of 1.3 +/-1.7 SD degrees. Countries mean longitude as
34+/-44 SD, range -103 to 138 that covered 70% of the
total range (-180 to 180 degrees), with each country
separated from the next by a mean of 6 +/- 13 SD
degrees. The resulting wide range of temperatures
across the 50 countries was as follows: 1) mean average
temperature 51.1 +/-16.9 °F, median 44.9 °F, range
22.6 - 85.7 °F, and 2) mean minimal temperature
42.0+/-16.3 °F, median 36.6 °F, range 15.5 - 77 °F.
Daily weather data for each of the 50 countries were
obtained from National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration
(NOAA).(9)
Daily
minimum
temperatures (Tmin) were used because they appear to
be more important for virus transmissibility.(10) We
used Dew Point (DP) as a measure of humidity because
it is an absolute assessment of water vapor content that
does not depend upon temperature, and it is the only
country meteorological data related to humidity that is
tracked by NOAA. The daily Tmin and DP for each
country were obtained from NOAA station locations
closest to the specific latitude and longitude that the

JHU database listed for each country. The medians of
the daily Tmin and daily DP were derived for each
country for whatever portion of 1/22/20 through
4/6/20 that they had cases of confirmed COVID-19
reported (Table 1). Median was chosen because it is less
affected by outliers and skewed data than the mean.

of transmission occurred. To account for this, the total
number of days for each country during which they had
cases of COVID-19 between 1/22/20 and 4/6/20 (Days
of Cases) was used as the final covariate. In multiple
regression analysis of the CT-1 versus the median of
Tmin_Med (Table 2), we found that the rate of increase
of the log of confirmed cases per unit time was
significantly associated with the covariates Tmin_Med,
LAPC, MA and Days of Cases (adjusted R2=0.610, p=1.45
x 10-6; see Figure 2 & Table 2).

Results:
Analysis of the impact of changing temperature on the
rate of rise of COVID-19 cases.
To investigate the relationship between Tmin and
COVID-19 transmissibility, we devised a two-step
process. In the first step, starting with the date of the
first case for each country we examined linear
regressions of the log of the daily cumulative COVID-19
cases versus time in sequential days (Figure 1). From
this analysis we calculated the resulting regression
coefficients (which we termed coefficients of time (CT)
with units of log cases/day) for each country (Table 1).
To determine consecutive days, we converted calendar
dates to sequential serial numbers that can be used in
calculations—e.g. 1/22/2020 was converted to 43852
because it is 43,851 days after 1/1/1900. The CT of log
confirmed cases vs sequential days for all fifty countries
yielded a mean overall R2 of 0.919 +/- 0.049 SD, range
0.792-0.986, and p-value mean 4.20 x10-14 ± 2.61 x10-13,
range 1.00 x10-15 – 1.84 x 10-12 (Table 1).

Analysis of Dewpoint and its influence on COVID-19 rate
of raise of cases
In addition to regression of CT-1 with Tmin_Med, we
also examined the median daily DP (DP_Med) for each
country. We found that the rate of increase of the log
of confirmed cases per unit time using covariates
DP_Med, LAPC, MA and Days of Cases showed an
equally robust and statistically significant association
(adjusted R2=0.599, p=2.68 x10-6). Because of the
collinear relationship between Tmin_Med and
DP_Med, which in linear regression resulted in an
adjusted R2 of 0.76, (p=1.4 x 10-16), we assumed that
since Tmin_Med had the higher correlation with cases
it was likely the primary factor underlying the
association between weather and COVID-19
transmission.
Magnitude of Effect of Temperature Change on Rate of
Transmission of COVID-19:

In the second step, we investigated whether CT was
associated with the median daily Tmin (Tmin_Med) in
each country for the same time period that cases had
been reported. Because of the approximate
proportionality of fitted CT with the standardized
residuals when performing linear regression with
Tmin_Med, we used a reciprocal transformation of the
dependent variable. (11) Therefore, for the second
regression for all countries we used the reciprocal of CT
(CT-1) (Figure 2).

From the second regression described above, the
following equation was derived:
CT = 0.116 - 0.000911 x Tmin_Median
It was therefore possible to obtain CT for temperatures
ranging from 30 °F to 100 °F – i.e. 0.0885 (log
cases/day) to 0.0248 (log cases/day), respectively. This
analysis indicated that an increase in temperature from
30 to 100 °F was associated with a 72% decrease in the
rate of number of confirmed cases per day (CT 0.0885
to 0.0248), whereas a decrease in temperature from
100° to 30° F represents a 257% increase in the rate of
change of confirmed cases (CT 0.0248 to 0.0885). This
corresponds to 1.03% decrease in confirmed cases for
each degree increase in temperature, and a 3.68%
increase for each degree decrease in temperature (e.g.
-72/(100-30) and 368/(100-30)).

To account for susceptibility variation resulting from
age differences that could affect both the comorbidity
levels as well as social gathering behavior, we used each
country’s population median age (MA) as another
covariate.(12) Because the 50 countries varied widely in
size, and the density of the population could impact
transmission, we used land area per capita (LAPC) as an
additional covariate.(13) Finally, each country differed
with respect to when it reported its identified cases, so
that between the target dates of 1/22/20-4/6/20 there
were different durations of time over which the course

The correlation between the reciprocal of the rise in
the log of the number of deaths and recovered cases of
COVID-19 (CT-1) vs Tmin_Med was 47% and 45% less
than that of confirmed cases, respectively (see Table 2).
Moreover the covariates of LAPC and MA for death and
recovered cases had regression p values of 0.5 or
greater, suggesting that the impact of these covariates
on confirmed cases was specific.

be expected to influence confirmed cases, and not
deaths or the number of recovered subjects (e.g. once
infected, temperature exerts a small or absent effect on
the course of COVID-19 morbidity).
Although our study is a systematic and quantitative
analysis of the dependence of SARS-CoV-2 infection
rates on temperature and dewpoint that has
demonstrated a robust and significant correlation
(Table 2), it has several notable limitations. This is an
ecological study and is therefore potentially subject to
ecological fallacy.(16) Moreover, our data are not direct
measures of individual-to-individual transmission, so
cause and effect relationships cannot be established.
However, the biological plausibility for our hypothesis is
supported by previous work showing that the
transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 and similar viruses
depend upon atmospheric temperature.(2, 17)

Statistical analysis was performed with StatPlus
software for the Mac.(15) Graphing software employed
was GraphPad Prism 8 for the Mac.(14)
Discussion:
The major finding of this study is that the rates of
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections are strongly and
robustly associated with the ambient atmospheric
temperature. The results of our analysis of longitudinal
data from 50 representative countries in the Northern
Hemisphere suggest that the minimum daily
temperature impacts both SARS CoV-2 transmissibility
and viability. In addition, we found that the median
daily dewpoint had a significant effect on the
cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases over time.
However, because of the collinearity between
dewpoint and atmospheric temperature over time, it
was not possible to deduce whether the two
atmospheric parameters independently affect SAR CoV2 transmission. Since dewpoint is less predictable, and
temperature more frequently monitored and used as a
meteorological variable, we focused on changes in
temperature for its potential predictive value.

In temperate regions, the annual occurrence of
respiratory viral diseases during the winter season-from the common cold to influenza-- has been
appreciated for several thousand years.(2) A similar
seasonal pattern of infections has been reported for
SARS-CoV, which was prevalent mostly during winter
months.(2) Despite this, there is sparse evidence on the
seasonal behavior of the novel SARS-CoV-2,(3) and
there are conflicting reports on how its transmission is
affected by meteorological conditions. In this context,
our study provides the most comprehensive and up-todate evidence for a robust and significant impact of
temperature and dewpoint on SARS-CoV-2
transmissibility.

We found that in 50 representative countries
spread out over 70% of the possible latitude and
longitude across the Northern Hemisphere, a slower
rise in the log of daily cumulative number of confirmed
cases was associated with higher daily minimum
temperatures and dewpoints over the period from
1/22/20 to 4/6/20. This finding was robust, yielding an
adjusted R2=0.610, p=1.45 x 10-6 (using covariates
Tmin_Med, median age, land area per capita, and days
of cases). The correlation between the reciprocal of the
rise in the log of the daily number of death and
recovered cases (CT-1) vs Tmin_Med was almost 50%
less than that of confirmed cases. This is not surprising,
given that the impact of temperature on seasonal
respiratory viruses has been found to have a consistent
influence on the stability and transmission of infection,
and not on the morbidity of infected individuals.(2) In
view of these findings, atmospheric temperature would

Further research is needed to clarify whether the
association between temperature and SARS-CoV-2
transmissibility described here has a biological
underpinning, and whether our model is accurate for
longitudinal predictions of the spread of the virus over
different geographical areas. Nonetheless, should the
associations between temperature and the rate of
transmission hold true (because of an underlying causal
relationship or because of the empirical relationship
described here), it may be possible to approximate the
impact of weather on the rates of transmission of SARSCoV2.
Because atmospheric parameters are
measurable, and routinely tracked on a daily basis
across the world, determining the contribution of
temperature to the rate of transmission should make it
possible to quantify the contribution of non-weather
conditions (e.g., social and non-pharmaceutical

interventions (NPI))—e.g. observed rate of transmission
is equal to the contribution of meteorological variables
plus the contribution of NPI. Once calibrated to the
contributions of weather and social interventions and
other NPI, such estimates may be able to inform and
guide systematic academic, business and governmental
decisions about when and to what extent to impose or
relax shelter-in-place or social distancing guidelines.
Such evidence-based policies may succeed in
minimizing social and economic disruptions due to the
pandemic while at the same time optimizing public
health and safety. Finally, our analysis predicts that,
between the range of 30 to 100 F, the decrease in the
rate of COVID-19 transmission with increasing
temperature (1% per degree F) is smaller than the
increase rate of transmission with decreasing with
temperatures (3.7% per degree F) in the 50
representative countries in the Northern Hemisphere
countries examined. If this model is correct, then it
implies that effort invested in containing, minimizing,
and ideally eliminating the spread of COVID-19 during
spring and summer months could pay off significantly in
the fall and winter, due to potentially disproportionate
effects of decreasing temperatures compared to
increasing temperatures on the current pandemic.

Fifty representative countries meeting specific criteria (e.g. all Northern Hemisphere, because seasons
in Southern Hemisphere are opposite). Meteorological data (daily minimum and average temperatures,
daily dewpoint) were obtained from NOAA stations closest to the latitude and longitude listed in the
JHU COVID-19 database (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) as the location from
which cases in each country were associated. Median minimum temperature (Tmin MEDIAN) and
dewpoint (DP MEDIAN) were ascertained for each country over the timeframe that cases were
increasing between 1/22/20 (when data began to be collected) and 4/6/20. Median average temperature
is included as a reference to provide the reader with additional climate information about each country.
Linear regression of the log of the daily cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases versus time
(sequential days) was conducted, starting with the date of the first case for each country, and the
resulting regression coefficients (which were termed coefficients of time(CT)) for each country was
thereby obtained. R2 are shown for this linear regression in each country. The reciprocal of CT (CT-1)
was used in a second regression analysis of CT-1 vs Tmin MEDIAN, to explore the correlation between
temperature and rates of increase in the log of confirmed cases. The second regression included with
temperature or dewpoint the additional independent variables of Land Area per capita, Median Age,
and Days of Cases for each country, because of the potential influence of these variables on
interactions and behavior that could influence rates of transmission. Land area for each country was
obtained from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) and median age
from CIA World Factbook (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-worldfactbook/fields/343rank.html).

The regression coefficients (abbreviated CT for coefficients of time) from the linear regression of the
log of cumulative COVID-19 cases vs time (see Table 1) for each country were converted to their

reciprocal values (CT-1). This was done because of an approximate proportionality of fitted CT with
the standardized residuals when performing linear regression with Tmin MEDIAN.(11) A second
regression was then performed using the CT-1 for each country as the dependent variable and
independent variables consisting of associated meteorological variables (i.e. median minimal
temperature [Tmin] or median dewpoint [DP]) with or without regional demographic variables (i.e.
land area and population median age). The total number of days for each country during which they
had cases of COVID-19 between 1/22/20 and 4/6/20 (Days of Cases) was also used as a covariate. The
resulting regression coefficients and p values for each independent variable is shown, as is the R2 for
each regression. All countries were included in the Confirmed Case Analysis. For Death Cases there
were 4 countries not included for the following three reasons: 1) Insufficient data for Kuwait (3 days of
0 log cases) and Vietnam (no days of deaths), 2) Inconsistent and limited data for Slovakia (4 days 0
log cases, 10 days no reported cases, then 5 days 0 log cases followed by a single 0.3 log cases), 3)
Outlier: Iceland. Recovered Cases had one exclusion: Outlier: Slovakia. Outliers were determined
using the ROUT method of Graph Pad’s Prism software. Briefly, ROUT first fits a model to the data
using a robust method where outliers have little impact. Then it uses a new outlier detection method,
based on the false discovery rate, to decide which points are far enough from the prediction of the
model to be called outliers.(14) Red p Values = p > 0.05
