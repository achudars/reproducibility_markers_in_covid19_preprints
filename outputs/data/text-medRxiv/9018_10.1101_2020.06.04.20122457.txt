ABSTRACT
Background
A high proportion of COVID-19 patients develop acute liver dysfunction. Early research has
suggested that pre-existing fatty liver disease may be a significant risk factor for hospitalisation.
Liver fat, in particular, is a modifiable parameter and can be a target for public health policy
and individual patient plans. In this study we aimed to assess pre-existing liver disease as a risk
factor for developing symptomatic COVID-19.
Methods
From 502,506 participants from the UK Biobank, 42,146 underwent MRI (aged 45-82), and had
measures of liver fat, liver fibroinflammatory disease and liver iron. Patients were censored on
May 28th to determine how many had tested for COVID-19 with symptomatic disease. UK
testing was restricted to those with symptoms in hospital. COVID-19 symptoms included fever,
dry cough, sore throat, diarrhoea and fatigue. Univariate analysis was performed on liver
phenotypic biomarkers to determine if these variables increased risk of symptomatic COVID19, and compared to previously described risk factors associated with severe COVID-19,
including to age, ethnicity, gender and obesity,
Findings
Increased liver fat was associated with a higher risk for symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 in
this population in univariate analysis(OR:1.85, p=0.03). In obese participants, only those with
concomitant fatty liver(≥10%) were at increased risk(OR:2.96, p=0.02), with those having
normal liver fat (<5%) showing no increased risk(OR:0.36, p=0.09).

UK Biobank data demonstrated an association between pre-existing liver disease and obesity
with severe COVID-19, with higher proportions of liver fat in obese individuals a likely risk factor
for symptomatic disease and severity.
Public policy measures to protect patients with liver disease who may have almost double the
risk of the general population should be considered, especially as dietary and pharmacological
strategies to reduce body weight and liver fat already exist.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the recently discovered
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Risk factors leading to severe infection have been identified in
previous studies around the world (1–3) including increased age, male sex, non-Caucasian
ethnicity and the presence of pre-existing co-morbidities, in particular cardiovascular and
metabolic conditions, particularly those conditions involving liver function.
The majority of patients experiencing COVID-19 developed abnormal liver function(4), with
studies reporting abnormal alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
albumin levels, and increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) serum in severe patients (6).
The development of liver injury was more common in severe COVID-19, with liver injury in mild
disease often transient and resolving without treatment.
The mechanistic link between COVID-19 and the liver may relate to the expression of the ACE2
protein, through which SARS-CoV-2 is believed to enter cells(7) in cholangiocytes (8). However,
recent studies have also shown a hepatocellular profile of damage rather than cholestasis (9).
Alternative hypotheses suggest that liver injury in severe cases is being caused by an immune
response triggered by the infection (6) or due to a drug-induced liver injury from the antivirals,
antibiotics and steroids widely being used for treating COVID-19 (10).
Traditionally, characterisation of chronic liver disease has relied on invasive liver biopsy to
evaluate the pathological hallmarks of disease: fibrosis, inflammation, and steatosis(11). More
recently, scalable, non-invasive alternatives with precise and accurate quantitative
measurements have been developed using MRI biomarkers of liver fat (also known as Proton
Density Fat Fraction, PDFF, and fibroinflammation, cT1). Multiparametric MRI measuring liver
fat and fibroinflammation has demonstrated value in characterising liver disease(12,13) and
predicting clinical outcomes(14). This has allowed for determination of the current prevalence

of fatty liver disease in the UK adult population, along with genetic associations with liver fat
and fibroinflammation(15). The UK Biobank has recently released COVID-19 data on testing
status for a subset of participants, thus offering a unique resource for investigating the
associations between demographic, phenotypic and genotypic factors with COVID-19 disease
severity and related healthcare outcomes.
The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that liver disease, and specifically liver fat
accumulation, is a risk factor for developing symptomatic COVID-19.

METHODS
42,146 participants were extracted from the UK Biobank (UKB) imaging study with complete
liver imaging to measure fat and fibroinflammatory disease. Of these, 287 had a COVID-19 test
result available with 79 testing positive and 208 testing negatives (Figure 1).
Patient meta-data including information on COVID-19 testing status, demographics, diabetes
status, cardiometabolic risk factors and genetic variants associated with liver disease were
available. No biochemistry data was available for ALT, AST, albumin or GGT levels. MRI
measurement of liver fat (proton density fat fraction, PDFF, measured in %) and
fibroinflammation (iron corrected T1 mapping, cT1, measured in ms) biomarkers were
obtained. Both liver fat and cT1 have been included in the large cohort UK Biobank Study (UKB)
(16,17) due to the repeatability and reproducibility of LiverMultiScan (18), and suitability for
large-scale population imaging.

Liver fat and cT1 are both continuous variables, with

population reference ranges and cut-offs for disease previously described. Liver fat >5% is
diagnostic of fatty liver disease (19); liver fat >10% is considered to qualify as severe fatty liver
disease and is a commonly used inclusion criteria in clinical trials of patients with non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH)(20).

A liver cT1 greater than 825ms has been shown to predict liver-related clinical outcomes (14),
comparably to histological fibrosis staging.
UKB has released COVID-19 test results from 16 March 2020 onwards, with the majority of
SARS-CoV-2 positive tests coming from patients with symptoms in hospital due to the nature
of UK testing.
We accessed UKB to determine datasets related to liver health using application 9914
(Determining the Outcomes of People with Liver Disease). The UKB has approval from the
North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee (MREC) and obtained written informed
consent from all participants prior to the study.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using R software (version 3.6.1) with a p-value less than 0.05
considered statistically significant. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise baseline
participant characteristics. Mean and standard deviation (SD) were used to describe normally
distributed-continuous variables, median with interquartile range for non-normally
distributed, and frequency and percentage for categorical variables. Mean difference in
biomarker values between those who tested positive for COVID-19 and those who did not were
compared using the Mann-Whitney-U test, and difference in the counts of the binary
outcomes of the self-reported conditions were compared using chi-squared tests.
To discriminate patients who tested positive from those who did not, we measured for count
data computing the summary measures of risk and a chi-squared test for difference in the
observed proportions from count data, presented in a 2 by 2 table with the function epi.2by2
from the library epiR in R. Subsequently, univariable logistic regression analysis was performed
for all the potential predictors which included liver fat, cT1, age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index
(BMI), self-reported diabetes and self-reported hypertension status. This was performed using

the GLM function in R and the brglm2 tool that aims to reduce the bias observed when results
are sparse. Risk scores were extracted from the odds ratio estimates of having a positive rest
as calculated in the logistic regression model with confidence intervals calculated with the
Wald’s test. Pearson’s Chi-square test of independence was used to investigate the
relationship of the genetic variation and the result on the COVID-19 test.

RESULTS
Participant characteristics for each of the groups evaluated in this study are reported in table1.
In the symptomatic and tested population, male participants were more likely to test positive
for COVID-19. Comparing those that tested positive to the untested population, being male,
non-white-British, and diabetic all increased likelihood of being symptomatic and receiving a
positive COVID-19 test. The median age of those being symptomatic and testing positive was
lower than in the untested population.
Table 2 reports the associations between liver fat and fibroinflammation with the likelihood of
being symptomatic and testing positive for COVID-19. A normal liver fat (<5%) is protective
against being symptomatic and testing positive, whereas increasing severity of fatty liver
disease, or evidence of liver fibroinflammation, increases the likelihood of being symptomatic
with COVID-19 (Figure 2).
Univariate analysis of the imaging biomarkers and known exposures linked to COVID-19
positivity revealed having liver fat ≥10% (P<0.03), being obese (P<0.03), being of non-white
ethnicity (P<0.02) and having hypertension(P<0.04) all significantly increased the odds of
testing positive for COVID-19 by 1.85 (CI: 1.05-3.25), 1.87 (CI: 1.06- 3.3), 2.02 (CI: 1.11-3.67)
and 2.1 (CI: 1.05-4.21) respectively (figure 3).

Furthermore, the 32.7% of obese patients with liver fat ≥10% had a higher likelihood of being
symptomatic and testing positive for COVID-19 (OR: 2.96, p=0.02). In contrast, the 37.2% of
obese patients with normal liver fat (OR: 0.36, p=0.09) did not (Table3).

DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to explore the hypothesis that pre-existing liver disease increases the
risk of having symptomatic COVID-19. We report on a cohort of 42,146 participants from the
UKB with complete liver imaging, of which 287 have COVID-19 test results available with 79
participants testing positive. Our study demonstrates that in addition to the previouslyreported risk factors of male gender, non-white-British ethnicity, and obesity (1–3), liver fat is
also a significant risk factor for having symptomatic COVID-19, with a person testing positive
for COVID-19 being 1.85 times more likely to have pre-existing severe fatty liver disease. To
put that into context, 4743 people in this cohort of 42,146 had severe fatty liver disease,
suggesting that 11% of the UK population carries this higher risk for COVID-19. Several risk
factors have been identified from early studies in China (1), Europe (2) and the US (3) that lead
to severe infection, including increased age, male sex, non-Caucasian ethnicity and the
presence of pre-existing co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular and metabolic conditions,
including diseases of the liver. Unlike previous studies, our research does not find increasing
age as a risk factor in this cohort, but this is likely an artefact of the limited age range in the
UKB population and increasing likelihood of exposure to the virus in people of working age
versus those that had recently retired.
In line with our findings, previous studies have reported BMI as a risk factor for COVID-19, but
the mechanism(s) of excess weight in conferring additional risk remain unclear. In this study,
more than a third of obese participants (37.2%) had normal liver fat and were not at increased

risk of being symptomatic and testing positive for COVID-19. In contrast, obese patients with
liver fat ≥10%, representing approximately one third of the obese population, did have
significantly higher odds of being symptomatic and testing positive for COVID-19. This
highlights the important independent role of liver fat, in addition to obesity, in the severity of,
and susceptibility to, COVID-19.
Due to the nature of UK testing for COVID-19 over the period these data were collected, only
those symptomatic for the disease to the extent that hospitalisation was warranted will have
had test results available. Given the high prevalence of fatty liver disease in the general
population, combined with the utility of lifestyle-interventions (22), and new therapeutics that
have demonstrated clear reversal of fatty liver disease in weeks, patients with high liver fat
may benefit from going on calorie restriction diets and pharmacotherapeutic interventions.
Investigational therapies such as NGM282 and Resmetirom have been shown to reduce liver
fat in a matter of weeks (23,24), but need to be trialled specifically for utility in this context of
use. More generally, public health measures should be considered to protect the 11% of the
UK population that has liver fat greater than 10%, as their risk of experiencing COVID-19 with
sufficient severity to require hospitalisation has more than doubled.
The main limitation of our study is the relatively small proportion of UKB participants for which
testing results are available. This analysis was performed on the second release of COVID-19
testing data and subsequent analyses as more data are released will provide additional power
to investigate a larger number of exposures. This limitation is largely a result of UK policy at
the time to only test those patients requiring hospitalisation; however, one benefit of this is
policy is the ability to infer that those participants who tested positive had severe COVID-19
disease requiring hospitalisation. This inference will not be possible in future releases of

COVID-19 testing data following changes in the UK testing policy to support widespread
testing.

CONCLUSIONS
This study highlights the potentially important role of liver disease in COVID-19 severity. As
more data becomes available through the UKB, further investigations into the associations of
liver health with other demographic characteristics and co-morbidities may reveal more
detailed relationships, for example, between multiple risk factors and the development of
severe COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of fatty liver disease, and the availability of new
treatments specifically for fatty liver disease, these results have the potential to inform public
health policy around the management of this at-risk population.
