Abstract
Purpose: COVIDTrach is a UK multi-centre prospective cohort study project evaluating the outcomes
of tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 receiving mechanical ventilation. It also examines the
incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers involved in the procedure.

Method: An invitation to participate was sent to all UK NHS departments involved in tracheostomy
in COVID-19 patients. Data was entered prospectively and clinical outcomes updated via an online
database (REDCap). Clinical variables were compared with outcomes using multivariable regression
analysis, with logistic regression used to develop a prediction model for mortality. Participants
recorded whether any operators tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks of the procedure.

Results: The cohort comprised 1605 tracheostomy cases from 126 UK hospitals. The median time
from intubation to tracheostomy was 15 days (IQR 11, 21). 285 (18%) patients died following the
procedure. 1229 (93%) of the survivors had been successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation at
censoring and 1049 (81%) had been discharged from hospital. Age, inspired oxygen concentration,
PEEP setting, pyrexia, number of days of ventilation before tracheostomy, C-reactive protein and the
use of anticoagulation and inotropic support independently predicted mortality. Six reports were
received of operators testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks of the procedure.

Conclusions: Tracheostomy appears to be safe in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19
and to operators performing the procedure and we identified clinical indicators that are predictive of
mortality.

Funding: The COVIDTrach project is supported by the Wellcome Trust UCL COVID-19 Rapid Response
Award and the National Institute for Health Research.

Trial registration: The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.Gov (NCT04572438).

Introduction
As of 1st September 2020, there were over 33 million cases of COVID-19 globally with average daily
new cases exceeding 250,000 [1]. Data indicate that 5-12% develop a severe illness requiring critical
care, of whom 72-81% require invasive mechanical ventilation [2-6]. The UK experienced a peak in
infection during the months of March and April 2020 followed by a decline and low plateau of new
cases during June and July. Of approximately 10,894 patients recorded in the UK Intensive Care
National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) database that were admitted to intensive care during
this period, over 7792 required advanced respiratory support [7].
Standard UK intensive care practice is to consider tracheostomy after 7-10 days of invasive
mechanical ventilation to aid weaning, facilitate comfort and minimize complications relating to the
prolonged presence of an oral endotracheal tube [8-11]. The role of tracheostomy in COVID-19
remains controversial. Guidance early in the pandemic ranged from avoiding tracheostomy
completely to delaying tracheostomy until 14-21 days after intubation [12-14], and to only proceed
once the patient was COVID-19 test negative [15-17]. These recommendations aimed to prevent
nosocomial infection among healthcare professionals and to avoid futile procedures. The evidence
base for these recommendations was largely based on expert opinion. Subsequent evidence
suggests the risk of transmission declines 3-4 days after symptom onset and that standard COVID-19
testing does not reflect the risk of infectivity later in the disease process [18, 19]. Several series
reporting outcomes following tracheostomy in ventilated COVID-19 patients demonstrate high rates
of survival and weaning success and no SARS-COV-2 infection among those involved in the
procedure [20-22] .
COVIDTrach is a UK multidisciplinary collaborative project examining the outcomes of tracheostomy
in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 in UK intensive care units and the occurrence of
SARS-CoV-2 infection among operators. An interim report documenting the first 548 patients during
the first two months of the pandemic reported a hospital mortality of 12%, weaning success in 52%,
and no instances of SARS-CoV-2 infection among operators at the time of writing [23]. This article
presents a larger cohort of patients, their long-term outcomes and a further analysis of parameters
that may predict survival.

Methods
Study design
COVIDTrach is a multicentre prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients with
COVID-19 who undergo tracheostomy. An invitation for clinicians to participate in the COVIDTrach
project was disseminated via the UK Federation of Surgical Specialty Associations, its various
member organizations and the Intensive Care Society to reach all UK departments involved in
tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. Inclusion into the study was also advertised on societal websites
and social media. 137 hospital sites agreed to participate across all four nations of the United
Kingdom.

Patient population
Each participating hospital included all consecutive adult patients over 18 years of age with COVID19 who underwent elective tracheostomy while receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. Infection
was identified by a positive viral RNA test on quantitative RT-PCR testing or when strongly suspected
on history, laboratory, and radiological findings in the absence of viral RNA test availability or a
positive result. Children under the age of 18 years and those undergoing emergency tracheostomy
were excluded.

Clinical indicators and outcome measures
Demographic data, clinical characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 status, ventilatory requirements before
tracheostomy, details of the tracheostomy and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were
all recorded (data dictionary in appendix). Clinical outcomes included complications, mortality, time
from tracheostomy to weaning from mechanical ventilation, success, and time to tracheostomy
decannulation, and time from tracheostomy to hospital discharge. Successful weaning was defined
as being free from pressure support for greater than 24 hours. Participants were also asked to report
whether any of the operators performing the procedure tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within two
weeks of the procedure.

Procedures
Data was collected using an online survey tool (REDCap) with return codes issued to allow
participants to update clinical outcomes prospectively. All participants were asked to update the
clinical outcomes of their cases by July 1st 2020 and confirm the data were complete. Hospital sites
with missing data or data that had not been updated to within the last two weeks of June 2020,

were followed up over the course of July and early August. Hospitals with datasets not updated by
15th August 2020 were removed from the study (n=11).

Ethics and data governance
The study was approved by the Health Research Authority (20/HRA/3766), the Scottish Public
Benefit and Privacy Panel and Northern Island’s Privacy Advisory Committee and was registered as a
service evaluation or research study at each participating site. All data collected were anonymized
and non-identifiable and did not alter the patient’s clinical care. The study is registered with
ClinicalTrials.Gov (NCT04572438).

Statistical analysis
Variables are presented using either mean (SD), median (IQR) or number (percentage), as
appropriate. Groups of variables were compared using either t-tests or chi-squared tests, as
appropriate. For multivariable regression analysis, all numerical variables, except age, were logtransformed. Logistic regression was used to develop a prediction model for mortality, after
imputing missing values using multiple imputation via chained equations. Backwards elimination at
the 10% significance level was used to remove unimportant variables from the model. This model
was internally validated using 10-fold cross-validation. Model performance (calibration and
discrimination) was quantified using the calibration slope and calibration in the large, and ROC
curves.

Results
Participants
Between 6th April and 26th August 2020, data was received on 1605 tracheostomies from 126 UK
hospitals led by a combination of ENT, maxillofacial and intensive care specialists (Figure 1). The
number of tracheostomy cases entered by each hospital ranged from 1-106 (mean 12). Across all
cases, over 90% of all data points were completed in all but three variables where completeness was
85% or greater (Supplementary table 1). The average patient age was 58 ± 11 years with a 70:30
male to female ratio. More detailed patient demographics and medical history are presented in
Table 1 and COVID-19 test status in Table 2.

Timing of tracheostomy procedure
The median time from intubation to tracheostomy was 15 days (IQR 11, 21) (Figure 2a). Seventythree (4.5%) patients had tracheostomy within 4 days of intubation and 227 (14%) after 25 days. The
mean C-reactive protein on the day of tracheostomy was 119 (SD, 88) mg/l.

Tracheostomy procedure
“Anticipated prolonged wean” was the most cited indication for tracheostomy in 1473 (92%). An
open method of tracheostomy was used in 797 (50%) procedures, percutaneous method in 771
(48%), and a hybrid method using a combination of open and percutaneous techniques in 31 (2%)
(Figure 2b). Bronchoscopy was used as an aid in 574 (78%) percutaneous techniques. Patient factors
likely to make the tracheostomy more challenging were reported in 327 (41%) open and 109 (14%)
percutaneous tracheostomies. Of these, neck obesity was the most frequently reported, occurring in
242 (30%) of all open tracheostomies.
Operators used either an FFP3 mask or Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) in 1563 (99%) of
cases (Figure 2c). Other PPE included double gloves in 1460 (91%), a surgical gown in 1511 (94%),
and a face visor was used in 1261 (96%) of cases in addition to an FFP3 mask.

Complications
Intraoperative complications were reported in 147 (9%) procedures with oxygen desaturation below
80% being the most common (n=67), followed by intra-operative bleeding (n=29). Post-operative
complications occurred in 356 (22%) cases; bleeding was reported in 119 (7%) patients, more
frequently following open procedures (p<0.001). A leak around the tracheostomy cuff necessitating
a change in tube was reported in 75 (5%) cases, 48 of these were open tracheostomies.

Outcomes
In this cohort, one patient died during the tracheostomy procedure, 276 (17%) patients died before
weaning from mechanical ventilation and a further nine (1%) patients died between successful
weaning and hospital discharge (Table 3). 249 (89%) deaths were COVID-19 related and nine patients
died of tracheostomy-related complications.
Characteristics of survivors and non-survivors are shown in Supplementary Table 2. A multivariable
logistic regression model was fitted for mortality and backward elimination applied. Age, days of

mechanical ventilation pre-procedure, inspired oxygen concentration and PEEP setting at the time of
tracheostomy, use of inotropic support (all p<0.001), upward trending CRP (P=0.003), pyrexia
(p=0.003) and use of anticoagulation (p=0.002) are independently associated with mortality (Figure
3a).
A model was developed to predict mortality. Internal validation using 10-fold cross-validation
produced an average ROC area of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.73 to 0.79), suggesting good discrimination (Figure
3b). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test results in each cross-validation fold suggest no problems with
calibration. A comparison of observed and predicted outcomes suggests good agreement (Figure 3c)
with a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 65%. The corresponding positive predictive value and
negative predictive value are 33% and 93% respectively.
Of the survivors, 1229 (93%) had been successfully weaned at the time of analysis with 1154 (88%)
having undergone successful tube decannulation and 1049 (81%) discharged from hospital (Table 3).
Median time from tracheostomy to discharge to hospital in survivors was 29 days (IQR 21, 42).
Characteristics of patients according to length of time to successful wean from ventilation are shown
in Supplementary Table 3. A multivariable logistic regression model for time to wean success was
fitted and backward elimination applied. These results suggest that advanced age, male sex, higher
PEEP setting, higher inspired oxygen requirement, use of anticoagulation (all p<0.001) and noninvasive ventilation before tracheostomy (p=0.003) were all independently associated with
prolonged periods of ventilation following tracheostomy (Table 4). An association was found
between insertion technique and time to successful wean, although the difference was small
(median 12 days for percutaneous versus 11 days for open method). No association was found
between time from intubation to tracheostomy and time from tracheostomy to successful
ventilatory wean (p=0.92).

SARS-CoV-2 infection in operators
The question “Did any of the operators test positive for COVID-19 within two weeks of the
procedure?”, was answered in 97% (1558/1605) of cases. Six instances were reported across four
hospitals, four after percutaneous tracheostomy and two after open tracheostomy. Five of the cases
were performed in intensive care and four within a negative pressure environment. Personal
protective equipment used in these cases included an FFP3 mask in four cases, a fluid-resistant hood
with face visor in one, and a PAPR device in one.

Discussion
This study involved 126 UK hospitals reporting on 1605 individual tracheostomies. Given the
Intensive Care National Audit reports on 7792 patients requiring advanced respiratory support
across 265 hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Island, our cohort is representative, and the
results are likely generalizable to the UK.
At the time of censoring, all-cause mortality following tracheostomy in our cohort was 18%. This
number is likely to rise as 91 patients were still mechanically ventilated and a further 171 had been
weaned but were still in hospital. Prospective multicentre studies of general (non-COVID-19)
intensive care populations patients report mortality rates of approximately 30% in the first 30 days
following tracheostomy [24, 25]. Direct comparisons to this cohort of COVID-19 patients cannot
however be drawn as demographics, comorbidities and underlying pathologies will differ
considerably and timing of tracheostomy is usually performed earlier than the median 15 days
following intubation reported in this study of COVID-19 patients. National data reported in the
ICNARC registry, indicates that the ICU mortality rate in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients
was 47.8%, however median duration of critical care stay in non-survivors was 10 days (IQR 6,17) [7].
Thus COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy constitute a preselected population who have
survived the acute phase and, in general, would have cardiorespiratory stability and are no longer
requiring high-level ventilatory support and high inspired oxygen concentrations. Nonetheless, our
data shows that tracheostomy in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not a futile intervention as
previously claimed by some expert opinion at the start of the pandemic [26, 27].
Whether the timing of tracheostomy does influence COVID-19 patient outcomes is unclear. Early
tracheostomy may benefit certain patient groups [28, 29], but meta-analyses have failed to show
benefit in a general population of critically ill adults [30, 31]. In randomized trials, approximately half
of patients randomized to late tracheostomy eventually did not undergo the procedure, mainly due
to successful extubation [24, 31]. In our cohort, early tracheostomy was independently associated
with higher mortality. Moreover, no association was demonstrated between early tracheostomy and
shortened time to successful weaning from ventilation. Clearly, cause and effect cannot be directly
inferred from this data and only prospective randomized studies could address this important
question.
We found no association between method of tracheostomy and likelihood of successful wean from
ventilation, mortality, or discharge from hospital. As in non-COVID-19 series, bleeding was more

frequent using the open method, although the overall rate of reported bleeding was low. The
percutaneous method has several advantages centered around the ability to perform the procedure
at the bedside. In contrast, the open method enables safe procedure in those with difficult neck
anatomy and enables the surgical workforce to relieve the task from intensive care staff during
periods when a critical care department is working at full capacity. The decision over which method
to employ should be locally led and depends upon expertise available and close inter-disciplinary
working.
The low rates of reported SARS-COV-2 infection among operators who likely continued to work in
other high-risk areas and performed other aerosol generating procedures is encouraging. Whilst
asymptomatic cases may have been missed and recall bias may have occurred, the low rates of
infection suggest that, with appropriate PPE, the procedure does not pose a high risk of infection
with SARS-COV-2 to operators. Our findings are consistent with other series [32, 33].
Infectivity and viral load is believed to peak around the time of symptom onset and then decline
over the following 3-4 days [34, 35]. Considering the median time from symptom presentation to
hospitalization is four days and that tracheostomy is not usually considered until at least seven days
after intubation, the risk of infectivity is predicted to be low even if the procedure is performed
between the first and second week of ventilation [4, 36]. Our results therefore do not support
guidance suggesting tracheostomy should be delayed until 14-21 days after intubation to reduce the
potential for infection amongst operators [14, 16]. Similarly, our findings and data showing a positive
COVID-19 test does not correlate with risk of infectivity later in the disease process, suggest
tracheostomy should not be delayed to achieve a negative COVID-19 test. Delaying in these
circumstances defers the potential benefits of tracheostomy and increases the risk of complications
relating to prolonged endotracheal intubation without any clear benefit to the patient or operators
involved in the procedure.
