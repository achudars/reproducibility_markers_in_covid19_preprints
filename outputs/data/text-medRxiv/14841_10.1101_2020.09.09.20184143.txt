ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no proven effective therapy nor vaccine for the treatment
of SARS-CoV-2. Evidence regarding the potential benefit of early administration of
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy in symptomatic patients with Coronavirus Disease
(COVID-19) is not clear.
METHODS: This observational prospective cohort study took place in 238 ambulatory fever
clinics in Saudi Arabia, which followed the Ministry of Health (MOH) COVID-19 treatment
guideline. This guideline included multiple treatment options for COVID-19 based on the best
available evidence at the time, among which was Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Patients with
confirmed COVD-19 (by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test) who
presented to these clinics with mild to moderate symptoms during the period from 5-26 June
2020 were included in this study. Our study looked at those who received HCQ-based therapy
along with supportive care (SC) and compared them to patients who received SC alone. The
primary outcome was hospital admission within 28-days of presentation. The secondary
outcome was a composite of intensive care admission (ICU) and/or mortality during the followup period. Outcome data were assessed through a follow-up telephonic questionnaire at day
28 and were further verified with national hospitalisation and mortality registries. Multiple
logistic regression model was used to control for prespecified confounders.
RESULTS: Of the 7,892 symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who visited the
ambulatory fever clinics during the study period, 5,541 had verified clinical outcomes at day
28 (1,817 patients in the HCQ group vs 3,724 in the SC group). At baseline, patients who
received HCQ therapy were more likely to be males who did not have hypertension or chronic
lung disease compared to the SC group. No major differences were noted regarding other
comorbid conditions. All patients were presenting with active complaints; however, the HCQ
groups had higher rates of symptoms compared to the SC group (fever: 84% vs 66.3, headache:
49.8 vs 37.4, cough: 44.5 vs 35.6, respectively). Early HCQ-based therapy was associated with
a lower hospital admission within 28-days compared to SC alone (9.4% compared to 16.6%,
RRR 43%, p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and/or mortality at 28days was also lower in the HCQ group compared to the SC (1.2% compared to 2.6%, RRR
54%, p-value 0.001). Adjusting for age, gender, and major comorbid conditions, a multivariate
logistic regression model showed a decrease in the odds of hospitalisation in patients who
received HCQ compared to SC alone (adjusted OR 0.57 [95% CI 0.47-0.69], p-value <0.001).
The
composite outcome of ICU admission and/or mortality was also lower for the HCQ group

compared to the SC group controlling for potential confounders (adjusted OR 0.55 [95% CI
0.34-0.91], p-value 0.019).
CONCLUSION: Early intervention with HCQ-based therapy in patients with mild to
moderate symptoms at presentation is associated with lower adverse clinical outcomes among
COVID-19 patients, including hospital admissions, ICU admission, and/or death.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a pandemic infection that caused significant morbidity and
mortality worldwide. Globally, extensive efforts have been made to explore effective and safe
therapeutics against the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2 (1). Several medications, including
remdesivir, favipiravir, the combination of ribavirin, interferon-beta, and lopinavir-ritonavir,
have been suggested based on promising in-vitro results therapeutic experiences from two other
coronavirus diseases; severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory
syndrome. However, none of these medications has yet been translated into clinical benefits in
treating patients with COVID-19 (2, 3).
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), best known as an antimalarial medication, is prominent on the
list of potential COVID-19 treatments, owing to its potent antiviral activity against SARSCoV-2 in in-vitro studies and the results from several trials (4, 5). In-vitro studies show that
HCQ blocks COVID-19 infection at a low-micromolar concentration, with a half-maximal
effective concentration (EC50) of 1.13 μM and a half-cytotoxic concentration (CC50) greater
than 100 μM. The exact mechanism of HCQ’s antiviral activity in HIV is not fully understood,
yet several mechanisms have been proposed (7-10). Early theories focused on alterations in
post-transcriptional development of the outer HIV surface molecule glycoprotein 120 (gp120),
which would render newly formed virions non-infectious (7-12).
To date, studies regarding the efficacy of HCQ, whether alone or in combination with
azithromycin, have been contradicting with some pointing towards improved various clinical
outcomes (4,5,13-16). In contrast, others failed to demonstrate any benefit (17-21). However,
there are major differences amongst these studies in terms of the populations which received
HCQ vs a comparator and the timing of initiation of the therapy which may have a significant
impact on the variability of these results.

Zinc is a supplement which also has potential antiviral properties that affect the common cold,
many of which are due to coronaviruses (22). The combination of HCQ with zinc in the
treatment of COVID-19 patients, in an out-or inpatient setting, has been believed to improve
the clinical outcome and limit COVID-19 mortality rates, especially if given in early stages of
the disease (14). However, evidence regarding the potential therapy of HCQ, whether given
alone or in combination with zinc, for COVID-19 patients, is not clear and limited (23)
Furthermore, chloroquine and its derivative HCQ may hamper cardiac function at clinically
relevant doses, and its safety margin is questionable (20,24). Therefore, further studies are
needed to monitor this medication’s safety and benefits.
As part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health
(MOH) launched a national fever clinic program to support the acute healthcare system.
Healthcare providers at these clinics were managing patients according to a national MOH
COVID-19 management guideline which included the option of starting HCQ in addition to
the supportive care according to disease severity (25). This study aims to assess the effect of
the early use of HCQ in addition to supportive care (SC) compared to supportive care SC
alone in patients with confirmed COVID-19 (by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test)
presenting with mild or moderate disease at these ambulatory fever clinics on 28-day adverse
clinical outcomes.
METHODS
Study setting and design
The national COVID-19 response led by the Ministry of Health (MOH) at Saudi Arabia
focused on providing guidance on diagnostic and therapeutic options for COVID-19 as well as
improving access to care across the Kingdom. Within that, a comprehensive COVID-19
management guideline was devised by a group of clinical experts according to the best
available evidence at the time and was published and periodically reviewed by the MOH (26).
This management guideline based the treatment on supportive care therapy in addition to other
therapeutics to be considered and included HCQ as a possible option for mild to moderate
disease if there was no contraindication.
In line with the national COVID-19 response vision, the MOH also launched a national fever
clinic program across all regions of the Kingdom to support the healthcare system. By June
2020, a total of 238 fever clinics were fully operational in assessing patients with symptoms
concerning for COVID-19. These fever clinics provided free medical care to all community
members regardless of their nationality, insurance status, legal status, and area of residence.

The national fever clinic program included screening all patients using an approved national
visual triage checklist from the Saudi Center for Disease Control (26), measuring vital signs,
detailed assessment by a trained primary care provider, and considering treatment options per
the MOH management guideline (25). The fever clinics were designed to care for patients with
mild to moderate symptoms, while unstable patients were referred to emergency care services
(appendix.1). During the selected study period, HCQ was the only available treatment option
along with supportive care at these fever clinics. The final decision for starting HCQ therapy
in addition to supportive care was based on the individual provider's discretion after detailed
risk assessment (including comorbidity screening, baseline electrocardiogram (ECG), serum
electrolytes check) and the shared decision with the patient. Per the ambulatory fever clinic
program, patients with baseline abnormal QTc interval or electrolyte imbalances were not
prescribed HCQ. Given the overall safety concerns about HCQ therapy in patients above the
age of 65 years, the national ambulatory clinic program cautioned providers from prescribing
it to this age group. If HCQ was prescribed, patients were required to return for a follow-up
visit at day 3 to assess tolerance and to obtain repeat ECG and serum electrolytes to ensure
safety. HCQ therapy was discontinued at any time patients reported any medication-related
adverse events. All patients who attended these clinics provided consent be enrolled in and
allow the use of their clinical data for prospective research purposes at their first visit.
A comprehensive implementation plan was rolled out for this national fever clinic program
which included: 1) continuous supply chain of personnel protective equipment, medical
devices, and medications; 2) virtual training sessions of 990 primary care providers operating
these clinics by an infectious diseases specialist and a senior clinical pharmacist about the clinic
program; 3) hotline service to access infectious diseases expertise opinion when needed; 4)
standardised ambulatory medication prescription order sets to minimise variability; 5) fever
clinics with extended hours of service at 24 hours 7 days a week; 6) extensive media coverage
to educate the community about the program; 7) fully equipped call centre to coordinate
appointments and answer inquiries around the clock.
This observational prospective cohort study looks at the outcomes of patients presenting to
these ambulatory fever clinics during the period between the 5th to 26th of June 2020 who had
mild to moderate symptoms and were later confirmed to have COVID-19. All enrolled patients
were followed up telephonically at day 28 to record their outcomes (either personally or by a
family member).

Study participants
Symptomatic patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 who attended the ambulatory fever
clinics during the study period were included in this study. Mild to moderate symptoms
included fever (> 38 ⁰C) with or without one or more of the following symptoms: sore throat,
cough, diarrhoea, shortness of breath, headache, and myalgia. Patients who were less likely to
get HCQ prescriptions were excluded from the study cohort such as paediatrics patients (age <
14 years), pregnant and lactating ladies, patients known to have conductive heart disease,
immunocompromising conditions, baseline home oxygen requirement, morbid obesity (BMI ≥
35), known allergy to HCQ, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.
Study participants were divided into two groups; those who received the SC and those who
received HCQ therapy along with the SC. Per the national ambulatory fever clinic program,
the SC included symptomatic therapy with zinc sulphate 60 mg once daily for five days,
cetirizine 10 mg once daily for 10 days, and paracetamol on an as-needed basis. Those who
received HCQ were prescribed a regimen of 400 mg orally twice a day for the first day,
followed by 200 mg twice daily for an additional four days according to the MOH management
guideline. No dose adjustment was recommended in cases with renal or hepatic impairment.
Patients who had clinical progression or deterioration at day 3 assessment were referred to a
hospital setting for management and continued their participation in the study outcome
according to their initial assigned group. Study participants who did not show up for their day
3 assessment were excluded.
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome of interest was hospital admission within 28-days of presentation. The
secondary outcome of the study was a composite of ICU admission and/or mortality during the
28-day follow up period.
Data Collection Tools
A research electronic clinical data collection form (CDF) completed at the national fever clinic
program and a follow-up telephone questionnaire done at day 28 were used to collect data about
the study participants. Trained primary health care physicians filled out the CDF at day 1 and
day 3 assessment visits for each patient per the program requirement. The CDF included
patient's demographics, chronic medical conditions, presenting symptoms, physical exam
findings, laboratory results, procedures, and management done at each visit. Data entry officers
at the MOH regional Medical affairs entered the data from the CDFs into an advanced national
online database. The day 28 telephone questionnaire was conducted by trained personnel who

contacted the COVID-19 positive patients or their delegated family members and asked about
their clinical outcomes. Outcome data of all the PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were also
verified with reports from the National disease surveillance database (Health Electronic
Surveillance Network, HESN) and the MOH national morbidity & mortality registry. All
outcome data were additionally shared with regional Medical Affairs and were further verified
with local hospitalisation, ICU, and mortality registries.
Statistical Analysis
The data were analysed using SPSS® version 25.0. All the data had categorical characteristics,
which was described as frequency and percentages. Chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and
Crude odds ratio were used to compare symptomatic patients who received HCQ and SC across
Socio-demographic background variables and comorbid conditions. Multivariable Logistic
regression model was used to assess for primary and secondary outcomes controlling for age,
gender, and major comorbidities. The level of significance was considered at P<0.05.
Ethical consideration
The Saudi Arabian MOH central Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved this observational
prospective cohort study, log number: 20-129M. Study enrolment was voluntarily, and all study
participants signed an informed consent after receiving a detailed explanation of the research
study protocol by their treating physicians. As the study design is purely a prospective
observational cohort which followed a predefined population rather than an interventional trial,
clinical trial registration was exempted by the MOH Central IRB. The process of prescribing
HCQ in COVID-19 followed the national guideline of prescribing recommendation in Saudi
Arabia.
RESULTS
Among 13,592 patients who presented with symptoms to the ambulatory fever clinics during
the study period, 7,892 patients had PCR-confirmed COVID-19 of which 5,541 participants
responded to the 28-day telephone questionnaire, and their outcome data could be verified with
national registries were included in the final analysis. Figure.1 summarises patient population
selection. Among the study participants, almost 33% (n= 1,817) received HCQ in addition to
SC while 67.2% (n= 3,724) received the SC only. Table.1 summarises the socio-demographic
and associated comorbidities distribution between the two groups. Significant differences were
noted between the groups at baseline, with more males, ages less than 65 years in the HCQ
group. There were no significant differences between both groups in terms of overall comorbid
conditions except for chronic lung diseases and hypertension with higher percentages among

the SC group compared to the HCQ group (1.1% and 9.2% versus 0.4% and 7.2% respectively,
p-value <0.05). In terms of other administered medications, there was no difference between
the two groups in receipt of antibiotics at any point during the study period and follow up;
however, the SC group had a higher frequency of receiving steroids after hospitalisation
compared to the HCQ group (1.6% vs 0.2%, p-value <0.001).
Per the prespecified inclusion criteria, all patients who were included in the analysis have
presented with mild to moderate symptoms concerning for possible COVID-19. Almost all the
presenting symptoms were seen in higher percentages among the patients who ended up
receiving HCQ therapy compared to the SC alone, most notably: fever (83.91% vs 66.27%),
headache (49.78% vs 37.41%), cough (44.54% vs 35.41%), and myalgia (43.65% vs 33.94%)
(Figure.2).
The overall hospitalisation rate from disease progression in the study population was 14.2%
(N= 788) with significant fewer hospital admissions in the HCQ group compared to the SC
(171 (9.36%) vs 617 (16.6%), p-value <0.001). This corresponded to a relative risk reduction
in hospital admission of 43% among patients who received HCQ compared to the SC
(Table.2). The rate of ICU admissions and mortality rate were also lower in the HCQ compared
to the SC (0.77 vs 1.5 (p-value 0.022), and 0.39 vs 1.45 (p-value <0.001), respectively). The
primary and secondary outcomes of interest were verified with national mortality data and local
hospitalisation and mortality registries for all the COVID-19 symptomatic patients at
presentation (N= 7,892), and no outcomes were noted in the population which were lost to
follow up.
The multivariate logistic regression model shows a significant decrease in the odds of
hospitalisation in mild-moderately symptomatic COVID-19 positive patients who received
HCQ compared to SC alone, even after adjusting for potential baseline confounders such as
age, gender, and major comorbidities (adjusted OR 0.57 [95% CI 0.47-0.69], p-value <0.001)
(Table.3). The composite outcome of ICU admission and/or death was also lower for the HCQ
group compared to the SC group controlling for the same prespecified confounders (adjusted
OR 0.55 [95% CI 0.34-0.91], p-value 0.019). Table.4 shows the full multivariable logistic
regression model.
DISCUSSION
Our study is a large observational nationwide cohort of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients
who presented with mild and moderate symptoms to ambulatory fever clinics and were
managed according to a national management guideline which included the prescription of

HCQ at an early stage of the disease (25). We describe what happened in real-world clinical
practice where the decision to start HCQ therapy was based on the physician risk assessment
and the shared decision with the patient which allows assessing the benefit of such intervention
if it to be deployed on a population level. Despite the seen differences in the baseline
characteristics between the patients who received HCQ and those who received the SC alone,
the multivariate logistic regression model that controls for patient-specific prespecified
potential confounders shows a lower odds of adverse clinical outcomes, namely, hospitalisation
and ICU admission and/or mortality within 28-days of the presentation by 43% and 45%
respectively. The decision to start treatment did not differentiate between a specific symptom
or combination of symptoms and many patients presented with a group of symptoms thus given
the dependent nature of this variable; it was not included in the final multivariable model. As
the study protocol did not interfere with the acute care management of the study participants
who were hospitalised, it is reasonable to believe that ICU admission criteria would vary
between different hospital settings. Nonetheless, there was a trend towards lower ICU
admissions in the HCQ group. As the mortality rate in Saudi Arabia is considered low
compared to other nations (26, 27), to ensure the stability of the multivariate logistic model,
the mortality outcome was looked at as a composite of ICU admissions and/or mortality which
reached clinical significance while controlling for the prespecified confounders favouring the
effect of early intervention with HCQ.
Per the national ambulatory fever clinic program, at the specified study period, steroid therapy
was not advised for the sake of COVID-19 infection per se and was mainly prescribed as
indicated, if any. The fact that the receipt of steroid after hospitalisation was significantly
higher at the SC group is reassuring that the observed result represents the effect of the early
intervention with HCQ rather than the possible confounding effect of early steroid therapy,
however, since complete data about steroid prescription at presentation is lacking, this cannot
be firmly concluded. Finally, the safety of HCQ therapy in our cohort is described in detail
elsewhere, and it was shown to be a tolerable medication with minimum side effects (data
submitted for publication by Mohana et al.).
The previously published observational studies which failed to translate the in-vitro
mechanistic benefit of HCQ on clinical outcomes mainly introduced the therapy on hospitalised
patients (17-21). However, recent large cohort studies showed significantly improved
outcomes in patients who received HCQ early during hospitalisation (4,15). This spiked the
interest in testing the effect of early administration of HCQ therapy during the initial viral

replication phase prior to the progression to the hyperimmune response phase owing to its
variable antiviral properties (28). While an Italian multicentre, open-label, randomised
controlled trial did not show benefit of early administration of HCQ therapy to mildly
symptomatic young adults (29), other retrospective studies showed a promising benefit of early
HCQ treatment in modifying the overall outcome of COVID-19 whether or not it was
associated with azithromycin (30,31). Our study further supports these later findings and
suggests a possible benefit of this early intervention in preventing adverse clinical outcomes
on a population level.
Although our study included a large cohort of symptomatic COVID-19 participants, we
acknowledge that it has several limitations. The population represented in the dataset analysed
is relatively young with a limited number of patients who were above the age of 65 years based
on the cautionary measure taken by the national ambulatory fever clinic program. Although the
multivariable model adjusts for this age group, given the small numbers of patients in this
stratum, we caution from generalising the results to this age-group. Furthermore, the study took
place in all regions of the Kingdom during the pandemic, which imposed some logistic
challenges leading to losing the follow up of many patients in both treatment groups. To
overcome this anticipated challenge, the study protocol was designed with an additional
verification process to ensure capturing all hard outcome data from reliable national registries.
As this verification process was non-differential to the initial treatment group allocation, and
the fact that the sample size of the cohort is considered large, we believe that the overall results
are valid.
CONCLUSION
Although our study population were young and with a relatively low incidence of comorbidities
in both treatment groups, early intervention HCQ-based therapy in an ambulatory setting in
mild to moderate COVID-19 patients was associated with lower odds of hospitalisation and
ICU admission and/or death. Additional large randomised controlled trials are recommended
to further support this conclusion, particularly in older populations.
