Abstract

15

Objective: Poor housing conditions have been linked with worse health outcomes and infectious spread

16

in communities but its relationship with incidence and mortality of COVID-19 is unknown. Therefore, we

17

undertook this study to determine the association between poor housing condition and COVID-19

18

incidence and mortality in US counties.

19

Methods: We conducted cross-sectional analysis of county-level data from the US Centers for Disease

20

Control, US Census Bureau and John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center for 3141 US counties. The

21

exposure of interest was percentage of households with poor housing conditions (one or more of:

22

overcrowding, high housing cost, incomplete kitchen facilities, or incomplete plumbing facilities).

23

Outcomes were incidence rate ratios (IRR) and mortality rate ratios (MRR) of COVID-19 across US

24

counties through 4/21/2020. Multilevel generalized linear modeling was utilized with adjustment for

25

population density and county characteristics including demographics, income, education, prevalence of

26

medical comorbidities, access to healthcare insurance and emergency rooms, and state-level COVID-19

27

test density.

28

Results: Across 3135 US counties, the mean percentage of households with poor housing conditions was

29

14.2% (range 2.7% to 60.2%). The mean (SD) incidence and mortality of COVID-19 were 255.68

30

(2877.03) cases and 13.90 (272.22) deaths per county, respectively. In the fully adjusted models, with

31

each 5% increase in percent households with poor housing conditions, there was a 50% higher risk of

32

COVID-19 incidence (IRR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.38 – 1.62) and a 42% higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (MRR

33

1.42, 95% CI: 1.25 – 1.61). Results remained similar using earlier timepoints (3/31/2020 and 4/10/2020).

34

Conclusions and Relevance: Counties with a higher percentage of households with poor housing had

35

higher incidence of, and mortality associated with, COVID-19. These findings suggest targeted health

Introduction

39

Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly evolving pandemic caused by the novel enveloped RNA

40

beta-coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)(1). As of April 26,

41

2020, SARS-COV-2 has infected over 2 million people worldwide and led to >200k deaths . The

42

infectivity potential of SARS-CoV-2 is a function of its high basic reproductive number (R ) which has

43

been estimated to be from 2.2 to as high as 5.7, as compared to R of 1.3 for influenza virus(3-5). Given

44

the high infectivity and lack of a vaccine, one of the important mitigation strategies employed

45

worldwide in order to decrease the rate of spread and ‘flatten’ the infection curve has been social and

46

physical distancing(3, 6). However, physical distancing can be compromised if the living environment for

47

various reasons, such as poor housing conditions, prevents the individuals to stay isolated. Problems

48

associated with poor housing include overcrowding, high housing cost, lack of kitchen facilities or lack of

49

plumbing facilities. Given the overcrowding and the inherent need to utilize communal facilities

50

(bathrooms or kitchens), physical distancing would likely be compromised in the households

51

experiencing poor housing conditions. Poor housing conditions have already been linked to an increased

52

spread of respiratory infections(7). Furthermore, there is robust literature linking poor housing

53

conditions to worse health outcomes(8-11). Given that a common mechanism of SARS-CoV-2

54

transmission is through respiratory aerosols and droplet contact, poor housing conditions can

55

potentially facilitate the spread of the infection(12). Since the relationship between poor housing

56

conditions and COVID-19 outcomes are currently unknown, we undertook a study to test the hypothesis

57

that the percentage of households with poor housing conditions in US counties are associated with

58

higher incidence and mortality of COVID-19 across 3135 counties in the United States (US).

Materials and Methods

60

We conducted a cross sectional ecological analysis of the 3141 US counties using publicly available data

61

relating poor housing conditions with COVID-19 outcomes. Counties with missing data for poor housing

62

condition (n=6) were excluded yielding a sample size of 3135 US counties. These counties were Prince of

63

Wales-Outer Ketchikan, Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon, Wrangell-Petersburg and Kusilvak from Alaska,

64

Bedford City from Virginia and Oglala Lakota from South Dakota. Counties in US territories (American

65

Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Island, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands) were not included in our

66

analysis. Since there is no individual identifying information, the data were in aggregate by county, and

67

publicly available from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), US census Bureau and John Hopkins

68

Coronavirus Resource Center,(2) the protocol received exemption from the Providence Veterans Affairs

69

Medical Center Institutional Review Board(2, 13, 14).

70

Exposure: The exposure of interest was the percentage of households in a county with poor housing

71

conditions which has been published as percentage of households with severe housing problems (2010

72

– 2014) by the CDC(13). These households were identified as having any of the four problems: 1)

73

overcrowding, 2) high housing cost burden, 3) incomplete kitchen facilities, and 4) incomplete plumbing

74

facilities. In further breakdown, overcrowding is defined as more than one person per room, high

75

housing cost as more than 50% of the monthly household income allocated towards housing cost

76

(including utilities), incomplete kitchen facilities as lacking a sink with running water, stove or range, or a

77

refrigerator, and incomplete plumbing facilities as lacking of hot and cold piped water, a flush toilet, or a

78

bathtub/shower(15). To facilitate interpretation, we studied the poor housing conditions as a

79

continuous variable by units of 5% increase in households with poor housing conditions, which is

80

roughly equivalent to the standard deviation (SD) of the variable. Additionally, we also categorized the

81

counties according to approximate quartiles based on percentage of households with poor housing

82

conditions (rounded values were used as cut off).

83

Outcome: The outcomes of interest were incident COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths per county. We

84

obtained the COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource

85

Center, where it has been published for “public health, educational, and academic research

86

purposes.”(2) We obtained the cumulative data for three dates of 10-day intervals: March 31 , April

87

10 and April 21 , which allowed us to test the robustness of our findings across three temporal cross

88

sections of the reported data. April 21 data were utilized as the main analysis.

89

Covariates: We obtained data on county level variables related to COVID-19 spread and outcomes based

90

on literature. The data regarding total population (2010) and population density (population per square

91

miles of land area of a county) were obtained to account for the exposure pool(13). In order to account

92

for socioeconomic disparity, data on median household income of a county (2016) and percentage of

93

residents without a high school diploma (2013-2017) were included(13).

94

County demographic data was collected because male sex, older age and percent of racial minority have

95

been linked to a higher risk of, and mortality in, COVID-19(13, 16-18). This included percentage of male

96

residents (2010), median age (2010), and percentage of white, black, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, Native

97

Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; and American Indian or Alaska Native residents (2013 – 2017)(13).

98

From the very initial reports, COVID-19 was seen to drastically effect individuals with a heavier burden

99

of comorbidities(16, 17). We therefore collected data for percentage of residents diagnosed with

st

th

st

st

100

diabetes and those with obesity (2015)(13). Furthermore, Medicare hospitalization data for:

101

hypertension, ischemic stroke, myocardial ischemia, heart failure and dysrhythmia (2014 – 2016) were

102

obtained as a surrogate for cardiovascular disease burden in the county(13).

103

The morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 has been linked to respiratory failure(19). We

104

therefore collected variables that affect respiratory health: annual concentration of particulate matter

105

2.5 µ (pm2.5) (2014) and percentage of residents who are current smokers (2017)(13).

106

We accounted for the percentage of adults without health insurance under 65 years (2016) and number

107

of hospitals with emergency rooms (ER) (2016) in each county, as surrogates of access to care. The

108

number of hospitals may also influence the number of cases detected in the county. Furthermore, we

109

obtained the total number of tests conducted per state (cumulative up to April 21 ) and calculated the

110

ratio of tests to the total population of the state (test density)(20).

111

Statistical Analysis: County covariates were described as mean ± SD and range for continuous variables

112

and as number (%) for categorical variables. Linear regression was used to assess linear trend of the

113

county covariates across the four quartiles.

114

We graphed the correlation between poor housing and number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19

115

deaths. Given non-normal distribution, we used log transformation (log x +1) of the exposure and

116

outcome variables for the scatter plot and calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficient.

117

We utilized generalized linear multilevel models with a negative binomial distribution family and a log

118

link function to study the association between the relative risk of each 5% change in households with

119

poor housing conditions and the incidence (first analysis) and mortality (second analysis) of COVID-19,

120

with total population of a county as denominator. To account for clustering effect due to policy, social

121

and behavioral similarities across counties within the same state, we applied a random intercept for the

122

state. The covariance matrix was specified as unstructured. We adjusted for different categories of

123

variables in the regression model in a stepwise fashion: 1) population density and test density, 2)

124

demographics (% male, median age ,% white), 3) socioeconomic status (median household income, %

125

residents with lack of high school education), 4) respiratory exposure (annual ambient PM2.5, % current

126

smokers), 5) prevalence of comorbidities (% diagnosed with diabetes, % diagnosed with obesity), 6)

127

Medicare hospitalization rates (hypertension, ischemic stroke, myocardial ischemia, heart failure,

128

dysrhythmia), and 7) Access to healthcare (% adults without health insurance under 65 years and

129

number of hospitals with ER). The fully adjusted model included all the aforementioned variables. We

130

reported incidence rate ratios (IRR) and mortality rate ratios (MRR), respectively, which are

131

interpretable as the relative increase in incidence and mortality for COVID19, respectively, for each 5%

132

increase in households with poor housing conditions.

133

We conducted several sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. 1) In lieu of percent

134

white population in a county, we replaced it with the percent breakdown of the minority population:

135

black, Hispanic or Latino, Asian or Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander and American Indian or Alaska

136

Native residents per county in the fully adjusted model. 2) Quartile Analysis – we also studied quartiles

137

of percent households with poor housing conditions. We tested the quartiles in the fully adjusted model

138

as an ordinal variable (i.e. linear effect across quartiles) and as categorical (dummy) variables (using 1

139

quartile as referent). 3) Temporal Analysis – Since the main analysis is using the most recent data (April

140

21 , 2020), we repeated our analyses in two earlier time points for COVID-19 incidence and mortality as

141

outcomes, on March 31 and April 10 , to account for and understand temporal changes, if any, in this

142

association.

143

A two-sided p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted in Stata

144

SE statistical software (Stata Corp, Texas, v. 15.0).

Results

146

Across 3135 US counties, the mean (range) percentage of households with poor housing conditions was

147

14.2% (2.7% to 60.2%). The modified quartiles of percentage of households with poor housing

148

conditions were 2.7% to 11% (Quartile1), 11.1% to 14.0% (Quartile2), 14.1% to 17.0% (Quartile3) and

149

17.1% to 60.2% (Quartile4). Till April 21 , there were a total of 144190 confirmed COVID-19 cases

150

assigned to these 3135 US counties and 14887 COVID-19 deaths. The mean (SD) incidence and mortality

151

of COVID-19 were 255.68 (2877.03) cases and 13.90 (272.22) deaths per county, respectively. Table 1

The mean number of COVID-19 cases and deaths for all time points, March 31st, April 10th and April 21st

155

increased across increasing quartiles of percentage of households with poor housing conditions (all p’s

156

<0.001). Similarly, increasing quartiles of percent households with poor housing conditions were

157

associated with higher county population, population density, percentage of minority residents ,

158

percentage of residents without high school diploma, prevalence of diabetes, Medicare hospitalization

159

rates for hypertension, ischemic stroke, heart failure and dysrhythmia, percentage of current smokers,

160

annual PM2.5 levels, percentage of adults <65 years without health insurance and number of hospitals

161

with ER facilities (all p’s <0.001). Conversely, a decrease in the median household income and

162

prevalence of obesity was observed across increasing quartiles of percent households with poor housing

163

conditions (both p’s <0.001).

164

There was a moderately strong correlation between the log-transformed percentage of households with

165

poor housing conditions and log-transformed number of COVID-19 cases (r = 0.44, p <0.001) and COVID-

166

19 deaths (r = 0.47, p<0.001) across US counties (Figure 1).

Conditions across 3135 US counties.

169

Using the COVID-19 data from April 21st, we found that for each 5% increase in poor housing condition

170

per county, there is a 59% increase in the relative risk of COVID-19 incidence (IRR 1.59, 95% confidence

171

interval [CI]: 1.49-1.70) (Table 2). The association was only slightly attenuated after adjustment for an

172

extensive list of county covariates (Table 2). The IRR for the fully adjusted model (Model VIII) was 1.50

173

(95% CI: 1.38 – 1.62) (Table 2). Secondary analyses categorizing the exposure into quartiles (Figure 2a)

174

or using data from March 31st and April 10th yielded comparable results (Table 2).

Discussion

186

To our knowledge, this is the first nationwide study to investigate county level association of COVID-19

187

incidence and mortality with percentage of households facing poor housing conditions in the US. Our

188

study showed that with each 5% increase in percent households with poor housing conditions, there

189

was a 50% higher risk of COVID-19 incidence and a 42% higher risk of COVID-19 mortality across US

190

counties. Findings remained similar in three different time points and after accounting for county-level

191

population density and state test density, demographics, socioeconomic status, prevalence of

192

comorbidities, respiratory exposure, lack of health insurance and number of ER facilities.

193
194

Of the four issues categorized under poor housing conditions, overcrowding offers the most direct

195

explanation for the higher incidence and mortality of COVID-19. Overcrowding has been associated with

196

spread of respiratory illnesses like tuberculosis and influenza which have aerosol and droplet

197

transmissions, both of which are potential modes of transmission for COVID-19(7, 12, 21-23). The World

198

Health Organization (WHO) published housing and health guidelines in 2018 identifying poor housing

199

related environmental risk factors including overcrowding, air and water quality and lack of access to

200

adequate plumbing and sanitation, as factors contributing to the burden of infectious diseases including

201

airborne respiratory illnesses(24). The 2003 spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)

202

epidemic in Hong Kong was worst in the Amoy Garden estate which was overcrowded and had

203

significant plumbing and sanitation problems(25). An initial study from China investigating the initial

204

COVID-19 outbreaks also showed that 79.9% of outbreaks occurred indoors, almost all in apartment

205

settings(26). Evidence from the Influenza epidemic of 1918 showed not only increased spread but also

206

increased severity of the disease as a result of overcrowding(27). Overcrowding associated with a more

207

severe infectious disease process may offer a potential explanation of the higher mortality associated

208

with poor housing, as overcrowding leads to repeated exposure and potentially a higher viral inoculum.

209

High viral load has been linked to worse COVID-19 clinical outcomes(28-30).

210
211

Another feature of poor housing conditions is high cost burden, with more than 50% of the household

212

income going towards housing cost(15). Prior studies have shown an association between high housing

213

costs and delays in seeking healthcare(8, 31). Our study showed that counties with the highest

214

percentage of residents with poor housing conditions also had the lowest median household income

215

and highest percentage of residents without a high school diploma. There are several news reports

216

indicating that minimum wage workers have found it difficult to follow the stay-at-home guidelines, due

217

to a lack of economic resources and being part of essential work force that is mostly an exception to

218

stay-at-home guidelines(32-34). However, an important feature of our study is that although linked to

219

economic status, the associations between poor housing conditions and COVID-19 incidence, and

220

mortality, were independent of the racial composition, median household income, lack of education and

221

lack of health insurance, as the relative risk was only mildly changed and remained highly significant

222

after adjusting for these factors.

223
224

A lack of appropriate plumbing and kitchen facilities is also part of poor housing conditions. Availability

225

of appropriate plumbing facilities and in-home clean water has been linked to a decline in infectious

226

disease including lower respiratory tract infections(24, 35). Lack of appropriate facilities interferes with

227

the ability to practice good hand hygiene. Furthermore, lack of these facilities would require the

228

residents to use communal facilities, thereby increasing social contact. It is important to note that SARS-

229

CoV-2 is detectable for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel materials, whereas influenza is

18

230

detectable for 24-48 hrs(36, 37). This poses another public health risk for transmission to other

231

individuals sharing a crowded space, in the absence of meticulous hygiene.

232
233

Our findings have health policy implications as they identify a particularly vulnerable population to be at

234

heightened risk and also the potential pathways for public health interventions during the current

235

COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our study adds to a robust body of evidence for other disease

236

processes, which has shown that inadequate housing is a public health hazard especially in relation to

237

infectious diseases and highlights the importance of finding short (e.g. better access to clean water and

238

bathrooms) and long-term (e.g. overcrowding, cost) solutions to problems surrounding poor housing to

239

help contain or mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Health education via print or social media targeted at

240

the population at risk to improve awareness of preventative measures and hygiene, establishment of

241

hygiene protocols and increased availability of mobile bathrooms and cleaning supplies at communal

242

facilities can be considered to help mitigate the COVID-19 spread(38, 39).

243
244

The strength of this study is that this is a nationwide report of 3135 counties across US, which allows for

245

a large sample size and generalizability of our findings. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first

246

study to establish an association between the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 and poor housing

247

conditions. The limitations of the study also merit consideration. First, the county-level covariate data

248

utilized were from earlier time period, and hence may have weakened the strength of the associations.

249

However, we utilized the most updated results publicly available. Furthermore, the assumption that

250

county age structure and ethnic composition does not quickly change over the span of several years is

251

the current approach shared by the US Census methodology (every 10 years). However, the consistent

252

results after accounting for extensive list of covariates and various sensitivity analyses, support the

253

robustness of the findings. Due to limitations of the data, we could not separate the distinct elements

254

(e.g. overcrowding, cost, plumbing, kitchen) that comprised poor housing for better understanding of

255

the problem and targeting of policies. This is also a cross-sectional ecological analysis and does not lend

256

itself to causal inference. Finally, despite careful adjustments and inclusion of covariates, residual

257

confounding cannot be excluded.

Conclusion

259

In a nationwide analysis of US county-level data, counties with a higher percentage of households with

260

poor housing had higher incidence of, and mortality associated with, COVID-19. These findings suggest

261

targeted health policies to support individuals living in poor housing conditions should be considered in

262

further efforts to mitigate adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19.

Figure 1a-b: Scatter plot of COVID-19 Cases & Deaths by percentage of Households with Poor Housing Conditions across 3135 US counties

Note: Quartile 1 is referent. Models adjusted for 1) population density and test density, 2) demographics (% male, median age ,% white), 3)
socioeconomic status (median household income, % residents with lack of high school education), 4) respiratory exposure (annual ambient
PM2.5, % current smokers), 5) prevalence of comorbidities (% diagnosed with diabetes, % diagnosed with obesity), 6) Medicare hospitalization
rates (hypertension, ischemic stroke, myocardial ischemia, heart failure, dysrhythmia), and 7) Access to healthcare (%adults without health
insurance under 65 years and number of hospitals with ER).

The quartiles were: Quartile1: 2.7% to 11%, Quartile2: 11.1% to 14.0%, Quartile3: 14.1% to 17.0% and Quartile4: 17.1% to 60.2%

2a. Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) with 95% CI for COVID-19 cases across quartiles of percent households with poor housing conditions.
2b. Mortality Rate Ratio (MRR) with 95% CI for COVID-19 deaths across quartiles of percent households with poor housing conditions.
