ABSTRACT
Background: Thrombotic complications occur at high rates in hospitalized patients with
COVID-19, yet the impact of intensive antithrombotic therapy on mortality is uncertain.

Research Question: How does in-hospital mortality compare with intermediate- versus
prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, and separately with in-hospital aspirin versus no
antiplatelet therapy, in treatment of COVID-19?

Study Design and Methods: Using data from 2785 hospitalized adult COVID-19
patients, we established two separate, nested cohorts of patients (1) who received
intermediate- or prophylactic-dose anticoagulation (“anticoagulation cohort”, N = 1624),
or (2) who were not on home antiplatelet therapy and received either in-hospital aspirin
or no antiplatelet therapy (“aspirin cohort”, N = 1956). Propensity score matching
utilizing various markers of illness severity and other patient-specific covariates yielded
treatment groups with well-balanced covariates in each cohort. The primary outcome
was cumulative incidence of in-hospital death.

Results: Among propensity score-matched patients in the anticoagulation cohort (N =
382), in a multivariable regression model, intermediate- compared to prophylactic-dose
anticoagulation was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of inhospital death (hazard ratio 0.518 [0.308-0.872]). Among propensity-score matched
patients in the aspirin cohort (N = 638), in a multivariable regression model, in-hospital
aspirin compared to no antiplatelet therapy was associated with a significantly lower

cumulative incidence of in-hospital death (hazard ratio 0.522 [0.336-0.812]).

Interpretation: In this propensity score-matched, observational study of COVID-19,
intermediate-dose anticoagulation and aspirin were each associated with a lower
cumulative incidence of in-hospital death.

INTRODUCTION
Thrombosis is among the most devastating complications of COVID-19. In multiple
studies, venous thromboembolism (VTE), arterial thrombosis, and microvascular
thrombosis have all been described.1-6 High VTE rates have been reported in critically ill
COVID-19 patients despite the use of prophylactic anticoagulation.1,6,7 The development
of pulmonary microvascular thrombosis may be central to the pathogenesis of COVID19 in the lungs.5 An elevated D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin clots, is one of the
strongest predictors of mortality from COVID-19.8,9

A common global practice has been to administer escalated intensities of antithrombotic
therapy beyond standard prophylactic-dose anticoagulation in hospitalized COVID-19
patients.10-12 To date, there has been little evidence to support this practice.13,14 Some
retrospective studies have observed lower mortality rates with therapeutic-dose
anticoagulation compared to either prophylactic-dose anticoagulation or no
anticoagulation, while others comparing therapeutic- and prophylactic-dose
anticoagulation have found no mortality difference.15-22 Recent findings from the ACTIV
randomized controlled trial suggested futility of therapeutic- compared to prophylacticdose anticoagulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients, leading to a pausing of
enrollment of critically ill patients in that trial. To date, however, no large-scale study has
compared the effects of intermediate- versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulation. Some
investigators have also proposed a potential role for aspirin and other antiplatelet
therapies in light of the high burden of microvascular thrombosis and emerging models
of immunothrombosis in COVID-19.5,23,24 One retrospective study reported improved

outcomes with aspirin therapy but did not account for disease severity between
treatment groups, making its conclusions difficult to interpret.25

A major limitation in retrospective studies is bias in the likelihood of patients to receive
the treatments being studied. In unadjusted observational studies, disease severity is a
confounding factor affecting treatment decisions and outcomes, often precluding
accurate analysis of potential treatment effects. To address this, propensity score
matching for disease severity and other variables has been utilized in some
observational studies, leading to findings compatible with those obtained from
randomized controlled trials.26,27 The use of propensity score matching in a few
landmark observational studies in COVID-19 has yielded key insights about potential
treatment effects by enabling treatment groups with balanced covariates to be reliably
compared.28,29

We sought to examine the impact of intermediate-dose anticoagulation and aspirin on
in-hospital mortality in COVID-19. To account for variations in treatment, we utilized
propensity score matching and multivariable regression analysis incorporating markers
of disease severity and other clinical covariates. One scoring system for assessing
disease severity in use at many hospitals is the Rothman Index (RI), a composite score
of 26 distinct clinical, laboratory, and nursing variables, which has been shown to have
prognostic value in some surgical and critical care studies, although its utility in COVID19 is presently unknown.30-32 We hypothesized that the RI might be a useful tool for
evaluating disease severity in COVID-19, both for clinical care and for the purposes of

propensity score matching. In this observational study, we first analyzed a large,
multisite cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients by multivariable regression analysis
and found a novel prognostic role for the admission RI in predicting in-hospital mortality.
Then, incorporating the RI and other measures of illness severity, we performed
propensity score matching and multivariable regression analyses and observed
significant reductions in in-hospital mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients
treated with intermediate-dose anticoagulation or aspirin.

METHODS
Patients, data collection, and variables
Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for this study; an approved Data Use
Agreement between institutions permitted analysis. From March through June 2020, our
hospital’s Joint Data Analytics Team (JDAT) identified 4150 hospital encounters in the
Yale New Haven Health System with a diagnosis of COVID-19 established via a
nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test (Supplementary Table 1). Patients were
excluded if they were < 18 years of age (N = 35), had multiple inpatient hospital
encounters due to transfer between hospitals or readmission (N = 1247; all such
encounters were excluded in these cases), or had missing data (N = 83), yielding an
overall study cohort size of 2785 unique patients.

Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from each patient’s medical
record by JDAT. Established population health registries were used to identify patients

with diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart
failure (CHF) (Supplementary Table 2). Inclusion into a population health registry
required an encounter diagnosis of the referenced disease state and at least a single,
non-abstract patient encounter within the health system in the preceding three years; in
addition, either the patient problem list was required to contain the referenced
diagnosis, or the patient had to have a minimum of two face-to-face encounters within
the previous 12 months. For disease states without established population health
registries, ICD-10 codes were used. We defined cardiovascular disease as any of the
following: hypertension, diabetes, CAD, myocardial infarction, CHF, atrial fibrillation,
stroke, or transient ischemic attack. We categorized body mass index (BMI) according
to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control definitions. We categorized the first RI on
admission into four quartiles (quartile 1, RI -33 to 43; quartile 2, RI 42 to 65; quartile 3,
RI 66 to 79; quartile 4, RI 80 to 99), with the lowest and highest quartiles representing
patients with the greatest and least illness severities, respectively.

Definitions of anticoagulation intensity
For our analysis, each patient was assigned to one anticoagulant group using the
following criteria. First, the maximum dose of enoxaparin or heparin received during
each patient’s admission was determined. Patients who received a maximum
enoxaparin dose of 30-40 mg at a weight-adjusted concentration of < 0.7 mg/kg every
24 hours, enoxaparin 30-40 mg at a weight-adjusted concentration of < 0.4 mg/kg every
12 hours, subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (UFH) 5000 units up to three times per
day, or subcutaneous UFH 5000 or 7500 units up to three times per day with a BMI ≥ 40

kg/m2, and who did not receive any other type of documented anticoagulant during their
hospitalization, were categorized as prophylactic-dose anticoagulation. Patients who
received a maximum enoxaparin dose of ≥ 0.4 and < 0.7 mg/kg every 12 hours or
subcutaneous UFH 7500 U at any frequency with a BMI < 40 kg/m2, and who did not
receive any other type of anticoagulant during their hospitalization, were categorized as
intermediate-dose anticoagulation. Patients who received a maximum enoxaparin dose

≥ 0.7 mg/kg every 12 hours, enoxaparin ≥ 0.7 mg/kg every 24 hours with creatinine
clearance < 30 mL/min, enoxaparin ≥ 1.4 mg/kg every 24 hours, intravenous UFH, or
intravenous bivalirudin were categorized as therapeutic-dose anticoagulation. Patients
who received any other dose of enoxaparin and who did not receive a direct oral
anticoagulant (DOAC) or any other therapeutic-dose anticoagulant were categorized as
“Alternative enoxaparin dose”. Patients who received a DOAC and no other type of
therapeutic-dose anticoagulation were categorized as “DOAC”. All other patients were
categorized as “No documented anticoagulation”. Manual chart review was performed in
cases with ambiguous data regarding anticoagulation dosing.

Statistical analyses
The primary outcome in this study was in-hospital death, measured as cumulative
incidence of in-hospital death, with cumulative incidence of hospital discharge as a
competing risk. Univariable and multivariable regression modeling of subdistribution
hazard functions for the primary outcome was performed in all cohorts; we also reported
hazard ratios (HR) from competing risks regression.33 Variables incorporated into the
modeling included demographic factors, medical history, and clinical and laboratory

features reflecting disease severity. Propensity score matching was performed on the
different cohorts to achieve balance in covariates between patients treated with
intermediate- versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulation in the anticoagulation cohort,
and separately between patients treated with in-hospital aspirin versus no antiplatelet
therapy in the aspirin cohort. Cumulative incidence curves were estimated for
nonparametric visualization of in-hospital death and discharge events and tested using
Gray’s test in the propensity score-matched anticoagulation and aspirin cohorts34; for
clarity, only curves for in-hospital death are displayed in the figures.

Propensity scores were calculated within each cohort using multivariable logistic
regression models. Propensity scores included covariates that may affect both the
likelihood of patients to receive the treatment of interest and the outcome of interest,
and that were unbalanced between treatment groups before matching. These variables
included a number of patient characteristics as well as markers of disease severity.
Matching based on propensity scores incorporating different sets of covariates was
performed using a 1:1 nearest-neighbor algorithm, either with a caliper width of 0.25
(anticoagulation cohort) or without a caliper (aspirin cohort). In each analysis, the
approach that yielded the best-matched cohort was identified based on the most
balanced distribution of propensity scores and the best balance in individual covariates
between the two treatment groups.

In March 2020, our hospital system established antithrombotic guidelines for
management of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Table 1). These guidelines
recommended empiric prophylactic- or intermediate-dose anticoagulation in all
hospitalized COVID-19 patients based on their D-dimer level, which was measured
once or twice daily throughout each patient’s hospital admission; or therapeutic-dose
anticoagulation based on clinical suspicion for VTE. Ultimate decisions about
anticoagulation dosing were left to the discretion of providers based on their
assessments of individual patients.

In the initial version of the guidelines, hospitalized COVID-19 patients with D-dimer < 10
mg/L fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) were recommended for prophylactic-dose
anticoagulation, while patients with D-dimer > 10 mg/L FEU were recommended for
intermediate-dose anticoagulation. On April 13, 2020, following discussions with other
peer institutions about their anticoagulation practices, the D-dimer threshold for
intermediate-dose anticoagulation in our health system’s guidelines was decreased to 5
mg/L FEU.

Early in the pandemic, studies performed at our institution and others supported a role
for endotheliopathy and platelet activation in the development of severe COVID-19.35,36
Based on this, during the early phases of the pandemic, a number of providers at our
institution routinely administered aspirin to COVID-19 patients who were critically ill. On
May 18, 2020, aspirin 81 mg daily was added to our hospital system’s treatment
guidelines as a recommendation for all hospitalized patients regardless of critical illness.

The overall study cohort consisted of 2785 patients (Supplementary Table 3). Half of
patients were male (50.1%; N = 1396). The majority were over 60 years old (58.4%; N =
1627). Among all patients, 13.8% (N = 383) died in the hospital; 83.7% (N = 2330) were
discharged alive, while 2.6% (N = 72) remained in the hospital at the time of data
abstraction. We sought to identify variables significantly associated with disease
severity in COVID-19 for use in propensity score matching. To achieve this, we
performed multivariable analyses of the overall study cohort, examining associations of
in-hospital death with different variables (Table 2). We observed a novel association of
low admission RI quartile with increased cumulative incidence of in-hospital death in a
model accounting for the competing risk of hospital discharge. Age > 60, male sex,
obesity, and the maximum D-dimer level during hospitalization (DDmax) were also
significantly associated with in-hospital death, in keeping with prior studies.37,38

Intermediate- versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulation
To study the potential impact of intermediate- versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulation,
we created the “anticoagulation cohort”, a nested cohort of patients from the overall
study cohort who were anticoagulated with either a maximum of prophylactic-dose
enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin, or a maximum of intermediate-dose enoxaparin
or unfractionated heparin (N = 1624). We then performed propensity score matching on
patients in the anticoagulation cohort using a number of variables, including age, body
mass index (BMI), DDmax, admission RI score, male sex, and African-American race
(Supplementary Figure 1). Among all the different combinations of variables tested in

patients in the anticoagulation cohort, propensity score matching with age, BMI,
DDmax, admission RI score, and African-American race achieved the most balanced
distribution of covariates between patients treated with prophylactic- compared to
intermediate-dose anticoagulation (Supplementary Table 4).

The final propensity score-matched group of 382 patients from the anticoagulation
cohort was well-balanced between patients who received prophylactic- versus
intermediate-dose anticoagulation with respect to all variables analyzed except for
DDmax, which was higher in patients who received intermediate-dose anticoagulation,
reflecting our hospital’s treatment guidelines (Supplementary Table 4). Using this group
of propensity score-matched patients, we fit a competing risks multivariable regression
model adjusting for age, aspirin and antiplatelet therapy use, male sex, obesity,
cardiovascular disease, African-American race, DDmax, and admission RI. Treatment
with intermediate- compared to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation was associated with a
significantly lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death on multivariable regression
(HR 0.518 [0.308-0.872] (Table 3). Cumulative incidence curves also showed a
significant reduction in in-hospital death among propensity score-matched patients in
the anticoagulation cohort who were treated with intermediate- compared to
prophylactic-dose anticoagulation (Figure 1).

Aspirin versus no antiplatelet therapy
Next, we explored the effects of in-hospital aspirin use. For this analysis, we established
the “aspirin cohort”, a nested cohort of patients from the overall study cohort who were

not on home antiplatelet therapy prior to admission and received either aspirin or no
antiplatelet therapy during their hospitalization (N = 1956). Within the aspirin cohort, we
performed propensity score matching for age, DDmax, admission RI, and male sex,
which achieved the most balanced distribution of covariates between patients treated
with in-hospital aspirin compared to those who received no antiplatelet therapy
(Supplementary Figure 2; Supplementary Table 5).

Using this propensity score-matched group of 638 patients, we fit a competing risks
multivariable regresson model adjusting for age, anticoagulation other than prophylactic
dose, male sex, obesity, cardiovascular disease, African-American race, DDmax, and
admission RI; in addition, we included ICU admission as a covariate based on a
tendency of providers at our institution to administer aspirin preferentially to critically ill
patients earlier on in the pandemic, before aspirin was added onto our hospital’s
treatment guidelines. On multivariable analysis of propensity score-matched patients in
the aspirin cohort, the use of in-hospital aspirin was associated with a lower cumulative
incidence of in-hospital death (HR 0.522 [0.336-0.812]) (Table 4).

Separately, we also analyzed outcomes of patients in the aspirin cohort who were
admitted after May 18, the date on which our hospital system’s antithrombotic
guidelines added a recommendation to administer aspirin to all hospitalized COVID-19
patients (Table 1). For this analysis, we applied propensity score matching for age,
DDmax, and admission RI score, which together yielded the most balanced distribution
of covariates between aspirin- and non-aspirin-treated patients admitted after May 18,

among the different combination of variables tested (Supplementary Figure 3). The final
group of 140 propensity score-matched patients was well-balanced between aspirinand non-aspirin-treated patients with respect to all variables except BMI
(Supplementary Table 6). Using this group of propensity score-matched patients, we
then fit a competing risks multivariable regression model adjusting for age,
anticoagulation other than prophylactic dose, male sex, obesity, cardiovascular disease,
African-American race, DDmax, and admission RI. Once again, among patients
admitted after May 18, the use of in-hospital aspirin compared to no antiplatelet therapy
was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death on
multivariable regression (HR 0.036 [0.002-0.576] (Table 5). Cumulative incidence
curves showed a significant reduction in in-hospital death among propensity scorematched patients in the aspirin cohort admitted after May 18 who were treated with inhospital aspirin compared to those who did not receive any antiplatelet therapy (Figure
2).

DISCUSSION
In our large observational study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we report, for the
first time, a significantly lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death among patients
who received intermediate- compared to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, and,
separately, among patients who received in-hospital aspirin compared to those who
received no antiplatelet therapy. At present, consensus groups differ in their
recommendations regarding the use of escalated-intensity anticoagulation in COVID-19

patients who are critically ill, highlighting the uncertainty that exists with this practice.3941

Retrospective studies of therapeutic- compared to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation

have reported mixed effects on mortality, while only two small studies have examined
outcomes with intermediate- compared to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, largely
focusing on venous thromboembolism rates, again with conflicting results.7,15,16,18-22,42,43
More recently, the ACTIV randomized clinical trial showed futility of therapeuticcompared to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients, leading
to a pause in further recruitment of critically ill patients for that trial. Our analysis is the
first large-scale study to specifically examine intermediate- and prophylactic-dose
anticoagulation in COVID-19. In contrast to many other studies, we utilized propensity
score matching and multivariable regression analysis in order to diminish treatment
selection bias by generating treatment and control groups with well-balanced
covariates, thereby allowing for a more reliable comparison of potential treatment
effects.27 Our findings suggest that there may be a beneficial role for intermediate-dose
anticoagulation in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, although we await
the results of several randomized controlled trials to definitively address this question.

At present, no consensus guidelines are available regarding aspirin use in COVID-19,
reflecting a paucity of data in this regard. A biological rationale to support the use of
aspirin in COVID-19 may reside in the treatment of other microvascular thrombotic
diseases such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, where antiplatelet agents may
have a role.44 Recently, one other retrospective study reported improved in-hospital
mortality in COVID-19 patients who received aspirin within one week before or 24 hours

after admission.25 Despite drawing similar conclusions, our study adopted a more
rigorous methodological approach through the use of propensity score matching to
account for differences in illness severity among patients, enabling us to more
accurately compare different treatment effects. In addition, we excluded patients on
home aspirin in order to minimize confounding effects from underlying cardiovascular
disease.

Our analysis also reveals a novel role for the admission RI as a prognostic tool for
evaluating the risk of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19. The RI, which synthesizes
multiple clinical, laboratory, and nursing assessment variables into a single score, has
been shown to have predictive value for assessing mortality and readmission rates in
some critical care and surgical studies, although its applicability to COVID-19 has not
been previously tested.30-32 In our hospital system, the RI is calculated automatically by
our electronic health record system upon admission and hourly throughout a patient’s
hospitalization, rendering it readily accessible to enable its use in real-time clinical
decision-making.32 Additional studies are warranted to further explore the potential role
for the RI in assessing disease severity and guiding clinical interventions in COVID-19.

Our study has several limitations, beyond its retrospective nature. Overall provider
adherence to our institution’s COVID-19 treatment guidelines was subject to provider
preference, although many of the confounding factors that would have resulted from
such bias were accounted for through our use of propensity score matching and
multivariable regression analysis. Heterogeneity in the number of doses of intermediate-

dose anticoagulation or aspirin that each patient received during their hospitalization
may have biased our analysis against the detection of some significant associations by
including patients in the intervention group who received limited exposure to the
intervention. A possible improvement in clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients with
COVID-19 over time could have biased some of our findings, although in our analysis of
patients in the aspirin cohort admitted after May 18, a significant reduction in in-hospital
mortality with aspirin use was still observed despite the later, shortened timeframe of
the specific study population analyzed. We did not examine other COVID-19 therapies
that patients may have received and did not examine VTE rates, as only a small
percentage of patients in our hospital system underwent VTE-specific imaging in order
to limit excess healthcare worker exposure to COVID-19.

In summary, in our large, observational study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19,
using propensity score matching and multivariable regression analyses, we observed a
mortality benefit with intermediate- compared to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation and,
separately, with in-hospital aspirin compared to no antiplatelet therapy. Our findings
suggest that increased-intensity anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy may be
beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19. We await the results of several randomized
clinical trials to more definitively elucidate the impact of these therapies in COVID-19.

Multivariable regression analysis was performed within the overall study cohort to examine the
association of in-hospital death with covariates. Cumulative incidence of in-hospital death was
evaluated in a competing risks model with hospital discharge, and hazard ratios (HR) for inhospital death were reported. For the maximum D-dimer level during hospitalization (DDmax),
the hazard ratio represents the effect of an increase of one fibrinogen equivalent unit.

patients in the anticoagulation cohort, comparing intermediate- versus prophylactic-dose
anticoagulation. Patients were propensity score matched for age, maximum D-dimer level,
admission Rothman Index score, body mass index, and African-American race using a random
number seed and a caliper width of 0.25. P values from Gray’s test describe differences in
cumulative incidence function between intermediate- and prophylactic-dose anticoagulation
groups.

Supplementary Table 3. Patient characteristics in overall study cohort. “Anticoagulation
during hospitalization” is based upon the maximum intensity of anticoagulation that each patient
received during hospitalization, with each patient falling into one category (as described in the
“Methods”). “Prophylactic” anticoagulation refers to patients who received a maximum of
prophylactic-dose enoxaparin or subcutaneous unfractionated heparin. “Intermediate”
anticoagulation refers to patients who received a maximum of intermediate-dose enoxaparin or
subcutaneous unfractionated heparin. “Therapeutic” anticoagulation refers to patients who
received a maximum of therapeutic-dose enoxaparin, intravenous heparin, or bivalirudin.
“Alternative enoxaparin dose” refers to patients who received a maximum dose of enoxaparin
that was not able to be categorized as prophylactic, intermediate, or therapeutic. “No
documented anticoagulation” refers to patients who did not receive enoxaparin, heparin,
bivalirudin, or a direct oral anticoagulant during their hospitalization. Abbreviations: BMI, body
mass index; DDmax, maximum D-dimer level during hospitalization; DOAC, direct oral
anticoagulant; FEU, fibrinogen equivalent units; ICU, intensive care unit; LOS, length of stay,
expressed as median; RI, Rothman Index.

Supplementary Figure 1. Distribution of propensity scores before and after propensity
score matching in the anticoagulation cohort. Propensity scores were calculated using a
caliper width of 0.25 and different combinations of variables in the anticoagulation cohort. For
each combination of variables, the distribution of propensity scores in patients who received
prophylactic- vs. intermediate-dose anticoagulation was compared. Among patients in the
anticoagulation cohort, the best-matched scores incorporated age, maximum D-dimer,
admission Rothman Index, body mass index, and race with a random number generator seed of
3000 (“Age + DD + RI + BMI + Race v1”). Key: “DD”, maximum D-dimer level during
hospitalization; “Male”, male sex; “Race”, African-American race; “Probability of INT”, probability
of receiving intermediate-dose anticoagulation; “RI”, admission Rothman Index; “v1”, random
number generator seed 3000; “v2”, random number generator seed 1000.
