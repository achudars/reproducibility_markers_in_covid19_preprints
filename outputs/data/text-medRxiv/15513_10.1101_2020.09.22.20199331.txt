Abstract
Introduction

The global COVID-19 pandemic has radically changed the way health care is delivered in many
countries around the world. Evidence on the experience of those receiving or providing maternity
care is important to guide practice through this challenging time.
Methods

A cross-sectional study was conducted in Australia. Five key stakeholder cohorts were included to
explore and compare the experiences of those receiving or providing care during the COVID-19
pandemic. Women, their partners, midwives, medical practitioners and midwifery students who had
received or provided maternity care from March 2020 onwards in Australia were invited to
participate in an online survey. which was released between 13th May and 24th June 2020; a total of
3701 completed responses were received.
Findings

While anxiety related to COVID-19 was high among all five cohorts, there were statistically
significant differences between the responses from each cohort for most survey items. Women
were more likely to indicate concern about their own and family’s health and safety in relation to
COVID-19 whereas midwives, doctors and midwifery students were more likely to be concerned
about occupational exposure to COVID-19 through working in a health setting than those receiving
care through attending these environments. Midwifery students and women’s partners were more
likely to respond that they felt isolated because of the changes to the way care was provided.
Despite concerns about care received or provided not meeting expectations, most respondents were
satisfied with the quality of care provided, although midwives and midwifery students were less
likely to agree.
Conclusion

This paper provides a unique exploration and comparison of experiences of receiving and providing
maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Findings are useful to support further
service changes and future service redesign. New evidence provided offers unique insight into key
stakeholders’ experiences of the rapid changes to health services.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020 (1)
has resulted in rapid, significant and previously unprecedented changes to the way maternity
services are provided around the world. These changes have impacted many stakeholders of
maternity services including women, their partners and support people, midwives, medical staff and
midwifery students (2).
In the global context, Australia has had lower prevalence of COVID-19 positive cases and lower
mortality rates when compared to similar countries. At the time of reporting, Australia had a total of
1011 COVID-19 positive cases per million people (/mill) and 25 deaths/ mill in comparison to the
United States (US) who had 17, 935 cases/mill and 550 deaths/ mill, or the United Kingdom (UK) with
4947 cases/mill and 611 deaths/mill since the pandemic started (3). Reports from countries
profoundly impacted by the pandemic including Italy, China, Brazil, the UK and the US have all
conveyed the need to change the way that maternity services, particularly hospital–based care for
childbearing women and their families, are provided (4, 5). Australia is no exception, and there have
been almost weekly updates to the policies that support clinical practice and guidelines around
whom may attend which pregnancy care appointments, when, and for how long (6, 7). The speed at
which health services have had to change their models of providing maternity care has impacted
both those that receive maternity care (women and their partners), as well as those that provide
maternity care (midwives, midwifery students and doctors).

In response to the high transmission and reproduction rates of the COVID-19 virus, the underlying
objective of the rapid health service redesign in Australia has been centred on ensuring physical
distancing, and reducing non-urgent contact between individuals who do not usually live in the same
home (8). In addition, enhanced application of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including masks,
face shields, gowns and gloves, as well as heightened awareness of the need for hand hygiene have
been implemented in an effort to minimise the potential spread of the virus (9).
Health service models that have until recently relied on physical contact for clinical assessment and
face to face provision of education, health promotion, clinical care and early parenting support have
been radically transformed to be provided remotely via telephone, video calls, and with significantly
shortened or in some cases, cancelled face-to-face appointments (8). Antenatal assessments have
been moved to telehealth appointments using phone interviewing; with minimal contact
appointments reserved for pregnancy care in later gestations, or for women who have complex
health conditions (8). Face to face antenatal education programs across Australia were discontinued.
This decision has impacted access to information in a format that has traditionally included women
and their birth support partners, preparing them for pregnancy, labour, birth, and early parenting
(10). Limitations were placed on the number of support people permitted to be present during
labour and birth; in many settings, women were required to nominate only one support person
which has caused concern for women and their partners (11, 12)
There is also emerging concern about the health and wellbeing of health professionals who are
providing direct care. A recent study in China surveyed doctors, exploring measures of psychological
stress, found that staff, particularly those in areas with higher COVID-19 prevalence, displayed high
levels of psychological, emotional and physical duress (13). There are similar concerns for the
welfare of students, especially midwifery students who have specific clinical experience
requirements that they must fulfil in order to complete their courses (14, 15).

Whilst there has been some professional commentary (15) and early reporting of the impacts of
providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic from other countries (5), there is limited
evidence that reports on the experience of those receiving or providing maternity care during this
time in Australia, especially from multiple perspectives. There is also no published research that
facilitates a comparison of the experiences and impact of the pandemic on cohorts such as women,
partners and relevant health professionals during this same period.
This study aim was to explore and compare the multiple perspectives and experiences of those
receiving and providing maternity care in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods

A cross sectional exploratory design was used to survey five key stakeholder cohorts of maternity
care in Australia. Cross sectional studies are known for their utility in collecting and measuring data
at discrete points in time (16). Given the rapid changes to health service delivery in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, this methodology was considered ideal to address the identified study aim of
exploring and comparing the perspectives and experiences of receiving and providing care during
the pandemic. Human research ethical approval was granted by Curtin University (HRE2020-0210)
with reciprocal approval issued through Deakin University (2020-175) and The University of
Melbourne (2057065).
Research Setting

There are around 315, 000 births annually in Australia(17). Maternity care is provided in the public
and private settings with 25% of births nationally occurring the private sector (18). Most women
receive support from a partner or designated companion (19). Midwifery care is well integrated into
the health system. All women have a midwife with them when they give birth and midwifery care is
provided in the hospital and community settings (18). Specialist obstetricians and physicians care for
women and their babies in both public and private settings, general practitioners provide primary

and some secondary maternity care (20). Midwifery students are prepared in Australian universities
in a range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses with Nationally standardised minimum
clinical requirements (14, 21)
Data Collection

There was no existing validated survey tool available to facilitate the exploration and comparison of
stakeholders’ experiences of maternity care during a global pandemic. The survey was developed by
the research team who have content expertise in each of the cohorts represented and in survey
design. The research team was intentionally formed to include midwifery researchers and
academics, one obstetrician/ gynaecologist, one public health clinician and two academics with
expertise in psychology including one academic with expertise in research on fathers.
The online survey was hosted on Qualtrics and was designed to compare the experiences of those
receiving and those providing maternity care throughout Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic,
and was guided by the WHO guidelines for respectful maternity care (19). Informed consent was
indicated by participants’ selecting a check box before proceeding to complete the survey.
Demographic data were collected from each cohort including which Australian state they live, work
or study in, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous Australian) status, gender, language
spoken at home, country of birth, and age. Eleven similarly-matched questions relating to
participants’ experience of receiving or providing maternity care were asked with a 6 item Likert
scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The first four survey items asked participants
about their perceptions of their personal safety as well as the safety of their families. A further six
questions assessed participants’ satisfaction with care, either received or provided. Finally,
participants were asked to indicate the extent to which some of their experiences turned out better
than they expected.. Participants were then asked to provide 3 words that described their
experiences of receiving or providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A full outline of the survey is available in a supplementary file. The survey was piloted with up to five
stakeholders from each of the five cohorts for face validity and clarity. Minor modifications were
made to layout and question sentence structure as a result of the feedback received. All pilot survey
entries were then deleted before releasing the survey across Australia. The survey was distributed
on 13th May and closed 6 weeks later on the 24th June 2020. The decision to close the survey was
based on a noticeable slowing in responses.
Recruitment

Convenience sampling was undertaken using social media. We chose social media rather than
recruiting through health services as this intentionally distanced this study from any specific service
or provider, potentially reducing bias in the sample and facilitating freedom of response at
participants’ convenience, possibly encouraging more honest sharing of experiences. The survey was
advertised on relevant Australian social media pages and in health professional newsletters with the
intent of targeting each of the specific cohorts. Those who had received maternity care included
women who were pregnant or had given birth since March 2020, as well as partners and other
support people such as extended family, friends, doulas or others who had supported a woman in
pregnancy, birth or postnatal care during the identified period. Those who had provided maternity
care since the beginning of March 2020 included registered midwives, doctors involved in maternity
care (which encompasses General Practitioners, Obstetricians, Neonatologists and other medical
practitioners) and students of midwifery courses in Australia.
Data Analysis

Data were imported into IBM SPSS Statistics v26. Cases for which only demographic data were
provided were removed from the dataset. Demographic data and COVID-19 testing status are
presented as n (%). In order to avoid low cell counts for smaller cohorts, we recoded responses to
the Likert scale questions into binary variables: “Agree” (Strongly agree, agree, somewhat agree) and
“Disagree” (Strongly disagree, disagree, somewhat disagree). Chi Squared (χ2 ) tests were performed

to identify differences between cohorts on each item, comparing column proportions. Bonferroni
corrections were applied to adjust for multiple tests (22).
The qualitative data (three-word responses) were analysed using NVivo 12. Word frequencies were
counted; we report the top 10 most commonly occurring words for each cohort response. Word
clouds are a useful way to display succinct qualitative data and have significant utility to depict and
rank single word responses as participants distil their thoughts into single concepts (23). Word
clouds were generated, ranking all words within the individual cohort responses. The word
frequency report was generated from exact match words rather than stemmed words, to ensure
that the frequency reporting directly reflected the words left by participants rather than aggregating
concepts through the ‘stemmed words’ approach. For example, where ‘anxiety’ and ‘anxious’ were
separately mentioned these are indicated as such. The coloured words in the centre indicate the
words with the highest prevalence, moving to the bold text in the outer centre circle. Finally, the
words in lighter font indicate the words that constitute the remaining descriptors in the most
frequent words. This data display method provides a visual comparison of the overall stakeholder
experiences which is a useful way to supplement quantitative findings (24).
Results

Among the five cohorts, a total of 3,701 complete responses were received. There was participation
from individuals in each Australian state and territory for all cohorts except for the midwifery
students’ cohort which was not completed by participants from the Northern Territory or Tasmania.
Surveys were completed by those from a range of ethnic backgrounds including Australian
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Participants indicated over 52 countries of birth (other
than Australia) with more than 11% of the total responses from individuals who speak a language
other than English at home. Of the total responses, over 13% (n= 437) of the participants had been
tested for COVID-19 one or more times; only n=12 (0.32%) returned a positive test. Demographic
variables across all five cohorts are presented in Fig. 1.

A comparison between the five cohorts in relation to the eleven shared survey items is presented in
Fig. 2. There were statistically significant differences in the responses between the cohorts in ten of
the eleven items. Women were more likely to be concerned for their own safety than each of the
other cohort groups (Item 1). When considering the (potential) impact of COVID-19 on their family’s
wellbeing, women were also more likely to respond that they were anxious than midwives or
doctors (Item 2). Finally, when considering the health of the babies born during the pandemic, a
significantly higher proportion of women were concerned for their baby’s health when compared
with responses from those providing care, including midwives and doctors (Item 4).

Regarding perceived risk of personal exposure to COVID-19 through attending or working in a
hospital environment (Item 3), those providing care (midwives, doctors and midwifery students)
were more likely to be concerned than women or their partners or other support people.
When asked to consider the changes in the way health services had been delivered as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic (Item 5), significantly fewer women and partners / other support people were
satisfied with the changes than midwives and medical staff. Similarly, a significantly higher
proportion of midwives and medical staff indicated that their professional expectations of providing
maternity care during the pandemic were being met (Item 6), compared with women’s expectations
of receiving care during the same period. Women’s responses to the statement in item 11 further
confirmed this experience with significantly fewer women, partners / other support people and
midwifery students than midwives and medical staff reporting that in comparison to their
expectations, care experiences turned out better than they thought they might during the COVID-19
pandemic (Item 11). When considering the distancing measures implemented by health services
during the pandemic, midwifery students were more likely to respond that they felt more isolated
than women, midwives and medical professionals (Item 8).
A lower proportion of women and their partners/ other support people agreed that they were able
to receive timely and clear answers to their questions about the impact of COVID-19 on their care,
than midwives or doctors responding to the same question about their ability to provide timely and
clear answers to women and families in their care (Item 7). Interestingly, despite this result, a higher
proportion of women agreed that they were satisfied with the quality of care they received, than
midwives and midwifery students who were reflecting on their satisfaction with the care they were
able to provide (Item 9). This is supported with the equivocal (no significant difference) response
from each cohort regarding their satisfaction with the way health services were managing risk during
the pandemic (Item 10).

Discussion

This unique study sought to explore and compare the experiences of a range of key stakeholders in
maternity care, including those who have received and provided care during the COVID-19 pandemic
in Australia. Findings offer new insights into the individual and collective experience and facilitate a
comparison which has highlighted areas of difference among the cohorts.
In response to the global pandemic, changes to the way maternity care is delivered have been swift,
decisive and our research would suggest, disruptive. The most significant disruption was for women
and their partners, who revealed that they were dissatisfied with the changes made to the way
maternity care was delivered during COVID-19. A recent report from a survey of 2750 women
conducted by the Australian College of Midwives (ACM) supports our findings. In the ACM report,
30% of women responded that they had considered changing their planned place of birth, 26% of
women indicated that they had considered changing their care provider, 55% of these women
indicated that this notion was in response to the changes made in health services such as not being
allowed to have a support person attend appointments, with 36% acknowledging the reason being
unable to bring their children to appointments due to physical distancing requirements (25). There
was no available empirical evidence on the experience of fathers or birth support partners during
COVID-19, but commentary from two Italian neonatologists note their concern about the long term
impacts on the mental health and wellbeing of fathers being separated from their partners and new
babies in the recent changes during the pandemic (26). The descriptions and responses from
partners in our study confirm the experiences of partners’ stress, anxiety and isolation during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
The findings of this research offers important insight as it reveals a divergence between consumers’
and providers’ experiences of, and satisfaction with, the way maternity health service redesign
occurred during the pandemic. Whilst health professionals and midwifery students were also
concerned about the changes to maternity care, it was not to the same extent indicated by women.

This difference may be for a number of reasons such as health professionals’ understanding of the
need to minimise risk, or due to an awareness of government regulations, and constant updates
which families would not have access to. Another contributing factor may be the personal and
professional divide in the nature of each cohorts’ responses. Women and their partners or support
people are likely to have a deep and personal investment in their experience, and frequent changes
in health care provision could understandably influence their satisfaction during periods of
vulnerability. For practitioners, professional standards require flexibility and adaptability to change
in the clinical environment, which may have impacted responses. Further research using in depth
approaches is needed to explore the phenomenon of consumer and health practitioner responses to
health service changes experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.
When considering personal risk of exposure to COVID-19 due to presence in the hospital
environment, all cohorts agreed that this risk had caused them concern. The most significant levels
of worry however were reported from midwives, doctors and midwifery students. This finding may
be associated with health consumers’ practice of engaging with hospitals only when necessary,
whereas health professionals had no direct changes to the frequency of their attendance to
hospitals as workplaces. Findings of a cross sectional survey completed by 700 maternity
professionals in the UK suggested that potential lack of access to PPE, clusters of COVID-19 positive
cases in local areas, and the risk of nosocomial infection may be stressors for health professionals
working in maternity care (27). These assertions are supported in professional commentary offered
in a reflective account of the COVID-19 experience in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, where midwives
have expressed fear for their personal safety and potential exposure to COVID-19 (28). Further
evidence is required regarding the factors contributing to practitioner concern around personal
exposure and risk to families as a result of their maternity care work.
The significant changes to the provision of maternity care using telehealth and physical distancing
during hospital visits had an impact on each of the study cohorts. In describing the experience,

partners’ primary response was ‘isolated’. Although there is little evidence on how fathers or
support partners have experienced maternity care during the pandemic, earlier research has
confirmed that partners have felt isolated from inclusion in maternity care under usual
circumstances (29). It is likely that the changes made to maternity care may have exacerbated this.
When reflecting on feelings of isolation and loneliness experienced, midwifery students in our study
were affected in significantly greater proportions than all other cohorts. Many students were
prevented from attending appointments with women they had agreed to provide continuity of care
throughout their pregnancy, labour and birth and into the postnatal period, a core requirement of all
midwifery education throughout Australia (30). In addition, tuition changes occurred for students
when universities had to move their usual face to face teaching to the online space (31). These
factors are likely to have contributed to the students’ increased sense of isolation and loneliness. A
cross sectional study of 972 midwifery students in Turkey revealed that they experienced high
anxiety levels related to their education and clinical work as students during the pandemic (32).
Although outside of the scope of this study, the authors recommend further exploration of
midwifery students’ experiences with consideration to factors such as different courses, and
students’ stages and progression within their course, which may have had an impact when
considering implications for the wellbeing of the future midwifery workforce.
An interesting result of this study showed that midwives and doctors were more likely to feel that
they could provide timely and clear answers regarding COVID-19 to women and families in their
care, whereas women and partners were less likely to report they received such answers. Our
findings provide a reminder of the need for clear, consistent health communication delivered in
multiple modalities especially during periods of increased stress, such as those experienced in the
current pandemic (33). The ACM report indicated similar findings where women described
inconsistent messages and insufficient information regarding the likely impact of COVID-19 on the
format of their maternity care, or impact on their babies (25).

Despite these shortcomings in communication, between 62% and 92% of each cohort agreed that
their receipt or provision of maternity care during COVID-19 pandemic had turned out better than
they expected; however, women, partners and midwifery students were significantly less likely to
agree than midwives and doctors. Interestingly, women were more likely to indicate overall
satisfaction with the care they had received than all of the other cohorts. An explanation for this
result may be that although a greater proportion of women and partners or support people had
indicated that their maternity care expectations were not met, overall, women were still satisfied
with their care. In addition, women and partners or support people may have understood that
maternity care services were doing their best to meet care needs within a rapidly evolving situation.
Reports from global public health leaders indicate that in the absence of an appropriate vaccine for
the COVID-19 virus, the changes made by health services will stay to a greater or lesser extent in
accordance with local spread of the virus (34). In light of the findings of this study, it is timely to
consider what the consequences would be if a substantial proportion of midwives and midwifery
students are persistently dissatisfied with the care they can provide. A recent review suggested that
staff burnout and attrition from the health care workforce are potential consequences (35). These
data were was collected from May to June 2020 in the Australian pandemic experience; there is
need for more research containing psychometric testing and stress inventory scales to determine
the long term effect of the levels of duress that health professionals have endured, and the impact
on their personal and professional identities and health.
The approach adopted in this study of considering the interconnected experience of those both
receiving and providing care during the same period, provides essential knowledge urgently needed
by health care leaders, policy makers, clinicians and educators. The evidence facilitates
consideration for the way maternity care is continued in Australia during, and after the pandemic.
Equally important, consideration of stakeholder perspectives will inform what changes should and
could be made if and when the pandemic eases. It is timely and important to note the difference

between the responses of consumers and providers of care so that future health service redesign
may be undertaken with a holistic view by understanding what is important to consumers and
providers of maternity care; and what the experiences of the current radical redesign has been.
Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of this study lie in the exploration of a range of stakeholders’ perspectives of receiving
or providing maternity care during the COVD-19 pandemic. The large sample size and timely data
collection during the early peak of the pandemic has resulted in a data set that has significant utility
and addresses a known gap in evidence regarding the Australian responses to maternity care during
the COVID-19 pandemic, with implications that may also be relevant for consideration by other
nations which have had higher prevalence rates of the COVID-19 virus.
The limitations of this research are related to the convenience sampling technique used, which
involves a non-random selection of participants. The rationale for this selection has been previously
described and was an important consideration for reducing the burden to a population with
recognised distress during the pandemic. As is commonly found in survey-based data collection in
Anglophone nations, our study was completed by participants who most often speak English at
home; as such caution is advised when considering the transferability of the findings to non-English
speaking groups.
Conclusion

This study provides the first-known evidence to address the identified gap regarding multiple
stakeholders’ experiences of receiving or providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in
Australia. As national and international health leaders begin to consider what will be the ‘new
normal’ of the way maternity care is provided, the findings highlighted in this study will contribute to
an understanding of the broader human and social implications of health service redesign beyond
epidemiological and financial factors.
