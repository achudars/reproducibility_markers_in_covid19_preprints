Abstract
Background: School reopened in August-September 2020 and their effect on COVID-19
infections is unclear.
Methods: We examined Coronavirus Disease-19 incidence following school reopening in
Florida.
Results: We found that counties teaching physically had 1.2-fold incidence increase in
elementary schools and 1.3-fold increase in high schools, while counties teaching remotely had
no increase.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that counties teaching physically could consider teaching
remotely, especially in high school, until it is safe to teach physically.

What was known: Schools reopened in August-September 2020, with some teaching remotely,
since the effect of physical reopening on COVID-19 infections is unclear.
What we added: counties teaching physically had 1.2-fold incidence increase in elementary
schools and 1.3-fold increase in high schools. This suggests that counties teaching physically
could consider teaching remotely instead, especially at the high school level.

Introduction:
The United States closed most of its schools in March-April 2020, which was associated with a
later reduction in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence.1 In August-September 2020,
elementary schools and high schools have reopened, with many schools teaching remotely until
they estimate they can safely teach physically.

Their calculation is based on the current understanding of the tradeoffs of lower COVID-19
incidence in these age groups,2 the educational and social costs of school closure versus the risk
of spreading the virus to older age groups.3 We seek here to quantify the physical reopening risk
by examining these associations in a single state.

Methods:
We searched for a state with both physical learning and remote learning, and that has a COVID19 database that allows calculation of the exact COVID-19 rate at the county level of ages 6-13
years (elementary school) and 14-17 years (high school). The Florida dataset matched these
criteria.4 We extracted the daily incidence of cases by county, and matched it with each county’s
date of school reopening (day 0).5 We examined the COVID-19 case rate with a 7-day moving
average.

We aggregated the rates by counties with physical learning and counties with remote learning
(the latter was only allowed in Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach). We calculated time

points at which the trends changed, in the 10 days before reopening and the 20 days from
reopening. The trend analysis used the JoinPoint Regression Program (National Cancer
Institute). Lastly, we tested for each age group if the slopes from school reopening to day 20 are
significantly different between counties teaching physically and remotely. The statistical tests
were 2-tailed with significance at under 0.05.

Results:
In counties teaching physically, at ages 6-13 years the incidence decreased from day -10 to day 4
(-0.5% daily-change, 95%-CI -0.9% to -0.1%), followed by an increase from day 4 to day 20
(0.8% daily-change, 95%-CI 0.5% to 1.1%). On day 4, the incidence was 11 per 100,000 (95%CI 9.9 to 12), and on day 20 it increased to 12.8 (95%-CI 11.7 to 13.9, 1.2-fold; figure 1).

In counties teaching physically, at age 14-17 years the incidence decreased from day -10 to day 1
(-3.2% daily-change, 95%-CI -3.9% to -2.5%), followed by an increase until day 20 (1.4% dailychange, 95%-CI 1.1% to 1.8%). On day 1, the incidence was 16.1 (95%-CI 14.4 to 17.9), and on
day 20 it increased to 20.5 (95%-CI 18.5 to 22.5, 1.3-fold).

In counties teaching remotely, at ages 6-13 years the incidence decreased from day -10 to day 4
(-5.6% daily-change, 95%-CI -6.7% to -4.5%), followed by no significant trend. The slope from
day 0 was significantly different than the slope of counties teaching physically at ages 6-13 years
(T=5.0, p<0.05).

In counties teaching remotely, at age 14-17 years the incidence decreased from day -10 to day 6
(-4.3% daily-change, 95%-CI -5.4% to -3.1%), followed by no significant trend. The slope from
day 0 was significantly different than the slope of counties teaching physically at ages 6-13 years
(T=7.6, p<0.05).

Discussion:
Our analysis shows that physical reopening was followed by increased COVID-19 incidence at
school ages, especially at 14-17 years (high school). Counties with remote reopening did not
have increased incidence, which may also relate to their lower COVID-19 rate before the
reopening, their public mask mandate or their social-economic advantage.

Remote learning consequences are not clear cut as there are tradeoffs, including increased
inequities, less efficient learning and less monitoring for the growing risk of suicidality.6,7
Counties that reopened physically and had increased COVID-19 incidence could consider remote
learning, especially at the high school level.
