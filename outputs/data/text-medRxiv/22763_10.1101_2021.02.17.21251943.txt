Abstract

Australia’s early COVID-19 experience involved clusters in northern Sydney, including
hospital and aged-care facility (ACF) outbreaks. We explore transmission dynamics,
drivers and outcomes of a metropolitan hospital COVID-19 outbreak that occurred in
the context of established local community transmission. A retrospective cohort
analysis is presented, with integration of viral genome sequencing, clinical and
epidemiological data. We demonstrate using genomic epidemiology that the
hospital outbreak (n=23) was linked to a concurrent outbreak at a local aged care
facility, but was phylogenetically distinct from other community clusters. Thirty day
survival was 50% for hospitalised patients (an elderly cohort with significant
comorbidities) and 100% for staff. Staff who acquired infection were unable to
attend work for a median of 26.5 days (range 14-191); an additional 140 staff were
furloughed for quarantine. Transmission from index cases showed a wide dispersion
(mean 3.5 persons infected for every patient case and 0.6 persons infected for every
staff case). One patient, who received regular nebulised medication prior to their
diagnosis being known, acted as an apparent superspreader. No secondary
transmissions occurred from isolated cases or contacts who were quarantined prior
to becoming infectious. This analysis elaborates the wide-ranging impacts on
patients and staff of nosocomial COVID-19 transmission and highlights the utility of
genomic analysis as an adjunct to traditional epidemiological investigations. Delayed
case recognition resulted in nosocomial transmission but once recognised, prompt
action by the outbreak management team and isolation with contact and droplet
(without airborne) precautions were sufficient to prevent transmission within this
cohort. Our findings support current PPE recommendations in Australia but

demonstrate the risk of administering nebulised medications when COVID-19 is
circulating locally.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is a major threat to human physical and mental health. A
relatively short incubation period, pre-symptomatic viral shedding and
immunologically naïve population all facilitate rapid propagation(1, 2). A proportion
of cases require tertiary care, with quoted hospitalisation rates between 0.8 and 20%
globally(3, 4). Those not needing admission may still attend healthcare facilities for
assessment. Hospitals therefore represent high risk areas for transmission.
Healthcare workers (HCWs) can suffer illness and additionally become vectors,
unwittingly endangering vulnerable patients.

Australia identified its first COVID-19 cases in late January after which a travel ban to
China was implemented. Roughly one month later further cases occurred, including
within Northern Sydney Local Health District (NSLHD). Here, during March/early April,
a hospital outbreak and several community clusters emerged, including Australia’s
first major residential aged-care facility (RACF) outbreak (5). Nosocomial
transmission soon became evident within the hospital. Herein, we perform an
analysis of the hospital outbreak, merging the findings of contact tracing operations
with SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology.

Methods

Outbreak setting and routine control measures:
The outbreak occurred at Ryde Hospital, a 174 bed general facility situated in
metropolitan Sydney, for which our team provide infectious diseases
(ID)/microbiology consultation services. The first patient met confirmed case
definition for COVID-19 infection on 2nd March 2020 and the last on 2nd April 2020.
On 25th February, when the first case was suspected, an outbreak management team
(OMT) was formed, comprising Infection Prevention and Control Practitioners (IPCP),
senior departmental staff and the consulting ID specialist team. Support was
provided by NSLHD Public Health Unit(PHU) and hospital executive.
Case management was informed by the Communicable Diseases Network Australia
Series of National Guidelines (CDNA SONG) on management of COVID-19(6). These
continue to be revised regularly; the most recent iteration was referenced at all
times. Confirmed cases had a positive molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on
nasopharyngeal swab, sputum or broncho-alveolar lavage. Initial testing was
performed at SAViD (Serology and Virology Division NSW Health Pathology) and
subsequently at Royal North Shore Hospital once in-house testing capability was
established. Real-time PCR detected molecular targets including E gene, RdRp, N
gene and/or Orf 1b. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing was attempted routinely on all
positive samples.

All suspected and confirmed cases were managed with combined contact, droplet
and standard precautions as per NSW Clinical Excellence Commission (CEC)

guidelines(7). These comprised isolation in a single room and staff PPE comprising
surgical mask, fluid-resistant long-sleeved gown, gloves and eye protection. Airborne
precautions were implemented if an aerosol generating procedure was required.
Once nosocomial transmission was recognised, active case detection was
undertaken for all staff (by questioning for symptoms at the start of every shift) and
patients (by identifying patients with “hospital acquired pneumonia” on the
electronic Antimicrobial Stewardship sYstem (eASY AMS; Monitor Software, Sydney,
Australia).

At the time, all COVID-19 cases diagnosed within NSLHD were notified to the
ID/Clinical Microbiology team for management and staff residing in other LHDs
identified as cases/contacts were notified to the OMT via district infection control.
Hospital-based patient contacts were identified using a dedicated contact tracing
application (QlikQ, QlikTech International AB) that integrated with the electronic
medical records, and by direct communication with health managers. Given the high
risk clinical setting, staff identified as contacts were instructed to self-isolate for 14
days and present for testing should they develop symptoms. Clearance/release from
isolation was granted per CDNA Guidelines.

Retrospective outbreak analysis
A retrospective analysis of pre-collected data was undertaken, with three aims: first,
to define the hospital associated outbreak cohort; second, to clarify any links
between the hospital outbreak and concomitant community clusters; third, to

examine the drivers of hospital associated transmission. Research approval was
granted by NSLHD Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) (2020/STE01571).
An epidemiologic outbreak hypothesis and viral phylogenetic trees analysis were
developed independently to avoid bias. The clinical and molecular teams then met to
refine the outbreak hypothesis.

Definition of the outbreak cohort and locally acquired clusters (Fig 1)
The OMT was aware of 63 persons diagnosed with COVID-19 between 2nd March and
2nd April 2020 within the hospital and/or surrounding community. Their clinical
records were screened to determine likely source of acquisition and seek any
hospital contact during their incubation/infectious periods. Hospital attendance for
COVID-19 testing (performed under contact and droplet precautions) was not
included. 49 persons were determined to have locally-acquired transmission. Of
these, 23 were implicated in the hospital transmission and/or acquisition and were
included in a focused outbreak analysis.

SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology
We sought to obtain SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences for all persons implicated with
locally acquired infection (n=49 samples of interest). Accordingly, SARS-CoV-2
genome sequence data was obtained for all but one of the samples and performed

by UNSW SAViD (Serology and Virology Division NSW Health Pathology) team,
according to an analytically validated workflow employing Oxford Nanopore
sequencing (8). The methods are described in the Supporting information section.
One patient who was transferred to Westmead Hospital had genome sequencing
performed on their sample by NSW Health Pathology (NSWHP) at that site.

Hospital outbreak analysis
A detailed analysis was undertaken of the 23 persons involved in the hospital
outbreak. Information collected included age, comorbidities, date of symptom onset,
implementation of contact/droplet precautions, tests undertaken(positive and
negative) and clinical outcome. Information was gathered about movement of each
person within clinical areas and period of isolation/absence from work.

For all identified cases, exposure periods (based on an incubation period of 1-14
days) and infectious periods (beginning 48 hours prior to symptom onset until date
of certified clearance) were determined(6). Likely hospital transmission routes were
hypothesised using this information. Number of secondary transmissions were
calculated based on maximum number of plausible transmissions from a single
person.

Results

Cohort Identification: Epidemiologic and Genomic Analysis
Of the 23 hospital outbreak cases, 13 samples underwent successful viral genome
sequencing and were identified as belonging to SARS-CoV-2 lineage B4 using the
Pangolin lineage assignment tool (Fig 2). Additionally, in two cases there was a clear
epidemiological link between index cases and secondary/tertiary generations from
whom genome sequence data was obtained: the lineage of the index person was
also inferred as B4. Overall, viral genome sequence data was determined in 9/11
patients/visitors and 7/12 staff. Three of the patients were residents of the local ACF
involved in the outbreak and their viral genome sequences clustered with other
hospital cases (also within lineage B4).

during March-April 2020.

A further 26 persons had locally-acquired infection during the outbreak period.
Seven of these were indirectly linked to the hospital (through household/social
contact), 5 of which were fell within the B4 lineage. A further 7 were linked to the
ACF but not the hospital; 3 these were sequenced and all found to be lineage B4. In

sequenced; these were phylogenetically distinct from the ACF/hospital cases, falling
into the B1 and A3 lineages.

Hospital cases: Clinical characteristics and outcomes
The hospital outbreak cohort included 12 staff members, 10 patients (8 of whom
were hospitalised with COVID-19 infection) and one visitor to a later diagnosed
COVID-19 patient. One patient was also a staff member. Fig 3 shows the epidemic
curve of the outbreak and Fig 4 shows the outbreak timeline with exposure and
infectious periods. Table 1 summarises the characteristics of infected
patients/visitors and staff, while clinical, virologic and transmission characteristics of
each infected person are presented in Tables 2 and 3. Patients/visitors affected were
advanced in age (median 81 years, range 54-91) compared to infected HCWs
(median 42 years, range 19-66) and had more comorbid conditions.

Thirty day survival was 63.6% amongst the patients/visitors groups and 50.0%
amongst those who were hospitalised with COVID-19. All infected HCWs survived at
30 days, although one was hospitalised, requiring ICU level care. There was
substantial forced absenteeism amongst infected staff (median 26.5 days, range 14191 days). Additionally, a total of 140 staff (71 nurses, 31 doctors, 15 porters, 12
cleaners, 10 allied health professionals and one administration officer) were
identified as contacts and furloughed for quarantine for between one and 18 days.

Hospital transmission characteristics
The median incubation period was 6.6 days for patients and 5.0 days for staff (range
2-11 days) (Fig 5). Several patients/staff unwittingly spent time on site whilst
infectious. One patient was administered regular nebulised medication in a four
bedded room for several days prior to their diagnosis being known. This person’s
infection resulted in the greatest number of secondary transmissions (eight). Among
those infectious whilst on-site, several potential contacts were identified (range 4-58
people). The mean number of secondary cases was 3.5 for patients and 0.6 for staff,
with a wide dispersion in the number of secondary transmissions (Fig 6). Among
those persons identified as contacts and isolated, no secondary cases occurred. All
identified transmission events could be explained by a person either coming into
direct contact with an infected person without transmission-based precautions, or
due to a documented PPE breach. In the remaining case, a HCW was treating a
patient in an adjacent bed to the infectious person using a nebuliser.

Discussion
We present a detailed case study of a situation that played out globally in healthcare
facilities throughout 2020. This outbreak was the first recognised Australian cocluster between an ACF and a hospital. Our study provides important insights, by
integrating viral genome sequence data with metadata collected by the locally-based
OMT. Genomic epidemiology is an important supplement to outbreak investigations,
particularly for SARS-CoV-2, and given the emergence of different viral lineages (9,
10). Although the relatively low evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 usually precludes a
detailed analysis of person-person transmission within outbreaks, because virus
transmission occurs more rapidly than virus evolution, it does show utility in
clarifying linked cases, as we have demonstrated here.

The outbreak described here began early in the Australian COVID-19 experience and
some of our patients were not recognised as being infected for several days. This
undoubtedly resulted in transmission episodes that were avoidable. The fact that
COVID-19 symptoms overlap with other respiratory illnesses and that elderly
patients can be asymptomatic/display atypical symptoms added to delay in diagnosis
at this time (5)

Our key findings are threefold. First, we demonstrate the impact of hospital onset
SARS-CoV-2 infection (HOCI) on patients and hospital staff. Second, we show that
secondary attack rates were fairly low in this cohort (despite large numbers of
contacts), yet highly variable. Finally, we describe some of the factors potentially
associated with transmission and outbreak outcomes.

Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is of great concern to patients and
HCWs(11). However, when infection is diagnosed in a HCW, hospital-based
acquisition cannot always be assumed, particularly when community transmission
rates are high (12). Viral genome sequencing of our outbreak cohort was useful in
providing supportive evidence for our hypothesis that the identified hospitalassociated cases were linked, both to each other and the local ACF outbreak. The
consequences of this outbreak for individuals were significant, and in some instances
devastating. Two patients who acquired the infection whilst admitted for another
condition died with COVID-19. Several infected staff required sustained periods of
absence from work (due to illness or prolonged SARS-CoV-2 positivity) and even
more were quarantined following exposure. Although understandable from a public
health perspective, prolonged absences can result in personal, financial and
psychological stress to those affected. The pressure on remaining staff can increase
the risk of mistakes (especially in correct use of PPE) and might encourage
presenteeism, both of which may be counterproductive(13, 14). Outbreak
management must therefore be finely tuned, to avoid propagation of the infection,
whilst keeping the hospital running safely. When this outbreak occurred, infected
staff were required to have two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 swabs to return to
work, but with emerging evidence, these criteria have since become less stringent(6,
15).

Our study highlights the numerous social contacts that occur within hospitals, as
evidenced by the numbers of exposed persons found on contact tracing. Despite this,

most identified contacts did not subsequently develop COVID-19. It was notable that
the number of secondary transmissions generated by each case were highly variable
(between 0 and 12) and were different for patients and staff (mean 0.58 from staff;
3.25 from patients). We also observed clear overdispersion in the patterns of
transmission, in which most infected persons infect no other individual, whereas as a
small number of other persons act as apparent “superspreaders”. This phenomenon
characterises many infections and seems particularly relevant to COVID-19 (1, 16-18).

The patient who transmitted to most others was administered medication via a
nebuliser whilst infectious, an aerosol generating procedure which likely increases
transmission risk (19). In healthcare settings, when there is an epidemiologic risk
that COVID-19 is circulating, we would argue that nebulisers should only be used
under airborne precautions and that alternatives (such as bronchodilators delivered
via spacer) are utilised. There may have been other factors that facilitated spread,
such as high viral shedding (not measured) and the time in hospital prior to isolation
(three days). One secondary case that arose from this person was a HCW without
direct contact who was treating a patient in the same bay. This may have been due
to airborne or fomite transmission, although the latter likely occurs at relatively low
frequency (20, 21). With the exception of the nebuliser-associated transmission (for
which airborne precautions would have been used had the infection been
recognised), we did not demonstrate transmission after implementation of
appropriate contact and droplet precautions. This provides some reassurance
regarding the current advice for use of surgical masks rather than respirators(14).

Several factors may have influenced the outcome of this outbreak. The cohort
studied included patients with poor prognostic factors, including advanced age and
cardiovascular/respiratory comorbidities(22). We have illustrated that a brisk
outbreak management team response is critical. As well as isolating known cases,
identification and quarantine of contacts prior to their infectious period is essential,
given the known viral shedding profiles and pre-symptomatic transmission (23, 24).
This is highlighted by the absence of secondary transmissions amongst those of our
contacts who were identified and put on contact/droplet precautions/removed from
work prior to becoming unwell.

Our study has several limitations. The OMT were required to gather epidemiological
data rapidly. Accordingly, there may have been gaps in the collected information,
due to ascertainment and recall bias. Review of the outbreak management
underlines the siloed nature of our healthcare system, with allied professions being
managed through very separate streams; this can present a barrier to rapid infection
control actions. An OMT should incorporate cross-discipline membership to produce
equivalent contact tracing and communication efforts across medical, nursing, allied
health and corporate services. A further challenge is the rapid bed movement of
patients and the lack of a clear formal mechanism for identifying contacts between
patients that are unrelated to bed residence. Despite the OMT’s efforts, infection
and transmission events may have been missed. Ongoing serological studies
performed in NSLHD and other jurisdictions may enhance our understanding.

In summary, we describe a hospital outbreak of COVID-19 linked to a community
ACF cluster and which had substantial impacts on both patients and staff. Our results
add weight to the recommendation that nebulisers should not be used in patients
suspected to have COVID-19. Our study also illustrates that tackling viral outbreaks
requires a sophisticated, detailed approach in which multidisciplinary team members
must collaborate closely to achieve success. These principles will serve us well for
tackling the COVID-19 pandemic in all settings.
